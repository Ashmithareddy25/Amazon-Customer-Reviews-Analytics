B0049Z1Q3W|5|Exactly as described and quoted. Speedy delivery. Thanks!!
B00IOWKZM4|5|So incredibly cute!!! love it!
B000E4VG00|5|Received door handle in the time that was stated to be delivered. It was an exact match to what I had. Installation was a breeze, being a diy guy. And every time when I reach for the handle, I can appreciate that I have an access to quality parts, when needed for my Toyota 2000 Tacoma.<br /><br />Thanks A Lot!!<br />Van
B0054FJEDK|5|Works great
B000M6XCWA|5|I have a 2005 Polaris ATV.  The gas gauge has been broken for some time.  I was looking on Amazon to see if there was anything like it available.  I found this item, ordered it, received it quickly and it fit perfectly .
B002WTQEA2|5|Fixed the check engine light as expected.
B000C9QZ62|4|Fits good, and worked first time. Very poor documentation. Wire &#34;A B and C&#34; wires same as your old one.
B000OAXP4E|5|Looks great!
B00DX8BZ6Y|5|Great bubble, fits in antes regular helmet. Great to use in a sunny day or at night. Great buy!!
B00WOXSMFQ|5|Perfect fit. Only been running it for a couple of months; so far, so good.
B00230H4OA|5|Quick delivery, EZ installation - parts fit and operate perfectly. Thanks for the great service!
B00HQEKGB6|5|Great improvement over the porcelain toilet that came in my 08 Fleetwood Providence. I highly recommend it. Delivery time was as advertised. Installation was easy if hoy are handy. No extra parts were needed.
B010UA5UHW|3|My husband is very excited about these lights but they don't come with instructions and they also do not come with the mounting screws apparently. We are still trying to get them connected.
B00KL3ALGO|4|It does its job of shading and sticks really well even with a toddler poking at it but a little hard to check blind spots with it on the window. It is mesh so its see through but not easy to see through. Let me clarify by saying if you are trying to quickly check and make sure the lane beside you is open when your exit is coming its not going to be easy but if you have the extra moment it takes to focus your eyes youll be able to see. Its only mildly bothersome not enough to take it off but traffic here isnt cutthroat.
B0022ZN6WU|5|Great product. Fit perfectly as described. Nice heavy-duty cover. Paid much more in past for similar quality item. I highly recommend it. No complaints.
B0066QMMDA|5|Can't beat the price. Perfect fit
B008DCP9C6|5|very good quality. Very happy with the purchase.
B009WOXMKK|5|The cross bars fit well and look good on my 2015 Jeep Compass and is a way cheaper option than spending almost $500 on all the separate components from Thule
B00QMNW7H8|5|did what it was made to do. no complaints
B000WJAH5M|3|they were tough to get on
B00QMLTS8Q|2|Black Trim  is Disintegrating
B00UMWR79S|5|Perfec
B007W4KJR6|5|Bought this for my 07 wrangler. It delivers everything promised in the description. The power and gas mileage increase was noticeable too. The install was simple: plug and play and done. I coupled it with a k&n air intake and a cat back exhaust. That's when the real power came out of my jeep. Granted it's no race car but going from 16 to 22 mpg was well worth the effort. Great product and highly recommend it for any jeep.
B00GMOAEAO|1|This would be great if I could get the Precision Instruments 1&#34; rachet head that I have with my torque wrench to detach from the bar!
B004KPOAJI|5|Essential in bad weather or sandy areas - saves the carpet and cleanup is easy. Unfortunately they loose some of their luster when they are cleaned at the car wash - anybody know a cheap way to restore?
B008K7STNK|5|Worked great
B00RGZWIW0|5|Love my trunk organizer! I am an avid farmers market person and it's great to know my vegetables and fruit are not rolling around in the trunk of my car...
B00681BDXI|5|works great easy to program
B00SI37WWU|5|I had the dealer program it, and it works perfectly!
B000C41JUE|3|it works ok maybe a bit looser than the original, have not had great success with cardone products. will stick with delco when I can
B00GUF74HQ|4|Installed relatively easily and works well in enabling the tailgate to slowly lower. It would be much better if it also assisted in closing the tail gate. It doesn't.
B00XKN6O2M|1|broke right away.. not durable at all
B00YDSXGJM|5|Hubby was eyeing one liked this since a friend of ours showed his portable jump starter to him. He's been bugging me since, so i finally gave in as i want to surprised him for his birthday. We live in new england so its very cold on winter time, sometimes our truck wont start so this is a must. This ones comes handy too if you have a boat, who will jump start your boat in the middle of the ocean? Was out fishing boating early today with hubby and kids when we passed by a boat that wont start hubby wants to try it if it does really work so we approached and help them, tried it and worked like charm, the guy from the other boat ask what it is and where did we get it. Hubby said one of the best gift i gave him. Totally worth the money. I received this in exchanged for my honest and unbiased review
B00OO87MCI|5|2014 key fob fits perfectly!  Thx!
B00829JGRY|5|Awesome brake pads, installed them on an 08 E70 X5, fits like a charm, no noise, but the biggest thing is there is no brake dust. Haven't noticed much difference in braking than OEMs once you have worked them in a bit. You may notice slightly less braking initially but that is probably because they need to be worked in plus they do feel a little different from your earlier worn out OEMs. I paired them with Centric rotors.
B002WTHW26|5|Great product, competitive pricing, quick shipping-thanks!
B0100WNVLM|4|Good quality, light, fairly easy to install and seem sturdy. My only complaint is a distinct whistle can be heard from inside the vehicle at 40mph plus with this cross bar mounted. Take them off and there is no whistle.
B001TK0DSY|5|I like this a lot. Cleans my car very nicely and seems to make it repel dirt a bit. It stays cleaner longer after washing with this than it did when I used dawn dish soap. Also makes it much shinier. Love shiny. Smile.
B009M0S4Z2|5|like these covers.  they fit over head rest and top part of seat using elastic and works well after my son's sports and when I go exercise. keep two in the van at all times. very durable and the rubber matting on the back seems to keep the cover from moving about when sitting on it. folds up a little bulky but I put inside the equinox nylon mesh stuff sack 11x16 found here on amazon as well
B000KQ4FL4|1|I would'nt even give these a star,installed them at lunch time,at five o'clock on the way home the driver side blew off and shattered  All over the pavement behind me,it's almost like throwing the money right out the window did'nt last five hours on my truck,and whether tech  Is suppose to be top of the line,I SAY BULLS*** DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY LIKE I DID there junk bottom line
B004ZGAMLW|5|This simple mod is such an upgrade in handling in surprised it isn't part of the build from the manufacturer!
B000C9SI9O|5|Purchased for a 1998 Lincoln Continental. Good filter. Good Price.
B00IWHHPEC|1|Sorry to say it ripped off my shoulder and I ended up losing it on the highway the strings let loose on it not very happy at all
B00NF1EXAE|5|Does fit 2015 Unlimited Jeep says don't but does. They work fine. Best price going for lug nut deterants.
B00SLKPZHY|5|Love these steps.  Fit perfect on my 04 powerstroke
B0002JMF9I|5|Somewhat hard to find and also a great price!
B00DBFNZ9E|5|Exactly what I needed for my bum, great product. Can recommend the air cushion if you got a sore bum.
B00133L17O|4|Bought these about 6 yrs back for a build on my tahoe. Great set of headers for the price. Installed and fit w/o any problems. Flanges are decently thick and years later I still have no exhaust leaks at heads or collector flanges. Good enough to make 653hp on a supercharged 6.0 in my tahoe. I will say though that the black painted finish didn't last long at all. Started peeling about 2 mins after first startup. But, I bought these for function, not necessarily for looks.
B00NRV9O5G|4|Be sure you have HID setup already.  Other than that good product.
B00S4HFNXK|3|I have a 22' Sea Ray Bowrider, which is trailered to the lake, when used. After using these, I realize they are more utilitarian for use in a slip, after the boat has moored and tied up,  to protect against gentle bumping within the slip, as long as the structure is low enough in the water to be in  alignment with these bumpers. They are NOT useful for tieing up to other boats, out on the water, because of wave action and boats riding up and down against one another in choppy conditions. Might be OK in a calm cove with gentle movement. As others have mentioned, these would be especially useful, as permanently attached guard bumpers at a dock or within a slip. But not much good in an active environment. I will be sticking to my round inflated bumpers for the best protection out on the water.
B00BI1U8VQ|5|Once programmed correctly, this got my speedometer spot on. The customer service was great. I messed up, let 6 initial flashes occur instead of 5, and this put it in a different mode. I would start to roll, and this would send the speedo needle to the max speed. I called Motomummy, and they said that they would reach to the manufacturer on my behalf. It was after hours on a Friday, so they couldn't do a whole lot. But did say that they would RMA my purchase for me on Monday. Suggested I reach out to 12 oClock Labs first as they might be able to offer some more insight. I emailed support after hours, and they emailed back with in 20 minutes, with an explanation of what I did, and how to factory reset and correctly set this. Sometimes, a product can be as good as it's support. And theirs rocked. And so nice to know how fast I'm actually rolling down the road.
B007M0ZCHW|3|These Ford Key Fobs have a fundamental design flaw. Where the keyring goes through, you have two different thin, brittle pieces of plastic, that aren't close enough together to reinforce each other. Inevitably they end up cracking. I've had a Ford Focus for a little over 4 years, and I've been through four different shells. They're cheap enough, and easy enough to swap out, but I worry that one of these days I'm going to lose my fob when it just falls off.<br /><br />I'd like to see an after market shell that fits the same circuit board as the stock shell, but which avoids the design flaw that the stock shell has. These get the job done, but they've only been lasting me about a year each.
B0009OMY9C|5|Quality tool. It will last me for years.
B000BUU5YA|5|Good product
B00P9EJGR0|5|These mats were super-easy to install and they cover the back of the seats very well.
B002J9SMP0|1|Junk
B00N03G1IE|5|Punisher!!! Self Explanatory!
B004A69HTK|5|They filt well, perfect length
B00BS102A8|5|As expected.
B0014477MU|1|Junk talk about a waste of money. It didn't last a month and I can't return it because I took to long to install it. DO NOT BUY......
B00ZGHA0BQ|4|A nice affordable fire proof jacket. Colors are bright, material is sturdy and the fit is generous. I would recommend.
B0007M1ZGE|4|easy to install on RV bumper, it's a standard size.  Works great for our bike rack behind the RV.  I don't like how the threaded bolts, which sit on ttop of the bumper take the brunt of the weight though.
B00BCRMBSO|5|Before buying at a discount for my honest review, I checked to see if they'd fit our 2015 Chevy Cruze. It didn't have any Cruze listed but still tried it out! We wanted a set of affordable car seat covers to protect the leather in the new car from any kid stains or accidents from spills, etc. and to overall let the leather seats last longer down the road a few years.<br /><br />I had no problem putting the pieces on the car seats. The headrests in our Cruze were larger than the headrest covers in this set but I squeezed them on and then they were alright. The tan color is almost perfect match to our car seat interior leather that is also tan.<br /><br />I recommend this as a great universal fitting car seat cover set. The steering wheel cover helps me grip the wheel better as well as keeping it clean.<br /><br />As this only lets me upload one picture I used the one for the backseat which is 60/40 for our car. Covers are a little loose but keep in mind they are universal made to fit multiple makes and models. It looks loose but really it's not as the pieces are staying put even after my two girls climb in for long rides.<br /><br />Again I got these at a reduced price for my honest review.
B005VL3BPE|5|Great deal I save over $90.00 dollars by coming here to purchase this tail light. At first I was little bit taken by the price. After receiving the light and replacing the old Tail light I was very thankful for the fit perfect and the quality great. Hope I don't need a another tail light but If I do I'll be back.
B0022ZX79W|1|Picture is misleading as you only get one piece, but more importantly it DID NOT fit my bike even though the item description stated it would.
B00EYV2PJU|4|The plate holding the spring in one of the alternators isn't glued down like the others, so it pops out every time I remove the batteries, but otherwise they look really good and I'm excited to get started!
B00S4PL3UY|5|Excellent drying towel... Bought this to assure not streaking or lightly scratching the paint on a black car and it does that job well... Came recommended by a detailer...
B00WB209CO|1|Not what I expected... Too small!!
B00FBKRPGG|5|I have a one word response &#34;AWESOME&#34; I love the way the suction cups hold it tight to the window. They cover the whole window and block all the sun. A solid investment. :) Two thumbs up :)
B0089X2MQ0|5|perfect replacment for a 2008 FOrd ranger w/ 3.0 v6
B0009IBJE4|5|Best charger I've ever purchased.  Set and forget it's fully automatic
B002IV6U12|5|Exact OEM Yamaha part
B000WOCGIS|5|was a little thicker than original but fit fine
B00176QVZ4|5|Great product.  Rode 3800 miles on my last trip.  Adding and removing is a snap.
B008HZOSTO|5|Came with all necessary hardware and brake grease!
B001879CUS|5|Did as supposed to.
B00030414I|2|First, shipping was great, no issues.  My problem was that the pressure monitor had to be mounted outside the hub caps. This cause the wheels to be severely unbalanced.  Had to send back.  No issue with the return.
B00MLW6JGY|2|The advertisement leads you to believe I would be getting 2 purifiers but only 1 in package. I don't understand
B001V8U12M|4|its a socket. fits the driver and the jacks. Not much to say, call me satisfied.
B008D2L2OA|2|Too small and could not stretch it to make it fit.  Had to return it!!!
B00HSO479Q|5|great idea!  Does the job.  I thought it would be made of a more heavy duty material but in reality I guess there is little or no stress on the strap
B00TKON4PA|3|it Looks cool but it does fit at all and it shake a lot  ..  I have to improvise but at the end I really like it
B000BIUEB6|2|Too small.  Don't go by the sizing criteria that they give you.  Order 1-2 sizes larger.
B00603DSGO|4|Well this is a bullet proof mount, I now understand the price. The finish is a very durable texture coat. I would give it a 5 stars but like some others have said before the mount isn't strait, it tilts the antenna to the right a few degrees. Other then that it is an amazing mount.
B00FGKGJ40|4|This is great stuff. Applied 2 coats waiting 12hours between each coat. Then applied butter wet wax. Terrific shine on my 2011 Ford F-150 Platinum. Will for sure order more. Thanks chemical guys.
B00ARJNR7M|1|Product did not fit correctly--1/8' too long for Chevy S10. Installed first one and it got torn up in the housing.  Installed second one with shim and it works.  Good thing I only needed one.  How does Amazon state that 'this fits your vehicle' when it really doesn't?
B00BYUXCUA|4|As described...  Would order again!
B000WK60HK|5|Plating comes off with wear but works great
B003NTHPQC|5|That's my very thought.
B00JHPJMW6|5|Quick and easy replacement for the antenna that was broken at the car wash. The person was a little to rough putting it down. The placement of the antenna by the manufacturer was poor. Therefore I only use it extended out by about six inches, which is enough to draw in the stations I listen to in my area. Came with all of the hardware including two new mounting screws to attach to the window post. They are not stainless, so you might want to spray them with a little lubricant to avoid ugly rust build up!
B007BLMVP8|4|One of the least expensive plugs for my son's vehicle. No issues so far.
B00DI3DV6G|3|very convenient, but dont overload...handle came right off!
B006YM41XA|3|Looked and fit good but paint faded really quick.
B00EHIPUHE|3|I bought this thinking it was a plug and play kit. When I received my new headlight housings I went to install these and found that you have to hook them directly to your battery and there's only 1 headlight plug. The directions are not clear. I returned them and put stock bulbs in for now. I am looking for the correct set now. The set I got did look high quality, but the directions were terrible. 3 stars for appearance. Actual quality and longevity unknown.
B00B6FWHDG|5|These Look Great! Can't even take a good picture because they are like a mirror. Couldn't be happier with them. They snapped right in place on my 2005 Escalade ESV stock 17&#34; rims. Each individual cap came packed in bubble wrap to prevent scratches and damage. Your gonna want to get these caps!
B001JBAUHW|5|As listed OEM sunshade for 1 series, well made product, keeps it much much cooler inside while parked in sun.
B009WDZCJ0|5|Great American part!!!
B00DT7S72Y|3|Way too big. The sizing chart did absolutely nothing for me. I decided to keep them to wear over coveralls.
B004YJTKN6|3|Raised my f150 about 1-3/4&#34; after settling in. Only problem was I have a clunk in r/s after installing. Contacted Rancho, they did not reply. Disappointed in customer service
B00IIVUXLO|5|Fits perfect in the back of a corvette c7 coupe.
B004IP8IZC|5|Very good
B00VSZ5YGG|3|low quality materials, poor design. uses AA's, but the battery slot can barely fit them.
B0071Q4TEE|5|Thank you for making the color white. I do appreciate it. Now it will be seen by many.
B00QVLQHAO|5|This item is great.  It saves you from getting messy and it is very easy to operate! Highly recommended!
B00AK00TI8|5|Very good and original item, fits exactly, no problems and fast delivery.
B000EZU90M|5|works like the one that came on the car
B00JEKC8ZM|5|A bit darker in color than expected but my husband loves it!
B00681BE2S|5|Nice.. I got it before it what's supposed to be, pretty easy to reprogram
B0000AYFTH|5|Product is good quality and does what it's designed to do.
B00C8YXH9C|2|Excellent build with many cool strobe light options, but with a major fault - it DRAINS the batteries. Kinda defeats the purpose of ER use rendering them useless & unreliable. They come in a handy pouch, so what I've do is keep the batteries separate in the pouch. But that means I'll have to fiddle with battery installation in an emergency. I don't think that will work out, but what the heck? Too bad. The lights have great potential and I hope the company has made a fix. It would really be good PR & solidify their reputation if Wagan would allow for some kind of credit towards another purchase to customers stuck with these defects. For the time being, I am skeptical to make another Wagan product purchase based on these lights.  On the other hand, they make for great party strobe lights. They'll definitely get the party going.
B001D20X4W|5|Fit perfect!
B000F285EG|4|jack handle still rattles
B005FN207I|4|Didn't quite fit the back seat with molded head rests like I wanted them to but made it work.
B009X5GP8E|5|good product used on roof when replacing rv skylight..good idea to wear rubber disposable gloves
B0051N58T4|4|Very bright and a good replacement for the old ones on my trailer. I got a pair of these to replace the incandescent ones. They plugged right in and work perfectly fine. They do seem to be a little bit looser in the rubber mount then my old ones. Not enough for me to worry about however. These are a recommended replacement if you want lights that are brighter and have less current draw.
B00C306A90|5|Look great and fit well
B003B44C6U|5|Used on our vacation this summer (2015) and we really packed the carrier. We were pleased the way it handled and would recommend it to anyone!
B00FJ2Z6Q2|5|Looks real good on the back of my powerstroke!
B0000AYZE8|5|Worked perfectly and had all the parts needed. I typically buy the Mercury parts for fuel and water pumps but this Sierra kit seems to be working just fine.
B002UC16QI|5|Worked great. No problem with installation and cheaper than a mobile home store
B00H2VVM8E|5|wonderful product! would recommend without hesitation. get some brushes that you'll never use again - this stuff will make that brush useless afterwards.
B008YFTB4E|5|Works great shipping was fast. Would recommend any day
B0027Z6CY4|5|Very strong worth the money!
B007WR25ES|1|We got ours for a family trip and were initially pleased.  It was fairly obvious to install, and seemed very sturdy.  The general &#34;shapelessness&#34; of it means you can put it on top of pretty much anything that has something to attach the straps to.  The straps tend to rattle loose too easily and flap horribly, though.  Replacing them with bungees worked a lot better.<br /><br />My objection is the quality of the thing.  We took it from NC to Michigan, moderately loaded with duffle bags and life jackets.  When we got there, there was a rip in the seam about eight inches long.  By the time we got back to NC, there was another rip of about the same size, and one of the zippers was separating from the case.  We took it on another three hour trip, and the coating was coming off the canvas core, and the seams were coming apart more.<br /><br />Perhaps we got a bad one from the factory.  We loaded it moderately while it was on top of the car, drove at regular freeway speeds, and stored it in a dry, cool garage.  It doesn't make sense that this thing would be coming apart after 36 hours of use.
B00W7928PC|5|great stuff,will buy again for my wife's car,she is a bad driver.
B00FSIN0U6|5|Great energy savings for RV light fixtures.
B000701HF0|5|Works great. Have no issues!
B004EIAADG|5|Let's just say I bought this as an &#34;in-case&#34; situation machine for my slightly aged car. I have used it so much though since getting it that I don't know what I used to do without it. I have jumped many cars and pumped up many tires. I have ran a projector off it for outdoor use. I can charge my phone or laptop when needed and it's got power to spare. It's light and portable and we even bring it down to the lake to jump our water equipment when needed. I am getting one for my father so he stops using mine.<br />Only con I see is that the gauge for the Air compressor shows the air in the tire instead of how much air the compressor has which can be confusing at first. It's also a bit slow but gets the job done. I didn't read the instructions like a typical guy so it probably says all this anyway :) have fun finding uses for yours!
B000AL6WLA|1|IT WAS NOT THE PRODUCT WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR AND ALSO IT CAME IN DAMAGED..I WANTED TO RETURN IT BUT WITH RETURN POSTAGE IT WAS NOT WORTH.NOT AT ALL HAPPY.
B00C308FGG|5|Works and looks great on my 98 sporty 1200
B001C6QUT6|2|This does NOT fit a 2007 Avalanche LT with a 5.3 engine as is listed.
B002R0P0WE|5|I was concerned about this not being OEM. However, this fit like a glove! The two guides & the two bolts lined up perfectly & the harness was correct. Looks great, very happy with this purchase.
B000CAVR0A|3|I purchase this on May 2014. It does have a &#34;Paper Filter&#34; material instead of the Original Toyota Micro Mess Screen Filter that is in my RAV4. There is no leak as everything I do, I always made sure it is torque properly to specification. As much as you want to tighten it more, DON'T. You MUST use a torque wrench and for my Toyota RAV4 2003.<br /><br />The torque is.. 84 inch pound (Filter Bolt) and 67 inch pound (Pan Bolt) per. Haynes Repair Manual<br /><br />Today I went to change the Transmission Oil & Filter at 30,000 miles (or 24 months) because I notice the the Transmission Oil looks much darker than when it was used with the Original Toyota Transmission Filter in my Toyota RAV4 2003. What I notice is the filter did its job, but I think that it also has built up and cause the oil to be trap in the thick paper filter which lead to the oil to wear down faster than usual.<br /><br />This time, I went back to using the Original Toyota RAV4 2003 Transmission Filter & O-Ring. Also use the Toyota Brand Transmission Oil. I spent $107 with CA tax (Transmission Filter + O-Ring + Gasket + 4QT Transmission Oil). I did give this Beck Arnley 044-0316 a try because it is so much cheaper than buying the Original Toyota brand. In the end, I ended up buying the Original Toyota Brand as I feel it performs much better. If Beck Arnley would just use the Mirco Mess Screen Filter instead of paper filter, I would buy this item again.
B00IKKS4W8|4|Its great.  We use dewalt drill instead of wrench<br />  So easy!!
B002LLE5WK|5|This is a good replacement kit. You have to cut and crimp the motor home existing wires to the new connector. The wire colors matched so it made that part easy. We used the new magnets and have good batteries so the install went well. The kit hardware bolted up perfectly to our steps. A little cleanup and lube on the steps, and they move smoothly like when they were new.
B009FU7ELE|5|it was shipped quick and got here the same time as the rest of the steering and its a big difference. Thx
B003TSMQWU|5|It gets in incredibly tight places.  It will save your day
B00QK3UNJY|5|Awesome!!!!!!  Looks great
B0006H8AEK|5|These towing mirrors worked PERFECTLY!  I was completely pleased with the fit and performance of these mirrors.  I used them on my 2003 Ford F150 King Ranch pickup truck to haul a travel trailer.  They fit over the truck mirrors that have the turn signal lights in them.  The driver's side mirror allows me to see behind the trailer and the passenger side mirror allows me to see down the entire length of the trailer.  These mirrors mount perfectly and once they are on, they are steadfastly attached due to the way that they are engineered.  There was NO road vibration issue with the mirrors.  They are very easily mounted and removed with the use of one screw that comes with the mirrors.  NO tools are required.  They are GREAT!  In addition, they cost less than most other options available at local auto parts stores.  This is an AWESOME product and it has my highest recommendation.  Just be sure to match the mirrors to your vehicle before you order.
B0016IIXVI|5|Works just like original
B000C9H2AA|5|this is  a good heater hose
B00C0XCHKG|5|This is a great product. The fit was perfect, it arrived within 36 hours and I couldn't be any happier. Great service great product .
B008HBM3R2|1|Tried this twice, was never able to assemble with the tools provided.
B00009PGNR|5|Love this for traveling!
B00CRYMQLI|5|good
B00K8GFINA|1|it sucks. save your mney
B002XEKDBW|5|Works well.
B001TFE38A|4|Still early, but after a month of applying this stuff as instructed, nothing but a quick squirter of spray detailer and even baked on bird poop comes right off!  I'll be sure to follow up with a complete review when I've got a little more time under the sun with Jet Seal.
B00BD4SKY0|4|Fits perfect
B002E5FOTQ|5|A breath of fresh air - literally!  I got this air filter for my 2011 Nissan Versa as the cabin air smelt bad and was really bothering me every time I got in my car.<br /><br />I definitely liked the frustration-free packaging and placing the new filter side by side with my old one the, difference was amazing.  The new one was gleaming white and the with the filth that had accumulated on the old filter, it was no wonder the air in my car smelt so bad.<br /><br />It maybe could have come with better instructions, but I guess every car is different and it's easy to find a video to follow on YouTube for your specific model of car.<br /><br />If you are tired of musty old air in your cabin, it may be time to replace your cabin air filter, and this one does the job perfectly - just check if it's the right one for your car.
B00DXOFS3E|4|Little too small
B00I2504EW|5|They look great! The installation was a breeze and they look great on my black Toyota Tacoma. It keeps the area free of scratches that are caused by openening the door on the daily bases, those scratches add up but with these protectors they keep the vehicle out of harms way. I definitely recommend them!
B00YG02Q1Q|5|Very effective.  I pulled my thermostat first, added product , flushed as usual. Did a great job. Replaced thermostat. Added coolant , returned vehicle to service. i used this product because of RP's past performance and reputation.  I was worried about an inferior product damaging my aluminum radiator.  This product left my cooling system in top shape for the Arizona summer
B00MA4MP4S|5|Just as described. Quick shipping
B00NKUEUQW|5|Good fit, Great parts!
B004QMXTHE|4|Didn't need it after all but will keep it as I'm sure we will need it sooner or later as it is for our water heater.
B0049MXJA8|5|Excellent quality and near impeccable installation instructions. I was very impressed with this company. They actually have a schematic of the car make and model, and detailed specific directions. I wish all manufactures cared this much about technical writing and the customer's success. It was almost shocking.
B002P8L8XI|5|Same as the other review I left. Solid mirror great price and satisfaction
B00S0JSQY0|5|I've been looking for a great dash camera for a long time and came across this product. I was actually looking for something that I didn't have to worry taking it off when I'm not driving. This product is great because it simply looks like a rear-view mirror and you don't have to worry about thieves stealing it. The quality of the footage is great and memory card slot is very easy to access (it's located on the top). Also, it is very easy to install and uninstall the product on the rear-view mirror. One thing I regret before purchasing this product would be doing more research about the size of my vehicle's rear-view mirror and what the camera would be staring when it's mounted on. I drive a Chevy Tahoe and my rear-view mirror is huge and something is blocking the vision of the camera (inside the 2015 tahoe, front of the rear-view mirror there's a huge box looking material on the windshield). However, later I found out that you could actually adjust the camera angle without moving your rear-view mirror. I strongly recommend this product!!
B002V0LG2S|4|Love them, very sharp, took about an hour to install after an hour of matching the hardware. Recommendation, take the time to match the bolts, nuts, flat washers and lock nuts. There are various sizes with very subtle differences. I did have to buy 2 more washers which was a little frustrating, but not a big deal. Once that was done, installing the brackets and the bar itself was a breeze.....
B00KLFJ5SW|5|These worked great and the setup instructions were perfect.
B00KMBM8NY|5|Super fast delivery. Sounds mean, deep, and throaty!
B000TV59EC|5|works great
B00M1Y3NL6|5|Approved by Chrysler at the best price around.... Cheaper than Walmart! Arrived in a sealed Havoline case safe and sound.
B0023VGRAG|5|ALL GOOD
B008S28R98|4|Works well...wish there had been directions for placing remote into the sleeve.  Turns out that you simply force the remote through one of the tiny holes!  Who knew?
B00GSAUHB8|5|Great shade.. Highly recommend it
B000FCGR0U|5|Fits like a glove, a well made one.
B007HO5AFC|2|Not the proper size. Smaller then I needed.
B007L2JNT4|5|These towing mirrors fit like a glove!  They are good quality and come with a carrying bag that has separate pockets for each mirror.  They install easily and work very well.  There is little to no movement of the mirror when going down the road, unlike some of the other strap-on type of mirrors.  When they are installed, you can't really tell they are not part of the factory mirror.  Very definitely recommend these to others looking to spend a fraction of the cost of permanently installed tow mirrors.
B00N301134|1|Terrible product. Not even worth the dollar i paid at dollar tree,That speaks for itself.
B002OPZHAM|5|perfect part
B000E28N9Y|5|BIKE IS RUNNING GREAT
B00HWIEO6E|1|High drove, received dented, has sprung a couple leaks within a year.
B002MDHECA|5|Just the right size for getting into some small areas.  Block is small enough to comfortable hold and use with control.
B00301CF18|5|work very good not issues at all
B005ZHD640|5|All Wizards products are great!
B001MXL71A|3|JUST OK......ATTACHMENT TIP IS DIFFICULT TO ATTACH
B00GR2W6CU|5|Very nice
B00SLT90CQ|5|Looks great, very bright, easy install!
B00FNZAPW0|5|just as described fast shipping
B00JBJ3QAW|4|these fit good.  i was satisfied with the price.  i assumed these came with bulbs but they did not.  no big deal though with the savings.  seem to be of good quality.  will work fine on a rebuilt car for a first time driver.
B00QFY2BCK|5|Great product!!! Cleared up the yellowish color on the head lights that were dull and had poor lighting; now they look like new.
B0008FUHWI|5|Worked like a charm during its maiden voyage, and for only a few dollars more than what it would have cost to rent one through U-Haul; and I get to keep this one. Ha-ha..
B0068BZRR6|5|750 miles so far and no signs of wear!
B00JQ7V49Y|4|I used this with a software called nissan datascan. Once i selected the correct and slowed it down to 4600 it conects easily and seems to work well. Again this is for a nissan not a VW.
B010THNN2A|5|It's awesome. Great construction and great finish.  Install took about 25 minutes (2 beers)
B008G2KXII|5|These lights made the car look like new. The lights came quickly and installed just as fast.  One of the adjustments, on the new set (like a ball and socket) was out of place, a little pressure and it popped back into position. After removing the old headlamps I noticed that the original lamps, ball and socket adjustment had also popped out of place. So, to me, these new headlamps were OEM but more reasonably priced
B00B21R0TA|3|I bought a pair of these projectors after seeing the good reviews. They are cheaper than the morimotos so i can not expect them to perform better than those. That aside i wanted to say that the cut off isnt as sharp compared to the second pair i ordered. The second pair is way more sharp and has the blue cut off while the first one has a very soft cut off and its a yellow color. Can't do much now since the headlights are all sealed. One more thing the piece that holds the projector lens went to gloss black color to a matte/satin color. Those are the ones with the nicer cut off and they also changed the screws that hold the clip for the bulbs. First pair had very small screws which made it very difficult to remove without stripping. The newer pair has bigger screws but they also hit my hid bulb.
B00ROS4GOC|5|A high quality product and much less expensive that the OEM version. Easy to install, look great, and solid construction! A great buy and very fast delivery!
B006C1NTEU|5|Installed this a year ago. Still good.
B00EZNDS5C|5|I haven't crash tested it but I feel safer doing down hill in 661 gear it's light and durable feeling  all my friends always compliment on it. The air flow is nice way better then my last helmet.
B007PRPY70|5|Great harness to keep small children safe on the ATV.  Holds the child secure so that you can use both hands to control the machine.  Would recommend for safety.
B00DYPISOI|5|thank you
B00MF7M6CQ|5|Had it in for about two weeks. Works perfectly I recommend this. And also a pigtail. was way easier than the stock one to screw in.
B00P2D3W1Y|5|great, great, great inversion for my trunk!
B000C8ZG2W|3|Good quality (thick pipe) but the hanger was about 8 inches away from where it is for the factory mount, I just cut the one I had on my frame and rewelded it so it lined up.
B0065V1CNW|3|Didn't fit my truck so I'm giving it a three start rating because I didn't get to use it. Luckily Amazon's customer service refunded my order full.
B00498KQCG|3|Awesome mirrors,  however the heated doesn't work that great and the driving in wet or snow conditions the water/dirt wraps around onto the mirror making it difficult to see. I do like the look and the led lights. It was all worth it
B00KZ53BDS|1|I got this for my 7 year olds room and I couldn't wait for it to arrive. It took my husband 2 hours to transfer this decal to the wall. The vinyl clung to the backing and no matter what we did it wouldn't come off, so my husband has to transfer it piece by piece. I was hoping the vinyl wouldn't be as shiny and plastic looking (cheap)...overall not happy with it. I will actually be taking it down soon and replacing the space on the wall with artwork instead.
B009EU5ZMK|5|After a friend had an expensive portable shortwave radio knocked off into the floor, the front buttons no longer function.  We discovered the problem to be that three out of  six internal injection-molded plastic posts, securing the case back to the front via screws, had snapped off.  After reading several reviews, I decided to give this stuff a shot.  In this case, I determined the broken portions to be adequately rough, so did no sand-papering or rotary brushing.  I just mixed the weld, aligned each post, and temporarily clamped it with a spring-clamp.  Twenty-four hours later, lateral force would not break those posts loose, so I reassembled the case, and everything worked fine because those posts held fast!
B004OI21LK|5|Perfect replacement for a 1997 Coleman Popup Trailer. Note; This mount uses the original mounting that is welded to the trailer by removing the big<br />snap ring on the old unit.
B004GCPLXE|1|This replacement mirror did not fit properly. Let me explain:<br /><br />One corner where the mirror is to sit against the window trim does not line up with the OEM version. Yes I could force screw it in, but it will damage the window strip. I don't know how the manufacturer missed this crucial step and I don't know how other people installed it, but I would stay clear from this model. Do yourself a favor and get a TYC or Dorman replacement.
B001VUFDVY|5|fabulous...use as a bar cart in our outdoor kitchen
B009CXLYA6|5|Great.....Could have been about an inch larger.
B004K77TEO|5|Previous one I bought, branded through Cornwell, lasted 8 years!
B00AVM3WX4|5|Its O2C as described. Thank you.
B008Z9H1BO|5|No problems.  Fits great and feels good.
B000AS3D3S|5|Delivery was fast and part same as you get at any dealership.
B0018EV8QW|5|Excellent windshield. Its well worth the $$$.
B000CMJ1VU|4|The product was new but the box / GRANT box looked beat up.
B00JA3BMDW|3|Not really true to temp.
B00NIWIV6W|5|Installed in 10 minutes and looks perfect. The finishing touch for the truck..
B000IYSHY4|5|couldn't believe how cheap. direct plug-n-play.<br />Cant believe I waited to so long to replace
B0091KCH6U|5|Used in my RVs throttle body.  Got me 2mpg which is HUGE in an rv
B002NSGMHM|5|I use this as my third brake light on my Jeep Wrangler.  I didn't know if I needed more, but this was bright enough by itself.
B0038AX7Z4|5|1st set I received went out about 1 month after install. Called and had replacement set sent and received them the day after I called. Great service. So far I have had them in for a couple of months and all is well. Great looking lights.
B00YI3IGA6|4|So far so good. The shadesox were a little small for our SUV, GL450 rear passenger window. The shadesox fit well all around but was about 1/2 short on covering the entire window to the bottom. Aesthetically, this isn't ideal but doesn't hurt the function of the shade.<br /><br />This works as described. My twins don't complain about the sun being in their eyes. The pull down, suction shade I used previously didn't cover the entire window and always fell down mid ride! This led to lots of complaining from the kids.  The added plus of the shadesox is that I'm able to roll the windows down for fresh air.<br /><br />Overall, great product. I just hope it lasts. I'll update on durability in a few months.
B003CVPPFY|4|Just what we needed to fix our boat trailer
B0068ESUJ0|4|I haven't used this outside yet, but it fits perfectly.  It works best if you put antenna through designated spot first, and then place over bike.  It comes with it's own storage bag. Small enough to carry on bike without taking up an entire compartment. You need a bungee cord to connect  pull down in center of cover, where pegs have been replaced by floor boards in this model. If quality stands up to use, it's a five star. I bought this for 2014 Spyder RT limited.
B00P2AO16C|5|Great price , appears to be good quality , fast shipping
B0051XCM0C|4|Good kit. Used it to troubleshoot AC compressor on boat. Wish it had more dye for one specific use instead of 3 different ones.
B00XRBVRME|1|Poor quality I haved for 3 days and after that dont work any more so dont waste your money
B00GBQYJYU|5|Works!
B0002SR7TM|5|If you need an oil drain buy this one made in the USA very good quality.
B00LNOK4E4|3|THese are installed, but the factory lights seemed brighter. When these are on at night, they are not as bright as the factory hologens that were replaced. I am looking forward to the long life of the LED, but wish they were brighter.
B000BO9L00|5|I like 3M products. Sometimes they're a little more expensive than the &#34;off-brands&#34;, but its usually worth the extra money for the better quality.
B001EP0GOK|5|The Curt Class 3 receiver 13424, Fit my 2013 Chevy Traverse LTZ perfectly. Holes all lined up spot on. I was even able to use my hitch cover. The hardest part was getting the 2 years worth of rust out of the pre-tapped holes from GM (GM put the threaded holes in place for a hitch/towing package but the car was ordered without that package so the holes/ taps just started to rust from water and salt exposure). This thing worked great for my Traverse. The only thing that would make it better is if the bolting hardware was stainless steel, which I did make a trip to my local bolting specialist store and bought. In Curts defense and the reason I still gave a 5 star, is because I have never seen any hitch come with stainless bolting hardware.
B00D42AFS8|1|Terrible quality. Not at all what I expected.
B007Y55806|4|I put this in my 2004 Civic Si hatchback. It definitely fits almost perfect to the windshield, covering all the way from the edge of the dash to my headliner. The slit for the mirrors is a little narrow which makes it a pain to put on without knocking your mirror around. It does allow it to blcok almost all light from the windshield, though. Definitely better than those universal cheap, off the shelf sun shades. Worth the money if you live anywhere hot and sunny most of the time where tinted windshields are illegal.
B000WEPI4M|3|Didn't stay put in my car, but I made it work with sticky velcro. Not an optimal choice, since the larger cups tended to tip over, and smaller cups slid around in the holder... but it worked for six months while I was driving a beater with no cup holders.
B00T66CWQ4|5|Perfect fit for our daughters key!!  She loves it!!
B00TS9ZYWI|3|so far so good
B001G6N0TK|5|This item was an exact fit for my 2005 C55 AMG. Appearance and quality were very similar to the OE item that I removed.
B002M2MMXM|5|I used this on my 2005 Honda Accord. I verified the gap with the filler gauges and they are good. The package comes with 4 spark plugs and the quality is good. I guess I didn't change the spark plug since 206,000 miles and I can definitely tell the performance is so much better once I changed to these puppies. I plan to keep get these for my high mileage car.
B00HLV12MQ|5|I received the package as promised and I feel the size is just about right! My size is about 59-60cm so I decided to go with size M as suggest in size chart. It's a little tight when I first try on but it losses a little after couple try. I am wearing it everyday now and it fits no problem! I wasn't paying attention but I thought the tinted visor goes with the helmet so I was surprised when i opened the package since it came with clear visor. I had to buy a tinted one (a little less than $50) in a local shop. Other than that I am happy with my purchase.
B00N463A2W|1|$23 for cheap plastic. The flag is a sticker too. Not worth the money.
B001G6MZKA|4|This arm was an exact OEM replacement for the control arm on my 2005 C55 AMG. The appearance and perceived quality were very similar to the item that I removed from the car. I would have given it five stars but it was missing a replacement nut for the ball joint end. Mercedes advises that their suspension fasteners are single use so this meant a trip to the dealer to buy a new nut. Curiously the Lemforder torque strut (found elsewhere) which is also part of the front lower suspension was supplied with new nuts.
B002XL2IEA|5|I use this to blow out my under ground sprinklers in the winter
B0006JLSNI|5|Just what I needed.
B00IX23ZFO|4|EZ install, noticed a lil power upgrade.
B0001EWLNY|4|Great quality item. Fits 2003 Ford Escape. There's a different wind sounds at fast speed on the windshield when installed.
B001CH984O|3|Limited functionality, capable making only minor program changes.
B00SXKU6BM|5|Arrived as promised,we are now enjoying our decals.
B00SUTHIVM|5|I love it! It's everything promised! It fits the cargo tray in my small suv, it doesn't slide around & the color is great! Thanks!!
B00EA0ZB7I|5|these things are awesome!!! super bright and sturdy!!! mounted them on my bass boat and they light up the whole bank during mooring operations.
B000NSL9PY|5|So far working great
B0031HQ206|5|Great product
B00QKR2HQM|5|Very well built.
B00KBLWGWI|2|The mud shield doesn't sit flush against the switch
B00VF2IC9I|4|[[VIDEOID:be3a91a45a370accc58b3ec72a7d569e]] .<br />It has enough juice to start a medium-large car engine, no problem. (Mine is a 4.0 Liter V6.)<br /><br />I also use it inside my camper van as a 12-volt power supply for lighting and a fan. Works well (see below).<br /><br />There are over a dozen brands on amazon that are nearly identical to this model, so you can shop around. Those that look identical to this model may have minor differences in the carrying case, connectors provided, emergency light features, etc. The 4 \\"clones\\" I tested all seem to have come from the same factory because they have so many details in common. The HyperPS brand does not appear in the user guide, packaging, etc. Sticker-branding.<br /><br />This model claims to have 20,000 mAh of energy storage, while the other \\"clones\\" I tested are only 16,800 mAh. I'm not sure how this works, since the 16,800 mAh clones I've tested have the same size and weight as the Hyper PS. I have not yet done a capacity test.<br /><br />Li-Ion batteries don't like heat.

B00G6IJFJ2|5|So I used this product on my car after watching some videos on YouTube on how to use it. Gotta say this stuff looks pretty sweet in my mustang. I made it black and green. The green really pops out. I had no trouble with the spray nozzle and it didn't clump. I'd recommend this product.
B00480GZ6G|5|The bulbs appear to be the originals used in my 2008 VW Passat. Those lasted a long time compared to the common brands found at adv auto parts shops.
B0024E6QX0|5|The work good
B00OYEL2MS|5|Just as expected .Worked out great to get this older car rolling again. quick delivery
B00KTHY3F2|1|Bought this to replace a broken Toyota key fab case. Internal layout did not match the one it was designed to replace. Was even informed that it would be an exact match, in which it definatly was not.
B0006IX7TW|5|Miracle worker. Evenly distributes cold in my camper fridge. Recomend!
B0002KKTR2|5|Excellent deal on the leader in thread lock.
B00VU0WK5M|5|Good
B00LBAC5S8|5|First let me tell you that after receiving this product which we are extremely pleased with I never thought to check out the actually company until I read the papers that came with it. Go to www.spiderwebshade.com !! They have thousands of happy customers with pictures and they do custom images on your shade! Wish I had known this before but still love what we have! And didn't realize the shade came in colors!!! prices are the same on the website bc it's an independent company of &#34;jeep owners who wanted a solution&#34;. but way more options on the web site!<br /><br />This was the first accessory we have bought for our 2014 JK 4 door. We have leather seats and it gets hot with all tops off. And having it parked at work with no tops on was I concerned about the sun beating down on the seats. So looking for something like this ... And loved how it looked cleaner and sportier than other brands. And thank you!!!! To the reviewer that posted the pic of a jeep with small shades in front and back!! It looked so much better than the larger version covering the middle bar! Bought 2 small ones for an early bday for the hubby they weren't prime so it said it would take a week. Order them in the wee hours on Friday morning and delivered Monday!! Impressed!<br /><br />The web site and or YouTube gives you tutorials for the very easy 20 minute installation. Test drive approved! It cut out the beating heat from the sun and wind noise! Such a great investment! And so glad I didn't buy one of the other brands!! Will purchase future products like half door shades !
B003BZD08U|5|Works
B006CRT72W|5|Worked perfectly for my f150 '02. Simple instructions.
B000C7UMJ0|5|Exactly was described!
B0012TTAIQ|4|Works well. More than I needed.
B007H9D5OK|5|I could not be happier with this starter (so far).<br /><br />I was nervous because the cost seemed too good to be true but it arrived promptly and just happened to bolt on to my generator while the generator was still in place in the compartment. No need to remove it. I'm a little nervous about the plastic gear but the old original starter from Onan had a plastic gear also, although that is the reason I had to replace it. It did last 16 years though.
B002XUXUTS|5|Works good and was easy to install. Has already saved me from backing up into a brick pillar.
B00KTHYDA2|5|I bought a set for my newly-purchased 2002 4Runner and they work just fine.  No trouble matching them with the car.

B000BUU5Y0|3|Im sure these would have worked well for most campers, but for some reason my wheels are spread out more and these didnt work at all for me. MEASURE YOUR WHEELS before buying this. Do not assume you have a standard gap like I did.
B0019C185E|5|Looks great fit right on
B000IZ5DM2|4|Came to me quick and plugged right in... Easy work
B0074OL2I4|5|As described
B0000AY50X|5|Good stuff the local boat repair shop used and recommended to me. I get many compliments that my 6 year old fiberglass boat looks almost like new. It is worth my time and investment to apply this.
B00BJ4EFXE|4|Excellent replacement. Great value compared to GM dealer pricing.
B0083SL8MU|4|a little smaller than expected but good quality
B008Z265D6|5|Worked out great
B004JVHWO8|4|Everything good in time delivery and the product...
B0054S5LKM|4|Purchased this and paired it with an HVLP spray gun. Works well, adjusts easily and seems accurate. Deducted a star because it does not have a locking mechanism for the pressure adjust valve.
B00D6R5VQW|5|Great Value. Tried to order through a Mazda Dealer. It was going to be 3 times the price
B00ZZO0LAA|5|Clearly met expectations.  easy to install, very bright.  glad to get rid of old incandescent bulbs....
B000LG9AXQ|5|excellent fix
B00UYMRNOU|2|These lights are only 4-1/2&#34; I needed 5&#34; ones like the description says. So I had to return them.
B006H8OV36|4|I like but top corners hangs down some for my truck but each vehicle is different and don't really Matter longs it's covering your dash
B00390BS7C|5|If you are doing an 02 sensor replacement just buy this thing.  You probably don't have a 7/8&#34; open ended wrench and using an adjustable can be difficult because of poor access to the 02 sensor.  The part is high quality solid metal and hooks up to a standard 3/8&#34; socket wrench.  It has a cut out in the side to allow the sensor wire to run through the middle of the offset puller.  It took some seriously elbow grease to wrestle out the old sensor and this gave me the leverage I needed to break the 02 sensor free with out bustin' my knuckles.  I'm glad I bought it.
B001EOWPOA|5|Perfect!
B00FY80OFO|5|Best price with quick shipping. Working good so far for about 2 months.
B00032K50U|1|Do not buy.  First one I used broke in half.  Not worth the money.
B00C5RBRA8|5|My wife can not stop this hose up!!! That is saying allot!!! Best crap hose ever... works great and does not kink..  Great quality.
B0024NSMBU|5|Fantastic! Can't beat the price! Easy to install... just watch the YouTube link that everyone is recommending. Our 2003 Camry LE had foggy and broken headlights. Now they are new and sparkly! Prompt shipping, excellent customer service.
B002DZJQ0A|5|Got it quickly, mounted the ipass right away and it's still holding.
B003IS3HV0|5|Wow, this is great stuff. It IS as thick as honey.  You know how would you feel if you lost your most-favorite jacket — ever?  I didn't lose it.  I let an idiot dry-cleaner use harsh chemicals on it to &#34;clean&#34; it.  Those toxic chemicals just destroyed what had been a wonderfully supple leather jacket. It was a ~very~ expensive &#34;bomber&#34; jacket my soon-to-be wife bought for me in Italy.  Just beautiful.  It was the most-favorite thing I'd ever owned.  But after that dry cleaner on Federal Hill in Baltimore finished with it, it crackled like a piece of tin.  I wanted to cry.  My beautiful leather jacket... really was no longer was even LIKE leather.  More like something plastic.  I was heart-broken. Kicking myself. How stupid of me to hand it to some hole-in-the-wall drycleaner.  I chalked it up to experience... and put it away for the last 20 years.  But then I saw this product:  &#34;Leather Honey Leather Conditioner&#34; on Amazon with 2,000+ favorable reviews. Less than $20.  What the heck.  Thought I'd take a chance.<br /><br />It's BAAACCCKKKK, baby!  My beautiful leather jacket is back.  I will _never_ dry-clean it again.  I can't recommend this product too highly.  I've now purchased a 2nd bottle. It just arrived.  I'll use it to keep my 15-year old leather sofas in like-new condition.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:  Buy this!  They've figured out how to put magic in a bottle.
B0073HLC32|5|Very good product and on time delivery
B00NP61VDQ|4|Since it is summer, I have not used this scraper yet but it seems to be of good quality!
B003LDPDNM|5|Works great, and fit perfectly.  It's so funny to see a trail hitch hanging off the back of my Road King.  And it gives me a real solid feel actually pulling a trailer!
B0084JN3VC|3|Not a perfect fit but just a little modification
B004P23X6W|4|Very nice, but need better instructions.
B00T3W3FB2|4|The vacuum has a good seal on the front brake nipples of my motorcycle. It would not get a good seal for the rear nipple. And none of the adapters would fit it. Tried thread sealant and plumbing tape, but no luck. Had to go back and properly bleed it.
B010VUZDC8|5|Love it!!🚙🚗🚘
B000F5HV0W|1|There is nothing heavy duty about this. It will not bend the hollow steel tubes I bought it for, not even close. It will bend soft copper. It doesn't feel solid, I am certain it will break in half after another few bends. I have no confidence in this tool.
B00ACGI1GW|5|Is very good. I like.
B0002NIK3E|5|Great cover. Already had several compliments. Fit 15 inch trailer tire perfect
B000765E08|5|Perfect fit, had it on in about 20 minutes.  All the hardware was top notch, grade 8 bolts / nuts.  Very handy little &#34;fish wire&#34; for placing the bolts into the rectangular tubing frame of the vehicle.
B004RZU3Q0|5|Easy to install, works well, excellent replacement for an older electric bulb system<br />It works!
B00HFL5RIM|5|I ordered a/c lines 'for my step daughter's,who is working and going to college, car which kept  leaking freon out. No one could find leaks,using leak detectors, dyes and so on,because it would work fine for about a week or less.Best price I found was from Amazon Received by UPS in 3 days, fit was perfect. Put it on, evacuated system and recharged it. Now its been over 5 weeks and still puts out REAL COLD AIR, 42 degrees out of center vent. This was a great product had all the connector for gages , with o'rings and seals and ect...I've ordered other products from them 'THANKS Amazon' for being there when I needed you..
B000CMHU1S|5|Husband loved them!
B000CB7DWK|5|High value, quality.  Mann is always dependable.
B0012BL8LG|5|works great
B001V8PRBM|5|I had the smaller, red, ones.  Decided I wanted a little bigger ones.  Work great.
B003SG7PU6|1|It wasn't what I expected it to be it didn't fit & the back seat cover zipper was ripped
B00T9AGBOQ|3|[[VIDEOID:cf864816ff8550033c472c4b718bcd9f]] .<br />It has enough juice to start a medium-large car engine, no problem. (Mine is a 4.0 Liter V6.)<br /><br />You can also power 12-19 volt devices, including laptops.<br /><br />There are dozens of similar models on amazon in the 12000 to 20000 mAh range, so you can shop around.<br /><br />Compared to 4 other models I tested, this BOX21 model had a lot of small annoyances and disappointments that may or not bother you (see below). But everything works, and I like the 12-16-19 volt output for devices, which some other models lack.<br /><br />Nice price when selling for $50.<br /><br />Li-Ion batteries don't like heat. I would definitely not keep this in my trunk. And even keeping it in your car could ruin the battery over time if you do a lot of outside parking in warm weather.<br /><br />PROs:<br /><br /> - Works as described<br /> - It looks and feels like good quality<br /> - Compact.

It's something like 4.75mm/1.70mm.<br /> - Even with the included adapter tips, you can't power the popular 5.5mm/2.1mm male cable. You have to buy or make an adapter.<br /> - The port- and button-labels are hard to read.<br /> - Port covers for Input, 12-16-19 volts Out, and USB-out are kind of a hassle to open.<br /> - AC adapter is clunky and blocks other outlets vs a slim sideways-mount adapter.<br /> - Comes with Micro-USB cable (others include 4-way cable...Lightning, 30-pin, etc.)<br /> - The main power switch is a button vs a slider switch.

B00BVB5V0Q|1|Switch worked perfectly on my 2004 Chevy Venture for one month and then stopped working with the passenger window in the down position. It was easy to change with a quick YouTube video and a little research. It is a slight lighter color then the original but does not make that much difference to me.
B0068EP56G|5|Great fit although I wish it had been made a bit clearer in the description that I needed the Disc Cover Mount to make it work.
B00J4TX59Q|4|This is a fun little scooter and runs way better than expected for the low price.<br /><br />It arrives about 85% assembled. The assembly DVD did not  work in my laptop or bluray player so we had to consult YouTube. The videos were fairly easy to follow. Un-crating takes about 30-45 minutes and getting put together and running takes about 90 minutes after that. This scooter would be very easy to put together for the mechanically inclined. We ran into a few hiccups but it started right up and we cruised it the same day it arrived.<br /><br />There were a few scratches from shipping but no major damage. The battery needs to be filled with acid and that was a bit of a mess. Also, our fuel line was not connected and the fuel gauge didn't work straight away,hence the 4-star review. The idle  needed to be adjusted and an oil change is in order when you receive it according to the guides.<br /><br />All things considered it looks and runs great! The trunk and helmet compartment are, as to be expected, a bit rickety. The plastic is super cheap, but it is a super cheap bike! For a tool-around-the-city no-frills fun scooter, this cannot be beat. Overall very happy with purchase.
B00FJODJGE|5|The Door Sill Trim Plates give a finished look for my Mazda3.  These are OEM parts; are easy to install and look great.
B000FPZSOS|5|Fit perfect.
B000CISLUG|5|Great set of mirrors work great for the money, we use for a pickup camper, they have a little vibration, but for the money will stick with these,
B000M5WT16|3|good for only 1 use.  plastic pins used to straighten metal fins.
B007IW0FHG|4|(used in the Bandit 1200)<br />After 115 MPH TOPCASE works as a wing (rear wheel is unstable) %) + passenger needs ;)<br />TOPCASE better use with metallic platform (for baggage more weight )<br />installation of additional parking light was difficult.<br />however, for this price very good
B00B966FA8|5|I've used this product to stop leaks for many years and it is the only one that works for me.
B000C2UVRI|4|Seems to work as it should, but time will tell.  My only complaint, if you want to call it that, is that there is no input/output designation and I'm told that the input is the long (bottom) end.  Of course, I installed it backwards because it was easier for my particular installation.
B004O844DS|1|This saddles do not fit under the front crossbar of a 2015 Subaru Outback. We had to rig it to secure it to the crossbar. Hopefully it won't come off during our vacation but we have little choice but to find out as we leave tomorrow. Additionally, the original box came without nuts and bolts so we had to rush a replacement. And on the replacement the Allen wrench destroyed/stripped the bolt head after only mild tightening. Finally, the instructions are terribly written. They misuse nomenclatures (two items listed as part #5 for example).  Here's hoping we don't lose our luggage on our trip.
B0101SLT5U|5|Fits around push-to-start perfectly and stays
B0024ECD2I|5|Fit perfectly!
B001N07J14|3|Fitting is good for 2012 Dodge Challenger.  One complaint about this product.  The tape is white with smoke covers.  So you can see the tape through the covers.
B0076D5OI2|1|I had to make spacers between fuel pump and  mounting point in order to fit. It doesn't fit like the original factory pump. The spacers were 1/2&#34; thick. That is not a miner adjustment.
B00MFCX9AY|5|Great! Thanks.
B007CC1Z7Q|1|Had these for a year now... not water tight and the LEDs are already going out in them. Look for other options...
B007JSGR9Y|5|nice for the $$
B000C7QGEU|3|Item is damaged, they at least put the broke part in a little plastic bag for me to deal with. The radiator is bent at the drain and the drain doesn't seal properly. There are bugs in it like they pulled off a car capped the holes and thrown in a box and sent to me. Its got rust and oxidation on it. All of this I have taken photos of for proof. The one good thing is that it is a direct drop in for my old radiator. O and well they did get it here in one day as promised. It is probably a re-manufactured radiator but they don't put that in their description.<br /><br />I will update this if all goes well after install
B00P9QKPEG|5|Works well
B00HJ6O4A0|5|Love the colorful look of this mat.  Perfect for the beach, park, or even as a patio mat.  Easily stored in your trunk or under a seat.  There is pocket storage on both sides when folded.  The price was less than paying for a patio mat of this size for your camper.  It's hard to believe it folds up to the size of a small cushion.
B0007TQWME|4|break easily sometimes but work
B0069TND14|5|as advertised and speedy delivery!
B00GSNAS1Y|1|No good. Because only use for one week. Because no good. I can use.
B0012TRK9M|1|Installed, and doesn't work. Won't complete the circuit unless I pull down on the key.  I would have saved time by throwing it straight in The trash.
B001OE2842|5|Excellent quality very elegant
B00HWS7XGW|5|These are Fantastic!!  I had my doubts with the designs but after installing I could not tell a difference between stock, and the Phillips LED.  No shadows or dark spots in the light fixture.  I installed them in my 2003 Toyota Tacoma. These bulbs are heavier that sock or other LED  1157 bulbs.  They have massive (for the size of the bulb) heat sinks and should be more reliable.  I did pull the stock bulb and put in a LED bulb to compare and there is no difference.  After dealing with the Chinese LED vendors and their reliability issues I am more than happy to try a NAME Brand light and looking forward to finally having a reliable light. that last more than a year and to have a company that has a great reputation to protect (unlike some of the other vendors who sell here)
B008CQR8B8|5|This was for our son's boat and it worked well.  Arrived on time and was in great condition.
B00NF1PT8O|5|Good quality pan great price would recommend to anyone.
B006X8AK3K|4|Came bent
B0085NS538|5|Nice product, fit, style, ease of install.
B007EXO3V8|5|Just like the original.
B000C9GR7Y|5|It worked. 1999 olds intregue
B005HIOMVI|4|Rack worked well. Slight wobble but otherwise fit easily into to hitch mount.  Easily assembled but must leave all nuts loose while assembling and tighten after completely together.  Recommend gooseneck to keep elevated above exhaust.
B000786JRI|1|did not last very long
B004TXS0SS|5|perfect fit for my roof rack.
B010JRH4CK|5|Excellent product fits perfectly. .installed it the same day it came in ..went thru quick quack car wash and it was still intact ... I like the mugen styling it has ..quality products. No cheap plastic here .. quality 3M tape gives it's a strong hold.. for the price you pay its the best BANK for you buck ... I  am honestly impress how great the product turned out for the price I paid ..
B003TU7L0U|5|Very easy to work with. Only done the trunk of my FRS so far and my GF commented &#34;why is the car quieter?&#34; without knowing I had done anything to reduce road noise.<br /><br />I have not used half of the 25sq ft yet. Rest will go into the doors I suspect.
B000ZLSF74|1|First time I used it the handle broke right off, I hadn't used it more then a few hours.  Very disappointed, returned for a refund.
B000GTX8R2|5|Direct swap for my OEM rear sprocket.  Went on easy and rode 100 miles on it the next day without issues.  Pairs nicely with the JT front sprocket to make tight trail riding more enjoyable.
B00CFCHT0U|5|Durable
B00V3XFFE4|1|Too Short , came off
B007GENB0Y|5|It fit into my Harley FXR tank gauge hole. its a cheaper option than spenging $400 for the gauge that goes in there.
B0043YIFGU|5|This is as advertised.
B0058TF5V2|5|easy to use, works as advertised.
B0023VIJZ2|5|Got it quickly and it fit great for my 2001 Toyota Camry! Love how easy it was to change out.
B008EMM8ZQ|4|The product was awesome but the who ever delivered it left in the mailbox on a rainy day so the sticker tried to come off the paper and I ordered it for christmas so couldn't apply till summer.  Put on in the summer and it has stuck to the window fine.
B000FQ24AI|5|Exact fit. And arrived quickly
B00CAYB6CA|5|Got them for my husbands birthday for his new 2014 Harley street glide & he loved them!!
B0050ITWCE|4|Good fit arrived in good time undamaged
B00PS5F7FU|3|It was flimsy
B00E1ETJNU|5|Nice, thick metal frame.
B001DBXPQQ|5|Worked perfect on my 86 F150. Even better quality than I expected. I also liked the fact that it came with new fuel line clamp thingy's'.
B00OIC7E6O|5|Did the job
B00JIGZXMC|5|Nice lights!
B00N42XL3Y|5|nice,perfect on my 2008 hammerhead 50cc moped.
B0002Z9NQU|4|I have a 2006 Jeep Liberty (3.7 L V6) and spent so much time researching all over the internet looking for the right muffler.  I wanted something that would sound good but not be obnoxiously loud--especially inside the cabin.  Finally sucked it up, got this one, and had it installed today (everything welded on).  It sounds great!  With the windows up there is a clear difference in the sound (you can tell that it isn't stock) but really only marginally louder.  I drove it home from work (~30 miles), highway and city driving and there was no drone whatsoever, which was my main concern.  Outside of the car is another story.  It isn't obnoxiously loud but it is definitely noticeable, especially at WOT.  While cruising and being easy on the throttle you can keep it relatively silent.  The reason I took a star off is because they didn't have this in stainless steel.  I use my truck as a daily driver and in harsh conditions and lots of use, don't expect this material to last more than 2-3 years before it rusts out.  I doubt there are any performance gains, at least for my jeep but I really bought this to hear/feel the engine a little more and for that I am happy with this product.  For the people looking to buy this but worried that it will be too loud just get it.  Unless your current muffler is silent you will happy with this.  If you are looking to wake up the neighborhood and scare dogs and old ladies in the street then get the super 44 or super 10.  If you want something more aggressive without going overboard get this one.  ***EDIT: I have now driven almost 700 miles with this new exhaust.  It really does sound great.  If you get on the throttle this thing can get pretty loud.  Driving down a city street and punching the gas will turn heads.  I wanted to add something about the drone.  On my Jeep there is a button on the gear shifter to turn off overdrive.  I almost always keep overdrive on unless I really need the full performance of the vehicle.  When overdrive ison and driving between speeds of 0 and 90 mph there is no drone whatsoever and it sounds great in the cabin.  Very quiet.  With overdrive turned off, there is some drone at certain conditions between different speeds.  Nothing crazy and doesn't bother me because if I'm driving with overdrive off I am driving with the intention of performance and want to hear the engine to the fullest.  Just wanted to let people know that may not have the overdrive feature, or constantly turn it off.  I still give the muffler 5 stars for everything except material (hence the minus one).  Just want to make this review as detailed as possible because when I was buying this I couldn't find a lot of the information on things that I was concerned about and this would have made my life easier.  Also, on a side note, on a cold start the muffler has a loud and aggressive tone until the ecu switches over to regular combustion and I think it sounds great.  After the cats warm up the idle is a very quiet low rumble.  Definitely makes the jeep sound like an aggressive light truck.
B0027ACXEW|4|Great price on these compared to auto part stores. They look and feel durable. I hope I can get many miles out of them.
B001OCXI2U|5|Works like a charm,like they were made for the toyato rail system
B003RWYYPK|4|Connected easily to my 2005 Chevy Silverado, and after a month still works perfectly everyday.
B00O4B6YYM|5|Works perfectly as advertised.
B00KTJ2YRY|5|Worked as advertised, but very difficult to find someone willing to cut it. Home Depot and ACE Hardware both sell their own for $70-80, so it makes sense they would not want to do this
B000C9D5JM|5|very good hose..fits ok in my car
B000B66UXE|5|Works and looks great.  For a quick and easy way to remove the old crank https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLweWp72tU<br /><br />put the handle down, take a rag and slide it us between the door and the handle, saw back and forth and it will pop the clip and pull out the handle in less than 5 seconds - no tool needed - not my video - just a good one.
B000C2WF0E|5|Great find
B00FFGR8EU|5|Yes after the thing was fixed I got what I wanted!
B004SSAER4|5|Item fits nicely. Looks sturdy.
B002SE1GFY|5|There are great
B00M1WBUQ8|4|A little short for my needs but only one I could find.  Does the job...
B00BCRMAAS|5|Great Quality for the cost :) I drive a mini van, and I needed car seats desperately. The Oxgord 17pc set was perfect for me. The steering wheel cover keeps my steering wheel cool, and prevents me from burning my fingers in the Florida sun. These covers went on fairly easily, and the material seems to be very durable. I really like the cushion of the seat belt rests, and I may have to order more, because my mini van technically has 5 bucket seats, and 1 bench seat!<br /><br />I really like the black and grey combination, and even ordered the car mats to match! I am definitely going to look into purchasing more bucket seat covers so that my entire van matches!<br /><br />Received at a discount for an honest review.
B000CGAQMY|1|Got a product that wasn't exedy
B00DSVMCQS|5|For the price, you really can't beat this vest. It fit as expected and because of it's plainness, it's able to except any patch you have.
B001P11SCM|5|Easy to install.
B00766QA96|5|Great window sticker. Size is good. Should last a long time.
B00GH3NUSI|5|Love it
B008SEBQ2G|4|I keep my Ram covered during the day so I was always having to remove the factory antenna. Not really a big deal until I lost it (somehow). Decided to try this pricey antenna. It looks way cool on my truck however, the reception is horrible! I read up on it before the purchase so I knew this would be the case. Not a big deal because I listen to satellite radio anyways. But it does look cool!
B0028QGTIG|1|Not my favorite coil spring compressor.  These are very dangerous to use, it released twice while the spring was partially compressed.  I can't recommend this product.
B004AGIY5I|2|Makes the bike looked slammed!!! 5stars for looks. I knew I was going to sacrifice some comfort, but if you weigh more than 215 lbs prepare for a beating!! Seriously!!! If you have any back issues you will pay the price for trying save a few bucks..The first time I rode with these shocks I thought I blew a rear tire!! You will feel every imperfection of the road.. For under $300 I guess that's what you pay for...
B00IITU6GI|4|Great
B000PEPCGI|5|Used it to wet sand my whole car. Perfect size.
B0066SKCP8|5|Fit just like the original.
B00JAO5L88|4|I have two of these helmets...in my opinion these are just what we needed for this price. The fitting guide worked for me but not my wife. We returned the first one (M) for a small and it still ran a little large.
B00HS5WKVC|4|Great
B00JTM9A5Q|4|Fits well
B004AG9ILC|5|This is for cars with the left tab connector, Made prior to 03/06 (Check your drivers door jam for manuf. Date) The unit is exactly the same as the OEM except that it was gray instead of black. Fixed my misfire and it was less than half the price of an off brand and O'Reilly
B00B6DGCOS|5|Works well, easy swap
B0038BBIXQ|5|These fit my truck perfect, in fact they look better than the ones that came with it .They look awesome
B00029J3CU|5|Love the sound of it on my 05 Silverado. Better than the Magnaflow I had on it.
B000CJ71ZG|5|Worked fantastic on my 2005 GMC 2500HD Sierra, it was perfect fit and like described this is the OEM brand for that truck.  You will need to pull a vacuum on the whole system before replacing the refrigerant, but you can borrow a pump from a local auto parts store.
B005SHLYOG|5|Fits perfect!!!
B0031ZDU62|5|Fast shipping and all around great deal. Runs like new
B001DRHMRI|5|This is the filter i use all the time on my high performance bmw.
B008Y9PAVS|5|The best helmet I've owned.
B0030DM8JK|5|Stongarm liftgate arm was easy to install and is working great!
B009DJIZCO|5|cant beat the price . and has given me no issues for 2 motors
B0072J5K34|5|fit my budget and my project
B00651C2E0|5|Easy to install works as advertised
B006G62N3O|5|Very good view
B001HLIMD8|5|Great...
B00OWS4K84|4|It took longer to install that predicted.  Like the price.  Is a nice fit to my truck.
B007ZS99NY|4|Fit my 2013 Hyundai Elantra very well and they look good. I had ordered the matching front bucket seats a year before, and they looked great and held up so well that I decided to order the back seat covers also. I took extra time on the headrests and used safety pins to get a more form-fitting look. The rear seat on my Elantra was a bit difficult to get out. The bench does not just snap out like a lot of cars do, there are two bolts holding it in. I had to move the cover out of the trunk area and tilt the seat forward, and even then it was tight access. Once I got the bench out, installing the seat cover was pretty easy. I cannot access the middle armrest/cupholder that folds down, but that isn't an issue for me as I rarely have backseat passengers. I mostly wanted the covers to protect the seats and have them match the front covers. Price is reasonable. Fit is not perfect, but they are not custom covers so I didn't expect perfection. Anyone who has seen them don't even realize they are covers unless they look closely. Recommend them.
B005NLQAHS|4|I've never used one of these before, so my experience is low. It plugged into my OBD port, and connected to my bluetooth immediately upon pairing. No problems at all. Using the Torque Lite app it appears to function without any problems. The only minor issue I've had is that it is bigger and therefore heavier than some other devices would be. Since the port in my truck faces downward at about a 45 deg. angle, the weight and long lever arm combined with a few miles of rough roads caused the unit to fall out of the connector onto the floor. It needs a clip or something to hold it in if you are going to leave it connected for extended peroids.
B005CLO2RO|3|Unlike the handle it replaced (which broke right at the plastic hook that you know about in this door handle mechanism, if you're looking for a replacement), this door handle is ENTIRELY plastic, which means it might snap or wear out with regular to heavy use.  That's a little disappointing, as of course the product info doesn't list its component materials.  Also, this door handle's internal mechanism was not the same shape as the door handle's it replaced.  This led to some creative monkeying around to get this new handle to fit in the hole in the door - but we persevered!
B003V9L05G|5|Great for the price. Better than I expected!
B004HLWPO2|5|Fits my 2015 trd sport 4x4 perfectly, looks identical to oem as well, which was a concern for me, works as it should.. No alignment issues for me at all. Considering the $270 price tag at the dealership, I think I made the smart choice
B00DGU98VS|5|No problems with this order.
B00T7Q7UHY|5|Looks awesome and is easy to apply. Looks great on a tinted windshield.
B00K889FCI|5|Simply AMAZING!!! I purchased this a few months ago and procrastinated using it because I thought it was going to be a bit of a hassle. I am so silly for not doing it sooner! Did it today and it was so easy I am still in shock. I have gone out to the driveway about 6 times just to gaze upon my brilliant work! This product is fantastic. I am so happy with the results and how easy it was to use... really so easy. Get it.... NOW!!! make sure you FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS and you will not be disappointed! !
B00480GYSA|5|Very bright lights.
B0006PY0J6|5|Looks awesome and works great
B002SZMYNQ|1|Not worth the money!!
B00CLCAUPU|5|A+
B0084H7TX2|5|Looks great after all the removing the Grille & drilling holes W/O the screws. But if you got the time it is worth it.
B0002NIKGQ|5|Muy bueno
B00GSAUHB8|5|Love it! So easy to use and it really has helped keep my car cooler in the 100 degree temps this summer.<br />Great product.
B009X1YYEA|4|would have been 5 stars if the bracket for it would have been made from metal.  ANY type of metal, but they are plastic? oh well.  fits nice and feels good, you can adjust it by sliding forwards or backwards if needed and then tightening the screws that mount them to the brackets.  hope it holds up with those plastic brackets.. the armrest itself is very nice quality and seems more sturdy than the brackets themselves that it attaches to. excellent armrest, but as for the mounting brackets... WTF Misch???
B00PB9AQE0|5|It is a nice product and it does go with the beats...but it seems like it beats to the bass of the sound mostly.
B007MDHK24|1|Mine came in without the hardware and I was unable to use.
B0058O1LHE|5|So far, so good!  Our previous faucet was leaking, so I purchased this one.  It matches nicely with no leaks!  Also, it was very easy to install.
B000CNAV1I|4|great
B00LNDZ9GS|5|Light was delivered on time, great price and quality.
B007W4KJV2|5|Awesome product. I got this to help my 07 wrangler in the power and gas mileage area. It delivered what the description said it would. The installation is simple plug and play. The power and gas mileage increase was noticeable too.  I coupled it with a k&n air intake and a catback exhaust. That's when the real power and gas saving came out. I went from stock 16 mpg to 22 mpg with a lot more power under the hood too. Great product and highly recommend for any jeep owner.
B006GVIWCA|4|Nice looking and work as expected.
B00979OE66|5|They fit great and look awesome on while riding my motorcycle.
B004AIHNM6|2|Bolted right up.  Works as designed. On edit: 2 years later and it has stopped working.  It worked great for a while, but it should last longer than that.
B00D1CQVIY|5|I installed some under truck LED lights.  The switch was too large for my application but all other parts of the harness worked well.  The relay does not like to be controlled by a dimmer switch (it's very noisy), but this was fixed by adding a capacitor across a couple terminals.<br /><br />Bottom Line: I will buy again if I'm ever in the market.
B00I02SVOC|5|look ok I hope
B000FQ1SWI|1|Bought a set of these on May 20th for my Jeep LJ, They are already cracked and broken PURE JUNK Do not buy.
B00067BU1U|5|Very bright, great for hooking up trailers or doing anything behind the truck in the dark.
B007TYCQHU|4|well made and fits the harness well
B007USCM7E|4|So, here's what happened:<br />I used the product according to the directions on my Honda Accord, and it worked beautifully.  The a/c, which wasn't blowing as cold air as it once did, started blowing out ice cold streams.  Great experience!<br /><br />BUT, when I again used the product according to instructions on a much smaller Scion, the pressure in the system never reached the point on the gauge indicating when to stop filling. Eventually, I just stopped filling, but almost too late.  The system had become so pressurized that the compressor failed to turn on again.  The a/c stopped working entirely.  I had to let gas back out of the system on a few occasions when the a/c would just cut out because the compressor would not turn on again due to high pressure.  Luckily, I did this before any lines experienced damage because of the high pressure.<br /><br />In conclusion, it's a great product for medium to large vehicles.  For smaller vehicles though, or maybe just Scions, do not use the gauge to determine fullness.  I would add a bit of gas, stop and test the temperature of a/c, then add more if need be.  I would continue in this fashion until the a/c blows cold, then stop entirely.
B00XULVDHK|5|Great product. Sticks well, blocks the sun, exactly what I was looking for. Jomolly customer service is fantastic. They emailed me just to make sure I got it and was happy with the product. Definitely a good purchase.
B00VQUXXWA|5|With running my own business I am always in the car it seems, and as I don't have a nanny and my child is still too young for school, he is always with me. Many days, as we are driving down the road, here in Florida, the sun gets very bad, and he is always fussing about the sun being in his eyes. So I have been searching for a good sun share that is easy to install. The ones at the discount stores and baby stores, are too hard to get on for a mommy dealing with a young child, these on the other hand were super easy. You can put on the suction cups prior to going out to the car, you get there, stick them on the window and you are done. For a mommy that is very important. And best of all, they work! No more crying because the sun is in his eyes, so it protects him, but he the mesh is thin enough for him to see the sights as mommy drives to our next stop. These are a great deal for a great product. Highly recommend for mom's with children.<br />I was provided a sample for review at a discounted rate and I did not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. I am just a regular Amazon customer who shops a lot on Amazon and enjoys sharing my experiences with others so that they can make an informative buying decision.
B00KTHXZLU|5|Worked just fine.
B008KPYYCW|1|This lasted only a couple of hours before burning out. Pay the extra for a Rick's motorsport and save yourself the hassle of doing it twice.
B00BUS3AKS|5|Good if you have Forester and want to cover your cargo space.<br />I bought 2015 Forester, with as few options as possible, then bought my own accessories.<br />If you go for the dealer way, this will cost like $180 plus tax. You can buy it here for 2/3 of the cost. Such a great way to save money.
B009P7RZUW|1|I read all the reviews before I bought this stopper and ultimately decided to take a chance. I was wrong to do that. I would say that some may have gotten lucky with a stopper that actually stays together, but I did not. The stopper I received was two pieces meant to slide onto each other and fit snuggly enough to remain where you put it. The fit was so loose that it had no hope. Save yourself some time and frustration and buy a different stopper.
B00JP7FQNA|4|The case is good, but the Ring hole inserts are flimsy.  They fall out easily.  The Transponder is not sensed by the Vehicle computer sometimes if you are holding the key tightly when trying to start.  Have to get into a habit of turning the Key with 2 fingers.
B000GU3KHE|2|Had I written this review shortly after purchase, it would have been for five stars. The fabric is lightweight and water resistant, and therefore it dried quicker than my previous heavy-weight cover by the same manufacturer. The fit (medium) was perfect for my Honda NT650 Hawk. However, into the second summer of use the fabric simply deteriorated. The seams loosened and any horizontal surface (sun faded) ripped with only a light tug. So after two summers and one winter the cover is junk.<br /><br />Clearly this product is not UV stable. If you need an occasional-use dust cover - go for it. If you need a true all-season cover - look elsewhere. And, yes, I acknowledge that these things are not meant to last and the price is low, but consumers should expect better.
B005DSTVOU|5|fixed the check engine light problem.
B0071HE2SQ|5|Works great, good for iphone 5s and as an intercom between driver and passenger. Easy to install and operate. I have not made or received any phone calls with it, but it is loud enough as I have bad hearing.
B00PVNSGVQ|5|As described... secure fittings.
B000EDQR50|3|Didn't fit my travel trailer.
B00LU1ZVHK|5|Good
B004I4FXFG|4|Works as expected.
B00I47MMXE|2|Product description said it would work for my Mercury Mountaineer, but did not. Not sure if defective or if product description was wrong. When I went to return it, I could never find the thing!
B001UC3C0M|5|Good purchase. Installed fine and working fine. I put the tire sensors on my 2005 escalade.
B008R15IT2|5|This is a great tool for the price. I had to modify it a bit to make it work, (but I do not blame the tool) do to the inner race worked inward a bit. Just in case anyone else has that happen after purchase of the tool, sand the back side (Flat Side) of the puller plate until it will fit behind the race. Now this is a pressed on race. this tool will remove and install this race. IT WILL REQUIRE FORCE TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN. You will need a couple big wrenches to hold this thing in place. Great tool, Made in the USA.
B00JXS3BXI|5|Good winch for the money nice
B0014HHTHK|5|Works well, like a brake wheel cylinder should!
B001H1MJ6O|5|spending but well made. Easy to install.
B000EQCYD6|4|Got an 01 jeep wrangled, good fit, easy, works... that's all I really needed it for.
B0002KKIU0|5|This is a great product that really works well. Been using it for a very long time now.
B001CEG90I|5|It works great in my Subaru Legacy 2011. It was really easy to change the filter. You just have to drop the glove box, open up the plastic filter cover, and swap the old filter with the new one. The air is very fresh. The filter is much cheaper than the OEM Subaru cabin air filter.
B00NGOQTQG|5|Perfect fit for the 2002 Eurovan Camper.<br />Just a word to the wise. The rubberized backing under the original mirror should not be removed. I peeled it off to ensure a better adhesion only to discover that this backing was electrified with de-icing elements. Just stick the glass on top of this.
B000GTUM9O|5|Nice and easy to install has everything you would need.
B0024E6V30|4|Exactly what we expected.  Double pack and new.
B00DM8NFNQ|1|This item did not fit my emblem on my steering wheel at all. I have 2012 chevy camaro RS
B003E3OG4Q|5|Car look brand new.
B00AHJZBCG|5|This is one bright light for its size! A nice clear beam that clearly lights the way...
B00CWNVAPW|5|Good product. Takes a little time to get used to; seeing more than you do with the stock rear view mirror. Simple installation. Would recommend it to anyone that wants to see more area out of their rear view mirror.
B00LNJI1KI|5|Accurate and quick
B004I0Z9N6|5|Exactly what I needed
B0002V4PRG|5|works well.
B009STHA5W|5|UPDATE: One year later, still works great!<br />Original review: Fits my 1995 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme.  No tools were required to replace this pump in this car (NO need to remove the cross bracing which covers the reservoir; and NO need to remove the reservoir).  Tip: suction out the washer fluid to the pump line (into a clean container for reuse) to avoid a drippy mess. Disconnect the electrical clip connector. Then, simply and carefully, ever so slightly, tip the pump away (1/4&#34;) from the reservoir (from the notch which holds the pump in place) then pull the pump UP and out of the tank. Disconnect the fluid tube. Remove the tank grommet and replace with the new one (included). Reconnect the fluid tube. Then, put a little fluid on the pump stem and reinsert the new pump into the new grommet. Nudge the pump into position against the tank, then push the pump straight down into the grommet to seat the pump fully. Then reconnect the power connector. Works as expected. The GM part was $30 so hoping this lasts.  Will update if/when this pump fails.
B00QMWQK2M|1|This mat suck when you put your feet on it. It moves so u can't move your feet when your drive but u have too
B00OAAWH20|5|I love it.  Very easy to apply.
B0006JLSNI|1|one end of hose wasn't crimped.  not sure if all of them are like that but it's not useable
B00SY2ZAK6|5|Love them!!
B00M8UHSX2|4|Great pegs, just wish they were angled inward a little more. Its a little awkward with it sticking straight out.
B000AUMM1A|5|Looks great on my 08 Civic EX Coupe
B000C9HADE|1|wrong size even thought amazon said it would fit but my car, returned for refund
B00MN963JS|3|I want to like this, but unfortunately it didn't work out for me. I really like the skull design. Also the material is lightweight, so keeps cool, but could also provide warmth. Like other reviewers, I wish the design came up higher to align more with my face. My biggest issue is that I have a small head (I guess) and this is baggy on my face from the first try on. I can knot the material in the back to make it work, but wished it came in a smaller, more snug size for smaller frames. I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.
B008PJDOSS|5|When you install it watch the other guy's video on YouTube not the Ford, one saves 2 hr.
B003X9TLUK|5|it was all that I expected
B009OBVRY4|4|I love the product but don't think you can do big jobs with it. Perfect for those stubborn spots and smaller jobs.Perfect with a right angle CORDED drill.
B00080QHMM|3|Terrible design. Can't read it till you pull it away from the valve. I had a reader that's more flat on the handle. Don't buy if you want to use this on a motorcycle.
B00NPIN8FI|5|They work great as backup lights.<br />If you want LED turn, brake or tail lights, get an LED the same color as the light housing. Trying to use white LED in a red/amber housing does not look good and actually puts out less light than a red/amber LED light.
B00OXZD9F6|5|Perfect
B001TPUCKI|5|Went in easily and works great!
B004WPQZTE|4|Works well, but they need stronger detent spring. They keep getting knocked down by accident.
B0087FJZUQ|3|They are what  I payed  for.
B00KC8JYGQ|5|Ive had these mounted on my ranger for almost a year now. I will buy these again and recommend them to anyone. I have 2 of the rigid industries dually's on my jeep and they are great too, but for 1/10 of the cost these are just as good. No moister has gotten inside and they have never let me down yet. Genssi products continue to surprise me.
B008HNWCK8|5|Love It
B000PWWPCY|1|Not worth what I pay for it , poor quality , it's right fit for Avalon 2006 . But not recommend for anyone .<br />لا يستحق السعر غالي ، جودة لا تذكر وخفيف ولا انصح احد باقتنائه
B00IQ5X91I|5|GREAT
B008SEBQ2G|1|bought for a 2015 Dodge Ram and it would not pick up the satellite radio.
B00G0P0GHQ|5|Great find
B00DSR49FE|5|These look so cute in my car! I love them
B004C67GNM|5|Easy install in a 2012 Toyota Highlander Hybrid.  This is an OEM part and you will save a fair amount of money doing it yourself.  This is the higher quality of the two filters that fit in this style Highlander.  I was having some less than desirable smells and swapping this in seemed to help quite a bit.
B00026Z3E0|5|work great love them!
B008K6I1RU|5|Excellent product - at the right price !
B00KM9UWFC|4|Fast delivery good product.
B00GOZSZES|3|Great build quality and fitment, but the HID projector beam pattern is horrible.  The beams horizon line is where is should be but the &#34;flood&#34; area is striped and blotchy.  I was able to fix the problem by pulling out the HID reflector and lens through the opening in the back of the fixture (just makes it out with a little work) and replacing it with the factory pieces from the original headlights.  If you do not have the factory reflector and lens, do not buy this product.<br /><br />It seems like a waste to have to go through this procedure, but it is still better than buying an Acura replacement.
B000C9F7S4|5|Quiet original equipment
B00MBNOHW6|1|Cheap as f***, low quality, they said is made in Germany but they are definitely made in China. ..don't buy them,u will be disappointed .
B00252GRJY|5|Great quality, as expected.
B003FPF22I|5|They work good without all the having to place all the extra parts to get these bright lights
B001IV2F94|5|My MerCruiser would not idle properly - before ordering I watched a few videos about cleaning the carb and saw it was an easy enough DIY for me.<br />The kit worked great.  It does not include a float and I ordered a Sierra float but ended up not using it because it was not marked for proper adjustment.  But my OEM float was in fine shape anyway.  My boat runs great now.
B00E1SR9MO|5|So far, so good.  Fit on my truck just like the original rotors. Little to no break in needed.  Now stops on a dime without grabbing. Great rotors and pads for the price.
B006QH6XQG|5|haven't had a problem
B0008G5F42|5|I found it difficult to find a hitch ball with a long enough stud for my Toyota pickup bumper from any parts stores.  This one is perfect.
B00335HQBU|2|ok mats, could be much better
B00BDPFPNI|5|Perfect! Stinks you can't replace this at big box store, but 2 day prime was fine.
B001AVU2Q0|5|Part looks good and was easy to replace?
B005JU5VH8|5|bosch rule
B007MUY5XY|5|These replaced struts on a fiberglass tonneau cover which was ten years old. The old struts would support the cover when up, but lacked the oomph to initially raise it. The new struts were a quick easy install and lift the lid just like they are supposed to.
B00L4YDZJ4|2|A poor imitation of an OEM spare cover. I would have been really mad if I paid a full price, but this is not even worth the discounted price so I returned it.
B00G1N4UHY|5|Great product fast delivery great price
B0002SA2WG|5|Great product
B008J8I4S0|5|Great price and perfect fit!  Other parts I ordered were not correct as described for this job, but this part fit together perfectly and was easy to install!
B000EVU8MK|5|Works!
B00C2TETI6|3|cooks to hi on low setting
B007KFOBAI|1|These rotors have wrong description. It says rear but actual part is for the front. I ordered the part and received the wrong part. When I replaced the part i received the same wrong part again.
B00317764W|5|good choice
B005024BZS|5|Got this for my snowboard loving husband. He loved the cool design and it kept him warm.
B000FPYHOU|5|Very durable clock. Works great and is accurate
B009NLSTL4|5|cheap and works for project
B00WIZSEEE|4|Nice solid construction. Good finish on the metal. The glass tube is nice and thick. Time will tell how it stands up to the heat. Not sure how the filter compares to other ones, but it's way better than nothing. Having a see through filter is great for a quick fuel flow check.
B0081SBYPI|5|great windshield, relatively easy on and off, not as easy as the velcro style.
B00NF1REOQ|4|This part fit like a glove on my truck,much cheaper than the oem part. Only thing didn't like about it is that some metal parts are soft and may bend upon installation,if that happens you can just bend it back...other than that it works fine. so far this part have given me good service,very happy to be able to use my key fob again.
B003NO6QVC|5|did the trick, beefy
B0022YIOE6|2|I'll start with the good. It holds gas. The electric blue matches my bike great.<br /><br />Now the bad. The fitment for the drz400s is really bad. I had to mill out the rear tank brackets to make it fit. The petcock hole was not big enough and needed to be drilled larger. Seat fitment is poor, and leaves a 3/8 or larger gap between the tank and seat. I had to modify the corbin seat to make it fit, since the tank pushes the seat back futher than the rear seat mounting brackets. The front area where it connects to the radiator is just a bad match, bending the tank and lifting the radiators is needed. To me, this creates a stress point. The hardware it comes with is cheap junk.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and buy a different brand. For me who has the tools and skills, I can make it work. It is going to be a pain to do any maintenance that requires removing the tank.
B00CPL918E|5|Great alternative to the castrol tws 10w60!  I use this oil with the Liqui Moly MoS2 Anti-friction additive.
B005BHUI2W|4|Fit good, only one with dimensions of filter.
B00DQ4TJUO|4|You can find the exact same item for less - but without the Mazda logo.  I wanted the Mazda logo.  I have used the same product for different vehicles and the visor lasts forever - and does what it is supposed to do.  I find it easy to install and remove.  My complaint is that for an item that costs over $60 there is no longer a storage bag included.  When I purchased in the past it always came with a storage bag that made it convenient to stow when not in use.  Cutting corners but then charging more is not good business.
B007CDYXZG|5|Excellent product. I can feel the difference when switching to this brand.
B009P8W9E8|5|great product and would buy again!
B006FZRCJG|4|Fit well
B000C9580Q|5|Good product
B00DQWD808|5|Just put them on this AM. Having done it on another Subaru I found it easy. So far so good.
B002DZJQ0A|5|Perfect!! They were what I was looking for to put the transponder in a rental car, I frequently use.
B00EKTJU26|5|Fantastic
B00382UXKY|5|I’m swapping engines on my 1990 Chevy K2500 350 5.7L and I got the old engine out with a 1-ton engine hoist set all the way out at the 1/4 ton setting. However, going back in was a whole different story. Since I latterly pulled the old one out I didn’t have enough reach with the boom to get the new engine over the motor mounts… I was about 10-inches short. I purchased the lift based on the measurements but they were a bit deceiving on the reach because of the way the hook was attached and the pump hit my bumper… both of which cut the reach down by about 5-inches. The boom on the lift is just like a 2-inch receiver so I removed the hook form the lift, slid this in, clamped it in place with a safety chain and installed the hook in the end with the hitch pin. For about 20-bucks this solved my problem and the engine went in easily… though I was probably pushing the weight limit with my DIY extension. I did get the engine safely in the vehicle before I made my modification and then lifted it again to get it back where it should go. This was the alternative to about 250-bucks for a 1-time use of a 2-ton lift.
B0051WVPB0|4|Top went on quick and easy. directions were ok. fished with it a few times so far and it's worked great
B003FBV8ZW|5|They are great , very comfortable to wear!
B00S2HVV2Y|4|I haven't actually tested this in a real crash (the hope is that I never have to do this test).  Since I didn't want to have to take my shoes off and pull on knee pads in the middle of a ride, I rode all 13 miles of my ride starting with a 1,000 foot climb with these knee pads on.  Although they felt bulky, they didn't seem to get in the way while climbing, and I stopped noticing them altogether the more tired I got.  They stayed in place really well, and I didn't adjust them once on the ride.  I don't wear knee pads often, and I expect that I'll only wear these on more technical trails or downhills.
B0065UN8EO|5|Great for my tune up. Always use motorcraft in your stock ford vehicle. OEM product.
B004BTG6G8|5|great product for chips...
B0041TS6UM|5|It fits like original
B0054YGV6Y|5|Love the sticker but it is applied to outside of window. We will see if it holds up.
B008JORKP2|4|Great little firepit...no smoke wafting into the house and you can still roast marshmallows! :-)
B000VS6J1K|5|sounds good and fit well
B000XJRYQ6|5|Worked pretty well, actually.  I didn't really nail the color match with my quick mix, but it was close enough to make the leather chair look a thousand percent better!  And it was fun to play with.  We couldn't get anyone to even take the chair with all the cat/dog scratches in the leather, and now my wife has decided to keep it, which is a 180 degree shift from &#34;Let's get rid of that recliner.&#34;
B000CSEWJA|5|Wix is hard to beat. Maybe I haven't been in the right places yet, but I have never heard a complaint of anything the Wix people make.
B000KIVO7U|2|It came damaged , had to do repairs on my own , the back up service was poor even with the claim
B0050VH07K|3|I ordered this for my jeep quite some time ago and they did not fit so i just put them away, I went to pick them up out of my tool box to use them as trailer light replacement bulbs and 2 of the 5 led arms broke off just trying to get the light in the hole.  I wont buy again. Take you time and you may have better lick then me. Keep in mind you will need lots of space in your housing in order for these to fit otherwise they will not be able to slide in all the way to be able to open back up to cast the light forward.
B00X2TUW1I|5|so far so good, looks like a good product plus its got no suction cups which is a plus. has been able to sustain AZ heat so far, so I have got no complains. The company which manufactures these seems pretty excited about their product which is good to see.
B00E3XWBO8|5|Very nice thanks.
B00D9C2CDO|5|As billed no leaks easy on easy off
B00I250T88|5|So happy to have found this product - the door insets on my Avalon were getting badly scratched by ring wearers and now they are secure
B007Y87T1O|5|The item was exactly as posted and worked perfectly.  Not to mention the pricing was amazing. This makes twice I have ordered from this company and both times I was very well pleased. If I should need to order any other parts this will be my go to.  Also a big thank you for your quick delivery.  I would recommend your company to anyone.
B0041MB7M8|5|EXCELLENT PRODUCT AT A GREAT PRICE. WILL BE ORDERING AGAIN AS NEEDED.
B000SL4A84|5|We purchased this 121-piece Road Trip First Aid Kit for our ever-growing earthquake pack. I was really impressed by the amount of items that they were able to fit into such a compact case. The items we received were just as described and will be perfect in case of an emergency.
B00T6DUL2Y|5|Seems to work well.
B0031C07AM|5|Excelente
B001W2D1VA|4|Works well in bathroom with a burning scented candle.
B007ZLO1UC|4|direct fit for my freestar. The front feels new again. If you can wait buying here will def save you some money.
B00JMLBIF4|3|Updated July 27, 2016:<br />The color has been changing over time (see photo) and now is noticeably different.<br /><br />Original review below:<br />Good quality although the original has some sparkle while the replacement is more of a matte style.  Not noticeable unless you hold them right next to each other.
B00CIJVZGO|3|good quality and would have been a great addition to my car but the bottom nozzle is in the wrong direction for 2015 Chargers and Challengers with the 6.4L.  I understand they are working on an updated model for the newer cars.
B00D6YG948|5|Works awesome
B000XEBI9K|5|Just purchased a second one for my second car. This protected my bumper last month when someone driving a pickup rear ended my parked car. Very convenient, just flip out when parked and flip into trunk when driving. The metal inside the straps deters theft. Highly recommend and will purchase for my additional cars. Instead of buying the highest end bully (platinum edition), I was able to attach some thinner strips of foam pads to the back of the gold edition using superglue which adds protection against bumps. Saves you the extra 20 dollars for the platinum edition.
B008G30OS6|5|good fit
B00QMWQSAG|3|Too lightweight. The fit is okay, but not perfect. These will do until I purchase a heavier duty mat set.
B00APXHZ1E|4|Good product
B000ZEON90|5|Works as described and makes hooking up much easier.
B00K872U3U|3|It holds the water out and debris ... but it breaks after about 6 months.. need stronger material
B003E1GLSM|5|works on snowmobile trailer just fine.
B00BG6IJA0|2|Seemed to be  good quality, but I returned it because it was empty, no hydralic fluid.
B00JG5XC8C|5|I was impressed with the speed of delivery. The quality was the same as the original.
B004J8P22A|5|A very useful, well made product. Buy a lock to keep it from being stolen!
B00ASY2614|5|Ordered with hitch installed myself in no time I would suggest finding utube video<br />To explain installation but not hard at all
B00SSF6U26|5|These do what they say they do, and are well made.  I use them frequently.  We had one stolen (someone took the time to unscrew one, but left behind their screwdriver bit), and I wanted to buy a replacement.  The manufacturer sent one at no charge.  That's going the extra mile, and was very appreciated.
B004RCXB8A|5|Very simple device that is simple to install.  Works great.
B00HHF90E8|5|Fit 2004 Acura MDX perfectly. Easy install, less than 5 minutes.
B007QXM9SU|5|good buy.
B000C0UP2G|5|Replaced a leaky hose on the upper portion of my 1997 Volvo 960. Worked as advertised.
B0043D7LBQ|5|Bought these for my 04 accord and they work great. If you're looking for good quality and trying to save money these are it. Been about a year since I've installed the front/back pads and they're still just as fine. A lot cheaper here than at the store.
B00BCRMA9Y|3|Did not fit my Nissan Frontier very well.  The quality of the material was fine and I ended up donating the covers to a friend of mine and they fit great in her car!  All was not lost.
B000TG6LF8|1|Pump would not get fluid to spray nozzle. Too long, or just not enough suction. Either way, don't buy it, it doesn't work on the large jug of S100.
B00BG3G928|4|Good price fit fine!
B0023VIKSS|5|Awesome! Great Seller!
B0052UMJAW|5|Just like it came from the factory
B0012UK3M2|5|Arrived on time and fits my husband's 2003 Kawasaki 1200 Voyager II perfectly. Works as advertised and basically got two for what it costs for one at a motorcycle shop.
B00BD5GW4E|5|Nice
B000M6Y4VI|5|Worked as expected
B00KTIXICK|5|Arrived quickly. Was as expected.
B001F85OUM|5|This is a mandatory item for me on any motorcycle I have owned! It really does draw drivers attention that you are stopping. There is a noticable difference as to how close people get to my rear at lights...
B00LLLVW9A|5|A common problem with this is that the key blade is too long it needs to be cut down some or the transponder will be to far to work, find an actual key shop/safe shop and they'll be able to cut the key down enough to make the transponder close enough to work. Not all key places can do this, it only takes a little bit to make it work.
B00JA80PEO|4|I installed it to 3/4 face jet helmet (Scorpion Exo 220 http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00JA80PEO?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o05_s00).<br />Installation was not easy:<br />a) slots for headphones in the helmet were smaller (they fit well to Scala Rider ear speakers), so i had to cut the plastic layer and then the firm foam layer to make them larger and insert ear speakers. Ear speakers are not thin (compared to more expensive headsets), so there should be sufficient space to wear them<br />b) the &#34;headset clip&#34; with fastening screws was useless - Either my helmet shell was thin or slippery, but no way to fix it firmly. So used another clip with adhesive pad (it is not shown in the manual but was in the box - thanks! :)<br /><br />The rest (non-hardware) part was very easy.<br /><br />Operation & Functionality:<br />Pros:<br />1) Connection with phone and call quality - excellent<br />2) Music - not bad<br />3) FM radio works really well<br /><br />Cons:<br />1) The Bluetooth receiver cannot be locked firmly on the headset clip/mount. It feels like can jump out from the slots and drop... the only hope not to loose it is the headset wire wire connected to the receiver<br />2) Charging (or headset wire) plug is not micro-usb. So you cannot use a common USB cable and should carry this specific one if you travel.
B00F7SIG3S|4|Great, solid solution to the pump movement issue. Shame on GM engineers for a bad design on the original.
B00GKRQ7DG|4|Definitely not as big as the picture, but it is still very cute! It arrived on time and with no hassle.
B007B5O062|5|Works great... exactly as advertised
B000UV8FNS|5|this lighting kit has tons of options to help you set it just how you want it.<br />Overall great kit. Just wish the lengths were a bit longer. I installed this kit in my truck and had to extend the wires for the rear lights.<br />Most likely this kit was designed for a car but still give this product 5 stars
B00D99TX3E|5|I purchased this as a replacement for a cracked part.  It took a little maneuvering but fits perfectly (and color matches) with my 2004 Pilot.  Definitely a doable DIY.
B0012QBWBW|5|great
B00GZHADJA|5|Does the trick
B001CF1A7O|5|I bought this for an emergency and put it in my Dodge Ram 2500 mega-cab 4WD truck in case that emergency should ever arrive.  Lo and behold, in mid-June after 3 weeks of daily rain I attempted to turn around in my own yard and the truck sunk straight up to the frame.  My 37&#34; mud tires did nothing but dig bigger holes.  I hooked on my 4WD tractor plus my 4WD Toyota 4Runner but the Dodge didn't move.  Instead, we just sunk the tractor and the 4Runner in the yard, too.  Winched out the 4Runner and put a snatch block on this D-ring (which fits perfectly in th factory 2&#34; class IV receiver) and using the 8000 lb winch on the 4Runner we slowly dragged the Dodge backward, inch by inch.  I was initially concerned about breaking something as the snatch block was exerting 16,000 lbs pull against the D-ring but it held perfectly. No bending, no binding, no visible damage or cracks, and the threaded pin is not bent or tweaked at all.
B00DSD58DA|5|Futurama Yea
B00E0MM9J4|5|I love this tuner i highly recommend geting one my bike is running cooler. And now has a lower rpm.  The maps are spot on. My bike was just on the dyno.  I am proud to say it has 135 hp!!!!!  Thank you
B00C7I4XQ0|5|Fantastic Amazon Trader / experience. Highly Reccomend.
B00V86NVQA|5|Bueno
B009NLZH2S|5|👍🏼
B00F8NUAVI|5|Works on 2014 Ram 3500 DRW just fine.  Keeps honest people honest, and makes it harder for someone malicious to play around.
B0038AYJFG|3|Fits perfectly,looks and works great.Simple installation and super bright.  Update: In less than a year the black plastic trim faded and is blotchy...looks terrible. The LED's still work and the lens looks good.
B00FEZEVQK|5|Works great, great quality, very bright! I used them on my sons power wheels and love them.
B00AQ2G4Q6|5|No issues. Cheaper than buying directly from Honda.
B00GQO5C9S|3|I was a bit disappointed in the one I received. It is identical to the second one I got at Harbor Freight for a few dollars less. Both of them smell very bad like baked rubber. They definitely had to stay outside for a couple of weeks to rid them of at least most of the smell.
B00LL4B99K|4|As described...  Would order again!
B0049QHKJ0|5|Thank you!
B00FZIRJ2O|5|Fits perfect on a Sorento 2011. If you have airbag light problems try to test each airbag sensors before you purchase this module. If all sensors works as they should, the go for this module without worries.
B008NYAOCY|5|This i got a day earlier and very nice
B001UC6VYG|3|It was the right one!
B00N2BRI22|3|Cheap looking but serves it purpose.
B003FVFV46|1|poor quality , came ripped and kept falling off my seats don't order these you'll regret it
B007H2RR78|5|Works great.  Exactly what was needed.
B00FH1EWPG|5|Best tank I have ever used or even seen.  Mounts great to the tank ring, has a place for all of your things and comes off on .2 seconds.  no messing with straps or magnets or leaving marks on your tank.  A larger one would be great for longer road trips if you didnt have side bags but this one is great for commuting and long trips on my bike since I can throw other stuff in the side bags.
B000NPGG0U|5|Thank you!
B002OTT4RK|5|It worked for my daihatsu yrv speedometer signal that came from automatic transmission ECU.my speedometer is accurate,and the app helps calculate the difference required. Highly recommended.
B002SB03IS|5|I've had this over a year now and am glad I bought it. It helps to keep stuff from sliding around and if you have something that you don't want to put on the hard bed, it gives plenty of cushion. It's made from good quality rubber.  I roll it up and store it in the winter, so I don't know how it would hold up in the weather 365 days a year.  Just make sure you know this is for the LONG bed.
B00029XGIM|5|Great little compact horn, the stock one in my car was a high pitched air horn and it sounded ridiculous, this is much better for the price!
B00KXKW6WC|5|They are just what we wanted and arrived on time.
B000EVYH7W|5|Exactly what my husband wanted & needed :)
B00EAMBIS2|5|What we needed
B00S8OX69M|5|My 78 Chevy 1/2 ton looks great with new wheel paint and these chrome lugs
B001RZ62X6|5|Perfect fit
B0031P0A1A|5|same as oem parts...
B000C55MQK|3|Shocks were a breeze to install. The van rides so much better. The only main concern I have with this product is that the spring and some of the shocks bad slight surface rust on them. I hit them with black high temp spray paint and they are good to go now.
B001AS2798|1|The decal delivered is not the size advertised. The decal is only 1&#34; x 7.5&#34; if you want to actually see it you need to put it within arms reach.
B00029KC2K|5|I use this to deflect the heat from my motorcycle exhaust. It cuts easily, sticks really well and keeps the heat from burning my license plate.
B0041MEBYO|5|Excelente
B0002UNON8|2|Didn't remove any scratches :)
B00DTBTJA4|5|great low profile frame hugging look stitching is nice plenty of compliments sits me low on my 1200 sportster glad I bought this instead of a 600 dollar lepera or something comfort is ok for around town ive got no complaints and it looks cool
B001KR98OG|1|Skipped and streaked on clean windshield after less than a month of use in a mild climate. The rubber blades are flexible and I was skeptical when I first pulled it out of the box. for me, it proved not to work.<br /><br />Go to your auto parts store and spend the same amount on some better blades.These are crap.
B00KHUQAY8|5|As someone else wrote, it isn't TOO blingy, just a few scattered rhinestones around the top. The sides are softer, the bottom doesn't have any rhinestones. I really like it because it fits tightly, doesn't slide around, and is padded, but not bulky.
B00K36EC32|5|This is the second one I have purchased from the Amazon.  The first one was about $14.00 and after a short period of time it started to slip on the steering wheel.  Recognizing how dangerous that was I took it off immediately.  This second one is more expensive $29.95 but I could tell at once the quality was double that of my first purchase.  It fits tight and has no slippage.  I would recommend if you want this cleaned that you not wash it but take it to a cleaners for dry cleaning.
B000CSD66A|4|Great plugs at a great price
B008BRJ5FA|5|Great Price!!
B002XL30JM|5|Looks to be of good quality
B00B4AOK3S|1|Lights would look great if they worked.... First time it rained water was stuck inside the tailight, as well as the LED strips went out one by one in a matter of months. I wish I could get a refund or a new set. But I don't have another $400
B002OPZHAM|5|Works on 2006 F150
B000CG8ED2|4|Definitely stiffer than OEM but so far so good. Don't forget bump stop
B001G4X4KW|5|Really need to clamp basket onto hitch.  Recommend some thick washers for a good fit else it wobbles on back of car.  Basket one piece--rod is separate when received in mail.
B000Q86IP2|4|We installed this cup holder on the outside of our toddler's bed. Now she has an easy-to-reach spot for her water where it's not going to tip and spill (because if you have a toddler you are positive there is no such thing as a spill-proof toddler cup). After using it a handful of months, however, the bottom of it is starting to droop. It doesn't seem like it will fall apart, but it's a little more difficult to keep cups sturdy.
B002ZBWKAU|1|Absolute waste of money. Was slow in the starting but did work now after 3 months it takes 15 minutes to go up .5units
B000C36BH6|5|worked well
B00S729U5Y|5|It fit.. Didn't break during install.<br /><br />These aren't really specific (as I found out)  other than the tabs that fit the notches. So any elbow that is the same size will fit snug into the hole. There really isn't a point in buying this for $7+, when your average auto store sells comparable joints for $2.
B00TQ045VA|2|Description title says McNab as does the plastic bag it came in but the actual keychain says Macnab. (mcnab is a dog breed) my bad I guess for not noticing the spelling in the picture.
B00HJ6O4A0|5|It's nice
B003AOHKLA|5|great product and would buy again!
B00Z80KUSO|5|Best price for your buck
B004IQLZP6|4|Good gun for the price. It's no top of the line product but performs very well for the occasional painter. Would definitely buy again
B000COCMX2|1|At this time I cannot rate the product.  The Hawk website shows these as REAR pads for a 2003 Chevy 25000HD (Duramax).  They do not fit the rears--maybe the fronts, but I am not replacing the fronts.  The lesson is: do not trust the Hawk website for application.  When I get the right pads I will change the rating to reflect the product.
B002EVWDNU|5|great product works very well
B00UAGX7NG|5|Installed these myself on a 2004 Titan. Worked very well and was easy to replace the old set.
B001NYJOHC|4|Excellent fit for 04 passat 1.8,  far cheaper than dealer price.
B001P29NK0|2|Very nice and superior truck crossover box to have. But you either get lucky or not. I didn't, received it with two huge chips and dents on the top lid.
B00MUYQM9M|5|👌
B0060BELNA|1|The paint won't come out.
B000MDZLR2|4|Looks to be made well. Good thickness vinyl. Better than expected.
B0046IC24O|1|Remoter did not have the range of the original, and it stop working after a month, even with a new battery.
B000BUU5Z4|5|Holder worked perfectly. Hit some serious rough roads and never dropped a brush.
B00TQHHCTK|5|Item as described by seller. Has the release valve on the side so it makes it very easy to lower the tire pressure on my dirt bike without guessing.
B001GJ9K8C|5|Works well
B001GMONUY|5|Very good top for the money. Keeps most elements out including rain.
B00HPISEQC|3|They look great, but when I tried to put them on the back speakers they wouldn't stay on. Front speakers fit perfectly and stays on. I plan on adding more double sided tape.
B00X6HFCQG|2|The flag I received had the words &#34;AN appeal to heaven&#34;,  NOT  &#34;APPEAL TO HEAVEN&#34;.
B001U6DMSK|4|A good product for the cost.
B0002JMF98|5|Good quality, fast shipping.
B00ML0EHS8|1|They all fell apart and didn't work!!!! Really upset with the product
B00BQYCIVI|5|It like as the Meguiars one, but have a bigger size and better finish than the Meguiars.<br />Excellent!
B00DJ3NRX2|4|perfect no issues
B0075IC990|5|goog
B00M9NJCPU|3|Not really worth the money.  I used two pens for two tires and it did not fill them all the way.  Also if you don't put a white base down on top of your surface first it will not be as bright.  Thus you will need a minimum of 4 pens!  Using basic paint would be cheaper and you could reuse it.
B001EOWQAS|4|The template provided to trim the under cover was no where near where it needed to be trimmed. But it worked, just not too pretty looking.
B004L6FICE|1|Didn't fit my car which is 2000galant es .
B003VB0XIE|3|Instructions were inadequate.  Looking at the blow up diagram helped more that the instructions did.  Some of the hardware was incorrect (1/2&#34; washers provided didn't fit the 1/2&#34; bolts).  Overall the mounting hardware is cheaply made, loose when the Gard is installed and the unit certainly isn't worth the retail price.  It really isn't tall enough for a full sized Dodge Ram and, if you raise it high enough to protect the hood the bumper is going to take a beating if you happen to run into a gravel road or freshly chip sealed highway.  If your toad is a smaller vehicle this will work.  I'm going to have to add a Protect-A-Tow at added $239 expense to protect my 2015 Dodge from damage.  So, if you are towing a larger vehicle figure on added expense if you really want to protect it.
B00BNX88ZW|5|Got what we expected
B00GUF74HQ|5|Easy install works great
B007HG7AEY|5|Great for lifted and extended vehicles
B005DNNI7G|5|Wow! Most impressive. Great value considering the competition charging twice as much for something comparable or even inferior. After viewing the enclosed catalog, I will be purchasing other products from NRG Innovations in the future.
B001NZUFN8|4|It is great for holding phone or even glasses. I like this item
B00XP7ER7C|1|Pins on one plug did not line up properly.Air bag light out but no radio or cruise not a good product!
B00FXHU0AA|5|Fixed the problem!
B00KPWSHLW|1|I had a problem with the old one the 2 button didn't work so I switched to the new case it never worked.  thank you for wasting my time and my money
B0038FYVQ8|5|Washed window, applied sticker, left it on overnight during the summer, peeled backing off in the morning. Looks great.
B000TZPAQ0|5|What can I say? its light bulbs... they work.... the price is right...
B010N7RW2S|5|This thing just saved my butt.  I suspected my battery was going bad and bought this as a precaution.  Less than a week later, my car wouldn't start. The instructions were clear and easy to follow and it worked great first time.  A very handy *little* piece of kit.
B002UD0GIG|5|Makes a world of difference.
B003720W3I|5|Good shades for riding
B009RC2HVC|5|Good product good price good shipping
B00CD2RHTU|5|Product arrived fast, great fit on my 2003 dodge ram 2500 hemi. Great price easy install with no mechanical skills. Did purchase self tapping stainless screws as others described in their review. Will say putting the bolts on fenders need to be done by hand or they will strip easily. Overall exceptionally satisfied purchased a second pair for my cousins 02 ram 1500.
B0041DYBX4|4|These are okay but really small.  The hood on our JD lawn tractor broke and we got a replacement, but it did not have any decals.  We bought these thinking they would look good, but we were wrong.  The moral is to be sure that you have a good idea on what size you need!
B0012ZITJQ|5|good stuff
B004I15MHI|5|Perfect fit
B000C2GEDI|5|I have found that they are not always perfect with everything, but these gaskets did not fail. They fit and seal perfectly. Almost everything here for the TPI. If working on one, you might also consider buying the gaskets for the TB's upper plate, lower IAC/ water passage and IAC. Then you should be set for everything on the plenum.
B001EAQTRI|1|Tremendously reduces the sound quality but not the noise. I also noticed on the package direction to go online To check if product fits your stereo . Shouldn't you put that on your online description too?<br />Just don't buy your hopes will be ruined.
B00SMXWH8A|5|I loved the way pieces fit it was putting a puzzle together. No pieces were left over. Thnks
B0000BX6RG|4|As described...  Would order again!
B00F9E3DLU|4|Worked perfectly.  Shipping was a little slow.
B00407WNE0|4|Price is a little much, does improve the look and add comfort though. Should be an included item stock.
B009D4RPQ6|5|Fits perfect and looks awesome
B00VNBDWPK|5|Bright Light, installed the Hi-Lo H4 and the H8 fog light and the light is super bright.
B00180FUZG|5|I always use Moog replacement parts if available. These were the usual high quality and design. The stock Corolla units had a hex key inside the mounting bolt which, even if you have the proper tools, were so rusted I couldn't get them off. Instead I just got out the trusty cut-off tool and didn't give it a second thought. The Moog parts have a better and easier double wrench design, just be sure to have a skinny (thin) crescent wrench for the inner nut or you'll pinch your wrench in between the link end and the mounting point and wont be able to get it back out.
B004ZF4GKG|5|this kit is awesome, easy to install, and after one month no problems.  the lights work much better than the factory headlamps and are not overly obnoxious to other drivers.  everything was fully compatable with my &#34;vintage&#34; 99 C280
B00BCRMAR6|3|Works great for the front two seats just the back seats are a bit challenging to get on. overall very good product
B00LPHGM40|4|works great good instructions
B00D66GIJM|3|TRUE Pt # Ford Racing M-6766-MP46A it is a Oil Fill Cap Cover 4.6/5.4/6.8L Modular Engines &#34;Ford Racing&#34; Logo Chromed Aluminum  $ 49.99 @ Jegs.  Amazon Price was $ 20.00 July 2015.  This is a chrome cap for your own cap.  I'm going to modify a breather cap to make it work. So it's just a cap with no way to screw into the valve cover; you will need a breather cap to use this dress up item.  Under this dress up cap is a strip of double stick tap to secure this cap to your cap.  Part # listed by Amazon is for a blue breather cap and I'm glad to get the chrome cap for a cap but thought it was going to be a complete cap and air filter. Ford Racing oil fill cap covers easily install over your factory plastic oil fill cap for an instant custom look!  Three stars due to incorrect item description.
B00HHGRXA0|1|These were a direct fit for my 2006 Trailblazer EXT with 4x4.  I could hear a vibration for the last half of a 600 mile trip.  I brought it home and put these on.  Noise gone and they fit well.  Tightened up the whole front end.<br /><br />They only lasted 18 month or about 6000 miles.  Cheap junk.  Buy Moog or Timken
B000CQHZP0|5|Perfect fit and 3/4 turn to lock ensures its locked! Good design and worth every penny! 1994 TOYOTA pickup
B008FQ6H1C|5|worked well - fits 2004 BMW X3
B00TYZJXR8|4|Good. Only issue I have with it is the spacing between the rear view mirror is lopsided. Otherwise it has the right dimension
B0000BYQ8U|5|Great Mirror...Easy install......Makes a much safer time on the water......A+++++
B00XZ9OAGI|5|Great customer service, great instructions, excellent price!
B00J6UFHYY|5|Good job
B004AIHKT2|5|Buying this part online saved me alot of money
B000BZDKRE|4|great product
B0002MA4WK|5|JUST WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR. MET MY EXPECTATIONS.
B00V30J86I|1|bag is tiny, cannot set it as shown on pics. very unhappy, useless :(
B00CV3CMXW|5|I just love it good for my hip
B000N9XFUK|5|Perfect fit for my MerCruiser, no problems at all.
B004LF3HQO|4|Did the job , but will use lacquer thinner next time
B00FGR8VVW|5|Perfect fit. Looks awesome. Great buy. Fits my 02 Honda shadow ACE deluxe. Customizing my bike so perfect for the job not too big or too small.
B003VLBPJA|4|Good, what can you expect on this price? It does the job.
B00S9OM0AM|5|Thank you!
B00HZCG1KY|5|The product is just as advertised.  The sellers are great - very helpful and attentive!
B0009IQZH0|5|Great for cleaning and hold up very well to multiple uses. I use this for general around the house tasks as well as cleaning/drying my mountain bike.
B00KQXKG46|4|For the price, you can't beat it.<br />pretty darn bright.<br />will have to wait & see how it holds up.
B00IKPFRW8|2|I purchased this because the original equipment was starting to split by a seam and you could feel it  WELL THIS ONE CAME WITH A SPLIT IN A DIFFERENT Spot!  I did nt find it till I installed it  and I am not going to throw out the original as this will not last long
B00HD9VD5C|5|Passenger side mirror arrived when advertised, as advertised.  Was easy to install.  No issues.
B000J2KPM2|5|Exactly what we needed to fix our panel in our CRV. Auto shop said it would cost $250 to replace the lights. Took us 20 minutes and $8. Best deal! Quick shipment
B00A8XK3DI|4|Read directions thoroughly and watched video on website to make sure I knew what I was doing. Whole installation would have taken me about 45 minutes, but finished job took me a couple of hours because of necessary removal of plastic underside skirt (material right under trunk, most of which sits on the underside of the driver's side of vehicle). Taking plastic cover involved 5-6 plastic rivets and 3-4 10 mm screws. Removal of plastic cover gave me access to driver side frame rail. Installing trailer was a piece of cake. Reinstalling the plastic skirt was the most time-consuming part of the job (about an hour). I eyeballed parts that I had to trim using a utility knife. First, I trimmed about 2x 4 inches around the existing precut slit around the tow hook of the car. To allow the driver's side arm of the hitch to protrude out of the cover, I cut out a rectangular piece of 1x5 inches. These two modifications to the underside skirt allowed the bulky u-bolt (along with the two flange nuts) and part of the anchor metal plate (at the end of the driver's side arm of the hitch) to fit around plastic skirt.  I have watched a couple of videos on Amazon and the Curt website and no one mentions this cover. Perhaps this is unique to Hybrids or maybe removal of this item is considered not important.
B005QAI466|2|This product is &#34;OK&#34; when used in conjunction with the wax.  However I have noticed that a few hours after applying it leaves a very thin white haze.  It happened to me on two different occasions, both of which I followed the directions to the letter.  However all it took was a light buff to remove it, but its worth mentioning.  If it were not for the hazing I would give it 5 stars.
B002P8HJTK|4|This mirror fit my 2006 Ford Fusion SEL perfectly, was easy to install and came complete with the puddle light on the bottom. Great item.
B00CSENJ1I|5|done real good thanks
B000C0UOOU|5|Good fit, Great parts!
B0080J1200|4|I used this tool to secure the clamp on a Mercedes-Benz (W203) steering rack boot. It compressed the clamp easily and perfectly. Because of its offset design, it was easy to use in the tight confines under the car.
B001P9VL7G|5|It fits.

B00LR8595K|1|Junk stay away
B002P8DAEI|5|Well I had the factory two,peice style on an 07 Limited and no heat or extra.... Just power. And im way impressed under 80 bucks and I have two great looking mirrors and I deleted chrome covered so I am stoked. Quality seems to be there. Easy with online tutorials on utube<br /><br />Go buy if you have any broken or need an all black mirror. To cheap to go otherwise
B009DK98MO|3|Let's be honest.  You're considering this part because your local auto parts store wants $200 more for what appears to be the same part.  This is close.  But do yourself a favor.  Yes, you'll void any warranty.  But this part will leak.  Maybe not on day one (like my second one did) maybe not on day twenty (like my first one did) but it will leak.  And you'll spend as much to return it as you did to buy it. Where the metal line attaches to the pressure hose, some soybean counter decided to save a few tenths of a yuan and use a 1 mm thick o-ring.  It's not strong enough.  But if you separate these two sections (you can do it easily with a 19 and 14 mm wrench) and install a more robust o-ring (less than a buck) this part will work just fine.  And you'll still have spent $199 less than your local parts store.
B00D9C2CDO|5|Works great.  Have taken 4 separate trips from Wisconsin to Tennessee.  Not water tight, but in torrential down pour for several hours only about 1/2 cup of water in the bottom.  I now put a towel in the bottom front.  The towel will be a little damp, but everything else is dry.<br /><br />Holds a lot!  Put two medium size suitcases, two small duffels, and a couple other bags.  Still room for more.<br /><br />Straps holding up well, no rips or seams coming loose.
B00JR3Z9HK|5|PERFECT FIT!
B009S31VVW|5|My wife's 2011 Fusion's door handle broke. The dealer wanted roughly $200 to replace it. I found this piece and did it myself in about 20 minutes. It works and fits perfectly. If you're ok with taking the door panel off, this is an easy fix.
B00NDN4ZE8|5|I have been using an old set of microfiber cloths for years on my classic car, and I was a little nervous buying these because people have spoken about them being thin and smelly.  These were 10 times softer and nicer than my other clothes ever were.  There was no smell coming out of the box, and their thickness is just fine.
B00YIMTOV2|5|Had this in use for a year now and still rolling strong...thanks guys
B000CIHL8Y|5|perfect length, but still need to test radio on commute. i will update review when i do so

B000GRMLRW|5|Fits perfectly.  Beautifully​ made.
B00CUEDWQS|5|HAVE NOT INSTALLED IT YET. BUT ITS A MATCH FOR THE OEM. WILL GET ANOTHER ONE AND CHANGE BOTH AT THE SAME TIME.
B004RNR9QY|5|It's a water hose,  good quality.  Does not impart any taste to water.
B00OJG327E|4|Works ok on heavy truck brakes, sorta of large in size, and would of preferred metal. All in all worth the buy.
B00G2TV7OG|2|started out great, but one bulb has already burned out and Im a few days outside the return policy.
B007TY0E1K|5|Works perfect great job
B00JUHEGK4|1|had to go to dealer for key and case because they wouldn't use this one.
B004A6M7E2|5|A great value and working just fine!  It has been in the car for about a month now, installed easily and not a single leak from any of the connections.  Glad I bought one of these for my sons Mitsubishi as a replacement for his OEM that developed a cracked upper tank.  I recommend to anyone needing to save some money and buying a replacement radiator for their car.
B0049Z8X4C|3|Ok, great for BMW owners.
B000CMHT1E|2|Not as high quality as I had hoped
B00WMK6Z46|5|I received the OxGord Universal Fit Front/Rear 4 Piece Full Set Ridged Heavy Duty Mats at a discount for my hones and unbiased review. I have purchased several OxGord products now and I am very pleased with ALL of my purchases. I did have a previous mat set but they were not rubber and my feet rubbed through the front mat in just a few months. I just installed these a week ago and am very impressed with the feel and durability of this product. I love the ridged edges and they are really &#34;heavy&#34; so I know that they will hold up. They are rubber so it makes them really easy to clean ( just whip them out and spray them with a hose) and they fit perfect in my Mercury Sables LS Premium (2003). I would recommend this product to anyone!
B00T5H2MQE|5|Love this sign and has it placed on the tailgate of my Chevy truck!
B00407RS3Q|5|great paint
B00XBLGGOE|5|Great product, nice and light, strong, easy to assemble, and very solid once installed. My 70 year parents love it
B00P03UPN4|5|excellent value worked great. had a roof load of about 90 pounds for 12hr road trip.
B004ME11FS|3|I'm on my second one after 6 months and about 10 hookups... works but not the best quality... I may come back and edit my review if I don't need a third one in 6 months again.
B007TYLNHO|5|Thx!
B00CGTVCIC|2|This is not LEATHER, it's stamped plastic. It also makes the steering wheel very thick with two inner ridges.
B00E0IJYQY|5|(Cbr600rr 2005)Very nice kit, worth the money as far as I can tell havent drove on the new parts to much (about 60 miles) but so far so good.. you'll need to rivet this chain.. it isn't a clip, so if you don't already have a riveting tool or good with a hammer, you'll have to take it to someone ... but it's all 100% after that.. comes with cool stickers too lol
B0085KGOIE|3|SEEMS STURDY  BUT DOESN'T TAKE MUCH OF A BUMP TO KNOCK THE DRAIN CAP OFF  ONLY HAS 2 LOCKING POINTS
B000S2VWHU|4|was difficult to remove old boots from plugs
B00PXNC7K0|3|I like the carrier but I can't believe they drilled TWO holes in the face of exposed aluminum that will bother me for ever. To fasten the support bar, two zip ties would do the job perfectly!!! And would take less time to do this. Can you please send me a new one with out these holes. Thank you very much Ken Ford
B0010GIDD4|5|Exactly what I needed, worked perfectly
B004LWVEKS|5|this battery recharger is awesome...we were having issues with a lawnmower battery and thought we would attempt to recharge instead of buying a new one and it has paid for itself several times over now
B000TV59EC|2|While the product is soft as advertised, it shreds too easily when being used.
B006HH0B90|5|Look great easy to install!
B00BDEP5ZM|5|The best for black tanks
B001KQC7OK|4|These fit my 94' Miata very well and seem to be of good quality. The only issue I had was that I ordered two. One came pre greased and when  I opened the second one it had a grease fitting an was not pre-lubed. I don't have a grease gun and had to delay my repair. I personally don't like grease fittings and this added time to my project. It would be nice if the descriptions were more accurate so that you could order the part that you are looking for.
B00M6FNDR4|5|It was what was described online.  Easy to apply. I like it.
B0053WQV3A|5|Size runs small. Other then that it's terrific! My son lovescit.
B005EIDW7Q|4|I bought this outside Amazon, but I'll make a review for everyone.. When I looked at the weld and price it's good. Not the best but it will do the job and give you an extra engine bling. However.. This is not a direct fit.. I had b18 swap on a civic and you will need to cut a piece of the fan shroud.. I highly suggest either replacing your radiator and fan to a slim one.. Or just get a slimmer fan if you don't want to cut your shroud.. Highly suggest getting the PLM telescopic test pipe as well.. I definitely saw power gains compared to my DC header.
B00KN0UOEE|5|There is nothing better than 303 for protecting the vinyl surfaces in your car. It's great stuff, doesn't leave things slippery or slimy and best of all provides UV protection. And NO silicones!

B004I17SBG|5|Works Great as looks just like factory replacement  for about half the cost. Would highly recommend !!!
B000F09CF4|5|can't figure out how to open it!!!
B00E63THQA|5|Keeps water/beer cold and kept coffee hot when I got it filled to take to the office. if you have small hands, this bottle will be too big for you to use and carry just to drink out of unless you get a straw top to put on it.
B00527VSYS|5|Best battery that I've purchased for my FZ6.  I have barely used the bike since I installed this battery almost 2 years ago and it always starts right up without any charging when I do want to ride.  Don't be fooled by similar batteries that cost over $100 dollars more and perform half as well.
B000CCFIYO|5|Couldn't be happier. Really opens up my Hemi and gives it that mean Magnaflow roar.
B00D6K7JMI|1|Junk !  it required an extra wire and it stopped working after the second start I removed it and installed one from another supplier. I will never purchase anything else from that supplier.
B00651CLCS|5|Great product
B00O17FFYY|1|The picture makes these lamps look blue. They are quite yellow. If you are looking for blue lamps you will probably want something in the 6500K plus range. These lamps are only 5000K. I ordered this expecting something of fairly high quality. The wiring harness is assembled with electrical tape. The unit I received did not have the wires assembled with the correct male/female connecters at the correct ends. The main fog bulbs worked but the &#34;Angel Eye&#34; rings did not. Fortunately, the vendor offered a full refund of my purchase and shipping costs. Still, I am out $10 for the return shipping. Probably the vendor should have checked it for proper operation before sending.
B0076AUA48|1|It did not fit...
B00QFT09WE|5|Thanks
B00E9BE3PO|5|Love these and the price little tough to put in put have patience!
B0042VTYXM|5|I bought these for my wife and I. Pretty cool I have to say. Very light, however you do notice it on your key-ring. Other than that, if it could save the life of myself, my wife or someone else, then I don't mind noticing it on my key-ring.
B002QAOBBQ|4|Looks good and fit fine. The double back tape that holds down the top surface is not a strong as I would like, but the clips that GM used for OEM is too big of a hassle. It's just fine, thanks.
B002CV1OA0|5|I went with this after buying a K&N air filter and then the Cobra slip on pipe. With just the air filter, this wasn't necessary. But once the pipe was added, my bike was definitely running too lean. Many have said that a fuel tuner isn't necessary. But, with how hot my bike was running, and the amount of back firing, it definitely is very necessary. I do live in Salt Lake, which the lowest point I believe is 4200 feet above sea level, so that may have contributed. I would have loved their auto tuner version, but, my budget didn't allow for that. So went with this, and I have no regrets what so ever. Back firing has virtually been eliminated and engine now running at a temp that doesn't have me constantly concerned. I have retained my fuel mileage while getting the power that a 1300 should have. I did have to slightly adjust from what they had set this at. But, install and adjustment was only 2-3 hours including test rides to see how it was running. Again, others said not necessary, but seeing how much better it runs with it, well worth it.
B0012PVA2E|5|OEM Replacement. Identical to one I took off 1998 Cadillac Deville without electronic leveling except there is no backup to tighten the nut. I carefully used vice grips at very top of piston to get to required torque. You will need a good spring compressor to disassemble/assemble. Make sure you put the left strut back together with the left spring/bearing assembly. It make a difference, if you want to put the left spring/bearing back on the left side.
B002P36OMI|2|it did not adhere to polypropylene as well as I had hoped
B0043063JU|4|Looks nice. Good quality. Not super heavy duty but serves the purpose
B008HZNOEY|5|Excellent
B000N2U5E6|5|Worked great, like they always do! We always call and tell them what we are working on, they tell us what part number. Works and fits perfect every time!
B00OTBCIRE|5|love it
B001CQWM8E|5|A
B0076YE4QO|4|Worked well enough to go from Louisiana through the Great Smokey Mountains, and back. Rack was secure through seven states of travel so it gets an, A++ there. The rubber feet were hard to stay on until strapped down, and the straps interfered with me sitting up while driving.
B000RNW5HQ|5|Perfect fit for 2008 Odyssey.  Easily fit right into place.  Very well made.
B000WE48SO|1|OE Replacement Mazda Left Tail Lamp Assembly - CAPA Certified. THIS IS a headlamp for  01-04 Toyota RAV4. Please change the description.
B005FN2F5U|1|Not a premium fabric at all!  Very disappointed with material and fit for Subaru Forester. Threw back seat covers in the trash. Headrest covers are terrible!
B003SZ3GK0|1|still sqeeks. unknown reasons new part and just as bad as the original.
B00BHD6HNI|5|Fit perfectly into the cupholder
B003U53JYG|5|So far I have been sing this as a quick detailer but mainly as a drying lubricant. It helps remove the water after a wash and it worked really well. I really like this product and I am sure in the winter I will use this as a waterless wash.
B00W2OSK7C|5|Easy to install. Perfect fit. Looks great. Sturdy thick rubber construction.
B000BUU5YA|5|Good to have if you just want to run your lights and TV or whatever will run on 15 amps.  Not for running your AC!!
B0012ETJ1O|4|Great, so far. Needed to replace burnt out sylvania silverstar bulb that lasted over 7 years. We'll see how long this one lasts. Don't really do much night driving but had occasion to use it the other night and the light output was great.
B00Z3N8GGY|5|Great sunshade. Fits my TJ better than the beat up spider sunshade it replaced. This covers the back seat just to the edge and doesn't interfere with my sight line. My old one had to be folded back because it blocked the view. The material looks to be of better quality than my old one too. Sunshades like this are a lifesaver (ok, head saver) here in AZ. I can leave my hard top off for longer periods and not bleach my interior. Then when I do put the top back on, no need to remove this one as it sits inside the rollbar cage.
B000CMFQ0A|5|My husband said it works.  Fast shipping.
B004UM6DLE|5|I had this iron dust on my car for more than a year now, I couldn't find anything that can get rid of it until i came across this product, so i gave it a shot and it worked! Kudos to those Korean people who made this product 👍🏻
B005OV274W|1|The only reason this is getting a bad is because of the pin placement. I also ordered a Hella socket. The socket is wired for a standard European relay with the large wires across from each other for terminals 30 & 87, and the small wires also across from each other for terminals 85 & 86. This relay is pinned so that the are next to each other resulting in terminal 30 being located at the small grounding wire.<br /><br />The relay will work just fine so long as you write it properly and is a very nice item with the fuse being wired directly at the terminology 30 input, it just does not mate to thier standard socket.
B004G9VIXE|5|as desctibed, body shop installed and working great.<br /><br />Thanks<br />Howard
B004V4ENGI|5|Good product, looks nice, lights nicely, just hope it holds up under the constant  vibration of the road.

B001CF1A7O|5|Very Heavy duty hitch.  Solid all the way through
B001PNPSZ8|5|Good quality.  Perfect fit.  Easy install.
B001CF1A6U|5|Very Heavy Duty... Worth the money

B00W635Z3Q|1|The box said they fit a 2002 to a 2005 Dodge Ram 1500 SLT. I tried to install them and they do not fit. They look like they go to the 2006 and up.
B008BWGK6M|1|GOOD PRODUCT'
B00P1O9O16|5|Great value! Too long for my small car but easy to trim soft rubber. I wish it was a little wider but otherwise perfect.
B005GOM2I8|5|Works as advertised. Installed 3 weeks ago so far so good.
B007ND4P0S|1|Left bulb was so much brighter then the left.
B00EW3DEUE|5|easy to installand working well now no leak
B003NHVEV6|5|Ridiculously easy to install after watching the video tutorial. Very good price. I still can't believe I installed them all by myself and saved whatever the dealer would have charged me to install the lifts (which I'm sure would have been a lot). Shipping from vendor was very fast. I am thrilled with this purchase and highly recommend.
B0038KM1HO|5|Excellent Fit, Finish, Packaging, & Look! This is a great addition to anyone's FJ Crusier that has Chrome Exterior Parts. Not Cheap looking & looks well made! Great Price!
B000GU3KHE|5|But beware, it is really not a long-term solution.  You get what you pay for, and I tend to need a new one of these every year.
B001FRE1E8|5|Thanks. A hard to fine item prior to internet shopping.
B00VJ4LHUS|5|I just love this trash bag + organizer! I have been in the market for a new car trash bag since I got rid of our previous one. I just stumbled upon this item and I was super excited!! It is well made and is very functional. I love that it has a designated spot for a box of kleenex. I think I will use the side cup holder for a container of hand-wipes. I lined the garbage bag with small kitchen garbage bags. I also stored extra garbage bags in the small pocket on the top front. It was super easy to install and I couldn't be more excited! The only constructive feedback I have regarding this product is that I wish the trash bag portion was a little bit deeper/bigger. I don't think it's worth taking a star away. I will just have to empty the bag more often, but that's totally doable. Other than that, I think it's perfect! My daughter (who is 6) thinks this is HERS, so I might have to get one that is just mine :)<br /><br />I received this product at a discount, in exchange for my honest feedback. I would have happily paid full price for this car trash bag + organizer. In fact, I paid $13.57 for my previous car trash bag and it was not even close to being as nice of quality as this bag. My other one was also not waterproof, nor did it have any of the extras that this bag has. So...basically, I overpaid for a lesser quality item.
B00KQXKG46|5|The light was super brite and high quality the light has been on my truck for a few mounths and it still works as good as the day I got it I would fully recommend this light. The light has a 200yard range and a really wide viewing angle
B0032H6WNW|3|I gave this top a 3/5 because, while it serves its purpose, it also has some major drawbacks.<br /><br />The good: It keeps the wind and rain out, and it'll keep you from getting sunburned from being in the car for extended periods of time.<br /><br />The mediocre: Going with the solid black instead of a mesh top means, with full doors and windows up, it almost feels like you're riding with a soft top on. For some people that may not be a bad thing, but I like the wind in my hair, so I was a little disappointed, but I just keep the windows rolled down, and I think the tradeoff is worth it. This top would pair better with half doors or no doors though.<br /><br />The bad: The straps holding the top on, especially the ones in the back, are weak and flimsy. At highway speeds they quickly come loose, causing the top to flap violently in the wind. I ended up completely removing the back straps from the the plastic cinch on down, and replacing them with cam straps. Since then I haven't had any issues with excessive flapping, though the top does still flap a little, but that's to be expected.<br /><br />Bottom line: If you get this top, either don't use it at highway speeds, or replace the back straps with something stronger. Otherwise, it works well as a sun/wind shade.
B00D29P5CO|4|Pretty good, easier to put on than other reviews suggested.  Covers up my handle to recline seat though but also covers up dirty seats.
B00YEEP0J4|3|Had to bend one side slightly to fit. For the price they appear to be okay. Smaller than I would like and I will probally replace them next year because they bearly extend past the gear sift and break levers.
B009YH70CQ|5|Thank you. Worked just fine.
B00029WRMI|5|out of all the side mirrors I have installed, this was the easiest and most respectful when it comes to money prioritization.
B000W0OFZ4|4|It's a nice lock and the cable is OK. Fits around larger posts, which is useful for locking the bike to street signs and such. The only con is that it rattles a lot and pretty loud while you bike -- I thought I mounted it wrong, but I got it looked at and that's just the way it is. Mounting it was simple on my relatively small frame.
B00MJLCV5U|5|Perfect

B00G3L1GQC|5|Great product.. Works great..
B00INZ65B2|5|Excellent, got it in 3 days. Took about a hour to replace the motors. The tool and solder that came with the kit helped out perfect. I recommend this kit for anybody with this problem.

B004K72CAU|1|not right part 03 cav
B00MWAT3MM|5|I have used this jacket through 2 seasons of back country riding.. It has been through rain, sleet and blizzards. I have always stayed bone dry and warm with light thermals underneath (I've ridden down to -25F) and even opened the vents on sub zero, chest deep powder days.. The mesh on the vents does effectively keep the snow out of the jacket, the fleece lined side pockets also have waterproof zippers. After trying out a few other brands, this is by far the best jacket I have ever had by a long shot.<br /><br />There's been multiple &#34;non bluebird&#34; days that have been cut short or miserable for my buddies, due to wet and/or cold.. This jacket gives you the ability to be the one saying &#34;It's really not that bad.&#34;
B000WJ7S5Y|5|Great filter good price
B00SRY6O2E|4|I received the product as promised but it didn't fit my lugs.  According to what I read, it should have.  I'll have to figure that one out.  Other than that it seems well made and I would buy another if I found the correct size.....

B008B4M4QA|5|worked just fine....
B00M9DCMNE|5|Perfect for a relocated license plate
B00BCRMAAS|4|I purchased two sets of these car seat covers. One for my SUV and another for my husband's car. We've had them on for a week now and they still look great. The colors of the black/green are bold and impressive. The gray/black are nice and go well with any blck/gray interior. The grey is very much like the picture. My husband installed the covers and stated that it was a little challenging using the metal hooks provided to get a good fit. One of the loops did break on one of the seat covers but he tied it into a loop to make it work. The material is breathable and thin. The fit on both our cars front seats is fantastic however the backseats are loose or ill fitting in some areas. I believe this is to be expected in a universal fit cover and that with a little attention they can look better. They stay in place well and overall I am pleased with this purchase. The steering wheel cover fits tight and doesn't add a lot of bulk which is nice. There were no armrest covers however we used a headrest cover that was extra to cover them and it worked great.<br /><br />I purchased this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review of the item and the opinions expressed here are my own.
B001AMEFAI|5|These Strut Mounts are needed to do a complete front strut repair on a GM &#34;W body&#34;... in addition to...<br />2each Gabriel G44459 Ultra Strut Cartridges ; 2each Gabriel 142143 Strut Mounts (top) ; 2each Gabriel 143060 Front Strut Cushion & Bellows ;<br />1 pkg of 2each Moog K6641 Front Sway Bar Bushings ; and some new Ball Joints.<br />&#62;&#62;This Gabriel 143036 Strut Mount is for the left side, but has a wrong picture.&#60;&#60;<br />Note that Gabriel 143037 Strut Mount is for the right side and has the right picture... attached correct picture.<br />These 2 Gabriel Strut Mounts are the spring seats/mounts for the bottom of the front springs.<br />I have notified Gabriel customer service that, even on their website, Gabriel 143036 has the wrong picture.
B000VU56Z8|5|Great price and fit for my 2014 Lariat with a 6 1/2 foot bed.
B00IKPES2S|4|This part fit my 1998 Toyota Sienna very well.  Color slightly off from pic and original color, but not outlandishly so.
B00BCRMC1U|3|They are cute. However to make them fit so they weren't really loose i had to take my back seat out tohook it tight. I took off the side lever panels on the front seat to tighten them down then reassembled the car. A lot of work to make it look like they fit but in the end it looks very nice.
B0009IQZJS|1|Did not fit
B00FF1K7BQ|5|Chemical Guys rock.  The best and a little goes a long way.
B008NA8NI0|5|Came like stated. Looks great. Works great
B006028WJ8|5|Great product and very bright. Love them. Simple splice and hook up to + and - wires.
B001NHCFVQ|5|Great product.. Works great..
B004UQR08K|5|Great, wouldn't use anything else.
B00D9C2CDO|5|I really recommend this item!!!
B00T2XIRFQ|5|It was Excellent very nice tools i ever had for Washing car
B00VYX2I7A|2|The mesh showed in the picture is not the same as the product sent. They sent me one with the plastic screen molded as one with the grill itself, and not made in steel.
B00EL37R8U|5|Good lamps, here early
B00B74XTR4|5|Have had it on for a year now. Thru one winter and the heat of the summer. Still looks good as new.
B008M1WK7A|5|Great products, they fit so nicely in my new subaru crosstrek! Looking now for the rain gaurds for thewindows!!!!!!
B00HDT08D0|4|Well made.
B00BVB3CPW|5|My car's heater & AC would only work if I set the blower speed to high.  This part fixed it perfectly!  Installation is very easy.  (The part goes behind the glove compartment.)
B008032ST0|5|better than excellent
B00CPSRZ12|5|I have a Class A 36ft Motorhome. These cover the complete front of the RV. The only thing that sun is coming thru are the tiny sections where the window wraps around the sides. I just am so pleased with this product. The temperature difference alone is amazing. Would buy this again.
B000KKLLFS|5|VERY HAPPY WITH THEM
B000VBABHA|5|good product a little bit expensive
B00842A7F4|5|Great price
B003EOTMVC|3|This piece didn't fit with the rest of the JBA 2.5&#34; cat-back exhaust.  After the 2 into 1 Y-section, the single pipe pointed down.  I had to have about a 12 inch piece cut off and new piping welded in so that it would align with the rest of the exhaust system.
B00MC6H0AI|5|These are great. Amazed at the light output. A custom set of reverse mounted offroad lights would make more light but these are so good I'm not going to bother. I had Silver Stars in before and the difference is night and day, literally!<br />I've had them in 6 weeks and leave for work early every day in the dark and no longer curse my tinted windows.
B00D8RYGOI|5|This thing is BRIGHT!  I had to return it because my push bar's pre drilled holes weren't just perfect for it.  This is not Eyourlife's fault at all, and they returned my money within 24 hours.  If you're looking to get a light bar, and this one fits what you're doing, you will NOT be disappointed.
B002MEVZRO|5|Sounds great and just the right sound. Added a AEM COLD AIR INTAKE and makes it sound even better.
B004A6GPS6|5|Did it myself and it is working great so far.  You can go to You Tube to get installation video.  The hardest part for me was getting the oil and transmission lines loose at the bottom of the old radiator.  Don't pull just twist until they release.  I have a 2002 Infiniti I35.  You might need new nuts at the top of the radiator.  Just go to the hardware store ($1-$2).  Man, this was just as easy as everyone before me stated.  Also, be gentle when taking out old radiator because most of the parts are plastic.
B001LC73GU|3|In the description of the product, it tells me that it is compatible with my 1998 4runner and I guess it is but after installation (not a simple procedure), lights didn't work on low beams. Work on hi beams, but I seldom use hi beam if I do...It probably work with some other vehicles of course but definitely did not work with mine. I give it a 3 star just because it was not a &#34;plug and play&#34; but rather a &#34;plug and pray&#34; and even then still didn't work. Waste of my effort.
B0055AW0N0|5|Wonderful!
B00E8KIQOK|5|Great product.
B0002SR88C|5|This is a great scraper for getting stickers and paint off of windows or other hard surfaces
B0002NILRO|5|I loved this steering wheel.I bought one when I 16yrs. old for my first car. I finally threw it away last week.I am 27 now. It still had it's color just finally broke.
B008SX2D7E|1|Installed neatly and correctly, cleaned area, held in place for 24 hours just to be safe. Fell off while driving. Complete waste of time and money
B008DJEKS8|4|This was much larger and beefier than I expected, it's hard to tell how big it is from the pictures. I guess the 2 inch description refers to being compatible with 2&#34; straps.  The overall dimensions are about 4&#34; on a side.<br /><br />I purchased this to tension an outdoor volleyball net (permanent installation) and I think that it will work OK as long as I don't put too large a crank on it. With enough leverage I think this thing would bend my 4&#34; Steel poles!
B00NIKN2BS|5|I use these to remove/ install my motorcycles tires.
B007Y886ZW|1|I thought I'd gotten a good deal on a new alternator for my 98camaro but nope I got sent the wrong one it doesn't fit at alfor, and does not match the picture in the  posting, or my original alternator for my car as shown in the photos I posted with this review,  I depend on my car a lot and was looking forward to getting it running again,  I don't even know what vehicle the one I received is for.
B007HRYHDA|1|Product image and description imply complete unit not the case.
B008BT4TCM|5|Installed these in mt 2012 Forrester and they are a perfest fit! The covers look great and they seem to be of high quality.
B00AC6VPY2|1|These are crap don't buy them
B012HD52EQ|1|This image is stolen. I know this, because I'm the one who designed it. If you want to buy the real thing, go here http://www.cafepress.com/stargazerdesign.1611992590
B00UMS4P4W|5|Absolutely love it! It came earlier than expected and extremely happy with this product!
B009YVBB9U|5|Works perfect.  A great assistance for us extra large people. Has good construction.
B00NWF84HQ|5|happy with purchase
B008XB9BJY|5|These are just the warmer color temperature that I wanted, and a bit brighter than the 1141's they replaced in my RV lighting.  Only less than .2 amps draw.  I may try the larger 5watt one for a couple places where i want more task light.
B00FSCEEM0|1|Did NOT work! Poor poor quality! Never again
B001FLSMI0|4|Fast shipping and fit great on my 2007 Suzuki Forenza. Cant beat the price. I hope they last
B000HEBR3I|5|Small gas engine gas filling is great.  Also use with diesel fuel for a Kubota tractor.
B001C97V4Q|5|Perfect, Just what I needed,
B004C444RU|5|I got these gloves for my husband and he loves them
B00BVB8OXC|4|perfect fit
B0023VDOWA|5|Fit perfect. No troubles!
B00CPGGZNS|5|Best light that I have ever owned..... Had a Talon paid $250 for it and I think this light here beats it out in brightness so glad I got this I will be buying more soon
B00546CNC8|5|I have a 2014 Toyota Sequoia and it fit perfect. Exactly what I was looking for.
B00COOSF98|5|Let me start off by saying that I'm fairly Novice at Electrical and I was a bit worried when I ordered this headlight kit.  Once I got the kit and pulled out the instructions my worries we're pretty ugh gone.  The only thing I needed to worry about was where to place the Balasts.  The Wiring was Specific for my vehicle and took me less than 25 mins total to do Both Headlights.  I purchased the 6000k ultra white kit which is AMAZING.  the clarity from these blew away Fords stock Yellow bulbs.  I will never switch back.  So far I'm about a little over a month into using them and no issues what so ever.  If you are thinking of converting to HID, this kit as long as it fits your specific vehicle,  is the best product at this Price point.  My buddy paid $239 for his kit a year ago and I can't tell a difference between ours honestly.  Best $40 I've spent in a while.  BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!
B00068XCQU|5|Excellent battery maintainer for a great price!
B001V8RYTA|3|A lot smaller than I expected.
B003YJCE9E|5|works as described, came 1n 3 days, great service and great product
B00897NVXO|1|These break pads glides when hitting the break pedal. Absolutely no stopping power.
B004GCAKCG|3|It was a great price. With that being said it was packaged a bit poorly and it had a few scuff marks from shipping. When putting this on my 02 Silverado I really had to take my time and work with it. After 15 minutes of install it looked great. My advice is take  your time and it will go on. A rubber hammer helped with this.
B000C9LBHK|1|the spring and the pintle were broken in the box I did not use it.
B0040CYWX0|4|works great
B003SZW5CK|5|Great product.  Less than half the cost of dealer product.  Easy to install and perfect fit.
B001N2O3PM|5|No need explain Just buy it
B007V4WXYE|5|It's an iron ring.  What could be wrong with it?
B00309U940|5|Just fine.  As advertised.
B005JPJMI2|5|Great product. If you like to keep your car shiny between full waxes then this the the product for you.
B009BAC4J0|5|Yep.....it sure is.
B006FUT15Y|5|Works like a charm....no more  'cataracts' on my ride.
B00N2ZFR0I|5|works just fine.
B00MJ40XGG|5|Great on my Jeep. we use it strictly for off road and you will get soaked without these and this allows nice air to circulate in the rain, NO FOGGY WINDOWS!!
B002ZTK932|5|These are really nice, especially with hauling the grandkids in bad weather.
B00T6J8P94|4|I like it.  I need a bag quick and I did not find one locally so I tried this one.  It did work on my 2006 V-Strom, it fit the tank just fine and was not too worried about it departing at interstate speeds...( I did hook the front of the bag to a strap just to make sure, but was not needed)  I do wish the inside had more organizing features like mesh pockets on BOTH sides and the front as well.  The exit port for the water tube should have a way to cover up or block it.  I did find a couple of small items trying to work their way out.  Im looking at using a piece of Velcro over the port like my old tank bag did for the media port.  I think I am going to try and order the GPS/Cell phone mount that goes over the Map Case to see who that work out in the organizing department.<br />I did like the side pockets and found them useful
B000EQ84NA|4|It should get 5 stars...because for the price this was an excellent filter...but now I've become a filter snob and use K&N...if you want cheap, get it!
B006R98DGG|1|Does NOT MATCH Jeep billet even tho the paint code is the same! I got a rock ding from the lawnmower and the paint touch up looks like molen aluminum. Nothing like the dark metallic grey of the billet color.
B004654ZU6|4|Expensive, but solid construction, does the job.  Don't sweat using the template, it is horrid.  Breathe, line pick the placement that is most visually pleasing to you on the case and then drill.  Would recommend mounting while the topbox is attached to the motorcycle.
B000FGIBYQ|4|With it came with some double sided tape though
B00HD50BEK|5|beautiful lights and fast ship
B00AN6B7OO|5|Works great for keeping items from rolling around in the trunk.  Easy to install and easily detached when not in use.  I leave the bottom hooks attached and the top can be attached quickly when needed.
B0006IX7UQ|5|product is as advertised
B00B0C29I8|5|A little noisey but works good
B0028JW4PU|5|All you will ever need.  The suv &#34;post&#34; removes easily so you can use this with a regular height vehicle.
B00WNA0UXW|5|Very happy with the product and the manufacturer!
B00029KCWK|1|I should have listened to a viewer above.  Big mistake.  This is a Scrap of fabric with a big &#34;S&#34;.  The stainless Zip ties are impossible to use.  What a rip off!  That is the truth.  Go to HOME DEPOT  and get better product.
B000BUTD9S|4|spring isn't great but for the price it works.  I would buy it again.
B00020CB2S|5|I installed this in the cab of my 1998 Ford F-150. It has reduced road noise by quite a lot. Before install I did a sound test, and afterwards I performed the same test. Idling, driving at 40mph, and at 65mph on highway. This material reduced noise by 10 decibels while driving around, and 15 decibels while idling. I ordered a couple of boxes to cover the metal surfaces underneath the interior of my cab. It took about twelve hours total to properly remove the interior panels and apply the material to the metal. I also applied this to the floor boards after removing the seats and the rubber floor. This does shift to fit contours and grooves. I recommend applying as large of a piece as possible wherever you can. There were places I did have to custom cut the sheets to fit. If I were to knock on the bed of my truck, and then the door, you can hear the difference. Also there is an aluminum tape from dynamat available. I do recommend getting that at least for the floor boards. In order to help keep moisture from getting between the cuts and edges of the install.
B005C5BFDO|5|Exact OEM Yamaha part
B004TRKBOK|5|easily fits in the side-panel of my door for easy access if I ever need it
B009OLMH7A|4|A little tight, and it doesn't keep dust out at all so is unsuitable for the kind of offroading I do. I intend to try it as a street helmet at some point.
