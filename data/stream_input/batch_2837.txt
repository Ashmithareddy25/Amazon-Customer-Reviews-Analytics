B004GHNIRK|4.0|The story of Jean ValJean is wonderful.  I was riveted when the story focused on his story.  Unfortunately, there was a lot of very detailed description of, for example, the battle of Waterloo, people of the era, convents, the history of the Paris sewer system, all of which is interesting and he intertwines with the Jean Valjean story but it added a tremendous amount of volume that I could have done without.
B00E8JZILA|3.0|First, I will say that you can get this game on Playstation Network store for $19.99 if you're okay with the digital copy.  Okay, getting into the review.  I haven't played it much.  The game looks pretty good on the Vita, but it has hitches.  There are some frame rate issues.<br /><br />The game can be played with either touch controls or device.  I chose to play touch to start, but I didn't like it so I changed to device and found that much better.<br /><br />I haven't played the console or pc version of this game because it's a point and click adventure book.  I find it to be much more appealing on a mobile device, like the Vita.  It's something that I can pick up and play whilst on the go easily.  The best part of the game is probably the story, I mean it's The Walking Dead.  So, it should be entertaining.<br /><br />Just be aware that if you don't want the physical copy, you can save $5, and that it does have performance issues.
B004LX0D36|5.0|I admit to being an Austen fan and this is one of the best.  I have read this several times and will read it again.  The characters are so interesting, the story is classic and I so need the quality and elegance of a story like this especially with all the violence of most TV or movies.  I am transformed when I read this and Austen's other beautiful stories and I intend to continue to re-read them often.
B00C8USQEM|5.0|I got my blu-ray set yesterday and with all those negative reviews I was anxious to test them out.  I was worried because I had seen reviews saying that the set was pirated (bootleg) and that they would not work in anything except a region-free blu-ray player, and blah, blah, blah.  THIS SET IS BRAND-NEW!!! IT IS NOT PIRATED AND IT WORKS FINE IN A U.S. REGION BLU-RAY PLAYER!!!  And to be honest, my blu-ray player is at least 3 years old...and it probably hasn't been updated in a year...Whatever the blu-rays work and the picture looks great.  I would highly recommend this seller (a2z Blu Ray) and this set to anyone.  It was an awesome deal!  $65.00 for the first 5 seasons...that easily would've been $100 if purchased separately.  If I find anything wrong with it by the time I make it through my 5 season binge this weekend I'll update my review but I doubt I will find anything.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|Is great, i love it, is nice, elegant and at same time sport, just what i was searching for, and i  like the mecanical system of energy that has,  If were a little bit bigger in size would be perfect, but would cost more money, so is really good, i like a lot.<br /><br /> Thanks

B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Bought this on a whim without knowing a thing about the author or the book, just that it was an Irish tale, of which I am fond.  Thoroughly enjoyed the read.  I loved the character of Jamie, & everything Rose said made me smile.  I ordered another by Ms McKenna & am looking forward to it.  I'll recommend this to my book club buddies for sure.
1451695195|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this book, gives you encouragment that there is, indeed, life after death.  The only criticism, if only a small one, is that there are a couple of sections where he explains medically what is going on (or not going on) his brain.  Though I'm sure he explained it as simply as possible, in layman terms, I and two other other readers just didn't get that part.  Not to deter from the overall good read of this book.

B003G4W49C|5.0|Definitely a different book from my usual fare. I picked it up mostly to get the story before the movie comes out. I was immediately drawn into the dramatic plot surrounding Ender and his military education.

B00CATSONE|4.0|This book tells a lot about the thinking behind one of the most brilliant mind, the paths he took and why? Though I found it to be little short ( the book is pretty short ) of what could have been told about this great man, but still it does a good job of explaining how the people who changed the world thought and did the stuff. You have quite a few things to imbibe if you agree with the explanations.

B00C2FFJFM|5.0|Stars Dance is Selena's best album, no doubt. I was skeptical at first about whether it could top her debut, Kiss & Tell, but a few more listens and I was convinced. Every song is pure pop perfection. This is an album Britney Spears or Rihanna could put out. I can't think of any songs that fall flat. My favorites are Birthday, Come & Get It, and Forget Forever. Even the album's sole ballad, Love Will Remember, soars gracefully and isn't too slow. Overall, Selena did an amazing job with this album and it completely trumps her other releases. 10/10

B001O96JC4|5.0|I'm going to keep this simple.<br />Nosferatu is the original film piece based on Bram Stoker's 'Dracula' (enough said there for the plot and characters). This is a silent film paired with an organic often chilling score. Although it is not what anyone now days would consider scary, this movie strikes a deeper cord thanks to the black and white grain, stronger conveyance of emotion through physical acting and with it's original costuming. Personally, with Nosferatu and many other black and white horror films, I find it hard not to romanticize them. The \\"monsters\\" of these films although often getting a repulsive and frightening reaction still foster some speckle of a human trait that just makes you fall in love with them, IMO something that horror movies now days almost always lack.<br /><br />Watch this, you just cannot go wrong with a classic such as Nosferatu. If you cannot get into silent films play a game with a friend and see who can be the most theatrical when reading the narrative boards!<br /><br />As for DVDs, I recommend the Kino version.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game.  I've been playing it for 8 months and love the graphics.  Every new animal, decoration, and fun object is a pleasant surprise.  I can't wait for the new items.

0061537969|5.0|After picking this book up and setting it back on the shelf for literally years, I sat down and read it with brief breaks nearly non-stop.  The reluctance to read it was right at the front of the book:  Enzo was dying, he knew it, and he was waiting patiently for his person to come home and release him.<br />When tears are shed in the first chapter, how can one read on?<br />This is a perfect book.  Enzo is neither too anthropomorphic nor too dumbed down dog.  He has a straightforward style, with a keen eye to all the situations around him, and his struggle to understand human beings while believing he should be able to be human lends a slant to his story that truly sets it apart from many \\"dog tales\\".  Stein neither over-sentimentalizes nor minimizes the depths of loss and the shared joys of Enzo and his family.<br />Yes,the dog dies.  His family is torn asunder, he is often apart from his family and the things he most cherishes (while staying with his person's friends, his favorite toy gets washed!), and changes have to be accepted.<br />Enzo is a good dog, who has a good life, and a nice surprise.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|I loved the movie - so nice to watch something that you know is so totally unbelievable - and yet have the good guys win!
6305128952|5.0|I choose five stars because this movie held my attention throughout, that is very unusual for me.  I usually give out long before the movie is over.  I thought the plot a little slow at times, but I wanted to watch it to the end.  The ending was sad, but actually was more like real life, there is not always a happy ending.  Well worth your time, if you like the older movies.
B0039YZPZ4|3.0|With the BBC version being made I think everyone else should just work on something else. Too much Hollywood, not enough substance.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|Very hard to follow and get into.  Just because it is weird doesn't make it art or good.  Never even finished it.
B00DFRVAC2|5.0|It's been a long time since I've been interested in movie music, but hearing these tracks at the movie certainly changed my mind! Each track fits perfectly with the scenes they play in and, even if you're not watching the movie, hearing them lets you relive it easily.<br /><br />Anyway, I highly recommend a listen!
B005544TRQ|5.0|This is one of the best shows on ! Smart dialog, great acting and tjhe legal scenes are rally there to move the character along their storylines, rather than the other way around.<br /><br />SEE IT NOW!!!
B004KPX4W2|5.0|For whatever reason, I've always found Bruce Willis to be at his best when he is playing the droll super-hero.  Such is the case in &#34;Red&#34; and I thought this was one of his better movies of the recent past.  Granted, I say this without having seen a lot of his more current releases.<br /><br />In this particular case, the movie is a bit slow to develop and you are wondering what's supposed to happen.  Needless to say, as with all action movies, what does take place is not always plausible; and, in this case, as the story develops there are a lot of complexities which are difficult to piece together and which raise a lot of questions which somehow suddenly get answered at the end.  That said, the movie is a fun &#34;jaunt&#34; with a lot of action.  I can't wait for the video release of &#34;Red2&#34;.
B003TOMAPC|5.0|Hilariously violent.  Hit Girl is a huge hit.  The Special Features are also worth checking out to hear the director's efforts in getting the film made in the first place.

B00AKS12PE|4.0|The Two Towers picks up immediately from the end of The Fellowship of the Ring and makes no concessions to newcomers: no 'story so far', no opening crawl and only a couple of brief flashbacks. Like so much with the Lord of the Rings movie trilogy this was a risk but one that paid off, with the film gaining immense financial and critical success.<br /><br />The film has much to recommend it. As with the first movie, it benefits from an excellent cast that gets even better in this film with the likes of Bernard Hill, Miranda Otto, Karl Urban, Andy Serkis, David Wenham and Brad Dourif joining proceedings (viewers of the Extended Edition also get an early chance to meet the excellent John Noble as Denethor). Little criticism can be made of the cast and their evident enthusiasm for the project and this helps carry the film over the bumps in the road. As with the first movie, the effects are excellent and even better than before, with Weta Digital clearly emboldened with confidence after their work on the first film. The stand-out is Gollum, the most stunning digital creature creation to date (and so he remains). Between the animators, Andy Serkis's superb performance and the reactions of his co-stars, Gollum is brought to life and utterly convinces you he is there in the film.<br /><br />The set design and miniature work is also excellent, with Edoras and particularly Helm's Deep being extraordinary creations. This informs the Battle of Helm's Deep, the stand-out battle of the trilogy and one of the most stunning engagements ever depicted on film. Jackson films the battle with dynamism and allows viewers to follow the geography and ebb and flow of the battle with clarity. He also holds back on the CGI as much as possible to focus on scenes of actors engaging in actual combat and some excellent use of miniatures (particularly when the Deeping-wall is breached).<br /><br />However, the film is not quite as successful as Fellowship. The biggest problem is inherited from the book, with the action split three ways between three different groups of characters. Tolkien decided that switching back and forth would be distracting, so he held back Frodo and Sam's storyline and did it all at once. Jackson is forced to switch back and forth and this is indeed not as successful as might be hoped, with carefully-built tension dissipating as we move to another storyline at a moment of tension. This problem is enhanced by the fact that a large chunk of Frodo and Sam's storyline has been held back for the third movie (where it does actually belong, chronologically), including the infamous cliffhanger ending. This forces Jackson and his team to introduce new material to fill the void. This results in the infamous 'weakening of Faramir' arc where Faramir first decides to give the Ring to his father and then changes his mind. The problem isn't so much the idea - giving Faramir more to do and more of an arc is not necessarily a bad idea in itself - but the logic. It is unconvincing that Faramir, having started to fall under the Ring's influence, would then back up and let Frodo go with it. The book approach (where Faramir avoids being influenced by it at all) is less 'dramatic' but makes more sense.<br /><br />Merry and Pippin also suffer from the structural issues, though this is inherited from the book. Whilst Aragorn and company engage in political issues in Rohan and fight off Saruman's forces (twice in the movie) in epic battles, Merry and Pippin spend most of the film on the shoulders of a giant ambulatory tree talking about stuff for hours on end. The actors do their best, but it's hard to suppress a groan when the action cuts to another scene of Treebeard talking in extreme slow motion. It also doesn't help that the Entmoot lacks the grandeur of the book and their storyline then suffers a major believability collapse when the Ents seem to be unaware that Saruman was burning down their own forest (and Treebeard can then summon an entire Ent armyto him instantly). It's only at the end, during the assault on Isengard, that their storyline really kicks into life. However, there's not much helping the interminable Elrond/Arwen scenes or the pointless 'Aragorn falls off a cliff' interlude.<br /><br />Still, whilst the weaknesses niggle, the sheer scale of the movie, the splendid cast and effects and the epic impact of the battle for Helm's Deep cannot fail but impress.<br /><br />The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (****) is not the instant classic its predecessor was, but remains a highly watchable and entertaining movie.<br /><br />Note on the Extended Edition: As with its predecessor, The Two Towers was re-issued as an Extended Edition a year after its original release. The Extended Edition adds approximately 40 minutes of new material to the movie. These include more scenes with Merry and Pippin (some of which fortunately do not involve riding around on Treebeard) and more material for Frodo, Sam, Gollum and Faramir. This, happily, has the effect of balancing out the three big storylines in the film and makes them feel more of equal weight. The highlight of the Extended Edition is a great flashback scene uniting Boromir, Faramir and Denethor on screen which helps explain their dysfunctional family dynamics much better than dialogue alone ever could. Despite the greater length, the Extended Edition of The Two Towers actually feels shorter by improving the pacing between the three storylines and adds some excellent new scenes. Accordingly, the Extended Edition (****½) is the definitive version of the film and is recommended over the cinematic cut.to him instantly).

B00CKYHH6O|5.0|Star Trek: The Next Generation entered its fourth season riding the crest of a wave. Despite the extremely difficult circumstances it had been written and filmed under, the third season had been given a near-unanimously positive critical reception and the Best of Both Worlds cliffhanger had become a major TV event of the year. The production team thus started the fourth season with confidence and even a bit of swagger to their step and this translated into assured and confident episodes hitting the air.<br /><br />One of the most noticeable changes in the fourth season is the great embracing of continuity. The fourth season episodes bring back Data's evil brother Lore and address the ongoing Klingon story arc begun in Sins of the Father in the third season. Worf becomes a father, Wesley Crusher departs for the Academy and LaForge comes face-to-face with the real woman about who he's constructed a holodeck fantasy. Lt. Barclay, Vash and Q return, and the events of an episode that no-one can remember, Yesterday's Enterprise, have unexpected major consequences as the season draws to a conclusion. Major new forces also appear, most notably the race known as the Cardassians who will go on to have a massive impact on the Trek universe in future seasons and in the Deep Space Nine spin-off show. The fourth season feels like more part of an interconnected whole rather than 26 random stories thrown together and this works very well.<br /><br />This isn't to say that every episode is a home run. The Best of Both Worlds, Part II actually resolves the Borg threat in a manner that makes sense but the story is a little too big for the episode and doesn't quite pay off the promises of the Season 3 finale. Suddenly Human has Picard disobeying orders from Starfleet with no consequence, which is odd. Remember Me is terrible (disappointing for a rare Dr. Crusher-centric episode). Devil's Due is played for laughs and doesn't work. Clues is an inferior remake of a much better Red Dwarf episode. Galaxy's Child sets up a great scene where LaForge is called out for some inappropriate behaviour towards a woman but he - rather childishly - blames her for it and gets away with it. Data's behaviour in In Theory is rather implausible.<br /><br />But balanced against that we have the Klingon/Worf arc in Reunion and Redemption (and to a lesser extent in Family, Data's Day and The Mind's Eye) which is excellent throughout. There's Family's treatment of family life and Picard's backstory, which is well-acted by all involved. First Contact's brave experiment of showing the whole episode from the aliens' POV works extremely well. Brothers opens with a great hijacking storyline and ends with a striking confrontation between Brent Spiner, Brent Spiner and Brent Spiner which the actor pulls off with skill. Qpid has some great laughs (though not much else). Final Mission has some of the most spectacular location shooting the series ever did, and manages to (briefly) make the audience regret that Wesley is leaving. The Wounded expands on O'Brien's character a lot and paves the way for the entirety of Deep Space Nine. The Drumhead is an awesome episode about people using the fear of terrorism and sabotage to justify the draconian crushing of human rights and free speech (something even more relevant today than when the episode aired). The Mind's Eye is a great riff on The Manchurian Candidate.<br /><br />So whilst the fourth season doesn't quite hit the heights of the third (nothing here challenges Yesterday's Enterprise or The Best of Both Worlds in quality) it's still a highly entertaining collection of 26 episodes, with even the weakest episodes usually having scenes to recommend them. The regular cast are on top form and bolstered by some excellent guest stars (special mention must be made of Jean Simmons in The Drumhead and a returning Andreas Katsulas in Future Imperfect). There's a definite improvement in the quality of the effects for this season as well.<br /><br />For this HD re-release of the season, every episode has been re-assembled from scratch from the original film stock, with every visual effect in the season recreated from the source materials (or, when they were unavailable, new CGI). As with the previous seasons, this has the happy side-effect of eliminating all greenscreen artifacts and 'halos' around models and superimposed characters, and allows for much greater detail in effects shots to become visible. Some effects that were originally quite ropey - such as Deanne Troi's dream-trip in Night Terrors - now look utterly fantastic and challenge modern effects work. The replacement of the generic original planets with more detailed CGI versions also continues and hugely improves the look of the show (Pelia Zel II in The Host looks particularly impressive). In a few cases effects that people have been moaning about for years - like the distinctly underwhelming explosion of the Borg cube in Best of Both Worlds Part II - have been redone entirely to look a lot better. The only major problem in the season is the terrible CGI for the space creature in Galaxy's Child, which looks amateurish and out of keeping with the rest of the series. With the rest of the effects looking absolutely stunning, there is no excuse for this.<br /><br />The fourth season of Star Trek: The Next Generation (****½) is not the show at its best, but it is certainly highly entertaining and, with episodes like The Drumhead, thought-provoking. It is available now in the UK and USA.

B00AZMFJYA|5.0|To clarify, all articles published to date claim that the single disc DVD only edition contains no special features. The Blu-Ray and DVD as well as the 3-D Blu-Ray and DVD combo packs will contain featurettes but, from what I have read, they will be on the Blu-Ray disc and the DVD disc will be the same single disc in the DVD only pack (with no features). The Blu-Ray features, as noted in press releases, are listed as:<br /><br />\\"Creating the Red Planet\\" -- A featurette about the creation of the \\"red\\" planet so, basically, a special effects featurette.<br /><br />\\"Attack on Starfleet\\" -- The effects and filming of the attack on Starfleet Headquarters.<br /><br />\\"The Klingon Home World\\" -- Kronos featurette.<br /><br />\\"The Enemy of My Enemy\\" -- Spoiler alert, it's about the bad guy.<br /><br />\\"Ship to Ship\\" -- The space-suits only flight/jump of you know who and Kirk.<br /><br />\\"Brawl by the Bay\\" -- The brawl, by the bay, Spock and you know who.<br /><br />\\"Continuing the Mission\\" -- On the continuation, the sequel, the story after the first trek, probably similar to the first featurette on the Star Trek two disc dvd set from 2009.<br /><br />It is a shame but there does not, as of yet, appear to be a two disc DVD only edition for people who don't see well enough to bother with Blu-Ray or people, like me, who think film is far more, and please pardon the use of such a stupid word, magical when it is ever so slightly fuzzy and you can't actually see the pores on men's noses. If you want features, Paramount wants you to buy a Blu-Ray player and kill that hazy, cloudy magic of slightly foggy film stock with a bunch of high definition bull, in order to see those features. The decision is yours.

B00ECUX7HC|4.0|Derek and Susan and company are back with Made Up Mind, the follow up to the 2011 grammy winning Revelator. Fans saw a unique fusion of Derek Trucks' band and his wife Susan Tedeschi's band to create the Tedeschi Trucks band and Relevator delivered. While I did have a few minor complaints about Revelator I thought it was a solid album and was glad to see it do well. For those unfamiliar with Derek Trucks he is arguably the best blues player on the planet right now and in my opinion the best slide guitar player ever.<br /><br />Having double digit members in your band has to be stressful in the creative process of writing an album but Made Up Mind does a good job of dispersing and showcasing the musical talent. Fans of instruments will feast on Made Up Mind as the album offers a plethora of horn, flute, percussion, piano, and guitar. Derek still steals the show as expected on songs like \\"Do I Look Worried\\" and the jam blues track \\"The Storm\\". I'm a huge fan of the longer instrumentals and extended jams that we all know this band is capable of, \\"The Storm\\" fills that void and I can't wait to hear it in a live atmosphere. Sadly my one main criticism of Revelator remains on Made Up Mind , where is Mike Mattison? The former lead singer of Derek's band is virtually nonexistent and is reduced to backup vocals which really is too bad. As enamored as I am with Susan's voice, I really would've like to see what Mike could do on a few of these tracks. I'm probably in the minority but I feel as if a powerful opportunity has been missed.<br /><br />Overall Made Up Mind is an excellent album that adds even more credibility to the band's exquisite live catalogue. If as a blues fan you haven't had the opportunity to hear this band live I implore you to do so as the studio is a difficult place to capture the essence of what many call the soul stew revival.

B000H4TX9I|5.0|This show is so well written and acted that I found myself invested in these characters well before the pilot was over. It's a shame to think that such a quality show could never find it's audience while it was airing, but at least it's found it posthumously -- especially since the &#34;Serenity&#34; movie was then able to be made to round out the story line. Just the best!

B00DC7N9NS|3.0|This movie was okay for me. I dont think it was boring but just lacked excitement. When i got through it, i thought,  &#34;huh, that movie wasn't too bad. It was at least colorful&#34;.
B000FBFN1U|4.0|Good sequel.  I don't know the end but many of my assumptions have been blown away. Keep reading as it improves in the second half.
B00132S74A|4.0|Really a good book.  I couldn't put it down.  I read it in two days.  Would recommend it to anyone.
B000FC1HBY|4.0|The book is an excellent sequel to the first in the series.  I could hardly put the book down. Great.
B0024CEY36|4.0|Another fantastic book.  Read this one in two days.  Really enjoyed this one. Got wrapped up in the era and the story.  Well worth the read.
B00B0YL0E0|5.0|I've been a Pretty Maids fan since I picked up \\"Future World\\" on cassette.  This is probably their strongest offering to date, and they've already had some pretty strong offerings to date. Personal favorites are the title track, Mother of All Lies, Iceman, Bullet For You, and Wasted. Glad to see that there are a few bands still putting out high-quality stuff.
B00454U1NS|5.0|Lets just say that I am enamored with Pink.  Her voice, her rawness, her depth, style, talent, and on and on and on.  Oh, and lets not forget her beauty.  Toned muscle never looked so good on a woman.  Even when she is bad she is good.  I'm impressed.
B00BESM14U|3.0|The movie had interesting characters, but the story line was a bit too quirky for me. It was probably meant for a teen audience.
B008RA3X5E|2.0|Well it's cool but I would like it more if  the music could play longer. Also for some reason only one of my track shows on the music selection.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|If you liked The Help, you will definitely like this book.  What great characters and story<br />line.  Light novel to be enjoyed by everyone.
B00BI73CVI|5.0|Have loved this musical since I first saw it on stage in a pre- Broadway run. Can't beat the story, the music, the lyrics. Ann Hathaway is amazing
B009WUBERW|4.0|Liked the 1st one better, the tattoo guy was left out, better story line, better flow of the movie, okay
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is one of the best apps ever! The only bad thing about is that you have to rate the app to get the updates, which is one ofnthe reasons that I'm doing this. :-)
B007RFBXHK|3.0|Apparently young boys will find this movie pretty interesting but my 10 year old daughter and I just could not get interested in the movie. My husband watched the movie when he was young and LOVED it. Thus, he wanted our whole family to love it too. We just could not get into the movie.
B001NLKT60|5.0|I order this because I wanted to. I am happy with what I got, quality, color, and speedy delivery<br />Thank you
B000I9YV30|5.0|Our whole family loves this movie. I watched it when I was quite young and we recently let our 10 year old watch it with us and she too loved the movie. Since we purchased the movie we have now watched it several times. Funny, sad and dramatic. A great coming of age story.
B00992CF6W|5.0|When my mom got this game for me I only wanted to see if it was fun because my friend told me it was a good app. So my mom spent the money on this app and it was worth it.
B00AQMSJI2|3.0|It's cute at it's best. The biggest thing I don't like about it is having to do a few tasks right away, and not being able to go back.
B000JMKTLO|3.0|Sharp Objects is A very  good read...but not excellent. If you are interested in a happy little novel this is not the one to choose. Very damaged characters and a surprise ending.
B00003CX9Q|5.0|Bought this to watch with my husband and our 5 yr old granddaughter.  Her mom thought she might be scared, but she loved it!!!<br />She wants to watch it again when she next visits us.
B001O5LVPI|2.0|I had bought this for my children to watch and as I watched it with them I ended up having to stop the movie as Lilo exhibits bad behavior and Stitch and too much gun fighting for my 4 year old and 2 y.o
B000ID1J0E|5.0|I loved this movie, and fast and easy download to my kindle. Its almost 2 hours but its a fun and wild ride the entire time. Johnny Depp is fantastic in the film and his attorney is right behind him the whole way! A trip for sure!!
B00AFEX83C|5.0|Great movie my kids were afraid to watch it based on the title (4 and 2)  now they can't get enough of it!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Getting to reunite with the character from Book One was exciting. I was able to find out what happened to those families that I had become attached to. Cannot wait until Book Three.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|I like adventure-travel books. I've read the 'Jupiter' books (motorcycle around the world), the Thousand Mile Summer and Cactus Eaters and absolutely loved all three. Wild is a little different, with the author spilling a lot of words about her emotional struggles:<br />a) The anguish she feels over the loss of a loved one<br />b) Her penchant for risky behaviors while in her youth (although she wasn't exactly a child at the time)<br />c) Her inability at the time to stay in a loving relationship<br />I know that some people have trouble getting though all this because of their own morality or world view. Some thought that much it was included for the purpose of titillation or might even have been made up. I found some of it a bit tiresome, but I think it was the story that she wanted to tell and that it it was told in good faith. I enjoyed it.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I got it because my kids love this movie. Wish it was available for free on Amazon Prime, unfortunately most of the movies you look for are available at an additional price. I know Amazon is making more money this way, but it's a little frustrating for Amazon Prime subscribers.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|This movie could have been so much more...action..plot builing was weak..characters were weak...just not the best movie.  but passes the night easily...
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I find this a good game but keep losing tokens and never get them back when the site goes down even when I've paid for them have lost 110 up to now and never had them replaced that's the only thing wrong
B001UEBHYS|5.0|this amazing movie.  I don't know anyone who wouldn't be moved by it.  Watch it ...own it.  Deserved best picture.
B004259BMM|5.0|Every single song on this CD is great.  I definitely recommend it and I'm not even a country music fan!  Great listening in the car while traveling=)
B00CXVX1OQ|5.0|Fast and exciting game to play. And many levels to conquer. Best part is no cost to the player. Free from Amazon Prime. Thanks Amazon.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|My Bible app keeps me going.  I love it.  It has so many good resources and easy to read or listen to the Bible.
B006VREHRS|3.0|other than that, the show is okay. halfway through season.  buscemi doesn't have the gravitas yet to be the ultimate baron.  and I have a hard time caring about all the other characters because none of them even remotely have a moral compass. I get that's what the boardwalk was like back then, but as a viewer, I have a hard time connecting to those characters.  the green screening I hope improves. you can see a lot of green tint around people outside where they did a lot of green screening. I thought this technique was getting better.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great game! Keeps you captivated for hours! I cannot wait for the next levels to come out. I haven't loaded on my iPad and my android
B0089AF2DS|4.0|I actually first heard this album on YouTube, so kudos and thanks to whoever allowed the entire album to be posted. I thought it was a great blend of &#34;stoner metal&#34; and classic hard rock, without going one way or the other. The singer doesn't growl like Cookie Monster or scream incessantly. The guitar riffs range from funky, to 80s power chords, and into hypnotic melodies.
B00E8B1P9M|4.0|As far as sequels go this one isn't terrible. But then again I've always had a soft spot for G.I. Joe related things and I will watch just about anything with Ray Park in it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Addictive,can't wait till season 4. Has everything a show needs. Suspense, drama, guilty pleasure and comedy. We just love this show.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I love eBay anyway, so I think if u love eBay I believe that  you will also love this App, for the Android operating system....(I still do love it, but just got a new phone).  I have had no problems with the Android eBay App...I just got an iPhone so I have to also get myself another &#34;eBay App&#34; for my new iPhone...<br />I expect that I will also (hopefully) not have any problems with it on my iPhone either. (BUT...I'm STILL NOT SO SURE IF I LOVE my NEW iPhone YET or not...I find myself continually comparing everything on it to my (&#34;Android Droid X&#34;)...(&#34;WHO KNEW??&#34;) after owning an Android phone!  Lol!<br /><br />Some people (friends) think I'm nuts, but I find that the Android system is very much like the iPhone...BUT to me the Android seems one step ahead of the iPhone...as if its an improved version of the iPhone...Perhaps not in all areas, but definitely BIG in the texting & keyboard properties anyway!<br />If u shop on eBay...Get the App...It's Free....so what do u have to lose??
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Was in the doldrums waiting for the next Stephen Hunter novel when I discovered Lee Child and his Jack Reacher series. Holy cow! It's Bob Lee Swagger's long, lost brother! Mr. Child has been ruling the genre alongside Mr. Hunter and I didn't even know it. Now if us loyal readers can just convince the two of them to collaborate on a book we'll really be in heaven. Just picture Bob Lee and Jack walking into a dusty, crime-ridden town side by side!
B009AMAGQM|1.0|Relied on melodramatic love story to engage the audience.  I for one, did not care about the love story and found myself rolling my eyes when they tried to portray the main female character as a martyr.
B008476HBM|5.0|One of my favorite stories of Jane Austen. I have read several times and still find it a great read!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game starts out relatively easy but more and more challenging as you go.  Loving this game! Fun for all ages.
B004XVN1T4|5.0|Ken Follett is a master. This book brought to life the complex revolutionary period where comment prevailed over risk. It was an excellent read. It takes the reader on a wonderful journey with frank suspense, an excellent read.
0770437400|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book, though I have to admit I knew the concept going in--that it was a documentary style fictionalization of a zombie-plagued future. I wasn't sure if the straight-forward interview format would satisfy me, but I have to say it was a refreshing change from my typical fiction read.<br /><br />Most post-apocalyptic books I've picked up give me nightmares or force me to face harsh truths about human nature, and fair enough--that's their goal. I was expecting the same from this work, but found instead I became fascinated with the bare-bones, personal accounts taken out of harsh reality and emotion and put into journalistic storytelling. And while I know there are different ways to write such a story, I have to say Brooks impressed me with how drawn in I was even without the emotional attachment I usually require from characters.<br /><br />I wasn't sure I would, but I highly recommend it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Oh man can't wait for season 4 ... What can be said the flesh eating zombie craze continues with this series.. I am not sure why it attracts me but a fan I have become.. Great charactors lots of twists just intrigues me.. Season 4 definitely want to see just for seeing what the Governor does next what a villian.. Who am I kidding must see all these characters played out portrayed by some great people..
B001B68XRY|5.0|I remember watching the version with Burt Reynolds when I was young. It was nice being able to do the same with my son who really enjoyed this movie with his favorite actor, Adam Sandler. There is some content that might have been a little strong for him, but nonetheless, it is a good movie.
B00E8B1P9M|5.0|I am into action packed adventures and this was packed full.. This one to me stands on its own from the first one which also is one of my favs.. Has all the elements of pretty much non stop movement that keeps me watching.. Also as with the first GI Joe I can watch this over and over .. But hey I am not into deep plots just action ..
B001AITH50|5.0|I love this movie and the books so much! Even though Russian Armand was played by Antonio Banderas (his performance was good though) I think the actors did amazing jobs at portraying the characters! Hopefully the next DVD I review will be the HBO version of the Vampire Chronicles! Lestat's story must be told and how awesome would it be to follow him from his human life through the entirety of his vampire life!
B00ECU2RGY|5.0|Oblivion was very action packed with a lot of awesome  FX effects.  The story and actors was entertaining  as I'm a sci fi  fan from way back enjoy watching this. The only thing missing was the popcorn..
B009UX2YAC|5.0|really good and fun.it is challenging and has lots of people to unlock so that you hopefully don't run out of things to do.it has an updater to change the country and the course.
B001NA6096|4.0|Nice romantic movie, interesting that has a 2nd and 3rd part with 10 years if difference each and same actors
B000SVZIDA|2.0|I did not care for it...the whole film was too chaotic, for one thing. An assault on my senses.  Nicole Kidman was weak in the part although she has a great body; and Ewan seems a little sissified and gay for me to be the male love interest. This version was all too \\"fairy tale-ish\\" for my liking...zzzzzz. John L as Toulouse was interesting casting and Jim B as the ringmaster type character was somewhat menacing and different...but as I said; mostly...zzzzzz
B009KS4XRO|5.0|For the most part this game is awesome. The only problem I have is the game freezes every now and then.<br />plus I don't like that you can only colletct every 12 hours.  But I recommend this game to all my friends.
B009WUBERW|5.0|Very good movie. Many big stars. Great action film. Makes you want to be part of the action. Once again, very good movie.
B004GYY714|5.0|Excellent application that allows to access any country stations. Many posibilities to accesing stations anyuwhere. Besides, when I travel abroad allows me be in contact with my country radios and this is really good. App to be recommended withoth any doubts
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|My first time reading one of Neil Gaiman's novels. It left me with UN answered questions. Funny I'm like the little boy with all the questions. :) I'm not sure if all his novels are like but would like to read more of his. This one was interesting and kept me let's say curious the whole way through. I needed to know lol.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|One of the best app I have in my device fully of informations and posibilities to surf the best information in all orders. Very good and it is strongly recommending
B00E193TM2|4.0|Liking the new songs though prefer if had more of mixture between hardcore songs and acoustic ones.though still a great CD, especially with the extra vocals from other bands.
B004HX0P2Y|4.0|Great movie just for kicks!  Have yet to see a bad movie with Bruce Willis.  My favorite character in this one would have to be John Malkovich.
0553384775|5.0|Book kept me interested the whole time. Great to see the insider's perspective! Riveting account of a good broker gone rogue.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Really enjoyed this book! Quick page turner and author keeps you in the suspense throughout! Five stars!!!! Buy it now!
B00CEMH31Q|5.0|The BEST album HANSON has put out to date!! Like a great wine that improves with age, so does HANSON'S music and their maturity with it. Each album they released improves in style and sound, but always staying true to who they are as a band and to what their fans love most.  Fans are never disappointed with what HANSON produces! ANTHEM is truly the very best of HANSON ....so far!
B008602KQI|5.0|Great movie!Makes you think a lot about how reality TV can get to the extreme and how as human beings we tend to choose other people and consider them inferior.
B004LLDN3A|5.0|Great family friendly movie with memorable characters! Was a favorite of mine as a child and my kids too. My daughter just came home from college and we watched it again. She still loves it!
B00846REIS|5.0|Sylvia drew me in and kept me wonder what was going to happen next. I just started the second book, which I'm also loving.
B00E0MCYPS|2.0|This game was apparently made for a phone. I have a tablet and you cannot'control the car.Not for any one
1781162646|2.0|I have always been a Stephen King fan and have read many of his books. It had been quite a few years since I picked one of his books up, but after reading the reviews for Joyland I became interested. However, after reading it, I'm a little baffled by the rave reviews. This is by no means one of his best books, nor is it even that good in general terms. It read to me like a junior novel. I felt it was a story I would have appreciated in junior high or high school, but as an adult who appreciates good literature and memorable story lines, this did not work for me. In terms of it being a mystery/thriller, I also don't think it really held up well to the genre. I'm not a huge fan of mystery novels, but this one seemed really lackluster. It was very disappointing, because I expected much more after reading the reviews.<br />So, overall, it was an easy read which in a sense made it a page-turner...not because it was all that interesting but because it was like reading a book made for a young adult and was not the least bit challenging or involved. Maybe I have just outgrown his writing style, but I get the feeling that this is something he thought up and wrote in a very short period of time, and the lack of detail and passion really shows through.
B00EFNXPFK|5.0|Paradise Valley, while musically similar, is not as deep, or, should I say, as melancholy, as his previous LP, Born and Raised. It's more of a good-time, road-trippin' type CD with a couple ballads peppered in here and there. As the opening track, Wildfire is a head-bobbing good time, Dear Marie starts off slow but builds up to a beautiful climax, and there is a nice homage to Lynyrd Skynyrd (Call Me the Breeze). One thing I like about Paradise Valley is that it is a very consistent album without much filler. I think Mayer has matured a lot since his Body is a Wonderland days, and this is his most mature offering yet. It's a different Mayer, but at the same time, the same Mayer. Mayer fans should be pleased.<br /><br />4.5 stars. Keep writing great music, John!
B004GJYROG|5.0|I loved this movie as a kid and it was so awesome to be able to give this to my little brother on DVD he loved it!!!
B004HWYTP4|4.0|This isn't the best Bruce Willis movie, but it's still fun to watch.  I'm definitely looking forward to the sequel.
B006ZPJWBM|5.0|This is second volume of the Bennett duet series and it is fabulous. if you like the songs of the era that this represents you will love the painstaking working the producers did to get this program going by bringing in the fine musicians and production people, the original arrangements and of course, the singers who sing with Tony. Simply wonderful. One of the best things of its kind ever produced.
0380002930|5.0|Loved it myself many years ago - bought a copy this time for my son.  It is a classic tale...
B00ECU2SGS|4.0|Matthew McConaughey pays a good part in this movie. All characters really do their jobs. You should really rent or buy this.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Beautiful app, I love it! The scenery is gorgeous and it gives all the info<br /><br />I need. Like the clock for nightime too.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|This movie was moocho bueno!!!! Good stuff it gave me a boner 'specially that Olga chick!! Whoowee!!! The ginger was pretty juicy to. Buy I love the other chick. Id drag her into a dark alley and beg her to have sex with me.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|The original charge cable for the Kindle is a piece of junk.  This one is far better and has operated well for 3 months now.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Love it wish you won more and it refunded when your game freezes...and maybe a seperate daily bonus to play slots..but I truely enjoy it
B0071U3KCW|5.0|A wonderful movie - a classic! The quality of this was excellent as well. The extras are great to have.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a really great game for all ages, very fun and enjoyable. This is a bright and colourful interpretation of term or run it offers much more skill and technical capability but is much more fun! I would definitely recommend this product, it is highly addictive and ful  of fun features which make this game fun and enjoyable. The graphics are to an extremely high quality and there is lots of colour. This is definitely an app to download!
B0002J4ZWS|5.0|Morgan Freeman Narrator great acting by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman<br />it's worth looking at don't hesitate buy this movie it's a good one
B000089RVX|5.0|wow wow wow~~~love love love greatest.Amy Lee's voice is fantastic. This is a great debut album.....Fallen is amazing buy it .
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Yesterday my back-ordered Chromecast dongle arrived from Amazon.  I hooked it up and then spent several hours trying everything possible to get the device to work with either my iPhone or iPad - with no success.  A friend suggested I connect to Chromecast via my desktop first.  By downloading Google Chrome and then the Chromecast download, my desktop PC recognized the device and started working.  From there, my iPhone and iPad could be used to control the Chromecast's use on my flatscreen.  I also discovered that by dragging a movie or program onto the Chrome desktop, that could then be seen on the flatscreen.  I am not a huge teckie so this was an adventure, but it now works great!  I do recommend it, but wish Apple made it easier to  connect to Chromecast.  I've read all the problems people have encountered getting their Apple devices to work with Chromecast - it is possible to do so and if I can do it, so can you!
B004UNX1LS|5.0|I love vevo...my morning is started everyday with vevo!!! I here music i love back 2 back without any commercials!!!
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|This movie didn't seem to do well at the theaters, and was generally panned by &#34;the critics&#34;.  I downloaded it for a flight and was really pleasantly surprised by how good it was.  I'm no fan of TC outside the theater, but I really have never seen a bad movie he was in, this is no exception.  Great action, good characters and I didn't figure out who the bad guy was until late in the movie.  Well worth $5 bucks!
B0030A0ZD4|5.0|I remember when that first time this movie came to the theaters,I never saw that movie on theater,then came on tape,I still got the tape,this movie look great on Blu-ray
0061537969|5.0|I and everyone in my book group loved this book. The dog seemed almost human. The story regarding the grandparents wishing to raise the child after her mother dies happens in real life quite often. All of the characters came to life in this story. The young relative used to hurt the father and the court case. The ending was sweet but more like a hollywood movie.I have recommended it to everyone that I know.
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|I played it and deleted it in 30 minutes I couldn't do anything like build a house or anything but overall its fun.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|This book  started out well by setting the stage for the main characters, but in the middle, it got a little confused with so many characters.  I was reading it on Kindle and it is a little harder to look back to identify each character than when you are reading hard copy. The last part was wonderful and by the time I finished I was crying like a babe!  This book was a good read and I would highly recommend it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is boss at first I thought it was going to be crapy and a waste of money but it was awesome and fun get the game
B008Y73940|4.0|Very good movie. Matthew was very appealing. Had the feeling of a Graham thriller. McConaughey plays an attorney. The movie has lots of twists and turns.
B0036FYO12|5.0|Top notch cast (Redford, Dunaway, Robertson von sydow), great director (Pollack), marvelous story.  As von Sydow said it at the end, &#34;You were very good, Condor!&#34;
B003B17YZE|5.0|This is by far the greatest music to ever be put out.  Gotta love Jimi....<br />RIP Brother.....you are truely missed!
B001B71NOI|4.0|The cd is awesome and I was able to downloaded into my cloud account.  The cd is more than I expected.
B005544V6A|5.0|Forreals. Watch it.<br />I stayed up until 3am watching it.<br />Why would I do that, you may ask?? BECAUSE IT IS WORTH IT.<br />It also makes you want to drop everything and go to Harvard so you can become a lawyer until you realize you don't have a freakishly amazing mind like the guy in the show.<br />But still...if you don't watch it, you're missing out.
B0072NWJRK|4.0|Lots of memories for one well acquainted with old Peking. Well written and entertaining.  A must read for Old China Hands.
B000ME5B30|5.0|i give this movie 5 stars.  if i could i would give it 100 stars!!!!  There will be not be an easy time for future generations, if steps are not taken to save us from GLOBAL WARMING.  Republicans, wake up and smell the coffee! We will all pay a heavy price if we do nothing to save our environment.  Lies do not help the situation!!!!!!
1609611543|3.0|This book was recommended by a friend who noticed that the circumference of  my wasteline was approaching that of a commercial propane tank.  Read this, she assured me, and you will be a new man in no time.<br />The book is really appropriate for those with Ceilac disease who have a medical reason to avoid lactose.  For those of us who need to loose a few pounds, not so much.  The fact that we are quickly becoming an obese nation is no reason to avoid all wheat products.  Yes, wheat have been genetically engineered to increase yield, and over processed to preserve its shelf life, but these to not make wheat the solution to all of our ills, as the author suggests. So, if you have Celiac disease, listen to your doctor, and if you wish, read this book. If you are simply a few (or more) pounds overweight, get more exercise, avoid junk fook, and practice portion control.
B0038P59A0|4.0|Robert Downey Jr does another excellent job! Since his problems earlier in his career, He only gets better and better!
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|It is a generally entertaining movie.  Just don't think too hard regarding the plot holes and you're fine.  Take it for what it is, a summer turn off the brain popcorn movie.  It was way better than Prometheus.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Very addictive, and hard to put away. &quot;Just one more run&quot; I tell myself. Great game for any age. I find we play Despicable Me: Minion Rush more then the kids do.
B009X011UQ|4.0|I wanted something light weight but protective, this was it!  I would give it a 5 but the elastic is a little weak and one corner pops out of the case.
B009VIZDLI|4.0|A funny, lighthearted read which left me smiling. Don is so serious and regimented and his descriptions are amazing. He sees things from a different point of view to the normal person which makes the book interesting.
B007N8RULO|5.0|Well, I'm hooked!  Very addicting!  Less commercials than Words For Friends so it is even better than expected.  I play it everyday.
B008476HBM|5.0|The number of films and broadcasts made of this classic tale, with its extraordinary insights into human character and behaviour are all the testimony needed to its popularity. One of those rare books than can happily be read a second and third time.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I cried and laugh while reading this book. I think this should be a required book for all High School students to read.<br />They  would get allot more out of this book than most. Amazing!!!!
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|Very well-researched. Very interesting, narrative writing style. Paints a picture of a historical Jesus that makes me, a borderline Atheist, want to don a WWJD bracelet. 'Cuz what would he do? His thang.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Liked his first book better, but this one did not disappoint. It was of a completely different point of view and certainly had less pathos than his first book, but was, none -the-less, a good read.  It illustrated what happens when paths that should never have been severed, are closed off and people who should have been closely connected in life somehow never are.  I admit it was depressing,but then. real life often is.
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|I have watched this movie so many times. I put it on to play, and start up my own bowl of Ramen! LOL Can't beat the sex scene with Daniel Craig - love when the woman takes charge!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Exciting!  Can't put it down !  I would definitely recommend this thriller/ mystery to everyone!  Can't wait to read one of this author's other books
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Wonderful book, great story, and easy read. If you love aviation and World War II then this is a book for you!!!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|It is a good show, and I hope it continues.  I think I have said all I need to say.  If you want more, you should offer me something in return.
B00CPTUNBK|5.0|I've watched it 3 or 4 times now, and it just keeps getting better, I also liked how they made Twilight Sparkle have problems with her wings, considering that she just got them it makes a lot of sense, the same goes for her awkwardness when she's in her human form.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|A demo would have been nice. But, it is a fun game and keeps me going.<br /><br />Just poke around long enough and you figure it out.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I can't say much more than that! It does what it's supposed to do. It's simple, easy, and free! The extra large keys are a big plus, too.
0525478817|5.0|An easy read, John Green is the best. A wonderful book and I honestly couldn't stop crying but it was wonderful.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I wanted to catch up on the Hunger Games trilogy since the 2nd movie was coming out and a friend had given me an older Kindle that he was no longer using.<br /><br />LOVE the fact that the Prime Members can borrow the books for free!! I devoured the last 2 books of the set within 2 weeks - one while camping and was able to download the 3rd (it's a 1st generation Kindle) while at the campsite on 3G.<br /><br />Ready to move on to other awesome books - I forgot how much I loved reading until I was given this device.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game to play on the kindle fire and best of all it is free. Highly recommended for fans of minions.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|It really kept me on my toes. Very well written and I could hardly put it down. I loved the ending.
B000LVAQDE|5.0|This is the best movie ever. Stallone was outstanding just as he is in all of his movies...i love Stallone, there's none better!!
B003JH8LPW|5.0|The book was fascinating and lush with descriptiveness. It was fast paced and exciting with no dull parts. It was coherent and all of the pieces tied together neatly.
B007AL48UK|4.0|If you enjoy mahjong then you will enjoy game.  Cute graphics.  Different layouts that are beach friendly.  Worth the price.
B003477DVK|3.0|my eight year old daughter barely liked and got scared when in cemetery and did not want to watch anymore
B006LSZECO|1.0|Author's style is too labored.  Tries too hard to be clever.  As a former English and Creative Writing teacher, I was<br />extremely disappointed in the novel.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|found the book to have been written well with a interesting plot line would recommend this writer to others and have brought some more of her books to read
B004U8VX2M|5.0|Excellent show.  Great writers, great actors..wonderful production.  As usual, British TV is worthwhile.  I have always found it to be outstanding.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is seriously my favorite game. I'm a night owl and its kind of cool to be able to play bingo with people from all over the world! Love love love
B0071MQBX0|5.0|Have always loved Phantom. Have seen it on Broadway, am waring the movie. The 25th is astounding. I cannot imagine better entertainment. A fitting tribute to the play and everyone who has brought it alive over the years.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|This is a great app, its from a developer called devian it has a devil tail in the app pic, you are doing something google wants illegal hence not in play store. Please do not rate poorly cause you are old or religious it works perfectly and does what its supposed to.  Don't like porn, afaid little Susie is going to get corupted by seeing male genitalia? Download ad away and block it. But its your soul, your basically downloading an illegal app to avoid ads from you tube, then downloading another illegal app to block its ads all because you don't want to see a penis. Your probably going to burn in hell anyway :)
B00C6F624K|4.0|the blu ray version of this film, will not play on australian multi region players, its currently being sold this version on ebay, unlike most usa dvd films will, and some titles on blu ray do too, unfortunatley some studios have put a lock on there discs. and some players wont unlock not even sony.<br /><br />this however is a great film and is done so well as a back in time drama comedy. i suggest only buying the dvd version for customers outside of the usa
B009ZQJ1G4|4.0|Have always liked Bale, and he doesn't disappoint in this one. Typical liberal storyline but nice movie anyway. Shouldn't disappoint.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Very good book. It ended the story well. It made reading the first two books worth the wait. Suzanne Collins attention to the detail of the storyline made for an easy read with intrigue and affable guidance.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Fascinating, enlightening and well researched. This is a remarkably interesting book that I finished all too quickly. Anyone interested in the role of the man we refer to as Jesus in history and culture should read this.
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|Wish I could have immediately started watching Season 2.<br />There were a lot of loose ends that I wanted to see how they<br />played out.
B00CEMH31Q|5.0|it one of there best .i like all the songs couldn't wait to get it. they still sing great thanks
B009NQZVKG|5.0|I love books that makes you think about your own future.  Is our world a holograph, and if so, who is watching us?
0525952926|5.0|I had just finished book one, and was anxious to read book two.  I ordered it on line, and it arrived before I had expected it.  An excellent book which I have almost finished, and will start on book three.
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|My daughter love this movie she can't stop watching it. I put it almost every day. I definitely recommend this movie.
B009X011UQ|3.0|There are groves on the pack, as pictured above, but the grove does not help to keep it standing. I am very disappointed in this product. The grove is not deep enough to help it stand and remain standing.<br /><br />I would like to return it and exchange it for standing case that remains standing.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|Very useful, an easy way to do some light 'shopping when on the move. The presets make it easy to be recommended for anyone.
B0059WTMLW|3.0|Not crazy about this one. There are many other Sudoku games out there but do not take my word, it is free and worth a try.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Enjoyed this book.  It was well written and flowed easily.  It was very interesting Eben being a Neurosurgeon and because of that how he looked at this experience. It also gave some enlightment into his life of being adopted.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I was really impressed with the second book in the hunger games trilogy!  The story moves fast and was well developed and I honestly had no idea what to expect as the book went on.  In the end, I felt as helpless as Katniss!  No spoilers here, read for yourself! ;)
B000092Q4U|5.0|Bought it, Love it. I had a bunch of their new stuff and this did not disappoint. Buy it! Plus the free download made it completely worth it!
B00AE4OGCU|5.0|I really enjoyed the trilogy and being able to move straight through the whole series,but  had some difficulty remembering the character names.
0345472322|5.0|I purchased and read this along with the course that Jo Boalar created, along with &#34;What's math got to do with it&#34;, Jo Boalar. Many profound thoughts and insights.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|she has gone into seclusion so you have to buy the albums you pass by earlier her last album was a poor album she is in a music slump
B0063M22QO|4.0|Another enjoyable addiction. As I walk mlndless through life I have yet another toy for my little head. Lotza fun.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is one of the best tv series ever. The acting is superb. I love this glimpse into history. The writing is wonderful. PBS has a great hit!
B003DZX3SA|4.0|This is an awesome flick.  I purchased it awhile ago because I felt the need to relive this movie experience from when I was a kid and it did not disappoint! Beauty in the Beast willl always be a classic.
B0006VBFM0|5.0|This watch goes with many outfits. The time is very easy to read. So far the quality is equal to my last swatch watch which is 5 years old. The dial is about 1 1/2 inches.<br /><br />Cocq
B008BQ8VOC|4.0|Love this show!  There is great chemistry and the ongoing saga with Mike and Rachel is worth watching another season.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|A beautiful fairy tale by Neil Gaiman. I had heard it was good and it live up to the hype.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|It is habit forming.  I like to play it way too much.<br />I can't till the next night when I have 40 new coins.
6305428352|5.0|The movie came quickly and was as it was described. We really enjoyed this movie.  Love Richard Dreyfuss. Thank you very much!
B007IXWL2C|3.0|The series overall dwindled in excellence with each book. I enjoyed the first and that's about it. I guess I just feel like I have to finish it : P...if I could, for this book I'd give it 2.5 stars. The book is super repetitive and you just feel like 'okay, okay get on with it....' I would have to say the target audience for this book must  be 19-22 years of age.
B002RTMXIY|5.0|I like watching movies that are based on a true story. The first time I saw this movie there was a scene that I found hard to watch, but as I started to understand it more and more, I rated it as my favorite movie.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Play this game when ever I am waiting for stuff. It's so much Dunn and a great way to help time go by.
B0032CVAQQ|3.0|I find it hard to believe that everyone can fit into one of five profiles. Then seeing that he has 7 more books on the same subject just proves that there is something to be sold. Overall its a good book if you are in need of your marriage fixed. But i could see this book pulling two perfectly happy people apart. Especially when one has read and followed the advice and one hasn't. Just like the bible, its good to have read it but don't take it as a whole truth.
B005LAIII0|4.0|I purchased LIfe Of Pi for my girlfriend, I wasn't too eager to watch it myself but I gave it a try. All I have to say is that this movie exceeded my expectations. For some reason, this movie  seemed a lot like &#34; Big Fish&#34;
1401937519|5.0|Very inspiring... A real blessing. If you are able to open your heart and mind Anita's experience could be part of you.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|There was no cohesive theme to this book. I love his other books but this was just okay. Too many characters to really find a connection.
B00CL6GAD2|4.0|terrific movie, i thought mark wahlberg played a very good part in the movie, and it had an ending that i didn't expect<br />the movie wasn't as clear as it could have been, i had to rent it through my roku and i have dish network on top of that and it went thru my router so the picture wasn't a pure hd movie.
B008XG1X18|2.0|I have more success using the app on my iphone. It constantly kicks me out when I try to pin something.
B003K16P3M|5.0|I love this book and would recommend it to anyone, age 15 and up. The strong female character is the best part!
B007IXWL2C|2.0|Same redundant scenes as book one and two. Waste of time. Could have wrapped this up in the first book.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I initially owned only the first book (Wool 1) because I had gotten it free in a promotion, but once I finished I realized I was so engrossed that I simply had to read the entire Silo Saga. The writing, the characters, and especially the setting drew me into this rich world that Hugh Howey has created.
B002L4QP0M|5.0|One of his best books. Brilliant and thrilling story well executed. Kept me on the edge of my seat until the very end.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|The game was fun and had lots of puzzle solving combined with hidden objects. It got pretty cheesy at times but still good.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Although I really enjoy this bingo game, I find myself frustrated when playing the tournaments. I play a lot of different games on my kindle, but find I only freeze up playing this one. It's  hard enough to do well in the tournament  without freezing up. Its also frustrating having someone call bingo after only one number.
0679805273|5.0|I have given these books as gifts for high school graduation and found them here.  Good value and exactly what I was looking to purchase.
B000FBJF6Y|5.0|Delight mystery set in Africa about the first lady detective.  People cannot believe that a woman can be a detective  -- but she can and does!
B00CWY76CC|1.0|Don't understand how the game works and the instructions are bad. This game should provide detailed instructions on what you should do or how tomove around and pick up clues
B00DGN51O8|2.0|Not much of a hook, no depth to the characters or plot. Good for little kids, but not so much for the big kids
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This book is so well written.  It's historical, interesting, fast paced, and very factual in the references to actual facts.  Excellent book!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was beautifully written. I will be reading more of John Green. It was  heartbreaking and haunting.  The story will stay with me for some time.
B00CLT31D6|2.0|I maybe had too high expectations before resding this book. Or maybe I have read it after too many other finance related books and it should've been read way before. Anyway, the end result is that I was very disappointed by the book.<br />First, it's published in 2010, but the numbers and stories are dated from the early 1990s, all prices-related or specific data is outdated (salaries, purchase prices, car models, etc). I think the data should have been refreshed before publishing a 2010 version of the book.<br />Second, it's way too long for a very small and short takeaway. I could probably make a very precise summary of the book in less than one page. Most of what's in there is obvious... Basically, if you live like you have a $20k salary but earn $100k well, you will accumulate wealth (duh) and be able to live without a salary for more than 10 years (double-duh). Anyone knows that if you don'T ttravel, buy cheap cars, clothes, live in a small neiborghood.. i.e. live the same was as someons that earns one fifth of your salary, then you will get more money and be able to stop livign for a long time with that money accumulated. The problem is that yes you can stop working and be fine with your savings, but you'll still live the $20k lifestyle all these years.<br />It's all way too basic and logical to be worth reading a several hundred pages book.<The takeaway: if you earn $100k in your household, live like you only earn $30k. Put the rest aside and invest it, don'T travel, don't buy nice stuff, and then you can stop working early and live like you earn $30k per year for the rest of your life.<br />For me, that's not the definition of wealthy. ASomeone wealthy will both have a nice lifestyle AND investments/wealth accumulated.
B005HF0F0S|3.0|This show is... not that bad.  I don't regret watching the whole first season, but I don't know if I'll continue on to watch season 2.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|Nicholas Sparks is amazing. He tugs at your heart strings while making the emotions of the characters feel so real. I absolutely LOVED this book. It is possibly my favorite by him!
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Great game. One of g5 games best  very challenging. Works the brain. Visual effects well done . Look forward to sequel
B0030ZOYHC|5.0|Can't wait for the 3.33 and 4.44 BD to be out. The BD is high quality production. The improvements of video quality over my DVD box set of the original series, is like night and day.
B003F3FJQO|3.0|It seemed as if everything that happened was very predicatable and simply written for other reasons than the author was passionate about writing the book.
B004EC5IUW|5.0|High quality BD release. Enough said, I'll let those more knowledgeable talk about the actual story, changes, etc.But it is a really good production.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|YOU JUST GOT TROLLED TROLOOOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOOL  THIS APP IS AWESOME WHOOP LOLOLO GET IT ITS GOOD TRUST ME BUT YOU NEED TO HAVE A USB TO VIEW VIDEOS YOU GOT TROLOLOLOLOLOLOLED AGAIN
B00C4U9U4Q|5.0|made my shorts feel good. real good. damn good album. Made me wish i was a better man. On the reals like the album a lot though
B006AZZPCM|5.0|This is really the nest YouTube downloader. I have had many.  The way is simple: go to YouTube, findthe clips that you are looking for, start share and choose TubeMate. Green arrow dowloads it.
B002RKSZKI|3.0|It was a little hard to follow for me.  If I hadn't seen the movie I may not have been able to keep track of all the characters.
B00CXVX1OQ|5.0|If you want the.full enjoy of this game I recommend you to bay it twice: for you and for yours partner, girlfriend, etc. You can play this game against android, but the real fun is to play it over WiFi. I am playing that way, and this is really great fun ( it's much better then bluetooth).<br />Single player mode is great too.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|I've been playing this for about a year now and just HAD to have it on my new Kindle.<br />It is very addictive... my favorite game right now.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I liked that August I so careing hopeful and loveable helpful and last bout not least cruageing cute and adorable
B000JQUMPI|5.0|I have read this a couple of times over the years, but had not read it for quite a while.<br />It inspired me to want to read Little Men again.
B005RJ6DUK|5.0|This my a classic film. Robert Dr Niro is one of a actor that I enjoy in movies. & this film have a fun , sad, tragic twist to it... But its a great film. I strongly recommend this movie
B00932A4XE|3.0|I enjoyed it, but it wasn't anything special or that I would want to see again. It was not as funny as I expected it to be.
B000683VI4|5.0|This was my first time watching this movie. And I wasn't sure about it. A friend introduced this film to me.. I'm not a fan of romantic movies. But I watch it.  & fell in love w/ it..  sad but also a cheerful film
B003UBTX72|5.0|Keef has led a great life.  Born at the right time and played the right instrument.  He tells the whole story truthfully and with humor.  It's a fun read and gives you the inside story of someone who was imbued with rock and roll DNA.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I work with numbers in the field and this is simply the best calculator on the market.  I use it on my Nexus 4 and my new Nexus 7.  I highly recommend this to everyone.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|The negative: This was a gift, but I didn't have the opportunity to watch it until early August 2013. Disk number Five is defective. I placed it into two different DVD players, and it caused both players to become &#34;hung up&#34; after the first introductory picture. No sound either. Other DVDs are playing very well, and the first four DVDs in the series played without incident. Since Disk Five holds the last two episodes of the series, this was a huge disappointment! What is even more disappointing is that Amazon's policy for returns does not cover this expensive boxed set. The set was purchased in February 2013, but Amazon will not honor the return now. And I am a current PRIME customer as well; however, I was not at the time this was purchased. So, I'm uncertain what to do...but I cannot afford to buy another boxed set of the series...and I don't think that it is possible to find only Disk Five for sale.<br /><br />The positive: The first four DVDs were excellent. Fantastic picture and high quality sound. The movie effects are first rate, and Tom Hanks did a wonderful job of directing. The drama is so realistic that you can sometimes believe that you are actually in the midst of the scenes. Character development was slow compared to &#34;Band of Brothers&#34;. After the first hour of that series, you knew the characters names and could easily identify them from there on. In &#34;The Pacific&#34;, it took almost three episodes, before I could even recognize the main characters. However, about time I was really getting into the later episodes, the Disk Number Five issue arose. My father was a Marine in WWII and he passed on in the early nineties. He seldom would talk about the war, but I know that he trained men in the Second Marine Division for the war in the Pacific. He did tell me about Chesty Puller, and also about some of his buddies. I was really looking forward to seeing &#34;The Pacific&#34; as a way of remembering him. I guess that won't happen now. At least I got to see Guadalcanal and Peleliu. It helped me to understand my father a lot better.<br /><br />Loved the story, but.....east I got to see Guadalcanal and Peleliu. It helped me to understand my father a lot better.<br /><br />Loved the story, but.....
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Dear ,The New Oxford American Dictionary<br /><br />It is really good thank you very much for this app on my kindle fire good HD bye Have A Good Day<br /><br />Love Paul
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|Great movie! Sure to please any comic fan or aspiring young super-hero!  Lots of comedic relief and lots of super powered action!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love Subway surfers! It's graphics could be improved though. And make the items (characters, boosts,etc.) a bit cheaper too. All in all, it's a pretty good game.
B004RKXHZY|1.0|There is enough up and downs in this book to keep you wanting to read more. I really enjoyed Lola and her family, and the wonderful boy next door.
B00E5Q1LTY|3.0|Ricardo Montalban in the tv series & the movie is seared into my brain as the only Khan (Khan Noonien Singh).  So no mattered how talented Benedict Cumberbatch may be as an actor, he cannot ever be a suitable Khan.  Chris Pine as Kirk I can accept, Karl Urban as Dr. McCoy does an admirable job, as do the actors who play Scotty, Sulu, & Uhura.  Even Anton Yelchin as Chekov is pretty good.  But Zachary Quinto as Spock just doesn't pull off Spock in my humble opinion.  I have no tangible reason for my impression except that he seems TOO wooden - at least Nimoy used his eyebrows, squinty eyes, & raised voice as his human half inadvertently reared its head on many occasions.<br /><br />I have watched all the tv series (remembering making fun of the gorn & lightweight rocks) more than once, all the movies, & the ensuing Next Generation, Voyager, Deep Space Nine, (never got that into Bakula's Enterprise though), so this may account for some of my bias.<br /><br />The movie was better than most of the old Star Trek movies, however.  The one with the whales was so tedious.  When these old movies first came out, most of the high ratings were due to the original cast performing again rather than a true critique of the movie content.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I play the game daily. My only complaint is that some rooms are very stingy on how the shadow cards pop up. You may play several games and run out of hundreds blue chips before you get a chance at a shadow card.
159315724X|5.0|This book is Lifechanging (if you utilize it). I had a chance to see Darren Hardy in person at a conference and knew I had to get the book!
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|Great movie with twists and turns! Wonderful story about a family and their lifestyle!! The directing and acting is phenomenal!!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|A complete experience to say the least. Mentally stimulating and challenging. Hints really help, don't forget to use the viewer! (Is that what it was called?) :)<br />Also had a bit of a creepy vibe to it. I loved the historical-document-look to the old letters you would stumble upon had.<br />Brilliant from start to finish. Well worth the money and more importantly, well worth the time!
B00006RCNJ|5.0|Andre Rieu is the best.  Great classical music with some standards included.<br />Entertaining for young and old alike.  This thoroughly engages my elderly mother.  She loves Andre.
B00ECU2RGY|3.0|I want to give this 2 stars because the story is choppy at best, it is hard to follow at times, and I find Tom Cruise's acting painful at times.  Once again I got fooled into renting another Tom Cruise Action movie from a great trailer and being left disappointed.  I went with three stars however because some of the special effects are great and I love the actual plot (which I wont share since it is a big spoiler).  Better actor and smoother story and this easily could have been 4 out of 5 stars.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|This series is addictive and fills the void between seasons of Downton Abbey.  The characters are realistic and lovable - even the ones who are disagreeable.
B0014BY72Q|4.0|Although this movie was produced over a generation ago, it clearly illustrates what can happen when man's love for pleasure, leisure, and technology replaces his love for God.  In this \\"advanced\\" society, the family unit is non-existent.  It saddens me that in 2013 the traditional family unit is being attacked on so many fronts: abortion; same sex marriage; immorality; governmental attempts to usurp parental rights and authority; just to name a few.  Logan's Run reveals the end result of governmental destruction of the traditional family unit.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I Love this game! It's fantastically good for all ages.  I can't stop playing it.  Please enjoy this wonderful game as I have.
B0098QBEXO|5.0|I loved this movie.  The acting is superb, with easy natural interaction as close friends would in reality.  The story is bittersweet, building slowly in the tension of reality finally truly setting in, both in one friend's predicament and finally in their own lives.  As one character says, the men have finally reached the day when the dreams one had of one's life become more like fantasies than possibilities.  And also in the things unsaid for years that finally come out.  There can be no real happy ending, and you can feel their fear at a friendship lost and the heavy burden and gladness it will mark on them.
B001AQO3QA|4.0|When I received this Blu-ray set I was thrilled to see the nicely done wrapping surrounding the Alien Anthology. What do I mean? Well the outside cover was not at all obtruvise to view. The inner wrapper was literally like a book. The movies speak for themselves. The sound of course is a key factor with any Blu-ray and of course it meant my familly and friends expectations. I prefer the DVD version when it comes to what was inside the box but this is one Anthology worth owning.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I wanna be in the hunger games now. I love this book. You should read this book it's the best
0064471837|5.0|Sabriel has been one of my favorite books since childhood. I read it when I was a bit younger than the main character, and I instantly felt a connection to her. She was a young woman, who leaves relative safety and confronts the unknown to help her father. She shows bravery and courage throughout her trials and remains a strong female character. I still enjoy reading her story, even after many years, and plan on introducing my children to her when they are old enough.<br /><br />Nix writes a stunning world that immediately drew me in and a new and exciting take of necromancy that is like nothing I had ever read, and still haven't! His characters are believable (they make mistakes just like everybody) and their growth throughout the book is believable and you can't help but cheer for them in the end. His descriptions of the world are vivid and make you feel like you could actually be there. I hope you decide to read this one for yourself, because it is totally worth the money and time to read. Thank you Mr. Nix!
B00CL6HGIK|4.0|A little rough in some spots but an action packed movie...<br />This is one you can not fall asleep watching.  No Way....
B008YWY0HK|5.0|This is a pure treasure.  Such a lovely story.  The disc was perfect as well as the cover.  It was everything I had wished for in a movie and my grandchildren loved it as well as my great grandchildren
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I love playing the jewel star game. It is full of fun and challenging. Great game for the family to pass the time.
B004QOB8SY|5.0|Not enough stories in season two.... Double the number of episodes would be welcomed greatly. Excellent story lines and acting.
1616551607|5.0|I just recieved it and the quality is awesome!!!!! Yoshitaka Amano is a genius and as a long time fan of Final Fantasy and RPG's on a whole I wish other games would do the same and release art works.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Love to play and my grandsons share it with me so that makes it more fun! They can go in and look at my Park and see what new dinosaurs I have!
B00CTKHXFO|5.0|Contains entire series including the super nintendo series! Great work konami and the art book is awesome!<br /><br />P.S Metal gear solid 1 is a download
B009KCUX3S|5.0|Most definitely, a great reference book to learn Java from scratch.<br />There're a couple of must-haves out there, for every programming language.<br />I'm not gonna discuss for C/C++/C# etc in detail, but when it comes to Java, here it is.<br /><br />The layout, the explanations, the content, everything is so 'active'. The book uses a unique way to place the Java skills, using Object Oriented Methodologies directly into the reader's brain.<br /><br />I got this book both as a hard book, & for my Kindle.<br />Highly recommended. Worth every penny, & deserving of 5-stars.
B001BANK32|4.0|A good read though depressing if you hate being snowed in. Reread it in anticipation of the continuing saga of Danny Torrence in Dr Sleep.
B00C061I3K|4.0|Great CD, love this band. But I really wish the shipment was quicker.<br />I need seven more words to finish this.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I love this game. It's fun to discover hidden objects and figure out how to use them to escape. Only wish they had more levels.
0452285186|5.0|My brother HATES bunnies--always has--so when I saw this book I had to get it for him.  The book itself is really tiny, but it's pretty funny and the illustrations are good.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|This book is very well written and tells a great story, sad, but good.  I think his first two are better, but this is right up there.  I enjoyed it.
B003U9TDII|4.0|I have collected Hans Zimmer's work for many years.  While I believe his ability to paint pictures with music is second only to John Williams in the soundtrack realm, Inception, in and of itself, does not stand out as one of his greater film scores.  I believe his work from Gladiator and Pirates of the Caribbean set the bar very high on what has come to be expected from his talents.  Inception, in my opinion, requires the accompaniment of the motion picture, whereas others stand out on their own.<br /><br />Again, this is just my opinion, and I still bought this soundtrack and like it.  4 of 5.
0385349947|4.0|Great reading and enlighting for all women.  My daughter enjoyed the CD and found it refreshing.  I recommend this Book.
B0012GTZC0|5.0|Read years ago and enjoyed it more this time. Thrilling believable story with twists and turns to captivate the reader.
B008XG1X18|5.0|It's very easy to like a pin, and to create organized broads. Only bad thing is some links don't open, sometimes I have to go to web Browser to open on the regular pinsterest website, not often through. Great app!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|The best bingo game I have played by far.  Love the free tournament.  I wish they would fix the freezing up problem.  Always seems to happen during a really good game.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|For a show about zombies and a limited number of cast, it manages to touch on so many human emotions and keeps you interested with twists.
B005ISQ7JM|2.0|I must admit.. I didnt check to see how many pages were in this book before I downloaded it. There are 10?<br />Do not expect this book to be instructional in anyway, rather, it is a set of small discussions on what HTML5 is.
B000000WA4|5.0|I love everything about this album. The songs are great, the concept is great, the artwork is great, the pumpkins are great. Just an overall great album. When I first got it, I listened to it nonstop for months. Now, I just kind of go back to it and feel the nostalgia. It's one of those albums that's easy to attach memories and emotions to. There isn't a song on it that I don't enjoy listening to. It's also a great album to play when you just want to lay in bed and look up at your ceiling for a while. But it's also good to enjoy with other people too. It's versatile I guess.
B008B0QH5S|4.0|I bought Electric before getting this.  So I made a playlist with this and Electric on it. I hit shuffle songs and it is a perfect Pet shop Boys album to listen to.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Would have given it 5 stars but this version had less items than pc version and the worlds were not infinite. Otherwise, a very good game if you enjoy minecraft.
B008KYOCA2|5.0|I wanted a calendar for my Kindle.  Nothing with a lot of bells and whistles,This calendar lets me input my appointments, and also reminders.  Easy to use and to make changes.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Great read. Eagerly awaiting the next volume. Sanderson does great work in breathing life into his world and his characters.
1452101248|5.0|I am so smitten with Yotam Ottolenghi's cookbooks.  This was the first one that I bought and I adore it.  I followed it up with Jerusalem. All of his recipes are so elegant and flavorful.  We eat a &#34;mostly&#34; vegetarian diet so this particular book was a beautiful addition to my collection.  Some of the recipes are a bit of &#34;work&#34; but the final product is so worth it!  Even non-vegetarians will enjoy this food.  And frankly, the pictures alone make it worth the price.  I can't wait for his next one to come out!!!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|The stellar characterizations trump the strong but rather predictable ending.<br /><br />Great writing and pacing. It's hard to shock readers these days because of so many movies and those 48 Hours segments on television about true crime. But the courtroom scenes were spot on.
B00CFAHSEO|5.0|Here, again, the &#34;guys&#34; have put forth a disk that is truly awe inspiring. My family (yes, even the 7-year-old twins) LOVE everything we've heard by them.  The children listen and are inspired to take music lessons.  Thank You!
B0012GTZC0|5.0|Good well written plot.<br /><br />Keeps the interest alive and moves along at a great pace.<br /><br />The author almost makes you feel the harsh weather and desperation on the island !
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game is definitely addictive.  You will want to play every day. Have fun and remember:  it is just a game.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Fantastic book, entertaining and thought provoking. Really makes you think about what you would do in a similar situation. Great for a book club!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Teens will enjoy this movie, especially the girl power empowerment aspect. Younger viewers might not enjoy the violent action, but its otherwise a fun movie.
0385342071|3.0|This book is very entertaining, however the footnotes take away from the reading experience.  I found it so annoying to constantly have to find the footnote, read it, then return to the paragraph I was reading.  How hard is it to put things in parentheses?  I can't imagine trying to read this book on a kindle.  That would drive me nuts.  Jen Lancaster is also \\"footnote happy,\\" but I believe she found a solution in her latest book.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|Others far more qualified have commented in other places - - I downloaded this as I have lost my original version from the 1970s - - as yet have not attempted to read on Kindle. Les Mis... combines sweeping panoramic narrative with an incredibly depressing and at times uplifting story of INDIVIDUALS &#34;against the world&#34;. You could transfer Hugo's characters to a modern era Balkans, perhaps even Egypt or Syria and doubtless find the awful tale of deceit, treachery, raw passion and undying valour amongst the throng. However, it is Hugo's turn of phrase and touch for the inner voices of the poor souls that made it a masterpiece among the first of modern era novels: This is epic drama of a Nation on the brink... played out by seemingly ordinary people's lives and the story is all the more agonisingly compelling for it.
B002DQLGHU|5.0|Instant classic, wonderful adaptation of the book. Moves quickly, filled with memorable characters. Excellent cinematography and sound quality. Charming movie for ages above 8
B004KPX4W2|4.0|It was a funny, enjoyable movie.  Bruce Willis was his usual and Helen Mirran was a riot.  We liked it.
B00CXVX1OQ|2.0|Tap tap tap tap tap.  No lateral or horizontal movement of the fighter.  Just tap as fast as you you can. No morse code tapping combos either
B009GXHOW4|3.0|i have a kindle fire. and it doesnt work on it. but then i did it on kindle fire HD and it worked. it is a cool app but it does not work on the regular kindle fire! plz fix this to work! it looks like lots of fun but i can not use it!
B008RA3X5E|1.0|Paid for the app only to find it has adware. Unacceptable, Amazon. Screen your apps better. If this was more than $0.99 I'd be demanding a refund.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I love it.  It's great, compact, sturdy, light and the color is great. I would only change one thing and that is a place for a stylus.
0812986180|2.0|I was very reluctant to pick this book up, since I had a feeling it would annoy me but, as a completeist, I had to read it after I finished watched the Netflix show of the same name. I did not expect things to be similar. That would just be silly. I also did not expect to be rolling my eyes at every time Piper mentioned her blonde hair, blue eyes, or Smith education, but I did. We get it: pretty, educated, blonde blue-eyed girls don't usually end up in prison. Yes. It's compelling to read the experiences of one but does it really have to be mentioned every few pages? Give us readers a little credit!<br />Piper also has a tendency to come off as elitist, and judgey. And sure, again, we know that people in prison are not necessarily the best and brightest but sometimes her passing judgement comes off as just...mean. In one part, she actually ponders how an overweight woman could have a prison lover that isn't fat. Egads! A fat person attracting a fit one? How is that possible ::roll eyes::<br />Aside from her attitude, it's just so very obvious that even in prison, she is of the upper crust of society. It's so obvious that her experience is not typical - visits every week, always a large amount of money flowing in to spend at the commissary, constant letters and books from family and friends; a friend even created a job for her to have upon her release! Prison in these circumstances sounded like no big deal - akin to dorming in college rather than serving time for a crime committed. It is only until the last month or two of her time that Piper experiences something far less cushy than at her previous location.<br /><br />Overall, it was a light read which kept me entertained well enough, but never really climaxed to a point where I was fulfilled as a reader. I wish I learned more about her prison friends. I wish I knew more about that gripping loneliness or how shunned Piper felt. This book seemed to only scrape the surface.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book is amazing. It is enjoyable, and it makes you think. Read this book. Maybe it will be a simple read for you, or maybe it will have the same effect for you that it had for me. Which is, completely life changing. Ender's Game is exciting the whole way through. It is possibly the best book I have ever read.
B001XUNOSQ|5.0|You can not go wrong with happy feet.  My little niece loves this movie! When it is on it is all about Mambo
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|It would receive 5 stars but ...<br />... Support for Chromebook?  Doh!<br /><br />So long as it works as well as it does with all my other devices I won't complain further.<br /><br />Shipping was forever, so if you order hold on tight...it'll be awhile.<br /><br />Beyond that ... Love it!  Shipping and Chromebook issue brought it down a star.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|This book was very riveting.... Inside the mind of a 5 year old boy and what his world looks like. Would recommend this book for people to read.
B004SZHIR6|5.0|As an enthusiastic fan of Terry Pratchett I couldn't wait for my kids to be old enough to read/ listen to his books for young adults. We've been enjoying his Tiffany Aching series & Maurice audiobooks while driving during the past 2 years. I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw that my favorite Terry Pratchett book (Going Postal) was made into a movie!!! I got it last week & my 11, 13  year old and I watched it together. It was amazing!! Highly recommended & to get the best experience read a few of his books so you can get into Pratchett's British dry humor.<br />It was appropriate for my 11 & 13 year old kids<br />It wasn't scary for their ages<br />It was very entertaining with a little bit of education on supply and demand and how the business world & advertising worked.<br />All in all a great family movie (about 3 hours long)
B00BDAP66E|4.0|Ok, everything is awesome, great app, just one thing. Make it so you can add managers/admins c: then it will be 5 stars! (:
B00AREIAI8|3.0|GREAT FUN MY DAUGHTER LOVES IT,PLAYS IT FOR HOURS.<br />WOULD RECCOMEND TO ANY HORSE LOVER.<br />GREAT GRAPHICS AND GAME PLAY.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like the way this game plays. The options are great. Lots of variety. The only downside is the lack of sleep I am getting. I highly recommend
B004G600A4|5.0|My entire family loves this movie. It is very cute and perfect for family night. Highly recommend it for boys and girls.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I love this game! I play it every single night before I go to bed as part of my nightly routine! wish it were easier to get more free credits!
B000V6MQV4|5.0|One of the best out there... Have always liked this...  She Will Be Loved - That one gets me every time.
B005K17RU0|2.0|Mississauga Ontario is being shown as someplace on the north shore of lake superior. That is just wrong.<br />will check more for other errors and will report. Also no obvious quick link to radar maps
B0002HZLWI|5.0|Love these blocks... Ever since we bought these... we have spent HOURS playing with them. Great purchase, lots of fun, educational, lots of laughs.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Baldacci is great. Robbie is quite a neat character. Great story line. I love baldacci's stuff! I recommend him highly.
033041965X|5.0|Have started with Baldacci's first and am making my way through from Absolute Power.  Sure knows how to keep up the guessing game as to who did what to who and why.  This one Total Control had me in tears at the end.  Keep them coming.
B009NQZVKG|4.0|Another great &#34;Sigma&#34; novel from James Rollins.  Great new story line that evolves the characters and brings in some new ones.  Can't wait for the next Sigma adventure.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|this app has always worked for me I enjoy it, I don't have any complaints as of yet but I will post if I do..
B002V091K2|5.0|I have decided to read some of jodi books.  This book was very good.  It kept me thinking.  It brought it to real life  It was sad and a great story.  I would encourage you all to read this
B0064X7FVE|4.0|this app has always worked for me I enjoy it, I don't have any complaints as of yet but I will post if I do..
B002XTBEDI|5.0|I love almost anything created by BBC and this certainly is at the top.  I enjoyed this as much as the Jane Austin stories.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|this app has always worked for me I enjoy it, I don't have any complaints as of yet but I will post if I do..
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Love this game sooo much, its funny and the minions are just like in the movie.  No problem when running the game
B0094BB4TW|5.0|this app has always worked for me I enjoy it, I don't have any complaints as of yet but I will post if I do..
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|Love the game. Buy I believe there are people in the game cheating. There is no way to have 90,000 points right at the start of the week.
B005HSL626|4.0|this app has always worked for me I enjoy it, I don't have any complaints as of yet but I will post if I do..
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I was very excited to watch this series from start to finish!  This season came very quick and in perfect condition.  The only complaint I have is that I am  unable to fast forward or rewind the DVD in my blue ray player.  I can ffd and rwd other DVD's so I know that it is not a faulty blue ray player.  But its a small sacrifice for the wonderful series and great price! I would highly recommend!
B0089LOG02|5.0|Interesting view into a little known event in history.  Great historical perspective of the orphans shipped to the midwest, and great character development as well.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|Makes you really think.. Starts out easy and gets progressively more interesting.  My 6 yr old plays it once in a while and it is cool to see what he comes up with
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This book was fun to read. I had it finished in no time at all. It is a cross between Harry Potter and Super Natural.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Basic runner with awesome visuals and a variety of obstacles.  Fun for my kids... Fun for me, but way tougher than it looks
B0036S4B6M|5.0|I loved this book.  It was well written and it was an interesting subject.  I know it is now a TV show, but I strongly suggest reading this book, too.
B004132HZS|5.0|Cumberbatch and Freeman really bring the characters to life. This is an awesome show! Can't wait for the third season!
0425263924|5.0|Great story lines and romances all in one! I love...love...love this book and the other ones as well! I can not wait for the next one.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|I've always been partial to the original series, so these movies rate right up there for me--with the exception of the Motion Picture, which was one of the worst movies ever! Very boring--hadn't seen it in about 20 years, tried to watch it again and ended up shutting it off. The other five were great and this set was worth purchasing just for them.
B0054SMID0|2.0|In the movie, he was portrayed as a slime bag, but in the book he was portrayed more honestly. The book was much better!!!
B000A6CLL0|5.0|Although the original series is still my favorite, this is a close second, with the first three seasons being the best. Season four was horrible; I was very disappointed with the direction it took.
B00E3IZIM0|3.0|Don't expect a good story or performance. Its all eye-candy. CGI was well done, and the fight sequence were great. But if you are like me, someone who looks for holes in the story, there's plenty in this movie.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Love the amazon app. It was a perfect way to catch up with this show in time for season 4!
B007IWG3WC|5.0|Lets face it, we've been disappointed with shark movies since about the time Jaws 3 came out, but now the brilliant filmmaker a deliver quality content.<br /><br />Not only do we get sharks, we get mutant sharks, genetically engineered into crazy intelligent killing machines. Mix that in with Samuel L. Jackson getting the best movie death of his career and Ice Cube's comedic undertones, you make for a great movie.<br /><br />This ones become a classic in our household.
1892005034|5.0|Great book, very helpful for learning a way of communication that connects people and helps them take responsibility for their feelings and actions.
B00275EHJG|5.0|Toy Story 3 has been viewed many times and is loved by our toddler. The entire family has enjoyed the Toy Story series.
B004478AS4|5.0|Let Africans speak for Africa, we need to hear their story of colonization.  This story lays out the experience, putting the reader in the village of those experiencing the crashing of their culture; the center can not hold and things fall apart.
B002N7RAH4|5.0|Hot Fuzz is both an homage to and a satire of the &#34;buddy cop&#34; movie genre. It is quite excellent, and I highly recommend it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|amazing! !!took me a whole day but was so fun. I wish there were levels available though because even with some help on the last 3 levels, 10levels aren't enough.
B000FC0P9E|5.0|I'm crying<br />All these feels omg<br />This is my first Stephen king book too<br />But yeah I'm sobbing<br />That's how good it is
1423101502|5.0|AWESOME BOOK reccomended book get it now one of the best books i have ever read it It needs five star
B000FC1MCS|2.0|Not for me.<br /><br />A book of gimmicks and too cutesy.  It had potential in the beginning but lost me after a while.
0307720748|5.0|I'm not even done yet, but I have to say BUY THE BOOK. Branson is one of the coolest people alive. The book will have you hooked from the first page until the last. It's gotta be one of the greatest entrepreneur autobiographies of all time.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|My grandson got me to download this for him. After he went home, it was up to me to keep playing. There are a variety of levels for each of 3 seasons of games. It helps develop visual perception (needed for geometry). It's fun to play.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Loved this movie!  Great action, humor and the best cast of actors for this type of film.  I can't wait for the next one!
B00EI6E17A|5.0|I Give Applause 5 stars. Its an amazing song I love it. Different from what she has released in past, but I cannot stop listening to it. Can't wait till ArtPop is released, ill be very ecstatic. I love Gaga & Applause!
6305128952|5.0|When I first saw this film I was so emotionally effected.  I have had horse mostly all my life and this is something that is really true.<br />I was excited when I could by this.  I will watch it a lot.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this show.  My only disappointment was finding out the actor playing Matthew Crawley is not coming back and so he apparently has been killed off.  Or, hopefully someone else will step in and take his place.  I wonder.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I use it all the time; it's so standard that it's almost  pointless to review it; it's like reviewing Java.
B009GX69RK|5.0|Io e this show! It has incredible writing and wonderful acting.  I haven't found a show that was this much fun in a long time
B0050DZN4K|2.0|I just never seemed to get into this app; I didn't relate the initial setup options. I finally removed it from my phone.
B00DO0ZNK0|5.0|I came to Sleep late in life. It is what I have been missing. I think I'll go listen now.
B006PZBR8S|5.0|The cinematographics were great, I can't wait for the next installment of this movie. Way to Go!! Huge Jackman was great
B009C7ZQM4|3.0|Does what it says on the tin without any frills.  Would like to have some more control overall, but what do you expect for the price?
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Great service.  Favorite show on PBS TV.  DVD in excellent shape.  Will look forward to getting next season's as well.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|I love playing this game because it is very difficult to win it. The statistics make it interesting because it is hard to keep the win percentage. Above 70 percent.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is nice and direct. It flows without the quirks other games have. It is just plain fun for all ages.
0312330537|2.0|This is a very nearly good book with harrowing scenes and vivid detail. Having never been to Bombay, the author brings the city to life with unique and compelling characters. It also, succumbs to bombast and would be improved by taking a machete to its 900+ pages. The relationship between the protagonist and his lover Karla while exciting and rousing through the first 500 or so pages peters out. After 700 pages I wanted to scream just get over her! Why do you feel anything for her anyway? She's a cold dead fish in a beautiful package. The story itself falls apart after 600 pages but I had to slog on because of the investment I had already made. After the final fight I didn't much care if Linbaba was killed or not. Actually, I wished he had been mortally wounded. At least there would have been a climax to this bombastic effort.
B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|Interesting premise, but lots of assumptions and logical inconsistencies.  Sometimes the Bible is authoritative, more often not.  It does paint an interesting picture of the Palestine of the time.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I am addicted to pinterest and love to use it on my down time. This app is super great to use and I love  the  format. Great to use, I highly recommend!
B007N8RULO|5.0|Great game to pass the time away at you doctors app. Time goes by really fast  !!! LOVE IT !!!!!!
B0012GTZC0|5.0|Fast pace story that keeps you wanting more.  Sorry to have it end but could not wait until the conclusion.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Nicholas Sparks is one of my favorite authors.  The stories are always very realistic. Never a dull moment and holds my interest at all times
B009WUBERW|4.0|Good movie. ~ Entertaining ~ Nice to watch while satellite was down. Why do they want so many words on reviews?
B0094BB4TW|5.0|app works great, doesnt crash or freeze, very reliable, a must have for kindle fire users! highly recommomend to everyone!
B00CH87HF4|5.0|it is fantastic the graphics the story line the powers and stuff entirely amazing I play this game for hours good job
B004VMUS9G|5.0|clock works great, is nice and loud to take you up from the deepest of sleeps, easy features to customize your alarms!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I loved this book! My friend recomended it to me and I was not disapointed. This story jumped right in and didn't let up. Just when you would think you could see it slow down and you could judge the next step there was a fun but great twist. I know this will be one I will read a few more times.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|this is one of the most addicting games ever, it is soo cool to take care of your dragons, its like a zoo for dragons, amazing!
B00CXVX1OQ|3.0|Not enough control over types of punches otherwise it is a fairly entertaining game but it does get repetitive quickly
B00632HWOG|5.0|i need to be connected constantly and this makes it so much easier to keep track of my emails and to respond.
0618918248|5.0|&#34;religion' indoctrinates its followers by a weekly (or more) pounding of the stories of the bible and a preacher/rabbi/whoever interpretation or manipulation of its contents. The attendees, readers, conscripts are effectively brainwashed and have no tolerance for any other views. I know this, I live with such a person. I've read the bible, attended church from early childhood to the time I figured it out and stopped believing in myths and ancient lore. She has no doubt her book is the 'word of god' and won't tolerate any other view. I read and enjoyed Dawkins. He's sharp, clear, specific in his observations and critiques. Anyone with a thinking brain (not just a take in spew out blob of stuff) will learn something, improve their understanding of the world, and enjoy the read. So, enjoy!!
B004SIIBGU|5.0|i love amazon and ebay, its a great app to have, i often find i hop on ebay when im bored or waiting for something to finish, its great!
B00942Y4IY|3.0|Wish they had hired an aggressive editor and given her the authority to make this a taut sci-fi thriller.<br /><br />Kurt Russell seemed to have a lot more fun in Big Trouble in Little China.
0618918248|5.0|Great book. Richard Dawkins is a true generous but can be a bit condescending at time. Good read if you want to sit down and have and have an open mind on what he is stating. It is a very well written and researched argument,
B00499NHLC|4.0|Sherlock Holmes recast in modern day terms, brilliant, arrogant but fallible. A loyal Watson. Both the actors are very good at their roles. Screenplay has forgivable holes. Makes for enjoyable evenings.
B000TSRJ8E|5.0|Love Billy Joel and the Record and casing was in great shape. Thank you and would buy from this user again.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Glad amazon prime is streaming season 3 for free.  Storyline and characters kept me watching! Looking forward to season 4.
B000VYX8PE|4.0|This is a great book, but the kindle version has skipped and reapeted pages,halfway through the book. I waited a couple minutes and it recovered.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|great and very easy to use.I love it.I always use it.whenever I use it, it comes up in two seconds.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Not enough bingos...have to Buy power ups and then still hard to get bingos. Also hard to complete rooms for the same reason.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Great App, love it. Please let me know if there are any updates.  I live in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina so this is a very handy device.
B00007KQA3|5.0|Did not like the film - too boring. Would not recommend this film to any one. Not worth the cost.
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|Doesn't seem to update on kindle an if your bored and need to kill time this game works perfectly for that.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Fun game cool graphics the Minions are adorable as always. The one negative is the in app purchasing, getting people to spend real money on virtual outfits and such is ridiculous!
B008035H16|4.0|Truely inspring story! Tony Hiesh's vision and the story of zappos is really interesting. ashame you can't get the full version on kindle :(
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|Addictive and fun to play. What else to you really need from a take you can play on the go?
B009KS4XRO|1.0|I realized thar this isn't what I'd enjoy doing. Sorry. Also there were too many options to be considered. Also, I'd prefer something a little more educational.
B00CL68NOG|3.0|The movie was OK, could have done a better job at acting.  I was looking for more funny stuff, did not happen
1616550414|5.0|Any Zelda fan should read this book. It provides all the connections between games and tells the backstories that are not always told to us in the games.
1476712042|1.0|I would rather spend eternity eating shards of broken glass than read another sentence in this horrendous abyss of stupidity.<br /><br />How could anyone in their right mind enjoy this dross, much less find it \\"romantic\\"? The protagonist is a mawkish, driveling moron and the love interest is a pugilistic wanker with bipolar disorder.<br /><br />This book is the worst thing to happen to literature since the 10 May, 1930.<br /><br />If you're actually considering purchasing this book, I caution you against it.<br /><br />Please don't make the same mistake I did.
B00005JLEU|5.0|This anime movie was really great I enjoyed watching it and it came in at perfect shape I was really happy when it came to me
0062255657|1.0|I could NOT get into this story!  It was weird and confusing...I'm not sure if the whole thing is make-believe.  This type of fiction/fantasy-story telling is just not my taste.  REALLY disappointed I spent the $ for this book!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I think this is the best bingo game out there always bonus games and credits just all kinds of fun ...
B00006CXSS|5.0|I'm not going to try to rehash what everyone else has said, but this is by far my favorite HBO show or miniseries ever.  It keeps you glued to your seat.  Just about everything about this is interesting:  the characters, the connection to the real life people, the settings, the battle scenes, the direction, the acting, etc.  I have watched this several times and if you buy this I'm sure you will as well.<br /><br />The only problem is that sometimes you say, \\"Why is Ross from friends fighting in WWII?\\"
B003AYMZO2|5.0|For years I ignored Breaking Bad since I thought the premise (chemistry teacher with lung cancer makes crystal meth to afford treatment and support family) was too weird.  Was I missing a treat!  Breaking Bad is the first TV series since The Sopranos to really grab me.  Super acting, writing and direction.  Clever plot lines and dark, edgy humor.  The beautiful, brooding New Mexico desert hovers over everything and everyone.  Don't miss it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|The title says it all really! I love it but I wish there were more levels! I find it fun and not too challenging! I would recommend it wholeheartedly and would ask the developers for more floors please!
B0054SMID0|5.0|Great acting vehicle for Mc....  Taut, intelligent, well paced, acting good thru out. well directed and shot. suspenseful, high entertainment.
B00AYXNKIC|5.0|this is da best racing game EVER!!! loved it offordable and the family loves it!! if u r looking 4 a game that's better than bikerace get dis now!!
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|as a musician and producer of my own material  I know what a labor of love it is to make a song... sing.  This documentary is itself a labor of love. Thank you Dave Grohl.  All based on the faith of two early adopters of production value and a piece of equipment. Who knew?
B009O07NMA|5.0|Very high powered! A definite buy... Play this in the car and you will be bumping along..I recommend this CD
B001C4AFOY|5.0|This is a beautifully acted movie with many faces familiar to a viewer who enjoys British movies and TV. In addition to very compelling performances the movie is enhanced with lovely music which brings considerable luster to the film plus marvelous scenery and settings. The whole experience is rewarding but left me grateful to not be a member of the British royalty.<br /><br />I am not a historian and do not feel qualified to speak to the movie's historical accuracy; what I can say with conviction is the movie leaves you with a sense of completion and satisfaction that can help bring your day to a happy close.<br /><br />The Young Victoria is suitable for the entire family and will bear repeated viewings; I recommend it highly.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|.A lot of fun,  exciting, cute.  I have it and so does my son.  Love those little guys. Thanks so much.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My son begged for this App and it hasn't disappointed me (or him) yet. It's loads of fun and the tunes from the movie's make you want to dance. It's got great appeal to all ages and is difficult but not impossible to beat the levels. It keeps challenging the player from level to level.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|This book is very thought provoking.  I liked some parts, others I thought were too technical.  The unusual interpretation of heaven is different from any I've read.  Toward the end, it seemed repetitive.
0060555661|1.0|when i opened the package, the books cover is rippen off and the pages of the book has dirt in it.
B00BEOYPCK|5.0|I know it came out a little before summer, but this has been my go to chillin jam. Start to finish excellent
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|It was an extremely different book then what I typically read.  This book is very whimsical and something I began to think would be better suited for my teenagers.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|The amazon cloud works from home and office. Hundreds of pics are available and usable. Accessible from anywhere for emails, upload or download.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This book reminded me of Gone Girl.  I thriller with a few twists but starts to become predictable. Characters were very likable.
B009GEAPYW|5.0|This is a different take from the other batman comics I have read and seen.  If you love batman you will love this movie.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I saw the movie and loved it. I even enjoyed the book more. I'm a huge Eagles fan and could relate to a lot of the references to the team. Go Eagles!!!
B00CCCF4NW|5.0|This album is like riding a dark purebred colt bareback through the neon lit streets of some strange futuristic city.  Bass that pumps through your body like sonic bullets of awesomeness.
6301735048|5.0|I think this is one of Kevin Costner's best movie.  I think this movie did not get the credit it so deserves.  EXCELLENT!!!
B008RTE08E|5.0|What a great video by the best rock band in the last seventy-five years. I am a Beatles fan forever.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I really enjoy this app.I was very surprised that it was free but I'm glad it is.There are only two things that kinds bothered me.The first was that for one of the costumes the price changes every time I check.The second is that the app had a new update.When I updated my app I found that I no longer had access to the other level styles.I still highly recommend this app!
B0057UAE54|4.0|This album still holds up after thirty-five plus years.  I've always loved the virtuoso guitar work--in particular, the talk box.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|What more is there to say??  I love being able to pop this up and keep in touch with all my social networking.  Works well for its purpose.  Very easy to use.
B004QZ9PLU|2.0|This book was somewhat boring and far-fetched.  It also felt too familiar.  While the book wasn't necessarily &#34;bad,&#34; it didn't inspire me.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like this app and use it often to pass the time.  I really like it and it works very well.  My only disappointment is that every time you start a new game, it gives an ad that you have to get out of first.  So not necessary to advertise every single time!!  I get sick of that feature.  Other than that, I would still recommend it.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|A true classic.  I enjoyed the Goonies when it was first released.  And it is great to watch it with my kids.  Best part is it's FREE!  Not available on Netflix either.
B00AFCEIB0|3.0|I haven't used this much, and when I do, I sometimes can't find what I am looking for.  I need to use it more often so I get the hang of it.  I am sure with practice I could recommend it more.
B002EDH0FE|5.0|Too lazy to write a long review. Was a really good movie and the point of view was amazing and descriptive.
B007AL48UK|4.0|This is a fun game, I really enjoy it, but the graphics could be a little bit darker, like the cloud tiles.
B00CLL1UY6|4.0|I was given a copy of this ebook by the author in return for my review.<br /><br />I got into this book a lot quicker than I did the previous one, falling in love with Sebastian and his mother almost instantly. The pair of them came alive in my head and I could see them going about their lives.<br /><br />The story has a lot of history in it, as the previous book by this author did but I found the balance between it and the characters was more to my liking in this one. I think it's pretty spot on for the type of history book it is as well.<br /><br />The only slight niggle for me was that there seemed to be some characters from the first book re-skinned with new names. There was another Lesbian couple where one relied solely on the other and a lady patroness who helped out and got involved with the lives of the main family in a bit of a similar way. I found myself a little dissapointed at the introduction of these characters and I wondered if they'd only been put in to flesh out a cast that was already varied enough for me.<br /><br />I look forward to the next installment in this series of books.
B004GJDQT8|3.0|It seems to work OK, I think I will wait until my next purchase before I raise the rating higher.
B005V2S7FW|1.0|Lastpass was a big mistake. Do not even think to go with this company. Be worry about your interaction with this company. You will be left in dark and they will tell you well we can not help you
B009WUBERW|3.0|Not great but fun to watch great to see all the hero's from the glory years of action flicks a good watch
B001KZI2WW|4.0|Super comfortable.  LOL at people giving 1 star reviews citing \\"frayed\\" fabric when the shoe is made specifically to look frayed.  Lol at people giving 1 star reviews because Croc's size runs small.
B003EI2EH2|3.0|I don't know what to say here... I mean, the stories are entertaining, but really - he talks about eating as much as a family of four and losing weight.  I just don't know that I can buy into that.  I might try to read it again later, maybe I can get a different mind set.
1612680011|1.0|Talk about opium for the masses... skip this book and get back to the real deals: Think and Grow Rich, Millionaire Next Door, and 7 Habits of Highly Successful People.  Those three ought be the cornerstones of your personal success library.  Maybe throw in How To Win Friends and Influence People.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Works good so far a real review is premature as of today..<br />I find it is as expected and easy to side in initial usage. This review I do not like . You put requirement on how much I have to write and the formats...You just made this a chore!!!  I do not plan to give any more feedback!!!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|a story like GONE WITH THE WIND (the book, NOT the movie)  it is truly fabulous.<br />great xmas gift for any friend or family
B00CWY76CC|3.0|addictive, but short on instructions. I was a little lost at first. once I got the gist it was fun.
B005LAIHZY|3.0|Great kid movie my little loved it is always watching the movie, liked the arrival time for the movie on time.
B0083Z614S|5.0|To re-enter the garden after 20+ years. I could still &#34;see&#34; it as I did then. Thanks to Amazon, offering classics like this for free, rereading once beloved tales again is made so easy.<br />It's like reuniting with old friends.
140006922X|5.0|Who was Jesus, the man, the historical figure, the Messiah? After reading this well researched historical version of his earthly life some of the questions surrounding his existence were answered and yet many were not. How can we expect to truly know anyone, let alone this man, after the handing down of oral tradition and the translation of these stories through several languages? The book is lovely, it is humanizing and yet still credits Jesus with his other-worldly abilities. I do not think it diminishes the image of The Christ in any way shape or form, but enhances our understanding and longing to know Jesus the man.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I thought I might like this version of mahjong so I purchased it with amazon gold coins.  It is fantastic and so much fun I'm only half way through the boards and I cant put it down.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love playing this game but I find that I keep going back playing Planto alot because I run out of powerup's & keys when I run out of bingo coins I move on to my other(6) bingo games on my kindle fire.
B004VRK436|4.0|I really do enjoy this movie, however if compared to Jumanji, I found it to be the lesser of the two. The younger brother while meant to be felt sympathy for, just came off as irritating sometimes and so I felt less of what they were trying to provide.<br /><br />I did enjoy the effects, the characters and events and I don't regret owning this blu ray, but when compared to the movie it follows, I prefer Jumanji.
B005C6HGSG|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It was a fun and easy read. Gave a good look into what made Bobby Bobby.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Graphics are great!  I find it hard to use the bow, but will get better I am sure.  Good for all ages.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I Love this game so much. If you want to make your own town or you want any kind of pet, littlest pet shop is your game
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is the best bingo game out there.  They always have new and fun rooms and its not hours between balls.  I recommend that everyone plays[[ASIN:B009KS4XRO BINGO Blitz - FREE Bingo + Slots]]  today.
B00BYM5I1O|5.0|I am a lifelong fan of Guy's music and this album adds to an incredible repertoire of tunes.  I particularly like the waltzes and the title track tribute to Suzanna.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I enjoy this game very much. It is much better since I turned off the background noise. Very addicting and really fun.
B00BUAEYVK|2.0|I was disappointed in this film. The plot was not impressive. However, the ACTION was GOOD.<br />It's time to kill any further projects.
B00CZAYNOC|5.0|The album was everything I have come to expect from what has become my favorite band and more... In my opinion they are making a name for themselves as one of the great metal bands of all time..
B004JN1CW4|5.0|I loved the entire series. Great read! I can't describe how much I've enjyed the books by James Dashner. Yay
0062255657|5.0|Like a magical children's story, but not.  It's for adults, but it gives us magic and wonder and a glimpse into a child's world.  I read it in 2 days - and it took me that long because I was obliged to sleep and do other things some of that time
B001B67VR2|5.0|...if this album is good or not, but that is one SEXY photo.  Very well done.  Five stars just for that.  :)
0143120530|5.0|This is a really nice book! Joshua is a real person lime me and you! Just goes to show what discipline can do ...
B00APJLY0Q|4.0|My Grandkids just keep watching it over and over. We pick up new things we didn't spot before every time we watch it.
0743289692|5.0|It's just one more personal story, but discusses one of the most important dramas we face today - the deeply rooted intolerance in Islamic countries, and that bigotry cannot be hidden behind the excuse of cultural differences.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|If you have even a slight interest in running, or if you want a compelling sporting competition saga, you should read this book.  A gripping story about people who run ridiculous distances in crazy conditions, the story is mixed with sidebars on physiology, medicine, anthropology, and nutrition, and it's all tremendously entertaining.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Hosseini is a wonderful storyteller, creating a reach tapestry of events and characters. Highly recommended! Can't wait for his next book!
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Have gone on marathons with this game with my gaming group.  The trading makes it really fun.  Hard to explain the rules but everyone gets it once you start playing a few turns.  Would highly recommend.
B006LSZECO|2.0|This is another book I am not enjoying.  When I read the review it looked like it would be interesting and a good story but when I started reading it just is not holding my interest.  When I have nothing else to read maybe I'll try again.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This fame is so fun everybody should play it if they don't play it there crazy have fun playing this game
B009R659L8|5.0|She is one of my favorite authors.  I have read just about everything she has written.  Books are well written and keep you guessing.  Another author I find hard to put  down once I start reading.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this is a great game that keeps you on your toes. it works great on my kindle fire. only problem is I get so in to it I don't get some if my work done lol:)
B00BRUQ7ZY|2.0|The book is based almost entirely on what is written in the Bible and generic circumstance of the era of concern.  Although it is interesting and probably likely interpretation, lack of external facts about Jesus himself was disappointing. The last third of the book are notes, it would have been better to merge the notes to the main text, cut the repeatition, and  shortened the book for better read.
B004LOMB2Q|2.0|I selected this because I could see the same, synced information on all my devices.<br /><br />I can see it, however it fights being updated and marking tasks Complete.  Also, it looks and functions differently on each device.  Then it shows an advertisement for &#34;Evernote for Dummies&#34;.  An app like this should not require a manual to learn it.<br /><br />Bottom Line:  It's not intuitive and worse yet, it doesn't function the same on a laptop, Kindle, and mobile phone.  It isn't worth the effort.
B0063M22QO|3.0|like the game, but this version could include some more elaborate game patterns.  The tiles are very clustered together and they keep trying to sell you the next version.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I like it a lot. its a great game and its real fun too. good graphics I guess... but yeah. I like it.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|It's not as good as season 1 but it's still pretty good. I would recommend this to someone to watch.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The series is awesome!! My only gripe is each season is too short and too long a wait for a new season!
B00CXVX1OQ|5.0|monkey boxing is a simple punch and block game. controls are very simple. graphics  are  stunning. this game works great on kindle fire. and its a very addicting game. you can customize your monkey to how you like it. i havent found any glitches yet. :D this is a great time killer or a short game session. i highly recomend this game.  it is not violent; but it is a great simple boxing game. btw... love the idea of MONKEY boxing.
B0031TZ8TU|5.0|I had read On Wings of Eagles 25 or 30 years ago, but after having seen the movie Argo and reading the book Argo, I decided to read it again.  I'm not quite finished with it, but I'm enjoying it as much, if not more, than I did when I read it all those years ago.
B00338QENI|4.0|This book did a great job telling Henrietta's story. I enjoyed it immensely. I did get a little lost with some of the continuing story of where the cells went, the better part of the story was about Henrietta and her family.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|An unusual and wonderful real story - certainly has to classified as hidden History - and the music is excellent
B006O5XYWG|4.0|Caesar looks a little too human-like and how does a vial of drugs pass on traits from mother to baby chimp when we know it can only be through genes. However, the story is great and is very exciting.
B008RTE08E|4.0|As Paul says get it if only to see &#34;I am a walrus&#34; music video. Rather lose construction. But it was only to be on BBC once?
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|The order arrived within the time specified. I got this set through a sale on Amazon for 1/2 price.  Tons of hours of bonus material and very easy to care for box.  Great  value for the price, glad i got it.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I recommend this game. The bright Colors make the tiles easy to read. Mahjong is an old favorite of mine and I am enjoying it.
1609611543|5.0|Packed with meaningful , researched, & useful information.  A must read for those searching for the truth concerning gluten & other foods and their physiology on our bodies.  Provocative...money well spent.  Dr. Davis did his due diligence...a valuable reference source.<br /><br />Steve & Betsy Stefanik
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|There is standard: aliens occupy earth and one nicely delivered nuke solves the problem. I really liked visual effects tho. Nice cinematography. If you don't expect a lot than a movie can offer laid back pleasure (you can text mes and talk on the phone in the same time without loosing part of the plot).
B00011D1OA|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time. I highly recommend it to anyone and everyone. You haven't lived until you've seen &#34;My Fair Lady&#34;.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Excellent again Mr Aslan looking at Jesus as a historical figure. Jesus for me became more real person than ever.
1590302273|5.0|Siddhartha held an honored place on the bookshelves of the young during the seventies being the first serious book read by many- a seminal read for students. Hesse was cool for the college bound youth who often read his works as window dressing to impress others.<br /><br />Siddartha is a story about a journey taken by a young brahmin from wealth to the life of a travelling mendicant. Thus begins a well known journey with Siddartha and his friend Govinda-a journey that begins with the utterance of OM and Siddartha's announcement that he will leave his father for a life of a shramana or holy man. One day the two youths hear of the arrival of a Buddah-Gotama.<br /><br />The two travellers spend time with the Buddah only to part ways after Siddartha finds that the Buddah's teaching of the unity of all things is self contradictory or broken by the Buddah's teaching of the liberation of the self from the world. Siddartha departs and Govinda stays with the Buddah to become a monk. Siddartha realizes that in the process of tearing his ego down he lost himself so he meets a rich worldly woman Kamala who introduces him to the pleasures and tasks of the world...its hedonism and wealth...the realm of samsara. At the point of revulsion with the world he collapses near a river were he befriends a ferryman and becomes his assistant.<br /><br />The ferryman and the river are in fact inseparable. After a failed suicide attempt, a monk guards Siddhartha in his deep sleep and he awakens to find the now aged Govinda...the cycle repeats itself as he later finds Kamala and discovers his unknown son by her. A son who torments the ferryman and Siddartha and, as Siddartha did to his own father, disappears into the forest in contempt for the asceticism of the two old men. The cycle continues as the river becomes a continuum of time with past, present and future existing as one in the river and Govinda returning again in the continuum of Siddartha's life.<br /><br />Siddhartha becomes the new ferryman and OM once again returns as a unity as the Siddartha relates to worldly people and their mundane lives with love- a love born by Siddartha's own life struggles. No longer is Siddartha separated from the \\"child people\\" - they are not alien but familiar. Samasara is not an illusion (Maya) but it is intertwined with nirvana in a tapestry revealed in the river...a dying carp becomes a baby, then a murderer, then an executed murderer all in the time continuity demonstrated by the river itself.<br /><br />Siddartha learns to love the world by ceasing to compare it to a standard of imaginary perfection and learning to be part of it. The way of the Buddah is replaced by the immersion of the self in the world and time. Govinda sees this immersion as he kisses Siddartha's face in veneration.<br /><br />Siddartha quest reminds me of another journey taken much earlier in time. Christian's journey in Bunyon's Pilgrim's Progress. Similar perhaps but essientially diffrent.<br /><br />Christian enters the narrow gate of salvation, analogous maybe to Siddartha's decision to leave his father, only to find the path difficult but ascending. Like Siddartha, Christian is lured by the hollow vanity of the world. Christian's faith is tested by the forces of unbelief and yet each step is onward towards a heavenly paradise. Christian follows a linear ascent rather than a circle: a beginning and an end from the material to the spiritual. Christian's journey is a dichotomy pitting the physical against the spiritual. Siddartha's journey finds a seamless web, a circle, rotating between spirit and matter...<br /><br />Years ago, I read the THREE PILLARS OF ZEN by Philip Kapleau and learned that the self is an illusion which could be transcended by a state of non-self or unity with reality. The Zen archers are known for hitting a target bulls-eyes blindfolded have seemingly made themselves one with their targets. Siddartha utters something similar...<br /><br />OM is the bow, the arrowis the soul,<br />Brahmin is the arrow's target.<br />One should strike it without wavering  (Page 8)<br /><br />Govinda,as he kisses Siddartha in the end, echoes his belief \\"as if wounded by an arrow\\" that he no longer believed that both of them existed separately. The arrow does ultimately miss the mark while striking the bulls eye because the bulls eye because it doesn't exist seperate from the arrow!<br /><br />The Biblical word for sin...an aramaic word I believe... describes the errant flight of an arrow away from its target. If you sin you miss the bulls eye and stray from God's plan. The bulls eye can never be hit here because to be on target is itself an illusion...the bulls eye is a point of non-being and is not seperate from everything else. Siddartha is vindicated by the flight of the arrow targeted towards self and unity with nirvana and samasara... In contrast, Gotama's bulls eye doesn't exist as Siddartha discovers...<br /><br />Christian's bulls eye is unity and fellowship with God.is the soul,<br />Brahmin is the arrow's target.<br />One should strike it without wavering  (Page 8)<br /><br />Govinda,as he kisses Siddartha in the end, echoes his belief \\"as if wounded by an arrow\\" that he no longer believed that both of them existed separately.

B00B2JSRAS|5.0|E-Squared takes universal truths and makes them actionable...and believable! I went three-for-three in less than my first hour with some astounding results. Then, as I continued, the results continued to amaze me. Pam Grout teaches the reader to go within in a unique and successful way.
B00CXVX1OQ|5.0|What a great game! Good graphics, easy play mechanics (just two buttons) lots of achievements to earn and you're able to customize your monkey. The best part is the multi-player over local WiFi. My son and I had a blast fighting each other.
B000FCKPHG|5.0|A must read for every human, and particularly for every human parent. And teacher. And everyone else on the planet. But that's all.
B005721Y7Y|5.0|I just love Kevin Spacey in almost all his roles. It was interesting and different type of movie. I loved it!
B000PEX1IE|5.0|I've loved ghostbusters since I was a little kid, and now I can watch it anytime anywhere I have an Internet connection.
1592802974|2.0|I've read a couple of chapters (with difficulty), and have set it aside until the next rummage sale of the Property Association.  I couldn't find any useful market strategies, and felt that further reading would result in more wasted time.  Having said that, I recommend this book as a remedy for isomnia.
B0082RX1P4|5.0|A great read, particularly if the concepts of customer service or name branding are of interest to you. Definitely a little outside the box, but it made me rethink perspectives a bit.
B007KOLNXC|5.0|I always watch the episodes on TV, but like to see them again after a few days; I have also used the recorded episodes to get others involved in watching the series.
B0054SMID0|5.0|Great movie with twists and turns mixed with some comedy.  Love it when a movie draws an OMG, what just happened response.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I have enjoyed the beauty of this game in its graphics. It is a fun game as well expecially if you like Nemo.
B009V3KKXY|5.0|Have looked at all the patterns several times can't decide which one I want to make first. Love all the visuals  to guide you through the process.
B00E8JZILA|5.0|For anyone who played Telltales great The Walking Dead game, you are getting a stellar port for it on the PS Vita. You are getting the first 5 episodes of \\"Season 1\\" as it's called, and you also get \\"400 Days\\" which is an additional episode that was released as DLC in July. I'm not going to review the whole game as it's been out since April of 2012 and you can find tons of really good reviews on here and other sites for the game content, writing, music and overall design.<br /><br />For the Vita, this port is solid. I haven't played too much of it so far, but there is minimal load times, no real frame rate issues or freezing so far. After a load screen the transition into the game there can be a little bit of a frame rate issue but that happens to most games on most platforms. Playing this with headphones is the way to go, the sound design works really well with surround sound on PS3 but since the two front facing speakers on the Vita are just ok, I prefer to be more immersed in the game and play with head phones, which I'd recommend. I thought this game was great on the PS3, but like Rayman Origins, The Walking Dead is perfect for handheld gaming. When commands are prompted you can either use the right joystick to move the in-game crosshairs around or just tap the screen instead of hitting a button. I find the touch screen most useful when selecting which dialogue box I want to select, or when moving the camera, or sliding your finger across the screen to get  Lee to walk. The touch screen I think took this game to a whole new level and it's best to be played on the Vita.<br /><br />For anyone who played this on the PS3 and wants to replay it, I'd say get it for the PS Vita. For anyone who hasn't played the game at all, I'd say get it for the PS Vita. It's rare the a cross platform port gets better on systems it wasn't originally designed for, but this did. This game shines on the PS Vita, it has everything you loved about it on you main console, but with touch screen implemented and all of the episodes in one cheap, small package, you just can't do better than this. There are also supposed to be a bunch of new trophies for this version of the game, if you're into that sort of thing. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.een implemented and all of the episodes in one cheap, small package, you just can't do better than this.

B009KS4XRO|3.0|Wins don't happen very often, and it's pretty challenging to complete the rooms (I'm not a fb member, which all these games encourage.) I've seen people chat about being able to use cheats, which seems silly in a free game in which you win absolutely nothing. I keep coming back, tho.
B006LXQID8|5.0|it was a charming and delightful film.It had a certain whimsy but captured Parisian life as well.  I enjoyed it.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love the game and all the fun it provides...great prizes and like the fact you get rewarded for playing every day
B007AL48UK|5.0|I love how colorful the game is, I highly recommend it to my friends and anyone who likes mahjong games.

B0000CNY27|5.0|Escape from New York (Special Edition)  Has Kurt Russell starring. All the women in it die. That's a freakin shame!
B002NHIK1E|5.0|OMG.  I cannot believe I am a Vampire Diaries fan.  I literally just started watching the show on Netflix and I am completely addicted.  I watch three seasons in two weeks.  I have gotten no sleep being this show and I am loving every minute of it.  I did not watch the show when it first came out because 1.  Am did not want to see a series that was similar to Twilight 2.  I am too old to watch CW shows and 3.  I thought there was no way a show like this would keep me interested.  I was so wrong.  I LOVE THIS SHOW.  I am in love with Stephan Salvatore.  Damon is the vampire you love to hate, but he keeps me laughing.  The characters evolve more and more with each episode and season and I cannot get enough.  I just purchased season 4 on Amazon Prime.  It's going to be a long weekend...lol
0307279189|5.0|I've always been a runner, but slowed down when I started graduate school. This book reminded me of what I was missing... I've been running 5x/week since.<br /><br />Love to run.
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|Really liked this show.  UNFORTUNATELY I am pretty sure that this is the way things are done in Washington, DC.  Looking forward to Season 2.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Easy to play, colorful graphics, (including animals) and interesting app to build a village and working toward building a capital city.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|So enjoying the story line; the actors, costumes, etc.  hard to believe that some people feel that they are so much better than others.  Guess that it is the way it used to be.
B004G5ZY7E|2.0|Nesbo sets us up with about 10 red herrings before he finally pops the god out of the machine and solves all of Harry's problems. When I finished I felt manipulated and ripped off.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love the timer feature. It works great when I'm readying myself for sleep. I don't have to worry about the music being on all night. I also adore how I can adjust the specific sounds I hear and how loud each one ois. I would recommend this to everyone
B005LAIHHC|1.0|NO Wonder this DVD is not on Netflix or Amazon Prime.  Not funny at all. Sacha Baron Cohen you suck !
0812974611|4.0|Book was in great condition and was very strong. I have to buy four more this semester so I will probably buy from this guy!
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|This novel is a young adult title. As a high school teacher, I read a lot of YA offerings. This book was different from others in that it had real photographs of peculiar children in it. The plot was fairly original--though it included a love story, which is pretty standard in YA reading. It followed a young man on a trail of discovery, answering questions about his grandfather and his own peculiarities. I'm not sure how to explain it, because the world that Riggs creates is not like ours--or any other. It's a worthwhile read. It's quick and easy, but presents some ideas worthy of discussion and thought.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I chose this rating because the book was absolutely amazing. The battle sequences, the enemies, the surprises and all the plans were great and so thought out! There wasn't anything I could dislike in this book. I was on the edge of my seat, waiting to see how everything panned out and I seriously did not want to put my kindle down. I would recommend this to anyone who likes mythology, or even just anyone that likes a good suspense and adventure story!
B003TOMAPC|5.0|Watched it again before I went to see KA2.<br /><br />I am glad I did or I might have forgotten how good it was after the disappointment of the 2nd.
B004LQJPEG|5.0|It's good. Kind of sudden ending. What happens ? We want to know. Unfinished. But I then watched Part II; loved it. Hackman gives a s good a performance in that one as well. So do both.
B00A9X7X6C|4.0|If you are a scifi fan you will probably like this movie.  It kind of has that twelve monkeys feel to it almost as the main character fights against himself and time and ultimately his own destiny.  Interesting take on an alternate future where time travel is used by major crime syndicates.  Overall enjoyable but I am partial to this type of film.  Would recommend it.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Can't stop playing it its a awesome game to play so u should get it normally I never right a review but I like this game so much I did
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|I absolutely love game of thrones.  After watching a few episodes of the first season I was hooked.  Sadly at the time I had to travel overseas before I could finish the first season.  So I cheated and actually got all the ebooks and read them while I was gone working for a few months.  I actually have read all of them up to the last that George Martin finished which is A Dance With Dragons I believe.  It's been a while.<br /><br />Anyway if you are a fan of mid evil style action and the usual HBO high drama then this is a show for you.  I have yet to meet anyone that has not liked it.  I will admit the television show strays slightly from the books but not in a bad way at all.  For the most part the story line stays intact according to the books.  So far anyway....<br /><br />Great show watch it.
B008MEM24S|5.0|I got this and it surprised me how entertaining this app is. I just wish it had more levels, I m addicted to this game .I finish the game and I reset it and start it all over again

1904633013|5.0|I loved this little edition of Pride and Prejudice. I feel like I am listening to the movie all over again.
B00821PCJS|2.0|My biggest problem with this series is how all the survivors regularly assemble in some wide open space with seemingly no fear of aerial detection. Are we to merely accept the premise that, as advanced as the alien technology is, it cannot detect large gatherings of humans out in the open countryside? This happens time and time again throughout the series' episodes without any attempt at explanation.<br /><br />Also, the aliens always seem to make ridiculous loud noises that warn humans they are approaching before the aliens can ever see the humans.<br /><br />The aliens also roar, hiss, and growl, but seem to have no intelligible language! How can this be true of a culture that is capable of interstellar travel?<br /><br />This series is for morons.
B007EECSFA|4.0|A great summer read. Back and forth between wartime London and present day. Kept me entertained, and will definitely pass this on to my husband.
1616551607|5.0|For the price this book is amazing.  Having not even played the original 6 installments in the Final Fantasy franchise, that didn't prevent me (Or potentially you) from being floored by the beautiful artwork featured within the books pages.<br /><br />At times I found myself staring at certain pieces for hours on end, mesmerized by all the colors and bountiful details incorporated.  By far my illustrations were of Terra Branford, Final Fantasy VI's protagonist.  A must buy for any Final Fantasy fan, or even those who appreciate spell casting works of art such as this.  I love it.
B00DHNJCKQ|2.0|Story was kinda dum....you can watch this movie if you have nothing else to watch and you're really bored. Acting was good though
0671449028|5.0|I've never met a toddler who did not fall in love with this book.  Even infants enjoy the humor of it.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|game is pretty well made. despite a few minor drawbacks with multiplayer mat h making , the game itself is quite well made. gamelot usually makes quality games and this one is no different
0689835604|4.0|All babies are fascinated with their belly buttons.  This book plays on this fascination and is fun for infants and toddlers.
B00ADS98FC|3.0|This movie had a lot of hype and I think that some of the acting was a little bad, on the protagonist's part. She doesn't really do the 'tortured loner' type very well. But the songs were good.
B0001IMCDE|1.0|My son picked out the movie he wanted not checking if it was usable in the US.  Needless to say it wasn't.  Returning was a pain so I finally gave up.
B003SPCYP8|5.0|Loved the movie so much the first time, had my husband watch it this time around. He and I were definitely tearing up and fighting back emotions towards the end. A good message movie.
B009UAO1ZG|4.0|Very involving. Literate. couldn't put my kindle down.<br />This period of American history is so fascinating to me even though I lived through it.
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|Unfortunately my husband and I didn't get a chance to finish the movie. The film wasn't as interesting as the movie trailers made it seem. I would rather read the book than try to watch the movie again.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I am a HUGE fan of Kite Runner & Splendid Suns.  Those are at the top of the \\"best books I've ever read\\" list.  I thought this book was a let down.  His writing style is still fascinating, as he does a great job in creating the characters in your mind. However, it did let me down in the closure of many of the characters.  Throughout the read, I kept anticipating the pace to pick up and it never did. It's difficult to really describe what I mean without giving away the storyline.  If you're a fan of Kahled, I would still purchase it because it's not an AWFUL book,but don't expect it to measure up to the others.
B001FVV2X2|4.0|I watch the whole series in one take, while on vacation. If you enjoy unusual mystery series combined with science fiction; You will definitely enjoy the Fringe the series and will look forward to watching the second season.
0316056898|5.0|It was vey funny and being a Tina Fey and 30 Rock fan, I learned a lot about both.  Very interesting and great summertime read.
B003QSLW0K|5.0|My 4 year old loved this movie, great for the whole family. Excellent plot and story line, great animation and music.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I was honestly surprised by how much I enjoyed this. If you like quick whit, kind of sarcastic humor and humor in general, this is a good show. I am interested in law (although not corporate) and this was fun to watch (although not accurate). Still, I would higly recommend this show to anyone! I'm hooked!
B00E9O6C96|2.0|Pros: Well-constructed. Powerful enough to drive large headphones very loud without distortion. Good battery life. MicroSD slot for cost-effective expansion up to 64GB. FLAC and APE support. Headphone output and fixed-level analogue and PCM line-outs run simultaneously.<br /><br />Cons: Audible hiss with sensitive IEMs (confirmed by manufacturer). Audibly distorted playback of LAME mp3s. No ID3 support for OGG. No gapless playback in file-folder navigation. Resume playback after standby sometimes crashes the player. Dim, low-resolution screen. Lock-switch works at the software level, doesn't prevent you from e.g. turning the device on in your pocket.<br /><br />The interface shortcomings and small screen are totally acceptable in an affordable, audiophile player. Even the glitchy handling of lossy codecs is not a deal-breaker. But the hiss is just a shame. Unless you're looking at the X3 to drive electrostatic headphones that require several milliwatts of power, you might as well buy a Sansa Clip. The X3 is not audibly better.<br /><br />P.S. If you don't need a portable player, JDS Labs' O2 should have a silent noise-floor. (AFAIK, it is the only amp quiet enough to drive sensitive IEMs; even my Benchmark DAC1 hums audibly through Shure 535s!)<br /><br />P.P.S. Yes I know the 535s are overpriced and lack high-treble extension, stop judging me.
B000KJT8IG|5.0|Quite simply put this is one of the MUST WATCH Christmas movies. If you have any sort of DVD/blu-ray collection, this is one of those MUST HAVES for your collection.<br /><br />Its a movie you can watch all year round! Kids to Adults will love this movie. They honestly just don't make comedies like this anymore. Its wholesome yet has plenty of &#34;adult&#34; humor in it to appeal to the masses.<br /><br />Christmas Vacation runs the gammet of emotions. Laughter to crying. There are even a few tense.. **Scary** moments. Like when the door bell rings and the family is at the door. Most of us can attest to the horrors of having family over for Christmas. And that first nock at the door or doorbell ring send a horrific chill through your spine. And though many of us dread certain family members, we forge ahead in the spirit of the season and tolerate the often UN-tolerable in our family.<br /><br />This movie is A+ in my book.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|use it a lot..simple easy program to use with you kindle. I will type more words for the review to allow me to finish.....
B007TKT2SK|5.0|Excellent app for those that are fractionally challenged or if you are tired. A good way to see if your fractional math is correct.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|I downloaded this to use with my Kindle HD and it is so easy to use.  I give it a 10.
B00448SE4S|5.0|The video game style effects on the movie are what makes it great. It's very funny and delivers a good story.
B00CS74W0C|2.0|It's quite obvious that Sylvia Day copied E.L. James.  The first book was quite interesting, but #2 & #3 got old, real quick!
B000VK7KVQ|4.0|I liked it because it was based on a true story a scary story but a true story. It's once of the better movies i've seen this month.
B004FP1WX0|4.0|This documentary was Tastefully made and kept the outcome and message positive. The world could use more of that :)
B004Q7CIFI|4.0|Of course, what do you expect from Stephen King?  This is totally different, no horror here, but a lot of suspense.  This book really makes you think.  The only problem is the length.  It really could have been told in less pages (800+), but the further you go into the story the more you wonder how it can work out.  It's a good story that just left me unsettled by the whole concept.  Try it!!
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|Game is good keeps you wanting to find more things. Wish rooms would open more quickly and that you win more energy than other items .
B006IYG5HE|4.0|I like Jo Nesbo.  The stories are intricate and as he develops the story you are drawn in.  Harry is a sometimes unlikable character whom you wish could just get his **** together.  He's very intelligent and solves the crimes, but he's a train wreck.  That gets a little wearisome, for me.  I've read a couple of these and will probably read more.  Great writing.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Fun game. It's entertaining. Free. Different levels. Never boring. Kids love it too. Worth playing. Facebook app too. Link games. Add friends
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Loved how th author related life to the flower world. Not knowing much about the definition of what flowers mean, I felt I was educated with the beauty of the words
0061733199|4.0|this book is full of great ideas and thoughts. I hope to never need to use any of the survival techniques in this book but feel it will help me if I do.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|Can't play too long because it starts to bother my eyes, but like it occasionally.  Would recommend it to almost anyone
B007AL48UK|4.0|Keeps your fingers moving &amp; your brain working. No only do u have to match the tiles, u also have to have a strategy to clear all the tiles.
B007AL48UK|3.0|There have been about a dozen Mahjong games as the Amazon free paid app of the day in just the past 18 months including one this past Sunday called Mahjong Genius.  Of the approximately one dozen Mahjong games offered by Amazon as free apps of the day, about half of those were from app maker 24/7 Games LLC.<br /><br />On August 21, 2013, Summer Mahjong became the latest of about a half dozen Mahjong games from 24/7 Games to be the free paid app of the day in the Amazon Appstore.<br /><br />I am not going to describe the game of Mahjong here since I have seen so many of these games and most people probably know how to play them already.<br /><br />This is like your typical 24/7 Games Mahjong game.  There are about 8 different tile layouts with most of them being a Summer theme, and the traditional Mahjong tiles are replaced with Summer designs.  You have the undo feature and a hint feature that highlights two tiles that are a match for you when you are stuck.  The zooming feature that is featured in some 24/7 Games Mahjong games is missing in this release it appears.<br /><br />But compared to other Mahjong game apps from other publishers such as Mahjong Genius I mentioned above, this game lacks any variations of Mahjong.  These Mahjong games from 24/7 Games almost always have a once you tried one, you have tried them all feel.<br /><br />If you really want to know whether this is worth $0.99, my advice is to try their 247 Mahjong game which was the free app of the day earlier this year and is now free everyday in the Amazon Appstore.<br /><br />Because this is your typical 24/7 Games Mahjong game that is identical to most of their other Mahjong games other than the tiles and layouts are changed to fit a certain time of the year, I am giving this only 3 stars out of 5 stars.
0670014893|5.0|Don't expect easy outcomes or simple resolutions, but this is yet another very well written and thoughtful Le Carre spy novel.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I started it yesterday, and within the first sentence, I was in love. I got the audio book to listen to while I had a headache, but my mind demanded to comprehend every word while I tried to sleep. I have had a total of three hours of sleep in the past day, the rest of the time I have been reading and rereading this book, and crying when Augustus dies. You can definitely tell John Green wrote this book. It has the same sarcasm as he does in his Vlogbrothers videos. My favorite book and I highly recommend it. -Cheyenne
B009IH0ICG|5.0|I have heard that the chimney starters work real good.  I don't use newspaper, I use the Weber fire cubes (cut them smaller to go further) and works wonderfully.
B007SOQBCM|3.0|If I could change the quality of the video in the app like I can while watching on the web then it would be 5 stars.  It works, just with mediocre video quality.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|The movie and special affects are awesome! This is a must see movie for Marvel fans!  The actors chosen really fit the characters they play.  This was the best done Hulk.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Easy enough for the beginner - yet challenging. If you enjoy the supernatural you will like this game. Not for young children since the imagery is scary.
B00499QUK2|5.0|I love the new polish to the old murder mystery and the way Holmes and Sherlock come together.  Very Believable
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Could not be it down. Great read really enjoyed  have told several friends to read this book.  A must read
0307346617|4.0|My second reading of this book was in preparation of the release of the movie by the same name. I'm not sure it's really related to the book, because of the structure of the book and its storytelling style.<br /><br />The key is in the full title: \\"World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War.\\" The Zombie Apocalypse is a thing of the past; this is the story of how it happened and how we survived. As with Daniel Wilson's [[ASIN:0307740803 Robopocalypse]], there's no big surprise that humans have survived and/or won the war against the uprising badguys.<br /><br />World War Z's main premise is that a government-sponsored author has compiled an enormous amount of information for a government publication about the Zombie War. But he has too much information to include in the official document, so he is encouraged to compile the unused parts into a separate book and publish it separately. The result is the titular Oral History. It's broken into parts that chronologically follow the history, from early signs to The Great Panic, and eventually to fighting back.<br /><br />My only issue with this story is that it feels like a bunch of false starts. The stories themselves are engaging and interesting, but the individual recollections end a bit prematurely. It fits the style of storytelling, and there are occasional fully-formed stories, but the majority of the recollections really leave you wanting more. I suppose that's a good device to keep the reader reading, but the overall sense of satisfaction is diminished at the end.<br /><br />The best part of the story is how close you can imagine the sort of global response to other types of disasters. There are a lot of clever passages and sections in which the word \\"Zombie\\" could be replaced by a number of other \\"bad things\\" and the storyline would turn from a sci-fi horror story to a biting commentary on the state of worldwide preparedness, and the lengths to which government and the governed would go to overcome great odds.<br /><br />This is a fun, quick read that also makes mocking reference to Max Brooks' other zombie book, [[ASIN:1400049628 The Zombie Survival Guide]], which is another good read that is not entirely tongue-in-cheek.
B001BKTEZA|5.0|I would definitely recommend this tragic classic story of an American family who struggles to keep their family together against all odds.  John Steinbeck is one of my favorite writers who tells stories of people and times in our history which richly displays our past.
B00ECUARO8|5.0|This movie captures IMHO the essence of the country the story takes place. The movie is a  mixture of compelling beliefs, and realities touched over so eloquently with tones of nostalgia and romanticism.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|We have thoroughly enjoyed catching up on this fascinating drama. Very thankful to Amazon for bringing it to its Prime members.
B00DHKKN6Q|3.0|I enjoyed this game fun to play and whatch other people play nice levels and cool ... ok get the app or not ... whatever
B008BU75IQ|2.0|Way too much detail about parliamentary process, etc.  Just filler, as far as I'm concerned. Hopefully Jeffrey doesn't continue in this same vain.
B0072NWJRK|4.0|It is very interesting and morbid story that is handled very well by the author. I read the book in three days because I wanted to find out what happened to all the people who were involved with the crime. Only complaint was slightly repetitive  I also enjoyed the history of pre World War II in China. Read it,you will like this well written booki
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like this game alot it is good for little kids even older kids it can be addictive but still very very great and amazing game that y'all made so thank you!!!!!!:):)
B008602KQI|4.0|it is a good  adventure with thrilled. Specially when one has to be kill in each group. Suspense was upto last moment.
B00B0X4PIO|4.0|This story doesn't have the impact of The Kite Runner or  the harrowing drama of the two women in A Thousand Splendid Suns but works through a large cast of characters whose lives relate in some way. It begins and ends with two devoted siblings, brother and sister, the children of a desperately poor family living in a village in Afghanistan,  who are cruelly separated as children. It cleverly moves through the interconnecting lives of the other characters in the book over a period of fifty years. A less dramatic book than either of its predecessors but nevertheless evoking  the bleak poverty and lawlessness of Afghanistan whilst still revealing the author's underlying love of the country.<br />Another beautifully written contribution from an author I always enjoy reading.
B00637D114|5.0|This was great.  My grandson really enjoyed this.  I definitely would order another show again.  It was very entertaining for my grandson.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|Fun and easy to play similar to candy crush and just as addictive. Really liked the fact that it was free.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|Big Iron man fan, and this movie delivered. Great quality. Would recommend this movie. I will be watching this again.
B003YL4KS0|5.0|I'm glad I came upon this book at the beginning of my transition! Very helpful love my curls. Also love the variety they really know what their taking about not a sham.
B004HX0P2Y|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Bruce Willis! All the actors in the movie complimented each other well! The entire movie was funny, action packed,<br />and had a favor of romance! What more can a movie goer want? It was money well spent!
B008K8VDPU|4.0|I. Wish the keyboard would be two octaves. The tone quality is very good.  KEYBOARD IS GREAT!! Easy to play.  Let's.  Play music
B00DP3IGJ6|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Tom Cruise! This movie is futuristic and keeps you spellbound, because you don't ever know what going to happen<br />next! The ending of the movie was suspenseful! I loved it! It was money well spent!
0762445262|1.0|Product is not worth the money. Yes it says mini but for the price I paid, just not worth it. Also battery life drains fast and it's barley visible...Such a disappointment.
B004XWLIJS|5.0|Again another action packed movie! I love Jason Statham! He is a very good actor! I sat on the edge of my seat the entire time while watching this movie! It was money well spent!
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|I love this season, it was great and it was an awesome series. great condition too! it was awesome. yayayayayaya
B000092WD8|5.0|Steve Martin as the sadistic dentist is perfectly cast. Rick Moranis has a good singing voice. And the music throughout is toe-tapping fun.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|best movie ever. so adorable.  I love it. great movie and it was in good condition as well. so it was really nice to buy something worth ur money
B0007TKNII|5.0|Phantom is one of Weber's greatest works. The music is sweeping, emotional, beautiful. The lyrics are poems and odes of love and passion.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|Fascinating look at the time is which Jesus lived.  Aslan presents an objective look a period in history.  He is objective in a religious sense never denying Jesus might be God. He acknowledges miracles and does not dispute the possibility of a resurrection.  He concentrates on the message Jesus delivered to the people of his time and shows how that message has been &#34;messaged&#34; over the centuries.
B007SGM084|5.0|Once I started, could not put the series down.  Went back afterwards and read it again and caught more nuances about the relationship between Christian and Ana.
B00AX6KMGS|5.0|It was a very exciting and adventurous.show, I know it was not a new one but I had not seen it and enjoyed it
B004SBQAN8|5.0|loved the books and the movie did them great credit , Bay movies always hit the mark cant wait for the next one
B003Q97D48|5.0|This was definitely worth the wait!  Hopefully this will clear I some questions that I have. Thanks for offering this!
B005K17RU0|4.0|Just what I like.....short and sweet, with some minor details that are easily understandable. I appreciate the simplicity. Thank you.
B00BI73CVI|3.0|I saw a few clips from the movie during a service while piqued my interest in watching the film. It wasn't what I expected it to be about. It was also difficult to follow along with every word sung.
B00992CF6W|5.0|According to my 8 year old daughter - you can build a \\"M\\", you can build a \\"G\\", you can build a \\"you\\", you can build a \\"me\\".  You can build an angel, you can build a Steve, you can build a pool, you can build anything.
0140557741|4.0|I attended a training session where they used the pages of this book to conduct an exercise in communication.  I then purchased the book, had the pages laminated and conducted the same exercise with my team.  Aside from using this book for the exercise, I'm not sure that I would have purchased it just because.  I imagine it would be a good book for those that have young children.  There are no words so one could make up a different story each time.
B00CATSONE|5.0|This book was extremely enjoyable. The admonition to use your imagination to re interpret the world is just the thing I think the world needs. We're collectively stuck in rut, imagine a world where everyone operated on Tesla's level. I do, which is why I say we're stuck in a rut.
B00EFNXPFK|5.0|I really loved his last 'born and raised' but this record is pretty close.  The duet with Katy Perry is great!
1400064287|4.0|I would recommend this book to others. The books makes some very good point and offers may illustrations.<br />Good book.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|The plot was complicated but I enjoy figuring out what's happening.  It had an ending that was somewhat unsettling but gets you thinking.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I love how this app has so many options so that I can keep myself from ignoring the alarm in the mornings.
B000W9EOEC|5.0|Was looking for music to use as background on a youtube video about a radio control car race. Needed to be a good uptempo beat and convey speed and action. This album was it and more. One problem (if you can call it that) is that there are so many great tracks, I had a hard time deciding which to use. Simply a great album of songs.<br /><br />How is it I just learned of this album. Where have I been?<br /><br />I would post the video here, but can't figure out how. Plus there appears to be a 10 minute max on vids here and mine is just over that. Here's the address anyway (if it works here): [...]<br /><br />Did I mention it's a great album?
B0033H7VI6|3.0|Purchased this knife for outdoor/bushcraft work.  Very heavy. Issue i have with it is the quality of workmanship.  I know it is a cheaper knife.  But since they became popular they must have rushed these into production.  Grind is uneven and handles fit poorly.  Sharp out of the box.  Still a good value for its use.
0670451495|5.0|This is an excellent book with beautiful artwork. The story is charming and it even subtly provides lessons about duck behavior! My daughters are young (2 and 4) and we love reading this story together. I'm sure that will be true for years to come.
B004SKQAJI|5.0|I have two ancient VHS tapes of the original \\"Riverdance\\" (1995, starring Michael Flatley) and the original \\"Lord of the Dance\\" (1996). They've been played so many times that I needed to replace them with DVD's. To my surprise, I can't find a DVD of \\"Riverdance\\" and the original \\"Lord of the Dance\\" is out of print, so only used copies are reasonably priced.<br /><br />So I decided to give \\"Michael Flatley Returns as Lord of the Dance\\" a try. Filmed live in Dublin in 2011, this is Michael Flatly's first return to the stage as lead dancer in over a decade. I was sceptical. In 2011, Flatley was 53 years old! I know tap dancers who are amazing athletes in their 60's, but \\"Lord of the Dance\\" is very highpowered - would Flatley fall flat?<br /><br />I am so pleased to say that he is still one incredible and amazing dancer. If you have the original from 1996 nearly memorized, you will realize that his arm movements are not as quick as they used to be. But his feet - his feet are still gold (even if his high-octane dance sets are a little shorter).<br /><br />This show is 95 minutes of wonderful dancing (plus two more dances in the bonus extras). Some of the dances are new, some are favorites, generally updated. There are 16 scenes in the main movie, two being instrumental (those wonderful fiddles!). I did not realize that Flatley is a world-rated flautist who's won national competitions. He plays the flute in one of the instrumental numbers.<br /><br />As expected, the \\"Lord of the Dance\\" number remains awesome. It and the final \\"Planet Island\\" dance have the set where the dancers are all in a line and do a sort of \\"wave\\", back and forth. If the first time you saw that wave your heart didn't just leap for the joy of it, you can't be human!  It is from the original \\"Riverdance\\" choreography and it just never gets old.<br /><br />There are also two wonderful Bonus Features:<br />1.  \\"Behind the Scenes Feature\\" (20 minutes) This isn't just filler, I thought it was GREAT! Commentators include Michael Flatley, Tom Cunningham (plays Don Dorcha, the lead \\"bad guy\\"), Bernadette Flynn (plays Saoirse, the White Lady of the Dance), Marie Duffy Pask (dance master), Ronan Hardman (composer), Ciara Sexton (plays Morrighan, the Bold Girl, that I used to call the Bad Girl, but I like Bold Girl better - no double-standard), Marcus Viner (film director), Mark Cunniffe (lighting and production designer).<br />Flynn had been with \\"Lord of the Dance\\" for 15 years, since the beginning. She's given star billing on the original DVD. Cunningham has been with the show 14 years. Pask and Hardman were with Flatley at the very beginning.<br />The absolute thrill of hearing all those taps sounding off in unison at supersonic speeds never grows old for me. In an interesting comment, Flatley says that experience, in the type of show they do, is crucial. The dancers \\"are breathing and moving at lightening speed out there. Because hey have such remarkable experience.... When I\\"m onstage at the end of the encore, and you're got up to 50 dances on stage, and they're all dancing as fast as they possibly can. All hitting the floor several times a second at exactly the same time. That's not something that can be achieved overnight.... It takes years of practice.\\"<br /><br />2. Deleted Scenes (16 minutes total):<br />A. \\"Marble Halls\\".  A singer sings \\"Marble Halls\\" (a song, originally from an opera, made famous by Enya). She has a beautiful voice, but I'm glad, for DVD \\"movie\\" purposes, that she is not part of the show.<br />B. \\"Siamsa\\". This is a full dance number that must have been cut just for time purposes, because it is a lovely dance. It is lighter with bright colors, spring and folk dancing.<br />C. \\"Carrick Fergus\\". The singer sings this Irish folk song.<br />D. \\"Deleted Encore\\". This is short, not a dance number. This show was filmed live in Dublin, and this is just the first presenting and bowing of lead dancers, musicians, \\"Spirit\\" and the singer at the end ofthe show. Then the non-dancers exit the stage and the actual encores begin (which remain in the film).<br /><br />The DVD/Bluray is in 5.1 Dolby Digital/2.0 LPCM and aspect ratio 2.40:1.  Subtitles in English, Portuguese, French, Italian, Spanish, Dutch, Danish, Finnish, Norwegian, Swedish and German.<br /><br />A WONDERFUL SHOW!<br /><br />Happy Reader(which remain in the film).    The DVD/Bluray is in 5.1 Dolby Digital/2.0 LPCM and aspect ratio 2.40:1.  Subtitles in English, Portuguese, French, Italian, Spanish, Dutch, Danish, Finnish, Norwegian, Swedish and German.    A WONDERFUL SHOW!    Happy Reader

0812984412|4.0|I enjoyed the movie the movie and I would like to read the book.  I just have to find the time to do so
B000FCKGPC|4.0|It was good but first three books were much better...really felt there was too much jumping around and my favorite characters points of view were held off until book 5

B00AP9RQE4|5.0|Captain Ivan Vorpatril's not sure he wants to open the door.  In his split second of hesitation, the informer for Imperial Security slips into his apartment, dragging another new scheme with him. &#34;I'd like you to pick up a girl.&#34;  It's delicate work in a nexus city lousy with smugglers.  Mistakes are embarrassing, especially if they involve accusations of principals with powerful relatives.  The girl in question may be in mortal danger, Byerly blithely tells his friend, but By doesn't have time to deal with such &#34;side issues&#34;.  The lady is question, sherry-eyed Tej, knows she's being stalked. Seconds later, a stun beam knocks Ivan flat. The groggy Aide-de-Camp finds himself face to face with the strangely beautiful blue Jewel, Rish, Tej's brave defender. Dragged bodily upstairs to their apartment, Ivan is bound to a chair as his captors contemplate what to do with their uninvited guest.  This latest adventure from Louis McMaster Bujold explodes in a marvelous entanglement of alliances, family loyalties, passions and greed. Sarcasm, subtle humor, and riotous comedy pepper the novel. Lively scenes propelled me through amazing escapades in a universe rife with political intrigue.  A most ingenious and moving read! Kate Calina
B0089LOG02|5.0|Could not put it down. I had no idea that the Orphan Train existed. An incredible piece of our history.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Good game.  Had a few technical issues with no support, but otherwise it's fun.  Most of the time it logs on with no problems.
B008NEVPCC|5.0|I enjoyed Cher Lloyd's debut album. I loved her songs \\"Want U Back\\", \\"With Ur Love\\", & \\"Oath\\", which have become singles for her. \\"Beautiful People\\" was also a great tune. I look forward to whatever she releases next. Keep it up, Cher!
B004LROUNG|3.0|Kind of slow, not a lot of action in this book. Halfway through, and not a lot has happened, yet.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|The story was well written. It was easy for me to just want to read and loose myself in it.  The issues and reactions described and overcome were realistic and understandable.
B00DH4BL8Q|5.0|I had to read &#34;Percy Jackson and the Lightning Theif&#34; for school, and it was amaaayyzing!! So I decided to read the whoe series. &#60;3 Annabeth

B00DRPVE3M|3.0|...that I've spent about a fortune just to buy tokens to play. This game is super fun and extremely competitive! The ticket scratch offs for the tokens helped, but not enough. All in all, this game is addicting.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|This is a Tom Cruise action movie that you need to go into with no expectations.  I had heard nothing about the movie prior to watching it, and was pleasantly surprised by it.  It is a typical Tom Cruise action move.  If that's what you're into then I recommend it.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Very easy!  East to update, add to quick and check off. Love it.  I use it every day for lists and quick notes.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Pros: It's cheap. That's the only reason it gets 2 instead of 1 star.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. It sucks.<br />2. If you stream youtube from your smartphone (I have the Nexus 4, which is currently the best Google-designed android available), the chromecast glitches out if you try to change what you're watching, or even stop what you're watching. Even after closing youtube, it continues to play on the TV.<br />3. When you stream from your computer (I have a very powerful laptop with a 3rd generation ivy-bridge Core i7 processor), the video and sound are often not in sync, and the video gets choppy, despite the router, laptop, and chromecast being in the same room.<br />4. The chromecast software on google chrome constantly glitches and either fails to stream, or streams but doesn't stop streaming when you tell it to.<br />5. It does not stream in 1080p. Maximum is 720p.<br />6. It ONLY streams from chrome, so if you have videos or music on your computer, it won't stream that.<br />7. It won't stream Pandora from your phone.<br />8. It WILL NOT stream music or video from your phone's memory!!!! It will ONLY stream music you have on the google play cloud. So if you put MP3s on your phone, it won't let you play them. You must first upload all your music to the google play cloud, then stream it to listen to it, which means using up your bandwidth and data.<br />So it doesn't stream pandora from your phone or play music directly off your phone, which severely limits its usefulness if you just want to put on some music while wandering around the house.<br />9. There is a 1-2 second delay between your computer actions and video compared to the stream on the TV. So when you tell it to stream to the tv, you have to turn off your laptop screen to avoid being distracted by two different videos, and your mouse movements and scrolling have a long delay before the TV shows what you did.<br /><br />OVERALL conclusion,<br />I REALLY badly wanted to like this device, but it is very clear that Google rushed it and released an unfinished, unrefined product. Very disappointing.<br />I am going to return it.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Awesome reading!! Very well written and really capture s your imagination and transports to this very land. Can't wait to read it again.
B00CO6QGCE|5.0|I love this app and I can't believe it's free! Even if I had to pay for it I would. I'd definitely get it.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great. Works fine simple. I give it 5 stars also very big for the elderly. Great job creators.  Get it now
B00BQI4AU6|4.0|I've always liked Tom's vocals, so when I saw him on TV, I got the CD.<br />The songs are well written, and quality of the production is good.<br />Very happy with my purchase.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Get my kindle books too and use for husbands kindle and my iPad, great way to take on trips.  Load up and on ships read anywhere.
B008SAZHLQ|4.0|I was drawn into this novel early, and it held my interest throughout. Sensitively drawn adolescent characters who are (usually) believable. I think this would be interesting reading for teens, but it holds up as a good adult read.
B00AQA0OJG|5.0|This figure was about actually a little bigger than expected. It is my first one and planning to collect more and the quality was great. My expectations were high when ordering it and they were met.
B002Q7JYPC|5.0|This is a 2 CD collection of fantastic songs by the Eagles.  Every song sounds great as you would expect. I have been an Eagles fan since I bought Hotel California on an 8 track tape back in the 70's. It is well worth the price.
B006LSZECO|4.0|As I got into this book, in the beginning I was rather disappointed.  But then the plot twisted and from then on I was hooked.  It has stayed with me after reading it and a month later, I still think about it.  Not great literature but a good read.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This was a good read, the story moved right along but in retrospect, it was not believable.  I found myself frustrated by the characters' behavior (specifically Mom and Dad) and Jacob was not believable.  For a depressing light read, I'd recommend this and it did remind me of my husband's love our son.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|It is mental floss for the person who wants something mindless, entertaining and juicy at times... I have a very mentally exhausting job, so this is perfect ...
034580404X|3.0|I was pleased with the purchase, but the contents of the actual read were not impressive to me at all.  These writings are for inexperienced, emotionally codependent people or housewives that are only used to &#34;vanilla sex' who would think these experiences are out of this world.
B004NBY242|1.0|Not very happy with the dvd it was from Germany and I wasn't aware that Itwould not play any US dvd player it was out of region what a waste of money.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|I became addicted to this game about 6 months ago. I eventually started purchasing additional coins and token packages so I didn't have to wait for the daily free amount. The last three purchases I made were deducted from my bank account approximately $28 worth and the product has not been added to my bingo account. 4 emails to customer service have gone unanswered. Also the rooms will freeze often and you will only be reimbursed credits about half the time. And never reimbursed power ups which also cost. It's great if you stick to just the free part, otherwise you will get ripped off.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game is the best Bingo game I have played.  Love the new games that are created. I play almost everyday and make sure my friends get their free gifts daily.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this game. Sometimes freezes but still worth playing .I love the challenge of trying to finish rooms.it makes for a relaxing night when the stress if the day is done
B005K17RU0|1.0|Change back to the old one or offer us a choice.. make it easier to navigate and more local forecast
B007ONSLLQ|5.0|It's refreshing to hear a talented woman belting it out for a hard rock band. Fantastic tunes on this album! Halestorm is one of my new favorites. Amazing band and vocals. Check them out!
B00640UICA|5.0|If you like logic puzzles, get this while it's still the FAOTD!<br /><br />I've played several games at the first four or so levels and am enjoying it. I don't know whether I will find it interesting enough to continue playing for a long time, but for what it is, it's very nicely done. The graphics are very cute and the controls are intuitive.
B003TOMAPC|5.0|It's pretty gory, but that's what's great about it.  Good story, good actors.  Hilarious.  I really like it and I would watch it again.
B003FNWR6Y|4.0|Like Monopoly, only nitendo-ish!  The figures included are too small for our hands, but we substituted other, so OK. word
B00CWVF2GC|5.0|Yossi was heart warming to watch. Great acting. Actor Oz playing Tom is so cute! Ohad Knoller  was so convincing.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Really good show.  I look forward to seeing where they go next year, as they've killed off some major characters.
B000FC11A6|2.0|Clever analogies and technical stuff.  Too many words, too many sub-plots, chronological settings had too follow. Some readers may be offended by gratuitous violence, sex.
B000MRA5NS|5.0|What can I say. I love his blue eyes. He is hot in this movie and it is definitely one of my favorite Bond movies
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|Many times when I try to play I am directed to log in to the Amazon App store then I get an \\"internal error\\" message and I have to exit..<br />FIX THE SCREW UP AND ASK ME THEN.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This was a good idea, a minecraft pocket edition game, it's just amazing so much fun. My little brother can't stop playing the game.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great thinking game love the graphics great game ..waiting for more..please hurry waiting. And waiting and waiting and waiting so where is the next one
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Gripping and engaging. Great fast read. Surprisingly emotional and twisted simultaneously.<br /><br />Highly recommend it especially for a great summer read.
B00640UICA|5.0|This is a unique puzzle game, perfect for younger audiences not only is it fun but it helps teach logic/problem solving.<br /><br />You have a certain number of slots around the screen (some are occupied by various objects) and you have a certain amount of \\"Peablins\\" per level that have anywhere from 1 up to 5 hands (that's the most i've seen), you need to drag each Peablin to an empty slot so that all hands from each Peablin are being held. Then you advance to the next level, as you continue along it gets harder by having more than 1 type of Peablin which you can do different things with.<br /><br />One of the best features I can see in this game is in the Extras menu, you can setup different profiles so that multiple people can play on the same phone/tablet and be able to save their progress separately. Unlike many other games, this one doesn't require you to log in to any social media accounts or use in app purchases, all in all a nice clean fun game.
B00BRUQ7ZY|2.0|He failed to take into account, or dismissed, Robinson's argument for The Priority of John which I do find convincing. Robinson wrote of a &#34; the Procedural Priority&#34; whereby one could date John both early and late, being the recollections of the hero of the Johannine community; a long life from youth to mature old age - a lifetime of memories and critique of variant other traditions. In his Eucharist Words of Jesus, Joachim Jeramias (?) also speaks compellingly of the Ipsissima  Verba and the ipsissima Vox of Jesus. I cannot believe the speaker [i;e Jesus] was a zealot: and (2) an unlettered peasant whose native tongue was a Galillean dialect of western Aramaic. The Septuagint was widely used at the time of Jesus and he was almost certainly familiar with it. A synagogai was probably present in his home town; after all, wouldn't it simply be what the name implies, a gathering of faithful Jewish men gathered round a rabbi, i.e 'in the Gate, to 'zealously' pour over the Scriptures together to critique and ask difficult questions, just like the dreamer Jacob did, and was commended for doing so; the eponymous founder of Israel - straight from the Voice itself. To be an Israelite is to be a wrestler.<br /><br />Both these writers resolve the 'so called' Synoptic problem and the dating of Holy Week. Jesus passionately desired to celebrate the Passover with his disciples but was prevented from doing so by the events of the &#34;Friday we call Good&#34;; the Day of &#34;Preparation for the Passover&#34;.<br /><br />Apart from the above, Aslan does give us an excellent review if the historical background to the War and destruction of Jerusalem and the Temple and its aftermath, though he fails to say what happened to the remnant of the rabbinic leadership afterwards. The center of rabbinic leadership and authority, such as it was in the ensuing chaos, was 'exiled' I believe to Jamnia.

B00002SSKI|5.0|Love this movie! Hard to find anywhere else, especially for such a great price! Came in excellent condition too! It's one I'll save and show my kids some day!
B008602KQI|4.0|Decent little flick. Read the book, liked it well enough, so decided to give movie a try. Book isn't too complex, so the film does a good job representing it. Its pretty well acted, too; and special effects are a bit fun in that weird &#34;Fifth-Element version of the future&#34; type way, coupled with (non-zombie) post-apocalyptic disparity that are both well portrayed. Its got a little bit of violence, so if you're unfamiliar with the story, consider yourself warned.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|like the app it is very puzzling &amp; hard every witch way in this awesome bird slinging pig popping app.
B000FCKC4M|5.0|Another Paolo Coehlo masterpiece!  I am still reading it, but I LOVE it! Another book that is thought provoking and inspiring on how we should live our lives...

B004J4WKTW|5.0|I am terrible at writing book reviews but I LOVED this story.  It was so unique but I felt pulled-into every bit of it.
1596912863|5.0|I originally got this from my local library and read it.  the book started slow but picked up and I loved it. (I also loved a similar book titled a midnight in austenland by the same author) I decided to buy it because the movie version will be out soon and I noticed in the trailers that theres some book to movie discrepancies.  I always like to reread books before I watch the movie so I can see the difference and compare how the producers interpreted and represented the story line
B00DDZM0GQ|5.0|Got this for free as the Amazon Free App of the Day, and it was worth every penny! A super addicting mix of Tetris and Lumines where you have to make solid lines left to right to eliminate rows. You get bonuses for matching a row of the same color, which to progress to later levels is very important. It is very satisfying when you nail a 9x combo because you keep one of the bonuses that breaks the big blocks up and score the line just as the whole grid is almost full.<br /><br />A very pleasant surprise for a free game and would gladly purchase it next time with real money. Very fun, well made game.

034580709X|2.0|I saw the film Headhunters, which I loved. I then discovered it was written by Jo Nesbo.  My brother had 5 of his books, so passing through the airport I picked up the first in the series.<br />Grisham and Connely take us more into the detective and legal process, where I feel as though I am learning something.<br />I just did not get anything from the book.<br />I found myself speed reading and skipping paragraphs which were irrelevant.<br />Tried it. Done it.  Not my cup of tea.
B00CPTUN5G|5.0|I Wanted To See This Movie When It Came Out But It Was To Far I Love My Little Pony So This Will Be Great For People Who Also Like It!
B001NLKXK2|5.0|I read this book in a few days because I was hooked from page one.  The writing is so good that you feel like you're watching a series and you can't wait for the next episode.  But it's even better because you don't have to wait - you just turn to the next chapter.  Not only does the story capture your full attention, but the educational aspect of the book is informative but not textbook at all - it really puts the reader in the shoes of Alice, who has Alzheimer's Disease.  Everyone would benefit from reading this book and understanding this poorly understood disorder.
B000PHN4HE|5.0|I Remember Seeing This When I Was Younger It Was Great Then And Still Great Now Great For A Family Night!
B003ELY7PG|4.0|In an age where startups and entrepreneurs are all the rage, Jason Fried makes a case for avoiding (in most cases) scaling up, taking outside investors and planning for the exit, and instead staying small. He also has good advice on how to conceive products (reducing functionality instead of adding it). Having worked in two different startups, I find many of his ideas compelling. He also applied his minimalistic approach to the book itself, which is short, increasing the chances of it actually being read. Inspiring!
B000XCHQFC|5.0|This Movie Is Funny And Sad I Love It Tho I Remember Watching It As A Kid It Was Awesome!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|A really useful app! Simply a great clock with the best features you want. A bargain a$0.99, but fully packed with the right stuff! It really surprised me as all I was expecting was a clock with an alarm. But the weather feature and the fact that you can choose different alarms and skin is simply great!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Versatile and user friendly. This app does more stuff than I ever expected. Every time I use EverNote I discover something new.
B00002N9ER|3.0|Great bracket, easy to install, perfect for the D-Cell flashlight because it is made especially for it.  The only problem; they break!  I have several flashlights installed around the house for emergencies and ease of use, and I have to replace a bracket at least every 6 months.  It is the natural flexing that caused a break in the same place every time.
B007AL48UK|3.0|Kind of time pass..Not a must have kind of game... sometimes its useful, when you have nothing else to do
B00AGJ4HC2|5.0|It's truly puzzling how such depth could be created with only 16 cards. Truly a great game, enjoyed by players of all types.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|if i gave it all the stars that said it all i should not have to say any more thanks
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Bought this in 3D and it's one of the most requested movies to watch at my house. Great in 2D as well.
B00499NHLC|5.0|I enjoyed watching Sherlock, I had not realized that I could watch the episodes for free on amazon. So happy i am a subscriber of Prime!
B00CHI5B7A|5.0|one of the best movies i've seen in a long time. great cast and great storyline. graphics are great, just a solid all around movie, especially if you have a nice tv to watch it on.
B00A25NLOU|4.0|This was a joy to read from the beginning to the end, complete page turner (made me miss my stop twice).<br />A guy enters a strange bookshop, discovers an old following of the book encrypted for centuries... we all know how it will progress and how it will end, right? He'll discover magic/old wisdom/power/shocking truth about some world religion/etc, right? Right.<br /><br />Not so here.<br /><br />The author managed to turn, distort and change all tropes in the \\"artifact mystery\\", incorporate true 21th century in the novel, make his people believable and intelligent, and actually write about the true sense of life and what is immortality. Lightly, yes, but it suited the book.<br />Loved the incorporation of technology and the parallel Google - Broken Spine.<br />Loved the ending.<br />Life is changing, going on, everybody is growing and have learned something. What's not to love?<br /><br />...And also, the book got me looking into climbing. All benefit!<br />Read it, and at the very least you will never look at the museums in the same way.<br />At the very most, you'll know what your ideal future society is like, which is the first step towards making it real. That what this book is about after all: making the potential real.<br /><br />*Warning: Spoiler*<br />The only critic I have is that the puzzle solution doesn't work. The substitution cipher is STILL just a substitution cipher, no matter how the substitution is obtained, the Google should have cracked it. But I was willing to let it slide and just pretend it worked, because the idea of the key was so neat.
B00CCX9DUG|5.0|I've read several of the reviews that complain about Elizabeth coming off as a complainer. Her father is dead, her Uncle has just been slaughtered on the battle field and she's forced to marry Henry Tudor who was the victor of the battle.  I simply cannot imagine what she'd have to complain about or to be depressed about ?!?! Personally I was captured by this book and could not put it down. New light was shed on Henry VII for me, it had not occurred to me that most of his reign had been spent worrying about his thrown being taken from him. The rape is perhaps speculation but frankly it's just as likely a possibility as any other in that era. Having a heir would have been a MAJOR concern for any king, just look at what happened during Henry VIII's reign because of the elusive heir.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I have a hard time waking up, because I have  MS. This app will keep going until you touch done. The snooze times are right on. I love it so far.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Awesome ! Super easy to play and super hard to put down. Love the dirt throwing action from the tires, wheelies and jumps are cool too. I became addicted on the first run. It's easy to advance to higher levels and upgrade your truck which makes you want to keep on playing.
B00AH8FTT2|4.0|This is the third in the series and, having read the two previous books I was anxious to read this.  The pace, as in all Archer's books is fast and engaging and, like the other two books in the Clifton chronicles it ends with a very sharp cliff hanger which keeps you waiting impatiently for the next instalment.  The main characters are attractive and likeable and the villains are very unpleasant.<br />I enjoyed it.
B002RI90WM|5.0|From start to finish this book entertains. It made me cry, laugh and value my own wonderful dog even more. I fully recommend it to all dog owners.
B008476HBM|5.0|This is probably my favourite novel and I am not alone in my opinion as it consistently rates in the top rank of Most Popular Novels. I have read it so many times that I can quote quite long passages and I can return to it like an old friend.<br />The plot is quite simple, with no &#34;Gothic&#34; drama of the type found in &#34;Jane Eyre&#34; for example, but the characters make the book.  Each character is beautifully drawn, both in physical appearance and in their specific characteristics, one can close one's eyes and see them and hear their voices.  Jane Austen was an acute observer of people and her witty descriptions keep the reader smiling. This book was a natural for my first Kindle selection.
1575666286|5.0|Knowledge is power! Becoming aware of the tools necessary to fight and ward off disease is powerful and inspiring. Realizing those tools are available and accessible to the average consumer, implies that I can act upon what I have learned. This book is rooted in the principles of flooding the body with high concentrations of nutrients , while at the same time flushing the body of toxins.
B00CJGP116|5.0|waited for it while on reserve but it's a great CD<br />waiting for the product to actually come out & you put it on reserve  makes you anxious,<br />service is very good.
B00942S4OY|1.0|This product doesnt even deserve one star! This is just a bunch of boys singing about worthless crap! Im sure they will die down within the next year and half or so...
B008XKSW7M|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie, at first I wasn't to sure about it because I honestly don't like the pregnancy book. This movie was absolutely hilarious!!
B003F3NDWG|5.0|The blend of mystery and humor is wonderful.  Nathan Fillion does a great job with the title character.  Well known writers are blended into the story seamlessly.  I find myself wanting to follow the antics of the various characters yet it does not feel like a soap opera.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|A great way to pass the time without dropping real coins!  There is some strategy involved in trying to drop your coins in the right place.  Enough to keep it interesting.
0785153942|5.0|I love Pacific Rim, and this is a wonderful way to get at backstory information.  It really gives us a lot more, and I'm hoping we'll get more releases like this in the future.
B00AR83PN4|5.0|Cubimania is an easy to use just hard to master. My wife blows me out of the water its the only thing i dont like about it. One of the only games she beats me hands down. Try it and let someone try to beat your score easy to play.
B005PM3YII|5.0|Very good. Love all the Mistborn series! Brandon Sanderson is a very gifted writer. He has mentioned continuing the series in more futuristic settings and I very much look forward to that!
B006ZNRD06|5.0|Works grate on my andorid phones and tablets. I havent had and issue with it not being able to play a video format yet. They keep up with updates and what not as well. Must have on phones.
B004W1GCNC|5.0|This season of Upstairs/Downstairs takes you by a rather pleasant surprise. The plot thickens as the brink of war approaches and things are shaken not stirred at 165 Eaton Place. I recommend this series to anyone who enjoys classic tales of love, war, and the classes.
B000HZCZYW|4.0|Although over looked as an obscure Star Trek movie, this light hearted and fun side of Star Trek is still a great watch!
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|The artist is among my favourite of all time - Perfect CD.  I have recommended it to other Andreas fans.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love pinterest and what can I say I am addicted lol. pinterest has been super useful to me. I only wish I could actually have my pinterest closet
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|Because it is everything I expected from this artist, I have only just &#34;discovered&#34; his ability and have never been let down.
B001UG56ES|4.0|You need to watch this movie if you like great panoramic video of Australia. It is beautifully shot and the acting is great.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This is a fun game nice for phone play and tablet play. If you like Iron man your going to love this game with all the different armor`s you get to use.
B003HARV3Y|4.0|I thought they did a pretty good job of bringing the book series to life. I bought this one and then went to see the second at the theater.
B009S33I68|5.0|It takes great courage to relive and write about these heros and Hal Moore did it so well.  We owe them all a great debt.
B00DS2GBJG|3.0|I have always been a fan of James Labrie's side work.. So I went into this with great expectations. Melodically, it landed right where I expected it to.  Great instrumentation, solid grooves... James voice is in fine form... I'm not sure whose brilliant idea it was to add screaming, possessed vocals over, what could be, enjoyable tracks. I ALMOST stopped the playback after the first few tracks, Agony, Undertow and Slight of Hand... I was SOOOO disappointed... I'm glad I didn't. After the initial turnoff off of \\"screaming\\" vocals to counter James pristine vocal, it got a bit better... I repeat, BIT... . I guess every yin needs a yang. This would be a better listen if those screaming, guttural vocal went away. Do yourself a favor... skip the first three tracks and give the rest of the album a fair shake... Overall, Pretty solid effort.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Scraping away the media hoopla, this book tells the story of one dramatic day in history and the courage and coordinated effort of many men and women to make it happen.  I greatly appreciated their courage and am totally disgusted with the way others in the political arena took the credit and left them  &#34;hang out to dry&#34;.
B004HZ76FQ|4.0|It's fun to play...I guess as close to fishing as you can get in a get in a game.  Sometimes it seems kind of random.
0765315246|5.0|After Old Man's War was recommended to me by several different sources, I started reading reviews. Publisher's Weekly, right on the cover of the book, says \\"...tradition of Robert A. Heinlein...reads like an original work by the late grand master.\\" Amazon has a 4.4 rating. It was a Hugo Award Finalist. And so forth and so on. I was almost afraid to read the actual book the expectations were set so high!<br /><br />So with high hopes and an open mind, one afternoon I started reading. And kept reading. And was grumpy when I had to stop reading to cook dinner. And stayed up way too late reading. And woke up and finished it before doing the errands I needed to be doing. I finished the last page, set the book down, and thought \\"Wow.\\" It lived up to the hype.<br /><br />Upon reflection, it didn't truly live up to the hype as much as it did an end run around the hype. Does it actually read like an original Heinlein? Well, no. Nothing reads like an original Heinlein except Heinlein. What it did was immediately engage both my mind and my emotions. And it didn't let go, even when the book had ended. Hence, \\"Wow.\\" Hence, lack of sleep. Hence, hunt for the next book ASAP.<br /><br />Which is my definition of a 5 star book in a nutshell.<br /><br />If you have been hesitant as I was, don't be any longer. Go forth and read! You won't regret it.
B0002KQNJU|4.0|Ive heard of this film through reading Polanski's biography so Id thought I would watch it and see what it's all about. It's like a parody of sorts where it tries to blend in and poke fun of vampire movies in the sense that it is funny, but it isn't. Sharon Tate was the only reason I watched the film to the end because of her stunning beauty in the film.It's one of those movies where you either love it or hate it. I would say only watch this film if your into Polanski's film's, otherwise I would say skip it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Continues to be an excellent show with a very good representation of England during this time period and great actors.
B0062P3392|5.0|I think this is the best movie that Jason Statham has made. All of the stars were great and it was an engrossing story. I've watched it 3 times. My son  and his wife also loved it.
B005N95JA4|1.0|It would be nice to rate this. But I've been waiting so long for this. I forgot I ordered this cd.  It's been about a month  It's a shame. Hope it's the package in the post office which sucks that I have to go and pick it up
B0019EXZY4|5.0|Once again, I really enjoy watching Jason Statham in almost anything. The nudity at the beginning was a little off putting but I really did enjoy the story line.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Amateurish....very poorly written with lots of fluff to make the book appear more voluminous. I felt the second book was like this too but book three was by far the worst of the trilogy. I feel cheated and a bit foolish for falling for this piece of ....
B008XKSW7M|3.0|HAS SOME GOOD SPOTS IN THE MOVIE BUT SOME TIMES IT WAS A LITTLE SLOWBUT BETTER THAN SOME THAT I HAVE SEEN
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|Very entertaining fun for the whole family even my seven yr old can play it<br />I like this one the best because they actually make sense.
B00BR0SGN0|4.0|five star to me means you can't stop playing it -I can put it away but go back to it frequently so I consider four star  pretty damn good for 'deep purple' and there new album  -now what -there are a couple songs that I can't say I get into like most of the others but that's just me-so I do recommend it for those of us who appreciate masters at work -they tell us stories and fill our head with waves of music they create- pretty awesome album
B00000K3UU|5.0|Back when Sandler was funny and brought his A game.  But, times change as does Sandler.  To quote Chris Rock, Adam Sandler needs a hit like a Crack Addict needs a hit.
B0012NO4WO|4.0|I enjoyed this movie very much. I am so glad I bought it. I saw both Speed movies on tv, and enjoyed them then. I still enjoy them now.
B00AO2P3GA|1.0|Before I rant I just wont to say the game is great,and I blame amazon more than the developer,Amazon has total disregard for there customers of first gen kindle,its only a year and a half old and there already stop upgrading software,now all these new games like this one don't even work online,the only options is to take a risk and root your device or spend some money or kindle fire hd,so your telling me each year and a half I have to keep buying new kindles for newer software when my old kindle fire is perfectly fine,and another thing you have the option to turn in a kindlefire and only get about 20$!!,I bought my kindle fire for 199$ in December 2011 plus a 3 year warrenty which endded up being 260$ at bestbuy,so your telling me I get 20$ back..,I would give it away before giving anything to amazon
0345529057|5.0|love the show and love the books even more.... very vivid and imaginative writing. the show leaves out a lot (as you could imagine) that the book details in full.. story lines etcv..etc
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love it, Not only do I have a adding machine I've got an advanced calculator Just swip the top keys and you can do advanced math..
B00821OX98|4.0|i think the show is well written at times. a lot of what goes on is believable to a fault. in-fighting to personal struggles.. heart felt action and emotion...
B005F2BBLK|3.0|Cute enough but a little slow moving, did not keep kids interested enough. I love to watch movie again but would not watch this a second time around.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its good but I never get the daily awards I think it could have better games so its pretty good
B002XBVQKW|5.0|Great for even kids. Watched with 6 year old and she loved it. Was not scary because it was so humorous.
B00EI6E17A|5.0|The song is great, but is even better when you see the music video for it! Good job Gaga! Can't wait for ARTPOP to be released!
B005HSG3TC|4.0|The case was exactly as described.  It serves its purpose and is functional.  For the price, it is a good value.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|This was a great start to the new series. Percy Jackson and the Olympians was the Percy Jackson show but with this new series it feels kinda like going from Iron Man to the Avengers. You know, like the demigod allstars. I love the world Mr. Riordan has created and will read all of the godly books he pumps out
B00ECUX7HC|5.0|I have listened to this CD over and over since I got it a couple days ago...each song is so very different from the one before. I have both their other CDs which are amazing in their own right but this one is the cherry on top. Susans' voice is amazing as always...Dereks guitar work is unlike anyone else...the horn section..the keyboards, drums...all are just perfectly in harmony. Buy this CD and give it a listen...you will be so very happy you did!!!
B008RYN44U|3.0|This isn't quite the No Doubt of the '90s (obviously). However, the song &#34;Settle Down&#34; is totally worth buying this whole cd. If you're way more into the ska that they put out back in the day, this probably isn't the cd for you.
B00004R99L|4.0|Original Disney. My younger day care kids wouldn't sit for this, but my older day care kids were into it. I was never a big fan of this movie, but this generation deals well with the fantasy of this story and it's characters.
6302642248|5.0|This is such a cute movie, despite some slightly disturbing imagery. It's not exactly disturbing, but it's funny to see in this day and age, since the movie was made so long ago. I bought this for my 2-year-old brother, and he absolutely loves it!! Definitely a good investment.
B00B3MN65K|4.0|Yes, MAJOR brownie points with her. She is awesome and Josh, though not as good as she is... well, he's ok. But the benefits are better still!
0788832182|3.0|Language was a bit inappropriate for out 9 yr old son-I was not aware it was PG rated but okay overall.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have an ipod touch which I have this app on as well. I love my Bible, but.it can be hard to read in the dark. that's why I'm downloading it on my kindle. I'm very blessed. :)
B006F8HZYK|5.0|The rule for a review requires twenty words. One of the rules in the book is to guard against wordiness.
B005544TRQ|5.0|If you have a Prime account, i highly recommend checking the first two season s available at no additional cost. Now that I'm hooked, I have been purchasing new episodes as they are released.
B004SBQGHS|4.0|Angry birds ad free I love  it! There's no crashing! :) great fun for the kids, my husband and I!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love this series as it carries on the tradition of Masterpiece Theater.  It is quality entertainment for all families.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|As in the vast majority of the author's works, this book is great.  The manner in which he spins his tale using ordinary words to create a visible almost touchable world just for the reader is remarkable.
B00AKOB7CG|4.0|This is a great way to work out if you don't have a lot of time,  this would be a great way to start to get back into shape
B00A285OOW|5.0|The book is excellent.  I am only half way through, but the details and story line are right up to par.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Will recommend for younger children because of the realistic actions. When I babysit this is the game they love especially the girls.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Truly excellent can't wait for the next in the series! Rick Riordan never disappoints with real life characters in unreal settings!
B008MM9630|4.0|So far it is interesting.  Again as with all these types of games the energy is an issue.  but love the graphics.  We shall see how it plays out.
B004NSVEYQ|4.0|Pictures are nice the recipes are good and easy to understand. I think if you get the first book its just as good- I bought both. One was good enough.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Plain and simple this book is freaking awesome!  The author's attention to detail paints vivid and horrifying accounts to each individual story as if it actually took place.  The movie does not come close to being as bad ass as this book!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Truly enjoyed this book. It is a quick, easy read. Action, heartbreak, and love all rolled into one flawlessly put together  book.
B004EPYZQC|5.0|We now own all the Fast and the Furious movies and can't wait till 6 comes available for purchase on DVD.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|it is a very fun game. when you find the right piece everything falls into place. I highly recommend it.
B00555X8OA|5.0|New way to look at how our minds work. Kahneman's work applies to every field and to every day life as well. Well written and thought provoking. Makes one examine one's responses and behavior.
B00BYM5I1O|5.0|I don't know if there is a better song smith than Clark, least ways for my tastes - Is every song a &#34;home run&#34;? well for me, that is nearly impossible but there are 5 or 6 that I really like and a couple that tend to haunt me. That's Guy Clark for me and has been for about 30 years. Your experience is, well, yours. So, for the price of admission, I think it's worth it.
B003TOMAPC|5.0|This is the little movie that nobody mentioned that is a star.<br />I could not believe it.  Kick ass literally kicked ass.  I love this movie.<br />This hit girl is a real hit.
B007ZESPME|5.0|I didn't watch Smash went to was on TV, but I caught part of a re-run and Really enjoyed the music I heard. So that prompted the purchase of the cd. Love the music!!
B00AL1P9PY|5.0|This is, in my estimation, the greatest album of all time. Really. Since my Galaxy Note 2 won't play vinyl records, I bought this version. Fantastic. If you're not a Rush fan, spend the ten bucks and become one.<br /><br />Thank you Geddy, Alex and Neil. You guys have been a source of joy for me since 1976.
B004X75RK4|1.0|Why is it Hollywood thinks the public cannot handle a good plot if they don't throw nudity, sexual innuendo, cursing, etc. into it?  I was so angry after watching this movie because it was yet one more movie that had a simple plot, but a sweet one, that was ruined from almost the beginning.  I felt insulted almost all the way through.  Funny?  It would have been if they would have gone with quality instead of &#34;let's see...what will the public buy?&#34;  Don't waste your time on this one.
B0012QRPU4|4.0|I have only watched the first episode so far but definitely was sucked into watching more.  I am a straight laced by the book pharmacist (similar to the main character in this show) that came down with a chronic illness so the theme of this show both hit home and provides a much needed dose of laughter. Due to my profession, I love the chemical humor of the show and due to the unexpected onset of my disease,  the desperation of the main character to find a way to support his family despite his illness is sad but understandable.  I will continue to rent further episodes to watch during my chemo appts and hope to get caught up prior to the next season starting on HBO.  Dive in...watch this show...it will be a great change from the predictable and trashy reality shows that have taken over everyday TV.
B000SEIDR0|5.0|Should be required reading for everyone! This book exposes the dark underbelly of agri-business and it's impact on our health. And a revealing look at the lives of the farm animals as well.
B003MXIS8S|5.0|One of the best dark films ever made. One of those great films that every time you watch it, you pick up something you missed before.
B007AL48UK|4.0|As an older person I find the symbols a little confusing but it makes you improve your concentration and the beach symbols are a little easier.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I'm never ready for these character's to end.  This series of books is enticing, but not as intense and the Fifty Shades of Gray series.  I can't wait for the next novel - hurry up Sylvia Day.
B006M4F67A|4.0|As an older person I have to concentrate on the symbols as some look similar but this keeps the brain active.
B000V39KDO|5.0|Honor above politics.  Protect family by putting country above family.  Multitasking is a myth: In order to be truly great, you must specialize.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|I am addicted to this show. Can't wait for each episode. I will be crestfallen when the show ends. The suspense, close calls, and fine  acting can't be beat.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|It never fails to make me appreciate Christmas even more, and the people, who during my upbringing as a child, for teaching me the spirit of caring for those around me. It is, and always will be one of my favorite Christmas Carols!
B008J34466|5.0|I love this cd. Its a very good cd. I received it very quickly & the other ones I ordered to. Thank you
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game provides a sufficient challenge to one's memory and detail to obsevations.  It presents an added challenge to one that has a slight color blindness to solving some puzzles.  Only drawback is lack of a game save feature.  Needing to restart of level is slightly frustrating if you hit the wrong button or tablets times out, or needing to pause your level.  Enjoy it though.
B001F0VHEM|5.0|I LOVE PINK. I THE CD IS ON THE NOISY SIDE BUT ALSO THE LANGUAGE COULD BE CLEANED UP A LITTLE. BUT OVER ALL ITS AGREAT CD.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|I just started playing the game. So far it is ok. Though it isn't the most exciting game I've ever played. But it does hold my interest a little bit so far. I Wii see how goes the further I get into the game, things may chnge
B007V4QLY2|5.0|I love this cd so much. Its been a pleasure listening to it. Its exactly what I needed. Thank you.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|This movie has action, intrigue and comedy!!!!  Little bit of language, but good for a 15yrs and up crowd.  Can't wait to see Red 2!!!!
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|Love all the tracks.  This is the First CD I have bought of his.  He seems to be very talanted.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game definitely works the brain. I'm so addicted and have to get to the next level. Love this game.

0120884674|5.0|I actually had a friend (an archaeologist) recommend this book. I previously used the Bass Manual but have found White's book surpasses it as far as clarity and quality of pictures (actual photos in White's book while Bass' is illustrated). There are excellent descriptions as well.
B008XKSW7M|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie - it was funny, cute and all the actors did a great job acting out what it would be like to be expecting.
1476734941|5.0|I saw the program with Michael Mosley on PBS and was immediately interested. I have been on the diet with my husband for two weeks and have lost a few pounds. I have found that I no longer have sugar cravings and actually cannot drink soft drinks or eat sweets as they are just too sweet.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is just amazing. I love it!!! It's fun and the voice overs are near perfect. My cousins have fun just watching me play. :)
B001NHNG64|5.0|Jack Reachers is a pretty interesting character.  He gets around and into some very interesting situations and always manages to walk away.
B00821OX98|4.0|This is nothing like that fairy tale.  This is a scary tale, with sci-fi monsters, and robots.  I would not recommend  it for small children.  Now if you are true adult science fiction fan, this one will fit the bill for you.  It will keep you on the edge of your seat,{or whatever you are sitting on}, most of the viewing time!  My wife liked it, said it reminded her of her childhood.  It's not the weirdest  thing I ever saw, but It comes mighty close.  Enjoy!  Curt  AKA  Great Grandpa
B0020PJJHS|5.0|Pierce is great.  The story is decent but the cast shines.  Plus, this movie was the foundation for the greatest N64 title for a very long time!
3406653642|5.0|I was born in El Salvador, raised German by Germans and now I live in USA... I never knew how German I really am until I saw myself reflected in this book with so lovely sense of humor!<br />I have been reading one or two chapters a day only so it lasts longer :)<br />Well written, as only a real Ausländer can see us ;) WE NEED A 2nd volume!
B000OIZUW6|5.0|I RATE THIS BOOK WITH 5 -FIVE-STARS, IT IS EXCELLENT WRITTEN, YOU HAVE TO READ IT COMPLETELY AT ONCE, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO QUIT READING IT, WELL DOCUMENTED, ONE OF THE BEST KEN FOLLET BOOKS, RELATED TO THE SECOND WORLD WAR. I WOULD LIKE TO RECCOMMEND IT FOR ALL THE BABY BOOMERS READERS FANS OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR LITERATURE
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I really like this game, it reminds me of my favorite game series, resident evil, and is juts totally fun. Completely worth the money!! (^w^)
B000QE9ERK|5.0|Depp is fantastic as is the character of Boris Balkan. A book lovers thriller superbly done by Polanski. Watch it more than once to catch the details...
140006922X|5.0|A great historical rendering of Jesus and his time. The convictions of his followers and the political times of the time. A refreshing enlightenment that matches Taylor Calewell's &#34;Great Lion of God.&#34;
B00BG5CXGM|5.0|I am very clumsy with my phone, but i did not want to spend 80 bucks on an otterbox, also i wanted something somewhat thin so i wouldn't carry around a bulky case. found this and it was perfect, and it protects very well.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I really enjoyed the story line.  The main character was very unlikable through-out the entire book, but elicited a sympathetic response to her inability to love another person.  She had much to overcome, but I wanted her to get-a-hold-of herself, let go of her fears, and embrace the people in her life who loved her.
B001DUDKEY|3.0|The acting was good but this adaptation is not one of Austen's better ones.  I found the relation between Anne and Frederick not terribly believable... mostly on Frederick's part.  I love Jane Austen's books and movies.  This one just didn't do it for me.
B004X2M3N8|5.0|I loved this season.  Can't wait  to watch season 7 now.  Glad I have Amazon Prime because I had missed most of this season and 7.
B00746O3X8|5.0|I used it in Peru during several treks with hours of walking.<br />It is very comfortable and it's a pleasure to have no weight on the neck.<br />I was keeping anyway the &#34;strap&#34; from nikon (but long enough to not &#34;carry the camera&#34; with it) at the same time than I was double strapping my unique camera: it was a very good protection against thievery (with 3 distinct straps, it's impossible to quickly thief the camera, even with a cutter)<br />Just note that when trekking, it is very useful to keep your neck free, and to &#34;block&#34; the camera to not have it swinging, but keeping 1.5Kg on your chest during 4 or 6 hours do not allow you to breathe completely freely (especially at very high altitude when oxygen is rare)
B00A9ET4MC|5.0|This book took me places that, as an American white woman, I could never go.  Chimamanda takes you into the experiences of an African black woman in Nigeria and America.  Into the differences she sees - not to trivialize anyone's perspective - but rather for the richness from different perspectives.  She gives powerful images of the reality of being black in America and different places around the world.  Especially insightful after the Trayvon  Martin tragedy.  Her characters romances, of course, add flavor to Ifem's tale.  I found myself a bit bored in the sections dealing with her business dealing on return to Lagos.  But that too add to the complexity of life in doing what we have to do to get by.  I definitely recommend this book when you are ready to let yourself get absorbed into a different person's story of life.
B007EECSFA|4.0|I have read all of Kate Morton's books. All of her books center around some central element, a secret or some deeply held series of<br />what may at the time seemed inconsequential white lies . . .but which later build into literally mountains of deceit . . .affecting many lives down through the years . . .This story is no different . . . it gets off to a slow start but once it gets started, you won't be able to put it down.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My kids and I play this game together. It is fun and the first 20 are really easy. But I how the rest will be more challenging. We have the Gnomes game (not electronic) and its just like this.

B00CSR2J9I|5.0|but it works on my phone it makes me mad that ir doesn't work on my kindle fire fuuun!!! though
B00CFQMVLS|3.0|There are a lot of subtitles in this movie, and I go to a movie to see it, not read it.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Kept my attention, did not care for ending. Left me wanting , closure  for nick, closure for Amy. Did not expect the book to end this way!!!
B0000UJDLM|5.0|I'm a total 80s kid. This was one of those movies I'd totally remembered as a kid. Certain lines, certain scenes - just stuck. The quality wasn't anything moder. I run a 36 inch 720p, and the letter boxing on the movie itself made it seem like it was on an old tv surrounded by wooden panels.<br /><br />Nevertheless, that is besides the point. The movie overall is a classic. Johnny 5!! Simple plot, decent cast, and just good memories.
B008PZZYB2|5.0|My wife and I love this movie.  For us, it's one of those rare movies we can watch over and over again.<br /><br />A fan of Ben Stiller?? If so, watch this movie!
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|i love this show i could sit here and watch it all day. not to mention my 2 year old boy he gets lost in the sheep's antics.
B006SV2LWA|3.0|makes you not want to shake hands or drink from a glass, or sit next to someone with a cough!
B005CRQ3NY|1.0|Cheshire<br />The only thing that I am not sure what is the game was a surprise that I have a good online marketing campaign for your website design I need someone who knows what the weapons are not sure how much money I have been the star wars wiki and check out this week in the star port and the weapons are not the game was not good enough to make a difference between an hour
B008M87GJK|5.0|Great app. Love the way the news is split up into sections and the ease of access.  Seems very up to date<br />with what is happening in the world.
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|Absolutely loved it i would recomend to anyone specially if you like things like lord of the rings and i cant wait for the next season to release
B004LWZWGK|4.0|Blu-ray is good. The story and plot not the greatest. First Dark Knight was way better with the Joker character, but the Bane one in this movie was a little weak. Anyway it's a Batman movie so just enjoy the ride.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|When ever I close the app and open it back over it makes me download 2 things and then I get to play it. I hats that so I would suggest you not get this app I guess.
B008M4MB8K|5.0|This is one of Ridley Scott's best sci-fi since Alien. Great story and special effects along with fantastic soundtrack by Vangelis. I still believe the narration version by Harrison Ford was better. I definitely recommend this Blu-ray because it has both versions.
B00AO2P3GA|3.0|Fix your multiplayer servers MC4! Please fix them, i can't buy anything or add any new perks. Other than that jts a fun game though
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Just read the book and find out- Im not an emotional reader but this novel will forever be my exception
B00992CF6W|5.0|Very imaginative brilliant .  Heres the seed  its a trap  very nice minecraft keep up the sweet game  more updates
B003H4I4JU|5.0|This series makes me feel so much compassion for every living creature, that Iam almost saddened to step on an ant. or son Scott Card is an amazing humanist, and a great storyteller!
B009KS4XRO|4.0|The game is fun. There are plenty of great games to play. The only problem I see is the game freezes quite a bit.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|Both things I like most in games . Plus bonuses for small accomplishments, and it gives you energy over time so it's not like you have to spend money to get energy you just have to wait.
B00AOGKA1O|5.0|It is a difficult read for sure, but I remember it from undergraduate macro.  It is even clearer  now that I have so many years (ugh) of experience listening to economists trying to ignore it.  Slog thru the first time, then let it age.  It gets easier the second time.  And remember he was writing on a much chalked black board.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I won't spoil it by describing it, but its a great adventure and you should read it. I am a voracious reader and a tough critic, so please, please, try to trust me on this.
B00ECUARO8|4.0|Although Reese Witherspoon does appear in the movie, this is McConaughey's all the way. Some folks haven't even seen his pre-RomCom work and so don't even know that he can act. Here's your proof.
B005LJK3AC|1.0|The language and comedy was so incredibly tacky and vulgar I just had to turn it off. I wish that comedians could show some class. There is no need to be extremely obscene to be funny...it just displays a lack of creativity and talent.
B007THA4FI|3.0|I bought this book immediately after reading 'The Cuckoo's Calling', this book wasn't as enjoyable in my opinion.  I couldn't decide if it was a teenage book or what.  I found it hard to keep up with who was who, and who was married to who.  I stuck with it through the end but it wasn't one of my favorites.
B001CFLHJA|5.0|I gave this CD to my wife as a gift.  She is a smooth jazz fan and absolutely loves this album!
B00A285OOW|4.0|I enjoyed the discovering of the time it all took place. The lives, the clothes the history. Yes I would recommend it.
0802473156|5.0|This book is not just a book for married couples,but for all those who love and want to be loved.Chapman did  a great job by explicitly outlining and discussing the five basic love languages for all.Words of affirmation,quality time,receiving gifts,acts of service and physical touch are very much critical for any relationship.What a great writer!
0770433782|5.0|A beautiful book with lots of ideas.  Planning a wedding can be daunting and this book gives you a visual feast to sink your creative teeth into.  Love it.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|Exactly as advertised. Brand new copy with digital copy. We all love it.<br />Idont know why there  is a word requirement limit.
B00AKOB7CG|5.0|I totally recommend it, I download other ones of this same developer and I totally want to purchase them, they are excellent.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|Good read on women's issues in prison. Author took responsibility for her actions and shared the insides. Some parts were long and boring while others were interesting. Overall, would recommend it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really enjoy this game. It is not too hard and too easy. But I am stuck on level 10.  Cant get the key out of the bow in le vent. Anyone help!
B0050DIWFC|1.0|Continued to read to find a happy ending. It was not meant to be! I can not be<br />I'd've people write these stories!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|GREAT BOOK!  A REAL PAGE TURNER<br />CANT WAIT FOR THE 3RD INSTALLMENT OF THE TRILOGY!<br />ANOTHER MASTER PIECE BY A BRILLIANT AUTHOR.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|The game is fun but it's clearly designed to get you to spend lots of money on credits so you can continue to play.
B00BXKKNFS|1.0|I say possibly because I'm not about to try to reinstall. As soon as I installed on my Nexus 7 (2013), it wouldn't reboot. I reinstalled to factory and added back all my apps including that one. This time, all the google apps started locking up rendering it absolutely useless.<br /><br />Called Asus for tech support and they had me reinstall to factory and wipe my cache as well. I installed all but that one and haven't had a problem since.<br /><br />So, I can't say *for sure* this app did it (and I love it on pc, etc.), but I'm not about to try again.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was the first Gillian Flynn novel I have read and I think I could read a menu written by her.  I read a lot of suspense novels, but this one had me guessing all the way.  Still trying to get my head around the ending.
B008EZVNFE|5.0|I'M TRYING TO FIND YOU................  It's a dream and I can't wake up.  But who would want to wake up and miss a note?
B000E1ZBGS|2.0|I purchased this DVD as a NEW item sold through Amazon Prime.  When I received it, the DVD was flimsily wrapped in cellophane, when opened there was  only the DVD, nothing else, obviously missing the little informative paper that is  clipped inside the case.  The DVD itself seems OK.  I have not experienced this before with Amazon.
B00C061I1M|4.0|I wasn't expecting that.  Great back up that you wouldn't expect in this style.  Can't believe that these are new songs.  They are so true to the to the tradition, but have her own stamp on them.  Another favorite  Kathy Mattea &#34;Coal&#34;
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great app...shame it stops at level 10 and will not let u carry on!!! Need more! Great if u like games like Rooms etc.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|Everyone should get this app because it is awesome.I had finished it and I'm thinking about getting gangstar vegas. This will get you busy and addictive!
B00AHQNHSY|5.0|Amazon did not make it easy or obvious to watch movies I already own on my fire.  This free program works fine and has played the mp4 and avi version of my DVDs with no problem.  I had to rip the movies to the appropriate format but most of them were already ripped so we could watch them on laptops.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|3 of my kids ages 3, 5, 7 just loved this movie. It is packed full of action. They are begging me to take them to see the second one.  Can't wait
B00EM764ZC|3.0|This program runs fine but since it requires internet access to use the maps is is of limited use to me on a machine that does not have 3G or 4G connectivity
1609611543|5.0|This book changed my life. Prior to reading this fabulous book, I felt like I was 90 years old. I had pain everywhere. I could barely function. When I read the book and how wheat affects our life negatively, I wasn't sure if I believed what I was reading. But, I said to myself, okay what do you have to lose. I stopped eating wheat and within 3 to 4 days the pain in my body disappeared. Within 2 months I felt like I was 30 years old. I am 60 years. The inflammation all over my body is gone<br />I have sarcodosis in the lung, and my chest had been hurting on an off for 10 years. After 6 to 7 months of going wheat free the pain in my chest is gone. I believe that anyone that is ill should read this book, It will change you life too.
B00846REIS|5.0|My daughter recommend this book to me.  I loved it I would highly recommend it to others.  Cannot wait to read what happens to Gordon and ava next.  Linda smith
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|This is an excellent book by a wonderful historian and great writer. An easy read, it's full of  little-known information. Highly recommended.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Smart comedy at it's finest. Some of the most amazing wardrobe selections since Sex & the CIty. A great lawyer comedy show.
0763635383|5.0|This book, along with the animations, is a hit.  It is a great story and the additional animation is loved by children.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|The movie came fairly fast and is great! Just as described online, it is the three disk set with blue ray and digital.
B00E978FGQ|3.0|Magic is about suspending disbelief. It's the one big factor it shares with movies. But the kinds of illusions you see from the likes of Copperfield, Angel, and Penn & Teller have pretty obvious parameters. Here's a bullet with your initials fired from a gun and caught in the teeth of someone across the stage. Watch as these nails and swords pierce my flesh with no seeming damage. Solid Lucite box? I'll float in it. Ta da.<br /><br />Movie magic requires a whole lot more to both earn and reward that suspension of disbelief. It takes interesting and believable characters. It takes entertaining and engaging storytelling. It takes a movie world that plays by some understandable and consistent ground rules. Without that, all you've got is spectacle. A lot of hocus with none of the follow-up pocus. If that makes any sense.<br /><br />NOW YOU SEE ME is a story about four B-list magicians who are invited via mysterious cards to be a part of some kind of be-all, end-all magic trick. It might have something to do with a magician named Shrike who died during a botched trick long ago. It might have something to do with robbing millions of dollars in cash. It might even have something to do with a group called The Eye that is the supposed guardian of real, live, actual magic!<br /><br />It's really not very clear. Ever. Like a magician with too much patter, the movie keeps trying to explain itself but is still so desperate to keep some of that magic that it's explanations only go halfway. Most of them come from Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman), a man who has dedicated his life to debunking magicians. He keeps detailing how tricks are done, but he never really does fill in all the blanks. He can tell you how four magicians robbed a bank in Paris while standing on a stage in America, but he conveniently leaves out the part where they burst into wads of cash while jumping off a twenty story roof. The last third of the movie is glutted with this kind of heavy and inconsistent exposition, and it makes the film feel like it's not entirely comfortable with its subject matter.<br /><br />Because there's so much going on, there is really very little time to get to know or even care about any of the characters. Our four magicians end up feeling more like props or set pieces, and in spite of their glitzy bravado and showmanship, they are about as hollow and fake as a mirrored box. The movie's emotional hook lies in Dylan (Mark Ruffalo), the FBI agent who is hell-bent on hunting them down. Unfortunately, he ends up being a one-note character as well, and the story takes him into a place that is supposed to be magical, but that ends up feeling like a really cheap trick, like the \\"got your nose\\" of the cinematic world.<br /><br />The movie, in spite of all of this, is a helluva a lot of fun to look at, and there are some satisfying moments here and there (including an amazingly choreographed fight scene/car chase). No actor really stood out, but then again, none of them were glaringly bad, either. However, unlike a magic show where they take great pains to roll up the sleeves and denounce camera or light trickery, this flick -- both the way it's filmed and told -- just feels like a lot of smoke and mirrors and not much else. You might be able to suspend your disbelief for the film, but like the old trick with the floating woman, you'll probably need the help of some wires and wenches to keep it up there for the entire movie.sition, and it makes the film feel like it's not entirely comfortable with its subject matter.<br /><br />Because there's so much going on, there is really very little time to get to know or even care about any of the characters.

B000002L5I|5.0|An excellent CD. Kenny Wayne Shepherd has been lauded as one of the very best blues guitarists of all times.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|This is by far one of my favorite bingo games! I love it! You get to play different maps and collect pieces for a higher daily credit. Keeps me coming back daily!
B000FFJYCU|5.0|I love it & it came in from Friday to Tuesday & that was great. I have not checked all the stuff on the dvds yet but I get to that later..
B005IQZB14|5.0|I wasn't sure about the book when I downloaded it, but was very happy I did! I love to hike, although I've never done anything like the PCT. Cheryl made her experiences on the trail come alive, and had me thinking that perhaps I should try a small portion of it myself. The additions of her personal life, the things that compelled her to take on this extreme adventure, showed just how strong a person she really is!!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|very fun game but I had a problem where I had to shut down the kindle to get out of the app
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Follett gives a fine 'walk through' of some of the major historical events of the twenteeth Century. An easy way to get some sort of overview of the political development taking place in the World at that time, seen from the perspective of different countries involved in the 2. World War combined with the personal stories of the characters in the book.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I was amazed how this series, especially Catching Fire, just kept the level of interest and adventure kept your attention.  I couldn't put the book down.  Suzanne Collins demonstrated great character development and Katniss was an incredible young woman with values and inner strength in facing the challenges presented to her.  We need more female heroes!  Thank you for a great read and series!
B006X5L6VS|4.0|I love showing my grandkids the constellations and it is another way of telling them about my grandparents while I do
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I downloaded this because my son plays it on his tablet and he wanted me to play with him.. well I actually like playing it, good graphics, funny cute animals and fun games and tasks. Sometimes it gets a little blotchy and freezes and I wish they made more ways to get free acorns but otherwise it's a fun way to kill some time and to play a fun tablet game with your kids.
B00CF34B2I|1.0|Everyone I play the game crashes I have A Toshiba thrive. This is very disappointing. Wish I would have never spent the $10.00
B00APACSJG|4.0|Even if I don't care for the subject, I end up liking the book. In this one, Miles has to solve another puzzle for the Emperor, but he has help from his 'brother', Mark. It's an interesting look at one issue of cryogenics.  I hope there is a sequel to this one in the works!
B007AL48UK|2.0|It was very difficult to work.  The instructions were terrible. I deleted it from my Kindel and will continue to look for one I enjoy.
B005OZE9SA|1.0|Before I go into detail, I'd like to say that the only reason I gave this product a one star review is because I'm hoping that it will get people's attention due to the fact that there aren't a lot of low ratings. So let's get started by listing the positives.<br /><br />First off, you're paying a low amount of money for a great piece of hardware. The mic pre's are just what's expected out of focusrite. The unit is well constructed and won't break easily, certainly not for a home studio guy such as myself who doesn't take it a lot of places. As far as figuring out how to use the scarlett, there aren't many more straight forward interfaces out there, all the buttons and switches are pretty easy to pick up on and shouldn't take a lot of time to master.<br /><br />I figured that all the reviews online couldn't be lying so I went out and picked one up from my local guitar center. Out of the box, it was beautiful. However, there were major problems I noticed right away. I downloaded all the drivers correctly as I was instructed by the manual. When I plugged the unit in, my laptop ceased to work, and crashed. I got blue screens everytime I would plug the unit in. So I thought, \\"okay, easy fix. I'll just go install the newest drivers from the website.\\" Well that didn't turn out very well because when I clicked the link from the downloads page on focusrite's website, it brought me to an expired webpage. On several different occasions I tried this same thing with no luck.<br /><br />I figured that maybe I had a dud so I returned it to guitarcenter where they gave me a new one and sent me on my way. When I got home, same exact thing. Very frustrating process that eventually got solved by me going, for the seventh time, to focusrite's website and trying once again to download the correct drivers. And for some reason, it worked. So if you are having the same problem as I am, I honestly don't know what to tell you. I just kept trying until it worked.<br /><br />So overall, Id say it's a great product made by an irritating and angering company. I don't think there is, however, another interface like this out there for the price. So if you think that the frustration and possible trouble is worth it, which I think it may end up being, I would say that this is a great piece of hardware. However, make sure you understand that there are possible obstacles that you may run into.
B004FDPOHC|5.0|Love this CD it is great music Daft punk made a great soundtrack to a really good movie I'm glad I purchased it
B001NHNG64|4.0|I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to lose themselves to the plot and manipulation of the characters to the point you're thinking you can help our hero somehow.
B0028R3NCU|4.0|Overall, it's goodness. I had one previously, and needed to pick up a couple more. The product itself is good. The suppliers on the other hand, not so much. Two of the three I ordered, all delivered together, were damaged, slightly dented. I believe they are still functional, but are difficult \\"giving up\\" the Micro SD card, if you will. Otherwise, great little product, this one. Highly recommended. Also positive: Unbuntu Linux drivers support it, which cannot be said of at least one of its competitors.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I love this app.  I unfortunately do not have the internet at my home so I just use this app to download YouTube videos when I have free public internet access.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Having read some of this series, out of order, I was anxious to start at the beginning and find out more about Jack Reacher. He became quite real to me, with a great story line, unfolding with lots of characters well drawn.
B00E6Z0THE|5.0|This was a fun and casual puzzle game for a good price.  I enjoyed the game play and the graphics.
B001NHNG64|5.0|Intriguing, and full of suspense.  Main character, Jack Reacher ,keeps the reader wondering about his life style and his decisions.
B0079XPUOW|5.0|Have you ever wondered what the extras on your favorite sci-fi drama were doing off camera during all the drama on screen?  Well this book tells you how it is with a side splitting and sarcastic wit.  John Scalzi is the master of Meta with Redshirts.  I highly recommend it to any sci-fi lover with a sense of humor.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Tragic story, which is typical of good science fiction.  Probably not for everyone, but if you like science fiction, this is among the best of the best in scifi.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love playing this game. Lots of fun. The sound is clear. Boards are very easy to see when you have two or more.
B002HJ9PTO|1.0|We used this mic successfully twice. Now there's a loud, steady buzzing sound (almost like feedback) whenever we try to use it. Same camera, same settings, the mic just quit working properly.<br /><br />I've done some research to fix the problem, but all I find are message boards full of other people with the same problem. Don't get this mic unless you're prepare to be left high and dry during a filming session.
B0063M22QO|3.0|This game is okay but not as interesting as mah Jong dimensions or mah Jong trails.  Neither of these will play without adobe flash player. All of tablets including iPad are disappointing because they don't support adobe flash app.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|The Battery HD Pro is something that I use periodically during the day to assess my Kindle Fire battery level. The HD Pro give great feedback, is easy to understand and visualize, and I would highly recommend it.
B008RA3X5E|3.0|It's okay. I like the brightness. I am still getting used to it. I guess it will be better after I've had it awhile.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|I was initially turned off by Tom Cruise in this role; because Reacher is supposed to be a rather tall and powerful man. However, Cruise carried it off and gave a believable performance even if he does not meet the author's physical version of his famous hero. I found the movie to be gripping and interesting while holding close to the spirit of the Reacher novels.
B003WE9TU8|4.0|I haven't seen the movie due to universal condemnation, but I am told this is nothing like this.<br />I really enjoyed the solid, credible and meticulously detailed view that was painted as to what the world would actually be like if it was overrun by zombies. The only bit part that you need to suspend disbelief is that the Zombies exist in the first place. Once past that it is 100% realistic, and very original.
B00BESM14U|5.0|This movie really surprised me with its performance, well done story, original approach, great and interesting actors, and just overall great entertainment level.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|THIS GAME IS FUN TO PLAY, EVEN THE KIDS ENJOY PLAYING IT. TRY IT, IF YOU LIKE THESE KIND OF GAMES YOU WILL LIKE THIS ONE.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My 9 year old son loves this game and I got it for him. He can play this game for hours while frequently laughing along with it.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|Never before had I thought that I would be so obsessed with a book...but fifty shades kept me awake for several nights and the anticipation I felt for the sequels was huge!!<br />  I just loved it and since then I keep reading romance,but trust me,I only found one or two romance books that worth reading,just like 50 shades do!!!<br /> Don't miss reading it!!
B004EBZX6W|5.0|This Wi-Fi Analyzer was something that I really needed for my Kindle Fire because of intermittant problems with our home Wi-Fi unit. The Analyzer works great, gives several types of feedback and is a great tool for its purpose.
B005HEK3JW|5.0|We skipped year one and two, after trying a few shows, but the cast and writers kept improving, and we will watch this series until the end of the last season.Good sci fi but we still like Enterprise and Deep Space Nine better.
B0066WJLU6|4.0|The Flashlight HD LED for my Kindle Fire does the job when you need light when its dark. Its free price was also attractive.
B00640UICA|5.0|The Icon for this game makes it look like it's for children; after a few levels most smart adults will find it quite challenging!!!!  AN EXCELLENT LOGIC PUZZLE GAME (with rather infantile yet cute graphics and sound) .  I like it ....
1439152810|5.0|The story is written so the reader really becomes invested in the characters.  The search by Laurel to find the answer to her mother's secret is compelling.  The storyline of Jimmy, Dolly and Vivien is entwined with sadness, joy, and the sense of danger due to Vivien's husband.  Very well written.  The ending had me exclaiming out loud and smiling!
B008ZOHCKE|3.0|I honestly don't know why anyone would use this when they could have something better and more powerful just by downloading Evernote.
B00BRH2MN8|5.0|Amazing talented young woman. Love every song, wish there were more! Will buy another album from Lorde soon, I recommend the same!
0356502473|4.0|Anthony Ryan's 1st book here is by far one of the strongest debut fantasy novels I've read in a while. Solid world-building and character development, along with loads of well written action sequences, made for a never bored reading experience.<br /><br />This is a great start to a legend. Reminded me of a mix of 300 and Gladiator.<br /><br />There is also plenty of mystery and suspense that left me wanting to know more in the next volume.
B006OE7XM4|5.0|Excellent & fast Delivery Service!  Great DVD!!  Good Music to listen to while driving.  One of the best dvds I have purchased in a long time.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Beautiful scenery, costumes, and story line.  Very enjoyable to watch! Way to go, PBS! Definitely watch seasons 1 and 2 before season 3.
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|slow starter & a bit annoying at first. gets better half way through the movie. good romantic ending. worth watching. it would have gotten a better rating if the first half were better.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This app is so much fun. I like that if you can't play for a couple days it lets you use acorns to go back where you left off, and that way you don't lose any progress or you can just continue playing if you don't choose that option. I have been playing this for a few months and never get bored of it.
B00BEIYH6U|3.0|This sequel's  plot is better than the first movie \\"Kick Ass\\" because, it was developed from it to include more costumed heroes versus villains!  Eleven  year old version Hit Girl should have her own movies about her as the main character! Maybe constantly changing eleven year old child actresses could be in spin-off sequels instead of about the title's main character \\"Kick Ass\\" and \\"Kick Ass2\\" ! Hit Girl's character extreme youthful cuteness factor enhances the comedy and her mutilating and killing criminals made a surrealistically perfect heroine!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I loved it soooooo much! so what I'm 15 its awesome! it's great for all ages! and super fun as well!
B00DDXJRJG|5.0|I have over 300 songs on my kindle fire hd and the speakers are good, but not good enough for music with a room full of people.  I was gonna buy a powerful speaker for about 50 dollars.  I have no need now with this app.  My music sounds great and for 2 dollars, it sounds like I added  nice set of speakers.  I saved about 48 dollars because  i dont have to buy speakers.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I did not expect that ending.  I enjoyed it.  It was nice to finish it off and be done but I enjoyed 90% of the ride.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is great fun!  My 6 year old loves it almost as much as I do. Great family game!
B00B23O96A|5.0|Clapton in his old style and groove. He is back to his best. The old sock is as fresh as ever
B005QYKD4I|4.0|Just not my type of movie, I guess.  Was hard to follow and didn't seem to have a story line.  I only watched the first of the movie and changed to something else.
B001TCNSOI|5.0|Poignant, Beautifully done, tear jerking movie that will give hope when all hope is lost!! A true lesson in the meaning of the phrase&#34; Never give up!&#34;
B006MW3V6U|5.0|An interesting commentary on life in England at the early part of the 20th century. Great characters who act well. Costuming is outstanding!!!
B005544TRQ|5.0|This is a very entertaining show - kept me wanting to see more.<br /><br />I do wonder whether real life lawyers behave and live this way...
B00BQPEIT2|4.0|I like but the disappear when dead I don't.I know this is wizard of oz but do something else .and low definition screens.
1849905789|5.0|The TV series was amazing and so is this book. Great easy to follow receipt, beautifully photographs. The instructions are an easy read and straight forward to read and you get to reduce the most amazing dishes!
B005QBBC2S|5.0|The acting in this movie was awesome, but the story is incredibly sad. It's been several days since I watched it and it still haunts my mind.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|fun game....challenging but entertaining. it makes u wanna keep playing. it gets addictive but its gotta be a great workout for ya brain! :)
B004VBAHG6|5.0|I bought the CD and vinyl. Great production. Great compositions. Peter is in good vocal form. The sound of vinyl is wonderful, is among the best I have. Worth buying. The band that accompanies it is excellent. Bauhaus also play masterfully in his tour of 35 years. I watched in Brazil. Bring on many albums
B00AB55BS0|5.0|Game of Thrones is a great series. The Blu-Ray here is a great package. What I would like to add is the Digital Copy provided here is the best I have seen. Instead of providing some lousy Non-HD copy on a disc, you redeem it from iTunes and you got a 1080p HD version of it as well. I think this is a great value and a great convenience.
B0042J6VUS|1.0|Does not fit an iPhone. Material is flemsy and not balanced. Not even worth $1. Do not buy this ever.
B006XBSC8C|5.0|I loved it very happy with my purchase.....so glad i was able to find it on here!!! and im 50 years old so i can review this!!!!!!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Love this clock!  It is not only beautiful but functional with the built in alarm clock.  Has everything I need.
B0063GORYU|5.0|If there were no ads it would be perfect but at least it is free!<br />So you can't really complain&hellip;
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The graphics r great they always have new updates and it is really addictive and fun all around I think it earned 5 stars
1609611543|5.0|This is a great book with lots of good thoughts about wheat and why we should avoid eating it. It is good reading...if you want to gain more information about what is good food for our bodies!
B00009V7PJ|5.0|really thought it was only a CD when I ordered it. Was really surprised when I saw the DVD. Fantastic! Wonderful wardrobe! I do have history of being in Circus business, and was STILL impressed!! You, go, girl!! She is SO the original Diva, of which all others tried to imitate, but, they truly broke the mold, with Cher!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|fun game.  i like that theres always a mind bender in each room.  love it.  I hope there are many move levels to look forward to.
1451695195|2.0|One can't help but wonder: Is this guy being honest???<br />Or is he simply trying to cash in on the New Age money machine using his \\"Neurosurgeon\\" background?<br /><br />Because if he's truly a man of conviction he would commit suicide.<br /><br />Why?<br /><br />Because he claims that the hereafter is a blissed-out theatre of pure unending Divine beauty and love.  Who in his right mind would *want* to stay in this world -- with its hatreds, petty grievances, suffering, fears and violence -- after that???<br /><br />In fact, why don't all people who profess to have had a genuine NDE (Near Death Experience) kill themselves?<br />If you're living in project housing, have a heroin habit and an abusive spouse and facing more of the same -- then why in heaven would you want to continue when you *know* that there's a much, much, much better life after death?<br /><br />Something's not right.<br /><br />He says his neocortex (the part of the brain that makes us \\"human\\") was totally out during his coma, hence no other explanation for his \\"trans-earthly\\" journey than the fact that it must've really happened.<br /><br />He also says his \\"guide\\" in \\"heaven\\" was a girl who later turned out to have been the biological sister he never knew.  That part, more than any other, seemed truly transcendental.<br /><br />However...<br /><br />...there are too many allusions to Christianity and traditional angels and God, etc, to really be believable.  A short survey of Religion will instantly show it's done far more harm then good.  Old Testament alone is rife with genocides, xenophobia, racism, sexism, homophobia, etc, etc.  And just look at all the modern wars over religion and the evangelists and popes who poison people's minds with guilt and sexual neuroses, not to mention being child molesters.  One can go on and on.  For a more detailed look, read Richard Dawkins's \\"The God Delusion\\": [[ASIN:0618918248 The God Delusion Richard Dawkins]]<br /><br />So it's hard to consolidate the \\"proof\\" part with the Christian part.<br /><br />Finally, the most pressing questions never get answered.<br /><br />Mainly: What's the point???<br /><br />What's the point of this agony-filled earthly existence if you lose all memory of what you did on earth?<br />Why aren't we simply born into \\"Heaven\\" to begin with?<br />Why all the pain and torture?<br />Why's the point of all the inequality and injustice and insanity?  A world where the one percent have everything and everyone else has garbage?  Or one guy is Hugh Hefner and a million other guys die virgins?  For that matter, what's the point of being carnal, lust-filled animals if we're all headed to the \\"Core\\" where there is no sex apparently?  And sex, as we all know, is the main driving force behind everything we do, consciously or subconsciously.<br /><br />In the end, I wanted to believe him, but there were too many \\"red flags.\\"  I couldn't help but wonder: Did this guy have a mortgage he needed to pay off?  Sure he's an MD and teaches at Harvard, but the more you make the more you spend...you get my drift.<br /><br />If he did make up this stuff (exploiting people's desire for peace) then he should be more than ashamed.  He should be in Hell.
0452295548|5.0|As a medical professional I had a preconceived idea about how the progress of my mothers stroke would be.  Fortunately and serendipitously I came across this book at just the right time.  My mothers course was truly a miracle but along with that the family was able to help her manifest that miracle.  My mother continued to progress way beyond the limits traditional medicine taught me.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game I've been playing it for a long time it's is fun and challenging I could play it for hours
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is a very entertaining game but addicting.. If you have time to play all day then it is for you, otherwise don't get started.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game , it get better every time you play. Despicable me is way better than temple run I can tell you that .
B00DHSK3RM|5.0|It is very entertaining but very much addicting so if you don't want to be addicting then don't get started.
B00AFROVQC|3.0|This book is exactly the kind of book I would have loved in junior high!  Lots of strange creatures, knights, sheep, yellow fire and good guys and bad guys fighting it out.  The writing is great and the descriptions are top notch.<br /><br />Nowadays, this book isn't really for me, but I'd buy it in a heartbeat for a young friend who loves adventure books.
B002LVVCQM|5.0|This book is amazing. I have learned so much and am continuing to every time I read this. I have had to re-read some sections for clarification but I cannot put this book down!
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Looking forward to future books, movies, TV shows and however many children Tina Fey decides to have in her life.  This is a book to read aloud to your husband and laugh out loud over.  It's deep. Life lessons aren't always philosophical or pretty, but can be found at 6 a.m. standing next to a toilet with your kid.  Loved it.  Powerful read.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I absolutely love the game it makes you have to think . I truly find myself playing for hours it seems . My addiction ! ..... But I do think if the game had hints on some of the more difficult levels it would help . Other then then that I loved it.
B004ZNA7WY|5.0|I own them all and this is still my favorite Pink Floyd cd.To my ears the remaster is maybe too much remaster,but not enough to stop someone from buying it.11 wonderful songs.Roger who???.......support your favorite artists.
B0006GAOCW|5.0|this movie is very good I enjoy watching Katie it is heart filling and make's you feel for the people in the lime light<br />that did not want it
B007L96VCY|5.0|Well done on the remaster.Paul in his prime.I wish music sounded half this good today.Buy the cd and listen over and over.2 cds and a total of 22 songs-76 minutes.CD 1 is toppermost....support your favorite artists.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|The first movie has been digitally enhanced so that it matches the clarity and color palette of the sequels.<br /><br />All three films now include two audio commentaries: one by the film critics Todd McCarthy, John Powers and David Thomson; and one by the philosophers Ken Wilber and Cornel West. In a written introduction, the Wachowskis explain that this is to inspire an implied dialogue between both camps so that the audience &#34;might triangulate their own position&#34;.<br /><br />The set also features The Matrix Reloaded Revisited and The Matrix Revolutions Revisited, two new 'making of' documentaries on the sequels, divided into segments on larger sequences or aspects of production, which may in turn be viewed as short (~5-20 minute) segments. The Reloaded Revisited disk also includes the footage shot especially for the Enter the Matrix video game, which previously could only be seen after having completed certain parts of the game.<br /><br />Three of the disks are not connected to specific movies in the series. &#34;The Roots Of The Matrix&#34; contains two short documentaries, discussing the philosophy and science of the series as a whole. &#34;The Burly Man Chronicles&#34; provides a documentary on the trials and tribulations faced by the crew in the production of &#34;The Matrix Reloaded&#34; and &#34;The Matrix Revolutions.&#34; Finally, &#34;The Zion Archive&#34; is a collection of information on the merchandising, marketing and spin-off franchises; as well as miscellaneous material such as concept sketches.
B005LAII4E|5.0|Just a great fun action filled movie to kick back and relax to.Great movie and great transfer to blu-ray.No story or thinking involved.Just fun......support your favorite artists.
193700788X|5.0|The book was a great end to a fun series to read. Enjoyed the author's sense of humor that comes through in the story line and characters.
B009K0P10K|5.0|Couldn't stop watching, in fact watched 2 episodes (okay, 3) every night which says a lot from someone who rarely watches TV.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|the best app ever!I love this app it just. could not get any better I just got sun dragon. love this app
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|Does not work has errors in it can't even open it. first time of all the products I have bought at amazon that I have had a problem still love amazon trying to get help with a fix
0064471837|5.0|This book is in short, absolutely amazing. Garth Nix has an amazing was of taking you into another world and describing it in a way so vivid and clear, that I can still see myself standing in the Abhorsen's tower.<br /><br />I recommend this book to absolutely everyone I meet and have read it five times so far. Considering I rarely read books, that's saying something.<br />I don't want to write any spoilers, but safe to say, if you haven't read it, then order this right now. Sit in front of your door until it arrives, then make sure you have an adequate amount of tea and enjoy.
B001FA0W5W|2.0|A painful read.  This book would easily get 5+ stars but for the author's constant barrage of insults towards anyone he's ever encountered (& those he hasn't).  I understand Mr. Taleb is a smart person; that's why I've chosen to read his book.  He doesn't need to constantly remind me of his superior wisdom by insulting everyone else.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Wonderful story line...great actors..love the period story line....just a perfect movie to spend an evening with a special person and a glass of wine!!!! by a fireplace and a Bloodhound on a rug...
B006M4F67A|4.0|Great game with no interruptions for more tokens or money. Endless combinations of classic mah jong patterns Good variety  of puzzles
B0094BB4TW|2.0|Too much junk and advertising. But its a good median to catch old friends and to keep in touch others.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|My nephew loves it. He's 3 years old. So since he loves it and want put it down unless we tell him to. I give the game Thumbs Up! I recommend it to all.<br /><br />Zelda
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I have always love John Grisham books and once again, he performed outstandishly with &#34;The Racketeer&#34;. Looking forward to his next book.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|Couldn't put it down. My kindle died and I had to sit by the wall plug-in to finish reading it!
B0015T7Q98|4.0|Not their best effort. However, it's still really good. It's a very good prequel to Vices & Virtues, setting up the mood well. All in all, a very good sophomore album.
B00A2LOAKI|5.0|Finally got the final installment of The Dark Knight Returns, can't wait to watch it. Always been a huge fan of Batman and DC comics characters. First part was amazing, and this one will be too
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|I can't read it because I can't make the text bigger.<br />I would like it more if I could read it.
B002NHIJTW|5.0|I'm an Edward fan so getting past these vamps many flaws was a stretch but now it just makes them more endearing.  This is my favorite season because the love story is pureand new and unpolluted by popular struggles that make this story far far from a fairy tale.  Still love it!!!
B00BB8Q1RQ|5.0|Very fine piece of work....wonderful treatment of the beauty of Maine, the abortion issue treated with compassion, excellent camera work.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|I was very hesistant at first on watching this.  I thought it would be too silly.  I was way wrong!  It has the perfect blend of comedy and drama and also romance!  This series is definitely worth watching!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I didn't want it to end and feel like I've lost something when I was finished. I will be searching out this author.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Wondering when more will be coming.  Well written and good story. Is this a series?  I hope so as I will definitely will buy the rest.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is pretty cool &amp; so is the movies parts 1&amp;2 :) just wish I could use it with no Internet :-/
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Hard to ever win and hard to see, but then again I am older.  Bingo is one of my favorite games so I was looking forward to it but it is hard for me to see and even thought I have tried it lots, I think I only one once.  I little discouraging but still fun.
B00BC5FN2C|3.0|My expectations were that since this was an American story that it would stand on its' own.  The story is to much of a copy of the British original and even though Spacey is OK he absolutely cannot touch Ian Richardson's dazzling performance.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|Notice the bright glaring lights in every scene! Aren't they great? They make an otherwise boring film terribly exciting! And who needs all the hot chicks when you have all this friendly love between Spock and Kirk? Love you, Bro! No, man, I love you more! Watch this and you'll enjoy it as much as I did, but beware... it will take at least 20 points off your IQ.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|Another Sanderson masterpiece. Very enjoyable throughout and with some serious thoughts to share. I highly recommend it to fans of his other work.
B00ECUARO8|3.0|The story line was not well developed.  Life in  Arkansas on the River was accurately portrayed.  McConaughey's acting was good as well as the two boys.
B008PE9GSA|4.0|I purchased this as a thank you gift. The receiver is a big ZZ Top fan and he was rockin' to it the first weekend(rumored)
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|David Grohl is trying to save the once great music industry from so-called entertainers (notice, I didn't refer to them as musicians) like Justin Beieber, Beyonce, Katy Perry, Lady Gaga and the like.  Great movie... shows how professionals did things in the past and how some are striving to preserve the quality of great music still today.
B00D3XAA4M|5.0|I enjoyed the highlights.  I have experienced many of them and this was an enticement to visit the rest.  Nicely put together.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really don't know people don't like this game it is the best game in the whole entire world so whoever doesn't like this game you guys must really have no taste in video games what so ever.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|I am recently retired and have discovered the good wife.  As I hardly watched network shows, this is all new to me.  Am into season 2 and it is just as good.
B00006JL1Z|5.0|Excellent collection.  I would have only changed a few things.  \\"I Don't Want To Know\\" should have been included.  It was the first track on the US cassette version of Rumours and, while not a single, it was a hugely popular FM radio deepcut. This collection has some strange flip-flopping of live/studio versions of songs.  \\"Big Love\\", while the live version is excellent, should have been the more familiar studio version that was a #2 radio hit.  The 1975 version of \\"Landslide\\" is a great song but, it should not have been included.  It never became a hit until the live version from The Dance was released as a single in 1998.  Also, they should have at least added one pre-1975 track, such as the classic rock radio staple,\\"Oh Well\\".  Overall, it's most of everything you could ever want from the most commercial period in the history of Fleetwood Mac.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love Downton Abbey. Best series ever. I wish they could add more episodes. I can't  stop watch it because is sooo good.
B007KQI1NA|5.0|Purchased this for my laptop for storm tracking and location plotting with radar software. Works quite well for what I need it for.
B00005RFAI|5.0|If you are a P!NK fan you must have this for your collection, you can see her progression from back then to now.  Love her voice love this CD.  I say a must have for every P!nk lover!!
B000WZAE1I|5.0|I THINK THIS WAS A GREAT BUY AND REALLY LOVE THIS MOVIE, I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ALL FRIENDAS AND FAMILY.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|Was surprised the book was on the far side of what is real.  Not my usual type of reading.  Don't go for all the make believe type of reading.
B001EBYMB2|4.0|A good movie that goes beyond blood & guts and gets to the heart of some of the men who gave so much for this country.
B00CTKHXFO|5.0|If you're a fan of the Metal Gear franchise or want to get the whole story, then this purchase is a no brainer.
B000002GVO|5.0|I saw the Eagles on their Hotel California tour in the '70s.  This CD brings me back to Madison Square Garden and their awesome harmony!
B00846REIS|5.0|This is the book with a great plot.  Sexy book without S & M.  The twists are wonderful.  Loved it.

0064471837|5.0|I first read Sabriel over a dozen years ago, as a 6th grader. I had found it in the YA section of my local library, but it was nothing like any of the other books on the shelves there: there was a darkness and a sincerity I'd never found before, and the emotion - the fear, and the pride, and the joy, and the hope - I felt as I read was different from what I'd known with any of my favorites. As an adult, I can talk about things like \\"a lack of condescension\\", but as an eleven-year-old all I knew was that I'd found something breathtaking. The book had an adventure story and a talking cat and magic bells, but there was something else besides; there were zombies and horrors in Death, but there was a reverence and a peace in it, too.<br /><br />The sincerity of that dichotomy resonated deeply, and to this day the emotion echoes.
