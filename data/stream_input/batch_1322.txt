B0063IH60K|5.0|this is my favorite solitaire game. I have it loaded on all my devices. it is a lot of fun and relaxes me.
B003Y5H4Y8|5.0|I honestly don't understand the strange, negative reviews here. The acting is absolutely spot-on. The cast could not be more perfect than it is. So what is the problem with these lame, pestilent, reviewers?  This is a rivetingly good film. (The only thing I kept thinking was in 1997--cellphones were not the small soap-size gizmos we have nowadays. They could have had the characters talking on what was more on the market back in the late '90's) Otherwise, this film was engrossing as any suspense drama could possibly be. Jessica Chastain was amazingly good (and gorgeous) as were Sam Worthington and  Marton Csokas. Helen Mirren, Tom Wilkinson, Ciarin Hinds were brilliant as the older versions of these characters' selves so many decades later. So we have the final scene--but there was a juicy twist and I found it very plausible and believable.  This is one viewer who will be recommending this marvelous, on-the-edge-of-your-seat thriller.

0525478817|5.0|I read this book all in one day. It was impossible to put down. The words just jumped off the page and seemed to dance around me, literally, they did. It was such an amazing story. I'm not ashamed to admit that I cried, a lot. I must say that this is my new favorite book. It deserves all its praise and it's wonderful reviews.
B002RVCD0U|2.0|I loved the first three Terminator movies, they all had heart to them! But this one was a bit of a mis-fire!<br />What I liked about it:<br />1. Christian Bale nailed it as John Connor!<br />2. Sam Worthington's character Marcus was a great edition to the<br />Terminator universe!<br />3. The battles were well done!<br />4. The visual effects were top notch!<br />5. We sall some cool, new Terminators!<br />6. I'm glad that all the human resistance took John Connor's<br />side when Micheal Ironside put him down!<br />7. Moon Bloodgood was a great edition to the world of the Terminator!<br /><br />What I didn't like about it was:<br />1. Bryce Dallas Howard was not the best choice for Kate Connor!<br />2. Helena Bonham Carter was not the best choice for the<br />doctor (or whatever she was)!<br />3. The pace to the movie was choppy!<br />4. The lighting/coloring to the movie wasn't very impressive!<br />5. Come on, a Terminator movie without Arnold...?! What is the<br />world coming too?!<br />6. Why would a human lab/scientists turn Marcus into a<br />Terminator?<br />7. And speaking of which, didn't they destroy Cyberdine in T2?<br />8. The movie point wasn't as strong as the first three movie's<br />where (in T1, they were warned about Judgment Day, in T2, they<br />try to stop Judgment Day, in T3, we discover that Judgment Day<br />will come no matter what and it happens, but this movie simply<br />showed how John Connor became the leader of the resistance...)!<br />9. The movie was too focused on Marcus and not enough on John<br />Connor!<br /><br />Overall, this movie is a disappointment to me, they did try<br />but in the end, it was a let down!  Hopefully the next<br />one will be better!<br />My grade C+ or two-and-a-half stars!
0446547654|5.0|\\"The Best of Me\\" is a story of a forty-something guy who travels back to his hometown when his mentor passes away. The story goes through many flashbacks to Dawson's life and we find about his past one true love. Amanda travels back to her hometown for the funeral after having had a hard life. This is a story of past loves reconnecting in ways that brought tears to my eyes. This is just another story that gives Nicholas Sparks his well deserved credit. Nicholas Sparks really knows how to write a heart-warming and a heart-breaking love story for any age. The book itself has many ways of tugging at the heartstrings and making us feel something for the character's that are involved. The story-line kept my attention and made me want to turn the pages to keep reading. The ending had so many turns and twists, but made me realize that some loves never die. If this is your first time reading a Nicholas Sparks book, I recommend that you venture out and read many of his other stories. They never fail in creating a story that is beautiful and gives plenty of opportunity to create the characters in your mind.
B003EVFHYG|5.0|Let me just start by saying that I don't typically purchase instrumental soundtracks for movies. Up until my purchase of this album, my library consisted of the theme from Gladiator only because it belongs to my favorite movie of all time. My son is now almost 2 years old and How To Train Your Dragon is by far his favorite movie, so I thought it would be cool to have this CD to pop in while we're riding in the car. What I did not know is that I would become a huge fan of this album. Since we've seen the movie so many times, I can just listen to a track and immediately picture the scene from the movie. 'Forbidden Friendship' is one of the more touching tracks, while 'This is Berk' immediately projects images of the ocean waves crashing against the rocks as the camera zooms in on the ocean/cliff-side village while Jay Baruchel announces \\"This, is Berk\\" at the opening of the movie. My son squeals in delight every time I put the CD in and this track begins to play. My wife has enjoyed listening to this album when she is driving our son as well, which says a lot since she is not a big music listener to begin with. John Powell really outdid himself with this one, and has gained at least a few new fans in the process.<br /><br />If you liked the movie at all and you've landed here reading this review, then I would wholeheartedly recommend this album. If my son is any indication, the kids will enjoy this companion to the movie as well.
080214473X|4.0|I think what I like best about this book is that it's unflinching. There are no attempts here to whitewash the grit, the gore, and, at times, the outright incompetency of the men involved in the Battle of the Black Sea. But, at the same time, this is unabashedly a story of common men thrust into an uncommon situation that forced them to bend, break, or rise with the courage necessary to save not just themselves but also their comrades. Definitely necessary reading for any student of military activity, particularly modern warfare.
B003R0MEZ4|5.0|The DVD set arrived quickly and in very good shape.  None of the DVDs are scratched or damaged. I am and have always been extremely pleased.
0525478817|5.0|is so beautifully heartbreakingly perfect. i didnt think anything would ever match or exceed the masterpiece that is looking for alaska but this book is amazing
B001AQR3JY|5.0|This is classic must have movie that I watched when I was younger. I purchased this movie for my 4yr old daughter so she could experience the love I have for the movie. I think I watch it more for me :-)
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is super fun and challenging! it can be frustrating having to unlock each game though. I definitely recommend this app!!!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I attend a bilingual church, so the English and Japanese bibles that I downloaded comes in handy. Some versions have an audio Bible so you can listen to it on-the- go (like during your commute in the car). I would have given a 5 star if you could download all the versions. I couldn't download my favorite NIV version.
B001GQSY5K|5.0|I had caught an episode or two of the Clone Wars on tv over the years and always told myself I would catch the whole thing if I could.  Well I read that this was the movie that kicked off the cartoon series and picked it up.<br /><br />It came with a Clone Wars comic book in full color along with the movie.  The book was shrink wrapped to the outside of the box.  It is the same dimensions of the DVD case and as thick or a little thicker.  Very well drawn and a neat story.<br /><br />The movie was fun to watch.  I saw every Star Wars movie in the theater from the beginning, yeah I am that old.  I played with all the toys, and I even teared up a little when R2 hit the screen in the Phantom Menace and it had been 20 years since I had seen him on the large screen.  But I don't know what planet wookies are from off the top of my head.  I just like Star Wars but I don't know all the history.<br /><br />I loved this movie and purchased Season 1 to follow up the movie.  The movie has a lot of familar faces and some new ones that were really cool.  Was really well drawn in a Samurai Jack style but not so outlandish, and the story was real smooth and fun to watch even for an old guy like me.<br /><br />If you enjoy Star Wars and want a little Jedi action, get this movie and enjoy it.  Looking forward to watching Season one this weekend and after that will purchase the other seasons most likely if they keep up like the movie did.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app. I have been using it for some time on my aneroid phone. Now, I have installed it on my new Kindle fire I received from my wife for Christmas and am even more impressed.  Its the best!!!
B005XT10YS|5.0|This was a random pick for me, I had no idea who was in this movie or what it was about, but I'm glad I saw it.  If ever anyone had a basis to complain about our justice system it would be the woman in this film.  And luckily after this incredible mess, civilians were no longer tried in a military court.  I really enjoyed this movie, and learned a lot.  The acting was well done, and although the character at the center of the movie is considered a traitor, you can't help but feel sorry for her.  Robin Wright did an excellent job.  I highly recommend this film.  If you're a history buff you will truly enjoy it.  I took the time after watching the film to read up about this incident and found the film to be very true to history (what a concept).  Let freedom ring!
B006GG1KOC|5.0|I thought this game was pretty good. I would deffinately let my nephew play this when he gets a little older. five stars, deffinately

B004HZ76FQ|5.0|This has been a very fun and challenging game to play. When I get time to play a game, this is the one I usually play and I have had it for months. They have continued to add new features to the game as well.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Could be used as a monitor to control computer usage, perhaps spy on your kid's lol.  Item is a terrific app I would recommend to anybody. Who knew even activating the Dvd drive we could start a movie from our Kindle Fires and watch and listen from another room.

B002BJGYTY|5.0|Have been watching this show for years. Was grateful to find it at such a great price. Definitely going to be investing in the remaining seasons in the future.
B0063IH60K|4.0|It works as advertised but the full screen apps are somewhat annoying. Fortunately you only get the ads after starting a new game so they don't detract from game play.

B005HQ5S3G|5.0|I have followed Kelly Clarkson's music and career from her American Idol days. In reading some other reviews here, I'm still surprised that die-hard Kelly fans don't all love this record. The first few songs are her best, to date, in my opinion. Mister Know it all appears, in lyrics, to be a slap in the face to that old record exec who reportedly didn't like My December as a record release and tried to put the skids on her career a few years back. Love the lyrics!<br /><br />Stronger is, as they say, her best with her trademark killer dramatic chorus. I love Dark Side, as the lyrics seem to mirror her life and path to this point. Who of us wouldn't have developed a dark side after what she's been thru?<br /><br />Guess I could keep extolling the individual virtues of each song, even thought there are two I don't as much for care for (the country duet with Jason Aldean, which seems odd on this record although her harmony is brilliant; the bluesy \\"why don't you try\\"..) but you should buy this CD or download it here and listen for yourself. I don't think you'll be disappointed!<br /><br />Honest.
030788743X|5.0|Ready Player One is what Neal Stephenson or William Gibson might read before bed. It's a lighter version of a scary techo-future where, with the real world in shambles, escape to some form of cyberspace or virtual reality is the preferred means of human interaction and entertainment. The storyline is reminiscent of Stephenson's Snow Crash, and the author of Ready Player One (Cline) acknowledges his debt to Stephenson and others. (It's a theme that likely goes back to Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451, maybe even further.)<br /><br />The joy of Ready Player One is in its recombination of 1980s pop culture into a treasure hunt in a massive virtual world where knowledge of 80s video games (Atari, Infocom, and all those quarter swallowing arcade games) as well as table top games like Dungeons and Dragons, mixed in with all manner of 80s pop cultural references (music from Rush!) make for a heady geek mix, and such knowledge is required in order to save the world from the clutches of bad guys and an evil corporation. It's juvenile for sure, but wonderfully so--just like the 80s itself. Cline's readers who actually grew up in the 80s will eat this book up like a Pillsbury Toaster Strudel. It's a fast read, sugary with geek nostalgia, and isn't bogged down with heavy plot or overly developed characters. It's the future we teenage computer geeks imagined when were we alive in the 80s: nerds who programmed their Apple //es and spent weekends rolling dice and collecting imaginary magic swords could one day, using those very skills, save the world, get the girl, and become wealthy in the process.<br /><br />A fun read.
B000HF6ZR0|2.0|Secret government project... leads strange technology... leads to mind control over reality??!?... and that's where things fall apart.  The book actually explains what is going on.  The movie tries to scare you into thinking you understand what's going on.  It gets so bad that at the very end of this 'action flick' they have to spend 5 minutes of seemingly ad-lib'd dialog just to arrive at the same plot point as the book.  Fail.  Just in case you were wondering, the book was written by Michael Crichton.  That's the same author who penned Jurassic Park, and look how that movie turned out!  $$$ must have decided this movie.
B000G1ALRK|5.0|I purchased this CD online as a Christmas present for my fiance this year. After having unsuccessfully been able to find and purchase it in a reatil store prior, I turned to Amazon and they did not disappoint! The price was fair and shipping was fast! My fiance loves the CD, as do I. I'm even considering stealing it from him! :)
B005DOKIYG|3.0|The sleeve is nice but when I ordered it I thought it would hold the stylus pen with the Kindle but there is not enough room in the sleeve it is a very tight fit.
B006Z20976|5.0|I watched this film when it first was released in theaters.  It's an incredibly moving story about a police officer who wants to be the father God wants him to be.  As a film major at a Christian university, I've seen many cheap Christian movies that try too hard, and even become too preachy.  This film can appeal to both Christian audiences and secular audiences, and the message sticks.  This movie is also unlike other Christian films in that it is very professional in areas such as acting, directing, writing, editing, etc.  Nothing is cheap.  Sherwood Church has made their best film to date.  It'll take you on an emotional roller coaster, and has the potential to change a whole perspective on fatherhood.
B004LROMSO|3.0|I was looking forward to this series after I saw the trailer because it looked promising.  I like stories about Merlin and King Arthur, etc.  I thought it started out great, but became a little too melodramatic as the episodes went on.  The story differs from the one most of us know.  Some things are the same as in the legend, but they changed other parts of the story.  For example, the character of Merlin is completely different from any I've known.  Joseph Fiennes does a wonderful job playing the part.  His character is intense and tortured, not like the Merlin with the grey hair and the wizard's beard, lol.  I thought Fiennes really stole the show.  It's only my opinion, but the first thing that bothered me was the casting of Guenivere.  To me, the actress who portrayed her looked like a twenty first century super model wearing a medieval costume.  I'm not suggesting that her acting ability is lacking, but I couldn't buy her as Guinevere at all. But that's just my humble opinion, of course.  I won't go on and on about the plot, etc.  I didn't totally dislike the series, but didn't love it either.  I would have probably watched a second season, but there will be none.  The show has been canceled.  Overall, that's not so disappointing.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|in my opining it seems that the games requires a lot of parts from different website which is sometimes difficult
B005I6EU7U|3.0|It's fancy and fun. However for the price I feel there is better out there. It holds the kindle snug, however the case doesn't sit flat when closed. Not a Terrible product, defiantly fancy. Just not something i'd recommend for 40 bucks.
B004T5K3OK|5.0|I'm actually pretty amazed how much I use this app.  I'm not considering buying a desktop scanner any longer, and I'd recommend that you try this out.
B000002UAI|5.0|I say \\"five\\" to include George Martin, truly the fifth Beatle, for without his genious, the Beatles would never have been as wonderful as they were. The cd is, of course, simply fab!
0060872675|5.0|Not too long ago, one of my sisters was visiting my home and asked for a book to read to her children at bedtime.  Where's My Cow? is the book she ended up with, and she later told me that her children thought it was the strangest book they had ever read.  For someone that's never read any of Terry's Discworld novels, this book will make very little sense.  But for those of us who know and love Sam Vimes, it's a private joke between friends.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is an awesome app I love it plus my 11year old niece is in love with it and will never give me my kindle back
B0054JZC6E|4.0|not a bad game for free. some of the games are cheesy and the controls don't always work like they should. I keep playing so they did something right.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|It's kinds tricky to get some of the games. You have to play games to get games. I guess it keeps you motivated, but it can get annoying if you are low on points. :))
B0000TG9E2|5.0|It is almost unbelievable, but a cursory reading of some of the reviews would suggest that some Amazon customers have not read, or even heard of, the Lewis Carroll classics \\"Alice Through The Looking Glass\\" and \\"Alice In Wonderland.\\"  This film is one of the most mature and thoughtful of all Disney films, and manages to capture some of the dreamy, frightening, enchanting and nightmarish atmosphere of the books. Alice is a children's story in name only: it is best described as a semi-benign nightmare of epic proportions.  Alice's chase down the rabbit hole leads to her encounters with many odd characters culled from both books, from Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee to the Walrus and the Carpenter to the Cheshire Cat and the Caterpillar. Much has been made of the caterpillar with the hookah, not without some justification, one feels, and likewise the Cheshire Cat - all very surreal and distant. When Alice grows very quickly after eating the biscuit, the next 10 minutes of images are beyond all doubt of an extremely lewd nature, and once you have grasped this it becomes very obvious. I am astonished that Disney got away with it as it is so blatant, but it is charmingly done ..... I have always thought this but have seen it suggested elsewhere in print only recently.  The music in the DVD is very good and the voices are just superb. Alice's precise, confused, petulant and adolescent nature is well-captured by the ever-excellent Kathryn Beaumont. Disney Stalwart Pat O'Malley sings and acts his way through the film in superb form (T Dum and T Dee, Walrus and Carpenter)and Sterling Holloway is as classy as ever. Songs that really work are \\"Unbirthday\\" \\"Painting the Roses Red\\" \\"Father William\\" and many others.  Highly recommended, and any film that has one Dink Trout as the King of Hearts gets my vote. Probably the closest Disney ever came to getting the right \\"feel\\" to a film and in places this is actually pretty subversive. Watch it again with a very open mind .............. twee it ain't.
B000VIRD6U|5.0|I bought this movie on Blu Ray as it is one of my favorite movies.  I have a Playstation 3 and I cannot watch the movie properly because I cannot turn off the Director's commentary.  I have read about other's not being able to turn on Picture in Picture.  The issues are apparently all on Sony players.  20th Century Fox is aware of the problem and has corrected copies.  I called them, they were incredibly curteous and are replacing mine.  Call them at 888-223-4369.

140004281X|5.0|These stories are so unassuming, so. . ., well, I don't want to say ordinary, so let's say quotidian.  You don't realize how they are affecting you, until you finish them, and everything that has filled you up leaves you.  Through the simplest words and action, she creates something so vivid and relatable.  I can see why she's so famous.  I loved the stories about Juliet.  (CHANCE, SOON, SILENCE). The first story (RUNAWAY) was great as well.  I was totally thrown on any motivations of the characters.  She gave you just enough to try and figure everything out.  Such subtlety is appreciated.  Also, PASSION, was wonderful.  The plot was a shocker, but the motivations, one's ability to act impulsively, in a dream-like state almost, was captured here.  We have all certainly had inexplicable moments such as these.  I think my favorite, plotwise, was \\"Tricks\\", seeing as I'm simultaneously reading Stephen King's THE DARK HALF.  All in all---really wonderful stuff.  I read this collection because I was so moved by THE LOVE OF A GOOD WOMAN.  I'm adding something else to my list to read right now.
B003XNTTYY|2.0|When I read book #1 I was pleased to have found a fantasy book I enjoyed. In my experience there is long between good fantasy books/series. Having just finished reading this book, however, I feel disappointed. Disappointed because it feels like the author don't trust me to have good memory, so it repeats and repeats and repeats. Quite annoying, and I feel this is becomming very common, at least in this genre. And Vin, our beloved mistborn, goes on and on about her not being worthy enough of her beloved. Apart from that, it is a good book #2, with a good story. But I won't buy the next book.

1595826971|5.0|The imagery in this book is stunning, from the different versions of Alice as she was conceived to the dark and threatening landscapes and dreamscapes.  The pictorial content reveals the process that lies behind the development of a concept to final artwork.  Every page is thorough and consistently unbelievable.  I am an artist and illustrator, I bought this book to add to my studio library, hopefully spark some new ideas.  It is worlds beyond what I expected.  Dark, intelligent, disturbing, wonderfully nightmarish, and inspiring, this book is a must have for video game designers, illustrators, painters, digital artists, and anyone who appreciates art with a dark side.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|do you think they should lower the score and make more games and somethink new like double.xp. for a certain amount
B003X8597A|4.0|Good quality of dvd, two discs, very good tenor, orchestra and chorus from Berlin Opera. Unhappily the modern staging, as in use these days, with tasteless associations from recent history, does not reflect the real sense of the libretto.

0553386794|5.0|I really do not understand all the negative reviews, I get that this genre isn't everybody's cup o tea, but GRRM has really created a masterpiece and introduced some much-needed maturity into a genre normally written for geeked-out teens.<br /><br />I confess, I never heard of this series until a freind mentioned the HBO show.  I was leary from the get-go..... However, my wife bought me the first novel for the holidays and I cannot put it down.  It is wholly addicting...my nighttime crack.<br /><br />To address some of the negative comments:<br />1.  This is adult fantasy.  The characters are real people; they all have flaws, vices, and make mistakes. They act like they are human, rather than simply a plot device.  If you want to read about the handsome knight in shinning armour, go elsewhere.<br /><br />2.  The world of this series, although fantasy, is grounded in reality in that it is dirty, gritty and unfair.  I again applaud GRRM for being brave enough to bring this kind of \\"realism\\" into fantasy. This series is often compared to Tolkiens LOTR; but I don't think it is a fair comparison.  In retrospect, Middle Earth seems very quaint.  To make a Star Wars comparison:  LOTR is the equivlent of the sanitized \\"bar\\" in Attack of the Clones.  This series is the smoky, dirty, violent cantina in Star Wars.<br /><br />3.  Yes, there is more than 1 sex scene.  If that bothers you more than decapitating a horse, you have your own issues.  I do not beleive the sex is gratuitious; rather, it is just one example of injecting realism into the series.  Lets face it, people have sex.  1000s of years ago when life was short, cruel, and brutish, they probably had a lot more sex than today.  People do all kinds of dumb things for love/lust and use sex for power.  This series reflects that.<br /><br />4.  The series is written in 3rd person limited POV, meaning each chapter is told from the perspective of a single character.  We get to hop inside his or her head for a while and find out why they tick, before moving on to someone else.  IMHO, this brings so much more depth to the characters than 1st person or 3rd person omniscient, and really allows the story to treat the characters as flawed individuals, who react in very understable, human ways, once we know what motivates them.  Also, people need to remember this book is the first in an epic saga.  Much of the author's task is to introduce the reader to this new world he created.  By jumping around, the reader feels as though Westeros is an actual place and that it is much bigger than the story being told.<br /><br />Bottom line:  Do you like tales of revenge, passion, intrigue, murder, betrayal, mystery, magic, surprise, swords and suits of armour.  If so, you will love this series.IMHO, this brings so much more depth to the characters than 1st person or 3rd person omniscient, and really allows the story to treat the characters as flawed individuals, who react in very understable, human ways, once we know what motivates them.

B000002C2E|5.0|Bob Dylan is known to admire the work of Herman Melville. `Time out of Mind' is a quotation from `Moby Dick' meaning `from time immemorial' or `as long as anyone can remember.' This 1997 Grammy-winner marks something of a landmark for Dylan in its recognition of the approach of old age. Full of poignant and intelligent song-writing, it marks the initiation of a mature creative period which found further expression in `Love and Theft' and `Modern Times'. Many people proclaim this as Dylan's best-ever album, and from the perspective that it gets deeper into your soul with each repeated listening, they might be right.<br /><br />Deeply personal and serious in tone, the album at the same time sidesteps the label of `introspection', nor is it `downbeat' or bleak. Dylan has the rare ability to stand apart from himself, to see his experiences from outside and deliver poignant, fly-on-the-wall observations which can cut the listener to the soul. As he's matured as an artist, this characteristic has matured with him to the point where he is the undisputed master of the craft.<br /><br />The musical style is classic Zimmerman, mostly rock-and-roll bluesy with an upbeat jauntiness in no way out of place with the subject matter. Dylan's voice ain't what it used to be in terms of vocal power, but makes up in gravitas and confidence what it now lacks in youthful range. Phrasing and delivery are textbook examples of relaxed and laconic excellence; he's at home in his chosen idiom as is a fish in water.<br /><br />Dylan's poetic song lyrics over his 50-year career are some of the best ever written. TooM is the real deal, the real Bob Dylan - perhaps for the first time since `Blood on the Tracks' the songs have an uncompromising personal honesty. Here's a telling verse from the closer, `Highlands':<br /><br />\\"The sun is beginning to shine on me<br />But it's not like the sun that used to be<br />The party's over and there's less and less to say<br />I got new eyes<br />Everything looks far away...\\"<br /><br />`Time out of Mind' is an album which could not have been made by a young man, and not by any product of the 21st century's sales-and-image driven global music business. Only a master of his craft, confronting mortality and looking back on a lifetime tinged with regret, could produce a masterpiece like this.ooks far away...\\"<br /><br />`Time out of Mind' is an album which could not have been made by a young man, and not by any product of the 21st century's sales-and-image driven global music business.

B00005NI5Y|4.0|Sandwiched between the 1997 Grammy-winning `Time out of Mind' and the equally excellent `Modern Times' in 2006, \\"Love and Theft\\" (the album's title is intentionally in quotes) was famously released to the world on 11th September 2001, its launch understandably eclipsed by other news of the day. This album is therefore central to Dylan's impressive late-in-life canon of work as a mature artist.<br /><br />L&T paints on a broad canvas the varied colors of rock and roll, slow blues and R&B, bluegrass, rockabilly and country styles; it's an odyssey through American folk styles and as great as anything Dylan has produced in a long career of outstanding creativity.<br /><br />With a trademark-ironic quip, Dylan himself said of the album \\"I think of it as a `Greatest Hits' album - without the hits\\". As so often with Dylan this throw-away line conceals a hidden truth: many of the songs are sing-able and get the feet tapping. Lyrically, these slice-of-life stories in the great American folk tradition sound bang up-to-date: is this why his music never seems to age?<br /><br />It's hard to pick out individual songs in a collection so universally excellent, but \\"Mississippi\\" (an unused leftover from the `Time out of Mind' sessions re-recorded for L&T) has a rare repeat-play-please poignancy and was described by Rolling Stone as \\"A drifter's love song that seems to sum up Dylan's entire career, a rambling classic that ranks up there with `Tangled up in Blue'.\\"<br /><br />Bob Dylan shows no sign of going off the boil with age, or of hanging up his guitar. He really is truly the heir to his teenage idol Woody Guthrie, yet has reached global audiences Guthrie could never hope for. His uniqueness is in his refusal to be pigeionholed or typecast and he is, and always has been, his own man with his own unique vision and style. He is in some ways his own genre, all by himself. Long may he thrive.
B004V5QWU2|5.0|love love love this. it is perfect. helps me fall asleep so fast. its amazing. the sounds are so real.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|We got this by \\"accident\\" from Netflix and the reviews there made me worried that it would be a cheesy animal rights movie.  Far from it!  This is the best movie I've seen in years with good acting all around and a fascinating look at the life of an autistic young woman.  Good art enables us to experience a bit of something that we might not experience otherwise and that is just what this movie does.  Its clean and I think conveys good lessons for kids; one reference to sexuality when \\"experts\\" think Temple may be self soothing sexually but it's pretty subtle and unfounded. I'm having my kids watch it.  Ages 7-13 are very interested though they have lots of questions and the music/filming style make it tense enough that they need reassurance sometimes.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|fun for hours. great for kids and for adults. also a wonderful variety of games and for the most competitive sorts.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This app.is terrific! It will keep you going for hours. If you are a fan of solitaire you will be in heaven, if you are new the game, be prepared to be hooked. instantly.
B004EPZ0BG|5.0|I really enjoyed this.  I think Timberlake is so funny and good in this film. Mia was great too, they absolutely compliment each other. Woody Harrelson was funny, he played the role perfectly, as he always does.  Thanks
B0025X4OYI|5.0|This is a great Ray Charles album. It doesn't really sound or feel like country at all. It's definitely in Ray's great jazzy style.
B001I0T92Q|5.0|This is the genuine cr-5400 this is also the one you want, works perfectly in the psp 2000 sometimes will not format in psp 1000 but that is no issue works perfectly reads as fast as micro sd card that you choose to use, keeps up perfectly. Comes in nice genuine package has serial numbers that are real not fake. Thin be careful with this. I have 2 of these one I got from china and this one is better. Things people want to know.
B005WMQ5R8|4.0|as other reviews have said this is pure, through and through anime.  they hit every aspect of anime from the over the top characters, insane technology, huge monsters, big lasers, and even threw in a little bit of the \\"girly\\" anime features for good measure.  if you have a good home theater the audio track on this disc really shines.  i was pleasantly surprised by how well it was put together and how good it sounded.  add to that the great animation style and this is a good show.  someone that doesnt like or appreciate anime wont dig this show at all, so if thats you just bypass it.

B002KSPKRS|4.0|I just recently started playing MW3 with my friends on XBOX, I always just played Madden lol. I decided to get a headset because my friends raved on how great they were. I decided to buy 3 headsets and test them out, here is my reviews of them;<br /><br />TRITTON AX 720<br />My first impression when putting on this headset was that it was way too heavy for my liking, much heavier than the X31 or X41 headsets. Also it fit way too tight, the amount of pressure it put on my head gave me a headache after 10 minutes. After hooking it all up, I realized the ONLY thing in existence with more cables than this device is a server room, the amount of cables this thing has is obnoxious. I fired it up and played some MW2, the \\"360 3D Fake Surround Sound\\" was HORRIBLE. The audio quality itself was far inferior (to my ears) than the X41. I used this headset for maybe 30 minutes before I realize it just wasn't good at all (to me) and boxed it and set it aside for return.<br /><br />PROS:<br />Honestly can't think of ANY.<br /><br />CONS:<br />1) Heavy<br />2) Horrible Audio Quality<br />3) Too many cables/wires<br />4) Fake 3D Surround Sound<br /><br />TURTLE BEACH X31<br />My first impression when putting on this headset on was that it was light, yay. I went to hook it up and shortly realized it used RCA jacks from 1940's and not a Digital Optical Cable. I went to hook up my RCA's in my XBOX and realize that I cannot have an HDMI cable and the RCA's in the XBOX at the same time due to the XBOX connector... WOW WHAT A FAILBOAT. Now I could buy an adapter and solve this problem, but why do I need to spend more money? I never got it hooked up, so I couldn't tell how good/bad the audio was. I immediately boxed it and set it aside for return.<br /><br />PROS:<br />1) Light<br />2) Looks Decent<br />3) Cheap on AMAZON.com<br />4) Wireless<br /><br />CONS:<br />1) RCA/Analog<br />2) No Digital Opitcal In/Out<br />3) Need Adapter if you want to use HDMI w/ XBOX<br />4) No Surround Sound<br /><br />TURTLE BEACH X41<br />My first impression of this headset, was that it was light weight, felt good and was SUPER comfortable on my head and ears. It didn't give me a headache at all. I played with this headset for an easy 8+ hrs over the span of a week and the audio and surround sound was awesome. Audio clarity was amazing and had me really into the game. After a day or two, out of no where I got some interference (not sure from what), it was annoying but it only lasted like 10-20 seconds and hasn't come back since. I do also notice the \\"white noise/hiss\\" but this isn't due to quality of the headset, its the actual XBOX LIVE when there is dead air, this IS NOT the headsets fault so this isn't a con to me. Overall I really like and enjoy everything about this headset except for some short and mild interference.<br /><br />PROS:<br />1) Light<br />2) Looks Decent<br />3) Cheap on AMAZON.com<br />4) Wireless<br />5) Amazing Sound<br />6) Surround Sound WORKS!<br /><br />CONS:<br />1) Some mild interference occurred once<br />2) Takes 2-AAA Batteries to save weighton my head and ears.

B002MXA7TC|5.0|So I knew nothing about this group until I heard Sweet Disposition in a diet coke commercial... ever since then I have been hooked on this band. I was even more surprised that their album (at least for me) had no bad/mediocre songs that I had to get used to. The entire album is worth purchasing and not just one or two of the hit singles that you may have heard about.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|some issues with sharing on multiple devices and login periodically doesn't work BUT only bible app I use and the beat I've found
B005QI4TP8|5.0|Fantastic CD!! Florence delivers amazing lyrics and vocals. If you like her Lungs cd, you will like this album. The art work is great as well.
0553386794|5.0|Fantastic Book! George Martin develops a world, characters, and nation truly on par with Tolkien, but slightly more mundane (at least in the first book).<br /><br />The turns of phrase and cultural development for his characters are the best I have read since Tolkien bar none.<br /><br />This was the first book of Martin's I read, and am looking forward to the next in the series.<br /><br />Eoghan Odinsson, Award Winning Author of \\"Northern Lore: A Field Guide To The Northern Mind, Body & Spirit\\"

B002ZG981E|5.0|This movie will have you thinking! It's defiantly a trippy movie. I have not regretted buying with movie at all. I first saw this movie in theaters and had to watch it again and again.
0670020745|5.0|In \\"My Stroke of Insight\\", Jill Bolte Taylor shares her personal experience through intellectual argument that will spark any curious mind interested in the processes of the brain, the brain's physiology, and the way we perceive and sense the environment.  The information in this book is both subjective and scientific and is presented in an intriguing and informative manner.  If you haven't given it a read, get a copy ASAP!  Also, I highly recommend seeing her TED talk if you haven't already done so!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Loved this book. Chris Kyle is a true Texan with a no BS sense about him. That is how he told his story. Awesome read. You won't be able to put it down.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|My Kindle Fire is about two days old and I knew I needed a case. This case is probably one of the best. It was cheap, but not made cheap. I love the stand even more and it seems that in the event I dropped it, it would protect the Kindle Fire. Easily the best choice.
B0063GORYU|5.0|addicting! you'll love this game. great way to kill time. the only problem is that you find you've spent longer playing this game than you meant too. other than that I have nothing bad to say.
B0006J28BO|5.0|The movie is enjoyable for all families!  My sister (the grown-up) don't like family show but she is a cat person and this movie is accepable to her!  I enjoy the production making of this movie and an all languages.  Too bad there no spanish language to share with families that don't understand english, Japanese, and french.
B00406UK7S|3.0|...and isn't that what an action/epic film should be? Sometimes I tire of armchair critics who hold a directors feet to the fire simply based on historical inaccuracies. Gladiator was chock full and I loved that film, in my humble opinion I think this is a fine work for Marshall,and I am a big fan of the Descent AND Dog Soldiers. Implausibilities aside, the film to me was vastly superior to the bigger budget and seemingly more popular The Eagle with (ho hum) Channing Tatum in the lead role. Decent enough film, I just enjoyed Centurion much,much more. I am reasonably sure that anyone who dug Braveheart (and that movie was RIDDLED with historical inaccuracies) will find Centurion to be a great Saturday afternoon or evening popcorn muncher,capable acting,good story and chock full o action. Dont listen to the nerdy historian haters or the armchair directors who think they can do it better,just watch,and enjoy. I did.
B003AQBYUG|5.0|The first thing I want to say is that you shouldn't be afraid to purchase this if you live in the United States. I have an LG BD570 and a PS3 and both play this without issue. I was a little scared at first but I'm glad I got this one. At the time I got a much better deal on this set over the non-import set. The movies are also remade in excellent quality over what I remember seeing as a kid. I mostly wanted Aliens but the whole anthology was a bonus at the price. Basically $15 more for three more movies and a lot of special features. It also looks great in my collection. If you've been waiting to grab Aliens on blu-ray like I was, I'd say grab this set.
B004BSFC6Y|2.0|Super cute and the baby was definitely intrigued by them, BUT they have such little stretch that they barely fit a 4 month old! Very tight.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this Bible. very convenient. I can understand it very well. and the best part is when you are studying the Bible you can look up different translation.
B002UXRGM0|5.0|Quite possibly the best series of nature documentaries ever made. Easily the best footage ever taken of life on this planet. They appear to shoot almost every scene with high speed cameras, the colors and lightning are mind blowingly vibrant. A brilliant musical score. And to top it all off, its narrated by David Attenborough. He is a famous naturalist who is speaking about his life's passion. I can't believe the BBC allowed the US version to change narrators. Go check out the reviews for the Oprah Winfrey Narrated version of this, its hilarious. These Disc are Region 2, which is Europe disc, they played fine in my US bought Sony Blu Ray player.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is soo fun.  I love it its amazing!  :) you should really get it!  you can play it at any time and anywhere ! I think its better for the kindle fire because the pictures bigger but that's my opinion.  well anyway you should really get itttttt!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game it is the best best best best best best best best best best best bes game ever.
B0053TMP24|4.0|I gave 4 stars because I know I will enjoy it, but I am disappointed that the Kindle version cost more than the paper-back version.  What gives?  Kill trees, make ink, print, ship, storage, and then mail, and it is more costly than a soft-copy that is e-mailed?!!!  And Kindle has the nerve to compare the its price to the hard copy and claim there is still a savings being made.  I just had to get that off my chest since I want to upgrade to the Fire, but when I see paper version costing less, and with reviews of less editing errors, it makes me wonder if Kindle's only benefit is being able to carry multiple books without a back-pack.
B0055SWM08|5.0|so very addicting! Also very frustrating when you are completely lost but then that music just relaxes all the frustrations away. I will be letting everyone I know, know about the game!
B0063GORYU|5.0|I have enjoyed this game for hours upon hours. I would recommend it to anyone who likes card games. Great for wait times!
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I LOVE this app.  I use it everyday.  It is perfect for shopping lists, doctor apts., birthdays, etc.  I recomend it highly

B005ZUR724|5.0|kindle fire. smooth. awesome graphics. I have YET to see this &quot;update glitch&quot; worth the price. you get 6 months free. then its 2 or 3 dollars for another 6 months. THIS IS A REAL MMO. VERY BIG (for a tablet) keep in mind...you are not playing this on a Pc.
0439023521|1.0|Poorly written; weak plot; boring details about supply inventories; J.K. Rowling wannabe cooking up  creatures like \\"muttations\\" and \\"tracker jackers\\", and somewhat \\"magical\\" potions with instant healing powers make for a waste of time of a book. If you really want to read something about survival, read \\"The Road\\". If it's really kids killing each other that you're looking for, read the good old classic \\"Lord of the Flies\\". At least you'll find emotion, true terror, and messages about society and humanity in those two novels. You'll find none of those in The Hunger Games, a truly vapid tome.
1589944607|4.0|Those were my thoughts when I first saw it, and those were my thoughts as I sat there looking at the board getting ready to play my first game. Those were NOT my thoughts by the end.<br /><br />First and foremost, if you have seen the show, then you HAVE to play this game. You will be trusting no one for most of the game, and by the time the cylons are revealed you'll be running for your life. Every Crisis card brings a feeling of impending doom. The table talk for this game is like no other. It will bring even the best of friends to the the edge of throwing fists.<br /><br />Once again I cannot recommend it enough, however be prepared there is a learning curve. I highly recommend having a experienced player go through it the first time with you, because if you don't you will probably get jaded. One last thought, if you are a bad liar don't play this game :)<br /><br />Frakkin' Cylons!
B0016MJ6HY|3.0|Nice story, a bit different.  Nora Jones acted well for a singer. It's basically a \\"chick movie\\".  My daughter liked it more than I did. Natalie Portman was excellent in a different type of role for her.
145162445X|1.0|After \\"reading this book (one of many on the topic of the universe that I have tried valiantly to understand) I have come to the regrettable but firm conclusion that the often touted notion that a book on cosmology is readily comprehensible by any intelligent lay reader, is a myth! Lots of luck if you think otherwise --- maybe I'm just stupid!
B004XNGKBS|5.0|I bought this app to take handwritten notes in my college class as well as just to jot down random notes on my new kindle fire. This app is exactly what I need!  Pros: automatically adjusts writing to fit in line with type, but this can be turned off in the pen settings; can be exported via email; integrates text and handwritten notes into on page; many pen and writing options; simple to start up; it works really well with my amazon basics stylus  con: only exported as .png, so it can only be emailed instead of exported to applications like box.net  This app does everything I need it to and more. I recommend this app to anyone needing an simple app that still offers a variety of options.
B002Q4U9YU|1.0|I was under the impression that this CD was from the movie score.  The music from the movie has nothing to do with this CD.  All Sony did was re-rip songs from past albums and added a few more extras which corresponded with the movie.  Don't get me wrong, I am a Michael Jackson fan but I feel Sony ripped me off.
0142001104|5.0|I've read a few other personal growth / self-help books... This one is not only my favorite personal growth book, but my favorite book period. I was just what I needed when I ordered it, and I knew it would be good because I was familiar with Benjamin Zander from TED, but I didn't realize how perfectly it would align with my current goals and thoughts. I'm sure the 100+ other reviews can tell you about the content of the book, so I'm just going to use this review to explain the scope of how much I love this book. I have many times read a book and thought it was full of quotable moments, but then they didn't sound good out of context... this book is the exception. I actually took a piece of cardboard, wrote \\"The Art of Possibility\\" in the center, and made a quote collage (so many quotes it would take me at LEAST five minutes to read them all aloud). Now I don't have to go to the book every time, but can just read from my wall among the nuggets of truth any time I need inspiration! I also plan on turning that into a spoken word quote collage to share at open mics and tell people to go read this book!  The whole thing is fantastic! And refreshingly honest.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its okay not the best thing ive ever played but its also not the worst broseph I would recommend it if you are bored

B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I'm an ambitious writer. I write all day, every day. Writing helps me in nearly all aspects of life. So when I received my Kindle Fire for Christmas I began searching for applications that would be FREE and be similar to Microsoft Word&trade; or Pages&trade;. Originally, there were many different 'note taking' applications before I came upon this one. Most were especially confusing, difficult, and quite limited. However, Evernote hit all of the targets. In the beginning I wanted and Word type of an app, but Evermore, though is considered a note taker, can easily be used for short stories, writing books, poems, you name it. Its pain-free, user friendly interface allowed me to continue writing my book. It was quite simple actually. I would write a chapter or two and save it. By accessing the Evernote nonlinear access, I could copy and paste the writing into my official document creating program, and ham, it worked. Also, there's an application function that allows you to send the writing via email or other installed applications. This feature I especially liked.<br /><br />All in all, one should consider Evernote. It's simple yet sophisticated. It's more than a note taking application, it lets you write what you want, how you want, and access it wherever you want. Go ahead. Try it yourself. You won't be disappointed.

0553381687|4.0|Game of Thrones centers on the power pulpit of the Iron Throne and the households/kingdoms that King Robert Baratheon and his wife, Queen Cersei Lannister command. Things are well and good between the various households, but it doesn't stay that way for long. In a land where summers last decades and winters last lifetimes, trouble is brewing and the Stark family is right in the middle of it. In addition to treachery, deceit, and bloodshed between warring households, there is another element to worry very deeply about - what lies beyond The Wall protecting the Northern and Southern lands. As winter returns so do the things that go bump in the night and supernatural/dark forces that were only a part of scary children's stories, begin to become all too real to the inhabitants of the Northern and Southern households. Dark times are coming for everyone and the reader is sucked in by just who will be left when it's all said and done?<br /><br />Several years ago, I gave up on two books (Dune and Game of Thrones) and missed out on great series due to thinking they were just too complex and wordy. Now after reading this book (in addition to re-reading and completing Dune), I can say that I definitely appreciate it that much more a 2nd time around. While reading a Game of Thrones, the biggest thing is to not get frustrated/bogged down with all the characters, descriptions and side-stories. You do need to know who's who and where palces are, but don't let that ruin the enjoyment of the book for you. What helped me out a lot was finally watching the immensely popular HBO series with the same name and then I started to pick the book back up and was amazed how much the TV series helped my imagination/understanding out. It might not work for everyone. At the end of the day, you might still decide Game of Thrones just isn't your cup of tea... but at least give the TV series a shot and then go back and tackle this book! Just some advice from one formerly confused reader to another! :)<br /><br />Overall Martin does a really good job developing characters you either love or hate as well as developing the overall plot and plots within plots element of Game of Thrones. ***very small spoiler***Perhaps the most interesting bit of all is that this was really the first book that isn't shy about killing off it's main characters. I guess I've been sheltered throughout my reading career in that the author has never had the guts to do such a thing consistently, but Martin does it in abundance and pulls no punches in this book. At first it was shocking, but then I realized it really made the book that much better.  Admittedly,  Game of Thrones is a little wordy at times and probably 300 or so pages bigger than your average novel in a series, but it's well-worth the read if you have patience and get through the 1st book. The ending is well-done in that it's not quite a cliffhanger, but it makes you think \\"wow, I really want to know how all these ends are going to tie together in the next book!\\":)<br /><br />Overall Martin does a really good job developing characters you either love or hate as well as developing the overall plot and plots within plots element of Game of Thrones. ***very small spoiler***Perhaps the most interesting bit of all is that this was really the first book that isn't shy about killing off it's main characters.

0525423656|3.0|I was so disappointed! I know sequels rarely live up to the first book, but I loved MATCHED. This one, we'll this one was painfully s......l......o......w!  It took days to get through just the first half, compared to flying through all of MATCHED in one day.<br /><br />I know CROSSED (Matched #2) is a bridge book and they usually suffer the most in a trilogy, but I just had a really hard time with the books pacing, especially at the beginning. Although I like the perspective from both Ky and Cassia point of view, their actual stories were kind of a snooze fest. Why so monotonous?...Why so boring??  Remember at the end of book one Ky is taken away to the Outer Provinces. So this one starts with him trying to survive there, literally, but it's a lot of tell not show for me. And now with Ky being sent away, Cassia risks everything to search for him. Unfortunately, neither story captivated me. Lacking excitement and action (and interest) until the couple meets up again. Another big disappointment was the lack of Xander's presence. He is barely in the book and we don't really get to know much more about The Society.<br /><br />What we do get in CROSSED is a deeper understanding what made Ky, Ky and more information about the Anomalies, Aberrations, Farmers and the Archivists and a promise of what's to come with The Rising; which for the most part was pretty interesting.<br /><br />In the end, CROSSED pulled through and I liked it, but I really hope that the third book gets back into the vibe of MATCHED, which was a fantastic and gripping read.

0062101897|5.0|This is really an excellent book! I saw it in a bookstore at the first time and it attracted me immediately. I love to see the pictures and details out of the screen. It will provide me more chances to know HP's world better. I really love it!

B0053O89WY|5.0|[[ASIN:B000W91RUG The Big Bang Theory: The Complete First Season]] is 'Friends' with smart people. That's not a dis on [[ASIN:B000H6SXMY Friends: The Complete Series Collection]]its just a statement.  I am tired of TV that causes your brain cells to die.  I'm tired of fart jokes and booger jokes.  I love watching [[ASIN:B001FB4VXU The Big Bang Theory: The Complete Second Season]] because you have to pay attention to get the jokes.  They use big people words.  They use an adult vocabulary, not a fifth graders.  I've actually had to look words up.  ex. Sheldon asks what it means when a girl wants you to meet her mother. Leonard looks at Sheldon and says ' what would you be if you were an inclined plane wrapped helically around an axis?  response \\"I'm screwed.\\"  My 7th grader had to look it up.  then he fell off his chair laughing, learned a few vocab words and got a new favorite saying.  My mother who is 68 loves it too.  There are quite a few references to sex,so be prepared to discuss some things, but it is addressed far more tastefully than [[ASIN:B00005JOHC Two and a Half Men: The Complete First Season]] or [[ASIN:B002JVWQSW Modern Family: The Complete First Season]].  This is One of my favorite series on TV right now.  Fun for all ages and both sexes and all walks of life.  I also like that they are equal opportunity. They are equally irreverent about scientists, college education, rural upbringing,conservatives, men, women, commitment, survival.  They pick on everyone equally.  Watch [[ASIN:B003L77G6A The Big Bang Theory: The Complete Fourth Season]] soon and often!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Used this app on an earlier phone (before Swype) and really liked it. Now I have Swype and have got comfortable with that. It was a free App of the Day so an easy purchase!
B0057MFA42|1.0|After being out of stock for over a month, it came back in stock. Assuming this was a re-release with the audio issues fixed I ordered it.<br /><br />Nope, same thing. Will be sending back. The fact they are actually still shipping these to stores with this obvious defect is insane.
B002BWP49C|1.0|Whata waste of two hours. Slow story, predictable plot, and generaly all around waste of time. The first movies were stellar by comparison.  It took two hours of a slow story for a marriage...wake me when this one is over.
B0051O8Z66|3.0|The packaging isn't great, especially the artwork on the CDs themselves.  The second CD is mostly songs that aren't that great.  I got it because I wanted more songs than just the \\"Progress\\" version, but after buying it and listening to it I realized I only like a few of the songs that much anyway, such as The Flood, Happy Now, and Kidz.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Fun games, definitely an excellent waste of time. I'm sure I will be spending a lot of time playing it at work and at home.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This game is an updated and simplified clone of the original missile command for the Atari. I thoroughly enjoy using the touch screen to launch missiles and like the auditory cues for the missiles as well as the rumble when a building id hit. It is a perfect waiting room game and keeps getting more challenging every wave, which is complimented by the upgrade system. The only thing I dislike is the font used. The font would look better if it were Arial or sans serif in my opinion.
B005COO1X6|4.0|The only complaint I can have about this is it ended too soon. More Kindle Singles would be awesome; some of us can manage to treat ourselves once in a while when it's a Kindle Single sort of price.
B0050SYS5A|5.0|Our Xbox in a confined space, so this has helped with the Kinnect games-Now we have room for active play. For the price, it has been great!
B004TI5N38|1.0|I have about three of David Baldacci's efforts under my belt. I now realize each of those has left me wishing I had not gone to all the effort. This one meandered on and on, reached a sort of nutty conclusion, then continued meandering.  I long for an Amazon enhancement where a big gong would sound if you start to buy an author who you can set as \\"Holy Cow, never read THIS guy again!\\" You know, something loud enough to rattle the glass on your iPad.  Maybe that's an idea for a great new money-saving app?  I grew up in a military family, so there is no bias here against this Green Beret-ish semi-military \\"thriller,\\" set today but in backwoods America, supposedly high tech (good try, David), and mixing in several throwaway plot twists explained later as coy subterfuges by the villains. One included a special delivery letter maybe, just maybe, consumed by the barkless dog of a murdered family. (By the end I really didn't care.)  I better stop now before I start meandering... Did I mention that he meanders a lot?
B004USLWVE|5.0|I very much feel that my camera equipment is safe in here. It has plenty of space for a dSLR with a grip and all my lenses, flash, and \\"junk\\" (blower, white balance card, etc.). It does have a laptop sleeve, but don't try to use this as a briefcase like I do. The bag only has enough space for my laptop. There's not even room for a thin three-ring binder. Great purchase. I'm happy with it.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|This movie powerfully depicts the plight of black people in the US a few decades ago, from the perspective of domestic help in the southern US.  Given that the movie is based on a novel, there's no doubt that many things have been romanticized, but there's also no doubt that the movie reveals much truth and isn't simply fantasy.  The depiction is effective because the story flows well, the characters make sense (even when stereotyped), and the acting is superbly nuanced across the entire cast.  This is a movie that can make your eyes well with tears, and perhaps that says it all.  Highly recommended and, no, not just for chicks.
B0017JKEL8|5.0|This was a gift for my brother in-law, and he enjoyed it very much. We love the MadMen series and hope to eventually own all of the seasons. It arrived on time and was packaged well.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|Best way to end the day...you can follow along while the actor reads to you. There's many plans to choose from that will allow you to finish reading the Bible all the way through in a year.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Can't ask for more in a Bible app- lots of translations, reading plans and more. I haven't even explored all the features yet, but I have no complaints! :-)
B003V9OCIS|5.0|This was action filled and full of love. Will watch this again. I don't usually like subtitles, but the drama was good.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|just what I needed.synced with tootle before I was even done setting up.  I wanted to sync my outlook calender and this app works for me.  I have the google sync app on my computer to sync my outlook calendar to tootle and this syncs with google. couldn't be happier
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Bought for my wife for Christmas. Lets' just say she is very happy with the Fire. Addcited as well. When she lets me use I enjoy it too. Nothing bad to say about the Kindle Fire.
B00009PBRP|1.0|I would have liked to have known, when I first purchased these 2 video's, that they couldn't even be watched in the area where I live, and I'm not moving to Europe just to see them.  I believe the seller should have given this information out in the very beginning, but did not. Now I have the hassle of returning them and trying to get the mess straightened out. I won't be ordering from them again.I love ordering item's from Amazon, but when I see this other name come up on my search for dvd's, it will be a red flag for me!
B004RSCX0G|3.0|Sound on the vinyl LP is poor - sounds as if I'm listening to it through a pair of mud-caked headphones. So much for audiophile-quality vinyl - not on this album.
1451627289|4.0|Mostly a highly engaging read, although the relationship between George and Sadie ends up dominating the prose too much for my liking, a bit like a guitar solo that goes on too long in the middle of an otherwise very tight song.  Anyway, despite the flaws I couldn't help thinking at the end that King had touched on some very profound, philosophical type life questions, all pertaining to the desire to control life, and the past in particular.
B006DRVFRQ|3.0|This app has a clean, intuitive interface which I love.  Unfortunately, offline reading does not cache images.  The app does note that offline reading is in Beta, but without this feature, I may as well just access Google Reader on the web.  I'm currently using NewsRob on my Kindle Fire (a friend downloaded it for me from Android Marketplace), but I was hoping to replace it with a Fire app.  EasyRSS works well, but the interface paradigm of pulling up/down to go to the next article annoys me.
B004LUS390|3.0|Works wonderful on the kindle fire.  My biggest complaint is how images are exported.  They are small, low quality images.  I love this program and use it all the time.  But until the issue is resolved where I can export high quality full sized images, I can only give 3 stars.
B0063GORYU|4.0|It is bit hard to get the cards to go where I am trying to drag them to. I like the number of setting available.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have been using this app for over a year now and am very happy with it. You can navigate quickly to any book, chapter, or verse that you want. It also has really good devotionals and reading plans.
B00479SVBU|5.0|This thing works great! I'm going to buy a second one for my other car. I don't use the SD Card option so I can't comment on that but the sound comes through on the FM station very clear.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|But still awesome!!! I'm a lifelong fan of Stephen King. I love his horror novels, but when I saw this one I was reluctant to read it. My mother bought it for me as a present as she was reading it and loved it. Once I started to read I couldn't put it down. Even though it's not usual Stephen King, I think it's one of his best. I couldn't believe how well-researched it was and the story is amazing. I found the political history as interesting as the story about Jake Epping, the main character. Highly recommended!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Using the one year reading plan, I have gained consistency in my time in the Word and learned more about the character of God. This app has really been a blessing to me.
B0031ES8P6|3.0|Although the size is smaller than the specifications, the cute factor makes up for it. It will be a good gift for kids and girlfriends at an amazing price. I didn't buy directly from Amazon so you guys  should try that and see if it comes in the right size. It's still a good deal in my opinion.
B004EBZX6W|1.0|I don't believe the added information or graphs that you get with this product is any more useful than the Wi-Fi information I already have on my kindle product.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I found this to be a lot more accurate than things like the weather channel or the weather forecast online at MSN.
B00000DHR0|5.0|Special for dark december evenings a comforting album.  But if take the time to listen to it on other ocassions, you will  find it is a really good work of art.  It feels like taking a warm bath.
1439102813|3.0|I found this book interesting but it took me a while to read it as I kept running into passages that made me wonder about myself.  I think this book is very good for caregivers and for people under 60 - but it does put a lot of self doubt in the minds of those who are older.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|Love this book! Very well written. Very suspenseful . Kept me wanting more.  I love how the author changed it from feeling like it was goin to be a love story to a thriller/suspense novel. Would recommend to everyone.
B0002A2WDQ|5.0|Who needs many words to describe a great old Daniel Webster battle with the devil. I got to say it is the best rendition of this age old classic, not to be missed. The music was fantastic. Plus Tuvack was great
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was the best one. I cried, I laughed, I felt the pain. I love this book. It really mademe feel things for each character.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|it didn't make any sense don't waste you time. The games were stupid and I don't mean to be rude but.....
B003OPUZYY|5.0|This 3 CD collection contains five albums from Ten Years After's best period 1969-1972. Also included are single versions of some of the songs. The four albums \\"Shhh,\\" \\"Cricklewood Green\\", \\"Watt\\" and \\"A Space in Time\\" are each classics and should still be able to inspire and excite listeners here more than forty years later. On \\"Rock & Roll Music To The World\\" it seems like steam and inspiration are becoming exhausted, but even this album does contain fine songs such as \\"Religion\\" and \\"Convention Prevention\\".<br /><br />The booklet is somewhat stripped down and does not contain more than what may be required as minimum.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|the game is fun at the becoming, but it is hard to continue to unlock more of the games.  overall it is fun.  I'm just writing this to get free coins to unlock more games

B004EFYZ1C|5.0|this app is just awesome, love to take a look at this all the time&amp; works great on my kindle fire
B004XN3FHA|5.0|This is an incredibly bright and long running flashlight! Perfect for power outages because unlike li-ion batteries that need to be stored at 40% capacity in the refrigerator to stop it's aging process, this flashlight uses my rechargeable AA batteries which should also be stored in the refrigerator but at 100% charge so i can just pull them out and use them if the lights go out!  I have the FENIX TK35 also and this flashlight is even longer throwing than it! Just a GREAT light! I will be getting another one!  The TK 41 is a little smaller than a 2C Maglite but is SOOOOOO much brighter!  Even brighter than my Streamlight Ultra Stinger TOO!  AMAZING AMAZING LIGHT!
0307595579|5.0|This is a great read, one of the best books I have read this year. I recommend this book highly. I have just completed Stieg Larsson's second book \\"The Girl who played with Fire\\" and I believe this book is even better than his first. I am really looking forward to reading his third book \\"The Girl who kicked the Hornet's Nest\\" which I will begin today.
B001L1S1SK|5.0|This is one of the darker most heartfelt seasons out of the four in my opinion.  The usual drama and scheming, but also some friends and loves lost.  As a Detty fan though, not really one of my favorite seasons due to the lack of Detty time, but as far as storylines are concerned in general, great quality as usual.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|great old fashion game. great on kindle fire and can be played without wi-fi connection. this is a good time filler
B004T0E2S8|5.0|I know the reason for confusion over the favorites. I was bummed when I couldn't figure it out, but it does work. You have to click around on the bottom and it pops up on the right side. Good luck.
B0025KVLTC|5.0|This recording is great!  I love hearing my old favorites in the remastered format.  Revolver will give Beatle fans lots and lots of listening pleasure.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|It's a fun game, but there's no option to close the app. You have to use a task killer to force close it.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Great app, love the setting options. It allows me to accept a challenging game or make it really easy when I simply want a no brainer!
0756404738|2.0|I´m just going to go to the point.  This book for me is just the exact following in writing style as the first. I had hopes that all the bad things about the previous book would be upgraded: pages and pages of really nothing going on, almost no action scenes or real suspense of any kind, something interesting to know about Denna or something of value to happen with her and Kvothe, something more about the Chandrian, etc  All these just keep happening. Annoying. But I kept on reading, because it was not boring, although I wanted more, MORE, to happen. Mr. Rothfuss really engages you! but I just wonder at how much would he do this, if he just told us more of what we really want to know!  I felt dissapointed when I finished it, but at least I did not drop it.  About a month has passed since I finished it and I´m really NOT missing the story, nor Kvothe or any other character (who could that be?) in any particular way. Not what has happened with many other sequels. I guess this tells me I´m not really into the book.  To anyone who didn´t like part 1, I seriosuly don´t recommed part 2. I read it because of other good reviews out there, some pretty clear on it, but I disagree. So...........be warned........
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is great to play when killing time. It is perefect for commercial breaks, and waiting rooms. The games are quick and some are challenging.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is great I really liked it. so far I am trying to get all the games.y'all should give it a try
B0010X745K|5.0|I adore Stephen King books and I consider \\"Mist\\" as one of his masterpieces but to my great surprise and delight this adaptation by Frank Darabont actually IMPROVED the original story! And this is not an easy thing to improve the work of such a master! In fact many Stephen King works (including masterpieces) were wrecked once filmed (just consider the horrible fate of \\"Pet Sematary\\" or \\"Children of the Corn\\") - well not this time ladies and gentlemen! Here we have a work on the same level as in \\"Shawshank redemption\\" and \\"Green mile\\", which is only normal considering that Frank Darabont directed those movies too.<br /><br />I do not want to provide spoilers, but simply by looking at the cover of the DVD you already know that the mist is the key element of this story, and that the action will mostly take place in a supermarket - and also that for the people trapped inside, leaving the said supermarket is not really an option, because of the above mentioned mist... The rest is for you to discover...<br /><br />Any Constant Reader of Stephen King will probably howl with delight during the first scene of this movie - I certainly did! Also please do not miss the title of the newspaper one of the customers is reading in the waiting line in the supermarket just at the beginning of the movie - it is a very pleasant joke addressed to Constant Readers..)) I liked it very much.<br /><br />However the jokes and delights will end quickly. This is a VERY tough and extremely dark horror movie, with a great lot of death and suffering - including many of the most likable characters! And after all this comes the ending, which is as shocking as the crucial moments in \\"Seven\\" and \\"Shutter Island\\". It WILL shock you and probably hurt you - so beware and in fact if you feel a little bit down or vulnerable, you should absolutely postpone watching \\"The mist\\" until a better moment! That is a serious warning - please do not take it lightly!<br /><br />King's short story \\"The mist\\" had some elements which I always considered as weak spots and didn't like (although I absolutely love the whole story) and Frank Darabont made the choice of not correcting them, to stay faithful to the original text. I think he made a honorable choice, although King's obvious dislike of US armed forces is the only weak spot in this otherwise extraordinary story - me for one I simply refuse to believe that in a situation of extreme danger for civilians, highly trained professional soldiers (all volunteers!) who swore a solemn oath to protect the citizens of their republic from any danger, just abandon helpless women and children and choose the cowards way out! But this is just one minor glitch and after all stranger things happen...<br /><br />Frank Darabont changed however the original story by developing more the character of \\"the enemy inside\\" and especially by extending the story beyond the original ending, which was already shocking, but finally left the final fate of the heroes a mystery... In the movie there is a real ending and it is a very surprising and extremely painful one - it is even more horrible than any ending in Stephen King's books! But I believe this is a necessary thing, because this achieves the lesson we learn - and this movie in my perception is a very Christian one, unlike the original story. And here are the Christian teachings which I identified in \\"The mist\\":<br /><br />1) \\"Beware of false prophets who are like wolves coming dressed in sheep skins\\" (beginning and middle of the movie)<br />2) \\"Thou shalt never deliver God's children in sacrifice to Moloch!!\\" (second part of the movie)<br />3) The suicide is a deadly sin!!<br /><br />and last but not least!<br /><br />4) Hope is a major Christian virtue - so if you abandon yourself to despair, beware, because this is even worse than sin - IT IS AN ERROR!!<br /><br />This movie shocked me horribly but also made me think a lot and I count it as one of the best modern horror films and one of the finest cinematographic adaptations of Stephen King prose. I recommend it greatly - to buy, watch and keep!inematographic adaptations of Stephen King prose. I recommend it greatly - to buy, watch and keep!

0545265355|5.0|I was skeptical when I heard these books were written for young adults, but I read the books anyway.  I absolutely love them and could not put them down.  It has spread through our office and now everyone is reading them.  I only wish they continued the story longer.  Can't wait to see the movie!
B000H6SXMY|3.0|I ordered this product brand new and received it with the clear packaging still on (or so I thought). However, I have duplicate copies of Disc 17 and am completely missing Disc 18. So I'm a little skeptical that I actually got a brand new product like it was advertised.

B0056BMK6K|4.0|In this book you learn the overall strategy that John Locke uses to sell an outrageous amount of eBooks.  Sure, the book has a bit of hype and fluff but that's just good marketing, in my opinion. And in that regard, Locke minces no words: He's a businessman and marketer first and foremost, and that's how he approached writing. And look what he has to show for it.  Instead of writing any old story and seeing if anyone will like it, Locke recommends that you approach your literary career like a good marketer: Find an audience, find out what they like, create it, get them into it, and give them more.  Some people criticize this book for being nothing more than \\"social media 101,\\" but it's a bit more than that as it covers the entire process of coming up with what to write to promoting it and building a following (which is where the social media comes in). The fact that the strategies taught ARE simple is good, I think, as it's easy to get overwhelmed when you start looking into how you can promote books on the Internet.  All in all, this is a great buy and I'm glad Mr. Locke wrote it.
B000HT3P7E|5.0|How I Met Your Mother is one of those shows that remains funny no matter how many times you see it. Trust me when I say this because I've seen this season 10+ times, and continue to rewatch it to this day.<br /><br />I'm often asked what it is about HIMYM that makes me love it so much and the answer invariably comes back as \\"the cast.\\" Everything about this group of characters is perfect. I see Marshall and Ted together and they genuinely act like friends that have been together for years. I look at Marshall and Lily and find myself wanting a relationship like their's. I see Barney and believe he really is this womanizing suit lover. I see Robin and I actually do see a person obssessed with her job. The creators did a phenominal job casting this show and episode after episode proves it.<br /><br />There are many ways of describing the type of show HIMYM is. It is a comedy. It does have some very tender moments. It is wacky at times. Those things are true. But there's an intangible that this show has that others lack...heart. I haven't cared about a group of characters this much since Scrubs. I constantly find myself comparing my group of friends to HIMYM's. I watch this show because it portrays events in life we all go through in a relateable way. In a way that isn't forced to be funny.<br /><br />Season one introduces us to the characters. We see Marshall propose to Lily in the very first episode. We see Ted profess his love for Robin on their first date. We see Barney...well...be Barney. As the series goes on it only picks up steam and gets better. It's as if the creators knew they had to make us care about the cast, and once they did that, they ran with it. We really want to see Ted find his soulmate because he is such a good guy. Yet, when everything ultimately fails, we still care. And when he does the rain dance on the roof to try and get Robin, we root for him. When Lily leaves Marshall and Ted finds him sitting on the front steps holding the ring, your heart breaks for him.<br /><br />Season one is a great season with tons of memorable episodes, a season that lays groundwork for the show to only get better. With one of the best casts on TV, HIMYM is must watch TV.s a great season with tons of memorable episodes, a season that lays groundwork for the show to only get better.

B0031RAOVY|5.0|I am a dog lover from way back, (72 Years Old).  This movie is the greatest movie I have ever seen.  I watched it twice and cried more the second time than I did the first.  I also have seen the Japanese version and it is great too.  I cried just as much.  I cannot bring myself to watch it again because I cry at the beginning because I know what is coming up next.  I loved the movie so much I was going to buy an Akita. The place where I inquired about a puppy happened to be the breeder whose dog appeared in the movie and his brother was the sire of the litter he has for sale.  Unfortunately the breed would not mix well with what I had so I didn't purchase.

0545265355|5.0|I purchased The Hunger Games Trilogy Box set for my stepdaughter (who is 17, soon 18) for Christmas.  She isn't a big reader, but she has already read two of the three.  She can't wait for the movie to come out.  Then we can go together and watch it.  What was a gamble of a gift has turned out to be a safe bet!  And PS I loved these books!
B004Z4LVZK|4.0|A work friend of mine was the first to read it and while she liked it, she was also not sure just exactly how much enthusiasm she had for it.  The story kept her interested, there were plenty of contemplantive-whats-gonna-happen-now moments and she liked the characters, but the writing was just not grabbing her.  I began to read it after she started the second in the series, The Scorch Trials, I came to the same assessment.  Writing style is huge for me and it just wasn't there for me.  Upon further discussion we felt that maybe it was because this was obviously more of a boys book; written by a man with the main character as a teenage boy.<br /><br />All of that being said, the end of the book really had me pulled in.  I finally felt connected to the characters, the action was beginning to reveal main points in the story, and the writing was picking up.  Don't get me wrong, the entire story had me thinking about it during my non-reading time and I wanted to keep reading once I started, but till the end I never felt that \\"I need to lock myself in a room so no one disturbs me/I have to jump up and down cause it's all to much for me\\" feeling that I so commonly get with my reading fixations.<br /><br />I am currently beginning The Scorch Trials and I defiantly have the feeling that makes you squeal-inside because-you-are-so-nervous-and-curious-and-scared-all-at-the-same-time, right off the bat.  I will have to keep you posted, but my feeling is that everyone may need to read The Maze Runner so they are able to understand The Scorch Trials.
B001CDLAT4|5.0|\\"Baraka\\" means \\"blessing,\\" and each of the scenes in this movie aims to show the huge variety of life and its rhythm on earth. From the opening shot of a monkey in a waterfall, to acts of prayer, to chicks in factories, to African dance, to Japanese theater, Baraka sweeps slowly, inexorably through small pieces of the human experience. It is a stunningly beautiful movie, sometimes fast and sometimes slow, ever changing, never the same--like life. Fans of Koyaanisqatsi will recognize director Ron Fricke's cinematographic style. This is not at all a plot-driven movie--watch it if you are looking for an experience.

B004I2K4DY|5.0|For quite a few years now I have been totally hooked on the production Les Miserables. My first exposure to the story was through the VHS non-musical version. However, when I learned that there was a musical version I was ecstatic!! I love music and I love Les Miserables. Since that first taste of this great production, I have heard/watched several different versions of this production and I can say without the shadow of a doubt that the 25th Anniversary Performance cast at the O2 Arena is my favorite ever!! Although I would have loved for this performance to include more acting I feel as though this allows the cast to highlight their musical talents and forces them to be more expressive with their faces.<br />If you love great music and fabulous acting. I highly recommend Victor Hugo's wonderful production Les Miserables, particularly the 25th Anniversary performance at the 02 Arena!
0307891372|5.0|This is a must have book if you want to really get to know and understand the game because there were many times I was stuck or missed something that was unclear in the short quest descriptions. They only downside for me with it is the small print with them trying to cram so much information into it and still keep it a manageable size book.

0345529057|4.0|George R.R. Martin's a Song of Fire and Ice series is one of the best I've read. This particular set of books as it's positives and negatives. They are nice because they are very compact for the length of the books (most around 900 pages, yet I can still fit the one I'm reading in my purse). The downside to their compact size is that they are printed in very small font, I have a hard time reading them in my contacts. The maps and family linages are included in this book set, even with their smaller size. The small font size is coupled with small margins. When I first began the series in these books, I was annoyed that I had to bend the binding so far out to read the rest of the sentences. The bindings on the books are holding up pretty well for how much wear they are getting.  The \\"box\\" (more like card stock) that the set of books came in fell apart as I was trying to remove the first book from the set, so I threw it out. The picture on the front of the box is the only HBO series picture in the set; the books have plain, non-photo covers. The HBO series promotion through the books is just superficial and has little space on the covers or inside the actual books.  Overall, I would recommend this particular set of the first four books of the A Song of Fire and Ice series as a cost effective and compact way to read the books. I would avoid them if you're looking for a high-quality, easy-to-read, HBO-related set. I hope this review helps!

B0052U59F4|5.0|What can I say about Fifty Shades Freed? It was by far one of the best books that I have ever read. Ms. James definitely saved the best for last!<br /><br />This book was witty, humorous, edgy, emotional, and simply amazing! The story picks up immediately after Fifty Shades Darker and we continue to understand Christian and Ana's relationship. Although they are married in this book, their emotional challenges and battle of wills do not cease. They are both strong-willed and dominant. Funny that, because Christian picked Ana to be his submissive in Fifty Shades of Grey. However, Ana has proven to be just as strong, and stronger in many respects, as Christian.<br /><br />The thing I appreciate most about this series is that we can see the evolution of the characters from book one to book three. Ana was quite timid in the first book. But, as we see her in the last book, she is vocal and assertive. She is not to be trifled with and she showed that to Christian's adoring fans and his staff alike. Christian started out as this &uuml;ber Dom who was very interested in the pain and subjugation part of BDSM. He liked control. And Ana tested and blew his control to smithereens. It was so touching to see that although he was so strong, controlled, and successive that he was an insecure lost boy who needed love. Ana willingly and whole-heartedly provided him with that love.<br /><br />As with her other books, I appreciate how Ms. James integrated the secondary characters in the story. Their interactions with Christian and Ana were not arbitrary but they flowed in a way that was interesting and unique. All of the character dynamics were interesting and complex in a way that the reader was immediately engaged and pulled into the story. This book was filled with so many twists and turns that I cannot and will not name them all. It kept me on the edge of my seat. And, although this book was the longest in the series, I read it in one day. I just couldn't put it down. It was a captivating and engaging page-turner.<br /><br />Ms. James has grown to be one of my most favorite authors because of her unique writing style. I am sorry to see the end of the series. And I hope that this is not the last that we have heard from Ms. James. I am very eager to see what she does next. She has definitely set a very high bar for herself and others.<br /><br />Once again, BRAVO Ms. James!Ms. James has grown to be one of my most favorite authors because of her unique writing style. I am sorry to see the end of the series. And I hope that this is not the last that we have heard from Ms. James. I am very eager to see what she does next.

1400052181|5.0|You don't need to be interest in history, African American history, or biology to enjoy reading this book. I found myself glued to the book. Rebecca Skloot did an amazing job of creating the most comprehensive history on Henrietta Lacks and HeLa. The book evoked such emotion from me learning about the history of her family and the circumstances that came to be. It really puts things into perspective of how far we have come and how much farther we have to go. This book really touches your heart and gives you so much information that it is simply astounding on the quality.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|its chess and its free works well on the kindle fire. great way to pass the time, set the level too your skill level and have at it. thanks
0525478817|5.0|When I got the book in the mail I literally sat down and read it the whole way through in 6 hours (minus a bathroom break and dinner). I laughed, I teared up, and I really did relate. I'm 23 now, but when I was 20 I was diagnosed with cervical cancer and I remembering being one of those deep minds trapped in a teenage body. This spoke to me all many levels of my human experience so far.  This is really one of the most enjoyable books (not just cancer book) that I have ever read. I whole heartily recommend this book, or at least give it a shot and see if you like it. As per the overflowing amount of 5 star reviews show, it is a worthwhile book regardless if you are a young adult, affected by cancer, or a brooding individual.
B006WPSQVC|5.0|I just watched this movie with my wife and children and must say this was far better than 95% of the movies coming out of hollywood with big-named actors/actresses and well known directors.  There is a large population that will avoid this movie due to the religious overtone, but this movie really hits home with the responsibilities of a parent, especially fathers.  It is an incredible movie about forgiveness, about making the right decision even when its a difficult one, and about picking up the broken pieces and finding the purpose hidden somewhere in between.  I would totally encourage anyone to watch this movie whether or not you are religious...you won't be disappointed.  The 5 star ratings this movie has been getting is not because it is all church goers trying to push this movie...it is really that good.  I love a great action movie with a good message and good acting.  This one definitely hits the target right from the first 30 seconds of the movie.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Completely Awesome... Read it, speaks for itself... And MOST of ALL, Believe... Once you begin, allow the overall healing of the Lord to take charge of your life, if you have'nt already. Give a little time each day to pray, everyone should. Our children are the future, let us give to them this world and let's try to make it a better place... PEACE...

B003Y5HWJU|4.0|Just watched the first 2 discs of the series. Loved the actual show, but the extra features are extremely limited, other than the commentaries. But what really drove me crazy was having to watch over five minutes of HBO previews on the first disc without any opt-out allowed. I should not be forced to sit through their advertisements before I am allowed to watch the show I purchased. I was considering adding HBO to my cable subscription, but not after this.

B0062KJ1Q6|3.0|It's worth the $1-2 rental for a little entertainment.  There are some parts that are pretty funny and I enjoyed myself through most of the movie.  Don't expect too much from it, just have fun.  It's just a cookie cutter formula movie - nothing to really separate the movie from other so-so comedies.  My review might sound negative but it really is just trying to set your expectations properly.
B004J4WKTW|3.0|The Night Circus was interesting. I found myself getting absorbed in the characters. The plot was a little weak, but mysterious. You kind of know what was going to happen -- the inevitable -- but the journey from the start to finish wasn't all that predictable.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Pretty great game. Fun and love the features! Great for killing time. :) Like the set up, except when the screen rotates, but not a big deal. Great app!
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I loved this book! I don't know why, exactly, but I couldn't put it down. There wasn't a dull moment and several plot twists I did not see coming. Even though the plot was completely implausible, I was so absorbed in their world that I actually forgot that there really aren't supernatural children in the real world. It was so normal, but not. As I said, it's really hard to explain, but I loved it.

1250004217|5.0|Sarah's Key by Tatiana de Rosnay was set in Europe. Its settings were in Paris, France in July 1942 and in Paris, France May 2002. Sarah's Key surrounds the general notion of what happened in July 16, 1942 in the great roundup at the Veldrome d' Hiver. It was located in a famous indoor stadium where biking races were held. In 1942 thousands of Jewish families were locked up for days, then sent to Auschwitz to be gassed. It was at the time when the French police, not the Nazis were the ones who arrested all the Jewish families.   In Sarah's Key we were introduced to two characters, the first character being ten-year-old Sarah. Sarah and her family were one of the victims of the Vel d' Hiv. She, wanting to protect her brother, locked him in the cupboard and locked it, then carried the key in her pocket the whole way, thinking that later she would be able to retrieve him. Then there's Julia, a woman who had to write an article on the event in 1942. She discovers Sarah and her family and on the way Julia researches and finds out more about how she and her family relate to Sarah. It leads her to discover herself and think about her life as she goes through a difficult situation, and the situation leads her to make changes in her life that just doesn't affect her but also other people that she loves,   The message Sarah's Key gives us is to never really forget the past. It thought us that by introducing us to two different times when in one the Vel d' Hiv was going on and Jewish families were being executed by the French police. It teaches us to not forget the past because after the event happened, years later the author took us to the year 2002 when the sixteenth commemoration was being celebrated, and it was evident that in that year no one paid attention to what had happened and many people weren't aware that that was going on in their time. That's why the message in Sarah's Key is important because it's best if you don't forget such tragic event's that happened in thepast because you never know how important that moment was.   I believe Sarah's Key differs from all the other books I have read. Unlike other books this book has two related stories that help us understand more of the past to connect with the present that was then. I would recommend this book because it has different qualities that make the story interesting. I think that Sarah's Key is really good, it has a good storyline, contains some sad moments but it has events that keep us interested and wanting to turn the page. It is a book that would very well keep everyone entertained and reading till the end.
B004EPYZPS|5.0|This is classic Steven Spielberg in action.  Although he didn't direct it, he may as well have.  He did produce it and it shows.  It's got the essence of early 80's films like \\"Goonies\\", \\"Batteries Not Included\\" and \\"E.T.\\"  There is a spectacular action sequence involving a train and a bunch of kids who seem to be on to the fact that there is a lot more going on in the town they're living in than any of the adults are aware of.  A group of kids set out to shoot a little horror film so that they can submit it to a Film Festival, but they end up capturing more than they bargained for setting them up on a fast paced thrill ride that turns their town upside down.  Some intense moments that may be too much for young kids, but for the rest of the family this is a joy.
B004Z4LYU2|5.0|String theory, Not.  Since I picked up Hawking's A Brief History, I have been looking for a book to continue the story of how humanity as a whole understands the Cosmos, which fundamentally, is a question of \\"what is space and time?\\" and \\"what is the mechanism behind the phenomenon of gravitation?\\"  Smolin starts with a great overview of how our understanding of the cosmos has improved since Einstein - especially in the field of particle physics. In recalling the recent developments since particle physics, he admits that virtually no significant breakthrough of our understanding of physics has occurred as astronomical observations continue to collect data, which obviates the need for a new unified theory of gravity.  The core of his frustration is not directed at other physicists who specialize in String Theory but the way the current academic culture does not allow young students to question the assumption of their predecessors. His main point is that, for the past two decades, this culture stagnated young physicists' ability to use their creative and imaginative curiosity to explore various possible ways to explain the same phenomenon of gravity and spacetime.  Though he touches just briefly the psychosocial background of Einstein's time, I can't help but draw the parallel between other examples he gives of \\"outsiders\\" and Einstein, the latter of whom had difficulty obtaining an academic position, an lucky misfortune, which allowed him to think outside of his own contemporary physics dogma at the turn of the 20th century.  Taking this idea further, Smolin asserts that new breakthrough theories might come not from academic groups but from creative and independent thinkers outside of the established academic discipline of physics. Another parallel, if I may humbly, is the example of Grigori Perelman - an independent Russian scholar who turned the world upside down with his solution to Poincare conjecture and turned away from the academic world at the dishonesty he perceived.  Perhaps stranger-than-fiction is the connection between Susskind (Smolin's opponent) and Yau, who in the respective fields of quantum gravity and mathematics hold high distinctions. Susskind is one of the leading string theorists, and Yau of the infamous Calabi-Yau manifold. I do not remember reading about Perelman's story in the Trouble, but Smolin's insider-secret of the physics academia had me revisit the whole Perelman-Yau controversy.  --  Ok, that's fine and dandy. We hate politics of any kind. How does this book help me learn about the world and function in as a better person?  To put this into perspective of our living world, the year 2011 turned the world upside-down by the upheaval of masses to challenge the status quo as information becomes more and more transparent in the unsustainable philosophy in the areas of politics and economy.  Though I try to distance myself from the pop-spiritualism with all its \\"Age of Aquarius\\" nonsense, 2012 actually does appear to be a good candidate for a \\"miracle\\" year for physics as well as other fields of human activity. This year may be when we, as individuals, feel the large-scale events of technical singularity unfold.  This year, the world of physics just might be surprised by an obscure yet brilliantly creative mind that brings us to a new era of understanding of our cosmos - and teach us an important lesson in the way we should support the brilliant minds of our future.  I'm waiting for a Gregori Perelman of the physics world to submit his landmark article on arXiv with my fingers crossed.
B005VT42BS|5.0|it's really nice app. i prevented some hacks in my home wifi zone! it shows a lot of useful data
B005FITIGO|2.0|It's hard to be sure, but the extremely elliptical dialog here was probably the result of the script writer(s)not really knowing enough about this very complicated subject to say much more about it than they said.  The actors had very little to work with; they tried hard, but seemed mostly at a loss as to how to proceed. Some variation in the swearing might have helped; these young men would certainly have had bigger arsenals of curses. Jeremy Irons had the longest speeches, if one could call them that, but he's been hamming it up for so long now that he can chew the scenery without saying a word, and he did that too.  A viewer whose taste I respect has praised this film, but that can only be his reaction to the appalling situation that it attempts unsuccessfully to explain, rather than any merits of the film itself. I was looking forward to this one and had hoped to learn from it, or at least be entertained. It was a big disappointment.

B0068RHGJM|4.0|I am not going to write a detailed song-by-song analysis of the new Nightwish album, since it has been done more than adequately in other reviews. I would simply like to state the obvious, and hope future reviews will avoid further beating the dead horse.  TARJA IS NO LONGER THE VOCALIST FOR NIGHTWISH. SHE IS NOT COMING BACK.  My opinion is that Nightwish is better off for it. Anette has a different vocal style, which is why DPP and now Imaginaerum are different than previous Nightwish albums. Anette is also more fan friendly and projects the Nightwish sound better than Tarja did.  I live in Texas. The Tarja-fronted Nightwish never played here. In fact, Tarja was too stuck up and haughty to play most of the U.S. on the Once tour. Watch the \\"End of an Era\\" video and you can see the pretentious diva that Tarja had become.  Tuomas is the true genius behind Nightwish. The proof is in the fact that DPP and Imaginaerum have magnificent songs, while Tarja's solo stuff is filled with pretentious glop.  My point is this -- if you want to evaluate Imaginearum, how about basing your rating on the quality of the music and not whether the current singer is better than the past one.  Imaginearum is not a perfect album. It is not as good as DPP. There is nothing as arresting as Whoever Brings The Night or gorgeous as Meadows of Heaven. But it does blow any of Tarja's solo albums out of the water, simply because the songs, production and execution are better.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|For those of you who want the original, unedited trilogy; I'm sorry, you won't find it here. Not only that, but you have to buy three completely worthless movies just to get the ruthlessly edited three good ones. I'm not going to lie, it is still possible to ignore all of the edits and have a good time; the original trilogy is just that good. At this point however, I just don't want to give George Lucas any more money, as the man clearly has no respect for his audience, his critics, or even his coworkers (for those of you who are unaware, one egregious example is the fact that Lucas superimposes prequel trilogy actors into key scenes involving Darth Vader and the Emperor, thus overwriting and erasing the work of the actors who originally played those roles.)

076790592X|4.0|While this wasnt the tear jerker it was alleged to be it was pretty poignant and touching tale of an old man and a younger man, and the things that really matter in life.<br /> Granted I dont tear up at too many books, though just between us the Buffy musical Once More With Feeling can get em flowing from me sometimes... There is just something about the way she is so isolated from her friends though she is always surrounded by them... Maybe I overidentify...<br /> Anyhow, this book is a good reality check for any of us who may tend to get too caught up in the brass ring chasing parts of life...
B006YZHEB8|5.0|This version of this movie is full of powerful information. I love this movie and have watched this movie two or three times in one day and then two are three times again today and I just picked my pre order of this movie up on 1/17/2012)  Great clean family fun! My children love this movie and have asked to watch it every day.  When I purchased this movie I paid for a pre order at our local christian store. At first I did not want to pay $20.00 for this movie because I never pay that much for movies.. But something told me to go ahead a pay for the pre order. Once I did that I was also given a copy of the courageous home DVD which is so awesome. So once I left the store all I could think about was the Courageous movie. I could not wait to get this movie home and watch it. So I had to wait until 1.17.2012 to have this movie in my hands.. It was worth the wait..  The action in this movie is awesome, the inspiration is outstanding, this movie is moving. I love the example the fathers show in this movie. This is a great tool for men.. So that they can see and learn how to protect and serve at home first.. They can see how to guide their families. They can see how to lead their family in prayer and bible study times. I love what the resolution says about men and their wives!  I love Sherwood movies, I love the way they use their congregation also on the set and in the movies.I love how this movie comes together and the church as a whole comes together. I love how they show you how this church stands together in prayers together. This DVD will show you so much behind the scenes information.  Special Features:  The making of Courageous  Commentary by the Kendrick Brothers  Deleted scenes  Outrageous: Outtakes and Bloopers  Courageous in 60 Seconds  Heart of Courageous  The story of my Father  Collector's edition features  Casting crowns \\"courageous music video  A church prayer  The importance of fathers  Role of a lifetime: Rev Daniel Simmons  Mark Willard: ministering through music  Erin Bethea: Serving behind the scenes  Sherwood pictures retrospective  Sherwood volunteers  plus, ministry and resource videos to guide your next steps.  So it was more than worth $20.00! Well back to courageous as I am ready to watch this movie for the fourth time today! Honor really does begin at home! Home is your first ministry! Home is where it really matters!

1619491303|5.0|When I first started this, I had to keep reminding myself that this wasnt a continual rehashing - this is the source of what gets rehashed.<br /><br />Most of the material is at least briefly touched on in Evolution - The Remarkable History of a Scientific Theory by Edward J Lawson, which I read earlier. Further, anyone not from a bible thumping region has probly heard most of this from way back in their schools.<br /><br />I had to keep reminding myself that the fella who wrote this did so over 150 years ago. Clearly he was a genius, and in some areas very thorough in his experiments and testing.<br /><br />Though a few of his ideas have since been disproved, by and large, I dont think there has been to date a more revolutionary scientific tome. This should probly be required reading for everyone. It gets a bit dry and drawn out at times, but overall this is a great work, fair and balanced, and not in that fake Fox News kind of way.
B006646N0U|4.0|It seems like these guys can't miss!  I love the roommate agreement. Just a classic set up device for the comedy of futility.
0143038419|1.0|ug...<br />My girlfriend suggested reading this, as I am personally so well grounded and in touch with reality, she seemed to think it might lend to me some perspective on how other people struggle at times in life...<br /> She thinks because it all comes so easily to me, I need to understand how some people struggle.<br /> I guess this is her idea of an uplifting story of hope and triumph??<br /><br />At times this was witty and funny... Occaisionally it was a tender look into the private moments of the author. Generally it was a long-winded whine fest, about how life is so hard, and the ppor lady telling the tale has no helmet to protect her from it...<br /><br />I dont know why so many people think you need to go to some exotic lacale to find yourself, or to have a spiritual experience, but our girl Liz seems to be one of them.<br /><br />I am appalled to see how she thinks herself to so spiritual while she travels across continents alternately engaging in glutonny, endless self-pity, and eventually takes up with a man old enough to be her daddy, and not in a kinky \\"spank me more daddy\\" kind of way...<br /><br />I would suggest this book to anyone who is :<br /><br />1 - Studying the dichotomy of the self-indulgant<br />2 - A sadist looking to really suffer for a few hours<br />3 - The recently lobotomized looking to drool on something with no value
B0000041Q3|4.0|Even it is used one quality is really good but little late delivery, but deserve to wait :)  Sound and package almost new and good.
1597801585|1.0|I know this is a first novel, and I generally try to be more merciful to a first attempt, than to an author who has a number of previous efforts under their belt...<br /> Still...<br />This is pretty awful. It is kind of a cross between a novel, a bad french foreign film trying to be full of ennui, and much of it seem to be written with stage directions. The voice is not clear, or strong, and it really didnt make me feel anything, except anxious for it to end.<br /> Characters are wooden, 2 dimensional, and seem as disinterested in the story as I was.<br /> There was no direct world building, which can be interesting, depending on how good the author is at getting you to infer what he was tryng to imply. But for me, anyways, this world never really came into clear focus. It was always vague and not interesting.<br /> I will still try Ship Breakers, but I think this book is a miss. I would not recomend it.
1594744769|4.0|It was a very gripping and interesting book. I loved it until the last few pages. I really wish the ending would have been different, it has left me with lot's of questions and wanting more.
0765357151|4.0|With the hype surrounding the release of the film version of this book, I Am Legend - I had to put reading this on hold until I got to see the movie, just in case it stunk and the book was awesome...<br /><br />That said, I enjoyed BOTH the book and the movie, but this may be the rare case where the book was actually NOT AS GOOD as the movie... Ther book was still good, but the movie was better.<br /><br />I would give the movie 5 stars and the book 4.<br />As always, there are some pretty fundamental differences, mostly being that the movie is simplified, as you cant fit everything in a book into a movie. I am Legend had the advantage of being more of a 160 page Novella, than one of them huge 300 - 400 - 500+ page monsters - so it transitioned well to film.<br /><br />So if you have an hour or two to fill, give this one a try...

0440539811|1.0|Why cant O pick zero stars? This was less entertaining than the cereal box - and I havent eaten cereal since I was 12...<br /><br />From the cover and the write-ups on this, I thought this would be right up my alley - quirky / funny / etertaining / etc...<br /><br />After 100 pages I stopped reading - that may not mean much if you dont know me, but I NEVER stop reading. Same thing I do with movies, I ALWAYS see them through to the end. I guess I always figure there could be something at the end to tie it all up, or make it all worthwhile. Seldom happens though (Brown Bunny) but I still keep at it. But not with this nonsensical piece of rubbish.<br /><br />If there was a clear idea or thought stream, I didnt hang around long enough to find out. Think of this as Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas in book form - if that movie was your cup of tea, you might dig it, and I might just be the straight square not willing to drop acid to see the lights ;-)

B005DI97S0|1.0|This is the worst since, and perhaps including the first in this series. A long - boring - trite treatise on religion and the nature of god and the devil, this is full of the kind of whiny self-loathing psuedo - introspective tripe that made the 1st volume so boring.<br /><br />If you liked any other books in this series, and arent too anal retentive to skip one, skip this one, and go on to the next. It cant be worse, and most of the others so far have been better, so....
B003O86FMW|5.0|I read The Hunger Games because I had heard so much about it and it was consistently at the top of the lists. I was disappointed with it though. When the plot was moving slowly, it was moving too slow, when it was moving fast, it was moving too fast. Lets just say I have a lot of complaints about the first book. So much so that I almost didn't continue reading the series, but whats the fun in that, I needed to know what happened in the end.<br /><br />I'm glad I kept reading.<br /><br />Catching Fire - in my opinion - is 10x better than the initial Hunger Games, and I am for sure going to continue reading the last book in the series.<br /><br />One major flaw that I think has been corrected in this book is that it's just overall more intense! There are more surprises, more twists that make it interesting. The Hunger Games moved slow. I wasn't convinced that the Hunger Games was all that bad; even though Katniss is talking about how bad the capitol is you don't really get to see that they're despicable, until now. It's like Collins gave the Capitol a makeover because you get to see how evil they are, and there is now an established enemy (something that you could argue is necessary for a good book). There are moments in the book where something happens that makes you go, \\"oh thats cool\\". [SPOILER] For instance, when Katniss meets the two people in the woods that have a mocking jay on a cracker, that's really the first hint that you get that there is organized rebellion going on. It makes it exciting as a reader to try and put things together and even though you think you have it pretty well figured out there are still twists and turns that you don't see coming, that will keep you glued to the pages for hours, it did me.<br /><br />Good job Suzanne Collins! (applause)
030726999X|3.0|Not as good as the first 2 - but after reading the first 2, you need to read this.<br /><br />Could have been just as good - or a little better - at around half the length.
B005KELS6Q|5.0|Opening this was a delight because the case way exceeded my expectations.<br /><br />It is mostly made of Neoprene--the wet suite material--while the white dotted part is made of smooth shiny rubber.<br />The zipper has no problem closing around the corners.<br />The rubber part is perfectly placed so that it doesn't matter how dirty your hands are holding it, you can always wipe off the dirt.<br />The Neoprene is a light, spongy texture so it protects the Kindle well when/if it falls.<br />The color is probably a little pinker than in the photo.<br /><br />Overall, a great product, and I'd highly recommend it.
0887308589|5.0|I went into this thinking that it was more serious - I have read Adams' \\"Stick to Drawing Comics Monkey Brains\\" and in it we see that Scott is actually a pretty sucessful fella beyond cartooning.<br />So I may have been predisposed to think this was a humorous tome on management and the potential foibles.<br /><br />Instead it was more of a hilarious romp with several anectdotal tales of woe, and the relevant Dilbert cartoons to back them up.<br />The last chapter actually has some solid advice, followed by semi related stories by the lab rats who lived them.<br /><br />I have worked in a cubicle environment for the better (in terms of proportion, not quality) part of the 1990's, and into the early 00's. There is really no feeling quite like seeing in print, Dilbert, Wally and the gang concentrating the real life things you have gone through, into a 3 square joke. It just strikes home and ringns true.<br /><br />I cannot count the times I laughed out loud at something or another in this book. I am sure my already sleeping girlfriend will be glad to see I am done with this, and will not wake her up with my laughing in the middle of the night.<br /><br />If you have ever worked in a medium or larger sized office - READ THIS BOOK!! The resulting hilarity might keep you from showing up to work with a high powered, laser scoped rifle at a later date.
0307959856|2.0|I love Jane Austen and usually stay away from books that are based on her works as they are never as good as the originals. However I made an exception as I had read that PD James is an Austen historian and I usually enjoy James' writing. This was an okay read but very forgettable. I would not purchase it but borrow from a friend or the library if you are really interested.
B0068AWQQ2|2.0|I seen the first one, this could have been better, they left out alot good stuff, it's really not worth the 3.99,
B003VPWXRO|5.0|The thing that struck me most about this book was the down-to-earth tone that de Rossi writes with. She tells her story from an innocent perspective, and it lacks any sort of \\"I'm so special\\" dressing, which will, I think, make it especially accessible to vulnerable populations. Even if you don't have a professional or personal interest in eating disorders, this memoir will resonate with you. Its tone is uplifting while being realistic at the same time. I am so glad I spent $10 on an e-book--something I usually never do. Thanks for writing this, Portia.

0307592839|1.0|I bought this book based on being a pulitzer prize winner.  Ugh.  Even though I am fairly \\"hip\\", this book was incredibly boring.  To identify with the characters, one must be either a 1) indie music fan who is about 40 years old, 2) a person who is not connected to the real world and what is important in life.  Basically a \\"me, me, me\\" L.A. type person who has no connection to the real world.  The style is boring.  The vocabulary is mundane. I felt like I could have written a book just as good as this one (and I am not a good writer). I mean, how the heck did this win an award????????  I couldn't think of one person to give my book to, it's going in the trash!
B00536OCZA|1.0|It was great to see this released on vinyl.  Only problem is, I should have read the reviews before buying it.  Sounds like the master they used to make this was someones old scratched version.  Exchanged it for another, same problem.  Getting a refund.  It's great that Amazon stands behind what they sell.  Don't waste your money on this one. PS - Got Wish You Were Here and it sounds great.

0515142247|5.0|I have read all of Lee Childs Books about Jack Reacher.  I have enjoyed them all.  I have read some twice.  Like going back to an old friend and saying, Hello, entertain me some more with good escapism.&#34;  Jack Reacher is a loner who has been in the military but once out travels by foot (hitch-hiking) or bus, from place to place, mostly in the US of A.  He always finds someone to help--and that makes him a hero, of course, then he goes on his way.  Yet, Reacher has roots with a family history that comes out in this series.  Some people would not find this great literature.  It may not be--but it is always fun to read a Lee Childs book.  I devour them in one to two days.

0525478817|2.0|*Fellow Nerdfighters, please read comments attached to this review as a wonderful and unexpected conversation is unfolding. Cheers, T.W. Williams.  John Green's new book, The Fault in Our Stars, is flawed from start to finish. To begin with, it is about two young people with cancer. If you write a book about two young people with cancer, you have to write a book so good that it never relies on the reader's sympathy and compassion to excuse otherwise mediocre writing. In this he fails. The main characters are just too quick, too deep, too intellectual, and honestly, too John Green. It reminds me of watching new Woody Allen movies and seeing Allen's worn out old rants coming out of a new young actor's mouth. John Green's characters are starting to do this same disembodied authorial ventriloquism.  Now maybe this doesn't sound so bad. I mean characters that you can sympathize with that just happen to be as quick and snarky as a wildly famous, uber intelligent, thirty-four-year-old author sounds like a good time in the YA reading room. This is what Green usually does, and he does it well I might add. But this time it isn't enough to overcome the seemingly endless scenes where he gives play-by-play accounts of high body count, commando video games (Yes, John. I get the metaphor. But you once said that we don't need to intellectually grasp the best metaphors in order for them to work on us emotionally. I believe that wholeheartedly--Hell, I teach it to my students. Unfortunately, the video game metaphor in this book only works intellectually. Meaningful metaphors have to work seamlessly and emotionally for the reader during the act of reading, and after our emotions are stirred, we can go back and intellectually discover why.) To make matters worse, the author in the book that the main characters are trying to contact is the oddest mixture of trite, unbelievable, and phantasm. This poorly developed character randomly pops up in the latter half of the novel like a whack-a-mole. Toward the end, I was desperately seeking out the rubber mallet to bash him with.  Finally, there are the painfully stereotypical liberal-arts-education allusions. John Green has always been an allusionist. He used Marquez and Wilde references to great effect in Looking for Alaska. He gave a nice little nod to Woody Guthrie in Paper Towns, but this time around Green goes shopping for his allusions out of the state college 101 offerings. One \\"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\\"--check. One Maslow's \\"Hierarchy of Needs\\"--check. The entirety of \\"The Red Wheelbarrow\\"--check. Let's see. What am I forgetting? Well, I better throw in a can of \\"Leaves of Grass\\" for good measure. These are all interesting and wonderful things, but hauling them out a bit early and out of context for the teenage set irks me. It feels like Green is just trying to impress the natives with the mundane miracles from his own world.  Perhaps the problem is that John's books are venturing away from his childhood experiences, and since we are the same age, my childhood experiences, and starting to more accurately reflect the experiences of today's adolescents. Maybe I need a little nostalgia in my YA fiction, and maybe I'm just being a crank. What I do know is that I was eagerly awaiting John Green's new book, and I was heartbroken when I read it, not because of the kids with cancer, because of the great author who hides behind them.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I've been using this app on Kindle for a few weeks now, and I'm really impressed. I can access both my home and office computers wherever I am, having full access to all my files and programs. Its basically a wireless monitor.

The story is brilliant and gripping. The characters stay with you and even my 12 year old now is talking about reading it again. We had a discussion about the politics in the book and how we can learn from this futuristic story about how simple freedom can be stripped away.<br />Amazing imagination Suzanna Collins. Thanks for creating a book my whole family can talk about.

B0068RHGJM|5.0|Nightwish - a favorite artist - has released a new CD. In order not to get too excited I never looked up the release date when it was first announced, but now that I know it's available I must have it: Thank you, Amazon 2-day shipping. It arrives today, a rather dark wintery afternoon, and I am so excited.<br /><br />I open the plastic and part the sides of the case. I reflect on how nice it is that some artists seem to be moving away from the easily-breaking jewel cases. This case holds disc 1 on the left, a thin pocket for the booklet in the middle, and disc 2 (the instrumentals) to the right. Disc 1 goes into my computer to start importing, then I can finally take a moment to look at the package before me.<br /><br />The case is a deep blue and black, giving it a mysterious feel. The images on the discs and below the discs are gothic, I especially like the circle of stone-shaded birds. I realize the booklet is in the middle, and it's a bit hard to pull out, but I finally release it. I take a quick glance, and remember again the title of the CD, Imaginaerum. The pictures accompanying the lyrics are strange, magical, and lovely. I flip a little quickly through in order to see every picture. Following the lyrics are photos of the costumed band members. If you were to say the words 'Nightwish' and 'Circus' together before this I would not make the connection, but the band make quite convincing entertainers.<br /><br />Ah, finally, a few songs have finished importing, I can start listening to the music!<br /><br />Track 1, Taikatalvi. I am slowly drawn into the music with this more mellow piece. I glance at the lyrics, and a quick search confirms the song is in Finnish. (I love the internet. Again I am scared of SOPA.)<br /><br />Track 2, Storytime. Already I really like this song. It's a good beginning to the album.<br /><br />Track 3, Ghost River. Now that I'm here, it emerges me - this song is a harder rock, with some of Marco's harsher vocals, but it has some beautiful calmer sections of vocal.<br /><br />Track 4, Slow, Love, Slow. The rock dies abruptly with this slow, jazzy song. To me, this is a completely new sound from Nightwish. At the moment it is just strange, but it is growing on me as I listen. It ends with a ticking clock or metronome.<br /><br />Track 5, I Want My Tears Back. Ah, the lowland pipes! The variety of sounds on the disc is impressing me. Curiosity overcomes me and I again slip the booklet from the case to see the lyrics. I like the collection so far, all invoke myth, though they may not hold the meaning and strength of past-album lyrics.<br /><br />Track 6, Scaretale. The picture in the booklet already scared me. The lyrics also are frightening... and the song starts with creepy tunes. It's a dark circus song, with tightrope-walkers and monsters... although the lyrics don't start until two and a half minutes through the song. I never knew Anette could sound so evil!<br /><br />Track 7, Arabesque. No lyrics. I would say instrumental, but then there is an instrumental version on the other disc (they sound the same to me). It proves a good transition....<br /><br />Track 8, Turn Loose The Mermaids. Mm, lovely. I can imagine the sea.<br /><br />Track 9, Rest Calm. Some hard guitar, mostly - yes - calm and pretty. The vocals (Marco, Anette, choir) mix nicely.<br /><br />Track 10, The Crow, The Owl And The Dove. The booklet tells me this music is by Marco rather than Tuomas. It is a pretty song, not as metal as I might expect. The last bit of lyrics may possibly mean 'go to the river, you'll come to a fairyland' (found from a quick search).<br /><br />Track 11, Last Ride Of The Day. Distracted looking for a translation to those lines, I've only noticed that I like this song.<br /><br />Track 12, Song Of Myself. This is split into 4 parts. 1, From a Dusty Bookshelf; 2, All That Great Heart Lying Still; 3, Piano Black; 4, Love. A rather odd song, I'm still not sure about the lyrics. Parts 2 and 3 are sung, part 4 (the longest part) is spoken, by different members of the band.<br /><br />Track 13, Imaginaerum. Instrumental. Whimsical, pretty, a good closing to the album.<br /><br />I take a breath and come out of my imagination for the real world. It's so easy to daydream with music like this. Having recently read [[ASIN:0385534639 The Night Circus]], I am feeling much in the mood for magic.<br /><br />The inclusion of the instrumental pieces is an interesting step, and a nice touch for karaoke-Nightwish fanatics. The entire collection is a bit unusual and that is what keeps me interested in Nightwish. Imaginaerum is a good collection of sounds and songs. I can't see myself liking it more than Dark Passion Play, but then, need I compare?

1406323926|5.0|The classic 1989 British picture book We're Going on a Bear Hunt has been reprinted with a nice addition of a 5 minute DVD where you get to learn, or be refreshed on the proper way to deliver this classic story when reading out loud, since after all the story works more from the way you talk and the actions yourself and the kids you are reading it to do, than the simple basic words of the story.  The DVD is read by UK actors Emilia Fox and Kevin Whately, who both do a sensational job and deliver the lines just like you remember then from when you were a kid.  It's not a continuous moving cartoon, but instead stills similar and a lot of the time the same as the illustrations in the picture book.  I have no idea what the original 1989 picture book illustrations looked like but the ones in here if not the same are drawn very much in 80s style with characters' clothing and the like.<br /><br />A nice nostalgic piece, if you're unfamiliar with the story the basic plot is a father talking to his children taking them into a fantasy world of an adventure where they are trying to find a bear (note hunting refers to the searching for hunting word, and is not the picking up a weapon and trying to kill the bear meaning). Along the way he reassures them their going to catch a big one and that they are not scared over and over again, which of course is part of the appeal of the story as children join in on the chorus.  Along the way there are many natural obstacles such as long way grass, a river, mud, dark forest and others. each time the father explains that they can't go over it, can't go under it, oh no we've got to go through it and comes up with two word sound affect for each representing them moving through the obstacle such as, swishy swashy, splash spolsh, squelch squerch and so on. Of course what happens if or when they actually find a bear, you'll have to read to find out.<br /><br />A classic for a new generation.

B003ITZBVS|5.0|THIS MOVIE IS NOT YOUR HAPPY GO LUCKY BATMAN WITH LITTLE VIOLENCE.  Before this movie, I was only mildly interested in the Batman comics/graphic novels and only viewed the cartoons because they were beautifully told and animated.  But once I watched it premier during the San Diego CCI I was floored and decided to look up the source, the Under the (Red) Hood run of the Batman comics.  Suffice to say, I am hooked on the comic books.  Though I didn't buy this in Amazon, I did buy a copy and would probably buy another in BluRay once I upgrade to that player.  The story closely follows the source but the addition of voices and action makes the story that much more effective than the comics.  It is so emotionally taxing and beautifully told that every time I watch it, which I've done multiple times, it still causes tears.  Just like all the DC animated movies and series, the animation and quality is top notch and the voices were beautifully chosen and handled.  This movie is all about the second Robin, the one that lives in infamy for being the only comic book character whose fate DC allowed fans to decide, and his heartbreaking return to Bruce/Batman's life.  The story is also a great intro to Batman's psychology and his relationship to his Robins.  This is my favorite of all DC animated features and is something that shouldn't be missed by any Batman fan.  The only thing I could see someone having a gripe over is hearing Bender (from Futurama)or Jake (Adventure Time) as the Joker.  It takes a while to get used to Di Maggio as Joker, but I believe his voice, especially the low rasps, does add a more sinister undercurrent to the character than Hamill's more cheerful sounding voice. OH AND MORE NIGHTWING PLEASE.

B005K17RU0|4.0|APP installed well. Works SO much better  on the kindle than the blackberry version.  Had little difficulty getting default location changed, and wish the radar animation covered a longer range of time. Other than that, I love it.  Also love having the quick launch in the upper left.
B000ID37SQ|5.0|I'm sure there are a few movies out there, but I can't think of any movie Al Pacino was in that I didn't like. Either he has a knack for picking good movies to star in or he's just a great actor. Probably a little bit of both. This Cuban mafia movie is awesome. Also fun to see how Miami was in it's drug heyday. Not that I condone drugs!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its a fun way to pass time.  games range in type and difficulty.  I have really enjoyed it so far and my children have also.

0141192410|5.0|This novel touches my soul and warms my heart in ways I never thought possible. I find myself relating to Jo, then to Beth, then to Meg, and rarely, to Amy. I understand these girls and feel as if they are my sisters. Marmee is my second mother. Professor Bhaer is my hot older intelligent German professor. Laurie is my tag along buddy. This story speaks to me. I'm so in love with it that words will not do them justice. This novel produces feelings so strong and sure. I bought this edition at BN for the full retail price. It's a beautiful linen cover and, unfortunately, I GOT A LITTLE NAIL POLISH ON ONE OF THE PAGES! Sorry, I had to vent. Anyway, I'm not sure why some people rate this as one star. This is certainly not an abridged version, there are no pictures, and it's definitely not written for children. Perhaps the picture is deceiving customers and we are not talking about the same edition?  GABRIELLE
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Well first try I got to night 25 with 260k+ score I like the trees and the rebuilding of buildings although it gets kind of expensive in later rounds I suggest upgrading your missile speed to lvl 5 asap. All in all a good twist on a classic game.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Great app. tons of fun.. The only thing that I don't like is how the points keep going up on each page like first its 4000 then 180000 then 300000. but its still a fun game
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this app is GREAT! It really helps me with reading the Bible thanks so much for making this app free.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|this is a great game no matter the age! I enjoy playing it as well as my kids! good job!
B0054JZC6E|2.0|It was ok until I got my update then I lost things and everything I recommend this one star 1 for being ok at first take this from me BE CAREFUL
B002NEFL8W|5.0|If you shoot a lot of shots portrait style then this thing is a must have! It just makes it so much easier and comfortable. It takes a little getting used to switching your hand position, but ultimately is so worth it! It even helps just the normal landscape position because it gives you a little more room to hold onto.  Also if you shoot a lot and/ or shoot video you know that batteries can drain faster then you would like. This grip can hold two batteries so that can give you about 2000 shots! It can also hold 6 AA batteries in the included battery magazine. That can be very useful if you are away from a charger, but have AA's around. The problem with AA's is that you only get about 600 shots and you cannot know how much battery life you still have left because they are not chipped.  One con about this grip is that the shutter button is more sensitive then the one on the body. I often find myself \\"double tapping\\" and taking two pictures, but that is not that big of a problem. Some people may actually prefer it that way.  Overall the build quality is great! It is weather sealed and has a magnesium alloy frame, just like the 7D body. Very rugged. I would easily recommend this grip over any other third party manufacturer. You will not be disappointed by this grip. If you got a cheaper one you will always be wishing you had just saved a little more and got this one.
031617615X|1.0|How all these tween girls fell in love with such a horrid series is beyond me. I forced myself to read it to improve my own writing. Yes, my own self-pubbed published novella was horrible too (I did the right thing and pulled it to fix the many errors which Meyers should have done.), but good lord Meyers has a freakin' degree! I expected much more from someone with that education. Alas, one has to born with talent first. I love torture porn and horror flicks and this series disturbed me! A pedophile wolf, WTF???!!! Poor Jacob was doomed (cursed) the moment he crossed paths with Bella. Bella and Edward's obsession with each other would have made a great horror story or even psych thriller but as a \\"romance\\" it's beyond disturbing in its suckage.I mean, she manipulates everyone around her without remorse. I terrifies me that this was geared to tweens, but then again I look at things from odd angles.    Sadly, it was horrific to read as a young woman loses every ounce of herself for basically a stranger and HER OWN PARENTS DO NOT CARE. If I was a mom my kids wouldn't come within a hundred feet of this book. What the hell kind of message does this send?!! \\"Hey kids, it's okay to abandon everything for your first crush; your parents and friends don't matter. They'll only stand in your way!\\"  Way to go, teach kids to be amoral, antisocial and sociopathic.    Bella is a total  weakling, let's face it that a lot of us wanted her to vamp out then go on a killing spree and do something that actually made sense according to the rules of that world. I mean it's as if Meyers randomly put together events and used tons of worthless filler to put it together. Scary how many people fell under the spell of this trash. At the end I was outraged that there wasn't a hellacious battle. Bella with battle scars would have improved my opinion of her. Instead, the villains simply walk away. What they couldn't circle around for a surprise attack or kidnapped Nessie. What's with people hatingthe name Renesmee? It's different. I think if it wasn't linked to the book people would like it.
0684857219|5.0|If you want to build a new body..get this book. I might not be a big Arnold fan, but his knowledge when it come to bodybuilding is undeniable. So much information which has been used by the best bodybuilders in the world is in this book. This is a must have.
B005HSG3VK|4.0|After a lot of searching, I finally settled on this cover and I am very pleased with it. This case provides a nice, tight fit for my kindle without adding a lot of bulk and it seems to protect the kindle well.  The color (pink) is a lot brighter than I expected, almost a neon pink.  I would've preferred the color displayed on the computer screen.  Overall, a great product.
B004TN7QPG|3.0|Google has version 1.4.2b why doesn't Amzon? I really prefer a two-paged layout. Otherwise the best epub reader I've found.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I got this app because I needed to read the Bible more. To build a relationship with God. This app has allowed me to do that. Im not saying that I understand all of it but I'm trying.
B005HSG3TC|3.0|I purchased this case for my Kindle fire fairly soon after receiving it as a Christmas gift.  The case itself it good, it looks a bit like a transformer and the color (I got the \\"charcoal\\") was much lighter than I expected and it still has a black cover.  I like the fact that it stands your kindle up, however I wish it would support the kindle both ways.  However, if you have a shedding pet, this is not the case for you.  Luckily I also bought a screen protector!  My dog (some kind of a mix) sheds profusely and her hair is all over no matter how much I vacuum.  The inside of the kindle case is a marvelous dog hair attractor, but it doesn't like to let go of the hair.  I lint roll the INSIDE of the front cover (also the stand part) quite often and can never quite remove all the dog hair.  Though the case is functional and protects my kindle, I am in the market for a new case, and you may want to continue looking if you have a shedding pet.
B002TYZKIM|4.0|As a Michael Jackson fan, he was and always will be a legend. If you're not a fan, you won't agree, and you certainly won't understand. His music, his dance style, and his unbeatable charitable contributions to many organizations, are all pieces of that creative Michael Jackson puzzle that we all craved to explore, that we all missed because we were too busy judging him, and that we all long for now, but all we can do now is cherish the memories and legacy of the music contributions he left behind. The \\"This Is It\\" film is entertaining enough if you just want to have one more glance of Michael in action before his untimely death. Many complain that this DVD is not a five star performance. Of course it's not. But it's not a failed attempt at immortalizing him either. This DVD gives us a peek inside his last rehearsal performances. We get to see the making of what I think was going to be one hell of a great tour had he lived to complete the tour he had planned. My reasons for liking and buying this DVD is simple. I like it because it is his last performance. I like it because I am a fan. I like it because it's Michael doing what Michael loved to do the most...perform....dance....sing...and to put it in an even more simple term...ENTERTAIN. And that's just the way it is.
B001HN6EF4|5.0|Ever since Uno was invented it has been a hard game to beat but this H2O version with clip it takes a step beyond practical. With the clip you don't need the box and you don't have to worry about losing a card! Being water resistant is simply brilliant, they never get damaged, kids/adults can play wherever and in whatever conditions. Drink spills - so what! Sticky fingers - who cares!
B005Y423ZC|5.0|This was a gift for my 14-year old daughter. It has become one of our favorite cd's! It's a great live album. We wish more of the monologues from the DVD were included on the cd, but it does not suffer from the lack of. We highly recommend any of Adele's albums!
B00136Q6DA|5.0|Sara Bareilles' album was my first music purchase from Amazon.com.  Her hit \\"Love Song\\" proves that she's got a big voice, despite the album title.  It was perfect to play while entertaining, and I enjoyed the mood created by her and her magic piano.  Bill

B004I2K4DY|5.0|I had seen this video on PBS and knew I had to have it for my mother---the ultimate Colm Wilkinson junkie.  The price was right, the package came quickly, well wrapped, and it made a great gift.  As performances go, it is the ultimate assembly of singers, and the three choruses was a stroke of genius. That Trevor Nunn and Cameron MacIntosh are second only to ME in their creative passion.

B004G5ZXVQ|5.0|R.E.M. fan since day one with the release of Chronic Town E.P so I have followed these guys forever.  This is a well crafted, well written, and well produced nice little kiss goodbye from the guys.  I am only sorry the Grammy Awards folks decided to give this one the snub because it deserves recognition as Best Rock Album.  I will miss R.E.M who were an essential part of my youth and the reason for my musical tastes.  Thanks VERY much to Michael, Mike, Peter, and Bill for a wonderful career.  This was a fantastic effort for a sendoff.
B004E2XAFW|5.0|I've been a fan of Within Temptation ever since their release of Enter and still in love with the band.  I love Sharon's ever changing vocals and how the band always seems to create an entire story for every single album recorded.  Simply amazing!!!
1451627289|4.0|I have read and enjoyed about a dozen of SK's books. Just having started with this one, I just can't get past the idea that if this premise had any entertainment logic, how could for instance the erasure of the Vietnam war affect everyone here in the present especially those who were there? Somebody out there help me through this. I realize of course that it's fiction, but what logic drives me on to reading this to the finish?
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a great app. I enjoy the plans it makes reading the Bible easier and more understandable. Becoming flower with God is my goal and with this app it's as easy as 123.

B004J1DBJI|5.0|Used the app for Calculus 3 last semester and now for differential equations, but have used the Website many times in the past. Own a HTC Evo 3D and the app came with its own keyboard, that makes using symbols SO MUCH EASIER than the traditional android keyboard. Having its own keyboard is what makes it reallllyyy great.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its a fun game but after do many times, it just gets boring. besides that, its okay. maybe allowing more games earlier would make this better

0156027321|5.0|The life of pie is a great story that will have you enthralled for hours as you dive into this heart warming story of life, death, and discovering ones self. When I choose to read this book I thought that this book would not live up to the hype that it was getting. Once I got into it though I quickly released that this book was defiantly real, and for anybody wanting a totally new experience in a book, then this is for you. Yann Martels unique way of writing will have you wondering, who is Pi going to meet next, where is he going to end up, is he ever going to make it home. Pi's journey is like being a leaf in the wind, no idea where you are going or when yo will get there, just living to be free in a world of endless possibilities. If your an avid reader I suggest you take the time to read this and even if you don't read then this is the book that should get you started.
B00632HWOG|1.0|Crashes often, can only view 10 emails at a time and can not view images or open up attachments. Also very heavy on the email notifications. I have an HTC thunderbolt.

1565117808|2.0|I really wanted to like this book. I heard about this book a few years ago when it came out and have seen it on friends' shelves since then and therefore thought it was worth the read. Recently, I got Zoo Story by Thomas French and while I haven't read the book yet, I looked at the acknowledgements in the back and French thanks Martel for writing The Life of Pi and inspiring him to write Zoo Story. That sealed it for me, I was going to read/listen to The Life of Pi.<br /><br />Let me first say that I listened to this as an audio book. The reader did an excellent job. He did the voices well and different accents. He was not distracting in the least and kept his voice entertaining. 5 stars for the reader.<br /><br />The book started out interesting, then boring, then interesting again. He talked about his family having a zoo and growing up with that. He also explored different religions, which was interesting, but I was ready for the lifeboat and tiger action!<br /><br />***SPOILER ALERT!***<br /><br />Then the family decides to move to Canada and they get on a cargo ship with some of their animals for the long ride. Cargo ship sinks, Pi is the only human survivor with a zebra (with a broken leg), a tiger, a hyena, and an orangutan. As the story goes on, the other animals die/get eaten until it's just Pi and the tiger. He talks about rationing the food he found on the boat, making fresh water with the supplies and catching fish to feed to the tiger so the tiger doesn't eat him. He also talks about \\"training\\" the tiger to stay in his own territory. This goes on for quite a while.<br /><br />Then the story gets weird. I was alright with Pi's adventure and thought it 4-star worthy until they reached *the island*. The island that is made of algae and vines and trees and is inhabited only by thousands of meerkats. The island that apparently is carnivorous and eats/consumes fish, meerkats, and even people.<br /><br />That was the point in the story where I was done. I finished it, don't worry. However, up until that point the story seemed plausible. Not really probable, but plausible. Then it just twisted.<br /><br />After he leaves the island (he didn't want it to eat him!) he travels further, the tiger seems to become blind, then Pi himself becomes blind. In his last throws of life, blind, he starts talking to someone with a French accent. At first, as the reader, I think he's talking to himself, then Pi thinks he's talking to the tiger, but then, the person is somehow real, and ends up eaten by the tiger!. After he cries over the loss his sight is restored and he ends up on some Mexican beach, the tiger leaves, people find him, and he is taken care of. Then some people who represent the cargo ship company find him and want to find out what happened to cause the ship to sink. He tells them his story and they don't believe it. THEN, he tells a different story where his mother and the French cook on the boat live for a little while - a story which closely parallels the animal story. Now everyone is confused, including the reader, as to what really happened. The end.<br /><br />I can see where someone might be able to gain a greater, deeper meaning of something in there somewhere - symbolism and whatnot. There are some people who can read between the lines in stories and gain a greater understanding of what they think the author meant. I am not one of those people. I thought the story was weird and I was thoroughly disappointed with it after all of the hype I heard.<br /><br />As an afterthought, while I am not one who has studied writing and know not what makes \\"beautiful writing\\" I believe this book was written very well. There are a lot of great descriptions and the reader can really feel the salt on the skin and levels of thirst. However, the writing style does not make up for a weird story in my opinion.seemed plausible. Not really probable, but plausible. Then it just twisted.

B00008EUMA|5.0|I got this for my dad for Christmas and he was so excited about it.  It's the best Megadeth record and a great add to his vinyl collection.
B0052U59F4|5.0|I don't normally spend this much on books because I read them so fast. As a recommendation from another book I'd read, this one sounded interesting and it was a little longer so I splurged. Best...purchase...ever!  From the first page I couldn't put it down. To say I became, and remain, addicted is a understatement. As I read I experienced so many emotions....shock, anger, intrigue, hope, jealousy, loss. Fifty Shades is the perfect description of the emotions felt.  This is definitely a book I will remember forever! And recommend to everyone I know.
B002SSUQFG|2.0|After owning the first one and it gaining 30 seconds a day and sending that one back, the second one which amazon shipped out kept great time gaining less than one second a day. However, the biggest downfall of this watch that isn't mentioned much is its power reserve. It wouldn't even stay wound enough to power it from early evening to the next morning. There is no manual wind mechanism on this, it's all from your wrist movement. Also, the watch band is very small and if you have even small wrists, it will look like a woman's watchband. I put a nato band on it and that fixed it but it is a small case watch. I would recommend the citizen eco-drive 8180. It is a bit larger and it never needs a battery. Also, with its made in japan quartz mov't, it will be the most accurate watch you'll ever own. The Seiko 5 is made in Malaysia, and evidently you are getting what you pay for, online cult following or not. One last thing to mention re: the Seiko, the mov't is the new C mov't, not the B. This is a big deal. Back to amazon this one goes too.
B000FVE3BG|5.0|Just received it...I could not contain myself from opening it right away. I noticed one thing. WTH?? The box is tiny compared to my other Invicta watch.

0553386794|3.0|I advise against reading A Game of Thrones until George R.R. Martin finishes writing his addictive but interminably pessimistic and brutal adult fantasy series, A Song of Fire and Ice.<br /><br />A Game of Thrones begins with the ominous warning that \\"winter is coming.\\" Five volumes and 4,223 pages later (more in softcover), the snowflakes are finally beginning to fall. The saga is an addictive escape for adult fantasy fans, but Martin junkies may have to suffer from withdrawal for several years until their next \\"fix.\\"<br /><br />The first two books are tightly plotted and events advance more or less directly toward the threatened final conflict between light and dark. However, starting in the third book, A Storm of Swords, Martin wanders off and loses control of his plot and characters. Even minor conflicts rarely resolve and ostensibly dead characters mystically revive. Martin departs from his central plot and begins churning out superfluous new characters, prolix descriptions and distracting subplots as though he is being paid by the word and his writing career will perish if this series ever concludes.<br /><br />Martin has averaged about 3.75 years between episodes and it took him more than 5 years to produce each of the last two. Martin is promising not to introduce more leading characters but he may change his plans again. This series may continue through winter, past spring and summer, then return to autumn. [Fans of Patrick O'Brian recall that he died before his Aubrey and Maturin, who survived 20 volumes of sea-faring historical fiction which, unlike Martin's tomes, were self-contained stories until the unfinished 21st.]<br /><br />Martin is not another Tolkien, but he is an exceptionally talented fantasy writer who is equipped with a rich imagination, clever mind, and extensive knowledge of medieval life. A Song of Fire and Ice is not as seminal as the Lord of the Rings, but is a genuinely original tapestry of intriguing plots, engagingly complex characters, and provocatively ambiguous morality.<br /><br />A Game of Thrones and its first sequel, A Clash of Kings, are especially enjoyable and the series is addictive, but do not expect any of the conflicts to resolve, the deceased to remain in their graves, or any \\"happily ever after.\\".

B004VMUS9G|5.0|One thing I love most is the snooze button because it's HUGE, another is the option to start the alarm off quiet and having it slowly rise in tone, and another is multiple alarms! BTW works great on my kindle fire.
B005HSG3TC|3.0|It's a nice case, slim and compact.  The Kindle Fire snaps into it easily and is held firmly.  The bottom of the case that holds the Kindle is hard and has a rubbery surface that makes it easy to grip.  The side end is cut away so you have free access to the USB port, headphone jack and on/off switch.  The inside of the case that is next to the screen is felted to protect the screen, but it picks up lint and pet hair (cat in my case) like crazy.  I've already had to clean it off with sticky tape once. It has a cloth elastic band to keep the case closed.  It does have a stand so that you can prop the Kindle up to read, but the edge of the case is tricky to get into the right groove, landscape is the only viewing choice and you only get one viewing angle choice.  Otherwise I would have given it four stars.  There is no place to keep a stylus, so if you plan to use one, you'll have to keep up for it.  There is also no place for headphones so again, you'll have to keep up with them too.  If I had it to do over again, I would have bought Amazon's stand as it allows multiple viewing angles.  I just now bought a neophrene sleeve that has a pocket so I will have a place to keep my stylus and headphones together with my Kindle, and will just have to keep up with one thing and not 3.
1594744769|5.0|This book wasn't really what I expected at all, but I really enjoyed it! The cover made me think it was going to be incredibly scary and creepy and I was a little bit afraid to read it. it was eerie at the end, but it was entertaining and whimsical. Very original! I really liked it and I'm glad I read it!

B005FMZVLQ|4.0|I really like this watch.  The large face and typeface make it a really nice piece of jewelry.  I like the cloth/leatherback strap.  Metal bands tend to pinch, so it is always nice to find a good quality watch without a metal watch band. Because of its size this is a watch that is meant to be seen.  If you are one to hide your watch under the sleeve of your shirt, beware it may not work with this one.  The occasional snag on a jacket or sweater slevve is also an inevitability.  Overall, I am very pleased with this watch; especially at this price.

I've read a lot of Stephen Shakespeare's books, and 95% of them invariably lapse into periodic page upon page of tangential diatribe [filler], but not this GEM. \\"November 22nd, 1963\\" ranks right up there with Firestarter and Salem's Lot. Found it frankly amazing that there is not one page of pointless pontificating to be found anywhere in this book.

B002RXHW6S|1.0|My 1 and 2 year old boys got this as a gift for Christmas and absolutely loved it... until it totally deflated in less than two weeks!  We never let them wear shoes or bring toys inside either.  There were no holes, but instead tears in the seams which could not be repaired, even with the repair kit that we received with the gift.  Every single compartment that needed to be blown up had a tear somewhere, and there are A LOT of compartments!  I'm very upset about this as my friend spent a lot of money on it, and my children were so excited to receive it.  DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PIECE OF JUNK!  Again, the children to ever jump in it were a 1 and 2 years with a combined weight of 51 lbs and the bouncer could not even hold up for two weeks.

078689136X|4.0|Richard Castle books are a lot like potato chips--you can't read just one. As soon as I finished Heat Wave (see review) I started craving another Castle book, and I caved in within a couple of days and started Naked Heat. It was pure indulgence, and I loved every sinful page of it.<br /><br />This story starts with Lt. Nikki Heat and her two detectives Raley and Ochoa discovering Jameson Rook at the scene of a recent homicide, listening to his iPod, with the body of the victim in the next room. (Any resemblances between events in the book and episodes of seasons 2 and 3 of Castle are undoubtedly intentional).<br /><br />Heat hasn't seen her former shadow and occasional lover, journalist Rook, for a few months. Not since his article in First Press magazine about his \\"ride-along\\" with her and her detectives was published. That article made her the focus of the piece, and brought her a lot of unwanted attention. Nikki only wants to be a cop, not a media darling. And the article made her look like a one-woman crimefighter, totally shortchanging her team.<br /><br />No one at the Precinct really wanted to see Rook again. He'd screwed all of them in that article, one way or another.<br /><br />But the dead body in the next room was Cassidy Towne, mud-slinging gossip-raker extraordinaire...and Jameson Rook's current subject. Without, as he explained to Nikki, the sex.<br /><br />Even if none of the team wanted Rook back, they needed him this time. He was the insider, both in the publishing world, and on the subject of Cassidy Towne's current projects and potential enemies.<br /><br />So they were stuck with Rook after all, trying to charm his way into everyone's good graces again, and back into Nikki's bed. All the while, trying to help the police solve the case of Cassidy Towne's death before the killer strikes again.<br /><br />Escape Rating B: I was struck by how much Nikki Heat reminds me of Eve Dallas in the J.D. Robb In Death series. And through Dallas, Sigrid Harald from Margaret Maron's series as well. The tough female detective with the damaged past who builds a family out of the members of her precinct house, and eventually finds love in a most unlikely place. Nikki, Eve and Sigrid are all sisters under the skin.<br /><br />But if Nikki is an avatar for Eve Dallas, Jameson Rook is no Roarke. Not on Rook's best day and Roarke's worst. I like Jameson Rook as a character, but there's no resemblance. The analogy just doesn't stretch that far, in spite of the similar names.<br /><br />Jameson Rook, unlike Richard Castle, is a magazine writer, and presumbly doesn't make as comfortable a living. So Rook has to supplement his earnings by writing under a pseudonym. And what does Jameson Rook write, and as whom? Under the name Victoria St. Clair, Jameson Rook writes romance novels. And he's not the first fictional hero to make his living this way, either. In Tanya Huff's Blood series, Victoria Nelson's vampire partner, Henry Fitzroy, also wrote historical romances. I keep imagining Henry and Rook meeting at a romance writers' convention. It would have to be at night, of course.<br /><br />I read this just for fun. And did I ever have fun.

B005P58PZC|5.0|Great series in a different spin of the Fantastic series La Femme Nikita. LOVE that Madeline appears in this series! The show is done in a different direction and there is a definite difference in the way the show is done as a whole. I think this a plus because Nobody could replace the first :) Worth every penny to watch

B0051T47NQ|2.0|I missed seeing this film in theaters and was disappointed but after seeing it on DVD, I was REALLY disappointed. It was long and boring.  I enjoyed the scenes with trolls but they are in, at most, 10% of the movie. The other 90% of the movie was talking -- mostly unimportant jabber. You can skip through most of the dialogue in the second half of the movie and you wouldn't have missed anything important. The movie just dragged. Some of the explanations about the life and death of trolls were well thought out but cohesively the whole story was a chore to sit through.  The 'lost tapes' idea is tiresome. With Blair Witch, at least it had a strong element of fear. Paranormal Activity had that AND some comedy sprinkled throughout. Troll Hunter was just blah and overrated.
B001P829VY|5.0|Received item very quickly and in excellent shape. Even though I ordered rather close to Christmas, I still received this in time for Christmas giving.  Thanks!
0307352145|5.0|It isn't easy being an introvert. Susan Cain knows this and has written a very compelling book about why the world needs us, even if it doesn't think so! \\"Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World that Can't Stop Talking\\" is a very interesting study of the differences between introverts and extroverts and how we balance each other. She examines when the world started to view extroversion as the ideal and some of the negative consequences of that. She also looked at some of the ways introverts try to make themselves appear more extroverted.<br /><br />In doing research for this book, Cain attended a Tony Robbins seminar designed to help people be more successful in business and in life. Honestly, just reading about it made this introvert tired! Yet, introverts can be leaders, too, and Cain explains how to use our strengths to be effective in leadership roles.<br /><br />She also examines how today's classrooms are designed to support extroverts with lots of group learning. While that in itself isn't a bad thing, Cain explores why students need independent learning as well. In fact, contrary to popular belief, she offers creativity actually thrives on independent pursuit rather than group brainstorming.<br /><br />Still, introverts often do need to act like extroverts, at least some of the time. Most of us are able to do this - to conquer our fears of speaking in public or working in groups - if we believe in the cause or project we are working on. Cain offers suggestions on how to make the most of both our introvert qualities and the times we need to act out of character.<br /><br />\\"Quiet\\" is an enlightening book and emphasizes how and why the world needs introverts. I would recommend it to any introverts as well as to extroverts married to or raising introverts. It is always helpful to understand the other side.
1568363931|5.0|I just received it, though it might only contain a few Japanese recipes it's overall a great cookbook. A way to remind people that bento shouldn't just be about focusing on how decorative and impressive the food looks, but rather how healthy and simple it is to make bentos for your family and self. I'm glad I bought it.

For some games, the controls are a little laggy but it didn't stop me from continuing to play. In fact, it made me want to beat them even more! (I swesr it's that addicting) Also, the ads are a little annoying because it is easy to accidentally click them but I understand that is why it's free so I don't mind. Overall, great free app!!

0439023521|5.0|This book left me in shock. No book has ever been able to capture my attention enough to keep me reading all night; but this book change that. I began reading Hunger Games for school, but finished the entire novel in two days. If you love action and suspense, this book is for you. If you love romance and drama, this book is also for you. Hunger games litterally has both men and women reading into the wee hours of the morning as twenty-four teenage tributes are thrown into an electronically controlled forest for a three week fight to the death. Before you search the internet to find out which tribute comes out of the Hunger Games alive, please consider reading this incredible novel.

B004GGM444|1.0|I'm responding here to the recent hype around Skrillex as a \\"dubstep artist.\\" I'd like to take this opportunity to set the record straight for those of you just encountering the dubstep genre through Skrillex's music. Skrillex is not dubstep. He takes the worst and most cliched conventions of dubstep (\\"wobbly bass,\\" for example), mashes them up with glitch techno bleeps and electrofarts, and wraps them up in emo/aggro rock posturing.  I find Skrillex's music shrill in tone and sophomoric in content, nothing like the subtly unsettling atmospherics, rolling basslines, and unconventional rhythms of quality dubstep from artists such as Shackleton, Burial, Kode9, Zomby, and Benga. I'd recommend any of those artists and the \\"5 Years of Hyperdub\\" compilation for a peek into what dubstep is really about.  If anything, I think (hope) the so-called brostep trend led by people like Skrillex will eventually open a few doors into better music for younger listeners, rather than exploding into another vacuous, faux-adolescent, emo/aggro rock lurch (cf. circa late 90s/early 00s Korn, Limp Bizkit, etc.) dressed up as dubstep. Trust me, there's more sophisticated music out there that rewards with repeated listens. I've listed a few artists above. I'd encourage Skrillex listeners to check them out.  Thanks for reading.

B006WPSQVC|5.0|I watched this movie prior to my husband watching it because I wanted to know how to pray for him and support him in his walk with Christ. He just watched it with me tonight and he loved it as much as I do! He cried, laughed, and sat thoughtfully through the movie. We both loved Javier and his unique set of circumstances with his family, as well as Adam's. We tend to forget that God really can change us, and that without Him, we're completely unable to change ourselves or our situations. These two men were shining examples of Faith lived out. All the men in the movie had their shining moments and qualities as well as faults and we felt that they accurately portrayed the ups and downs of parenthood, faith, and becoming a new and improved believer in Christ. This is a wonderful movie. I'd highly recommend to everyone, believer or not because by the end of this movie, you will believe in the power of Christ.
B00632HWOG|1.0|Like others have said, it only shows 10 messages, no matter what you do. I'm sure this is how they \\"optimized its performance \\", but it makes the app worthless.  I will have to use Gmail until they fix this stupidity.

B0029QRA1U|4.0|The sound quality is excellent from my records that are 30-40 years old!  And once you get used to it, it's relatively easy.  I had never used itunes and that was very intuitive. The instructions on how to do the conversion leave something to be desired. For example, on the computer screen it says to push the start/stop button when ready to record.  However, nothing happened so I spent 30 minutes waiting for customer service to be told that on this model you need to have to manually put the needle arm down.  If you care about how the tracks break, you need to use the manual option since on the first LP I converted, there was a bunch of small tracks where the singer must have taken a breathe and on the second, several tracks got combined into one.  If you use the automatic option, you might want to label only the first track before they get uploaded until you see what you have. It's very easy to label them after they are uploaded.  You can convert one side of an album, upload it and then come back and do the other side or convert one side and immediately flip it over and do the other.  When I did this it gave me a 25 second blank track that was easily deleted. Do not hit the Back button unless you want to start over!  Since I'm doing my 3rd LP as I type this, I don't know how long it will last, but I really like it now.

0307949486|5.0|This book was a thoughtful and exciting novel. It does start a little bit slow, but once you are into the story it moves quite rapidly. The book does contain one violent portion, but without that section you could not understand the characters and their interaction with one another. The book then travels through a family maze of sadistic hate to lead you to an unexpected end, all the while you taken through a twisted web. The main point of this one is that it starts slow, but once it gets going its hell on wheels. Very well written and entertaining. Get it and enjoy.

1451627289|5.0|Having read every one of King's books, I feel like a pseudo expert on his efforts. I loved this book from page one and it got better as it neared the final pages[900+]. For the first time ever I wanted to go to the last pages to see how it ended before I finished it. Maybe Stephen is mellowing in his old age but this effort was by far his best. He is known for his out of this world stories with horror being the key ingredient. This story had substance, great story line, you name it. It was hard to put down. Congrats on a great effort.
B006MGDVFM|5.0|What a man Aryton Senna was.  'Senna' holds you strapped into the cockpit and doesn't let go until the very end.  The pace of this documentary is excellent, the sounds are spot on, the footage is unprecedented, and overall 'Senna' is very journalistically balanced.  Senna was a man of great faith and ability, culminating in his untimely death in 1994.  Highly recommend not only for racing enthusiasts but also those looking to learn about an extraordinary, one of kind man.
B0060ZJ74O|4.0|This is why I like Brad Pitt.  This guy, for the longest time, has been making movies of real substance rather than letting his looks help him.  He would rather win Best Actor rather than Best Ass and has picked his roles accordingly.  The first time I realized what a good actor he was was in 12 Monkeys.  He has been impressing me ever since (with the occasional misfire-Legends of the Fall anyone?) with his roles that seem to do the opposite of capitalizing on his looks.  Well, here's another one.  He doesn't chew the scenery, but gives a nicely nuanced portrayal.  The story is interesting and if you don't know what appened with the As, it keeps your interest?  Will they win or not.  There are so many moments this film could have stumbled with schmaltzy, Hollywood conventions.  Indeed, there is a lot here that could degenerate into that, particularly in the scenes with his broken family.  But even these scenes ring true.  Jonah Hill is really good here too, showing once again that good comic actors make good regular actors.  He is perfect for the role without degenerating into the funny fat guy he normally plays.  He gives light comic relief without going overboard.  All told, it is a very good movie.  It is high time that Brad finally got an Oscar.  Maybe this movie will give him that chance.
1250004217|5.0|Sarah's key is a book about the tragedies that occurred in the year 1942 and the events in the life of an American journalist living in Paris, France. Such tragedies were later named the Vel'd'Hiv, which was not branded in the minds of Parisians permanently. The novel begins through the point of view of a young Jewish girl living in Paris, France during the 1900's. One night she is awoken by the French police rounding up all the Jews to send them to concentration camps, which she knows nothing about. This fact causes her to lock her younger brother in a cupboard, an act she is haunted with for the rest of her life. The young girl is taken with her mother and father from the Parisian apartment to a bicycle stadium filled with other Jews, and is kept there for many days without water, food, or any access to lavatories.  The American journalist lives in the year 2002 and is planning to move into said apartment of the girl she knows nothing about, with her husband and daughter. Julia Jarmond the American journalist in 2002 is assigned the cover story of the 60th anniversary of the Vel'd'Hiv' for the American magazine she works for in Paris. She soon discovers that the apartment she plans to live in with her family, belonged to a jewish family by the name of Starzynski. The novel proceeds with Sara Strazynski's (the young girl who lived in the apartment) point of view, as she is separated from her parents and as she escapes from the concentration camp in Auschwitz, with Rachel a young girl about her age.  Julia is now determined to uncover what occurred to the young girl named Sara, and she begins to discover more about her husband, Bertand Tézac's family in France. Sara is found by an elderly couple, and is saved from the German police, but Rachel unluckily died.  Julia is astounded with the grim discoveries she makes while writing her article, and she is also suffering harshly in her personal life. Julia is over powered by the guilt she experiences when forced to decide on an abortion. She makes the decision that controls the rest of her life.  The book Sarah's key method alternates between the year 1942 and the year 2002 effectively tying both time periods and it concludes the story with a gratifying end. Admitteldy I preferred the sections involving the past, because they were much more interesting and informative than the others. But the over all book, was a page turner, and I would recommend it to those who are like to read about history with an interesting twist.
B0050PYNO4|3.0|This was a funny and very interesting movie. The movie solicited the comedic talents of Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, and Jason Bateman to ensure the film was successful. The film seemed to be a propaganda piece to promote the evolution belief.
B000Q6GUW0|4.0|How a serial killer has managed to capture my attention still mystifies me, I started watching because I was intrigued as to how they were going to turn those rather dark books into a tv series for prime time.

B005K17RU0|2.0|Initially I had few qualms with Accuweather for Android on Kindle Fire. The weather is accurate, the app interface is utilitarian and the price is free. After the last update something must have gotten messed up. The app would force close almost everytime I used it.  Despite force closing it, it would still run in the background. Last but not least I was able to deduce it was slowing my Kindle down (it was the only one force closing). My Kindle Fire became slow, the screen unresponsive and the experience overall...laggy. After uninstalling this app, my Fire was fast and responsive again. Good thing too- I was ready to use my warranty and swap it out for a new one.  Install this app at your own risk. If you encounter similar problems, uninstall and/or wait for an update.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I watched this movie with my wife, my teenage son and daughter (twins), and our preteen son. This movie is the best one yet from this film group. I have seen \\"Facing the Giants\\" and \\"Fireproof\\" which were both great films with great messages, but the message in \\"Courageous\\" has by far had a greater impact on me (and even my family) than anything I have seen in a long time. It really stresses the importance of creating a stable home environment for your family, of being there for them as a husband and father. The film also touches on the difficulties that can be faced if you take lightly the role of being the leader in your home. It really emphasizes the importance of taking the leadership role in the family seriously, and the importance of calling out the man or woman in your child. In addition to having a great message, the movie was very well written and superbly acted. There was action, there was laughter, there were tears...the movie has it all. Awesome, awesome, awesome film. I highly recommend this film as a must see for every family.
B0010VD7EO|5.0|MGMT,S  Oracular Spectacular is nothing short of a masterpiece.  This is music that will stand the test of time.  The sonwriting is top notch and the music euphoric.  Their are a variety of styles on this cd, no two songs sound the same.  In a time of some of the worst popular music ever MGMT is a huge breath of fresh air.  The album cover is awesome and fits perfectly with the music.  I have been watching alot of interviews with MGMT and am a little suprised how childish and do I dare say imature they are. Oh well I guess its the finished product that matters and regardless of what I think of them personally its their brilliant music that speaks for itself.

B003ZSJ212|5.0|There'll be no escape for the princess this time.  No, he doesn't like you.  And I don't like you either.  Ya know, that little droid is going to cause me a lot of trouble.  Oh, he excels at that, sir.  Mos Eisley Spaceport, you will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villany.  These aren't the droids you're looking for.  Han, ma boo-key.  Say what anyone wants to say, good or bad.  I'm not complaining.  I love it.  As a Blu-ray release it is stunning.  Much better than I thought it could be.  Amazing.  Chewy looks positively wonderful.  I could go on and on.  There are excellent comments by others on plots and technical matters.  I have no plan to criticize those commenters who seem to hate this release.  The proper manners, if there is a consideration for procedure, seems to be to judge the film but not those who comment.  Wish old deleted scenes were added if available.  I can love this release for three reasons.  FIRST----- I have VHS tapes of the original if I need to see the original.  SECOND----- the movie are six in total.  They are a progression of film making technology over years of production.  Over thirty-five years now.  Change was always there over such a large time span.  Blu-ray certainly is brilliant.  THIRD-----It's a story.  Logic and science are bent greatly and that's an understatement.  It was meant to be fun not worshipped.  It still is fun and very successful because it is fun.  It is known well in parts of this planet that can play movies at home.  There are 3 dics, all blu-ray, of extras.  The third seems to have material not released before.  I enjoyed it very much.  Especially the Rose Bowl parade material.  Perfectionists need not apply.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is by far the most valuable app available, and it's free!  You can carry the entire Bible with you, including many translations, so you can read the version of your choice as well as compare translations as desired.  It is so simple to navigate.  Just choose the book of the Bible you want from the list,  then another list appears with all chapter numbers, then verse numbers.  When you read the verse, you have options to expand the chapter and continue reading.  You can add notes as well.  The app also includes many reading plans and daily devotions , which I love.  Topics include marriage, parenting, anger, debt, etc. as well as plans to read the whole Bible little by little.  This app has the potential to change your life by making your Bible reading more frequent and may change the lives of others as you always have a Bible with you to share.  Highly recommended!

1594202842|1.0|This book was contrived and her motivations in writing it are transparent.  She confessed to having written the first two thirds of it in just eight weeks and it shows.  I suspect that she was petitioned to write this book by some friend within the publishing industry for the same reasons that Muslims are being petitioned to churn out books in record numbers.  The American public is feeling culturally insecure and any theme which is critical of the American way of life will either be celebrated or will provoke controversy and therefore SELL SELL SELL.  Of course this book was not really critical or insightful or celebratory of either way of life.
B0056BU3I2|5.0|Nice!! This movie was wonderful finale to the Fast and Furious franchise. It had the potential to be an over-kill with all the players from the other films, but it worked out and remained true to the franchise's conception.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|It is a free app which makes it nice. I just wish the games had instructions on how to play. Some of them are hard to figure out. They do make it easy to gets points to unlock new games which is also nice. For example, I am getting 250,000 points for leaving this review. Nice tatic, but kind of corny. Over all, I would recommend this app to someone.
B003Y74AXO|3.0|The product is great for it's price, almmost 1/2 off some of the 3M ipad screen protection kits, but it has a downside. The cleaning cloth works great. A quick and easy way to get rid of all those fingerprints. The screen protector does not have very good adhesion though. Apple recommends to not use any cleaning products on their screens or it breaks them down over time, only the cleaning cloths. Went to install this product after about 2 weeks of using the ipad (from brand new) and the screen protector would not stick at all. It peeled right up. Might be best to go with a product like the 3M screen protectors for a little more money.

0312641893|4.0|What a very clever idea it was for this author to take a story which is so instantly familiar and transport it into an entirely different realm.  Cinder and the Prince?  She certainly didn't go wrong with that.  Add in some slight variations on the story with the characters (not all step sisters have to be horrible) and maybe change up your main character just the teeniest bit.  Actually that's a bit of irony because Cinder is totally different from any variation of Cinderella I've ever read.  I absolutely loved this book.<br /><br />So Cinder is a cyborg.  The cover of this book is absolute genius in letting the reader know instantly that this is not going to be the usual take on any body's fairy tale.  The prosthetic foot and hand are dealt with immediately, but other differences in the re-made Cinder are revealed more slowly.  Adding in the element of the inhabitants of the moon and making their queen be someone so thrillingly menacing simply adds to the excitement of the entire concept.<br /><br />I appreciated the fact that this novel is aimed at young adult readers from age twelve and up, in grades seven and up and this author never talks down to her reader, never sounds condescending, her dialog doesn't sound fake.  She has her characters speak in the modern language of the day, yet with moderation so the book will still be fresh and readable ten years from now.  Those things are all quite an accomplishment for a writer who is older than her target audience.  I was impressed and plan to recommend this book to two young ladies of my acquaintance who will enjoy it as much as I did.  Now I'm looking forward to the next exciting adventure of Cinder the cyborg.<br /><br />I received this book as a complimentary copy from the publisher.

B004SUSZB4|5.0|(This review was originally posted on Alexa Loves Books.)<br /><br />Cecelia Ahern is another Irish author, but one who I've come to love and appreciate. I thought the book was great! It's probably because the story calls out to the diehard romantic in my soul, focusing on undying, unconditional love as it does.<br /><br />Holly is an interesting character, riddled with positives and negatives. I like how Ahern showcases both of those sides to Holly throughout the book; but I especially enjoy getting a view of Holly's mourning process after losing her husband at such a young age. The journey she takes (that Gerry leads her on, of course) is fun to follow and I found myself rooting for Holly to be happy again.<br /><br />I love the supporting characters too though, especially John, Sharon, and Denise. John and Sharon are just the type of couple friends I would want to have in my life in the future. Denise, on the other hand, was a riot (especially with that incident while they were on vacation... but you'll have to read the book to find out what that is!). It was their colorful witticisms and the scenes that Holly shared with each of them that I enjoyed the most.<br /><br />I think, above everything, it was really the idea of the \\"list\\" that I enjoyed. Imagine having someone you love creating a list of things for you to do (or not do, as in the case of the 'spensive white dress) and attempting to accomplish them all? It was interesting to see which tasks Gerry would leave for Holly, as well as watching Holly face her hurdles and overcome them. In a way, it's quite inspiring - it makes me want to get out there and accomplish all those unspoken goals and things to do that I've been listing mentally for years. It's also very moving, as we get to see how Gerry, though he's gone, gets to help Holly move on with her life.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this book for fans of romance. It's a nice, fluffy read, perfect to bring along on a weekend trip.
1451648537|5.0|I have to confess that I have been a loyal fan of Apple since they first produced the Macintosh and I had 5 of them that ran my business back in the early '90's.  Sometimes people asked me why Apple ??  This book gives a further insight into the extraordinary vision that Steve Jobs had for the future of personal computing.  I enjoyed every moment and can recommend it to anyone who have/had doubts about why people should use this computer and maybe why they should embrace the other products that have made such a monumental change to the way we conduct our lives.  A great read about a great icon in our sometimes tawdry lifestyles.  This guy changed it all by making a dent on the universe and I shall read it again and again. Its an inspiration.

1423101499|5.0|(This review was originally posted on Alexa Loves Books)<br /><br />The one thing that I came to appreciate about this series is that each book has it's own specific adventure, which are all leading up the big finale in the next and final installment.  This book, The Battle of the Labyrinth, proves no different as it brings us more monsters, more secrets, more gods/goddesses and a big, action-packed story.<br /><br />Percy, Annabeth, Grover and Tyson set off on an adventure through the Labyrinth designed by the genius Daedalus, an adventure which brings them face to face with a great many horrors, but is necessary in order to prevent Luke from entering Camp Half-Blood and waging war through an entrance from the Labyrinth.<br /><br />As always, I was pleased with the amount of action and the variety of enemies that they encounter through this book, including Kampe (half-woman, half-dragon), a couple of empousai, telekhines.  It's always interesting to have a new type of enemy thrown in, especially when we draw on Greek mythology to understand what they are.<br /><br />The Labyrinth itself is already an interesting piece of work.  I love the concept of a maze that keeps building and growing and expanding, where you could encounter different types of architecture and pop out in different places upon using different entrances.  The whole concept fascinated me as much as it did Annabeth, although more from an imaginary standpoint as opposed to an architectural one.<br /><br />We welcome some of my favorite characters back in this book - Rachel Elizabeth Dare and Nico di Angelo.  I love Rachel because she's refreshingly and uniquely mortal, but able to see through the Mist; she's also a redhead and I have a particular fondness for them.  I love Nico, on the other hand, because he's just so cool (for a kid) - I mean, he's the freaking son of Hades and it doesn't really get more suave than that.<br /><br />The mystery of Pan (whom all the satyrs have been searching for) is resolved in this part of the series - and it's a resolution that I wasn't expecting, but am sort of pleased by.  It serves as a gentle reminder of the importance of believing in something, as well as taking action to preserve the world we live in.<br /><br />The book ends, as always, with a cliffhanger - and it's definitely one that'll make you want to go straight into reading the fifth book straightaway (which I did)!that I wasn't expecting, but am sort of pleased by.

B005LAJ16I|5.0|This is an american remake of the hit Israeli series Hatufim (Kidnapped). A soldier who had been kidnapped by terrorists has been brainwashed into becoming a terrorist himself. Brought back into the country as a brave hero, the soldier works his way toward the top of the country while a few dedicated patriots work to expose him. The stakes are the future of civilization itself. The show illustrates all too well that as war ends on the home ground of the terrorists, the terrorists will begin attacking our unprepared homeland again. If we do not fight them there, we will be fighting them here.  The series follows CIA officer Carrie Mathison who was brought home from Iraq for breaking the new rules written by politicians about how to fight the terrorists. She is put behind a desk in Virginia. Based on her Iraqi sources, she suspects a returning veteran has gone over to the terrorists. But the politicians refuse to accept it and she goes rogue to expose him working with Saul. The only other person in the CIA she can trust. She works with Saul to expose the mole inside the homeland before there is another 9/11.  While many people might have expected Claire Danes to end up playing a goodie-goodie repressed uberwoman CIA agent, she lets her freak flag fly. Rather than some stiff josephine Friday, she gives us a human character with real-world problems that everyone can relate to. Rather than being perfect, she has all the problems of a normal person. She is also adult enough to do whatever needs to be done in order to defeat the terrorists. She is not a child asking the chair-warmers and politicians for permission before saving the country. She is the face of the modern CIA and if we had a few hundred like her, the war on terror would be over quickly.  The praise for this series is universal. Sometimes its like watching a documentary or seeing footage from a spy camera. Its that real. Some people compare it to 24. But its far better than 24. Its the most realistic series ever done on the dangers of terrorism to our country.  Even President Obama, in an interview with People Magazine, said that Homeland was one of his top two must-see shows.

0142414999|3.0|(This review was originally posted on Alexa Loves Books.)<br /><br />This book is a collection of three stories, all of which are saccharinely sweet and geared, of course, towards happy endings.<br /><br />My favorite character from \\"Jubilee Line\\" by Maureen Johnson is Jubilee herself, who has an interesting name and ends up in a very intriguing situation - because of a massive snowstorm, she gets stuck in the middle of pretty much nowhere on a train.  After escaping to Waffle House, the story then follows her (mis)adventures in the company of Stuart, someone who's definitely not her boyfriend and who she isn't thinking about that way... or is she?  I enjoyed the ending of this story in particular!<br /><br />John Green's contribution, \\"A Cheertastic Christmas Miracle\\" was, hands down, my favorite of the bunch.  It's mostly about friendship (with a little romance thrown in, of course) and it's hilariously, absurdly amusing.  Three best friends - Tobin, JP and the Duke (who's a girl, in case you wanted to know) set out on a crazy attempt to get to the Waffle House in the middle of a snowstorm all to meet these so-called \\"hot\\" cheerleaders who are stranded there.  The story made me laugh out loud, and I definitely aww-ed at the ending.<br /><br />Lauren Myracle's story \\"The Patron Saint of Pigs\\" tied up the book neatly, bringing all the main characters from the other two stories into play, as well as focusing on characters that we've been wondering about since the start - Jeb and his girlfriend Addie.  Though the story was cute, I really didn't like it as much as the other two - except for the pig, of course!<br /><br />All in all, this book was pretty much as I expected it to be - fluffy, light, and an easy read.  I thoroughly enjoyed reading it, of course, but as with most books of this genre, the stories ended up blurring into one in my mind towards the end.

0545123291|4.0|The book prior to this one - Shiver - became one of my unexpected favorites when I first read it.  Linger was a brilliant continuation to the series, though it did not top the effect that the first book had on me.<br /><br />I liked the fact that we get to see a growth in the lives of some of the beloved characters from the first book in this one - we see Sam's struggle to deal with the fact that he's finally been cured; we watch the continued development of the lovely relationship between Grace and Sam; we see Grace's struggle as she grapples with the truth of her condition; we observe Isabelle's attempts to grow up and move past the things that have been haunting or (or at least be propelled forward by them).  I still hold a lot of affection for those three, and their characters in this book were as mesmerizing as always.<br /><br />I also have developed a new crush on Cole.  I do have a thing for the dangerous, bad boys in most books, I'll admit.  But what really made me like Cole towards the end (I felt he was quite distasteful at the beginning) was the revelation of the issues he was struggling with, as well as how he eventually, sort of anyway, came to terms with it.  He's now my favorite character and I can't wait to see what happens to him in Forever.<br /><br />The big twist that this novel revolves around (although I've been expecting it since the end of the last book) was portrayed quite realistically.  I feel for Grace as she struggles to come to terms with the changes occurring in her, and I feel for the people surrounding her who care about her.  It's such a sad, ironic, twisted way to end this second book - and I don't think it could have been done any better.<br /><br />The way the book ends definitely left me feeling a number of strong emotions - I was sad, I was relieved, I was smug (since I guessed what was happening already), I was angry (because it was such a huge cliffhanger, in its own way).  Of course, without a doubt, I'll be picking up the next and final installment in the series - Forever - which is being released on July 12, 2011.- Forever - which is being released on July 12, 2011.

The orchestra sounds perfect, the tempi are on the relaxed side but swift where it´s necessary. And the voices!!! Yes, Cherubino sounds too old, as other reviewers noticed. Other than that this is a indispensable collectible you don´t want to be without.

0385342055|4.0|(This review was originally posted on Alexa Loves Books.)<br /><br />I loved the Shopaholic series from the very beginning, and I've been with Becky Brandon (formerly Bloomwood) throughout all her crazy (mis)adventures in shopping. I was therefore looking forward to reading this book, in the hopes of finding out more about Becky and Luke's daughter Minnie - especially to see if she's anything like her mother.<br /><br />I don't know whether I'm pleased or displeased that the book focuses more on Becky than on Minnie.<br /><br />I still love Becky, and her quirky personality, crazy diatribes (in her head), her big heart of gold and her shopaholic tendencies are all accounted for and present in this book. This is something that I, as a loyal reader of the series, can appreciate. I found myself still laughing (and sometimes cringing) at her escapades, especially when it came to planning Luke's surprise birthday party and trying to deal with Minnie in the throes of the terrible twos.<br /><br />But I was expecting Minnie to be a little different, maybe a bit older. I wish she could have been able to speak properly for herself and well, show us even more explicitly how she takes after her mother or father. In fact, I was kind of expecting the story to revolve mostly around her and not Becky, which wasn't really the case. I did find it funny though, how, even at two years old, she's turning into a shopaholic too because Becky insists on giving her an advance on her allowance AND pretty much buying whatever Minnie wants (after justifying it in her head, of course).<br /><br />In any case, it was also nice welcoming a lot of familiar characters back - Luke, Danny, Tarkie, Suze, Jess, Tom, Janice, Mum, Dad and even Eleanor, who I now have a soft spot for.<br /><br />It's still a pleasure joining Becky for all of her adventures though, so I'd definitely recommend this book to fans of the Shopaholic series, as well as those looking for a nice, pleasant chick lit read.

142311339X|5.0|I've got to tell you - this has to be my favorite book by Rick Riordan so far.  Honestly, when I began the book, I had no idea where he was planning on leading us.  I was especially mystified by the position Jason was in and why he couldn't remember anything properly. It's written perfectly, revealing information bit by bit until we come to the (quite) epic conclusion in the end.  (And it's a conclusion well worth reading for!)<br /><br />Plus, alongside the newer characters of Jason, Piper and Leo, we've also got our old favorites in the book - Annabeth, Chiron, Clarisse, Thalia and many more.  I love reuniting with some of my old standbys, including Annabeth and Rachel.  It's also cool that a goddess we rarely saw in the Percy Jackson books - Hera - gets a major role in this one, as you'll discover when you read it.<br /><br />From the newer characters, I feel a special affinity with Piper - her character's pretty interesting and she's a daughter of Aphrodite.  How cool is that?  I love how she manages to realize a few things about the Aphrodite cabin, and how it's not just about beauty or romance, but so much more.<br /><br />Leo is entertaining; he's the funny one!  But it's also incredible what he manages to do with machines and little bolts and other pieces - which is obviously something that comes to him easily, being a song of Hephaestus.<br /><br />Oh Jason, Jason Grace, how I adore thee.  Just the idea of Jason, even when he's suffering from amnesia is already enough to make me swoon.  He seems to take to leadership easily, and has a commanding presence, even when he's not sure of what he's doing.  I think that's what made me develop a bit of a crush on him.<br /><br />There are so many twists and turns that I want to mention, but they would spoil the story for future readers of the book.  I am still on the edge of my seat after reading it and cannot wait for the next installment to come along!<br /><br />I recommend this book to fans of the Percy Jackson series, as well as middle grade/young adult readers who have a love for adventure and books with puzzling plots!<br /><br />(Based on Rick Riordan's site, the next installment - The Son of Neptune - is due in October 2011.)a love for adventure and books with puzzling plots!

B0002F6AH0|5.0|Until I saw this quite recently, I would have said that ken burns the war or ww2 a complete history were the best but I have to say I was wrong...This documentary is gripping, thrilling, and factual all wrapped together. It is a treasure trove of information on ww2 period! Very rarely do you see a documentary film this length and afterward be able to say \\"I watched this from start to finish without a dull moment.\\"  \\"Well I did and there wasn't a single part of the documentary, not enlightening.\\"<br /><br />The most important thing to me especially being that I'm only 30 and since this is such an older documentary is the commentary by eyewitnesses that generally are not around anymore today. Seeing much more interviews, with veterans of the ss, higher command and seeing Karl Doenitz on interview was probably the biggest seller for me..I didn't realize how few veterans are left to give there accounts anymore<br /><br />In a documentary I look for real footage, real accounts, and it's ability to keep your mind intrigued enough to find it impossible for me to turn off.For this to happen, it has to have many facts without peoples opinions and or bias. Footage that is both rare and gripping, also accounts from real veterans backing up the facts as they go along. I'm happy to say that this has all and more than expected...I sat motionless watching this, personally I really enjoyed the wolfpack: episode. Most information you get on the russian front and north africa is alone worth buying..<br /><br />The list is as follows:<br /><br />:1.

1423101502|5.0|The last and final installment in the Percy Jackson series is a particularly good way to end a series (if such a conundrum exists).  It's filled with more adventure, friendships, clever twists and turns of events and a good ending.  I couldn't put the book down once I started it - any fan of the series will attest to this, I'm certain.<br /><br />With a rousing large rabble of characters - gods, demigods, monsters and mortals - there was an incredible amount of information to absorb.  I appreciate that more campers were given a chance to step up in this book (unlike previously when the books usually focused on the campers on missions or on errant campers), especially in the showdown battle that occurs in Manhattan.  It made for a good read, seeing new personalities or personalities we've barely heard about, come to life in the fight to save Mt. Olympus.<br /><br />It was crazy trying to figure out what the prophecy really meant - especially after Rachel's revelation.  I couldn't figure it out, so when it did finally end up playing out in the way that it was meant to, I was left stunned.  I was left completely, entirely stunned.  (In fact, even during my re-reading, I still found it so clever how the prophecy actually meant to end that way.  Kudos to Rick Riordan - I did not see that coming!)<br /><br />The way the book wraps up is great too; we're left with resolutions for every single character (I particularly enjoy Rachel's new role and the Percy-Annabeth relationship), but there's also a hint of possibility for a new book (because of the new prophecy unleashed in the last few pages).<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this book - it's a brilliant read, a wonderful blend of reality and imagination, especially in a middle grade novel.
1416550534|5.0|Perfect gothic fiction. A wonderful haunting escape. I was actually a slight bit sad to say good bye to the characters when the book ended. I think Kate Morton is going to be my new favorite author!

B005XQLBU4|3.0|I spent many hours at the arcade and later on Atari playing Missile Command :)  As other reviewers have noted, this game genre is greatly enhanced with touchscreen controls.  This game is a nicely rendered update and gameplay is good.  However, I had previously installed Warheads and prefer its presentation over this one, so in the need to manage low space have removed this one.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I bought this because I was intrigued by the upcoming movie.  I know movies are never as good as the book, so I bought the book. Boy, oh boy, was I surprised.  I could literally not put down my Kindle.  This book has it all; imagination, fantasy, sci-fi, love, adventure, surprises, and, of course, Big Brother.  What else could you ask for, and, a girl/woman warrior.  A girl/woman hero is appreciated as I am a woman, and it is a good role model, as many times brute strength can be overcome by using your mind.  I absolutely loved this book, and I can't see anyone being disappointed, unless you just read non-fiction.
075695195X|5.0|I never thought of reading this series, despite having spotted it in various bookstores over the years. Now that I've finally mustered up enough will to read it, I'm only sad that I didn't read it sooner! The books are written in a pleasant, witty manner that's different from what I've read before and the story is fantastically told, showcasing the author's imaginative ideas beautifully.<br /><br />Honestly, I didn't think I would like the book too much because it seemed like a \\"boy\\" book. I know, I know, you're never supposed to judge a book by its cover, but I admit I did it with this one and that I was entirely wrong. The book is a great read for fans of fantasy, magic and adventure - the book provides all three in astonishing increments, and therefore tickled my fancy.<br /><br />I adore the character of Bartimaeus, the djinni in the book. (Before I continue - honestly, I could care less about Nathaniel, the boy magician who's the main character. Maybe I'm just annoyed by his personality? I'm not sure). Anyway, I LOVE Bartimaeus - I find him incredibly funny, witty and bearing a razor sharp perspective on things. He's basically the reason I managed to read through this book as fast as I did - I always joined seeing things from his point of view.<br /><br />That having been said, the plot is carried out quite brilliantly - and left to reveal a subplot brewing underneath at the end (which obviously links it to the second and third book). Stroud did a great job of weaving all these individual stories into one big one in a way that makes sense to the reader. He also brought to life the world that the book is located in, as well as giving pertinent details of scenarios, people and objects.<br /><br />Honestly, I can't help gushing about it. This book is brilliant - and definitely something I would recommend.
B0066NA8CU|5.0|This show has one of the most captivating cast I have seen in a long time.  When I heard Chris Noth and Christine Baranski were in the cast, I knew this was going to be a great show, but before it was over I was hooked.  I record the show every Sunday so I can skip through the commercials. Thanks to the writers and director for creating a show that keeps you wanting more.  I enjoy everyone of the cast members, they work so well together, no one seems out of place. No one should judge Alicia for taking charge of her own life and falling for Will (what a hunk). The kids are teenagers and going in their own direction and Alicia has to make time for herself.  If you have not watched this show, YOU need to calendar for this coming Sunday.  I am unable to list one scene that I like more than the others, but I do enjoy the courtroom battles and always enjoy when Lockhard,Gardner come out the winner.  Now I can watch the show without interuptions and on my time.

0307949508|5.0|It was a great trilogy with a perfect ending. Really sad that this is the end for the series. I would strongly recommend for anyone looking for a great read.
0786838655|5.0|(This review was originally posted on Alexa Loves Books.)<br /><br />There's already been so much that's been said about this series, but I still feel like putting my own two cents in - especially seeing as how this is probably the fourth or fifth time I've read it.<br /><br />The concept behind the series itself is brilliant.  Greek mythology meets modern-day world? Hell yes!  It's one of those situations where I wish I had thought of it first; but I can appreciate what Rick Riordan has done in bringing it all together for the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series.  As someone who's always been fascinated with the gods and goddesses of Greek myths, it's definitely fun to see them come alive in these books, and be given such specific personas.<br /><br />The first book is a great introduction to a whole host of fantastic characters: Percy (our MC, who finds that he's the Son of Poseidon), Annabeth (my personal favorite character, a daughter of Athena who's smart and sassy), Grover (a satyr, who is guardian to Percy), Chiron (a centuar) and as many Greek gods and goddesses as you would want to suit your fancy - everyone from King Zeus to Hermes the messenger and Iris, goddess of the rainbow.<br /><br />Apart from that, we go to a great number of interesting locations - Mt. Olympus (which is apparently located above the Empire State Building), the Underworld and Camp Half-Blood, being just a few.  Even though Riordan leans towards more action-packed scenes, the descriptions are still enough to provide a beautiful visualization to the reader.<br /><br />The book covers Percy's discovery of his god ancestry, his introduction to Camp Half-Blood where kids like him are sent for training, and his journey to retrieve Zeus' lightning bolt after being accused of stealing it (including uncovering a mysteriously larger conspiracy behind this theft!).  Though it might seem like a lot to pack into one book, I think all these things are brought out and resolved quite well throughout the book.<br /><br />Percy's an \\"underdog\\" hero, similar to Harry Potter in that sense at least (although I can't see how else they would be similar at all, as Harry is from the world of wizardry and Percy's world revolves more around mythology).  It's easy to want to root for him, to see him succeed and to feel his losses as keenly as he does.<br /><br />It's enjoyable for me to see him battling some interesting opponents early on in the series, including Medusa, Ares and the Furies.  The action scenes are a lot of fun and watching Percy using both brains and brawn was a lot of fun.  It also helps that he has his best friends (Annabeth and Grover) fighting alongside him - their trio definitely makes for an interesting combination throughout the book.<br /><br />Overall, this is a book that I could not put down... even when I read it for the fifth time.  I get instantly absorbed into the story; it's definitely a series I'd recommend for fans of Greek mythology, underdog heroes, as well as even recommending it to the younger, middle grade audience.to Harry Potter in that sense at least (although I can't see how else they would be similar at all, as Harry is from the world of wizardry and Percy's world revolves more around mythology).

B006SVHOL8|3.0|It was a ok watch at best, nothing really special. Had periods where it sort of...dragged...for lack of a better word and the ending seemed to be liked rushed...like the time limit of the movie was up or something? So, its just ok...not one of the better ones.
B004EPZ070|5.0|One of the best movies I've seen so far.  It's not your typical girly movie. Lot's of funny scenes and I think it's better than the book.  I ordered it and got it right away from Amazon.
0525478817|5.0|I bought TFIOS in one of the stores where their tour will be, and mine was, alas, unsigned. Good news for me is that I had, on the ride to the store, seen the description of what to do if it's NOT signed in the book release video on their channel (vlogbrothers). In short, email the author at sparksflyup(at)gmail(dot)com and give the following information:  1)Your name  2)Your address  3)Where you bought the book  It may be a good idea to take a photo of your receipt or a quick low-res flip through of the blank pages before the book starts... but the where you got it is very important on the distributor end; the problem is a distributor problem. He did sign 150k pages to go in the front of the book... but some of the distributors apparently failed to include them when binding the final product together--my guess is they printed them prematurely (it's obviously a bad idea to try printing everything in one place then shipping thousands of miles when you can print a hundred miles from major hubs instead)... He's fixing the problem; just \\"Keep calm and DFTBA\\" and you'll be rewarded for awesome.  The book... well, 223 people have already said what I could and more. What I WILL say is that it is NOT simply a \\"children's\\" book and should not be limited to something-kids-read... Sure, I enjoy DFW and Vonnegut (Kurt, not the cousin twice removed who did Gods of Greenwich). That does not make this any less a great book for anyone ~15 and up than it makes all the classics we happened to read in grade school. While much of the content is modern (the Internet exists in his works; somehow America's Next Top Model got mentioned without any odd copyright blockage; this isn't a Moulin Rouge story where someone simply suffers-modern drugs/hospital facilities are part of the routine), there are layers of depth that defy calling this kid's fiction or temporary pop literature that will be forgotten in 100 years. Like the works of Gaiman, I truly hope this isn't forgotten, as it's the most honest look I've seen at the subject matter but despite lives revolving around cancer, the story is not strong because of how it tackles cancer.  TFIOS is strong because of what John Green's just-plain-GOOD-at, creating characters you care deeply about. It doesn't make you cry just to make you cry or force laughter, either. The main characters are fleshed out so well that you laugh and cry because you're sucked into their world and \\"get it\\" at any given moment, whatever the \\"it\\" may be. You could read it, not emotionally attach to the characters, and still say, \\"Wow, that was really well-done\\" because it IS well-done. However, you more than likely will find yourself genuinely liking and connecting with the characters. What I appreciate most (and other oldies like me that have read it and talked with me about it have agreed on this point) is that despite being far, far older than the protagonists, I'm not reading it from the outside; I'm not simply connecting with the pain of the parents or the quirky beautiful connection Hazel and her father share from quite early on. I connect more with the youth and again this comes down to a strength, a conscientious effort, in Green's writing: he honors youth instead of simplifying them. He doesn't dumb down their experiences, whether they are trivial, serious, light, or exasperating. He keeps them genuine and doesn't talk down to his readers or tell the story's importance TO you. He lets every reader, from the youngest to the oldest, find the meaning themselves; he doesn't frustrate with the annoyance of things like explaining every bit of history you might not know--he lets you get interested and look it up yourself. This book deserves full engagement and will get a couple more reads by me before winter's up, as I know there is much that, despite taking my time reading, I want to delve further into (well, what isn't purely fictional). This book is worth owning, and I say that as someone who has taken to donating my funds tothe library and reading materials then sending them back to be shared by any and all. I'm glad I bought two copies, not just for the two tickets to the event, either... This will be an extremely special gift, and if someone you know does enjoy reading novels, this is one book I give a very rare 5 stars and full endorsement (if they enjoyed The Hunger Games, another I don't think is \\"JUST young adult friendly,\\" the way people care about Katniss/Gale/etc is how I can best sum up how they'll care about Hazel/Augustus/etc).
B001UV4XHY|5.0|This, along with part II, finishes off the Harry Potter story. Alone, it seems a bit of a bore, but combined with part II, it fits nicely into the story. You definitely need both parts of the Deathly Hallows if you want to find out how the film version turns out as they contain twists that turn the story on its head.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|A great game for wasting time.  lots of different games to play. great for kids too. happy gaming to everyone.
B001414XLQ|5.0|I LOVE THIS FRICKIN' ALBUM! System Of A Down is my second favorite band (second only to Three Days Grace) and this album is my favorite by SOAD. They've really outdone themselves for their sophomore album. When I first bought the CD, I was getting it for the song \\"Aerials\\", but when I listened to the rest of the CD, I was blown away. I had fallen in love with two other songs \\"Toxicity\\" and \\"Science\\". I was also amazed at how short some of these tracks were. \\"Shimmy\\" was only a minute and fifty seconds long! In summary, I would definitely recommend this album to anyone who loves System Of A Down, or if you're just a fan of rock itself.

B00003CXI1|5.0|This is a good beginning to the screen version of the Harry Potter story, which I like so much that I am afraid to re-read the books, as the book and screen versions are different. They did an excellent job of unfolding the story and of creating the scenery. I found deleted scenes deserved to be deleted and were not worth watching but the documentary part with interviews and with explanations was well worth seeing.
0385535139|5.0|I loved this book, and was pleasantly surprised that the author found a way to show the plus side of lawyering as well as the underbelly of same. My three favorite characters in the story were the bartender, the young lawyer, David, and his wife, Helen. Decent people, all three. The others, not so much. Highly recommended.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it takes time but the different games makes it easy not to get tired of it. the only draw back is each level it takes more and more time to get new games and it's frustrating when you have to play the same old games over and over just to get ONE new one.
0525478817|5.0|I thought this book was really excellent. I don't want any spoilers so I'll just say that this book was really moving and thoughtful, and that it is not just a book for teenagers, but for all ages (seeing as I'm not a teenager myself!). This is my second John Green book and he continues to prove that he has a real mastering of the english language and the human condition.

B005J29HCQ|5.0|It is tempting to say that this disc's release is anticlimactic. We have the \\"[[ASIN:B00005ABX0 Smiley Smile / Wild Honey]]\\" version (along with the various track in the subsequent albums: [[ASIN:B00005ABWY Friends / 20/20]] [[ASIN:B00004TJXS Sunflower / Surf's Up]] ). Then there are the bootlegs. Nineteen ninety-three gave us a partial release ([[ASIN:B000002UR4 Good Vibrations: Thirty Years Of The Beach Boys]]), and 11 years later, Brian Wilson recorded his solo version ([[ASIN:B0002LI11M Smile]]).<br /><br />So, the SMiLE gap has long been filled. And, we can say that with the 2004 version, the case is closed, and the disc released.<br /><br />But there is more going on. Closure, yes. And I applaud Capitol for keeping the vintage cover, and even sticking with the bootleg names (\\"Do you like Worms?\\" and \\"Look\\"). After all, those are the names most of us grew-up with.<br /><br />But there is the moral victory.  Mike was wrong; Brian was right. And the hatchet is finally buried. Now let's get on, have the 50th Anniversary Reunion Tour, and cut another album with the surviving members. The decades-old wounds are healed.<br /><br />So to the disc. Due to the economy, I got the bare-bones version. And it meets my needs. I have the album, I have some key oddball tracks (such as \\"You're Welcome\\"), the advert blips, and disc 2's sessions tracks. I'm happy.<br /><br />And I am also surprised: the album was 85% of the way there. \\"Do You Like Worms/Plymouth Rock,\\" \\"Child is Father of the Man,\\" \\"Holidays,\\" \\"I Love To Say Da-Da\\"--a mere  four tracks that were missing vocals.<br /><br />That's it. Everything else was in place and ready for release.<br /><br />There may be a lesson here--if you are 85% of the way, then Capitol should have encouraged him to finish it (or release it as a Brian Wilson solo project, as they did with \\"[[ASIN:B000TDYLVM Caroline, No (1999 Digital Remaster)]]\\"), been content with the [[ASIN:B000RRICPG The Best of the Beach Boys]]) recycles, and been honest about the changing times.<br /><br />And a lot can be said about the bureaucratic mindsets and the push for commerciality. Ridged artistic models are as deadly as rigid business modes, as Collins points out ([[ASIN:B000OEZ88G Built To Last: Successful Habits Of Visionary Companies]]). Mike and Capitol won the battle, but lost everything else because the times were changing. It was time for the Beach Boys to become Beach, and age with the audience--as the Stones, Madonna, and U2 have successfully done.<br /><br />Enough of my rant.<br /><br />So, I'm glad (pun intended--see Wild Honey, track 2), and grateful it is out. And, on a deep level, I  enjoy the mystical twist they put on America.

B005974CNA|5.0|Yea know opinions are just that; a person individual assessment of others sweat blood and tears, so here is mine. I respect that some on this board have posted poor reviews of this DT work, but I believe those people are sniffing the fumes of their own farts.  Yea the band has changed, but in my opinion you can not say it has changed for the worst. I LOVE THIS NEW ALBUM, and I am grateful that DT is still out there making PR music. This album is another wonderful musical journey. It contains all of the highs and lows that we have come to love from DT.  On every album release I read review by people obviously jealous that they are not living the dream like DT, instead they make the same vitriol comments and think that it will somehow elevate them up as some sorta expert.  Bottom line if you like high end quality music you will Love this album. Now I'm not going to choose a favorite or try to dissect the musical inspiration, but I will say that I have found all of my DT music collection to hit the mark for any given mood.. So what are you waiting for buy this album, you may be able to buy it from one of the jerks on this board that posted poor reviews.

She<br />s totally my type and probably top 3 best looking actress today if not the hottest. But to my suprise this film was packed with action, skill, a decent storyline and plot. There were a few guys who could have done a better job acting and would have been cool to see some people survive but like i said before I was very suprisingly happy with the outcome of this movie in general. I gave it 5 stars because i feel it's not just another dumb movie with an incredibly hot actress. It's actually an amazing movie with an amazing actress who is beautiful, gorgeous, a TEN.

Now that I've read his latest - 11/22/63 - I'm back again!  No scary monsters here but for the obdurate nature of time resisting changes to the past.  Nothing to be trifled with!  I will look forward to more!

B0062NAVXA|5.0|Five stars for movie: (review of the movie following)  One star for format: (Skip to * to read more about my thoughts on the UltraViolet stuff.  This is one of the best movies I have ever seen, and I have seen a wide variety of them in my time-good ones and bad ones. I've even been part of a film team and worked on the process of creating a film.  It starts out with a bang that grabs you (and surprises you!) and you get completely immersed in the story. I did not see the tragedy coming (and I am usually pretty good at spotting these a mile away.) There were many scenes in which I cried, and even more where I was laughing SO hard. I LOVE Xavier-favorite character. Do NOT see this as stereotypical as one person said. Pretty hard to be stereotypical when there is only ONE family-that is the way they live, they are poor, struggling, haven't had work in awhile. That's why they eat rice and beans! (Ever hear of Dave Ramsey?!)  I love what this movie portrays, and there are many topics it covers. Men being the fathers in their home-ACTIVE fathers, not just \\"there\\" fathers. Dads taking an active role in protecting their daughters and teaching them about their worth. Taking responsibility for your actions, and also, work to provide for family.  *If I were reviewing the FORMAT of this item, the Ultraviolet, I would give it a one-star. I researched this UV stuff before buying this particular item/format. I did not see anything that would make me think that is was ONLY for certain devices/computers. I checked the system requirements, and I meet or exceed all those. However, today, once the movie arrived, and I registered for my UV/Sony account, I cannot add a device. Instead this is what it says, \\"UltraViolet titles will soon be available from all UltraViolet participating retailers in a standard downloadable file format that will work on all UltraViolet-compatible media players apps and devices, and which can be copied from one UltraViolet-compatible app/device to another.\\"  ON FAQs, the Q is, \\"Will I need to purchase special equipment\\" the answer is: \\"Many existing players and apps on computers and smartphones are upgradeable to support UltraViolet. Players that work with UltraViolet right out of the box will be available, and you may be interested in making such a feature one of your \\"checklist\\" items when buying new devices.\\" In other words, most likely, my devices need to be UPGRADED AND other items WILL BE AVAILABLE, but ARE NOT NOW!!!!  I would look for a different format and wait until you HAVE a UV capable device. I can still stream online and thank goodness we have DSL and wi-fi in our house, but we are not able to download it to our computer OR any other device as we were led to believe. Very disappointed in this. I had hoped it would be like a digital copy like many others are: a disc that you insert to your computer and enter a code to unlock that copy. Sadly, it is not. Please: don't make the same mistake.

0385341008|4.0|What a delightful book! Set just after the end of World War II, \\"The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society\\" tells the story of London-based Juliet, an intellectual authoress who forms an unusual connection with some residents of Guernsey. Through her correspondence with members of the Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society, Juliet becomes infatuated with their stories about surviving German occupation...and the stories of those who didn't survive. Juliet eventually travels to Guernsey and instantly feels at home with this community, but still faces many major decisions about her own future.<br /><br />The best thing about this book is the wonderful narrative, which is told entirely through letters (and a few telegrams). The writing is so wonderful and the characters so colorful that, like Juliet, I came to feel like I knew all of these people simply by reading their written words. Unfortunately, once Juliet actually arrived at Guernsey, I thought the pacing of the novel slowed down a bit, and I began to lose interest. I am also not sure that the couple at the end of the book is super believable, but oh well. I still enjoyed the book and look forward to seeing the film adaptation (starring Kate Winslet!).

B005DMNS4A|5.0|This is one of the landmark pieces of music in modern popular culture. Those who are reviewing negatively regarding remastering issues have a right to your opinions. But when I saw this masterpiece only has 3 stars as average, I felt sad. I wish I could give more than 5 stars, and I mean that even with my own set of reservations about the need for this reissue nagging just beneath the surface. But come on folks, those who do not know this record should hear it. Give it 5 for the music and then register your complaints. My reasoning is that a flawed copy of this is better than anything else being released these days. If you're reading this, you probably know that, though.

B004XNGKBS|5.0|This is a WONDERFUL APP.  It does what it says and in my opinion, is awesome for any kind of note, entry, etc. It also has a bunch of other things you can do like change the color, faunt, size, add attachments, and much, much more.  I highly reccomend it..... it should cost much more than a dollar!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This book, by Chris Kyle, is a riveting story about the Iraq War from the front lines - from an individual who was there getting shot at and seeing his buddies get wounded and killed.  Yes, he killed a lot of the \\"savages\\", as he calls them but it was to save the lives of other Americans who were in harms way.  He is a true American Hero.  Someone that we should all look up to.  Chris Kyle was there in all the major actions of the Iraq War: the starting invasion, Fallujah, Ramadi, and the end in Sadr City.  He saw it all and experienced what no man should have to experience and he did it for us - his fellow Americans and his fellow soldiers.  The stories are riveting.  The firefights are told in such detail that you almost feel that you are there. When he related the story about the Marine who was gut shot and died in his arms, it almost made me cry.  And, the stories about his buddies getting shot - Ryan Job and Marc Lee...  I can see why he was remorseless in killing the \\"savages\\" - many times in the book, he wrote: \\"I dropped him.\\"  The impact on his family life too was eye-opening.  At times, he let his wife, Taya, write her experiences and what she was feeling at different times.  The one time that he called her and a firefight occurred and he thought that he hung up but he didn't, and she heard the whole thing on the phone...  She is a true American Hero also for supporting him through four tours over there.  In the dedication, Chris Kyle writes: \\"I would like to dedicate this to the memory of my SEAL brothers Marc and Ryan, for their courageous service to our country and their undying friendship to me.  I will bleed for their deaths the rest of my life.\\"  Having never been in combat, I can't even fathom the experiences that he, his fellow SEALS, Marines and Army warriors went through over there.  But, I can thank him and his wife for writing this book and at least giving us a glimpse over what it was like to live this.  This book should be a classic on war and warriors - an excellent story about the heroism and tragedy of war.

0385534639|3.0|Yes, it is all a dream -- a beautiful and somewhat unsettling dream, but still just a collage of beautiful prose and description.  I noted the unusual amount written in the present tense and the confusion in time and space.  The book is loaded with very obvious symbolism, but it never effectively conveys a meaningful message.  The character development is very poor and one dimensional. I would recommend this book to readers looking for beautiful description and fantasy, but would not recommend it to readers that are looking for deep meanings and insights.
1934030198|5.0|I'm only 75 pages into this book so far. However, I am amazed at the depth of detail that there is to know and consider for training. I haven't read a lot of books on training but was told this is the best and I have nothing to compete with that comment in my reading so far. Very good read for someone who is serious about training and triathloning. There is also a wealth of knowledge for people who are doing sports training (run, bike, swim) but focusing on one of the three, or combined. I'm excited to finish - it's all useful and helpful information. No fluff, and well written.

B005V2EVBQ|4.0|Not a cheaply made product.  Impressed by quality, tolerancing, and great fit.  Seems a little flimsy, which is expected when advertised as \\"lightweight\\", but overall it offers great protection, utility, and feel for such a low profile.  Only downside I've noticed is that the stand can sometimes come undone when bumped.

0393072231|4.0|I love Michael Lewis' style and subjects. This one is a keeper, but not one of his best books (such as \\"Liar's Poker\\"). It seems to be largely an edited collection of the articles Michael did for Vanity Fair. It falls in the subcategory of: \\"Great Recession Was Caused By This One Thing\\" books. As such it is one-dimensional and should be enjoyed as intended. I will expand upon this below.<br /><br />In this book Michael does what he always does well: makes the most arcane and byzantine finance/securities products/subjects both easily understandable (or at least tries to) and humorous. In this book he deals with Collateralized Debt Obligations (\\"a credit laundering service for the residents of Lower Middle Class America, for Wall Street it was a machine that turned lead into gold\\"), Credit Default Swaps,and similar vehicles that, in this book, comprise the \\"thing\\" that crashed the world - \\"the Doomsday Machine\\" of the subtitle. These sections of the book are terrific.<br /><br />He introduces us to some of the strangest, and in a couple instances most unsavory, true characters that he's ever written about. These sections of the book were difficult for me to wade through. If I don't care about or don't like people in a book, I find it difficult to keep interested.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I can't give the book 5 stars. It is good if you want to be somewhat entertained and come away with a better understanding about some exotic (and toxic!) financial instruments. But is doesn't really do justice to the number of other things that actually caused the crisis. Michael writes about the world that he knows, but he only touches on things that brought about the Great Recession besides the instruments he describes so well. But it wasn't all caused by market failure. Off the top of my head I can think of 5 non-market drivers: (1) Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac credit policies (driven by Congressional mandates to increase home ownership) - including guaranteeing Alt-A mortgages; (2) Past government bailouts of large financial companies - \\"too big to fail\\" mentality; (3) Basel capital rules; (4) Artificially low Federal Funds Rate from 2001-on; and (5) Higher FDIC deposit insurance (particularly after 2003).<br /><br />Finally, as a finance professor but also as an entrepreneur, I can guarantee that there is way, way too much leverage in the financial system (i.e. borrowing other peoples' money to allow out-sized gains) that is not hedged properly, nor do the risk management models properly reflect the possibility of catastrophic events. I'm afraid that even heightened government involvement will not solve this problem. There seems to me to be a systemic problem that won't go away until the reliance on leverage and debt (governments themselves are the primary culprits for the latter) is lessened.t government bailouts of large financial companies - \\"too big to fail\\" mentality; (3) Basel capital rules; (4) Artificially low Federal Funds Rate from 2001-on; and (5) Higher FDIC deposit insurance (particularly after 2003).<br /><br />Finally, as a finance professor but also as an entrepreneur, I can guarantee that there is way, way too much leverage in the financial system (i.e. borrowing other peoples' money to allow out-sized gains) that is not hedged properly, nor do the risk management models properly reflect the possibility of catastrophic events.

B001VFTYW8|2.0|I typically go between James Patterson and Patricia Cornwell books on my Kindle... after reading almost exclusively James Patterson for the past 6 months I went back to Patricia Cornwell and purchased this book.  It took me over a week to finish this book (usually it takes me 3 of 4 days.)  It just didn't hold my interest and the ending was way too abrupt.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|Let me begin by saying that I have not read all of King's work.  I have not read The Stand (I actually just bought it to start reading -I mention The Stand because I see great reviews on it, but I can't compare this book to it since I haven't read it).  I have read a lot of his books though, and this one is my favorite so far.  While reading this book, I actually felt like I was with the main character on his journey.  I'm trying to be careful not to give anything away, so my review may not be as helpful as you'd like.  I can try to tell you what my taste is: I like Stephen King, John Grisham, and I liked the Harry Potter books.  (I also really liked the LOST television series).  I spent just about every free minute of this past weekend reading 11/22/63 and even though I really wanted to know what happened at the end, I was kind of sad when it was over. My sister had given me a book that she had by Mary Higgins Clark, but (forgive me if you are a fan)after reading 11/22/63, I have been forcing myself to read her book the past two nights and I found it to be boring in comparison (again, only my opinion so please don't take offense if you like her work).  I gave up on that and just went ahead and bought The Stand. 11/22/63 was probably my favorite book ever by any author.  Also, Stephen King said that the part of the book regarding the details of the assasination are based on facts; he did a lot of research to write the book.
0525478817|5.0|Every book of John Green's has come out has done so at a time in my life when I needed it most. It's taught me some valuable lesson that has helped me in life and this book is no different. I'm not going to delve into the plot of the book, you can look to someone else for that. I'm just going to state the reasons why I love this book. Except that words can't describe how much this book means to me. I can't find the words to say how I love this book, or how fun it was to stay up until 4AM reading this, laughing and crying and smiling and just living through these events with the characters. It takes a book that is really special for me to forget all of my troubles, forget that I'm reading a book and just be there as things are happening. It takes a really special book for me to forget all the suck that happened in a day and just focus on John's wonderful prose that mixes humor with sadness, tragedy with reality and never once feels trite or anything but real.

B0061S073A|4.0|I have a little preschooler who loves to buy movies and apps. now I don't have to worry about little shopping spree anymore!
0525478817|5.0|Thank God it finally arrived!  My 15-year old and her friends are all nuts about John Green and have been reading and talking about the book since it came out.  They have uploaded pictures of themselves opening the Amazon package which the author then wove together in a video montage, and they have forsaken homework and eating so that they can continue reading.  My daughter also insists on telling me the storyline at every opportunity. Apparently this author has the magic touch!
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|spoilers. this book started out with great potential. katniss was finally in a setting where she could take some control of the plot and really develop into a full character without the all encompassing Â«need to surviveÂ» thing that was keeping her flat and dominated the first two books...  there was also a great opportunity to develop the relationship between gale and katniss which i was very excited for. katniss was also with her mother and sister which had alot of potential for character development and interaction as they were hardly in the previous books. unfortunately none of this happened. as a matter of fact nothing much happened throughout the book. i was waiting for the endless mental/psychological torment of katniss to end so the plot could move on...i mean i know she cared about peeta but for goodness sake it was ridiculous! considering she had gale and her family and a chance to fight the capitol...  but thats not all. the plot itself was sloppy and all to convient...patches of action thrown in at places that dont make sense...and the characters like gale and prim got ripped off and ignored, only there in name. the author obviously had no idea where to go with the plot or how to end things so it rambled and went nowhere...then she just started killing off tons of people at the end...and it was just a huge disappointed, badly written, and i hope the movie can somehow fix this mess from the author.

B00526ZKYS|4.0|Really 4.5 stars for this one! This was way better than I expected. A fantastic premise and a really  well written cast of characters make this one of the better dystopian / romance YA books I have ever read. This book is beautiful, haunting and utterly heart breaking.<br /><br />If you're looking for a super action packed dystopian adventure, skip out on this one because there isn't too much action. It's more of an internal look at romance in a dystopian society, and there is a heavy emphasis on the romance which was a nice change for me although got slightly taxing of course until that amazing ending.<br /><br />I can't wait for Pandemonium even though I'm a little terrified that my worst nightmare from the end of this book will turn out to be a sad reality in the second book. But my curiosity to see how it plays out will win me over. I just hope that Pandemonium doesn't end up being like Mockingjay and being so depressing that I want to forget I ever read it!

B0054U56B4|3.0|Well, well Ethan Wate. You basically get dumped and spend an entire book pining after a girl with some serious issues. Don't get me wrong, I thought you were cute and charming in the first book but now you just sort of seem pathetic. Meanwhile, you're best friend is getting more and more interesting by the second and same goes for his girl Ridley.<br /><br />Anyways, yeah so this was still just three stars for me. While I think the plot was a little more boring and less organized than the first book, I think the character development in this one was better than Beautiful Creatures.<br /><br />I find it frustrating in books when I enjoy the secondary characters more than the primary ones. I know that happens a lot, but in this instance, I really feel that Ethan and Lena are the least developed characters and that makes this story suffer.<br /><br />I will no doubt read the last in the series because I've made it this far and I might as well find out! Plus one of my favorite characters from the first finally makes a reappearance in this one and I'm hoping there'll be more of him/her in Beautiful Chaos!<br /><br />In terms of the writing style, I've read books by two authors before and this is the only one I've read so far where I could honestly see a difference in writing styles. I kept coming in and out of interest, and I'd love to know who's writing was capturing my attention more!

0385504225|3.0|This wasn't a terrible book but it seemed like Dan Brown just took the template of his two previous Robert Langdon books and changed some parts/theme around and published this book. From reading Angels and Demons and The DaVinci Code, I have no doubt Dan Brown is a good author. However, he needs to step it up in the Robert Langdon series if he wants his readers to be wowed and not just write in the same structure.

Don't get me wrong, I love those books too but it's nice to mix it up a bit or storylines end up blending together for me. On top of the refreshing change, this story was surprisingly free of all things I abhor about your typical fiction these days: love triangles and cliffhangers.<br /><br />I felt that this was an extremely well written story full of snarky lines that I love so much. The relationship between Atticus and Oberon (his wolfhound) was borderline adorable. They were more on a friend level than owner/pet; considering that they were able to speak to each other with their minds probably had something to do with it. I also enjoyed how the gods and goddesses speech was entirely different than mere mortals and how formal and full of thought they seemed to give each line.<br /><br />\\"He came out of a building called `Crussh,' holding one of these potions.

B005GFPZYK|2.0|This book lacks the bits of insight you may think should come from a sniper book.  The author has defknetly done his time and has considerable combat experience but you will only hear what would be in an after action report.  Surprising lack of detail from someone trained to notice detail.  The usual SEAL egoism is present but actually softened then other SEAL books.  The author also includes text written by his wife that I totally skipped.  The book \\"Shooter\\" was a much better book on the subject.

If you have a complete lens kit for your camera, there really isn't any other bag that you should buy because you're going to upgrade to this bag anyway. The price is great for how well constructed this is. It's a little heavy, but the shoulder strap is very comfortable and I've carried this bag fully loaded half a mile before with a medium amount of fatigue. For distances from a car to anywhere close, you won't even notice it's weight. I uploaded two images with notes to help identify how I fit everything in this bag.

0439023521|5.0|Katniss Everdeen isn't your average heroine. Don't take the hype for this book to mean that it is another overrated romance like Twilight. Bella Swan and Katniss couldn't have any less in common, which to be honest, is awesome. I had my doubts, since there was so much hype about it, but the first installment of the Hunger Games is a very compelling story that will have you furiously turning pages to the very end.  In the ruins of North America, the nation of Panem rules the twelve districts from the shining Capitol. Panem is harsh, enforcing their laws with a strict hand and forcing the citizens to engage in the Hunger Games.  The Hunger Games is a competition between one boy and one girl from each of the twelve districts. The goal, to survive. The games end when only one lives. The games are a reminder from the Capitol and their leaders to the citizens of each of the districts not to rebel as they had in the past or end up destroyed like District Thirteen.  Each district is known for a product that they produce. District Twelve is the coal district and home to 16 year-old Katniss Everdeen. The mines are harsh and food is difficult to come by, and with the death of her father, life is even more difficult for the Everdeens. Katniss is forced to sneak past the fence surrounding the district into the forest to hunt and gather herbs for food with her friend Gale. Leaving the district is strictly forbidden, but the lax security in District Twelve allows the duo to leave unnoticed.  Their story truly begins on the day of the reaping. The annual Hunger Games is about to start and the reaping chooses the two tributes from each of the districts that are going to be entered. In some districts it is an honor to be chosen, in twelve, it is a death sentence. Each year from the age of 12 until 18, the children's names are entered to be chosen, one entry per year. At age 12, one entry, 13, two entries, consecutively until 18. The catch? For entering their name more times into thedrawing per year and are awarded a tesserae, a years worth supply of grain and oil for one person, and the poorer the family, the more times a poor child's name is entered.  As the children of District Twelve assemble, Katniss Everdeen isn't worried about her 12 year-old sister Primrose, since her name has only been entered once. The name is drawn for the female tribute and Primrose was chosen. Before Primrose reached the stage, Katniss did the only thing that she could to save her sister's life, she volunteered to be a tribute, an unheard of event in District Twelve. The male tribute, Peeta Mellark, a 16 year-old son of a baker, and one-time savior of the Everdeen family.  As the tributes say their last goodbyes to their family and friends, the reality sinks in. One or both of them is going to die, and they may have to kill each other, leaving the tributes unable to forge a true friendship as they train to battle for their lives in the games with the other 22 tributes.  The Hunger Games was awesome. I give it 5 stars. It was extremely well written and the survival instincts of the tributes and their attitudes toward each other were engrossing. I loved the tension between Katniss and Gale as their friendship begins to grow into something else and between Katniss and Peeta as they attempt to overcome the idea of killing each other and forge an unlikely alliance and friendship between them. The small acts of defiance against the Capitol make the story extremely compelling. The auxiliary characters really enhance the story and you grow to care for them despite their small roles. I highly recommend this book for readers over 12. The violence is not extremely graphic, but is a huge part of the story and is suited for older readers.  Be sure to have the sequel handy for when you finish The Hunger Games, you will want more of Katniss, Peeta and Gale and their future adventures.  Check out my profile and blog!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|The packaging is very neat.  Comes with hours of extras plus all the Star Wars movies in high definition.  The is a great pack for anyone that loves star wars.  Even episodes 4=6 look incredible.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it is a pretty good game that has good free updates. would recommend to anyone with kids. fun and challenging
B004FRX0MY|4.0|Awesome to get music from, great quality.  But, when streaming (at least in Bangor, Maine) it chops out a lot more than I like from my \\"Cloud\\".  Unusual as I use iHeart Radio, .977 and TuneIn Radio and stream with no problem.  Look into that if you would AMazon.  I will say that with downloaded content the quality is high.  Thanks. B
0810989956|5.0|My nine year old loves it. He like the fact that it's interactive. He wanted to complete the set with this one and he believes it's the best because he can write his own events and make it his own.

1587672707|5.0|When I first found out about this edition, I immediately wanted it and was shocked to see that it was listed on Amazon.  Placed my order and crossed my fingers that I'd be lucky enough to get a copy.<br /><br />And lucky I was!<br /><br />This edition is absolutely gorgeous!  The size of the book is what grabbed me at first - not just the physical page count, but the actual dimensions.  This is one big book!  And then you see the cover and it keeps getting better.  The quality of presentation is top notch - the paper quality is shocking in how much better it is compared to do a mass produced hardback book.  The little things - colored end papers, different font colors - are much appreciated and just shows how much love went into making this edition.<br /><br />And then there's the artwork - the cover is what you see first, but when you take the time to truly inspect and appreciate the artwork that is throughout the book, it just keeps getting better.
B005C7SXMS|4.0|Growing up as a teenager in Wales or anywhere in the UK seems like a far different experience than growing up here in America.  As with many British films depicting \\"coming of age\\" such as \\"Wish You Were Here\\" to \\"Trainspotting\\", there is always a feeling that you are missing something because there is a underlying cultural difference that you can never quite pinpoint.  Submarine has some of this, but not as much as other films of this type.<br /><br />There are quite a few vibes you get when watching \\"Submarine\\", which is kind of expected, since there was nothing really \\"new\\" in the film, it seemed to borrow styles from other films. I guess the strongest vibe you feel is that it is like \\"Rushmore\\", this is true, especially the narrative style. I also got the vibe from Ang Lee's \\"The Ice Storm\\" as much of the movie deals with Oliver's parent's relationship, his mother's affair, and how they handle the situation.  This is reflected on his own relationship with his new girlfriend.  It's hard to talk about this film without giving to much away, so I won't.<br /><br />In case you were wondering if I liked the film, I did. It had the usual indie quirkiness, plus there was one point in the movie that they were lighting flares, sparklers and setting things on fire that reminded me of the Snow Patrol video for \\"Run\\" as Oliver tosses a flaming bicycle into the water.  What I did find lacking however is a good soundtrack. There only appeared to be music by a singer-songwriter named Alex Turner, and I could take it or leave it. Maybe he is big in Wales, I don't know.  Since the movie took place in an undetermined time in the 80's (imDb says it's 1986), the music choices are abundant , but I'm sorry to say that there probably was no budget for music in this movie. Music probably would have made this movie a bit more enjoyable, just look at Rushmore's outstanding soundtrack. You remember the movie just as much for the music as the movie. That could also have been a director's decision to keep the soundtrack minimalist, I don't know. I have not the Special Feature \\"The Making of Submarine\\" - maybe that will clue me in. Maybe I will also learn about the prominence of the four colors throughout the film that some of the characters wear - blue, red, yellow and black - The most obvious being  Yasmine in her prominent red coat.<br /><br />I find that most of the movies that hit my DVD player lately are from the Weinstein Company (in this case there are seven other companies involved as who produced the film), it seems that they have the \\"pulse\\" on good indie entertainment right now, plus their movies seemed to win a lot of Golden Globes. I mention the production company in case other people feel the same way I do.oundtrack minimalist, I don't know.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was awesome. It's boring at first but keep reading its going to get better. On catching fire know. cant wait to see the movie.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its ok but it could use more exciting games and better graphics. I think if you have nuthing better to do then play this game.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|challenging and addictive. I couldn't put it down until all levels were beat. I lost track of time when I played it.
B004XWLN20|5.0|Only $200 for all 10 seasons of the best show ever made is a PHENOMENAL deal! Individual season are up to $50 a peice. Like I siad this is the best show ever made- all types of people like this show. Smallville- if you haven't seen it you are missing out!
B0040UAYI4|5.0|Yep, this is one excellent product as one who prefers the precision of mice over an analoge stick. Set up is easy, just run the software through the computer, set the keys and so on. There is one issue, but its easily remedied. For every game you need to adjust the sensitivity. Other than that, if you like FPS games, get this.
B005EZJ3MW|5.0|I didn't like the songs at first.  But I am getting used to her new style after listening to the songs couple more times.  I like the songs very much now.  much much better than her first 2 CDs. This CD comes with nice booklet with pretty photos.  5 stars!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a very addicting game. i play for long periods of time. it is really fun. i love to play this
B005H0IW6W|3.0|Love Michael Buble, love the music and would have loved the CD if it were not defective.  The CD I received skips, especially in one particular song.  Very annoying.  As usual, Amazon's service was great.

B0069UP2PI|3.0|With the immediate subject matter of a global pandemic Steven Soderbergh's \\"Contagion\\" shows us how the world as we know it slowly disintegrates into chaos, and the people struggling to cope with and survive the situation. The script (penned by Scott Z. Burns, Soderbergh's \\"Informant\\") is obviously written with the recent SARS epidemic in mind, and the film offers a more frightening look at the crisis caused by a lethal virus than \\"Outbreak\\" does, but its intriguing premise is bogged down by some weak writing that could have been remedied.  The medical thriller has an impressive ensemble cast including Marion Cotillard, Matt Damon, Jennifer Ehle, Laurence Fishburne, Jude Law, Gwyneth Paltrow and Kate Winslet. While doctors and researchers of the world (represented by characters by Cotillard, Ehle, Fishburne and Winslet) attempt to identify the cause of the widespread disease and search for the cure, Jude Law's blogger claims his own theory that attracts many online. Meanwhile, the story of Mitch and Beth Emhoff (Damon and Paltrow), married couple with two children, follows the panic among the ordinary people seen from an ordinary family.  While the director's detached approach to the characters helps create the film's grim and realistic touch, the familiar faces of the stars keep reminding us that we are watching a movie. \\"Contagion\\" gives us chilling scenario of the society struck by the deadly virus, and how fear throws people headlong into confusion, but the realism is often undermined by the melodramatic storyline (Cotillard's character in particular) and some turn of events that seem too good to be true.  Thus, like in his \\"Informant,\\" Soderbergh employs styles that are curiously at odds with the contents. For all its excellent acting from the entire cast and some credible moments of the global pandemic, \\"Contagion\\" lacks power that would make us really worried about the future.
145162445X|5.0|For me as a non-physicist and not a native English speaker the book still very comprehendable and a very interesting read. There were parts that were hard to understand and sometimes I had to read sentences, or paragraphs or whole pages twice, but the material that Lawrence Krauss is so interesting to me, it was all worth it.  People looking for a easy read, probably won't like this book. It really stimulates the mind in ways that only happen when you try to imagine the value of 2 trillion years.  Good read, highly recommended.
1400069181|5.0|So I loved this book! It reads as part biography, part business how-to, and part inspiration. It chronicles the history of TOMS, a for-profit company that gives a pair of shoes to a child in need for each pair it sells. From it's start as a sketch in Blake's journal, to a full-fledged business selling millions of items, follow along as one man dreams of giving children a better future. TOMS blazed a trail for people to help others, yet still pay their own bills. Blake also shares the tips and insights he's gained on this journey to greatness.  I'm not an entrepreneur, but I love that many of the tips he shares can be translated to ministry, or to a non-profit, if and when I start one. This book was easy to read, with tons of stories from Blake and others he's come in contact with. Its a great combination of stories and practicality that will inspire just about anyone. I absolutely recommend this book!
B000J5XS3C|5.0|I bought this mixer at the recommendation of Bob Heil (K9EID) of Heil Sound fame. I put it in line to my Yaesu FT-897 after making an adapter for it. My reports went from \\"Sounds good\\" to \\"WOW!\\". I have a deep voice and this allows me to let it stay deep for ragchews or increase the highs to punch through pileups. The adapter was simple to make with an RJ-45 and a mono ¼\\" plug for the microphone to mixer and a Heil AD-1 iCM adapter for the mixer to radio. [...]  My on air reports tend towards the AM quality. Plenty of bang for the buck here!
B00007GZR5|5.0|Very pleased!!!! I have been looking for this movie for a while..It was one of the first movies my husband of 10 yrs and I watched together..Also a very smooth transaction.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|This book pretty much follows the same can't-put-it-down style and story line of the previous books.  The author did backslide into more of the unnecessary casual sexual relationship garbage that bothered me in the first book.  But to his credit, at least in this book it feels less like a dirty fantasy....since he does raise the opinion through one of the characters that this is irresponsible and insensitive behavior.<br /><br />Definitely worth reading if you enjoyed the previous two books..
B000002H2H|5.0|Metallica's second album represented a marked departure from Kill'Em All, as well as the bands first personell, Dave Mustaine would leave to found Metallica's nemesis Megadeth, a much darker and furious incarnation. This was Kirk Hammets \\"official\\" introduction into the band, although he did offer numerous guitar contributions to their first effort. Fight Fire With Fire, a song which references a Cold War nuclear holocaust, was very fitting for the military buildup orchestrated by President Ronald Reagan in the 1980's. At that time a nuclear showdown between the United States and the Soviet Union was at its apex. James Hetfield and Kirk Hammett offer arguably their most agressive and destructive track, much in the vain of And Justice For All's Blackened. Ride The Lighting is a song about our corrupt and somewhat inefficent justice system. For Whom The Bell Tolls has one of Metallica's best introductions and a driving drum beat by Lars Ulrich. Fade To Black is by far Metallica's most well-known early track, it is a depature from the rest of the album and has an extremely clean guitar sound. Trapped Under Ice, which is about drowning, has suffocating sound and feeling of helplessness. Creeping Death has a theme inspired by the Biblical story of Ramses II who was Pharoah of Egypt, after mocking God, Moses warned Pharoah that the first born of Egypt would die, later that night, a \\"Creeping Death\\", killed all of Egypts first born, including Pharoahs only son. Hetfield has used Biblical themes throughtout Metallica's extensive recording collection, the song is brutal and precise, as well as retrospective and a warning to those who question wisdom. The Call Of The Ktulu is a great insturmental track, which was primarily written by Dave Mustaine. The song reminds me of Iron Maiden, who is most well-known for their penchant for unusual song themes, like Maiden, Metallica uses an obscure poem as inpiration, this album is a thrash metal must have.
B003TNW044|5.0|Speedy shipping, great condition. Bought this for my sister around Christmas  time & she loves it. We ended up buying about 6 seasons. Show is a classic, I'd highly recommend buying this. :)
B000L9EKL0|4.0|This is one exciting, roller-coaster film that will not only keep your attention, but you will actually feel a little tired after all the struggling and fighting - kind of an adrenaline letdown.  Hackman and Wilson did a great job in acting, and it was good to see Owen in a role other than the lovable goofball. You will really appreciate our military (again and again) and their professionalism, courage, and teamwork. The story is loosely based on a real event involving one of our fliers who was rescued in real life. Good film - I liked it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love it!!! its great how it reminds me to read it every few days sometimes I need that :)
0307593312|5.0|A very phantasmagoric journey through the mind of an artist, the book centres on the romantic relationship that never happened in reality but that existed in the minds of two kindled souls that stayed connected even only after a single encounter. Around this theme, Murakami builds an elaborate plot involving a secretive cult and an even more surreal clique of little people.  The story sets off onto two paths -- one for Aomame, the assassin, and one for Tengo, the author/mathematician-- and the events surrounding their respective lives. As the plot thickens the paths begin to converge at the same time as the sinister part of the plot develops alongside towards the climax. Murakami meticulously builds incredibly detailed characters and settings that entangle the reader in this 1984/1Q84 universe.  The interpretation of the ending as well as several themes and allegories contained in the three books, are left for the reader to conclude on. In my opinion this is not a lazy omission by the author but instead a literary ending to the dreamlike like experience, much as the physical dream leaves the sleeper wondering as he awakens.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|great for passing time. cute games for kids. makes you work to open games. wish they were a bit more complicated but cant complain. since its free
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like that you can open more games by earning points.  This makes me want to play them more to see what the next game's are.
B005M2A4D4|5.0|There really isn't much to say.  If you are a DW fan, you should purchase because you can watch any series 6 episode any time you like.  It's as they say, a \\"no brainer.\\"

B005CMSDLE|4.0|Hanna (Saoirse Ronan) is raised by her father (Eric) in the arctic cold of Finland.  Her father is an ex CIA spook who is hiding in the wilderness and training his daughter to be a smart and tough warrior in preparation to be a perfect assassin.  She is trained in hunting, fishing, tracking, weapons and hand to hand combat to the point where at 16 she can even defeat her father.  She is as tough as any soldier and her physical skills and combat skills are far beyond her age.<br /><br />He pushes her in speaking many languages and accents and hones her intellect with lectures on science, the world and society out of an encyclopedia.  He coaches her in espionage and develops background stories for her to use in case she is ever caught.  Her father realizes that Hanna is ready and he sets into motion the plot for her to achieve her goal.<br /><br />The result is a good action and spy movie with several twists and turns that develops into a good story.  The movie takes place mostly in Europe and Hanna and her father have multiple chase scenes that are interesting.  If you like a good spy movie with a surprise plot, you will like Hanna!
B005K17RU0|5.0|this app is great and has sattelite and weather has weather all around the world i greatly reccomend this app to everyone have fun
B005NKIQ26|1.0|The package never arrived and customer care tells me to buy a new one. I bought it 2 months ago!  No more CDs from amazon. :-(  .
B001M5UDGS|5.0|we love Joss in this house, and this is no disappointment.  funny (if not a little crud in places) quirky, MUSICAL with a great twist at the end.  if you love the movie you'll love the soundtrack too[[ASIN:B001GUJD2O Dr. Horrible's Sing-along Blog (Motion Picture Soundtrack)]]
B005G4TJUC|3.0|Ok, Ok, the special effects were out of this world! But the story wasn't the best and the acting was average. I like the Transformer movies but this third movie was just so much action that you almost had to watch it in slow motion to see what was going on. There were battle scenes where the Transformers changed form so rapidly and destroyed so much that you couldn't almost get your mind around it to see all the details.<br /><br />The movie is just proof that special effects in and of themselves do not totally make a good movie. There has to be a solid script and some good character actors to make it an interesting movie. My wife fell asleep 3 times during the movie and she likes Sci-Fi.<br /><br />The film is 154 minutes long and could have been edited to a two hour movie with a tighter script and plot and been much better. Megan Fox was replaced by a beautiful actress named Rosie Huntington-Whiteley who is Sam Witwicky's new girlfriend. It is amazing that they found someone more beautiful than Megan Fox.<br /><br />The action scenes and a beautiful actress can't carry the story line. This is a good example where too much is just, too much! In addition to make a great movie you have to tie all necessary parts together with a good story and some decent actors!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I got this app for my son kindle. He loves all the different little games it has.

B003B5M0PO|5.0|The film is just out here and as I expected it to be a weepy, I decided to read the book first so there were no surprises, I am a wuss!  Anyway I loved the book, the story and the style of writing, I enjoyed Private Peaceful that I had read a long time ago.  Excellent.
B000059TFO|4.0|This film has been around for quite some time. I can't help but wonder why it's not available for streaming. I don't care to own a copy of it, but I would like to watch it thru my Roku. Amazon.. any thoughts?
0156034026|5.0|other reviewers have provided details about the book. I found in intellectually interesting and complex in a very good way.  It held my interest throughout.  The story starts with someone telling a story to a person across the table from him.  It's a bit like a Heart of Darkness opening.  The story is well told, interesting and relevant to today's world.  I ended up getting Moth Smoke as well by this author because of the quality of this book.  I find it interesting that we are seeing some really good literature coming from writers with a perspective we have never seen before (e.g.Kite Runner etc.).  This one is definitely worth the time to read.
B003KK6GOQ|5.0|A great read! I could not put this e-book down ! So much history and such a happy story! I never even knew the Channel Islands were occupied by the Germans - what a history lesson!
031617615X|5.0|this is the best book of the series!  I highly recommend it and the rest of Stephanie Meyers books.  Now that I have read her, I can't seem to find as much enjoyment in other authors.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|When ads start popping up in my notifications, that is when an app gets uninstalled.  Red star at my notification bar telling me to try something.  I understand that ads are what drive an app being free, but please limit them to in-app.  Games themselves were OK-pretty entertaining for simple games, and as the title says, you have a good selection.  You effectively start off with 12 of the 101, and have to score points to unlock the rest, starting with 90,000
B004MC8CA2|5.0|best thing I have done in a long time.  I enjoy reading the Bible every day.  This helps to understand more of the Bible and what God has done for all of us.

B0016YBFZ8|4.0|I love mob movies. They seem exotic since it's such a different reality from my own life. I judge all mob movies against the Godfather. So none besides Godfather 2 would receive a 5 star rating. This movie gets 4 stars. It's good enough, but still doesn't leave me in awe like Godfather.

B004Q7CIFI|5.0|11-22-63 By Stephan King A delightful book with a strong main character that Mr. King is known to write. There is a spot in an old dinner in Lisbon, Main - Al's Dinner, that when you go through it, it takes you back to September 9, 1958 at 11:58a. Same time, same place each time you entered it. No matter how long you were gone, you were only gone two minutes in 2011. Al Templeton showed it to Jack Epping, English teach at the local high school and a valued customer. Al was dying of lung cancer and couldn't finish the task he had set himself. After years of using the portal to buy low cost meat for his dinner, and taking vacations - because he was only gone two minutes in Lisbon of now, he would take two weeks or a month's worth of time off in 1958 - he got the idea of changing history, now he wanted Jack to complete the task for him. Live in the past, from September 9 th , 1958 to November 22 nd , 1963 and stop Lee Harvey Oswald from killing President John Fitzgerald Kennedy. Jack went back for a little over a month to do his own experiment, stopping a man in Derry, Main from killing his wife, two of his sons, his daughter and injuring his youngest son with permanent brain damage and a limp. Being the fall after the deaths caused by Pennywise the Clown, there was still an air of mistrust and evil around the town, and the evil was centered at the Kitchener Ironworks, which he was sent to inspect as part of his cover of a real estate broker. He knew of this homicide because one of his adult education students was the surviving son, his essay of The Day that Changed My Life had made Jack cry as he read of the horror of that Halloween Night as Frank Dunning took drunken revenge on the wife that had kicked him out of her house for beating her and the children. He was a little late, and Frank killed his wife Doris and injured his oldest son. When he got back to 2011, he took Al home and when back to his house and slept 14 hours. When he got up he researched the son he hadsaved, he found that he had died in Vietnam because he had a guardian angel and took more chances that he would have without seeing Jack there that night and having him say to him \\"I am your angel, I won't let any harm come to you.\\" Jack went to tell Al that the experiment was a failure, to find that Al had died in the night, leaving him a note that he had to finish the task. So, Jack went back, and killed Frank Dunning two weeks before that fateful night and then went on to save a young girl from getting shot and paralyzed (Al big experimental task) and then went on to find a time to kill Lee Harvey Oswald and find the proof needed that he was the only one in on the conspiracy. This book as we moved into Lee Harvey Oswald life was so full of various historical facts about all the players of that fateful day in American history, that I was sent looking up players and facts to make sure they had really accrued and to find out more about them. Mr. King followed Mr. Oswald's life pretty accurately from the time he got to Dallas. The delight to this reviewer in this creation of Mr. King's was the fact that the history was so vividly written, and the facts woven into a story so gripping that you couldn't put it down until your eyes refused to stay open and see the page any longer. A world of shifting time lines, fact and fictional characters woven into a beautiful piece of work that you want to enjoy more than once. Mr. King wove through this story a beautiful romance that broke your heart, not once, but twice as the lines shifted and moved again. This story is a definite read for anyone who loves Mr. King's works, not horror, but delightful story with mystical paranormal elements that will keep you guessing to its outcome. A compelling read for anyone that loves history, and is interested in the players surrounding the JFK assassination. I give this book a five star rating for the thoughts and reasoning behind one man's task at saving the world. As Mr. King put in hisexplanation, this is one possible outcome and theory or what might have happened that day, and if that day had never happened.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|Tons of versions, very easy to use, nice features. I went through a decent few Bible apps and this is easily the best.
B005K17RU0|5.0|this app is way better than the weather app that came with my phone. I love the temperature in the notifications bar, perfect for a quick check before heading out the door in the morning. Second favorite feature is the satellite map. I haven't had a good chance to watch the videos, yet. Still, the app is well worth the download. :)
0880796863|4.0|An amazing deck and a classic. The cards are a little slick, as with all new decks of cards, playing or tarot.  The box they come in is handy and feels pretty sturdy. I bought it when I got curious about tarot and it is wonderful.  However, the little booklet that comes with it has tiny print and is hard to read. Also, it isn't very helpful if you are trying to get started with tarot.  I suggest [[ASIN:1578634083 Seventy-Eight Degrees of Wisdom: A Book of Tarot]] instead of the booklet it comes with if you are interested in learning more about Tarot. It references and has pictures of this deck of cards, so the two work well together.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app! keeps me on track with my daily Bible reading. User friendly and wonderful! wish I had discovered it a long time ago.
B005FITIDC|4.0|This is a tough film to review because our \\"Machine Gun Preacher\\" was a violent person in the opening scenes. I know there are many moviegoers who would be inspired by this film but they will have to endure that first half hour. I guess you can't see what our hero has become until you see what he has been, so this R-rated film contains gunfire, disturbing images, drug use and lots of profanity.  Real-life Sam Childers served as the consultant, which is a fictionalized account of his headstrong, passionate and unusual life. Childers was a biker, a felon, and a drug-dealing addict who became a Christian crusader dedicated to saving hundreds of children in the Sudan who, if they were lucky enough to survive, were handed AK 47s and forced to serve as soldiers. His mission to save children is no longer limited to one country. He has centers in several African countries, plus in the United States. (Google Sam Childers) I hasten to emphasize, Childers' endeavors are humanitarian, NOT religious. He says, \\"You don't ask a hungry child who he worships.\\"  These actors portray real people:    *Gerard Butler (\\"Phantom of the Opera\\") is Childers. Butler does a masterful job showing us the arc of Sam's early violent life followed by his conversion to Christ, and then his rage at the treatment of the children in the Sudan.    *Michelle Monaghan (\\"Source Code\\") plays his wife, a former stripper named Lynn, who, in my opinion, is truly Sam's anchor. Without Lynn's tough love and staunch support, his efforts would have collapsed long ago.    *Kathy Baker (\\"Seven Days in Utopia\\") is Daisy, the ever-lovin' Mama who swapped the gun in Sam's belt for a Bible....    *Michael Shannon (\\"Revolutionary Road\\") is Donnie, the ne'er-do-well brother who can't seem to get his bearings. This Oscar-nominated actor is so good it's spooky.  Director Marc Forster (\\"The Kite Runner\\") knows how to work with children so we know this inspiring story is in good hands. Script writer Jason Keller spent a yeartraveling with Childers and accumulating stories from his legendary life. This script compresses about 30 exciting years into a two-hour movie.  It is obvious that not only is Sam passionate about his work, but scriptwriter Keller too, has become evangelistic about helping the innocent victims of this senseless slaughter. I have asked Amazon.com to notify me when this DVD becomes available.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I received this case when I received my Kindle Fire.  It has been used and abused since November 2011 and it is now mid January 2012.  I like the plastic like layer that wraps around this case.  The only tricky thing about this case for me has been using it as a stand.  If you jostle it too much, the cover slips out of the groove that turns the case into a stand.  I carry my Kindle Fire to work with me almost every day in my backpack - in the notebook protection area.  I have also carried it in my mini-backpack style purse.  This case has held up.  I don't abuse it, but I don't treat it gingerly either.  Now I am looking for the same style case for my son's Color Nook. Unfortunately Marware doesn't make cases for any Nook, so I tweeted to them asking them to consider it.  There are no Nook cases that provide coverage like the Marware MicroShell cases do.  Not only would I buy this case again, I am trying to get the manufacturer to support the one device they don't support!
B003AQBYUG|5.0|For all who are curious about this boxset, it is 100% compatible with american bluray players. it is also 100% identical to the American Boxset except for the BBFC ratings and the back of the box artwork. The image quality is astonishing, it really feels like these movies were filmed this year.
B0024RIMBG|5.0|Bought this DVD for my mom, she loves it.You cant go wrong with any of the Celtic Women collection. We watched this on PBS, loved all the ladies singing, very beautiful voices.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|fun fun some of the games can get addictive especially when you are trying to get the most coons available
B000AP04L0|5.0|Great funny movie, a real classic (that makes me feel old...), product as described, fast shipping. Everyone should see this at least once. Original retail package.
B001UV4XJ2|4.0|Wonderful ending to a great series. I'll miss all the characters from Hogwarts but have all the movies in the series to go back to.
B005ORVMT2|4.0|I was excited to get these remasters based on the feedback given by others. I decided to order one sector at a time. The packaging was great and the CDs sound fantastic, however on Exit stage left I had son bad spots on a couple of the songs. Having paid a good price I expected a good product. I returned it and when I got the replacement set it also had the same errors on the same disc ... plus more :-(  My hope is that this will be remedied by AMAZON or the manufacturer of the discs, I hate to see my favorite band get bashed for something the manufacturer did.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|really fun a good way to pass time never get boring a new game every time you play. you wont regret buying it!!!!!
B00006DEF9|5.0|I was so excited to buy this movie because to me, it's an all time classic! I remember seeing this film for the first time and I've fell in love with it ever since!!! Great to add to my collection.
B004XWMXW4|5.0|Listen to this CD all the time! First saw them on youtube.com and had to buy their album. They really are amazing!
B0001HAISG|5.0|I was so excited to buy this movie because to me, it's an all time classic! Everyone grew up hearing about Peter Pan's adventures. I remember seeing this film for the first time as a child and I've fell in love with it ever since!!! Great to add to my collection. Cant wait to show them to my kids one day!!!!
B004I2K4DY|4.0|I have to admit that I was skeptical of the new cast, being a great fan of the 10th anniversary cast, but after watching it the first time I came to love it almost as much. The Jonas Brother tends to get a lot of flack for not being at quite the same level as the rest of the cast, but I think he did a good job. The Innkeeper is hilarious, though I still like the old one as well. I think the emotions in this one are portrayed a little better. I do miss Colm Wilkinson though and am glad they all come back to sing at the end. All in all, very good. I can't quite give it a 5 though... maybe because I love the 10th anniversary one so very much.
B000060OFT|5.0|I was so excited to buy this movie because to me, it's an all time classic! Everyone grows up reading Shakespeare in school. I remember seeing this film for the first time and I've fell in love with it ever since!!! Great to add to my collection.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is awesome! Just read it on my friend's kindle. Gonna get my own copy for sure now. Hard to put down after you start reading.

B000641MB6|5.0|There is nothing better than watching the holiday classics to remind you of how things used to be. This movie is a must during the holiday season and is a staple with my family on a yearly basis.
B0064NTZJO|5.0|if you can honestly say without flinching that you appreciate well shot, well acted and well scripted film and accept it as art then this is the perfect movie for you. literally every scene in the movie was shot with love, a love letter to serious character development and well place nasty violence that should and can be compared to the likes of Kubrick, Tarentino or martin Scorsese (in his prime).  anyone who see's this movie looking for a cheap Hollywood action flick like fast and furious or gone in 60 seconds will be a little sore but will come away better for watching it.  absolute beauty on film
B000I0QL82|5.0|This is another holiday favorite of mine. The interaction of the actors and the percision of dance steps is just amazing to me, if I had half their talent.
B0018LMZOO|5.0|A great album remastered and including unreleased material! Loving it! The Moody Blues are some of the worlds best singer/songwriters!
B004SJ3AXI|1.0|played very shortly, game froze 3 times. game crazed twice. good game but needs repaired. also I think they need to check the ads they allow to be used, mostly scam things that I'm terrified might give me a virus
B006ZBRMOU|5.0|Well, E.L. James ended the series in a way to please almost all her faithful followers.  No spoilers from me, though!  Let's just say that I spent the night reading Fifty Shades Freed, completely immersed in this final installment, not wanting it to end.  Especially pleasing were the prologue and additional two chapters told from Christian Grey's perspective - which simply whetted my appetite for more: more of Christian from Christian.  I could easily reread this series should Ms. James decide to tell it that way.
B000SEH13C|5.0|Wow! What an amazing piece of writing. If you've read my previous two Vonnegut reviews for The Sirens of Titan and Slaughterhouse Five you'll know that I was not impressed with Mr. Vonnegut after my first read and he slowly grew on me with Slaughterhouse. I enjoyed S5 and Cat's Cradle may have just become my favorite book of all time (for now). After my first two Vonnegut novels I found myself with a pretty decent understanding of Vonneguts writing style and it seems to grow on me more with each.<br /><br />What I liked most about Cat's Cradle is that it can be whatever you're looking for in a book.It certainly holds it's own if you're looking for pure entertainment.Vonnegut's wit and the story shine through here by themselves. I never felt like I had to search for greater meaning to the words in order to appreciate them.As an example there is an exchange between Miss Francine Pefko and Dr. Asa Breed early on in the novel that I found so hilarious I reread it about 8 times.Another that stands out in my mind is the chapter titled \\"Bicycles For Afghanistan\\" in which H. Lowe Crosby describes the current state of the American Bicycle industry.It just goes to show how politics can screw up the simplest of business models and although written in 1963, could very well have been penned yesterday.<br /><br />That being said, it would be hard for anyone with an average intelligence not to pick up what Vonnegut was trying to get across with Cat's Cradle.This is a wonderful book that has serious, yet comical, political,anthropological and religious messages.It's not hard to see why Vonnegut was awarded his M.A. for Cat's Cradle from the University of Chicago in the abscence of a formal thesis.I recommend this book to just about anyone.It's very clear why Cat's Cradle is cemented into literary history as one of the all-time greats.
B005HV6Y5W|2.0|Even a long-time fan of Terrance Malick's films such as myself had a difficult time with this work. Malick is known for visually beautiful but incomprehensible filmmaking and he does not surprise anyone here in 'Tree of Life'. If anything, 'Tree of Life' is his most incomprehensible film to date and a second viewing (almost a requirement for any Malik film) does not do much good. It also does not help that, as usual, Malik offers little explanation. Like all of Malik's other films, the DVD set offers little extras to give the viewers clues   about the intent of the film.  Segments of a life told in disjointed scenes that bounce through time with mumbled dialogue and an overlaid voiceover tell the story (sort of) of a failed father, a solid but suffering mother, and 3 boys. Sean Penn plays the reflective older son remembering the past; Brad Pitt plays the loving but frustrated father. All of this is wrapped up in a prologue that represents the beginning of the universe and an epilogue that represents heaven.  This is the most emotional film that Malik has ever made yet still the viewer is kept at a emotional distance from the characters  Perhaps this is why the film has been compared to Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey'; that and the long forming of the universe sequence early in the film. Any Malik film is worth seeing and 'Tree of Life', not one of his best, is not an exception. However viewing might be best done as many people first saw '2001: A Space Odyssey' back in the 1960's; stoned.
B0062NAX1U|1.0|I do believe in god, but this movie did not do it for me.  Bad actors--slow moving.  Just my opinion
1423113381|5.0|We love Rick Riordan's books at our house.  So I picked this up for my son as a stocking stuffer for Christmas.  He was thrilled with it!
B004UHSB5A|1.0|Could be the best but is not.  When you drag the domino you want to play to the table, it will not stay even though the end bone you are trying on play on lights up green signifying a legal move. Its FRUSTRATING!!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Games get progressively more complicated (yay). Each group of 12 has a variety of game styles. Touch screen on fire makes some games really difficult.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I did receive a Kindle Fire over the holidays (something that I have grown to love as a device) and I wanted a cover to protect the tablet.  After looking at the various covers available, this was really the most interesting choice.  The video here was very helpful to help me make my decision.<br /><br />I am very happy to have chosen this cover.  It is sleek, lightweight and very stylish.  The Kindle simply snaps into place with the plastic tabs holding it in place, and this has not been an issue at all.  The cover, although initially stiff, loosens up a bit to become a flexible protector of the screen.  The wrap-around strap makes a nice way to secure the Kindle to the front cover during travel.  The cover itself has a felt-like material that keeps the screen from being scratched.<br />The stand-up feature is okay, although not something I care about so I can't tell you how good it is.<br /><br />I have only had this cover for a few weeks so I can't comment on whether it will save the Kindle from a drop (I hope not to have to test this (although it seems like it will protect the Kindle from a skid across the floor or travel in your kitbag)), or the ultimate longevity.  This is not a cover to be abused however, and shouldn't be used as such.  Kids and this cover will not be a good combination, it seems.  It seems like this cover will last until the next big thing (measured in double digit months), so right now I am a happy camper.
0545091020|1.0|The woman reading these books is possibly the worst choice I can think of. She cannot do a young teenage voice and my god, she is worse at any male voice. Her Haymitch is a freaking JOKE. I kept looking around my car like the candid cameras were hidden in my backseat or something. Casting anyone else on the face of the planet would have been an improvement.  Don't get me wrong the book is amazing - this woman.  Oi!  This woman!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|perfect for someone like me who is always on the go. it reads out loud to me while I drive.
B004EN8KE2|1.0|The woman reading these books is possibly the worst choice I can think of.  She cannot do a young teenage voice and my god, she is worse at any male voice.

B005HSG3VK|5.0|Word of advice... buy this cover! It works wonderfully. Provides protection, a stand, and fits snuggly around the kindle fire. And best of all, its at a decent price. Don't waste your money on all those expensive fancy ones, this one rocks!
B0063IH60K|4.0|very fun game. after you get started it is very addicting and hard to stop playing. and the fact that it is free makes it even better.
0446547603|5.0|Nick Sparks is a great writer.  I Love him and so does my daughter.  I know where my Safe Haven is, do you?
B005T87QCI|1.0|this game is suckish i hate it. BORING!!!!!!!!!!!!! never buy this game .crap stupid never ever ever buy the dumbest game ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I love the game!! I play it everyday and its really easy to get points! I just wish they would add better directions and be specific :)
0007183305|5.0|This book has an unbelievable amount of information to keep you alive in the wild for it's size. It seems to have all of the info contained in Wiseman's full-sized book, The SAS Survival Manual.  It's a great reference for your jacket pocket or backpack; I have given more than a dozen away as gifts.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|so stuck on the crossed wires! can only get 2000! good game. keeps me occupied! but some are impossible lol
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its fun to try to earn enough points to open new games and levels. some of the games can get boring or annoying.
0937381888|5.0|This book tickles the inner hobbyist/nerd.  For people with an interest in the how and why of beer making this is a great book. It gives a thorough understanding of how to brew beer and what is happening to the beer being brewed. I feel like this is a great base of knowledge to build a life long love of brewing.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This app is good fun to posy on the Kindle Fire.  The graphics make it easy to see and the screen response of the game is very good.  Nice way to relaxed.
B0063GORYU|3.0|A lot of fun but the constant advertisements get to be annoying. Simple interface makes it very easy to play
042524489X|4.0|I must say I enjoyed this book because Hawke, the pack leader, is the ultimate Alpha.  I loved how he just was constantly in control with his pack.  I also liked the play between him and Sienna.  It was interesting to see how Sienna developed over time into the young woman portrayed in the novel.  This is probably my favorite out of the psy-changeling novels I have read.
1451627289|5.0|The cover features a review that argues that this book makes time travel seem plausible.  No book can reach this goal.  Time travel is not possible and, the vagaries of quantum mechanics aside, you know it and I know it.  So why do stories using it as a premise continue to arise and be successfully received?  Why should we read one?  All of us have regrets about past actions and wonder if we could change them if our lives would be better.  Many of us also wonder if we could somehow make the lives of those we love better by fixing something from the past.  Society often wonders if history has given the fuzzy end of the lollipop and if we could have done something different.  It is these personal and public wonderings that make stories of time travel popular.  When they are finished hopefully they will bring us comfort that there is really no way of knowing.  Stephen King addresses all of this in a way that succedes beyond expectation.  When Jake finds out the storage room of his favorite diner features a portal to 1958, its owner, Al charges him with completing a mission that will change our nation's history.  Also seeing the chance to take care of a personal matter, Jake agrees.  He spends five years in the past, completing one quest early on and waiting to complete a second.  During this time Jake receives confirmation of Al's warning that the past will fight change.  He also begins to perceive that history has patterns that keep things in balance, a perception that he will later question.  During this time he establishes himself a life and livelihood in small Texas down.  He finds love, witnesses tragedy, and begins to truly feel more at home in the past than in his own time.  All the while wondering the benefit of his mission.  Throughout this time the book tells stories that in their own right are moving and well told. The length of this book had me worried that it would be have the flaws of many of King's past over-expansive and uncontrolled stories (I was notable to finish \\"Under The Dome\\").  As 11/22/63 sprawled out over years and sub-plots, these concerns were forgotten as highly intriquing stories evolved. However in the end these stories contribute to a climax with a level of skill reserved for only the masters of story telling.
B0063IH60K|4.0|some of the rounds are pretty challenging...I like that in a game!  recommend it to anyone who likes quick card games! i play it any chance I get.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I was skeptical initially after reading that this story was created around the photographs, rather than the reverse.  But this was an excellent book,and I would be at the front of the line to read a sequel.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This app has fun games and keeps me entertained. To unlock new games you have to complete others, which actually provides a nice challenge. My only complaint is the ads...lots of ads.
B003EV6DBM|5.0|got here very fast and in good condition.  This was nice, especially around Christmas time, when I expect (and get) long delays from other merchants.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This app is fun, easy to use and doesn't have a lot of ads. I would reccomend it to anyone looking for a basic solitaire game.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this gam&quot;e is amazing there is a huge varsity of games and there all free the graphics are good the only problem is it cost slot of points
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This is a great app.  I've tried several that claim they can do this, but this is the first one that delivered.  It installed and was working in just moments-no emails to dev re settings, etc.  The only problem I had was in the corners...it is sometimes difficult to close a program with the x in the corner on my Droid X.  Thanks!
0345349571|2.0|(Hardcover book) About one sixth of the book was very interesting and informative with generalizations about the era, specifics on some battles and the plague.  The rest had way too much fine detail of endless alliances, wars, marriages, etc. of no interest to a modern reader.  It gave me the impression of a thesis on DeCourcy that was padded to made a book.
B004D0YB4Y|4.0|I had never even heard of Charles Bradley when i noticed his CD was in the Rolling Stone's list of the top 50 in 2011.  I read their review and decided to take a chance on his CD.  A great decision.  This guy can really sing with emotion.  Plus his back-up band  knows how to play many different instruments.  Which is something u don't hear often enough.
B000059HB7|3.0|Leisurely paced to the extreme, director Howard Hawks' \\"Rio Bravo\\" (1959) gets a boost from John Wayne's iconic presence and Dean Martin's career-high performance as the drunken deputy - the best aspects of this overrated Western. Hawks focuses more on characterization than gunfights, with effective sexual chemistry between the Duke and Angie Dickinson.  Unfortunately, the casting is far from perfect: Ricky Nelson emerges as a total stiff while Walter Brennan resorts to an obnoxious Gabby Hayes imitation. Despite its scripting deficiencies and overlength, \\"Rio Bravo\\" is pleasurable escapism. Hawks aficionados may disagree, but \\"El Dorado\\" (1966) surpasses the original.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|some games are hard to play but lots of games and free I don't like they want u to use real money
B0063IH60K|5.0|I find myself playing this game constantly!  It is very addictive.  I love how it gives you the option of a guaranteed winning game!  :)
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is an amazing and challenging app. you have to do so much to unlock more games, so you can play this game for a long time with new material every day!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is an execellent app to have on your android,  or any devices. Not only do you have Bible app on your devices, but different translations, word of the day, and many more good resources. This is a definite to have app, good way to start your day, and excellent way to learn more about God.
140053271X|5.0|it is really good and portable i can take it when i go to Florida. though it does not have a back light, i truely enjoy it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This app is so addicting! The games are fun as easy for all ages and there is an immense variety of gaming options.

B0063GORYU|5.0|wonderful way to clear the mind and refocus as needed during the day! one of my favorite stress relievers! try it yourself!
0321344758|5.0|Fantastic book! A must read for all UX and web designers. Short, fast and too the point. Love this book.
0385342063|4.0|While I am a fan of the Shopaholic series, more often than not I find myself wanting to brain Becky.  She's almost TOO stupid and finds herself in TOO many situations.  I'm often spending much of the book wanting to throttle her even though I do somewhat enjoy her antics.  I think Poppy is the perfect answer to Becky - I somewhat see her as a watered down more normal version- however not saying that Poppy doesn't have a few issues of her own!<br /><br />This book was a fun light read and I managed to read it all in just a few hours.  It was enjoyable and I found myself sad at the end when these characters were done telling their story.  I am secretly hoping this turns into a series as I'd love to revisit BOTH of these characters again, even if they are bit parts in a new novel.  By far my favorite standalone novel of Kinsella's so far.
B005MYEPXC|5.0|Having seen \\"Midnight in Paris\\" in the theater we ordered the DVD and have since played it multiple times as family and friends have visited
0071762345|5.0|[[ASIN:0071762345 Likeable Social Media: How to Delight Your Customers, Create an Irresistible Brand, and Be Generally Amazing on Facebook (And Other Social Networks)]]  As a new user of Facebook and a new business operator, I found this book extremely useful.  Many good examples and definitely worth the time to read.
B0068AWQQ2|5.0|I have to admit that I appreciate all sub-genres of vampire movies even some of the twighlight movies, but I also miss the evil vampire movies of the 80's, and 90's. I loved Anne Rice's interview With a Vampire and even Tales From the Krypt's Bordello of Blood. I enjoyed John Carpenter's Vampires, Blade, and Underworld series, one of my all time favorites has always been Fright Night. I enjoy the 80's version and equally enjoy the newest version. If you are a lover of vampire movies then this is a must see because it is a classic at my age(29).
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have tried several free Bible apps and this is by far the best in terms of number of translations and flexibility.  Is it perfect?  No.  But, the price is right!
0385342063|5.0|I have read quite a few of Kinsella's other books, and this one follows the same pattern of romantic comedy that she does so well. There were several instances and madcap situations, banter and images that made me literally laugh out loud. There were sweet moments as well, but for the most part this was a fun, light read. It made for a lovely way to spend my evening - because it is certainly a fast read that you won't want to put down.<br />This is also one of the first books I have ever read that so much \\"conversation\\" happens via text, which made for an interesting twist. The plot may be a bit predictable, but getting to that end is what makes it so much fun. And don't worry, there are still surprises along the way!
B001NEK2GE|5.0|I will say right off: This is the best of at least 3 auxiliary keyboard/gamepads that I have owned. I love it, but it is not perfect. Before I begin my review, let me describe my play style as it may give my comments more relevance. I am a long-time COMPUTER gamer. (I remember and played on virtually every machine since the Atari 800, and all of the Intel/DOS/Windows based machines. I tend more towards rpg/mmo games as opposed to fps or simulations. I also have a &#34;mouse dominant&#34; as opposed to a &#34;keyboard dominant&#34; play style. This means that I prefer to mouse-click on the gui to activate actions, as opposed to keyboard activation. That being said, I have long sought a way to put those keyboard commands I DO use, under my left hand with no need to shift my hand around the keyboard.  The Good:  The G13 is a fully programmable auxiliary keypad. If you want a way to put almost all of your keyboard commands under one hand, this is it. It has 22 keys on the main pad, and 2 more and a mini-joystick for thumb control. All of the keys can be set to be individual or macro keystrokes. And profiles can be created for each game you play and set to be activated by the game's start-up file or shortcut. This makes it both extremely flexible and useful. The rest for the heel of the hand is non-slip padded enough to be comfortable. All of the main-pad keys are through-lit and thus easily seen in a darkened play areas. And the G4, and G10-G12 keys, normally set to WASD have a slight extra dishing to make them locate-able by feel. The spacing and stroke length is identical to the throw on my primary keyboard (a Logitech G15). Though the keys are aligned vertically rather than staggered as on a full keyboard. This may be annoying to those who prefer the newer chick-let style keyboards.  The not sot Good:  The reach is longer than I would like. I found that until I moved the heel of my hand up a bit on the rest, that a long game session produced a fair amount of fatigue.Moving my hand up on the rest gave my fingers more arch, and really reduced the fatigue. Unfortunately that moved my thumb out of position for the buttons on the thumb-pad. This has not been a major problem for me, as I have mapped a thumb button on my mouse to Spacebar. But could be a real problem if you can't do this. I also find myself wishing the key stroke-length was a bit shorter. If I could do a redesign on the G13 I would make the keys just slightly smaller to improve reach, reduce the stroke depth just a bit, and do something to allow the thumbpad to be moved along the edge of the pad to make it fit the individual user's hand position.  The LED screen is a nice feature but of limited use in active gameplay, as I don't have time to look at it. It does give some interesting information if I have time (or remember) to look at it while I play. All in all, as I said at the outset, I love my G13.  It is the first gamepad I don't have to consciously remind myself to use.  And I find that I don't have to put my hands on my keyboard except to type messages. And can replace my hand back on the pad, in the correct position, almost as easily as I do my right hand on my mouse.  Can I say any more?  4 of 5 stars.  UPDATE, After more than 4 years of daily use:  I LOVE this pad! It is still as functional as the day I unboxed it. If it were to die tomorrow, I would simply order another. It is one of the best gaming purchases I have made. I have made a few adjustments in the way I use it. And those have made all the difference. 1) I always use my own custom set-up for each game.  I have developed a &#34;standard&#34; layout for my games. i.e :   a) I dropped the movement keys (usually WASD or arrows) down one row, for easier reach, and to make the top row available for number or function keystrokes.   b) I program the keys for things like inventory, map, character stats, etc. in the same locations regardless of the actual game's key assignments. This let's me just play thegames, rather than learn specific layouts.   c) I don't try to use the &#34;Thumb-stick&#34; to control movement. Instead, I assign the direction positions to keystrokes or macros. (Usually both Right and Down, and Up and Left, to the same action.) This lets me do things like &#34;Throw the Hutt-ball&#34; in SWtoR, or make a special attacks in other games, by just flicking my thumb. 2) I took an old corrugated paper box and some duct tape, and made an angled rest for my G13 to give it MY perfect play angle.  I wrap this stand in a micro-fiber towel for additional comfort for my forearm. I can play for hours without fatigue.  Yes, I am a true Geek, and as I am now retired, I have the time. 3) I don't worry about the automatic game select function.  Most of my games run through Steam, and getting them to auto-select is more bother than just using the LED Screen to scroll through to lock onto the game I am going to play.  The USB trickle-charge keeps the game selected after my computer is shut down.  For the above reasons, I have changed my rating from 4 to 5 stars.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|Ok, so 'flawless' isn't quite achievable, but this is the most valiant effort I've ever seen.  Each episode improves on the last; a feat which I wouldn't have thought possible.  'Sherlock' comes in as one of my favorite TV Series ever, topping things such as Firefly and Doctor Who.  Bravo to the BBC, and All Hail Gatiss.
B005MYEQ4U|2.0|A big disappointment.  Did not rise to the hype.  Frankly, I expected a lot more from a Woody Allen  film in light of his past efforts which I have  loved.  Feel he wanted to spend some time  in Paris so, why not pay for the trip.
B000H7J9QM|4.0|The movie was great and I loved it! Now a days I only watch Blu Ray caused I think that is the way to go in the future.
B0055SWM08|5.0|a great way to relax and calm down. puzzling, yet not frustrating. the music helps too. thanks for a great app
B0044KU7KU|5.0|Received item on time and in very good condition for a used item. CD plays great too. Would purchase items again.
0802136834|5.0|I ordered this book, which came beautifully packaged as an 'Amazon' product and it arrived less than 24 hours later...that's right, I ordered it in the evening it came in the next day's UPS. Book itself is well read but clean and quite useable.<br />At one point I was tempted by Kindle Fire but frankly came from a generation where books were still revered, and there's nothing like holding a book, feeling the weight and seeing typeset, not screenset. Being able to purchase books and rebuild my library in such an affordable manner with Amazon as my 'bookstore' is deeply appreciated.
0385534639|3.0|I started this book with extremely high expectations, but I was disappointed.. in many ways, the book was overrated, the reviews I previously read before starting the book, all indicated that it was an excellent page-turner book. Sadly, it wasn't for me.  The first 20 - 30% percent of the book were promising, I was mesmerized by all the magic and the characters, then I just kept waiting for the plot to get more interesting, waiting for something more exciting to happen with the characters, which eventually did, but was painfully slow. The book just dragged with unnecessary description, though I must admit, some were very `magical', exciting and intriguing parts in it, the precise description of the smells, the tents made me feel I was actually there. Besides that, I had to push myself to the very last page.  Another thing that bothered me about this book is the constant change in the time setting, it gets a bit confusing, with each chapter it either goes back/ahead a year or sometimes a day, it got me confused in the beginning and I was only able to grasp it towards the end of the book.  It just wasn't one of the best book I've read, but also wasn't the worst, therefore it's a bit difficult to rate it as there were some parts that I absolutely loved and some I felt the complete opposite. I would rate the book a 3, but that's me being generous.
0439023521|5.0|Any book that I will sit down and read in one sitting, we always get 5 stars from me. It takes a lot to keep me engrossed in a book to where all I want to do is keep reading until it's finished.  Even though this is a Young Adult book, it was a pleasure to read as an adult. Fast-paced and full of twists and adventure. Also enjoyed the author writing in first person present. Not easy to do and yet she was able to capture the voice of Katniss perfectly. I recommend highly. Starting Book Two tonight.
0316017930|5.0|It's a quick and easy read and you will learn a ton of fascinating information. Read it! You will not regret it.
B000O59AFC|5.0|We received Mission Impossible Blu-ray edition in a timely manner and in perfect condition. Was new and had never been used and works like a charm. No complaints.
0393327655|2.0|I am an atheist and I agree with this book on a lot of points, but I was not expecting to have to read about how Islam is a uniquely violent religion and that present-day Muslims as a whole are the equivalent of medieval Christians in terms of religious dogmatism, ignorance and potential for brutality. There was no analysis of why Christianity, with a similarly brutal text and world hegemony to boot, does not produce such violence in the present--just an implied conclusion that Westerners have been brought to the light of reason by the passage of time and cultural development, even though Christian values obviously do real violence in our societies today. The author does, however, completely dismiss the notion that Muslims could be brought out of their \\"ignorance\\" by science or political development like medieval Christians were.  My thoughts were provoked for a little while, sure, but I literally threw this book in the trash at around page 160 when the author mentioned \\"bringing civilization to Afghanistan\\" or some other profoundly arrogant, interventionist statement that this book is full of. Note that I'm calling this book arrogant and I am a deeply cynical atheist with no respect whatsoever for anyone else's spiritual beliefs.  In sum: I'd rather read the bible.
B004LWZW8S|2.0|Was very excited to see this movie in 3d well the only good parts are in the commercials, the movie itself in my opinion had way too much talk not enough action, 300 was a movie I bought right after it released, this movie does have many beautiful scenes and the fighting scenes were entertaining just too few and far between. Immortals will never find itself on my movie shelf..
B004MC8CA2|4.0|This app is easy to use.  You have access to many versions of the Bible.  I would recommend to anyone at any age.

B00664AM5C|2.0|I found this movie to be on the boring side. The trailer makes the film look a lot better then it really is IMO. I was really hoping to enjoy it. Def. save your money, rent before you decide to buy.
159420229X|4.0|Definitely a good read.  Lots of interesting facts about the history of memory.  I was hoping to get more \\"know-how\\" overall on the science portion of memory.  Chapter 8 - The OK Plateau inspired me a lot.  Inspired me so much that I'm encouraging a bunch of individuals to read this book.  Really wish that I was taught some of these techniques in my earlier years as it would have probably helped me significantly in my education.
B0012FE4BS|5.0|this album is amazing. and it is before the mtv ruined them. blues rock at its best in my opinion. do yourself a favor and get this. the extra live tracks are a nice addition as well. well worth the money

B000H0MKGK|5.0|The CDs came very quickly.  Continuum by John Mayer is a great CD.  My husband loves jazz and big bands so the Big Band Christmas CD was a hit.
0071762345|5.0|I just finished up \\"Likeable Social Media\\" and I have to say, Kerpen did a damn good job with this one. I like to say I understand the space pretty well, but he brings a ton of clarity to the social media world. More than anything else, the writing is very solid. The concepts aren't super complicated, but the way he moves through it--it's just a good read.  I picked up \\"Likeable Social Media\\" looking to solidify my feelings about managing online communities. It worked! He reinforced a lot of the ideas I had and made me think even more about the potential for the space.  Well worth the money; Kerpen is ahead of his peers.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|lots of simple games some are fun enough. pretty mindless but still fun. kind of annoying to have to play them over again to get points for opening more games up

1433502410|5.0|Wonderful and reputable translation.  I enjoy studying the old testament; especially the prophets and kings.  The commentary is very informative and the tables and illustrations are great.  This is by far my favorite bible, although it is very thick so you might want a smaller bible to carry around, especially if you have a baby or toddler.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game its the best game ever you rock 101+16 I wish there was 100 more games keep up the good work and make more games

B000K7VHQ4|5.0|I must have seen The Illusionist a dozen times by now and though I thought it was outstanding upon first viewing, I now think it stands as a classic in its own right. Apart from the pitch-perfect casting choices and the stand-out mesmerizing performance of Edward Norton, the film carries an unusual tone that's part romantic and part mystery, combining to create a sense of fantasy and false reality. For fans of The Prestige, although these were released around the same time, they are very different (and both excellent) films. For fans of Ed Norton or Paul Giamatti, both deliver outstanding performances and book-end a fascinating script that will make this a movie you find yourself coming back to.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Good time sinks. My kids really enjoy them which is the reason for most of my games anyway. thanks so much for your time.
0553801473|5.0|As a long-time of fan of the work of George RR Martin, I have, of course, read every single book of his epic work, Songs of Fire and Ice. Creating a complicated, medieval-like world of knights and bloody battles, Martin's work is always both confusing and mesmerizing. This, the fifth in the never-ending [I hope] series, is another massive, 1000-page saga covering not only the original fictional continent Westeros, but including ever more lands and peoples, all generated by the fecund mind of Martin. Rivaling Dickens in his imaginative names and parade of characters, Martin has truly outdone himself in this last book. I heartily recommend it to anyone who loves fantasy or even to anyone who loves fiction. It helps to have read all the other volumes as they mesh and interlink so beautifully, but this book can also stand on its own.
0143121421|5.0|I recently reread this book and was struck by how perfectly Le Carre's writing style matches the bleak atmosphere of the novel.  The hero of the tale, Alex Leamas, embodies the loneliness and personal confusion the author felt at the time.  Writing this masterpiece of espionage in just 5 weeks became a source of solace for Le Carre.  \\"By telling an ingenious tale,\\" he says, \\"I was making some kind of bitter order of my own chaos.\\"  The result was a book that ended a life of writing obscurity and began a long period in which the publication of a new book by the author became an event in the publishing world.  As the quotidian reality of the Cold War years vanishes generationally into the past, documents like this provide grim reminders of the atmosphere that prevailed at that time.  Le Carre was inspired to write The Spy Who Came in from the Cold while working in the British Embassy in the shadow of the newly constructed Berlin Wall.  It was, says the author, \\"perfect theater as well as a perfect symbol for the monstrosity of ideology gone mad.\\"  The Wall, according to Le Carre, made the espionage industry more clandestine, perilous, questionable and over-crowded than ever before.  It is more a character than a bit of scenery in the novel, making its appearance in the first and last chapters.  In addition to providing expert Cold War atmosphere, the book has strong characters and an ingenious, twisting plot.  British agent Leamas is left out in the cold to entrap East German Head of Security Hans Dieter Mundt.  The chess match between these two is compelling to watch.  Inclusion of Deputy Security Chief Fiedler as well as Leamas' love interest, Liz, increases both the stakes and the complexity of the game. Le Carre's tale demonstrates how emotional and intellectual powers are the true attributes of an agent rather than the physical histrionics that are exhibited by cinematic practitioners of espionage.  The Spy Who Came in from the Cold is a taut morality tale whichutilizes a palette of grays to paint its characters.  It freezes a moment in time which should be remembered as a cautionary tale.  Graham Greene, himself a master in the field, called it \\"the best spy story I have ever read.\\"  Many more espionage novels have been written since Greene said this, but I'm not sure any have surpassed Le Carre's iconic effort.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Other than ad you buzz through - great game - quick and easy to play and understand.  thank you!!  super kid friendly too.

B002Q9VP3O|1.0|This is one of my favorite movies, so I was very excited to see it had been released on blu-ray. BUYER BEWARE: This is not a remastered, high-definition print of \\"Emma.\\" In fact, the quality is even worse than that of the DVD that I foolishly sold after I'd placed this order. The lip sync is off for the entire first scene, and the print quality is TERRIBLE - lots of artifacts and so shaky at times that at first I thought maybe it had been videotaped by some guy with a camera in a theater.  Save your money. Buy the DVD for cheap until someone does a proper blu-ray release of this film.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|there is a wide variety of games, and they are all so much fun! having to earn the new games is a great way to keep you interested.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this app is so boring it is almost unbelievable. this is definately being uninstalled. to sum it up into one word that would be:  boring
B006ZBRMOU|5.0|An undercurrent, by definition, is the hidden movement of water beneath the surface; its tug and motion are only perceptible upon submersion. Fifty Shades is exactly like an undercurrent. You dive into the story thinking you know what to expect, only to find out once you're in it that it's something else completely.  And Fifty Shades Freed is the riptide of currents. You'll be swept away with a force that is impossible to escape, not that you'd want to escape. You'll savor every moment, every word, and when it's over you'll want to pick it up and start again from the beginning. The only thing I'd like to caution readers about with the Fifty Shades Trilogy--it will literally ruin other books for you.  So many readers glance at the back cover this book and expect an erotic novel about BDSM.  Yes there are some BDSM elements to the story, but that's not what this novel is about. Fifty Shades is probably the best romance I've ever read. It's impossible to put into words in a review what this book will make you feel. It's so emotional. It is authentic, open, honest, and at times both heartwarming and heartbreaking. I've recommended this series to so many people who told me that it was out of their comfort zone because of the BDSM. However, after practically browbeating them into reading it, every one of them came to me raving about how wonderful and unexpected it was. Still, I'm not going to lie, the erotic scenes are hot as hell--but they are tasteful, and nothing to shy away from in my opinion.  Christian Grey is the hero, and he defines the word contradiction. He is THE Alpha male. Strong, unbelievably sexy, and dominating, but just like other parts of this story, there are things unseen below the surface. There's a reason Ana refers to him as her \\"lost boy\\". Yes he is extremely successful, sensual and dominating (he doesn't apologize for his predilections), but he is misunderstood. He uses control as a mechanism to guard his feelings, and despite his behavior, Ana sees past the surface to the man beneath.  It's ironic that Christian spends most of his time trying to protect Ana. Initially, he views her as fragile, but as he quickly learns, appearances can be misleading. He discovers through Ana that strength is not only about brawn and toughness. Strength is displayed in bravery, fortitude, and the ability to cope with everything life throws at you, and Ana epitomizes inner strength.  Not only is Ana the first woman to see Christian for who he really is, she is the first woman to stand up to Christian, and because of that she earns his respect, devotion, and unwavering love.  I've decided to rebel. There is no way I can justify classifying this novel as a 5 star read, so here it is:  I've hijacked another star and I'm giving 6 stars to Fifty Shades Freed. I'm just hoping this blatant infraction of the rules is enough to warrant a run in with Christian's twitchy palm.  I RECOMMEND (in shouty caps) this book to everyone who loves an amazing love story, because that's really what this book is.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|With this app I have access to multiple versions, I can set up a reading plan, AND it will read to you also.
0545265355|5.0|A fantastic read. Could not put it down...ended up staying up all night to finish!!! My 12 year old said it was his \\"favorite\\" but I thought it would be a \\"kids only\\" kind of thing. Then he bought it for me for Christmas...I couldn't have been more wrong! Excellent character development, fast-paced plot, and a great storyline! The description on the back DOES NOT DO IT JUSTICE! I devour books like potato chips...trust me, I'm glad there are more of these books...because you can't have just ONE!

B004G5ZXVQ|5.0|If you are an REM fan, this is a must-have album. I actually didn't realize it was out until I heard the news the group was calling it quits, so I picked it up to wrap up my collection. It's right up there with Green and Automatic for the People, and although I really liked Accelerate, I think from top to bottom this one is a more enjoyable album. Best song: Uberlin.

B001HNE3NO|5.0|Sarahs Key By Tatiana Rosnay is based in the year 1942.When a 10 year old girl named Sarah Starzynski which is taken by her own people the French police in her hometown Paris,France.All the Jews were taken to the Ver'D'Hiv.Sarah lives in a apartment with her brother and parents . They were forced to leave with french police to the Veldormed D'Hiv with the other Thousands of Jews.Sarah had thought that it was only going to take a couple of hours and had locked up her brother in the cupboard room.   Sixty years later, the story takes place in Paris, France with Julia Jarmond, a reporter who is investigating a report on the Vel D' Hiv. Throughout her findings, she finds out her life is tied to a Jewish child that had been taken by the French Police many years ago.  Sarah Starzynski lived in the same building that Julia was moving into with her husband and daughter. Throughout the story Julia learns about the dark secrets her father in-law has been hiding.Now in year 2002 in paris on Verl'D'Hiv 60th year Anniversary ,Journalist Julia Jarmond is asked to write about the darkest days of France from the past.she then investigates a lot of the hidden family secrets which then connect to sarah.   I believe that the characters have changed both in a physically and mentally way. Sarah Starzynski which is a little 10 year old , is one of the the main character had her little brother Michael Starzynski who she was found by Mr. and Mrs. Dufuaure in the cupboard room.  While she was growing up and living with the Dufuaure's, Sarah meets their grandsons Edgard and Nicolas who then at the end she ends up growing up with.  Julia Jarmond marries Bertrand and they have a daughter named Zoë , Zoë  is about Fourteen years old and her husband Bertrand. Julia's father in-law Edouard and his mother Mame. During the story Julia helps Edouard with his past and meets Sarah's son William Rainsferd JR. Who Julia helps to recover his life he never knew of and then says that his life was a lie after all.   I Personally think that this book has taught me so much as a person.  I believed and thought that I had known a lot about the Holocaust, but really it was the little things that I never knew that made the most impact on myself. Jewish or not, this book would find that soft spot in your heart not only for the lives of thousands of jews but because of the story of sarah, the life that she had and had gone through. During the story I felt many different emotions some were sad some were rough even laughter because Tatiana Rosnay wrote with some humor. I would recommend this book to everyone young and old,its a really entertaining book to read and I hardly don't believe that any person that reads this book wont like it .  Especially when you are learning about the Holocaust this book helps you learn about the times in our history we never knew of.And It may be the best book that you ever read that will warm you heart up.

B004LDLI0S|1.0|I noticed a correaltion with the release of this ford translation by Ceo of Creative minds mike ford came a slew of negative reviews for the Kirkland translation. This is not a coincidence since many of the negative reviewers for the Kirkland book posted positive reviews of Elite Minds Products like their grammatical error software. This is not coincidence but an attemptmto discredit Kirkland. Trust me the Kirkland translation is by far the best most accurate translation. this new Ford translation that popped up recently is a dumbed down version of the Manheim translation.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I received this as a christmas present and have watched it 1 time, I plan to watch it again once I get it back (loaned to my mother-in-law).  The book was better in my opinion but I read a lot. Not saying the movie wasn't great it was fantastic but I still liked the book better.  I enjoyed the characters in this book I think they were all selected very well. Especially Hilda's mom (Sissy Spacek).  Overall a great movie!

B0036TGT3E|5.0|The Lion King is, without a doubt, the best animated feature Disney has ever produced. I have loved this movie from the moment it came out in theaters, and I was ridiculously excited to see it come out of the vault on Blu-Ray. The only thing that would have prompted a negative review from me is if they had forced me to watch the \\"extra\\" scenes and songs. If I recall correctly, when I borrowed the DVD from a friend last year, the feature film included some deleted scenes and an added song or two, and I didn't see a menu option to view the movie without them. I fell in love with the original movie, and that's the movie I want to see. Disney must have taken the hint and when they released it to Blu-Ray this time they didn't do that. I can't wait to sit down with my daughter when she is old enough to really watch it. I hope she loves The Lion King as much as I do.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|awesome game. love it. I would recommend. this game for allow age groups. I cant wait to play more games.
B005CIWNJG|1.0|Yes I agree with the last review. $20 far too much for Kindle edition. I did purchase this e-book and was very dissapointed, not up to the usual standard. The story really dragged. I am a fan of Rollins, but this gets the thumbs down from me.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it was ok but the games are a little dull. however for a free app we cant really complain too much.
B00632HWOG|1.0|It kept giving me an error message about my account being locked, I'll just use the one in the browser from now on, that's what I recommend you all do, too
B0054JZC6E|3.0|It was fun for a few, but I uninstalled within the hour.  It seems that the.main objective is to unlock all of the games, not take the time to enjoy playing them.  The games were over in a matter of a few seconds and you were left without a real sense of entertainment.

I did not receive any compensation for my review, and the views expressed herein are my own.<br /><br />I could hardly wait to jump into this book! After the conclusion of Matched, I was eager to find out how Cassia would set out to find Ky.<br /><br />I really like how Condie chose to write this book from the alternating points of view of Cassia and Ky. It really adds dimension to the story, and it is easy to see how something can be perceived as innocuous by one person and quite something else by another!<br /><br />Cassia has completely transformed from the Society girl she once was. She now takes chances and risks and, if given a \\"do-over,\\" I don't think she now would have burned her Grandfather's poem. Rather, she would keep it locked away and cherish it. Her character has become more complex, and I love that about her! I think the book cover aptly depicts the change in Cassia, her \\"breaking out\\" of the Society mould.<br /><br />Cassia has changed so much that I am now not so sure that her feelings for Ky are what she thinks they are! Was she drawn to Ky because he was an aberration...something different...something forbidden? Was she excited by the prospect of finding The Rising and taking risks with Ky and doing things she never thought that she could do? Or does she just love Ky for who he is?<br /><br />I enjoyed seeing Ky's development in this book. He is very cunning and wise way beyond his years. While I am uncertain of Cassia's true feelings for Ky, I do believe Ky is in love with Cassia but that he also worries about whether her feelings are truly just for him.<br /><br />This book is a little darker than Matched because we learn more and more secrets about the Society and what they are doing.<br /><br />Indie, the girl who is befriended by Cassia, is a little bit of a mystery. I hope that we found out more about her in the next book, as well as Hunter and Eli.<br /><br />And who is the mysterious \\"he\\" that Cassia is talking about at the end of the book? Is it Ky, Xander, or someone else entirely? I'm pondering different scenarios in my head!<br /><br />Overall, I really enjoyed the book, though not as much as I did Matched. I would still recommend the series to anyone who enjoys dystopia.<br /><br />My favourite quote from the book is from Cassia: \\"Love changes what is probable and makes unlikely things possible.\\"<br /><br />This audiobook is narrated by Kate Simses, who also narrated Matched, and Jack Riccobono. All points of view from Cassia are narrated by Simses, and Riccobono narrates the points of view from Ky. I am always a fan of multiple narrators, so I enjoyed the addition of Riccobono.<br /><br />I can't wait until November, when the final installment in the trilogy will be released!<br /><br />MY RATING: 4 stars!

B0045HCJG2|4.0|The DVD arrived quickly and was in excellent shape.  However it was not the DVD that was pictured...instead it was a combo DVD that included Cobra along with another movie...Tango & Cash.
B005T87QCI|3.0|Pretty cool game thinkit needs more characters.even though atom is on the cover you can't be him Recommend it though
0439023491|5.0|This book was really action packed and was so hard for me to put down! I don't want to give away anything but I really loved this book so much, I was telling all my friends about the trilogy and even got them to start reading it. This book really gets you to get to know the characters a lot more (I feel like). a very enjoyable and quick read :)
B0052GACNM|5.0|I have loved the music Tony sings since I was in San Francisco in 1967 listening to him sing \\"I left my heart\\" as I drove over the Golden Gate Bridge.His choice of duet partners is wonderful and as a 67 year old I probably wouldn't have heard the voice of Amy Winehouse if it wasn't for him. She had a terrific musical talent. I have both of his duet albums and love to listen to them when I am driving. His appeal is ageless!
0439023513|2.0|Honestly, I didn't like Mockingjay. I felt that Suzanne Collins wasted a lot of the book over insignificant details and things that didn't mean much and left out a lot of explaining towards the end. I loved The Hunger Games and Catching Fire SO much and honestly expected a lot more from Mockingjay. It's emotionally draining and I felt as though Suzanne could have done a much better job at writing this book compared to the two previous books.
B005KELR3A|5.0|Product is great!  Bought this product because it had a zipper, it turned out a lot thicker and with more cushion than I thought it would.  Love it!
1401307787|4.0|I came upon this book by accident and it was the title that drew me to it.  Absolutely enjoyed the book from beginning to end. It's something you can keep by your bedside, read a chapter (3-4 pages) and take in a little at a time.  In our fast paced world this is just what the doctor ordered to listen to your inner voice.  My once advice is DO NOT order the mediation cd's at the end of the book.  These are possibly the worst meditation cd's I've ever listened to.  Stay with the book and enjoy
B004MC8CA2|5.0|i love all the wonderful reading plans.  the parenting plan is my fav so far.  this is a wonderful app.
0307891402|4.0|this guide was by far one of the nicest that i have ever purghased.  ver well put together.  the only thing that i wish it had was a digital version.  it is a little time consuming getting to the information sometimes, due to the sheer amount of content in the game.
B004M9ZI0M|5.0|This film version of The Tempest worked for me.  It was well acted throughout, with a memorable performance from Helen Mirren.  While I am usually something of a Shakespeare purist, I thought the transformation of Prospero into Prospera was inspired, linking Prospero/Prospera's exile to false accusations of witchcraft and introducing a mother-daughter relationship into the story.  The magical elements on which Shakespeare depends to advance his plot are brilliantly imagined and presented by Julie Taymor, with a translucent and shape-changing Ariel.  Shakespeare's language (some of his best) comes across beautifully, and with an intimacy that can be difficult to achieve on stage.  There is wonderful chemistry between the characters (Prospera-Ariel, Miranda-Ferdinand, etc), and most of the scenes draw added power from the dramatic Hawaiian landscapes on which they are filmed.  The action is well paced, with the film lasting an hour and fifty minutes (short for Shakespeare).  We are lucky to have such an engaging and imaginative film of The Tempest.  I sincerely hope that Julie Taymor will have the opportunity to film more of Shakespeare's plays.  After watching The Tempest, I would dearly love to see what she would do with A Midsummer Night's Dream.
B000UOOT1W|5.0|this is a replacement cd for the one that was lost but anyway this is a great cd with many great songs and worth listening too!
B0063IH60K|5.0|works like a champ.  no problems installing, no hangups.  plenty of options to set the type of game you are used to playing
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|love this app I even use it to take.notes in school what id reccomend though is using the notebook feature.
B0018CWEYY|5.0|Finally after 3 great seasons and a most convenient writer's strike, LOST season four occurs. This is the season when a new group of people arrive on the Island from a freighter and claim to be there to rescue the survivors. Furthermore, we learn that the Island is having some strange issues with it's relation to Time. LOST opened yet another door to hundreds of crackpot theories about the show and its mysteries. We also see some of the survivors get off of the Island in a series of flashfowards. It is a great season, but almost more of a segway between season 3 and season 5. A very interesting plot developement is the discovery of more Dharma Initiative stations. We learn more about the Island's history with a flashback for Ben, and also confirm that MICHAELmATICIAN was on the freighter when it arrived to the Island. He was then transported to 1954 and joined the Others (the British Others, more on that in Season 5). Finally, we get to see the Cabin and what importance it may/may not/doesn't at all have. Sadly, \\"You All Everybody\\" is not used in this season. Driveshaft went New Wave, but not like MICHAELmATICIAN...<br /><br />2.342
B0013HQ2UG|5.0|The condition of the album and the speed with which it was delivered was excellent. The album itself is bloody classic. Anyone who breathes should listen to it.
B001MYIXAC|4.0|I'm really looking for things that are different, outside mainstream cinema and outside the current vampire realm that seems to be somewhat cookie cutter.  This is different in the realm of vampire movies, and I really appreciate that.  I don't watch many teen flicks or coming of age stories, but I did watch this all the way through and liked it, alot.  I was routing for the kid in the end, for him to escape his bad situation, and his new \\"friend\\" perfectly helped him do that.  I'm really glad to find a vampire movie that is not the same as all the others these days.  And I was glad to find a movie featuring kids that held my interest.
B005UBNKZG|1.0|these cpus need a bulldozer they need to be run over by a bulldozer second of the new fx cpus that is junk unstable even at normal levels maybe the next version will be better when they make all 8 cores work at the same time
B004EQAVHI|5.0|I'm really gravitating to the less mainstream and not super popular movies and books these days.  I had never heard of this as far as it being in theaters.  I loved it.  It haunted me for days after watching it.  The weird thing was that I wondered for an hour or so after watching it if it was maybe a true story, if something like this could have really happened.  Of course it couldn't, except way long ago and in secret.  I got so caught up in the characters and the tiny details, like the people making deliveries to the schools and halfway houses making such an effort not to get to know or care for the kids, to protect themselves from the horror and saddness of the whole thing.  This is a movie that has alot of saddness but I enjoyed watching it so much and it really made me think.  I think there might be people out there who have philosophies that this kind of thing would be okay.  So I think movies like this are terrific to keep us thinking and watching what we do to each other as human beings.  I was so glad to see Carey Mulligan in something more than just a supporting role.  I think she's very talented.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I loved it. so much to do. I really enjoy playing all these games. I think they should get more
1572816112|5.0|I absolutely think these cards are stunning.  I could read them instantly without the book.  The symbolism is mostly correct but the cards are so well designed that they make you feel the meanings.  I had a very deep subconscious connection instantly. I carried them for two weeks just showing them to people.  My brother reads psychically and though he thought they were somewhat dark, he could read with them.
B003ASLJO0|1.0|I'm not crazy about this movie. I think the best part of the whole movie is the ending. When Walt leave's his house to the church. Instead of his son's family. They don't deserve that house after the way they were to him. I'm also happy that he gave his car to that chines kid instead of his granddaughter. She also doesn't deserve anything,
0446556750|1.0|I'm one of those who can't understand why this guy is so popular.  No mystery in this book at all - you know from page 1 who the bad guy and the good guys are; you know it will end up with the bad guy getting his and the good guys triumphing.  Shtick.  The rest is courtroom drama, mostly.  Not badly done there, but 450 pp of courtroom drama?  If that's your idea of a thriller, fine.  Connelly can't write for beans.  His grammar borders on the illiterate - quote, \\"should have showed\\" instead of \\"should have shown\\" (this was not within quotation marks, it was the author/narrator speaking, and it was not a 'typo'.  He seems to write for a 12-year-old mentality.  And finally and most frustratingly - why can't these people inject some humor into their drab text?  Look at Nelson deMille's 'Plum Island', General's Daughter\\", 'Up Country' or 'Gold Coast'.  Wonderfully imaginative, humorous, suspenseful - we need more deMilles.  (PS - his early books were trash too though, like \\"By the Rivers of Babylon'.)  This book was his last chance with me.  I read the three original Harry Bosch books (well,  2 1/2, couldnt put up with the 3rd).  I thought I'd give him one more chance with this book.  That's it.
0525478817|5.0|I'm always a sucker for a cancer book. Don't really know why since I'm very much a hypochondriac and since my reading of The Fault in Our Stars have already scheduled myself for a physical... just in case, you know, I have cancer. Don't judge.<br /><br />The Fault in Our Stars was amazing. I read it in a few short hours. I was that engrossed and fell that in love with its characters. Sixteen year old Hazel is living with cancer and upon her mother's request begins attending a youth cancer support group. There she meets Augustus Waters - cancer survivor and the type of guy who grabs life by the reins and just runs with it.<br /><br />Yes, this is a cancer book. But don't see that as a downer. Both Hazel and Augustus are such uplifting characters. They give the story a light tone and not make it as suffocating as some cancer books can be. Their witty sense of humors, the way that they deal with sickness, their friendship and budding romance as well as their obsession with An Imperial Affliction and its author make a fascinating read.<br /><br />Needless to say, it IS a cancer book, so there were tears shed on my end, but I would not trade those moments for laughter. I was enthralled by this story and was very impressed by the way Mr. Green tackled some heavy subjects in a tender yet masterful way.<br /><br />Hands down The Fault in Our Stars is one of the best books I've read in a while... and that's not a \\"cancer perk.\\"
B0054JZC6E|4.0|fin game with lots of cool mini games but lagged some of the time. it is a really good game overall.
B004SMDJ9U|5.0|Haven is one of the best SyFy shows ever created and has such a constant theme going on. One of the best things about this show is that Agent Audrey Parker shows up and is not immediately accepted; she has to work her way into the community's heart and she does. This tv show is for anyone who likes a bit of mystery in their lives and enjoys being led on a merry chase.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I think its a great way to keep you busy and to pass the time by, but I don't like the ads the interupt. they're annoying.
B000EUDAWG|4.0|Being scared of spiders, the grandson was a little hesitant at first in playing with it.  But after a few minutes we had it going everywhere, and then it was used to combat a remote controlled truck he had also received for Christmas.  The spider doesn't do well on carpeted surfaces and operates fairly slow on a hard surface, and it is limited on going over any obstacles in it's path.  But, overall it seemed to be a fun gift for him and everyone remarked how creepy it was.
B000002KEV|5.0|Best Deep Purple Album Ever<br /><br />This is not just the best live Deep Purple Album but the best Deep Purple album ever. The quality is good; packaging is good and over all it is a good buy. To own this album if you are a Deep Purple fan or a metal or hard rock fan is a must. This is a classic. The most important reason to own it is because the best version of Smoke on the Water live is recorded on this album! Check it out.
0307949508|4.0|I loved this intriguing story and the heroine, Lisbeth Salander is probably the best female character ever written.  She is so compelling that I wanted to rush through the other story lines just to get to hers.  The only problem with this book and all three in the trilogy is that not being from  Sweden it was very hard to keep track of all the names of places and streets.  Also, Larsson goes into too much detail on minor characters.  I don't think we need a full bio every time a new character pops up.<br />[[ASIN:B0052YFFOK Breaking News: A Novel]]
B000002H92|5.0|An Essential Doors Album to Own<br /><br />To own this album for Doors fans is a must. If you are new to Doors, then start here. To listen to Doors, you must listen to them live. Many Live Doors albums are a mess simply because either Jim Morrison was drunk on the stage or the recording was a disaster. This album on the contrary is a great recording of the live Doors with Jim Morrison able to perform decently (but not sober)! It is a well put together awesome album.
159514188X|5.0|Originally posted on Pawing Through Books on 7/28/11<br /><br />I was introduced to this book in my literacy class in college.  We were discussing ways we can do interesting literacy lesson plans including media.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to any teen, parents/relatives of teens, and educators.  Thirteen Reasons Why had an amazing message about bullying and its effects on teens.  Jay Asher did a great job telling the story of a teen that takes her own life after being bullied.  It was very well written and you were able to connect with each of the main characters in the story.  The flow of the story line was great and it kept you guessing who the next person on the cassette tapes were going to be.  You wanted to know exactly why Hannah decided to take her own life, what lead to this, and how each person tied into it.<br /><br />I loved that Jay Asher used cassette tapes to have Hannah tell her story.  It was interesting to see the way she told each of the 13 stories differently and you were able to see how each one impacted her life.  This book really makes you think about your actions toward others and how they can effect them, sometimes in ways you would never have expected.  Overall, Thirteen Reasons Why is book with a great story, a awesome message, and that was superbly written.
B00000JBFW|5.0|The Last of the Mohicans!<br /><br />This is the last heavy duty, meaningful and well recorded album by Deep Purple. None of that soft rock or mellow drama! The album is full of some hard rock, heavy kicking songs; in fact this is their last seriously hardcore album with great beats, good lyrics and heavy sound. This album was their come back and revival album (after many years) which indeed worked well for them. If you are a Deep Purple collector or a Metal and Hard Rock fan, I strongly recommend for you to purchase this album. This is a well recorded and well performed album full of great songs.
B0002F6AH0|4.0|It's still the best!<br />  This Doc. was made in the early seventies which gave it the advantage of being made while MANY of the people who were there were still alive, BIG advantage. That said, I'm a military historian and throughout I noticed inaccuracies such as \\"80,000 US Soldiers Surrendered At Bataan\\" The entire US army consisted of 130,000 men and 70% were not stationed in the PI. And the number of dead in Dresden was 30,000 not 100,000. Much has been learned since the end of the war and these flaws in statistics DO NOT detract from the quality of the work.<br />  Sir Lawrence Olivier as narrator was a stroke of brilliance. His narration isn't a dry, statistical monologue, its the telling of a heroic and sadly horrific story in a voice that rings like 19th century Edwardian England.<br /> NOTE: As the passage of time \\"has\\" corrected statistics, it's done nothing for the quality of the video. So, since the video quality \\"has\\" degraded, I couldn't give the full five stars. HEY, Thames TV, with the digital technology we have today its time you gave this puppy a face lift to remove the \\"ticks\\" and \\"fogginess\\".
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Great game and fun way to waste some time. My 10 year old son loves to try to beat my scores.  He does on some of them!
1451627289|5.0|Ok, I rarely ever write a review, or rather my opinion. When I do write a review, it is always very short....as this one will be too. Not being an essayist, that's all I can do.<br /><br />I chose to listen to this book instead of reading it. It is a very long book. I listened to it on 3 MP3 disks. Since normally 1 MP3 disk can contain an entire book, then 3 told me this is very long.<br /><br />One of the things that made me love this book is the narrator. Craig Wasson's voice is fantastic..He put all the emotions and movements (if you will) that I imagined how Mr King must have wanted it to be. The narration was - I am at a loss for words - just great. Without all the inflections, emotions including crying, yelling, passionate words, it would be just a book. Craig Wasson gave everyone a distinct voice. My favorite was Al Templeton's voice...just like you might imagine for those who read it rather than listening to it. Mr Wasson gave one of the charactors a Jimmy Steward voice and another sounded like Charleton Heston.<br /><br />In conclusion, Craig Wasson's reading was fantastic! And, to listen to Mr King's voice in the \\"afterward\\" was so much better than reading it. I must admit, however, the story was a tad long. I still gave it 5 stars and it kept me excited every time I got into my car and could continue listening.
0316056863|2.0|After reading approximately halfway through this book, I found myself wondering why I was continuing to read this book since I found it extremely dry, boring, and just simply unappealing to me personally.  So I stopped reading it at around the halfway point.  I am sure I am not missing anything since I found nothing appealing or interesting in this book.  I did like the part written about her dad and his persona, however, everything else I was reading was equivalent to reading a textbook in college for a general education class you had absolutely no interest in.  How this book has four stars out of five is amazing to me.  Maybe the publisher pays people to leave positive reviews?
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is a lot better than I expected. it deffiniatly  deserves five stars. I have no complaints and cant wait for more games to come out.
0553801473|2.0|I am very disappointed with this book. There is a lot of description of events but no real advancement of the story line. This is the 5th book I've read. How many more do I have to read before anything of significance happens? Please at least throw me a bone with the next book or I'm done with this series.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Amazing app. read the bible anywhere in tons of different languages and versions. easy to use with ability to save scriptures you like by either highlighting them or bookmarking them. leave your own notes and your friends and followers can read them. maintain reading plans at ease. love this app and the people behind the scenes that make it happen for FREE! you cant beat it and you know you need it!
B000007XUQ|5.0|We received the CD several days before the expected date which was a welcomed surprise!  Everything was well packaged and in perfect condition.  Thank you!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I use to have a big basket with several different translations of the Bible and a few notebooks taking up space next to my chair.  Now, I just pull out my Kindle and pull up my reading for the day.  I can look up scriptures in all different translations and write my daily journaling.  I also take it to church and can follow along no matter what translation they are reading from.  Love it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|while some of the games were very similar, I still liked all of the options. for the most part, I was pleased with the app
B004I744AS|5.0|I didn't know what to expect with this dictionary but was pleasantly surprised and it works very well. I recommend it and the price is right.
B000025XDP|5.0|This is the best compilation of Tina Turner's post-Ike years and includes many of her best tracks from that era (especially \\"Better Be Good to Me\\"). I have been a huge fan of Tina since \\"River Deep - Mountain High\\" and I was glad to get that #1 favorite Tina song of mine on this compilation. By the way, I'm reviewing the original U.K. version, which has \\"Be Tender With Me Baby\\" and \\"Addicted to Love (Live).\\" The U.S. version drops those two tracks in favor of \\"What You Get is What You See\\" and \\"Look Me in the Heart.\\" Between the two versions, the U.K. version is better (in my opinion).
B0060V1WJ6|5.0|Steve Carell and Emma Stone shine in this wonderful story about love from a teenage crush to a lifelong marriage gone stale. The story centers around a series of characters at different stages in their lives, but all are looking for the same thing: someone to love and be loved by.<br /><br />This is Stevel Carell at his best.  We all know he can be funny from his Daily Show roots, but my favorite Steve Carell is when his humor shines through a performance of deeper meaning.  This is that movie.  If you enjoyed him in the movie Dan in Real Life, this is the same Steve.  The Steve that is so honest you laugh and cry all at once.<br /><br />Emma Stone also has a notable performance.  I haven't loved all of her most recent work but this performance is true to her roots.  Quirky but definitely showing a sexy side.<br /><br />And whoa, where has Ryan Gosling been all my life?  He very convincingly played the ladies man - the guy who plays every moment so well, but you just don't care because he is just yummy.  Definitely A+ eye candy.<br /><br />The script and story are what truly makes the film special.  It has the thoughtful composition of Magnolia, it depicts a slightly darker more \\"R rated\\" suburbia reminiscent of American Beauty, and the dialogue is sharp and witty.<br /><br />I wholeheartedly recommend this movie.
B001QL5MAA|4.0|After mostly enjoying \\"clean\\" science fiction, where everything is nice and shiny, Reynolds' Revelation Space is a great change! Bringing back fond memories of Blade Runner, it took some effort to build the new scene in my mind. But, after a while, reinforced by Reynolds scientific eloquence, this future universe became engaging and plausible.  The plot twists come nicely together in the end and inspires for another read to make sure you didn't miss anything.
B0041KKYEM|5.0|The beloved ballet \\"Swan Lake\\" is the most beautiful and compelling of all ballets. But, the film \\"Black Swan\\" is its destroyer -- a psycho dramatic voyage into the underworld of ballet.  Nina Sayers, a budding ballerina extraordinaire, finds herself in a waking nightmare as she ventures as a maiden into the domain of the black swan. The pressure on Nina is intense. For starters, she dwells in the crucible of the all-consuming world of a New York ballet company.  At home, she fends off the hovering presence of an overbearing mother, a former ballet dancer who never made it out of the corps not even to soloist let alone to principal dancer.  Her dual dominance of her daughter runs hot and cold from loving acceptance to grim disapproval. She wants her daughter to succeed and yet, perhaps not too much.  Nina has no close friends in the ballet company with its cutthroat competiveness. Yet the company is her life force. Bereft, too, of normal sexual release with another, the sole focus of her physical body is as an object of the dance.  It is the presence of Lily, the free spirited newcomer to the company that pushes Nina's buttons, driving her unbearably.  I couldn't help noting Lily as a take-off on Lilith, the dark soul who in Jewish folklore is to have been Adam's first wife before the creation of Eve.  There is a real-life experience of complete mental collapse in the ballet world. It is known that the Russian ballerina Olga Spessivtseva was institutionalized for twenty years in an upper New York state hospital before being released. The ballerina had visited and intensely observed mental patients in preparation for the famed mad scene in the ballet \\"Giselle\\" and this led to her own bout with insanity.  All in all, there is much that is out of sync in this film.  The role of the prince in the ballet performance is danced by a guy named David (the name itself means beloved) whose emotions run only from A to B.  He doesn't emotionally engage as he \\"walks the ballerina\\" in performance like a somnambulist. Nina Sayers is too much work for him. He even drops her in performance and later just looks dazed in bewilderment at her fate as the condemned swan.  It's been said that ballet is woman, and yet, ballet is nowhere without a compelling male dancer.  Margot Fonteyn writes in her book \\"The Magic Of Dance,\\" (I am fortunate to have an autographed copy) that \\"Dance is very much an man's activity.\\"  I cannot imagine what ballet would be in today's world without the foregoing geatness of Rudolf Nureyev, my overall favorite dancer, and the charismatic talent of Mikhail Baryshnikov who made ballet respectable for the male dancer through his role in the ballet film \\"The Turning Point.\\"  Ballet would mean nothing for me today without the gentle excellence of Angel Corella, a principal dancer with American Ballet Theatre.  In October of 1986, a ballet review that I wrote \\"The Paris Opera Ballet's Controversial Swan Lake\\" appeared in \\"The World & I,\\" an international magazine of the Washington (DC) Times.  This disturbing version was choreographed by Rudolf Nureyev as a nightmarish dream of the principal male character.  It destroyed the beauty of the eternal vow made in traditional versions to Odette by the prince by never even acknowledging it.  Nureyev, who danced in some performances as the prince and in others as the tutor, did not dance in the one I reviewed, implies that the prince is destroyed by the dark influence of his tutor who becomes his Rothbart.  I did see Rudolf Nureyev dance in a production of \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" that he choreographed at the Metropolitan Opera on July 18, 1981. As Romeo, his greatness still shone brilliantly. Margot Fonteyn, however was relegated to dancing the role of Juliet's mother, Lady Capulet.  After this performance, I saw Rudolf Nureyev outside the backstage entrance. I handed him an individual packet of a vitamin product that I had been selling. He took it, flashed that famous smile of his at me, andasked me what it was.  I told him, vitamins.  He then graciously autographed my program....one of my most cherished of all the autographs I've collected.  The very best aspect of \\"Black Swan\\" is its incredible casting.  Natalie Portman embodied Nina Sayers to perfection. She truly earned the Oscar she was awarded for Best Actress.  Benjamin Millepied, principal dancer and choreographer with New York City Ballet, downplayed his charisma in the role of David and yet his smoldering presence came through.  Vincent Cassel blew me away as the artistic director, fascinating me as much as he did Nina Sayers. I was stunned when I learned that he was an actor but not a dancer.  Mila Kunis as Lily was compelling and I enjoyed her role but, other than in appearance, in no way did she resemble an actual ballerina. I can't imagine that a tattoo such as she displayed on her back would be tolerated in a major company and the ballerinas whom I have known were disciplined in the extreme...free spirits inside perhaps...but never, never in public nor on display.  This film is a must for every true lover of ballet, if only for its glimpse into a dancer's world which never can be fully imagined from a pristine seat in the audience.
B000002NFM|5.0|I was in Highschool when this CD first came out and I think I listened to it on repeat for about 2 weeks straight.  The heavy bass beats, the trippy trance notes, and the high energy all come together on this CD to make it one of the best Techno/Dance CDs of all time.  Check out the videos on youtube or the samples here and you'll be hooked.
B0000AQS0F|4.0|Well, Amazon done it again.  The nephew requested this DVD set for Christmas and all I had to do was point, click and bam...my order was complete and on it's way.  Thanks for having the exact gift and making shopping so easy.  Keep up the good work.

140053271X|4.0|The NOOK e-book reader compares favourably with the KINDLE, as well as being cheaper.  Once you have mastered the idiosyncratic technique for converting books to EPUB format and loading them onto the NOOK - I suggest getting a copy of CALIBRE which will streamline the conversion process.  The NOOK is lighter and more convenient to carry around than the KINDLE - my wife crocheted a nice neat carry bag for mine.  I still have not mastered the bookmarking techniques (maybe I should read the instructions) but the NOOK has a convenient one or two click method of returning to where you were last.  TO sum up - I am very satisfied.  Kiap2012
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I love the amount of games on this and the diversity, but unfortunately I'll sometimes purchase a game only to find out I've wasted points because said games rely on the motion capture on the device, which is not actually a feature of the Kindle Fire in the same way as a smartphone. So a few games don't work but that leaves 100 of them that do and that makes the app well worth it.

1433502410|3.0|I started from the beginning and was disappointed in the commentary of the first 11 chapters of Genesis and in the \\"Genesis and Science\\" introduction to the book. They take a very liberal view, more toward old earth creationism. Some examples are that God is still resting and the sabbath day which is still going on as we speak. Saying that it would be rash to think that the flood had any real impact on geology. I think there is a lot of good information in this study bible but I am disappointed how they handles this part of the bible. They do present different opinions on certain issues from what I have seen so far which is good. Hopefully there will be valuable information later on as I continue reading.
0307001466|5.0|Utterly charming story encouraging self-confidence, exploration and roll-playing by Mary Blair, long-time Disney staff artist who was the principal designer for Small World. She was hugely influential on the mid-century illustration and animation vernacular, and her command of the medium is showcased well here. The newer editions have been recently re-scanned from the original paintings, so they supposedly look more true than even the first edition (because of better printing technology? I guess.) Basically one of the greatest children's books ever.
B005HSG3VK|1.0|Terrible cover. It folds, but does not under any circumstances stay up. The black cover is not sturdy enough to hold the kindle. Don't buy! I am returning as soon as I can.

0312641893|5.0|For me, fairy tale re-tellings are kind of hit or miss. As with any re-telling, you kind of have to assume you already know what's going to happen. That was not the case with \\"Cinder.\\" Although it definitely has elements of the classic Cinderella story, there were really enough new additions that I was kept guessing! Primarily, the setting was so...quirky and new that it totally pulled me in! Seriously. About 10 pages in and I hooked!<br /><br />Generally, I'm not a big sci-fi fan. I don't like to read books that feature robots and spaceships and stuff, yet Cinder's world somehow didn't come off as cold, metallic, and unfeeling - even though the main character is a cyborg. And man, I never thought I could actually be rooting for a cyborg! I found Cinder to be really well-written. She was smart, independent, and every bit the tomboy. She just came off as real and down-to-earth, which really helped highlight the nastiness of her step-mother and sister. My absolute favorite was the side character of Iko - an android and Cinder's best friend. She's the perfect support to Cinder's otherwise lonesome life. I wish I could get my hands on her personality chip.<br /><br />The world that Meyer writes is also really well-developed. New Beijing is a fully realized place which merges technology with elements of the traditional. I never thought I could appreciate an environment that featured both hover-crafts AND cherry blossoms. The conflicts and cultures that are portrayed in the book feel deeply rooted in the story - and never rushed or forced. Even the race of Lunars have depth and so much thought behind them.<br /><br />If you like your story packaged into one neat story, beginning to end, you won't get that here. The book is built on there being a sequel. With that being said, I completely and utterly LOVED \\"Cinder,\\" and feel it's absolutely worth it to read this book and wait for the sequel!
0307595862|3.0|I read few crime thrillers so try to pick them carefully. The Snowman got a lot of rave reviews and is an international bestseller in its genre. If you're in the right mood you'll find most of it engrossing but you'll think less of it if you give it some thought weeks later.  I've read many of the old thrillers and I don't remember the sloppiness in thinking and bad editing as exhibited in The Snowman.  A hero should have some demons in him and I think giving Harry problems with alcoholism is a nice touch. So is using a rare disease as a major drive of the plot. The killer's weapon is also interesting. To many readers using Oslo, Norway as the setting will add interest just as Stockholm and its millieu was interesting in Stig Larsen's fine trilogy. Here is what I mean by sloppy thinking and bad editing: near the end of the book when the killer shoots at our hero nothing happens. He has forgotten to check if the gun was loaded. Yet he is almost inhuman in his ability to break into homes and apartments without the occupants noticing until he is looming over them. Near the end, when the situation is totally desperate and the hero has only a few minutes to save his love from a gruesome death, the author interrupts the action while our hero ruminates for half a page on something that has nothing to do with the crisis at hand. A victim manages to implant a small hatchet into the killer that we are later told cut an artery. Yet the killer is able to chase her into the woods, in deep snow, kill her, and drag her body to his car and then come back to the house to tidy up.  It seems as if modern pop culture is becoming stupider and lives in illusion and delusion with no demand for realism.  Sex in this book makes you think of two dogs copulating rather than anything erotic or romantic.One murder in modern crime novels is no longer enough. You must have a big pile of corpses. You find fewer villains that are simply evil and a lot more psychopaths. I'd like to find more crime writers as John MacDonald and his wonderful Travis McGee series or Raymond Chandler and his unforgettable Phillip Marlowe.riters as John MacDonald and his wonderful Travis McGee series or Raymond Chandler and his unforgettable Phillip Marlowe.

B005ORVN1Y|4.0|This isn't a review of the music, its a review of the manufacturing of the CD sleeve's for each album, the Show of hands and Signals sleeves are folded like a double album LP which would have a double fold, they both had real poor folding creases and were forced into the sector 3 box,  i was really disappointed that i had to sit here and rework the fold creases so they would work properly, definitely a manufacturing defect and I assume some uncaring person loading the sector 3 box? if your a rush fan such as i am you would want your collection to be perfect without wrinkles or stress creases where the product should be flat and smooth. Bummer, So much for quality control, I'm thankful the CD's appear to be fine but have yet to be able to give a listen. On a good note my Sector's 1 and 2 did not have this problem.. Too bad there isn't a way to get them replaced short of paying shipping to return, not worth the time and effort
0670022950|5.0|This is the most important book I have read in a long long time.

0307957934|5.0|This thriller is set in Geneva.  It opens with a break-in at the palatial estate of a brilliant hedge fund manager, Alex Hoffmann.  Alex was formerly a physicist working at CERN when he was sought out by his evential business partner, Hugo.  They started a hedge fund that quickly became one of the best-performing in the world because of the sophisticated algorithms and mathematical geniuses that Alex recruited to work there.  The break-in at Alex's house is the frame for the manhunt of the person who broke in, but this is only a small part of the story.  Alex's computer research has brought him to the point where the hedge fund, his artist wife Gabrielle and even his partner Hugo don't think they know him anymore.  Alex quickly becomes a man alone trying to solve the mystery at a breakneck pace before it's too late.  The world of science, math and finance here are exciting and alive.  The author has masterfully woven together the well-developed personalities of the main characters with the action and suspense of this thriller!

B001FB5634|5.0|We watch every apocalyptic movie we can find and this is one of our favorites so far.  The acting in it is phenomenal, especially by Viggo Mortensen.  It felt and looked very realistic, not prettied and cheesed up like most movies.  I've seen people say it's too depressive, but what do you think living in that type of situation would be?  That is what makes it so realistic and not phony.  It's about the desire to survive in even the most dire and bleak situations.

1451627289|5.0|I don't think I've ever written a book review in all my years buying and reading books from Amazon.  (I HAVE reviewed a few products, though.)  However, this novel inspired me to write one as it's nothing short of amazing.  When I was a kid, I'd devour Stephen King's earlier novels such as Carrie, The Stand, The Shining, etc.  I ended up growing out of that \\"horror\\"/supernatural genre and moved on to what I thought at the time was more \\"quality\\" fiction.  Let me tell you, though... Mr. King has a resurrected (so to speak) fan in me with this novel.  I won't re-tell the story because others here have done that very well, but I do believe this is his best work ever and probably the best novel I've read in years. The characters are so real you can reach out and touch them (and you simply can't help but fall in love with Jake, a.k.a. George).  Not to mention that the pacing, the momentum, the suspense of this book are crafted brilliantly.  Whether you were \\"alive\\" or even aware when JFK was assassinated or not, this story will have you mesmerized.  I absolutely LOVED it!
0553801473|1.0|This book was the biggest disappointment I've had in years. It dragged on and on and by the middle of the book I found myself beginning to skip over much of it. I will never buy another George R.R. Martin book....I can't believe we waited all this time for such a miserable book
B0062NAX1U|3.0|This movie has great meaning to it but to me personally, who isn't a believer in god is too religious for me. If anything, this movies make god seem even more made believe.. it makes me feel god is entirely made up for people to remain sane in emotional stress implying if he didn't exist.. they would do something bad to themselves. After all, no one has ever been able to prove he is real. How is god a he anyways? who made that part up? Haha.  Overall, decent movie but too religious.  I won't lie, I enjoyed it though.  (Purposely refuse to capitalize god for all the Nazi grammar people)
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app ,its perfect for on the go or just for siting at home and praying to the lord...
159514188X|4.0|Jay Asher's provocative book reminds us how important little things can be. When you add all these little things they can weigh so much. The book is not perfect, but will definitely start conversations about the ways in which teens harass one another and the consequences of this harassment.<br /><br />I would have liked a little more engagement in the book. SPOILER alert. I would have liked to see what happened to the biggest perpetrators. I wanted to see that predator, Bryce, get what he deserves. And, I would have liked to see the aftermath--oh some six months later and how the teens were treating one another. Suicide is such a heavy topic and most of us can remember how every little thing was so dramatic to our lives as a teen.<br /><br />I will chime in that this book isn't just for teens--adults will love it too. I also think that the book would work nicely in the college classroom--in English, Literature, Women's Studies and Education classes.
B001HNE3NO|2.0|This book had so much potential, but in the end was tedious and unsatisfying. Two stars are for the historical perspective. The story itself fell flat.
1451627289|5.0|I am biased. I have pretty much enjoyed every Stephen King book that I have read. OK. OK. I didn't get sucked into the Dark Towers series, but everything else of his I have read. And, I devoured this book. The premise was interesting--time traveling to change the future. What would have happened if JFK had never been shot? The book made me wonder what would have happened if MLK Jr. had not been shot, too.<br /><br />I have been dying to talk to others about this book, but most of my friends have not read it, yet. SPOILER Alert. I was torn with the future, though. Obviously the Civil Rights Acts were not passed, which were really part of the legacy due to his untimely murder. But, would the US have see an increase in racism to the degree that the latter part of the book displayed? And, would another cost have been the environment? It's plausible or is it? Even if you don't agree with King, he's going to make you think about the possibilities.<br /><br />Of course, I wanted the protagonist to help his beloved, but King books don't always work that way and I thank him for the ending. This is a good book and if you like King's work--I do think you'll enjoy this book.
0312576463|5.0|Loved it!  Particularly for the dialogue and character development. The dialogue is inventive and consistent with the characters' personalities, which Mr. Franzen skillfully brings to life. There are no supermen or wonder-women, only ordinary people in whose strengths,  defects, successes, tragedies and emotional challenges we recognize ourselves, our family members, friends, bosses, crazy neighbors, etc.  The novel's scope is significant, covering three generations pretty well and touching on a fourth, and his plot is an emotional roller coaster! The biggest treat is the microscope Franzen focuses on the main characters; not by looking ever deeper, but by allowing the characters to grow and experiment and simply react to life. In that sense, his language IS like a microscope, focused enough to evince subtle detail and constantly panning over a vast landscape. The prose is rich, often elegant, with phrases that I often stopped to re-read just because they sounded so good or were so very clever.
B000AYEL1A|5.0|I saw this movie when I was 15 or 16. Fell in love with it and bought the album. Well, now have the CD and DVD and watch it all the time, listen to the music, which is surpurb, almost every day to get me moving! Barbra and Kris do a wonderful job. She is beautiful and sooooo talented. He is so handsome and knows his stuff!  I love this movie. My younger friends dont understand why I love this movie so much, but seeing it so long ago and loved it then, it puts me back in the 70's. I recommend this movie (and the DVD) to any Barbra or Kris fan. Wonderful love story to boot!

0553579908|4.0|I would rank Clash of Kings as Martin's 3rd best book. After Game of Thrones (his 2nd best), this book stumbles a bit and start off pretty slow. It's not until the 2nd half of the book that you realize it was all build-up to really knock your socks off towards the end. Once the action starts, it doesn't stop. Fantasy, action, drama, intrigue, complex characters and relationships, this book has it all. It's amazing finale continues without missing a step in book 3, Storm of Swords, Martin's best book by far. The series dies out a bit after that. Martin should have made this a trilogy and ended it in book 3, which would have made this book even more significant. Read this before Season 2 premiers on HBO this April, you'll enjoy the show that much more!

0205313426|5.0|This should be on the desk of every writer. I mean every person who writes for publication, of any kind, or in any manner which is formal in the slightest. Authors, journalists, students, managers, technicians, engineers, and so on; each need to distill their thoughts into a concise format that is legible. This book is aimed at doing precisely that.<br /><br />I'm a writer with a great deal of experience in writing both of fiction and non-fiction. I was raised by two English teachers. This book is still able to educate me. More importantly, it serves as a piece of reference material for times when any doubt creeps in.<br /><br />There are longer reference works. Many are held in high regard. But in my eyes none of them are quite what this work is. Eloquent, Concise, and Perfect.<br /><br />If you are a writer (see above), buy this. If you love a writer, give them this as a gift.

B005DC68NI|5.0|There's nothing else to it. This book must be read by self-publishing authors. It is insightful and offers a good description of the major sticking points. It also has an awesome cover (like every other work he has published) . . . so you know he's taking his own advice. If I had three thumbs, I'd use them all. As it is, both are sticking way, way up.

0142410705|5.0|This is the first John Green book I have read, and I loved it. I don't want to give any spoilers away, so I apologize if this seems short.  The main and supporting character are well written and developed. Each one had his or own personality that shown threw the first person narrative. The plot moved along nicely and I was able to follow it along without thinking any \\"meta-thoughts\\" as I call them. Basically, my mind was so busy absorbing the book that I was able to think, \\"Oh, what a sneaky plot twist\\" or \\"This thing was placed here and this other thing will happen now\\".  The only things that took away from the enjoyment were the footnotes and the sudden ending. First, what the eff are footnotes doing in a work of fiction? It was distracting sometimes from the actual story even if the footnotes were educational. The ending of the book seemed more like the ending of a chapter and I am waiting to find out what happens next. Sadly, John Green has stated (in this very book) that he does not plan on making a sequel.  I highly recommend this book.

8186336141|5.0|This book was on a list of recommended readings from my Advanced Hatha Yoga Teacher Training course and I waited 6 months to get it.  The 6 months of waiting was time misplaced because this definitely should have been a requirement for the course.  No disrespect to the wonderful Yoga school&iexcl;K<br /><br />Extensive foundational elements of regular practice are described in this book.  It&iexcl;¦s so worth the time and effort to read.  Throughout regular practice I&iexcl;¦ve discovered many texts on Asana, Bandhas, and Pranayama in different publications.  This book blends the subjects well in a condensed format.  All 550 plus pages worthº  The asanas are broken down under Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced groups with different kramas (levels) for each.  Each asana is titled by the Sanskrit and English name with guidance on how to come into the posture, drawings of the final posture, how long you should aim to maintain it, where your awareness should be concentrated on, what the contra-indications are as well as the benefits.  It is rare to find a comprehensive book with information this extensive to include contra-indications for each asana.<br /><br />Whether you are a teacher or student, Asana Pranayama Mudra Bandha is classic and essential for your library.

Just include it in your budget to buy a better glass cutter. Other than that, it's easily adjustable and pretty easy to use.

Jim Morrison's death in 1971 effectively slammed the door on any major \\"Doors\\" material from then on...(Ray, Robby and John did release a forgettable album in 1972).<br /><br />For years, there was relatively little released about the Doors and their history and performances.<br /><br />The past few years, though,  have seen a mini-surge of releases of recorded material from old Doors concerts. These concerts are mainly material from 1970, over 40 years ago distant now, and perhaps most significantly.......from the era the Doors, their managers, their record label and Jim Morrison, himself probably... ALL knew that Jim Morrison had a SERIOUS/MAJOR Alcohol problem and a self-destructive streak a mile wide.<br /><br />The Doors in their heyday, for example the London Roadhouse concert, were only rarely permanently recorded for posterity, well...at least little has come to light so far. The Roadhouse concert and the Doors \\"Live at the Hollywood Bowl\\" are the two major examples of recordings of the Doors, live and in their prime  (1966-1968).<br /><br />The Doors were scheduled to make their first major US tour in early 1969. The concert at Miami was to kick off the tour. This was the show in which Morrison, blitzed out of his head, was alleged to have exposed himself on stage. (He didn't...but the cops wanted to think so...simply to \\"bust\\" him and make an example out of him.) This show apparently was recorded (Snippets of the show are included in the Doors Documentary \\"People Are Strange\\", with Johnny Depp narrating.) Five songs were completed on stage. But the performance, and expecially Morrison, were a mess. That recording is probably on the shelf permantly. After that show ...the entire concert tour had every promotor cancel the show. Thus, ...no 1969 tour.<br /><br />The Doors were on the shelf, live performance wise, for most of 1969, out of fear by promoters probably that Morrison would screw up on stage. They really didn't get much of a chance at live performances, until a PBS station in New York gave them a chance in two shows, months later,  in late 1969. The Doors did well, Jim kept it together, and it looked like things were on the upswing.<br /><br />By the next year, 1970, a few more promoters were willing to give the Doors a chance. Some gigs were scheduled.<br /><br />And these are the gigs that have been released as of late as \\"live Performances by the Doors.\\"<br /><br />Unfortunately, these performances mostly range from decent gigs, perhaps a triffle unispired, ...to sloppy messes, with a drunk Morrison \\"carrying on\\". The band is usually quite tight...but it's Morrison who is \\"the elephant in the room\\" that no one wants to admit seeing. As Jim's problems consume him ...the band watches as his performances become \\"generic and uninspired\\", occasionally diminishing to \\"sloppy and drunken\\".<br /><br />Thi performance here is solid, if not formulaic at first. As the show progresses, even the band notices that Morrison is wearing down. Ray Manzarek, (who previously starred as a somewhat underinspiring crooner in his brother's surf band \\"Rick and the Ravens\\"...I think he called himself \\"Screamin' Ray Daniels\\"), really gets down and starts blasting out the vocals on the next-to-last song of the gig \\"Close to You.\\" Check it out...and you'll see why Ray wisely left the singing chores to Jim. I have to believe that Ray was carrying Jim through that song. The gig finishes up with \\"Light My Fire\\" and a transformation ...with a tired Jim at first ...to a slurring, lit-up, boozed-out Jim at the end of the song.<br /><br />Ray, in his excellet autobiography, \\"Light My Fire; My Life with the Doors\\"..describes how Morrison, when the band went into one of their long solos, developed an increasing tendency to have a few drinks backstage while the band carried on. In this concert, ....when the Doors played \\"Light My Fire\\", ....when Jim came back into the song after the long solos by Jim and Robby...it was a different, more tipsy Morrison who returned(\\"Jimbo\\", the name Manzark gave Jim when he assumed his liquored-up alter-ego). \\"Light my Fire\\" in this concert, shows this transformation from mainly sober - to mainly \\"boozed\\" most pointedly..<br /><br />The Doors have kept this material on the shelf for years. I know their concert finale in New Orleans, allegedly, was pretty much a mess...with Jim losing it at the end on stage. I'm pretty sure we'll never hear this gig. While listening to this performance in Pittsburg in May of 1970, ..... which to me is uninspired and flat,..... and others which are downright bad,..... I wonder why these recordings were even released ...other than to make money.<br /><br />Ray says that the Doors wanted to record their gigs for posterity, but by the time they started this initiative, 1969, Morrison was on the decline. They had planned to start recording gigs that year, but after Miami, the gigs were all canceled.  By the time they actually were able to do it, 1970, Jim had lost the ability to be consistent and steady. The downhill spiral, which ended up with his death in early July 1971, was underway.<br /><br />Some of the Doors concerts from this period have Jim gone pretty much from the beginning. In this show, he's there at the beginning and holds on to it until the end. Is it a good show?...no...but it's okay. It's worth hearing because we'll get nothing else ever again.<br /><br />One question to ask is ... \\"Why release these gigs now\\"? Better yet...\\"Why bother to release them at all\\"? The really crummy gigs, Miami, New Orleans, etc...will probably never see the light of day. Unispired-uneven-bad gigs are coming out. The band and their engineer Bruce Botnik knew that these gigs weren't good or genuinely marketable right after they occured. Otherwise these recordings would have been released 40 years ago.<br /><br />Maybe they wanted to release the best of what they had in order to give Doors fans more Jim Morrison/Doors material?...even if it wasn't that good. That's cool...I would and will buy it just to hear \\"new\\" (to my ears) Jim/Doors material.<br /><br />Maybe they wanted us to ignore \\"the elephant in the room\\" and buy new Doors stuff?...no matter what the quality.  Hmmm ....now that's a low blow. But, if you love the Doors, like I do, you'll probably buy it just to have it, like I did.<br /><br />In short...if you're a true Doors fan ....you'll probably want to buy this,<br /><br />It's later on that you may ask yourself why you did..rt, ....when the Doors played \\"Light My Fire\\", ....when Jim came back into the song after the long solos by Jim and Robby...it was a different, more tipsy Morrison who returned(\\"Jimbo\\", the name Manzark gave Jim when he assumed his liquored-up alter-ego). \\"Light my Fire\\" in this concert, shows this transformation from mainly sober - to mainly \\"boozed\\" most pointedly..<br /><br />The Doors have kept this material on the shelf for years.

B000YIGNKE|5.0|this is my all time favorite movie. I cant say what exactly captured me but do know that the characters were very well executed and the actors that landed the parts were the best choices.
1250006341|5.0|This book is an absolute must-have for fans of the show and anyone interested in early twentieth century society.  The author seamlessly ties the characters and storylines of Downton Abbey with historical facts to illustrate every aspect of life during this time period in Great Britain.  Beautifully photographed, with fun behind-the-scenes/production details and pictures.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is an awesome app with the best Bible search engine I've seen yet! Great for reading, searching, and ministry!
B004Q7E0TA|5.0|This book gotta help so many people, inculding me!!  I know you more, Portia, and I love you!  You are such sweet and kind person!!
B0029QRA1U|5.0|For years I've watched the ION USB turntable but could not afford it at $250.  Finally the Profile Pro [[ASIN:B0029QRA1U ION Profile LP Vinyl-to-MP3 Turntable]] fit my budget at just $49.95.  I figured it was so well priced that if I couldn't get it to work I wouldn't be out too much.  Well, was I pessimistic for nothing!  This USB turntable provides exceptional quality.  Connecting  Hardware connection is a snap.  Attach the USB cable from the back of the turntable to an open USB port.  The EZ software that comes with it I didn't use.  Instead I use the free program Audiacity, which I downloaded from the Audacity web site.  Audacity includes a users manual.  If you plan to record to MP3 you also have to download a small MP3 converter called LAME.  Learning Audacity took me a few hours.  Use it to adjust the incoming volume (the ION puts out a whopping big sound).  Use it to view the spectrum of the recorded sound. The ION computer cannot play the music while recordingto avoid feedback.  You have to unplug the turntable to hear how the edits sound, then plug it in for the next record.  Recording LPs with ION and Audacity  Record.  The turntable starts automatically when the tone arm is over the edge of the LP.  It stops when the tone arm rises and moves back to stowage position.  Flip the record and Audacity automatically fits the second side to the first.  Editing with Audacity  The best editing tools in Audacity:  Click removal has been perfect with default settings; Remove Noise is an essential second step especially when recording from very old vinyl; Normalize will set the output volume to the ideal level.  There are about 25 editing options.  For LP recording there are two VERY handy capabilities: set track label at selection lets you put the name of the track at the start of each selection on the LP.  Do this after all editing is done, especially deleting sections of dead space.  Use it with Explort Multiple and Audacity will record each track as an MP3 filewith a track number added and album information entered through the metadata dialog box.  If you have 78s, order the optional 78 stylus since 78s have different groove depth and width.  Amazing!  The ION folks made each stylus in a different colored housing for easy identification.  I've even brought my parents and in-laws 78s from the 1930's back to life and they sound excellent!  ION Profile Pro and Audacity software -- a great combination to bring your records back to life!  I love it.  Converting old records -- 33, 45 and 78 -- is my new hobby.  Now I'm listening to music I haven't heard in 50 years.  I can't recommend this combination enough, but the key is the ION Profile Pro.
B0068FYZ9S|2.0|Watch out for this version of the Blu Ray + DVD.  This is a Flipper Disc meaning one side of the disc is the Blu Ray and on side of the disc is DVD.  You shouldn't have a problem if this kind of thing doesn't bother you.  I just wish they'd say it on the package so those of us that are bothered by it would know.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|This app is a decent missle command clone.  nothing special,  but easy to use and I thought rather intuitive controls.
B004I744AS|5.0|This is so much better than the Webster dictionary. Easy to use and has other great features.  This is the 'go to' dictionary.
0375842209|3.0|I read this for a book club and I liked it but didn't find it fascinating or life-changing like a few people had suggested I might. The writing style was interesting, but I tended to zone out when it got too flowery or descriptive. I felt like a lot of key moments in the story weren't all that realistic, but contrived for maximum poetic or emotional impact. However, I do have to give credit to Zusak for writing a book about World War II that doesn't either jump straight for all of most sensational and horrific aspects of the war or drown the reader with historical facts.  Bottom line: If you love poetry and beautiful imagery, you'll probably love this book. If you usually prefer medium to fast-paced action, suspense, or compelling moral dilemmas, you'll probably find it a bit less than absorbing. The substance to word ratio is pretty low.
B006DJ2JSI|1.0|Difficult to use. The other free dictionary is better. Sorry, can't remember it's name. It has glasses if that helps. Wish I could remove this app.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|awesome app. don't get update when u complete the game.over all good game.I recommend this game 4 any young kid.
B006JCC1GO|2.0|only one octive?  siriously that's kind of sad. I wont be one to complain on and on about this stuff because I already have a touch piano. I regimens &quot; little piano&quot; it works just like a keyboard because you can change the sounds! example:trumpet,choir,percussion exc.
B004OBQDHK|4.0|i have nothing really to review about this purchase. it was a gift and a dvd. it arrived quickly and not broken. thanks!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|really cool app!no adds and I love to play angry birds!if u like this one,you should get the seasons. its more challenging but fun! :)
B005HQ5S3G|5.0|This record rocks. The best songs are You Don't Know a Thing About Me and You Can't Win. Wow! Wow! Wow! Go RP
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its fin and I love to play it I would abviouslu rate it a 4 because the thing I don't like is you have to by the games but its fun.
B004SBULWE|5.0|perfect for making my tab faster and keeps away stuff i dont want running i hope everyone enjoys it great app
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is ok and is a good time killer but if u want some real fun this game is not for you.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|I don't know anyone who doesn't love this show.  Buy this now!!!  Also, for those who need to catch up, the complete series up to where the third season ended is on Hulu Plus.
B006C1DH92|3.0|The game forcecloses on my Samsung Infuse 4G. Please fix. I have only been able to play very few times.
B0007MWZEK|5.0|This Swivel Sweeper was a replacement for one I had worn out over the past two years. It really is a great product and so easy to use.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Reasons why splashtop is my favorite app......hmmmm....where do i begin???splash top is amazing because it allllows rlthe User from anywhere there is wi-fi to access his or her home computer. I love using it on vacationing trips to far away places where i can keep a Dvd in the computers disk drive and watch that or go on Abc.com and watch modernfamily from my tablet. Great product!!!
B005WMQ5R8|5.0|I never write reviews but i loved this movie. The animation was excellent and the story was superb. Thanks for finally releasing this in the US
1849514003|5.0|I am amazed with the amount of knowledge, tricks and techniques you can learn for just $42! I've spend a lot of time and money, investigating and learning new techniques and I would say this little investment was worth every penny!! The book is perfectly organized, you can just jump on to the right chapter and find what you are looking for. Learning different ways of doing a single task gives a better understanding of how things work behind the scene. Which I find very useful to overcome the learning curve when stepping into a new type of development model. More over, the author is really fast, friendly and supportive with providing you feedback and those additional chapters/source code.  A must buy for any cocos2d developer who is looking for learning more techniques or polishing existing ones.  Cheers
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Great games, easy to play, fast download. points are hard to get big if you play the games over. again you can rack up points.
B0063IH60K|4.0|A great diversion, only problem is that  the Vegas scoring isn't cumulative.  Otherwise,  it's easy to follow the setup and options.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|this a great app. there are several version of the bible to choose from. however most of them require you to be connected to the Internet in order to read them, which narrows down the places you can use the app.
B005FMZWD8|4.0|Good looking semi expensive looking watch. Casual yet classy at the same time. Kind of nautical looking, would be good for a gift. Has all kinds of neat little features on it and some kind of lunar thing with the moon. Some reviewers complained about the smell, I didn't find the smell to be offensive, it came in a nice looking yellow leather case and smelled it smelled pretty clean to me. If you're looking for a good gift or just a nice watch in general I'd buy it. 4.5 stars.
1593157134|5.0|The Compound Effect is one of the best reads EVER!  Easy to read, and almost as if the words come to life, giving the reader the feeling that there really is someone out there who is there to make a difference and help you to make a difference!  The principles in the book are profound, exciting, empowering, and even better, if you set your mind to it and actually begin to make small changes, it is LIFE CHANGING!  The Compound Effect is in effect regardless of behaviors, its either positive, or negative!  We have a choice!  Seemingly small and unnoticeable changes can change the course of our lives forever!  This is more than a great book, it is AMAZING!  Darren Hardy is personable, compassionate, and challenging in his writing style, compelling this reader to go a few extra steps!  I have just finished reading this book quickly, and am immediately returning to it to implement the changes that I have identified needing improvement!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The Bible may, in fact, be the best fictional story ever written. Wow! If you are a fan of the drama genre, you.will.love.this!  Brilliant.
B005FITIGO|5.0|Margin Call is a great and entertaining movie if you are into stock market investments.  The tension builds as the principals are forced to consider abandoning their professional ethics in order to save their company.  I believe it portrays a gripping and realistic picture of the financial industry in New York City.  I thought the whole thing was very well done.  It is one of my favorite movies.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I am completely satisfied with the app so far. It has been accurate and current. Very helpful and informative. Pleased
B004T4LUPW|5.0|It works well on my iPhone. I use it everyday. It syncs with my Google calendars (all of them), but I guess that's the point. The formatting does not work well on my android tablet.
B00003CXC7|5.0|This is hands down one of my favorite movies. I never regret watching it. DVD was great, movie looked terrific!
B004SD5GZ4|3.0|As a pdf reader, this does the job well enough, but when you want to remove a document from your Kindle that you downloaded to it from your computer, there is no way that I have found to do it. (If someone knows and shares that info, I will edit this to reflect that) The other methods for removing documents do not have any effect on those stored in this app.  The good thing about it for Kindle Fire users is that you can make the print bigger or smaller with a touch--much improving the reading experience over the Kindle 2, which is our other one.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love having my reading plan and multiple translations ready any time any where. The reminding feature means I never have to worry about getting too busy and diverting the most important tine in my day and there is no pressure if you miss a day, you can catch up quickly and easily or just keep going from there. I never have to worry if I brought the same translation the pastor uses  to church or if I have a place to take sermon bites either. This is the best Bible tool I have ever seen and would have paid good money for it, but thankfully it was free :)
B0054JZC6E|3.0|great when you just have a sec and want to mess around nothing too special okay games.  gimme the points
B00006DEFA|5.0|For those who love well-made films, \\"Amadeus\\" is a must-own in the top of its class. Unlike the single DVD, the director's edition allows for scenes that add background flavor and are compelling. The one exception may be the scene with Salieri and his tutor post-opera performance when she speaks of Mozart's fiancee as being \\"astonishing in bed\\"; this is not the kind of dialogue one expects from this era. Beyond that, no improvement can be made.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I like this app, it is useful andgives accurate weather forecasts. it also gives an hour by hour description for the day. infuses a satellite map.
6036025238|1.0|Yes, I was looking for cheap and used DVD. Today, with $400 price for the new and update movie - is not possible to get it for a child. But it doesn't mean, that the DVD suppose to be broken on its way and has incorrect description or even doesn't has any of them.  The packing of this DVD was very very bad, the box was completely broken with small and big pieces all over the envelope.  This DVD is ONLY ON TWO LANGUAGES - ITALIAN AND ALBANIAN. NO ENGLISH. Yes, it runs in american region, and there is description of choice for the English language, but when you click it - it runs different language. And annotation to this DVD, on this page, from this seller doesn't mention it.  So, I spent my TIME AND MY MONEY FOR NOTHING!  AND THE SELLER SPENT NO TIME BUT EARN SOME MONEY FOR FREE!  AT LEAST, THE SELLER WILL GET ONE STAR AND BAD REVIEW.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|please get this app trust me you will not regret it.I know from my own experience it's a fabulous game.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I too am a student of the assassination. I live right in the middle of the DFW metroplex. All the sites are vivid to me. I really think Oswald was a patsy. But, there is no knowing for sure. Mr. King does a simply brilliant job with his tale; assuming a point of view that many could take regarding the complicity of Oswald. It was just a delicious ride. Proving, as he has many times before that Stephen King is the twentieth/twentyfirst century everyman.  Well researched and clever as all get out. Bravo!!!
B004SBQGHS|3.0|Fun but, it claims to be adds free? Being a paid App, I was naive expecting to be true. It has so much annoying adds, I do not play it.
B0064NTZQ2|5.0|I went into Drive not knowing what to expect, but I'll admit - based on the plot summary and the poster, I was expecting an action movie.  However, this was not the case, and I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />It's a slower, methodical movie with fantastic bursts of exploitative violence.  The acting is terrific, the direction is fantastic, and the sound (I watched it in a theater with awesome quality) is amazing.<br /><br />Check your expectations at the door - this is not Fast Five - and enjoy the ride.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|I got this watch for half what they are asking for it now, but would have still ordered it at the current price.<br /><br />It looks much better in person, than on the picture. I've changed the strap to a nice waterproof brown leather strap, but the strap that was on it is nice looking. I live in a very wet enviroment, so a canvas strap just wasn't a good idea for me.<br /><br />The face of the watch looks very modern, and masculine. It has kept good time so far.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is really fun and it is not all that easy at times so its not like your bored out of your mind. this game is awesome
B006ZBRMOU|3.0|Oh Fifty! What happened to you? You are a changed, changed man and I don't I like it one bit! What happened to the domineering, authoritative, bossy, I don't-take-no-for-an-answer man we all fell in love with?<br /><br />The book starts out with Ana and Christian on their honeymoon. They spend three weeks jetting across Europe and wrapped in each others arms every chance they get. It's so beautiful too, the love they have for each other. Christian is determined to give Ana the rainbows and butterflies she wants....and she gets it the entire book. Christian loves Ana probably more than life itself, yet she doubts it all the time. It's so romantic how much he loves her, truly. Only if all the woman in the world could be loved the way Fifty loves Ana. *swoon*<br /><br />There isn't much that has changed since the last book. We left off with someone after Christian and Ana, so there is a slight suspense to this read. The time will come when we find out who it is and the reasoning behind it....We still have Fifty keeping secrets from Ana, ALL THE TIME! What kind of marriage is that? I understand he wants to protect her and give her the world, but it gets to be a bit of a nuisance when he's withholding from her constantly. Ana is still struggling with her insecurity. I will say she does better with it in the end. She manages to defy order after order Christian gives her, but I liked that she did. It made it fun and exciting. Ana becomes somewhat stubborn. She wants what she wants and that's it. While the romance is still hot and steamy...I wanted more. It just wasn't enough for me. I can say there are a few hot and erotic parts of this book that will forever be seared into my brain.....I am definitely ok with that! The problem I have is that I find it hard to believe, Christian, who needs to be so in control, can be ok without playing now. It was all he knew! Some who read this will say there is playing, but I would have to disagree with that. Having Ana's hands tied up for literally a minute or two and a slap here and there can't possibly satisfy Christian's needs. But maybe that's why this book is called, Fifty Shades Freed. Because he is freed from his past sexual needs? You'll have to read it to find out....<br /><br />Ana grows a spine and stands up to Christian. About time woman! It was definitely called for too, especially for what he does. I LOVED that part! Christian finally reveals to Ana what happened with Mrs. Robinson when they first met. In the end, surprises and secrets await and they will leave the fans wanting more. Oh, and Ana calls red....<br /><br />I was a little afraid to post a review for this book. There are some diehard Fifty fans out there, me being one of them. Please do not get discouraged with this review and rating. We all have different views. While I think it's only a three star read, you may think it's a five star read. Unfortunately, I felt that this book didn't reach it's peak like the others. Just when I got excited about something new and suspenseful happening, it was taken care of right then and there, over with. There were some parts felt very rushed to me. My only guess is that the author wasn't ready for all the hype that surrounded the first two books. So in an effort to give readers another story they were asking for, she put this book together in a haste, trying to make it better and over the top....and it just wasn't. Again, my opinion.<br /><br />I believe readers will be very happy with this ending. I know I am. I wanted to give the book more than three stars because of the ending, but I didn't. I can't rate a book based on one certain part. My rating is based on the whole book itself and that's why for the three stars. I think the last 25% of the book was the absolute best for me....and probably most readers. You will be ecstatic when you read it!<br /><br />I will always have a special place in my heart for The Fifty Shades Trilogy. I do love them very much. The second book will always be my favorite and I'm sure I will be rereading them for many years to come. Who knows, I may like the third book even more the second time I read it.any years to come. Who knows, I may like the third book even more the second time I read it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|play every day get them hos fo show. it will get you so. hard you will not even know what to do with your hardness
B005K17RU0|1.0|Loved this app until what looked like porn adds popped up in the background.  I would have rather paid for an add free version.  If anyone can download it for free, then the adds should be appropriate.
B006GG1KOC|1.0|for .99 this game is a rip off it is good for young children. it can be challenging at times but fun

1451648537|4.0|As someone who sits in front of a MAC OSX each and everyday, I truly appreciate the contribution that Steve Jobs has made in my life and to the world at large. But I'm not exactly a techie, never owning or using an I-Pad, I-Phone or even the ever ubiquitous I-Pod. That said, I enjoyed reading this book for all the corporate espionage between the various corporations at play: Microsoft, Pixar, Disney, NeXT (how long did Jobs deliberate over that name?) and of course, Apple. And never before was I so struck by the unusual charisma of Steve Jobs. In fact in his youth, he was a good looking man with nice hair and perfectly balanced, angular features. However, charm is usually coupled w/ charisma, and this is where Steve Jobs falls alarmingly short. No two ways about it, he was The Boss from Hell. As a leader, his vision was rarely cloudy, and anyone who interfered w/ his clarity was going to suffer full frontal assault. Volatile doesn't even begin to explain it. It was like Steve had to tear down anything or anyone who didn't measure up to his exceptionally high standards.<br /><br />It's true that perfectionism is a destructive and anti-productive trait, and in this detailed biography you'll find a variety of examples. How about never furnishing your home because you've never found the appropriate furniture to fill it? That's in here. Discussion has been made regarding Asperger's Syndrome. Did Steve have it? Over and over again, the reader learns of situations exhibiting a total lack of empathy from Steve Jobs. It's a feature of Narcissistic Personality Disorder too. Considering this, it's downright surprising that Steve Jobs actually married and had children. Before marrying his wife, Laurene, Steve had a child out of wedlock whom he at first denied paternity and later ignored a good part of her life (partially even after he became a very rich man). Yeah, Steve was adopted, but he had a good childhood and loved his parents dearly. So, it's never clear where all the anger and hostility came from. Was this a feature of a psychological disorder? Anger and autism often go hand in hand, so you have to wonder.<br /><br />Perhaps, this relates to the biggest question facing any reader of this biography. How could someone as brilliant as Steve Jobs so tragically mishandle his life threatening illness? When Jobs was first diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, his doctors were optimistic because the form he had was slow-growing. Usually, pancreatic cancer is virulent, taking down its victims quickly. Inexplicably, Steve Jobs decided to forego surgery for a full six months after that diagnosis. By way of explanation, Steve Jobs' wife reveals Steve did not want his body to be intruded. Huh? Instead, Steve Jobs played around with diets and intestinal cleansing and all sorts of new age regimens. By the time he did opt for surgery, his cancer had spread throughout his body.  In the end, the reader is left wondering \\"Could Steve Jobs have saved his own life?\\"<br /><br />All in all, this was an interesting read, but nothing in this book resonated w/ any kind of depth. It reads rather shallow, but I'll refrain from blaming the author.stility came from. Was this a feature of a psychological disorder? Anger and autism often go hand in hand, so you have to wonder.

B003P2WO5E|4.0|Working on the Eye of the World series clearly improved Brandon Sanderson's style and technique.  His books have always been a little different, but this one is very well written.  The chapter headings are a little strange, and I'm not sure I get the point, but the story itself is awesome.  I particularly like the way he takes you through several character's seemingly independent and completely unconnected life journey's all of which are well written and intriguing, eventually bringing them together in the most coincidental of ways.  Like many of the Jordan books you have to read for a while to get hooked, but once you are, you can't get enough.  Very well done, I will looking forward to the second book.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this book will change your entire life. read it and you will be amazed. i recommend it to everyone. just read it
B004V5QWU2|5.0|I use this app almost every night! It has a great selection of sounds to choose from for every taste - from plain white noise,  to urban, to my favorites, rain and thunder. Very easy to use, too!  Highly recommend it!
B004ECDNJU|3.0|This is one of the best puzzle games iv gotten for my kindle fire thus far. It doesn't crash or lag like the majong games, and its challanging. That being said, making this a paid app for so few levels is rediculous. Add more levels and I will be more than happy to give you 5 stars.  Also, the challenge mode is pretty boring. Adding a randomize option would make it a lot more intertaining.
B006GG1KOC|5.0|Great game.  Challenging for 5 year old.  Starts out easy, but gets more challenging.  Wish it had more levels though.
B002VPE1XY|5.0|I bought this based on the price compared to other camera cases, and wasn't expecting much; but I gotta say... this thing is worth twice what I payed for it. I bought it to carry my nikon s3100 in, and the camera fits incredibly well in this case. The case stays shut... I'm assuming by a magnet, perfectly securing my camera in the case. No complaints whatsoever. The lid of the case even has a hole to pull the wrist strap of my camera through to make it easier to carry.
0439023513|5.0|I have to admit Mockingjay didn't turn out the way I was expecting.  But it was excellent.  It's a book that will leave me thinking and stewing for quite a while.  It's not a romance or a war story; I think it's really about humanity - greed, morals, perseverence, love (not romance), and sacrifice.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Love it! The best and easy way to spend some time and switch off from dayly stress. Strongly recommend this game.
B0047CTO9A|5.0|Most of the hate towards \\"Pink Friday\\" is related to the fact that it's not rap. Well...apart from a few verses here and there, it really isn't. However, I can't understand how people can dislike it. I mean, I can't even think of a track which I skip, and no track sounds out of place.  Standout tracks for me are \\"I'm the Best\\", \\"Did it On'em\\", \\"Right Thru Me\\", \\"Blazin'\\" and \\"Super Bass\\", and http://www.amazon.com/review/create-review?ie=UTF8&asin=B0047CTO9A&store=music\\"Roman's Revenge\\" is definitely the winner here. I definitely suggest this to anyone who appreciates any genre of music. If you're buying it expecting a rap album, you won't like it, even though I did the same and still managed to appreciate it for what it is. I'm really looking forward to her sophomore album in fact
B005MAHVBO|5.0|This set is great! You get 3CDs of the Manchester show and 2 DVDs of the Tilburg show for one great price!  Transatlantic is one of my favorite prog groups. I've seen them live and I have all their releases.  The Manchester show is one of their best and it's great to have it on CD. The Tilburg show on DVD is great to have because it's another Transatlantic show to enjoy, but it is not HD quality, just a great regular DVD show.  I enjoy each of the Transatlantic DVDs that I have but I really can't wait for them to make the jump to blu ray. Hopefully the video from the next tour will take that plunge!  Until then, take advantage of this bargain set and enjoy some awesome prog by one of the best bands out there today.
B005S2P9PG|3.0|Having been fans of Andy Rooney for many years, we thought this would be a fine thing to own.  It sounded like excerpts from some of his essays.  Great disappointment to find only the last program he did--which we of course had seen.
0525478817|5.0|Yes, this book is about teenagers, but it's really about life and love. I enjoyed this book so much that I came home from lunch to finish it. I think that the message applies to all ages. Highly recommend this emotional and cleaver book.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|simple but fun. If you have a couple of minutes to waste i would recommend it! Not very complicated. a bit annoying that you have to earn points
030788743X|4.0|In his debut novel, Ernest Cline gives us a love story in sci-fi wrapping paper.  Yes, there is some boy-meets-girl-boy-loses-girl-yadda-yadda-yadda romance in these pages, but the real love story is between every 40-year-old reader and his nostalgia for the early 80s.  \\"Ready Player One\\" calls us back to the days of coin-op arcades, Dungeons & Dragons and Rush (and if you think I mean Limbaugh, this book ain't for you).  Set in a dystopian near future, America's obsession with virtual reality (a massive multiplayer world dubbed \\"OASIS\\") has led the populace to all but abandon our neglected true realities.  When the Jobs-esque creator of OASIS passes away, he leaves behind an online scavenger hunt whose ultimate prize is ultimate God-like power over the entire simulation.  Throngs of individuals, clans and greedy corporations all covet the promise of this power, and so they undertake a series of riddles steeped in pop culture from the inventor's adolescence.  The plot follows the attempts of a misfit teen named Wade who plays the role of ultimate underdog, pitting himself against a universe of competitors.  Along the way, he's tested on sitcoms, video games, RPGs, prog rock and many more cultural trappings of that era.  The more you read, the more the main story seems secondary to all of the pop culture homage.  Suffice it to say it's very in tune with the \\"Scott Pilgrim vs. the World\\" template.  Cline's experience as a screenwriter is evident, as this story moves along at a pace that cries out to be put on to the big screen.  Overall, it was an enjoyable ride to the conclusion of the scavenger hunt.  As a reader that's squarely in the sites of the book, I also got a kick out of the myriad loving references, from the very mainstream to the very obscure.  Highly recommended for fans of light-hearted sci-fi, underdog stories, or the 80s in general.
0312117337|5.0|I must admit, it took me years after I bought the deck to dive into this Tarot. I had a judgment about Osho, and things I heard about his commune in Oregon years ago. Then, I had a change of heart, and became an avid fan of all things Osho. When you have an enlightened message cross your path, it only makes sense to wake up and pay attention. This deck contains the Osho message and that message translated through Ma Padma Deva with Osho's blessing. The readings are powerful, straight to the heart of any matter on the energetic level, which clears out the root of all life taking energies and influences, replacing them with a Reality that can be depended on in any circumstance. Thank you Ma Padma Deva, and Osho.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this is the best bible app i have ever had i love it! it is fast and easy to find exactly what you are looking for
B001JP5JRY|3.0|It's an interesting quick read.  I pretty much knocked it out in an hour or two.  Don't expect anything too engaging but it has it's moments.
B000FP2OPY|4.0|My husband and I really like this series.  Another one for us to enjoy together.  Recommended for Buffy and Angel fans.
1433502445|5.0|Surely this bible represents a 21st century culmination of archeological & translation scholarship and publishing excellence. It is now unquestionably my most treasured earthly possession...  > Comprehensive content and commentary  > Cloth bound (Smythe Sewn)  > Colour maps, charts, illustrations...  even Competitively priced and guaranteed!  But what a crying shame, that reformed religious dogma, denies us a red letter edition option. Yes, I'm ready and willing to purchase, when they change their mind. (my first ESV print and computer editions were BOTH red-letter. Why should we deny the obvious distinction between the Living and the Logos Word?)
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Good time passer. Some fun games. Younger brothers live this app.Reccomended if u just want something to pass the time. but ive seen better.
0307592731|4.0|When I first looked at this book I thought it was another one of those touchy-feely efforts that usually are not of much interest to me. However, after reading it I must confess I was wrong.<br /><br />The story itself is not really all that unusual. The writer, at age twenty-six, suffered the death of her mother, her family moving apart and scattered, and her personal life and marriage in an out of control, downward spiral. While the death of her mother and the loss of family was  not of her doing the status of her personal life certainly was. And it was a mess. How a person at her young age could make so many bad choices and still function to the point of walking eleven hundred miles solo is almost unbelievable.<br /><br />What makes this book so interesting and unusual is the honest, forthright manner in which she tells her story. It's all here, laid out for the reader to read and almost see. The drugs, alcohol,abortion, promiscuity and general wasting of a young life. According to the authors claims of her early life she was the poster child for a bad girl and her detailed accounting of her early life supports the charge. What caused her to decide on a whim to walk the Pacific Crest Trail from the Mojave Desert in California to Washington state solo is typical of her former life...she basically decided to do it because she thought it might be fun. It turns out it was perhaps one of the best decisions of her life. Her descriptions of her life both prior to and after the hike are breath taking in their honesty. I have never read a book where the author, in a reader friendly, matter-of-fact manner lays bare her soul for all to see as does this author. I was disgusted, mad, sorry, upbeat, and discouraged during the reading of the book but ultimately left with a sense of hope upon finishing it.<br /><br />The publisher states this is a story of a life time and I tend to agree. Not only is the story an honest memoir but the writer knows how to tell it. Highly recommended.
B000EOUSJU|4.0|Great disc, shipped quick and secure.  Wife got this for me for Christmas along with seven others.  This is fast becoming a fave of mine on my new CD Changer...used digital optical connections and it (the disc) sounds awesome.  If your a Bowie or Mott fan this album is a must for your collection.
B004LOMB2Q|3.0|I probably don't know how to use it well and may come back to upgrade my rating.  Its main benefit 4 me is ubiquitous instant accessy to my note from.my iphone, kindle fire and pcs
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I love this game! lots of fun and games I I I I I I I I I I I game
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love how I can easily navigate between books and verses. I've tried other Bible apps and this one has Provence to be the most User friendly.
