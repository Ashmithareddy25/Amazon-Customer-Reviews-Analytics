B00005JL3A|5.0|This movie was pumped with non stop action. If you have played the video game or if you have played the video game at night, IN THE DARK, and whenever the game gets to a scary part and you jump out of your seat, that is the movie. The action sequecnes are incredible. This is a MUST BUY!
0060934719|5.0|I have heard of Neil Gayman through the 'Sandman' comics (seems the wrong word- let's call them 'graphic novels') although I have never read any - but I may do in the near future after reading 'Stardust'.<br />Tristan Thorn, of dubious parentage, enchanted by his love of Victoria makes a rash vow to recover a falling star in order to gain her hand; she in return makes a rash promise to marry him, if he should ever return with the prize from beyond The Wall (unlikely, she thinks).<br />Then follows pure fairy-tale, intricately woven and told in a flowing, familiar style that just keeps you flowing along with it.<br />It has witches, unicorns, magic, dark burrowing beings and light airy things, all wrapped up in unexpected twists and turns - and of course it all turns out happily ever after, as all the best fairy stories do.<br />I would be doing the future reader a disservice by revealing any more of the details; suffice to say that this is one of the most enchanting adult fairy stories that it has been my pleasure to read - on a par with 'The Hounds of the Morrigan'. I look forward to reading more of Mr.Gaiman's work.<br />...I have recently become more strict with my 'star' allocation. It seems logical that ***** should be reserved for those excepional, out-of-the-ordinary pieces of work - this gets those 5 stars.
B00004RD54|4.0|I first heard this version of Sweet Jane on the<BR>radio when I was 20, bought the album when I was 23,<BR>and haven't looked back. Lou Reed is not much of a<BR>singer. But this concert, and this band, made him<BR>work harder than ever. In otherwords, the band<BR>came to play, and they did.<BR>    The sound has been improved a good deal. The 2 <BR>extra songs flesh out what would have been a good<BR>EP without taking away the music's sheer punch. The<BR>last song; Rock n Roll has been trimmed from 10:45<BR>to 9:33, but it still works. All in all, it still <BR>holds up after 28 years...
B00005Y228|5.0|I will admit that i didn't know who she was.  And then CGYOOMH was a hit over here. Someone told me she was the one who did the locomotion back when i was like 10.  I was in a store and bought the DVD of KYLIE live from Sydney.  I wasn't thinking much of it really. Then in about 2 minutes i was blown away.  She is great. I just bought this album and have only listened to it once, but there is not one song that i will skip over.  If you are either a  Britney Spears fan, or any of the other american pop ladies, you will soon forget about them after you let this cd fill your ears.
0375501851|1.0|I got all the way to page 200 of the huge, long book and I still had no idea what this book was about.  I read so many excellent reviews about it, and I am wondering if we were reading the same book.  Is there another book named White teeth out there?
B000063DS1|4.0|26 years after the concert, The Band has managed<BR>to come back hard with this 4 CD box set. Songs<BR>that were edited on the 1978 release; The Last<BR>Waltz, are now intact. The sound has been greatly<BR>improved as well under Robbie Robertson's direction.<BR>    The Band may have had only a handful of great<BR>songs over their career, but they played them like<BR>a glass of fine wine. And with the inclusion of 24<BR>additional tracks, this set is a must for people<BR>who enjoy good music played by a band who knew how.
630382336X|5.0|I was just a child when first introduced to The Beatles; I was a teenager when I went potty over them. Despite the fact that I was born some good seven years after the band's demise, I can't really say I'm embarassed to be a fan at all. This movie, the first I ever saw by them, portrays the exact feel of what Beatlemania must have been back in it's day. If you have a knack for english humor and non stop puns, this is a great movie to watch. Just one look at these four guys and one could not avoid falling for them. John's somewhat agresive sense of humor, George's serious but nevertheless hilarious soft spoken charisma, Ringo's laconic humor, Paul's non-stop vigilante behavior, and not to mention the great performance of Wilfrid Brambell, portraying Paul's grandfather, described by Paul himself as &quot;a king mixer and a troublemaker&quot;, as he tries to cause quarrels between staff, band members and crew, all the while trying to make a profit out of forged autographs of the boys. Beatles at their fullest! The best movie they ever did.
B00005RY7X|5.0|This is simply the best mainstream album to come out in at least five years.  Period.  The man is a genius.  Not that he's covering any new ground, but that he is making these perfect pop songs by himself.  90 tracks of andrew per song.  Not to mention what a breath of fresh air this album is in the stifling climate of creed (or should i say pearl jam) clones.  Absolutely brilliant, every song should be a top ten hit.
0792156684|5.0|the love story may be cheesy, but why did we all go back weekend after weekend to make this the top grossing film all-time? something about it made us go back again and again. we can't deny the fact that this film was actually quite good, even though many brush it off as some ... teen romance on a sinking ship.
B00005OAIE|5.0|Rarely has there been a time when I have felt the urgency to buy an album of a new artist after hearing just one song.  I don't think I have done that since I first heard \\"Airport Song\\" by Guster 6 years ago.  (They happen to be touring with Mayer this summer....an unbelievable band that compliments Mayer's sound).  However, after I heard \\"No Such Thing,\\" I knew I wasn't going to last too long.  I bought Room for Squares two days later.<BR>     Although Mayer's sound is comparable to Sting, Dave Matthews and David Gray, is that such an insult??  In the world of assembly line packaged pop music, it's rare to find anything remotely DIFFERENT.  Mayer is a songwriter, which is hard to find these days.  There is a lot of introspection in his relatively young life in songs like 1983 (one of my personal favorites).  The catchy guitar riff in \\"Neon\\" had me hooked from the very first seconds.  Songs such as \\"Your Body is a Wonderland\\" may have a cliche title, but the lyrics show much more depth than sex and lust.  I can only hope that we hear more from Mayer in the future.
B00005QG9J|4.0|I was disappointed in their last album but this album was quite different. I have to say most of the songs on this album and enjoyable and I've listened to over and over again. With all their good stuff hopefully they'll make a greatest hits album sometime in the future they've got enough hits to do so and this album just adds to those other great songs. I'd buy this one if I were you. You won't regret it.
B0000024ZC|1.0|This stuff is brutal, folks! C'mon, how cheesy can you get?  Gentle Giant?  Prog rock at its most grating!
B00005NWM3|3.0|This Cd isn't the best CD out there but it's certainly not the worst. True tracks off this album and their previous could make one kick [bootie] CD, but most Cds are like that! All and all these guys have got good flavor and it's a so so CD to buy. Wouldn't rush out to get it but I wouldn't say pass it up. You'll end up picking and choosing your favs but hey the favs I've picked are worth it in my opinion. One of my favorites songs by them is \\"Cowboy Hat\\" Try finding that I'm sure you'll enjoy
B00002MZ4V|5.0|I don't have this track, but I know all of the songs on it -- they're all great.<br />From looking at the track list, it seems like Star Wars is over-represented.  John Williams has many many many other great scores aside from the ones in Star Wars.  Personally, I think more of his tracks from the Jurassic Park Trilogy, the Star Wars Trilogy, and Jaws should've been included.
B00004Z459|5.0|I DL their Album before they because huge and I shared it all over campus. They spread like wildfire and I'm very happy for them. With all the same old type of music that was out at the time they opened up some new doors with an album that was almost 100% solid. Some songs can be skipped but I think most people will love the entire CD for what it's worth. Buy this it's a must.
0920668364|3.0|I would recommend this book to parents and children that need some reminders of how important they are to each other.  Some people don't realize how much they love someone or how important they are in their lives until they are gone.  I think that this book can be appropriate for all ages young and old because everyone could get a different meaning from reading this book.  This book reminds me of Yay, You!: Moving Out, Moving Up, Moving On by Sandra Boynton.  It reminds me of this book because of the message of moving on with your life and taking each experience one step at a time.  It also reminds people to celebrate success and remember to support others.
0684833395|4.0|Catch-22 is a comedic story that keeps you on your toes because of the hilarious actions and reactions preformed by those who are trying to escape the imfamous &quot;Catch-22.&quot;  This catch makes it impossible for Yossarian and the other members of his squadron to go home. Everyone wants to be grounded or sent home so they don't have to fly dangerous missions.  You can go home if your crazy, but anyone smart enough to say that they're  crazy so that they can go home, is really sane.  Along with Catch-22 keeping them in the service, a seemingly infinite amount of required missions also keeps the bombardiers in the air.  I would definitely recommend this book to anyone ready for a good laugh!
B000002LND|5.0|One of the best greatest hits CDs ever released is the Immaculate Collection. This album is an incredible collection of 15 unforgettable hits from 1982-1990 plus two new(At the time)songs. I love every second of the 73 and a half minutes of this fantastic collection.<br />The collection showcases the change in Madonnas vocals. The first several song up until Live To Tell had Madonna singing in a very girlie voice. The rest had her singing in a much deeper voice.<br />Songs range from party-like like in Into The Groove, or even Material Girl(Madonna never escaped being labeled this) to dark and deep like in the powerful Live To Tell( My favorite Madonna ballad), to spicy like the steamy Justify My Love to even socially conscious like Papa Don't Preach.<br />The big bonus is the remixing of some of the tracks. The original version of Express Yourself on it's parent album has a more New Jack Swing sound. The version on here is the techno beat version that we hear when we watch the video for it. The same thing goes for Like A Prayer.<br />The cons to this CD and the same thing that most greatest hits CDs suffer from is the shortening of the tracks. Most of the 1983 singles go for about six minutes where on here they fade out at the four minute.<br />However that is made up for by the incredible, powerful Vogue being extended a bit. We will alway remember Vogue for its bizarre video. One of the best dance songs of 1990. It kinda makes me cry a bit because it reminds me so much of my childhood because I can remember dancing and stomping around the house when I listened to it on the radio when it was relatively new(I was only like 7 or 8 at the time) and today it is one of my all-time favorite songs by Madonna to this day. I hope I can still jam and dance to this song when I,m like 84 or something *giggle*. The best song on here is the final track Rescue Me. Rescue Me established Madonna as my all-time favorite female singer of all time with it's heavy bass lines and heavy beats. Rescue Me is Madonna at her best. It made me buy this CD.<br />Despite the cons of this CD it's SO worth it. I highly recommend it to all Madonna fans.eavy beats. Rescue Me is Madonna at her best. It made me buy this CD.<br />Despite the cons of this CD it's SO worth it. I highly recommend it to all Madonna fans.
0920668364|1.0|The book had potential in the begining. It was sweet. But as you get into it you can't help but get a creepy kind of feeling. I guess it didn't help that my mother in law gave this book to my HUSBAND when our son was born. It made it all the more creepier. And made my husband feel really akward. I just pictured her driving over to our home and sneeking in to hold him at night. EEEEWWWWWW <br />Sorry but the point to the story is sweet and nice, but I would choose a different book to express that to my children. Needless to say this book became a favorite for my kids to tear up and not get yelled at for it.<br />There are just so many more books out there that have to same message that don't give you goose bumps half way through the book. One of our favorites are Guess how much I love you? <br />Not a book that I would recommend. It does seem more geared toward adults with the \\"meaning\\" of the book and all. But I just picture mothers who can't let go of their \\"baby\\" loving this book, very unhealthy.
B00005RY7X|5.0|This CD is the greatest party CD i have ever bought! This CD will make you the happiest person alive! I promise you! All of his energy is transferred into this amazing CD! You will feel like you are listening to him live everywhere you go!
B000009CEM|5.0|I receive a monthly periodical.  Its called CMJ.  I cant remember the month, but FF's Resurrection was featured on the disc included.  I remember the disc was particularly good.  But each time I got to the FF song, due to either preconceived notions, or total ignorance, I fast forwarded it after only a few seconds.  The rest of the disc was great, so I kept it in the car.  Mercifully one day, something distracted me, and I let the song continue to play.  I nearly had to pull over to the side of the road, as I could not believe my ears.  The sounds eminating completely struck my core.  I now only played that song from the CMJ disc.  Here I was, a 32 year old doctor, jamming to Fear Factory, and of course, I was to scared to get Obsolete.  Years go by, and now CMJ features Digimortal.  Im a little older, a little bolder, and out of training, so I have a little money.  I pick up Obsolete.  I listen, and I am not prepared for the onslaught.  Only an out of town trip and a lack of any good new music pushed me to pick up Digimortal.  Upon hearing this, I began to see things a little differently.  I could recognize the style, the pattern and most of all, the chaotic organization.  When Digital Connectivity came out, I snatched it up.  I sat in my basement, and for the first time realized that Burton was one person.  The whole time, I thought 2 men sang.  I saw Raymonds incomprable power, speed, and direction.  Christians base was so contributory and Dino..well he just is what FF was all about.  You cant judge anything by what it looks like or what you may think it should be.  Only 2 weeks ago I picked up De, and then Remanufacture.  Demanufacture has not left my car cd since.  When I go work out on the elliptical machine, and I have demanufacture in my cd player, I can work out to no limit.  I am serious, in that i can ride it on any level for any amount of time.  If the battery runs low, I have to stop (I carry extras now).  FF came to town last summer, and I was intimidated.  I did not see them.  It may have been the biggest mistake Ive made in a long time.  I am actually saddened by it.  The break up has left a void.  Buy the DVD, and you will see it more as a family break up than a band break up.  I have never seen a more cohesive unit.  Call them what you want, death metal, nu metal, progressive metal, techno metal...you all know that FF doesnt give 2 cents about how they are labeled...so please stop.  Enjoy this music for its pure power, composition, message, and most of all..its honesty.  ...
B00005Y228|5.0|I first heard Can't get you out of my head. Found the CD, bought it,played the whole disc and All songs but the last 2 are my favorites. I'm trying to find Locomotion by Kylie, early 80's I think. I play it all the time I also listen to it when I'm on my day off.I play certain songs over and over (Fragile, Dancefloor,Love Affair). Cool songs, I'm glad I found this CD. Although my hubby hopes it will wear out.I'll just get another copy.
B000009QPK|4.0|I'd give this about 4.5 stars, really.  I enjoy the studio cuts from Slayer slightly more overall, but it's pretty amazing to hear this stuff performed live.<br />The music is as fast and aggressive as humanly possible but somehow manages to avoid turning into slop.  I credit the incredible Dave Lombardo (drums) for this.  His performance on this album should rate as one of the top ten \\"drum albums\\" of any genre or period.  It's really incredible.  Good show by the rest of the band as well.<br />I wouldn't pick this up before Reign in Blood, South of Heaven or Seasons in the Abyss, but if you have those, it's a good listen for sure.
B0000668IF|1.0|18 is a complete 180º from Play.  Where Play kept you on your toes, 18 will barely keep you on your feet.  Most of the CD is ambient filler with monotone vocals.  Gone are the body rockin' beats and groves that kept Play alive and the listener glued.  Track 9 was the only one that was palatable.  18 is a big disappointment for Moby fans.  Every song on Play was an individual creation.  The only way to tell if your listening to a different track on 18 is when your CD player differentiates it.  I think that Eminm has it right when he said that Moby is done.  If you like your beats consistent and repetitive this is the CD for you.  It is not for me...
0920668364|4.0|I thought this book was great to teach children about loss and the love of a mother to her child and I would recommend it to teachers. It seemed to conjure up deep emotions from many of its readers and listeners due to the sensitive subject of death. The content is good for third grade and up, however, second grade might be able to grasp the concept of loss. I Love You Forever is definitely NOT for kinder and first. I would compare this book to My Friend Rusty. This book is also about the loss of life except it deals with losing a friend rather than a mother. Make sure you have a box of tissue when you read this one!!!
B00005YW4H|5.0|This is an incredible cd from a very talented young woman.  Her sexy, throaty, soft voice merge perfectly with the accompaning instruments to create music that is simply magical!  Part blues, part jazz, a little bit country...no matter how you classify it, close your eyes, listen, and you'll be swept away.  She makes you feel the music.  I would recommend this to anyone...do yourself a favor and get this Cd!  She really is that good.
B00004STPT|5.0|a very good soundtrack. I've after hans zimmer's works all the time. For this one, everytime when I listen to the track no. 3 & 13, I get myself excited. You know, your body just moves with the music automatically.
0446608955|5.0|A Walk to Remember  is a wonderful book.  It is a heart-capturing to read.  Once I started reading it I didn't want to put it down. I found myself holding onto the next page long before I actually had to turn it.  I was so anxious to read further and further.  I also found myself thinking a lot throughout the book and making connections with myself, the characters are very real.  From beginning to end I was totally drawn into reading this story and felt as if I was part of it, that's what makes a good book.  <BR> The reason I loved this book so much is for three simple reasons.  It was surprising, refreshing, and easy to make connections with my own life, and other people's lives.  Landon and Jamie Sullivan are acquaintances at Beaufort High.  Both in different worlds and carrying on separate lives.  Jamie is a religious-oriented young woman with a strict Reverend as a dad. Landon is just another boy in High School.  A school dance somehow brings these two together and they begin to form a friendly relationship.  Landon later ends up in a Christmas Pageant with Jamie, doing a favor for her.  He has no idea of the importance and reason as to why Jamie takes the pageant so seriously.  Many things pop up in the story that the reader would have no clues about beforehand, which makes the book even more enjoyable to read.  I enjoyed not knowing what was always going to happen next.  Landon and Jamie's relationship only grows throughout the book and the things they do for each other is refreshing to read about.  They are a couple that has just fallen head over heals for each other and discovers what love really is.  They are so real because their feelings are so strong for each other and they show that through so many things.  Every relationship has its difficulties however.  Landon and Jamie experience just that!  They experience it to the extreme but are always there for each other.  I found myself relating to many things that both characters feel throughout the story.And if I couldn't relate to it, I know somebody else could.  Sometimes I almost felt as if I were them which made my emotions as a reader come out, and that doesn't happen too often when I read a book.  This book kept me at the edge of my seat the whole time anxiously awaiting a conclusion to a book of love and adventure. I laughed and cried with this story and would encourage everyone to read it.  I would also recommend other books by Nicholas Sparks such as, \\"A Bend in the Road,\\" and \\"The Notebook\\" for similar reasons.
0446310786|5.0|Harper Lee is a master of the human heart. She knows just how to portray the love of Atticus for his children. She expertly weaves the story courage both of Atticus as he defends Tom Robinson, and indeed of Tom Robinson himself and his fears. Tom's fears are very real and you see the prejudice and hatred of our society clearly, with no attempts to mask anything. There are deep themes in this book, themes which we can not just read about but learn and apply to our lives to enrich them. The story of Tom Robinson is sad, very sad, but it can be prevented and this story gives the way to answer it. Also, we learn so much about the love of a father for his children. It is beautiful and should not be missed when reading this story.<br />This book is a classic and just a great, great story!<br />If you don't have it, BUY IT and enjoy it for years to come.
B00001ZULV|4.0|It seems there are two very different groups of people into two very different incarnations of Genesis. In corner number one, weighing in with Peter Gabriel being great and that Genesis &quot;sold out&quot; after his departure. In corner number two, weighing in with the Phil &quot;all over the radio&quot; Collins controlling the group; and in the process seemingly ruining them by making them &quot;too commerical and slick&quot;.<br />This collection is definitely for those who like (and are more familiar with) the latter version of Genesis. My musical tastes are mainstream. I am an admitted Beatles and Stones fan, so I tend to favor the Collins led Genesis. Speaking of the Stones, that is the another example of where people seem to either like their later work (around 1978 to present) or either feel that &quot;the Stones haven't done anything since Exile On Main Street&quot;. So, my tastes are admittedly more comercial. And, what is wrong with that?<br />The collection covers 1973 to 1997. Such radio hits as Invisible Touch, I Can't Dance, Land of Confusion, In Too Deep, etc. share space with a remake of the Carpet Crawlers (1999) and Congo featuring Ray Wilson on vocals. It also captures how the group sounds with Phil leading it. It brings back memories of the Reagan 1980's where I seemed to hear these songs on the radio about every year.<br />Under Collins' tenure this was a great pop/rock group. It simply was the feeling of the times and it seems what direction that Genesis wanted to go in at the time. Commercialy it was great for them (more money). I would argue artistically it also covered much of what people wanted to hear in music from 1976 until 1991. So, there you have it. A great pop collection. Guaranteed to bring back good memories for those who knew Genesis as an MTV radio friendly band.
0064407667|5.0|From the moment I first picked up the book almost 3 years ago, before there was a \\"series\\" in place, before there was the excitement, before they became best-sellers, I was hooked.<br />Delighted by the tone set forth on the back cover, I was instantly caught up in the horrific events that befall the poor Beaudilaire children--and even more intrigued by the author, Mr. Lemony Snicket.  His wonderful way of explaining what words mean, the Dickensian tone of the stories, and the \\"perils of Pauline\\" type plot--along with the hints of what was to come in future stories, has left me a life-long Snicket fan.<br />It took me back to my glory days as a young reader, when I discovered an author I would read for days on end.  Since that first read, A SERIES OF UNFORTUNATE EVENTS has become a series of joyful reads.<br />Wonderful reading for adults as well as children.
B00005QXXO|3.0|Q: How do you translate the other-worldly productions of 'Kid A' and 'Amnesiac' to the concert stage?<br />A: Well, if you're Radiohead (and I think you are), you strip things down and put the pedal to the metal. These amphetemine arrangements will wake you from your \\"Treefingers\\"-induced sleep, allright. Thom Yorke's performance is borderline manic: just think of android Ian Holm in `Alien,' when he malfunctions and begins caroming off the walls, and you'll get the idea. To an extent, I like this approach -- I like the punky edge it brings out, and I'm relieved to see these perfectionists not treating their music preciously. I also like the electronic-collage that swallows the main-set finale \\"Everything In Its Right Place,\\" certainly a better way to end concerts than the big bangs (half Wagner, half Skynyrd) most bands are still resorting to. <br />But it's the ballads that distinguish the album. \\"True Love Waits\\" is shorn of the cheesily gorgeous synth arpeggios that helped make it a bootleg favorite, but it's still a lovely, stirring piece. And \\"Spinning Plates\\" is just a revelation. The surging keyboards are ditched for a lone piano, so the song is at first barely recognizable (great moment when a guy in the crowd lets the cat out of the bag), but it has a durably stark beauty.  That Yorke can pull off acoustic perfs like \\"Plates\\" and \\"True Love Waits\\" tells us something about why this band is so great -- there's always a busker inside that technophile.
B00004Y7SF|5.0|THE GOOD<br />Very good Christmas cd with excellent songs on them.  Especially The Christmas Song,  Merry Christmas Baby, These are the special times(more on that in a minute) and even though I've never been big on holy songs (I know its Christmas but you know) they are very good as well and so are the other songs.  This cd more than her self-titled shows what she is capable of vocally.<br />THE BAD<br />The only bad thing I can think of is that you can only listen to it once a year (unless your Mick Foley).<br />THE UGLY<br />Like her first cd are you people rating her cd or her?  And how do you figure she stole These are the Special Times from Celine Dion?  (No offence meant to her).  First of all Christmas Carols are open territory.  Would you say the hundreds of artist, groups etc who did White Christmas stole it from Bing Crosby?  Of course not, so why is Christina any different?  Also technically speaking the song belongs to Dianne Warren, not Celine Dione.  Songs belong to the SONGWRITER who not the artist performing it and if DW wants her to do the song (and considering how christina did on I Turn to You I don't blame) so be it.  You people are fishing for things to attack Christina with but in this case the She stole that from Celine is silly.
1567184855|5.0|Someone gave me this book about 1 1/2 years after my son died at the age of 33. I was searching for what I actually believed because it was acutely important to know where he might be. I read it twice, then read &quot;Destiny of Souls&quot;. They have the &quot;ring of truth&quot; which quite suprised me. The author's method of presenting the information is what made the unbelievable believable and has given me a whole different way of thinking about life. A lot of what has transpired in our lives makes good sense, and my loss a bit more bearable. No one can claim to know all, and I am very glad the author did not grandstand and make  a farce of a very important part of our lives. I would read any more books that this author might write on this topic.
B00000JCOV|5.0|Ok... SlipKnot is the best freaking album I have ever listend to. I dont care what kind of music you like you have got to at least listen to Wait and Bleed or Eyeless or something. If you like anything heavy and intence and that is insain BUY THIS RECORD NOW
B00005QDW1|4.0|Despite earlier efforts of making albums, we all change and it shows here. Keeping in mind that this is No Doubt's...what...7th album...or somewhere near there, they had alot of time to really get into what they want to do. I find that on \\"Rock Steady\\", the music is much more intricate, explores a hundred different types of music from electronic, to gritty guitar to a sort of caribbean flavor. It's really something you should listen to more than once, it's so unlike the previous albums that it may take a listen or two to really get into it, although I thought it was great the first time. One added bonus, Gwen actually sings nice melodic songs rather than shouts madly about what jerks she thinks her ex boyfriend(s)are. Definitley worth a shot!
0679735259|1.0|I recently was asked to read this &quot;book&quot; for a class, and I nearly died trying.  There are numerous passages in this book that are inexcusable, such as &quot;Peoples of the Republic, tumbling dominoes, maintaining the equilibrium of the Dingdong by the ever encroaching Doodah&quot; (Herr 20).  Later on, Herr graciously begins to use descriptive, specific language and something to grasp onto, but by then it is too late.  _Dispatches_ is suitable as a screenplay, but that's about it.  The fallacy of imitative form is alive and well in the first 100 pages of Herr's embarrasing attempt at writing, but all it does is make you squint and moan through vague, nondescript sentences.  Read Tim O'Brien's &quot;The Things They Carried,&quot; instead.

0792837614|3.0|This overrated classic musical lifts Shakespeare's \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" storyline, and muddles it with a cold romance and gangs that were dated even at the film's world premiere.<br />Riff (Russ Tamblyn) is the leader of the Jets, who are constantly having run-ins with Bernardo's (George Chakiris) Puerto Rican gang, the Sharks. Planes and fish don't mix, and things come to a head when the gangs are at a dance when Bernardo's sister Maria (Natalie Wood) meets the Jets' cofounder and Riff's best friend, Tony (Richard Beymer).<br />Tony is trying to clean up his act, backing away from all the street dancing, but he is immediately smitten with Maria. A jet and a shark cannot be lovers, and since no one in the film has read \\"Romeo and Juliet,\\" no one knows what will happen...P>Eventually, the film does ape Shakespeare, partially. ...<br />The positives are what made the film a classic. The songs are excellent, using Stephen Sondheim's lyrics to carry the emotions of the characters. The dancing and ballet choreography are superb. It may seem silly to have street gangs dance-fighting, but the pure athleticism on the part of the dancers is fantastic. Rarely have dance numbers been so physical, and so grand.<br />On the downside, the main romance takes place waay too quickly. This is quicker than a whirlwind romance, this is a tornado wrapped in a cyclone being blown by a wind machine. The mere speed of the relationship (a day) takes any sympathy for Tony and Maria away from the viewer...P>Leonard Bernstein's music is good in the songs, but not as incidental background noise. He thinks he is scoring a bombastic Broadway song even in quiet moments... The pacing is a little slow, as this marked the beginning of the two and a half hour widescreen musical genre that spawned such bloated cinematic drivel as \\"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\\" and \\"Doctor Doolittle.\\"<br />\\"West Side Story\\" is not a perfect classic, and not a dud. It is squarely in the middle of the spectrum. Ifanything troubles the viewer, it is wondering how this film beat out \\"Judgement at Nuremburg\\" for the Best Picture Oscar.<br />This is unrated, and contains physical violence, mild gun violence, very mild profanity, some drug references, and mild adult situations.
B0000668IF|3.0|For people expecting 'Play' Pt 2, don't even bother. It's definitely not like it's predecessor, in fact it's a departure from the last one. Gone are the sultry undertones of 'Porcelain' but the return of electronic flavor in 'We Are All Made Of Stars'. His collaboration with Sinead O'Connor on 'Harbour' leaves an unwanted slightly formulaic aftertaste to it. Even 'Jam For The Ladies' disappoints. The only song that seemed to warm was 'At Least We Tried'. Minimalism echos in the entire album. Lacks the oomph of 'Play'. The somberness of the disc can sometimes be mistaken more as constipated. The music is as light as the weight of the CD itself.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|This is the best movie I have seen regarding the theme of addiction. Addiction to T.V., speed, cocaine, heroin etc.<br />Were it not for some explicit scenes, I would recommend this opus as mandatory viewing material in high school.<br />The pace and the music are superb. This one will stir your emotions and make you feel anguish as few movies can.<br />Burstyn's performance is outstanding and makes you rethink about the commercial and ubiquitous criteria used by the Academy to grant the awards. This was truly Oscar material.

0446310786|5.0|This is another one of those books a lot of kids have to read in school. The title of the book kind've sets teens off like many books do. But really this book is wonderful! It took me a while to get into it but in the end I did. The book is about growing up and facing that people aren't all the same. Little kids see everyone as equals but when they grow up they see that isn't true.<br />The book's main character is Jean Louise or better known as Scout. The book follows her and her brother Jem's adventures. They may live in a small town but any child can find something to do even in the most boring towns and that's exactly what Scout and Jem do. They bug the heck out of the Radleys, a quiet family in the town. Scout has to face her fears of going to school.<br />The main conflict in the story is the case of Tom Robinson, a negro. He's accused of raping a lower case woman. Scout's dad, who is a defense lawyer, is put on the case as Tom's lawyer. How will the case end? Is Tom guilty? <br />A wonderful book! Must read!
B00005MG2Y|5.0|At first, Linkin Park's &quot;One Step Closer&quot; sounded like just another modern rock group but when &quot;Crawling&quot; was released, I was urged to check out this CD, in which it included some non-album songs and some live performances...Surprisingly, if this is your first time to buy an LP record, (and good news to parents too!) this alternative band never swore in their albums..I admire Mike Shonda the most, because he was able to balance his vocals and the strong, very strong vocal chords of Chester Bennington (check out My December).<br />1) Papercut- DJ Hahn showed off his skills on the turntables on this third single.. One of my favorites.<br />2)One Step Closer- Personally, I didn't really like this song that much but the combination of Chester and Mike's aggressive voices were extremely off the hook!<br />4) Points Of Authority- Another great loud track. This is much better than One Step Closer...Great music by DJ Hahn.<br />5) Crawling- This is certainly the best song ever! This is one of the haunting rock songs I've heard (next to &quot;Iris&quot; of course).. the music was just breathtaking. Chester's harmonious voice on the first stanzas and breaking it in the chorus was awesome.<br />6) Runaway- Another loud track..I'm still listening to it.<br />8) In The End- Obviously, Linkin Park's chart-topping song but I had enough of it...The catchy keyboard tune and the alternate singing of Chester and Mike was well done.<br />12) Pushing Me Away- One of the best tracks..Hope the DJs on the radio will play this track.<br />17) My December- The second best track to Crawling.. Contrast to the band's music, My December's music was not really a rock song...It ultimately concentrated on keyboards and turntables..Slow, catchy track. <br />The other tracks that were obviously good were the other 3 live performances.<br />Overall, this is a great record and you're truly lucky if you haven't bought the first one.
0684833395|5.0|Catch-22 is not a book America wants to read, especially in her present state of patriotism.  One cannot picture Heller's Yossarian sporting a \\"These Colors Don't Run\\" T-shirt and waving a flag.  Indeed, the opening chapter explicitly refutes any interpretation that suggests Yossarian's actions are rooted in a deep sense of nationalism: an uber-patriotic Texan drives almost all the men out of a hospital ward and back into combat.  Catch-22 is a book that challenges the logic of war.  It combines wry humor with startlingly affecting anecdotes to force the reader into asking questions.  It is the portrait of a man who is dangerously sane, but trapped in the insanity of war by catch-22.<BR> When I started reading Joseph Heller's Catch-22, I had no idea what to expect.  I scanned the buzzwords on the back cover...\\"apocalyptic, bitter, hilarious, monumental, original, subversive, classic.\\"  What I found was a moving satire, centered ..., an allegory who manages to retain his humanity.  The fact that Heller's Yossarian was indeed so easy to relate to contributed to the book's power.  The novel brings you deep into the world of war, as viewed by a soldier.  Yossarian's experiences are not entirely realistic, and much of what happens over the course of the novel seems to make no sense at all.  In presenting war in such a manner, Heller asks the reader whether the reality of war makes any more sense than does Yossarian's story.  Heller says that war itself is a great catch-22, a paradoxical trap that humans walk into time and time again.  He questions the logic of the illogical, and asks the reader to try and rationalize the irrational.<BR> Catch-22 is significant because it claims that not only war is a catch-22.  The metaphor extends to include life itself.  We see that the characters are not merely fighting to survive the war...they are fighting to be immortal.  Each has his own way, whether it be by enduring boredom to make time move slower, or by gaining global power through commerce and enterprise.  They are all trying to cheat death.  Heller's novel reveals many deep and often unpleasant truths, but it does it with humor and style.  For this reason, Catch-22 has reached \\"classic\\" status and will probably remain a classic for generations to come.<BR> As a book, Catch-22 is flawless.  It is moving, witty, and ultimately one of the greatest novels I have ever read.  It deserves every one of its five stars.  However, to those who are interested in reading it, I warn you to take Heller's work with a grain of salt.  Many may find the satire offensive in light of the current global situation.  Please do not let current events get in your way.  Catch-22 is a wonderful, eye-opening novel; but as with all \\"subversive\\" literature, it must be approached with an open mind.
B0000026VZ|4.0|For a hip-hop fan like me, it's almost impossible to cross over my taste for music and listen to mainstream...My father loves Toto and he had never stopped talking about their songs...So when I had the time, I borrowed his Toto's Past to Present CD and listened to it,,,Then I found out how good this band was!<br />My fave tracks on the album are:<br />2) Africa- the tinkling of the keyboard's pretty neat<br />3) Hold The Line- David Paich handled his instrument very well<br />5) Georgy Porgy- I've heard this and I think it's a classic..Unfortunately, some artists are remaking it and killing the original flow of the song.<br />6) I'll Be Over You- Great love song but #9's &quot;I Won't Hold You Back&quot; is much better<br />7) Can You Hear What I'm Saying- Great bass by Michael Porcano..Awesome introduction<br />8) Rosanna- I like this even though it's something like Hold The Line<br />9) I Won't Hold You Back<br />11) 99- One of the standouts<br />This is an awesome colelction but I was upset that &quot;Lea&quot; (my favorite!) wasn't included in this album...Still, I recommend this CD to teenagers who are already sick of the bubblegum pop scene or if you have enough of the music scene today, you should try your folks' music- mainstream music...This is what they call REAL music.
B00005RG6M|5.0|This album - originally from 1975 - has been remastered in 96/24Khz 5.1 surround by the original engineers ( Ray Thomas Baker & Brian May ), so obviously they know the music really well.  The disc contains DTS 5.1; DVD Audio MLP advanced resolution 5.1; and standard stereo tracks.  On screen lyrics are available - either seperately, or as the song is playing - useful if one is a karaoke fan...  Also there is a small picture gallery of Queen from the mid 70's.  The booklet also includes the song lyrics and a few photos, too.  The 'piece de resistance' is the inclusion of the \\"Bohemian Rhaspody\\" video in DTS 5.1, which looks pretty good for it's age and sounds wonderful...!!!<br /> The surround makes one feel as if one is sitting in the middle of the actual recording with the central position being taken by Freddie's superlative voice.<br />  I've heard that the members of Queen, their managers, and record company were so impressed by this surround sound mix that all of the Queen albums have been given the go-ahead for surround mixes...  Wonderful news!!!!
0440219078|5.0|One of the most unique books I ever read, The Giver really shows you how important feelings and memories really are; what humans would be without them.  Such a book isn't writtin every day!<BR>This is one of those books you could read over and over and never get bored.  I strongely recommend this book.
B00004RFFI|3.0|\\"Twister\\" is a movie that serves the appetizers but not the main course.  Throughout the movie, we're treated to some really cool special effects that capture the horror of a tornado.  Winds blow, cars get turned upside down, and even cows get tossed about.  Hands down, the twister itself should have gotten an award for Best Actor in a Leading Role.  The rest of the movie, however, is completely negligible.  Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton do little more than run around, looking scared and uttering lines of dialogue that never graduatre from the obvious.  And the plot?  It's basically an afterthought.  Twister makes a decent if unspectacular DVD, though.  Not only does the 5.1 mix rock the house, but thanks to the chapter selections, you can skip those boring parts that have tons of dialogue and go straight to the action scenes.  \\"Twister\\" isn't a bad movie, but a very bland one minus the special effects.  Recomended for die-hard action fans only; casual movie watchers should proceed with caution.
B00005K3LU|4.0|The 3rd of this series is the best, which is unusual. This one's better than the 2nd though, huge disapointment with the 2nd one. Anyhow, terrorists take over the Nakatomi Plaza, leader of this is Alan Rickman. Jon Maclean(Bruce Willis) is on a vacation there to see his wife. He's a New York cop, he's the only weapon against these terroritsts. He tries everything to get the dumb cops to listen, except one, who listens and is determined to protect John Maclean, from the other dumb cops. A good movie, 2 thumbs up. Watch this and the 3rd, the 2nd one isn't worth it!!
B00005JKYS|5.0|I laughed, I cried, it moved me. I saw it five times. This is the one you cant miss.

B000051VWW|5.0|What an incredible cd!!  Sade shows off her talents in this smooth, dance, pop, soul sound mixed with only the spark that she gives!!  A must have!
B00005RY7X|5.0|this CD are really Powerful.   When I played it at a no-too-hard Party, my friends and guest started that jump-like-a-crazy-freak Dance. Then, that Bored-Hardless party became to a really Freakin' Party-HARD.   AWK is a new-born singer in Mexico.<BR>Whe he came to mexico a week ago.  I went to the concert and it was powerful.  AWK changed that 'I love NYC' song to 'I love MEXICO CITY'.
B000065AG8|5.0|Pixar works hard to unite top-drawer technique with an excellent story, and this work pays off handsomely in Monsters, Inc.  The world in which Monstropolis is located is beautifully realized, first logically, then visually - to have one component without the other would lead to failure.  But even with a perfect alternate reality, the film would still fail if we didn't completely believe in the characters.  I have babysat for some of the \\"Boos\\" of this world, and I had always suspected that Sully and Mike used to sneak out of my closet door, crawl under the bed, and make weird noises, now I know that I was right.
6303314015|5.0|The Lion King 1&2 are the best movies disney has ever made, and there's no doubt about it! Every bit about it is great, and I don't think I'll ever get sick of the movies either! The songs are terrific, and the detail in the movie is great (even the clouds move!) Keep up the good work, disney, and I'm hoping to see a Lion Ling 3 soon!!!
B00003CXTG|2.0|The movie itself is alright, but Ben Affleck isn't an actor at all. He ruined the whole movie. Josh Hartnet was excelent.
B000002UAO|5.0|This is an excellent addition to the One album, which has most of the Greatest Beatles songs. Two of the best songs not on that album are on this album. Michelle, which was the third most commercially successful Beatles song (behind Yesterday and Hey Jude).<br />The other song, of course, is In My Life, which is a very Lennon song, with the music written by Paul McCartney, according to his official biography which I have also reviewed. Norwegian Wood is a great Lennon song.  This is a great album, and easy to listen all the way through without skipping, because the song quality is consistently high.<br />None of the songs on this album are on the One album, so there is no duplication, which is a major plus. Highly recommended.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|It's my second fav. movie ever. It's simply beautiful, flawless, confusing, scary, perfect,...<BR>This one isn't for narrow-minded people.
B000066C1N|4.0|This is a good soundtrack suffering only in the production quality of some of the tracks.  My only gripe: I wanted the song that is used in the most recent trailers.  It is a female vocalist.  Does anyone know who does it and where I can get it?
B00005JKQZ|5.0|This is an excelent movie!!! Can't wait till its DVD's release!! Russell Crowe decerved that Oscar. Not many male actors can make me cry while I'm watching their performance. This one can.
B000062TU1|5.0|I have seen the Movie in Theater as well as in DVD.It is excellent.The features provided in DVD is really good.Tour is beautiful.

B00005RY7X|4.0|It's alot of fun and it's much better than listening to all this boring depressing stuff thats on the radio today.  Just goto your friends, get drunk, and put on some AWK!
B000003TA4|5.0|This CD is the best Nirvana CD, and probably one of the best CDs period. The album rocks, enough said. Buy it if you don't already own it, it's far worth the price, even if you buy it used.
B00005RY7X|5.0|Can I just say one thing? Andrew W.K.'s new album &quot;I Get Wet&quot; is fist pumping, hard rocking, crazy partying album. This has to be one of my favorite cd's. It combines Heavy Metal, 80's Pop, and Punk, and there's even a piano, all in one cd. It redefines the meaning of the word party, into a whole new headbanging genre. This is a real find in these days of so called misery rock. There isn't a song on this cd I don't like. Its about having as much fun as you possibly can and getting wet in the process, that is partying.
B000003RCY|5.0|Well ive listened to rammstein since they came out and well they are the best, the best live band , saw them on tuesday, the best musical band and the coolest guys.<br />get this album and all the rest NOW!
B00003CXQX|5.0|Disney has done it again.<br />Not since the first Aladdin movie have I enjoyed a Walt Disney cartoon so much. Nor have I laughed at one so hard.<br />As with most cartoons, the voices behind the characters will either make or break it. I have always liked David Spade's voice better than him himself, and he very much delivers here. His voice has just enough edge to it to make his character, Emporer Kuzco, grate your nerves to the point that you hope his adversary does manage to do him in, but not so much that you are ready to do it yourself.<br />For me, however, the best is having Eartha Kitt as the voice of Yzma. Ever since her days as CatWoman on the TV series Batman, I have enjoyed her sultry voice. Yzma may be old and wrinkly, but her voice makes you forget all about that. You almost want to help Yzma yourself, a definite credit to Kitt.<br />The gags are hilarious, the action is almost nonstop, and the laughter coming from you will be geniune. Disney knows how to make kids movies that adults can enjoy, and this adult has enjoyed the movie many times (and not once with a kid in sight).
B00005JKCF|4.0|Spiderman is the perfect summer movie.  It features a well known hero, played by a talented, well known actor and has a very good supporting cast.  Toby Maguire is excellent as the smart but nerdy Peter Parker and doubles perfectly as the beefed up, super cool Spiderman.  Toby Maguire has shown us what a good actor he is in films like \\"Wonder Boys\\" and \\"Cider House Rules\\" so it is great to see him in an action film where he can let loose and just have fun.  Kirstin Dunst is good as Peter's sexy but elusive love interest and Willem Dafoe is delightfully demented and evil as the Green Goblin.  The action sequences are exactly what you'd expect and my only problem was some slow pacing at certain points in the movie.  With the origin of Spidey out of the way and introducing Peter Parker's character, the next movie should be able to move completely forward into non-stop action.  Regardless, this is well worth the wait.  If you a superhero film, action buff, or just love lots of colorful movie making, go see \\"Spiderman\\".  I recommend it highly.
B00001ODHJ|4.0|This has to be one of my favorite flicks.  Ash Cambell will remind you of &quot;duke nukem&quot; with his little sayings throughout the movie.  All together, this makes for an enjoyable, yet funny  flick.  The director has successfully integrated horror and comedy. Love this movie!<br />Come get some!
B00005RY7X|5.0|i first heard andrew wk a few months ago through a friend and within a few days i was hooked, he is absolutlty amazing, every song on this cd is amazing and will keep your energy up 200 percent with their amazing wall of sound for the length of it. my personal favorites are \\"get ready to die\\" and \\"she is beautiful\\". and after you buy this cd and know every song everyone should try to see him in concert, he puts on an amazing show and if extremely friendly to the fans after the show. 5 STARS. this music is pulling us out of the musical slump we are in and have been in for quite a while. i recommend it 100 percent, it will stay in your cd player for weeks.
B000002H72|5.0|this album is the best indie rock album ever. it's also one of the best albums of all time in rock n roll. the pixies were a fabulous band that inspired a lot of other bands to copy their style. weezer especially. now to the album itself...the first song, debaser is awesome, so is tame,wave of mutilation and i bleed. here comes your man is the best song the pixies ever made, one of the best songs ever made. a unforgettable song. monkey gone to heaven is awesome. hey is good, and the last song, gouge away is great. so this is the album to get no matter what your into. it transcends all types of music. if you haven't been introduced to the pixies, you should get this one...now others might say to get surfer rosa, that that's their best album. don't get me wrong, surfer rosa is great, but doolittle is much better. its a classic.
B00005Q45W|1.0|This is not a Leonard Cohen album any more than it is, let's say, a Roy Orbison album.  Cohen's name and reputation have been hijacked by Sharon Robinson for heaven-only-knows-what motive.  Cohen gets exactly one verse sung solo, she joins in and double-tracks him for the remainder of the album.  It is almost as if she is ashamed of his voice and performance and sees the urgent need to cover him up, perhaps \\"for his own good.\\"  The result in a stupifyingly monochromatic production, utterly devoid of invention or surprise.  \\"Dull\\" is too generous a discription to use for Robinson's work.  In addition, her vocal style is not at all compatable with Cohen's.  She: all cheap R & B style, he: his droning self -- which is far more appealing than her coverage on top and around him.  Needless to say, I detest this album.  Perhaps two songs are worth hearing, the rest seem compromised to death.  If you want to hear Cohen interpreted at its best, Jennifer Warnes' \\"Famous Blue Raincoat\\" will reveal to you why Cohen is regarded as a fine songwriter and a marvelous poet.  \\"10 New Songs\\" is as close to a debacle as I have heard from a major artist in years

B00004X0ER|4.0|So goes the opening line of \\"Supply and Demand,\\" the final song on the Hives crotch-kicking new album \\"Veni Vidi Vicious.\\"  No, the Hives are not rewritnig the book on catchy punk rock.  In fact they've just jumped into the game after their \\"Barely Legal\\" was a straight-up speed punk manifesto.<br /><br />So the Hives are not reinventing the wheel, but they sure do give you one hell of a ride.  From \\"Hives [Declare Nucler War]\\" to \\"Outsmarted\\" to \\"Statecontrol\\" to the final track, these songs rock with punk abandon but sacrifice nothing in the way of catchiness.  Only the Carribbean tinged \\"Find Another Girl\\" lags behind the rest.<br /><br />Yeah, their influences are obvious and yeah, the world hasn't changed since this album came out, but who cares?  The Hives rock and that's all that needs to be said.
B000063S6Z|5.0|The most beautiful album I' ve ever listened to. Better than &quot;Play&quot;, no mean feat.
B00005OAIE|5.0|With lovely production from John Alagia, John Mayer has crafted an excellent album of modern adult alternative music with _Room For Squares_.  With vocals and music very reminiscent of Dave Matthews Band, the twenty-something Mayer writes directly from the heart with a maturity beyond his years.<br />It's no surprise that the songs on _Room For Squares_ are focused on a young man in the &quot;real world.&quot;  &quot;No Such Thing&quot; kicks this sentiment into motion, and is as good a pop song as you'll hear.  It rightly deserves all the radio play and recognition it has received.  &quot;Why Georgia&quot; and &quot;My Stupid Mouth&quot; are also clever yet down-to-earth looks at living alone and saying the wrong thing at the wrong moment respectively.  The lyrics are the highlight of the album for me - they reflect a youthfulness as well as a maturity that make them refreshing and poignant rather than self-indulgent and tedious.  A cynic might scoff at a song title like &quot;Your Body is a Wonderland&quot;, but Mayer pulls off the obvious sentiment nicely with his restrained and gentle delivery.  Highlights on the album include &quot;No Such Thing&quot;, &quot;Neon&quot;, and &quot;Love Song for No One.&quot;<br />I'm sure fans of artists such as DMB, Travis, Sting, Coldplay, and David Gray will defintely like this album.  I'm glad it is getting such wide recognition because it is a welcome change of pace from other mainstream music that is currently being played on the radio.
B00005JKCF|2.0|Spiderman is a serviceable summer movie with little or no ambition to be a true classic. Is it the limited skills of director Sam Raimi (famous for the Evil Dead movies and, well, other generally bad films)? The tight-fisted budget of Sony? The unexciting background and kiddie-appeal of everyone's favorite webhead? A thoroughly unspired script that probably had any intriguing or daring parts cut out during the fifteen years or so they've been developing this film?<br />Probably all of the above. A leisurely, standard issue action movie moves along fine with somewhat bland performances by everyone except Willem Dafoe - who is over-the-top in a bad way throughout the film. Not all his fault; Raimi and his clueless costume designers have suited Dafoe up in a silly headpiece that would challenge any actor trying to convey menace. Ho-hum special effects (very obvious CGI) breeze by fast enough to not distract too much but the action sequences are haphazard and not much fun. Setpiece scene of Green Goblin attacking a big festival is very corny, with Spidey saving a kid frozen solid in fear as a big building comes crashing down. The webslinger scoops him up and hands him to Mom, who screams \\"Bless you, Spiderman!\\" Did anyone see that coming when you first spot the doe-eyed kid sitting there? You know, it's not suspenseful if you know exactly was will happen.<br />Most of the blame must go to Raimi. He comes up with no interesting shots (apart from the famous upside down kiss), doesn't have control of Dafoe and hired a production designer who thinks that less is more. Where are the magnificent sets of the Batman movies? Everything here looks like a set and a poorly constructed one (Tight Sony pursestrings or Raimi not caring? Both?)<br />Regardless, I think anyone can enjoy the modest charms of the film as long as your expectations are low. I'll admit to not being a big fan of Spiderman and the film certainly didn't help that.
0451457994|4.0|Clarke's novels are always well structured and are comfortable to read because they always progress forward with as little of flashbacks as possible. the story itself is the first SF novel to examine the possibilities and implications of intelligent extraterrestrial life in light of current knowledge of space explorations,astrophysics, and biology. it is difficult to agree with the author , however, that there are beings who can invent living intelligence( by converting an unintelligent species to an intelligent one), othe than god. it is a real page turner, though.

0679411585|5.0|\\"We Were Soldiers Once...and Young\\" ranks as one of the best books I have read on the Vietnam War and is definitely a must read if one is studying the Vietnam War.  One really appreciates the courage and sacrifice of the American soldiers who fought this battle.  An aspect of the Vietnam War that it covers is the use of \\"neutral\\" Cambodia by the North Vietnamese/Viet Cong Communist forces.  US forces, thanks to President Lyndon Johnson and Secretary of Defense Robert \\"We Were Wrong\\" MacNamara, were not allowed to pursue Communist forces into Cambodia.  As is mentioned in the book, the free use of Cambodian sanctuaries allowed the Communist forces to choose when to fight in South Vietnam, or when to retreat if casualties become too heavy.  With this tremendous advantage, is it any real surprise that the North Vietnamese emerged victorious in 1975?
B00005YXZH|2.0|Tweedy and Farrar have been making great music for years.  It appears as if they were better off together than apart.  Each seems to be missing what the other has in abundance. This is a very uneven album - too few fantastic songs surrounded by overproduced guitar trackes with too much random noise. I find it jarring to listen to either through headphones or speakers.  Seems as if every new noise/guitar trick that Wilco learned was included.  I would have expected that on an early album.  Here it just ruins good pop songs.  The label story makes for great hype, but this disc didn't last long in the CD player.
B000003TAW|5.0|Well, this is their first album and it is a great debut.  They have their Rock Star name tags ready.<br />Buy it.  Love it.  Listen to it a lot.<br />Trust me.
B0000668IF|4.0|If \\"Play\\" wasn't such a great listen then I would have been very dissapointed that Moby's new Cd \\"18\\" was so similar. It's perhaps even more mellow than \\"Play\\" with heaps more sampling from old gospel/blues tracks and a lack of anything that resembles \\"Bodyrock\\" or any of his earlier techno/rave stuff. It's good though - and even if the test of time proves it to be inferior to \\"Play\\" I'm sure those who loved that album (and there were many!) will learn to love this one. In fact this doesn't even require a review as such. it's exactly what you would expect.
B00005B4GU|3.0|This album needed to be released to show that Radiohead wasn't resting to prepare &quot;Kid A.&quot;<br />I do not recommend this CD.  It isn't a good enough showcase of an artist's talent.<br />Buy &quot;The Bends&quot; or &quot;OK Computer&quot; first.  Purchase this one only once you've fallen for them.
B00005JKCF|5.0|Wow! Talk about good movie! Spider-man tops the chart as one of the best movies of 2002 so far. I loved this so much! It was awesome and very spectacular cinementogrphy. I think Kirsten and Tobey pull it off beautifully! Must see movie!<br />My Grade:<BR>A+
B00004Z459|3.0|Burn it from a friend that bought a copy.<br />It is a good album...but now worth purchasing only worth listening to.
B0000668IF|4.0|If you're looking at this album, it's most likely for one of two reasons: 1) you are a Moby fan and are celebrating his new release, or 2) you heard the album's first hit, \\"We Are All Made of Stars\\". I had listened to this hit many times, and I really enjoy the song - the rest of the CD, however, is different from this song. Having listened to the entire CD, I can honestly say that if you're a fan of Moby, you will enjoy this as much as his previous release. Songs such as \\"We Are All Made of Stars\\", \\"Extreme Ways\\", and \\"Jam for the Ladies\\" are great vocal mixes. Other songs such as \\"Fireworks\\" are nice instrumentals. In conclusion, while Moby's musical style in this album differs from that in \\"Play\\", his uniqueness remains intact; seasoned fans as well as newcomers will enjoy Moby's newest release.
B00005RY7X|5.0|i hadn't heard of Andrew W.K. until a couple of months ago when i saw the music video of Party Hard ... the next day i went out and bought the cd. the whole album is great the music fills everything there isn't any empty space for you to get bored with. i've already told a bunch of people about him. watch out for a good time when you buy this album.
B00005YXZH|1.0|I bought this CD based on several 5 star reviews by other listeners.  I'm sorry, but I don't get it.  Or maybe I'm just dropping the wrong kind of acid.  I just don't really enjoy listening to a drunken Bob Geldof straining his vocal cords singing along to the sounds of a short-wave radio.  On the bright side, I was able to unload it to a &quot;fan&quot; of the band.
6305949980|5.0|If there were any other children's for everyone to own beside this one it is Willy Wonka.<br />This is classic fairy tale for everyone.<br />This edition is a much better improvement over the previous DVD release.

038533558X|5.0|This mystery was the most facinating, intrigueing novel that I have ever read.  I know people will say that, as in most mysteries, the last chapter is pivotal, but I was shocked in the VERY LAST PARAGRAPH, let alone the last chapter.  This book is a can't miss.  It is a must.  GONE FOR GOOD will not dissappoint.
B00005LMBK|5.0|Yes.  I said.  I wasn't the first and I won't be the last.<br />Where else was there such an album as this? It rocks.<BR>There are no songs to &quot;kick to the curb&quot;.<br />Buy and love it.  <br />See them live and wonder for weeks.<br />Buy G-Sides and love it.
6302732778|3.0|I know that I am going to stir the wrath of the fanatics who understandably believe that the 1993 version is better than the original one. But, in my opinion, the 1982 version is better. The reason is that the narrator's voice (which comes out noticeably more convincing in the french version) adds a humanistic/literary/philosophical flavor to a wagnerian epic portraying a crushing and hopeless world, where the distinction between humans and humanoids has become blurred. Then images and words and music miraculously coalesce to create a stunning, operatic filmic experience, culminating in this crucial realization : the preciousness and undestructibility of individual (human/post-human?) consciousness. <br />Regards,<br />Stefano Manghi
B00003CX5A|4.0|Well, Tim Burton was certainly the best modern director to make this film.  It is great upon the first and second viewing.<BR>After the third, pieces seem to drag.<br />But, I have to admit i have never seen a Burton film look SO good.<br />Rent it first.  Then maybe buy it.
B000002UTT|5.0|Look Sharp!! What a great album. Even after so many years I can still put this CD on and sing at the top of my voice with every song! Per and Marie did a wonderful job on this CD. From the number One opening track \\"The Look\\" to the sultry \\"Sleeping Single\\", the lyrical \\"Paint\\", you can tell that this is a CD worth taking a closer look at! \\"Chances\\" is by far one of the best tracks on here, and it showcases how both Marie and Per's voices can blend so perfectly. The CD concludes with the powerful ballad \\"Listen To Your Heart\\" which shot to number One when it was released. <BR>I personally do not feel that there is one weak song on this album, but if i had to pick one it would be \\"Cry\\". The flow of the music for this one just doesnt seem to go right with the wonderful lyrics.<BR>All in all, as an American starter for this terrific Swedish duo, \\"Look Sharp!\\" has it all!
0446608955|5.0|A Walk to Remember<br />  A Walk to Remember by Nicholas Sparks was a really good book.  It was well written, had a good message, and well developed characters.  Therefore I rate this book a five star book.  Nicholas Sparks is an awesome author.<BR>  It was written as if Landon, an old man, was looking back and reminiscing on his younger years as a high school student.  He tells you how he fell for the small town pastor's daughter, Jamie Sullivan.  In his point of view as an older and experienced adult he tells you little things that he would have changed and what he will never regret.  It's really cool to get the old Landon's and the young Landon's point of views.     <BR>  The book had an overall interesting story line with a good message.  Landon was always one of the guys who made fun of Jamie until he finally got to meet her.  He learns from being with her, how to treat people and to live life to the fullest every day.  It may seem like a cliché, \\"live life to the fullest\\", but it is really a good message and it's true.  If there is any way of proving that, this is the book to read.<BR>  The character of Landon is really easy to connect with, especially as a teenager.  You get the teenage point of view, to which you can relate, and then the adult's view to kind of reflect back and tell you how he feels now about making that decision.  You get to know Landon very well and you'll find that as reading you will laugh and cry right along with him.<BR>-KRP
B00005QXXO|4.0|This is a fine introduction to Radiohead's more recent work.  This is band that slowly reveals itself to you over repeated listenings.  There is always another layer of the onion to peel.<br />How many Radiohead fans have attended a Star Trek convention?  Lots I would bet.
B00003CXI1|5.0|I never wanted to read the HP books, and I am bored by most all the movies that get released, let alone a mere \\"kiddie\\" movie.  But somehow the reviews for HP when it was first about to be released piqued my interest so I went to see it in the theatre...and I was HOOKED.  I learned the error of my ways that day, HP is not just a story for kids but for anyone who wants a truly entertaining movie (and I might add I've since bought the books and found them worthy of spending the extra cash to own in hardback).  Of course, if you prefer pretentious artsy movies that trade entertainment for self-absorbed depth then HP is not a movie you will be able to appreciate.  For anyone else, I recommend get this movie!
B00005QG9J|5.0|this cd is so awesome.  at first it wasnt one of my favorite cds, because it was so different from their other albums, but the more i listened to it, the more i liked it.  my favorite songs on the album are mexico, echo, are you in and aqueous transmission. i HIGHLY recommend this cd to anyone who likes incubus or who just wants to listen to good music.  it is still in my cd player and i bought it a day after it was released.  it is one of my all-time favorite cds.
B00005JKMQ|5.0|In the reviews what ive seen is everyone here who says that hated the movie, Ali, had very poor excuses for hating it.  They are not at all well thought out because of the fact they expected to much from this film,  when in fact they were missing what I believe was a very good point for the movie.  I remember seeing one guys review saying that the films boxing scenes were poorly done and had bad sound editing throughout the movie.  Who ever said that missed the point as did the rest of those people who gave the movie bad reviews.<BR>  No the movie does not reveal very many new things about Ali's life, but that was not its intension.  no the movie does not portry his life very well at all, but that was not its intention.  I think everyone who gave this film a bad rating were being to critcal and picky.  They wanted the movie to show &quot;new&quot; things about his life, they wanted it to show &quot;Action&quot; and &quot;suspense&quot;.  Every single one of you who says this is WRONG.  <BR>  Heres what the PURPOSE of the film was.  In the fight scene with Sonny Liston, Liston hits Ali in the chest and knocks him against the ropes.  Usually a fighters eyes will shut or his head will bob down.  But what happenes is, the camera focuses in on Will Smiths face and goes to slow motion, showing where Alis eyes were focused.  Right on Liston.  His eyes weren't on anyone else but Liston.  This is the focus of the film, to get inside Ali's head.  Watch the Foreman fight, you hear Ali's thoughts, he is talking to himself and drowning out everyother sound out there.  The guy who said the movie had bad sound editing, he wasn't thinking.  It was done that way on purpose, because alot of the times when the sound was where you could barely hear it, it was that way because the director doesn't want you to pay attention to the sound, he wants you to pay attention to whats surrounding Ali and how he reacts.<BR>  This movie does an extremely good job at what it is trying to portray.  But people who dont like it are to closed minded to relize this.
B00005QDW1|4.0|There are always fans to be upset when a band changes style. It seems that this is what happens to No Doubt with this album, less rock and more pop oriented than their previous ones.<br />You feel dance hall influence in songs like &quot;Hey Baby&quot; (in the end not the best track here), the laid back &quot;Underneath it all&quot;, &quot;Start the fire&quot; and the title track. This is not new actually, No Doubt had shown that type of influence before. Others make you think about Garbage and Blondie like &quot;Making out&quot; (I love that one), &quot;Detective&quot;, &quot;Platinum Blonde Life&quot; and &quot;Running&quot;. &quot;Waiting room&quot; cannot hide the fact Prince (or however he calls himself these days) has written it. Some songs have a strong 80's feeling like &quot;Don't let me down&quot;, &quot;In my head&quot; and the electro &quot;Hella Good&quot;.<br />This album will obviously not change music forever and I trust No Doubt fans when they say that the band already wrote deeper lyrics. I still think it is a good, fun record, with really nice, agreeable songs to chill out and groove on. So do not deny yourself the pleasure and just party on. This is probably not Gwen's last word anyway (that girl has enough personality to surprise us again)...
1573226521|3.0|This wildly over-hyped first novel, which was followed by a supposedly dreadful Leonardo DiCaprio film version, gets by mainly on the strength of<br />references to classic (especially Vietnam-era) literature and modern pop culture and a sado-masochistic plotline where Gen-X gets taught a lesson.  In<br />the story of a young backpacker in Southeast Asia, who finds a kind of utopian commune on an island beach off the coast of Thailand, Garland seems<br />to be quite consciously summoning everything from Lord of the Flies to Gilligan's Island.  And he explicitly invokes The Heart of Darkness,<br />Apocalypse Now, Platoon, etc., and a wide range of video games with which I'm not familiar.  The result is a book that's achingly aware of where it's<br />coming from, but teases us by wandering down the paths of its various sources only to end up in dead-ends.  So, when we finally do get where we're<br />going we feel a tad ill-used.<br />The book begins with our putative protagonist, Richard, in Bangkok, where a bungalow mate tells him how to find the island and then commits<br />suicide.  Richard and a French couple set out to find the much-rumored beach and, after some reasonably exciting difficulties, do so.  The denizens<br />don't seem to have much of a philosophy or a sense of mission; they're content just to have found a beach that other tourists haven't \\"ruined\\".  Their<br />days are spent in fishing, gathering food, and performing a variety of other mundane tasks just aimed at keeping their community going.  They divert<br />themselves with a few sports contests, a Gameboy, and a lot of dope, illicitly obtained from a local field that is the domain of a scary group of armed<br />men, with whom they have an implicit non-interference agreement.<br />Over the course of the novel the tension begins to rise within the community and between the beach dwellers and the dope growers.  Richard fears<br />that a couple fellow travelers with whom he shared the story of the beach may show up and get him in trouble with his reclusive comrades.  And we<br />gradually realize that Richard is a rather unreliable narrator, as his drug use, which requires ever bolder incursions on the drug fields, and his<br />imaginary conversations with the dead guy who told him about the beach start to obscure reality.  Even more startling is the way in which he seems to<br />want to create his own version of the Vietnam experience on the island.  He's itching for trouble and we're pretty sure he's eventually going to find it.<br />The book maintains a compelling atmosphere of dread and Mr. Garland is an effective story-teller, but there's a sort of dissatisfying hollowness to the<br />whole affair.  The dialogue is almost entirely pointless and that seems to be the author's intent.  The islanders lack of any meaningful goals makes<br />their group seem temporary almost by definition, so we're never emotionally invested in its survival.  We know that as soon as they're found the group<br />will collapse, because the beach won't be \\"cool\\" anymore.  Meanwhile, their coolness is an inadequate hook for our rooting interest.  Worst of all,<br />because they don't believe in anything interesting, other than a kind of dubious communal ethos, and because they have nothing interesting to say, it's<br />not apparent that Mr. Garland even wants us to care that they and their Beach are doomed.  In fact, there's guilty pleasure to be had in watching it all<br />come a cropper.<br />It's not a bad book, and I can accept that Mr. Garland's message may be that this generation of young people lead lives that are so devoid of purpose<br />that they have to live vicariously through cultural reference to other people's experiences, that the highest aspirations of his generation, their visions of<br />Utopia, amount to nothing more than an unlimited supply of pot and an undiscovered beach on which to smoke it and play Tetris.  But if that's all this<br />was about, it seems like he could have conveyed that message more quickly.  Four hundred something pages was a long time to spend with a group of<br />characters who even their creator seemed to want dead.<br />GRADE : C+veyed that message more quickly.  Four hundred something pages was a long time to spend with a group of <BR>characters who even their creator seemed to want dead.<br />GRADE : C+
0671027344|5.0|The book made me feel warm and happy. It brought back highschool memories and made a tear fall from my eye. I think this is a great read an would recommend it to a friend. The style of writing is amazing, it is easy to follow, and get lost in.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|I have to admit I was hesitant to watch this with the kids, having read that some of the language and humor were inappropriate, and some of it does seem gratuitous<br />and needlessly provocative; it would be a better film without.  But it's so much fun, so energetic, and the computer generated animation looks so good, that I suppose<br />it can be grudgingly forgiven a few excesses.<br />The filmmakers have taken William Steig's fairly minimal story and expanded it into a full blown fairy tale, complete with an evil lord, a dragon, and a plot<br />borrowed from Beauty and the Beast.  Then they've given the whole thing a post-Modern twist that Steig would surely approve of, with insider jabs at Disney,<br />Princess Fiona reenacting slo-mo kung fu scenes from Cameron Diaz's Charlie's Angels role, and various other humorous touches that give an adult overlay to a<br />film that kids enjoy at an entirely different level.<br />But for all the snarky humor, the Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy antics, and the impressive technology, the most delightful irony is that movie ends up working<br />because of the way it taps into classic themes.  Shrek, the ugly and much-feared ogre, goes and rescues the princess after Lord Farquaad promises to restore the<br />misanthropic privacy of his swampy home.  But over the course of their adventure the previously solitary ogre becomes friends with donkey and falls in love with<br />Fiona.  Together they learn timeless lessons about friendship, loyalty, love, and the true nature of beauty.  Those involved may think themselves hip and daring<br />heroes of counterculture for calling a donkey a \\"jack...\\" in a kids' film, but the joke's on them as they retreat into homey bourgeois homilies by film's end, which<br />Mr. Steig seem likely to have disapproved of.  I very much like the poetic justice of the filmmakers retreat.  But, of course, I'm a bourgeois and believe in those<br />homilies.<br />GRADE : A
0451191153|5.0|The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand is an exciting book that has a very powerful message.  It can be read on many different levels.  It can be read simply as a fictional story about an architect who overcomes obstacles and challenges.  It can also be read for the deeper meaning of the philosophy behind it.  There are also many different levels of thinking in-between.  No matter what level you read it on, it is still a powerful book.   <BR>    The main character, Howard Roark, is based off Rand's perception of the \\"ideal man\\".  Roark lives out Rand's philosophy of objectivism, as the main characters in other Rand pieces similarly do.  Rand's integration of philosophy and exciting fiction makes for a good read whether you agree with objectivism or not.<BR>     I gave this book 5 stars because it holds your attention, makes you think, and helps you develop your own views on life.  While the book doesn't necessarily contain \\"action\\" the whole time, the characters and their personalities keep you turning pages.  The book is written in a way that it doesn't force any ideas on you, but it lets you form your own opinions.  It all depends on what level you read the book.  If you read it as just another fiction novel, you'll come away with the same beliefs as you did before, and that's great.  But if you really dig into it and try to understand the ideas behind it, you'll probably get more out of it.
6305014140|4.0|This movie is very good, but unfortunately not perfect.  The fighting is very good in most parts, but very short in my opinion.  The ending fight scene is probably the best out of the whole movie when him and his arch-enemy Gemma duke it out (especially when Jubei headbutts him).  The whole movie is basically about the hero, Jubei, fighting a group of ninjas each with super-human powers.  When you do watch this movie, steer clear of the dub.  Its basically a clone of Wicked City with the same voice actors being re-introduced.<br />  Also, I've noticed that this movie also (like Wicked City) offers a fair share of female sexual abuse.  It might be because that's how it was back then, but in one scene they show one particular sex-oriented thing that probably could have been left out entirely without hurting the movie one bit (the scene where the shadow ninja captures Kigero).<br />  Otherwise, this movie was a delight to watch, but its not near worth the hype that surrounds it.  I would still reccomend the DVD to true fans of the Anime and ninja type shows.<br />NOTE:  This movie features a ninja named Jubei but has nothing to do with another show that is very similar to it called Ninja Resurrection.  Both shows have ninjas as the base of attraction and a hero named Jubei, but neither have anything to do with each other.  Two different companies, two different shows.
6305327041|2.0|Being a huge fan of Quentin Tarantino I decided to rent Four Rooms the other night. Little did I realize, I would be wasting a good hour and a half of my life. I knew right away it was not going to be half as good as his other work, but my main expectation was to see my favorite actress, Marisa Tomei, in the film. I kinda figured she would be in the movie a bit longer since she was placed on the cover in a blonde wig, but that was just a &quot;low blow from Tarantino&quot;. Marisa shows up for a grand three minutes. You can't fully blame Tarantino for this movie, because 3 other directors helped him to make this movie. Basically I was expecting much more, but I realized it was just a series of one-acts and should only be appreciated as that. The acting is good, but its just simply bizarre, and leaves you wanting more (Marisa Tomei)
B00005K9QP|4.0|As you can see from the other reviews, this is considered a legendary album.  But there is one element that grates on me when listening - John Mayall's singing.  Oh yea, maybe in '66 you had never heard Stevie Winwood or any number of American blues singers and thought this was the real thing.  But now - no way.  I keep waiting for Mayall's vocals to end.  Clapton's one vocal turn is fine. Clapton's playing is superb - although you realize he has never progressed much beyond what he did then.  <br />As a piece of musical history it gets 5 stars.  As an album I have to give it 4.
B000002UAO|5.0|\\"Rubber Soul\\" (1965), along with \\"Revolver\\" (1966), clearly representation the transitional period between the \\"early\\" Beatles and \\"Sgt. Pepper.\\" In terms of performance this was the shift from a live band to a studio band, and the influence of producer George Martin is obvious on several of these songs. The growing sophistication of Lennon & McCartney as songwriters is equally apparent, spurned as much by the influences of eastern music (e.g., Harrison's sitar work on \\"Norwegian Wood\\") and the burgeoning drug culture (e.g., \\"The Word\\") as by their desire to write more than pop hits. This album might offer up a melodic love song like \\"Michelle\\" and a simple rocker like \\"Drive My Car,\\" but there is also the poignant lyricism of \\"Nowhere Man\\" and \\"In My Life.\\"  On the one hand, the Beatles are still singing mostly love songs on \\"Rubber Soul,\\" but on the other hand their is a great leap forward in terms of what they have to say about love this time around.  I have also seen a compelling argument that it is on \\"Rubber Soul\\" than John Lennon and Paul McCartney start to really become different songwriters (which is seen by some as being the influence of Bob Dylan, a logical explanation to be sure).<br /><br />Much has always been made of how the \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" album burst on the music scene, but \\"Rubber Soul\\" definitely begins laying the groundwork. \\"Girl\\" especially sounds representative of the \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" period, while \\"Run For Your Life\\" is consistent with the hits the Beatles had produced over the previous couple of years. The first record I ever owned was \\"The Beatles Second Album,\\" which, of course, is not available on CD because it was produced in America and took songs off of three or four British Beatles albums. But even before I was aware of these differences \\"Rubber Soul\\" was obviously a shift in direction for the Beatles with \\"Revolver\\" representing the next step in their evolution, which explains why \\"Rubber Soul\\" is #5 and \\"Revolver\\" #3 on the list of 500 greatest albums of all time put out by \\"Rolling Stone\\" (Yes, \\"Sgt.

B00004XQ83|5.0|When I reviewed the movie &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot;, I was pretty rough on my views of using unoriginal music, especially in &quot;sampling&quot; form to put in the movie.  I thought &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot;'s music samplings were blantant attempts to pander to an audience with a short attention span.  <br />So now I run accross a soundtrack that uses a lot of familiar old tunes.  Sampling?  Pandering?  Should I thumb my nose at this one, too, and tell them to go write their own original songs?  <br />Hell no.  This is completely different.  The songs here are carefully chosen to present a world that is very real.  Not only was it like this during the period it represents, but there is still a segment of the American population that lives the way these characters do.  It's a world who's music does not appear in the top 40.  It's a world of deeply religious people who have the serenity of believing that they are put on this earth to earn their place in heaven, and everything they do is in preparation for this.  <br />You don't have to get religion from listening to this soundtrack, but you'll have a greater understanding of the way of life of those folk if you do.
B00005YXZH|2.0|I am from St. Louis and my first concert was an Uncle Tupelo and Firehose concert.  I really appreciate Jay and Jeff's music and all they have done.  The last few Wilco cds have been less than interesting to me so, when I read so many glowing reviews of the new Wilco CD, I had to buy it in hopes of a reinvigorated Wilco.  What I found was a much improved Wilco.  I liked this cd but it wasn't all that the hype led me to believe it would be.  &quot;Jesus, etc.&quot; &quot;heavy metal drummer&quot;  &quot;I am trying to break your heart&quot; &quot;pot kettle black&quot;  and &quot;poor places&quot; are my favorite songs.  Actually, probably one of the least talked about songs &quot;pot kettle black&quot; is my favorite because it is understated and it reminds me of why I like Jeff Tweedy's voice so much. It's an earnest song without any unnecessary electronic frills.  I like all of the electronic glitch noises but I need just a bit more from the songs.  They are good but not what I had hoped for.  Not a bad effort and they are on the right path.
B00005O5JV|4.0|This is a film I really wanted to be good, and I was not disappointed.  From the opening scenes of mega-eye-candy, showing the important things in the world of the sorority, this could have easily turned into yet another vulgar teen comedy and quickly forgotten.  If not for the clever writing of the Elle Woods character, and the casting of Reese Whitherspoon, this could have easily went down this path.  <br />What I liked very much is that it's easy to think early on that Elle is exactly the ditz she seems to be.  Her world is shallow, and full of fluff, and she works hard at maintaining the status quo.  Had she become engaged to her boyfriend as she planned to at the start of the story, she might have stayed in this world.  <br />But what we start seeing of her is that she's a very smart person.  She has excelled in her chosen field of fashion merchandising, because that's all that was ever expected of her.  While her original reasons for trying to make more of herself are, well, ditzy, we start seeing a person capable of accomplishing a lot without compromising a lot of what is important to her.  <br />This would still not make it a really good movie if it wasn't for one more characteristic.  The Elle character is a genuinely good person.  While being on the receiving end of a lot of abuse for her lifestyle, she dishes out almost none on her own.  This is a genuinely nice person who you root for to win in the end.<br />The only problem I had was the lightweight legal material.  I saw exactly where the movie was going when Elle questions the daughter about a perm, and I'm sorry, but witnesses don't fall down and confess so easily.  But I guess this is to make me realize that this is still a comedy, and not to worry about such things.
B0000668IF|4.0|18 is a solid overall effort from Moby. On a whole, 18 is more complex and interesting than Play. Moby's progression as an artist, producer, engineer, etc...is evident. His true strength is his ability to create lush musical soundscapes that deserve to be heard on a dynamic soundsystem. 18 is a must have disc for the NOW, and for a look into what the FUTURE holds for Moby. Stay tuned.
B00005QK39|5.0|I bought this album the day it was released in London back in '83. I was eagerly awaiting this LP after the wonderful singles that set the stage and I couldn't have been any more overwhelmed upon hearing their maiden voyage in full length form.<BR>The lyrics and vocals of Fish are incredible and the music is magical. And the great thing is that this album, along with the next 3, still stand the test of time.<BR>They are all, as Fish would say, &quot;brilliant&quot;.
6305013578|1.0|This version is an insult to the film, being of horrible quality as well as a version that Lang himself detested. It's not even worth the low price. So what to do? The most accurate version of this film since 1927 has just been completely reconstructed in Berlin after a three-year effort, using the latest restoration technology as well as newly discovered footage that doubles the running time of the SEVERELY edited existing versions. It is being shown in cinemas now, and upon its release on DVD later this year, it will be the only version of this film to own. The version offered above is basically like an 8-track tape from 1975, and the editing and music makes the film look like a bad comedy. (This is not the Moroder/Queen version, which is far better, but still nothing like this latest version.) Do yourself a favour and wait for the restored release. It's incredible.
B000060MWU|1.0|When I saw that this DVD is not avaialable in widescreen I chewed off my left leg.  Someone must pay.  It is a crime.
0671027344|5.0|Anyone who doesn't give this book 4 stars has no respect for literatue.  Chbosky's touching book of letters is the most beautiful amazing story you will ever read.  I know more people who's life this has changed.  I have bought this book on at least 6 or 7 occassions to give as gifts.  Wallflowers makes me want to become an English teacher just so I can give every ninth grader this book in hopes of perhaps making them a better person.  The government should pay for every highschooler to read this book.  I place this amng such classics as Great Gatsby & Catcher in the rye.
B000003CM9|5.0|In a way, \\"Revival\\" pretty well sums up the album. The opening acoustic guitar leads into a great song with a mini-solo from Dicky, Duane, Gregg, and Berry Oakley. One of the lesser known songs on the album may be \\"Don't Keep Me Wonderin'\\" about suspected cheating. \\"Midnight Rider\\" is well-known and for good reasons but there's more here than just it. Including the magnificent instrumental \\"In Memory of Elizabeth Reed\\" (this is definitely one to jam to) and the rockin' \\"Hoochie Coochie Man\\" with Berry Oakley singing lead. Be sure to crank the volume no matter where you are when playing it. \\"Please Call Home\\" is a slowed-down ballad with Gregg singing with some real feeling. Finally, \\"Leave My Blues at Home\\" is a fitting toe-tapper to end the album with (it always makes me want to start from the beginning again).  I'm not sure, but the entire band seemed to be in perfect harmony on this album. Whether they really were or not, the album is more than perfect.
B00005JKCF|5.0|This is a movie you do not want to miss. I has a few minor flaws but otherwise its really good. The movie has everything, comedy, action, drama, and a little bit of romance. If you don't already know about the story plot it goes like this. Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) gets bitten by a genetically altered spider causing hime to get superhero powers. To keep going would spoil the movie. To tell the truth you would have to be a [fool] not to go see this movie.
B000003CM8|5.0|There is nothing, I repeat, nothing weak about this album. From the beginning of the first track &quot;Don't Want You No More&quot;, it takes only a nanosecond to be hooked by the genius that was the original Allman Brothers lineup. The only complaint that I could come close to making would be that the album is too short coming in at under thirty-five minutes. The same is true of the afformentioned opening track. At only 2:25, it always leaves me wanting more.<br />Obviously, Duane Allman is everywhere here. &quot;Black Hearted Woman&quot; has some real mean licks, as does &quot;Every Hungry Woman&quot;.  I disagree with an earlier reviewer that &quot;Dreams&quot; is a bit too long. At about seven minutes, it's just right. Hypnotic and slow grooving, there just isn't a better song on the album which brings me to &quot;Whipping Post&quot;. This is a great tune that can't really be appreciaited unless you're attempting to blow your speakers by cranking them to 11. The opening bass and Duane's solo should be pretty recognizeable.<br />The first four albums by The Allman Brothers Band are all excellent, including this one. Each one doesn't quite sound like any other so enjoy this one early and often.
B0000668IF|4.0|My expectations were high and I was, honestly, underwhelmed<BR>at first. Maybe my mistake was playing it first at high volume on<BR>my car CD player. Played at home at low volume it sounds better with<BR>each listening. The sampled soul voices are less unique than on PLAY. When did gospel start sounding like disco? Optimism, somehow, rises above the melancholy.
B00005RY7X|5.0|This album is filled with energy and awesome beats. I recommend it only to people who adventure to the world of Partying Hard. Whoever dares to buy this amazing artists' cd is in for beats for a good time.
B00005JKED|3.0|It is a violent movie with good actors, about police corruption.  If you like movies that are about so many negative things, you will like this one.  The actors are good, I just prefer movies with a more positive tone.
B00005O5JV|5.0|Virtually unknown (until now) actress Reese Witherspoon shines in this comedy! Everyone who enjoys comedy, laughs, fairly clean fun, and blondes will adore this. I watched this movie a few months ago and have seen it 7 times since, even though I'm not a huge movie watcher. I would recommend this to anyone from the ages 10 to 85.
B00005YTFG|2.0|Call it what you will MOULIN ROUGE is a complete waste of time and only suceeds in giving the viewer a splitting headache (have some asprin on standby, you'll need 'em). How this film was a multiple Oscar nominee with Best Actress and Best Picture among them I'll never know. Nicole Kidman overacts frenetically, as does the rest of the cast, though she has a good singing voice and she does look gorgeous throughout the movie. However MOULIN ROUGE rates 8/10 on the vidiot's \\"Cringe Meter\\". By the time you hear the rendition of Madonna's LIKE A VIRGIN you'll be ready to break your TV set.
B00005RFAI|5.0|Rarely do I buy a CD and love practically every song on it, but this CD is the exception.  My favorite is \\"Respect\\", her rap song. Each song has it's own funky, unique flavor.  Great CD!
0060977493|5.0|Roy's sensous, unique language draws the reader into a world where the earth sighs and the breeze speaks.  Roy's story is a woven tapestry of an anglophile society that has learned self-denigration, a country in chaotic political flux, a family with scars and memories, and a girl/woman's inner world.  Roy manages to create her own language that personalizes and makes intimate Etha and Rahel's perception of life around them.
B00005OAIE|1.0|Wow, this is incredibly boring stuff. Dave Matthews-wanna be vocals is right. i can't wait for Peter Gabriel to come back so guys like this fade away. Also, do men listen to this stuff? i cannot imagine a man actually enjoying this. Ok, maybe some baseball cap wearing BU quasi-hippie jocks. Come on people, KICK OUT THE JAMS already.
B000000XBC|3.0|A tremendous collection of songs here.  The &quot;hits&quot; are primarialy compiled on the first Volume, but there is plenty of worthy music to be found here.  &quot;Born on the Bayou&quot;, for instance, is essential, as are many songs here like &quot;Wrote a Song for Everyone&quot;.  But there is also some lesser-quality work here, which makes for a more uneven listen.  Throw Vols 1 &amp; 2 in a changer together, hit random, and it's a hell of a listen!
0679735259|5.0|I read this book in 1994, I can still remember it almost to the exact print. Herr's writing style may confuse some people who can't put litany together but this book is amazing. Everyone should have to read this book before they are allowed to vote those people in office who would do this to our soldiers again. This book provides a raw account of emotions not only from the writer but from the soldiers he encountered. To those of us who never experienced this war it is a mind boggling concept that Herr brings to the table. It is very important that the Vietnam war is not only portrayed in history as a bunch of skirmeshes and that it wasn't a popular war. It is very important that people understand that when there is war without purpose (to the naked eye) that there are actual beings affected by this. Herr has written a heart breaking, soul stirring account of what went on in Vietnam. The sad part is that there are very few books that take this kind of approach and what is left is a gluttony of garbage on the subject.

B00005YU1O|5.0|Waking Life is a fast ride through the subconscious of humanity.  I felt as if I was being thrown philosophical ideas and metaphysical dreams, twisted in colorful and poetic imagery. I hung on every word (you just about have to if you're going to make sense of it all) and immediately wanted to watch it again to catch everything I knew I had somehow missed.  It was brilliant.  I immediately ordered the DVD, which has excellent commentaries, real live sequences (without the animation) and an animation software tutorial, so we can all begin to create our own waking lives.
0440214041|4.0|When one thinks of the name John Grisham, the image of an author of legal thrillers more than likely comes to mind. John Grisham has been knocking off about a book a year for the past decade, and all of them in some way have been related to the law.<br />The Pelican Brief is no exception. While it has to do more with the Supreme Court and law students than with practicing lawyers, law is a major topic in the book. Joining law are the topics of assassination, cover-ups, and brilliant theories.<br />The Plot<br />Darby Shaw is a second-year law student at Tulane. She is a brilliant student, and enjoys a relationship with Thomas Callahan, her Constitutional Law professor. Thomas has a particular liking for Supreme Court Justice Abe Rosenberg. Rosenberg is one of the most hated men in the country, so it is not much of a surprise when Rosenberg is murdered-any number of people and groups could be suspects.<br />What is a surprise is when another Supreme Court Justice, Glenn Jensen, is murdered on the same night. The two judges have almost no viewpoints in common and seem like an unlikely pair. Soon, every FBI agent is on the case, and hundreds of eager-beaver law students are scouring the court dockets, looking for a case that might disclose a possible motive.<br />Among these student researchers is Darby Shaw. She comes up with a unique theory of her own, and even goes so far as to write up a brief about it. It becomes known as \\"The Pelican Brief.\\" Darby gives her writing to Callahan, who passes it off to Gavin Verheek, a high-ranking friend of his at the FBI. From there, Darby forgets about it.<br />A week later, Darby and Callahan go out to dinner, and Callahan becomes drunk. Darby refuses to ride home with him, which means that she sees Callahan's car explode. Callahan is dead-and she was supposed to be with him. Suddenly, it appears to Darby that her brief was right on target. I'll let your imagination take it from there.<br />So, what'd I think of it? <br />Why didI like this one? First of all, It is a mystery involving death. That always means a few points on the scorecard. Second, enough details were given that I could follow each of the main characters' trains of thought. Third, I liked the inclusion of the newspaper reporter (didn't mention that, did I?) once Darby's other sources are, um, no longer available. I learned a lot about the process of law through Grisham's books, and in this one, I got to learn some about the process of news writing in this book as well.<BR> <BR>So should someone read it?<br />Sure, why not? Seriously, if you're into lawyer stories or stories of bringing down the bad guy, it's a fun book. It's also a decently simple read. The pages go quickly. The Pelican Brief, book and movie, is a fun story that's worth the time invested.
B000001EUR|4.0|This Album contains two of my favorites from the &quot;latter era&quot;, <BR>Rock You Like A Hurricane and Still Lovin You.  I think I like Blackout a bit better, but Scorpions fans will not go wrong with this Cd.   I'm seeing them in concert this summer and am eagerly awaiting it.   I can't think of a better song to kick it off with than Hurricane.      Overall a great rockin album with a real top ballad too.
B000001FOS|4.0|This album from egoist shredder Yngwie is usually pinpointed as his \\"aor\\" downfall. However I would have to disagree. Compared to the album following this (Eclipse), the aor/hair metal elements are confined to mainly Joe Lynn Turner's lyrics and some of the vocal melodies. \\"Heaven Tonight\\" has some awesome riffs however cheesy the song is. On Eclipse, alot of the neoclassical elements were gone, and straight up hair metal was the result. On \\"Odyssey\\" even the most \\"hairy\\" of songs had the neoclassical riffs and solos to save them. Besides, who says the aor elements didn't start much earlier (example: \\"On the Run Again\\" from Marching Out\\")? And besides, alot of the more \\"Traditional\\" songs on this album are the best to me since \\"Rising Force\\" (Examples: \\"Krakatu\\", \\"Riot in the Dungeon\\"). Yngwie remains one of my favorite guitarists besides his ... ego and predictable albums.
B00005N9CV|5.0|this is the best album she has recorded to date.  The sweet tunes she sings bring out the best in all of us.
B000063CPL|5.0|Rock in Rio brings us yet another live album from \\"Eddie and the boys\\". I wrote it off at first as another scam for cash like the \\"reissues\\" of \\"reissues\\" that are currently being sold, but then when I gave into temptation and actually bought the album, I was in for a surprise. This is probably the best document of live Maiden with Dickinson, possibly the best live Maiden since the out of print \\"Maiden Japan\\" (which I have on a bonus disk from the Castle reissues a few years back). Bruce really hits most of the high notes this times, and doesn't growl and screech like on LAD. Also, it has more of a live feel, maybe a bit too off the cuff especially when Janick or even Dave sometimes play a solo differently. Either way, I can't reccomend a live album more highly than this.
B00003CXI1|5.0|...<br />Now, the movie was great and it was very close to the book.  Of course in a movie version you have combine some scenes and delete others or ever movie made from a book would be about 8hours long.  If you are a big Harry Potter fan as I am, the book brings to life the characters from the book VERY WELL.<br />Get this DVD, it's a must for your collection
B0000668IF|4.0|Moby is at it again. Seems like his flow of inspiration never stops, does it? The songs aren't any less than previous work he has done.. it's just that i can't help noticing that he's using the same sounds over and over again. If only he could find the time to dial up another string-preset on his synths.. If only some sounds would be used a bit more subtly (those same strings that show up in almost every song he has done for the last few years). A lot of the songs seem to be outtakes from the 'play' album (hey, you can't release another B-sides album, can you? even though one song from 'play the B sides' made it to this latest effort). On the other hand, he did get rid of one preset.. the 'acoustic' piano has been replaced by.. an electric one.. something resembling the famous rhodes piano. Another thing that didn't go unnoticed is the way Moby only seems to be able to change chords on the 1. It happens a lot, anyways, give or take a few exceptions.<br />These technical knibbles aside, there's something about his music that just keeps me hanging on. Despite the simplicity of it all and the limited spectrum of sounds he uses (keeping in mind he's considered to be something of a synth-wizard) a lot of the tunes have a vibe going on that's uniquely Moby...I forgive him his unability to stay in tune when he 'sings', always having a vocoder-backup to at least have something about the vocals that stays in tune.<br />So there, go check out this album yourself if you digged his previous work, but don't expect any groundbreaking inventions musically or soundwise.
006092988X|3.0|i guess it was okay.  it wasn't the best, but it wasn't a waste of time.
B00005RY7X|5.0|Honestly, the first time I heard &quot;Party Hard&quot; I thought it was kind of cheesey and dumb, at leat for the first 20 seconds or so.  But by the end of it my friend and I were jumping around his room.  This album is by far the best music to come out in a long time.  Every single song has more energy then any song I've ever heard before.  And if any of you have only heard &quot;Party Hard&quot; tehn please get this album and listen to the whole thing.  Listening to it all together just makes it a hundred times better.  I urge everyone to go out right now and get this cd and then go look to find out when Andrew WK is playing near youi because you have to go see him in concert.  I can't even describe how amazing it is.
B00005JKL8|5.0|This was a GREAT movie. The filming was awesome. There was a lot of camera tricks that brought more excitment to me movie. The story line was perfect and the acting was unbeatable. Owen Wilson did a great job.
B00005RY7X|4.0|this is a good album i only like a few songs on the cd but there <BR>very good, worth buying the album for. it's rather simple music<BR>some people either REALLY like it or really HATE it, so i suggest<BR>you listen to a few clips. here are some i think are a good example of the album, I GET WET, PARTY HARD, FUN NIGHT, I LOVE NYC, and TAKE IT OFF. Hope you like it!!!
B00005JKCF|5.0|I think Spiderman is the best superhero movie made so far. It has great storyline and the special effects are awesome. Spiderman lived up to his name by being simply amazing. Even the Green Goblin was very amazing with the things that he did. I recommend this movie for anybody who enjoys science fiction action with lots of amazing special effects. I can't wait for the sequal as well as other Marvel superhero movies that will be released in the future.
B00003W8NM|5.0|This movie is just asbsolutely brilliant.  Of course one does wish more of it could be genuinely informative, but that doesn't stop the movie as a whole from being a beautiful work of art.  It's informed by Noir &amp; [eastern] philosophy, &amp; presents itself wonderfully with its own great new vision.  The voiceover allows for communication with the audience &amp; the internal poetry of the movie that otherwise would be awkward or impossible.  The way plot &amp; subplot explain themselves in first &amp; subsequent viewings is impeccable, offering so many different levels of madness.  The DVD itself is generous with extras, too, replete with behind-the-scene vignettes with multiple camera angles, &amp; commentary; out-takes, deleted scenes, storyboards, concept art, etc....
0345350499|5.0|A new twist on the Arthurian legend highlights the important roles played by women. Rather than focusing on King Arthur and Lancelot, Zimmer-Bradley gives a beautifully detailed account of how the clash between God and Goddess is mirrored in the human interaction between Man and Woman. A fabulous, fantastical tale that everyone should place in their bookshelf. Zimmer-Bradley gives Tolkien a run for his money in terms of creativity and detail in this coherent, adventuresome tale of the legend of Camelot. Sorceress and priest, man and woman, God and Goddess...this book is a fabulous example of how the world - even in fairytales - is rarely an arena of black and white.
B000001EGE|5.0|One of the true classics of Elton's prolific early period and one of the greatest piano records in all of Pop, HONKY CHATEAU has stood the test of time, remaining fresh and less dated than many of its contemporaries.<br />Except for \\"Mellow.\\" Yech.<br />But the high points of this CD are many: \\"Honky Cat,\\" \\"Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters,\\" the always fantastic \\"Rocket Man,\\" and the overlooked \\"Hercules,\\" which really would have fit in better on DON'T SHOOT ME I'M ONLY THE PIANO PLAYER.<br />At this point in his career Elton could have had hits (and good ones at that) if he'd been singing the phone book. Luckily for us Bernie Taupin was writing great lyrics. Taupin gets the occasional jab from rock critics; I couldn't disagree with them more. Taupin knew how to touch people (people my age anyway) with a few carefully chosen phrases. Did he spell it out like Lennon or Townshend? No. Did he know how to speak to his audience? Obviously, yes.<br />A great LP.
B000002J1S|5.0|In the CD era, Lamb would have fit perfectly within 75 minutes if several musical tracks were deleted or pared down.  These tracks are essentially mood music that supposedly are set ups for the next track (Peter Gabriel's written narrative explains the purpose for these tracks), but often they go on too long or are unnecessary, in my opinion.  &quot;The Waiting Room&quot;, for example, consists of the sound of breaking glass and some supposedly eerie music thereafter.  I can name others, but these time fillers were necessary back in 1974 in order to justify a double album.<br />Yet, there is no denying that once this issue is dealt with, what is left is a collection of tracks that may be the best the classic lineup produced.  Peter Gabriel's singing is at its best, and his tendency to do &quot;cute&quot; voicings for characters is at a minimum here.  The major improvement on this album is Tony Banks' successful integration of the synthesizer as a lead instrument.  On &quot;Selling England By the Pound,&quot; Banks seemed to do too much &quot;noodling&quot; on the newfangled machine.  Here, the synth leads are powerful, sinewy, and exhilirating in combining speed and melody.  On more delicate songs (&quot;The Lamia&quot;) the synth playing is supple as well.  All other personnel do their usual excellent job.  Surprisingly, even though there is a narrative tying together the songs, evaluating the songs one by one this album stands up to any other Genesis album.  The introduction of Rael (an anagram for &quot;real&quot;) to the the &quot;unreal&quot; (the realm of mystery) is quite compelling, reminding me of experiences of Christian mystics (note the use of the &quot;lamb&quot; and the lyrics from &quot;The Carpet Crawlers&quot;).  So how can I take away a star for a trifle such as extra music?
B00005JKCF|4.0|Did the film versions of \\"Superman\\" and \\"Batman\\" successfully capture the quintessence of their respective heroes? Yes, they did. Does this movie? You bet it does! Many times during this film I sat there and quietly nodded: \\"They got it right.\\"<br />After reading the reviews I was afraid the film was perhaps not the equal of the trailer; it is. Only someone as staid as the movie critic (most of them) would not be enormously pleased with this production.<br />The story is told flawlessly and dramatically. The effects are very good indeed. One critic complained that Spiderman looks like a character in a video game jumping around; he doesn't. Many of the scenes are quite breath-taking.<br />The actors keep pace, never dropping the ball.<br />Forget \\"Star Wars\\" -- see this movie instead. It won't disappoint. Four and a half stars, to be exact.
0375751513|5.0|I never would have thought this interesting combination of Marlowe, Shakespeare, and Dickens possible. For those of you who follow my writing, you know that I really liked Mr. Wilde's \\"Importance of Being Earnest.\\" And his \\"Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is enough to put him right up there with Mr. Marlowe, Mr. Shakespeare, and Mr. Dickens. Like any good tale of terror, the story starts normal and plausible. We only get to know Sybil for a short while, but she delivers a very touching passage on her love for Dorian which prepares her very sympathetic character. Her brother is prepared early and resurfaces with good timing. Basil is well drawn as the artist who has an interesting fascination with Dorian. We only see Alan Campbell briefly, but we are permitted to feel some sympathy for him when he is forced into a criminal act and finds himself overcome with anxiety. Harry is a well drawn character who not only provides comical touches, but jokes (unknowingly) about many dark thoughts that are undoubtedly revolving in Dorian's mind. And Dorian? What a wonderful creation! First we get to see him as a normal person. Soon afterwards, we see his dark desires. We see him fall in love, and then we see his love turn to abuse. But even as we see his character descend into evil, Wilde never quite permits us to forget that he is human. This is especially prevalent when he longs for his childhood innocence. Wilde masterfully builds tension when Dorian's unchanged face starts to raise questions. And as if this were not enough, Wilde allows Dorian's reputation to degenerate with his character. What's left? Only beautiful and excellent wording, magnificent suspense, terrifying moments, dramatic irony, some well placed comical touches, etc, etc, etc. This is a phenomenal book that offers an interesting combination of Marlowe's techniques (showing pacts with evil), Shakespeare's techniques (articulate wording and passages), and Dickens' techniques. (Fierce humor side by side with pure terror.) DO NOT let this phenomenal masterpiece get away!r.) DO NOT let this phenomenal masterpiece get away!
B00004VXF2|1.0|I'd be willing to bet a bundle that the vast majority of the folks who are giving this thing 5 stars probably don't even own a copy, and the few who do never actually listen to it. After all, it is nothing but unlistenable noise, a review that The Trouser Press Record Guide refers to as &quot;a description, not a value judgment.&quot;<br />Whether Mr. reed meant this as a joke on the artsy-fartsy crowd, or simply as a way out of his contract isn't known, but it is quite safe to say that he did not mean it as any kind of artistic statement because it clearly isn't one. Unlike say, The Shaggs, who had an innocence and sincerity to their work, this is nothing but cynical manipulation, and that should not be rewarded.
B00003CX5P|2.0|is not Jar-Jar, though he is to movie making what a cold sore on your lip would be to your first date.  It is not the dismal acting of youg Anakin.  (I don't cut him any slack for his age.  If you want to see good kid acting in a sci-fi flick, check out ET)It's the music.  No, seriously, the music.  Don't believe me?  Go check out Star Wars.  Review the scene where Luke is being chased by Darth Vader.  Then go to Return of the Jedi.  Go to the forest chase scene.  Finally go to Phantom Menace.  Go to the pod race.  Notice anything missing?  In the other two movies, the music heightened the dramatic tension of the scene.  In the pod race, it doesn't.  Why?  BECAUSE THERE ISN'T ANY MUSIC!!  When I sat through this in the theater, I wanted to walk out, but decided to stay to read the credits just so I could see what incompetent they picked to work with John Williams score.  Surprise!  It was John Williams.  How could Williams and Lucas work on movies for over a quarter of a century and do such an amateurish job?  If only Lucas would worry about film-making more, and merchandising less.  I mean, come on, a movie this shoddy almost makes you wonder who was really in charge of making those first three movies all those years ago...
B0000668IF|5.0|Another flow of light moods that caryy a hip and fun vibe. Great party background music. An album that grows on you over time into another classic. Top notch production and arrangement that take you someplace new which is the music's draw and Moby's strength. Moby is original. Different yet similar to Play. Add it to your collection and you will be succesful...
6305075379|4.0|When I first saw Mad Max in the cinema's 20 years ago as a younger guy I was so impressed by the raw-ness of the film.<BR>The DVD I have has heightend this,particulaly in widescreen.<BR>Mel Gibson likened the character of Max to that of a card-board cut-out. I never looked at Mad Max like that. What i saw was a guy who was desperatly hanging onto the shreds of civility in a society that was becoming debased and uncivilised (one could liken it to living in Germany before the holocaust and coming out the other end) where security was insecure. Even Max wanted to quit Main Force Patrol because he likend himself to that of the gangs, where it was becoming increasingly impossible to distinquish between that which was good or bad. After Jim Goose and Max's family have perished you see a side to him that many of us can relate to - vengence. When he confronts the murderers in the closing scenes it is not with joy that retribution is extracted but with a righteous anger against that which is evil. All in all Mad Max is the original. The Road Warrior and Beyond (eek !!) Thunderdoom become over-shadowed by the fact that Mad Max leaves them for dead in the smoke from His Interceptor.
B00005QG9J|5.0|I wasn't sure how much I would like this CD when I bought it, and even the first time I listened to it all the way through.  Now, I know.  It is one of, if not the best, CD's I've ever bought.  The lyrics are very well written, the music is awesome and often ingenuitive.  It's a very creative, melodic CD.  There's really something for every mood; a little rock, a little ballad, and always something thought-provoking.  With songs like &quot;Warning&quot; and &quot;Blood on the Ground&quot; to get your blood pumping, and &quot;11 am&quot; and &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; to mellow you out, it's perfect.   It's an amazing CD.  I highly recommend it.

0525946284|4.0|and succeeds.  Follett recaptures the spirit and willingness to take risks of the British, American, and French Resistance spies and soldiers during WWII.  In Flick, a female British spy, we find a careful woman who courts danger.  Married to Michel, of the French Resistance, Flick has been drawn into espionage by her love, but is practical enough to realize that Michel has feet of clay in the relationship department.<br />Follett's story tells of Flick's determination to lead a female group of spies on a critical mission in the days before the invasion.  They must take out a critical German post, and Flick is forced to use amateurs on her most important mission.  Follett<br />builds the suspense to its most critical in telling the tale, and does not spare romance or sadness in its conclusion.<br />Although Follett is fairly predictable in his writing, and his telling is straight-forward, without many interesting sidelines, the story is enjoyable and well told.
B00005JKYS|5.0|This is the best war movie I have seen.  It was easy to identify with the soldiers, their families, the enemy and their families.  This excellent film helps us to see the Vietnamese as human beings and our soldiers as men of valor and courage.  This is the first honest look at the Vietnam War and its impact on the people who fought it.<br />Thanks to Randall Wallace, Mel Gibson, Sam Elliott and all of the brave men of the Army Calvary who were a part of this battle and film
0345448898|2.0|The first book was great.  The phsycology behind the children specialy Lira was well develop. I totaly loved the talking polar bears and the shape shiftting companions daemons. It was very imaginative.  When I started reading the second book I tought it was going to be as good as the first, mistake from my part.  The second book left in a tangent and a book I originaly tought it will be great for kids became a scientific flop, with ideas that for my opinion are to abstract for a child of any age could possibly understand.  As my frustration went on, the third book got worst.  The children all of a suden started acting like adults I could not pinpoint the ages of Lira and Will.  They were acting like 30 year olds instead of pre-teens. It was like reading something writen at the last minute.  Every book I buy my nices and nephews, I have to read first, and I will not let them read this set until they are in college and have some undertanding of particle physics, energy, chemistry, and some theology classes because I do not want them thinking this have any bearing besides being a fictional piece of work.
6300216268|5.0|Harold and Maude is neither the cinema's greatest movie, nor is it the worst. Instead, it is a highly original, quirky black comedy that combines inventive characters  with a devastating attack on the pillars of America's Establishment. It's no accident that Harold comes from a conformist upper-class family, over which mom presides lavishly, but like a petty demeaning tyrant. Nor is it happenstance that Maude's origins lie outside a youthful US, in an older, more experienced Europe devastated by the death-dealing Holocaust of which she is a survivor. Hers is understood as a life-affirming perspective that has been earned, and stands as the perfect antidote to the zombified Harold, whose soul has shriveled in the midst of repressive norms and repressed instincts. Probably no movie from that rebellious era captures the counter-culture's positive image of itself better than this one. Nor are the forces in conflict more sharply and humorously drawn than the encounters with organized religion, psychiatry, the military, and other of America's domineering institutions. Even at age 80, Maude represents the pure flower child riposte, showing that age is no barrier to affirmative values, while Harold overcomes alienation by at last responding to enlivening people rather than deadening duties. In capsule, we have both the class origin and universal ambitions of that insurgent period, when suburban white kids sought to lead a global parade that would break the shackles that bind us. H&M celebrates that spirit, and while I grow a bit weary of Ruth Gordon's unrelenting girlishness and Harold's hollow-eyed deadpan, they do remain unique and compelling figures. As does the movie, even 30 years later.

B000002KCC|4.0|Hearing this record for the first time was one of the scariest and strangely moving experiences of my life. Hearing Neil positively moan out the straight-narrative vocals of the opening title track - as if each word sung is causing him physical pain - gives one a glimpse of what it must feel like to hear a man sing from the other side of the grave. The history of this album is well-documented: it was written and recorded in 1973 after the heroin-related deaths of two of Neil's associates, guitarist Danny Whitten and roadie Bruce Berry. As on the more recent Sleeps With Angels - where Young deals directly with Kurt Cobain's suicide - Neil tackles his subject matter head on here, in a surprising, shocking, almost nearly disturbing way. One hears of turning grief into art - art as therapy - well, there are few finer examples of it in all of music than here. Neil directly unloads his grief and sorrow and mixed up and confused feelings into his music. The title track is a direct narrative about Berry &quot;Bruce Berry was a working man/He used to load that Econoline van&quot; and sets the course for the rest of the album's songs - dark, introspective, direct, brooding, and ragged. The lyrics and music supporting them have a generally dark vibe throughout; absolutely hopeless tunes such as Borrowed Tune (&quot;I'm clmbin' this ladder/My head in the clouds/I hope that it matters/I'm havin' my doubts&quot;) abound. The lone upbeat, more harmonius song here - a live Come On, Baby, Let's Go Downtown with vocals from Whitten - sticks out like a sore thumb amongst this musical graveyard of heartbreak and pain. Other songs seems to tackle the subject almost directly - such as Tired Eyes (&quot;He tried to do his best/But he could not&quot;), even reflecting Neil's own situation, of which he admits, in Borrowed Tune &quot;I'm singin' this borrowed tune/I took from the Rolling Stones/Alone in this empty room/Too wasted to write my own.&quot; The performances are extremely raw andobviously not intended to be polished or kept up. They are all undoubtedly first takes - you can hear instruments that are out of tune, notes that are out of place, even the musicians speaking back and forth to one another (not to mention a static hum.) Clearly, this album was not made for fun. It was made out of necessity. Such is the essence of true art.
B00005YU1O|5.0|It's not very often that I'm impressed with our entertainment industry.  I was impressed with The Matrix for it's breakthrough effects, I was blind-sided by The Sixth Sense because I actually did not know Bruce Willis was dead and I really enjoyed myself with American Beauty because it helped me to see our society in a new light.  That being said, I did not, think that I'd be impressed with Richard Linklater's new animated film, Waking Life.  Much to my surprise I found myself immediately ordering the DVD and repeatedly forcing it upon each friend who walked through my door.  Each time I've found catching new and unusual special effects and human insights every time.  It was original, beautiful and bursting with life.  A+

B00005N9CV|1.0|This is an amendment to my earlier review which I wrote after an inital listen last fall. My first impression was that this was a nice departure for her, but since then I've probably listened to this CD at most  four times. I think it boils down to one thing. BORING! I still and always listen to all her previous CDs, but this one has become lost in the pile, it's pure and utter muzak. A better title would be &quot;The Monotone of Love&quot;. I know this isn't a very useful review for people interested in purchasing this disc, but I just had to post a new review to reflect my awakening. Boy, do I feel better!
B000002O51|4.0|This album came out when I was in college.  In my world, it accompanied many a study, girl-talk, and make-out session.  Back then I pretty much listened only to top 40 radio and didn't get too much into exploring music.  <br />Fast-foward to today.  My taste in music has expanded dramatically and I guess you could call me a &quot;student&quot; of many different genres.  Still, on a whim, I recently decided to replace my decaying cassette copies of Boston, Don't Look Back, and Third Stage.  To my surprise, redisovering this album has been a real pleasure.  It swept me up and took me right along to that blissed-out world of tight harmonies and those unmistakable, rolling bass sounds of Boston.  (I know, it's a different musician in Third Stage, but the sound is the same.)  The other Boston albums are incredible, as the world knows, but I believe there's something really special about Third Stage.<br />&quot;I still hear guitars in the air as we sat in the sand...&quot;  Man!  This disc is just pure, powerful rock fun.  Don't think about it too much; just enjoy it.

B00000AFFI|3.0|&quot;To bring you my love&quot; is one of my favorite albums ever, as it is one of the most heart-wrenching emotional albums to come out of the 90's, if not of all time.  But that album was a hard album to follow, so we have this album, &quot;Is this desire?&quot;.  It appeals to a broader audience, as it has more radio friendly singles (e.g. perfect day elise, etc)... this album it seems as if she has found some spiritual comforting or something, as this is the bridge album between her old raw style from dry, rid of me, and TBYML, and to the new PJ harvey on &quot;stories from the city, stories from the sea&quot;.  many claim this album to be her strongest of all, but i disagree.  it has a couple songs to get you hooked, but the album is alot more bland than the other albums and doesnt show near as much raw emotion or creativity though.  she experiments a little with some electronic sounds, but thast about it. but everything PJ touches turns to gold, so you cant go wrong with anything.  and its a great album for starters, if TBYML is a little too intense for you right now.  im glad she has found some comforting, but it just doesnt caputer the magic that her previous albums did. it took me awhile longer to get into this album, just because its a little more bland than her other works.
B00003CX5P|4.0|Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace may very well have been the most anticipated movie of all time. Since it was first announced many years ago, people (myself include) were eagerly waiting with baited breath, saving up their cash for those tickets, and getting their tents cleaned up for an overnight stay at the movie theater just to see the first prequel to George Lucas' seminal Star Wars trilogy. So it is only natural that some were a little disappointed walking out of the theater. <BR>Well, as possibly a rare voice in the pool of criticism, I will state that Episode 1 is a solid attempt at explaining how the whole Star Wars saga &quot;began&quot; (in storyline of course).<br />The first thing you will probably notice when seeing Episode 1 is that it &quot;feels&quot; a lot different from previous Star Wars films. The primitive picture quality of the (non-remastered) original trilogy is missing here, as are many of the original characters (namely Han, Luke, Leia, and Lando) we all grew to know and love. Most importantly, however, the fact that this is a prequel to a trilogy that ended 19 YEARS AGO takes away much of the film's potential nostalgia (considering the long way film and computer technology has come since 1983's Return Of The Jedi).<br />Even if you haven't seen Episode 1 just yet, you probably know the plot revolves around young Anakin Skywalker (soon to be Darth Vader), and his upcoming quest to become a Jedi Knight. George Lucas had quite a task on his hands explaining how the Rebel Alliance, the Empire, etc. came to be. And Episode 1 does a fairly good job explaining some of the initial details. Darth Vader is of course still Anakin Skywalker, Obi-Wan is a very young man attempting to train Anakin as a Jedi knight (his big mistake), and Senator Palpatine (soon to be Emperor Palpatine, or just &quot;The Emperor&quot; for those that haven't read the Star Wars books) is blatantly hiding his true colors in a sea of kindness/dignity. <br />Unfortunately, the plot itself could have used a few tweaks. The movie's opening, for example, is very vague and does a poor job explaining what's actually going on. As could the acting crew. Jar Jar Binks I probably don't need to go into too much detail with, but Jake Lloyd's performance as Anaken Skywalker was IMO just about as annoying. It's obvious the young actor was very excited about being part of the new Star Wars films. So at times he seems quite a bit more excited than he needs to be. On the bright side, both the pod-racing sequence and the battle with Darth Maul were very well done.<br />Overall, Star Wars Episode 1 is one of those movies that will probably grow on you once the entire Star Wars prequel trilogy is complete. Everything will finally tie in with the original trilogy, and the prequels (including Episode 1) will make more sense. As it is, I recommend everybody gives this movie a chance. With a little patience and an open mind, you may actually like it.

1568495110|4.0|Anthony Burgess takes us on a roller-coaster ride through our young narrator Alex's life. Alex goes around raping, stealing, and even murdering in this novel based in the future. He is later caught and taken to jail for the murder of a old woman. After being put in jail Alex is used as a guinea pig in a new controversial experiment. The experiment is supposed to make the criminal forget all their criminal tendencies and turn them into a peaceful citizen. Alex thinks this will be his way to escape from prison but in the end it turns Alex's world into an even bigger nightmare.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone looking for an easy read, a book that will keep your attention, and keep you turning pages. There are only two down falls to the book and they are the use of \\"slang\\" by the characters when talking in the book and some of the gory details used to describe situations that occur in the book.

B00005OWEG|3.0|First off, yes the original is probably my favorite movie.  But for one, this dvd is very poor quality.  No real additional features.<br />I thought the original was a long movie....but now that i've seen redux i have a profound respect for the editor of the original.  The scenes in this new version were cut for a reason.  Some of them are good yeah, but they're not spectacular.  The scene where sheen helps steal a surfboard, and then later killgore flys around in his copter demanding it back over the loudspeaker is just sort of well....silly.  And lets face it, this is hardly a silly movie.  <br />The scene where they meet up with the bunnies just dosnt make any sense to me....i've watched it several times and i have no clue what sort of message they're trying to get through; wonderful acting though.<br />The added scene with the french plantation is purley about politics.  I could barely pay attention; i thought it was a well established idea in the film that we had no business being in vietnam.  In this scene they go through in great detail all the reasons why we shouldnt be there.  Who cares?  This isnt a movie about politics, its THE movie about war.<br />And probably the most anticipated new scene is one with Brando.  He simply reads a time magazine article bluntly.  Its not a bad scene...but a far cry from the amazing performance in the original.  I would of bought if it was in the original because in this scene he's quite matter-of-fact instead of his usually thoughtfull vagueness.  It does a nice job of showing how his moods change is all.  But the thing is, it does show Brando's entire body.  I feel embarrased to say but i could see his \\"man breasts\\"  even through his loose fitting robes.  I'm sure this was the reason it was cut out in the first place.<br />But all in all, the new scenes are neat to watch, but come nowhere near to the original version.  They add a lot of confusion on just who wilard is.  In the original he was just about the only characterthat was well established:  you knew exacly who he was and what he wanted to do.  In this version....he does these random things that seem totally out of character.
B00005JKQX|4.0|Writing a biography is always a tricky thing, causing debates over accuracy.  When some say this guy is a genius, others say he's just a lucky fellow.  And if the person in point is still alive, the case gets more complicated.  So, script writer Akiva Goldsman did something very unique in creating lifestory of John Nash, Nobel-Prize winning mathematician.  <br />Russel Crowe plays this real-life Princeton professor John Nash, whose gifted \\"beautiful mind\\" leads his heart to the places where no ordinary persons can imagine to go.  Full of youth, confidence, and a little bit of arrogance, John is finally recruited by America's prestigeous institute, after writing a paper that later greatly influence the theories in economics and other academic fields.   Soon he finds his love in one of his students, and his life seems going smoothly until one gentleman came to him, asking to crack the secret codes from Russia.<br />First, don't try to find anything authentic about Mr. Nashs life; the film is as real as those secret organizations depicted in 007 series.  The director Ron Howard and the writer Goldsman shows the \\"essence\\" of his suffering from schizophonia, which is to stay with John Nash from his youth until his age got advanced much later.  Here's the trick of the film (you must see it for yourself), which may leave some viewers embarrassed.  I know some critics who in effect claimed, with some justfication, that this film doesn't pay enough respect to patients of this disease, and I am not perfectly sure how to refute these detractors' claims.<br />The film has, let me assure you, been endowed with power coming from the leading actor Crowe, whose utter failure of \\"Proof of Life\\" should be now forgiven and forgotten.  Nash's delicate sensibility is expressed with his gifted performance, and very subtle nuance is conveyed with well-timed lines that suggest his fragile inner feelings (see, for instance, when he is beaten by one of his friends over the GO game, how he mutters with hurt pride: \\"This games is flawed.\\")  But it is not fair if he takes all the credits; look the superb job of his special make-up done by wizard Greg Cannom, whose previous work includes \\"Mrs. Doubtfire\\" and many, many others.  Remember his name, too.<br />The film ends, I am afraid, not with traditional happy-ending catharsis.  After so long painful years, he is given a Nobel Prize for what he had done long time ago, of which existence, most incredibly, he totally had forgotten.  It looks like a birthday present delivered too late, and you should be reminded one small fact of life: youth is easily lost when you really need it.          <br />Finally, if you ask me this film deserves Oscar, I would answer, considering the line-ups of other contenders of the year 2002, \\"Yes.\\"  But it is also true (and I hope you think the same way) Ron Howard made better films in the past.  If he is given Oscar, he should have been given one for \\"Cocoon\\" or \\"Apollo 13.\\"
0790729628|2.0|Am I the only one who prefers the original version? Harrison Ford's voiceover added to the film's noir feel, and filled in a few background details that made the story more understandable. Perhaps creative folk are loath to admit that studio execs are sometimes right, even if it's for the wrong reasons. In addition, I LIKE happy endings, and so do most people, which is why moviemakers do them so much.
B00000I4XR|5.0|...This is a classic!  This is the best movie ever made?  How are you going to let marine biology interfere with that!?!?!?!?!?!?!<br />Okay.  I'm calm now.  Okay, I'll just admit it.  I love sharks.  I think that they are the most beautiful animals on the planet.  And it digusts me that people kill them for sport, or for that matter, any reason at all.  In fact, when I was three years old, I used to watch Jaws, and cry when the shark got blown up at the end!  But, lets survey the facts here...<br />Jaws was made at a time when, obviously, the fear of sharks was present.  And, Jaws struck fear into the hearts of all beach goers.  The great white is not a creature hungry for human flesh, as slightly depicted in the movie (they never actually state that its after humans), and the great white does not deserve to be given that reputation.  But, take a look at movies like Shark Attack 2 and Jaws IV (no, Spielberg did not direct that).  Those movies are a disgrace not only to film, but to sharks!  Jaws is a great movie!  And you people say that it made sharks hated.  It was such a success, that in the later movies, bad as they were, people were rooting for the shark!  Yes, you heard it right, the SHARK!  Need me to spell it out for you...S...H...A...R...K.<br />Jaws was the best thing to ever come out of Hollywood.  It is the greatest movie of all time.  Buy it, DVD of VHS.  You'll see.  It truely is the greatest movie of all time.  And, if you still think that this movie makes sharks look bad, I don't think a bigger boat is what you need...something like, a bigger BRAIN!!!!
0553213105|2.0|Pride and Prejudice is a classic, early 19th century novel about love and everything that gets in the way of it. Jane Austen uses impeccable, meticulous language full of long descriptions and explanations to give the reader insight into the minds of all the characters. The character development indicates the author's striking understanding of human nature and acute observation of human tendencies. The story provides an intricate plot involving the intertwining lives and feelings of a few characters and is based more on character development than on actual events. Although the book is complex and somewhat wordy, it is interesting and not all that difficult to read. The story shows how individual tendencies and personalities can get in the way of love and happiness. It also adeptly portrays inter-family relationships and the profound impact they can have. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in classic fiction, or who enjoys stories about people and their relationships with one another.
B00000J6AG|4.0|The first song I ever heard of Moby was his techno remix of James Bond.  Since then I've been hooked on his music, and he certainly doesn't disapoint on this great album.  One thing that Moby has, is a unique sound.  He will never sound old, or his style of music will never be used by others, because no one could copy Moby.  It isn't Rock, nor techno.  it's something in between  On this album, all the songs are strong, but in particular I think the song &quot;why does my heart feel so bad&quot; is the best.  It pours out the most emotion without a doubt.  It was used in the trailers of Black Hawk Down, and was used perfectly.  Overall, if you are a fan of Moby, Buy this album!!
B00003CY0V|4.0|For [price] you get to see Topless Halle Berry (She look sooooo sexy!!!). I don't care what everyone thinks. She looks really good and the movie is worth watching.
B00005V0X5|5.0|Megadeth's 1985 debut is one of a handful of albums that can really be considered to have changed the face of thrash metal. It's also a furious piece of technically-inclined speed metal that makes their last few albums sound like Barry Manilow. (Well, maybe that's an exaggeration). This remaster was just about due. Production was always a problem with this album, and the remix is a big help. Everything sounds better, particularly the guitar sound which is fuller and louder, and the vocals which are cleaned up so you can actually tell what some of the lyrics are. My first impression on hearing it was that this is how it was *meant* to sound. This edition also resurrects their long-deleted cover of 'These Boots Are Made For Walking', albeit with all the questionable language bleeped out, which could be hilarious or horrible depending on your viewpoint (I think it's hilarious). There are three early demos which, while poor quality, are interesting to hear. Lastly, they've included expanded liner notes with commentary by Dave and Dave (Mustaine and Ellefson) and a short essay by Scott Ian of Anthrax. In other words, this ambitious package is well worth it. Turn it up ...
B00005RY7X|5.0|this album feels like a tonne of bricks smashing into your face repeatedly and the only way to describe it is as feeling absolutely fantastic. when u come out the other side of andrew's album, u will feel absolutely exhausted from the partying uve just had.! (the slammers rule!!!!)
B00003CXTG|5.0|This was a great movie! I loved it! Dont listen to all the critics out there cuz they dont no a good movie when they see one. The soundtrack was excellent especially the song &quot;There You'll Be&quot; by Faith Hill. If u like action/romance/history i highly recommend this movie. It also helps that Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett are two hotties! just make sure that u have tissues nearby if u r emotional during movies. OO The Sadness!

B000000WJ2|5.0|For the earlier writer, 999 is the code number for pharmeceutical heroin. That should shed some light on the &quot;Don't Panic!&quot; line in the middle of the song.<BR>And one more thing; DOES ANYONE KNOW WHEN KEITH IS GONNA MAKE A NEW ALBUM!?!?!?!?!
B00001QEBQ|4.0|The newest Disney Animation studio in Florida just opened, and this was their first film to animate. Maybe that is why the movie has a fresh look that's a departure from Disney! <br />A new studio animation division called for new animators and directors, who were new enough not to fall into the cookie-cutter plots and themes we have seen in recent Disney films. Although it didn't garnish as much recognition as Beauty and the Beast or Aladdin, Mulan is just as entertaining, witty, dramatic and FUNNY. The humor works, not really because Eddie Murphy has a prominent role in this movie, but because the jokes originate out of the plot and the theme- the dragon Mushu is not just there to crack jokes! You will not be taken aback by the portrayal of Chinese people or their history (although the Huns never really attacked China, but no matter) and they do NOT mimick the anime style.<br />The theme, by the way, is honor, standing up for yourself, and keeping with those you love to the fullest extent! Oh yeah, and cross-dressing! Not a first for Disney, they have done it before, but this is the first animated film where cross-dressing is the major target for humor. It treats the suggestive theme very gently so no one will be offended (and we never do see anything!) while at the same time takes it to such outrageous heights that you can't help but accept it.<br />Visually, the animation is top-notch. The art is inspired by Chinese brushstrokes and beautiul subdued color palettes. <br />As for the songs, there are four here, none that are Oscar-worthy, but okay to listen to. The best song could be \\"Be A Man\\", sung during the booth camp scenes.<br />I would not make too big a deal on the bonus material, however. They really only consist of one trailer and two music videos, all with bad reception.<br />A landmark achievement for Disney in portraying a herione who, for once, is not helpless!
B00005QZ7U|5.0|AWESOME MOVIE! NICOLE CAN SING-GREAT VOICE! EWAN MCGREGOR IS JUST HOT!
0767800958|1.0|Truly awful movie. I went to see it with a bunch of friends and we burst into hysterical laughter the moment we stepped out of the cinema. This pretentious one-woman ego fest was hard to swallow - Sally Porter acts, directs, dances and even sings, and does not improve the odds of making a good movie one bit by covering all fields possible. If she could play the cello she probably would have (thankfully Yo-yo Ma does the job beautifully). Strangely enough, the wanton lack of talent/ability did not prevent her from attempting any of the above. A painful experience. Attempt watching it only with your mother-in-law or bank manager, the world has enough suffering as it is.

B0000508U6|4.0|Everything From \\"Don't Panic\\" to \\"Parachutes\\" is great music, but the last three songs don't even hold a candle to all the previous songs.  The album only has 10 tracks, and only 7 of them are good, so you have to decide if it's worth your money.  Overall, the band has alot of potential, and I look forward to their next release.  Hopefully their new songs will be like the first 7 on this album
B00005RY7X|5.0|From thrashing them around so much!  It is the happiest, headbanginest, funnest album i have heard in years, kind of a super-positive hyper-charged Ramones/Meatloaf hybrid, but better than that sounds.   IF you like feeling good and being happy and ROCK AND F'N ROLL, then this is perfect...yes it is pop as hell, but that only means that there is no reason that everybody in the world shouldn't love Andrew W. K....don't stop living in the red, man...
B00004XQ83|5.0|I just love this sound track.  This album gracefuly brings back the music of the first half of twentieth century.  Although the focus is on bluegrass, it also has some early blues and several spiritual classics. A must have for bluegrass fans around the world, even if you didn't like the movie.
B00000I0XW|5.0|No one sings Andrew Lloyd Webber's music better than Sarah Brightman.  This album demonstrates both of these wonderful<br />talents.<br />Buy it!
B00005NSWI|5.0|If you are a lover of the double bass, jazz or othewise, there are not many CDs you will find that are more fun than this one.  It must have been a hoot to be in the audience at these shows - they invite audience participation and the audience is only too happy to oblige.<br />Tracks such as Get Happy, Papa Was a Rolling Stone, and Taco and a Pork Chop are more fun than bass players should be allowed to have.  Summertime, My Funny Valentine, and I Loves You, Porgy show that these guys are no musical lightweights.  Beautiful playing throughout.  Arrangements are very good.<br />Turn on your subwoofer, crank up the volume, sit back, and get ready to annoy the neighbors.  You will find yourself coming back to this disc over and over again.
B00005JKJA|1.0|Choppy, confusing, exposition problems, and unexplained plot turns.  I hope that whoever funded this movie got what they wanted, since I don't think that any member of the viewing public will.  I don't think that I've ever seen such a waste of celluloid. I totally agree with reviewer above who states that this is just a self-indulgent mess on the part of Lynch.  Don't walk, run from this DVD!
0446608955|5.0|In \\"A Walk to Remember\\" Nicholas Sparks really tugs at the feelings in his reader's hearts. I think that this book really touches most of the emotions in a person. On the first day of drama class Landon Carter sees the unpopular Jamie Sullivan. She's the preacher's daughter. She is conservative, and has a giving heart considering all her work with orphans. At lunch she reads the Bible while all of Landon's friends make fun of her. So when he was in the town's big Christmas play with Jamie after owing a favor, he was really worried about his reputation as Mr. Cool. So when the play is done the last thing he expects is to realize that Jamie has captured his heart. Jamie gets Landon to do things that stretch far beyond his regular limits. This is what really shows Landon who Jamie is, and not what everyone thinks she's like. Landon also shows Jamie what his world is like. He lives in a very big house, which she admires, and all the fancy dinners really maker her feel special.  Despite Reverend Sullivan's objections, their relationship grows and Landon's feelings do too, so when Jamie reveals what her future holds, his whole world turns upside down. Despite all the nagging he gets from friends Landon realizes that there are more things to life than the small problems and being cool. Sparks does a great job of breaking the rules of the classic assumptions that jocks don't associate with the \\"goody-two shoes.\\" <BR>There are a few reasons why I really enjoyed this book. One is that it really touched me in a way that few books do. So that is why I think this book is good for people of all ages. Despite the fact that it is fairly easy reading, it has a lesson that we all need to learn and apply to our life. Sure, this book might seem a little sappy, but it really does have something for everybody. For me, every good book connects with you in a way that you can relate to in your life. This is another reason why I enjoyed this book. It connects in many ways, all depending on what kind of person you are. It really appealed to me because I am a high school student so I can relate to the feelings Landon is having. The most important reason I like this book is that it got me excited to read. I couldn't wait to sit down and find out what was going to happen next. The author really developed the characters well so it seemed very real. Their feelings and emotions seemed honest and not out of a fairy tale or something like that. I really would recommend it to anyone who wants to see a story that seems true. This trip back in time is one that nobody should miss.
B00005QIPH|4.0|First of all, the CD sounds like it was recorded on a tape recorder in someone's basement. However, that's all a part of the feel of the CD. The songs are all short and to the point. No drawn out 8 minute ballads here. It has a very British feel, so if you are a fan of bands like Supergrass or Blur, you'd like this CD.
0871137380|5.0|ill start of by saying that this is simply an incredible book which portrays war for what it really is -- brutal and ulgy. war is where people from different nations go to kill each other and destroy the others structures. its all about attempting imposing your will upon the other side. this is what war is all about and this is how it should be portrayed. mr. bowden does an excellent job at creating a vivid account of what happened in 3 october 1993 and this is proven thorough his research and details. if you are interested in infantry combat or forgien policy, i highly recommend this book. be warned though, this book is a very accurate protrayal of modern war and mr. bowden makes no attempt to glorify the material of blackhawk down. it is brutal, violent, and honest. and because of that this is one of my favoriate books period, and it earns every star i gave it, and then some.
B00005RRG9|5.0|I'll leave the critique of this movie to others.  They all say basically the same thing anyhow, &quot;This is a fun movie. Hayley Mills is a doll...&quot;<br />What makes this DVD edition stand out is that it has an entire second disk of extras!  As a person who is interested in documentaries and old film reels I was amazed how Disney made a superb disk of extras.<br />If you are thinking of upgrading your VHS copy to DVD, this is the time to do it.  Disney has made a DVD edition that others should be measured by.<br />It has commentary by the director, Hayley Milles, the making of the movie and profiles the &quot;hidden&quot; twin for Hayley's from behind shots.  If you look at the movie closely, there are a few shots where you can see the the actress full face on.  This alone justified the DVD purchase for me.<br />A fun movie with many fun extras.
B00005JKEC|5.0|What a powerhouse of a movie! I didn't see it until after the academy awards and I had my doubts.The awards are often political or based on past record in addition to present work. Denzel Washington deserved his award and then some. His turnabout from his good guy image was total and chilling.What surprised me was Ethan Hawke's performance! He was fantastic. I really didn't know he had it in him.Washington and Hawke simply couldn't have been better. The movie is rough and thought provoking.Watch it but be prepared to feel the impact.

B000002LCU|5.0|When I heard, back in '87, that George Harrison was releasing a new album, I was skeptical, since the recent track record of ex-Beatles albums were spotty at best. Was in for a surprise when I bought it though! The thing that attracted me about the album (and I think this was largely co-producer Jeff Lynne's doing)was that it sounded both of its time (the late '80s, with all the synthesisers) and of another time (the late '60s). And Harrison had some great songs too. Standouts include \\"Just For Today\\" (I believe Elton John was on piano for that track), a hushed, emotional piece; \\"Someplace Else\\", another emortional piece with powerful slide playing by Harrison \\"This is Love\\", which features more beatiful slide playing by him and expressed the sunnier side of his worldview (for the darker side, tune in to \\"The Devil's Radio\\", a full blooded rocker augumented by Eric Clapton if I'm not mistaken); and \\"The Wreck of Hespherus\\", a rocker on which Harrison cheerfully admits he's getting older but he can still \\"rock as good as Gibralter\\".Why then, one wonders, did he not release any albums after this? We waited so long, George- and now you're gone. Rest in peace.
B00005RY7X|5.0|When I first spotted the cover for I Get Wet, I just knew I had to buy the CD, so I could find out what the blood-covered, long-haired Adonis on the front was all about.<BR>I brought it home, popped it in my CD machine and haven't stopped rocking out since (that was over a month ago now).<BR>I love every track on the album. They inspire me, excite me, fill me with bliss and life. It's so nice to finally see an artist who seems to be genuinely having fun, who really seems to care about making sure we all get to come along on his musical journey. From the way he growls and screams at us to 'Party Till We Puke' to the sexy, honesty of 'She Is Beautiful' the album just doesn't stop and neither does Andrew. Not even after you've turned it off!<BR>I Get Wet is a must have for anyone who just plain loves and appreciates what rock and roll really is. There's no confusing gray matter with Andrew, just pure, honest, gutsy rock and roll!<BR>PARTY HARD!
B00005YXZH|4.0|DO NOT COMPARE WILCO TO ANYONE BUT WILCO. They're not Uncle Tupelo, nor the Jayhawks, or Steve Earle, or Blue Mountain, blah blah. etc. etc. Don't even compare them to themselves. It's all Apples and Oranges. (That's one of the things that make them great.) If you feel compelled to do so, don't buy this. If you feel you are owed a type of &quot;sound&quot; or have particular expectations, do not buy this.<br />If you have an open heart/ear/mind and are willing to approach this CD for what it is (I'm not purporting to know what it is. I'm not sure anyone knows what it is. I'm not sure it IS anything other than GOOD/GREAT sonic vibrations) then by all means BUY THIS. Experience it. Swim in it. Let it soak in and enjoy it for WHAT IT IS. Don't comdemn it for what it isn't.<br />Is it the BEST ALBUM OF THE YEAR? I hope not, but that's not a slight. I really do LIKE/LOVE this CD and it continues to grow on me. Personally Being There was Wilco's watershed and they've been as close to a 'favorite band' as I can have since.  Plenty of people hate(ed)it too. This is no Being There, but I never expected it to be.<br />Maybe after listening to this for a few years I'll wake up after a beautiful dream and YHF will make complete salient sense to me. Or, maybe not. Until then, like a Sam Shepard script, IT JUST IS, and our lives are better for it.
B00005V9HH|5.0|Who is Keyser Soze? The one most suspenseful question in this film. This is probably one of the best films ever with an ending that will leave you breathless. The story is about five criminals , Hockney (Kevin Pollack) , McManus (Stephen Baldwin) , Fenster (Benico Del Toro) , Dean Keaton (Gabriel Bryne) , and Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey) , who are arrested. In prison overnight they decide to commit a crime that will cost most of them their lives. Also starring: Chazz Palminterri , Suzy Amis , Giancarlo Esposito and Dan Hedeya.
B00005RY7X|5.0|Like rock? Buy this album.  Feeling sad and need a pick me up? Buy this album.  Wanna smile and be happy?  Buy this album.  We all know how badly the US rock scene is lately.  Andrew WK is the savior of all that.  He will restore your faith that there is still talent out there and that people remember to have a good time.  Three songs on this album have the word &quot;party&quot; in them and that's just what you will want to do upon listening to this album.  Put this cd in and let the good times roll.  I first heard about Andrew about 6 months before the official release of his album.  A friend and I downloaded a couple of his song, listen to them,  and couldn't stop laughing for about a 1/2 hour.  This is not to say that this music is a joke.  Andrew WK is for real.  Just go see his live show.  It's just the pure fact that this music will put you in a good mood immediately.  You've never heard or seen anything like it.  This music is for everyone.  I'm not big into the &quot;rock&quot; scene.  I like a variety of music.  Anyone can appreciate this.  Just buy it.  You'll soon come to love him like the rest of us do.  Forget the Queen, God save Andrew WK.

B00003CXI1|5.0|I loved all the Harry Potter books, and even though the movie is missing elements in the book, the movie is still one of my all time favorates.
B00005O5JV|5.0|&quot;Legally Blonde&quot; is one of the funniest movies in the world. I'm not blonde naturally (I'm a brunette by nature, but I dyed my hair two summers ago, and now I'm keeping it that color), but I can definitely see where Elle is coming from. This movie is a must-see for anyone, whether you be blonde, brunette, redhead, black-haired or even green-haired. It's definitely on my top ten, maybe even top five!
B00005JKCF|3.0|This movie is very overrated! I didnt really like it!  First of all, if the whole freakin movie wasnt Peter flying around on his little webby web, it would have been better! Every scene was the same, a cityperson gets in trouble, and then, oh no look up, here comes Spideyman on his little webby web and he saves the day for the millionth time!  Second of all, the web looked SO FAKE when he was on it! Only recommended if you are a fan of the cartoon, or the comic books.<BR>**1/2
B000002OX7|5.0|This recording includes the many classics like Baba O Riley, <BR>Won't Get Fooled Again, and Behind Blue Eyes. Who's next are left overs from Pete Townshend's story of Bobby. But,it never materialized and Who's next was born Even after 31 years this album is still powerful and emotional. A classic rock essential!<BR>(John Entwistle  RIP 1944-2002) We will always have your music.
B000002B5L|5.0|Six years after the release of this manifesto, it is still one of my favorite albums!  In their second attempt, they produced an avant garde record that is fresh AND intellectual.  (Who else raps about astronomy, theology, physics?)  The transitions between tracks are very well put together with the occasional interludes that will give you and your friends some inside jokes.  If you're into rap, or like listen to music in general without having to skip every other track, BUY THIS ALBUM!  <br />Favorite tracks are...  Well, all of them!  Don't spend the rest of your time reading reviews, just go out and buy it (Don't download it--you'll get less quality!  Get the original...  I recommend minidisc, as it won't wear out or scratch out!)
B000002OZY|5.0|Tommy Rock's first opera is unique and fascinating. It tells a story <BR>about a deaf,dumb and blind name Tommy . Not only is it fascinating lyrically, it also fascinating soundwise like the  beginning overture which  trumpet playing  as well as John's bass playing  pete Townshend guitar playing, Roger's fine vocals and lets not forget Keith's unique drum playing combines to make a new sound in rock. This is definitely a rock essential.

B00000K19E|4.0|The Matrix is one of the best cyber-punk films out there, hell might even be the best! The action is explosively entertaining, the plot is strong and original and the cast is excellent. Yes the...Dude!!.. himself Keanu Reeves is actually surprisingly great in the lead. He's confused and trying to figure out his role in life and god knows no one can look confused better than Reevs \\"lol\\", so he pulls off the role good. Lawence Fishbourne steals the show as Morphious though as does Hugo Weaving (The Lord of the Rings) as the lead villain Agent Smith. I also think the actor who plays Tank is very good but it's a shame, don't think he's gonna be in the sequels.<br /> Anyway this movie just kicks, I could watch the Kun-fu scenes without ever getting tired of them. The bullet-time effects are truly amazing, it's no wonder films like Charlie's Angels have tryed to rip it off. There's just so much good things I could say about this movie. For an action movie the plot makes you think, it's not another brainless action movie. The dialogue is memborable too, especially most of the lines that come out of Lawence Fishbourne's mouth. The Matrix is a truly amazing ride that's hard to forget. I can't wait for the sequels, bring em' on!!
B000001DYY|4.0|Tears For Fears' third album, Sowing The Seeds was the best album of 1989.  This is Tears For Fears fourth album (released 4 years later).  When I first played this, I was disappointed because it wasn't Sowing the Seeds part II.  So, I didn't play it for  a long time.  I finally pulled it our after years and played it again and was very surprised.  <br />This is really a solo album from Roland Orzabal.  Although Tears For Fears acted like a rock group, it was really a duet of Roland Orzabal and Curt Smith.  Smith was like Garfunkel in Simon and Garfunkel, in that Orzabal did most of the work, and Smith just added the vocals.  In Sewing the Seeds, the group actually expanded to a trio with the addition of Oleta Adams.  But, Smith and Orzabal had the infamous creative differences and Orzabal continued on his own for this album.<br />The songs on this album are very rich and complex.  The music is lush and overlapping.  But it all has a clear, bright sound.  The song writing is very good.<br />It is hard to write what is so good about, so I will mention the minor downsides that prevent this from getting five stars.  There isn't the great variety in styles as in Sowing the Seeds.  After a while one song just blends into the next.  Some of the songs in the middle are too popish, and the repeated choruses  tend to get annoying after a number of listenings.  While Roland Orzabal has a good and unique voice, it is tough for him to carry a whole album by himself.  At times he sounds like he is singing with his mouth full.  There used to be great interplay between Smith and Orzabal on the earlier records.<br />While this is a departure for Tears For Fears, it is still very nice.  Fans of pop music, such as newer Sting material, we really appreciate this and probably prefer it over the older albums.
B000002J23|4.0|I remember before I bought Drama in 1994 on LP, I heard a lot of bad things about the album, mainly because Anderson and Wakeman aren't there, but I have to say I like Drama quite a bit over their largely disasterous previous effort, Tormato. I never thought I had anything good to say of Geoff Downes, because of his involvement in that awful Asia, but on Drama, I much preferred his synth sound over what Wakeman was doing on Tormato. While Wakeman started using rather ugly, plastic-sounding synth sounds by '78, Downes was using great synths like the Mini Moog, Hammond organ, and Solina string synths and it shows on Drama. It's strange to be hearing such synths still being used in 1980, mainly because such keyboards were beginning to lose its popularity by that time (but remember, this was before digital synthesizers, the Yamaha DX-7, the first practical digital synth didn't hit the market until 1983). Trevor Horn might not be Anderson, but that doesn't seem to bother me any. In fact, he even tried to sound just like Anderson on the opening cut, &quot;Machine Messiah&quot;. You can tell that Yes wasn't really wanting to shake off their prog sound, as songs like the aforementioned &quot;Machine Messiah&quot; and &quot;Tempus Fugit&quot; clearly demonstrates. &quot;Does It Really Happen&quot; more points to the 1980s Yes sound, it also reminds me of Asia, but it's a lot better than anything Asia can come up with. The only song I can say I honestly don't care for is &quot;Into the Lens&quot;, especially the verse that kept repeating &quot;I am a camera, camera camera&quot;. What I also liked of Drama over Tormato is it has a more rocking sound, and no cheesefests like Anderson's awful &quot;Circus of Heaven&quot; to ruin things. To me this is definately Yes' best since Going For the One, and if you don't mind Anderson isn't here, chances are you might like this album.

B0000668IF|3.0|This album definitely surprised me.  A longtime fan of Moby from his early underground days to his recent transcendance into blue/folk/soul trippiness, I tend to be happy with whatever Moby does.  The album started off promising, with three great songs (1-3, three being the best on the album) in a row. And then, it crashes. Moby samples widely throughout the album, which is fine if done creatively. I'm not saying I could have done better, but the first 3 peices were pretty moving, and then he deteriorates. I just didn't feel like there was any meaning behind the remaining songs;they were filler. A lot of synthesizing and orchestra try to hype it up, but one something is missing. Almost no techno present, and lots of bluesy riffs that lack any semblence of a climactic procession (**translation: they drag on with no point). It was like PLAY without the catchiness--and don't get me wrong, I loved PLAY. Buyers beware, and don't say I didn't warn you!
0140072187|5.0|This book helps to understand the Vietnam experience a little better. The book is well written and moves along too fast. You will be finishing this story before you are ready!<br />Mr. Mason, like so many Vietnam Veterans, went through pure hell over there while the American citizen went about his life casually and seemingly unconcerned. This book shows some of the times that our brave soldiers faced for us. They did their duty and I for one am proud of them!<br />For good, easy, fun and thoughtful reading, I highly recommend this book. It is one of my all time favorites about Vietnam and I have read it 3 times so far. Thanks Mr. Mason and God Bless!
B000002AP1|3.0|The story of how the original &quot;Raw Power&quot; was remixed by David Bowie at the company's request has become legendary. What few people know is that, if what Iggy told &quot;Trouser Press&quot; is to be believed, Bowie did not remix &quot;Search and Destroy&quot;. Iggy loved the song so much he asked Bowie to please not tamper with the mix. That's why that song has a lot more treble than the others on the original album. Now Iggy has remixed the whole album, but the results are not very good in my opinion. In fact, my guess (but don't tell anyone!) is that someone else, not Iggy, actually did the remixing. So the track that suffered the most was exactly &quot;Search and Destroy&quot; (does it stand for &quot;search&quot; the original multitracks and &quot;destroy&quot; the song's original power?). My bottom line is: customers should have a choice of buying the original mix.
B00003CX9E|3.0|This is a good film. I first studied it in a film class as a high school student and have watched in a few times in the many years since then. My issues with it are the same as everyone else's, for the most part-- mainly that this is considered a &quot;great&quot; film because it popularized innovative technical work decades ago, but for modern audiences will not really notice the breakthroughs. It is a necessity for the film student to watch, and as an engineer, I appreciate Welles' technical determination to do the work he wanted to do. Lay audiences are quite justified and reacting with &quot;huh?&quot; when told it is &quot;the best film ever made.&quot;<br />My unique issues regarding the main weakness of this film can be borne out in the other reviews themselves-- generally, even hardcore fans don't connect to the characters or has deep abiding affection for the story. It does not emotionally resonate with audiences. For those that love the film, it's because of its connection with Orson Welles-- &quot;a technical genius!&quot;, &quot;ahead of his time,&quot; &quot;only 25 when he directed, produced, and starred!&quot; they will say. The connection that fans of this film feel is with the man, Welles, himself, which is why the film has such enduring appeal amongst filmmakers or those who wish they were filmmakers. Many people who are fans of Gone with the Wind or Casablanca couldn't tell you who directed them because fans of those movies identify strongly with the characters and the story and the emotions of those movies, not the process and personality of the man who made them. By contrast, the connection fans of Citizen Kane have is not with Citizen Kane the character but Orson Welles the filmmaker. This makes the movie a wonderful experience for those who want to identify with the technical and professional achievements of Welles, but not for those seeking a more &quot;human&quot; connection with the actual characters and experiences depicted in the film itself.<br />Orson Welles was the best filmmaker of his time, and perhaps all time (Hitchcock being his main competition for this title). Citizen Kane is not the best film of all time, but we can be tempted to believe so because it is so easy to confuse Citizen Kane the movie with Orson Welles the man.elf.<br />Orson Welles was the best filmmaker of his time, and perhaps all time (Hitchcock being his main competition for this title).

B00005YXZH|1.0|I too believed all the hype of this being &quot;the first classic album of the year&quot;.  Could not wait to get my hands on it and they suffered through a disappointing effort of dark droning and sub-par effort.  Stay away!
B00005R2M3|1.0|Shakira's voice sounds like a combination of Buffy St. Marie, Ren Hoek, and Ethel Merman. She obviously doesn't have a clue as to what the lyrics of her own songs about, because no thinking human being could release \\"Underneath Your Clothes\\" with a straight face. Anyone with an intellect can figure out that Shakira is just another hot piece of a$$ that's going to be bare-bellied and exploited till the cash cow runs out. Plus, she can't sing. And don't counter with the fact that she's sold 16 gazilion albums in her native language--excrement is excrement...earplugs, please.
B00005YW4H|4.0|This album is appreciated by my 11 and 15 year old daughters, my ex (grin) husband (oh, he's a jazz musician!) and me, your atypical 42 music lover. I think Norah shows a great deal of potential and this disc is very lyrical. I'd recommend it to anyone into Diana Krall or Shirley Horn. We play it to mellow out - even the country influences work. I hope her next CD has a bit more blues and we all can't wait to see her in concert
B000002OX3|5.0|For those of you who have the older c.d. version of this, I just have to note that this remastered version of the Who's second album sounds monumentally better than the previously available version, to the degree that it sounds like a whole new album! In fact, everything sounds so clear, it sounds like it was recorded yesterday!  Also, you get great bonus tracks, like the terrific psych pop of &quot;Disguises,&quot; probably their most overlooked song ever, their energetic cover of &quot;Barbara Ann,&quot; and a terrific version of &quot;My generation&quot; that devolves into a freakbeat/psych feedback-ridden &quot;Land of Hope and Glory&quot;!  The remasters of &quot;Sell out&quot; and &quot;Live at Leeds&quot; have also been given a similar treatment, and sound way better than the old versions.  Get 'em all!
B00005RY7X|5.0|I first saw AWK on MTV when they were running and MTV2 thing.  I saw the video and was intrigued.  I downloaded a few mp3's and I was hooked.  Shortly thereafter I bought the CD and got the rest of the songs I hadn't heard yet.  Between seeing him on MTV and buying the CD I went to the concert.  The show was totally kickass.  Full of energy, fun and a positive vibe, it was a blast.  He didn't flinch when people started hopping up on stage and actually helped people up, carrying a few people on his shoulders.  <br />The music speaks for itself.  I like all kinds, but this is a nice contrast to the dark and dreary stuff that's dominant today.<br />Check AWK out today!!
B000002L7Y|5.0|We all remember the hit song, &quot;Take On Me&quot;, and its awesome video. However, most music listeners don't know anything beyond that track and just dismiss the band as one-hit wonders. It's important to note that the band found continued success in Europe/Asia; most U.S. listeners forget that their is an outside market with valuable opinions that exists beyond their shores. Sadly, the public doesn't know what they are missing. Most would probably purchase the album just for that song and end up ignoring a perfectly good album. That's what this particular LP is. A classic, in my opinion. It may not have songs that are mainstream, but does that one quality define an artist's &quot;success&quot;? To all fans of the song, 80's music, or just pop music in general, let me just say this: BUY THIS ALBUM. The songwriting is alot more special than most would ever think. The title track itself is an example, with touching sentimental words about someone who harbors true, unwavering love for another. Most of the songs are about being in love, but feeling fear at the thought of losing it. I think this is something many people can relate to. The words are simple, but vivid and memorable with each passing moment. A-Ha may be the most underrated band in America. Such a shame. The public needs to be more educated on this fantastic group. Morten Harket, in my opinion, has one of the greatest &quot;voices&quot; in music as a whole. This LP is just a small sample of what he is as a vocalist and the band itself is capable of musically. &quot;The Sun Always Shines on TV&quot; is perhaps my favorite song by the band; the sound is heavy and the words cut into the soul like a sharp blade. While some of the sounds may seem outdated, a warm feeling transmitted to the listener never goes away. Morten's voice is like an instrument onto itself; you can feel all of the emotions he is unloading with words. All of the tracks run together like a wonderful piece of art. However, this is not thegreatest album done by A-Ha. Their skills only evolved with time. If you're intrigued enough to buy it and find it to be as special as I say it is, I urge you continue on that path and purchase all their albums. I can safely say you won't be disappointed. Enjoy!
B000002UB6|5.0|Most of the debate here is just a matter of personal preference, and less a real comment on the album.  It's not [fill in Abbey Road, Revolver, or any other Beatles album], which just goes to show you how great the Beatles were.  They had an amazing range.<br />Let It Be was the perfect bittersweet note for the Beatles to go out on.  A little melancholy, some sweet songs, a little rock.  It's the burned out, grown up Beatles, trying to face the fact that it was time to go their separate ways.  The fact that we still listen to it 30 years later says it all.
B0000029DD|5.0|\\"Grace\\" is the kind of CD that once you fully appreciate it, you want to play it for everyone you know. You want to make sure that music this good is heard by as many people as possible.  It is also the kind of CD that needs to be really listened to, not just thrown in the stereo as background music. You may have to listen to it 4 or 5 times before it really grows on you, but it is so worth the time. <BR>There is not one bad song on the CD, and it is hard even to pick one standout, because they are all so amazing. The title track is one of the most powerful, and it really shows off the range of Buckley's voice. \\"Last Goodbye\\" is songwriting honesty at its best. One of my favorite songs on the CD is Buckley's version of Leonard Cohen's \\"Hallelujah\\". Buckley makes this song his own in a way that most musicians can't accomplish with cover songs.  Since this album's release, most versions of that song have been done almost exactly like Buckley's, and not like the original. Many people don't even realize that it is a cover, because Buckley just owns the song like it was one of his own. <BR>There really is no way to understand how good this CD is without hearing it for yourself. And for Amazon's price ..., there's really no excuse not to buy it.
B00005YW4H|5.0|During my weekly trek ... I spy a new music listening station devoted to \\"New Women's Releases\\". Intrigued I listen to several selections on the same old Celine Dion, Alannis etc & then I pick up Norah Jones. I was really surprised her music was released because it's not 'poppy sounding' like Michelle Branch or Vanessa Carlton, who have become popular as of late and it's not like Shakira or Britney. She had a voice that drew me in. It reminded me of listening to old records of Billie Holiday with my grandparents on a rainy Saturday night. I grabbed the CD up right away. I admit I am a jazz & blues fan but you don't have to be to enjoy this music. Her voice is so different & sounds much more mature than her years. I hope Norah has success & starts a trend towards what I hope the future of music holds: talented musicians. Imagine that!!!
B00005JKCF|1.0|Much as I was excited to see spiderman, having enjoyed the comics and cartoon series, I am sorely disappointed with the film. It was not the plot that was bad, in fact, it stayed pretty accurate, but the really lousy dialogue that accompanied it. If I can spend more than half a movie cringing at cheesy lines and not enjoy the cringing, it probably wasn't a good movie. I mean, cheesiness can be fun and memorable and oftentimes so quotable, but this was quite painful. The hospital declaration of love scene made me look at my friend and ask when the movie was ending. Perhaps the redeeming quality was the action sequences, I did love how Peter Parker flew across the buidings, unfortunately, sometimes, I felt that the special effects seemed choppy and stilted, as compared to the other scenes. Perhaps this is intentional, but I thought it made the film more disjointed. And much as I do enjoy fight scenes, while Spiderman's showdown with the Green Goblin was exciting and all, I felt that is wasn't very tastefully done. But kudos to William Defoe for being such an outstanding brillant. His portrayal of the Green Goblin was exactly how I envisioned it to be. Mary Jane, however, was badly cast. Kirsten Dunst is quite a lousy actress and the red hair is just awful on her! Her acting seems contrived at times and I don't think she brings out the character of Mary Jane at all! Perhaps another young actress, like Claire Danes would make a better Mary Jane. Now, to our title character - Spiderman. When I first found out that Tobey Maguire was playing Spiderman, I thought it was again, another bad choice, but now, in restrospect, I think he did a marvelous job. He captures the innocence, nerdiness of Spiderman so well, and plays our down to earth hero with much aplomb. Despite the awful awful dialogue that plagued the entire film, he managed to deliver his lines as credibly as he possibly could. Overall, despite having a pretty good plot and a believable Spiderman and villian, the film was marred by the less than stellar supporting cast, bad bad script, and not ILM standard special effects.
B00005YXZH|5.0|if you haven't gotten into wilco yet, try it. i have just recently tried them out and found them to be wonderful. they have just a great mix of all that is good and pure in music. it is very comforting to listen to any of their albums because i am reminded that these are recent and that there is actually hope for pop music in the future. this album is their best of what i have heard. i don't have a.m. though but i plan on getting it soon. this album is really a great leap for them and for me has propelled them into that catagory that i only reserve for really great bands. it is very artistic but easy to receive. each song is very unique and moves the listener forward. this is one of those truely unique albums and probably the best of 2002 thus far that i have heard.
0060090367|5.0|Watermelon was one of the few books that made me laugh out loud, on many occasions. I loved this book, and feel it was the best one that Marian Keyes has written.

B00005JCA9|2.0|Unbelievably, Hugh Grant turns down Julia Roberts and the next moment he's announcing this to a roomfull of friends.  They, without too much effort, convince Grant that he's made a terrible mistake.  Then, they all immediately pile into a car (including his friend's wife in a wheelchair) and race to Roberts's hotel, breaking every traffic rule along the way.  Couldn't Grant have quietly come to a realization without involving his odd circle of friends?  And couldn't he have gone to try to see Roberts without dragging them all with him?  I think that's what an American leading man would have done.  This was an obvious effort to &quot;build up&quot; the ending, using all of the supporting characters.  It was needless and you can see right through the scriptwriter's intentions.  Also, my apology to Rhys Ifans, but I think he actually hurt the film and should have been left on the cutting room floor.  He made the film hard to take seriously, which I really wanted to do.

0440213525|3.0|Mark, an 11 year old boy who lives in a trailer park with his mom and his younger brother Ricky in Memphis Tennessee, had to deal with many problems in his past. He had to put up with his father who was a drunk and used to beat his mom. One day while his mom went to work he and Ricky decided to steal their mom's cigarettes and go into the woods to smoke them. There they found a man{Jerome}in a car trying to commit suicide by the carbon monoxide. They try to save him by taking the pipe out, the man catches them and tells them his clients who are in the Mafia have killed the Senator Boyd Boyette. He told them that they hid his body underneath his garage in New Orleans. After telling the two boys the news he shoots himself in the head. This really freaks out the two boys. Mean while Barry Blade who was a part in the Senator's death, doesn't want the U.S. Attorney to find the body or he will have to go to prison. Soon after hearing  what Jerome told them, their mother finds out. Mark later goes to Reggie Love who is an Attorney, who has recently been divorced and had an alcoholic problem. He hires her to protect him from the Mafia as well as the authorities. This was a long book and the court scenes were confusing but the ending was great. As you read this book you will understand the courage of Mark and the great barriers he has to overcome with a little help from Reggie.
B00005JKJA|5.0|Remember when Hollywood still made pictures for thinking adults? Me neither!<br />I've now seen all two and a half hours of this beautiful, difficult, and disturbing film three times. I still don't know what it \\"means,\\" and I still don't care. Once you accept certain givens in a Lynch film--disjointed narrative, intentionally cheesy dialogue, demonic dwarves--and allow his imagery to guide you, you're in for a truly spooky ride. There are scenes in Muholland Drive (and in Eraserhead and Blue Velvet) that no other director could have even imagined much less caught on film. Of course, it helps that the film's darker elements are balanced by liberal doses of eroticism and campy good humor. Ultimately, though, Lynch's portrait of a talented innocent swallowed whole by the corporate studio system constitutes no less than a hate letter to Hollywood, albeit one that was nominated for several Academy awards!<br />Finally, I'm docking this DVD a notch not because of the film's quality but because of a poor video transfer and an inexplicable and very obvious bit of censorship in the film's one love scene.
0385484518|5.0|I absolutely love the book Tuesdays with Morrie by Mitch Albom.  People say that there are usually 1 or 2 books that will change your life forever.  I would have to say that this is the book.  The plot is simple.  It is a journey of a strong and powerful friendship between to adult men, Morrie and Mitch.  There are three major reasons why I love this book.  The first is probably that it's a really inspirational book.  Morrie's battle with ALS makes any problem I've ever gone through seem so small and not important.  His positive attitude makes me want to try harder at the things I do and want to appreciate life more.  I also like the book a lot because it shows that friendships can last through the ages even when you don't speak to someone for a decade and a half.  Morrie and Mitch are a good example that if the relationship has a strong base, that it is bound to survive almost anything, from graduating college and moving on with life, to battling the life altering ALS.  The third reason I love this book is the simple fact that it is a heartwarming story that will make you laugh and cry all at the same time. It makes you want to pick up the phone and call that good ole friend that you haven't talked to in awhile and it makes you want to show the people closest to you how much you care about them.  I strongly suggest that you read this book, it is a classic and I truely think it will have a great effect on you.
6300271285|4.0|What can I say, I think that this is a wonderful movie and musical.  The setting takes place in a plant shop that is on the verge of bankruptcy.  Mr. Mushnik is the boss and Audrey and Seymour work for him.  Seymour buys a human eating plant for Audrey and names it Audrey 2.  Seymour is hopelessly in love with Audrey, but unfortunately Audrey already has a boyfriend, Orin.  Orin is a dentist and treats Audrey like dirt.  Deep down, Audrey would rather be with Seymour than wit Orin.  Finally Seymour kills Orin and feeds him to Audrey 2.<br />OK, here is why I did not give this movie five stars.  As I imagine you all know, the play and the movie are different.  In the play at the End Audrey 2 eats Audrey and Seymour feels so lonely without her that he commits suicide by feeding himself to the plant.  In the movie on the other hand the shop caught fire and the plant didn't survive, but Audrey and Seymour got married.  Another problem with the movie was that the poignant love song, &quot;Suddenly, Seymour,&quot;  was well overdone.  Missing also is the catchy song &quot;Closed For Renovation.&quot;<br />Other than that, this is a wonderful movie, and I would chose to watch it time and again.  So go ahead, buy it.  You will not be sorry.
B00005YXZH|5.0|Not to diminish Wilco's accomplishment with this cd, it must also be said that this is an exemplary outing for Jim O'Rourke (better, in fact, than his own recent release, &quot;Insignificance.&quot;) He's credited here only for 'recording,' though I can't imagine he was anything less than the disc's producer, judging by the sound of YHF. True, &quot;Summerteeth&quot; did pop and buzz in places, but that creative use of noise really comes to the forefront on this 'recording.' And the music is much improved, for its presence. I was a fan of Wilco's two previous cds, and you can see the progression toward YHF, making O'Rourke a natural choice to accentuate the band's incipient leanings toward noise.  The mark of a truly skilled producer, he can bring this out organically from the music, rather than reformulating it as something it is not.  He has done the same for Stereolab, and if you're a Wilco fan who appreciates this disc, I recommend you give Stereolab's more recent outings a try, as well as O'Rourke's solo albums, &quot;Halfway to a Threeway&quot; and &quot;Bad Timing.&quot;<br />An excellent marriage of band and producer, YHF proves that hope remains for music on this continent.

0385503954|5.0|I have always been an Ian McEwan fan, from early works such as \\"Child in Time\\" and \\"Enduring Love\\" to \\"Amsterdam\\", which I believe won the Booker, but in \\"Atonement\\" he reaches a new level. I devoured this book in a day! McEwan has always been a master of plot, but here he goes beyond plot, recreating an English country summer in 1935 from the point of view of several members of an upper middle class family. The languor and restlessness of summer, the tedium of an empty middle aged life, the confusion and fear of a young girl on the verge of discovering the mystery of sex, are woven together beautifully, all leading up to the \\"crime\\" which nevertheless is a shock. The plot quickly shifts to wartime England, with a riveting telling of the disastrous retreat by the British from France to the beaches of Dunkirk, and the scene at home when the bloodied soldiers return. Fast forward to many years later when the story is finally ready to be told. McEwan is fond of plot twists and little tricks, but the depth and vividness of description  makes this far more than a well-written page turner. I won't say more; to reveal anything of the plot would be unfair. Tastes differ, but I cannot imagine ANYONE being bored by this book. I loved it!

B0000668IF|4.0|With \\"Play\\" Moby went from obscure vegan techno artiste to mass-marketed king of electronica. The title was justified, because \\"Play\\" was a brilliant record fueled by an even more brilliant idea - combining old field recordings of forgotten blues singers with up-to-the-minute dance floor grooves. Fans of \\"Play\\" should not be disappointed by \\"18\\" - unless they were hoping Moby would revolutionize electronica all over again by going in a completely different direction. He hasn't, but who really cares when the songs are still this good? \\"18\\" follows the familar \\"Play\\" formula of mixing old blues-soul sounds with modern, synth-driven dance music. There are also some of the beautifully orchestrated, somber meditations that were featued on the compilation \\"mobysongs\\" (rush-released after \\"Play\\" became a smash hit). Guest vocalists make strong contributions to \\"18\\", which is welcome since Moby's voice is a bit limited and would wear thin over 18 tracks. Sinead O'Connor is in fine haunting form on \\"Harbour\\" (come back, Sinead, all is forgiven!) and MC Lyte has a hilarious rap on \\"Jam for the Ladies.\\" (I see a future Nike commercial?) \\"18\\" may not push the boundaries of music the way \\"Play\\" did, but that's probably asking too much of any artist. After all, even Moby's famous ancestor Herman Melville only wrote one \\"Moby Dick.\\"

B00005J9LY|4.0|&quot;Please&quot; is the debut album from Pet Shop Boys.  When &quot;West End Girls&quot; was released in 1985, it quickly became an international hit with its memorable bassline and spoken-rap by Neil Tennant.  Like most debut acts that come out with a novelty single, it seeemed that Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe were going the way of the One Hit Wonder.  However, the hits kept coming and coming off this fine debut.  &quot;Opportunities&quot; has the punch and verve of &quot;West End Girls,&quot; while the goregous &quot;Love Comes Quickly&quot; is a fine, seductive ballad.  It's a shame that PSB's American following dwindled after the release of this million-selling debut, because their work only got better from here.  &quot;Please&quot; is remastered and repackaged with a second disc of bonus material.  My cuts of choice are the re-edit of the album track &quot;Why Don't We Live Together?,&quot; an extended mix of &quot;West End Girls,&quot; and the infectious b-side &quot;Was That What it Was?&quot;  Their debut is far from their best, but it would only set the tone for a bright future, several top 10 hits, and a rich body of work many of their peers would envy.

B00005Y7OJ|4.0|Chris Lowe and Neil Tennant went all out to make a perky, straightforward dance album on &quot;Very,&quot; but on here, the follow-up, PSB mellow things down and employ Latin influences.  &quot;Before&quot; is probably the duo's most understated single.  While most songs have a hook that grab you right away, &quot;Before&quot; is a laid back disco jam that slowly grows on you.  The most noticeable feature on &quot;Bilingual&quot; is how the Boys employ Latin influences--long before the craze went mainstream in 1999.  The horn section in &quot;Metamorphosis&quot; and &quot;Se Vida E&quot; blend nicely with the PSB sound we've grown so accustomed to.  However, they also turn out some straight-up disco numbers such as the energetic &quot;Red Letter Day&quot; and the downright catchy &quot;Saturday Night Forever,&quot; the disc's closing track.  Lyrically, it's not the duo's strongest album, but PSB do expand their horizons musically on this fine disc.

B00003CX5P|5.0|I loved this movie, and I am a HUGE star wars fan. Some of the acting was not really strong (but that is not what the sw films are known for), but that did not detract from the beautiful panoramic shots, the development of the Queen's story line, and the setting for the next films.  I sometimes even think this is my favorite one of the series.
B0000668IF|5.0|... and a spiritual thing. The album as one moment within the everlasting journey, the process of inner changes, as Moby states himself. <BR>I still love the past album \\"Play\\", the overwhelming mix of styles, beats, expressions, ... And I am found of\\"18\\" for it's simplicity and harmony, the songs reduced to peaceful extracts. This attitude finds it's finest expression in \\"Harbour\\", starting with the unobtrusive sound of guitar and rhythm machine, as natural as our heart beat, while the female voice is followed by transparent echo's.<BR>I did enjoy listening to Moby himself singing in four tracks and first got a little confused by so many different singers who are involved. But right these intense, trained but natural voices are transporting the qualities earth, nature and human within the electronic sounds. <BR>The album takes us both to our inner self and to the outer space, and this is not a contradiction. Moby has already the space suit on and starts with a simple line: \\"We are all made of stars.\\"
B00005UDOM|4.0|I waited quite some time to get this & it was a quite expensive, but the packaging & sound are great!  This is a great listen; I always though AIC was the 90s version of Sabbath & with one listen to this, I think you'll see what I mean.  Apparently, this is an Amazon exclusive because CDNow was supposed to get this also originally, but have now taken it off their inventory.  This album was a chronicle of Layne Staley's heroin addiction & demons which ultimately claimed his life last month (R.I.P.). So very sad, but with some artists, it's easy by listening to them to see that they know their time is short (go back & listen to Mother Love Bone & Blind Melon as well as AIC now & see what I mean).  So sad that he couldn't conquer the addiction, but the same goes for so many other great talents as well.  We will always cherish their music.
B000002P48|5.0|How is it that as of today this Skynyrd masterpiece has been reviewed a measly 13 times, while Megadeth's execrable Risk cd has been reviewed 238 times?  Not to pick on Megadeth - I am a big fan of theirs - but Pronouced Leh-nerd Skin-nerd is an all-time classic.<br />Well, maybe Lynyrd Skynyrd and their southern rock brethren are a joke to a lot of people today.  Sorry, the joke is on those who've never given Skynyrd a chance - they are missing out on some of the best rock music ever made.  Lynyrd Skynyrd's pre-plane crash discography holds up as well as that of any other rock band in my book.  And Pronounced Leh-nerd Skin-nerd is where it all started.  <br />Can you imagine what an effect this album must have had on the musical climate when it first hit the record stores?  I can't - I was just 3 years old at the time.  But they say that within no time, Lynyrd Skynyrd were so popular that they were blowing The Who off the stage on a nightly basis when they toured together.  <br />When I reached high school, I finally heard Allen Collins, Ed King, and Gary Rossington's sweet 3-guitar onslaught and Ronnie's country-soaked voice for the first time and I was hooked.  From that slippery drum intro to `I Ain't The One' to the last note of `Free Bird', this is one special album.  Is there a better, more affecting ballad out there than, `Tuesday's Gone'?  Can anyone beat the guitar riff and amusing lyrics to `Gimme Three Steps'?  Didn't think so.  This is as classic an album as they get.<br />I'll admit that Pronounced Leh-nerd Skin-nerd is particularly satisfying if you grew up in the American South like I did, but anyone with an appreciation of real, honest rock music is likely to love it.  No other southern rock band of their time came close to matching Skynyrd, and this album is a great place to start your Skynyrd collection if you haven't started it already.  <br />If you're already a Skynyrd fan, then do yourself a favor and pick up the best southern rock album of the past 25 years, Drive By Truckers' Southern Rock Opera.  I'm not exaggerating when I say that in many ways, it is as good as anything Lynyrd Skynyrd produced.  It is also by far the best rock album of 2001.<br />Oh yeah - and Southern Rock Opera has only 6 Amazon reviews so far.  What a shame.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|It's hard to think of a good, thoughtful review of an album that is just plain wonderful. If you like Dylan (any of his musical stages) you should like this. If you're not a Dylan fan but like blues or bluesy rock, check this out. The lyrics are, as always, clever and intelligent. I'm amazed that he gets better with each album. But it's true. I can't say this is his &quot;best yet&quot; because each album is so different, but this is a great record to buy--even if you're not already a Dylan fan, or if you were put off by his folky stuff a million years ago. I happen to enjoy and appreciate it all, but that Dylan continues to make music that draws new fans--people who wouldn't have given him a listen thirty years ago--is awesome.
B0000668IF|4.0|This really is a pretty well done album, with some excellent tracks on it. However, it really doesn't have the soul of Play, the variety of Everything is Wrong, nor the anger of Animal Rights. Rather, Moby has created one of his most accesable albums to date. Sure, some tracks may sound like 'Play: Part Two', but the real great songs are the ones that depart from his techno-gospel sound and venture into a more experimental sound(like the amazing \\"Sleep Alone\\"). If your'e a Moby fan, get it. If you just picked up Play and stopped there, I suggest it as well. But Everything Is Wrong is still Moby's best.<BR>HIGHLIGHTS: 18 (my favourite song on the disc), Signs of Love, Sleep Alone, Look Back In<BR>LOW POINTS: Jam For The Ladies (annoying), One Of These Mornings (cliche), Harbour (really bad)
B00005QZ7U|4.0|...I was VERY reluctant to see this, and did so on DVD only after weeks of prodding by a well-meaning friend. I'm about as jaded a movie fan as there is, so you can imagine how low my expectations were...<br />WOW! It must have taken a brave soul to bring this film to fruition. Director/writer Baz Luhrmann has crafted a very unique looking (and sounding) piece of work. The contemporary songs set in century-ago Paris can be rather off-putting at first, but soon you can't help but be [brought] into the romance, the glamour, the lavish production design, the frenetic energy, and the unfolding love triangle. Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor aren't professional-caliber singers by any stretch, but they still perform remarkably well. Australian actor Richard Roxburgh plays The Duke, the spoiler in the would-be pairing of the young lovers, and he is an absolute hoot -- simultaneously creepy, evil, conniving, and funny.<br />One of the songs repeated throughout the film is \\"Nature Boy\\", a jazz standard and perhaps the least-recognizable song to contemporary audiences. It is from the lyrics to this song that the main theme of the movie is taken -- \\"The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return.\\" Sounds a bit corny, right? Yes, it does. But as McGregor rightly points out in the DVD supplementary material, music touches us on a different level than the spoken word. Words and poetry that sound silly or cheesy when spoken can be beautiful, poignant, and emotionally powerful when delivered in song. That concept is demonstrated masterfully in \\"Moulin Rouge\\". Even if you don't like the idea of contemporary tunes in a period musical, you will still probably be enchanted by the orchestral score weaved between them.<br />So many things could have gone wrong with this movie to make it simply unwatchable. The cast would have to be totally committed to the idea of it all to sell it onscreen. They are, and they do. Luhrmann has created, with a singularly unique vision, what may well be the last great movie musical. The movie musical is a near-dead genre, and it takes a remarkable one to breathe respectability and life back into it. \\"MR\\" succeeds at that (as much as I hate to admit it - I really didn't want to like this film, but I do).<br />\\"Moulin Rouge\\" certainly has a few moments in it that you will find a bit too silly. But they are compensated for by other moments of absolute brilliance, beauty, and breathtaking imagination and creativity.<br />Thanks ... for insisting that I watch this movie against my better judgement. I owe you one.ision, what may well be the last great movie musical.

B000062YAZ|5.0|Although I am a Christian I don't really have a problem with the lyrics, except the song Jesus Saves.Anyway lets get to the music. Slayer is one of the best, if not the best thrash metal band of all time. Every song on here is extremely fast and heavy.Every cut is awesome,the only song I skip over is Jesus Saves. Raining Blood has one of the best intro's to a metal song.Which is why many other thrash bands copy it. I strongly suggest this one.
B000062YAY|5.0|The thought of having a kind of greatest hits album from the world's finest heavy metal band is wonderful. But to have it in a live format as well is mind blowing. This was the chance to show people how a live album could and should be done. In other words, totally live without any mixing what so ever. Let us run through some of the many merits of this fine release...<br />First of all, the solos. If there were any doubters that Hanneman and King could not deliver on set as precisely as on studio albums then they have been promptly brushed aside. Not only do they exell at what they do but some of the solos differ slightly from the studio recordings. We have variety to go with shining execution. Just lingering upon one track, to hear 'Angel of Death's' famous opening riff burst out like an explosion is truly satisfying. <br />I suppose if there was to be any criticism then it would have to be that Tom can no longer reach (or if he gets there) hold onto the high notes. But this is a far cry from true criticism as his performance perfectly matches the mayhem around him. <br />The one thing, however, as seems traditional with Slayer is that quietly and efficiently Dave Lombardo manages to steal the show in my opinion. It defies belief that he can perform some of the technical abilities that he does. But when you hear it perfectly replicated (and surpassed in some cases) live then there is really only one God. 'Seasons in the Abyss' is a classic case of this. Lombardo is immense and displays his power around the kit.<br />Many live albums have come and gone simply because, no matter how good the band, there has been a failure to achieve the results when recording out of the studio. This is an exeption to that general fact. Slayer's intensity is here more than ever, the speed of even the fastest tracks is accelerated further and the atmosphere accompanies all this wonderfully. This is a gift from Olympus not just for Slayer fans but for all those who like metal the way itshould be. Upon hearing this, nu - metal should cower in a corner and take a pummeling.
B000066C1N|4.0|Despite the production quality of some of the tracks, overall this is quite a pleasant soundtrack.  I was hoping though that the song that is played on some of the most recent trailers would be here--the song by the female vocalist.  It is not.  Does anyone know who this performer is and the name of the song?
B000060P79|5.0|This album is fantastic!! This band are fantastic!! You cannot go wrong with this album!! If you like a bit of powerpop punk or wanna hear goddamn stunning harmonies or just some great guitar licks check this out. I first heard them on the Atticus compilation \\"Dragging The Lake\\" and have loved them since.
B000009EAD|5.0|First I'll state the obvious: This Album Kills! \\"Burning Times\\" is a perfect opener for \\"Something Wicked...\\" It kicks your [rear]w/ authority and makes no apologies for doing so! Jon Schaffer and Matt Barlow are Heavy Metal's answer to Lennon & Mcartney. They're a duo that just can't be beat! \\"Watching Over Me\\", \\"Reaping Stone\\", \\"1776\\", \\"Stand Alone\\" and \\"Burning Times\\" are my favorites on this album. Overall the songwriting is superb. Iced Earth should be enjoying the platinum selling status that Metallica has achieved and that all these \\"nu-metal\\" bands should have never gotten to in the first place! One listen to \\"Something Wicked\\" and you'll agree, that IE 's music is just as good, if not better than anything Metallica has done! That's saying alot because I love Metallica!<BR>Check it out.

B000051VWW|4.0|Again, as with the early CDs, Sade Adu comes forth as a complete woman, strong and supportive, yet vulnerable.  As with the former collections, the strongest songs (IMHO) are grouped in front.  With &quot;By Your Side&quot; and &quot;Flow&quot;, she portrays strength in standing by her man, loving and supportive.  &quot;King of Sorrows&quot; expresses deep sadness and yet there's no self-pity in this woman living in a real world of hurt.  &quot;Somebody Already Broke My Heart&quot; expresses a deep past hurt with courage and hope as she ventures forth for the love she needs.  These are emotional songs speaking to the women who experience these emotions and also to the men in their lives.  Here is the appeal of Sade Adu and it's every bit as strong at the time the record was released as it was 15 years earlier when she first came into the music scene.<br />Another notable song is &quot;The Sweetest Gift&quot; which may be a lover's song, but also works as a mother's song.  And of course, there is the title song, &quot;Lovers Rock&quot;.  <br />I do admire Sade Adu for including songs of social consciousness in her collections.  &quot;Slave Song&quot; and &quot;Immigrant&quot; do not preach to us, but they portray past and present injustice.<br />Sade Adu's fans won't be disappointed by this set, but jazz fans will be.  Her first three albums were distinguished by superior jazz work and by the way she gave the group space in which to perform.  Stewart Matthewman's sax faded in LOVE DELUXE, but the group still had their chance to play some cool and smooth jazz in the final instrumental.  Not so here.  The percussion sounds like a drum machine and the keyboard and guitar are very subdued.  I miss that distinctive jazz backing.  <br />However, if you have other Sade CDs, you'll want this one; and if you don't have any yet, c'mon, get with it!  This is a good enough one to start with!
0060090367|4.0|Being a fan of the Brit Chic novel, I really enjoyed this book.  Claire is a wonderful heroine -- she's been left on the day that she gives birth by her husband and so she goes to her native Dublin to hang out with her (so-hilarious-you-wish-they-were-yours) family.  Her gorgeous, self-involved sister Helen, her other hippie flaky sister Anna, her sweet mother who can't cook, and her concerned yet slightly aloof father, all round out this novel to make a great story.  This is the perfect light beach read, and at 417 pages, the book will last longer than a lot of other light beach reads.
B00005RY7X|5.0|When I first listened to I Get Wet by Andrew WK, I was blown away by the positivity of his message in sharp contrast to the negativity of most mainstream bands.  Instead of being depressed or dwelling on his childhood (Disturbed, Blink 182, Staind) he sends out his message of acceptance and the party that is life.  He focuses more on acceptance and achieving happiness in his upbeat, energetic music that pays homage to video game tunes, 80's music, metal, and funky pop tunes all at the same time, while having a streak of his own upbeat, quirky personality mixed in.  I have met the guy, so I know of what I speak.  He puts on a rockin live show, and I highly recommend that anyone with the opportunity go see him.  He is highly appreciative of fans, and spends hours signing personal autographs and talking to those who love what he is about.  I recommend this CD to anyone over the age of 10.
B00005RY7X|5.0|Many of you will think that Andrew W.K.'s I Get Wet is a joke, but it's not.  His music fuels my every desire.  It's melodies are so positive, they do nothing but make me smile, and be happy.  This music is heartfelt Rock N' Roll at it's finest.  If you don't own it, you must buy it, you will never think of life in the same way.
B000001E7T|3.0|i bought this a few years ago, and i was a bit young, and expected so much from this, seeming how it had been heralded her &quot;greatest&quot; album.<BR>i didn't understand why anyone liked her when i first listened to it. her vocals sounded strangled, like she COULD sing, but wouldn't, and the guitar/organs had a bleak, anorexic feeling to it. pj harvey looking psychotic and sick in the cd booklet topped it off.<BR>but, since then, i've grown accustomed to getting spit on by this record by it's chill and noise.<BR>this isn't a record you can snuggle up to, it would be kind of masochistic to love on it.<BR>i LIKE this record. i think it's pj harvey's worst, mainly because it's so hard to get into.... not good for a pj harvey beginner.<BR>if you like sweeter harvey, get &quot;stories from the city&quot; or &quot;is this desire&quot;<BR>if you like something a little more unpolished... &quot;dry&quot;

B00005O5JV|1.0|Elle makes an impact when she wants to go to law school.  She makes a big spectacle of herself.  After losing her boyfriend, she decides to enroll in Harvard to try to win him back.  Are we supposed to take her immature perspective and gawdy fashion sense as the gospel truth?  Not very appealing.  The film takes the airhead too seriously.  Will the ditzy teen comedies never end?  It is the worst teen movie I've ever seen.  In fact, it's the worst movie I've seen in recent years.  If a person skips out on Legally Blond, they won't be missing anything.

0446677450|4.0|I like this book because it changed my ways on thinking about money.  Whether this guy made money or not doing the things he mentioned, is not really the point.  Go to a business school, and you will find a ton of professors who have never been out in the real world doing the stuff that they are teaching, have you?<br />Yes, the advice is obvious, but so many &quot;obvious&quot; things are not taken seriously.  THe only things I don't like about this book/author: The belittiling of his dad, and the school system, and that it is a little repetitive, although the author says it is the key to learning effectively.<br />I say that this book is intended for people not yet out of high school.  If you come from a wealthy family, then you might not need this book.

B00004SCX6|4.0|T his Cd is pretty good.  Even if you are not a Britney Spears fan i think you will like it.  The best tracks are Lucky and Oops... I did it again.  It is a very fun and vibrant album
B00005JKED|4.0|I didn't see this film in the theater, I rented the DVD.  So many of the reviews were slanted toward whether Denzel's performance was worthy of an Oscar. It wasn't.  I was too bent out of shape of Billy Bob Thornton not even being nominated for Monsters Ball to get involved.  After watching a pretty great film, it wasn't Denzel's best, but certainly that shouldn't stop anyone from seeing the film.  That having been said, we can move on.<br />It was interesting to see Denzel stretch his acting ability to at least the 'darker' side of man.  The premise of the movie was interesting and somewhat disconcerting, especially to someone with police personnel in their family and social circle.  The supporting cast was very believable and the on-location filming lent an air of real grit and believability to this film.<br />I am way over the age-limit some of the reviewers were suggesting for this film and I am of the wrong gender based on many reviews.  However, I want to enourage older viewers and those of the female persuasion to give this film a chance.<br />Further, I strongly recommend watching the DVD versus VHS.  The 'director's commentary' covering the entire film was mesmerizing and very informative.  I wish all DVDs would offer this awesome type of inside information from the film's director.  It a whole new territory of insight to the viewer and it made watching  the film for the second time as intriquing, if not more even more enjoyable, than the first.

B000065U1N|5.0|In one word, this movie is Stunning. It doesn't glamorize war or portray it in anyway to be anything but terrifying, bad and horrible. I do reccomend that you read the book as well though as it gives you alot of background information about the situation and individuals. The acting is great, the camera work is terrific the sound is crystal clear and the picture is very sharp. This movie is very well made and deserves all the praise it gets. You shouldn't think of this movie as an action movie to which you say \\"Cool!\\" to when watching it because that's not the kind of movie it was made to be. It shows how heroic every single one of those soldiers who fought on October 3rd and 4th, 1993 were. Soldiers like Randy Shughart and Gary Gordon who were willing to die trying to save Mike Durant and his crew must not be forgotten.

I found that this cd has become one of my new favorites.  It goes with me to work,(where several co-workers have also listened to it and decided to buy it on the spot) in my car, (where I can sing along, nice and loud), and back home to put on while making dinner.  There are no bad songs here.  I especially like Promises, Strength, Courage &amp; Wisdom and well, it is very hard to choose....I really like them all. Your money will not be wasted here.

I was holding all of that anger and hurt and frustration from his motorcycle accident I used to just beat myself up inside and i just thought I should just except the fact that it was his time to go I guess. This movie was an awsome movie and If I could shake nicole kidman hand I would let her know that I could see that she was showing alot of her love for tom was put into this movie and nicole don't give up on tom you two remind me alot of me and my fience and I wish you the best keep your head up. If give nicole an emmy I would she gets a 10 in my book.
B00000I3JM|4.0|I will never know why this Scottish band never caught on with the general public, prehaps it's because they let so much time lapse between each release (three c.d releases in total)and only a few minor hits to boot. One listen to &quot; A Walk Across The Rooftops&quot; and this is only my opinion,  I have this sense of Frank Sinatra stepping right off of broadway and into the techno scene, Paul Buchanan filling in for old blue eyes shoes instead. Whatever you dish out for the c.d, &quot;Tinseltown In The Rain&quot; alone is worth the asking price. It's a song that sticks in the back of your head, crying out to be played over and over again. It's expressive for me and I like to speak through music rather than spoken words and Tinsel Town In The Rain can convey my message in a most sincere way. There are other songs as worthy as Tinseltown In The Rain, such as Easter Parade...that song hinges on Tom Waits territory with nice gentle washes of keyboards substituting for lushful orchestra arrangements. Awalk Across The Rooftops isn't the perfect c.d, it has a few songs that actually seem to be rehashed songs at different tempos but so are all the other c.d's you buy these days and I can't really say I like it more than the &quot;Hats&quot; c.d. Hats is more refined and focused and not so rough around the edges. The Blue Nile are just a very good band that never went anywhere and it's a shame for the few that caught on to them from the start and &quot; A Walk Across The Rooftops introducted them in a big way.
6305078564|5.0|There aren't enough superlatives in the English language to adequately describe the brilliance of this production.  As a student and teacher of Literature, Theatre, and Film I can confidently and categorically state that this is the finest film adaptation of any classic novel ever produced.  The screenplay is remarkably faithful, the art direction spellbinding, the costuming and settings are breathtaking, while the casting showcases the strongest ensemble of actors I have ever witnessed.  Bear in mind that this is all coming from someone who has never seen an adequate film version of any classic novel, to the extent that I no longer thought it possible.  Ladies, beware Colin Firth as the definitive Darcy for he is guaranteed to make you swoon.  Jennifer Ehle, as Lizzy, stole my heart.  Please don't tell my wife but I have never been so deeply in love with any actress.  Her elegant and powerfully understated portrayal of Elizabeth Bennet does Austen's scintillating satire of manners great credit. In the context of recently produced Austen films I would say that Roger Michell's production of Persuasion was endearing, Emma Thompson's Sense and Sensibility was a treat for both, but Simon Langton's production of Pride and Prejudice is the most sublime, definitive, and unparalleled production of P&P yet produced. It is just pure Austen. Both First and Last Impressions remain the same on this one, it is a true classic. An absolute MUST for all Jane Austen fans. Yes, Virginia I have two copies. The 1996 edition and the 2001 Digitally Remastered \\"Special Edition.\\" Although the audio is somewhat better on the remaster I would argue that the color and resolution are richer on the original. I wonder if the 2010 \\"Restored\\" Blue Ray version would be a good excuse to buy a third copy? Hmmm....
1878574590|5.0|When I get too depressed with the Way Things Are I get this graphic novel out. I've never found it to be shocking or upsetting. To me it is inspiring. I see where some readers have trouble with the violence, the settings, the attitude. Well kids, good luck with the real world....<br /><br /> It is Marv that makes the book. Marv isn't a saint and he isn't a rocket scientist. Sometimes he just gets \\"confused\\"- especially when he stops taking his medication. But there is one area where Marv never gets confused, and that is in recognising Good and Evil, Right and Wrong. Yet, this isn't some shallow Hollywood morality play used to justify gratuitous violence. Marv is the soul of morality- the morality that counts. Here is a man who will hunt down those responsible for burning winos and bums to death simply to avenge the injustice. Here is a man who will walk into the jaws of hell to rescue a small child from white slavers simply because it wouldn't occure to him to do otherwise. Here is a man who gives his help to those who need it, simply because they need it, no matter how monstrous or powerful the opposition. Simply put, here is a MAN.<br /><br /> When my final moment on earth comes, I just hope that I have a line as good as Marv's: \\"That the best you can do, you pansies?\\"
0767812646|5.0|This Musical Production is the GREATEST! After studying the musical a few years ago in my school music class I was enchanted into the amazing story. Since then I have watched the movie over 100 times. The movie was well casted although ther are some cliches. First of all my favorite character is Fagin portrayed by Ron Moody, he delivers a powerful performance as the great villan but is still likeable. Second Jack Wild who plays the Artful Dodger he is hilarious and has a great talent. My third favorite character is Nancy who is played by Shani Wallis, her voice is enchanting and yet extremly powerful. Mark Lester who plays OLIVER has some good points and some bad. First of all he is a good acter and portrays a great helpless  soft, OLIVER although his voice is extremly weak and soft which brings down some numbers that could be great such as \\"Where is Love\\". My least favorite character would be Bill Sykes played by Oliver Reed. He delivers a powerful and frightening performance acting wise, but he could speak a little more clear. I mean you can only understand a few of his lines. Otherwise the performance is highly entertaining, loveable and quite funny. I you have never seen the show or this movie before take my advise and go out and purchase this I assure you of a wonderful time!
B00000AFFF|1.0|I love both Elvis Costello and Burt Bacharach so I anxiously awaited this release.  Frankly I couldn't wait to get rid of it after I hearing it.  Perhaps I didn't give enough of a chance but Elvis' signing was pure torture.  Apparently I'm in the minority given the overwhelming positive reviews I see here.  &quot;Incredibly disappointed&quot; would be putting it nicely. It also appears that I have to give it one star becuase I'm not allowed to give it NONE!
0790742780|3.0|This is a good movie despite the three stars I gave it.  There's really nothing wrong with this movie that I can think of, its just I'm not big into detective/cop genres.  But don't let the category fool you.  The movie is built like this:<br />Starts out with a man known to the audience only as DFENS.  He puts in his hard-worked hours, and ends up getting down in the dumps one day in particular.  He is divorced, and he wants to see his kid for a birthday party just to give a present.  But the wife is afraid of \\"DFENS\\" because he can be a little unstable.  Which is exactly what the entire city will find out one day when he just decides to get out of his car (during a traffic jam) and walk the streets to visit his kid.  Along the way, he encounters thugs, hoodlums, neo nazis, road ragers, mis-priced stores, and various other rage-inducing citizens.  Well, with a temper like his, and all of these things building and building, its like the game Incredible Crisis in movie form!<br />But this movie has some boring parts too (has to build a suitable plot).  Between every scene with DFENS, there is a scene where a near-retiring detective takes up one last case on his last few days.  With his pride on the line, he doesn't want to end the case so before his retirement.  So basically, its the detective looking for the mis-understood, ex-husband.  The structure of the movie is actually very good, and it tends to make you think.  There are also some parts that are just plain cool (when DFENS obtains some heavy-duty artillery!).<br />The DVD contains your typical extras:<br />-Language select:  English & Spanish (with subtitles)<BR>-Trailers<BR>-Interactive menus<BR>-Chapter stops<br />So in reality, this is an average DVD that I find myself watching more than once on occations.  Other viewers will probably be intrigued by the cop/detective scenes as well, and also find yourselves feeling sorry for poor ol' DFENS.  The ending is really great and makes the movie worth the purchase.  Definitely an under-estimated movie!<br />So if you like cop/detective genres or movies where people just go ballistic, then you will most certainly enjoy this journey into the mind of a normal citizen gone ballistic!
B00005LKHW|5.0|I AM A 17 YEAR OLD JUNIOR IN HIGH SCHOOL.  ME AND ALL OF MY FRIENDS LOVE THIS MOVIE.  WHEN WE HAVE NOTHING TO DO SOME NIGHTS WE JUST GET A GROUP OF PEOPLE BRING 'EM OVER AND PUT AMERICAN PIE 1 OR 2 IN AND LAUGH ALL NIGHT.  IT MAY HAVE SOME LANGUAGE AND NUDITY (NOT A LOT 1 SCENE) BUT ALL-IN-ALL ITS NOT AS BAD AS THE CRETICS MAKE IT SOUND. ITS A MUST HAVE FOR ANY COLLECTION OR IF YOU JUST STARTING YOU COLLECTION. THIS MOVIE WAS MADE FOR TEENS NOT ADULTS SO DONT BE UPSET IF YOU ARE AN ADULT, YOU CAN STILL WATCH AND LAUGH. GREAT MOVIE I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.
0880389052|5.0|Not to say that R.A. hasn't written some amazing books--but for me, Homeland is my absolute favorite. I won't give you any spoilers, but if you ever liked elves, or, for that matter, great characters and action period, you should read it. I love fantasy and I have read it for years--but this is one of the only books I've ever read that I've never forgot about. It is one of the greatest books I have ever read--and that includes books from Christie Golden, J.R.R. Tolkien, Elaine Cunningham, etc. You really feel as though you are looking through Drizzt Do'Urden's eyes. Drizzt is a young drow (dark elf) living in a sceity that has cast away all compassion and morals--e.g., it is perfectally alright for you to stab your brother in the back when he's not looking--as long as you're not caught. Males have a very subordinate role to females in the story--and Drizzt, being the third-born son, is not treated very kindly. But Drizzt, unlike his dark kindred, has a place for caring, sadness, disgust and horror at the ways of his people, and hope for a better life, in his heart. And when the person who matters most dearly to Drizzt is taken from him, he begins to wonder: can he live in a world that goes against everything he believes in? The prequel to Exile and Sojourn, this is a fabulous book that anyone who can read engish, should read. If you don't believe me, rent if from the library! This THE book for all fantasy lovers! Go Drizzt Do'Urden!
0679746048|4.0|Girl, Interrupted is the story of Susanna Kaysen, who voluntarily checked herself into MacLean Hospital for a two year stay in 1967.<BR>Susanna describes hospital life, her fellow inmates, the nurses, the doctors, and the staff with unemotional clarity.  The reader is given an inside look at life in a mental institution as Susanna is checked in, diagnosed, and undergoes treatment for her &quot;borderline personality&quot; diagnosis.<BR>It was a very interesting read, but an unemotional one.  Ms. Kaysen writes about herself, and everyone else, with startling objectivity.  It almost reads as a case study, but a very interesting one.  The people in this memoir are very real.
B00003CWPL|5.0|I first saw this film in my teenage years and I was completely dumbfounded by it. In fact I sort of fell in love with it, if that isn't too weird.<BR>Somehow, if you approach watching this film in the right way, with the right kind of open mind, it will open a door inside you which leads to a place which is impossible to describe - but a place of intense emotion.<BR>This is not a film in which one should look for character development, dialogue and narrative. Throw any expectations along these lines out the window. What's more, if you consider these to be a 'must' as part of your viewing experience, don't even think of trying to watch a film like this.<BR>It is to be experienced rather in the same way that you would experience a painting on canvas or a piece of music. In my opinion, Eraserhead shows just how deeply you can be affected by the medium of film. <br />The feeling is pervasively dark and introverted.. here we see for the first time Lynch's trademark fascination for the nooks and crevices in ordinary suburban environments. We also see his now (in)famously ambiguous use of symbolism.<BR>Compared to his later films, this one seems far more abstract (a sparser plot and limited 'action') and yet somehow the message conveyed by symbols such as the mutant baby, the 'worms', the 'Lady in the Radiator' and 'the Man in the Planet' is more straightforward and easier to get to grips with than his more recent efforts in a similar vein (Lost Highway and Mulholland Drive). <br />Themes of isolation, sexuality, and the dehumanisation of industry are all there, but exactly how you fit them together to form the jigsaw of Henry's (the lead character) painful subective experience is largely left up to you. And in my opinion if you concentrate on trying to 'interpret' the film, or to 'understand' it, you will miss 99% of its visceral power.<BR>One could suggest that what Eraserhead is trying to do is to allow you to look nearly directly at your own (sub/un)conscious mind..<br/>And nearly 20 years after first seeing Eraserhead, I now own it on VHS and DVD (region 2) and it is just as incredible to watch the fifth or sixth time as the first. A particularly noteworthy feature of owning the DVD is the clarity of the sound, which is an integral part of the overall experience.
B00005B36H|5.0|Simply an incredible album.  A reference rock recording...lyrics, musicianship even the presentation of the CD and jewelcase are outstanding.  Top 5 greatest albums ever for me.
B00005NWM3|5.0|If you like Creed, you'll LOVE Nickelback.  Same song/music/lyric/message format as Creed.  I HIGHLY recommend this CD!  You won't be disappointed!  I have recommended it to several of my friends, now I am recommending it to all of you!
B0000640VO|5.0|This was one of the greatest movies I have ever seen.  It is sweet, romantic, and oh so funny.  You will watch this movie with a big smile on your face; and it will make you want to move to France.  After this movie, you will become a regular \\"do-gooder\\" yourself.<BR>ENJOY!
B000063UR2|5.0|This is one of those movies that when first viewing years ago it was apparent the studio had chopped it rather heavy-handed. The film was a half-step away from being a very good fantasy. Like the box set of all versions of Brazil on lazer disc this DVD gives you both the studio cut version and Ridley Scott's original concept. Wouldn't it be nice if this option had been available for so many films in the past? Welles Magnificent Ambersons for example. Now we have Scott's film as it was meant to be. Lucky us.<br />The film is full of extraordinary shots and scenes. Even a little humor thrown in. Tim Curry makes a great devil and Mia Sara's being sucked into the dark side is marvelous. If the film has any drawbacks at all it would be the choice of Tom Cruise as the lead. I like Tom Cruise but I had just seen Risky Business and it was hard to see him as this Puckish character. Hmm . . I wonder if the success of Risky Business is the reason they changed the sound track music to Tangerine Dream? <br />Great visuals, great devil, cute fairy, nasty demons. You should love it!
B0000668IF|5.0|Ome musn't search for a particular genre in this album; there is but a feeble touch of electronica, the rest is simply music. All the people who say \\"I dont listen to techno\\" may regard this album is merely another techno album. I must admit I often adhere to a specific genre in a CD, but in this case I just set back and enjoyed the music. Some songs have those Rock lyrics that you can't rid your head of, others have neo-classical souches as in [Play]. Vocals range from almost euphoric chanting to \\"Golden Era\\" style debuts, with the jazz-type piano in the background. Some songs are calm, other building with energy - just asking you to humm along. <br />In conclusion, this is a brilliant album. You simply listen and do whatever you please, it is not designed for dancing, or relaxing; it was not designed it was just made for the sake of artistic expression, a reflection of the soul, an image of the passions...
0451450523|5.0|I bought this book having been a fan of the movie since I can remember.  Though some might say that unicorns are for children, at 22, I can still read this book over and over, and never be tired of it.  Beagle's imagery and character development are fantastic.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good fairy-tale style fantasty story, but I recommend to primarily to anyone who has only seen the movie.  While the movie itself is also wonderful, the book offers so, so much more.<br />The novel changes perspective several times.  After the unicorn's meeting with Schmendrick the Magician much of the story is told through Schmendrick's point of view, it seems (in contrast to the movie, where the story is almost entirely told from the point of view of the unicorn).  The book is very emotional, and the character development is supurb.  Some things left out from the movie are the magician's background, and the story of the town of Hagsgate.  <br />There are still parts of this book that ring in my head long after I read it.  In a good way, that is.
B00003CXI1|5.0|Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone...features an all British cast of pro-actors. Suprisingly, Daniel Radcliff did a wonderful job of playing Harry Potter, and I thought he would be too young to do it! The movie has the exact same story as the book, brought to life with some of the best special effects I've ever seen. The sentret part is awesome.<br />This is just the beginning of the 7-part Harry Potter saga, so we still have 6 years to go. Let's hope it dosen't fade away by then...
6305648522|5.0|Of all the Italian movies that have been released in recent times, this ranks as one of the best, and is certainly superior to Il Postino. The 2 films are similar, with the protagonist being a young boy/man with artistic leanings who learns from an older mentor. In this case, the story is the celebration of a boy's love for cinema in an isolated Sicilian town. Sounds simple, and it is,but OH WHAT A MOVIE!!! If you are a lover of Italy or cinema or both, don't miss this! Also a great score by Ennio Morricone (The Mission, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly).

B000003KMM|5.0|My list of favorite movies is long, and spans the entire spectrum of genre, from cool indies (City of Lost Children, Snatch, The Apostle, El Mariachi) to blockbusters (for my dollar, it doesnt get any better than predictably awesome films like Gladiator, Gone in 60 Seconds) to classics (Apocalypse Now, Dog Day Afternoon) but without question, the movie I have seen the most, that my buddies and I know every line and every scene by heart (we can even speak along with the Japanese grounds workers at the field) is Major League.  I can't quantify this with any line of reasoning, only that, in the simplest terms, this movie kicks ...
6303282237|5.0|How delighted I am that one of my all time favorite movies has finally been released in DVD so it can be seen by those who were not even born when it was made.  But there are a few things I need to say about it, for them and for others. First, it's NOT history, nor is it a filmed version of &#34;El Poema del mio Cid&#34; as I discovered, 40 years ago when, fresh from having seen it 3 times in rapid succession, I turned to that great epic poem. What it is, is a filmed version of another classic work of art &#34;Le Cid&#34;, a play by the 17th century French playwright Pierre Corneille (easily recognized when one realizes that the heroine's name &#34;Chimene&#34; is the French version of the Cid's wife's name, &#34;Jimena&#34;. Indeed, last spring I saw another version of the same work as a 19th century opera by Jules Massenet starring Placido Domingo as Rodrigo. In other words, it is a work of art based on other works of art, not on history. And all art takes license. However, with that caveat in mind, the film contains some really wonderful things, especially in the visual area. Although trained as a historian of Baroque art, I have a sub-specialty in and grand passion for medieval art. And what we see in El Cid has surprising elements of reality. What we see is what I believe late 11th or early 12th century Spain might have been like (with some intrusions from later medieval or even later). Spain at that time was one of the most artistically advanced countries in Europe, in both its Christian and Moorish areas. I'm not a specialist in medieval weapons so I can't really comment on the armor and swords ... But I can comment favorably on most of the mural decorations used throughout, on the scene in the chapel as clerics pray over the body of King Ferdinand and on the costumes and jewelry worn by Genevieve Page as Princess Urraca. There are many compelling scenes. Among them are the march of the African troops along the seacoast and the wonderful panoramas of Spanish landscape. I agree that there is a lack of chemistry between Sophia Loren and Charlton Heston in many of their scenes together, but, when apart, I think they give good performances (especially Ms. Loren, who was at the height of her astonishing beauty). And I still confess to having a lump in my throat during the final scenes, as the mounted &#34;corpse&#34; is led out to ride at the head of the army. This picture has been a favorite of mine since I was 13 and it will always remain so. It is great to be able to see the clear and beautiful movie I saw repeatedly in the spring and summer of 1962.etween Sophia Loren and Charlton Heston in many of their scenes together, but, when apart, I think they give good performances (especially Ms. Loren, who was at the height of her astonishing beauty).

B0000668IF|4.0|again, moby does the unexpected dont be surprised about anything on this record. \\"We're all made of stars\\" the first single of the disc, poorly represents the album but then again, what song could ever properly represent all of these unique songs?

B000002WPI|5.0|This is by far the best rap cd in the world.  All 12 of these tracks are just unbelieveable.  I have listened to this cd so many times that I had to by another copy because the other one warped cuz I played it too much.  It has the beats and for sure it has the lyrics.  If you listen to the words the metaphors and similes just amaze you.  You can't go wrong with purchasing this Classic.  It is the best Wu-Tang Cd, the best rap CD, and the best CD ever made.  And to the 10 people on this website that gave this CD 1 star,  this is not a WILL SMITH album.  It's not that weak...  It rugged lyrics and rugged beats.  Don't ever in your life compare Wu-Tang to Will Smith, Vanilla Ice, or MC Hammer.  What the hell are you thinking?

B00005JKED|4.0|If you don't like Denzel Washington or Ethan Hawke, don't worry, because this isn't their typical movie. If you're anything like me, you'll laugh out loud as the ironic nature of Denzel Washington's character, which is, a laid back narcotics officer which reminds me of Vic Mackey from The Shield. Ethan Hawke gives a beleivable performance, bringing his rookie cop on the rise to life. This wasn't cinematic excellence, but it was certainly worth watching and it raised serious questions about the purpose of law enforcement.
0345350499|4.0|I enjoyed the TNT miniseries and bought Mists, and was overall very pleased. I was never all that interested in the tales of Camelot until I read this book. Now, I want to read other perspectives of life at the Round Table. There were a few little things about the book that bothered me, though: <BR>1) I agree it was too slow in parts, especially since I'm more of an action/adventure buff. Expect more of a medieval soap opera from Mists.<BR>2) Many have panned the book based on its religous views. I did not find them offensive, though as a Pagan I was put off by the theme of &quot;when Christians follow the will God of even when it goes against their own desires, it's bad; when Pagans follow the will of the Goddess even when it goes against their own desires, it's good&quot; in the end, both groups end up as different sides of the same coin, rather contrasting the two religions.<BR>3) the historical liberties taken were sometimes irritating, especially at the end, but overall they were intriuging.<BR>Despite all this, this book cast a spell over me, was spiritually uplifting, and I will definately read it again.
B00005JL3A|5.0|this movie has been torn apart by viewers and critics and i just cant stand it! this movie wasnt that bad! its got great music (not the slipknot crap but the instrumental pieces are great!) one thing i was disapointed about was the complete story change from the game to this! its practically noting like it except for the fact of flesh eating zombies. if this film was based on the novel by S.D. Perry it would have been amazing but they decided to go original. its still a great movie but i just wish it was based on the novelization done for the first game! the thing i was very happy with was the ending. its not sad but its not good. its got the perfecvt lead off to a sequel. i only hope its based off of either resident evil 2 or resident evil 3: nemesis. if so, its gonna rock!
B000002JOH|4.0|Pantera may very well be the very first nu metal band. The Exhorder influenced Texans have the Staccato riffs, the pseudo macho man vocals and attitude to boot. But there is a difference folks, and that is: Pantera know how to play their instruments! From Hardcore influenced sludging mayhem, to grungy ballads, its all here, but done with passion and panache. Some of the lyrics are funny and ironic (like the ones promoting racial harmony when half of Pantera's shirts have the confederate flag) but we can't always hold that against them. I just rebought this album and realizing its ten years old now (gasp!) I see how mainstream metal has come a long way (down). This should be considered a classic, keeping thrash/modern metal alive in the early nineties while Metallica and others started to churn out garbage.
B000002IOJ|4.0|Testament were part of a thriving metal scene that was happeining during the 80's in the Bay Area. At one point Testament were part of the big three, which also included Metallica and Megadeth, but with Slayer's satanic lyrics, Testament were sort of left behind. Being left behind can be a good thing sometimes, the boys from Testament, who had already released New Order and The Legacy a few years back, took their time and used all their skills to produce what should've been the Master Of Puppets of '89. <br />Practice what you preach sounds alot like unreleased songs from Master of Puppets sessions. Don't get me wrong though, I like Testament because they make good music regardkless of the comparisons. We have the monster title track and the hauntingly beautiful The Ballad. If you are interested in 80's thrash metal, than make sure you pick this one up. I would say it's on the same level as any Sepultura, Metallica or Megadeth album.   Some thought this might even outsell Metallica's Master of puppets, or at least help them break into the music market, but sadly too few took notice of this gem.  <br />Testament would peak here. Their bext album Souls of black contained much filler, contrary to this album, and the following album The Ritual is regarded as Testament's Black Album.  Practice what you preach is the heaviest and most well rounded album Testament have ever done, so start with this one.
B00005JKCF|5.0|Spider-Man - A name in the minds of every American this week.  And it isn't difficult to figure out why.  In it's first weekend Spider-Man grossed over $114 million, the first movie to ever break $100 million in its first three days.  The film is well on its way to become the fastest film to $200 million, a title currently held by Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace, which arrived at the total in 13 days.<br />40 years ago two men began a comic book character that would become a legacy.  Steve Ditko drew the Amazing Spider-Man, while the more popular Stan Lee, who has a cameo appearance in the movie, wrote the comic book.  Spider-Man's alter ego, Peter Parker, is a character that people can relate to, which is what has made the comic book so popular.  Spider-Man on the other hand was always misunderstood and made mistakes, which set him apart from all other comic book heroes.<br />It is an amazing treat to see Tobey Maguire as Spider-Man, swinging through the streets of New York.  As with any hero, there comes a villain, and Spider-Man has the ultimate villain, the Green Goblin, played spectacularly by Willam Dafoe.  The two super humans go face to face in a battle of wits and strengths, challenging each other's minds and morals.<br />The special effects, supervised by John Dykstra who also supervised the special effects on the pioneer special FX movie, Star Wars, were seamless and out of this world.  As Spider-Man swings from one skyscraper to another, as the Green Goblin flies through the air on his glider, the finished effects are beautiful and virtually undetectable.  I was in awe of the wizardry of visual treats that make up the movie that is Spider-Man.<br />The character relationships in the movie were surprisingly straight forward with the comic book world that they came from.  They were interesting enough without taking too much out of the action of the movie, and the action wasn't too much to take away from the story.  The action was top notch, Spider-Man's actions did not seem too over the top yet he seemed to be characteristic of a man with super human strengths, senses, and reflexes.  The fact the Peter Parker had organic web shooters opposed the classic mechanical web shooters he has had in the comic books for the past 40 years only added to the realism of the movie and helped his character in the story line.<br />With Spider-Man now in the top 100 box-office success films in only the first week, I feel confident that it will continue up the ranks to the top ten in not any longer than two months.  The movie began with a bang and will continue to do so throughout its theatre release until it comes out onto video.  With actors and crew signed on for a second installment and a third in talk people can only wonder what's to come.  I for one will be in line once again on opening day to see what will be.<br />Written Friday, May 10, 2002<BR>Spider-Man (R), Green Goblin (R), the characters, (R) & (C) 2002 Marvel Characters, Inc.
B00003CX5P|3.0|If there's one thing George Lucas know how to do best is to take money from his fans.  The old Star Wars movies aren't available on DVD yet.  This leaves one to wonder why he's realeasing the new one's now instead of the old ones.  Reason being: after Episode III is made (2005) he's going to release all six Star Wars movies in a 6 pack on DVD, and I'm sure that's the only way we'll be able to get the old ones on DVD.  That'll be after we've already bought \\"Phantom Menace\\" and \\"Attack of the Clones.\\"  It's just George's way of sucking his last red cent out of his true Star Wars fans.  So wait for the over priced six pack in 2005 and don't let him take anymore of your hard earned money.  Until then just rent it if you want to watch it.
B00005RY7X|5.0|Andrew W.K is an amazing cd! It makes you wanna get up and party. Unlike alot of hard rock bands and artists, this cd has a positive attitude while still maintaining the heavy sound. It's a great album that keeps you head banging but cheers you up!
B00005JKCF|5.0|The movie started and right off the bat you could tell it was going to be an entertaining flick.  It doesn't focus to much on the story between Mcguire and Dunst.  Instead it substitutes with action and special effects that are amazing.  This is just a fun movie, don't expect to much of a plot and don't expect to see any major awards being shelled out to this or anyone involved (special effects team excluded).  Spider-man is what summer movies are made of lots of fun, lots of action, and lots of special effects.  Great summer flick.
6300183211|1.0|Pacino started over-acting with this role, and he's never calmed down since. The beautifully underplayed and nuanced performances like his Micael Corleone were regrettably never to be seen again from here on out. De Palma does what he can with the material. What totally sinks this movie is Oliver Stone's piece-of-junk script. It is just an awful screenplay. Oliver Stone is a lousy writer anyway, but he's even lousier than usual with this movie. I so wanted to enjoy this film, and I couldn't believe how bad it was, and couldn't believe that it was ever funded to begin with.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I heard a Norah Jones song on TV, which compelled me to hear more of her songs. I was blown away by how good this lady is, and I've played her CD to 3 people. <br />The worst review? \\"She's pretty good.\\" <br />I haven't found anyone who doesn't like it. This CD is perfect for listening while relaxing with a glass of wine, or is just as fitting for romantic occasions. She reminds me of Nina Ferro, Diana Krall and Nena Semone all rolled into one--a mixture of jazz, blues, and soft rock. My favorites songs are: Don't Know Why, Turn Me On, Feelin' The Same Way, and Shoot The Moon, but there is simply not a bad song on this CD. You won't have to skip a single song, because you'll hear great music and a great voice from start to finish. Buy this CD; you won't regret it.
B00003CXUM|5.0|\\"In the Mood for Love\\" is simply one of the most beautiful films of the last several years.  I cannot praise this film enough - the plot is at once simple and complex, the characters are both real and heartfelt, and the images are powerful and elegant.  There really are so many positive things to say about this film, I'll try and hit the highlights for you.  <br />The acting is superb - both Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung give impeccable performances filled with subtle emotion.  They radiate a quietly powerful intensity that is so lacking is a great number of film stars today.  <br />The story moves in ways both expected and surprising.  The pacing is wonderful as the story unfold slowly before you.  They're none of the lighting fast cuts and manic pacing of most films.  It's a slower film for a patient audience willing to wait for their just rewards.  The overall design of the film with the use of color and wardrobe stunned me with it's rich simplicity.  The same can be said of the photography - rich with nuance (the way the shots are framed is remarkable) and feeling.  <br />With \\"In the Mood for Love\\" Wong Kar-Wai has become one of the most skilled directors of our time with this film, proving that \\"Happy Together\\" (another brilliant film) wasn't a fluke.  The Criterion Collection edition of the film is a two disc set that has an astonishing number of extras.  After watching the film once, I watched the extras - then immediately watched the film again with a fresh eye to see how the entire thing was put together.  I was truly impressed.
B00005OAIE|5.0|Nowadays, music snobs like to bash anything that's mainstream, from pop (N'Sync) to rock (Creed).  That's all fine, but when you start bashing John Mayer... it's time to reevaluate what you're listening to.  Although I like mainstream rock like Matchbox 20, The Dave Matthews Band, and Incubus... I'm not a humongous rock fan.  Being that I'm more inclined towards R&amp;B/jazz more than anything else, I don't rush out to buy rock albums.  But when I heard &quot;No Such Thing&quot;, it sounded like Dave Matthews covering a Michael Franks song.  The melodic chord changes and cool vocals is what caught my attention.  When I bought &quot;Room For Squares&quot;, I was bombarded by lite acoustic rock with jazz overtones.  It was pure genius.  John is barely past drinking age and he put out this brilliant debut.  And I'm not talking about the lyrics.  It's all about the music for me, because if you don't have the musicality, it's not worth listening to in the first place.  My top 5 are &quot;No Such Thing&quot;, &quot;Y.B.I.A.L.&quot;, &quot;Neon&quot;, &quot;City Love&quot;, and &quot;Saint Patrick's Day&quot;.  The only thing about John Mayer I have a problem with is the voice similarity to Dave Matthews.  Much thanks to the reviewers of this album for the constant comparisons.  Now I keep picturing Dave singing everytime I hear the album...
B000002HPV|5.0|Excellent CD!  Bjork's talent is remarkable.  This CD contains arrangements of classical music, techno music, and industrial music, all tastefully done.  Each style of music is hemmed up with Bjork's challenging lyrics and intense vocal capabilities.  Each song is filled with its own feelings, imagery, and emotions; Bachelorette for instance, &quot;I'm a tree that grows hearts.  One for each that you take.  You're the intruder sent.  I'm the branch that you break...&quot;  Homogenic will intrigue and captivate even the most disinterested ears.
6304415346|5.0|It would not be right for me to review a Star Trek: The Next Generation (TNG) movie without first making a disclaimer: I am very bias. I love TNG, and it would be almost impossible for them to make a movie that I wouldn't absolutely love.<br />That being said, I also believe that Star Trek: First Contact is, hands down, much better than the previous TNG movie. After being affiliated with the TNG cast and crew for almost a decade, Jonathan Frakes knows how to direct the cast and provide us with a movie that is thouroughly enjoyable.<br />This movie introduces us to the Borg Queen, the order behind the chaos. The TNG series never hinted toward a queen, or that, in a sense, there is a leader to the scourge drones of the galaxy. But after watching Alice Krige portray the Borg Queen, you'll want to stand up and beg to be assimilated into her collective.<br />There is little in Star Trek: First Contact that requires you to be familiar with the TV series, other than knowing that at one time Captain Picard had been assimilated into the Borg as they tried to take over Earth. But the movie does a good job with explaining that to you, along with anything else you need to know.<br />A good movie with great casting. The string of even numbered Star Trek movies being the best is still intact (true Trekkies will know what that means).
B00000099Y|4.0|OK, i'll admit that im a guy that just jumped on the Tool bandwagon.  i enjoy their music more than any metal act ive ever heard, because he can actually sing and there are actually melodies. i think one reviewer put it as &quot;metal that mozart would have made&quot; or something.  but i first fell in love with Lateralus, and that is still my favorite tool cd by far. but seeing all of these stellar reviews as one of the greatest albums ever, i picked it up, and some of the songs were good, but some of them were just kind of blending in with one another. i like tool's experimentation and whatnot on lateralus... the slow parabol gradually creeping and then exploding into parabola, or the awesome drum solo in ticks and leeches.  but this CD has a bunch of great songs, and &quot;eulogy&quot; is my favorite song after giving the whole album many repeated listenings.  i guess the reason why everyone hails aenima as thier best is because that was the time that most people jumped onto the tool bandwagon- and the first tool album experience is always the best.  for me its lateralus- i just like the style of that album better. but believe me, this is a great album, still one of the best of the 90's, and definately one of the top metal albums ive ever heard.  but i think that tool has evolved as a band more and more as time has progressed.
630577241X|5.0|a must for all...... classic comedy, laughs and a real great story..
B000001DTM|2.0|OK. Maybe not. There's some OK stuff here. No songs though. It's probably better than Pop. It's certainly better than Enya. Bono chooses not to sing this time out, and the rest of the band tries to compensate with effects. It doesn't work.
B00005JKMQ|4.0|Starring Will Smith as Mohammad Ali, this film tries to do a lot. It especially answers the question as to why Ali has become such a famous American personality. Ali was unique in challenging some strong preconceived notions of what was appropriate for a world champion.  And his relationship with Malcolm X and the Nation of Islam made him extremely controversial.  He was a braggart, full of ego and not a very likeable person. But, after all, he was a boxer.  And this is all part of the game.<br />There are a lot of fighting sequences in the film.  They're shot from a wide variety of angles, including close-ups of gloves or shoulders or feet.  It gives the impression of being right there in the ring and part of the action and I found myself wincing at the blows.  I couldn't always tell who was hitting who however, and perhaps that was the director's intent.  These were over-long in spite of the realism.<br />I enjoyed the parts or the film which explained Ali's conversion to Islam. And I was glad the film didn't pull any punches about the politics of how he was banned and then re-instated into the religion.  Will Smith did a competent job as Ali, but it was rare when his face could register a significant range of emotion.  More successful was Jamie Foxx, cast as one of Ali's trainers.  He was the center of every scene he was in. Jon Voight played the late Howard Cosell and his scenes with Ali were excellent.  The three women in Ali's life, played by Nona Gay, Jada Pinkett Smith and Michel Michele all managed to put their own personalities into small roles that could have easily been stereotyped.<br />The Mohamed Ali depicted in this film is somewhat of a hero.  I can't say personally whether or not this is true.  But the film is enjoyable to watch and moved quickly through its 2 hours and 38 minutes.  It did need smoother transitions between episodes however.  And I would have liked to know more about Ali's Islamic faith.  Also, there was certain sameness to all of Ali's opponents.  Perhaps the fact that all these questions surfaced in my own mind about Ali and his career is one of the strengths of the film. It left me yearning to know more.  I give this film a mild recommendation as an introduction to the world of Mohammed Ali.li's opponents.  Perhaps the fact that all these questions surfaced in my own mind about Ali and his career is one of the strengths of the film. It left me yearning to know more.

0671004107|5.0|\\"Contact\\" came to my attention after watching the film, which I dearly love. As books are usually better than films I was elated to finally settle in and begin the journey. I will say that the book and movie are dramatically different in many respects and I love both for different reasons, but this novel surpasses the film in a great many of those respects.<BR> <BR>Just short of the new Millennium (1999), the Earth receives its first message from intelligent life in outer space. Ellie Arroway is the romantic, ambitious scientist at the center of Sagan's tale and her personal struggles and beliefs, as well as those of her colleagues, magnify the sentiments of the world around them. They are faced with meeting a new alien intelligence, new tests of faith, many of which they would've never expected within the realms of science, and they must come to terms with their new knowledge in order to make sense of an ever-changing world.<BR> <BR>How would a society react to such a realization of life beyond our planet, how would it affect the everyday lives of those involved, and how would it change the way science and religion function? All of these questions are addressed in Sagan's staggering, uplifting, poignant piece of fiction.<BR> <BR>Steeped in technical and scientific terms, the book is challenging, but incredibly fulfilling. I came away from the last page with a deep sense of satisfaction, awe, and a great regard for Sagan's method of bringing science to the masses. This book really makes you evaluate the harmony of science and faith and points out that the two, indeed, can work together.
0393317552|4.0|Good premise but it glaringly fails to notice or mention the fact that all these poor countries of the modern world have inhabitants that have a lower genetic I.Q. All black nations in the world are economic basketcases. All per capita for these black citizens in these countries is below $800 a year and some are as low as $300. It is good in that it makes you think how nature and geography allow certain things. My premise is that all these wonderful inventions, seeds, and domesticated animals are due to a higher average I.Q. And that lower intelligenced people fail to develpoe these things. I mean potatoes came from the New World and allowed Ireland to have a vast population explosion. Potatoes are a great crop and the New World had these not the Europeans. The Incas failed to develope the wheel! Now unless there is a wheel tree in Europe that drops down fully made wheels this author is streching things a whole bunch. This book allows Liberals to not delve into the subject to much except for his slanted book and then convince themselves the liberal Paradigm still works. Bell curve read it before this.
B00005IC2H|5.0|The reviewer below who gave this one star doesn't know what he's talking about. This is tied with Blackwater Park by Opeth as THE most progressive CD of 2001. Sigur Ros have created a style of their own that nobody can copy. It doesn't sound like Enya. It doesn't sound like Bjork. The most accurate description I've heard of what it sounds like is &quot;God crying his head off in Heaven.&quot; Every second of this masterpiece is sad yet beautiful, blasting Kid A (although a fine album) out of the water. The vocalist/guitarist and bassist are especially great, adding the most emotional force to the music. Yet another great thing about this is studio musicians that actually sound like part of the band. The horns on &quot;Ny Batteri,&quot; the violins on &quot;Straatlfur,&quot; and especailly the flute solo on &quot;Olsen Olsen&quot; sound like someone in the band picked up one of those instruments and started playing. Such is the harmony of this opus.<br />If you like powerful, emotional music, do not hesitate to pick this up. If you like Celtic music that isn't &quot;repetative,&quot; then listen to Enya and traumatize yourself in the process.
B00005UKE0|1.0|The star is for \\"My Sweet Lord\\", a good song. He always was good for a song or two per album. It would've been nice if the rest of these songs had been written (or more importantly sung) by real artists like John or even Paul. Sadly, George is in control here. Most people know the jams are a joke. At least they're a joke you don't have to hear in George singing voice. The Beatles were the greatest band of all time. The solo Beatles were great sometimes. Try Plastic Ono Band, Imagine, Milk And Honey, Double Fantasy. In that order. P.S.  BOYCOTT REMASTERS!
0064409422|5.0|Years after having read the book as a child, I still enjoy reading C.S. Lewis' clever tale about four children stumbling into an enchanted world, hidden behind the mysterious wardrobe-portal in a musty old mansion.  The light reading is also distinguished by subtle humor in places, as well as thoughtful images and allegories that point to Christianity.  Altogether the book is a marvelous blend of fantastic mythical creatures and imagery, with a little heroism tossed in.
B00005JKJA|5.0|WOW! What can I say? This is one whacked out movie. But at the same time you can't take your eyes off it. It's so good once you start to piece things together on your own. This is one movie that you'll relive in your head over and over and still not be able to make sense of it all.
0061020680|5.0|There are so many \\"best\\" books in the Discworld series. Some are best because of their humour. Some are best because of their message. Some are best of their concept/idea (Reaper Man, The Truth). Some are best because of their sheer ridculousness. Some are best because of their cleverness (Feet of Clay) Some are best for their darkness (Thief of Time). This is probably one of the best for a mixture of several of these, the main two being its humour and idea. <br />It may not exactly be THE best (in my mind that one will always be The Truth) but it is probably in the top five. Death has always been my favourite character, and to see him have his own ook (and for the first time) is quite an event, and very enjoyable. His comments always contain such dry, unintended wit on his part, and the irony often brought to the fore with the use of his character can be hialrious. (I particularly liked the scene where he was telling somebody that \\"the affairs of men are not decided by chance\\". And as this man disagreed, he challenged him to throw a dice. \\"What if I win?\\" says the man. \\"THEN YOU'VE WON\\" says Death. \\"What if i loose?\\" \\"THEN YOU'LL WISH YOU'D WON\\". Comes death's reply.)<br />Mort is a great character, who i would have loved to see more of in future books. His developing relationship with Ysabell is at times touching. <br />There are so many wonderful elements of this book. The romance. Death loose trying to be human. The revelations concerning Alberts past. The explanations as to the mechanics of history. The way Pterry shows to us the Realm of Death. Among many other things. <br />This is a series of books that no reader (of whatever genre. i myself detest most schi-fi/fantasy, and much prefer crime/thriller. But this series has grown to become one of my favourites of all time) should ever pass by. There is such a rich casket of wonders presented to you in all 26 (so far) of his Discworld novels. And this is one of the real gems, along with The Truth, Soul Music, Reaper Man, Men At Arms, Carpe Jugulum, and Feet of Clay.
0792842723|5.0|Goldeneye is awesume but not the best movie but a good movie.<BR>It is a good new Bond. Brosnan is the second best bond after Connery, so see this movie.
0792151712|1.0|They spent two hundred million on the effects, you'd think they could have spent a couple of bucks on a plot. The dialogue and storyline were written for pre-pubecent girls. The three plus hours seemed like three years. I was thinking how great the movie could have been if DiCaprio would have pushed Winslett in the water at the beginning, or maybe if Winslett had slipped with the axe and severed Leo's skull. The gall of turning such a horrible tragedy into a ridiculous love story. Cameron should be ashamed of himself.
B00005B5L4|5.0|A classic album with well-known tracks and a bonus track, this is enhanced by surround sound, increased detail, and lower noise than the original. If you have the equipment, it's well worth the price.
B000059QYB|4.0|I tend to migrate towards greatest hits cd's and this is one time where it really paid off. Idol has a nice catalog of hits that it makes for a fun listen. The songs really don't offer any insightful advice or make you search for a deeper meaning but they're fun nontheless.
B00005OAIE|5.0|That is what John Mayer has, besides his talented guitar playing and smokey soothing voice.  His lyrics are not the usual pap you hear in pop music these days.  The words themselves are simple, but strung together as John does, they are surprisingly new and definitely evocative.  They tell me about him, but also evoke memories and thoughts of how my own life has gone.  I'm 55 years old, and to hear such a young man be able to talk about life and living as profoundly and poetically as John does is refreshing and amazing.  <br />For me, it's important to try to get to know the artist as a person as much as one can through listening to his music, interviews, etc.  Because then the music becomes more real, more meaningful.  With John, I feel like he's in the same room, talking to me as a friend.  I have a 20 year old son who is going through very similar emotions, choices, and experiences as John.  And it brings a smile to my face to hear it all put into words and music so beautifully and simply.<br />There isn't a single track on this CD that's not terrific.  It's difficult to pick a favorite, but 83, Why Georgia, and Wonderland come to mind first, I guess.  But truly, the entire album has become my favorite.  I've listened to nothing else since purchasing it a month ago.  Buy it.  You won't regret it.  And, John, don't wait 3 or 4 years for the next one!
0792151712|1.0|There wasn't one likeable character in the whole movie. If maybe Leo had only let her jump in at the beginning of the movie it would have been a little more tolerable. I remember thinking when are they going to hit the damn iceberg anyway? What I found most unrealistic was that Billy Zanes character would waste his time chasing that miserable brat around the ship.

Granted you pretty much have to be into these kind of movies to like it (it's NOT a date movie), this is more of a rainy day on the couch under a blanket kind of movie.  The music, the visuals, and each character's swirling emotions drag you in.  Emma Thompson did an awesome job writing this screenplay!  Each character was well-developed (except the now you see him, now you don't Willoughby), and each actor did an excellent job bringing their characters to life.  If you like this sort of movie, don't pass this one up!

038533558X|5.0|Murder, drug trafficking, old friendships, and mafia-like connections are but a few elements that tie together to make this a thriller until the final paragraph. <br />Growing up in northern New Jersey, Will Klein had always admired his older brother Ken. But Ken has been gone for eleven years, presumably dead, after he was accused of murdering Wills former girlfriend, Julie Miller. On her deathbed, Wills mother, Sunny, confesses that Ken is alive and shows Will a recent photograph of Ken. <br />Not sure where to turn, Will seeks solace in his relationship with girlfriend, Sheila Rogers, a volunteer at Covenant House, a NYC runaway shelter where Will works alongside his friend and yoga guru, Squares. And when Sheila turns up missing with the FBI hot on her tracks, Wills world is turned upside down. Kens former neighborhood buddies, John Asselta, the Ghost, and Philip McGuane enter the picture with their violent desire to locate Ken. <br />Believing his brother to be innocent, Will embarks on a quest to locate Ken as well as the missing Sheila. What he does uncover is devastating evidence that everything he has always thought to be true is not at all what it seemed. <br />Mr. Cobens writing is straightforward, no flowery prose here. There is never-ending suspense as mysteries are unraveled and secrets are revealed. The relationship of the supporting characters to one another is like a puzzle that needs that missing piece before the picture is crystal clear.
B0000636UN|1.0|This album has been referred to as the sunnier counterpart to Crow's moodier epynomous second album, but _C'mon C'mon_ falls so short that no comparision can even be made. Frankly, it would be difficult to call _C'mon C'mon_ an album at all; it is filled with episodic duets ( with Lenny Kravitz, Stevie Nicks, Don Henley, etc) that showcase more Crow's popularity among her peers than any of the musical gusto she projected on her previous albums. Indeed, Crow sounds like a guest musician on her own tribute album: her trademark irony has been replaced with inane and frustrating lyrics. Admittingly, Crow's albums have never been consummate masterpieces, this can be easily excused, but this album is beyond all condonation. I cannot warn more strongly against the purchase of this album.
0141301104|5.0|I read the book called \\"The Witches\\" by Roald Dahl.  I'd say that this is one of the best books that I have ever read and that other people should share the experience I had too.  I gave this book the full five star rating because it was hard for me to put it down.  This is a somewhat rare thing for me due to the fact that I can't ever find a book that I qualify as a book worth reading.  The book had a good plot - it kept you interested from the first page to the last.  It was written so well that in the back of your mind you knew that this story could be true.  This book starts out with a little boy living with his grandmother in Norway because his parents had recently died in a car crash.  The grandmother starts telling the boy about witches to make him feel better and he is so intrigued that he won't let his grandmother stop talking.  She starts telling him about what you can look for to see if some one is a witch.  The grandmother tells him that there is a secret witch organization, run by the Grand High Witch.  And witches have only one thing in mind, to get rid of all the kids in the world!  One day the boy and his grandmother decide to go on a vacation to a wonderful hotel on the beach in England.  While they are there the boy discovers that Witches are having a secret meeting there led by the Grand High Witch herself.  He ends up inside the room along with all the witches in the meeting and he overhears a terrible plot to rid all of England from kids.  The boy can't let this happen, but then he gets caught.  To bad that this is all I'll say, but I guess you'll just have to read the book now, won't you.
0140187537|4.0|&#34;The Winter of our Discontent&#34; was published in 1961, just before Steinbeck received the Nobel Prize in 1962. The story is set in the late 1950s in New Baytown, a small (fictitious) New York -New England town which, Steinbeck tells us, had flourished during the whaling days of the mid-19th century. The main protagonist of the book is Ethan Allen Hawley. Ethan (&#34;eth&#34; to his friends is descended from early pirates and whaling captains. His family had lost its capital through speculative business ventures during WW II and Ethan, with his background and his Harvard education, is reduced to working as a clerk in a small grocery store he once owned. Marullo, an Italian immigrant, owns the store and calls Ethan &#34;kid&#34;.<br /><br />For a short novel, the book includes a wealth of characters, many of which I found well described. There is Ethan's wife Mary who is impatient with the family's impoverished lots and eager for Ethan's economic success as well as the couple's two children, Allen, who is writing an essay called &#34;Why I Love America&#34; and the sexually precocious daughter Ellen. We meet the town banker, Mr. Baker, a bank clerk and a friend of Ethan's, Margie Young-Hunt, twice married and the town seductress, and Danny Taylor, Ethan's childhood friend who has thrown away a career of promise and become a drunk.<br /><br />The book describes the deteriorations of Ethan's life as he gradually loses his integrity and succumbs to temptations to lift his life, and the lives of his family members, from its materially humble state to a state consistent with Ethan's felt family heritage and education and with the desire of his family for material comfort. The story is sad and told in a style mixing irony and ambiguity that requires the reader to reflect and dig into what is happening. The story ends on a highly ambiguous note with Ethan's future left in doubt.<br /><br />The book describes well the lessening of American standards and values.

B000002TWN|5.0|With all of the blatantly testosterone-driven, sex-obsessed r&b out lately I about gave up on the genre. That is until I heard this album. D took it back to the way it should be. The music is sensual, and romantic instead of bump-n-grind-inducing. This is the kind of music you not only hear and like, but this is the kind of music that you feel down in your soul and can become a part of you. D'Angelo's a real artist, not some mass-produced, pre-packaged, pop act to hit the top 40 and then drop off into anonymity. This is the real deal.
B000066C1N|5.0|Being an old Brian Adams fan, and, of course, a fan of Hans Zimmer, I can honestly say this CD is absolutely fantastic.  The music completely conveys the feeling of legend and magesty, as I am sure was the intent.  The lyrics and melodies intertwine to create something absolutely stunning.  Zimmer has outdone himself with this soundtrack and Brian Adams is going just as well as ever did.  Put the two together...and you've got a soundtrack that is every bit as good as the Lion King was...better, in most aspects.
B000002HAF|4.0|I've nearly scratched a bald spot in my head trying to figure out why this early stab in the dark is canonized as their most efficient hit to the jugular. I'll bet you every last one of your precious, unplayed Velvet Underground CDs gathering dust in a shoebox next to old Polaroids of girls with mall bangs and Depeche Mode T-shirts, that \\"Doolittle\\" gets much closer to the red stuff, and \\"Bossanova\\" positively sprays you in the face with it, gives your apartment's dingy walls a new paint job you won't be able to explain to your landlord.<br />And, yet, scraping away fourteen years' of fanzine praise from this thing is like having bought this album back in June '89 at  a Mobile, Alabama mom-and-pop shop run by a born-again Christian, and JUST NOW realizing that a coat of fundamentalist white-out's been covering up that topless senorita on what you THOUGHT all this time was just a plain white cover: You get a clear look at what really IS here. You marvel at the quiet perfection of these inconsequential little ditties that race out of your speakers, sucker-punch you in the nether-regions, and then vanish before you can limp over to the \\"repeat\\" button for an encore. You notice how Kim Deal's vocal backup is as indispensable to said ditties as her bass. You notice how \\"Where Is My Mind?\\" sounds even better bouncing off the apartment building outside your living room window than it does over the end credits of \\"Fight Club\\". And you notice how, after all these years, you STILL don't know what the hell these songs are about. And it's BETTER that way. The gooey surprise this album left on the nineties' doorstep wasn't some grand post-punk legacy, but rather the simple reminder that your lead singer can fit a four-point plan to end world hunger into two verses (and all before the guitar solo), but if you don't have basslines fatter than the noontime crowd at McDonald's or have a drummer whose beats kick like a fetus that's just learned it's being born to Andrea Yates, then you might as well sell your instruments to a high-school marching band, and open up a hubcap museum next to that Bible-collector in Mobile. How plentiful the number of bands that would tread over this doorstep in the 90's; how scarce the number that even bothered to notice what they'd stepped in.
B000000OAC|4.0|OK.There is some good stuff on this album : We Will Rock you and We Are The Champions are all-time rock classics.<br />I think Spread Your Wings is a fantastic inspirational song - unforgettable. There is the punk rock Get Down Make Love, the haunting  All Dead, All Dead , the angst-filled It's Late and the bluesy Melancholy Blues , which are also good.<br />But the album is not as good as Queen's first five masterpieces (which are among my favourite albums of all time: Queen , Queen II, Sheer Hear Attack,A Night At The Opera  and A Day At The Races .Its still worth having in your collection and it's still a hallmark of the roaring 70's , which is always a pleasure to listen to (Its also far better than 80's Queen) but it also marks a departure from Queen's classic rock-opera roots for which I most love the band. Of course musical fashions where changing by 1977 but for me Queen 1973-1976 are where it is at for the best rock music you can ever get!
B00005JKCF|5.0|From begining to end, I was kept on the edge of my seat during Spider-Man. It was a better movie than I expected it to be, and I plan to see it a couple more times. Tobey Maguire was the the perfect role as Spider-Man, and Kirsten Dunst was great as MJ. I was a little dissapointed in the end where Spider-Man didn't take<BR>the girl, but hopefully he will in the sequel; which I can wait<BR>for. It was a movie well worth the time and money.
B00003CX5P|5.0|While this film may not be the best in the Star Wars series, it is definitely a great way to begin the story. It brings back to life the old pleasures we remember from the original trilogy, but introduces us to new stories. <br />You must own this DVD.
B00003CXI0|5.0|The Harry Potter film was released on the 11th May over here in England. I hadn't seen it at the movies, and was eagerly anticipating it's release on video. It was worth the wait! <br />I had previously read the books, and was hoping the film wouldn't ruin it. Thankfully it didn't, as I can now imagine the characters when I read the books.<br />Daniel, Rupert and Emma were all brilliant considering their age. I can't wait for the next installment, both the movie and the book.
B0000668IF|4.0|Yeah, yeah, yeah, we've heard it all about Moby - marketing genious, musical Mozart, but is the album any good? It's great, if you don't expect anything radically different from his other album Play. The gospel women are here again, crying out, and Moby's in the background, meshing chords and electronic riffs to go with their voices. Tracks like \\"In This World\\" set the tone of the album right off. Moby was in a tough spot - if he had made this album too different, then we'd be complaining about how we don't recognize it. He has evolved, like Radiohead between their Kid A and Amnesiac albuums, in a steady and clear climb to the summit of his own brand (!) of music. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|I watched this movie for the first time a few weeks ago, and I still can't get it out of my head. It's a very rare movie that can [pull] me in, and drag me down with it as this film did. I felt completely drained at the end.<BR>Will I watch it again? Absolutely! Just as soon as I recover from the first viewing...
B0000668IF|4.0|I've enjoyed this album from the moments that I pressed the play button and I've found that it has the same replay value that Play has.  Much of what worked in Play returns, providing Moby with his unique sound, though the soul borrowed from old blue's toons are replaced with soulful female voices that echo from era of motown.  Perhaps the most surprising feature of this album to me was that it was able to maintain the depth of meaning that I have come to appreciate from Moby though one can simultaneously percieve that it was made to be just as successful as Play--reworking and improving upon what worked in the previous album.  If this album does lack anything, it's a spattering of more upbeat tracks.  Personally, I don't consider that to be Moby's strongpoint, so I appreciated the relaxed, soul feel that was kept throughout---with perhaps one exception, \\"Jam for the Ladies\\", which is a fun song featuring MC Lyte.
B00005Q45W|5.0|There are very few albums from which we can actually learn something.  Aside from John Stewart's, \\"Punch the Big Guy\\", I can recommend nothing else but this.<br />Leonard cohen does not just sing on this album.  He preaches; he preaches songs which we all need to hear.<br />And for those of you who need to hear a song which will make sence of a death close to ourselves, \\"Alexandra Leaving\\" may ease the pain. <br />\\"The Land of Plenty\\" should straighten us all out... Unfortunately, it won't.
B00005QZWI|5.0|Howard Shore definitly sets the tone for The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring. It brings the magic of J.R.R. Tolkien's fantasy world into beautiful music. It gives you the wondrous world of the hobbits, elves, and of course the evil Saruman. If you enjoyed the movie, this soundtrack is for you. It really deserves the title of best score in the 2002 Academy Awards.
B000056C6L|5.0|It's prog, it's psych, it's a bit of jazz, and Daevid's vocals are just fine!! The last two tracks are weirdly sublime and even scary, with Gilli's space whispers and the in-your-face lyrics she gets to utter. The sticker shock is an indicator that people have scarfed this album up since it came out -- thus driving up the price. Well? It's a shame, but if you don't get this I doubt they'll reissue again, or print another batch.
0930289455|4.0|I can't believe the artwork!  Brian Bolland did an amazing job with this book.  Its a wonderful study in facial expression.  Alan Moore wrote a good script, putting out a different take on the Joker.  Every writer tries to take The Joker to a new extreme.  Moore suceeds by avoiding gimmicks and gadgets, focusing on the motives and actions.   I gave it 4 stars since it was a little too short.  (That and shotting Barbara.)
0446310786|5.0|I first read this book when I was in the 8th grade (1960's).  I am an English teacher and have taught this book to 9th graders for 15 years.  This book has \\"turned on\\" so many of my students to reading.  The best compliment they give is, \\"The movie is great but the book is so much better!\\"  The lessons learned from TKAM are timeless:  racial, sexual, religious, social and economic discriminations; child abuse--both physical and sexual; superstitions that we let control our lives; \\"walking around in their skin\\" point of view.  This book should be read by both young and old.
B0000668IF|4.0|Inside the booklet that comes with the CD, Moby has written an essay (very similar to the essay that appears in the booklet for \\"Play\\") about religion, his beliefs, his record, etc.  It also says that he feels that this record is best listened to as a whole and to listen to it straight through.  And that I did.  The music in this CD is amazing.  Expect a lot of piano.  Expect a lot of orchestra.  It is great music to play when you're thinking about something or working.  Why do I say this?  Because the music is great but the lyrics are rarely there.  I find that on a few too many of the songs, (not all of them though) that they are hooks from gloomy old songs (gospel) repeated several times to beats and Moby's music.  If you have listened to \\"Play\\", you know what I'm talking about.  But those songs seem to have the most lifting music I have heard in a long time. And then there are the few songs with lyrical power.  \\"Sleep Alone\\", which is sung by Moby, is a reference to 9-11, \\"Harbour\\" by Sinead O' Connor is amazing, and \\"We Are All Made of Stars\\", which I'm sure you all have heard, are a few of them.  I recommend this to you if you like dark piano and orchestra lines and like to listen to old gospel hooks.  If you're looking for a collection that has a lot to say on every song but like the techno-ish music that Moby makes, try Madonna's \\"Ray of Light\\"
B00005QG9J|5.0|This cd is a breath of fresh inventive rock. the boys of Incubus have been reinventing their sound on every album they have ever made and frankly, i LOVE 'Morning View.' some fans think they have sold out and lost their old sound, i beg to differ. they lost the stoner rock/rap sound on 'S.C.I.E.N.C.E' when they adapted the hardcore metal sound. 'Make Yourself' was when they truely adapted into Brandon Boyd's thoughtful lyrics and soulfully sweet voice, the sounds match his words and on 'Morning View' it finally makes a perfect fit. anyone who wants a taste of Incubus in their prime, listen to this record. its refreshing, beautiful and overall INTENSE. blink, and you'll miss a beat...~*Chelsea*~
B000002C1W|2.0|Momentary lapse is a fine slice of delicious tunes from the pink floyd. Gilmours'girlfriend is the best lyricist the band has ever had. Forget lines like \\"all you touch and all you see is all your life will ever be\\" and \\"it's too late to lose the weight you used to need to throw around\\". When compared to the majestic poetry of a line such as \\"I will I will she sighed to my request and then she tossed her mane\\" those old lyrics seem like they were written by an ego maniac on some mid 70's binge. <BR>I want good, clean, safe product and thats what momentary lapse is.
B00005U1YO|4.0|&quot;Come With Us&quot; is indeed lacking in something. I can't completely tell what it is... it doesn't have the amazing polished production quality of &quot;Surrender.&quot; The songs might not immedietly jump out at you either, like songs of &quot;Surrender&quot; and &quot;DYOH&quot; might of had.<br />Is it just recycled old beats? One could complain this, and I'd agree half way with them -- there is really nothing new on this record. But the songs themselves are composed differently, and are of similar vein to &quot;DYOH&quot; and some of &quot;Surrender.&quot;<br />Soon as the first track starts, &quot;Come With Us,&quot; you'll immedietly know it's Chemical Brothers. The tense synthesized string arrangement sounds so much like them it's impossible to call it anything else but Chemical Brothers.<br />You'll have the tracks &quot;Come With Us,&quot; &quot;Star Guitar,&quot; &quot;The State We're In,&quot; &quot;My Elastic Eye,&quot; and &quot;The Test,&quot; which show at least some orignality... while the other tracks, although very excellent indeed, are either incredibly similar to older Chemical Brothers songs or slightly so.<br />This doesn't mean I dislike &quot;It Began In Afrika,&quot; which will grow on you, or &quot;Pioneer Skies,&quot; the beautiful &quot;Surrender&quot; like song, or even &quot;Hoops,&quot; with the fantastic sample, it's just that it's not completely original, and the stuff on &quot;Surrender&quot; was better anyway.<br />Even though I love &quot;Surrender&quot; and like it more than &quot;Come With Us,&quot; I'll admit that when I also first heard &quot;Surrender&quot; I was... to say the least, unimpressed. And it indeed grew on me. So this was basically the first opinion for &quot;Come With Us,&quot; and in about a year I know my opinion will change.<br />One more note: &quot;The Test&quot; and &quot;The State We're In&quot; are the two vocal collaborations, and both are beautiful. Nothing can get your day to start on a better note than listening to &quot;The Test.&quot;
B00004X0ER|3.0|Alright, these guys rock-no argument.  However, if you go back to the late eighties/early nineties you'll find some wicked examples of the Detroit/post-punk/garage sound.  Sweden's Union Carbide Productions were cranking out some serious Stooge-like mayhem, and Austrailia's Lime Spiders had the Marshall stack sound along with a vocalist that sounded like a combination of Gerry Rosalie/Alice Coopper/Iggy Pop/Mitch Ryder-yeah that's baaad!!!! And last but not least were England's Thee Hypnotics; these guys were perhaps a bit more psychedelic than the above mentioned groups, but they also sported a heavy MC5/Stooges attack.  If you enjoy this genre then go and do some soul searchin' yeah!
B0000035E7|5.0|I would definitely recommend this to any Nirvana fan. It's more raw and edgy than Nevermind but it's a Kurt Cobain masterpiece nevertheless.
B00005QGAZ|5.0|After 20 years Thriller is still the best album ever. Now it has been remastered and sounds great. Every song on the album sounds magnificent. There are great extras on this special edition cd. The interviews with Quincy Jones and Rod Temperton are great and are really informative. There are 7 interviews. Then there are the two bonus songs, Someone In The Dark from the E.T. album(Does not deserve to be be on Thriller) and Carousel which was made for Thriller but didn't make the cut, a great song but not Thriller material. The there is the real great bonus, the Home Demo of Billie Jean. In this song you can here how Billie Jean sounded like before being released on Thriller. It is amazing, the lyrics are different but the beat is basically the same.<br />If you are a Michael Jackson fan this is a must have. This is a great album, the greatest album.
B000003TAB|5.0|It received very little air play and it didn't get much exposure at all but true Nirvana fans found it anyway. It's much different from Nevermind and Bleach, it's kind of cooky and it drifted away from the albums previous to this. There are many who do not like this one at all, but I like it. I would recommend it.
B000002J1M|5.0|The first two albumns of Genesis, sans 'The Knife', were essentially a disappointing, unrefined blend that failed to acheive both a strong focus and decent performances on the drums &amp; guitar.  Then with 'Nursery Cryme' Collin and Hackett fixed the latter two problems.  The albumn itself, while a massive improvement over the previous two albumns, was not quite refined in its sound and not particularly well-structured as an albumn in and of itself.  Nonetheless, the opening masterpiece 'Thge Musical Box' propelled Genesis forward, and it was with 'Foxtrot' that the group finally found its goal.<br />We open with 'Watcher of the Skies', with its well-done melotron intro and finale mixed with a middle section of interesting lyrics that can be interpretted in several ways.  the sound of the middle segment itself is quite uppity, though the song still retains a progressive feel throughout.<br />'Time Table' is a decent song with a fairly nice repeating melody, but, alas, it is probably the albumn's weakest draw.  thankfully, things are picked up with 'Get 'em Out by Friday', an 8-minute-plus work of satirical sci-fi wit and whimsy along the vein of 'Cryme's 'Harold the Barrel'.  The line of humrous Genesis mini-musicals would reach their peak in the next albumn with 'The Battle of Epping Forest.'<br />Now we get 'Can-Utility and the Coastliners' (a very odd name that alludes to the name of the main character)  The song contains a memorable melody in its own right and toward the end contains some of Bank's most frantic keyboard work.  It is followed by the breif, well-done 'Horizons', which shows off Hacket's talents in a breif, beautiful acoustic guitar work.  While retaining a good sense of whimsy and progressivism, the rest of the albumn has been just preparation for what is to come....<br />With 'Supper's Ready' Genesis entered its pinnacle period.  The next two albumns, 'Selling England...' and 'The Lamb...' would be the band's best two albumns.  'Supper's Ready'in itself is a 23-minute epic divided into seven segments that tie together into an immense, beautiful tapestry.  We begin with the melodic acoustic opening segment 'Lover's Leap', which is followed by the stronger fantasy segment 'The Guaranteed Eternal Sancturay Man.'  After about 7 minutes the song truly picks up with the potent 'Ikhnaton &amp; Itsacon &amp; Their Band of Merry Men', a frenzied, classic rock-esque battle segment blessed with Hacket's fine guitar work and the cynical, satirical lyrics of Gabriel.  Then we quiet down for the mournful melotron working in 'How Dare I be so Beautiful' before the song goes all-out.  'Willow Farm' is far-and-away one of the most eclectric, witty, and outright bizarre segments of music ever recorded, with its cynical, witty, and somewhat perverse lyrics, sound effects, and rythm.  The perverseness is intentional, of course, and malevolent in its undertones.  After a rather chilling guitar work by Hacket to finish the segment we segue into a rather soothing acoustic guiat/flute segment that build up with Collin's military-esque drumming into 'Apochalypse in 9/8'.  Remember the earlier comment about Bank's frantic keyboard work in 'Can-Utility'?  That was nothing compared to the long, complex, frantic, and masterful keyboard segment of the Apohcalypse.  The lyrics themselves are full of references to the Book of Revelation, including the moon turning to blood, the dragon, and the silver head of wisdom.  Finally it fades out with Collin's drums until finally we hear the bells ringing and we launch into the majestic, beautiful 'Aching Men's Feet' finale segment.  With 'Supper's Ready' Genesis peaked with its best song.  For the next two albumns the band would be a strong, cohesive, wonderful group, and it was 'Foxtrot' that brough it to its peak.
B000002J1U|5.0|Led Zeppelin came on the scene in 1969 as the Beatles were breaking apart, and bands that had mimicked them had become no more, and it was time for harder rock to take over.  Enter Jimi Hendrix, The Rolling Stones, Aerosmith, and Led Zeppelin.  <BR>Led Zeppelin's third album, cleverly titled Led Zeppelin III, revealed a new side of the band, as had its predicessors.  Led Zeppelin I had established LZ as a blues act, Led Zeppelin II redefined them as a rock band, and Led Zeppelin III, perhaps their greatest album, although Physical Graffiti is hard to beat, made Led Zeppelin into an acoustic, interesting band.  Sandwiched between two great first albums and Led Zeppelin IV, which contained &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot;, LZ III has become over looked as an average album, and placed in the same lowly Zeppelin-album category with Presence and In Through the Out Door.<BR>But LZ III is perhaps one of the ten best albums of all time, with more feeling and meaning than any other material released then and now.  Let's break it down track by track:<br />Immigrant Song: Misleading in terms of what the album contains beyond it.  It's heavy, loud, and dirty, but is a good song none the less.  Grade: B<br />Friends: Great acousic guitar in this one, and with Plant's vocals backed up by cellos it makes the song one of the heaviest on the album. Grade: A-<br />Celebration Day: Decent.  Weaker song than others on LZ III.  Grade: B-<br />Since I've Been Loving You: Blues, so it sort of feels out of place, but its a good song.  Grade: B+<br />Out on the Tiles: The only &quot;rock&quot; song on the album which is really worth listening to.  Catchy.  Grade: A-<br />Gallows Pole: Adapted from a traditional folk song, this song contains great arrangements, great vocals, and great acoustic guitar.  Grade: A<br />Tangerine: Outstanding.  More feeling than any other LZ song throughout their career and has great guitars.  Only flaw is un-needed harmonies.  Grade: A<br />That's the Way: Greatsong, like Tangerine before it, creates a mellow vibe.  Great guitars, great vocals.  Grade: A<br />Bron-Y-Aur Stomp: Best song on the album.  Great acoustic guitar, great vocals, great drums.  Much better than Bron-Yr-Aur which came up in Physical Graffiti 5 years later.  Grade: A+<br />Hats off to (Roy) Harper: Bad song.  Sorry.  Bad way to end a great album.  Grade: C

0307165485|5.0|I still have my original paperback copy, which came free with a box of Bold laundry detergant (the sticker is still on the cover), and hold it as one of my most valued childhood treasures. I'm sure my dad can recite the entire book word for word as he read it to me so often!<br />I am now 7 months pregnant with my first child and wondered how my tattered (read that as well loved) copy would hold up for my little boy.  Imagine my delight when I found that it is still in print!  I can't wait to get a copy for the library we are working on for him! Even though my little one is still in utero, my husband and I read to him every night, and will continue to do so after he's born. I can't imagine a better book to read from than Richard Scarry!<br />This book has delightful tales and rhymes that all children will love.  My favorite part about the book though is that so many of the stories are set in different parts of the world and illustrated in a child friendly manner that will make them want to learn more about the world around them (in my opinion anyway, as it certainly did for me). As we now live in Europe, I've visited many places I was first introduced to, and intrigued by, in Richard Scarry's world.  This book is an absolute must for all children's libraries.
B00005JKCF|5.0|It's been a long time since I read a comic book, but when my roommate told me that Spiderman is \\"an AWESOME movie,\\" well, I just had to see what it was that put that enthusiasm in his voice. <br /> Much to my delight, the movie is very faithful to the original comic, with only a few minor variations, none of which detracted from my enjoyment of the film. The music in the movie is very good, ESPECIALLY the opening music. And the PLOT, my goodness, I never thought a movie based off a comic book could have such a wonderful plot. <br /> However, as great as myself and others make this movie sound, it's not without its harsh critics. Some reviewers talk about the silly one-liners, the silly costume for green goblin, etc. This is where my title for the review comes in: THIS IS SPIDERMAN, NOT SHAKESPEARE! The very IDEA of a man getting bitten by a genetically altered spidered and acquiring super powers is ridiculous to begin with, which is why it makes perfectly good sense for everything else to follow suit. <br /> Normally, I HATE spiders, but this spider is definitely one I'd like to see more of.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|Kidman and McGregor do all they can to save this cinematic garbage, but to no avail. This is a low-point in films where glitter and style (like MTV) over-power the fact that the movie has a total lack of any interesting content. I pity the actors!

B000002WU9|5.0|One can even say that this is better than Wu's 36 Chambers, but to appreciate and understand this album more you would first have to appreciate and understand 36 Chambers.  This album is an absolute classic!  36 Chambers was the blueprint, Cuban Linx was the finished product.  What makes this album a great album is that it's very catchy, open, and lively.  Raekwon and Ghostface are great together.  You can tell Raekwon put his heart into this album.  The beats are very sample-filled and mesmorizing nothing out of the ordinary but with the Rza touch of course, not to say that anything the Wu makes is ordinary.  Get this album because there's not too many like them these days.
B00005QGAV|5.0|&quot;Dangerous&quot; is and may always be Michael Jackson's best cd.  This album has more good songs for your dollar than any of his other efforts.  Even the &quot;filler&quot; tracks are fun to listen to here.  Michael has had an excellent career (I actually like almost everything he has ever put out), but if you only own one MJ cd you have to buy this one.<br />The songs &quot;In the Closet,&quot; &quot;Jam,&quot; &quot;Black or White,&quot; &quot;Will You Be There,&quot; &quot;Who is it?&quot; and &quot;Black Or White&quot; are all must listens! A+
B000003TA4|4.0|this is a good album. but concerning grunge, a term in which i don't believe in, this is wayyyyyyyyy below anything Alice in Chians or Pearl Jam have ever done. It's great though from the begining till the end. i recommend this. in a way the music and the lyrics are good.
B00005YTFG|5.0|I have read some of the Moulin Rouge reviews, and they are definitely mixed. But I would encourage you to watch this movie. However, you need to watch it more than once. The first time I watched it, I wasn't sure if I liked it. Right after the movie ended, I was just sitting their with my mind spinning. It took me about a week to realize that I wanted to see it again. The second time I watched it, I fell in love with it. You will catch so many things that you missed the first time. You will also appreciate the elaborate sets and costumes. The acting in this movie was great- Baz Luhrmann really did a great casting job. Even the singing was impressive- both Nicole and Ewan. This is just a personal opinion, but Ewan's voice really left me amazed. His talent is shown especially in &quot;Your Song,&quot; a remake of an old Elton John song. After watching Moulin Rouge I became a new Ewan fan. :) I know many people didn't like the movie because of the music, but this is a way in which the movie tries to be different. With all of the similar movies coming out recently, Moulin Rouge tries to go out on a limb. The songs in the movie were chosen to give 19th century Paris a modern spin, to make the movie different than normal expectations predicted it would be. Some of the scenes are quite fast-paced and dizzying, but I liked the alternation of fast and slow sequences. It keeps you interested. Probably one of my favorite scenes in the movie is the tango scene towards the end of the movie. So many things are happening at once, and the camara switches from one to the other, but it is done in a genius way. If you turned Moulin Rouge off in the middle or watched it only once and hated it, try watching it again. Most likely you will have an entirely different perspective on the entire thing. I am very very very glad I gave it a second chance. Now I can't watch it enough, and I notice something new each time!
B000002UAU|5.0|...said anything other than great things about this CD?  This review is going to be totally boring because I am going to go on and on about how great the CD is.  So, if you want to know whether you should buy it, the answer is yes.  You don't have to read anything else or any other reviews.<br /><br />Now, if you want to know which songs are the best or worst, listen to the CD!  I like every one of them.  This CD is one of those where every single song could have been released and it would have gone top 40, even though the styles run from pure pop (&#34;Fixing a Hole&#34; and &#34;With a Little Help from My Friends) to a big band rock sound (Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band - OF COURSE!), to psychedelic pop (Within You, Without You - a song with the only flaw of being TOO DARN SHORT!!!).<br /><br />Some of the songs are absolutely up-beat and peppy, like &#34;Good Morning, Good Morning,&#34; &#34;Getting Better,&#34; and &#34;Lucy and the Sky with Diamonds.&#34;  The enthusiasm and excitement takes me back to the fun bands of the 60's jumping around on stage like a bunch of maniacs.  That was one of the many fun parts of the 60's.  There were some occasional tinges of darkness (She's Leaving Home, and somehow &#34;A Day in the Life&#34; seems a little sinister), yet somehow all this stuff fits together in one tight little beautiful package that contains some incredibly artistic music that broke a lot of ground for rock music, and for all other music too.<br /><br />This CD will be one of those that will be a classic in the style of the &#34;1812 Overture.&#34;  People will be referring to it in the next century and beyond!
B00005RY7X|5.0|This CD is great. Well worth the time and money. From the first strains of It's Time to Party, through Don't Stop Livin' In The Red. WOW! I love it. Get it. Now. I am listening to it right now, Party Hard is coming through my headphones as I type. The music is catching. If you don't like this, then something is seriously wrong with you.
0684800713|5.0|This is probably the best out of all of Hemingway's novels, A Farewell to Arms and For Whom the Bell Tolls included. The &quot;ol' gang&quot; format would be used to great effect in many films afterwards, especially in the Breakfast Club, as that generation was seen as &quot;lost&quot; just as Hemingway's was. Jake's hopeless, tortured longing for Brett shows the trademark passionate Hemingway style, and it makes you think about what actually happens. The smart reader understands this book better.
B000056TKD|5.0|I would like to concur with the other reviewers here regarding this disc of Holst and Strauss.  It is rightly issued as a legendary recording in my opinion and the Holst is perhaps the finest version available today.  A combination of three factors make this a winning disc:  first, Steinberg's fine reputation in English music is obvious throughout the Holst, not least in the more familiar Mars and Jupiter movements; second, the Boston Symphony Orchestra produce a full bodied, voluptous sound; and third, the DG engineers do a fine job of capturing it all in the near ideal acoustic of Symphony Hall (a word of caution, however: the louder passages can be very loud). The only version of the Planets I know of which can compare is Dutoit on Decca (for sound quality...Boult's recordings are also excellent), which is rather tame by comparison.  Even though Steinberg's &quot;Also Sprach...&quot; is quick, the organ peddle at the beginning is truly ominous and exciting.
B00005JKCF|5.0|This movie was even better than i thought it would be, and i thought it was going to be great. i though that Tobey Maguire was going to [stink] as a spider-man but i was totally wrong he was awsome. i this movie the first week it came out and i still cant stop talking about it. i love Sam Raimi's work and this has got to be one of his best films next to the evil dead trilogy. all i have to say is watch this movie!!!
B0000668IF|5.0|is what moby has and he's not afraid to use it. You never know what you'll get with him and I realized as I popped this CD in that that was part of what makes his music interesting and exciting. And I wasn't disappointed, because you get it all.  There is catchy-as-hell pop, there is a really gorgeous ballad w/ sinead o'connor (it reminds me a bit of my favorite moby tune-'into the blue') and there is the sort of moving, immense, wall-of-sound pieces in which you can really lose yourself and which beg for a dramatic landscape as you listen(they will be coming to movies and commercials near you, you can be sure!)....They may even make whatever landscape you're in more dramatic.<BR>These are my favorite songs, like 'look back in' and '18'. They take me right out of the traffic jam and straight to a place of real beauty. If you're a moby fan you've heard it: A minimalist build-up with variations and complexities added to the theme until the song metamorphoses into some huge thundering butterfly gliding to a sunset on some far horizon. <BR>I like the whole CD. These songs are interesting, fun, and beautiful. Wild tangents and easy accessibility. Fun for the whole family. I think it deserves 5 stars just for the wide-ranging approach, but the execution is rather amazing, I'd say, and it's hard to be disappointed in a CD that seems to have  something for all your moods...
B00003CXZ4|3.0|May 18, 2002<br />`Memento', were it the forty minute film project of an <BR>UCLA sophomore, would've been hailed as the best student <BR>movie ever made.  Had it been produced for a television <BR>anthology program (were there any anthology programs to <BR>be found on television, alas), it would've blown its <BR>viewers away presented at the length of fifty minutes.  <BR>As a feature film, however, it is nothing more than a <BR>diverting, clever, but mostly mechanical exercise often <BR>stretched beyond its means to entertain.  <br />You'll spend the first ten minute or so becoming <BR>acclimated to the inverted nature of the film.  From <BR>there you'll spend another ten or twenty guessing the <BR>surprise climax you know is coming (by the halfway mark <BR>I had concocted five possible resolutions, one of which <BR>proved true).  But from thence on, as you might expect, <BR>you become not a little impatient for the film to play <BR>out.  Tightened and cut by thirty percent, `Memento' <BR>would moved at such a breakneck pace that its relatively <BR>familiar crime-story situations and characters would not <BR>have hurt it any.  The actors involved in `Memento' are <BR>fair to excellent, but there's only so much you can do <BR>with detective fiction archetypes.<br />In these days of media-hype, DVDs, video releases, and <BR>cable channels, movie buffs and professional movie critics <BR>might be suffering from burn-out.  After all, there's <BR>only so many wise-cracking family pets and rule-breaking <BR>cops a person can take.  As a result of this, clever <BR>movies--not particularly great movies, but anything with <BR>a properly screwball delivery--have graduated above <BR>themselves in critical attention.  So it seemed with <BR>`Fargo' and `Being John Malkovich' and `The Usual <BR>Suspects' . . . <br />. . . and so it is with `Memento', a pastiche of Jim <BR>Thompson-esque crime cliches complicated, but not <BR>deepened, by a fairly original cinematic device.  A <BR>neat little film, but only if approached without <br />expectations.<br />It's worth your time.  Just be prepared to spend most of <BR>that time remarking to yourself how clever the film is, <BR>rather than truly falling into the story.
B00005JKJA|5.0|it is haunting, atmospheric , dark and brooding, It can be best explained as Edgar Allen Poe's dream life mixed with Post Modenism. This is not a film for everyone. David Lynch excites as well as divides film viewers. it is not worth reading what this movie is about, its aim is for you to refigure,configure,conjure,make sense of things. Everything does make sense miraculously as only someone can. No doubt Lynch is an absolute genius. Anyone who got this movie can explain in a review what this is about but there are nights when you dream. there are certain smells you sniff and have a sense of deja vu, there are certain feelings you have at moments when things are unexplainable in their simplest ways, this film is that and more and is a mental sensory overload, and if like some (including proud old me! )you get this on the first try, Bravo Bravo! Either you will hate this movie or either you will feel ecstatic. I found it eerie but its like a drug that I need to have. I have seen this once and will not see it again for reasons that ultimately the movie has set out what it aimed to do to me. you have not seen anything like this at all. it makes absolute sense just like when you put togther a jigsaw puzzle. Naomi Watts and Laura Harring are eerily beautiful to look at and gorgeous, as well as helping the movie along....sometimes on trainer wheels, and sometimes on one wheel but never on normal standards. I cannot stop raving about this Film, This is so much more beyond cinema. Rest Assured i can tell you that im not a raving lunatic if you didnt like this film. :)<BR>You wont like it if:<BR>you dont like to think watching films<BR>you dont like heavy films<BR>you dont like solving puzzles<BR>You like your popcorn action and a standard story<BR>You can bond well with Formulaic movies<br />If to one of those your answer is different, Give this one a try but be ready to use your brain. And if you are still unclear, Salon.com has a very good article explaining everything about this film BUT BE WARNED..go there only if you have totally given up solving this :) and either feel a sense of accomplishment or dissapointment. The key is in your Box .
B000056K04|1.0|The admiration of Dave Matthew's music started for me with the Crash album. The overwhelming and typical sound of the music made me seek for more. Live at Luther College was a masterpiece of it's own kind and travelling around the world I infected a lot of people with the DM virus. Hearing this live album over and over again one discovers little masterpieces in each song. DM songs became my most favourite ones. Then BTCS with the juggling pieces of voice, guitar, violin and saxophone parts, made me feel there was no better way playing this album than it was done. So when I just heard the samples of the new album somehow brought me in a state of shock. Almost nothing reminded me of the beautifull sounds of previous albums. Every artist has a right for discovering other fields for evolution of its music and to experimentate with it, but I would say DMB took the wrong turnpike here. But there's nothing wrong with turning back and exploring other directions.
0783216084|5.0|Jaws was the greatest grossing film, unbroken, until Star Wars in 1977.  I highly recommend this movie.  If you're looking for suspense, action, and a little bit of comedy, try this one.  It's about a New England police chief, who is afraid of the water, an itchyologist, who is a wealthy collage-type, a salty modern-day Ahab-type fisherman, who is forever angry with sharks, and, of course, a killer, 25-foot Great White shark that is terrorizing the Seaside resort town of Amity.  When the Shark attacks a few victims, it is up to the three men to hunt it down.  This is a very good film.  Try it and be haunted, amazed, and applausing.
B00005JKJA|4.0|I personally like the movie.  The acting is good.  However, the DVD itself doesn't contain much extras.
0920668364|1.0|From HAROLD and THE PURPLE CRAYON to ONE FISH TWO FISH RED FISH BLUE FISH, we've all had our share of crazy kids books read to us growing up.  From the \\"stay out of trouble\\" morals of THE POKEY LITTLE PUPPY to the \\"shut up and eat your dinner\\" message of WHERE THE WILD THINGS ARE, you might even learn a thing or two while you're at it.  But after reading through LOVE YOU FOREVER by Robert Munsch and Sheila McGraw, I have to say that it's one of the creepiest kids books I've ever seen.<br />Published in 1986, it's a fairly modern kids book, but with over 50 printings in the last 15 years, there's obviously millions of homes that have this mind bending tome within.<br />On the surface, it's a really sweet book about a mother who really loves her baby boy as he grows to manhood, no matter how goofy or annoying he may be in the process.  Periodically she visits him and sings the song:<br />\\"I'll love you forever,<br />I'll like you for always,<br />As long as I'm living<br />my baby you'll be.\\"<br />If it were just that, it'd be an all time classic.  But it takes the simple concept to disturbing extremes that have to be seen to be believed.<br />Anyone who's had a baby in their family knows there's nothing cuter than looking at them while they're sleeping.  The mother in the book knows this and sneaks into his room at night to peek at her angel, and sing her little song to him.  Nothing wrong with that, right?<br />Only it doesn't stop there.  When the boy is a teenager she CRAWLS into his room on all fours and, \\"If he was really asleep she picked up that great big boy and rocked him back and forth, back and forth, back and forth\\" while she sang her song.  I don't know about you but if I was 15 and woke up in my bed with my Mom holding me like that, I'd probably scream.  Who knows what kind of weird dreams this poor boy was having?<br />Well at least when this poor lad moves out of the house, he won't have to deal with his mother's obsessive habits anymore...or does he?  Yep, once he's full grown, according to the book, \\"...sometimes on dark nights his mother got into her car and drove across town.\\"  YIKES!  Not only is that scarier than hell that she's driving with a ladder strapped to her car in the middle of the night, but she makes a regular habit of it.<br />Yep, ol' Mommy climbs up his house, crawls through his window and does the same thing.  Man this guy sleeps better than anyone I've ever known!  Well, you can see by looking at this small single bed that he never got married.  And he had such a healthy upbringing, too.  It's a shame!<br />Though the book takes a poignant dramatic turn when he hears his mother isn't doing well and he goes to visit her.  As he holds his dying mother in his lap, he turns the tables and sings the song to her.  But wait a minute!  I thought he was asleep during all those other times.  Looks like he was playing along with this little sick little game a little too eagerly.<br />At this point, you feel bad for making fun of the book at all 'cause his mother has passed away.  The son returns home, though, and picks up his baby girl and sings the song to her.<br />But from everything we've seen in the book, the guy lives alone.  The only woman he ever sees at night is his Mom.  Leaving the only possible mother of his child to be...OH MY GOD!!!<br />Let's all cross our fingers and pray we don't see the sequel to this book.<br />If you still think this book is sweet and that I'm missing the true spirit of LOVE YOU FOREVER, just switch the genders of the characters in this story and tell me that wouldn't be extra creepy.once he's full grown, according to the book, \\"...sometimes on dark nights his mother got into her car and drove across town.\\"  YIKES!

B00005QDW1|5.0|This album proves that No Doubt still is just as popular as they were when they released their first album, Tragic Kingdom. Their style of music has always been superior. Gwen Stefani is a wonderful lead singer with a great group of guys to back her. The album ROCK STEADY is definately not a let down, it is very upbeat. The album starts with a short intro then goes into HELLA GOOD which is a great song, it is full of dance grooves and Gwen's great singing voice. Also HEY BABY is great, this album just makes you want to get up and dance yourself into a frenzy.<BR>From Tragic Kingdom to Return of Saturn and now Rock Steady I think No Doubt will keep on Rocking Steady on the top of the charts for years and years, They deliver wonderful and never disappointing material every time. A must have along with their other previous releases all of which are carried with me every day to work for listening pleasure at work and in the car.<BR>Ginger Greene
B00005QATY|3.0|I wanted so much to love this film, like I love the bulk of the C-Brothers' films.  But I have to be honest, after the first half hour or so, I no longer accepted George Clooney in that lead role.  He is not edgey enough for dark humor, oddball humor, satire, farce, and general off-center weirdness.  Admit it, you were envisioning Nicholas Cage in that role, too, weren't you?
B00004Z459|5.0|When I first heard Linkin Park's first song release I was hooked and went the next day and bought the CD HYBRID THEORY after hearing one release which was \\"One Step Closer\\". They have a wonderful talent as a new band and this album has proved that.<BR>From the first to the last song this cd is a must to listen to every track. Their musical style of alternative/with a little mix of rap and some rocking music is just plain all out feel good turn up the volume music. If you are an alternative music fan you should consider purchasing this cd for sure. My favorite tracks are Paranoid, One Step Closer, Crawling and With You. These are my absolute favorites on the cd but all of the songs are great.!!!!!!!...
B00005JKEC|5.0|Denzel has my vote for best actor, maybe of all time.  On another level, however, this film bothers me.  I'm not really sure what the message is.  I'm not sure what option this leaves us as a people whose police force, for the most part, is corrupt and morally bankrupt.  It seems to be saying that most cops are corrupt and that those who aren't are naive or powerless.  If this is true, where does that leave the rest of us?  Are we, like the rookie cops, naive and powerless?...
B00005JKCF|4.0|I am not a big fan of the comic book ,but this movie was incridably.I waited three years for it to come out and it was well worth the wait.It had great speciel effects,an outstanding cast,the CGI didn't look CGI and I was really suprised how it came out,I wish it was longer though.Tobey Macquire was perfect to play as spider-man,I was always a big fan of Kirsten Dunst and and Dafoe was creepy.Hopefully they make a sequel and the dvd comes out soon!
B000007VCM|4.0|But those two are like night and day.  Where sonic temple was big and bombastic here they're subduded and haunting(kind of like Ceromony done the right way).  Making it all the more memorable than ST.  While ST is something you would play at a party, Love is someting to listen to alone.  Great tracks are all over this one: \\"Rain(My personal favorite)\\", \\"She Sells Sanctuary\\", \\"Revolution\\", \\"Big Neon Glitter(With a great opening)\\", \\"Hollow Man\\", \\"Brother Wolf\\", \\"Nirvana\\". A real fan favorite.
B00001QEBQ|5.0|Mulan is just a myth in China, but a lot of girls look up 2 her, even tho we don't know if she actually existed.  She was so worried about her father that she went to the army for him, even tho she knew she faced the risk that if ppl found out, she'd be sentenced to death.  In the Disney version, they pump it up, and make her wounded, and they find out she's a woman, but she saved the captain's life, so he spared hers, and blah blah, she became the herion of China.  The myth was that she returned home safely, fighting off the enemies.  It really brings out the Chinese Tradition, and still, a lot of girls, ranging from young little girls to the elders, they still look up to her, and so do I.

B00003CXI1|4.0|Honestly, I'm not a Harry Potter fan, but I have to admit that Daniel, Emily and Rupert have the stuff to be the three lil wizards.  When I sat down in the theatre, I was like: Sheesh.  I don't like the book (I haven't read it, not even now!), how in the world will I like the movie?  But I was wrong.  This was good.  All had their special parts in the movie, like Daniel was really Harry-Potter-looking; Emily had that tone of voice which I thought was really suitable; Rupert, well, the newspaper wrote that his real personality, eg kind, caring, was somewhat the same as Ron in the movie.  Definately recommand it to HP lovers.
B000000WJZ|5.0|Gish was both exciting and slightly disappointing to me.  Succumbing to the hype in Spin magazine, I bought it on tape back in '91 and found it frustratingly uneven.  The great songs were a revelation - `I Am One', `Siva', `Rhinoceros', `Snail' - this was obviously a band with serious potential.  Still, I was disappointed by some of the other tracks that lacked focus.  <br />Two years later, Siamese Dream came out while I was in Africa.  I returned to the U.S. soon thereafter in poor health.  After a few days back home, I stumbled into Echoes record shop looking for something to cheer me up.  Prominent on the display rack at Echoes was an album that would be my faithful companion on many future journeys.  <br />Yes, that album was Siamese Dream.  To call it a huge step forward from Gish would be an understatement.  Siamese Dream, my friends, is one of my favorite albums of all-time!<br />The sound of Siamese Dream is so drenched in emotion you can't help but be moved by it.  I've never really figured out exactly what `Mayonnaise' is about, but the emotions conveyed through the song are so poignant, it really doesn't matter.  It is certainly one of the most beautiful rock songs ever written.  And to follow `Mayonnaise' with `Space Boy' is almost too much - this wrenching paean to Billy's brother is deeply affecting.<br />Sure, songs from this album come on the radio often enough.  I say `turn em off'!  Siamese Dream is an album to be savored on CD, not as individual cuts on the radio.  When it comes right down to it, Siamese Dream is a truly beautiful listening experience.
B00005JKL8|4.0|In this movie Owen Wilson plays a navigator who, with his pilot, is sent on a reconnaisance mission over Bosnia.  When they photograph illegal military activity in a demilitarized zone, they are shot down and pursued.  Gene Hackman is their commander and plans a rescue which is foiled by US military politics.  The main part of the movie shows Wilson eluding his pursuers and Hackman trying to find a way around his commander in order to effect a rescue.  The action is intense (although the acting isn't) and this movie provides a good evening's entertainment.
1574535145|5.0|.<BR>In my meager nineteen years of existence, I have somehow managed to read a hell of a lot of books.  Out of all those books - horror, non fiction, scifi/fantasy - only Ender's Game has exceeded my expectations.  I've read all the hype, again and again, and so I finally sat down to read the book.   Again and again.<br />I'm not even a fast reader, for God's sake.  Not to mention that I have a very limited patience while reading.  And yet, somehow, I read Ender's Game twice in one sitting.  (Where's the 6th star, anyway?)<br />While the concepts in the Ender's series *are* somewhat unique, they're not 100% original, nor are they entirely spectacular....  Aliens threaten earth, and the government establishes a battle school program to prepare genius children in the ways of intergalactic war.  Simple enough, but that's not what makes this book my all-time favorite.  <br />Also, there's not a lot of symbolism, and the style Card writes in is plain and direct, not flowery.  But this simplicity is precisely why I love reading Card.  (I also recently read Enchantment.  I highly recommend that as well).  This simplicity in writing is what makes Ender's Game \\"stick.\\"  I read it last spring and now that spring is around again, I'm finding myself having flashbacks from the story, remembering the most minor details.  Not to mention that its simplicity makes it accessible to all reading ages.<br />What really hit me, though, was the conclusion.  Oh my.  I remember reading the last twenty pages the first time around, thinking to myself,  \\"Ok, this ending looks like it's about to fall flat on its...\\" and then, BAM, it struck me right when I least expected it - at the absolute end of the book.   All the loose ends were tied up firmly (although I must admit, I found myself re-reading the conclusion a few times over just to make sure I didn't miss anything), and then the book was finished.  There was barely enough room for anti-climax.<br />The only real drawback I can find with this book is that, by reading it, your standards will shoot past the clouds.  Once I read Ender's Game, I found myself getting disappointed with the rest of the books out there.  Ah, it used to be so easy to find a book that impressed me...<br />ps:  The rest of the Enders books are EXCELLENT.  None of them are nearly as quick-paced as Ender's Game, and occasionally they trudge along, but they expound on the main storyline wonderfully.  All the details fit together smugly, in the end.  My highest recommendations.
B00004ST9Q|4.0|There is no denying the music of Whitney Houston. Her strength in R&amp;B is still as strong as it was back when she started in the mid 1980's, and that remains to be true.<br />Her 2000 DVD, The Greatest Hits, showcases the many talents this legandary Diva has made. While some of the videos reamin as simple, like You Give Good Love, and The Greatest Love Of All, and some reflect Mrs. Bobby Brown as a hard cookie, like Queen Of The Night, and I Learned From The Best.<br />Surprisingly, there are two different versions of the DVD anthology of Whitney Houston's videos. Some of them carry two extra music videos, Exhale (Shoop Shoop), from Waiting To Exhale, and I Believe In You And Me, from The Preacher's Wife.<br />While her music may have fizzled down in the industry, Whitney Houston still shows that she is still a survivor among the so-called corporate teen idol crowd of Nsync, and Britney Spears fans. No wonder Whitney Houston has still learned to be the best.
B0000640VO|5.0|\\"Amelie\\" is a simply wonderful film about a shy, introspective but free-spirited girl who found a kindred spirt (and love of her life) through helping a host of others in need of help.  The cinematography was beautiful, and the hilarious scenes of Amelie's overactive imagination (similar to those of \\"Ally McBeal\\") made the film just fun to watch.  The story itself, while largely predictable (after all, can this film really end on a sad note?), has a few twists and turns that keeps the viewer highly entertained.  Last but not least, composer Yann Tiersen did a wonderful job with the soundtrack that successfully created the appropriate mood (just listening to the music evokes \\"Paris\\" in one's mind).  I just couldn't get that melancholy \\"Guilty\\" out of my head when I'd left the theater after watching the film.  Thus, I also *highly* recommend the soundtrack.<br />BTW, this film is subtitled.  I'd never thought that this would be an issue when recommending a film, but after reading the scathing reviews from subtitled-challenged reviewers on \\"Crouching Tiger and Hidden Dragon\\", (\\"I can't believe that it wasn't in English!!!\\") I guess my fellow Americans need to be warned that not every film needs to be in English to be worth watching.  Sad but true . . .
B0000639FE|4.0|Saw the movie when it came out. Thought it was good. Watching the DVD made me see the movie in a different light. Maybe the best DVD to ever come out. GREAT behind the scenes footage. See Cuba Gooding audition. See Tom Cruise rehearse scenes on an empty set. See deleted scenes. Great movie commentary. The 2-disc DVD set is awesome. The movie stands over time and shows what sports is currently all about. Money!! And Jay Mohr steals the show in this movie.
0515123447|3.0|Jack Reacher is a drifter who walked into the wrong town.<br />Eight hours after he gets off the bus in Margrave, Ga., Reacher is arrested at gunpoint for a brutal homicide. He's brought in for questioning and detained until the police realize they've nabbed the wrong man. With Reacher's aid, the police haul in another suspect -- who promptly confesses to the crime, even though he also didn't do it.<br />More bodies start piling up in this strange, quiet town and a conspiracy is slowly revealed. Though Reacher stopped in Margrave on a whim, it soon becomes clear that he's knee-deep in its rash of vicious murders.<br />Reacher is a cold fellow, lacking much in the personality department. He is methodical and violent when the situation calls for it; the rest of the time, he's simply floating from one dangerous situation to another.<br />The first book in the Jack Reacher series, \\"Killing Floor\\" starts off with a bang, but soon slows to the pace of a hot, muggy Southern morning. The story occasionally picks up speed, but the twists and turns of the mystery are revealed in an erratic fashion.<br />There is a masculine quality to the storytelling style -- few words are wasted on frills or emotions. One love scene happened so fast, I almost missed it. However, once you settle into this novel (about 200 pages in), \\"Killing Floor\\" offers an appealing whodunit with a unique antihero.
B00005UKKF|4.0|[This is]...one of the best live performances ever. Not just by her, but by anyone. This one, it's the guitar and all the back up stuff that she has that makes it good. I never really liked her before this, but this really changed my mind about her. Stronger is the best one!! GET THIS!
6302909651|1.0|This movie made me so mad I wanted to throw something at the TV.  What a lame excuse for an ending!  I felt like I'd spent two hours listening to somebody set up a joke only to have them blow the punch line.  What a disappointing waste of three talented actors -- and of my time.
6305041156|5.0|I recently saw this film for the first time; It was a revelation.  It is the greatest film I have ever seen.  It is the greatest performance of Shakespeare I have ever seen-- and it doesn't even include any of the Bard's dialogue.  It is the greatest period piece I have ever seen-- or read.  It is, quite simply, a titanic masterwork.  As I watched it unfold (or rather explode,) every shot was the most beautiful I had ever witnessed.  The sound-- perfect.  The cinematography-- perfect.  Music?  You guessed it-- perfect.  Acting?  For this movie-- perfect.  Even the makeup was the best I've ever seen.  My initial reaction at the end of Ran?  I couldn't believe such a movie even existed.  Everyone always knew that nobody filmed men in motion like Kurosawa.  Who knew that nobody filmed men at rest just as well?  And all in one film?<br />Nobody insists that Kurosawa came from nothing.  His stories came from Dostoyevsky, Shakespeare, and Japanese legend.  Some of his film techniques came from Orson Welles.  But nobody ever put it all together like this.  The man spent ten years alone storyboarding while looking for cash-- and when Kurosawa storyboarded, he went all out.  Full-sized paintings, sometimes dozens for one scene.  And-- get this-- he was seventy five, and nearly blind.  Keep that in mind during the last shot of the film, which, by the way, all respect to Truffaut, is the greatest ever.<br />The work paid off.  Greatest film I've seen.  Period.  See it now.  See it over and over.
B00005JKHZ|5.0|I remember seeing this movie in the theater in 1971 and had always wanted it on tape. I would check my local t.v. listing to see if it would be shown. but no luck. Thankfully it has been released on VHS for it's second time. The packaging is different on the first VHS release of Vanishing Point. Starring Barry Newman as a an ex-cop and race car driver named Kowalski, his job is to drive a suped up 1970 Dodge Challenger from Denver to San Francisco in 24 hours or less. He drives the state cops nuts with his antics and soon all the state troopers from Colorado to California are after him. As he drives this musclecar he flashes back images to his days a a cop, his affair with a girlfriend hippy and as a race car driver. He has the help of Super Soul (Cleavon Little) a small town disc jocky helping him and letting him know which routes are crawling with cops. But the appeal of this movie are the amazing car chase scenes which in my opinion are some of the best I've seen (along with \\"Gone in 60 Seconds). If you enjoy car movies like this one, by all means pick this movie up before it's deleted. Highly recommended!
B00003CWN3|5.0|When I first heard about this movie at the 2000 Academy Awards, I knew that I wanted to see it badly, even though I had only a small idea what it was about.  It would be about a year and a half before I actually saw it.  And the whole way through the movie, I was stunned.  I couldn't believe the things that were said and shown in the movie.  But I wasn't disgusted or horrified or offended.  And that's because everything shocking that was done in this movie was done in a tasteful and non-glamorizing way.  And that's how director Kimberly Pierce did a superb job.  Not to mention the Oscar-winning acting job by Hilary Swank and Oscar-nominated (should have won) acting by Chloe Sevigny.  This movie follows the life of Teena Brandon (Swank) pretending to be Brandon Teena.  It shows her/him (whichever way you want to look at it) arriving in a town that hates gay people and trying to fit in as best as he/she can.  After a little while, he/she meets Lana (Sevigny).  Lana seems like a quiet but strong person and Teena/Brandon is so intrigued by her that they start dating and Lana soon gets the same feelings.  Brandon does his best to cover up his tracks but some of the local hicks soon stumble onto the truth and are horrified.  So they take Teena out, beat her up, rape her, and eventually kill her.  The last half hour/45 minutes are the most important but also sometimes the hardest to watch.  The graphic rape scene will probably have a lot of viewers reaching for their eject button on their VCRs but you really should watch the whole movie.  As I said, this movie is not glamorizing anything and it's not necessarily in-your-face stuff so don't be intimidated by some of the material.  Watching Swank acting in this role, I can only imagine what it must have been like to live this life all through the filming.  It must have been hard on her physically and psychologically and that along with her excellent acting is what got her the Oscar.  Now, Sevigny went through almost as muchand why she didn't win the Oscar baffles me.  She worked just as hard and deserved some recognition.  So, in the end, you must see this movie.  It's controversial for it's subject matter but it's really one of the best movies ever made.  If you really have a true appreciation of movies and film, you won't be disgusted or offended by it at all.  This really is acting at it's best, directing at it's best, and a movie at it's best.
0345350499|2.0|Mists of Avalon <BR>The Mists of Avalon is a story about a priestess of the old religion who is fighting to keep her independence and save her religion and world from the threat of change. This is basically the story of King Arthur and Britain told from the women's point of view. The main character, Morgaine, is faced with challenges caused by conflicts between the Christians and the followers of the Goddess. She endures many hardships many hardships in this book and suffers many losses. It is set in Britain in the medieval times. This is also a story about love and survival. <BR>This novel had its good points, but was extremely long and drawn out at times. It had some irrelevant detail that could have been left out to create a cleaner story. I don't recommend this book to anyone under the age of fifteen. It has some very graphic detail that makes it a little to intense and sexual for younger readers. This book is good for someone who has a lot of time to spare and can really get into it. It requires patience and attention to detail.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|I dont know anything else to say for this film except Wow...just wow..I searched everywhere for this movie for quite awhile. Everything about it was great, the plot, the camera work, the script, and the actors especially. Im going to be expecting great things from Jake Gyllenhaal who was equally amazing in October Sky, and Richard Kelly as a writer/director, I expect many more genius films such as this. I have to admit I had to watch it almost 3 times to understand and get everything but It was well worth it. I dont think Ive ever seen such an amazing film.<BR>This is definatly an instant cult classic, and it is definatly worth the price for all the great special features it comes with.<BR>You get a lot of deleted scenes almost every scene in the movie has been extended, you also get 2 great commentaries, &quot;Mad World&quot; music video, Picture galleries with production stills and concept art, cast and crew information, theatrical trailors and TV spots, and much much more.<br />This movie is definatly worth a rent, but renting just wont do, you have to own this incredible film.
B00004R99J|5.0|... since I'm one of those rare people who actually loved this movie, I'd absolutely give the DVD five stars.<BR>As for the movie itself: a lot of people complain that it's very different from what sketchy historical information we have about Pocahontas herself, but if you really expect a Disney film to be a history lesson, then you've got a whole other set of problems that you should be dealing with.<BR>The character animation, backgrounds, and coloring are all gorgeous.  The voices are excellent, and even if you don't like musical numbers as a rule (I sure don't) these are at least well-performed.  You certainly don't get the sense that they were written so that Disney could make a few extra bucks with a pop song.  The characters are wonderfully done; particularly the extras (Thomas and Nakoma in particular, as well as Kocoum, Ben, and Lon), who usually get the short end of the stick as far as development goes.  Not in this movie, though.  And while there *is* a talking tree, the requisite cute animal sidekicks don't talk, thank goodness.<BR>As for the DVD: the transfer is good.  The extras are also fun to play with, even if there aren't many to choose from.  It's definitely worth spending the extra money to get the DVD version of this movie, rather than the VHS.  <BR>And for crying out loud, stop expecting &quot;Pocahontas&quot; to be like a documentary.  This film is no worse a bastardization of the real story than &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; is of Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale or &quot;Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot; is of Hugo's novel.  Enjoy it for the well-animated, romantic movie that it is.
B000000OUW|4.0|The title of this disc is a little misleading.  It's not that rude, raucous type metal that some prefer, but as titled above.    <BR>   &quot;Bothers of Metal&quot;, &quot;Outlaw&quot;, and &quot;King&quot; are awesome.  &quot;The God's Made Heavy Metal&quot; and &quot;Number I&quot; are catchy and some listener favorites.  &quot;Courage&quot;; an average ballad type.  <BR>    Overall, Manowar with a new, eighties type guitarist; the vocals of Adams are better than ever though. Buy it, &quot;but you'll have to listen to it a few times.&quot;  Example: Outlaw; &quot;The law of the west was the law of the gun,&quot; (wicked type guitar riffs), &quot;stay alive be fast on the draw,&quot; with Adams hitting a powerful wail.

B00003CX5P|2.0|I really like star wars but dont get me wrong but this movie was not very good for a star wars movie and it overall turned me off to star wars. This movie had too mutch Jar Jar who was very Idiotic and the technology seemed newer then the origonal trigoly but episode 2 dose a great job fixing the errors of episode 1. The special effects and the actress that pays the queen is all this movie had going for it. Personally I liked the origonal trilogy and episode 2 alot better. Because episode 2 was mutch better then episode one and 2 is just as good as the origonal is why I like it better.
B000002KJM|3.0|ZZ Top's First Album is not all bad, but it ain't all good. It's got some good songs, some good Billy Gibbons guitar work, and good evidence of their oddball Cowboy/Hippie/Texan/Bluesman hard rockin' sense of humor, (or were they being entirely serious?..check out Brown Sugar). The better songs have that ZZ Top tight as a just rebuilt engine groove like Neighbor, Neighbor, Just Got Back from Baby's, and Backdoor Love Afair. The not so good ones, like Goin' Down to Mexico, ramble on like a '56 Ford pickup with a loose front end. Squank is an funny one, though I've never read or heard for certain what it's about. I think the song may be about the smell of oil refining that is so strong in places on the Gulf Coast of Texas southeast of Houston, where ZZ is rooted. I lived down there..so it has meaning to ME. Like many a band's first album this one sounds tentative, but ZZ's solid sound is obvious, and this is worth a good listen, as long as you're not expecting Abbey Road..FAR, FAR FROM IT! <br />I have heard both CD and cassette versions of this release and I like the cassette/vinyl just fine thank you. The CD release ruins the guitar tone with chorus and other junk. A big part of ZZ Top's early appeal was it's earthy, rootsy sound and to funk all that up with latter day digital effects seems totally misguided.
1573301183|5.0|I watched this one at a friend's house . untill then i could'nt see what the fuss is about DVD  formats . You watch this one , and you see what they invented DVD for . I am not an AIC fan , but they are TALENTED !
B000062YB1|5.0|This album is a bit of a change in sound for Slayer. Not all of the songs, but most are not as Thrashy or raw as Slayers eailer works like the classics \\"Show No Mercey\\", \\"Hell Awits\\", \\"Reign in Blood\\" ect. Is this a bad thing? I would say not. The music's tone and lyrics remain every bit as bad ... as before, and remain(or at least seem)to still be horror movie inspired.<BR>It was not until \\"Diobolus in Musica\\" Slayer were accused by some old fans of sellout or becoming to Nu-metalish. for the most part this release is very good. War Ensemble, Blood Red, Dead Skin Mask, and Hallowed Point are slayer at there best.
080018789X|5.0|I loved this movie sooooo much! I just watched it a few days ago actually. I'm such a HUGE fan of movies!(mostly romantic comedies)While I was browsing through a video store the other day, someone reccomended me this movie. So i decided to give it a try. After all, Tom Cruise is one of my favorite actors and he was nominated an oscar for his role in this movie.(too bad he didn't win!) I bought the vcd and watched it that night. The story was so good! It was really really funny, touching and romantic at the same time. Tom Cruise was wonderful as Jerry Maguire! I watched it a hundred times during this past week! I highly reccomend this movie to you! You will definetely NOT regret watching it! This movie will keep you entertained the whole 2 hours. <br />    Anyway, \\"Jerry Maguire\\" is about a sports agent(Tom Cruise) with 76 clients and works in one of the top companies. But one night, he realized that he hated his place in the world. So he wrote a mission statement/memo (25 pages)and made 110 copies and distributed it to all his co-workers. But unfortunately, this got him fired. He tried to keep all his 76 clients but welllll...it didn't work. He ended up with only ONE client, his LEAST IMPORTANT client,Rod Stewart(Cuba Gooding Jr. -won best supporting actor for his role here) He left the company with one client, one goldfish(Flipper) and one loyal accountant, Dorothy Boyd(Renee Zellwegger). The rest of the movie shows how he got back on top again, how his only client became a star again and how Jerry Maguire finally understood the true meaning of love. The whole 2 hours kept me laughing and smiling all the way. This movie is mainly about love, respect and loyalty. <br />    The really hilarious part was when Rod made Jerry yell \\"Show me the money\\". I just kept on laughing!!!! It was sooo funny! Dorothy's son,Ray (Jonathan Lipnicki)was sooo cute!!! I loved all the scenes where he was with Jerry. I was like, \\"aww[...]\\"!!!! OH! And my most favorite part of all was the near-end part wherein Jerry realizes that he truly loved his wife(That's Dorothy. They got married in the middle part, by the way)and that he wasn't COMPLETE without her. You know the famous line of the movie right? hahaha! It's actually \\"You complete me\\". That's the unforgettable line of this movie. Call me sappy but i just loved the part where Jerry said that line. I'm just a sucker for romance movies! LOL!=)
B000060P79|5.0|simple plan has the greatest music ever!!! they have the best lyrics to there songs! i really enjoy falling asleep to there music and also waking up to it!!! it just makes my day the best day! i can really relate to there lyrics! keep it comin guys!!! ur the best ever!
B00004U8JV|5.0|Don't get me wrong, it's a great movie, but for a Spieldberg film, it bites the dust. <br />It is very LOOSELY based on the book. Where's Levine? Hammond is alive? A rescue mission? Nuh-Uh. he movie is nothing compared to the GREAT book.<br />Ian Malcom and a rescue squad go to an island to rescue his ex, Sara [in the book, SHE comes after HIM]. His black [?] daughter sneaks on [in the book, she is white, her BEST FRIEND is black, who also sneaks on in the book]. He never figures out what InGen was doing on Isla Sorna! Meanwhile, some bad dudes are transporting dinosaurs to San Diego [might be in the book, might not've reached it]. I know for a fact the San Diego scene is not in the book.<br />Overall, I really liked this fantastic movie. It is great, but not based on the book!
B00005JKBC|4.0|It's a bit strange that the caption or subtitles cannot be turned off by simply pressing the &quot;subtitle&quot; button on the DVD remote control unit, as you can for most other DVDs.  For this one, you actually have to open the DVD menu, and click to &quot;Language&quot; setting, only here you can turn off the subtitle/caption.  There you go, preston!<br />The subtitles are, however, a bit unproportionally large.<BR>All said, the movie is an exciting spy thriller.<br />Lastly, for those who have never been to Hong Kong, the US Embassy in the very beginning is actually the head office of HSBC bank, it looks way more cyber-cool than the real US Consulate though.

As he draws readers into the scenes and dialogue, they are easily tricked into becoming characters of the story. There is a simple, active writing style that's easy to understand. Figuring out the underlying meanings that fall in between Hemingway's words is a more difficult task. It's a great book with many implications that deal with human nature. Read it for fun and read it to realize how easily people go through life without actually living it.
B0000668IF|3.0|When I first heard 'Play', Moby's brilliant album which sold over 10 million copies, I was stunned at the quality and scope of the songs that are made up of seemingly simple vocal tracks and instrumentals. It almost seemed like it was an amazing fluke. I didn't exactly know what to expect from '18', but I was sceptical if the album sounded anything close to the first single 'We are all made of stars'. I quickly came to notice that NONE of the following songs on the album are even close to the opening track. This has made me question the motives behind the marketing of this album; it seems to me like Moby decided to make an extremely somber and personal album but when he decided to release it his record company kindly asked him to produce maybe just 1 or 2 songs which they could actually release as singles. That's probably not what happened exactly but it's obvious why 'We are all made of stars' is the first single and why either 'Jam for the ladies' or 'Extreme ways' with maybe 'Harbour' released for a little contrast will be next to be heard on the radio. <br />I'm not saying that this album is bad, but it's....it's like something you'd only want to hear while you're in a very very abstract mood. It's hard to relate to any of the songs. Many of the songs are beautiful and calming and emotional but, for me, that's not really all I'm interested in. This album doesn't have the universal appeal that 'Play' has; therefore, it will probably only sell only a modest amount of copies compared to the outrageous 'Play' sales. I honestly think it could have been much better.
B00005LK1N|5.0|I have compared this 2001 HDCD with the 1994 version and there is no contest. I thought the previous edition was good, until I heard this one that is.<BR>Even without a HDCD decoder in your player this re-mastered disc is probably as close as we'll ever get to the original master tapes, before the oxide flakes off them completely. I mean they're 30 years old!!! <BR>If you're a fan then please experience this classic with all the sonic detail possible. Unless there's a 24-bit DVD-A version looming in the wings. But that would mean buying a whole new player for the privilege of course.<BR>This HDCD edition though, has the most gorgeous miniaturised gate-fold sleeve and original artwork.<BR>For YES-head/hi-fi buffs. This is the best version, bar none!
B000002JS6|5.0|As a hard-rock fan I can honestly tell you that it is pretty much impossible to determine what the best hard-rock album of the Seventies was, but during the Eighties nothing ever surpassed (nor probably even came very close to) the brilliance of the 1980 classic Back In Black. In fact, Back In Black is arguably the last example of all-time classic hard-rock album, and the vast majority of rock bands today can only dream of putting out something with this staying power. Or, if you will, something this good.<br />Following the tragic death of charismatic singer Bon Scott, AC/DC had to prove themselves and the fans that they were still able to put out something memorable and, even most important, that they were able to create a fitting tribute to the man who, more than anybody else, had defined their sound and attitude.<br />Right from the first notes of Hells Bells, you can tell this is a hell of an album (no pun intended). Few albums open this ominously, and few albums are this monolithic in vital energy and power. All the AC/DC elements are still there (apart from the different voice): Angus' and Malcolm's dueling guitars, Phil's and Cliff's tight rhythm... but Back In Black really is something special. It's a celebration of the ribirth of a band, a celebration of the ribirth of rock 'n' roll, a musical tribute to one of the last true, authentic rock 'n' roll hard workers, and a collection of some of the best tunes in hard-rock history; Hell's Bells, Back In Black, Rock And Roll Ain't Noise Pollution, Given The Dog A Bone, You Shook Me All Night Long... gosh, all these on this same album?!?! With Brian Johnson in what is his finest hour (certainly not the Brian Johnson with ruined voice we are listening to since the late 80s) Back In Black is simply one of the most incredible albums of all time.

Along with this album, I also own Diary of a Madman, Bark at the Moon, The Ultimate Sin, The Ozzman Cometh, and Down to Earth.  I thought it was going to be just another ozzy album- its not.

078062565X|5.0|That's the archetype of Beauty and the Beast. The Beast is a surviving creature from antedeluvian, prehistoric times. A monster, a Beast by its size and its looks : it is nothing but a big chimpazee or gorilla. But that Beast is the ancestor of man and has feelings. The Beast is surviving as a god for some primitive tribe in the Pacific Ocean and he is transported into New York as some kind of grotesque exhibit in a show on Broadway. Civilization appears as trying to make a profit out of nature and its inhabitants. It turns sour because the Beast is in love with the main actress who was offered to him by the primitive tribe. We just need to get the Beast on top of the Empire State Building, its most famous achievement of all, for the film to be complete. But the Beast can only inspire curiosity when securely tied up and fear when at large. So the Beast, another archetype, has to be put to death without any more thinking about. Beauty and the Beast, the giant wild creature, its love for the beautiful blond woman, its final destruction and we have the pattern of many films that will come afterwards, even the pattern of some horror or burlesque films of today. As such this film is essential in the American cinema.<br />...
B000002JS6|5.0|Read the title- that's all I need to say...but I'll say more anyway.  I own nearly 160 cd's, and I'll have to say that this is in my top five list.  It is simply amazing.  There is not one bad track on here.  Standouts are \\"hells bells\\", \\"shoot to thrill\\", \\"back in black\\", you shook me all night long\\", \\"have a drink on me\\", and \\"rock and roll aint noise pollution.\\"  Brian Johnson couldn't have had a better debut album.  A must have for any music fan.
B000002B5L|5.0|i agree with the other reviewer.i'm tired of lauryn hill's old fans ESPECIALY HER &quot;NEW FANS&quot;,put down the other members of the group.their ALL talented,and pras gots to be one of the most underrated rapper in rap,along with wyclef.i beleive the reason they broke up was because of lauryn hills new found fame and her new fan base.laury's fans are like the yoko ono to the fugges. people blamed yoko ono for breaking up the beatles i blame lauryns fans for breaking up the fugees.this was one of the best albums to come out of 96.i think the fugees should get back togeather and just replace lauryn.and let her fans keep her.they should replace her with this other singer who can rap,sing just as good as ms hill,and sing dance hall raggae.i forget her name but she's perfect.
B000002H97|5.0|Everyone seems to think that Metallica &quot;sold out&quot; when their self-titled album was released.  What in god's name were they thinking?  Well, actually it did sell out- 18 million copies.  This is Metallica's greatest album by far.  It is actually a compilation of music and not just a lot of uncontrolled noise.  James's voice is at its best.  Lars' drumming is spectacular- his best so far.  The Black Album also contains some of Jason's and Kirk's best work.  I strongly recommend this if you are any kind of hard rock or metal fan.
B0000668IF|5.0|The new Moby album '18' has a pretty good chill and ambient feel. Most of the songs do have vocals though.  While the early half of 'Play' had some rockin tracks, there isnt as many on '18' and when there are, they are not very noticeable.  As a whole, this album does not take Moby to any new places, musically.  But seems like a great extension of the feel of the songs at the end of Play and his ambient tracks.  And it basically takes a few listens to it before you can really get into it. <br />   The songs that do rock out are \\"Jam for the Ladies\\" and \\"Extreme Ways\\" which feels like (fills about the same track number) as \\"Machete\\" from 'Play\\".  Not to forget to mention the single \\"We are all Made of Stars\\", while its very catchy musically, I tire of its vocals, but that could be because its on the radio a lot. <br />   My two favorite tracks after the first few listens are \\"Signs of Love\\" and \\"Harbour\\" which Sinead O'Connor lends vocals on.  After a few more listens, \\"The Rafters\\" shines through in its excellence because of its power.  It sounds like it could really blow the roof off. <br />   The song called \\"Sunday (The Day Before My Birthday)\\" is interesting because the song uses some of the same chords that were used in \\"Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad\\" off 'Play'.<br />   \\"Sleep Alone\\" and \\"At Least We Tried\\" are lightly songs that are weepy with their minimal melodies and soft vocals.  \\"In this World\\" has a part where it sounds like Moby just banged on the piano keys, and almost randomly, thats hard to hear on the first time.  <br />   While my review was completely out of order and didnt touch on all the tracks, bottom line: Buy '18' if you like Moby, it'll grow on you.  If you havnt heard Moby, start with 'Play' because it has a variety of styles and once you get into that, this album will follow along.  Get this if you're someone looking for some chill songs with a great groove. Moby's music has always been very relaxing.
B0000062S0|3.0|This is a good album. I say that remembering what these guys were a part of a long time ago. Zep came to my town (Winnipeg MB. Canada) way back in the late sixties or maybe 1970... if you remember the 60's you probably weren't really there! If Zep ever happened or not this would be a good album. Good not great! <br />Page and Plant are both talented musicians and songwriters but this album is missing something that cuts it short from being great. The tasty licks are all there and the sound is smooth with just the right amount of drive and intensity to make it a &quot;good album&quot;. <br />I look forward to the day when these two guys decide to put petty ego behind them (where the Hell is John Paul Jones?) and show us what three talented, insightful and slightly arrogant bastards have to say to the world!<br />This is a good album but it could be (and probably will get) a lot better.
B00005OWEG|5.0|Apocalypse Now Redux, that is.  Apocalypse Now also is quite good, but not only was it not Coppola's full vision of the film, it doesn't hold the epic granduer that this version has.  This version, which stretches nearly 3 and 1/2 hours, fully captures what Coppola, who was quite sane and comfortable in the Zoetrope studio a few years back assembling this edit, wanted.  The new scenes were omitted for various reasons.  One scene, with Laurence Fishburne telling a story about a grunt who liked to poke holes in particular places in Playboy's, was omitted because of sound quality.  The French Plantation scene and the extra scene with the boys fooling around with the Playmates were perhaps omitted because of the censors in 1979.  There was already plenty of nudity in the original cut, plus the French Plantation scene may have been too far removed from the boat, if you understand what I mean.  Other new scenes extend Robert Duvall's performance and also add some humor.<BR>This definetly is the greatest depiction of Vietnam ever.  Ever.  Oliver Stone grabbed Charlie Sheen (In case you've been living under a rock, that's Martin's son) and tried to captivate Vietnam from his own personal experiences.  PLATOON was a good movie, but was not as good.  FULL METAL JACKET was also a decent outing.  Suddenly, out of nowhere, wannabe Vietnam flicks tried to capture what Apocalypse Now did.  BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY and now WE WERE SOLDIERS.  But when I first saw this film, it stayed with me for quite a while.  I kept thinking about it, the broad scope of it, the cultish following of Kurtz, the amazing electronic score by Coppola and his father, and perhaps my favorite moment- many children with Kurtz staring in at Willard from his prison with bright light shining in.  Wait a minute, that's nowhere near as moving as the scene at Wa Tang bridge, which was so bizarre yet so Vietnam, so I guess, real.  We all have our favorite.  Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks wish they could do thistype of cinematic war epic, but they still haven't.  <BR>    Viewer discretion is strongly advised for this version (even if you're over 17!).  Profanity is quite explicit (including references to female organs), there is even more nudity, and there's the drug use.  Violence is actually not as bad as I expected.  We really don't see many people dying.  We just see dead bodies everywhere.<BR>     Extremely deep.  Highly recommended!!
B00005JKED|1.0|I thought with the Oscar award given to Denzel that this would be a great movie, with great acting. Boy was I disappointed, what a stinker. If this is indicative of how Oscars get selected, I guess garbage like this will win many more. Don't waste your time or money.
B00005NWM3|2.0|Coming from a country that is most commonly associated with dorky mounties, ice hockey, and the French, Nickelback had the odds against them when it comes to popularity in the states. Fortunately, the band's heavy chords and Chad Kroeger's raspy voice make Nickelback sound like anything but canadian twits. Over the past 2 years these neighbors to the north have gathered a decent sized fan base of rock loving americans. Indeed, Nickelback is the embodiment of pop. When you start talking music,however, they are another story. Their new album Silver Side Up opens with the fierce anthem &quot;Never Again,&quot; which blantantly condemns the act of domestic abuse. The follow up is the cleverly crafted &quot;How You Remind Me,&quot; a song whose catchiness is undeniable. &quot;Woke up  This Morning&quot; is mildly enjoyable, while &quot;Too Bad&quot; is another crafty combination of power chords that molds into another mind numbingly catchy tune. And then there is nothing....every track from then on is monotone. You could combine any of these songs into one and you could hardly tell the difference. Thankfully there is a trace of difference in the closing track &quot;Good Times Gone.&quot; Lyrically nothing challenges the mind or stirs the emotions of the listener, it's all pretty straight forward. Although &quot;Never Again&quot; strays from the other songs by addressing the seriousness of domestic abuse, it does not prove to be insightful. Overall, Silver Side Up is an unoriginal album with a few catchy tunes. If you enjoyed &quot;How You Remind Me&quot; or &quot;Too Bad&quot; then you may enjoy a couple more of the songs, but will not find anything like the band's previous two hits. If you're looking for a hidden gem or latent depth in this album, you'll find none.
B00005TT77|1.0|A friend of mine let me borrow this disk for a listen claiming that it was the hottest thing on the shelves.  I could barely make it through the intros of the songs.  John Lennon and George Harrison are surely rolling in agony in their graves. I would equate the production of all of the songs to N'SYNC trying faithfully to cover Helter Skelter.  Perhaps they should have had Madonna doing a cover of Lady Madonna with a hip-hop beat.<BR>At least that would have been different and somewhat amusing.<br />The artist's attempts at being \\"true\\" to the originals comes out annoyingly \\"FALSE\\"!!!!  Do NOT waste your money on this, unless you have never heard a Beatles song in your entire life.
0446608955|5.0|A Walk to Remember was simply excellent! It was beautifully written. I fell in love with the characters almost immediately. I wanted to read on forever. Definetly a book you will not be able to put down.
6305537798|5.0|In addition to being about a great Shakespeare play, Ten Things I Hate About You is awesome and funny. I could really relate to that character Kat, but I'm negative for different reasons. Of course. Anyway, this movie is a favourite, and I never get tired of watching it again and again. Buy it.
B000066AXC|5.0|I very very rarely say a movie is perfect, but this is indeed one of those times.  Don't let anyone spoil the movie for you, or even give away a bit of the plot, especially if you don't know about John Nash.  I went into the theatre knowing only Nash's theories, and was enthralled by the plot which had so many turns I left the cinema questioning my OWN sanity.  A Beautiful Mind creates a delicate balance between biography, mathematics, sanity, insanity, comedy, drama, and a bit of love.  No element overshadows the others, and the mood can shift so swiftly from a moment of sheer hilarity to a heartstopping dramatic scene.  Don't expect a historically accurate biography, don't even expect a detailed look at Nash's life.  A number of facts in John Nash's life were intentionally altered for dramatic and commercial reasons.  However, Ron Howard's intent is to examine the triumph of man in overpowering his intense schizophrenia without the help of medications, leading to the recovery of life.  <BR>Russell Crowe is a brilliant (if not at times bumbling) mathematician who can evoke tears and laughter in the same instant.  He has set a certain standard for portraying mental illnesses that I doubt any other actor in this century will live up to.  Equally as incredible is Paul Bettany (yes, last seen as a nude Geoffery Chaucer in A Knight's Tale) and his portrayal of Charles, one of the figments of Nash's schizophrenia, who reminded me of Charlie from Dead Poet's Society.  The balance between Nash and Charles was intricate and astounding in its simplicity. <BR>It is utterly unique, challenges both intellect and sanity, and is well worth the $[money] for the video.
B00005YUTD|5.0|My daughter started watching this video when she was 3 or 4 months old.  We also had Baby Mozart, but she seemed to prefer this one.  Now at 16 months old, she loves to do the chicken sounds that start the video off (Bach, bach, bach -- get it?)  I highly recommend this one for your video collection.  The music is a nice alternative to Mozart and babies love the sounds and visuals.
B0000668IF|4.0|Even though I don't think this album will enjoy the runaway sales of Play, I'm not sure that too many artists could ever count on that kind of success and in any case, Moby isn't trying to break Michael Jackson sales records.  What he does try to do is make music that connects with some basic human emotions that a lot of us are feeling.  I've listened to it all the way through about 5 times now, and I'll say that it took me two complete listens to decide that this is definitely a gem, though not a five star because I don't think it \\"changes\\" anything, certainly not in the way that Play did when I and many of us first heard it.  Play has more songs that \\"hit hard\\" if that makes sense, like the first 8 cuts (\\"Honey\\" through \\"Natural Blues\\") and \\"Run On.\\"  18 only has a few that jump out at you like those earlier songs, like the current single \\"We Are All Made of Stars,\\" the probable second-single \\"Jam for the Ladies,\\" and the last two songs \\"Rafters\\" and \\"I'm Not Worried at All\\" which conclude with a more energetic tempo than is characteristic of the rest of the CD.  Overall, this is pretty smooth, laid back music, but like I said, it has a warmth and feeling to it that makes me feel really comfortable listening to it, whether closely or in the background.  It's subdued, reflective, a bit melancholy, but never despairing.  It helps if one has an appreciation of pop music styles of the '70's because there's a fair amount of disco strings and other effects that kind of bring that era to mind.  In fact, the more eclectic your musical tastes, the more likely this CD will continue to hold your interest.<br />Lyrically, you might read the words off the page and figure there's not much being said, but Moby has a knack for finding phrases that are expressive, and the vocalists render their simple phrases effectively.<br />His talent is as a song assembler, so one shouldn't approach this CD looking to hear innovative musicianship, flashy audio pyrotechnics or tripped-out mind-altering sounds.  And as a dance record, it would not do much to liven up the party.  I know that Moby CDs are still stocked in the electronica/dance music bins but that's probably because there's no more convenient place to put this kind of music.  But it's no guarantee that people who like the Chemical Brothers, Orbital, Aphex Twin or Paul Oakenfold (all of which I like a lot) will dig this stuff.  In fact, a lot of Moby haters may be found among the fans of such artists, because he's now seen as a sell-out or just kind of dull if one is looking for high-energy recordings.  And if you didn't really see what all the fuss about Moby was before listening to this project, I very much doubt that you'll hear anything new to change your opinion.  As for me, it will be playing pretty regularly for the foreseeable future.
B00005YXZH|2.0|Oh, well- Call me unhip, call me hypnotized with Top 40 playlists- Call me oh-so-un-alternative-<br />But call me someone who needs a melody to connect with a song.<br />Wilco - Tweedy - whatever - seems to have abandoned the need for connection and is railing against all things &quot;establishment&quot; to a point where he's one step from being another basement-pirate artist that cranks out navel-gazing noise that he, himself, finds oh-so-interesting in a 4am daze with incense burning, coffee pumping through his blood matched only by the nic-fit that his crumpled box of Marlboro's delivers.<br />I've been to the mountain-top, seen Wilco live, bought the last record, which still clung to some need to make accessible songs, and I felt my blood boil when Wilco's old label said &quot;Yankee&quot; was a &quot;career-killer&quot;.<br />It is...but the REM potential of this singer / songwriter needs a serious lightning bolt to keep me interested.<br />Resist the pull of the basement-pirates, Tweedy.

B000002UAX|5.0|Although Im personally a Hip/Hop, R&B and Soul fan, I consider this album a masterpiece. Actually my personal music taste is meaningless, since this album is in the league of true art. Those [people] giving this album a bad-rating are self-important people who probably would say: I dont know what the fuss is about Picasso, he cant draw...<BR>In other words, this is timeless music, such as Beethoven, Mozart and so on, not just pure Pop.<BR>This isnt just a music album from a Sixties band, this is art...PERIOD.
0790729644|3.0|'Unforgiven' is a good story which is bogged down by too much manly talk.  Gene Hackman, of course, gives the best performance as a paranoid, dictatorial sheriff of the town of Old Whiskey.  After kicking English Bob unconscious, Hackman is at his absolute scariest.  But the scenes with Clint Eastwood are boorish and embarrasing.  The worst is when Morgan Freeman asks  Eastwood if he misses sex.  It is supposed to be funny, but is unnecessary and bad.  The film tries to make Eastwood, who was once an assasin,  look like some born-again saint.  Although it is plausable, I found it hard to believe because Eastwood was both the director and main actor.<br />The plot is about three assasins who are supposed to to kill one man.  This man has slashed a woman's face, but wasn't punished for it.  The film has some tense moments, espicially the final shootout between one man and an entire bar full of people (even though it was very unrealistic).  'Unforgiven' has a lot of talk about past shootouts and how once Eastwood was the best dualer of them all.  Then there is more talk about some other shootouts.  Some may find that interesting, but to me it was just boorish.  See it for Hackman's performance though.
B00005JKJA|1.0|Without going over the plot as other reviewers have done already, I simply want to say that the emperor has no clothes. This is amateur, pretentious filmmaking at its highest peak. Much sound and fury signifying nothing. The acting is second rate at best and the overall script unbearable to sit through. See if you can tell what the point of it all is. Good luck.
B00005YW4H|5.0|A fresh new voice with a lot of backing talent and the maturity to choose/create meaningful lyrics, this debut album from the creamy, chocolaty voice of Norah Jones can be listened to in the background and is richly textured and meaningful enough to hold direct attention. The mixing of genres is nice without losing distinctiveness. If you like Sara McLaghlan you'll like Norah Jones, but Ms Jones has a more intimate and less pop sound.<br />I am looking forward to more from this artist. One thing I would want to improve upon (which may be a result of my digital playback equipment) is the placement of microphones or the emphasis on her piano and voice: bring the piano in to match her voice. Her piano sounds a little too deep in the back while her voice sounds elevated and close to center enough to lose the impression that she is playing the piano. (When you have a live sound this potentially good, keep it.)  But this may have more to do with my ear than anything else (I'm no sound engineer either). I heard her on David Letterman through a mono channel and it sounded better than the CD to me--barring the normal hisses on broadcast TV.<br />...But the sheer talent and class: I'm very happy with this artist.
B00004U8PA|5.0|This one of the classic broadway plays and it finally came to vhs. I couldn't wait till I was old too watch it. I watch it like every month because I love it so much. This movie has great song with magnificent dance numbers to go with the songs. I would recomend this movie to anyone over 13.
B00001OH7O|4.0|Dont get me wrong I like this album. But this album isnt one of my favourites and when I bought it I was a slight disapointed. this though kinda changed his career and made him more succesful. this album containes though a few of his most famous songs and is probably one of his most memorable LPs. If you are a fan this is probably yours. Want to be a fan this is a must have and want to buy anything with DAVID BOWIE I suggest you buy this later because This was one of my first ones and I was not really that happy about it but it is indeed good.
B00004T37H|5.0|Me, being a anime lover, know this kind of stuff. I know that anime is not to be fooled with. Anime is more challenged than what others really are. Anime brings out the best in people. It always has something that will make you feel either sad, andgry, or happy. These things I feel are what make an anime important. This movie I thought was GREAT. For it's kind of work, this movie has to a 5 star. It has a smooth flowing storyline. A bit bumpy plot, but after that... Its absolutely beautiful. The violence may be there, but everything else overpowers it. At the end of the movie, this movie made me tear up. I hope this movie will pull it's affects on you too.
0792156684|3.0|Don't get me wrong, I love TITANIC but I found it odd how the disc transfer was only limited to the bare bones! A theatrical trailer, that's it! Come on! This is the most expensive movie, highest grossing movie, most critically acclaimed, and most award-winning movie an there are zero extras? Cameron's other films are fully loaded. TITANIC gets the shaft while lesser films like AMERICAN PIE 2 are blessed with double disc sets with hours of bonuses. This pains me beyond belief as a film buff. I remember a well-done special that was once on FOX about the film and would've been perfect on the disc. A commentary, for crying out loud! A million filmmakers and castmembers and no commentary track? Insane! This disc should be the most overwhelming, extra-ladden DVD ever made, but instead only got left with the standard. The picture and sound quality is top notch, but once you're done the movie you're anxious to find out more. There aren't even any cheesy production notes! Collectors, skip this DVD unless you really love the movie. I only hope that J.C. realizes this and is in the works of a TITANIC SPECIAL EDITION. Now that would do it justice.
B0000640SA|5.0|this is one of the best movies ever. althouh when it first came out i rented it and watched half of it and thought that it was really stupid. But for the next few days i thought about it, so I ran all over town looking for a copy of the dvd and finilly find it at a grocery store. I watchedit five or six times since and can't wait to buy the new limited edtion that is choked full of goodies inbcluding a commentery by nolan and rumored altrenate version that unfolds chornilogiclly. If you don't like thinking movies your wasting your time you need atleast 110 to understand this, movie so everyone else go watch bubble boy again. The best and most underrated movie of last year. I have to love it am buying it twice and not even mad about it like i was with Almost Famous which is another great movie with a crummy and great version.
B00005K3LU|5.0|DIE HARD is without a doubt, the most superior action movie of the eighties and the top ten of my movies of all time. The transfer is exceptional. The sound is the best! Bullets, booms, screams overwhelm you. One thing I love that I think all DVD's should have is a segment that explains the need for widescreen in maintaining the director's vision. Several trailers and T.V. spots, audio and text commentary tracks, state-of-the-art animated menus, outtakes/deleted scene reel, magazine articles, and. . . an editing room for scenes from the movie! Here is a disc that does justice for a movie that does the action genre justice!
0064407667|5.0|I used the book as a read-aloud to my kids of 12 and 10. Lemony Snicket knows how to write. The first thing we noticed was the humorous way Lemony builds your vocabulary -- a word here which means \\"understanding the meaning of words\\". The story flows at a good pace not boring readers for a moment. The characters are colorful and well defined. The books isn't long and the writing is good for readers of 4th grade (and possibly 3rd grade) and up. While the story is truly unfortunate, it's very humorous. Thus, children shouldn't find it frightening or worrisome. The situation the children find themselves in shouldn't concern kids as it is just so outrageous. There are good plot twists and a moral lesson to be learned. It's just a darn good book.
B00005JKQZ|5.0|It would be impossible for anyone who appreciates intense acting and a compelling story line to not like \\"A Beautiful Mind.\\"  As a therapist myself, I must add that this film provides the best and most accurate portrayal of a man dealing with mental illness that I have ever seen.  The acting is exceptional, the story well-written, and even the haunting soundtrack is most fitting. Oh, and major KUDOS to Mr. Ron Howard for his brilliant decision to take movie audiences on this exceptional journey through the eyes of Dr. Nash.  Russell Crowe has given yet another Oscar-caliber performance; it's so unfortunate that personal Academy Member jealousy and racial politics robbed Mr. Crowe of the Oscar that he truly deserved.  No offense to Denzel Washington (another exceptional actor), but Russell's performance was without question a more difficult one.  Shame on the Academy!
6301640659|4.0|After watching \\"The Celluloid Closet\\" I had to see this controversial film for myself. It was controversial because of the depiction of the leather/s&m aspect of gay life, but I don't think the makers of the film meant this depiction to represent all gay life. In fact, there is a disclaimer that says just that. And, the film has a positive gay character, the writer Pacino's character befriends. Granted, he is brutally murdered by the end of the film (sorry to ruin that for you).<BR>Controversy aside, I enjoyed this film because it was gritty (I like gritty) and because of its depiction of the transformation of a (seemingly) straight cop (Pacino) who, while undercover in the gay community trying to catch a murderer, finds himself questioning the sexuality he thought he was so certain of.<BR>I like that the film dares to suggest that there are hidden impulses inside all people, and that the most macho heterosexual can find himself attracted to another man.<BR>Granted, I can see why the film caused such an uproar, but I don't condemn it. <BR>I would recommend the film to viewers who want to see a thought-provoking, original film. Also, I want to see the director's cut. When will it be out? The film so obviously was massacred by a fearful editor, but I am still amazed the film (with its homosexual content) was released in 1980.
B000002P7R|2.0|One million stars for Pali Gap (on CD finally!), and this is a really cool version of Power of Soul, but &quot;scraping the barrel&quot; comes to mind. Granted, it's Jimi's barrel, but I wonder what he would think of this release.
B00005JKJA|3.0|Taken as an allegory, Mulholland Drive works well.  It's wonderfully scripted and acted when you consider how demanding it is to make &quot;camp&quot; palatable, and somewhat eerie at the same time. Mr.Lynch is talented, there's no denying that, but his contempt for his audience is unsettling.  Maybe it's just me, but I honestly felt that the last 1/3 of the movie was there to &quot;break it down&quot; for those of us that couldn't make the connections.  If he had reservations about the plot so much that &quot;spoon feeding&quot; the viewer was necessary then here's an idea...don't be so (insert expletive) cryptic!

B00005YU1O|5.0|Take film as a medium and inject the creativity that should be the standard, but isn't.  Add the visuals of a calibre reminiscent of Cezanne, Renoir, and Kandinsky.  Stir in a love for the spoken word as a conveyor of ideas with impact.  Let stew for an hour and a half.  Voila, you have &quot;Waking Life&quot;.  Knowing the box office marketability of an art piece in America, I can safely say that it took guts to make this film.
B00005TT77|1.0|Unless you're wearing hasmat gloves & goggles to destroy all copies in print, run for your life (no pun intended).<br />Not that Beatles compositions are above covering (Joe Cocker, Grant Green, etc.), but if you're just going to do a cloying remake that adds nothing...\\"I better stop now, 'cause I got a weak heart.\\"
B000021YQV|5.0|These guys have influences out the wazoo, but they've managed to make their sound distinctly unique to their abilities and their message.  With hints of Zappa, King Crimson, Tool and a gypsy caravan tambourine show, we're treated to incredibly tight song after tight song, and with the music ever-present despite the album's heavy politics.  They don't treat the record as a chance to preach.  They rock you out, and you wake up the next day thinking, &quot;Gee, why do I think funny now?&quot;<br />Classic album, seriously.  And I'm not a rock head.

6300215814|5.0|I managed to catch this movie one Sunday afternoon with nothing to do.  I only saw bits and pieces over the years.  I'm glad I did because Audrey's performance in this movie was absolutely her best, even better than her Oscar performance in &quot;Roman Holiday&quot;.  I really felt sorry for her character, Holly Golightly.  Everyone she comes in contact with gets hurt.  Even when Paul offers to help her, she can only rebel away from him.  She doesn't know what she wants in life, except financial freedom.  In a way, her character tells us a little bit about ourselves.<br />If it airs on any of the cable movie networks, please don't miss it!!  You won't be dissappointed!!

Some may call it limp-wristed or weak and well, it sort of is. Let those barbarians dwell in clueless misery. Give this disc a few listens and succumb to its goodness. Irresistable tunes here.
B000002UDB|5.0|But still... I always thought this album got a bum rap.
B00005JKED|3.0|The strength of this movie is Denzel Washington and his ability to keep you wondering if he's a bad guy or a good guy.  The first time I saw it I was a bit disappointed by the lack of principles and guts of the Ethan Hawk character... but the second time I watched it I realized how difficult it was for him to know whether he was being tested or corrupted.  He was in over his head and he knew it.<br />Very well written and really great acting!!!!
B00004Y6NP|4.0|You get the feeling that this was the one that Knopfler always wanted to make. Longer, jazz influenced story songs with lush production, punctuated by the occasional bursts of pop. Starting off with three ready for popular consumption cuts(&quot;So Far Away,&quot; &quot;Money for Nothing,&quot; &quot;Walk of Life&quot;) Knopfler eases the listener into songs that take longer to reveal their direction. Experimenting with more musical complexity, Knopfler occasionally gets pretty far away from the core sound of Dire Straits; particularly on the interminable &quot;Why Worry&quot; which seems to take forever to finish. But this is a minor quibble when you realize the sophistication and lyrical quality of the songs make this one of Dire Straits' better efforts.
B000008JUM|5.0|Great  interpretations of classic songs by current rock and pop stars. Not one bad song here and won't collect dust on your shelf after  three weeks, like most dispensible pop shlock.
B00003CXI1|1.0|I wish I had read the book first. I am sorry to say that this is the first movie I've seen in a long time that was a complete and utter waste of my time. Not even worth getting out on video, I'm afraid. The plot is shallow and unexplainable and the acting is terrible, mostly by newcomers. They should never be featured in another movie on the silver screen. Hopefully they won't make a sequel (or three), and kids will decide stick with the books. Apparently they are much better.
0790729725|5.0|Why would you slight a flawless movie because of the limitations of its format? So what if you have to flip the disc over? Rise up off that couch and turn that bad boy over...the exercise will do you good. Just because Warner Bros. has made some of the worst choices for their DVD releases in the format's short history...that's no reason to slight the movie itself by giving it a one or two star rating. <BR>Stepping off of my soapbox now.<BR>This movie is superb. Fantastic. \\"Goodfellas\\" shaped my life, having first seen it when I was 10. It's what made me want to be involved in drama in the first place. The pure jolt of energy that leaps off the screen--big or small--is powerful enough to make even the most ardent 18th century Anthony Hopkins period-drama fan become infused with a zeal for profanity, violence, and pure movement. The epic sweep in \\"Goodfellas\\" rivals that of any more \\"respectable\\" drama you could think up. <BR>And the cast, what more is there to say? Liotta, with the face of an angel and the mind of a devil. Bobby D, just playing it super-cool and tight. And Joe. Well, nothing really needs to be said about Joe, but to quote George Carlin, another inspiration, \\"Y'know who I pray to? Joe Pesci. I pray to God to get rid of my annoying neighbor. It doesn't work. Then I started praying to Joe Pesci. In 2 days he was over there with a baseball bat and straightened my neighbor out pretty g-dd-mn fast!!\\" Take heed, my friends.... take heed.
B000000H64|5.0|With it's sounds of industrialness and with the mix of strong lyrics, this album does get the 5 stars.  For a sophmore album, this was great, the songs really tell you alot on what Burton Bell was thinking.  The song &quot;Zero Signal&quot; for example, tells about the story of how he is nothing to someone who he cares for....or at least it sounds like.  Another thing about this album is its not short, blasts out about an hour of entertainment.  The digipack is great, it includes for extra songs.  &quot;Your Mistake&quot;, &quot;Resistance&quot;, and two remixes: &quot;New Breed&quot; and &quot;Replica&quot;.  Although the remixes are not great, but the two other songs are good for bonus tracks.  The album kind of gives you the futuristic views on the world, lol.  Just as the song &quot;New Breed&quot; signifies....the title is self explanitory.   It's too bad to hear that this year 2002 they've departed, that's a shame to hear.  Well they've done a good job working over the years.
B00004Y6NX|5.0|This was the one where it all came together for Dire Straits. A longer format for the songs give the band more time to build the songs into an epic form. Dealing with love and life more personally than on their previous works; Dire Straits creates &quot;movies&quot; with their storytelling. Each song captures the imagination with Knopfler's expressive singing and delightful musicianship by the band. (with great piano from the Professor, Roy Bittan)Nearly perfect? Well, that last cut just gets more and more annoying as the years go on, &quot;Les Boys do cabaret...&quot; Yeesh!

0812550706|5.0|I first read Ender's Game two years ago when I was 13 or 14 and I liked it but not until now, after I've re-read it many times, have I come to understand what the book is really about. The story seems simple enough on first glance. Ender Wiggin (I love him more and more each time I read the book. He's just so cool) is taken from his family at the age of 6 and sent up into Battle School in the asteroid belt. There he is pushed past his limits, both physically and emotionally, as he plays war games that the teachers, his enemies, lay out for him. Then he is taken off to Command School where he meets a new teacher who is smarter than he is (::gasp::). Ender plays games on a simulator, against this teacher, only to find out in the end that they aren't games at all. At the end of the book he is completely torn and weighed down with a deep sadness and guilt.<br />However, the book is not just this story about beating an alien race in a war. Through Ender's thoughts and feelings, Orson Scott Card raises many moral and ethical questions, including the fight in the bathroom and the concept of Ender's compassion. Ender's understanding of the mind was something I found especially interesting, because I've read all the Ender books that are out (including the newest, Shadow of the Hegemon) and since I think that understand what Card is trying to convey about Ender, I sometimes find myself so annoyed with characters who don't realize that the Speaker of the Dead is also Ender the Xenocide. <br />Nevermind. The point is, Ender's Game is an amazing book, one of my favorites. And it is not shallow and solely readable for entertainment either. It is deep and thoughtful at the same time. You will find yourself wishing you were Ender's friend, wishing you could help ease his burden, wishing that there are more people like him in this world. Because from the people I know, there is no one like him, and I love him all the more because of it.
B00005RYKV|5.0|This movie is great, not too slow, like Fireworks is too many people.  The action scenes are intermixed well with Takeshi's usual trivial (sometimes humorous) scenes.<br />It show a good contrast between LA thugs and the Yakuza back home.  If you thought his other movies were too slow, this will not disappoint.
B00005NWM3|4.0|When I first heard &quot;How You Remind Me&quot; on MTV, I liked it, but not enough to buy it. Well, come my birthday, I got my friends to waste their hard-earned money and buy me CDs. Everyone had one to buy me except one, so I forced him to get me this because I couldn't find anything else. Glad I did.<br />1.Never Again-4/5-A song about drubk-beatings and viloence. I believe this is the only song that cusses. See, not EVERYONE needs a Parental Advisory sticker. (I hope Fred Durst reads this)<BR>2.How You Remind Me-3/5Yeah, you've heard it. I give it a 3 due to how many times I've heard it.<BR>3.Woke Up This Morning-3/5-The verses are bad and annoying, but the rest is cool.<BR>4.Too Bad-5/5-Yes, you've heard this one, too.<BR>5.Just For-The intro is very bad, the verses are OK, and the chorus is good. Happy?<BR>6.Hollywood-5/5-Best song on the album. Catchy verses and cool choruses.<BR>7.Money Bought-0/5-Listened to it once and didn't like it, so I don't know what to say to review it.<BR>8.Where Do I Hide-5/5-Reallly cool lyrics about being an outlaw.<BR>9.Hangnail-0/5-See #7.<BR>10.Good Times Gone-3/5-Strange lyrics and so-so music. Should've saved #8 as the outro.<br />I bought this CD before &quot;The State&quot;, and I STILL don't have that one, so I can't call them sell-outs yet. Anyway, I recommend this if you like Default, Linkin Park, Staind, Creed, or Puddle of Mudd.
B00005JKCF|5.0|When I went to watch the Spiderman movie, I wasn't sure what quite to expect. I had an idea, but not sure. Everything in the movie left me happy, though. It reminded me of the spiderman animated series I would watch on TV when I was a few years younger. Peter Parker had that charming attitude with him and those sarcastic, charming sort-of sayings of his. The movie was true-to-life with these and other aspects of everything I remember from the animated series. I was VERY pleased. I always loved the Spiderman cartoon series and the movie only improved upon what I expected to see when I watched the cartoon as a kid! I'm happy with the movie :-)
B000002G23|4.0|Well they were pretty darn good. Although this boxed set is far from comprehensive, it features the band's albums and the bulk of their better b sides, single mixes and soundtrack contributions. There's no doubt that Sting, Copeland and Summers were talented musicians, songwriters and performers. The band managed to deliver compact, hook driven pop songs that rarely disappointed.<br /><br />Most of the band's finest moments belong to Sting. Towards the end though Copeland began to blossom as a songwriter. Although never quite as consistent as Sting, his best moments were every bit as powerful as the bassist's.<br /><br />The sound is exceptionally good for this set although the individual Japanese original releases on CD are probably the best sounding versions out there. The track \\"Shambelle\\" has a couple of second clipped off the beginning and there are some other minor flaws but, on the whole, this is a solid set for the average fan.<br /><br /> The packaging and notes are very good. The truth is pretty well glossed over (no surprise there) regarding the difficulties in the band (there is some reference to the difficult relationship between Copeland and Sting but very little of substance to back it up). In many respects, the booklet presents the santizied version of the truth (whatever the truth may be as really only these three guys know).<br /><br />Message in a Box captures all the essential moments (and some not so essential ones as well). While The Police didn't burn as long as many bands, they burned brighter than most during their very short life.
B000008COG|4.0|the third best Brian Johnson album. The only bad song is ruff stuff and it is HORRIBLE!That&quot;s the way is a  my third fav AC/DC song!
0345350499|1.0|Christianity made its way into a culture where sorcery and sin reigned untouched, and the views of the women of that period in time hardly are recognized.  The novel, The Mists of Avalon, tells the death of the Avalon culture to the beginning of the crusades and a tale of King Arthur from a woman's perspective.  The book uses symbolism, magic, and battle as well as describing the daily lives of its characters to create a mystical look into the conversion of a culture.  Though the subject matter may be one of intrigue and history, the book itself proved to be a thorough disappointment.  The novel seemed to be over eight hundred pages of sheer boredom.  The novel sheds light on the conquests of King Arthur and the effect he took on the countries abroad.  It shows the frustration of letting go of old tradition to embrace new tradition.<br /> Igraine, who was married to a man named Gorlois, had a daughter named Morgaine.  Morgaine was of the traditional religion of Avalon and she eventually became a high priest.  Gorlois eventually died leaving Igraine to marry a man known as Uther Pendragon.  Igraine and Uther had a child whose name was Arthur.  Morgaine and Arthur loved each other as a brother and sister should.  As time rolls on, the two split up and created lives for themselves.  They meet up again unknowingly in a mystical religious ritual.  Arthur referred to as \\"the Horned One,\\" impregnates Morgaine, who is his sister.  What was just described in half of a paragraph took the author over 40 pages to describe.  Though some parts are entertaining, the entire 40 pages was a complete waste of time.  This pattern was reiterated throughout the entire novel.  The novel wasn't too pleasant in the area of sexual morality.  I had to skip a few parts because it was just too filthy.  The book is full of incest, adultery, and lust.  For example, Morgaine had sex with her brother, Arthur.  The book unintentionally highlights and encourages sinful behavior.<br /> The medieval period<br /> brought new thinking, new lessons and interesting history.  Some history is explained in this book.  It tells a little of Arthur's conquests.  The novel, in more than 50% of the chapters contains one type of sinful behavior or another.  What took 800 pages could easily be reduced down.  The author gets into far too much detail and draws out the piece to a point where reading it would seem a chore or a burden.<br /> The novel, in its entirety was dreary and drawn out.  The author spent too much time defining every detail down to its most minute aspect.  Joy and peace were not encouraged, but after finishing, I felt more joy than ever because I was not burdened by the weight of this 800-page piece of literature.  A few historians may enjoy this novel.  This novel is definitely not for children.  People that are interested in the spreading and dying out of religions would be interested in this piece.  This novel applies to an age group of 19 years of age and older.  Other than a few exceptions, most people under the age of 19 would not be able to fully respect a novel of this magnitude.  It is also not a very positive learning tool for the youth of today.  It teaches and encourages bad behavior, which our culture has enough of already.
0062502182|1.0|This book reminds me of &quot;The Celestine Prophecy&quot; because it is very poorly written and extremely cheesy.  However, it will be a big hit I'm sure with emotionally unstable spiritualists who took a wrong turn at the crossroads of religion.<br />Paulo Coelho must have smoked more hookas than his characters.  This book spans the spectrum of &quot;GAG ME WITH A SPOON writing&quot; as the main character &quot;listens to his heart&quot;, &quot;talks to the desert&quot;, &quot;becomes the wind&quot;, &quot;understands the soul of the world&quot;.....and achieves countless other feats that even Jesus Christ would envy. <br />If you like Ouija boards, believe in fate, or think that spiritual healers can slap you on the head and make cancer go away, then you might like this book.  You might also need a therapist.
038533558X|4.0|After reading &quot;Tell No One&quot;, I was addicted to Harlan Coben, so I approached this one with a good deal of trepidation, mainly for the reason the story sounded so similar...Was I wrong!!  This is a thrilling piece of fiction, a rollercoaster ride than keeps up until the totally surprising and unexpectedly touching(for a thriller, anyway)ending. I just have one gripe...maybe I'm dense, but will someone explain the epilogue???
B00002MZ2T|5.0|Savage Garden's AFFIRMATION betters their debut album, which didn't seem to be a conceivable feat. AFFIRMATION truly delivers some top notch songs. The album was produced by Walter Afansieff, and all the songs were written by Darren Hayes and Daniel Jones. The album opens with the uptempo, positive title track which is a basic commentary on society today, with a positive message. &quot;Hold Me&quot; and &quot;I Knew I Loved You&quot; are both beautiful ballads, reminiscent of their past hit &quot;Truly Madly Deeply&quot;, both beautiful romantic ballads. &quot;Crash and Burn&quot; gets my vote for best song here, an inspiring don't give up kind of song, with a catchy chorus and a beautiful inspiring message. &quot;The Lover After Me&quot; and &quot;Two Beds and A Coffee Machine&quot; are both heartbreakingly real and honest. Other highlights on AFFIRMATION include &quot;The Best Thing&quot;, &quot;Chained To You&quot;, &quot;The Animal Song&quot;, and &quot;I Don't Know You Anymore&quot;. Give this album a try, it has some infectuous pop songs which will make you want to laugh and sing, and some beautiful ballads which will make you cry and think. Overall a consistenly good album.
B00005JG6Q|5.0|Akira is a masterpiece any way you look at it, whether it is the great plot, the incredible animation, or even the stunning musical score.  I won't spoil things for those who HAVEN'T seen is by writing a review here, but if you haven't seen it then you desperately need to.  The only downside to this disk that I have currently found is in the new English dub of the film, which is drab and unemotional throughout.  This is countered by the fact that the original Japanese audio tracks are present along with subtitles on the disk.  This is by far the most worthwhile addition to my DVD collection.  I sugguest Ghost in the Shell as another valuable DVD purchase.
0307165485|5.0|I remember reading this classic as a child and wearing my copy out!  I just recently acquired another copy for my teenaged son mainly as a joke gift (he's a tuba player and I think \\"Schtoompah, the Funny Austrian\\" is a sketch of a story, describes my son to a T!)  It's interesting to get an older child's take on these stories, which have great morals and lessons to be learned from them, even at an older age.
0385247125|5.0|Before reading this book I had never read a book in one day.  I couldn't put it down.  He talks about his childhood, his strict father, his love for children and nature, the success of Thriller, his relationships with Tatum O'Neal, Brooke Shields and Diana Ross.  (He refers to Diana as his lover, sister and mother).  I am a big MJ fan so I may be a little biased.  If you want to know the truth about Michael Jackson read this book.
B00004XQ83|2.0|Don't get me wrong I am a huge bluegrass fan, and I'm glad to see its revival in popularity. However I fail to see the greatness in this soundtrack. The soundtrack is slightly overrated by the success of the movie in Hollywood. Sure we have the heavyweights of bluegrass music, such as Alison Krauss, Gillian Welch, Emmylou Harris, The Cox Family, Ralph Stanley and more. They are great, they've turned in excellent performances here. However, the flow of the songs seems to be uneven. Did we really need four versions of &quot;I Am A Man of Constant Sorrow&quot;, which isn't even a truly great song to begin with? Overall its a fair collection, but quite long and filled with filler as they say. I would be cautious when considering this purchase, sample the tracks, come to your own conclusions. If you want to get into bluegrass, some of the more recent albums that just shine include Dolly Parton's THE GRASS IS BLUE and LITTLE SPARROW, Patty Loveless' MOUNTAIN SOUL, Nickle Creek's self titled CD, Rhonda Vincent's THE STORM STILL RAGES, among a few.
B000002UB3|5.0|This album is amazing. It is arguably the Beatles best (Revolver and AR are very close). The first side features songs by every member of the Beatles, even Ringo. The best songs on this side, in my opinion, are Something(Harrison's best song ever), I Want You (She's so heavy), which has an almost hypnotical guitar instrumental part at the end, Come Together, and Here Comes the Sun. The second side is amazing, in that, it is basically continuus music the whole time, starting with the excellent You Never Give Me Your Money. The best songs on this side are probably Mean Mr. Mustard, Carry That Weight, and The End. Overall Abbey Road is absolutely incredible. It has some excellent guitar work, especially in Something and The End, which both have great solos. I love this album, and everyone should hear it at least once.
B00005QGAZ|5.0|For MJ fans this is a must have.  You get to hear Michael's demo of Billie Jean and you hear a little bit about the process artists go through when making an album.  There is also a song on the special edition that is not on the original LP.  Vincent Price raps a verse that is not on the released version of Thriller.  The rest of the CD sounds good.  I didn't compare it to the original album so I can't say whether or not the sound quality is better on the special edition.
B00005QG9J|5.0|I loved this album. I must have listened to it like a hundred times. It is such a great cd, the lryics are the best yet by Incubus and the music is so innovative and well recorded that everything falls together to make this amazing amazing record. I loved every song, it filled every need of mine in a good album: hard rock, like 2 or 3 soft good well writen songs, and an album that you can play each track and like as much as any other. Buy this album it will change your feelings towards music for the better. I give it a ten!
B00004STPT|5.0|i loved this one from the bottom of my heart. all that i wanted was on this cd. amazing music, wonderful beats and a lovely voice. if you're one of those who just love to wander into your very own world and dream away ...this one's for you. <BR>all of the songs are very good but my favouriteis 'now we are free'...its the voice of lisa gerrard that captures your soul; its a pity that this one gets over too soon. i just love to turn up the volume and let the music trance me...it does and it also gives you a good boost of inspiration..if you know what i mean. <BR>each song has its own story to tell and as you listen you're already picturising the entire movie..i believe thats the whole essence of a good soundtrack. <BR>no wonder i've seen this movie twice always wishing i could see it once again. <BR>no other soundtrack has had such an impact on me..truly .<BR>so go ahead...see for yourself....let the music enthrall you and make you crying for more.
0385505833|1.0|I bought the book because I'm a sucker for Christmas stories.  I thought that the premise sounded great because the older my husband gets, the more \\"bah, humbug\\" he also gets.  I thought it would be fun to read about another household and their reasons for giving up Christmas for a year.  While it's a cute story, I read it in about two hours.  I wish that I had gotten it from the library and saved my money.  The book is short, and you're paying close to $[money] per page to read it.  Amazon has 20 pages of excerpts, which is about 11% of the book.  In this case you could read the excerpts and have gotten a pretty good handle on the book.  The story is more suited for a magazine like Redbook.  There is very little development of the characters; 177 pages doesn't leave much room for that.  It's a good summer day at the pool read if you borrow it from the library.  But it's not worth $[money].  Save your money and buy the Mitford series or Cold Tea on a Hot Day.  Both are lighter reads but with far more interesting and developed characters and plot.
B00000IQC8|5.0|Clerks is a great movie.  I'm a Kevin Smith fan, which you may have to be to enjoy his films.  This one is small, tight, and very well written.  The entire movie covers just a single day.  It's about friendship and it's about love and it's about how rare it is to find a woman that'll bake you a lasagna and bring it to you at work, the day you weren't even supposed to be there.
B00005R87Q|5.0|This movie was very refreshing.  Yes, it had great cars, beautiful women and lots of action.  But, it also had a great storyline that was portrayed exceptionally well by the directing, production and ACTORS.  It was gritty enough to seem (almost) real and still fantastic entertainment.  I'm not one to like movies just for car action scenes and this film does not disappoint.<br />Now, if I can just get that Nitrous kit for my own car...<br />Enjoy!
B000053VAF|5.0|Dogma is another great film from Kevin Smith.  I think it's a pinnacle creation.  I'm not Catholic, and I don't go to church, so I don't know how I'd feel about this film if I did, but I really enjoyed it.  I think it has a lot of guts, and I think Kevin Smith has a lot of guts to do this story.  It's all about an angel, that got thrown out of heaven, that'll do anything he has to, to get back in.  And he does.  I also think that Kevin Smith's choice of God is magnificent.  Way to go Kevin.  I try to watch this film at least every other month.
B00005R2M3|5.0|Shakira's first english album scores on many levels. The writing is wonderful. You can tell that she is in love right now. The instruments bring to mind Latin America as well as Shakira's other cultures. Her voice is beautiful even though she has a slight accent. Sure to gain Shakira tons of English Speaking American fans Laundry Service is worth it's weight in gold!
6305648522|5.0|Cinema Paradiso is a very beautiful film.  It's all about how the town's projectionist teaches a little boy a love and appreciation for all kinds of films.  The boy grows up to take over as the projectionist and then becomes a film maker himself.  I know that doesn't sound like much, but it's an absolutely beautiful film.  If you absolutely hate sappy stories about love and friendship, don't waste your time with this film.  Besides, it has subtitles.
B00005OM4N|4.0|When listening to Britney a young Janet Jackson comes to mind. Some of the tracks like Boys (Nasty Boys?)even seem to have a Jackson flair to them. While the album does have a few Jems like Overprotected and Let me be it's obvious that Britney is still tying to find her own voice. A okay effort from an okay artist.
B00003CX5P|5.0|I think that this is a great movie.  I know a lot of people gave it a bad review when it came out.  Here's what I think.  The first Star Wars film came in 1977, more than twenty years ago.  The second film, The Empire Strikes Back, was, at that time, considered to be a very violent film.  Well, in the past twenty years, R-rated films pushed the envelope of violence so far forward, that when The Phantom Menace came out, people forgot that it was just a PG rated film.  I think that they were expecting it to be an R rated film.  For a PG film, it's great.  For a sci-fi film, it's great.  I even think that JarJar Binks is ok.  Nobody can tell me that the pod race is not a good piece of film.  The same is true with the final attack on the droid ship.  I watch this film at least once a week.
B00004Z459|5.0|If a CD sells over 7 million copies it's probably pretty good (except for Brittney Spears). Every song except for &quot;A Cure for the Itch&quot; is soild or excellent.  I highly recommend this CD.
B00000DGUG|5.0|A cool album, on many levels.  Numerous songs have that 'up front curb appeal' that so many listeners seem to crave, while darn near all have real appeal at the deepest levels.  A truly fun offering.  Not to mention the album artwork, which contrasts slickly with the first &amp; third studio albums (various artistic interpretations of &quot;show yourself&quot; and/or &quot;show a little skin&quot;).
B00005JKCF|5.0|I went to see Spider-man last night and it was awsome from beginning to end! After seeing MTV's Spider-man behind the scenes and how spectacular the special effects were I knew this was a must see. It has something for everyone from explosive action to romance. Fans old and new will love it!
B00005JKJA|1.0|I didn't understand it after the first watch but after reading more about it, the movie does make sense. Sure its an interesting exercise in film making. Sure its got some very moving points in it. The problem is the dreamside has people that are actually likable where as reality has none. ...
B00005JKCF|4.0|Only this phrase could say so much about spiderman, It kicked butt!And surely it did. Spiderman is the most impressive comic book turned to movie yet. I remember seeing Superman:the movie and in awe about how interesting it was. Christoper Reeve was Superman and I thought no one could have played him better. I feel the same way with Michael Keaton as Batman and now I can say the samething about Tobey Muguire.He stealed the show with his nerdish and cunning acts as Peter Parker Honestly I was never really was a Spiderman fan ,but I knew that there were comic books out that's really all I needed to know ,but the movie has changed my reasoning about Spiderman. I savered every second of that movie and hoped it would never end!!!Cheers for director Sam Raimi, who is known for his famous Evil Dead series (I've seen all of them at least a million times!)He has brought a lot of heart and compassion to this movie. When I realized last year he was making the movie, I said to myself he will make the diffinative Spiderman movie. Cheers for Kirsten Dunst as the girl next door, Mary Jane (M.J. for short). Cheers for William Dafoe who took this challenge and rose up to it.He was my favorite charactor throughout this movie!What a pro! Anyways go see Spiderman and have a good time... You'll love it!
B00005NGZX|5.0|nowa days metal seems to go one of two ways. you get your cool matal stretching from people such as tool through to paparoach-kerrang type bands.the other way is far darker-the seething underground.basically speaking if you are a spiritual mentalist then coverge will blow your mind.some compare converge to dillinger and technically the music is similar, but their tunes have a more emotional impact. FORMYSELF tracks 9 through to the secret track are the greatest moments in the world of music, ever. harsh and heavy, yet so thoroughly beautiful.
079284632X|5.0|So many people put this film down, when rightfully, it is a cult classic. The acting from both the raped girls and Krug is brilliant, even though the rest struggle with their roles.  The film has to be the scariest thing Wes Craven has ever done, simply because of it's taboo subject - rape. It sure has hell got me thinking and by the end of the film I wanted to kill the rapists myself. The plot is very believable and shouldn't be snubbed as much as it is.
B000000H42|3.0|What can you say about Mercyful Fate's \\"Don't Break The Oath\\"? The album is nearly a complete triumph; however, in the end you can only shake your head and lament over the album's fatal flaw. The strength of this album clearly resides in the music. The guitars, bass and drums weave a dense and malevolent mood that make the album the dark musical masterpiece that it is. Tracks such as \\"A Dangerous Meeting,\\" \\"Nightmare,\\" \\"The Oath,\\" \\"Gypsy,\\" and \\"Come To The Sabbath\\" create a dark and evil atmosphere that leaves the listener with a feeling of doom. The guitar interplay between Shermann and Denner is both chilling and refreshingly original. That only leaves vocalist King Diamond to be discussed. What can you say about his guttural moans and banshee shrieks? You either love him or hate him. I personally think he fits the music brilliantly, but that's not to say he is a great singer. His range is often so ridiculous that the spell woven by the music is nearly obliterated. King Diamond often uses his range to shocking excess, but ultimately I think his voice is a bizarre plus for the music. So what ultimately is the problem with \\"Don't Break The Oath\\"? The LYRICS plain and simple. Never has an album been so fatally undermined by the ridiculous and juvenile nature of the lyrics. Diamond's apparent unrepentant Satanism is so unbelievable that one wonders what he was thinking when he wrote the stuff, and if he actually practices what he preaches why he hasn't been committed! The lyrics rarely deviate from a rabidly anti-religious/pro-Lucifer stance. At least Slayer made devil rock provocative. So given that the music is excellent, the singing weird but completely appropriate and the lyrics often being completely outrageous......what's my assessment? Buy the album and enjoy it!! It's great classic Heavy Metal...Just don't turn to the lyrics to discover the secret source of wickedness in the world...you'll be disappointed and will probably end up on the floor laughing.
6305754950|5.0|I cannot say what it is exactly that I love about this movie.  It came out in theaters many years before I was born and I am not a fan of westerns.  However, the cast and the way they interact separates this film from other types. James Caan is excellent as \\"Mississippi\\"!  I saw it on the AMC channel last year and had never heard of the film before then and was instantly hooked and had to buy the DVD. In the few months I have owned it, I have already watched it several times.  It is amazing to also find out that other people are big fans of this movie as well.  I recommend that you at least rent this first to see if you like it and I think that you will.
0156012197|5.0|If you're familiar with Martin Buber's \\"I-Thou\\" (where each person confirms others as having unique value) and his \\"I-It\\" (where each person knows and uses others but does not really see or value them for themselves) you'll find these concepts exemplified in the story of The Little Prince. This relation is made evident through Antoine de Saint-Exupéry's juxtaposition of seeing the world through the eyes of a child with seeing it as an adult.<br /> In the first few pages the narrator explains that as a child he drew a picture of a boa digesting an elephant. When he showed it to adults they could only see a hat--meaning that it's hard for adults to understand what children see and imagine because the adult's take things for granted and at face value. He keeps the drawing wishing of someday finding another who sees it as he does, but since the narrator is now an adult he too is losing touch with the uniqueness of the world around him. When he meets the Little Prince he shows him the picture, the Prince identifies it as a boa digesting an elephant, and they become friends.<br /> Eventually the narrator comes to the realization that because of his friendship with the Little Prince he can now see what's important in life. Through the Little Prince he again learns to see the world through the innocent eyes of a child. <br /> In a nutshell: the Little Prince helps him reinvent his individuality and rediscover his childhood innocence.<br /> This is a great book.
B00005JKJA|5.0|Att.: Excuse me, if there are some mistakes in the text, because english isn't my native language, but I hope to make my points clear. <br />It is not easy to say something about 'Mulholland Drive', because the movie isn't normal, and the fans also aren't (I am the best proof for that ;)). <BR>You will love the movie, or you hate it. But who will like this movie? If you like the other movies from David Lynch, you will love this one.<br />It's hard to make the movie work for you, here is the way I made it working for me: <BR>Don't spoil the movie to yourself befor watching it. DON'T read ANY analysis. The movie is only that worth, what YOU can get out of it. Any interpretation by thirds will destroy your own experience. And that's, what the movie truly is, it's an experience. Even if it's build up logical, when you see it the first time, you won't be able to explain it in a logical way. It will only work on an emotional level. Free your mind from what you expect from regular movies and just let go.<BR>After you saw the movie, it's of course interesting to discuss it with other people, and that's alright. But please, build up you're own opinion first.<br />I think, the DVD is nearly perfect. Sound and Colours are excelent. Of course, there is nearly no bonus material, but it fits to the movie. There is, for example, no audio comment by David Lynch, and I am really greatful about that. And audio comment would perhaps explain a lot, but it would destroy everything for you. <BR>Another point is, that the movie is delivered in only one chapter, and I also think, that makes sense. When you see the movie for the first time, you won't understand much, but when you make breakes while watching the movie for longer then five minutes (for visiting the toilette and the fridge ;)), you won't have not chance to understand anything. So only watch the hole movie without breaks.<br />I hope, my 'instructions' will help you a bit to enjoy the movie, because it's worth all the work!

B00005YW4H|2.0|Norah has a lovely voice, but I was expecting a sound truer to the jazz genre.  Her sound fits more closely in the folk category.  If I knew this prior to purchasing the CD, more than likely I would not have bought it.
B000000OQF|5.0|This CD (album) was absolutely groundbreaking when it came out.  It changed the face of rock and roll.  It introduced us to the next phase of rock music.  The vocals are extraordinary.  The guitars will go down in history and the rhythms were right on.  A classic CD from the moment it was released and worth listening to if you are a fan or rock and roll. <br />You can feel the tension between the band and how they are feeding off each other.  It was a band on its way to implosion but this was the pinacle of their career.  The hard edged rock project. <br />In a word - - SLAMMIN'!<br />Buy it - feel the hard groove - and enjoy it.
B000063DIR|1.0|I have been listening to the original album for twenty years. It is one of my favorite albums. I got it for the first time when I was 10 years old. I have to agree with all the negative reviews. The album simply does not sound right. Again, after listening to the album probably hundreds of times, I have the original vinyl release, original CD, 1995 remaster, and now this new one. If you listen to them together you really notice it, although I noticed right away because it is so different. The mix is all wrong. It's as if the life was taken out of the recording. Besides the fact that the album does not sound right, I think it is wrong to replace tracks on an album that has already been out for so long, especially by new musicians. I have no problem with remasters that are supposed to sound better, with todays technology, but replacing musicians is just plain wrong. Ozzy should just pay Daisley and Kerslake what he owes them for writing, producing, and playing on this album and Blizzard of Ozz. It is because of these first two albums that Ozzy has been so successful with his tours, other records, merchandise, and now the TV show. He should be happy he is making so much money and thankful that these albums have sold well, and just pay what he owes the other musicians. I would not recommend this album, the 1995 remaster sounds the best. I would also add that this is an insult to the memory of Randy, and shows that Ozzy is not very sincere when it comes to his memory. He has now put money (when he already has so much) over the love he says he has for Randy .
B000002W4V|5.0|I was going to Camosun College in Victoria circa 1974 when I first heard this concert played on Album Hour, a local FM station which played new releases for the benefit of those wanting to hear new sounds. I had heard of the Velvet Underground but can't say I was a big fan. The intro to \\"Sweet Jane\\" was barely 10 seconds old when I cranked the stereo and sat back and listened to one of the best live recordings I had ever heard. <BR>  This was something I wasn't expecting. I was captivated by the sound which told me Lou Reed had a band that could handle his approach to the songs. Steve Hunter and Dick Wagner were awesome as they battled back and forth (reminding me of Andy Powell and Ted Turner from Wishbone Ash). <BR>  \\"Heroin\\" is still as haunting as ever and the cascading flow of music from the band surrounds the painful lyrics as Lou battles his way through the highs and lows of addiction. You can feel the lonliness of being empty.<BR>   \\"White Light/White Heat\\" is well done and \\"Lady Day\\" trends along Lou's distinct style of vocals but the song that leaves me wanting more is \\"Rock & Roll\\". Its a great behind the wheel song and showcases Lou Reed as a great rock and roll singer. I never got to see Lou Reed in concert but as long as I can listen to this disc on at my leisure, I'm sure this is as close as it gets.
B00003CX5P|4.0|Terrific story telling the origins of Annakin Skywalker and Queen Amidalla, the start of the Emporer Palpaltine's activities and the Jedi Council. Gerat action and special effects with interesting characters including the annoying Ja-Ja Binx. I thought that Annakin's master was the most underated character of the entire movie. Made for aan interesting start to the Star Wars series.
B000002OHX|5.0|Any exile from the 70's realized that some of the best live acts to grace the stage included Wishbone Ash. I was lucky enough to see them twice although the guitar pairing of Andy Powell and Ted Turner were the diamonds in the rough. When Laurie Wisefield replaced Turner, it took a little off the live act even though some of the later material (especially \\"There's the Rub\\") was excellent. <BR> Live Dates was a compilation of Wishbones early albums and contains standards such as \\"The King Will Come\\", \\"Warrior\\" and probably one of the best guitar songs played out in the classic \\"Rock & Roll Widow\\". Listen to Powells flying \\"V\\" and Turners magic fingers perform the accented bird sounds as brother Martin (bass) and Steve Upton (drums) keep the beat steady. All the material played here is well written and performed. No filler in this double album (I still have the original vinyl). <BR> No doubt that any guitar lover will cherish this recording for years to come. Don't hesitate, it's worth every penny.
B00004WEJZ|1.0|This movie (a Warner bros picture and not officially a part of the James Bond series) is a turkey!  My god, can Connery get much older looking?  The simple fact that this is a remake of Thunderball is enough reason to stay away.  It's better than You Only Live Twice, but thats not saying much.  The video game sequence for world domination is incredibly stupid.  Connery should have stayed retired, stayed out of the Arcades and out of Octopussy's wake(a hit Bond film released the same year).  STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE... you've been warned.
B000002UV9|5.0|This is a superb album - certainly one of the best I have ever heard. Of all albums I have heard in my life, this is only the 2nd or 3rd album in which ALL sings are really good. Superb vocals by Geoff Tate, great guitars by Chris DeGarmo, and superb balance of intense vocals and music in all tracks. A great variety of songs as well.<br />Don't even think about it - just go ahead and buy it !! If like me, you're an overly cautious type, who doesn't buy too many CDs, listen to the song previews and you'll be convinced. I was, and buying the CD is a decision which I'm really happy about.
0679745203|5.0|Ondaatje is a superb writer.  The English Patient is a brilliant book.  Ondaatje's genius is to reveal characters as people are revealed in life - not in linear chronological narratives, but in glimpes, flashes of lightning, disconnected anecdotes.  Sometimes contradictory, always fascinating. The book takes the shape of these disparate images and recollections slowly coalescing to form four protagonists:  Hana the Canadian nurse, Almasy the English Patient, Caravaggio the thief, and Kip the Sikh deminer.  They are isolated from the world in a postwar Italian villa, each with subtle motives defined by Ondaatje's profound attention to detail.<br />The prose is evocative, like Almasy's comment on Kipling:  to be read slowly and then reread.  Images and scenes slowly take shape like a jigsaw puzzle.  It is not until the final few pages that we finally learn what compels Hana to tend so devotedly to the mortally-burned English Patient, it is not until the final pages that Kip reviews his dedication to the British war cause.  The characters' evolutions come slowly and naturally as Almasy's stories of the desert catalyze the entire book.<br />The movie is not this book.  Read the book - it's brilliant.
B00005RFAI|5.0|This has got to be her best CD yet!I love all her songs!My mom says that I shouldn't listen to any of her songs because she say to much bad languege.But does it look like I care?NO!!!!!!! And that's also about Britney Spears.I like her hair do and I'm pretty sure they call her pink cause her hair's pink.So far her biggest hits are \\"Get the Party Started\\" and \\"Don't Let Me Get Me\\". They're both pretty rad songs but I like \\"Don't Let Me Get Me' more. I don't think she really likes the so called Britney otherwise she wouldn't have said \\"tried of being compared with damn Britney Spears\\" but she also made a so called statement saying \\"She's so pretty that just ain't me\\".So who knows if she really likes her or not.If you don't know yet, her newest song is called \\"Just Like a Pill\\".It's a good song and I like it even though I've only heard it like 5 times.She also has some other songs I'd like to mention.<BR> There is \\"respect\\" and \\"Wheeler\\".Respect starts out as some funky people singing \\"and a 1 and a 2 and a 3 and a 4\\" then some really odd noises come.Then the song starts.Wheeler has a different story.This talks about a girl who no matter what you do and no matter how much you hate me I can't get killed or you can't keep me down.Respect is about giving pink her respect.Get the Party Started is about well duh!Get a party started on Saturday night.And Don't Let me Get me is about being someone other than yourself or you hate yourself and you want to be someone else.This is pretty long but helpful.

B00005JKMQ|3.0|I believe that Will Smith is one of the most charismatic actors working today and looked forward to seeing him as Ali. Unfortunately, no actor can yet hold up to the original. Get the documentaries such as &quot;When We Were Kings&quot; instead of this film. Ali is still a larger than life human being who hasn't yet been captured in a fictional portrayal.<BR>This is a well-made film, but lacks energy and drama.
B00005UW7V|2.0|I would have to say that this is a tragic story. I saw it with my boyfriend and I couldn't stop crying. That poor kid just wanted to be accepted. Although he's a robot, it paints a picture of the need to love and be loved in return. There were a lot of weird, creepy parts in this movie that made my skin crawl. If you like this movie, I recommend the book called The Bears House by Marilyn Sachs (you can get it thru Amazon.com) You have to read it. It's supposed to be a kid's book but I think it's for everyone. It reminds me so much of A.I. Basically it's about a girl looking for acceptance. I loved the teddy bear in this movie, he was so cool. I cry when I think about the movie. It went on and on and got creepier and creepier and ended way too abruptly. It seems like there should've been more. It was heartwrenching. David's best friend, the teddy bear, was with him every step of the way. In a lot of ways this movie is very sweet. I don't know if I could watch it again. The ending just wasn't satisfying enough at all. David just wanted to be treated like an equal, loved and accepted... Someone should have told David about Jesus.

B00005QDW5|1.0|I guess I have a much different understanding of Floyd then most reviewers. This is a ridiculous collection that has no continuity or reason. For instance, SHEEP is sandwiched between 2 Gilmour floyd songs that lyrically have nothing in common with it. Also, when did FLETCHER MEMORIAL become the most loved song on THE FINAL CUT? It has great,humorous lyrics but I never would have guessed it would be the one song off that cd to put on a Best Of collection.Also, there is nothing from OBSCURED BY CLOUDS and the tune ECHOES should always be the last song, in my opinion. It is 23 minutes long! If you are not stoned it is 46 minutes long. Actually, they chopped out 7 or 8 minutes of it for the short attention span generation. If you are influenced by 3 minute television commercials and marketing in general I guess you would want to buy this. Also,why would GREAT GIG IN THE SKY be on here? Instead of HAVE A CIGAR or MOTHER or BRAIN DAMAGE? I don't even care about pink floyd at this point in their history. It takes Gilmour 7 years to write a damn album! Save your hard earned money unless you are one of the SHEEP that they used to complain about. I think they are pro sheep now because that is who keeps their wallets fat. I miss the days when Waters was in control and made Rick Wright cry.

B000053VAF|5.0|I've seen this movie more times than I can count.  As a lapsed Catholic, I appreciate the film's serious discussion of religious issues.  The fact that Kevin Smith can integrate those discussions with such riotous humor is an admirable feat.  The performances, from Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, Jay Mewes, Jason Lee, Chris Rock, and others, are fantastic.  (My only complaint: Linda Fiorentino is way too deadpan. On the DVD commentary Kevin Smith confesses he wishes he had cast Janeane Garofalo in the lead role; I wish he had, too!) If you are a religious person whose faith is not strong enough to withstand any challenges, by all means, avoid this movie.  If, however, you've got an open mind, you'll find a lot to love here.
B00005NGZX|5.0|Do yourself a favor: see Converge live. While this band's albums are masterpieces of the extreme, the experience of seeing them pull these songs off live allows the entire Converge experience to come full circle. Simply put, if you don't see one of their shows, you will never totally understand the genius that is Converge.

I never seen a woman moove so little on stage. But the worst of all is the ballet in the triunfal march there isnt any ballet!!.<BR>Vocally I find this performance great, but in matters of acting isnt that good.<BR>The Orchestra is perefctly displayed here, Maazel does a great job. <BR>I would rate with 5 stars If I would be thinking in the voices and the orchestra but If I had to rate acting I would put 2 stars.

B000066796|5.0|Sure it's hokey and trite but who cares with a cast that includes Hugh Jackman and a delightful scumbag in Bradley Whitfield?  The plot is implausible and Meg Ryan is getting to be typecast in these movies but she does it so well that it really doesn't matter.  Anyone who has ever read a romance novel will love this.  It's one of those romantic comedies that you will want to watch over and over.  Definitely one to own.
0446310786|5.0|\\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" is my all time favorite book. I have read it 3 times and each time it keeps getting better. It is one of those rare books that stays with you for a long time afterwards and really makes you think.
B00005V9QJ|5.0|Sade is the only r&amp;b artist that I truly enjoy. Her voice is so silky smooth. She doesn't sound like any other modern day r&amp;b artist that is out there today. She does not need to attempt to wail at the top of her lungs. Her truly unique voice sets her apart from the amateurs. I recently caught her live concert on MTV2 and was just amazed by how good Sade sounds as a live performer (as well as on cd), unlike her contemporary Mary J. Blige who sounds awful live but good on cd. Now while I do not normally buy live albums, I bought &quot;Lovers Live&quot; since I missed seeing Sade live in concert last year. I must say that this is probably the one live album that truly does sound live. The entire atmosphere of the album is relaxed and not forced like a lot of live albums sounds to me. While there isn't any new material on the live album, Sade manages to make her recent songs as well as old material sound new and refreshing. Her velvety crooning just breathes new life into &quot;Jezebel&quot;, &quot;Smooth Operator&quot; and &quot;The Sweetst Taboo&quot;. I truly enjoyed listening to &quot;Lovers Live&quot;. Too bad most live albums don't capture that live essence of the performance like this album does without trying. Simply beautiful and transcending.
6303433766|5.0|This movie speaks so well of teenage angst- but at an angle sorely neglected in Hollywood. Two teenage girls who form an emotional, physical and what is for them- a very spiritual bond. They are (as often happened in those days especially) deemed to be \\"diseased\\" because they were homosexual. Parents scramble to seperate the girls, which causes deep resentment and frustration. Adding further to the problem, are the odd habits and ways of one girl's family. Shocks there alone, enough to send the young girl off balance.<br />It is horrible that these events culminated in such a tragedy.. but the director here allows the story to encompass us entirely. He does not \\"interfere\\" if you will, and allows the girls story to play out quite well.
B00000K19E|5.0|This is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen.  Sophisticated, deep, and fascinating, the Matrix is sure to entertain anybody who watches it.  I would recommend this movie to anyone for entertainment, and especially to those who like to think about what they are watching.  This movie has multiple levels of interpretation.  It is a movie to watch over and over again.  Buy it, and you will not regret it.
B00005JKBC|1.0|As another reviewer mentioned, there is no way to permanently disable the closed captioning on this disk.  Once disabled, the captioning reappears at the start of the next chapter.  I can't believe that the studio distributed a dvd with this kind of manufacturing defect.
0345360338|4.0|I am a thorough admirer of Sharon Kay Penman's work.  She is a truly gifted writer able to bring long dead people and times to life via her meticulous research and gift for storytelling.  I was somewhat disappointed in Falls the Shadow though.  Granted, Simon de Montfort was an important historical figure and the events of his life are interesting so this should have been a great story.  Why then did this book turn out a little, well...boring.  I found it did not reach the same heights of engrossing storytelling as Here Be Dragons, the first book in the series, which I LOVED.  I also have to gripe about calling these 3 books a &quot;Welsh Trilogy&quot; as hardly any of the action in this second book takes place in Wales.  Falls the Shadow is certainly a well researched and written book and I remain an admirer of this author.  I look forward to more of her work but this one just didn't do it for me.
B00005B36H|5.0|These guys just don't quit.  Consistency, dignity, and superb musicianship coat this disc like syrup.  Equal to and different from their previous outings and still rocks the house like a motherf!*ker.  The best band and one of the best CDs ever, period.
B000066C1N|5.0|This has got to be one of the best CD's I have purchased in the past 3 years. The music is perfect balance between score by Hans Zimmer and pop/rock arrangements by Bryan Adams. The lyrics by Bryan Adams are very full of life and I enjoyed them very much. What I really like is that there is that feel of the adventure while listening to the CD. It starts very pop/rock, and then it blends to the score by Hans Zimmer but it is a perfect crossover, because later in the score you can find relation in sounds and sampling between two. It is really cool to be able to feel like you're on a journey while listening to this CD. The music makes you feel alive, lyrics are full of life and artwork on the insert is real cool too. This is one of those classic albums that we keep coming back to and cherish forever. Bryan and Hans did amazing job. Can't wait to see the movie!
B000000993|5.0|The best band out there throwing it down with authority.  This album proved you could have deep thoughts and still want to punch something...hard.  One of the best of the 90s and ever.  Too far ahead of its time to describe in mere sentences, the music speaks for itself and does just so with violent, penetrating beauty.
0345404475|4.0|i have not yet read any other pkd stuff...but, i think that perhaps i shall.<br />about the book...it is rather short, a little over 200 pages i believe, and very easy to read.  one does not find themselves reaching for the dictionary every other page, as with some other (and mainly my favorite) authors.  this is a nice thing if you have been reading some of more verbose of pkd contemporaries.<br />the plot is straightfoward, and follows the idea of much of what i deem to be the better of the sci-fi genre...philosophy under the guise of unlimited means.  pkd brings us to contemplate what our reality is, and i feel is commenting on how little of our own lifes we actually acknowledge, by showing how empty the androids can appear through the eyes of one who has been enlightened by the fallout.  by enlightened i mean simply had theyir eyes opened to what we take for granted: life.<br />the book shows the struggle of artificial life (us?) to make the jump cognitavely to what humans should be valuing.<br />a great read on a couple of levels...enough action to hold most people, and some theoretical philosophy slipped in there.
B00005QDW1|5.0|What can I say except for 'DO YOURSELF A FAVOUR AND BUY THIS CD!' <br />I have always liked No Doubt's music, but the only songs I really knew of theirs were 'Don't Speak' and 'Just a Girl.' However after hearing 'Hey Baby' on the radio, I bought this CD straight away. <br />I do prefer the 'rockier' songs on the CD, such as 'Don't Let Me Down,''Hella Good' and 'Making Out,' but the reggae-style songs are great aswell. Based on the strength of this album I have now bought two of No Doubt's previous albums and, while being very different, they are equally as good.

B00005LC1H|5.0|Fawlty Towers is a crowning achievment. It is one of the funniest, most clever shows ever to air on television. Short but sweet with only 12 episodes there are to be sure some lesser episdoes with &quot;A Touch of Class&quot; the first episode a bit weak, and &quot;Waldorf Salad&quot; the least funny overall. However, &quot;The Germans&quot; and &quot;Gourmet Night&quot; alone are worth the entire box set, being two of the funniest shows ever written. &quot;The Germans&quot; from start to finish is superb, stuffed so full of funny material, if you don't laugh, check your pulse. Favorite lines &quot;Yes you did. You invaded Poland!&quot; &amp; &quot;I don't know why we bother. We should let you all burn!&quot; The other episodes offer many hilarious bits of comedy, all better than most things on t.v. today. The box set with all the shows is well worth it. And the extras are great as well. I have always wondered what Andrew Sachs sounded like when not portraying Manuel. These are definitely discs to watch over and over again.
B00005RY7X|5.0|After listening to I GET WET, i was instantly addicted to the cd. With his uplifting, rock anthems like songs, they are short, quick to the point, and leave the listener wanting and needing more. With classic tracks as READY TO DIE, I LOVE NYC & the infamous PARTY HARD! we will always party hard, with andrew w.k.

B000002BMD|5.0|Everything Must Go is an incredible album showcasing the Manics at their peak. Coming off of the disturbing and dark The Holy Bible, Everything Must Go feels much more relaxed and optimistic, but it still harbors many sad, painful moments, most in the form of Richey James' remaining songs. Richey's disappearance is addressed in the beautiful title track, and due to the fact that he was a fantastic lyricist and crucial part of the band, his absense could have destroyed a lesser-band. But the Manics were able to continue on in a tasteful way without forgetting their lost friend. Nicky Wire's words cannot match James' one-of-a-kind diction, but the fact that the Manics' are at their best musically here makes up for any void left behind. James has five songs he left behind on Everything Must Go, including &quot;Removables,&quot; an emotional song about his self-destructive habits, and &quot;Kevin Carter,&quot; which is about the controversial photographer who took his own life. Wire's &quot;A Design For Life&quot; is perhaps the Manics' strongest single to this day with its burst of flourshing strings that avoids sounding pretentious and overdone. While the emphasis on pop and lack of punk influences might turn off a few Manics purists, they have never before produced music this beautiful, tuneful, and just plain amazing. Every Manics' fan should own this. And if you haven't heard of the Manic Street Preachers, by all means buy this.
B0000683DH|5.0|Coming on the heels of last year's release of Star Trek: The Motion Picture (Director's Edition) (TMP:DE), Paramount Studios along with director Nicholas Meyer is issuing Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan in an all new Director's Edition.<br />This new version will feature an all new 116-minute cut of the film featuring additional footage shown in the original ABC showing of the film back in the early 80's.  Also, although not confirmed, expect some redone Special Effects shots much the same way some shots were redone in TMP:DE.<br />This 2-disc set will include several featurettes including: the CAPTAIN'S LOG featurette (includes new interviews with Meyer, stars William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, Ricardo Montalban and writer/executive producer Harve Bennett), the DESIGNING KHAN featurette (includes interviews with Meyer, Bennett, graphic designer Lee Cole, costume designer Robert Fletcher, production designer Joe Jennings and more), The VISUAL EFFECTS OF STAR TREK II: THE WRATH OF KHAN  featurette, original interviews from 1982 with the cast and crew (including the late DeForest Kelley) and THE STAR TREK UNIVERSE - A Novel Approach by Authors Julia Ecklar and Greg Cox featurette (interviews with Trek novelists).<br />Star Trek II has been considered by Star Trek fans to be one of the best Star Trek films ever.  However, I'm impartial to Star Trek VI myself.  But that being said, Star Trek II had some very memorable scenes and plot lines.  The basic plot is a genetically enhanced superhuman from the late 20th Century has been found after exile from the original Star Trek episode \\"Space Seed\\" by the name of Khan.  He has commondeered the Federation Miranda-class starship Reliant and steals a new Federation experiment known as the Genesis Torpedo.  The Genesis Torpedo is a device that can terraform a dead planet into a living and breathing planet.  However his ultimate mission is to exact revenge against Cpt. (now Admiral) James T. Kirk for abandoning him on the planet Ceti Alpha V.  Khan pursues Kirk and the Enterprise around the system in some very exciting ship to ship combat akin to 18th Century naval warfare.  The battle ends in a climatic battle in the Mutara Nebula.  However when the battle ends, the Genesis Torpedo ignites and creates a planet out of the nebula.  Something that it wasn't supposed to be able to do.  And then we see the result of that in Star Trek III.<br />Nicholas Meyer was given the reigns of Star Trek II, and he wanted to transform the look of the Star Trek franchise.  Instead of the pajama style uniforms from TMP, he gave them Red Jackets with an open-fly type collar and Black Trousers and Boots.  This style of uniform remained with the series all the way through Star Trek The Next Generation in the episode \\"Cause and Effect\\" where the Enterprise D encounters an old Miranda class ship from Kirk's time.<br />But as for future Star Trek films in Director's Editions, Star Trek III is supposedly soon to follow.  Possibily before the end of the year, however I wouldn't hold my breath, being that it's taken almost a year to get this one out after TMP:DE.i Alpha V.

B00005NWLO|5.0|This live CD really gets rollin from the very first song \\"Workin' for MCA\\" Which reveals just how tight this traveling band was, also highlighting the truly gifted Steve Gains on lead guitar, the newest member.  As Workin' for MCA starts to end on its last note the beginning of \\"I Ain't the One\\" Starts up bringing you another great catchy rock song, again showing off one of the bands gifted guitarist. The CD continues to showcase the three guitarists of the band not fogetting to mention the crowd pleasing riffs played by the piano player or the bass player who endlessly plays a blues southern hopping bsss . As the CD plays on you will find most of the songs very melodic and most undoubtably finding yourself shuffeling your feet to the rythmic music of the Lynyrd Skynyrd band. The band plays their most popular songs like their anthem for the southern people \\"Sweet Home Alabama\\" following with the foot stompin' song \\"Gimmie Three Steps\\". Next the band does a remake of a song written originaly by J.J. Cale Called \\"Call Me the Breeze\\" Which has a piano solo in the song played by Billy Powell(I believe that it is by far the greatest acustic piano solo in all of rock n roll period!). And of course the most popular version heard on the radio the rock anthem \\"Free Bird\\" I give the CD 5 stars becauee you can play it over and over again and never get tired of the CD.
B0000640VN|4.0|This was one of the best romantic comedies that I've seen in a long. Ladies, if you're looking for a movie to curl up and stay at home with, well this is it. The movie is predictable in the sense that the boy meets girl, boy gets girl, boy loses girl, girl gets her man on the end. However, from the beginning to the end its a really good movie. I was not disappointed when I left the movie theater. I can hardly wait until its released on video on June 11.
B00004XONN|5.0|Radiohead's KiD A is without a doubt the most compelling, beautiful album of the last ten years. This album shoots them to the status of predecessors like Pink Floyd. Opening with \\"Everything in its Right Place\\", a song with only four lyric lines is of the most moving pieces of music I've ever heard. And that is only the beginning of an album undoubtedly worth owning. My favorites are \\"Everything...\\", \\"How to Disappear Completely\\", \\"In limbo\\", \\"Idioteque\\" and \\"Motion Pic. Soundtrack\\". It's incredible and Radiohead will be known as the most influential artist of the 90s/new Millenium!!!
0345404475|5.0|Okey, granted that this book is probably over-hyped amongest all science fictions, being the one the movie Blade Runner is based on, this is still a book you must read. First of all, the book adds the background that the movie never could, such as the love for animals, which trensends to the opposition of androids. It is a fairly visual book that will give you an all together different feeling than the movie. I decided to write this review really to counter balance the preious reviewer. Yes Dick's writing is not as a traditional novelist's. He writes in such a way that keeps you guessing what he really meant. Several of his novels have similar flavors, such as \\"The Man in the High Castle\\". I have read this book and loved his style, and am in the process of reading through his entire catalog. You will find his style quickly and decide for yourself whether you like it or not. If you choose to give it a try you will find one of the most bizarre mind and most interesting stories.

038533558X|4.0|Harlan Coben's latest stand-alone sure kept me guessing.  As with<br />_Tell No One_, he's constructed a plot here that contains twists and turns and new surprises all the way to the last page.  In fact, there are almost too many twists and turns--the book, at times, reads like he was thinking to himself \\"Ha, they'll never<br />see this one coming!\\"  It's to his credit that the book holds together.<br />Will Klein, whose brother Ken is suspected in the murder of Will's former girlfriend eleven years previously, and who has been on the run ever since, is suddenly faced with evidence that the brother he'd thought dead is actually still alive.  Will's new girlfriend, Sheila Rogers, disappears one night and her disappearance somehow seems to be linked to Ken.  As Will and his friend Squares, a Covenant House driver/counselor and yoga master, investigate, they discover that Sheila was not quite what she appeared to be and she may indeed have had a connection to Will's murdered girlfriend.<br />It takes awhile for all the threads to come together in this complicated book, but it was worth sticking with it.  _Gone For Good_ is a fast-moving story with a variety of unusual and unsavory characters.  Coben does a good job of misdirecting our expectations here and he creates a pretty memorable psycho-killer character in John \\"the Ghost\\" Asselta, who may not be all that psycho after all.  Recommended.
B000000LZV|5.0|Strap this on and get yer brains blown back!! The hottest album of the 80's with absolutely no rivals. I found this as a young teen and thought it looked cool. I had no idea what it was. My first thought was that they were just bad musicians with bad haircuts. For some reason, I stuck with this record, though at the time it was way over my head. I could not stop listening to it nonetheless, and just figured I was a weird-o. Almost 20 years later, my lord does this stand up! This is an absolute must for anyone between the ages of 16-40. Gritty, heavy, and oh-so jazzy. PURE POWER!<br /> As an adult, the first thing that you notice about these cats is that they are smarter than you. They are also much, much braver. Minutemen fearlessly burn through country, folk, funk, punk, jazz, latin, rock, disco and will bust your as* in about 30 seconds flat. I still have no idea how a bunch of YOUNG(!) jitterbugs made this record. This is probably the greatest album ever recorded. 100% raw from tip-to-tail. All burners. One of the those seriously RARE records you can just put on, front to back, with no dry spots.<br /> This D. Boon guy is so sensational words fail me. He wrote songs that shaped my life. His voice, lyrics and playing set a tone for my youth. I used to gaze at the album art all night doing shots of Popov. I couldnt figure out who this guy was. His voice was pretty awful, his guitar-work was sloppy as all get-out, and best of all, he was really fat &amp; sweaty.....how did his sausge fingers play those blazing scales &amp; leads?? Holmes would rock-out till the wheels fell off, and probably got paid about 50 bucks to make this masterpiece. What I am trying to say here is that this was the most righteous dude to ever play music. An unbelievable loss. Thank you, D. Boon. Words are not enough.<br /> As young bucks, my brother, cousin &amp; I used to spin the grooves off this joint. It was the &quot;coin of the realm&quot; and we knew every phrase, chord, and line on it. Nobody we knew had even heard of Minutemen, so we just had to sack-up and form our own little squad. We were so absorbed in this thing, it wasnt even worth trying to turn some other 15 year-old on to it. It just didnt translate. We literally idolized these guys. The outfits alone were so terrific it made your head spin.   <br /> If you found your way to this album review, I IMPLORE you to buy this cd, and before it arrives, go out and buy the vinyl (and a turntable if you have to) as well. Then buy every other album you can find by Minutemen. This CD has been chopped up to make it fit on one disk, and many tracks are faded out early, to my huge disappointment. YOU NEED THIS FOR YOUR CAR, though, dont get me wrong! You absolutely HAVE to have this record on vinyl to experience it properly. The liner notes/artwork really add spice to it. DO NOT SLEEP ON THIS.....nuts&amp;sorbet.
0684800713|5.0|While I must admit, it was difficult to grasp at first, once the prose captured my attention, there was no putting this book down.  One understands Hemingway's gift when reading this book.  It is filled with such beautiful language, and lyrical descriptions that sweep you from the heart of Paris to the mountains of Spain.  <br />Hemingway's first published work describes the ex-pat lifestyle in Paris exceedingly well.  Having lived very near to where Jake, the main character lived, I could identify with his vivid descriptions he paints very well.  His foray into Spain with his fellow ex-pats is also very vivid.<br />Hemingway's descriptions are unmatched.  While some may not particularly like his writing style, if you do, you are in for a treat.  <br />I feared that I would loathe this book as I had onced loathed another Hemingway, The Old Man and the Sea.  However, that was not the case.  The Sun Also Rises is a much more involved story, not quite as steeped in symbolism and weighted by lengthy descriptions.  <br />The Sun Also Rises is a fair balance of prose and description, settings and characters.  If you've read other Hemingway and were not certain whether or not you liked it, try The Sun Also Rises.  If you enjoy Hemingway, don't avoid this because it is his first novel, savor it.<br />5/20/02
B00000JT9E|4.0|This video showcases Slayer's live performance in all its brutality. Recorded on the DIVINE INTERVENTION tour it features amazing renditions of classics such as AT DAWN THEY SLEEP, RAINING BLOOD and HELL AWAITS as well as a cover of Venom's WITCHING HOUR. The documentary footage is interesting, the video opens with some lunatic fan getting SLAYER carved into his arm, and another moron staggering out of a record store signing looking like he's soiled himself, saying \\"Tom called me a fag! I'm going to go home and light a candle! SLAAAAYYYYYERRRR!\\". What a loser. There is also some amusing footage of the band on and off the road which shows that despite their music they are actually happy, good humored guys. No signs of satanic rituals, drug abuse or animal sacrifices- Tipper Gore, you need to get a life.
B00005O5CM|4.0|Dumped by the man that she loves, Elle decides to overrule the statement he's made about her not being serious enough, and make a motion of her own by getting into Harvard and attending law school. It's entertaining and satisfying to see how Elle retains her unique flair for life but finds herself motivated to be more than just another pretty face. In the midst of almost everyone telling her she's not smart enough, not serious enough, not tough enough, Elle determines to prove (almost) all of them wrong. The one who believes in Elle from the first time he meets her is a surprise - you have to watch to find out who he is!  The neat thing about this movie is, many of the people who judge Elle to be a certain way in the beginning, the ones Elle finds herself up against - classmates, professors - end up rooting for her in the end... and Elle is the kind of person who, by not holding a grudge, wins in more ways than one.
B00005YU1O|3.0|This truly bizarre film recounts a dreamer's dream, and so many repeated \\"false awakenings\\" that, eventually, the dreamer panics and begins to believe that he may never awaken (i.e. he may be trapped in his dream state or might be experiencing the after-life). The ending of the film provides a convincing clue as to what is really happening but it takes a LONG time (about 3/4 of the way through) for the film to build any kind of dramatic tension whatsoever. At one point our hero (a zero-personality slacker-type) laments that he is trapped in a dream that \\"seems to go on and on endlessly\\" and, by that point, the viewer will feel exactly same way about the film. I could only take this film in increments of 10 to 15 minutes.<br />Sure, the ideas that pelt the viewer are pretty cool. Sermons about the nature of existence, time, memory, predestination, the after-life, 'lucid' dreaming, libertarianism, and constant name-dropping references to gnostic philosophers from Kierkegard to Sci-Fi icon Phillip K. Dick(!) literally bury the viewer's mind. It's one thing to show a \\"dream movie\\" that, by its plot and characters, demonstrates and hints at such ideas and quite another to present a film that ham-fistedly explains such ideas over and over and over again. Maybe a little mixing of plot, along with maybe half of the monologues, would have made this film a tad more watchable. Instead, what we get is a constant, almost haranguing, certainly tiring, barrage of explanations about philosophies and various musings from the cultural fringe. They might as well have hired the philosophers and \\"culturalists\\" themselves to blather on and on about their ideas. Gee, I guess that's exactly what they did for almost the entire film. My favorite pseudo-intellectual-guy is the monkey who drones on and on about how language is a poor medium to explain cultural phenomena(!?). What about bad film? I suppose these guys were on a limited budget (like every other Linklater film) so there's no point complaining too much.<br />Despite the above misgivings, though, the film is saved by the DVD format. The DVD special features, especially the sub-titled commentary to the main film, truly help the viewer understand some context to the endless monologues and provide some cover for the script-writers. Also, the visual effects are pretty unique and the techniques used here are bound to show up repeatedly in commercials and other film offerings in the future. Unfortunately, the crux of this movie's problem is that it throws too much weird animation and too many different ideas about the meaning of life at the viewer and not enough of what makes a film great: interesting characters and a diverting plot. Neither are present here. Somewhere buried in the animations and ruminations of 'Waking Life' there might be a great movie. The film-maker, however, was just too lazy or on too limited a budget to bring it out.complaining too much.<br />Despite the above misgivings, though, the film is saved by the DVD format.

B00005JKJA|2.0|There are two main tendencies in analyzing the picture. One group of reviewers says there is nothing in Mulholland Drive besides the director's whimsiness, overindulgence and the apparent lack of ideas - the trait that all the artsy/noirish vagueness fails to camouflage. The more enthusiastic viewers willfully abstain from any analysis of the film at all, calling it \\"impossible to comprehend\\", \\"intentionally irrational\\", \\"a dark meditation on the evilness of Hollywood\\" and \\"a surrealist dreamscape\\". And of course there are some people who exit a multiplex cursing or shrugging, regretting the time and money spent, common Joes and Janes with the plans of a nice Saturday night movie thwarted. <br />I'm happy for the \\"incomprehensible masterpiece\\" crowd - they'll get value for money. These are the people who like to think they can transcend their basically mainstream preferences and like to see from time to time \\"something with a twist\\", provided a couple of media gurus certify it's Art. They buy and proudly display Salvador Dali's albums, fascinated by the well-drawn realistic objects and figures in the funny combinations. That's all it takes for them to feel they are the advanced consumers of Art - something kitschy and conventional shredded, mixed, put together at random and lacquered with the gloss de jour. <br />But these who think Mr.Lynch is just having a good time messing with his mind and camera totally disregarding the plebeian preferences are not right, I think. He is acutely aware of his obligations. He must be amused watching the acolytes catalogizing all the droppings of the director's prolific imagination - the Dwarf, the Cowboy, the dark blue cube - attributing the meaning(s) to every nonsensical item Mr.Lynch throws in. <br />But he is not just taking, he's giving what he thinks his quasi-sophisticated clientele likes and needs. As much as they are fascinated with the blonde's and brunette's purpose(less/ful) fumblings the bonus of the soft-porno actionis very welcome, the urge to see the ladies' mammae revealed is the lowest common denominator of every male from ultimately highbrow to the utterly proletarian. The leading characters MUST have an intercourse as the a film progresses - regardless of their sex - and the maestro is happy to oblige with the most gratuitous sex scenes in the recent cinema - with the dark seductress sporting the implanted frontal bounty worthy of any XXX starlet. <br />And the good old uaghaha is also a must to keep the audience entertained and grateful. It's hard to consciously \\"enjoy\\" the film's \\"artsiness\\" for such a long duration - so the comic relief comes in time, we see the slapstick Tarantinoid eccentrics of the hilarious hitman, stinging the fat lady's behind with a bullet, making funny for the fans' benefit, giving the break from the grateful scanning of the \\"surrealist dreamscape\\". <br />These who seek will find. The \\"meaning\\" is here spruced with a nice little bonuses that make 2 ½ hours of experiencing \\"art cinema\\" endurable. Take the subdued pain of watching pretentious nonsense and gain the feeling of being \\"in\\". <br />I'm a bit surprised there is only one David Lynch in the USA - the country where all kinds of do-it-yourself are very popular. Is it so difficult to make a collage of the conventional scenes, putting the end before the beginning, making the characters search fervently not for million dollars or a small blue key but the tiny taxidermist's glass eye that can open the doors to another universe, easily? Then brunette is suddenly seen with the blond Afro hairstyle and has a different name and her former female lover wears a man's suit and talks in basso, the slimy spiked monster springs at the weirdo's face from the diner's paper cup - not from around the corner, Cowboy is replaced by the menacing Fireman in glass shoes or the grossly oversize Boy Scout with red beard and the small pet rhinoceros with poisoned horn. All this circus interacts to the pompous music composed by someone with a pompous Italian name. And everything must be soaked wet in the darkness, to be very noir - i.e moody and \\"meaningful\\", meditative. <br />Then the show opens to the satisfied grunts of these who prefer \\"to experience, not to understand\\", to look in your next offering for a new glimpse of the trademark Mean Fireman, Bearded Boy Scout and the blonde with enormous Afro riding the blue rhino to the mystic interworld portal in the McDonald's toilet.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|This was an absolutely wonderful movie, even if I was completely lost the first time I saw it. (My friends had rented it, and I came 20 minutes into the start of it.) I guess the only thing that would make this movie [bad]is if you don't focus completely on it. Most of the movie (the part in color) works backwards in 5-10 minute scenes, so it is a bit hard to follow if you have a short attention span, but all-in-all it's a great movie with an even better ending.
B0000062S0|5.0|Walking Into Clarksdale is by no means Led Zeppelin but it does contain 12 great tracks. Jimmy Page's guitar work sounda as good as it ever did and Plants voice (slightly different) is still teriffic. The first track &quot;shining in the light&quot; couldnt be a better way to open the cd. It deffinately shows how the rest of the cd will be. Another standout track is &quot;Most High&quot;. it combines melodic keyboards with a catchy guitar riff and good vocals from Plant. If your a Zeppelin fan, the song that most resembles their preveious work is &quot;When The World Was Young&quot;. it starts of slow but builds up into a great song. The album was put together well (reagrdles of what others think)  and over all it is another great album from the greatest duo around

B000063UR2|4.0|This movie is an underrated movie.  May be it's because of the Tangerine Dream score featured in the American version.  With this new restored DVD, the record is about to be set right. Also with this version, the movie is better explained and thus enjoyed.<br />This collection contains 2 versions of the movie Legend.<BR>Disk 1, the \\"director cut\\" edition which contain the original Jerry Goldsmith's score. <BR>And Disk 2, the American released version which featured the Tangerine Dream score.<br />Disk1 contain only the Ridley Scott's comentary as extra.<BR>He goes on to talk about each scene's behind the scene secrets which makes this collection worthwhile for hardcore fans.<br />Disk2's extras, however are things only the very hardcore fans will appreciate.  The 2 deleted scenes included are long and tedious to watch and make us wonder why they were shot in the first place.<br />Overall, I wondered why the score was changed to Tangerine Dream's in the first place.  Not that they are not able to create musical score, I'm their fan myself.  It's just that their electronically synthesized music just did not go well with the movie.

B00004RHZU|3.0|After I purchased her second CD, I had to get this one.  Although I was a bit disapointed, this is not a total waste (especially for a first CD). This CD is basically the standard &quot;I'm a new singer who has got a big producer &quot;Babyface&quot; and I'll let them call the shots so I can get my name out there&quot; feel.  What is more impressive is listening to the quality of Pink's second CD as opposed to this one--it is obvious that on this CD she let others take the reigns--which is to bad.

0345350499|4.0|The novel The Mists of Avalon by Marion Zimmer Bradley has an extremely complicated and confusing plot and/or story line.  There are many ideas and situations in this novel that require your full attention, concentration and focus to understand.  The main character of the story is Morgaine.  She is the daughter if Igraine and the sister of Arthur.  Vivian who is the lady of Avalon or the priestess takes Morgaine and Arthur to Avalon.  There, Merlin takes Arthur and Vivian takes Morgaine to learn sorcery and other things.  This novel is basically about the lives of Morgaine and Arthur and what they each go through.<BR>     I enjoyed this book very much because it gave a story line that reflected upon the era in which it existed.  It was nice to learn the lifestyle of a person living in Avalon during that specific time period.  I also liked this novel because it had twisted characteristics like Morgaine and Arthur sleeping together and Morgass mothering Mordrid, Morgaines child, for his royalty.  It had people betraying each other and much cruelty along with love.<BR>     I think this is an excellent novel to read despite its length.  I recommend this for girls especially because of the fact that it is mostly written in a woman's point of view.  Girls in high school should read this because it has issues in which we can relate to.  I do not recommend this novel to anyone younger than the age of 14.  The Mists of Avalon taught me a lot about the possibilities of life in Avalon.  I enjoyed it very much and recommend it to whoever is looking for a good book to read.

0345409671|3.0|It amazes me that after the explosion in Cosmology during the 20th Century people think myths about an earth centered Universe are interesting. Ms. Rice's view of the Universe, and thus of God, is too small. Does anyone really accept these medival myths? Veronica's Veil, give me a break. God as a tricky old man with extraordinary powers, no body really believes in that God; he's much to small for the Universe we know.Rice realizes the big problem with the Pater Noster is why he allows the widespread suffering of our world. But she chickens out and doesn't deal with the problem.  In reading this book I had an interesting thought: God, being omniscient, would be intimately knowledgeable about human suffering, he would suffer, too. Is he a masochist, or is  Rice's vison of God too small? Humanity is crying out for a meaniful vision of God, but Anne Rice does not give it to them by chewing dried old cuds.<BR>     However, as a fellow writer, I do admire Rice's skills with the language. Her picture of hell ruffled my feathers. She does, though, go too far when she has Lestat eat Dora's menstrual bloods. This was surely in bad taste(no pun intended); is nothing sacred these days?
B00005RY7X|4.0|Andrew W.k's I get wet is great.  It is all about having fun and never stopping.  It gets you up and excited even if you don't want to be.  As W.K says &quot;We will never stop having continuing fun&quot; that is definitely what his music is all about.
0790736233|5.0|This movie was so much more than I expected, from the awesome opening that starts on earth and pulls back until you are far beyond all known galaxies, to the flashbacks of Ellie (Jodie Foster) as a little girl, to the climatic trip to another planet where the &quot;alien&quot; she meets is not at all what you're expecting.<BR>Everything about this film was awesome with one major flaw, the ending.  Although Ellie was gone for a long time, no time passed on earth, so no one believes here. However, there is the fact that her camcorder recorded an hour of static, which is impossilbe if no time elapsed. But James Woods still won't publicly admit that she went to another planet and the movie ends. But the machine is still there, and still very much intact, why don't they just send him so he can see for himself?<BR>This flaw is never explained - never is it said that the machine can only be used once.  Other than that, it is a magnificent film, the best part is when they make the first contact, it is handled in a Very realistic way, not with ships the size of Arizona firing on earth, but with a simple mathatmatical message beamed to earth in tones, which the scientists must then decifer, very thought provoking.  I highly recommend this film.
B000035P7X|5.0|When film-maker D. A. Pennebaker set out to document a rare glimpse of the then-young Dylan both on-stage and off, perhaps he couldn't have known what kind of a historical masterpiece he would produce.  Using unobtrusive instruments--basically a shoulder mounted black and white camera--Pennebaker and his crew were able to follow Dylan into such areas as &quot;The Green Room&quot; backstage at one of his performances and document some of the personal moments of young Bob.  While we are allowed to glimpse, even, a moment of his humanity (when he nearly gets physical with someone who had thrown glass out of the window of the hotel in which the group was staying), Pennebaker captures Dylan on stage with clarity and purity.  Offstage, the viewer is able to enter the Dylan microcosm, listening in to the now infamous interviewing session with the young science correspondent--a most lopsided battle of wits as Dylan cooly strums on his guitar with Bob Neuwirth and Alan Grossman chuckling in the background.  Dont Look Back, indeed, reveals a Dylan bordering almost on nihilism, proclaiming at one point that he certainly wouldn't &quot;put his faith in anything&quot;.  Because he refuses to be labelled, the documentary fittingly trails off with Grossman declaring the newspapers have started calling him a communist.  Certainly Don't Look Back allows for the viewer to feel as if he is a comrade in the Dylan clan, a friend of Baez, Neuwirth, Donovan, even Ginsberg, even Dylan himself.  One feels empathy for the mislabeled Dylan but feels his strength and ability to treat the world, as most geniuses do, as an arbitrary illusion which one musn't take too seriously on some levels, while on others (political/social consciousness) he must maintain the utmost gravity.  Don't Look Back is a masterful work, but particularly has its stand-out moments.  The footage reveals, perhaps, the strained relationship between Dylan and Baez, with Dylan rarely paying any attention to her throughout.She does deliver a powerful and beautiful rendition of one of Bob's versions of &quot;Percy's Song.&quot;  (It is also interesting to note that at one point when Bob Neuwirth comments about Baez's appearance, she accepts the comment with a smile.  Off camera, it has later been revealed, she was in tears.)  Certainly there existed tensions between some of the members of the entourage and one can even get a sense from this film that Grossman and Dylan, while partners in business and two men with a mutual respect for each other, perhaps did not have much of a friendship in the traditional sense of the term.  Again, Don't Look Back is remarkably revealing for its brevity and short-sequence nature, but it is a rare opportunity to get a glimpse of the idiosyncracies of a legend.  No Dylan fan should be without this piece.  Five stars, perfect ten, no doubt.  Perhaps you will be left, at the end, echoing the words of Dylan, &quot;I feel like I've been through something...&quot; You might not be able to delineate it in words--even Dylan couldn't...but you will know..that you have just seen a personal glimpse of the man who did more to change the thought of the later half of the 20th century than perhaps any single individual did...and he did it with six strings and a vision.
B000002MIY|5.0|Aja.  Two Against Nature.  Katy Lied.  The Royal Scam.  The Nightfly.  Kamakiriad belongs in class with these.  In my own view, it rates below Aja and 2vN among the best albums of the bunch, with such a high quotient of strong material (ear candy).  I do have to admit not liking this all that much on a first or second listen.  Too light/airy-sounding, or so it seemed.  Not up to the standards of The Nightfly, as many would say.  But I now agree with former Dan & Doobie singer Michael McDonald that it's Donald Fagen's most solid album (as incredulous I was to read that comment the first time).  The Nightfly is already so solid as it is; to surpass it says something really special.  Yeah, perhaps none of this would play well on the radio, but that's just to say that radio isn't worthy.  Of course, you'll just have to listen and judge for yourself, but if my judgment of Steely Dan's greatness is a positive indication if my judgment of musical quality, then I don't think it's a mistake that this appears so high on my list of favorites.  Not that all the songs here hold that \\"special\\" status for me, but I'll stand by 'Trans-Island Skyway,' 'Tomorrow's Girls,' 'Florida Room,' and 'Teahouse on the Tracks' anytime.
B0000024RQ|5.0|The 1962 release of Bob Dylan's self-titled first album (actually recorded in a few sessions at the Columbia Studios in New York in 1961), left the world with a taste of the young Bob Dylan.  Although Dylan refused to be labelled later in his career (not much later, actually) there is no doubt that he was, on this first album, playing folk tunes and blues-influenced if not straight-blues numbers on his steel strings.  Yet tracks like \\"Talkin' New York\\" and \\"Song to Woody\\" suggested that Dylan was, perhaps, participating in the folk revival (which began, if we must put a date to it, with the Kingston Trio's 1959 recording of Tom Dooley) so that he might pave the way to say something revolutionary with this down-home, wholly American, pure form of music that has always had the ability to touch the soul.  In this second album, Freewheelin', Dylan moved from his early blues-influences, abandoning the steel strings and the fork-fretted guitar riffs for a sound that was--musically--very folk indeed.  But his consciousness to the world outside of his own personal trials (much traditional folk and blues deals with tales of love, betrayal, etc...) echoed of the consciousness of one of his idols, the then recently deceased Guthrie.  \\"Blowin' In the Wind,\\" although originally seen by some of the folk figures of Greenwhich village, including Pete Seeger, as a senseless collection of rhetorical questions, undoubtedly set the mood for the oncoming \\"protest movement.\\"  Again, Dylan loathed labels and never admitted to writing protest songs, but he did know that he was doing something that could change the world.  While songs like \\"Girl From the North Country\\" and \\"Dont Think Twice Its Alright\\" lack this social consciousness, they are still true to their folk roots and are beautiful melodically and sung with a heartfelt passion that only a perfomer like Dylan could have delivered.  \\"Masters of War\\" and \\"Hard Rain\\" demonstrate Dylan's hatred for war and the latter gives the world afirst glimpse at his apocalyptic vision which would wax and wane but last even until the latest release (2001) of his album \\"Love and Theft\\".  Of \\"Masters of War\\" Dylan recalls being startled himself.  \\"I don't usually sing songs about wishing people would die,\\" he would later say, \\"but this just came out of me.\\"  Songs like \\"Bob Dylan's Blues\\" and \\"Bob Dylan's Dream\\" are stand-outs of their own, and \\"Oxford Town\\" is another masterpiece, while perhaps not musically, but lyrically--throwing the issues of racism into the face of the country...most people, then and now you see, prefer to close their eyes to the wars mankind is waging.  Again in \\"Talkin' World War III Blues,\\" Dylan returns to the Talking Blues Pattern popularized by Guthrie before him to deliver his apocalyptic admonition with a peculiar mix of tragedy and comedy.  \\"Corrina, Corrina\\" is a new twist on an old traditional that Dylan performs well.  \\"Honey, Just Allow Me One More Chance\\" is perhaps the one song on this album that echoes of the blues-influenced folk of his first (1962) record.  It is powerfully performed.  Finally, we are left with the multi-dimensionality of Dylan as he trails off with the witty \\"I Shall be Free,\\" a song he would return to in the future in various forms to be found on such albums as \\"Another Side of Bob Dylan,\\" released in 1964.  While we were introduced to Dylan in 1962, this second album unequivically demonstrates the power that the folk-revival possessed.  Beginning with topical \\"protest\\" songs, Dylan was now ready to move on to even greater things.  The metamorphosis seems to be from blues-influenced folk singer to socially aware folk singer, to poet of the people playing something that he could only later call \\"mathematical music,\\" \\"vision music\\" (1965 interview as released by Columbia.)  Indeed, even I feel awkward trying to categorize and compartmentalize Dylan into stages of metamorphosis.  Simply put, Freewheelin' Bob Dylan is a magnum opus from a not yet twenty two year old poet who, rambling out of the Midwest and soaking up all of the musical knowledge he could, began a one-man quest to change what he saw could not be the way things were meant to be.  No Dylan fan should be without this album.  It is simultaneously a moment of history captured and a timeless masterpiece that can be applied even to the tumultuous times of the present.  Bobby Zimmerman, six strings, and a vision...one [heck] of a vision.
B000062Y98|3.0|With this release Blind Guardian have taken the orchestral on choiral elements to a more complex and to some degree pompous level. Everything is more abundant on this release, bigger choruses, faster and louder drumming, better singing, better guitar sound and complicated song structures.  But how does the album sound? It sounds alot like Nightfall, some parts are faster (some songs are incredibely fast, Precious Jerusalem and Punishment Divine) and sound alot like their Somewher F B album. Blind Guardian outdo themselves in the guitar department, you'll hear their fastest and heaviest riffs in a long time. But, does this make an excellent and perfect album? (like their previous 3)...the answer is NO.<br />While I certainly respect the band for reaching such high levels of musicianship and complex songwriting, the songs suffer. The first four songs are excellent compositions. Song 5 is an excellent ballad, but from there on it drags. Songs 6, 7, and 8 are filler. They are as memorable as going to the bathroom. Song 9 is an excellent fast tune, and the last song is the best song they've ever written, the Bonus Track is excellent too . My main criticism is on the actual songs, while they boast large amounts of melodies, epic choruses, they simply don't click. You might get a fast riff here and there, but there are no climatic moments on most of the songs. On previous albums, they relied on a central chorus, but here they have those everwhere, so songs get kind of lost amidst their complexity. Secondly, most of the riffs are rehashed, boring and simply dull, *there are exceptions, and they don't use riffs as much as on other albums (which contributes to the lack of climatic moments..chek Script for My Requiem, Time What is Time, Somewhere Far Beyond, IMaginations From the Other Side and you'll understand what I mean). Another complaint on the guitar dept. is the sameness of the riffs, they repeat themselves throughouth the album, and the band seems to have forgotten that guitars  are the driving force behind the succes or failure of a song. My final complaint is on the lead department...where are the solos? (think Mirror Mirror and Curse of Feanor)...they aren't there, instead there is and overuse of melody lines, they aren't use wisely, they are used excesively, they aren't catchy and they last for the duration of the entire songs!.<br />This is album is a dissapointment, not because it is bad, but because Blind Guardian have set high standards for themselves, and this album does not meet those standards. It took 4 years for this album to come out (and I realize why...it is quite complex), but I think next time, they ought to keep things a little simpler and focus on writting good songs (not complex for the sake of complex). The Queen influence is great, but it seems they're trying to outdo Queen beyond absirdity. If your'e a fan, go buy it (I did), but don't expect a perfect album. It is still a great album, but not their best...maybe I b**ch too much, but anayhow, dont't dismiss my criticism, instead download some songs, check em out, if you don't like what you hear, save your money, if you do like it BUY THIS
B0000668IF|2.0|When Play was released I was blown away, Moby ingenious combination of old folk and gospel tunes layed over ambient/hop rhythems was truly amazing. Now comes 18, which feels as if Moby is trying as hard as he can to relive the glory that Play rivaled in. The alblum starts with \\"We are All Made of Stars\\", which is a descent but unspired song, which mirrors \\"Southside\\" frlom play. After this the next two tracks are more Gospel Ambient, which at this point, after hearing Moby's songs on every movie and commercial, sound boring and uninspired. Now this is not to say that the album is totally with out its gems. \\"At least We Tried\\" seems like a step in the right direction. And  \\"The Great Escape\\" is an interesting, yet short, vocal piece by an excellent female vocalist. But other than these tracks, I felt like I was listening to a serious of commerical on movies tunes written to be licenced by Nike and Touchstone. What made Play great was that it broke new ground for music, while 18 just plays on that broken ground.

0684833395|4.0|Yossarian, the hero of CATCH-22, never wanted to be anyone's hero, but it's easy to see how he became such a popular figure in American literature and culture in the 1960s and 1970s.  He may be the best literary example of the tortures a sane person goes through in a world of crazy and dishonest men.  A WWII bombardier who's tired of people trying to kill him, Yossarian can't get over seeing a kid in his plane die in his arms, in fact he can't get over death at all, or the people who seem perfectly relaxed about flying into its jaws on a regular basis.  No one has the right to say he hasn't done his duty, but they say it anyway, and every time he flies the required number of missions to be sent home, Yossarian's insecure, self-aggrandizing colonel raises the number of missions.  As a result, most of Yossarian's friends end up killed in action and somehow Yossarian ends up not insane despite the best efforts of all his superior officers and doctors to convince him otherwise.<br />You almost have to take an amphetamine to SLOW the effect of Heller's rapid-fire prose.  Yossarian is the only roundly developed character in the book; everyone else is a just developed enough so as not to seem a caricature, but most are distorted extremes (e.g. Milo Minderbender who runs such a highly profitable international black market that he gets praised for bombing his own troops, or the never available \\"Major Major Major Major.\\")  Heller uses these distortions for their humorous, satirical effect, and they work, but never do they obscure the true horror of the experience of the men fighting the war.<br />How I wish I had read CATCH-22 in high school.  So many of the daring, anti-establishment, questioning of \\"excessive authority or obsolete traditions\\" would have stirred me up and made me laugh so much more than they do now, at thirty.  And the sexy parts would have really got me going more as a teenager.  CATCH-22 remains and important anti-war text, and an important lesson for allto beware of those who push empty-headed patriotism and religio-pietistic mind control.  Heller pleads us to think as he shows us the evil that men do when justice is a commodity.  Intelligent teenagers of all ages should read this book.
B00005NI5Y|4.0|How many years into his career?  And he still produces great, meaningful music.
B000002B2T|4.0|Above is a must-have album for fans of Layne Staley, Mike McCready, or of course the era and the music that went along with it.<br />Less manic and more subtle than the archetypal Alice in Chains or Pearl Jam albums, Mad Season and Above are an incredible but at times frustrating listen. While the album as a whole is somewhat uneven, beautiful tracks like Wake Up, River of Deceit and the latin-tinged Long Gone Day showcase that incredible potential for creativity and change that seemed to be everywhere in the early '90s. Sadly, this potential was never realized as most of the important bands have either split or lost members due in large part to the daemons that drove their projects in the first place.<br />Still, at certain moments Above provides a glimpse into a deeper, more sophisticated 'grunge' (a stupid, inaccurate term, but it is useful here) that was never fully realized.
B00005Y228|4.0|Some killer tracks...would be a phenomenal album if the songwriting were consistent.  Some real dreck within, too.
B00005YW4H|3.0|All I could hear was the next Shelby Lynne, the next Diana Krall, and even the next Ms. Holiday herself. Well. What makes all of those singers so great is that there is actually emotion and heart to their slow songs. There are risks. There are key changes. I find none of this here. All I see is a pretty girl trying to play jazz singer. And it's not even really jazz. All of the songs follow each other around. No change. No emotion. She can't even write her own songs - which is probably the reason why she can't seem to connect with the emotion in any of them. There is also no originality. When I picked out this cd I figured all of this true just by reading the song titles and looking at the cover picture. But I had read so much praise for this \\"artist\\" (hah) that I bought it anyway. <br />And not to get me wrong. This cd is pleasant enough. She didn't take any risks to make it unpleasant. It's just boring, and it's been done and said before in the exact same way. Actually it brings to mind Alana Davis's \\"Blame it on Me\\" a few years earlier. The voices are strikingly similar. Pretty girls with interesting first names and ordinary last names. The fact is you can find a Norah Jones struggling in any of your local piano bars. Which makes me wonder why she was chosen. Well the answer is clear, she's pretty. Banal music from pretty people is always going to grant some kind of attention. All of the feeling in this music has been sucked out. Which makes it fine background music. When you want to have a conversation with someone and not concentrate on the music, Norah Jones is perfect for this. Her music is just as ordinary as her last name. Not to knock the last name Jones, I'm just giving a comparison to all those lovely readers out there who might be entertaining the thought of getting this cd.<br />For me personally though, I can throw this cd in a pile with all of the rest of the ordinary musicians out there. Just because someone can play a piano and put forth regular music doesn't make them extremely talented and deep. It makes them girls who were lucky to be born with pretty faces.
6304493681|5.0|This is anime at it's best. The story explores the definition of consciousness and the dilemma posed by artificial intelligence. The plot involves the police force in the near future and focuses on three characters 1) a robotic officer with an implanted ghost (human consciousness) 2) a human officer with cybernetic implants 3) a network program which becomes sentient. It is a complex movie that asks complex questions and presents them in an action filled story. Secondarily the art in this movie is top notch. This is anime as art or art used for story telling. This movie will appeal to anyone that has ever thought about AI and to any anime fan.
6305511055|5.0|I first saw this suspense/spy thriller when it was first released in the theaters sometime in the late 1970s, while living in London and working for the American government. There's nothing that compares with the paranoia associated with seeing a taut spy thriller, only to exit the theater into a cold, foggy late evening in downtown London.  The picture it paints of a murderous renegade network operating within the Central Intelligence Agency is both frightening and plausible, and is delivered by Robert Redford with the terrific direction of Sidney Pollack and his production team in a tight, well-developed tale with a convincing thread of interconnecting events that spins way out of control as the protagonist tries desperately to figure out who is at the center of the plot and why he and his cohorts at a special studies institute sponsored by the Agency are targets.<br /><br />For me, this movie is a nonstop roller-coaster ride, with Redford trying in vain to jump off the damn thing before it crashes below! The level of paranoia as well as the multiple levels of deceit and deception depicted in the film seemed a bit outlandish at the time, but given the temper of the times, it somehow seemed much more plausible in the backwash of Watergate and all that was revealed about the machinations of the so-called \\"invisible government\\" then. The hero's ability to parse together the facts and learn and adapt as he progresses makes the movie work especially well, and one can relate to his growing frustration as he realizes there just may not be any way out alive. And between the margins of the scenes lie some intriguing questions regarding the role of secrecy in an open and supposedly democratic society that add a measure of intellectual acumen and \\"gravitas\\" to the tale.<br /><br />So popular was this movie at the box office that it spawned a number of other spy thrillers in its wake. The film's cast included not only Redford as the hero, but also starred Fay Dunaway, and Cliff Robertson. This movie makes for an absorbing evening of entertainment, and a surefire way to escape the humdrum of everyday life with a stunning tale of murder, mayhem, and betrayal. I highly recommend this flick.

B00003CXBK|5.0|I love anime, but this \\"cartoon\\" goes beyond the scope of most traditional anime. It takes on the issue of humanity vs enviroment and is depicts the time period when mankind begins to first successfully develop firearms. Like many oriental fables it is full of spiritual mysticism in the form of living gods that share our planet. The movie is set in an area inhabited only by a village that strip mines for iron, surrounded by vast forested wilderness. The plot is about the struggle of the villagers to get the land for mining away from nature and the gods that protect it. The animation in this movie is superb and the story is straightforward but thought provoking. It presents questions that have no easy answers in an exciting story that is artfully rendered. Win, win, win. (This movie does contain graphic violence)

She is continually lying to her boyfriend, her roommate, her parents, her employers... it's not funny, it's pathetic.  I don't think that this concept - a young woman who can't pay her bills because she is obsessed with clothing and shopping - so much that she lies to everyone - is enough to fuel one book, let alone two.  What am I missing here?
B00003CXAA|5.0|Francis Ford Coppla shows how great movies are made. The first 2 Godfather movies are one of my favorite movies of all time! Its pretty amazing at how good the Godfather was when it came out in 1972. Al Pacino, James Cann and Robert Deniro and many others show their acting ability in these movies. These movies have done a lot for many people and have made them very well known. This movie is also special to my heart because its Al Pacino first big movie and does such a great job. Even though the 3rd Godfather wasn't as good as the other movies, It was still good. Overall, this is a great trilogy and shows great acting throughtout the movies!
0060506989|3.0|Critics of 'We Were Soldiers....' have lauded it as the definitive statement on how life really was on the battlefields of Vietnam.  And certainly the detailed research collected and presented in this book is extremely impressive; full kudos to Messrs. Moore and Galloway.  But does 'We Were Soldiers...' make for good reading entertainment?  For this reviewer, no.<br />Firstly, the book is simply a (non-fiction) account of a 1965 battle at the Ia Drang area in Vietnam.  Harold Moore was one of the leading commanders at that battle, Joseph Galloway was a reporter watching all the fighting.  Clearly it was a horrific, gastly battle (..actually, several battles over a few days).  Hundreds of American soldiers and thousands of Vietnamese soldiers perished, many more suffering from terrible physical/emotional injuries.  Moore/Galloway do fine justice in capturing the horror.<br />Unfortunately the authors spend a tremendous amount of time giving mention, sometimes briefly, on all the hundreds of American participants during the battle.  With so many characters and the minute details of their actions I couldn't help but feel overwhelmed.  No doubt Moore/Galloway wanted to make sure every participant in this nightmare got their full credit, which is certainly commendable.  But as for a reading experience ... I found it pure drudgery after only a hundred pages.  Less would have been more.<br />In addition the book make me feel uncomfortable about Harold Moore and others fighting at Ia Drang, in an unexpected way.  While Harold Moore goes into some length criticising the Johnson administration about its Vietnam policies, he then talks about his visit to Vietnam (many years after Ia Drang) to speak with Vietnamese generals who fought on \\"the other side\\".  I felt his comments did not do justice to these guys who lost a great many more soldiers than the Americans.  And a couple of the quotes which call Vietnamese as \\"gooks\\" brought back a most unpleasent sense of deja vu.<br />Bottom line: stellar research wrapped into a difficult, and disturbing read.  Mandatory for military history bluffs, a definite miss for all others.
0385503954|5.0|This is one of the most engaging stories I've encountered in some time -- and beautifully told.  It's a little slow going at first, but well worth the effort.  Once it gets going, it's compelling reading that's almost impossible to put down.  The ending was very controversial among my friends, but I found it a brilliant, perfect way to end the story.  It's a terrific read.
B00003CXBK|1.0|I waited enthusiastically to view this &quot;opus&quot;.  The animation was phenomenal.  The audio was a bit lacking, but the story blew me away.  It was that good?  No.  It was far worse than I could have ever envisioned.  The last 1/3 of the movie and the ending in particular left me searching for words.  I was dumbfounded that this tripe could receive a good review, much less the almost universal praise that it had been given just after its release.  In a word, shocking.  I have intentionally left out specifics as to not ruin it for those who have not seen the movie.  Believe me though...it's that bad.  Borrow it from a clueless friend and judge for yourself, if for no other reason than to see what astonishingly bad cinema looks like.
B00005JKED|1.0|Training Day had been recommended to me by several people I respect, so I rented it last night. I wish I could agree that it was good, but... whoa. QUITE the contrary. It stunk like Schwartzenegger and Stallone in a B.O. contest. <br />The first hour or so wasn't bad: the criminals and cops portrayed were admirably ruthless, and the rendering of the streets was almost totally convincing. It did get a little old how Denzel kept pulling the car over to lay something heavy on Ethan Hawke, and it was a little strange that Hawke knew nothing of police corruption after serving on the force for 19 months (I know more about it just from reading the paper). But these are small quibbles, and the movie seemed alright on the whole.<br />Then it took an abrupt turn into Stupidland. Suddenly the ruthless criminals started acting like pussycats. Suddenly Hawke exhibited the healing powers of Wolverine after being beaten within an inch of his life. Suddenly the villain began passing up easy opportunities to shoot the hero (e.g., when he climbed onto the roof), even though he wanted him dead. And, most telling of all, suddenly the hero got one of those hunches that's always right, one of those Hollywood hunches that heroes in lousy movies always get, for no reason except the screenwriters' laziness: I mean Hawke's certainty that he'd find Denzel (who for all he knows is on his way to pay off some Russian gangsters) at his girlfriend's house in the Hood. And of course, the Boyz N the Hood all suddenly love Hawke, and willingly \\"get his back,\\" even though an hour or so ago their malice toward his badge and white skin was only held in check by the sheltering presence of Denzel.<br />This is one of the hallmarks of mediocrity in movies: when events defy belief on the movie's own terms. When a trio of thugs who are career criminals and rabid cop-haters transform into the world's most impartial jury before your eyes (\\"Very well, I will call my cousin on the cellphone before killing you!\\"), and when a streetwise cop tries to escape his death sentence by DRIVING TO THE AIRPORT (as if anyone who's ever seen a cop show or mafia drama on TV couldn't tell him, \\"Don't go near the airport when there's a price on your head, fool!\\"), you know you're looking at second-rate, farm league, TV-grade stuff. I don't demand realism as a rule; I like James Bond and over-the-top action movies; but a movie that's supposed to be gritty has got to commit to realism.<br />Other reviewers have theorized that this movie's script was started by a good writer and finished by a bad one. That strikes me as very probable.
6305176299|5.0|What a gripping ride this movie was. A movie that made me want to watch more. I was very impressed with Jan De Bont's directorial debut and he deserves more. He needs to stop making 'sell out' movies like \\"Twister\\", \\"The Haunting\\" and the horrible sequel to this excellent movie.
630157401X|5.0|This movie is highly enjoyable, a good-old light vs darkness battle reminiscent of Arthur vs Mordred.  Indy takes on the Nazis in the quest for the Holy Grail.<br />The first Indiana Jones movie came out when I was 12 and it inspired me to learn ancient history and exotic cultures, which I did.  <br />Sean Connery is introduced as Indy's dad and plays the part well.  In the movie we also learn where Indy first got his, his fear of snakes, his trademark hat and his love of ancient and Medieval history.  River Phoenix was a tragic loss, he played the young Indiana Jones.<br />Indiana is the noble hero we'd all like to be.  I hope the rumor I heard was true, that they are going to come out with another Indiana Jones movie.  The trilogy truly wasn't enough for such an astounding hero.<br />If you haven't seen this movie, run out right now and get it on VHS or DVD, whichever you prefer and sit back and enjoy a truly epic expierience.
B000002UAU|5.0|&quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; is such a familiar part of our culture that many people seem to have forgotten how good it actually is. The songs themselves are often playful and whimsical, featuring lyrics full of jokes, puns, and imaginative imagery - far removed from the ordinary love songs of previous pop. Musically, these songs are deceptively simple. Through beautiful economy they create melodies the like of which you will never forget, and all are performed with skill and enthusiasm. Above all, this album stands as a masterpiece of the recording genre. Just as film is different from the theater, so the Beatles realized that sound recording is different from sound performance, and they explored the new &quot;cinematography&quot; of sound as never before. Think how many rock albums you have heard that only use about five sounds in the whole thing. There is so much richness and variety in the sounds we hear on this album that it could boggle the mind if it didn't all work together so seamlessly. These sounds range from the down-to-earth sonority of the heavy bass and drums (which hold up very well today, and stand in marked contrast to the relatively mushy sound of many sixties records)to the bouncy clarinet sounds of &quot;When I'm Sixty Four&quot; to the lush mix of eastern and western strings in &quot;Within You Without You.&quot; Then there are the creative technical tricks to create even greater variety in sound - the microphones in the bells of the horns to distort them on &quot;Good Morning Good Morning,&quot; the masking tape on the tape head to wobble the sound of the piano solo on &quot;Lovely Rita,&quot; and so on. This would all be fun enough, but it is all used to serve the songs so well that it moves into the realm of the masterful. Take a track like &quot;Getting Better&quot; and listen carefully to the ways in which the subtle varieties of sounds keep the listener interested. We begin with the extremely bright sound of an electric guitar coupled with piano strings being struck by hand with hammers (how often do we hear such sounds on the radio these days?), which instantly grab the attention. We then move into a verse with a slightly fractured beat, as lead and backing vocalists trade lines. During the chorus an electric piano comes in to further enrich the sound, as do some conga drums. Then in the final verse there is actually an Indian tamboura in the background, which adds to the tension and drama considerably. Marvellous. Well, I could go on all day. Listen carefully to the many sounds on this fine album and you will be amply rewarded for your troubles. I've been listening with headphones for 14 years and I am still enjoying it.
079284632X|3.0|the way wes craven made this movie maybe think... was this a unique or disturbing movie? the ideas and script of this movie is something ive never seen before. its unique because the concept of this movie is original but its disturbing the way the movie goes. two girls are on their way to a concert when they run into a escape convict and his dad and grandfather and the girlfriend. they get kidnapped and get taken into the woods where the humiliate, torture, rape and kill the two girls. the murderers end up staying in one of the girls parents house where the parents find out they murdered their daughter by a necklace they see on one of the guys. they take matter into their own hands when they find the body of their dead daughter. they kill the murderers an a most brutal murder. i would recomend this movie to anyone who likes unusual and disturbing killing movies but not to anyone with a weak stomach.
B00005JKL8|4.0|This film gets very high marks for technical excellence for a war story with good action footage, but the story is so contrived and unbelievable that the film plays more like a fantasy adventure than a realistic war film.  We are asked to swallow so many events that just wouldn't happen that the film loses a good deal of credibility.<br />Who could possibly believe that the U.S. would sit still while N.A.T.O. dictated that we must not attempt the rescue of a downed pilot becaue it might upset the peace process in Bosnia?  That is utter nonsense.  And are we to believe that an entire platoon of soldiers with automatic weapons all firing simultaneously could not hit the constantly dodging Burnett?  Not likely.  There are numerous other plot contrivances that require extraordinary suspension of disbelief, but most of them are critical plot elements so I will refrain from possible spoilers.<br />John Moore is a rookie director that does a terrific job with the technical elements of the film.  He presents a very realistic look and feel in the carrier scenes and the air combat scene is first rate.  Actually, all the action sequences are outstanding, no doubt in large part due to the work of twenty year stunt veteran Steve Davison (\\"End of Days\\", \\"Batman and Robin\\"), who was the second unit director and stunt coordinator.  This film also blends stunt photography seamlessly with visual effects to produce extremely realistic action scenes.  However, when it comes to managing the screenplay, Moore seems to just assume that the writers are the best judge of how the plot is presented, or he doesn't connect with the concepts plot and character believability.  <br />This is Owen Wilson's first film in the lead and while he does a good job, he just isn't serious action-hero material.  Wilson projects a naturally sarcastic, smart aleck personality that works in some of the scenes in this film, but when it gets to the macho action sequences, he just can't carry it.  He was terrificin Shanghai Noon, where the action was all tongue-in-cheek.  In that film, his wisecracking humor was a perfect fit.  However, this film gives him little opportunity to display his fabulous comedic talents and he is adrift trying to play the survivor.<br />Gene Hackman plays a supporting role and as always gives us a solid performance as Admiral Reigart.  I can't keep track of how many military movies (mostly naval) David Keith has been in since \\"An Officer and A Gentleman\\".  He must be on only one call list.  He always gives a credible performance in these roles and this one is no different.  Joaquim de Almeida is dreadful as Admiral Piquet of N.A.T.O. command.<br />If you like action films and you are not too fussy about implausible stories, this film delivers.  I rated it a 7/10 based on the marvelous stunt work and visual effects and the realistic military look and feel.
B00005UQ9F|4.0|Many months I read about Sessions 9 on the many movie sites I view.  Each had great things to say about it but it was released at selected theaters.  The first Tuesday I went out and purchased the DVD and was glad.  The plot takes a slow climb bringing the audience with it.  Characters are reveiled along with number of unanswerd questions.  At the end you will be left sitting in the dark reflecting on what just happened.  I was dissappointed to find the dvd was in 2.0 and not 5.1. Still the track is crisp.  Seperation of channels is always a plus for scarey movies.
B00005JRX0|5.0|I THOUGHT THIS IS AN EXCELLENT ALBUM, ESPECIALLY HAVING LIVE TRACKS FROM THEIR LASTEST TOUR. STIFF UPPER LIP TOUR 2001.
B00005JKJA|5.0|At first I hadn't formed an expectation about the film.  I had read many reviews loving the movie.  The reviews were completely correct.  I was unable to stop watching.  Every aspect twisted around another aspect.  Few directors can pull off a movie like MulHolland Dr.  Lynch was at his best.  Most directors boring you with horrible dialoge and endless action.  Don't read a bad review. These people lack the movie knowledge to rate such a complex work of art. The movie is confusing but remind yourself that its entertainment and you will be entertained.
B000002H33|4.0|I personally agree with everone else about how great this album is, except for one thing- it does not run over The Black Album.  Dont get me wrong- I listen to Master of Puppets usually every day- but also The Black Album.  I feel that their self titled album has more organized riffs than Puppets-thats why I gave it five stars.
B0000640VO|5.0|Well, I would like to say that I am a frequent foreign film watcher, but that would be a lie.  In fact, I am often heard to say \\"I just don't feel like \\"reading\\" a movie\\"...no matter HOW good it is supposed to be.  Once I saw the theatrical trailer for this one though, I was hooked.  Amelie sucks you in.  It is hilarious, charming and just a wonderful feel-good movie.  Amelie tries to fix everyone else's life which is fun to watch....  including sending her reclusive father's garden gnome on a world tour complete with pictures sent back home.  It is hard to pin point one reason why this is such a good movie.  If you are like me, and don't normally watch foreign films, do yourself a favor and watch this one.  You will not be disappointed.
B000002JS8|5.0|This is AC/DC at their best.  I listen to this cd nearly every day.  This is one of those cds that you listen to a hundred times and never get tired of.  I've owned it for nearly two years and it is still one of my favorites.  My favorite tracks on it are \\"shot down in flames\\" and \\"night prowler.\\"  Other awesome songs are the title track, \\"walk all over you\\", \\"touch too much\\", and \\"if you want blood.\\"
B00005QZWJ|5.0|i listened to the samples and saw the movie, so i HAD to have heard the soundtrack!!! I love it all!!! everything lotr, i am gonna get it as soon as i am finished with homework and have time to go to a store!!!
B00000JG4N|4.0|This is without a doubt Motley Crue best release to date, with Theatre Of Pain coming in 2nd.  Tommy's drumming is his best so far, and so are Vince's vocals- I strongly recommend it for any fan of eighties rock.
0061020710|5.0|\\"The Color of Magic\\" is Terry Pratchett's introduction to the now near-famous-yet-delightfully-bizarre planet of Discworld. While the series is now more than 20, but this is where it all starts--with the tourist Twoflower and his bumbling wizard guide, Rincewind.<br />Discworld is unlike any other place a reader may have visited, even in the wild n' wooly world of science fiction and fantasy.  For starters, the entire planet of Discworld is shaped like a LP record (or, for modern readers, a CD or dinner plate):  it's flat and round, encircled by the Circle Sea, which flows forever off the edge of the planet.  Oh, yes, lest we forget, the whole planet is also carried on the back of four enormous elephants which, in turn are balanced on the back of The Great A'Tuan, the World Turtle who swims slowly through the cosmos on errands of it's own.  As an interesting aside, the concept of our Earth being balanced on the back of elephants or turtles is as old as civilization-many creation myths from India had the earth being carried about by these animals.<br />Such an improbable place would, of course by it's very nature, contain a large concentration of magic, wizards, mages, witches, sorcerers and other magical sort of folks.  Our incompetent hero and main character, Rincewind, is himself a wizard, though an exceptionally bad one.  While at wizard school (called Unseen University), he snuck a peek at the Great Book of Spells on a dare, and one of the Great Spells leapt out of the book and into his head.  All other lesser spells, from opening walnuts to changing the weather or your shape, are too scared to stay in the same head as one of the Great Spells, so Rincewind, while technically a wizard, is doomed to wander around doing card tricks for a living.<br />Fortunately, however, Rincewind does have a talent for picking up foreign languages, which allows him to translate for an EXTREMELY RICH tourist who comes to town.  Twoflower the tourist is unique in that A) he has four eyes B) he's the first tourist the town has ever had and C) he's got a strange sort of treasure chest that follows him around on little tiny legs and seems to be able to give him anything-a change of underwear, a flask of water, or more bars of solid gold than the entire town has seen in it's whole history.<br />The fun begins when Rincewind, who is street savvy despite being an inacompetent wizard, tries to first steal Twoflower's treasure and then protect the innocent and naïve Twoflower from the danagers of the city (Twoflower, unaware of how much anything costs, offers up a whole bar of gold for a single glass of water, for example).  Their adventures take them all over the Disc, from the high mountains at the Hub of the world to the edge of the Circle Sea, all the while as the Great Spell tries to get itself spoken by Rincewind, usually when he's just about ready to die some unusual and terrible death (oh, by the way, since only Death himself may take the soul of a wizard, the hooded figure of Death appears quite a lot in this story, usually when Rincewind is about to die some unusual and terrible death).<br />Pratchett loves to poke fun at the whole genre of science fiction and fantasy as well as himself and his own characters.  More than one ridiculous situation will seem oh-so-familiar to those who are much taken with the genre.  The book is worth reading just for the absurd situations that Rincewind and Twoflower find themselves in, as well as the cast of lesser characters who make up the patently motley crew of Discworld.<br />While not specifically a young adult novel, teen readers will no doubt enjoy the fast pace of the novel as well as the ridiculous situations almost every character finds itself in (as well as the ridiculous characters themselves, like Cohen the Barbarian).  Those readers who have read a lot of fantasy/science fiction will enjoy the way that Pratchett pokes fun at the genre itself and the impossible twists in the plot (indeed, in the second book of the series, Rincewind himself falls off the edge of the planet but, no surprise, manages to get back on his feet...)<br />Highly recommended!!  Those who really love this book may want to go onto the second book in the series, \\"The Light Fantastic\\" where the futher adventures of Twoflower and Rincewind are documented.the second book of the series, Rincewind himself falls off the edge of the planet but, no surprise, manages to get back on his feet...)<br />Highly recommended!!

B000002IJA|3.0|Everyone seems to be going on about how great of an album Who Made Who is.  Dont get me wrong- AC/DC is one of my all time favorite bands, but this album is one of, if not, their absolute worst.  &quot;Who Made Who&quot; has sort of that &quot;eighties&quot; feel to it, and any real AC/DC fan would already have all the tracks on it that were previously released.  I strongly recommend Back in Black or Highway to Hell.
B00005BJPO|5.0|This landmark anime movie was awe-inspiring upon its release and is still fantastic a decade later.<br />I cannot recommend this film highly enough.  View this materpiece with an open mind.  Akira tends to draw fanatics too bloodthirsty to appreciate its message while scaring away critics intelligent enough to understand it.<br />A+, If I were to give this film a rating, based on four stars, I would give it twenty-seven.
B0000028M7|4.0|This is one of my favorite cds from one of my favorite bands.  Layne Staley has to be one of the greatest vocalists of all time (and i'm not just saying that because he died recently).  My favorites are &quot;them bones&quot;, &quot;rooster&quot;, and &quot;would&quot;.
B00005LB9O|2.0|....after all such a faceless and dull bit of \\"alternative\\" is completely invisible, to me. This album is commonplace just like anything else that comes from the likes of Coldplay, Stereophonics, and the rest. I honestly believe this stuff belongs more to the \\"adult/contemporary\\" genre than to Radiohead. Buy this album if you liked U2's latest or something lame like that. But if you liked OK Computer, you aren't guaranteed to like \\"The Invisible Band\\". I know I didn't.
B000002JSZ|5.0|This is one of AC/DC's absolute best.  The only reason it didn't sell millions is because it was released in the eighties- when hair and makeup bands topped the charts(a very bad era of rock music.)  My favorites are &quot;rising power&quot;, the title track, &quot;nervous shakedown&quot;, &quot;deep in the hole&quot;, and &quot;badlands&quot;.
0785813500|5.0|Before there was H.P. Lovecraft or Stephen King, there was Edgar Allen Poe. Despite his melodramatic literary tendencies, he is definitely one of the most important literary figures of his century and easily the greatest American writer of that century, more important even than Mark Twain. A truly fascinating writer, but his life was perhaps even more fascinating- one of those sick, tormented 19th century characters like Dante Gabriel Rossetti or Baron Corvo. However I should say that this writing is not for everyone and you have to have certain gothic tastes and a tolerance for the occasional absurdity if you want to read it. Aside from the horror tales, this collection also has his burlesques, and it helps to know French and Latin if you want to tread through those comfortably.
0345350499|5.0|The novel Mists of Avalon by Marion Zimmer Bradley has a quite confusing plot. Is seems to skip around a lot, but in the end it makes sense. It covers the story of King Arthur, but from a very different perspective than most people have heard. The story is told in the eyes of the women in the story. The main character, Morgaine, is the sister of Arthur and the story is told mainly from her point of view. It is also told in the eyes of his mother Igraine. This book is mostly in Avalon, the old country. It is in the time when there are many Saxon invasions and Christianity is becoming more popular. Morgaine is a priestess on the island of the goddess (Avalon). Avalon's religion is based upon the goddess and is female dominated. The story shows how Avalon is dying because of the Christians. Many people don't believe the old religion is good and throw other people out for worshipping the goddess. This gives an example of how religion, even at the time of King Arthur, causes a problem in peoples' lives. For many years people have fought over different religions. It just shows how one thing can become more popular and shut other things out completely. The story basically tells you everything you are missing in the stories about King Arthur.<BR> This story is something that I think every woman should read at some point in her lifetime. It gives a very real perspective on everyday situations that women still go through. It is almost like a fairy tale for grownups. Marion Zimmer Bradley's writing style utilizes such beautiful language that it is very calming to read. I enjoyed this novel very much. It really just makes you believe the stories about King Arthur you have been told all your life. It also helps you understand how women were treated in  those days. In many ways these conditions haven't really changed all that much. <BR> In this book some very twisted things that happen. It starts out when  Morgaine and Arthur are still with their mother. Viviane takes them away.Viviane is their aunt; she keeps Morgaine and Merlin gets Arthur. Their mother Igraine cheats on Morgaine's  father with Uther. They have Arthur together. After the children are taken away from their mother the story is told in the eyes of Morgaine. Some years later Morgaine and Arthur are in a ritual, each not knowing about the other, and end up losing their virginity to each other. Wow, what a twist. The story goes on with the loved ones of each. Morgaine has a child Mordred, which her aunt Morgause takes from her. In the end Mordred ends up killing Viviane because she killed Morgause. <BR> The book Mists of Avalon is a good portrayal of the stories and legends of King Arthur. It is given from the point of view of the women in the story. I think every women should read this book at some point in their life. Different parts can relate to different times in a woman's life, because there are characters that are old and characters that are young. Each person has traits in their personality that we as women can  identify with. I definitely think that men should read this book also; in fact it might make them understand women better. It just seems to appeal to women a lot more. It effectively presents the point of view  the women of the story have and their significance in the story. Religion is also a major topic in the story, and it shows how much different religions influence people`s actions. The book is written in such a way that you can relate it to so many real life situations. It makes the legends of King Arthur come alive.
B000001ELF|5.0|THIS IS I THINK MAYBE THE BEST OF THE SOLO ALBUMS. TEAMED WITH PRODUCER EDDIE KRAMER THEY PRODUCECD MAYBE ONE OF THE BEST SOUNDING ALBUMS.

B00005QHPQ|3.0|The only good track is the title track &quot;Escape&quot; and this track is simply a gem. But the entire rest of the CD seems to contain nothing but filler songs. A huge disappointment. I thought it would have more songs like &quot;Escape&quot; in it but it turns out that none of the other songs are even remotely like it. While commuting I just listen to Escape a few times and then switch to some other CD.
B0000668IF|5.0|The quality of depth of Moby musical influences are without exception, the driver for this album. If you listen to songs from the American civil rights movement (I'M NOT WORRIED AT ALL)   and the musical heritage that has drawn on that, such as soul (IN THIS WORLD) & dominated some of the biggest acts since the 60's, you will appreciate MOBY's intense musical style. <br />There are twinges of 80's electrica pop, from the likes of the Pet Shops Boys, The Cure, etc, (SIGNS OF LOVE) which help to add contuinity to the collection. <br />Mix these two strands with the modern dance breakbeats and synthesized melodies (FIREWORKS) that are used in \\"chill-out\\" zones and you have 18!!<br />Each of the tracks draws you in and having often listened to this in the car, I was spell-bound!! :-) When the collection stops you find yourself wondering where the music has gone! My critique would be that this could easily (& should have been) a double CD. I am VERY confident that MOBY has the material and range to do this, not least from the samples and loops that were rejected for inclusion.. so look for the \\"18: The B-Sides\\" because, I am sure they exist.<br />His voice is radically different to what I (& I imagine I am not alone) would invisage. It lacks depth & range of any note, but it comes across as heartfelt and driven, which is the best you can expect.<br />If you listen to the lyrics (EXTEME WAYS) there are twinges of the modern anguishes he feels and they offer a good reflection at times of the challenges we all face.<br />There are so many highlight, but just 1 for me was the springsteen-esque (LOOK BACK IN) which builds and develops some of the sounds used on Philadelphia.<br />One other is the beautiful blend of vocals & violins on THE GREAT ESCAPE. Truly superb! <br />I hope you get as many hours of joy out of MOBYS latest outings as I did. :-)
B00005JKCF|5.0|I just got back from seeing Spider-Man at the theatre.  As the title reads, I walking into the theatre interested in this movie; I never really was a Spiderman fan.  At the end, I walked a fan.<br />I found the movie to be well put-together.  Awesome scenes with high-flying action.  The first scenes where Peter Parker is playing with his new-found abilities were great.  One reviewer here said that Willem Dafoe was over-the-top.  I disagree; I think that his acting was spot-on.  His protrayal of the stereotypical bad guy was just right for the Green Goblin, the mad-genius nemesis for the movie.<br />I am looking forward to this movie's sequel. I hope that they don't change a thing, because they hit the bullseye with this one!  It's said that you shouldn't believe the hype until you see for yourself.  Spider-Man is an excellant expection; go see this movie now, without delay!!
B00003CX8J|4.0|Im a big time fan of the x-men comic so i really enjoy the movie a lot , you just cant be disapointed at all, the DVD have only one problem the wide screen restriction ,  we should have the option of the full screen also , its just so anoying dont everyone have a widescreen tv at home..
B00005A1PR|5.0|by which i mean to say, this album is mindblowing, and you should get it now! the entire album is a such a refreshing change from the same-ol' stale r+b music out there. it's fresh -- it rings with her beautiful guitar playing instead of being laden with samples from countless other songs; it's beautiful -- her voice is one of the most gifted out there today -- rich, deep, and smooth, with such a range (unlike alicia keys' voice, which sounds tinny and shallow in comparison); her lyrics are inspiring, uplifting, joy-inducing; and the grooves, which make me bounce around in my seat when i'm listening to this album at work, are just SO GOOD! (esp. on brown skin. that is my fave, groove-wise). so GET THIS ALBUM! and forget about alicia keys. what an overhyped disappointment she was. i only wish that india.arie played piano; i'm still hoping for an r+b woman piano player to come along and knock my socks off, like fiona apple but a little more soul-tinged.
0141301074|5.0|The Twits is so hilarious. I've always been a fan Roald Dahl's, but I had never experienced this comic gem. The giggling begins on the first page, and it reaches a huge climax a quick 76 pages later. You will probably be doubled over laughing by then. Everything about the book is funny as you watch Mr. and Mrs. Twit pull prank after totally original prank on each other (the pranks include frogs, glass eyes, and balloons among other things). Then, you find out that the mean, awful Twits have been trying to raise an upside down monkey circus, and the monkeys want to get their freedom and to get back at the Twits. Their ingenious plot to get back at the Twits provides the biggest laughs of the book. Even the small descriptions are funny. My favorite line in the book comes when Dahl is describing the yard. He writes of the tree: \\"To one side (of the house) there is The Big Dead Tree. It never has any leaves on it because it's dead.\\" I'm not totally sure why, but that line almost had me crying. This is one of the most fun reads I've ever had, and the illustrations are great, too. Anytime you're feeling bad, I would certainly suggest this delightful (even if a little mean) read.
B00005BL2A|2.0|Six years ago I angrily gave this record two stars, but my opinion has softened a bit as time has worn on and I've given it many more spins. There's still plenty to complain about: there simply isn't much to this album, in either inspiration or execution. This was apparent in the run-up to its recording, in which it took chief songwriter Martin Gore four years, pressure from the record label, and the assistance of Paul Freegard and Gareth Jones to write it.<br />Out of twelve tracks, only ten actually qualify as songs. \\"Lovetheme\\" and \\"Easy Tiger\\" are boring and barely-there instrumentals. In fact, 'boring' is a sadly appropriate adjective for most of the work here; \\"Exciter\\" has to be one of music history's most ironic album titles. \\"Dream On,\\" \\"The Dead of Night,\\" and \\"I Feel Loved\\" raise the pulse slightly, but are no match for the overwhelming dullness of the rest. Ultimately, whether or not the songs are quiet, lack of substance is a problem in all areas. \\"When the Body Speaks\\" and \\"Goodnight Lovers\\" sound like they were half-finished. The former has a pleasant little guitar line; the latter has a beautiful multi-tracked vocal harmony, and that's it. \\"I Feel Loved\\" is up-tempo, but a pretty basic dance floor song. \\"Sweetest Condition\\" tries to make up for being thin by being loud. It doesn't work. Gore has at times been a passably good lyricist, but the written words are awful here. His two vocal performances, \\"Comatose\\" and \\"Breathe,\\" in combination with the transcending cornball of \\"Shine\\" have some of the cheesiest, laziest lines he's ever written. \\"The Dead of Night\\" has an interesting dark feel to it, and proves to be a precursor to the sound on their next album, but it adds to the unfocused and half-hearted nature of this album.  \\"When the Body Speaks\\" peters out in lullaby, followed by the pointless \\"Lovetheme\\" synthesizers, followed by the blaring and obnoxious \\"Dead of Night.\\" There is no logical progression or artistic vision to the way this was composed, recorded, and tracked.<br />So what's good? \\"Dream On\\" should have been the tone-setter that all great openers are, but instead it's just an excellent exception. An exhilarating mix of raw tones and dreamy electronic haze, it's a unique home run hitter. As a standalone, the quiet \\"Freelove\\" is quite good. Producer Mark Bell flexes his muscles in creating a disorienting but blissful drift to its sound, and Dave Gahan vocally shows he can soothe and comfort just as well he he could shake the blood on earlier albums. Mark Bell's great production talents are generally wasted: he saves tracks like \\"Shine\\" from being absolutely awful, but doesn't have enough to work with on the whole.\\"I Am You\\" is another good example of solid songwriting blended with the perfect production.<br />All in all it balances out to 'blah.' It's technically better than this rating, but if it didn't have the Depeche Mode name on it, it wouldn't have attracted any attention at all, and we know the Depeche Mode name signifies that we should expect more., recorded, and tracked.

B00005JKCF|3.0|This movie was awesome! The story followed the comic books very closely. I thought it was well made and had only two small problems with it. First off- Some of the computer generated effects (i.e., Peter jumping from building to building), were very cheesy. It looked pretty fake, and I wasn't impressed by a lot of the computer generated effects. Second- I know they're making two more SpiderMan movies, but c'mon, the ending was terrible! I won't give away any details, but lets say the ending wasn't what I expected. Don't be discouraged by this... the movie, the story was great and this film is surely worth it. Oh, the Green Goblin looked a bit funky, but that's what made him the bad guy, I guess.
6305807086|2.0|I had intrest in this film in the first place because  of it's director Spike Jonze,oddball '90s alt-rock video auteur had directed it<BR>(among his work are Beastie Boys' \\"Sabotage\\",Bjork's \\"It's Oh So Quiet\\",Weezer's \\"Buddy Holly\\",etc.).<BR>Since his videos are very offbeat yet fun and stylish I thought that he would bring that same appeal to the big screen.<br />Sadly no.\\"Being Jon Malkovich\\" is just odd and depressing and at times very dull and stagnant.Nothing more really.Don't believe me?<BR>Then i'll try to summeriaze the plot ,an out-of-work puppeteer(John Cusack)<BR>gets a part-time job as a file clerk.There he leads into a portal<BR>into the mind of actor John Malkovich.He,his witty co-worker<BR>(Catherine Keener) and eccentric,pet-loving wife(a ghastly-wigged<BR>Cameron Diaz) devise a scheme to let anyone go through the mind of Malkovich just for $200 a pop.Strange,huh? That's not all,<BR>the kicker is that you only get to become Malkoich for a matter of minutes until you're dumped off the New Jersey Turnpike.<BR>As I said,this film is VERY strange(oh,yeah,I forgot most of this happens on the 7 and 1/2 floor of the office;don't ask me!).<br />\\"Being\\" comes off as a mix of bizarre \\"Saturday Night Live\\" skit,<BR>benign sci-fi flick,and weird exploration of celebrity obession and self-worth(again,don't ask me!).<br />The movie isn't neccesacarily bad nor is it \\"outstanding\\",it's just well,too odd to really judge.But to point out the postive points,I can say that Jonze's wry,(VERY) offbeat humor and the film's sparse direction is creative and at times,strangely enticing.(Yet this movie is way too dreary and it's very depressing for some reason).<br />If you know Spike Jonze,you know that you're in for a weird,wild ride and \\"Being\\" promises to be just that but just adds up to being weird.<br />P.S.:The DVD features are intresting though.The bizarre TV spots,<BR>weird segments(one page features a in-depth look at puppetering),<BR>blank page,and an interview with Spike Jonze(which ends with Jonze vomitting) are worth giving this film a try...if you like your cinema a little bit strange...
B00005RY7X|5.0|As much as I stay away from addictions in my life, this cd has turned me into a liar...I am an AWK addict, and not looking for recovery.  I have not been able to take it out of my cd player.  After listening to it for three days straight, I told myself &quot;I'm going to turn it off and take a break so I don't get tired of it too quickly.&quot;  But then,  I couldn't.  I realized if something happened and I wasn't around tomorrow  or had lost my hearing, I would regret not listening to this album one more time.  Everyone has been saying for some time now that something big needs to come around and change music.  THIS IS IT.  Put it on and be ready for your face to ache from smiling and just dance like a maniac.  The only thing that might be better than this cd...Andrew WK's live shows.
B00005OWEG|5.0|It's hard to sit through a movie that's 3 ½ hours long; especially when you know how it ends. Titanic?! Until now...  What a duo Francis Coppola and Marlon Brando make.  Although they have had a few disappointments together, the stats are in their favor and Apocalypse Now Redux might only be second to the Godfather saga.  The added scenes help round out the story filling in important elements.  The movie seemed to flow better thus making the time pass quickly.  Martin Sheen is excellent; the plot, the direction and sound track was also excellent. Apocalypse Now Redux this is better than the theatrical release and thanks to the DVD market, producers and directors have an incentive to go back to the studio and recut the original for the lucrative aftermarket.  Apocalypse Now Redux is worth the time and dollars spent.  Add it to your collection and give the original to a friend.
0440219078|5.0|A fantastic future world creation.  Young and old alike will enjoy this amazing vision.  The young narrator lives in a community of the future where all citizens are selected for their jobs and trained at the age of 13.  There is no choice in this society but thereby also no haves and havenots.  The citizens live happily in their roles and don't question what they have or what they don't have.  Because everyone, everything is the same.  No one has ever known suffering or hunger or need, but in having never known it, they don't even know what it is.  When he is selected as the receiver of memories, our narrator realizes that the world has not always been the way it is.  And in so learning, he starts to question whether everything is always for the best.<br />An amazing work that will make you think about society, community, risk, and choice.  Will spark many deep thoughts and discussion.  A great read that will definitely make you think about society, structure, and opportunity.
B00005N9CV|4.0|Don't get me wrong. I really do like Diana Krall. I have most of her CD's. To say, however, that she is a great singer is really stretching it. The arrangements in this CD are some of the best she has done and they cover up some of her shortcomings (like the annoying habit she has of slurring up to nearly every note she sings). On the other hand, her piano playing is great. It would please me if she played more and sang less. I like especially what she chooses not to play as much as what she does. Her choices are intelligent and well thought out without trying to overwhelm you with her virtuousity.
B00001ODHJ|4.0|I laughed so hard I was crying tears while watching this movie.  If you loved the spoof of horor genre and comedy, this one is IT!  This is my first Bruce Campbell movie but does any of you noticed how closely he resembles Jim Carey from certain angles?  They both have the same high energy style in doing physical comedy and they both deliver halarious one-liners like no one else can.  I wish Bruce Campbell can do more movies.  I heard that he will be in Spiderman II.  Can wait to see him!!
B00005QG9J|5.0|When I heard 'Morning View' was to be released, I got myself pumped. I began to listen to all their other CD's more frequently to ready myself. When I played it for the first time, I was greatly suprised. Does it sound like 'Make Yourself' or 'S.C.I.E.N.C.E'? No--it has its own unique sound. It shows the maturation of the band, to say the least. With singles such as &quot;Nice To Know You,&quot; &quot;Wish You Were Here,&quot; and &quot;Warning,&quot; listeners can expect some similar songs on the album, but with a sound that is totally different. &quot;Nice To Know You&quot; starts off the album, very explosive. &quot;Circles&quot; follows which is a really heavy track and then the ever so popular &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; starts to slow things down a bit, but not for long. We are taken slowly into the track &quot;Just A Phase&quot; which explodes into heavy guitar riffs half-way through and the rock doesn't slow up through &quot;11am&quot; and &quot;Blood On The Ground&quot;  until track 7, &quot;Mexico&quot; where Brandon Boyd hauntingly sings 'You only think about yourself.' The final tracks on the CD take you for a ride, with &quot;Warning,&quot; Echo,&quot; &quot;Have You Ever,&quot; &quot;Are You In,&quot; all having a unique sound of their own. The last two tracks make a AWESOME ending to 'Morning View.' &quot;Under My Umbrella&quot; is a one of a kind song and &quot;Aqueous Transmission&quot;--WOW, this track blows me away. It is their very last song they perform on their Civic Tour 2002, and I can see why. It has an Asian feel to it where &quot;Further down the river&quot; is sung with such emotion by Boyd in the chorus. I dig this track a lot! <BR>WARNING- You won't go wrong with this CD!! It may not sound like their other material, but you will be very pleased!
B00000720W|5.0|This was Mayhem's second demo, the first came out a year prior to \\"Deathcrush\\", which was a pioneering effort for it's time ('87). There had been great, heavy, black bands before Mayhem (Venom, Hellhammer, Bathory,  Celtic Frost), but nothing to prepare anyone for the brutality that Mayhem would unleash with this classic. In fact, this was SO underground that in '87 very few people even knew of their existence outside of the small but burgeoning death metal scene in their native Norway. So...what you have here is 17 minutes and 29 seconds of pure unadulterated raw evil. Every track is as potent today (even after Mayhem's future-and greater- recordings) as it was when it first made the rounds to a disbelieving cult all those years ago. The sound of \\"Deathcrush\\" is the early rumblings of the  greatest metal band in existence, Mayhem.
0375507507|5.0|If there's one thing Alexandra Fuller can do, it's write. This unsentimental memoir of a white African childhood on various hardscrabble farms from 1972 to 1990, amidst periods of \\"unrest,\\" including Rhodesia's long struggle against white rule, captivates as it horrifies. With humor and unflinching honesty, Fuller immerses the reader in the welter of smells, searing heat, torrential rains and myriad dangers from man, animal and plantlife.<br />Her opening:<br />\\"Mum says, 'Don't come creeping into our room at night.'<br />They sleep with loaded guns beside them on the bedside rugs. She says, 'Don't startle us when we're sleeping.'<br />'Why not?'<br />'We might shoot you.'<br />'Oh.'<br />'By mistake.'<br />'Okay.' As it is, there seems a good enough chance of getting shot on purpose. 'Okay, I won't.' \\"<br />With these few lines, Fuller captures her tone - fluctuations of fear, bewilderment and humor. Her story is told primarily in present tense from her childhood point of view, though she skips around in chronology in order to follow theme threads: school, war, poverty, her mother's alcoholism and unpredictability. Her mother, Nicola, is ferocious, larger than life; a woman who can drag her daughter off without breakfast to spend the day on horseback rounding up wild cows or laze away a rainy day sprawled with both daughters on her bed reading. A woman whose manic-depressive tendencies were exacerbated by the heartbreaking deaths of three of her five children and exaggerated by alcohol. She's brave, unpredictable, loving and scary.<br />Racism in Fuller's world is a given, unquestioned by the child who sasses her nanny by threatening to fire her. Her parents are so poor they sell Nicola's rings each planting season and redeem them at harvest. Yet they have a houseful of servants and field hands. One day, her mother out, Fuller is bitten by something on her \\"downthere.\\" Despite her terrified wailing, her black nanny refuses to aid her. When Nicola finally arrives, she drags the child inside, exasperated, and warns her, \\" 'Never, ever pull down your shorts in front of an African again.\\"<br />Fuller concludes the incident: \\"That's how I remember Karoi. And the dust-stinging wind blowing through the mealies on a hot, dry September night....And the beginning of the army guys: men in camouflage, breaking like a ribbon out of the back of an army lorry and uncurling onto the road, heads shaved, faces fresh and blank. Men cradling guns. And the beginning of men not in camouflage anymore, looking blank-faced, limbs lost.\\"<br />There's a dark, manic hilarity to much of the book - the teenage Fuller crossing the border on her way to boarding school, her mother comatose from an all-night drunk. \\"Dad nods, smokes. I crush out my cigarette. We're both hoping Mum doesn't say anything to get us shot.\\" There are also gut-wrenching tragedies and moments of abject terror. The death of a sibling, her parents' grief-addled drunken driving, war. And there is Africa, a place of extremes, a place full of noises, smells and weather to make the rest of the world tame and drab in comparison, a place Fuller captures lovingly in her vivid, muscular, poetic prose.hild inside, exasperated, and warns her, \\" 'Never, ever pull down your shorts in front of an African again.\\"<br />Fuller concludes the incident: \\"That's how I remember Karoi.

B000009O8A|1.0|The plot is about as bare-bones as an exploitation film gets: A writer from the \\"big city\\" rents a country home to work on a new novel. A group of hicks attack and rape her several times, then leave her for dead. She recovers, and seduces, then murders them one by one. Roll credits. <br />I'm really baffled as to the purpose of this film.<br />Are the rape scenes realistic? Sure; they're graphic and uncomfortable. Is the realistic portrayal of rape in itself a worthy goal for a movie? Not really. I could make a movie that realistically portrays animal torture and prison sex... but without a plot or characters, why would anyone waste 90 minutes of their time?<br />Viewers who say there's some kind of feminist subtext to the film are putting a lot more thought into the picture than the director did. Keaton continues to be a sex object right until the end of the picture. <br />What's really awful about the film, though, is the completely amateurish acting, cinematography, dialogue and script. The movie does not even have a soundtrack. Really awful stuff. <br />If you want to see a rigorously disturbing horror/exploitation film that ALSO has some artistic sense, find a copy of \\"Cannibal Holocaust.\\" It's infinitely better than this awful, awful film.

0440178002|5.0|This rates up with the best books I have ever read.  The book looks imposing (more than 1200 pages) but once you start you will be about 500 pages into it before you know it.<br />Super-rich in history with one of the most interesting characters, Anjin-san (Japanese for Mr. Pilot).  Anjin-san is marooned in feudal Japan and makes a decision to change his Western thinking and fit in to the totally foreign but alluring Japanese society.<br />He is drawn into a forbidden love with a Japanese noblewoman, while battling jealous Japanese nobles and fanatical Jesuits.  He earns the trust of Lord Torenaga who is a wise tactician in the art of waging war and diplomacy.  Can Anjin-san survive the constant perils he is put into and win the hand of the woman he loves?  Trying to find the answers to these questions left me spellbound by this book.
B00005UEAR|1.0|I ve been a Dream Theater fan from the begaining, but this is a big let down to see this talented band go in this direction. On the second CD I thought I was listening to a Disneyland theme...I believe when the band came up with these songs, they didn't have any of the fans in mind--a totally selfish experimental disaster.  I hope they can recover from this aweful product in the future and I know there are many other DT fans shocked as well.  The talent is there in every song, but the way it was implemented was terrible.  Lord, please forgive them!
B00004Z459|5.0|Linkin Park's album \\"Hybrid Theory\\" is an exceptional debut worthy of all it's praise. I didn't actually consider buying the album until I heard the second single, \\"Crawling\\" which is when I began listening more closely when I noticed how good their lyrics were. Their lyrics is one of the main reasons I love Linkin Park so much. They sing about actual things that so many music fans can relate to- people, and how you deal, or don't deal, with relationships you form and break with people. Their style is actually quite unique in my opinoun- People can write them off as a Limp Bizkit cover band, but Chester Bennington and Mike Shinoda serve as a double threat vocally, something that Fred Durst cannot duplicate if he tried to. Their combination of rock and hip hop works so well in all of their songs. Another great thing about the album is that every track is great- worthy of radio play, and just as good, if not better, than the ever popular radio tracks (\\"In the end\\", \\"One Step Closer\\", and \\"Crawling\\") Here is a short review of all the tracks:<br />1) Papercut- Probably my favorite track on the album after \\"In the end\\" got overplayed. A great opener, showcases how Bennington and Shinoda work so well together.<BR>2) One step closer- Their first single, a harder song that is good to listen to if you feel like venting.<BR>3) With you- A great song. Awesome lyrics, one of the best songs on the album.<BR>4) Points of Authority- Could be their next single. A really great combination of hip hop and rock. <BR>5) Crawling- Showcases Chester's insane vocal ability, a good rock song that they won a Grammy for this year.<BR>6) Runaway- another great song. Good lyrics and shows their ability to contrast a quiet verse with a loud, in your face chorus.<BR>7) By Myself- wasn't my favorite at first due to the hard intro. It grows on you though, and now I really like it.<BR>8) In the end- we all know this one. was my favorite track...But its still  a great song with great lyrics and showcases Shinoda's ability to carry a song.<BR>9) A place for my head- One of my absolute favorites. Theres a catchy guitar riff and awesome lyrics.<BR>10) Forgotton- wasn't my favorite at first either, but now i really like it. The verses are well written and its a harder song on the album.<BR>11) Cure for the Itch- So much fun...its the instrumental track where DJ Mr. Hahn shows off his impeccable skills..don't skip this one...its a cool song.<BR>12)Pushing me away- Linkin Park's version of a ballad. Haha. I love this song, the lyrics are extremely relatable, has a tame verse with a hard chorus...great song. Nice ending to the album.<br />As a fan of rock, pop, and hip hop and rap, I promise you if you are a fan of music, great lyrics, and an innovative sound, you won't be dissappointed with the purchase of \\"Hybrid Theory\\"
B00000DQWT|4.0|The Pat Metheny Group gives Hollywood a taste of what's missing.  A movie soundtrack that is hip and smooth.  I love the tracks &quot;Daulton Lee&quot; and &quot;This is not America&quot;.  The rest is pretty good.  Very close recording to the movie.  Recommended!!
B00005JKJA|5.0|Mulholland Drive is an erotic, explosive and CONFUSING film.  I've read various interpretations of what the movie could and couldn't stand for and all led to the same conclusion, the movie is GREAT but no one understands it...<br />     But thats what is so great about, it deserves interpretation, explanation and opinions.  The most logical conclusion that I can muster from the film is that it is a dream, various stories and arcs overlapping each other, trying to be interpreted, only to succumb to another thought.  We, the viewer, linger on one story, then transition onto another with little justification.  It may seems illogical and disoriented, but whose dreams aren't?  <br />   Don't be fooled!  These actors and actresses can act!  When I first saw the film, I thought \\"This acting is soooooo wooden, why did Lynch allow this to hit the screen?\\"  But everyone holds their weight, and when Naomi Watts goes in for her audition, she will blow your mind!<br />   But if you can't accept an confusing \\"artsy-fartsy\\" flick, then I suggest seeing the film for the visuals... David Lynch filmed a fantastically erotic and absorbing movie that takes the audience on a mind-blowing adventure around L.A.  The individual scenes range romantic, violent, hilarious and sexy, yet the most powerful scene comes when the two vixens attend a performance by a sensual Spanish singer (or is she really singing, are we really watching her, etc.)<BR>    <BR>    The debates and questions on the film could go on forever, with everyone throwing in their own two cents, but the truth is the Mulholland Drive in an engrossing film and a true mind adventure.  Though the DVD is bare on its extras, the movie is too good to pass up, I suggest that everyone (at least) rent the movie and watch it once, wait a day or two, and watch it again.  If you still don't have a perception on the story, at least you experienced a wonderful ride.

B00004U30D|3.0|Well, it was certainly interesting.  The movie captures your attention quickly with Kevin Spacey's statement that he will die.  Throughout the movie several possibilities are presented to the viewer as to who will murder him.  The plot isn't very realistic, but I don't believe it was meant to be.  The drug abuse, the troubled teens, troubled marriages and etc. are all thrown together for exaggerated dramatic effect.  Good and amusing movie.

B00000ING2|5.0|It is a tribute to how good the Coen brothers are at making movies that this film is considered one of their weaker works.  Considering that even this movie is better than 90% of the movies out there, it is clear that the Coen brothers know what they're doing.<br />Although technically set in 1959, this is a 1940s style movie, especially reminiscent of Capra's works.  Almost everything about the work is brilliant, starting with Tim Robbins as a naive man thrust into a figurehead position at the top of a giant corporation and Paul Newman as the coldly ruthless business who put him there.  The settings are fantastic, some of the scenes are especially funny (I particulary like the &quot;blue letter&quot; sequence), and the story is enjoyable from start to finish.  <br />This is a great movie, a reminder of the great movies of the past and an indication that great movies are still possible today.
B00005ARDC|4.0|Good CD. The Hives are getting more attention, so are the Strokes, but this album's better. I can't quite put my finger on their sound yet. If nothing else, it makes good driving music for first thing in the morning. If it were a choice between this and the White Stripes new album, I'd get the White Stripes.
B00000JGHM|5.0|Al Pacino and Robert De Niro are two of my favorite actors.  So when I found out that they would be in a movie together, I was very excited to see it.  \\"Heat\\" is a crime saga masterpiece that mixes drama and film noir together.  Combine all of those elements together and you get one hell of a movie.<br /><br />Pacino plays a L.A. detective who is obsessed with his job.  He has dedicated his life to put away every single criminal in the state.  Much so that he has become obsessed with his job.  De Niro plays a criminal who loves to go on heists.  A professional he is, and he never gets caught.  Soon, the two's lives collide with each other and all hell breaks out.  Pacino becomes obsessed with catching De Niro.  He will not rest until he is locked up.<br /><br />That is only half of the story.  There are many stories in this crime drama that interact with each other.  Other great actors in this film include Val Kilmer, Tom Sizemore, Ashley Judd, Jon Voight, and many more.  Every character is unique in his or her way.<br /><br />The director/writer does an excellent job of making us feel sympathy for the characters, even the bad ones.  He has created a very dark and gloomy world in which nothing is certain.  Problems lurk around every corner, ready to destroy each person.  Don't be mistaken, this isn't an action flick.  This is more of a film noir if anything.  It's dark, the tone is somber, and it doesn't have the happiest ending.  Although there is a bank heist scene in the movie that has to be one of the best action sequences in a long time.<br /><br />As much as I love Robert De Niro, and he does a great job portraying his character, Pacino steals the show.  It's one of his best roles in recent years.  He's vulgar, rude, offensive, and short-tempered.  But, he also has a heart, and you get to see that as the movie progresses.  As serious as his character is supposed to be, he has some of the funniest lines you will ever hear him say.  He definitely wins \\"best actor\\" in my book.<br /><br />Again, this isn't an action film.  It is very long (almost three hours), and it is very story oriented.  The film concentrates on character development the most.  This is a great film that realistically portrays these kinds of characters.  This is a movie about choices and consequences, and you're not exactly sure how the movie will end.  A very good movie that should've received more recognition.<br /><br />P.S.  I haven't had the chance to check out the special features on this DVD.  From what I remember, there isn't too many.  But that would be because the movie is so long, and it's all on one side.r\\" in my book.<br /><br />Again, this isn't an action film.

6305718954|1.0|Gabriel Byrne is a Vatican priest investigating stigmata wounds that appear on an American atheist woman (Patricia Arquette).  Potentially good premise is given the ham-fisted, no subtlelty approach, with a script that has no idea what it's trying to say, not to mention also featuring a distinct lack of intelligence.  The direction is just as bad, with MTV-style and rapid-cut editing in place of genuine filmmaking.  Ironically, this was released the same weekend as Stir of Echoes, the best pure horror film of the year.  Watch that movie instead.
B00000ING2|5.0|It is a tribute to how good the Coen brothers are at making movies that this film is considered one of their weaker works.  Considering that even this movie is better than 90% of the movies out there, it is clear that the Coen brothers know what they're doing.<br />Although technically set in 1959, this is a 1940s style movie, especially reminiscent of Capra's works.  Almost everything about the work is brilliant, starting with Tim Robbins as a naive man thrust into a figurehead position at the top of a giant corporation and Paul Newman as the coldly ruthless business who put him there.  The settings are fantastic, some of the scenes are especially funny (I particulary like the &quot;blue letter&quot; sequence), and the story is enjoyable from start to finish.  <br />This is a great movie, a reminder of the great movies of the past and an indication that great movies are still possible today.
0671027379|4.0|The book begins in Washington DC with an acrimonious meeting between presidential candidate Senator Sedgewick Sexton and his daughter, Rachel. This meeting establishes for us the dislike for one another these two have. From the moment this meeting finishes, the action begins and doesn't let up.<br />We follow Rachel, who works for the NRO a government agency responsible for handling sensitive information. After a rushed meeting with none other than the President, she finds herself winging her way north to Milne Island inside the Arctic Circle. She is then faced with what could best be described as the greatest discovery in earth's history.<br />Just as the reader is getting over this whirlwind opening, the tone takes a sinister turn and Rachel, along with a couple of scientists find themselves fighting for their lives. Meanwhile, tensions are no less charged back in Washington with political powerbrokers hard at work trying to control the media while keeping one eye on the events far to their north.<br />One small annoying aspect of the book was Dan Brown's insistence on endlessly drawing out the big earth-shattering revelations. Rather than come straight out and tell us what all the fuss is about, he put us through a big song and dance routine time and again until I felt like putting my hands into the pages of the book and throttling it out of the book. It became a tad frustrating after the fifth or sixth time it happened. It went something along the lines of, \\"So, why was I summoned here so urgently?\\" and the answer would invariably be \\"Perhaps I should show you, if you would just walk this way.\\" I'd much prefer to be told and then walk that way.<br />Apart from this minor gripe, I think this is a very entertaining thriller that makes good use of the latest stealth technology, presented in a believable and enjoyable story.
B000002C1V|5.0|The best Floyd album, but not for the new fan. Put it in and lay back and enjoy.
B00005JL3A|4.0|Milla Jovovich (looking incredibly sexy, might I add) is an amnesiac who unwillingly becomes part of a group of commandos sent to a large underground facility to destroy a sentient computer.  Unfotunately, what they don't realize is that awaiting them are hordes of the living dead who are hungry for human flesh!  Action/horror film directed by Paul Anderson mixes in elements from Cube, Ghosts of Mars, and Day of the Dead, and is never entirely successful, due to some bad acting (Jovovich, surprisingly enough, being the exception), a grating industrial musical score, and zombie shootouts that aren't directed with as much flair or intensity as you might expect.  Still, there are several standout sequences that are tense and thrilling, particularly a scene where approaching lasers try to make mincemeat out of the team inside an enclosed hallway, several exciting fight scenes against zombies, and the suspenseful finale that pits the survivors against a monstrous genetic experiment.  Definitely recommended to genre fans, and once again, Jovovich just rocks in this movie.
B000003S0F|3.0|Essentially the debut album by the third incarnation of KC, Islands (named after John Donne's famous &quot;No man is an island&quot;)stands alone in the Crimso pantheon; this particular line up of KC would vanish after the album and tour were complete. KC would splinter after Fripp (under intense emotional pressure) ceased speaking to the other band members during their tour. The fourth album by Fripp under the KC guise stands alone; Islands is still adrift from the bulk of the material Fripp recorded under the KC mantle.<br />The musicians acquit themselves admirably. Boz Burrell probably wasn't the best choice to sing lead vocals here (although his style does fit in with the Greg Lake style of delivery of the first two albums and Gordon Haskall's style as well)but he does pretty well given the material. Clearly influenced by what was happening with the jazz-fusion movement at the time, Islands really belongs to sax player Mel Collins. Collins provided the woodwinds and saxes after the departure of founding member Ian McDonald for the 2nd and 3rd Crimso albums. His haunting, earthy style adds a passion that wouldn't be rediscovered until Adrian Belew joined the band in the 80's.<br />The diverse selection of tracks demonstrate Fripp's arrival as a composer. While previous KC efforts had some stunning moments (most notably Cadence and Cascade &amp; Cat Food from the 2nd album and one or two tracks from the third), Fripp hadn't quite discovered his unique composing voice. Despite the pressure of assembling the third incarnation of KC, recording the album and touring to support it, Fripp's songwriting blossomed. A pity that Fripp has chosen not to generally release the live album available at the Discipline website; it demonstrates that this version of KC, despite its limitations, had congealed into a powerful band.<br />Islands marks the end of Fripp's collaboration with lyricst Peter Sinfield as well. The three studio albums recorded after Islands would have little in common with the three four that preceded them. Islands is probably the most radically different of the first four KC albums from the later works. The jazz influences were put on more prominent display than previous albums.<br />The opening track Formentea Lady features a wailing soprano performance that underpins Burrell's relaxed vocal. It mixes advant garde with mainstream prog in a way not previously seen (I'd venture a guess that this track may have been an influence on Pink Floyd's Great Gig in the Sky). The contrast between the two performances creates dramatic tension that continues until about midway through the way. Sailor's Tale continues the tension until Fripp's explosive guitar break. ST is actually one of the strongest gems on the album and more than makes up for the way Formentea Lady runs out of steam.<br />The rest of the album varies from interesting (Song of the Gulls, Islands) to embarassing (Ladies of the Road which, I might add, hasn't aged all that well). The third incarnation of KC offered much potential which, sadly, wasn't delivered upon as the group vaporized after their US tour. Islands offers a fascinating glimpse at the road not taken. Both Burrell and Collins would be embittered by the experience of working with Fripp during the tour. Drummer Ian Wallace (one of the finest studio drummers working) would eventually reconcile with Fripp (Wallace is the author of the liner notes for the live album released by Discipline Global Mobile).in common with the three four that preceded them.

B00003CXI1|4.0|As a prof. of mine says, \\"you can always tell what's good about somehting so there's no need to discuss that\\" so I'll just address the parts that were a bit of a disappointment. <BR>I first picked up a Harry Potter book for a course I was taking on the role of the adolescent in literature, in which I was supposed to do an annotated bib of modern YA novels. I begrudged Harry all the hype surrounding him, assuming that I would never fall for somehting so publicized. I was wrong. I read all four books back to back in two monthes and this was with a 15 credit course load at the same time, so enough said. <br />So in terms of the film, you can only imagind my excitement over its release on video (I'd been interested in it in the theaters just based on the adverts but couldn't get anyone too see it with me, at the time).<BR>I preordered the DVD from Amazon.co.uk and when it arrived my family insisted on my waiting for them to watch it, since my interest in the books had spread to them like wildfire by then (My fifty-one year old dad is just about to finish his turn through them all).<br />The movie was so much like the book with the exception of the end that it left little for me to see new - that is I had already watched it as such in my mind and so if felt like nothing I was seeing was anything different. <BR>I enjoyed being introduced to the characters for the first time, but I was surprised to find Harry the tallest of the group, when in the books Ron calls him a midget. Also, I personally thought Herminoe was almost too cute, since I always pictured her as being a bit homely - although my dad had a fit over how well she was cast, so I suppose good protrayal is a bit subjective.<BR>That aside, I liked the characters. I didn't even mind Daniel Radcliffe being the tallest eleven-year-old I've seen to date, he did such a nice job - exactly as I pictured Harry, aside from the height.<BR>While a lot of reviews criticized Rupert Grint for not being sarcastic enough in his role as Ron, I was pleasantly surprised after reading them, to find that I enjoyed him. <br />I think there were essentially three drawbacks to the movie that promtped me to give it four stars instead of five:<br />The movie, prbably due to time constraints, had almost none of the satire that I loved so much in the book - it was like all the Harry Potter story with very little of the heart. I think this was not so much a fault of the actors, but that they just tried to fit too much else in. I would have preferred more good dialogue, even if it meant lengthening it or cutting out something. It was just lacking in this dept, which kept me from being completely \\"into\\" it so I felt very little empathy with the movie, unlike the book. The one exception was in the \\"Mirror or Erised\\" scene, which I thought was touching. <br />The other thing that I thought caused the movie to suffer was that they had Harry being much sharper and more sure of himself than in the books. Hermione was really the one who solved most of the mystery and the way they discovered Flamel on screen threw me a bit. Also, the entire encounter with Voldemort was changed. That bit felt more like \\"Harry Potter meets the Mummy,\\" which was a letdown. I thought it odd that they would be so careful about detail and yet alter the most important scene so dramatically.<br />Lastly, although I enjoyed the Quidditch scene, it too fast moving and at times, hard to follw, and looked a bit fake, especially when people got knocked askew on their broomsticks - more like puppets than people, really. <br />Although I outlined primarily what I considered to be flaws, I did enjoy the movie as a whole and am looking forward to the sequal. I was not thrilled with it, but pleasantly surprised, especially with the performances of the children, since child actors usually have a tendency to act too young or old instead of their supposed age level.<BR>I would recommend this movie to anyone, whether they read the books or not, but would say to read them first, anyway. I think it was better for me that I did.<BR>I'll probably end up buying the American version as well, and go to the Borders midnight Harry Potter party to do it, too.<BR>I am a loyal fan, so although I'm a little bit let down, I have faith in the future releases, and will be fairly content, as long as they're as good as the first.

Some of the song lyrics may seem a little corny to most people who listen to hard rock, but the CD grows on you, and now i listen to it all the time. And if you get a chance, go see AWK live, he puts on one hell of a show.
630471193X|4.0|&quot;Phenomenon&quot; has to be John Travolta's best role ever! His role as &quot;George&quot; almost seems to nice to rate this a 5-star movie. However, the role was played like it should have been. To me, the movie is all about relationships we have with each other and how we effect others through those relationships. The movie has you speculating why he now has a &quot;special gift&quot; as evidenced on the assumptions of the townsfolks. He's betrayed often in the name of fear and ignorance. Yet, he never gives up his friendship. The emotional swings that fly through the movie seem very genuine in the characters. I felt that the casting was excellent and highly recommend this movie to everyone. It's one I'm glad to have as part of my DVD Collection!
6305546789|4.0|Dr. Loomis is the lone voice against releasing psychotic killer Michael Myers from the asylum  -  Myers murdered his sister with a knife when he was five on Halloween night, and hasn't spoken a word since.  Loomis' warnings don't matter anyway, since Michael manages his own way out.  He's on his way back to Haddonfield, Illinois, his old haunt, to carve out a new name for himself, and teenager Jamie Lee Curtis and her friends have become his new target...<br />Considering John Carpenter made this movie for almost nothing, it's a masterpiece.  The skillful direction and competent cast carry it all off, scaring the pants off the audience with old-fashioned tricks in fine style.  Suggestion and stalking shots are the film's principal arsenal, with some good use of hand-held camera killer's POV shots.  The movie is, in some places (especially toward the end), extremely violent, yet there is almost no blood anywhere.  The photography is really quite good, given that most of the budget was eaten-up on star Donald Pleasance's salary, and the Carpenter and John Howarth theme music is hauntingly effective.<br />Especially high marks go to newcomer Jamie Lee Curtis and veteran horror actor Pleasance.  Curtis wasn't yet completely comfortable in front of the camera, but that mostly works in her favor, here, lending to her besieged character's vulnerability, and she is naturally quite likeable.  Pleasance graces anything in which he appears, and he was at his best in this ongoing movie series, making such lines as describing Myers as \\"evil on two legs\\" sing, instead of stutter.
0345350499|2.0|The Mists of Avalon, written by Marion Zimmer Bradley, tells the story of a young priestess of the Goddess Diana, called Morgaine.  Morgaine is sister to King Arthur of Camelot.  The story unwinds from the parents of the siblings into a four-book story.  Morgaines religion is being over run by the new religion Christianity.  Morgaine becomes involved in scandal and a web of lies.<BR> I found this novel to be drawn out and boring at times.  The Mists of Avalon is 876 pages long and becomes very complicated and confusing.  The story is extremely graphic and explicit in detail.  There are gruesome battles and atrocious murders.  Many of the romantic and intimate sections of the novel were extremely distasteful and unbecoming of the story. It is also my belief that rape is very serious and by the author using such coarse language on the matter it created a pornographic mood. <BR> I would not recommend this novel to anyone who has a squeamish stomach or is under the age of 15.  It is in my opinion that this novel is not appropriate in a school setting.
B00005JKED|4.0|This is not for the good-natured, optimistic viewer.  This movie is hard-core, raunchy, rude, crude, and in your face about the realities of police politics and interworkings.<br />A sensitive viewer should not see this movie; however, I appreciated both Ethan Hawk and Denzel Washington (one of my favorite actors) in this interplay trajedy up to par with what Shakespear would have done today.
0451457994|5.0|Science is not fantasy in this book.<BR>A very enjoyable journey through the solar system and an ultimate frontier to reach for a human. If you liked the movie you'll like the book even better. Pay attention to the scientific details. Also, this novel makes you wonder if human minds and electronic minds are any different, it seems stress affects computers too.
0064407667|5.0|This book is probably one of the best sries I've ever read and I can't wait for all 13. One of the reasons I LOVE this book is because it keeps you on the edge of your seat never knowing what was going to happen next. Helping with the suspense was all th unfortunate things that continued to happen to the Baudelaire children and when anything good seemed to happen something worse took it's place. I also believe this book is better than The [other] Series because this is REALISTIC, not good things always happen to people, [other] a normal wizard overcame the most evil and powerful Lord Voldemort, yet never got hurt. But yet these children cannot escape a crimanal mastermind. Therefore it shows that nice things don't always happen to the nice people that don't diserve it, and they can't just squeeze out of an impossible situation. It may seem a little too much bad luck for the children but it's much better than the cleache of the heroes always winning. To sum it up, READ THE BOOK AND HAVE AN OPEN MIND.<br />P.S. For those that have a problem with this book or any others in the series...
0684803356|4.0|For Whom the Bell Tolls is a great example of Hemingway's to-the-point writing style. He does not repeat himself more than he has to, and stays on the story.<br />I enjoyed reading For Whom the Bell Tolls mostly because of Hemingways writing style and the historical background. Being a young male reader, I did not enjoy the love part of the story. I did not feel there was enough going on.<br />Overall, Hemingway made a great classic story of the Spanish Civil War, and a unique, to the point writing style which I enjoy.

(For the Lynch haters out there this is defiantly NOT the film that will turn your opnion on him around)<BR>So for the remaining movie viewers out there IM guessing your either torn between the Lynch liker and Lynch hater or you may have just heard of this film from people at the water cooler at work, let me forewarn you, if your the type of movie goer who has to be completly fullfilled, needs closer, and doesn't really like to spend time analyzing the movie/movies they have just spent 2 1/2 hours watching, [Forrest Gump] this and any Lynch film for that matter will NOT be in your forte. If on the other hand you like to break the norm of your typical Hollywood Happy ending and be Challenged then Mulholland Drive is right up your alley. <br />IM not gunna waste my time explaining the plot because it's already been done over 200 times on this very site. What I will say about the film though is that it's one of the most brilliant, Challenging, emotional, well thought out, well directed, and well written movies I've had the pleasure of viewing. The Brilliance behing the film is what you the viewer make of it. Every time I watch it (7 times now) I find something that wasn't there before, changing what I think the movie is really about slighly.<br />Now instead of rambling on anymore let's recap. If your into the normal Hollywood movies, STAY AWAY, STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS FILM, you will just end up feeling empty and possibly mad once the movie has finished and you may even, (god forbid) express your hatred for the movie on Amazon.com possibly taking the plessure away from another viewer who may be on the cusp of deciding to give this film a chance, all because you didn't understand it.  <br />If on the other hand your like me and like a little more out of your movie viewing then click on the ADD TO SHOPPING CARTright NOW!!!!!!!
B00005Q3KC|5.0|The Corrs are an Irish group that broke through in the UK with their unique fusion of Celtic and pop music.  Unfortunately, despite a surge of popularity around the period of their hugely successful `Talk On Corners' album, the group have simply been unable to shake the `easy listening' tag that has assured that their success has become much more limited.  This is a shame, especially given the high quality music on offer here.<br />Starting off with the brand new `Would You Be Happier' (also a single), nice little guitar-driven pop songs seems to be the Corrs' speciality.  Whilst it's true that the group's later material isn't nearly as good as their earlier music, the songs here nearly all sparkle.  In particular, the dreamy yet understandable vocals of lead singer Andrea Corr are gorgeous, especially on the Fleetwood Mac cover 'Dreams'.  Although almost every song is a love song, the majority remain separate from each other for a variety of reasons.  For instance, the remix of `What Can I Do?' makes it a great deal edgier and therefore more interesting and the forlorn `Forgiven Not Forgotten' from the group's first album is a real stand-out.  However, by far the best track here is the delightfully bitter `I Never Loved You Anyway', even if the best song the group has ever done - `Queen Of Hollywood' - isn't included.<br />Even though the newer tracks never match the standard that the songs from the earlier albums set, this is still remarkably consistent and is definitely to be recommended.
0060955775|5.0|I am not surprised that Veronika decides to die is an international bestseller. It is written by Paulo Coelho, who was born in Brazil.<BR>This book has definitely inspired and/or changed the lives of many people out there. It is a book that will make you think, appreciate life.<BR>It was my first experience of Paulo Coelho and it has made me to read more. He has a gift for writing books, which changes the way you think about life in general. That book is undoubtedly a phenomenon. I really enjoyed reading this satisfying book. I found the story quite gripping. It is a wonderful although bizarre declaration of love to all mad people in our world and to the life itself. The book really touched me very deeply. Paulo Coelho tells from elementary experiences and the readers recognize themselves: with their frailties and fears and also with their yearnings and dreams.<br />Short summary of Veronika decides to die:<BR>Veronika has everything she could wish for. She is young and pretty, with plenty of attractive boyfriends. She has a steady job and a loving family. Yet Veronika is not happy and one winters morning she takes an overdose of sleeping pills, only to wake up some time later in a local mental hospital. There she is told that although she is alive, her heart is now irreparably damaged and she has only a few days to live. First Veronika feels a tiny bit happy about that message. Then she begins to think about her life.<br />This story follows her through these intense days as she starts to question all her ideas about life. Soon she comes to realize that every second of existence is a choice we all make between living and dying.<BR>The way it alters her way of thinking and seeing the world. How she starts to question everything around her and also her own mortality. The way Veronika explores her life is inspirational.<BR>It obviously shows us how often we dont know what we have until it is too late.<BR>In addition to its messages, Veronika decides to die offers an interesting insight into how people deal with mental illness.<br />A review of this novel would not be complete without mentioning the doctor, the ambitious psychiatrist with his eyes on alternative techniques and methods. He is a central character in the plot of this book, although you dont actually see a great deal of him. At this point I dont want to write much more about that book. I dont want to ruin it for those people, who have not read this great book yet.<br />In conclusion may I say that it is a moving and uplifting song of life, one that reminds us that every moment in our lives is special and precious. Paulo Coelho is a wonderful storyteller with the power to inspire nations and change peoples lives.<BR>I can highly recommend to read this and/or other books of Paulo Coelho.<BR>An excellent novel! A must read for all!<BR>It has changed my way of thinking. I am sure that it will change also your way of thinking!
B00005QIPH|5.0|So what if The Strokes are reminiscent of the Velvets, Television, and The Stooges? So what if pre-punk is gone, and The Strokes choose to reach back into that glorious period? It's a lot better than having another band imitate and strive to be (ughh!) Creed. Is This It? should please fans of early punk and pre-punk as the Strokes gritty, sleazy, funky swagger is an irresistable force. Their influences are evident, but The Strokes are able to find their own voice and produce two of the best singles from any genre in years (\\"Last Nite\\" and \\"Hard To Explain\\"). Other tracks such as \\"Barely Legal\\" and \\"Take It Or Leave It\\" harken back to times when rock meant singing with soul and sounding virbrant, alive, and raw in spirit. No, Is This It? definitely won't make you get rid of Marquee Moon or White Light/White Heat, but it's still one of the best things to come out of 2001, a year sadly devoid of much good music. So ignore the cynics who judge a band by their connections (Wow, some members of The Strokes are related to famous people; I guess it's not cool to like them.), amount of commerical success, or hype, and give one of last year's best discs a spin. It will at least bring a smile to your face.<br />P.S. And if you're going to trash the Strokes for wearing their influences on their sleeves, you may as well trash a great little band known as Nirvana.
B00005JL3A|2.0|When this movie was released in Australi, not many theatres picked it up. I can see why.<BR>A pathetic remake of a video game classic, it follows the likes of Mortal Kombat (by the same director) and Tomb Raider. Although director Paul Anderson did well in creating tension, and overall adding a rather eerie and freaky element to the movie, the actual story has many things left to be desired.<BR>There are a few goods bits though. The start was well contrived, leading the watchers to feel for the soon-to-be-killed employees of the Umbrella corporation.<BR>It falls rapidly downhill from there. Somehow, directors seem to get a thrill in having leading star Milla Jovovich naked when we first see her and when we leave her (think Fifth Element). It wasn't much of an acting challenge for Jovovich, just a few looks here and there, and a number of well-placed kicks. The supporting actors were not much better. Michelle Rodriguez, known better as Lennie in The Fast and the Furious, puts on an act not unlike Velazques in Aliens.<BR>Highlights include the laser killing techniques that bring to mind the opening sequence of alternative movie Cube, which used thin wires for the same effect, the death sequences, the alarming jump that one gets when a former employee reanimates for the first time, and the startling eery super-computer, the Red Queen, which in my opinion was the best character of the lot.<BR>Even the casting of dancers as the zombies was a good idea, making their movements realistic.<BR>But the whole story had a lot of flaws. The explaination of the zombies was extremely inaccurate and unbelievable, as well as their following of our 'heros'.<BR>As a business student too, the actions of the Umbrella Corporation after the Hive was sealed and the survivors rescued was extremely inaccurate. But I won't get into that.<BR>Apart from the small highlights, the movie was extremely poor. Only watch it if you are a die-hard fan, or like getting kicks from extreme gore.
B000001ESP|5.0|When I say that--I mean the best rock album of all time.  It is the perfect integration of bass, guitar, synth, and lyrics.  It is not too heavy, not too soft--just right! :-)  I can listen to this album over and over and never get tired of it.  Rush is always dissed by the non-rush fans.  They just don't get it--I am convinced of that.  Rush clearly belongs in the R &amp; R Hall of Fame for this album alone.  I cannot think of one album in Rock music that is superior to this one.  I guess that is why Rush has been selling millions of albums and tickets over the past 25 years with little to no promotion (unlike bands like Aerosmith, U2, etc.).  KEEP ON ROCKIN....
B0000668IF|3.0|Moby Moby Moby . . . I wouldn't want to have to follow up 'Play' either . . .<br />I didn't find this terribly imaginative.  We Are All Made of Stars is likely the most boring song ever written.  18 has all of this potential, but the songs tend to fall flat.  Some tracks are simply 'Play' outtakes (and these are sadly the best).  Give up the guitar too.  Oy!  At times I wondered if I were listening to some sort of Alan Parsons Project parallel universe . . .

The characters and themes of this book make Ecclesiastes the perfect pretext for anyone about to read \\"The Sun Also Rises.\\"<br />Hemingway's novel is a simple novel featuring several acquaintances and a few weeks of their lives spent mostly in Spain watching bullfights and Pamplona's now-famous Running of the Bulls.  The characters are very human and in their conversations Hemingway shows the reader their numerous faults.  They are lazy, selfish, untrusting, often drunk, and very shallow.  Through each other they distract themselves from finding any deeper meaning in their existences.  So they drink, admire the beautiful scenery in Spain, and watch bullfights.  Like the repetition of life and death in the bullfights they frequent, the characters half-heartedly attempt to solve their problems and only find subsequent troubles replacing those they do manage to slay.<br />\\"Yet when I surveyed all that my hands had done<BR>   and what I had toiled to achieve,<BR> everything was meaningless, a chasing after the wind;<BR>   nothing was gained under the sun.\\" -- Ecc. 2:11<br />Hemingway has created these characters to be endlessly frustrating and seemingly beyond hope, but in doing so he makes them approachable, captivating, and people that every human being can relate to.  \\"There is not a righteous man on earth who does what is right and never sins.\\" -- Ecc. 7:20<br />\\"The Sun Also Rises\\" is probably Hemingway's greatest work, and it's main theme is even sadder when viewed in relation to his suicide.  With this book, Hemingway left humanity a beautiful work of art, truly worthy of its classic status... but in taking his life, he showed us a very logical end result of characters such as these.  Bright, lovable, passionate, and utterly hopeless.  <br />\\"...for without Him, who can eat or find enjoyment?\\" -- Ecc. 2:25
0394800184|5.0|This was a BIG favourite of my 3 yr old son, I had to read it every night for months.  I lost track of how many times I had to read it (Not AGAIN, I would groan silently!).  Thankfully, my son eventually got tired of hearing it and we could move on to other stories!  He could practically read the story back to me by memory.
B0000668IF|5.0|Simply brilliant. Play was a great album, 18 is a brilliant one. 18 is more subtle and introspective than Play. It has few club mega hits as Play had such as Body Rock or obvious hits such as South Side or Natural Blues. Don't get me wrong, there are radio hit friendly tunes here, We Are All Made of Stars is the most compelling. Also, Jam For The Ladies could be one of those club hits that bring the house down given the right remix. What 18 does have in abundance are haunting songs that stick to your bones after a couple of plays. The two songs that Sinead O'Connor contributes vocal chops are simply unforgettable, especially on Harbour, she is at the top of her vocal style. Moby himself contributes his voice to several tunes, giving an admirable vocal performance for someone with limited vocal skill, note the haunting Signs of Love. Other songs of note, In This World for its incredibly moving vocal. Another Woman for its powerful voice song over a very inspired bass/rhythm/piano background with very solid production work. I'm Not Worried at all is a very spiritually influenced song that can fit at home in any church revival. The influences on this album are many that were on Play, African American church music, American soul, 80's electronic and dance music, alternative music of the non-thrash colour. With 18, Moby has delivered the second classic of his long career (anybody remember that he sang vocals briefly for the punk rock/art band Flipper?). For those wanting to see what Moby is all about, spend some money and buy both Play and 18, you will not be disappointed. If you already own Play, than 18 is a no brainer.

B00001OH1S|5.0|I play this CD when I need a mental escape.  The jazz mellows me out.  Sinnerman and Caban La ka Kratchie take me away to tropical islands.  My favorite is Everything by Wasis Diop.  Every time I hear it I think of good scotch...smoky, sultry, sexy.  I just melt.  Buy this CD for a classy dinner date or just when you need to imagine one.
0345448898|5.0|these books were fabulous!  i got the first one for christmas when it first came out, and read it about a dozen times waiting for the next two books.  i read the other two, and was just as delighted.  as usual, with most of my books, i got some friends hooked on them too.  unfortunately, we think the third cuts off too soon, and are going to write to mr. pullman to ask him for aanother installation....at least one more book.  otherwise, they were great!!!!
0060930349|5.0|What a fantastic journey!  Paul Johnson's masterful telling of the American story has a scope and a beauty I was not anticipating.  <br />Most American histories seem to revel in deconstructing and undermining its proud achievements and remarkable individuals, yet Johnson, while fully acknowledging the dark areas of our past, boldly celebrates what it is that makes America great, without apology or qualification. His presentation of The United States of America as a largely positive force in world history is a radical, almost heretical, concept to those who would prefer to reinvent it as some kind of imperialistic scourge.   <br />Disregard some of the charges you may have read in other reviews that this book is merely some kind of conservative &quot;political tract&quot;.  The wrath of the left is usually incurred whenever FDR and JFK are not portrayed as Solomonic demi-gods.  As to the charge that Republicans are safe from Johnson's critique, skeptics should re-read the sections on Hoover and Reagan.  Reagan, while given genuine credit for his successes, certainly did not come off as the mythic, infallible figure conservatives are constantly accused of enshrining.<br />What I apprecated most about &quot;A History of the American People&quot; was Johnson's willingness to diverge from governmental politics and explore the areas of emerging American culture (such as literature, architecture, industry and music) as well as the lives of average American citizens, or &quot;the teeming masses&quot; as some would say.<br />Far from being ignored (as some reviewers have charged), the average, everyday Americans are a constant presence throughout Johnson's book...like a faint, but steady, pulse beat.  While most of the book DOES focus upon noteable individuals, Johnson takes generous amounts of time to put his finger on the pulse of American society.  The dreams, follies, philosophies and tragedies  of the American people as a whole are vividly and poignantly captured by Johnson on a regular basis. <br />This book gets my highest possible recommendation.  It is the first history of Johnson's that I have read, but certainly not the last.
0380789019|3.0|I was so swept up in this story with all of it's unexpected twists and turns and fabulous characters. However, as the book winds down, it seems as if the writer was in a hurry to finish and the characters suddenly become shallowly depicted. It seemed as if the ending was re-written to condense it and the way the main characters leave things made little sense and left me feeling cheated. Overall, A good writer but the ending made me feel like I wasted the hours I enjoyed at the beginning of the book.
0451196716|4.0|This was a very strange book.  It took our reality and made a chilling twist to it where there is a contest every year and a hundred or so young guys walk continuously until they can't any longer.  When they can't they're killed.  At times the book seemed to be a bit slow and at times it seemed to jump ahead too quickly.  I found the ending to be a little to quick and unlcear, but just the idea behind the book, and how the characters excepted this as normal and fun is all-out creepy.
0380789035|5.0|Even though American Gods contains sections which are a bit clumsy, and some of the plot twists are not too well-handled, I can't help but give five stars to such an inventive, complex piece of dark fantasy.  The cliches of &quot;page-turner&quot; and &quot;believable characters&quot; really apply here, and Gaiman is to be congratulated on doing such a good job with such a huge task.  The &quot;historical sections&quot; are absolutely mesmerizing and show us that, despite his flaws, Gaiman really is a born storyteller.  If his next novel is better than this one, Mr. King's career is over!
B000002H6C|5.0|I first bought this when it came out  in my area on 09/07/1988. I was a huge Metallica fan and was expecting an excellent album coming off of \\"Puppets\\". I was wondering if they had peaked musically at \\"Puppets\\" and was very impressed that they outdone themselves again with \\"Justice\\". Their fourth full length album saw very complex arrangements, very heavy guitar tones, technical solos, and excellent drum playing. The total time of the album clocked in at over 70 minutes with songs as long  as 9min. None seemed boring and only got better with the second half of the disc. The production could have been better in the sense that the bass should have been more clear but it was drowned out from many layering of the rythem guitar and it's heavy Mesa/Boogie tone. <BR>At thst point all of the band members have drastically improved within their specialties since their first full length album \\"Kill Em All\\" in 1983. Jason Newsted did have some good fills if you listen to it closely. I am still blown away by how good the performance and songwriting was on this album and still have not heard them top it since.<BR>If you love metal then this is a must own. This was metal's political album of the '80s with strong messages that made you think. Although with this album it was the start of their commercial success, it shouldn't be labled as a sellout album.<br />Songwriting like this is surely missed by diehard Metallica fans and Metal fans alike.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Wow. Haunting melodies, amazing lyrics, raw emotion: Radiohead have it all. Instead of taking the 90s britpop guitar band route, Radiohead have created an album that is innovative, inspirational and groundbreaking. Although criticized as &quot;weird&quot; by most of the mass media both in England and I expect worldwide, I honestly believe that Thom Yorke is a genius, musically and politically. Great left-wing take on MI6 etc. and Tony Blair (listen to &quot;You and Whose Army?&quot; on Amnesiac - a completely underrated album).... Buy this album, and take some time to listen to it on repeat. It will blow you away.
B00005AREQ|5.0|Given the already vast number of 5-star reviews for this recording which generally echo my sentiment towards this masterpiece, I will simply add that I highly recommend Jeff Beck's \\"Blow by Blow\\" to anyone who wants to make a seemless transition from the world of pop/rock to that of jazz, and instrumental music in general. Growing up I was raised on top 40, funk, and rock, and found it difficult at first to appreciate music that was made for the sake of music (as opposed to social/political agendas, club dancing, making $$$ for music execs, rebelling against parents, etc.). But \\"Blow by Blow\\", along with Coltrane's \\"Giant Steps\\" and Miles Davis's \\"Kind of Blue\\" sent me in the direction I was looking for. For me \\"Blow by Blow\\" represented everything I enjoyed about rock (soloing, improvisation, the drums/guitar/bass/keyboard paradigm) with most of the nonsense (the howls, rants, and raves of lead singers, cliche lyrics, monotonous rhythms, and clownish attire) discarded. Moreover, Beck's guitar work on this recording pretty much closed the books on Jazz fusion as people had perceived it back then, simply because he did it all on that one record! It would take other musical geniuses, e.g. (Pat Metheny & Lyle Mays,<BR>and Weather Report) to expand jazz in different directions.
0671045865|4.0|This book was like a breath of fresh air after reading Dreamcatcher. The plot is very simple: a survival story about a little girl lost in the woods scared to death and she's looking for her mom and brother and finds them at the end of the book. King manages to avoid the psychological babbling of his recent books but still pull you in with well developed characters.<br />In this story a little nine year old girl must battle the elements, her fear of a stalking creature, and the deterioration of her body and senses.<br />This book is not meant to scare you into the wee hours of the night but it will keep you turning the pages just the same. King makes you care about this girl and whether or not she will survive, which makes it a given that she will (this isn't a Bachman novel). Knowing this doesn't take away from the intensity of her struggle.<br />I highly recommend this to Stephen King fans or anyone who loves a good read.
B00005ARDC|5.0|\\"When I heard them for the first time I got goose bumps and I thought: There's somebody on the right track.\\" - Noel Gallagher of Oasis.  He is absolutely correct.  This record is filled to the brim with proper music.  It is about time that there was an American band that finally makes listenable music.  Unfortunately is is drowned out by System of a Down, Likin Park, and other awful music on American radio.  If you want to hear good lyrics, great guitar riffs, and just memorable rock music, BUY THIS!!!
B00004VVN9|4.0|Is this a great film?  No, let me say that is a great concept, truly stretches ones imagination, and it is a good film.  The concept is wonderful, although the film itself leaves you just tantalizingly short of where it could have gone.<br />The basic premise is a scientific discovery where a person's thoughts, emotions, and experiences can be captured on &quot;tape&quot;, recorded, and then experienced by someone else by simply playing the tape.  The concept is fascinating.  While the special effects are excellent for a film this old, the most powerful scenes for me were the depictions of a couple on the verge of divorce getting to experience the other's perspective of shared events. The experience of seeing themselves and their behavior though the other's eyes changes their relationship forever.  This aspect of the concept is not played out as fully as it could be.<br />This film is also the last movie of Natalie Wood, who died tragically during the production of the movie.  Christopher Walken is excellent as the lead actor.<br />The ending of the film touches on something so fascinating that they simply couldn't pull it off.  Overall, I recommend this movie, as a fascinating concept that will leave you thinking after the film is over.  Always a sign that the movie is worth watching.
B00005JKJA|5.0|-- this film is about how all dreams come true in Hollywood ... unfortunately.

630522577X|5.0|When cinephiles go to heaven, most will rush straight for the projection room screening the original cuts of 'The Magnificent Ambersons' and 'The Red Badge Of Courage'.  Of course, so will I , but first I'll take a peek at the 'restored' version of 'My Fair Lady', the one in which dubmeistress Marni Nixon's blandly functional singing is replaced by Audrey Hepburn's own, her limited, hesitent, fragile voice infinitely more moving and appropriate to her role as Eliza Doolittle, the flowergirl taken from the gutter by the gentleman-phonetician Henry Higgins, who places a bet with fellow linguist Colonel Pickering that he can pass her off as gentry at an Embassy Ball.  The true, tantalising joy of this DVD, surpassing anything in the film itself, is its footage of Audrey's audition singing, which was deemed inadequate for the soulless pageant planned by Jack Warner, but now quivering with all the haunted pathos, yearning, grace, wit and rapture of which only Audrey was capable.  Although I think it is more defensible thematically and visually than its detractors allow, 'Lady' would still be a mechanical bore were it not for the performance of Audrey.  Famously and contentiously, Julie Andrews, the original stage Eliza, was dropped because she wasn't a star name, and even today, many regret that decsion.  But 'Lady' moves precisely because it is an Audrey Hepburn picture, one of those duckling-blooming-into-duchess roles essential to her.  Andrews may have been broadly convincing as a Cockney guttersnipe, but there is no way she could have pulled off the regal elegance required for part two.  Because director Cukor rightly disdains realism, it doesn't matter that Audrey's impersonation of a Cockney is a failure - what matters is that the audience knows the actress is the acme of aristocratic refinement, and is willing to undergo the exquisite torture of seeing those precious features and that precious voice grotesquely distorted for the ephiphanic pleasure of seeing themas if rising from the dead.  The fact that Audrey's own beautiful English was inflected by her Dutch background gives her a 'foreigness' that further adds to her alienation.  And Andrews could never have captured the sadness or vulnerabilty that lay just beneath Audrey's self-possessed chic, qualities that see Shaw's brittle comedy crack into tragedy - witness her appearance on top of Higgins' stairs on the night of the ball, in off-white and noose-like pearls, descending with all the melancholic majesty of a dying swan, donning a clostral velvet cape as if condemning herself to a nunnery.  After the broad pantomime of the Covent Garden sequences and the rollicking celebrations around 'The Rain In Spain', the contrast is almost too much to bear, and Higgins' once hysterical jibes wound like the most brutal of blows.<br />'Lady' is dismissed by 'serious' film fans as the last lumbering dinosaur of an already fossilised studio system.  Certainly, the film is a failure as a musical - I don't believe for a moment the legendary Herme Pan had anything to do with the stillborn choreography; and the the switches from drama to music are ungainly.  Any attempt to frame complex shots or even move the camera seem to have been blocked by the heavy decor.  Viewed as a George Cukor film, however, and 'Lady' is a triumph.  It is a film that insists upon its own rigid artifice and theatricality (brilliantly freezing into anti-illusionistic tableaux, or breaking into undiegetic choral commentary) to recreate a social system in which human beings ossified like mannequins, or mummies in a museum; the construction of all human interaction ('language', class, gender) is meticulously analysed.  For all its lavish production values, this is not a film to wallow in - it has a hard, flat, stark, grey, often ugly look.  The cold, Higgins-like brilliance of Shaw's only readable play is tempered by the humanising of Eliza, while the cultural milieu from which it sprang is contextualised to addlayers of meaning - Holmes is like Sherlock Holmes, an eecentric bachelor genius with slightly dimmer sidekick and loyal housekeeper, who can 'read' the unmanagable city and its inhabitants by (verbal) clues; like a HG Wells mad professor, he uses the latest scientific gadgetry in his 'laboratory' to create a new human being; the relationship between Higgins and Pickering has all the epigrammatic homosociability of Wilde, while the presence of the Transylvanian Queen and predatory males invokes another fellow Irishman, Bram Stoker.  In fact, it is only when unalloyed Shaw intrudes - for instance Alfred Doolittle's tiresome paradoxes about 'middle-class morality' - that the film threatens to stall.  Perhaps the real subject of the film, cued in the budding flowers of the opening titles, is Eliza's sexuality, potentially deviant and disruptive, and often suspect to accusations of vice, which must be controlled for more 'respectable' barter.   She is a kind of wild child, an animalistic savage who must be 'tamed' by benevolent Imperialists like the gentleman scholar and the Raj officer.<br />Alan Jay Lerner's unfailingly witty book is a vast improvement on the original, and the songs are such a delight that straight filming of the musical would be pleasure enough.  Each character and mood has its own type of music - Higgins declaims in Gilbert&Sullivan-type patter-song, especially in those two classes of misogyny 'But Let A woman In Your Life...' and 'Why Can't A Woman Be More Like A Man'; Alfred's Victorian working-class pub singalongs; Freddie's sappy operetta; and, most treasurably, Eliza's lyric rapture, soaring with 'I Could Hae Danced All Night', curdling into the Grand Guignol of 'Just You Wait, 'enry 'iggins', in which she fantasises murdering her tormentor.
0812550757|5.0|Orson Scott Card's riveting sequel to Ender's Game reveals the volatility of a society that has been stretched to accept a frightening species.  Speaker for the Dead continues the life of Ender Wiggin to a time when he now has three names.  As Ender once told the story of the Buggers, the first known alien species, he is now in search of the next story to write as the Speaker for the Dead.  A second alien species arises and an extreme tension forms between them and the humans.  Ender finds himself in the thick of the situation and must cover his own past lest the people who he wants to help would push him away.<BR> Speaker for the Dead is an intense roller-coaster ride.  Knowing Ender's inner torment when it comes to alien species, the reader connects with his very mind.  Astounded by his unfailing power to heal the people around him with words of truth, the reader gasps for breath, because they can find the same desires in their own lives.  Card convinces the reader that these characters exist and the emotions are real.  You want to turn the pages faster than humanly possible, but you never want the story to end.  Card is a genius of communication.  The complexities of the conversations wind around a corner, to another planet, climb a tree, and ensnare irony after irony.  To view a speaking from above a page is to sit in the audience and listen as Ender reveals your life story in public, <BR>your best and worst moments.  Though you feel your soul has been torn out and displayed on a pole, you have never felt more relief in your life.<BR>       Card has eclipsed pure human feeling.  I can't describe how absolutely awesome this novel is, because I was not given the gift of writing as Card obviously was.  By the time the reader finishes this novel they have become a different person, have questioned their opinions of reality, and have tried to grasp what initiative they would take if they had to deal with a new species of alien.
B00001OH7U|5.0|Bowie recorded this album [and]claims not to remember it. I kind of believe him, but if I were him, I'd \\"remember\\" this album and forget \\"Never Let Me Down\\". This is a fantastic album. It's not exactly mainstream seventies, but thats a good thing. The title track is absolutely with out a single doubt probably the best song in Bowie's repetoire. Sure, it makes little or no sense, but face it, little of Bowie's songs do. The rest of the tracks aren't nearly as strong as the title track, but believe me, they are good. I demand that you purchase this if you have any interest in nonmainstream pop. You'll enjoy it.
B00005JKJA|4.0|Great movie, but a quick warning for buyers of the DVD -- the region 1 copy I have doesn't have chapters. Seems like Lynch has stipulated that the whole movie is done in one chapter.<br />Annoying really, because I'd love to be able to skip to scenes like Club Silencio. I guess Lynch only wanted people to watch the movie from start to finish. I still don't think that's a good reason to ignore the benefits that DVDs can provide in terms of chapter skipping.
0684833395|5.0|It's difficult to write anything meaningfully different about Catch-22 that hasn't already been written.  Rather than attempt that, I'll offer my personal experience with this book.  I first read it as a teenager, in the mid-1970s. I'd read MASH (Hooker) before reading Catch-22 and was much more impressed with that book (and television series) than I was with Heller's work.  Catch-22, I thought, was a part of the same genre: smart-ass anti-war books.  It was funny, but bogged down in places and at times simply bored me - the whole bit with Milo Minderbinder, for example.  And Major Major was a one-note gag that I quickly dismissed.  To be honest, the part of the book that stuck with me throughout the years was Yossarian's having written, \\"I yearn for you tragically. A.T. Tappman, Chaplain, U.S. Army,\\" and the first two lines of the book.<br />Fast forward to now - 2002: I'm in my early forties and, it is to be hoped, somewhat wiser and more experienced.  For no good reason I've decided to re-read the book (I happened upon it in the back of a closet while looking for another book).  A few pages in, I couldn't believe how differently I saw the book, the characters and how differently I interpreted Heller's message.  After completing the book, I'd discovered that Heller hadn't written an anti-war book, or an anti-Army or anti-government book -- he's written an anti-institution book!  The experiences he recorded occur daily in numerous corporations, government bureaucracies, school systems, society -- any setting in which an individual is faced with his anonymity and utter replace-ability in an institution.  Major Major, far from being a one-gag joke, is the perfect archetype for the well-meaning mid-level functionary who finds himself powerless to affect change and simply chooses to operate \\"below the radar,\\" as they say, biding his time and trying to avoid being noticed until he's retired.  Milo Minderbinders really do get ahead, and Lieutenant Scheisskopfs  really get promoted to the top through no effort of their own!  <br />Yossarian was the main character of the book, but the true hero was Orr, who'd figured everything out and used the system to break free.  He left tracks for Yossarian to follow, and, we can hope, Yossarian made it past Nately's whore to freedom as well.  And, after all these years, I can understand the first two lines of the book.<br />A few random musings:  One - Having just seen the series finale to The X-Files, I'm struck by the correctness of fit between the two universes.  Two - I bought a paperback edition of this book (Dell) in 1979.  It is the same book I just finished re-reading, yellowed and somewhat aged, but otherwise in good condition.  Quite a contrast to the novel (Time-Warner) I picked up last month that literally falls apart page by page as I read it.
B00005OAIE|4.0|I'm mostly an R&B fan, but I dig John Mayer.  He's a soulful singer, he's got mad lyrics, and a great command for melody.  I bought the CD on the strength of the single \\"No Such Thing\\" that I saw on VH1.  It reminded me of a throwback to the 70s (either Steely Dan, or Gerry Rafferty (\\"Baker Street\\") ).  <br />Most people compare him to Dave Matthews, but I think he's a better singer, and the melodies on this CD are stronger than those on Matthews' last effort.  I think my favorite song on the CD is \\"City Love\\", which has some great instrumentation, a nice bluesy guitar solo and and some fantastic transitions, not to mention lyrics that paint a perfect mental picture of what's going on with Mayer and his \\"City Love\\".<br />All in all, a great, first effort. I'm definitely going to check him out live if he comes back to L.A. this summer....
0767817710|4.0|This is the sort of movie that strikes you as just plain odd when you first see it (fairly typical of Raimi flicks, really). But also typical of Raimi flicks, this film rewards you the more you watch it.<br />Everything in this film (with the possible exception of the Swedish gunslinging champ Gutzon) is an archetype from the movie Western: Gene Hackman as Herod is as evil as anyone could be; Russel Crowe as Cort, the gunslinger-turned-preacher; Leonardo DiCaprio as The Kid--every fast talking quick-draw teen; Lance Henriksen is Ace, the fame-seeking showman; and on and on, down to the blind shoeshine boy, the bartender, the undertaker, and the grizzled ol' doc. <br />And then, into this mix, they throw The Man With No Name--in this case a woman, Sharon Stone. She rides into town looking for vengeance but she doesn't have the squinty-eyed serenity of a Clint Eastwood. She has a desperate, feminine quality. In-between her world-weary cynicism is a kind of innocence, fear, self-doubt, self-loathing--things far out of the usual band of emotions for a spaghetti western.<br />And all these characters are played straight, with no winking at the camera, no self-referential humor, nothing. In the hands of a more pedestrian director, it probably would have come off as a movie-of-the-week feminist statement about empowerment or something.<br />Instead, we have Sam Raimi, and in his hands, well, we have something completely different. In his hands, the genre itself becomes a character: zooms, close-ups, long-shots from boot level, bullet-cams, and myriad other dizzying techniques that result in a western like no other.<br />Ultimately we end up with a film that blurs the edges which, to my mind, explains the tepid reception this film got (and continues to get from some) in the USA. We like our Westerns to be Westerns. If it's going to break genre conventions, we want something like \\"Unforgiven\\", where it still more-or-less looks like any other Western, but gives us some unusual content.<br />So if you're just an average movie-goer looking for an average Western, this probably isn't the film for you. If you're a film fan, though, this is a must-see.
0380789035|5.0|I read a lot of books, but still it is rare to come across a gem as fine as this one.  Even as a longtime Gaiman fan, I was impressed with how good American Gods turned out to be.  Mr. Gaiman has proven once again his deserved reputation as a master craftsman in the art of storytelling.<br />To say I couldn't put this book down is a pale and inadequate compliment.  To experience American Gods felt less like reading a book, than stumbling across a canteen of pure, cold water when dying of thirst in the desert - I gulped it down in great, greedy gulps, and at the end felt satisfied, yet still craved for more.<br />I heartily recommend this book to anyone who feels that storytelling is a kind of magic, who enjoys exploring the dark side of good things and the good side of dark things, and who, on top of all that, wants a rollicking good read.  Thank you, Mr. Gaiman.
0446677450|5.0|Robert T. Kiyosaki knocks one out of the park with this stellar book about how we think about money.  While many of Mr. Kiyosaki's ideas have been around for a while (Ayn Rand is the first one to come to mind), this is the most readable and actionable format I have seen.  <br />In short, the author takes us through the thoughts and actions of two men of influence in his early development.  One (his father) is a well educated man who struggles to make and keep money.  The second (his friends father) is a moderately educated man who understands money.  As we watch the lessons from both father's we see ourselves and our potential.<br />I found that this book has a number of life applications.  One word of caution: if you are looking for specific business advice, this book may not be for you.  RDPD will provide a thoughtful argument about what your true future may be.

It is too US centric, with little regard for Japan and only very occasional mentions of Europe. The book is also a history of the industry and has should perhaps be titled The Ultimate History of the Video Game Industry as there is little description of most of the games. The book could also be expanded in scope to include PC, Amiga, Atari ST and C64 games. These games are a major part of the history of games and to not mention them leaves a big gap in what is otherwise a very comprehensive book. <BR><br /><BR>But, all in all the book is a great read and should contain interesting information for readers casually interested in the games industry and even experts who will no doubt find out something new.
0670824399|5.0|I´m out of the country with my 6 years old daughter for a week. When we travel together we always bring enough reading stuff, and our main book this time is Matilda - a fantastic book about a fantastic girl. I have read all of the Roald Dahl books for my kids several time, Matilda has always been and still is my favorite :-)<br />Matilda is a small girl with extraordinary talents. Already when she is three years old she starts visiting the local library and reads all the books there, starting with the children´s books, keeping on with the world classics. Matilda´s parents are very neglective, and refuse to see any of Matilda´s talents. But Matilda is a fighter and finds her own very creative and very funny ways to get revenge.<br />Matilda is a funny book, showing a girls fight for her individuality, in a typical RoaldDahlish way. I love it, and all my kids have loved it as well. My youngest daughter is only six, and should be a little too young for the book. But still the book works perfectly for her. The chapters are quite long, but none of us manage to stop after just one chapter. Being on holiday, we can sleep long in the mornings, and can read for a long time in the evenings.<br />An extra pluss with the book is all the fantastic recommandations of future books it gives us. Dahl has made a wonderful list of the books Matilda read at the library.<br />Britt Arnhild Lindland
B0000508U6|5.0|'Parachutes' is hauntingly beautiful music, to say the least!  In fact, this release, and 'After Everything Now This' by The Church, are the 2 most touching and stylistically beautiful sublime releases i've heard in a long time!  If you are dissapointed with today's music scene in general, and feel that there is not much quality music being composed, you MUST check these two out.  They are highly musical, highly emotional, and highly gorgeous!  'Parachutes' and 'After Everything Now This' by The Church are incredible.  If you are into 'Radiohead', check out these two and expand your horizons some more.
6300184080|5.0|One of the best films of the 1980's, or anytime. Wonderfully moving true story of Rocky Dennis, a young man suffering from a disfiguring disease, and the immesurable courage he displayed. This film will make most of us, with our daily &quot;problems&quot;, feel like the superficial, shallow, self-pitying , contemptuous, overly image -conscious, ungrateful beings that some of us (I'm just as guilty) often are. Cher is miraculous in this film, playing the all too human, but ultimatley incredibly brave Rusty, Rocky's mother. She gives a performance that, in its' &quot;reality&quot;, is second to almost none of recent memory. Equally moving is Eric Stoltz as Rocky, the young man who does not let the cruelty that we humans sometimes inflict upon each other for being &quot;different&quot; get in the way of his experiencing the already elusive joys of life and love. His &quot;Rocky&quot; displays more courage, insight, and forgiveness than most of us could conjure up under the best of conditions. I truly feel the players were guided by the spirit of Rocky, and, in that, were dedicated in letting his incredible spirit and bravery  shine through, without them being overly self-absorbed about giving a great &quot;performance&quot;. And it shows, as here, they are all at their best.  Just a superb movie about a superb human being who wasn't here for long, but who's life taught many. I have actually popped in this film when feeling in need of an attitude adjustment after drowning in pools of self-pity. It always works. Try it the next time you're cursing the heavens for that zit on the end of your nose. Most movies are merely entertaining, at best.(Even that's becoming a rarity.) But it's not often that a movie is not only a flawlessly  crafted entertainment experience  but, also, a sometimes life altering lesson. &quot;Mask&quot; is such a film. You will be inspired by the noble life of Rocky Dennis... a BEAUTIFUL person.
B00005JLF5|5.0|Of all the Star Trek series I was most intrigued by ds9. I didn't start watching it untill its 5ft season, but i was able to see every episode on reruns before the series ended. The series had the most action out of any star trek series so far and the characters were easy to get to know. I would love to own the complete series on DVD, and i hope it is released soon.
B000000W6R|5.0|If there ever was a beautiful album this would be the one, it is marvellous from the beginning until the end. It is both entertaining and emotional with a mixture of maturity and youthfulness that will leave you begging for more when the music ends. Smashing Pumpkins represent the 90's and they demonstrated that there is more to life than Nirvana.
B000056MOD|5.0|When I first saw it at theaters I was disappointed with the ending. But when it came out to video. I was amazed that they changed the ending. Well not change but added a new part. The action was great and the actors did a great job especially Bruce Payne. I think he did a great performance playing Jacob Kell. If you haven't seen any of the Highlander films I recommend seeing all the films except Highlander 2 that made no sense at all. I still own it though but I leave it out of the series.
0812550706|5.0|This is the epitome of a science fiction novel.  Ender's game has everything a sci-fi reader could ever ask for. It combines the element of outer-space with the tecnology of the future.  We enjoyed this book because it caught your interest and you could not stop reading it. It had intense battles, in which the human race conquered the &quot;buggers&quot;.  The buggers are the alien race that tries to wipe out humanity. The main character Ender was the hero of the book, would he manage to save the humanity from the buggers.
B0000047CX|5.0|I must take exception to the reviewer who said that the cd had problems when played on older cd players.  I have an old Sony player from about 1986, and it plays just fine on it.  His other reviews also complained about the quality of other recordings, so I must wonder if the problem isn't in his stereo equipment.<BR>But back to the cd.  I found the original album in a stack of old records my father had, put it on the turntable, and immediatly fell in love with it.  About a week later, I was shopping for CD's in a store when the cd caught my eye.  I almost jumped into the bin to grab it.  This is without a doubt one of the best jazz albums ever.  The music is haunting, and will get into your blood.  I had thought Charlie Parker was the best jazz saxophone player, but after hearing this album, I would have to put Getz into the running right along with him.  If you enjoy listening to jazz music, you will not be disappointed in this cd.  Even the liner notes are well done, and have additional material along with the notes that came with the LP.  The bonus tracks also add to the quality of this cd.  You will get your money's worth!  Not to mention the romantic effects of the music...
0812550706|5.0|Ender's Game was an excellent book!  Orson Scott Card goes to distant measures and makes a master-mind type of a book.  Six year old Andrew Wiggin (also known as Ender given to him by his sister Valentine) is a mastermind genius among genius.  He goes to Battle School to be trained to control Earth's fleet against the alien creature &quot;Buggers&quot; who have already attacked earth twice devastating the human race.... <br />the book was an excellent book written with creativity, Orson did an excellent job!!
6305648522|5.0|This film is a timeless tale of a beautiful friendship, but it is never corny or trite.  It perfectly captures small town life in rural Sicily, but it could be set anywhere.  I have seen it about 300 times(I've lost count), having shown it to students and even to my fianc.  The guys like it so much they seem not to mind the subtitles!  I will never tire of this movie.  It is one that everyone should see.
0060934913|4.0|I could not put this down - I was giggling and snorting like a madwoman as I read this on the plane.  Anthony Bourdain's sardonic no-apologies style kept me on the edge of hysterics, disgust, starvation and food-gasm throughout the book.  If you love food - not dining, not frou-frou, but FOOD - you have to read this book.

B00004Y6O7|4.0|Some critics refer to this as Van Halen's \\"darkest\\" album, and there are definitely a few songs that have a bit of moodiness to them (\\"Mean Street\\", \\"Push Comes To Shove\\", \\"Sunday Afternoon In The Park/One Foot Out The Door\\"), but the rest of it is pretty typical feelgood Van Halen rock. The \\"dark\\" songs were probably a calculated move by the band after the party rock vibe of their first two albums and the wild experimentation of \\"Women & Children First\\". <br />All the songs are quite good. It gets weird around the time of the frenetic synth-enhanced medley of \\"Sunday Afternoon In The Park/One Foot Out The Door\\", but I still found those songs more interesting than some of the ones that only tended to be cut from the same cloth as the old albums (\\"Sinner's Swing!\\", \\"'Dirty Movies'\\").<br />This is easily VH's weakest-selling effort, and it's not that surprising considering \\"Unchained\\" is pretty much the only song from it that still gets significant airplay, and it wasn't nearly as commercial as previous hits like \\"Jamie's Cryin'\\" or \\"Dance The Night Away\\". \\"So This Is Love?\\" and \\"Mean Street\\" got played heavily back in the day, but you rarely hear either one anymore. <br />I personally would recommend this album over \\"Van Halen II\\" and most anything from the Hagar & Cherone years (except \\"5150\\", the best album they ever did in any incarnation). And I find myself listening to it more often than either \\"Van Halen\\" or \\"1984\\" simply because unlike those two, it hasn't been beaten to death on the radio. Essential for the completist, but a darn fine album in its own right!
0821221841|5.0|Ansel Adams is indeed one of the most highly regarded photographers ever, and in this first of three instructional books, he reveals much of the foundational wisdom that he gathered over a lifetime taking pictures. The focus of this book is the camera and deals with all types and formats of film cameras and techniques for using them to take wonderful photos. <br />This book is one of the most common and cherished textbooks used in beginning photography but is indispensable for any interested in better understanding camera arts.
0679721037|5.0|This book is very emotional, saddening and agonizing book about one of the worst chapters in our history. This book opened my eyes to the things that went on in Hiroshima at the time of the atomic bombing. How the people were affected and how devastating the bombing was. The book describes not only the people's actions, but also their emotions. If i did not read this book, i would still see the A-bombing on Hiroshima as just a terrible thing that happened and would still only see through the pictures in our history textbook.<br />Everyone should read this book whether they are interested in the A-bomb or not, because this book will open your eyes to the power of human beings to kill and destroy everything around us. Hiroshima is one of the most influential book that I have ever read.
B000060P79|5.0|All the songs on this cd are great, my personal favorite is adicted. I was addicted to the song since i first heard it. All of there songs are catchy and you will want to hear them over and over again. Any fan of punk bands like good charlotte and blink 182 should buy this cd.
B00004XQ83|5.0|This CD has single handily revived a long overdue interest in American roots music and WITHOUT the benefit of radio airplay.  Commercial radio has gotten so scared of its own shadow that anything with any depth, soul, no passion is passed over for a handful of &quot;songs&quot; that all sound alike.  Buy this and take part in the revolution!
0425173755|5.0|In Murder on the Orient Express (or Murder on a Calais Coach, whichever you prefer), Agatha Christie once more succeeds in building an apparently inexplicible case and then blowing all your theories to pieces with a simple explanation that you never would have suspected.  In fact, in this book, Agatha Christie breaks one of the most obvious rules of murder mysteries.  What rule is this?  If I tell you, it will give away the ending.  If you like this book, try reading The Murder of Roger Ackroyd and And Then There Were None.  And if you liked those books, you'll surely enjoy Murder on the Orient Express.
0792841344|4.0|He is truly eternal. He is the tallman. When watching this DVD, I could not help but think how cool the tallman is. This is not really a very scary movie. But its slick. Its stylish. Its icy cool. After viewing some of the extras on the disc (and their are quite a few) its interesting to see how different Angus scrimm is from his Tallman Character. I was expecting some grim, downcast grouch who was embarrased to be typecast as this tallman. Instead he revels in it. Oh well. Very enjoyable and a worhty DVD release.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|From the creation of up-and-coming director/writer Richard Kelly, DONNIE DARKO is the brilliantly bizarre story of a young man who is far from normal.<br />Donald Darko (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) is a troubled high school with an intelligent, but cursed, mind. He is depressed, on medication, and likes to voice his opinions without any regrets. One night, he is visited by a monstrous, 6-foot tall, rabbit named Frank. Frank has come to Donnie, from an unknown dimension, to deliver a terrifying message: 'In 28 days, the world will end...'.<br />What follows is an absolutely incredible movie that, unfortunately, did not get very much notice or publicity. DARKO is truly one of the best films I have seen in a VERY long time. Kelly has filled his story to the top with twists, turns, and enough dazzling images to last a lifetime.<br />Jake Gyllenhaal (OCTOBER SKY) is extraordinary as the title role. You can tell, just by observing his performance, that he is aware of what acting is really made of. He is backed by a stellar ensemble cast, including Jena Malone (STEPMOM), Drew Barrymore (RIDING IN CARS WITH BOYS), Mary McDonnell (DANCES WITH WOLVES), Patrick Swayze (GHOST), Noah Wyle (TVs &quot;ER&quot;), and even real-life sister, Maggie Gyllenhaal (HOMEGROWN)!<br />In conclusion, if you are ready to take a psychological roller-coaster ride into a dark universe, look no further than DONNIE DARKO!<br />Rating: A+!
B00005QIPH|2.0|Y'know, no matter how often rock critics mention The Strokes in the same breath as the MC5, The Stooges, The Kinks, or Television, I just can't get over how unbelievably wimpy this band is. Honestly, they have much more in common with Phil Collins or Bread. This is sleepy time college rock for those who want something just slightly heavier than Belle and Sebastian. <br />Those who bought this album also shopped for NyQuil.
0345440900|2.0|Being a first time mother, this book made me paranoid and anxious when none of the author's advice seemed to apply or work for my newborn son.  I ended up ignoring everything she said about feeding and getting babies to sleep.  I had to feed every hour and a half; I let him fall asleep immediately after feeding (it's the natural thing for newborns to do!); I rocked him to sleep.  The claim that you have to start as you mean to go on is a little ridiculous - despite doing all the things I wasn't supposed to do because it would result in bad habits and problems later, my baby doesn't snack but has proper meals; he doesn't need to nurse to go to sleep; he can fall asleep by himself.  At three months old he is starting to fall into a more predictable routine - partly because he is older and becoming more settled, and partly because I am trying to guide him into one.  Newborns do not have a routine from the first week - ask any mother you know and she will agree (all the ones I talked to say the first three months are the hardest!).  If you are a new mother, don't read this book until your baby is older - or better yet, read it knowing that all of this is a few months off but this is what you should be striving for.  Also, her breastfeeding advice for single sided feeding is plain wrong.  If you follow what she says, your baby may only get half the amount of food he needs and will be malnourished.  She does make good points - closely observe your baby to see what he is telling you, having a routine makes interpreting his cues a lot easier, and don't help your baby if he doesn't need your help falling/going back to sleep.
0062502182|5.0|The author has shown us in this book that you don't have to know a lot of things to live your dream ... all you have to do is look inside yourself and everything will be shown through your surrondings. Everything in this book revolves around that priniciple and by the end of the book, you would want to try it out too!
0804102988|5.0|Rutherford's best -- a complete and compelling history of a special part of England's landscape.  Fascinating!
0446310786|5.0|No matter how often I read it, about once every 3 to 5 years, it gives me great pleasure!  I think everyone wishes that the author would write another book.  It is so well construed, good sentences, excellent plot, reader easily gets right inside the place as well as the characters' feelings.
0385335482|4.0|Even though this book is 'fiction', I feel asthough Sophie Kinsella has read my mind! I read \\"Shopaholic\\" over a weekend, and I never laughed more! It's a fun read, especially if you have had problems controlling spending. The subject, Becky Bloomwood, seems so hapless you just keep rooting for her. At times you also may wish to smack her, for seeming lack of sense....but haven't we all 'been there'? I highly recommend this.
076781214X|5.0|Kathleen Turner gives an enchanting performance in Francis Ford Coppola's delightful &quot;what if?&quot; fable PEGGY SUE GOT MARRIED.<br />Peggy Sue (Turner) is a disillusioned woman when she attends her high school reunion.  Having just divorced her high school sweetheart (Nicolas Cage), and life, it seems, can't get worse.  Faced with her old self, the old &quot;if I knew then what I know now&quot; idea comes into play, and when she is crowned Queen of the Reunion, she suddenly collapses and awakens as her teenaged self, back in high school.<br />Peggy both relishes and reviles the new choices she makes in her old life.  Barbara Harris (FREAKY FRIDAY, FAMILY PLOT) has an all-too-brief role as Peggy's mother, and Catherine Hicks (TV's &quot;7th Heaven&quot;) is luminous.<br />The DVD includes the trailer.
0671027344|5.0|I love this book. I have read it twice.  It is funny and a little depressing at the same time. It makes you think. Its just a great book and i recomend it for everyone.
B0000668IF|2.0|Moby used to rock my world.  I have always admired him for his restless, shifty approach to music.  From the churning/industrial of Animal Rights to the pure dance/guilty pleasure of Everything is Wrong, there has always been a reason to like Moby's work.  <br />That is, until now.  Moby has, ahem, let me down.  This album starts off with one decent cut (lead-off single \\"We Are All Made of Stars\\") then flat-lines for an hour.  Seventeen tracks later, I was glad it was over, sadly.<br />Moby seems to be trying too hard to appeal to the masses, offering a rap cut (\\"Jam for the Ladies\\"), ambient keyboard drones for the trippy youngsters, and more gospel goodness a-al-Play (almost every other cut here).  If only Moby had come up with a few decent melodies or riffs, the album might stick... but nothing here comes faintly close to memorable.<br />But I'm sure the MTV generation will soak this album up.  Repeated, formulaic keyboard melodies; generic, dated beats; stupid, patronizing lyrics, and plenty of \\"guests\\" to voice them for Moby (when his own voice is splendid!)... <br />But like most widely hailed music lately, no soul to be found.
B000060P79|5.0|I recently discovered this band on the compilation cd &quot;Atticus Dragging the Lake&quot; by SideOneDummy Records, and I instantly fell in love with them.  They have a mild punk sound, similar to Sugarcult or Good Charlotte, and AMAZING vocals.  I can't stop listening to their new cd, and I highly recommend it to anyone!
B0000026NC|1.0|I hope Gilmour ceases to exist real soon before Pink Floyd is forever [drained] dry of all its former greatness. If you like this you should check out The Band without Robbie Robertson or Little Feat without Lowell George...or how about that Beatles single that came out long after Lennons death. oh, by the way, Rick Wright has given up playing keyboards at this point but he looks good in the band photo. Have fun, sheep!
B00003W8NM|5.0|This movie and its DVD rocks.  The film underwent pre-release bashing because of what money groveling, humorless, I wouldn't know art if it was hanging on a wall in front of me people expect from a Hollywood production these days.  Well, Fight Club is probably one of the best movies of all time.  It contains such a deliciously warped cleverness most mistake it for anything but what it really is; a dark comedy.  The performances are excellent from all cast members.  The direction absolutely perfect, the writing... every damn thing about Fight Club is right on the money.  The best thing about this film is the soul it has, for as much violent content as is shown the themes expressed are that of living and enjoying life.  What's cooler than that?  Not much I've seen in too many movies in the past couple of years.  The DVD is super-terific with cool packaging, tons of extras and state of the art sound/picture quality.  A great product all around, perfect for Jack's DVD collection.
B000002B35|1.0|Let us know how shallow you are! Tell us how much you enjoy this nostalgia fest. The leader of this band was not even in the original group but he gets to plaster the name on any album he wants to make. Just don't expect the fat geezer to write any new songs. 100 years from now Pink Floyd will still be performing. Maybe the future line up can do a gig on David Gilmours grave sight. That would be way cool. I hope they play Money.
B00005JKED|5.0|This movie is the hottest of the year.This movie was a great way for Denzel to show his real talent.He took on a role that is totaly different from any other he has done.Hawk also had an alstar act in the movie.If you like any gangster movies and/or drug movies you will love this.If you like this you should check out the movie Colors. Peace.

Then I came down off the acid.
0790729725|5.0|This is ranked as first or second best gangster movie ever.DeNiro,Pesci, and Liotta all had alstar performances. This is a hard core gangster flick. It is a most have for any Mob or gangster fan.They have the best cast that they could for this movie.Peace
B00004TH83|4.0|I on the other hand, prefer her newest tracks written &amp; sung in Spanish. Like the song &quot;Quedate.&quot; The first time I heard it on the brazilian soap opera, &quot;El Clon&quot;. . . I said to myself I have to find out who sings that song! I agree she sings 10 times better than Celine. My question is when is she coming out with a CD in Spanish?
0783225970|5.0|Scarface is the best gangster flick that i have ever seen.Pacino had an excellent performance as the untouchable ruthless gangster Tony Montana...He goes from the bottom to the top in a short period of time.But he messes up.

6303832563|5.0|Well, I must get on the bandwagon of 5 starz yeasayers on this generally overlooked, unique, and unsung hero of the otherwise vast film wasteland.  The perfect example of pictures being worth a thousand words; a million in this case.<br />I first saw Koyaanisqatsi on a local PBS station, and also borrowed a copy (tape) from my local library (I believe they still possess it).  I have picked up both the vinyl and c-disc versions of the Glass soundtrack music.  Being a superhype standing alone; the score coupled with the in-your-face documentary images of the film together produce a transcendental experience.  Figuring that the length of the film is only 87 minutes, we feel as if we've witnessed a full-blown epic-length opus.<br />I was elated to see so many high-praise reviews from the Amazon faithful.  Since I'm 118th, there isn't much else I can add to what's already been pointed out.  Maybe movie retailers should peruse all this testimony, then smarten up and (re)-release this specimen of organic social comment on all available media.
B00005QHPQ|4.0|The beauty about Enrique is the massive improvement he has gone through since his first album. I have been a huge fan of his father for years and so when I heard Enrique was recording, it brought overwhelming amounts of joy. In so much as the Iglesias name will continue to generate music for more and more generations to come. <BR>Admittedly I didn't take well to his first 2 albums, his 3rd was a lot better. Then he catapulted with Balamos!! Huge!! Now he's finding his step and crusing forward. This is an album which will do well. I suppose that only down side is that the Latin feeling has almost gone. But being Enrique, it is in his blood so it will always be there. Like all Iglesias music, I can never get enough and am always looking forward to the next album. I look forward to being involved with his music.
6301972139|4.0|This film is a wonderful minor classic: great atmosphere, solid production values, and certainly well-acted. The film is among the many that cause me to wonder why it is not yet available in the DVD format.
B00000J2PH|5.0|If you want to give your children the gift of music, introduce them to Tapestry. <BR>I spent the summer on a road trip with my children - ages 10, 12, and 14 - and Tapestry was our favorite CD. We'd put it in and start singing at the top of our lungs! They are as familiar with her songs as I was 30 years ago - the music still sounds fresh and inspiring and comfortable. <BR>If you haven't listened to Tapestry in years - listen to it now; it's as beautiful as ever!
B000066C1N|5.0|Wow! This album truly captures the spirit of a movie that was completley inspirational and uplifting, with music that is all about being free and being wild and being who you are... The lyrics are great, Bryan Adams has a voice that works wonderfuly with them, and the instrumentals (particularly the main theme) make me want to SOAR! It totally lifts me up just to listen to it. See the movie, and then buy the soundtrack!
B00005QB9A|5.0|This film is one of the most amazing films I have ever seen in my life. Im sure this movie is an unforgetable one and is a must to purchase. The director brings the movie together so brilliantly that you would-at point-believe it is true. The  amazing part, Tim Roth plays as the amazing piano player \\"1900\\", has touched everybodies heart in a different way. He plays the roll so natural that you would think he actually knows how to play the piano in real life. Tim Roth is an outstanding actor and all of his films must be watched. The most amazing part of this movie is when he challenged to a piano duel. The King of Jazz, known as \\"Jelly Roll Morton\\", hears of the amazing piano player, 1990, and decides to challenge him. I am not going to tell you anymore than that, I dont want to spoil the excitement! What are you waiting for, go ahead BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!

0671510991|5.0|Kissinger is a known proponent on the art of realpolitik. In this book, he makes a brilliant case on how such a policy can be made to work and in fact achieve peace. His narrative begins with the congress of Vienna (he does refer back to older concepts like raison 'd etat though) and ends in the present day. To me, the brilliance of this book lies in making history appear not as a dead collection of facts, but as a living process. In this process, the options available to each country and leader are listed, analyzed and evaluated. The actual choices made are then evaluted in the context of these. For example his commentary on how the impulsive personality of Napolean III led him to make inconsitent foreign policy choices leading to demise of French dominance of Europe, was quite brilliant.<br />Where I did find the book lacking was in Kissinger's lack of appreciation for third world aspirations. He blames US foreign policy makers for not supporting their European allies in propping colonialism. Anybody from the third world will tell you, that colonialism always considered exploitative in the third world, had lost all credibility by the 1950s. Not being seen to oppose this decaying and decrepit structure, the US would have lost all claims to world leadership. <br />By virtue of cultural and ethnic affinity, all Western countries including the US were already seen as proponents of colonialism. Even a neutral proposition would discredited the US completely in the third world. When the US supported Egypt against Israel, France and Britain in the war of 1956, that allowed it to retain enough equity in the region that allowed it to retain key allies like Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Morocco and in the future Egypt. And at the same time emerge as the leader of the democratic world by ensuring that France and Britain became second rate powers. A pure policy of realpolitik would see that this would be in US interest. Mr.Kissinger however laments their demise displaying a weakness -an emotional feeling for shared culural affinity with Europe. In this he is in contradiction with his own framework propounded elsewhere in the book. Given the overall intelligence of this book, I think this is a minor pecaddilo however
1587990717|4.0|I like Taleb's approach to survivorship bias of large populations. He discusses why some people get rich while other (seemingly competent) people do not get rich. I also like his discussion of the psychological barriers to probabilistic thinking (I suffer from it, I'm glad to hear a smart guy like him struggles with it too).<br />Rare and Unpredictable events can mediate outcomes in many systems including economic systems and trading. Taleb takes care to remind us of that and to suggest that noise, measurement error and (necessary) over simplification in model design of systems governed by many interacting factors means that predictions can be very wrong (albeit with low probability).<br />I liked the fact that he discussed this, he is likeable (a bit eccentric and borderline arrogant, with a love of classics, my kind of guy...). However, his book does not appear to give a clear cut strategy for dealing with \\"rare events\\". He appears to recommend a conservative what-if approach, but risk identification is not well covered. Rather than feeling that I can identify an approach to investing, the author has somehow made me uncertain that any approach can work (and I cannot identify an approach suggested by the author). The obvious strategies of hedging bets are discussed. Taleb seems capable of making a more quantitative discussion (perhaps he has other books that are worth looking at), if some models or additional approaches would have been provided, I would have given it the full 5 stars. Perhaps he means to say that a process rather than a static method is needed (much like Schneier describes in his book on computer security, \\"Secrets and Lies\\"),
B0000640SA|3.0|I love this movie!  It's one of the best movies I've seen in years.  I'm glad I waited awhile to buy it, because I hate buying a DVD and then having to buy a special edition with cooler features (like what happened with the Dogma DVD)  But before you buy this hear what I have to say!  IF YOU HATE PUZZLES DON'T BUY THIS DVD!!!!!!  Both discs are set up like a psychological test!  The first DVD is easy to figure out!  However the 2nd disc is flat out CONFUSING!!!!  Depending on how you answer the questions is how you get to your features!!!  If you answer one question wrong you can get sent right back to the main menu.  But to make matters WORSE NONE OF THE QUESTIONS HAVE RIGHT OR WRONG ANSWERS!!!!!  I'd advise everyone that wants this DVD to wait until someone on an<br />Easter Eggs site figures out the answers because you'll enjoy it alot more I promise.  However the movie kicks ass so if you enjoy watching Indy films at their best then this is one for you!!!!!  The movie in my opinion is 5 stars, but due to the difficulty of the DVD I'm giving it a 3.  Thank you for your time!!!!
6303471714|5.0|I used this video from 1994-1995 and with cutting down the garbage I ate, I lost 30 lbs and looked amazing.  Critics deemed it risky, unsafe...well I can tell you, it works, shows results immediately, and makes you feel so good.  You'll use muscles that never get used, and you'll see your body tightening up right away.  I started college and didn't keep up with the tape, and sadly lost all my hard work.  I'm back again, with little time, and little $ to join a gym, so I'm doing this tape again, but need to purchase a new one, the old one is worn out.

B00005V9L1|5.0|You can't get more surreal (unless you consider Linklater's \\"Waking Life\\" or Bunuel's \\"Le Chien Andalou\\") than Donnie Darko.  Elegantly crafted both in cinematography and definitely in script, this film includes not only strong acting but visceral chills in more than a few places ... and then adds dark humour on top of it all.  In my opinion, if a film brings you close to tears in laughter as well as in sympathy, it should rank among the highest in your collection.<br />Jena Malone (Gretchen) gives a smouldering angst-ridden performance alongside Jake Gyllenhaal .. who was also seen in Bubble Boy, which I do not recommend.  I've never seen Drew Barrymore act better.  Even the small roles were developed and meticulously acted, such as Cherita, and Donnie's sister.  All of them had motives and yearnings, which I long to see more in Hollywood.  The score is also a must-have, composed by Michael Andrews, and with a fabulous song by Gary Jules - cover of Tears For Fears - Mad World.  <br />This should be seen by everyone.
0380788624|3.0|I did enjoy this book, but Stephenson appears to revel in dissecting the intricacies of various subjects that don't seem to have any direct correlation with the story. I found this distracting.<br />Loads of neat detail for the tech-heads.<br />The book would have been just as effective at a manageable 500 pages.
0780625129|3.0|I did not see this movie until very recently, and had heard quite a bit about it from many colleagues and friends of mine.  So, indeed, I sat down to watch it with the expectation of being moved or struck by some conflicting theme that lay within the boiling heart of this movie with the tagline \\"Some Legacies Must End\\".  <br />I was disappointed, and would like to say why.  First of all, I can't malign Edward Norton.  I think that his performance is .. breathtaking, and certainly worth seeing the movie for.  Indeed, I don't say that one shouldn't see this movie.  However, and I won't give away the ending, it's not worth owning.  Edward Furlong was a welcome presence here, and one I hope to see more from - and I don't remember his name, but the large man who drove the bug truck - was wonderful.  I hated him every second.  <br />However, the plot was lacking.  There was no subtlety, and the characters seemed so one-sided as to almost be farcical ...types of actual people.  The point may have been, in this movie, to provide no subtlety, and to be violent with the plot and imagery, but I think some of that was lost in the intent.  The opening scenes were of a beach or an area like that, with waves slowly lapping in over the sands.  If that was meant to convey some great metaphor, I think I must have missed it.  Flashbacks in black-and-white seemed meaningful, and the character of Derek was intelligent as well as conflicted, but I didn't understand his metamorphosis, and I found it extremely hard to believe that his younger brother would simply .. alter his ways just like that.<br />All in all, I'd only give this movie the three stars on the basis of the strong, strong acting.  It's only missing the last two of plot and development.
B00005RY7X|5.0|This cd is one of the best cd's that I have bought in a long time.  Every song makes you want to get up and party extremely hard!  &quot;I Get Wet&quot; is definitely a must for any music fan.
B00004RFFS|5.0|I was a little wary about watching this movie. The book had been amazing, and I didn't want it ruined by a horrible movie. But this movie was perfect; it stayed true to the book, but not so much that it was boring to someone who had read the book. Tom Cruise did an excellent job of playing Lestat. He brought the character to life, from Lestat's mysterious anger at the world right down to his hysterical laughing fits. Brad Pitt also did a great job of portraying the sad and hopeless Louis. The best actor, I think, was the young Kirsten Dunst, who played the child vampire Claudia, a grown woman trapped in the body of a child.<BR> A basic summary of the movie for those of you who haven't read the book:<BR> The movie begins when Louis, a 200 year old vampire, is egged into telling the story before Louis was made a vampire. He recently lost his wife in childbirth, and has no hope left in life. He longs for death, and his wish is granted in a almost sadistically twisted way when a mysterious vampire, Lestat, gives him death by making him one of the undead. The rest of the movie tells Louis's story; the making of the child vampire Claudia, and their quest to Paris to find another of their kind.<BR> A warning: This movie is very graphic, and contains an explicit nudity scene. If you don't like blood, I wouldn't reccomend watching this!
B00005QFE5|5.0|I recently purchased the movie based on the reviews that I've read and found the movie to be great.  I watched it with my wife and she didn't like it at all, saying that the movie was too simple and there was hardly any dialog.  But that is the point of this movie, it was meant to be a simple story of young and innocent love.  It struck a chord with me that it reminded me of how I felt when I first fell in love.  And it warms my heart to know that there are many like me that enjoy a simple and well told story especially in the 21th century when things and lives are so complicated by necessity.
B000002KOY|5.0|rock albums of all time. Never gets old, the music is classic good rock. I love it and have always had a copy either in vinyl, tape or cd.  Crazy Horse at their best, with musicians who are still putting out good music (except for Danny Whitten of course.)  There are just times when I need to hear this cd. By all means, buy this cd.
B000001F45|3.0|Don't let the great Roger Dean cover fool you. These guys were never in the same league as another band that sported Dean covers back then (Yes). And granted, all the references to demons, wizards and magician's tends to get a little goofy (ala Spinal Tap). But there's no denying that songs like &quot;Sunrise,&quot; &quot;Blind Eye,&quot; &quot;Echoes In The Dark&quot; and &quot;Sweet Lorraine&quot; are GREAT TUNES. So don't waste your time trying to over-intellectualize these guys. They were the perfect hard rock band for 1972 (along with fellow Brits Deep Purple) and should definitely be listened to in the context of their time.
0786867973|5.0|I must say this is the first cookbook I have read from cover to cover!  Last week it was my evening reading!  I am always surprised when people say you can't actually make Nigella Lawsons recipe's!  I have never had trouble with the way the things turn out.  I made the recipe for Blueberry Muffins this weekend and they were less sweet than the American version.  At first bite I was not sure if I liked them but when I gave them another try I found that it wasn't the recipe but my American palate that had the problem.  They were wonderful and with a little jam, as N. Lawson suggests, and they were perfect and not sugar overload.  Give this book a try, you won't be disappointed!
B00003CXN4|1.0|I really don't know where to start.  This really had to be the worst movie made in 2001.  I just couldn't understand it. The story, or stories in the film. Who played the bad guys?  And what was that stupid speech about blacks always seen by whites as drug addicts, that we should undertstand  and feel sorry for them because Hey, that's all they know and do to survie.  Wasn't the black guy giving the drugs to the girl and pratically having her as a  his sex slave, because she...being stupid and rich and having nothing to do with her time needs her drugs. I couldn't stand her and wished she died in the film.  She just made me want to beat some sense into her.  This is what happens when we give everything to our kids (meaning allowances of over 100 dollars a week) so they start to get bored and have no sense of what it means to work for money or do with time after school. We really need to teach our kids how to be human beings instead of babying them and worrying about hurting there feeling. Because if we don't then we will see our kids turn into monsters who don't care who they hurt, rob, sale there bodies or do stupid things (like Jackass). If I was Michael Douglas I would have beat some reality into the girl and thrown her out on her butt. And the guy who won the supporting Oscar. NO Mexican speaks that way. The accent was wrong and the way the held a converstation.  It was like some ignoramus decided to be a screenwriter. What they should have done was go to Mexico and get a real translator and really done a decent job. I Mexican-American, born In Houston, raised in Houston and I consider myself a U.S. citizen just like anyone born here would, white, black, latino, etc. (But I don't consider myself a Mexican, because I've been to Mexico and they don't like Americanized latinos), and I have relatives in Mexico and they laughed at the accent and the stupid conversation the two latino actors were having. It was stupid.  A  Puerto-Rican accent?, when the character in the movie was Mexican? Makes no sence. The only character I liked was the Chaterine Zeta-Jones role. She was cool.  I guess it was the pregancy thing.  A pregnant lady who is desperate, who turns into a female Corleone was cool. That was it.  But I hate it and I will hate any movie that is politcally correct. Hollywood should not be afraid to show the ugly side of all races, Black, White, Hispanic, Oreantal, and so on. It is real life and real life affects all races...and that means drugs too affect all races.
B00005NOOH|1.0|While I echo the other reviews as regards the quality of the series, my box set had production errors in it. Disc 2 side 2 was the same as Disc 1 side 2. I don't know if this was a widespread manufacturing error, or whether it is unique to the set I purchased. This is an egregious error for the price of the set, and is why I rank this only 1 star. Apart from the erratum in my box set, the series itself is great, albeit with a British perspective.
B00003CXZ1|4.0|it was ok in the action sceens but seriously lacked an in depth plot.  angelina jolie played the part well but no mater how good an actor/actress you are , you can do only so much.  an ok movie but i was expecting more concidering the tomb raider name.
B00005RY7X|5.0|This album is totally awesome!!! It has just a little bit of everything that makes great music!! There are great songs, with awesome words that are easy to remember so stick in your head and are very catchy. The beats and rythms are totally cool. To me it seems like a combination of rock, punk, 80's hair band, and a stadium band!! Plus there are multiple songs about parties, and partying. Who doesn't love a good party, especially now that there are great songs to play at parties. The music is fast, upbeat, and very energetic. I have not been able to stop listening to it since I got it, and I love every song on it. There is not one song that I will skip over to get to another song!!
0345413377|4.0|I just finished this book in geometry class, and let me tell you, it is fantastic! It has everything you'd ever want in a fantasy epic - love, treachery, amazing imagry, well-developed and likeable characters... Pullman really pulls you into the series, especially this one, with the blooming romance of Will and Lyra(who despite their age are obviously quite mature, although some people who read this might feel a bit confused at their ascent).<BR> The only thing that really bothered me was a chapter, no, not even a chapter, a fragment of a chapter, in the end when Pullman uses one of his characters to vent on his atheism. I'm an agnostic, so either way, it doesn't so much matter that he's bashing orthodox religion... The fact is, it doesn't make sense that people could go through so something so eye-opening and fantastical and then openly outrule the existence of something like a creator. It was obvious that he was absent, but non-existant? Isn't that just as rediculous as orthodox religion? Pullman needs to read his own novel, I think. Anything's possible. That's the message I got, anyway.<BR> Either way, the book's a great read, and the best in the series. Read it; you'll enjoy it.<br />...
B000002HAF|2.0|If you don't like 80's alternative music that was popular on college radio, don't get this album.  I don't really find much talent in that genre or on this album.  &quot;Where is my mind?&quot; and &quot;Gigantic&quot; are the only songs on this album that I would listen to multiple times.  The other songs have no soul, groove or rhythm.  Just a lot of distorted noise and nobody playing toghether - very Sonic Youth.  This album is about 33 minutes long and we have to endure some kind of conversation for a whole minute toward the end of the disc.  It is pretty sad that they couldn't even find enough musical material for filler.
0440219078|5.0|Jonas is the twelve-year-old protagonist of this novel. He is living in a world without colours, pain and love. In the Ceremony of Twelve he receives his asseignment: He is the one who is chosen to be the new \\"Receiver of Memory\\". When he meets The Giver, who gives him these memories of pain, love and the ability to see colours, his life changes.<br />The journey to the realization that this system is not the right way to achieve peace and silence, is suspense-packed. At first,the daily life of the members of the community is described so lively that you think it is almost real. Every detail that the author mentions helps to create the apparent harmony and this \\"clean\\" atmosphere. <BR>When Jonas realizes that there must be a change, the dark secrets of the system come out and the action is rising. The suspense is even growing untill the end, which is open(I dislike this!).You can describe the developpment as a chain reaction- everything Jonas believed in becomes a lie.<br />I think, that Lois Lowry has created a world like this to show us that our life- with all its positive and negative sides- is better than living in an utopia without the thing that made us human-beings human-beings: Humanity
B00005JKNF|5.0|This is one of Robert Altman's better films and falls into a more traditional category of filmmaking but with many of his unique touches for character development pointing out the prominent idiosyncrasies of the members of his ensemble. Good performances do abound and the methodical plot moves ever so surreptitiously and comes to some very interesting revelations. This film seems to have grown much better with time proving that reflection is a good thing.
0452282152|5.0|\\"Girl with a Pearl Earring centers on Vermeer's prosperous Delft household during the 1660s. When Griet, the novel's quietly perceptive heroine, is hired as a servant, turmoil follows. \\"..or in my own words, A fictionalized account of a young girl in Holland who winds up working as a maid in Vermeer's house. She captivates the artist and becomes a muse for him. The best book I have read in years. You don't have to be an art lover to appreciate this book but it helps. Having studied Vermeer's paintings before I found the story very enjoyable and I could not put it down. If you love historical fiction and / or art history check this book out!
0395389496|5.0|The Polar Express is a train that picks up children on Christmas Even and takes them the North Pole, where they can hopefully receive the first Christmas present from Santa Claus.  The boy we follow wants a bell from Santa's sleigh and gets it, but loses it through the hole in his pocket.  The next morning, the bell is under his tree with a note from \\"Mr. C.\\"  He and his sister can hear it ring, but not his parents because they do not truly believe.  The pastel drawings are beautiful and very realistic.  They have just the right balance of hard lines and detail with softness and subtlety.<br />I remember receiving this book as a gift from my father when it was new.  I was just a small child and I remember how much I enjoyed the beautiful illustrations and longing to receive that special gift just like the boy in the story.  Unfortunately so many years have passed that I don't think I could hear the bell either - except when I read this book.  It is truly a special gift in itself.<br />Why 5 stars?:<br />The illustrations are absolutely wonderful.  Clearly, one can see why this book won a Caldecott Award.  The magic of Santa Claus is brought back to everyone who reads this book.  A wonderful story to read to children at Christmastime - or any time of year.
B0000636UN|5.0|This album has received very mixed reviews, with many critics citing the album as being too 'pop like' and uninspired when compared with previous recordings. Admittedly, Crow has changed her style a little since her last album, The Globe Sessions, but rather than detracting from the quality of the album, it has the opposite effect. <br />This album is still typically Crow, and after playing the album several times I am of the opinion that it is as good as previous work, although a little different. It is ironic that some chameleon - like artists such as Madonna are praised both by fans and critics when they change their musical style, whilst Sheryl Crow has been blasted by many fans and critics for her change in style. It must be remembered that changes in style are what keep artists fresh. It is also worth remembering that despite some critics claiming that Crow has sold out a little by making a 'poppy',' commercial' album, in order to get Top 40 airplay, her earlier recordings were also very successful commercially, with many of her earlier songs getting heavy airplay.<br />'Steve McQueen' rocks along, whilst 'It's Only Love, the emotion of which many will identify with, pulls on the heartstrings without becoming overly sappy ,as does 'Abilene'. 'Lucky Kid' could become a modern rock classic, whilst 'Weather Channel' gives the impression of being lonely and on the verge of breakdown (e.g. the lyric 'it might not fix the hinges, but at least the door has stopped its creaking'). All the above are excellent tracks that are typically Crow, as is the fantastic 'Safe and Sound' which is in a similar vein to 'Tomorrow Never Dies'<br />'Soak Up The Sun' is fun and summery, and a little 'poppy', but thought has gone into the lyrics all the same. 'My friend the communist/ Holds meetings in his RV/ I can't afford his gas/ So I'm stuck here watching TV'.<br />'You're An Original' is a biting satire on the current state of the music industry. Whilst the track has a decidedly 'poppy' sound, it criticises the music industry and the 'pop stars' that are 'chewed up and spit out' so routinely in the industry. 'You're an original baby/ Like we've never seen before/ You're an original baby/ Turn around and you're looking at a hundred more' and 'Here today, gone by morning' It really is inspired.<br />Below is a list of brief opinions on each track.<br />1) Steve McQueen - Rocks along nicely, with witty references to Crow's rise to fame and the current state of the music industry 'We got rock stars in the White House/ All our pop stars look likeporn/ All our heroes hit the highway/They don't hang out here no more.' 5/5<br />2) Soak Up The Sun - Pop influenced number, but some thoughtful lyrics too. 4/5<br />3) You're An Original - Mainstream sound only heightens the effect of this biting satire on the present state of the music industry, given even more weight due to Lenny Kravitz's collaboration. Great hook to boot. 5/5<br />4) Safe And Sound - Highly Polished number akin to 'Tomorrow Never Dies' 4/5<br />5) C'mon C'mon - Not particularly awe-inspiring when compared to the rest of the album. Whilst not a bad track it pales in comparison to the rest of the album. 3/5<br />6) It's So Easy - Another fabulous duet with, this time with Eagles front man Don Henley. 4/5 <BR>7) Over You - pulls on the heartstrings without becoming overly sappy. 5/5<br />8) Lucky Kid - A real rock classic with a particularly infectious hook .5/5<br />9) Diamond Road - I like this track, although it sounds familiar, and some may find it a bit sappy ' Walk with me the diamond road/ Tell me every story told'. 4/5<br />10) It's Only Love - A very introspective song that strikes a chord with anyone who has ever felt lonely. 'Sometimes lonely/ Isn't only a word/The faces I have known'. 5/5<br />11)  Abilene - An emotional song about the naïve approach we can often take to love and the way we can all too easily 'wear our heart on our sleeve' 5/5<br />12) Hole In My Pocket - A'poppy' song with a great beat, and thoughtless, but fun, lyrics. 3/5<br />13) Weather Channel - Probably my favourite track, is a ditty about suicide.Crow's vocals and lyrics give us an impression of someone on the edge of a breakdown. 'Can you make it better for me', ' I got no-one/ Who will bring me a big umbrella' and 'It may not fix the hinges, but at least the door has stopped its creaking' 5/5<br />Although this album may signify a slight change in direction for Crow, with a few 'poppy' sounding songs, it is hardly a huge departure from her earlier work. The lyrics, when studied, are first rate as usual, the shining examples being the deeply satirical 'You're An Original' and 'Weather Channel'. Apart from the thoughtless 'C'mon C'mon' and 'Hole In My Pocket' this is top notch Sheryl Crow.
B00003CXI1|5.0|I can't think of a single movie in history that had so many preconceived visions to conquer.  Not since the decision to cast Tom Cruise in Anne Rice's \\"Interview with the Vampire\\" had there been so much \\"audience\\" speculation as to the capability of a movie to match what readers had built up in their minds.<br />But Harry Potter was truly amazing.  Having read all four books myself (and repeatedly, at that) I too had a mind full of imagery associated with the characters and locations in these books.<br />The kids in the movie (Daniel Radcliffe et al) had HUGE expectations to meet.  Not only was this the screen debut for all three, they were playing roles of kids that millions of readers had come to know and love.  Without exception, I think all three lived up to expectations.<br />Next is the scenery.  While some of the actual settings didn't match up to what I had pictured in my mind, the movie is visually stunning and shows a painstaking attention to detail.<br />Detractors may complain that the movie itself didn't compete with what they had envisioned, I enjoyed the differences in what I had pictured and what the director put on film.  With 100 million readers, it would be impossible for any director to satisfy everyone.  I think Chris Columbus did a fine job and produced a film worthy of its literary roots.  Add to that a host of bonus features and a second disc, this is a purchase worthy of the asking price and will make a fine addition to my collection of DVD's and to my Harry Potter books.
B000002UD1|4.0|I recommend MIND GAMES as much as I do any John Lennon album. Lennon's IMAGINE, DOUBLE FANTASY and WALLS AND BRIDGES contain most of his smash hits. But MIND GAMES has what I call John's cult hits, radio-ignored songs that people mention as favorites when I tell them I'm a Lennon fan: \\"Meat City,\\" \\"One Day At A Time,\\" \\"Tight A$,\\" and \\"Bring On The Lucie.\\" Then there's the title song, which was a hit single. Recently, actor Kevin Spacey surprised me when he sang \\"Mind Games\\" so well during a televised John Lennon tribute concert. Make love, not war, and get John Lennon's MIND GAMES.
0671027344|5.0|I found this novel powerful, with many of the statements within the book such as what I've included in my title, having a unique ability to move, touch, rearrange, and push my feelings around like furniture inside me. So much of what Charlie, the 15-year-old who tells the story, writes makes sense and is something the reader can relate to or at least have feelings about.<br />Although I loved this book, some people who don't feel comfortable reading about controversial issues such as teen-age sexuality (heterosexual and homosexual), drug experimentation, and some other issues, may not enjoy this book. These issues aren't just mentioned, they're realistically and more profoundly explored through the eyes of a teen-ager. The way I looked at it, the issues here that Charlie lived through doesn't mean that Charlie or any of the people involved defined themselves by the issues - but rather, Charlie and the people involved in the story triumphed despite the challenges they faced. It's a story of growth, of learning and realizing identities - and the reader cannot get a grasp of HOW the characters grew and changed and learned to LIVE, without telling about such controversial issues.<br />Charlie is a believable, lovable, very intelligent, though struggling teen-ager who tries so hard to do what he thinks other people want or need that he is constantly denying himself - standing aside and watching other people live instead of stepping into the situation and giving something to it. A wonderful bunch of people step into Charlie's life and help him learn how to feel infinite, how to live and love, and how to remember painful things from his past that will help him to handle some of the loss in his life.
0345451325|5.0|I thought this book was great. I really like the game Halo, so this book was a joy to read. It was interesting to lean about what happened to Reach and how humans came to get involved with the Covenant. The into to the game creates a lot of questions, and the book pretty much answers them. So I do recommend this book to anyone interested in sci-fi, and especially people who are Halo fans.
078062999X|5.0|I would first like to thank this movie for helping me to pas the Advanced Placement English test.  <br />This film is great because it follows directly with the text, I had the text in my lap while watching this and it went word for word 99% of the time.  the filming is amazing and the cameos are fun but that is it.  Kenneth Branagh did another amazing job with this film version of Shakespeare.  This is a great film, now can it just come out on DVD?
0385503954|4.0|Ian McEwan doesn't write little happy tomes.  That's what I like about him.  And while this wasn't his best (I'm still partial to his early work) it was an entertaining read.  The characters are not overly sympathetic (they rarely are) but the story is a good one and although you can see some of the twists coming, not all of them are apparent. <br />I enjoy the pace of his narrative, and I don't find chapter breaks bothersome if they leave me hanging, because I've come to enjoy McEwan's style and pace.  The layers of his story come together in an almost dreamlike fashion, and sometimes it's not until after an event has come and gone that you sense that things are maybe not what they seem.  Again, it's not quite the same creepy level (psychologically or otherwise) as his other books, as you pretty much see what is happening as it happens.  <br />But the fun is in the telling.  If you're a McEwan fan you'll enjoy this a bunch.  If you are not a McEwan fan (yet) I'd still suggest reading this, but make sure you also read Cement Garden and Comfort of Strangers (and perhaps The Innocent).
B0000048CX|5.0|Quite possibly their best, this album is a must have for Yo La Tengo fans. It's also an excellent introduction for newcomers. If you're thinking about buying this album, BUY IT! You won't be disappointed.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Upon hearing Norah Jones sing her first few lines of this cd I felt as if I had came across a remarkable treasure.This cd was addictive, I told everyone about it the day I bought it. It is both nostalgic sounding and fresh. It is a masterpiece, and Norah I believe is timeless, and is here to stay.
1577311523|3.0|I enjoyed this book very much. Living in the moment is such an important concept which we don't do in this day and age. This book helps ground that out nicely. The book was easy to read and progressed nicely. One book that I think would complement this book beautifully is The Lost Teachings of Atlantis by Jon Peniel. It continues where this book leaves off. I recommend both.
6304401132|5.0|I have watched this film countless times with my daughter, and find it to be one of the most beautiful drawn Disney features to date.The fourteenth century is the backdrop for King Stephan and his queen to introduce baby princess Aurora to the world.  While she is being blessed by the 3 good fairies, Flora, Fauna, and the adorably chubby and rambunctious Merryweather, Maleficent rears her most intriguing, green pointed head.  Angry about not being invited to the gathering, she bestows an evil curse upon the newborn, to \\"prick her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel, and DIE\\".  This to happen before sundown on he sixteeth birthday.<br /><br />The tale is beautifully spun among lushly drawn surroundings populated with one of a kind characters.  Aurora is beautiful and innocent in the face of impending danger, King Hubert's son Prince Phillip is one of the most handsome princes.  The three fairies who guard and raise Aurora in secret to protect her whereabouts from Maleficent, are lots of adorable fun.  Speaking of Maleficent, she is probably my favorite Disney villain of all time, tied perhaps,  with Snow Whites' \\"Old Hag\\", who is hideously hard to beat in the villain realm.<br /><br /> \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" is a quality Disney classic that has stood the test of time.  I highly reccommend this entry is Disney's vast filmography for children, and their significant elders, to enjoy again, and again.
B00005QDW1|5.0|What an album! The best one so far from No Doubt. The new style is great with reggae and r&amp;b sounds. Just amazing! Great to see that the guys (and Gwen...) in No Doubt have the curiosity and courage to explore new sounds.
B00003CXXI|5.0|This is a wonderfully innovative film the whole family will enjoy! With a surprising twist on the tried and true fairy tale formula, this funny and occasionally touching story about an ogre who just wants to be left alone is visually stimulating  (for the kids), and entertaining and clever (for the teens and adults) enough to hold anyone's attention.  I loved this movie, and I'm sure you will too! :P
B00005YU1O|5.0|This is one of the best movies I've ever had the joy of seeing.  I have a question for anyone out there in the know....Is it possible to find a copy of the screenplay by any chance?  Anyone know where?  It's an excellent script and I'd love to read it...
B0000021RD|3.0|This is a great set of songs.  Nice to have all four album sides on a single disc.  How well I remember the days of vinyl, having to get up to flip or swap discs in order to hear the whole album!<br />Too bad they haven't remastered this album.  Sound quality is marginally better than my old LP copy.  The original masters must have more dynamic range and depth than this.
B0000029GA|5.0|Illumatic is a straight up masterpiece of rap records. If you don't have this album i highly suggest you go pick it up. If you want a definition of rhythem supermacy Nas on this album definition it.  I honestly can say that i lesson to this album everyday.  It one of those albums that artist now a day are afraid to release.  Street lyrics and Global Awareness is what you can expect to get when you purchase Illumatic. This album deserves 25 stars.
0930289234|5.0|It is hard to describe how good Watchmen is.  It is important not ignore Watchmen because it is a comic.  Watchmen is a great mystery thriller, analytical read, political commentator, and comic satire(even though I don't evactly know what is saying here) all in one.  Watchmen is character driven with a rock solid plot, the entire story relates back to one, insignificant seeming, scene, which is brilliant.<br />The use of graphic novel as a medium helps to express the multi-layered story.  After reading Watchmen, I realize that comics can portray more action, speech, narration, and characters thoughts than books, movies or any other medium.  The use of the Pirate Comic as commentary and comparison is excellent.<br />I can't understate how heavy and moving the story is.  I reflected on my entire life and beliefs after reading Watchmen, like The Matrix or American Beauty, but more heavyhanded(almost to a Fountainhead point).  I only hope I can find other comics as entertaining.<br />If you have never read comics, start here.  Watchmen has &quot;superheroes&quot; as characters, but not really a traditional superhero book, like Batman: Year One, which I am reading now.  By the way, Rorschach and the Comic are my favorite.<br />I am a reasonably well read peson, who likes a good story, but longs for substance, this book gave me both.  Watchmen is a must read!
B00005JL3A|4.0|This movie will please all resident evil fans. Can't say the same if you are a softheart though. It's a combination of the first three Resident Evil games, and by close observation you'll notice this. Hopefully they'll make another Resident Evil movie...and maybe fix it up a bit.
B00000273P|5.0|\\"Jordan: the Comeback\\" is an epic. That means that yes, it's a loosely conceptual album that aims for a grand statement with impassioned songs, but yes, that also means quality control kind of went out the window. Prefab songwriter/singer Paddy McAloon revised the 70s prog concept album with \\"Jordan\\" making it a concept album in two parts: side 1 is a vague, romanticized American patchwork, with references to the Cold War and Jesse James, much of it loosely tying into an Elvis theme. Side 2 is apparently about love and God, and McAloon tackles the subject with his typically keen wit and insight, though he occasionally succumbs to sentimental sappiness.    Many of \\"Jordan's\\" songs are finely-crafted, lush, gorgeously melodic, deceptively simple, soulful, gossamer pop that may send chills down the spine of the most hardened misanthrope. \\"Looking for Atlantis,\\" with its driving beat and airy melodies, gets the album off to an energetic start before slipping into the soul/jazz minimalism of the slinky \\"Wild Horses\\" (about an old geezer pining for jailbait). \\"Jesse James Bolero\\" is a beautiful, moody number set to an upbeat bolero, with lyrics that use the imagery of Jesse James as a metaphor for Elvis and all that he embodies in American culture. The song contains some interesting parallels with Brian Wilson's \\"Smile\\"-era work, particularly \\"Cabinessence.\\"    The upbeat, catchy \\"Moondog\\" romanticizes and condemns America's Cold War \\"Red\\" paranoia. Other tunes worth mentioning are the dramatic, swoony beauty of \\"The Ice Maiden\\" and the soft, mesmerizing \\"Paris Smith.\\" From there, however, \\"Jordan\\" slips noticeably downhill with tripe like \\"Wedding March\\" and the trite closer \\"Doo Wop in Harlem.\\" McAloon could've easily shaved off the last quarter of \\"Jordan,\\" and we'd still be left with a mind-blowing album of high consistency and tremendous depth. But, cutting it off there evidently would've left \\"Jordan\\" conceptually incomplete; it's just too bad things have to go south for McAloon to finish his ruminations on the subject. Regardless, \\"Jordan\\" is still a wonderful album that's easily as recommendable as \\"Steve McQueen\\" or \\"Swoon.\\"
B00002EPMF|2.0|I've been a big fan of Death, with Sound of Perseverance being top of my list followed by Spiritual Healing. I must admit that I am really not drawn to anything sung too high, and what I mean by high is anything prettier than a growl or scream (Nevermore is an exception). The music itself is solid. Some balls-out, double-bass, mad drumming. Some cool guitar solos and shredding riffs. Some solid bass lines. But the biggest problem I have with this band is the lack of an enticing melody or groove that pulls you in. My point is, if you're going to have melodic vocals there should be enough of a melody to carry the song. My favorite track, \\"Breaking the Broken\\" does a pretty good job of this, but the album as a whole doesn't. The progressive/technical/experimental aspect to the music does make each track more interesting with extended listening, but I still have to categorize this disc as having a lot of good ideas, but put together they are just a little too disjointed. This will not stand the test of time, sorry to say.
B00000K19E|5.0|Wow! This is one of the best movies in a long, long time. You just got to see it!
B00005QHPQ|5.0|This is a great CD if you are looking for pure pop. The only song I dislike is 'Don't Turn of the Lights'.....it is more or less wailing to music. 'Hero' is a good track, but annoying since we've only heard it a million times in weeks following 9/11.
B00005RYL9|3.0|I have mixed feelings about this DVD.  The digital transfer here is light-years better than that of the previous DVD incarnation.  The sound quality is also significantly better, although it fails to live up to the expectations of a Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack.  Unfortunately, the annoying (previously deleted) scenes incorporated in the &quot;Director's Cut&quot; DVD are present here as well.  The DVD would have been enhanced by making these scenes available as bonus material - or better yet, offering viewers the choice of watching the main feature with or without them.<br />It is the bonus material that disappoints the most.  The same extras present in the dismal &quot;Director's Cut&quot; DVD release are here, with the notable exception of the bug which turned the behind-the-scenes photos into the slide show from hell.  Also included are several Queen music videos from the movie's soundtrack, as well as photos of the band.<br />However, the latter appear to be stills taken from the music videos, or cover art of singles released throughout the world in support of Queen's &quot;A Kind of Magic&quot; album. Anyone familiar with the CD reissue of this album has seen them in the booklet - and would know where to find the three songs featured in the bonus second disc.  There is nothing new here.<br />The Queen material strikes me as a misguided tribute to the late Freddy Mercury.  Even the feature DVD disc has his image next to Christopher Lambert's!  And while the soundtrack is arguably an important part of the movie, it is hardly the reason why HIGHLANDER has become a cult favorite.  Thus, all the Queen material, while relevant, accomplishes very little in this DVD release.  Neither Freddy Mercury nor his bandmates wrote, directed, or acted in the film.  I would have rather seen a making-of featurette, or hear Sean Connery in character.<br />If you love HIGHLANDER, get the single DVD, which would rate 3 1/2 to 4 stars.  The &quot;Immortal Edition&quot; is a misnomer,and offers little bang for your buck, since you could get BOTH the regular DVD and Queen's &quot;A Kind of Magic&quot; CD for less.  One has to wonder whether the HIGHLANDER DVD is becoming an immortal itself, with new versions being released all the time, yet none meeting the obvious expectations of fans.  There should only be ONE, but why, when the releases can go on forever?
0743201140|4.0|My favorite part of this book is how aggressively positive it is. Rather than the usual focusing on weaknesses or negative behavior (i.e. studying sub-par performance to understand what makes up excellent performance), they insist that we focus on excellence as a separate science. This doesn't sound groundbreaking, but it really is a different approach than what most of us have experienced throughout our lives. The online test is a useful tool, but when I first got back my results, I didn't agree with them. I had to put them down for a few days,  read some more of the book, and come back to the test results before I realized that they were right. However, if you're looking for something that will tell you exactly which career you should choose, you will be disappointed by this book. It doesn't hand you all the answers at the end, since one of the things it emphasizes is how your strengths can be used in many different roles and organizations. The book is intended to help you figure out where to start - it's up to you to figure out which way to go.
B00005K3OT|5.0|If life is like a box of chocolates, the life is sweet.  This DVD is wonderful in every sense.  No one could play Vienne except for Juliette Binoche and Johnny Depp is fabulous as Roux.  The magnatism between them is electric.  Then add Alfred Molina as the Compte and Lena Olin and of course Judy Denche.  Magnificient.  I've watched this DVD at least 10 times and it just gets better and better.  Part fairy tale, part love story..all magical!
B00005QIPH|2.0|Hi there. I'm a pretentious music snob. There, got it out in the open. I'll listen to music from any genre, if its original, melodically and texturally nteresting, or evocative. Now the Strokes aren't THAT bad. Honest. There cheesily obvious watered down iggy meets the smiths in a run down bar. They llok pretty and wear distressed threads. Their alright. Whats the fuss all about?<BR>NME's falling circulation perhaps...<br />In no way the saviours of anything, except their probably quite ample insurance plans, the Strokes will fade within 3 yrs guarenteed. Its the last thrashings of those who cannot accept that the most interesting work is happening in electronica, arty metal, underground hip hop, avant-jazz etc.<BR>Grow up.
B00005ASIL|5.0|Jethro Tull represents one of the most progressive and experimental elements of sixties rock, and the individual songs as well the concept albums are delights to listen to and enjoy. This is an excellent compilation of their hits, although I was a bit bummed to discover that it did not have \\"Skating Away (On The Thin Ice Of A New Day)\\" on it.  Other than that regrettable shortcoming, this is a very full complement of Ian Anderson masterpieces, ranging from the emblematic \\"Aqualung\\" to the trippy \\"Living In The Past', from a raucous \\"Bungle In The Jungle\\" to a comical \\"Too Old To Rock And Roll/Too Young To Die\\".<br />The compilation covers the progress of the group all the way from its early beginnings with songs like \\"Living In The Past\\" and \\"Aqualung\\" to its final efforts with songs like \\"Broadsword\\" and \\"Heavy Horses\\". Among my favorites here are \\"Locomotive Breath\\", \\"Songs From The Wood', and of course, \\"Thick As A Brick\\". Ian Anderson was famous for doing his own particular thing, for his quirky brilliance in arranging song structures and instrumentation, for mixing rock with a folksy twang, and for also never trying to cash in by copying the successful work of others. The group never tried to go mainstream rock, but were quite successful with their own peculiarly British take on sixties rock. Enjoy
B00004ZD69|5.0|Okay, so some people argue that perhaps Gospeed are a little predictable. Fair enough. However, the manner in which they are predictable is one which make the most sense to human beings: eg- building from small fragments to immense climaxes. To me this seems a perfectly decent compositional mode, and one in which Godspeed are the masters. No one has ever produced music that sounds this BIG. Even the most expansive orchestras fail to conjure quite such a vast sense of scale, such a huge sounding, dangerous wall of vibrating sound. The variety on offer in this album is excelllent, everything from romantic classical inspired romps, to dark skeletal psychedelia, an almost DJ Shadow goes prog rock moment at the end of the 3rd track, ambient hymns to the fallen, death marches and pulsating sinister classical-metal. To me this album is their most textured, atmospheric, and downright interesting work to date, and one of a handful of albums that I can never tire of listening to.<BR>It is also interesting to note that, on the whole, Godspeed are a band that you can platy to any open minded person, (even some not-so open minded ones) and they understand what the music is about.
038533558X|5.0|I absolutely loved this book along with all of the other Harlan Coben books.  I could not put it down and finished it in one day.  The book keeps moving from beginning to end with twists and turns around every corner!  A must read for all mystery lovers!
B00005IC2H|4.0|I first heard Sigur Ros a good 6 months before this album came out in the UK, and immediately bought their Ny batteri EP, and thought: &quot;hmmm, pretty good actually, dark and melodic song oriented post-rock (of a non chicagoan variety)&quot;<BR>However, having lived with the following album for some time, (well over two years now), I have top say its not QUITE as good as some make out. It is just basically standard soppy indie songs arranged absolutely brilliantly, (not there's anything wrong per se with that). It builds well from the beginning, but loses it big time with Olsen Olsen, a ridiculous over sweetly melodic track that sounds like the opening music to some tea-time TV show from the early 90s.<br />This is a good album, which is well played and produced, but is not as all out, take your breath away amazing as some might think. Far far better than bands like Mogwai, sure.<BR>But lisen to this next to Godspeed's last album, and it does rather pale in comparison.
B000002KHY|4.0|This has the good points of a greatest hits record and also the bad points of such a compilation.  Greatest hits, coming from several different planned sets, give you the high points of the performer's talent and a neat bundle of the songs you've heard on the radio together.  But something of his essence is lost.<br />That said, this is truly a CD to own, especially if you don't have more than one of his early albums.  A third of the album does come from &quot;Sweet Baby James&quot;, supporting the feeling that this was one of his best original albums.  But you have more here.  You have two of his performances of &quot;other people's&quot; songs:  Carole King's &quot;You've Got A Friend&quot;, and Holland, Dozier, Holland's &quot;How Sweet It Is&quot;.  Also, he get's notable help such as Joni Mitchell on &quot;You've Got A Friend&quot;, Carly Simon on &quot;How Sweet It Is&quot;, Graham Nash and David Crosby on &quot;Mexico&quot;.<br />James Taylor's trademarks are his subtle delivery and his self-revealing lyrics.  Both qualities shine forth on these hits from his 70-76 period.  And now there's a companion record to include his later accomplishments.  This is a shorty for a &quot;Best of&quot; collection, by today's standards.  But the quality much more than makes up for any lack of quantity.  There's no teaser of new material such as is invariably tacked on today's greatest hit packages, and to me, that's a plus.  <br />There are those who aren't in tune with the smooth, personal touch in Taylor's presentations.  Some might find it bland, even syrupy.  But for those who listen with the heart as well as the ears, this is a rewarding addition to your personal collection.
6304711921|2.0|you've GOT to be kidding putting this in the 3-6 yr old catagory!  my husband and i watched this and called it the \\"feel bad movie of the year.\\"  of course, the animation and scores are very well done, but the adult themes make this a REAL nightmare-inducer for any child that is allowed to watch it.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|See this movie now or I will destroy you. <BR>This movie is beautiful. All of the performances are awesome. Patrick Swayze is PERFECT in the PERFECT role. <BR>Frank is the most mesmerizingly creepy 6 foot sci-fi bunny rabbit ever.<BR>The soundtrack is amazing. I really can't say enough about this movie. It is BEAUTIFUL.
0694003611|5.0|This is a magical book that seems to fascinate young children. This was the most favorite book of my first daughter when she was a toddler and now my second daughther is also absolutely in love with it. It is a great book for a short reading before going to bed. It is also a great book for a child to keep next to his/her pillow at night. Both of my children loved looking for and finding the little mouse on the color pages. They also liked reading this book aloud to themselves again and again. Alternating color and black and white illustrations and simple text seem to resonate very well with children of toddler age.     \\"The Moon Book\\" is the \\"best book ever\\" for toddlers.
B00000JGHM|5.0|Heat is a great movie directed by Micheal Mann(The Insider, Ali) who does a great job in this movie. This movie has a great cast including Al Pacino(Godfather, Scarface), Robert De Niro(Taxi Driver, Raging Bull), Val Kilmer(The Doors, Top Gun), Tom Sizemore(Saving Private Ryan, Black Hawk Down), John Voight(Deliverance, Mission Impossible) and Ashley Judd(Kiss The Girls, Double Jeopardy). Most movies cannot compete with this cast. I recommend this movie to any fan of Al Pacino/ Robert De Niro and likes some great action sequences.
0140177396|5.0|This story is a simple one in many ways. It's about the Depression, class relations, friendship, and how we treat people with disabilities. It has as much relevance today as it did when it first came out. I read it years ago, and I still remember it. As another reviewer mentioned, it says a great deal about the importance of Steinbeck's message that Lenny has been recreated in so many Warner Brothers cartoons -- he's an archetypical character.<br />I loved how vividly Steinbeck brought the reader back to the Great Depression. He really showed how difficult that time period was, and the way the &quot;American Dream&quot; has been sold to people who will likely never reach it. The relationship between Lenny and George was absolutely wonderful -- I loved that George did try to take care of Lenny, even if I didn't like how he treated him at times. All the characters were full bodied, three dimensional people. The choices Steinbeck had them make seemed sensible. This novel is essentially flawless, and I would reccommend it to anyone over the age of about 12 -- it does have some rather serious themes, so readers who are very young, even if they can read it (its' written in fairly simple language) might find some parts disturbing. If you didn't read this book in high school, read it now -- you'll be glad you did.
0783226845|5.0|This movie is all about a great performance, and I'm not talking about Chris O'Donnell. This movie shows the great acting ability in my favorite actor, Al Pacino. He gets a very well deserved Academy Award, which he should of got a long time ago. This shows how great acting and a great script can go a long way. Nobody could do a better job of acting as a blind man. He pulled it off and made it very believable. The other actors in this movie are mediocre, but it was really about Lieutenant Colonel Frank Slade. Great Performance and anyone who is a fan of Al Pacino or of great acting watch this movie!!
0553278223|4.0|I didn't expect to like this book - I read it because it was assigned to me in school years ago. It stuck with me. Bradbury is a deft satirist -- he makes many excellent points about modern society through his allegorical look at the exploration on Mars. I found the book fascinating, challenging, and yet not too hard to read. I don't particularly like the use of the short story format -- I think if he'd written it as a novel rather than interconnected short stories, it would've worked even better. I also found it a bit violent at times; I'd have preferred to have the violence be a bit more implied than stated. But overall, I think this is an important work that everyone, sci fi fan or not, should probably read for the underlying message about accepting others. The book is as relevant today as it was when it was first published.
B00005RY7X|5.0|This is one of the best cd's i have ever heard. It is filled with enormous explosions of sound. It is very energetic and will leave you astounded!!
6304698658|3.0|I can safely say that this is BY FAR the best Christmas movie out to date, perhaps even the best comedy.  Chevy Chase is at his comedic best in what I feel is his greatest movie ever.  He stars as Clark W. Griswold (the character he portrayed in two &quot;Vacation&quot; movies prior to this, in addition to one released about 8 years after.<br />Anyhow, the premise of this film is that Clark wants his ENTIRE family over for the Christmas holidays, so with over a dozen relatives crammed in the Griswold house, all hilarity breaks loose.  From a house draped in Christmas lights, a fried cat, and a squirrel/dog chase, to an exploding turkey, a slippery sled and Chevy Chase flipping out every 30 seconds, you have all the ingredients for one hilarious movie.<br />So, that being said, I gave this DVD edition only 3 stars.  This is simply because this movie has been released in the FULL SCREEN FORMAT.  This indeed takes away from the film a great deal, and by far deserves the anamorphic widescreen treatment.  I don't mind so much about commentary, behind the scenes aspects, etc.  But they should have at least given this film the treatment it deserves.<br />I can only hope that Warner Brothers have listened to everybody's cries, and release a special edition of this film in widescreen format.  I don't think it's asking for much.  I've talked to plenty of people who have told me that watching this movie is a holiday tradition.  So, hopefully we can see this happen, perhaps before the next holiday season.
B00000K19E|5.0|Classic Keanu Reeves is back and cooler than ever. Laurence Fishburne has finally made a name for himself. A world is run by computers and only 'The Chosen One' can stop the agents from controlling the world. This movie tried to be smart, but I wasn't impressed. The special effects were mediocre. Keanu Reeves was witty as Neo 'The Chosen One' with his trademark 'whoa' saying. Laurence Fishburne was thin on top and he was great. Good cinema worthy of watching.
B000002UCN|5.0|Excellent CD.  Can't bring myself to take it out of the tape deck.  A great selection of songs including my favoriate &quot;Dark Horse&quot;.  If you like George Harrison and the Beatles, you will love this CD.
B000002HMH|5.0|I dont care what anyone says- this is a great album, among Metallica's best (even up there with Master of Puppets).  Most people think that just because the music changed, it is bad.  Well, I've got news for you- this change was good.  No, great.  Instead of the entire album being a lot of headbanging and too- fast noise(even to the point to where the listener cannot understand the lyrics), Load's songs actually mean something.  Also, I am so sick and tired of all these die-hard Metallica fans complaining that Metallica \\"sold out\\".  They did not sell out.  In fact they did the exact opposite- improved greatly.  My favorites are \\"the house jack built\\", \\"until it sleeps\\",and \\"king nothing\\".  I recommend this cd to any old-school or modern rock fan.
B00005JL3A|4.0|I thought the movie was a very good thriller. It had great action sequences, and most of all it was suspeceful with a strong script. I'm certainly going to buy this movie when it comes out July 30th. Now the movie had zombies, a licker, and a crazy super computer and don't forget the zombie dogs who were in the movie for about 10 minutes, and that's just the first movie. In the second movie Alice has to deal with my old pal Nemesis.
B000002H2H|5.0|I have had this cd for about three years now, and I still love it just as much as the day I bought it.  It is truly classic, especially with songs such as &quot;for whom the bell tolls&quot; and &quot;fade to black&quot;.  Not as heavy as Master of Puppets or Justice for All, but is just as great.
0767809246|5.0|I fell in love with this movie when I first saw it. This movie has to be my all time favorite!  I loved the performances that Wil Wheaton, River Phoenix, Corey Feldman, and Jerry O'Connell played.  My all time favorite character was Chris Chambers played by River Phoenix, he was outstanding and did I mentioned he looked really hot! I recommend this movie to everyone, it's the greatest!  R.I.P River Phoenix, I love you!
0486211045|5.0|This book is a priceless reference for *anyone* who has to, or wants to, draw proper anatomy.  G. Bridgman's methods are timeless.  This guy taught many of the giants of the Golden Age of Illustration.  If nothing else, having it in your office library will give you credibility.
B000002TQV|4.0|Looking at Radiohead's first album-Pablo Honey- and then at the Bends really shows how far the band has progressed over time. Pablo Honey was a traditional rock album but Radiohead expands on that sound with the bends. SOngs like bends, high and dry and my iron lung are songs that stray away from the early radiohead material. It helps to give an introduction into radiohead creating its trully unique sound.
B000002UB6|3.0|If you are new to The Beatles DO NOT start with \\"Let It Be?\\"  Why?  This was the wind down to the breakup, and I agree with Lennon:  \\"By the time we got to Let it Be, we couldn't play the game anymore...it was no longer creating magic.\\"  If you are a die-hard fan, then go ahead and try it.  \\"Let it Be,\\" \\"Get Back,\\" \\"The Long & Winding Road,\\" and \\"Across the Universe\\" are just about the only hits.  \\"I Me Mine\\" is horrid, and makes me want to gag.  (In the movie, they play a tape recording of I Me Mine and show John & Yoko dancing, which also makes me want to gag.)  \\"Dig It\\" is OK but all too short.  \\"For You Blue\\" & \\"One After 909\\" are rather good songs.  This leaves us with \\"Dig a Pony\\" and \\"Maggie Mae,\\" both of which could have been seen straight to the trash without delay.  Too bad they couldn't have gotten rid of these tapes in the burnings in 1966.  Another problem with this album is that you hear less Beatles and more Phil Spector.  Here's my advice:  if you are new to the Beatles, don't start here; start with \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" or \\"Rubber Soul.\\"  For die-hard fans, go ahead and try it.
B000002UR7|5.0|Pablo Honey is a good album though different from their later material. Pablo Honey is a straight rock album really. Other radiohead albums like OK Computer, the Bends and especially Amnesiac and KID A push boundaries and experiments with new sounds and ideas. Pablo Honey is a good debut with some sold rock tracks and helps to put the whole band's career into propestive because it shows how much this band has changed and redifined itself. Overall, it helps to give a more complete picture of radiohead.
B000002GK1|5.0|Soundgarden were one of the best early 90's seattle bands and this album certainly proves this. badmotarfinger is a great album from begining to end, songs like &quot;Room a Thousand Years Wide&quot;, &quot;outshined&quot; and &quot;somewhere&quot; illustrate what was going on in the seattle scene perfectly, not forgeting the ever impresive &quot;rusty cage&quot;. This is without a doubt one of the most amazing rock'n'roll albums of all time.
0385505833|5.0|Skipping Christmas is a wonderfully humorous book, looking at our often and seemingly \\"materialistic\\" Christmas traditions.  This is not your typical Grisham novel, in the sense that it is missing the incredible legal twist, detail and drama.  Instead, this book is light, airy, hilarious, and pokes great fun at how most of America runs around crazy during the holiday season.  I really liked this book, could not put it down, and found myself laughing at the antics of Luther and Nora Krank as well as their delightfully intruding close-knit neighbors on Hemlock Drive.<br />With their daughter graduating from college and leaving to spend a year in Peru with the Peace Corps, Luther and Nora decide not to celebrate Christmas this year.  Instead, they decide to take the money that they would normally spend on all the trimmings and take a Caribbean cruise.  That means no tree, no card, no present, no office parties, no decorations, no donations, and no annual home party.<br />Word quickly spreads throughout this small town that the Krank's are not celebrating Christmas and will not be participating in the neighborhood or town festivities.  Instead their time is spent in tanning booths in preparation for the hot Caribbean sun.  The neighbors harass them every chance they get and picket signs even appear on their front lawn.  The neighborhood blames them for not winning the annual \\"best decorated street contest\\", as theirs is the only house not decorated!<br />On Christmas Eve, the Krank's get a surprise call from their daughter that she will indeed being coming home for Christmas and will be there in six hours.  Will the Krank's go on their cruise or will they \\"attempt\\" to celebrate Christmas?  Read the book find out what the ending will entail!<br />This book will have you laughing out loud at not only Larry Krank's antics and dialogue, but also at the dialogue and behavior of the neighbor's reactions to their skipping Christmas.  The dialogues are just priceless!  The pictures that Grisham paints in your mind will have you reeling on the floor!<br />The ending will warm your heart and bring an appreciation to all of your own traditions - what a really great story!!!ures that Grisham paints in your mind will have you reeling on the floor!<br />The ending will warm your heart and bring an appreciation to all of your own traditions - what a really great story!!!
B00005U1YO|3.0|I have two other CB albums and eagerly anticipated their next.  But i was pretty disappointed with their effort here.  The CD comes off as being a little too repetitive and not nearly as engaging as some of their other work.  There are a few songs that are worth listening to but as a whole, it's not nearly as strong as Surrender in my humble opinion.  It didn't make my cd rotation...
0060005424|5.0|I am almost finished with this great novel. I am resisting the ending not because it is boring but because it is awesome.it was an unexpected treasure that I found on the bottom shelf in [local store]. I have also read the first novel,Sabriel,and that was also a great piece of fantasy unlike any other.This book is mostly for girls in their teens. I would not reccomend these books to anyone under ten due to some scary content and ideas.
B000060P79|5.0|Hey, I must say this album ROCKS!!!!! If you haven't got it, i suggest you get it, not only are these guys talented they are CANADIAN!!!!, If you want to check them out live, check them out on the Warped Tour, the Pop Disaster tour and Edgefest, they are a must see, Hanging out with the likes of Good Charlotte, Blink 182, these guys will definately break out big!.  Check out their website... read up on them, listen to their tunes, i guarantee you will like what you hear, HERE COMES SIMPLE PLAN,
B00003CX95|5.0|I've never been a HUGE fan of Mel Gibson's...oh, he's pretty good in the Lethal Weapon movies, a bit crazy of course..and I liked him in Conspiracy Theory although the movie wasn't the best of all I've seen...but THIS movie, this movie is beyond comparison to anything I've ever seen him in..now I have a real sense of Mel Gibson as an actor, a director and an entertainer of the finest caliber.<br />Braveheart is a war film; it echos the likes of huge war epics like Saving Private Ryan, the mass of people fighting in ancient times like Gladiator; but way before Russell Crowe put on his skirt Mel Gibson took the chance of donning a kilt in freezing Scotland weather to give movie-going audiences a heartfelt tale of a brave Scottish commoner that literally led Scotland to its freedom from the tyranny of Britain's king in the 13 century.  There's lots of blood and guts, horses being stabbed and people being beheaded and crushed, but none of it bothered me so much...Gibson managed to keep the visuals exciting without lingering too long (fractions of second on the real horrible parts) on the carnage.  He also managed to suck me into characters (not to mention his great legs) that kept me going for the entire 3 hours and to want to actually be a part of the freedom fighters by the middle of the show.  The music is beautiful, the scenery breathtaking and Mel's accent better than acceptable..don't miss this great movie...It's a must see!
B00003CXDD|5.0|Willow is truely a classic.  I remember watching it over and over growing up and am so glad to finally see it released on DVD.  Some may call it cliched but it is truely a fairy tail that captures so many of the main threads of human mythology. Perhaps that is why it has such appeal.  <br />The video and audio quality are wonderful.  I don't care much for DVD extras (generally I just want the movie).
1878424319|4.0|&quot;The Four Agreements&quot; by Don Miguel Ruiz, is a book written in a simple philososphical style. Perhaps a philosophy that is easier to understand than any of the western thinkers. His use of words, sometimes is very repetitive which is what links one agreement to the next. I would recommend this book to other people if they want to get into the Toltec Thinking; it is simple but also a delighted one.  <BR>This I would relate to Jean Paul Sartre in the sense that both talk about being. Sartre says you are not what you are, but you are what you will be. Ruiz talks about domestication of humanity, and by that domestication we became not what we were to be, but other than what we were to be. <BR>In the Four Agreements there is a lot of things to look at as true if we compare to what goes on in a society. However, there are things not to be taken extremely serious and the reader must free him/her self from that. Also it is a boo for personal groth and maturity, especially if you are one of those who take things personal. Read this book and you will lear to be a better person.
B00005JG6R|4.0|The animation of Akira is a true landmark for its time (originally released in 1988). The city (Neo-Tokyo) is filled with details and the characters as well: they have lots of distinct traits beyond the more traditional type of anime, where almost all characters have large eyes, although the movies take place in Japan. Also the music that accompanied the feature -like most animes- was outstanding.<br />However, I admit that I had a hard time understanding certain parts of the movie, just like I did with Escaflone more recently. Some friends who are cult followers of the genre explained to me that the reason for this was the fact that the movie was derived from a comic book series from the early eighties. Therefore, unless you are big time into anime movies, except for the artistic side of the movie (animation, music) be ready for a story where you will have to fill in a lot of blanks. Also be ready for a movie with lots of violence: definitely not for children or people who are easily impressed with bloody scenes. My personal opinion: I'd much rather see 'Ghost in the Shell' or 'Final Fantasy' again.

B000063S6Z|5.0|Another 18 tracks -thus the name of the album- put together by pop-superstar Moby in this, his newest production, give the listener plenty of material to choose from. It might be questioned how original he has been this time around, when the norm of his previous works has almost always been innovation: at least I confess I had a hard time getting over my initial impression of &quot;Oh, my God! This totally sounds like 'Play'.&quot; But after a few listens, it starts to pick up speed and take on a totally different meaning inside of you.<br />With '18' Moby has taken a two-fold approach: a good half of the album picks up where 'Play' and its B-Sides left and the other half brings a handful of new elements. Lots of gospel vocals and spiritual lyrics can be found in songs such as &quot;In This World,&quot; &quot;In My Heart&quot; and &quot;One Of These Mornings,&quot; all of which could easily have been produced back in 1999. &quot;Another Woman,&quot; though not as gospel in tone, does have that R&amp;B flavor to it, and &quot;I'm Not Worried At All&quot; reminds a lot of &quot;Natural Blues&quot; both due to the lead vocals and to the overall spirit of the song and the lyrics. The New Wave-y opening track, &quot;We Are All Made of Stars&quot; and &quot;Extreme Ways&quot; both have that super-hit flavor for '18' that &quot;Porcelain&quot; and &quot;Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad&quot; brought to 'Play' but it mixes some elements which are somewhat alien to Moby's music (except for the &quot;element&quot; of eclecticism). On the other hand, &quot;Great Escape,&quot; &quot;Sunday (The Day Before My Birthday)&quot; (consider his b-day is 9/11) and &quot;Harbour&quot; all have one thing in common: beautiful female vocals (surprise tip: &quot;Harbour&quot; has Sinead O'Connor on vocals).<br />Finally, tracks such as &quot;Signs of Love,&quot; &quot;Fireworks,&quot; &quot;18,&quot; &quot;Sleep Alone&quot; and &quot;Look Back&quot; bring into the mix that exquisite ambient sound that tunes such as &quot;Down Slow,&quot; &quot;Everloving&quot; and &quot;The Sky Is Broken&quot; were so special for. The tracks I could easily live without: &quot;Jam For The Ladies,&quot; &quot;At Least We Tried,&quot; &quot;The Rafters,&quot; so, as far as I'm concerned, the album could be called '15.' Overall, obviously the album doesn't break much new ground, as 'Play' did, but it stands out as a very good work by NY's finest DJ.und that tunes such as &quot;Down Slow,&quot; &quot;Everloving&quot; and &quot;The Sky Is Broken&quot; were so special for.

B000002IQ9|3.0|I'm not a huge Phil Collins fan; some of his songs on here (&quot;A Groovy Kind of Love&quot; and &quot;Can't Hurry Love&quot;) are enough to make me puke, but there is some good stuff to be found. In particular, &quot;Another Day In Paradise&quot; and &quot;In the Air Tonight&quot; are great, great songs. To find them both on the same CD is a big plus. Unfortunately, since this was a concert, the audience's clapping and cheering through so much of many of the songs ruins the mood and the emotion they would otherwise induce. But if you don't mind live performances, go for it.

B00000AFDW|1.0|Disappointing. I haven't listened to this album since I bought it. Yes, I like Kiss, But this album just doesn't do anything for me. They should have recorded another &quot;Destroyer&quot;, &quot;Rock And Roll Over&quot;, etc, But this is not the case here. Save your money.
0441172717|5.0|I've always been a fantasy fan...I enjoy reading Jordan, Tolkein, etc.  All of these books created a world from basic ideas.  Herbert does much of the same...Dune is a desert land that requires a hard existence.  The Fremen, people that naturally habit this land, are a troubled people that exist for nothing more than to create life from nothing.  Paul, the main character, is adopted by these people, and becomes their spiritual leader.  It is a good story that is very origonal (I haven't read any other story that compares).  I find that as you read fantasy books, many of the ideas presented by todays top writers are borrowed from one another (just written in a different way, with different characters).  I don't know about you, but this gets old after a while.<br />Anyways, I started reading dune 5 years after I bought the book.  I had tried reading the story many times over those five years, but I'd get lost or disinterested in the story because of all the made up language, philosophical mumbo jumbo, and from the fact that basically, the book starts out slow.  After getting through the first 50 to 100 pages, the story becomes very involved and very real.  It was written very well.  I understand why this is the highest selling sci-fi of all time.  <br />For those that enjoy fantasy, this book is clasified as a sci-fi, but really, it is in between.  It doesn't have the space-flying-fighting juck that i normally would associate with a sci-fi novel.  It's definitally worth the money and the time. Buy this book.  You'll enjoy it.
0375701427|4.0|One of the knocks on this book, even from reviewers who have liked it, is that it trivializes the rebellious spirit of the 1960s through the screeching lunacy of Merry Levov. There were countless examples of logical, righteous, nonviolent protest, they argue, and by showing only the thoughtless Merry and her equally deranged companion, Rita Cohen, along with the destruction of the Newark race riots (carried out by blacks who, Swede Levov seems to think, are just being ungrateful), Philip Roth comes off as someone who missed the decade altogether, perhaps in seclusion doing research for Portnoy's Complaint.<br /><br />I think, however, that Roth's one-maybe-two-dimensional portrayal of Merry and the other revolutionary forces of the '60s was precisely the point. This novel was not so much about the turbulent '60s as it was about the disintegration of the '50s. The story is narrated by Nathan Zuckerman and told through the (imagined) eyes of Swede Levov, both of whom graduated high school before 1950. Roth is not only concerned with the collapse of the Swede's American dream, but also with his assimilation into American society, his pursuit and eventual attainment of the American dream -- all typical characterstics of the '50s. The Swede had no concept of the attributes which we typically ascribe to the '60s. He was too busy worrying about how to make the perfect lady's dress glove. The reason Roth did so much research and wrote in such painstaking detail about the glove industry was to tell the reader precisely what Lou and Swede Levov's lives revolved around. Since the Swede is the only character whom we see others through, of course he isn't going to question himself for being concerned with such things as D rings and piece rates. It's up to the readers to draw the inference that maybe, just maybe, the Swede is out of touch and too concerned with materialism and achieving the perfect life. This is not necessarily a terrible thing by itself.<br /><br />What Roth aims to do is not to paint a 100 percent historically accurate portrait of the '60s, but instead to illustrate what a horror the '60s looked like to someone who was not a participant in the counterculture movement -- to someone who had something to lose. The best way to do that was to take the worst of that counterculture movement -- self-absorbed adolescents who raged against their successful upbringing in order to conform to the growing popularity of the rebellion -- and spill it onto the page, to show how berserk this decade was to someone who was in no way trained for it. To show how justified, cool-headed and rational some parts of the '60s revolution were would have detracted from an integral theme of the book, as imagined by the Swede: He learned \\"the worst lesson that life can teach -- that it makes no sense.\\"<br /><br />Also, keep in mind that Zuckerman is the book's narrator, and he is imagining nearly all of the story. He is trying, somehow, to make sense of the Swede's tragedy. It's possible that Merry really had a few more redeeming characteristics than is written, and than Jerry Levov says she did. The best way to make sense of tragedy sometimes is to say the whole world is crazy, and maybe that's what Zuckerman did, turning Merry into a raving lunatic in order to show that there was nothing the Swede could do to save her or himself. What Roth has done, with Zuckerman's help, is something along the lines Tim O'Brien talked about in his novel The Things They Carried -- to create a story that is emotionally true, if not entirely factually true.<br /><br />At its core, this novel is an allegory, with the Swede representing the all-too-perfect 1950s and Merry the tumultuous, unexplainable '60s. In order to get across the full effect of this gulf, Roth had to show the '60s at their worst.<br /><br />EDIT: I hadn't really looked at this review in a long time, then noticed a comment from a year and a half ago that (rightly) called me out for racist phrasing thatmade it sound like I was saying the black population of Newark was being ungrateful. I've edited it to reflect that I thought that Swede is the one who was thinking this, not me. It was very poor phrasing, but that phrasing was due to me not being nearly racially aware enough to realize it was poor phrasing, so I'm not going to blame a glitch in the writing. It came from me, and I'm sorry.

While commenting on the condition of the social classes, the author manages to instruct and charm the reader; carefully weaving honesty and naivet together to reveal the experience of the `miserable Irish-Catholic childhood'.

0064407667|5.0|Okay first off This is now my favorite series and yes I have read loads of books so don't judge me that quick. I used to like Harry Potter a lot I still do BUT the books in the series take so long to come out and I am tired of waiting and hearing that the date has been put farther in the year!!! Anyway I love this author's type of writing, the book has a great plot not one book in the series is boring either!!! It has plenty of plot twists, mysteries, and some intense suspensful parts. It has kind of a twisted humor to it but that is what makes it so great. Stop reading this and go buy this book it is so cool!!!!!<br />Other recommendations:Harry Potter, Dealing with dragons,the giver. I know these books are completely different than the bad beginning but they are awesome just go read!!!!!!!!!!!!!
630575067X|4.0|The Menace is a seed, a root to a larger more intense story set about by Lucas.  What most people have forgotten about Lucas is that he is a genius.  He is flexible...and has not changed as a director.  The same comical, creative, dark atmospheres that he created in the original trilogy do occur in the Menace.  <br />The Menace is a plant creator.  It sets the story for the second trilogy and is necessary.  It contains the Gungans, an underwater tribe not unlike the Ewoks.  It contains Tatooine, a city captured by beauty and originally unscarred by evil that sets the tone for what will be a much darker galaxy.  I suggest you notice this movie for its ability to be an elaborate plant with surreal flowers.

B00005UEAR|5.0|Dream Theater - keeping progressive rock alive! And for those of you who cannot deal with odd time signatures, 100% of the music on the radio should meet you needs--go there and give us a break. 1,2,3,4...<br />Anyone who does not like this CD probably buys only hip-hop albums. Nothing against hop-hop...even though I am completely hip-hopped out, as is everyone else by now-I suspect. I mean, how many more towel waving, women bashing, crotch-grabbing street thugs can we take? Hmmm...all in the name of Music. <br />I am so sick of the record companies selling, marketing, encouraging, and cultivating CRAP music--one-hit wonders designed to illustrate the latest in pop culture with no regard for musical talent or direction. What to wear, what body part to pierce, what tattoo to sport, how to defile women, etc...<br />Somewhat recently I heard the CEO of the recording industry (I think it was...at the Grammy's...paraphrasing badly here, I apologize) comment that record sales are at an all time low because the relationship between the artist and the fan is strained. He went on to indicate that this incredibly vital relationship is strained because of music \\"piracy\\" accomplished with programs like Napster (and Kazaa). I might add, a very impassioned little speech.<br />I contend that this man's assumption is generally correct--the relationship between the artist and the fan IS, in fact, strained. However, I believe the relationship is strained, not because of Napster/Kazaa/WinMX, but because the record industry no longer CULTIVATES talent with LONGEVITY in mind. <br />The record industry no longer CULTIVATES talent with LONGEVITY in mind.<br />The recording industry is only concerned about this year's hit makers with no regard for the future and no regard for its aging \\"potential\\" consumers. How many of you have purchased a CD with one good song on it lately? I suspect everyone has and I contend that the rate of these types of purchases is increasing-ALARMINGLY. This stemsfrom the simple fact that the record industry no longer CARES about the relationship between the artist and the fan. In the end, we all lose-turn on the radio or MTV these days.<br />Bands like Dream Theater are keeping (honest) Progressive Rock alive and well much the same way their predecessors did. Bands like Rush, who deserve the highest praise for their musical integrity, may not even make into the Rock N Roll Hall of Fame. So be it...<br />To the recording industry:<BR>People are living longer, better smack your marketing weenies on the head and start tapping into the \\"right\\" market...those of us with money are willing to spend, provided you give us bands that stand the test of time...bands like Dream Theater, Rush, and U2. Until then, I suspect that record sales will plummet. Why should I buy one of your one-hit-towel-waving-tattoo-on-the-eye-ring-in-the-face CD's when I can download the ONE good song for free? <br />Answer that Mr. CEO.
B000002UAX|5.0|This album is often criticized by the critics and the public for being too prolix. I think to some degree it is the length of the album that is responsible for keeping many of the songs less known to the general public (at least less known than the songs on Abbey Road, Revolver, Let It Be, etc, etc). I would definitely have to say that the White Album has some of the Beatles finest work. Aside from Ringo's absurd &quot;Don't Pass Me By&quot; and the eternally annoying &quot;Ob-la-di, Ob-la-da&quot;, none of the album is dross. The little McCartney tunes like &quot;Honey Pie&quot; and &quot;Martha My Dear&quot; are just fine. But the gold of the album is mostly Lennon's. He reached a peak of morbidly psychedelic songwriting on the White Album. For proof look no further than &quot;Happiness is a Warm Gun&quot;, but the darkness of that song is actually spread throughout all four sides of the album. Perhaps the most overlooked Lennon song is &quot;Cry Baby Cry&quot;, which in my opinion is a masterpiece. Anyhow, this album is indeed monumental in status. Highly recommended.
B000059RL3|5.0|Marvin Gaye once said that God was speaking through him when he wrote and recorded What's Going On. This Deluxe Edition of the original release is the living proof of that statement.<br />In addition to the original recording of the album, the first disc includes \\"A Detroit Mix\\" of the album from beginning to end. The result is an immersing and spirtual musical experience. The second disc includes live performances of the album tracks as well as other Marvin Gaye classics. We get to hear a live performance of the music from this album at the time of its release. Given the social message of the work and how it was received at the time, the live recording adds a fascinating dimension to the mythology around it.<br />Through this deluxe edition we can see that WGO was the product of a musical genius who was in the midst of a spiritual awakening and a creative catharsis. It shows what a cultural AND personal achievement this record was for one of the all time legends of music.

You gotta play this album when you are feeling blue, when you need encouragement, when you want to be alone... 24 X 7, \\"18\\" will give you great satisfaction.  \\"18\\" makes you feel like cleansing your soiled mind & soul (feels like it does).  \\"18\\" will lift up your spirit better& higher.  \\"18\\" contains MOBY's Philosophy that (his work, 18) will not let you down and that is awsome.

B00003W8NM|5.0|Blood, Guts and Gore!<br />Now that I've got your attention, here's the ultimate fight movie with more twists than an Olympic gymnast.  Two great young actors, in Edward Norton and Brad Pitt both could have competed for screen presence in an attempt to out do each other.  As two class professional would, the quality of the film is the most important result, not each others ego.  They are great together.  Fight Club isn't for the faint of heart.  There is a tremendous amount of graphic violence, some might consider unnecessary.  The end result still is a great movie; just view it for what it is, and don't watch it because of the leads.  They're out of character and to some it will be disappointing.  It's bloody and graphic.  Definitely not for kids!
B00005A1PR|5.0|After having bought Alicia Keys and learning that India Arie had more grammy nominations, I couldn't resist finding out why.  I bought the CD without hearing one song of hers.  Wow, did I get lucky!<br />The song selections showcase her beautiful voice, which is a mix of the soft, sultry and playful.  The refreshing remix of Stevie Wonder's &quot;Wonderful&quot; is a perfect way to end the debut release. The lyrics flow easily from song to song and before you know it, the music stops.  Don't worry, you'll hit play again. <br />All I have to say is, &quot;When can I buy the next one?&quot;
B0000668IF|3.0|18 just sounded too much like Play for my taste.  Although I liked Play, I was expecting something more from 18, and I just didn't get it.
B00004RF83|4.0|Books used to drive films, and this was from a political thriller popular at the time, one of a set, along with \\"Fail Safe\\" and \\"The Best Man\\".  The task was to strip the film down to the essentials to fit into a two hour (or less) time slot, which is about all 1960's era audiences could go without a cigarette, and get it out while the book was still recent.  The script is crisp, the dialogue to the point, the characters few, and the sets are the minimum necessary to get it produced, more like a play on film than a modern movie.  This is a movie you can listen to as well as watch.  <br />But even though the intent was to do business, not make art, films like this turned out to be definitive.  They were made so professionally well that it would be pointless to remake them again; witness disasters like the recent remake of \\"Fail Safe\\", a close cousin to this movie.  Maybe we don't have the broad spectrum of talent that was available then, or maybe we've just run out of stories, but it seems like the earliest tellings in movie history usually turned out the best; does anyone really think that Scrooge was ever played better than Alistair Sims, for example?<br />Anyway, I've seen it enough times to memorize the dialogue, and while I don't champion it as a great film in any sense, it seems to find my DVD player a few times a year still, and I always enjoy it.
0446310786|4.0|In Harper Lee's novel To Kill A Mockingbird, two young children experience the first hand effects of racism.  Scout, a tomboy, and her older brother are being brought up in a Southern town in the early 1900's during a very controversial trial.  A black man has been accused of assaulting a young, white woman who lives in town.  Scout's father, a lawyer, is appointed to defend the black man in a trial that the town thinks is unnecessary.  The author gets the point across that everyone but Scout's father knows the black man is guilty.  Scout and her older brother are put in a situation where the whole town turns against them because of their father's decision.  The trial is the main focus of the novel, which has some very interesting and plot changing turns throughout it.  <BR> Racism has always been an issue in American history.  This book represents a voice that could not be heard in the early 1900's.  African-Americans were often accused of crimes they did not commit, but were still convicted only because they were black.  Many were not as lucky as the black man in this novel, since his accusation at least got him a trial with a white lawyer who truly believed his innocence.  In the novel, the entire town presumed the man was guilty before his trial because of their own ignorance.  The people in the town get the opportunity to learn diversity and tolerance that starts to show up toward the end of the novel.<BR> I would recommend this novel to any person who can pick up a book and read.  This book serves many purposes both educationally and morally.  Presented by a female narrator, the book was a first of many kinds.  Harper Lee took a very broad topic and created one story of the direct effects discrimination can bring on a town.  I would highly recommend this book not only as pleasure reading but also for educational and cultural awareness.  This book depicts a very accurate and descriptive account of how racism was a major part of every Americans' past.
B00003CWRX|5.0|The Insider is Russell Crowe's precursor to the Gladiator.  Watching Crowe in Insider and the Gladiator is a true display of the brilliance of this young actor.  The Insider brings you two of the best actors in history in Al Pacino, my selection for the #4 spot of best actors of all time.  (Crowe, although still needing more films under his belt, comes in at #20.)  The Insider shows how corporate profit out weight the well-being of the people.  Knowing their product (tobacco) is habit forming and deadly, the giants use everything within their means to crush and discredit the informer and attempt to control the media. As a member of the media, it is embarrassing to see how CBS coward under pressure only to have Bergman and Wigand push harder to do the honorable thing.  They will bring the evidence to the public.  The Insider is well written and the acting from all including Christopher Plummer is fantastic.  The script and Michael Mann's direction is great, no surprise it received 7 Academy Award nominations including best picture.  This movie is a keepsake, not since Heat and the Godfather have moviegoers had the opportunity to see two of the best actors in film together.
B000009QPQ|5.0|Probably not. But I cant think of many albums that I've played more often than this one, over a longer period of time. I often hear the Jayhawks compared to the Beatles. and in many ways the songs on this album remind me of &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;. However, I find this album to be more soulful, especially the lead guitar playing. I'll also take &quot;I'd Run Away&quot; and &quot;Bad Time&quot; over any two songs off Rubber Soul. The bottom line is that there is not a single bad song on &quot;Tomorrow the Green Grass&quot;, and is worth checking out if you havnt discovered this band yet.
B00005B36H|4.0|This CD is a regualr Tool CD. An album that makes you think, a sound party. Their music is probably some of the most technologically advanced in all fields of music. I mean you even have to think to get to the CD itself. But once you put that in your stereo and press play, my God you will be blown away.<br />This was my first Tool CD (and won't be the last) and I am completely blown away by this band. I have heard of them for a quite awhile, but first heard their music on MTV2 when they played Schism. That track is my personal favorite, but all others are good. Even the little intermissions between the 7-8 minute songs on Lateralus. They can get hard at times, but I believe that they are better when they are hard and break songs down. In these types of songs, they are part acoustic, and part metal. But don't sleep on this album, or any of theirs for that matter!

0783225881|5.0|If you believe the impossible, the incredible can come true.<br />&quot;If you build it, he will come.&quot;  Those words have become part of our vocabulary, words of inspiration for each of us to enjoy. Those words inspired Iowa farmer Ray Kinsella though a voice he can't ignore to pursue a dream he can hardly believe.  There are lessons to learn. Field of Dreams is an enjoyable and inspiring movie to share with all children. Parents sit with your children and share the magic!  It will be a wonderful couple of hours together.
630587493X|5.0|This film was sadly overlooked upon its release in 1999 (I was one who overlooked it).  The film needs to be seen: it is a true epic, spanning not only the 21st century, but ultimately moving into the 23rd!<br />The production works on many levels.  Robin Williams' robot character benefits from the technology (our present day technology) that has resulted in his manufacture -- and, ultimately, that careening technology enables him to become incrementally more human-like. Of course, the humans are simultaneously becoming incrementally more bionic, another result of the technology.<br />The screenplay is quite engaging.  Andrew (the android) immediately develops a fascinating relationship with his &quot;owner&quot;, a character he calls &quot;Mister&quot;, played quite well by Sam Neill.  Since Andrew is more or less immortal, as the decades move along in steady progression, he is later depicted as relating meaningfully with Mister's children, grandchildren --and great-grandchild. All the while, Andrew is incessantly learning, &quot;growing&quot;, and evolving.  Indeed, the theme of evolution is central to the unfolding of the story.  We witness the evolution of society as well, in the background -- and what a fascinating vision it is.  Negativity and antagonism seem to be evaporating in this intriguingly depicted future life.<br />As a Northern Californian I was delighted to see what was done with San Francisco, for example.  Two hundred years from now the cable cars are completely unchanged. The Golden Gate Bridge is instantly recognizable, despite that fact that it now has an upper deck!  The world-famous Glide Memorial Cathedral is quite the same, though now surrounded by a neighborhood that is spectacularly futurized.  The film's special effects are magnificent and beyond criticism.<br />Few actors are sufficiently nimble to handle the role that seems completely natural for Robin Williams.  Great performance!<br />If you have not seen &quot;Bicentennial Man,&quot; you are in for a treat!<br />Four and a half stars, to be exact.u are in for a treat!<BR>Four and a half stars, to be exact.
B00005B3Z6|2.0|I love american version of QAF. british one is horrible. same story but UGLY actors /most of them/ can not even act! no special future on this OVERPRICED dvd. the best thing from this double dvd set is probably commercial for tv station. lol
B00005R2M3|5.0|THIS CD IS THE ONE OF THE BEST CDS EVER MADE, AND I LOVED EVERY SINGLE SONG! ALL THAT STUFF ABOUT NOT BEING ABLE TO BE USED IN A SONY CD PLAYER IS JUNK! I HAVE A SONY CD PLAYER AND IT WORKS GREAT! GOODBYE!
B00005UQ9F|4.0|This movie depends on ppl with an imagination. It is suspensful and not just another cheap thrill. It had an original story line and it had a great twist. Ppl are so used to watching stupid mindless films like 13 ghosts that they cannot tolerate or comprehend a movie that involves thinking. I really enjoyed this film. I would rate it up there with Sixth sense and the original Psyco.
0446678430|2.0|This was my first (and last) reading of this series.  Kiyosaki is a great motivational writer when you can get beyond his miserable grammar.  There was way too much hype and not enough substance!  He really doesn't give any of his 'secrets' away.  He does, however, tell a story about how he made fantastic returns 'without any money'.  It's BS because, as he admits, tho not in an apparent context, that he had to have enough collateral (about $40k) to cover himslf, had his hedge failed.  Hmmmm....<br />Further, I think it's contrived.  He starts the book in '84 or so  saying he 'can't' do what he says is most important:  change his thinking to retire rich beyond his wildest dreams.  He goes through a long-winded story about how his friend had to convince him.  Contradicting this, throughout the book, he's saying in retrospect, how he was realizing how important what 'Rich Dad' had taught him was, etc. as he's being exposed to it.  So which is it?  Did he learn this stuff from '84 or so on, or was he really following it throughout his life and needed another book to help him retire rich?
0312955006|4.0|I read this book because it got a favorable mention in Frank Bruni's book about George W. Bush, Ambling Into History, and I enjoyed it while I was reading it, but I have to say I was a little underwhelmed by it overall.  I thought the character development was good, but not great.  I thought the story was good, but maybe a little formulaic.  I have no major criticism for the book, but I didn't enjoy it enough to make me want to start another Connelly book soon, if at all.  <br />If you are a huge murder mysteries fan, you'll probably like this book just fine.  If, like me, you're a fan of excellent murder mysteries, you may also find that this one is not at all bad, but not excellent.
0671027344|5.0|Just finshed today! And boy, if you want a book you can relate to, this is it. No doubt. Drugs, sex, friends, music, and alcohol all play an important part in everyone's life and Charlie (me and the main character, same name, no relation) is no different. It has given me new insights on things and opened me to new experiences. It has made me feel, as Charlie would say, infinite.
0066620996|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read for a long time. The author proposes to study more than 1500 good companies and select criteria which would make a good company GREAT. Companies and their CEOs, in general, are more than ever focused on making money without making decent products or providing good service. They might be viable in the short time, but never became great in long range. The great companies, however, prospered because they did both.<br />The book illustrates a few basic points worth remmbering:<br />#1. The CEO should work for the company, and not the other way around.<BR>#2. He should look for the right people, instead of filling his Board with friends or cronies in order to have total control of the company.<BR>#3. The company should have discipline: disciplined people, thought and action.<BR>#4. The company should have basic core values.<br />If all the companies just follow a few of these rules, they not only would be immensely successful, but also won't have to fudge their books.
B00005JKBC|4.0|This is the most underarted spy movie of our times. Its a well made, well narrated movie packed with really cool plots and action. But somehow it got lost in the aftermath of 9/11. Otherwise, to all those spy thriller fans, this a movie to watch. Both Brad Pitt and Robert Redford do justice to their characters.
1558908382|4.0|This is an offbeat, black comedy about a hit man, Martin Blank (John Cusack), who is undergoing some personal angst about his career choice. He sees a psychiatrist, Dr. Oatman (Alan Arkin), who, once he becomes aware of his patient's profession, wants nothing more to do with him. Moreover, a most unlikely, rival hit man (Dan Ackroyd) is on his tail, looking to clear the field of a potential rival.<br />What's a conflicted hit man to do? Why go to his tenth year high school reunion in Grosse Pointe, Michigan, of course. There, \\"Marty\\" plans to do his final hit and hook up with his high school sweetheart, Debi Newberry (Minnie Driver), whom he unceremoniously stood up on prom night, ten years earlier. Once he gets there, however, things do not go according to plan, and \\"Marty\\" is in store for a few surprises.<br />John Cusack is terrific as the hit man, playing him with just the right blend of sangfroid cool and, at other times, with all the charm of the boy next door. Dan ackroyd is funny as the unlikely, rival hit man. Alan Arkin is excellent as the shrink who does not want \\"Marty\\" as his patient. Minnie Driver is the least compelling of those cast in this film, as she adds very little to its success. Joan Cusack, John Cusack's real life sibling, more than makes up for the gap left by Driver, however, as she infuses the role of Marcella, \\"Marty's\\" gal friday, with enough pizazz to shore up the film.<br />All in all this is a surprisingly entertaining film. Unfortunately, the DVD offers next to nothing by way of special features.  Do not, however, let this deter you from buying this funny and unusual film.
B00005MP58|4.0|when people hear that i have actually watched a six hour miniseries of pride and prejudice, they think i am nuts, but honestly this one is worth it. it really is true to jane austen.  while at times the acting is not exactly the most superior, it is still really great.  even if you haven't read the book, it's still worth it, although i would recommend reading the book first (obviously).  although minor things every here and there are changed, it really is not too drastic. the premise of the miniseries is the famous love story between elizabeth bennet (prejudice) and mr. darcy (pride).  their pride and prejudice prevents them from being together. it also has a lot of social satire. but really, the characters in the movie are exactly as i pictured them in the book. colin firth is mr. darcy all in all. i really couldn't think of anyone better. i also must say mrs. bennet was great comic relief throughout the movie.  but although its six hours, it never lags. and it does go a bit quicker than reading the whole book again.  gives me a little &quot;boost&quot; :-). but honestly, its good. i highly recommend it to almost anyone. if british movies are not your thing, don't bother.
B00001QEE5|3.0|I've been making a point of re-watching all the Disney classics from my youth and commenting on them with adult eyes. It's been a very interesting experience, and PETER PAN is no exception.<br />What stands out are all the elements Disney wouldn't dare put in an animated film today...like the carefree knife play and the pirate who Captian Hook picks off with his hand gun. But by and large, the whole fire engine red faced \\"injun\\" scene is pretty amazing. Prune-faced and hook-nosed, the red man hits every stereotype in the book...and it just goes on and on.<br />While we're all familiar with the story of PETER PAN, I had no recollection the whole thing was essentially motivated by jealous females. Tinkerbell is jealous of Wendy. The mermaids are jealous of Wendy. Wendy is jealous of Tigerlily. Jealous Tinkerbell sells Peter out (at least Tigerlily was smart enough to keep her mouth shut). All are vying for Peter's attention, and he's near oblivious to the lot of it.<br />And Peter, in my opinion, is kind of an unlikable jerk (along with the retarded lost boys). A wise-guy, who pouts and listens to no one, he turns on his best friend, Tinkerbell, and banishes her forever, making the effort to reconcile only when he thinks she's about to die. At one point, I was kind of hoping Captian Hook would at least get one good shot in.<br />It's an all right piece of animation, better than SNOW WHITE and far better than ALICE IN WONDERLAND...but not nearly as good as JUNGLE BOOK, which is by far my Disney favorite. PETER PAN lands somewhere between SNOW WHITE and ROBIN HOOD on my scale. With the most enjoyable parts involving the hungry crocodile or Wendy's littlest brother (who's really cute).
B000002OHF|3.0|Listening to Wishbone Four after completely having forgotten about it for nearly 25 years, I discovered my long-held suspicions were confirmed: Wishbone Ash exemplifies the archetypical boogie band portrayed in Cameron Crowe's infamously hilarious &quot;Almost Famous.&quot;  In other words, Wishbone Four is so thoroughly Seventies that it's amazing the album has escaped public notice for as long as it has. Aside from the dated production value--sadly, the album hasn't been re-mastered, an oversight that results in a muted, sometimes muddy sound--Wishbone Four is practically a primer for what actually occurred in &quot;hard rock&quot; during an era most tend to associate with its arch nemisis: disco.<br />Many songs in Wishbone Four seem precursors to sounds honed by latter groups like Bad Company, Foreigner and Bob Seeger's Silver Bullet Band.  There are also similarities to the Grateful Dead, early Fleetwood Mac and even King Crimson to be heard in Wishbone's first of several failed attempts to become a singles band.  Unlike Wishbone's previous three recordings, songs are shorter and often catchier as well.  But this attempt to shift from extended improvizations to rifs filled with hooks doubtless contributes to a number of problems that force listeners to focus on Wishbone's uneven songwriting rather than exquisite musicianship, its primary advantage.  Gone are the long-winded wendings through dreamy instrumental soundscapes, and unfortunately the outcome also forces listeners to compare Wishbone with groups known for sharper songwriting.<br />Some listeners may decide that Wishbone Four seems dated, and in some ways it's true. Wishbone Ash was so influential during its early-Seventies reign that details like the structure of guitar solos, the outcome of various distortion techniques and vocal inflections that have next to nothing to do with emulating black singing create the illusion that this is something you've heard before.  Most likely, however, Wishbone Ash--always known in its heyday as a trend-setter and experimenter--was the first group to employ these tactics.
B000002UDB|3.0|Well, now it's time to review the soundtracks. I guess that you have to see the film to really like the music. Some of the stuff is ok, but I don't like Flying. It's too much like their stuff from Sgt.Pepper's. But there are some gems. Fool On The Hill is a nice ballad, and the title track is weird. I Am The Walrus is a bit overrated, but the extended version of the album helps. Hello Goodbye and All You Need Is Love are my favorite singles. This is good for the average Beatles fan.
B0000636UN|3.0|I'm a huge fan of Sheryl Crow.  Her &quot;Globe Sessions&quot; and self-titled CDs are masterpieces of effective and varied songwriting (as well as performance), and I can still listen to them over and over without finding them tiresome.  No other contemporary female singer/songwriter that I know of is doing anything comparable to these two albums, in my opinion.<br />Having said that, I have to confess that &quot;C'mon, C'mon&quot; is, by comparison, fairly ordinary.  It's not bad, and I still have it in my player in my car, but it lacks the spark that made EVERY TRACK on the previous two albums extraordinary in my view.  Not every album can be equally inspired, and I don't hold that against her. But I do hope that, on future CDs, she will overcome a possible sense of insecurity about her age, and about her place in the contemporary music world, and simply be true to herself and her exceptional songwriting instincts.
B000002UB6|4.0|Why does everyone badmouth this album? Ok, it's not their best, but it's not their worst either! This contains some great gems like Two Of Us, Get Back, and Across The Universe, as well as some unkown classics like I Me Mine, For You Blue, and Dig A Pony. Ok, Phil Spector overdid it with the horns and strings, but that doesn't mean every song is bad. Even Maggie Mae is great!(Though it's a bit short.)Personally, I think it goes up there with Rubber Soul, and it's a perfect last album. Some people just don't understand. But, there are some bad ones. Dig It could've been great, and The Long And Winding Road is just plain..ugh. But it's not a bad album. Oh well.
B0000047CX|3.0|I love this album, but when the recording studios decided to do a remastering of the original, I went out to purchase it. WHAT A DUD!!! The only songs worth listening to are \\"Girl from Ipanema\\", \\"So Danco Samba\\", and \\"Desafinado\\". LOTS OF HISS NOISES AND OTHER NASTY STUFF. Not worth the purchase for this one. I hope they decide to do another remastering.
B00005S8FC|4.0|just like saint germain pumped up the jazz these guys pump up the tango...it still does have the classical tango feel, yet it is so close to being french<BR>the cd is good, it needed two or three more tracks
B00005RY7X|4.0|This album isn't what you'd think. You hear a name such as Andrew W.K., and you think, \\"Oh great, another boy band.\\", but oh, how you are wrong. <br />Andrew W.K is a fresh 80's style metal band that is just breaking out. Their CD, \\"I Get Wet\\", was released March 26, 2002 in the US. It was released earlier in the UK since the band played more shows there first. <br />The band is headed by Andrew W.K. himself. Not only does he do lead vocals, but all the songs on the album were written by himself on a piano. He writes, sings, and PLAYS piano and keyboards on this album. He's backed up by guitarists Jimmy Coup, \\"E. Pain\\", and \\"Sgt. Frank\\"; bassist Gregg; and drummer D.T. Nonetheless a colorful crowd of indiviuals. <br />The music on the CD isn't very diverse. Nor are the lyrics. They stick to cliched 80's metal riffs, however, a new 'hard edge' voice is put over it, creating a sound SUPRISINGLY not created by any other notable artist. The lyrics don't stray away from the 80's at all either. All about partying, girls, and drugs. Minus the drugs, and for the most part, girls. This CD really only tries to get across one message, 'Party, party the hardest, and never stop'. <br />The catchy lyrics and riffs are best displayed in tracks such as \\"Party Hard\\" and \\"I Love NYC\\". However, they stray away a BIT from the party theme on tracks \\"She is Beautiful\\" and \\"Ready To Die\\". These two tracks are just as catchy as others on the album, and rock all the way. They even incorporate some sounds that you might find in a Super Nintendo game, and trust me, they work. <br />As said, the CD is very catchy in the lyrics and riffs. If you listen to it while you drive, or when you're 'partying hard', then you'll probably keep listening to it. However, I'd figure if you listen to it regularly and listen to it often, you will get sick of it, like anything else. <br />To sum, I can't say this is the best CD I've ever heard. Most likely far from it. However, while cliched, it brings back something that is nice to get a glimpse of. The lyrics and the music are a nice change from hearing about so called love through the majority of modern music. It's about having a good time, and 'A.W.K' sure knows how to keep it rocken.
B000060P79|5.0|Simple plan is the greatest!! they r sooo awsome...the singer has and amazing voice! get there cd...and they'll be on tour..go check em out!! there soooo great!! and there all pretty hott 2!! lol
B00004STPT|5.0|A really stunning soundtrack featuring memorable passages and tunes that cover a gamut of emotions, from battle-panic and chaos to pride and awe to grief and sorrow, sometimes fast and furious and pounding, other times haunting and ethereal. The music compliments many different scenes in the movie so well but the truth is that it transcends the movie and plays like a soundtrack to all our highs and lows in life.<BR>Dramatic passages played with throbbing drums and horns that fire the blood juxtapose with dreamy, distant-sounding pieces featuring a liquid, mesmeric background voice singing foreign words that transport you far beyond the place you are in. <BR>The best music is music that stirs one's soul and, dramatic that it sounds, this music did for me. Music of the Spheres indeed.<BR>I highly recommend it.
B00005TT77|4.0|Being a major Beatles fan, I am never ever fond of the idea of someone covering their compositions. Lennon and McCartney remain one of the best songwriting duos of our lifetime, and hearing their songs slaughtered is always disheartening. The Beatles were amazing musicians, and no one can ever perform their work and ever expect to come close to that kind of perfection.<br />That being said, the soundtrack for &quot;I Am Sam&quot; was for the most part rather impressive. Amiee Mann and Micheal Penn's rendition of &quot;Two of Us&quot; was a pleasant way to begin the album. They sound great together and it is an amusing cover of this song from Let It Be. I also enjoyed Rufus Wainwright's version of &quot;Across the Universe&quot;...it is a beautiful Lennon piece that will always remain a favorite of mine. Sarah McLaughlin sounds beautiful on &quot;Blackbird&quot;. I also am a huge fan of Ben Folds, and enjoyed his take on &quot;Golden Slumbers&quot;. The efforts of Eddie Vedder, Ben Harper, Sheryl Crow, the Wallflowers, the Stereophonics, and the Black Crowes were also valiant.<br />BUT...<br />What happened to the second half of this thing?? It's just disgusting!! Can I begin with &quot;Julia&quot;? What a disgrace! It is always best to perform Beatle songs in their original style...that way people won't be so revolted and angry when they hear what you have done to beautiful music. &quot;Julia&quot; is by and large the worst on the album. The awful version of &quot;Revolution&quot; almost rivals it however. Howie Day, Paul Westerberg, and Nick Cave could have honestly done better. Heather Nova? Let's just leave her for the Dawson's Creek soundtracks, okay?<br />Despite the last few horrors, the soundtrack isn't half bad. It is a wonderful start, I am just sorry that they couldn't finish that way.
B00005JKCF|5.0|When I heard that Spider-man was going out in theaters, I didn't really expect a great movie. After all, the current adaptations haven't been the best in the world; Harry Potter, for example, was a huge let-down because of the enormous missing chunks and dullness. I've been a Spider-man fan for as long as I can remember, and I guess I didn't want to see some director screw up my favorite super hero's reputation by making a below-average movie. I'm just that kind of girl who can't stand a disappointment. And so, on opening day, I listened to my friends talk about how they wanted to see the movie so badly, and when they asked if I wanted to go with them, I refused the offer. But one of the movie-goers later told me it was an excellent movie and I should watch with him (he wanted to watch it again. I was surprised) again. And so I did, and my reaction was one of pure amazement.<br />First of all, the casting is excellent. Tobey Maguire made a great Spider-man, much to my surprise. He played Peter Parker like Peter Parker should be. I don't mean the sharp-tongued witty sort of guy most super heroes are, but just a regular person who, of course, can mess up. He was able to make most of us cry, laugh, or just stare in awe at the person who had turned a 2D character into someone real. I thought Kirsten Dunst wasn't the right type of person for the part of M.J., but she played the role pretty well. Her little speech at the end was corny and mushy, and I didn't like that too much. The Green Goblin was the best of the actors and actresses. When you watch him, you can see that he isn't acting out his part well; he IS his part. His face even looks like an evil person! I thought the costume was a bit like something that would scare a 6-year old, but anyhow ... I really hated the people who would go, \\"Oh! It's Spider-man!\\" or a stupid line like, \\"Oh gee! What's that in the sky?\\" It got really annoying after a while and I was thinking, \\"Yes it's Spider-man, you idiots.\\" The peoplein this movie were great nevertheless, whether they made the audience laugh, scream, cry, or fall off (or jump out of) their seats.<br />The plot was a bit off. It's just sort of the regular good against evil sort of theme and everyone knows how that will end. I did liked how the director didn't make the entire movie about the action and the explosives and the kicking and the leaping from bombed buildings and all that extra action stuff some people add to their movies to increase an audience's excitement level. There was actually a back story and mixed in tid bits that gave this movie a harder punch. But augh! The special effects were really bad! The scenes where Spider-man is swinging around the city in his costume were okay, and most of the action sequences were okay, but otherwise (I'm talking about Parker's fight with the Flash guy), they stank. The impression the audience gets in certain parts is, \\"Wow. That was really fake,\\" and the people watching the movie won't believe the story anymore.<br />>>>>>>>WARNING: SMALL SPOILER<br />The ending battle really blew me away. I was really affected by the harshness of both fighters, and it was of course exciting because, even though the death of Spider-man was not probable. It didn't matter though, because the audience was still worried for their hero. I also enjoyed and understood the ending when Parker turned down MJ. I'm not exactly sure why, but I have an idea. He wanted to keep her out of danger, because if future bad guys (and there will be future bad guys) knew who he loved, they would go after her like the Green Goblin did. It was an act of personal sacrifice, and it sort of celebrated the goodness of Peter Parker, further distinguishing the line between good and evil. I know there's going to be two more sequels, so I'm keeping my fingers crossed!<br />These are only some of the points. I do think though, that this movie definitely deserves at least, if rated one out of ten, an 8 (I think it'd have to be one heck of a movie to get a ten ;-P)<P...
B000008LOV|4.0|This low key supergroup effort is an underatted gem.  Harrison, Dylan, Orbison, Petty, and Lynne all make nice contributions. The textures vary quite nicely with a few good special effects thrown in most likely due to Jeff Lynne.<br />  The light hearted upbeat atmosphere of this record is what makes the recording a keeper.  Dylan contributes two gems with Dirty World and Tweeter And The Monkey Man feature some gripping lyrics and creative arrangements. Handle With Care, End Of The Line,and Last Night are other highlights.  Heck except for possibly the lethargic  Congratulations they are all quite catchy. The guys all share the spotlight which make it a pleasing listen.
078322687X|5.0|This is the classic style of every click being represented in high schools across the county. How unique to represent each of the clicks in school and how they somewhat share the same problems at home. This is one classic that I never get tired of watching.
B00005QB9A|5.0|This is one of those rare movies nowadays that touches anyone without recurring to the easy plot of schock and horror images - or special effects.<br />Not to miss!
6304539258|5.0|I'm reviewing this from my 13 year old's memory of it when it came out. I loved it then. My mom didn't because Luke Skywalker was short and boyish, and her idea of a hero was Sean Connery. As a 13 year old I didn't agree with her. If I saw it NOW I think I would. LUCAS/LUKE...it was obviously a short wimpy guy's fantasy: George Lucas being the hero that saves the universe. A bit of an indulgence, but as I say, I didn't mind it at age 13. Lucas obviously isn't an actors director, because his actors are always a little flat. Oddly, the robots are the ones with charisma! But a fun film.
0446608955|5.0|this book was really great.  i really liked it and it was really sweet and romantic.  read it
B00005OAA6|4.0|i bought this cd last november and i loved it.  it was a big surprise to see how great an album Vicky could cut by herself.  My fave song is &quot;Like that&quot;, its hot.  Of all the solo spice cds, this is second only to Mel C's Northern Star.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|This movie is one of two movies that I bought without even seeing it before, and I fell in love with it. Since it came out in the theaters, most of my friends told me that I need to see it. It went out of the theaters before I had a chance to see it. Then one day, I found it on DVD, watched it and then I knew what all of my friends were talking about.<br />The movie takes place in late 19th century and in a place called the Moulin Rouge. Other than that, there is nothing &quot;period&quot; about it. The whole thing is Baz Luhrman's vision. It is a fast pace rollar coaster through the story with music being the car that you ride in. This is one of the most unique movies that I have seen in a long time. It was refreshing to see something that was not your typical Hollywood film.<br />Some people didn't like the fact that modern music was being used, but I feel that this aspect brought the feeling of the 19th century into the 21st. It connected me to the movie in a what that could not have been done if music from the time was used. I still find myself singing or humming the songs. <br />Visually, the movie was beautiful. The costumes were done wonderfully and nothing in that department felt out of place with me. <br />I will admit, this is not a movie for everyone, but it is one that I will always love and enjoy
B000060OFT|4.0|When this movie came out, a lot of people complained that it trivialized Shakespeare's genius. On the contrary, one could argue that it captured the true essence of the Bard -- pop art. In his day, Shakespeare's plays were edgy and they catered to the populace in general, much as today's action and teen flicks do. Which is why it was so thrilling to see new life breathed into the Romeo and Juliet story and the play made relevant to today's young people. All the original elements were kept intact, although lines were inexplicably cut here and there. Claire Danes did a bang-up job, and unlike every other actress I've seen in the role, totally nailed the \\"nor any other part\\" innuendo, demonstrating not only her chops as an actress but her understanding of the sometimes-muddy Elizabethan dialogue. DiCaprio's very Shakespeare-in-the-Park-esque Romeo was rather disappointing. Until I watched this film, I thought him a good actor, but he seemed to stumble over the lines, especially next to Danes. Luhrmann did a great job with all the visual gags (loved the names on the guns!), and the cinematography was even more of a head-trip-a-delic roller-coaster ride than I expected. Of course, if one doesn't like Luhrmann's style, one can always watch the uninspired and obsequious Zeferelli version, which this writer suspects Shakespeare would have found incredibly self-important and boring.
0345350499|5.0|The story of King Arthur has always captivated me, and in school I loved The Once and Future King, which lead me to pick up The Mists of Avalon. Wow. The Mists made The Once and Future King look like child's play. Which it virtually is, in comparison. <BR>From Morgaine's first word, she is alive. Convincing, real, tangible. All of the characters posess this quality, as though Marion Zimmer Bradley's story were entirely true and simply related to the reader as it was told to her by her own inventions. The story is told from the perspective of the Arthurian women, but in no way slights the goings-on of the men. The relationships behind these people are so passionate and tormented and true that one cannot help but feel these emotions as his or her own. The struggle between rising Christianity and the Old Religion is constant and heart-felt, which is an aspect that is missing in more conventional Arthurian tales. A review on the back of the book calls The Mists of Avalon a &quot;creative reimagining,&quot; but its fervor and emotion make it feel more like an expose.<BR>I highly recommend this book. As stated previously, I do not associate my name with a book that is not worth reading. I believe that you will come away from this experience--which is truly what it is, something active and engaging, not a passive excuse for a waste of pages--changed. I certainly did.
B00005OAIE|5.0|John Mayer is awesome!! If you dont have his cd yet go and get it now. I am going to his concert this summer and i am sooo excited, he is one of the best artist out there now.

6304014457|3.0|I first saw this on TV when I was 14. Didn't know what the heck was going on, but the imagery stayed in my mind. I recently saw this again for the first time in over 20 years. NOW I get it. The story is very creative (makes me wonder if the &quot;13th century myth of Caligari&quot; was an actual German legend-does anybody out there know for sure?), but you really have to see this more than once to fully &quot;get it.&quot; Very interesting. See it and enjoy.
B000002UB6|5.0|seems like some people are overcritical of the beatles on this album. face it, beatles could have recorded farts and made them sound good. this is my favorite album and... maybe the shortest to me. phil spector's mastery did not make a big difference to me, no matter what its still the beatles.
B000000OPZ|5.0|The scene was 1987 and David Coverdale was readying himself to turn the world of rock music upside down. The critics said Whitesnake wouldn't last after the success of 1984's \\"Slide It In\\", but Mr. Coverdale was holding an ace up his sleeve: An album loaded with radio friendly, roll down the windows, crank up the radio, put the pedal to the metal rock and roll.<br />With the amazing guitar mastery of John Sykes the album kicks off with \\"Crying In The Rain\\" and two seconds in one thing is quite certain: This band means serious business.<br />A start and stop intro explodes into a brutal, riff oriented groove. Coverdale's voice is full of raw sexuality and all the power we had come to equate with him. The song takes a furious turn as Sykes flies into the solo, and displays his absolute command of the instrument. Quite the opening statement.<br />\\"Still Of The Night\\" was arguably the biggest song in 1987, and today, some fifteen years on it still holds up. An absolute rock masterpiece. Start/Stop riffs, Coverdale's incredible power and range in full force, a catchy chorus and another phenominal Sykes solo, all the ingredients blending together to forge one of the truly great moments in hard rock history. As for the critics who ignorantly compared Coverdale with ex-Led-Zeppelin frontman Robert Plant, understand that Jimmy Page himself played this song with Coverdale in a tour of Japan in late 1993. Page was qouted as saying it was a \\"truly well written song.\\"<br />With \\"Here I Go Again\\" and \\"Is This Love\\" Whitesnake scored two of the biggest selling hits of the year. These two songs also showcased a more sensitive side of the Whitesnake sound. Reflective, even mournful at times, Whitesnake had proven that they could cover all the bases and do so with ease.<br />\\"Give Me All Your Love\\", \\"Bad Boys\\", \\"Straight For The Heart\\", \\"Children Of The Night\\", all hard driving, dynamic power rock songs that made the bubble gum rock of groups like Poison seem silly and useless.<br />The albums closing song, \\"Don't Turn Away\\" is another mid-tempo song that explodes near the end, a plea from one lover to another to stay and try once again to make it work.<br />All told this album is one of the definitive rock albums of all time. The music is emotional and played with intense passion and Coverdale's voice is in top form. If, by some chance you missed this album when it came out, do yourself a favor and discover the way rock should sound, purchase a copy, and get ready for one amazing journey.
B00005QGAX|5.0|what pushed me into buying bad? childhood memories of the black mickael, the thought of blasting BAD in my car, and sound quality! they did a great job remastering this album. i never thought i'd ever buy a mj album but i did and i don't regret it. btw... you will get hilarious reactions whist playing this album for friends and co-workers. heck, this is an album everyone can appreciate.
B00005YU1O|5.0|I watched Waking Life a few months ago with my then-boyfriend, and we both could not stop talking about it with everyone we knew after that. The movie is really dense, in that there is so much dialog that you can barely keep track of it all. And every conversation between the characters is interesting and makes you think. On top of that, there's the whole \\"plot\\" of the movie, if you could call it that, but it has you thinking and wondering about the very existence of the main character and what it is and what that means. Anyway, long-winded but you get the picture. So I think the two of us probably got about 25 other people to go see it, and they kept coming back to us and talking about it. And just when I thought the Waking Life topic had died down, I get the DVD for my birthday. So now I've watched it about 3 more times, and lent it to some friends and IT'S BACK. This movie is so unique and excellent that I don't think I'm ever going to get away from it. In fact, I'm starting to feel like I'm the one in the crazy dream-state since every conversation I have nowadays is linked to Waking Life somehow. Anyway, if you like to think, watch this movie. And then watch a few more times. And then talk to other people who have watched it and see what happens. If you don't like to think, then go watch a Steven Seagal movie. You'll love it.
B0000668IF|2.0|Moby has unarguably been one of the most prominent figures of modern electronic music. His music has been heard all over the world, licensed to movies and commercials, and been generally praised by critics. After his last album, Play, Moby had reached a fame unrivaled by any electronic artist of the time. He gained immense popularity in the United States, where the most popular artists lack both creativity and ability in writing music.<br />However, Moby shined above the rest. His strong ability to write music that was not only well-written, but also music that appeals to the general population, has set him apart from a majority of artists today. His new album could have enforced his high standing in the music community and set a new standard for popular music.<br />Unfortunately, this has not happened. Moby's new album, 18, has abandoned the rich electronic textures and eclecticism of his previous albums. Instead, he expanded upon the mixture of old blues and modern electronica that he experimented upon in his previous album, Play. <br />Herein lies the problem. It is not that he expanded upon an old technique, but rather that he covered no new ground on this album. What made Play such a great success is that he tried something new and succeeded splendidly. Also, the variety and contrast of music on Play has made it an album worthy of its success.<br />Moby's 18 lacks what made Play great. It lacks interest and intrigue, and it focuses more on mood and emotions. It is extremely mellow and can be unbearable to listen to for an extended period of time, such as the 71 minutes of the cd. The rhythms are repetitive, ordinary, and stale. The use of instrumentation is sparse and the vocals are weak. There is little beyond the strings, percussion, and vocals that seem to be the backbone of practically every song. <br />If any other artist wrote this album, I would have given it a higher rating, but for Moby, this album is a black mark in his career. It may not be apparentdue to the high hype that this album has been given and the generally high ratings that various sources have given. However, I stand firmly by my rating since this album is not worthy of praise. The music on the album is far from bad and contains several beautifully written songs, but it lacks energy and creativity. The vigor of Moby's previous works has given him the praise that he deserves. Unfortunately, this album is not an improvement upon his previous music but is more a progression towards mediocrity.
0345440900|1.0|I was hoping for a book that would complement my AP style, not one that recommended putting my baby on a schedule pratically from the day we came home from the hospital. Maybe good for some, but not for my family.
0790731452|4.0|\\"I want the people to know that they still have two of three branches of the government working for them\\"<br />Check your mind at the door on this one folks. It's a fun B-Grade Sci-Fi movie reminiscent of the B-Grade Sci-Fi from the '50's and '60's but the plot is thinner than rice paper. What do you expect from a movie that is based on the subject matter from a series of  Topps trading cards made in the late '50's early '60's with a brief comeback and reprints in the late '80's. What? You want a review? OK, then why didn't you say so.<br />The basic plot, which is almost all of the plot, is the Martians attempt to conquer Earth, but ultimately fail of course. Jack Nicholson has dual roles as a Vegas Hotel/Casino Owner and the President of the United States in an attempt to make the movie more than just an old worn out B-Movie. That brings up a thought... If movie studios had the multi-million dollar budgets in the 1950's & '60's that they now have today, there wouldn't have been as many B-Grade Sci-fi movies produced, but I digress.<br />Despite the fact that this is a \\"low budget\\" movie with a big budget and stars like Jack Nicholson, Glenn Close, Michael J. Fox, Sarah Jessica Parker and Pierce Bronson, and a super thin plot, it is very enjoyable. It  has some rather humorous moments, I won't spoil them, but if you decide to watch this DVD see how the Martians destroy Easter Island.<br />I enjoyed this film more than I expected and I knew that I would at least kinda like it, so my expectations were surpassed. As I said at the beginning this is a film where if you turn off your mind you enjoy it ten times more than if you think through it. A prime example of this is the way Earth is saved from the Martians. If your thinking through the movie, you'll wonder how did a kid in the Arizona dessert get the word about his Ultimate weapon spread across the world so quickly, with out telling anybody about it? Did everybody in the entire world come up with the very same ideaat the same idea? I think not, that is one of the reasons I turned my mind off on this one.<br />Technically, from a consumer's point of view, I didn't like the way the menu is controlled, I'm not exactly sure why but I just didn't. I thought the saucer theme was cute but kind of boring, I think they could have spent some more time on the menu and had the Martians do things; for example, when you choose something to view a Martian would shoot that particular flying saucer, making it explode and then the screen would fade into what you wanted. I also hate the cardboard/plastic \\"Clamshell\\" box, I've never been a fan of those.<br />Now onto the Technical Gobble-de-gunk of this review.<br />The extra stuff is:<BR>Interactive Menus<BR>Production notes<BR>Scene Access<BR>English, French and Spanish Languages and Subtitles<BR>Two Trailers<BR>Anamorphic transfer on one side, pan and scan on the other<BR>Alternate Music Only audio<br />I would recommend this movie to Sci-Fi fans, People who had \\"Mars Attacks!\\" cards as kids, and folks who enjoy mindless entertainment and don't need to analyze every little detail of what they are watching. I guess that means Trekkies wouldn't like this movie much.<br />The Picture was very good, very little disappointment there, and the sound was OK nothing unusual, although on my system it sounded weird at points, but that is just my particular set up. So... I Give Mars Attacks a 4 for Picture and a 3 for Sound.
B00005QIPH|2.0|My friend told me how much he liked the Strokes because they brought back that old brit/new york style. I listened to the CD, and saw them in concert. They're talented enough guys. They know how to play their instruments well enough, but my problem is that I'm not really hearing anything original here. I've head all this before, and I've heard it done better. What's the point of buying a CD by a bunch of posers, when I can go out and get the better music by the artists that they are copying.<br />Pick up some Stooges, Ramones, and Birthday Party rather than this cute but not groundbreaking CD.
B00005JKBC|4.0|I too found the closed captioning problem annoying.  I found, though, that if you hit the fast-forward or rewind button just once, and then hit play again, the closed captioning goes away for a while.<br />I did really enjoy the movie, though.  It was very Tom Clancy like it the way it portrays &quot;real&quot; spys, not the James Bond versions.  Good luck.

B000059XVS|4.0|To this day T.E. Lawrence is something of an enigma.  Nevertheless, this wonderfully done movie was a huge undertaking that had almost as profound effect on Peter O'Toole as the actual events did on Colonel Lawrence.  Rather than trying to wow the audience with the perfidious nonsense that is the stock and trade of contemporary filming making, the movie sticks fairly closely to Lawrence's own accounts of his escapades in the desert - which, themselves have occasionally been brought into question.<br />I agree that the big screen helps enthuse the viewer to a greater degree than watching Lawrence of Arabia on the tube, but the daunting conditions of the story come through nevertheless, and that is more important than mere sensory titillation.  Lawrence was both a studied and frustrated man, who by most accounts never quite accepted himself.  These are the seeds of both greatness, as well as failure, and clearly T.E. Lawrence was profoundly familiar with both.  His early triumphs at organizing the nomads of the desert to defeat the Turks set the stage for even greater exploits, many of which played into the hands of his vulnerabilities.<br />If the movie viewer isn't familiar with the history of the Middle East in the early 20th century, much of this tale will go unappreciated.  Be that as it may, Lawrence's military exploits are studied even today - and many, many a modern special operations soldier would recognize the techniques he used to organize, train, equip and deploy indigenous tribesmen against the unprotected flanks of a more experienced and better equipped professional force.  Regrettably, the fact that he was so far from friendly support also played into his rather egocentric weaknesses.  And it has been proposed by more than one commentator that some of Lawrence's most harrowing, and unsuccessful, exploits had little to do with military necessity, but rather more to do with satisfying some hidden inner conflict.<br />Lawrence of Arabia is a great movie that, being true to the original story, drags in spots and has a rather anticlimactic ending.  However, if a modern viewer listens carefully, rather than just lapsing into sensory titillation mode, it is fairly easy to detect many of the frustrations that are continuing to bubble to the surface in that troubled area of the world.
0783226063|3.0|I've read the books, I saw this at the movies and I watched it again on VHS... needles to say I bought the DVD on release (although for less than asked here!)<br />The movie was slated on release and failed to break even but, as with other critical failures (Highlander comes to mind) has built a cult following over the years. The de Laurentis/Lynch team produced some of the most amazing effects of the time, and the soundtrack was utterly brilliant, winning an Academy Award. Yes the film is a much truncated adaptation of possibly the best SF novel pre Orson Scott Card, but it was a valiant effort hampered only by a Production/Direction feud, and aided by a superb cast.<br />This DVD release is disappointing to say the least.  The sound is not 5.1 as advertised, but a poor 'phantom' surround attempt, the picture quality is reminiscent of a US sitcom series and the additional extras are almost non-existent, and worthless at best.<br />If you haven't read the book, do so first, it'll help fill in the gaps, or wait for the much rumoured Director's Cut (3hrs+), but avoid the US TV version as the quality is DIRE!<br />It's worth it just to see the film in widescreen again, and to here it in decent Stereo, but I'm dying for a decent digital remaster, PLEASE!
B00005OAIE|4.0|I recently saw John Mayer in Philadelphia. As mentioned in many reviews, his guitar prowess was on display.  I must object to complaints about the demographics of his fans and his lyrics. <br />The fact that he has many female fans, generally relegates reviews to veer off into the \\"N-Sync\\" mentality. He happens to have a lot of young, white female fans...so what? do you like his music? I wouldn't say he's pandering in the same over-produced, brain-dead fashion as the TRL artists do.<br />Further, I think too many people are searching for provocative lyrics from this Berklee-educated guy.  Mayer, to me is much more of a painter, providing evocative scenes of life. I think he enjoys the visuals a song can create.  Many of his lyrics, about \\"jumping on a table at a re-union\\" are hyperbole.  But his attention to detail is remarkable (\\"playing chess with salt and pepper shaker\\"...\\"finding your lover's hair on your shirt\\") and adds depth to his songs. Finally, while the DMB comparison does apply to some extent, I think Mayer is more rooted in blues than world-beat or folk.
B00000JLWW|5.0|Really nice movie.  Based on the ship Titanic, they added Rose and Jack in.  What the hell, I'm just 12.  Anyway, I really enjoyed watching the movie.  It was so breathtaking, so touching, so sad when Jack died.  That's what makes a movie: Romance, sadness and action is one of the combinations
B00003CX5P|2.0|How can the same person behind episode 2 be behind this crud. I hate Jar Jar, Amidala sounds ridiculous, I hate the Japanese stereotype aliens, the pod race was boring, everything was overexplained to the point of being like running commentary, way too much cgi. This movie is irrlevant, epecially after seeing episode 2. I remember seeing this in the theater, everyone was all into it until Jar Jar showed up, then he never left, then nobody cared anymore except for the very few scenes with Darth Maul. I never will understand that, I mean the overabundance of Jar Jar , in the documentary Lucas says the number of scenes he's in which i had to laugh at, something like 461!

If so, he has found something that he is not good at. :)<br />I hope he can recover from this...
B000050XEI|5.0|I have never heard this CD before, but I have heard Only Time and the LOTR theme song.  Wow!  I was totally amazed by her soft, gentle voice.  She may not have the voice of an angel, but it sounds like angels were singing those songs.  I especially like the lyrics of Only Time, which is used in a slideshow about the 911 tragedy.  It was so touching.  I really look up to Enya and Sarah Brightman
B00000099Y|1.0|I cannot believe some find musical redemption in TOOL's music, if that's what you want to call it.  Under the guise of 'groundbreaking' (which 'Aenima' is not) or 'unique' (which 'Aenima' is, but this does not mean it's good), many 'Toolies' have blindly followed suit, and elevated the band to godlike status.  'Aenima' is dissonant, unpleasant, and directionless to say the least, and their music is simply terrible!  The degree to which the latest generation has embraced 'Tool' is more a testament to their awful taste in rock music, as well as proof that the record industry has succeeded in lowering their standards bigtime!  This release is a total DUD!
B00003CXWV|1.0|Don't get trapped! This movie is way over rated here at Amazon! Thank God I didn't buy this movie!<br />Everything was terrible:<BR>1. Boring story. Yes it is a true story but it doesn't deserve to be written in the first place! Why did they make a movie of it?<BR>2. You'll never sympathize or get attached to any character! (lack of emotions).<BR>3. Weak dialogue!<BR>4. Zero suspense and surprises!<br />The bottom line is don't fall into this trap! It is boring, boring, boring! Even the (Infinifilm Edition) DVD is not worth it!
B00000253N|5.0|Blood On The Tracks is like the weather, impossible to predict and forever changing. Conceived and recorded in the midst of marital divorce, one can hear the forced strains of a heart ambivalently breaking and washing the empty shores of a tideless sea. These songs are transcendental composites of loss and love, vaugue and evanescent silhouettes of fast clouds sweeping over solid ground. Beautiful music.
B00003CXSP|5.0|It comes through most strongly in the book, but one gets the impression that Dr Lecter is, if not the Devil, at least one of his frequent dinner companions.

078401213X|5.0|It seems like one of those non-sense movies. But this movie really makes you wonder about what fixation for something can do to you. It also depicts a little bit how a genius' mind seem to work. <BR>What I really like is the fact that CHAOS is everywhere and that CHAOS is so chaotic that it becomes organized.<BR>Nice movie. Black and White makes it even better!
B00005KHJR|4.0|I've seen this movie a few times and even though I can't watch the final scene, I love it. It's extremely dated, but somehow for me that just added to the atmosphere of subtly building and surreal horror. As far as I can tell, this is extremely well-researched, though there seems to be a slight mixing of different pre-Christian cultures. I can't explain the fascination of this film; a pagan myself, I'm very aware it does not paint a very flattering (or accurate) picture of modern witches. The soundtrack is amazing and Christopher Lee is enchanting as the sinister and charming Lord Summerisle. I highly recommend this movie. It will both entrance and deeply disturb you.
B00003CX5P|3.0|After so long to have this DVD launched, I do admit I was overexcited about its features. It is just an ordinary DVD with some features that any other movie would come with.<BR>It is only worth it for the movie, not for the extras.
B00005RY7X|5.0|I am a fan of gloom rock. Stuff like Radiohead and Travis are big in my CD player. Listening to those is OK usually, but they're not much fun.<br />Enter Andrew W.K.<br />Finally, there's some fun in rock! \\"I Get Wet\\" is an unsuperably excellent album, perhaps the best of the year so far, just because it lets us have fun and revel in stupid stuff which otherwise we wouldn't care about.<br />Take \\"Ready to Die,\\" which sounds like getting ready to die is an epic of dramatically big proportions. It's almost like \\"Fight Club: The Musical,\\" where we get prepared to knock the living daylights out of each other - while singing. <br />\\"Party Hard\\" is simply the epitome of rock and pop cliches, throwing the happy sounds of Bay City Rollers with the metal of Guns 'n' Roses with impossibly catchy *NSYNC beats. Good grief! Yes, it's a dumb song (\\"Now it's time to party/and we'll party hard\\" is a lyric!), but what the heck? Fun hasn't been that great in a while.<br />So the rest of the album follows the same format. It's almost a parody of everything music stands for, but W.K. has some solid credibility by not actually parodying others' songs. Here's hoping his brand of metal lasts for quite a while.
B0000035E7|3.0|Well I do not what to say because ,you know NIRVANA is great we can still having kurt alive if we remember him with his songs his music the most important thing is that you enjoy it
6304578458|1.0|should not be in the comedy section.  Didn't laugh once, bad plot
B00005QY5Y|5.0|First, just a note:  \\"New York, New York\\" was written, recorded, and the video shot before the WTC disaster.  Ryan did not jump on the band wagon.  It is just coinsidence.  A sad one, at that.<br />I bought this record because Adam Duritz of Counting Crows (I love this guy!!!) sings on it and has been quoted as saying Ryan Adams is one of the greatest songwriters he has ever heard.  If you have every analyzed and listened to Counting Crows lyrics, you will understand what a compliment that is!   I fell in love with this album after a few turns on the player and now, I find it in most of the time.  Ryan Adams may remind you of others; but I think he has a style and a presence all his own.  \\"Answering Bell\\" is my favorite for it's differentness (Oh, and Adam Duritz sings a little back ground vocals!) I also think it is quite a compliment to hear the Coors & Bono singing \\"When the Stars Go Blue\\" on the radio.  How cool is it to have Bono sing a song from an album you released just 8 months ago?   When the big boys realize what a great songwriter Ryan Adams is, I think we should all stand up and pay attention.  Check him out.   Buy this album now.  You will not be disappointed.
B00005QIPH|5.0|This band isn't Nirvana but they are paving the way for a new Nirvana to come through the music scene get rid of pop and a new branch of punk thats not quite punk comes through.  I would say the sound more like MC5 than Velvet Underground with a raw sound and punchy drums.
B00005QG9J|2.0|You cant deny the true pure talent shown by Incubus, but lately, the focus on the band seems to be more at Brandon's body, than the music.  The last reviw i read was from some chick talking about how she liked that he took off his shirt.  This completely pisses me off.  This is a great band, and the music can just melt into you, and become a part of you, and these brain-dead little twelve year olds only see him, i bet you they dont even own S.C.I.E.N.C.E. Which is by far the best album.  All i gotta say is if your gonna be a fan at least be a fan for the right reasons.
B000002WEH|5.0|From Elvis In Memphis ranks as one of the best albums Presley ever made. Although we know him as the King of Rock'n'Roll, there isn't a rock song to be found on this volume. There is however a mixture of blues, country, pop and soul scattered across the tracks. Elvis shows his musical versatility and talent by singing all these styles masterfully. Under Chips Moman's and to a lesser extent, Felton Jarvis' direction, the singer and the American Studios house band sore to musical heights.<br />  Besides the diversity of styles; what else is striking about this album is that it seems to have played a part in progressing and influencing American popular music. You can hear strains of the Elvis sound found on this album almost a decade later in the likes of Bob Seger's and Kenny Rogers' music. <br />  This album should also set the record straight, that Elvis DID NOT rip off black singers/musician for their style.  While Elvis was certainly influenced by certain African-American singers of yesteryear, \\"From Elvis In Memphis\\" is more proof that Presley was not a white guy trying to sing black. Rather he was a white singer who had soul. It wasn't \\"blue eyed soul\\" either. It was soul music of a mixed parentage, both black and white. But even that description falls short. Let's just call it \\"Elvis soul\\".<BR>  <BR>  It echoes throughout this album even in the country songs; especially in Presley's version of \\"I'll Hold You In My Heart\\". Just like he did at Sun Records back in the mid 1950's, Elvis again crosses over musical boundaries, breaks the rules and comes up with a variety of music that resonates from his heart as much as his lungs.<BR>   <BR>  It has been said that Elvis had a sense of foreboding. His enormous fame and the prison it put him in seemed to trouble him at times. In \\"Long Black Limousine\\", you can't help but hear his underlying anger as he tells the tragic story of a young woman's pursuit of stardom gone wrong. It ranks as one of his finest album cuts ever. <br />  If you buy this CD, sit down and really listen to it. You won't be disappointed.
B00005B36H|4.0|Tool is without a shadow of a doubt, my favorite band. but..Lateralus doesn't seem to have the same affect as Aenima or even Undertow. Its definitely worth picking up. I think that most of the good music is wasted by just playing over and over again. there are only a handful of songs on here and the rest is weird noises and music. the title track is damn around 11 minutes long, but hte lyrics are so short. why? are they trying to impress us? I wish at times that they'd just put out an album with more than just 8 songs and the rest being just weird skits or strange sounds (example, Aenima is just about half music, half odd little vignettes thrown in their, like Mannebach) <br />Schism is still an excellent song. Parabol(a) is great too. Ticks and Leeches as well. In fact there is no problem at all with the music, once you get to the actual song. i'm talking about the wasted space on a 70 minute CD. we waited four years for this and we got jipped. If you want Tool, Aenima and Undertow offer plenty more. <br />only 4 stars, but because of all the wasted space.
6304806442|5.0|I can't believe that some people thought this movie glorified drug use, nothing is farther from the truth.  Perhaps it's the lack of an overly moralistic and canned message screaming \\"drugs are bad\\" every few minutes like in so many after school specials that those types miss.  Or maybe they didn't like it because it wasn't wrapped up in a neat tidy little package where everyone has learned their lesson.<br />No matter.  There's plenty of regurgitated junk out there to amuse them.<br />Trainspotting lays out the \\"joys\\" of Heroin addiction for all to see including death and disease and criminal behavior to sustain the habit and extreme poverty.  It is open, honest, and brutally direct.  It's not a kid's movie of course but anyone else who wants to see an entertaining and yet moving movie about the seamier side should check this out.
0688172377|3.0|This book provides an almost unique opportunity to hear a voice ring out from Africa and there is so much more I want to know. The second book ought to have given that to me and in some respects I did receive a little more knowledge based on the ten days or so that Waris spent reunited with her family in Somalia. I am heartened to read about courage and fortitude and resilience and I want to know more about the difficulties of being an Nomadic mother in a western culture, about the process of finding synthesis and balance when one strides across several continents. I wanted more photos (and I accept that there will be none from the desert childhood but why not at least one in profile as that was the shot that lifted this wonderful woman from obscurity).<BR>I am interested in other reviews that measure the book against the standards of the west as if the life of this child was exceptional. This little girl of the desert represents millions, literally millions and the great shame is that they are, as yet, unable to get this message through to us. For this beginning I give thanks, and I still want more... Let us sit by the campfires as the hyenas prowl and imagine yet another meal of rice and pick the thorns from our feet and curl up with a family who will drink camel's milk and move on again tomorrow. We need more stories and we need such stories to become more commonplace.
0783225857|5.0|Any movie that can so profoundly affect a person, and make them a better person, goes from an excellent to a Great film.  That is how I feel about this movie.  It is my choice for best movie ever made.
0679721037|5.0|This book is very emotional, saddening and agonizing book about one of the worst chapeters in our history. This book opened my eyes to the hings that went on in Hiroshima at the time of atomic bombing. \\"hiroshima\\" tells the lives of six men and women who survived from A-bomb and concludes how the people were affected and how devastating the bombing was.<BR>If I did not read this book I would still see the A-bomb on hiroshima as just a terrible thing happened and would still only see it through the pictures in our history textbook. Everyone should read this book whether they are interested in the subject or not, for this is a book that will open our eyes to the power of human being to kill and destroy everything around us...<br />Hiroshima is one of the most influencial book that i have ever read.
B00005A1PR|5.0|I was tremendously disappointed at this years Grammy Awards. I mean think about it, India was nominated for I think 5 awards and of those 5, she won none at all. Okay, I know that she has stiff competition, but come on! I remember seeing her face drop when U2 were called up to collect the last award that she had been put forward for. She was soo disappointed and I felt her pain.<br />  This album is a very good starter for her career. The only way that I can describe her voice is as being rich and sweet, almost like a very sweety chocolate or fruitcake. The songs start off really well and just when you think they can't get any better, they do. I would have to say that the bonus track, 'Wonderful' just tops it off. If  you are a soul lover or just fancy a change, this album would be the perfect appetizer.
B00000JQFM|5.0|If you play guitar, you probably know about this album.  They don't call it a classic for nothing.  The music is all instrumental, but you'd never even realize it.  Joe's guitar has a voice of its own.  &quot;Satch Boogie&quot; and the title track are just brilliant, and very complex.  &quot;Always With Me, Always With You&quot; is a very pretty soft song. It's amazing how he can work fast solos into a slow song, and actually make it sound like they belong there.  Satch is a melodic master, one of the greatest guitarists of all time.  He is nearly unmatched.  Only Monte Montgomery and John Petrucci can stand up to his skills.  If you like this, I also recommend, Steve Vai, Eric Johnson, and the aforementioned two guitarists (the latter of which plays for Dream Theater).  Yngwie Malmsteen is good, but not very creative.  I can't really recommend him that much.  Anyway, if you play guitar, or if you just like good guitar playing, this is the perfect album to buy.  Oh, and the cover is cool too.  Silver Surfer rules!
0385721234|4.0|The book i read was&quot;Like water for chocolate&quot; is a love story It was by Luara Esquivel. the story was okay it had many sad parts. The story was about this family tradition The family tradition was that the youngest girl can't get married unilt her mom has died. Evey chapter is a month and every month has a recipe.The recipe is from the old times.The two main person were Tita and Pedro. Tita is the youngest in her family so she can't get married unilt her mom dies. Tita fall in love with Pedro.I think the sroy was okay so people sould read it.
0061020680|3.0|While Pratchett is always funny, and a better plotter than I think many who have written him off as a \\"comedy\\" writer give him credit for, you'll need to really like the character of Death to fully enjoy \\"Mort.\\"<br />While he appears, albeit briefly, in almost every Discworld novel, the character is, pardon the expression, rather thin. The gags in this book are fairly self-evident, and repeated more than a few times. There isn't the sort of broad-ranging imagination Pratchett's friend Neil Gaiman brings to a similar character in his \\"Sandman\\" series, and so once, you've gotten past the basic setup, the story revolves around Death's young apprentice, the mystery of why Death would want an apprentice, and what happens when Things Start To Go Horribly Wrong.<br />Naturally, there's some nice magical chaos, romantic interest (isn't there always?) and a bit of last minute panic, as well as some broad comedy with the Four Horsemen of the Apocraplyse. Nothing phenomenal here, unless you're a big, big fan of Death. This novel also sets up \\"Reaper Man\\" and \\"Soul Music,\\" although it isn't required reading for either.<br />As always, Pratchett entertains, but this is one of his lesser works.
0399229191|5.0|While a spider weaves her web, animals of the farm come and ask her to play. The spider is too busy spinning her web. Adorable.<br />Several things make this book a true winner. First the repitition. The repitition is an excellent way for pre-readers and early reader to learn to read. (A whole language approach, but it gives kids some success.) Second, the tactile approach- as the spider spins her web you can feel the strings of the web and the fly that is buzzing around. This is a fun book to read and my son loves to touch the pages. The illustrations are adorable.<br />When I taught Kindergarten I always had a unit worked up around this book. There are so many creative and fun things you can do for activities and learning with this book. Now that I'm at home with my kiddos, we still do many of these fun things after we read this book. We made spiderwebs out of glue on black paper.<br />Enjoy.
6304779356|5.0|The Lost Boys is the best movie! It has a great cast and AWESOME soundtrack! It was released in the summer of '87 and still holds a slot for my number one. This movie has great one-liners and is a wonderful and refreshing mix of horror and humor. Too bad there never was a sequel but you know how that goes. A sequel would've cheapened it somehow. There was a screenplay finished for a sequel but it was never completed. The stars had other projects or something. Anyways the DVD version is great! It is like watching it in the theatres again. I would love to have added bonus extras. Joel Schumacher if you are reading this help us fans out here! :o)
B00000253N|5.0|This one is truly great.  The definition of a 5 star album (and an argument for 1/2 stars on Amazon in order to differentiate the really good from the essential).  From the personal to the mythic in a few words or lines, this is the lyrical equivalent of any great work of art. I know it's only rock and roll but try to convince me of that while it's playing.  One of the few discs that I think of as \\"perfect\\"; Blood on the Tracks is pure transparent American music--clear production and straightforward sound--nothing to obscure the music.
B0000636UN|4.0|We haven't heard anything from Sheryl Crow in a few years.  We can all be thankful that when she decided to re-enter the music scene, she chose a fab song like &quot;Soak Up the Sun&quot; to do it with.  This song completely defines summer.  I promise you that it will be played on every beach, boat house, and dock in America, especially if teenagers are involved, because who wouldn't love this song.  Oh yeah, by the way, the rest of the album rocks too!  Buy it!
B000002MUW|5.0|&quot;Bedtime Stories&quot; was Madonna's follow-up to &quot;Erotica,&quot; an album so cooly received that it started a nasty backlash against the singer.  So, it's not surprising that she comes across as a bit defensive on a couple of tracks: on &quot;Survival&quot; she promises that she's &quot;gonna be living to tell&quot; and she lashes back at her critics in the dynamite &quot;Human Nature.&quot; Elsewhere, &quot;Bedtime Stories&quot; was her most self-reflective album at the time, and it's also her most r&amp;b-sounding disc since her debut.  Dave Jam Hall, Dallas Austin and Babyface all supply the onetime Material Girl some solid beats and rhythms that wouldn't sound out of place on a Mary J. Blige album.  The hits, &quot;Secret&quot; and &quot;Take a Bow&quot; show up here, but other tracks of note are the infectious &quot;Inside of Me&quot; (a tribute to her late mother) and &quot;Don't Stop,&quot; which should have been released as a single but wasn't.  This album didn't flop upon release, but it sold less than it deserved to, mainly because people were looking for a &quot;Vogue 2&quot; in this record.  Nonetheless, &quot;Bedtime Stories&quot; is a straight-up r&amp;b record that deserves a second chance.
6305181772|5.0|5 Stars hmmmmm.  Seems a high rating for a movie that generally has had a somewhat mediocre reception.  I rated M.I. accordingly because it's a movie I have revisited on quite a few occasions and have always thoroughly enjoyed it.  Tom Cruise is a very talented actor, but it is the twisting story-line, exciting climatic action sequence and theft of the NOC list scene from the CIA that sends this movie into my 5 star rating category.  The DVD version I have, has no special features, aside from a theatrical trailer.  If I were rating this on the DVD itself then it would certainly rate very low.  All in all, a favourite movie of mine, with action, suspense, espionage and a twist. Highly recommended.
1587880490|5.0|This was one of the best books I read in my life. It touched me deeply and still brings tears to my eyes just thinking about it. Anyone asking deeper questions about life, its lessons and its ultimate meaning has to read this book. It made a big impact on me in a time when I was really hitting rock bottom - it's a powerful reminder of what life is all about and ultimately, death, too.
B00003CXDG|2.0|As a great fan of Mission Impossible 1, I had great expectations for the sequel.  Oh, what a disappointment to see the franchise ruined by tedious and all to common car chases and fight sequences.  Ethan Hunt is too smart to get into a fight such as the one in the climax of this movie. Where is the intrigue, the espionage, the thinking man's Ethan Hunt?  Apart from the cool opening sequence there is little in my opinion to redeem this movie.  The Producer made a fatal mistake in getting John Woo to Direct this movie. Whereas Mission Impossible 1 is firmly entrenched in my DVD collection, the sequel will not be viewed again by this reviewer.  Not recommended.
078322799X|4.0|Pre-Lord of the Rings Peter Jackson directed this special effects-laden thriller-comedy starring Michael J. Fox as a con artist who fakes poltergeist attacks with his two dead buddies. Imaginative and funny at times, The Frighteners is a fantastic film with some creepy FX. Michael J. Fox is great as conman Frank Bannister, and the suppourting cast are as excellent as they are eccentric. Also director Jackson shows what a good sport he is with a well-done cameo.<br /><br />The main villian, the 'soul collector' (who goes around offing people with a creepy modus operandi) is remarkably similar to the ringwaiths in LOTR. The score is suitably spooky, fitting in well with the tone. The film is not for everyone however, there are some very chilling moments that may not sit too well with the added humour for some audiences. But hey, it's fun, and really entertaining. A fascinating and off-beat film from the director of Lord of the Rings.
B000001FY9|5.0|You don't buy this you're messed up!I have 2![I don't know why]But if you want reggae you got the  best reggae with this CD!Bob Marley's music rocks!It makes you \\"WAKE UP AND LIVE!\\"Buy This.
B00003CXE7|5.0|After the critical and commercial dissapiontments of White Squall (1996) and Gi Jane (1996), Ridley Scott returns to form with Gladiator! Starring Russel Crowe, the film is centered around the famous Roman legionaire Maximus, who is betrayed by the emporer's son Commudus (Joaquin Pheonix) and is sold to become a competetor in the roman arena. Russel Crowe's commanding performance as Maximus is gritty and brilliant, and it's easy to see why Crowe won the best actor Oscar for the role.<br />Scott's visioanry trademark seen in films like Alien and Blade Runner is excellent, with huge CG re-creations of ancient Rome. Working with such an enormous scale and with such a big palet to use, Scott's unique talent for vivid and brutal storytelling is to the fore.<br />The collosal action set-pieces in the roman arena are breath-taking, and with top-notch stunt work and sharp visuals, the backgrounds, vistas and entire battlegrounds are done to masterful effect. Hans Zimmer's score for the film is a real romping, 'wake the neighbours up' soundtrack that is one of his best. The cinematography is astounding, with 'helicopter shots' over Rome, and the ear-splitting sound fits the film's brutal tone.<br />The acting is really impressive, with legendary actors Richard Harris as Emperor Marcus Aurelius and the late Oliver Reed as Antonius Proximo, a slave dealer who trains Maximus. And Phenoix plays the part of the evil Commodus with relish. But this is Russel's movie, and his performance is brilliant, combining ferociousness with pathos.<br />The DVD extra features are exceptional, with a feature commentary from Scott and the other film-makers, an extensive 'making of' documentary, deleted scenes with optional commentary from Scott, trailers, T.V spots, production notes, cast and filmmaker's notes and more fascinating production info. One of the best DVDs on the market, this is must-buy material from one of cinema's greatest directors.
0684800713|5.0|The term \\"expatriate\\" seems, at least to the twentieth century American mindset, to be defined by Hemingway.  His writing is practically a celebration of how well Americans can live in Europe, how enticing are the cultures, and how exciting and liberating are the experiences.  \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" indicates that, after the horror and confusion of World War I, the \\"Lost\\" Generation seem to have found themselves quite at home outside of America living life to the fullest.  If F. Scott Fitzgerald's fiction suggests that only the wealthy can afford to be irresponsible, Hemingway suggests that anybody can afford to be irresponsible outside his or her own country.<br />The narrator, Jake Barnes, is a newspaper writer living in Paris in the 1920's.  His circle of friends consists almost exclusively of other writers and artists and their admirers, all of whom hang out in the cafes, indulge in the night life, and drink freely, heavily, and lavishly -- no pesky Prohibition on this side of the Atlantic.  Two of Jake's friends are Robert Cohn, a Jewish boxer-turned-novelist whose love affairs with women always seem to end messily, and the beautiful, desirable Lady Brett Ashley, who is about to divorce her husband and marry an obnoxious boor named Mike Campbell.<BR>  <BR>Jake takes a fishing trip to Spain with Cohn and his buddy Bill Gorton, after which they stay over in Pamplona to take in the San Fermin fiesta and watch the bullfights with Brett and Campbell.  Jake is not just a casual spectator, but a seasoned \\"aficionado\\" who is intimately familiar with the bullfighting scene.  As the partying continues, passions heat up, a drunken Campbell constantly picks on Cohn, who, like Jake, is infatuated with Brett, and Brett sets her sights on a hot new young matador named Pedro Romero.  Although these plot points seem like they're leading up to some big, explosive climax, Hemingway, who values realism over contrivances, chooses the high road and allows the characters to resolve their conflicts naturally, like human beings, not like Hollywood caricatures. <br />Hemingway's prose in this early novel of his is usually minimalistic but, with something like boyish enthusiasm, becomes more detailed and energetic when describing the things that really interest its author, like trout fishing and bullfighting.  That he manages to capture the intoxicating freedom of these expatriates so directly and concisely is what has made him one of America's greatest literary icons.
B00005N5S5|5.0|James Cameron showed the world his modus operandi for the first time in this spectacular sci fi action- fest starring Schwarzenegger as the Terminator. In his first major action role as the lethal machine, who is aptly described by Michael Biehn's charcter Reese: \\"It can't be bargained with! It can't be reasoned with! It doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear. And it absolutely will not stop, ever, until you are dead!\\" Arnie is the quintessential killing machine on a mission to off Sarah Conner (Linda Hamilton) to prevent the birth of John Conner, the leader of the resistance against the future war of man against the machines.<br />The action is thrilling, heart-pounding stuff, with the Termintor on a mission to kill anyone who gets in the way. Stan Winston's animatronics used to create the Terminator are brilliant and the CG is \\"Whoa\\" material. Director Cameron, (Let's forgive him for Piranha 2) here shows what he can do when it comes to action, and boy, does he do it well! This is truly one of the most explosive, thrilling and amazing sci fi action films ever made. The DVD extras are excellent too, with commentaries, 'making of's, \\"terminated\\" deleted scenes, trailers that fully capture the menace of the machine and the nerve-shredding pace of the film, production info and more. YOU MUST OWN THIS DISC.
B00005OWIU|2.0|I being a huge fan of the Harry Potter books was excited about the movie.  I bought the soundtrack the second day of release and was disappointed.  There is not much variation in the music and it comes off sounding like a star wars christmas cd.  I think we all know that John Williams can do a lot better than this.
B00005T343|2.0|Okay, granted the movie did help with scenes that contained gore, but if you really want the effect the story is trying to send people, read the book.  The movie completely destroyed the ending.  The purpose of Clarice and Hannibal's relationship in Silence of the Lambs and Hannibal is ripped away from you in this movie.  How can Ridley Scott just destroy Thomas Harris's vision?
B00004WGAA|5.0|I've been accused of watching too many of those corny monster flicks from the Fifties.  Actually, I purchased from Amazon a new genre of monster flick from the early Sixties...two of them to be exact.<br />Flick #1 - Carnival of Souls (1962)<BR>Flick #2 - Horror Hotel (1960)<br />For the incredible price ..., I purchased this DVD horror doubleheader that is literally priceless.  No blood...no gore...no profanity...in explicit black and white...this duo of early horror films is a must.  For the price of a rental, YOU TOO could own Carnival of Souls and Horror Hotel.  So what makes them so good?  They are true horror classics.  Both are about places you would never want to go, but for some insane reason you go there anyway to set yourself up for a nightmare.  Actually, \\"nightmare\\" is the best word for both films.  They are shot, edited and scripted right from your dreams.  \\"Carnival of Souls\\" has a perfect title.  It is a horror classic from the pre-Beatles' era starring Candace Hilligoss as the lost soul.  \\"Horror Hotel\\" stars British legend Christopher Lee (need I say more?).  The fog, soundtrack, storyline, eery settings...and wonderful makeup, make both of these gems a MUST.  I would pay $7 for each at an oldies matinee on the big screen...less the price of buttered popcorn.  Are you a classic horror fan?  No? Forget them!!! Yes?  BUY THEM!!!
0800105141|5.0|This movie is a perfect depiction of English Imperialism.  For anyone who doesn't know that much about India, Gandhi really fills in the blanks.  Also, contrary to one reveiwer, Gandhi IS played by an Indian guy.  Ben Kingsley was born Krishna Bhanji.
B000002KET|4.0|I haven't got the knowledge of what has been up in the time this album was released, I haven't lived then. But what I keep hearing is a bloody good record with some weak spots but overall, it's true up to sabbath's legendary status.<br />&quot;Sabra Cadabra&quot; is properbly my favorite on the album. The synths and guitar riffs both melt together to form one hell of a track that rather reminds me of DOORS-like psychedelica than of the straight-out metal from their former albums. Hey, smoke some on that! &quot;A national acrobat&quot; is another highlight, starting off like your typical Sabbath song and ending up with some of Mr. Osbournes most brilliant vocals ever, it really gets addictive. The title track is one of their most well known songs, and for good reason, the flamenco-like guitar part in the refrain flows together real well with Ozzy's yelling. &quot;Looking for today&quot;, yet another superb tune, gotta love those flutes or whatever they are in the chorus. A song that rather reminds of Sabbath post-ozzy era than of &quot;Paranoid&quot;. &quot;Killing yourself to live&quot; seems rather average, despite my CD-Booklet bragging about how this influenced Nirvana and grunge-rock, the song has actually too many parts to have a lasting impression but it's okay. Same goes for &quot;Fluff&quot;, it's nothing really special I wouldn't have put it in the third place on here since it rather breaks the album's natural flow. &quot;Spiral Architect&quot; is another good song, showing a more progressive side of Sabbath and Ozzy on top of his game. The whole album sounds a bit flat produced, not a good thing when there is so much stuff to listen to on it. Oh yeah and I forgot &quot;Who are you&quot;, not the greatest song ever written but still a pleasure to listen to, even if some of the synths sound out of place.<br />All in all, Sabbath may have done better but &quot;Sabbath Bloody Sabbath&quot; is still to be treasured in the hearts of classic rock fans. Get &quot;Paranoid&quot; and &quot;Volume 4&quot; first, but enjoy this record for what it is, a more progressive Sabbath, but still good Sabbath.

B00005RDSM|5.0|PETER PAN remains one of Disney's most fondly-remembered films.  Despite appearing in the same decade as Mary Martin's Broadway and television version, it is neither lessened nor ignored in comparison.<br />Peter Pan (voiced by Disney's resident juvenile lead Bobby Driscoll) takes young Wendy (Kathryn Beaumont) along with Michael and John on a flight of fancy to Neverland, where you can never grow old.<br />In their fantastic adventure, Peter and the Lost Boys battle the nefarious Captain Hook (Hans Conried), the bumbling Crocodile and the bloodthirsty Indians.<br />The story deals with the abandoned dreams of childhood, a child's wish to remain young and the resentment of having to grow up.  James Barrie's story speaks to the child in all of us.<br />This beautiful new DVD reissue coincides with Disney's new sequel, RETURN TO NEVERLAND, and includes a fantastic audio commentary, still galleries, DVD storybook and featurettes.

B00005B4GU|5.0|In conflict with what SOME people might say, Amnesiac is far from techno. Even hearing that makes me sad that people could be that stupid. Radiohead should deserve more credit than that. What they have done here is totally created a new genre. I don't really know what to call it, and I have to say it was daring and a little risky, but OH MAN: they're really nailed it. If you have any kind of an open mind, you'll find Life in a Glass House as an amazing work of art in addition to Pyramid Song and just about every other song on here. I just can't get it through my thick skull how some people can have so little respect for a band as to download an album and then turn around and say it's bad. You have no right to say that in the first place. Or maybe it's me. In any case, I do agree that if you've never heard Radiohead before, you really should get OK Computer first. Then go straight for this when you've become hooked. Only Thom Yorke and the gang could have come up with such a unique and INCREDIBLE sounding masterpiece.

B00005JKED|4.0|An urban poem no-less. Withered flowers and stark reality. This movie was not as predictable as most Hollywood kicks at the can. A worthy DVD for any collection, and has decent re-play value. Although, it will never be a classic.
B0000636UN|3.0|Sheryl Crow's &quot;C'Mon, C'Mon&quot; is a little more rock n'roll that her previous albums.  I enjoy &quot;Soak Up The Sun&quot;  however I feel most of her tunes are very repetitive.  The lyrics leave much to be desired and almost boring.  Overall, I generally enjoyed the CD once, but after that, it quickly grew tired of the repetition.
B000002UCN|3.0|The thing is: I wanted something complete about Harrison only, not the Beatles! I already own all their CDs. I just wanted a complete compilation of his songs...<BR>Where can I find songs like &quot;Crackerbox Palace&quot; for example?<BR>Also not included are the great songs from &quot;Cloud Nine&quot; - yeah I know the album came after this one, but someone needs to wake up and do organize a final compilation...
B00004X0ER|5.0|Today's music listener is often inundated with diluted pop-rock music that pawns itself off as artistic.  Record companies seem intent on signing bands that look good on camera and offer a candystore pop feel that will make them rich. Have we all become sheep? The Hives represent a change in this conservative greed oriented music world.  Their music isn't overwhelmingly innovative but strips rock and roll to its core and exposes the beatiful simplicity of defiance.  Their sound is a conglomeration of 60's garage rock and energetic punk music.  It sounds dirty and raw which is something that has gotten lost in this era of underwhelming creativity.  I think these guys are awesome and I want to hear every song they have ever recorded.  It's been a long time since I have gotten this excited about a new band.
0811826848|5.0|As the group of the century, the Beatles are too much for simple words. But this book does a good job in describing that phenomenon. A lot of eye candy - great pictures... Just grab you CD's and go ahead and indulge yourself!
