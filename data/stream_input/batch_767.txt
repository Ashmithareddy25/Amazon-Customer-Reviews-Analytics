B0011KQSZ4|5.0|Typical British mix of characters and humor.  Matthew McFadyen, so somber in MI-5, is a delight.  Peter Dinklage shows a flair for physical comedy.  Great cast overall. Mishaps keep building to a point of sheer hysteria.  Not quite up to \\"The Wrong Box,\\" another funeral fiasco, but close enough to be worth your time.
0452289963|5.0|A New Earth is an inspiring novel destined to shake most people's perspectives and belief structures, and thus, bring questioning and awakening into our daily lives.  At times the rhetoric is difficult, but overall, this book couldn't have come at a better time in my life.
B00009W0U4|1.0|THIS WAS A POORLY DIRECTED AND EDITED FILM THAT MADE ME FEEL AS IF I WERE  ON A ROLLERCOASTER. ALSO WITH TODAYS TECH THIS DVD COULD HAVE OFFERED THE  ENGLISH LANGUAGE IN THE AUDIO SECTION, ESPECIALY SINCE ALL THE ACTORS IN   THIS FILM ACTUALY SPEAK ENGLISH. MONICA BELLUCCI WAS AS BEAUTIFUL AS EVER,  HOWEVER THAT WAS NOT ENOUGH TO SAVE THIS FILM
B000WTLDPU|5.0|I haven't heard of this movie at all before I found it on Amazon. Friends recommended Neil Gaiman, and I noticed that this movie was based on his novel. What a pleasant surprise! Maybe not as many funny one liner as Princess Bride, but the story is every bit as wonderful, if not more.
0300108834|5.0|This is an amazing little book. I am a big fan of brevity. And this book takes the prize. Apart from providing a delicious overview of world history, this brilliant work contains fascinating trivia on every page. If you've ever wanted to know the answers to the following questions, this book will do it with elegance and grace. Why are the days of the week named the way they are (Sunday, Monday, etc.)? What is the story behind the Gordian Knot? How does the Chinese script work? How was the marathon race invented?
B0000AQS0F|4.0|Joss Whedon broke new ground with his short lived series Firefy. He did not just create a unique space western he created great television. The sad thing is that the powers that were at Fox killed the show before it could ever really develop. True, Firefly, had some issues such as the airing of episodes out of order and in strange timespots but it was certainly a show that with a little development could have survived beyond fourteen sparse episodes. Firefly was so much more than the sum of its parts it was a show that dealt with the bonds between people that come together to create family.    The many reviews here adequately describe the plot and the characterizations. If Whedon could do anything it was to develop strong characters whith great dialogue. The characters made this show and will be a part of Whedon's legacy along with Buffy and Angel. The crew of the Serenity joined together a group of diverse characters threw them together in situations that made them help each other, that made them bind, that made them form a family dynamic unlike many that are seen on  regular television. This, in my opinion, is what made the show worthwhile. Sure, the action and special effects were fun to watch but the dynamic between the characters was even better.    The series comes complete on four discs. The episodes are presented in the correct viewing order and are presented in widescreen. The widescreen treatment was one of the sore points for Fox that Whedon found to be necessary. The audio is Dolby Surround 2.0 but is quite robust for the presentation. The set offers commentaries on six of the episodes and all but the last are of the anecdotal sort. On his final commentary Whedon waxes philosophic about the episode \\"Objects in Space.\\" There are the usual making of features and gag reel. Watching this material shows a cast that enjoyed working together that worked together quite well.    This is one of the finest network series that I have seen in quite a while. Check itout. You will be glad you did.

B000KX0IOA|5.0|Almost absurd that the person who made it possible to peacefully have the 'Leaders of The World', the British, hand over the regime of India to Indians, was nontheless a revolutionary, no matter how peaceful his own personal actions were.

B00014K5TQ|3.0|There are many worse ways you could spend 99 minutes. It's a fine movie and by that I mean good....ish, Macaulay Culkin and Seth Green are really excellent and it shows that Seth Green has huge variety in his acting capabilities. The movie however really focuses on Culkin's and Green's characters rather that the disposed or disposal of the drug dealer. (And to emphasise that point, I can't even remember his name!) But that's probably because those character are more entertaining - which is fine but I felt as a result the murder of a young man was trivialised or made light of in some way.  Far from a cautionary tale because of the way it glorifies the drug world, (even though it does show the `downs' - just not as much as the `ups') this movie is for entertaining and it somewhat achieves that goal.    Not a must for ones collection but worth a look. Get a friend to buy it!

0452289963|5.0|It made me realize some of the ideas and thoughts going on in my life needed to be brought out and utilized.  Get control of those small pitiful feelings that are insignificant and meaningless for a more fuller life and understanding.  Better control over my thoughts and just what do they mean.

God and You are in control, not some hierarchy located in some distance place, who knows no more about the Supreme Being than you do.
B0013BNY2Q|2.0|This cd is marginal at best. The best thing I can say is that it sounds like REM. The worst is that it's a half-hour of fairly poor music with not a single shining moment. It should be unlawful to sell a cd at full price that's this short.

B0014Z4OQG|4.0|I really was looking forward to this movie and in the end I really enjoyed it, but when it started up I was really confused about everything, which looking back on it is probably exactly how the characters felt too, so the film-makers did a great job with that =)<br /><br />I heard a lot of crying about the shaky camera and it did get a little nuts, I really did enjoy the unique tactic of telling a story from a first person perspective and compared to every other cliche'd movie this one stands out pretty well =)<br /><br />The monster is what should have been featured A LOT MORE!!!!!!!  I would have been happy if they strapped a camera to his head, than had him look in the mirror so we all know what he looks like, than he goes on destroying the rest of the city LOL.  That's a big reason I went to see this, I thought it would be like \\"Godzilla: The Return!\\" and I wanted MORE MONSTER!!!<br /><br />The party scene at the beginning is the only thing that slowed the movie down, and if you stay awake through it than you'll find a great movie after =)<br /><br />DVD should be amazing cause I can fast forward through the opening slow-mo party (that's what it seemed like to me) and get right to the \\"real opening\\" where the monster starts to attack =)
B00004T9VY|5.0|For lots of people listening to popular music several decades ago, one of the most enchanting albums of all was Cat Stevens' \\"Tea for the Tillerman.\\" The eponymous song closed out a musical treasure of reflective, thoughtful, and insightful songs.  Song after song lures the listener in, trying to make out the lyrics as the stories spin out.<br /><br />The CD starts off with the wonderful \\"Where Do All the Children Play.\\"  Key lines that typify this song:<br /><br />\\"I know we've come a long way,<br />We're changing day by day.<br />But tell me, where do the children play?\\"<br /><br />These innocent lines are juxtaposed with signs of progress, such as jumbo jets, \\"roads over fresh green grass,\\" skyscrapers filling the air. Simple instrumentation that supports the words and singing.<br /><br />Then, the marvelous \\"Hard Headed Woman.\\"  The opening lines:<br /><br />\\"I'm looking for a hard headed woman,<br />One who will take me for myself.<br />And if I find my hard headed woman<br />I will need nobody else.\\"<br /><br />This kind of partner Stevens longs for, as opposed to \\"I know many fine feathered friends, but their friendliness depends on how you do.\\"<br />Again, rather spare instrumentation, with Stevens himself on guitar and keyboard.  A marvel of a song.<br /><br />Perhaps my favorite cut on the CD--\\"Longer Boats.\\"  There is the hypnotic recurring line:<br /><br />\\"Longer boats are coming to win us,<br />Coming to win us, they're coming to win us.\\"<br /><br />This is a song that stays in your mind, reverberating, long after you have heard it.<br /><br />And so many other fine songs, such as \\"Wild World,\\" \\"Sad Lisa,\\" \\"Miles from Nowhere,\\" \\"But I Might Die Tonight,\\" \\"Father and son,\\" and so on.<br /><br />One of the finest albums of its time--and it still wears well, sounding fresh after all these years.

0691131511|5.0|On page xiii, the author notes that a couple workers in hard hats, after having seen from her office door that she taught Byzantine history, wondered what Byzantine history was. She tried in a few minutes to explain, and they followed up by asking \\"why she didn't. . .write about it for them?\\" And, indeed, she decided to write this volume for a broader audience. Her goal in this book (Page xiv): \\". . .I want you to understand how the modern western world, which developed from Europe, could not have existed had it not been shielded and inspired what happened further to the east in Byzantium.\\"<br /><br />Byzantium originated as the eastern portion of the Roman Empire, while Rome still stood as the center of the Western Empire. Over time, the Western Empire declined and fell (pace Gibbon). The book considers the evolution and development of Byzantium and the Eastern Empire from its start as a Roman bastion in the fourth century (under the Emperor Constantine, after whom the city Constantinople was named) to its final fall in 1453.<br /><br />There is much material covered in this volume.  It is not organized along a strictly chronological template, although there is some temporal ordering--from its foundations to the medieval era to its final demise.  However, in each of these sections, there is coverage of a variety of aspects of the Eastern realm.  The Foundations portion considers Greek Orthodoxy, the great churches, such as Hagia Sophia, continuing links with Rome and, after its fall, Italy, and Roman Law.<br /><br />As we move toward the Medieval era, the author, Judith Herrin, points out the key role of Byzantium in protecting Europe from Islam, by standing as a bastion between Islam and Europe. Also considered is the art and religious artifacts (such as icons) of the Empire. Greek fire, a key part of Byzantium's defenses, is discussed, as are other factors such as the economy, politics, sometime internal instability as intrigues sometimes led to the replacement of one emperor by another.<br /><br />Finally, the inevitable fall, as Byzantium became more and more compressed, surrounded by a new force--Turks. Finally, in 1453, the Turks with their heavy cannon, breached the walls of Byzantium and its existence as an independent state ended.<br /><br />Some nice features: a list of many of the emperors and the dates of their rule (pages 354-356), a chronology of major events (pages 357-361), and fairly well drawn maps (pages 363-373).<br /><br />There is, of course, so much more detail.  The book is solidly written by Herrin (the words don't flow magically, but the language is accessible to most people). Her appraisal of the major role of Byzantium in western history goes into much greater depth than what I am able to mention.  Each reader will have to determine how convincing her arguments are, as she strove the answer the two workers.er.

B0010X8NF0|5.0|I had seen the movie trailers and immediately knew this wasn't a Hollywood commercial movie, just started to wonder when would I have a chance to see it, since I live in Mexico and non-commercial movies are seldom shown in theater screens. My choices: 1.- Download a screener -horrible quality- movie, from someone who had sneaked a videocamera into a theater, or 2.- Pre-order the movie from amazon.    I went for the latter option, it took ages, but as soon as I got it and popped it in the dvd player, I was struck by uncertainty, car chase, celebrity faces, camera movements and still no words spoken. It was thrilling, fast paced, and then... it takes you deep into a families womb, brotherly bonds, secrets, communication (or lack of), complex subjacent motives, (un)attachments, needs, with a dash of casual sex and darkly fun situations; it is definitely a Great, well rounded movie, it certainly deserves watching it over in company of thinking friends (you know, the ones that don't laugh half an hour over a fart), and commenting it over a drink.    If you liked The Royal Tenenbaums, you'll like this one too, four thumbs up ;)

0743486285|1.0|Seems that person was proud to have been already in recovery himself.  The book and or that lifestyle is nothing to as I felt that reviewer did  at least if not brag about similar problems and as if he was thrilled to   copy deadly habits! I was in a band and would never of wanted to relate   such abuse or be proud or brag as he, the reviewer, sounded to \\"follow the leader\\" so to speak! Sad book and admitted the damage but nothing to be proud of. And certainly, I would hope NiKKi Sixx would agree that he would not want his fans to live such self debasing and life threating habits. Be responsible for your decisions and concious of your choices to avoid becoming powerless over your self control. Again, I say I do not believe that was the books intention at all to hear a new musician was proud of or relating to it as maybe cool already to have been in recovery and reviewer... ( Hope you do not read again)                  Rock and Roll careers certainly does not a drug addict make! That is a personal decision and a problem wide spread. Good Luck.

006135323X|4.0|I bought this book after hearing Dan Ariely giving an interview about it on NPR.  His experiments sounded interesting and gave me interest to read more about them.  I've been interested in behavioral economics books for some time now, and was not disappointed with this one.  He writes in a fashion that's easy to read and I found myself finishing the book in just a few seatings.  He draws most of his examples from specific experiments he and his colleages have completed and draws conclusions thereafter.  This is in contrast to other books I've read on the topic (Blink, by Malcolm Gladwell, for example) which use a actual event as a starting point for discussion and then go on to experiments and conclusions.  There were some examples that I had read in other books, but this was something I anticipated.  Overall, I found this to be an interesting read and one that I would recommend to others.

0618918248|5.0|The best book about God I've ever read. Essential reading for everyone from children to adult, atheist to fundamentalist. These arguments against the belief in a creator god must not be ignored. The future of our species depends on us progressing to a higher level of consciousness. Religion cannot take us to the level needed in order to thrive long term.    The God Delusion accurately and directly destroys the weak and thin arguments that the religious make for their beliefs. It also provides irrefutable cases (although the religious refute it anyway) demonstrating that religion, whether true or not, is not harmless. It is dangerous, incites violence, separation and prevents scientific progress that could save lives and make the world a better, safer place for all living things.    The religious fanatics actually do most of the argument for Dawkins. All he needed to do in many cases was present their direct quotes together in a collection. These quotes from religious, public, and political leaders are hilariously irrational statements, while at the same time sobering because hundreds of millions of people actually share their unfounded and baseless beliefs. My favorite parts of the book are these ridiculous quotes from famous politicians, public figures, and religious leaders. They bury themselves in contradictory, hypocritical, and - I can't say it any more delicately - idiotic statements. These span from racist and intolerant to violent and demented.    It is funny that these religious fanatics, who are wholly against the scientific view of the world, do not hesitate to use science when it suits them. They drive cars, take medications, use computers, fly in airplanes, read printed books, eat food, and live in houses that were all built with science. Religion hasn't built anything.    It is almost as if they would argue 1 plus 1 equals 3 if it were said in the Bible. You could show them 2 apples, demonstrate how when you put 1 apple and 1 apple together, there are2 apples, and they would still say there were 3. It's no different.    I rarely write reviews about books on Amazon, but I am deeply concerned about the future of my children and the Earth in general, being run by religious fanatics. Religion and science are not different. They both aim to share the truth about the universe and world around us. The difference is that one is based on reason and evidence while the other is just whatever suits peoples' mental fancies and imaginations. Claims that aren't backed up by logical reason, more than an ancient and contradictory text, are baseless. Scientific claims that are proven false are abandoned immediately. Theories proven false must be abandoned if we are to survive. Religion should not be immune to this scrutiny.     The God Delusion makes an excellent case and creates awareness of these important issues. Hopefully more atheists will come out of hiding to show how few people actually are religious and help prove that religion is an obsolete, antiquated, and dying way of life and looking at the world. Hopefully the world will start growing up soon thanks to books like this.

B00005R24K|5.0|The Evil Dead(or Book of the Dead, as it was originally called) is a 1981 horror film that was written and directed by Sam Raimi. He's famous for movies such as Darkman, The Quick and The Dead, and Spider-Man. Although this isn't his first film, it is his most widely 'acclaimed' film. The film stars Bruce Campbell, Ellen Sandweiss and Betsy Baker. It was made on a budget of $375,000.  It tells the story of five college students who take a vacation in the woods at a cabin which quickly turns into horror when they find an audiotape that is a key to unlocking evil spirits. The film was extremely controversial, in its' day, for its' graphic violence and gore. It is accepted as a classic in the genre these days and has a cult following worldwide.<br /><br />Originally, when I first saw the movie years ago, I didn't like it so much. It was quite different than horror movies of the day back then because of its' excessive use of violence and gore as well as its' dark humor. It wasn't til recently when I purchased the movie that I seen it for what it was truly worth. It's absolutely brilliant. A classic, for sure.<br /><br />If you collect horror movies on DVD, this  is a classic you definitely need in your collection. It stands as a testament of horror movies from way back in the day. You'll get a kick out of it.
B0013BNY2Q|4.0|R.E.M.'s last few albums were not a blast at all, which is why this recent album, \\"Accelerate\\", is like a shock to my system.<br /><br />R.E.M. has never been known for loud, grating songs. In fact, one of their best ballads in a previous album, \\"Everybody Hurts,\\" is a soft, slow tearjerker. However, \\"Accelerate\\" puts the band at its greatest intensity yet, with loud grating guitars. The Counting Crows did the same thing with their recent album, \\"Saturday Nights and Sunday Mornings\\", but while their album feels more like a rehash of old material, R.E.M. really sounds like James Taylor meets Guns and Roses.<br /><br />The very first song, \\"Living Well is the Best Revenge\\", sets the angry tone for the rest of the album. His bellow of the lyrics \\"You set me up like a lamb to slaughter/Garbo as a farmer's daughter\\" are just as venomous. \\"Man-Sized Wreath\\" also has a biting edge, with snarling, dissonant power chords in-between Stipe's lyrics.<br /><br />\\"Hollow Man\\" is probably the most routine R.E.M. ballad song with sunny power chords. However, as indicated by the title, this song is not happy at all--it's a biting cry of frustration. Stipe's lyrics, \\"Corner me and leave me something/I've become the hollow man\\", are a clear criticism of the disturbance of conditions in America.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong--there are soft songs in this album. However, they are more like short breaths of air before R.E.M. jams with more chords of fury. This is clearly a different R.E.M. than I've heard before, more outspoken than ever.<br /><br />There are a few low points to the album. \\"Houston\\" repeats the same old two-chord progression a million times on an organ and guitar, as if I haven't remembered those two chords the first time. Also, the melodies in this album are not nearly as memorable as their previous jams on \\"Life's Rich Pageant\\".<br /><br />However, the tone of the album is more appropriate for the politically charged atmosphere of today. It's hard to find a better album that vents the frustration of America. The chords are dissonant, loud and grating. The lyrics are biting. And Michael Stipe has never been in better form.rds are dissonant, loud and grating. The lyrics are biting. And Michael Stipe has never been in better form.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|Wraps up the Ori story arc very nicely.  I would recommend this for all Stargate fans.  However, the movie does assume that the viewer has been following the tv series.  The movie tries to catch up at the beginning, but would leave anyone who has not been following the series confused.
B0013FXWU6|3.0|\\"There Will be Blood\\" was a mixed bag for me.  Sorry, but there are moments of greatness and there are just moments.     I will not deny that some of the visual scenes captured by Bob Elswit are some of the most spectacular that are on film.  The oil drilling scenes are simply unparalleled- absolutely some of the best camera work that I have ever seen-VERY memorable.    Jonny Greenwood's dissonant violins are used to great effect, as well as the pizzicato strings, the arpeggiated cello and the triumphant Brahm's Violin Concerto to fit the mood and the action of this film. This was an ideal soundtrack that propelled and energized the film, creating superb tension.    My biggest problem is the screenplay by Paul Anderson.  The attempt is huge, but is so overly focused on Daniel Plainview ( I think the name speaks volumes) that Anderson's attempt to rival Plainview's greed and contemptible behavior with that of the other oilmen and of the opportunist preacher, Eli Sunday, causes the film to be very lopsided in over focusing on a character who refuses to speak about his past and is simply what you see \\"in plain view\\" like oil on top of the ground with the underbelly yet to be tapped. Though these characters were well acted, they never become any more than cardboard cut-outs with no heart  revealed.  These characters, even the oil-drillers and the church people have little to no affect in them. In the final scene in the bowling alley, there is a great explosion of temperament, but in the end what is revealed except what is \\"in plain view.\\"    I absolutely stuck with the film, though I personally felt that the film was very uneven overall.  The film began to unravel  at the 1928 point when H.W marries Mary and the scene shifts to the grand house where Plainview lives.  From that point, what had been a very well calculated film became rushed and ultimately sought to reveal motivation of the main characters which turned out to be nothing shocking at all.  Plainview and Sunday were never anymore than what you ever saw in the film from the very start-opportunists.  The ending???  Not my choice! I felt as though I had just seen the ending of \\"The Sopranos\\".  Where is Plainview going from here?: more despicable behavior? more greed? more need to be #1? more killing? more rage with no understanding of inner self? How any lower, humanly speaking, can a character go in morality and still keep rising to the top of the heap?  Is there not a limit to both?    Like I said....a mixed bag for me...a mixed bag!
B00003CWRX|4.0|A great expose of the tobacco industry and their lies to get their product sold and you addicted to nicotine.  It also shows the destructive power of bad corporations that don't care about the public good.
B00000GAIW|2.0|Terrific album, lousy sound quality.  I love this album, but don't understand why Capitol can't spend a few bucks remastering the thing.  It sounds like it's from 3rd generation tapes--they could have done a better job recording the vinyl to CD.  Very disappointing.
B000088E6D|5.0|I love this CD, it is fun to listen to and I even put in on at work. Great CD, and good price, too.
0452287588|1.0|I was dissapointed in the content of this book.  The author makes many references to God and the teachings of Jesus, but twists the meanings to suit his own purpose.  It is very Humanistic and Unitarian approach - 'Heaven is a new way of thinking' etc.    You can still learn alot about yourself and how materialistic you may have become.    This book is probably great for someone still seaching for meaning and peace in their life - but couldn't accept God.
B00007GZR5|4.0|This movie was a must see. I really enjoyed it. The movie came on time. Very fast delivery. The movie itself was in good condition. Robin Williams was really good in this film. The seriousness in this film shows. An overall great family film.

B0013BNY2Q|5.0|This is REM's best work since New Adventures in Hi-Fi. I strongly recommend this cd to everyone. Not just Rock or REM fans, anyone. This cd is so great. I know it's only April of 2008. But it is destined to be my \\" Album of the Year.\\" Remember the first time you heard \\"one i love\\" or \\"What's the frequency, Kenneth?\\", It's like that over and over again with each song. It's a far stretch from \\"Up\\" and \\"Reveal\\". Even Michael Stipe said those discs were not what he wanted them to be. They took their time on \\"ACCELERATE\\" to make songs that rocked, and other songs that would make you think differently, like \\"Everybody Hurt's\\" did so long ago. Now I'll admit this is no \\" Automatic for the People\\" but it is their best album in 12 years. Listen to \\"Hollow Man\\" and you will see what I mean. Write them to have more concerts in the U.S. ([...])  I hope God blesses this band in all that they do. Peace

B000VDDDY6|5.0|I was quite impressed with the improvements that were made in the original series, without changing the feel of the episodes.  The special effects are improved, but the feel of the 60s is still maintained.  I am not sure that I would have noticed the improvements if I had not watched the bonus features first.    Great job!
B000R7I3LY|4.0|In these times of terrible, crappy, who cares?, no talent artists, it's nice to see an album by an artist that can actually sing and write a decent song. Instead of overpowering the senses with tons of production and effects, Sara CAN actually sing and she does so beautifully with an album full of nicely crafted tunes and heartfelt performances. In comparison to all the crap that is out there and the daily bombardment of non-music and booty-crap, this is a great album.
B0013D8LOK|5.0|I have seen many incarnations of Sweeny Todd on stage.  I am originally from LA, and frequently had a friend in a production somewhere.  Let me say up front, that I do not like this play/musical.  I never have.  The blood and violence have always seemed an unappealing subject for a musical, especially in juxtaposition to Sondheim's wonderful score.  However, my not liking the subject matter does NOT preclude me from recognizing and enjoying an outstanding production and an amazing performance.<br /><br />I am not certain that anyone other than Tim Burton and Johnny Depp could have pulled off this masterpiece.  Tim Burton was an inspired choice as director; unique and quirky enough to bring Sondheim's bizarre vision to the big screen. The cinematography was perfect:  the mood, color pallet, camera angles, and editing all adding to the brilliance.  The color choice for and \\"performance\\" of the blood actually made the blood itself another character in the story.<br /><br />When I first heard of Johnny Depp's selection to play Sweeny Todd, my initial reaction was \\"Really?,\\" and then, \\"Maybe...\\"  Johnny Depp's performance is truly outstanding. This film raises his acting credentials to a whole new level.  Depp owns this role, playing it will the prefect combination of drama, comedy, and, yes, just a touch of camp.  The emotions are real, deep, and believed; Depp commits 300% to the character.  And guess what?  He can sing.  I admit to being shocked by that.  His voice is very appropriate to the character and pleasant to listen to.  Is it a big, Broadway voice?  No.  But what it lacks in power, he certainly surpasses in pathos.  The interpretation and emotion of the songs are a true revelation to the depths of Depp's talent.<br /><br />The rest of the cast simply strengthens this production even further.  Allan Rickman, Timothy Spall, Sacha Baron Cohen, Helena Bonham Carter, even an extremely brief appearance by Anthony Stewart Head, as well as host of others, all add talent, depth, and excellence.<br /><br />These actors and this director truly do justice to this strange and odd musical.  The film did not disappoint; I was actually riveted.  IMHO, this is one of the best movies of the year and a truly inspired performance by Johnny Depp.  If you like Sondheim, Burton, Depp, musicals, or even blood and gore, I highly recommend this amazing film.ce.

B000KKPN5C|5.0|I wanted the SB-600 Flash unit for my Nikon D80 but they were sorta expensive.  Then I read about the new smaller SB-400 on Kenrockwell.com.  He loved it and I really trust his judgement.  I tried to get a good deal on eBay but they were going used for the same price Amazon had them new.  I'm not a pro but I really have gotten tired of the limited range and redeye associated with the D80's (and most DSLRs') built-in pop-up flash unit.  The SB-400, with it's tilt-up bounce flash capability is exactly what I needed.  It works well, doesn't add a lot of weight to the camera when installed and fits nicely in my camera bag.  It comes with a handy little carrying pouch too.  Well done, Nikon!!!
B0009P42S2|4.0|Any fan of Anime, or the work of Director Katsuhiro Otomo (you will most likely know him for his work on Akira), will appreciate this film. While not reaching the depth and intricate plot of Akira, this is still a worthy addition to your collection. There are a few missteps in the animation choices, but most viewers won't notice, and will find this a great voyage through alternate history. The vocal dubbing in English is superb, and the voices are provided by a stellar list of actors - including the renowned Patrick Stewart.
B000SXBOP4|5.0|This is an amazing album, by David Bowie, released during the height of the Glam Rock Years (from 1969-1973).  This marked a period during Bowie's recording career where he experimented with sexually ambiguous posturing (complete with sparkly jumpsuit ensembles and make-up to match), along with a distinctive and \\"other worldly\\" style of singing.  Every song on this album, from \\"Five Years\\" through to \\"Rock n' Roll Suicide\\" takes the listener on an odyssey through the world of Bowie's alter ego--the flamboyant Ziggy Stardust.  This album is in a sense an allegorical rock opera journey.<br /><br />Stardust has been described as \\"a Martian who comes to Earth to liberate humanity from banality.\\"  [a quote lifted from Wikipedia]  This includes dabbling with drugs and sex, which ultimately destroy him.  This is indicative in the songs that Stardust croons in a half tortured/half punk style, along with lyrics rich with innuendo alluding to space travel, sex, drugs, and liberation on all plains.  The melodies have a very triumphant \\"anthem\\" quality to them (complete with amazing guitar work) and are as compelling today as they were in 1972.  This is truly one of David Bowie's masterpieces (in my opinion and the opinion of others).
0395645662|5.0|The Giver is powerful for its demonstration that life without tension is not really life at all.  We can always try to smooth over or hide another bump in the road, another cause of stress or discomfort.  But, in doing so, we only deceive ourselves and take away from the most worthwhile part of existence.  Without pain, loss, and difference, we can not have love, hope, and the vibrancy of life.  This is a warning that we must be willing to risk our deepest selves to truly live.

B000OVLBIU|4.0|Nicholas Cage plays Johnny Blaze; a motorcycle stuntman who sells his soul to Mephistopheles to save his father from dying of terminal cancer. His father is killed in a tragic motorcycle accident during an exhibition. So distraught Johnny leaves his home, the carnival and his girlfriend Roxanne, to start a new life. A few years later Mephistopheles strikes a deal with Blaze to release give him back his soul as long as Johnny becomes the Ghost Rider by night. The Ghost Rider is a fiery demon bent on protecting the innocent and is employed to help Mephistopheles defeat his nemesis and son Blackheart. Blackheart and his accomplices Gressil, Wallow & Abigor are hell bent on becoming rulers of the Earth, but only one thing stands in their way and that's the Ghost Rider.<br /><br />This is actually quite a good movie and I feel a lot of people gave this quite unfair criticism. The intensity of some of the characters is unparalelled yet the acting is quite one dimensional. This is a great film but by no means perfect, possibly the only good acting is portrayed by those who characters matter in the film. Cage as Blaze, Fonda as Mephistopheles & Bentley as Blackheart as all excellent choices and fit their characters perfectly.<br />I've never been a fan of Eva Mendes' acting and this film merely re-enforces my hatred for her so called acting \\"skills.\\" Cage is quite surprising as I did expect him to have trouble playing a character that is meant to be quite young. However, he portrays the side of Blaze that is Psychotic, yet, troubled perfectly. The first image that comes to mind is when he first transforms into the Ghost Rider, he has this scarily maniacle look in his eyes that is extremely intimidating.<br /><br />Overall though this is still quite a good film and although it is let down in some parts with certain scenes, other parts will make up for it which is why it got a 4 star rating.<br /><br />You should try to watch this film before buying as it's one of those movies which you either love or hate. I loved it but still felt it could have improved a great deal if the casting choices were smarter.ate.

B0010YSD7M|5.0|This movie was excellent!!!  I would give it 10 stars if I could.  It ended the show amazingly well.  Bravo to everyone who made this movie possible, without it and we would have been sitting in the dark as to what happened next.  I can't wait for the next movie to come out later this year.
0452289963|1.0|This book definitely did not meet my expectations.  As a Christian, it disagreed with many of my beliefs.  If you are Christian looking for a book of inspiration, this is not it.  While Eckhart may quote from the Bible,  new or ungrounded Christians can be misled.  I wish now that I had not wasted my money.
B00004SZWD|5.0|This CD is probably the best Stevie Wonder has ever made.  I remember when it came out and I knew that Stevie was destined to be great forever.  I hoped that he would progress from here but I think this CD remains his best work ever.  I still think there is more that Stevie Wonder has to give the world in terms of music.  I think he can be one of the greatest composers of our time--right up there with Aaron Copeland and Leonard Bernstein.
032147404X|4.0|This book has good information especially for amateur photographers. Advanced amateur photographers would probably not find much new here but for me it is a great reference that compliments my camera's manufacturer's user manuals and a user guide written by a third party (I have a Sony A700 DSLR). I also enjoyed the humor of the author, it puts things in perspective.

B0011NVC9I|5.0|Or---\\"He comes from the Land of the Ice and Snow!\\"<br /><br />Look man: You know Times are getting tough when a Monster can't go next door and tell the neighbors to keep a lid on it. I mean, Have some sympathy for the Devil, man: I'm talking about poor, twisted, mewling, scarred, warped, stretched, folded, spindled and mutilated Grendel, the cave-dwelling monster that gets Robert Zemeckis's eye-popping \\"Beowulf\\" off to its high-octane start.<br /><br />It's the end of the age of High Magic and the beginning of the Age of Man: so the skalds in the ale-halls sing---and with the latter comes the fact that it's damned near impossible where a man-eating monster can't get a decent night's sleep.<br /><br />Jeez. What's a Monster to do when the horn-helmed rowdies three valleys and a mountain range over won't shut up? Yeah, true, you gotta fight for yer right to party, but you also gotta fight for your right to a good night's sleep.<br /><br />So demonstrating that all Politics is really Local, Grendel (conjured up to whiney, howling, shockingly terrifying surreality by the immortal Crispin Hellion Glover) ambles on in to Ye Olde Meade Hall and shows 'em a face only a Mother could Love. I've had nights back in grad school like that, only I didn't fling people across the dorm. Might have been cathartic.<br /><br />Whatever it is, it means that a) it soon gets really tough to hire good help at Heorot's Olde Meade Hall; b) business starts jumpin' for the local Undertaker! and c) King Hrothgar (Anthony Hopkins clothed in his CGI birthday suit, baby!), unlike Tina Turner, needs another hero before the Danish party-scene starts lookin' like Beirut.<br /><br />Happily, a Geat NEEDS TO EAT! Beowulf (voiced by Ray Winstone, who trades his yellow speedo from \\"Sexy Beast\\" for a little chainmail and horned helm here) that is, hero of the Geats, and a dude with a great singin' voice! He hoists his vorpal sword in hand and does a little bedding down in Ye Olde Mead Hall, and it's not long before Grendel comes calling for a little late-night Danish Doorbell Ditching and the rest, as they say, is History (which can soon be said for Grendel as well).<br /><br />But remember what I said about Grendel having a face only a Mother could love? Well, he does. And so this particularly tall Tale gets Taller and sports---well, a Tail.<br /><br />Now: Bobby Zemeckis sexed up the million-year old Anglo-Saxon borefest (reputedly \\"Beowulf\\" may be older than John McCain!) with a little help from comics visionary Neil Gaiman: the storytelling here is really what we needed way back in junior high, when hormones were racing and the turgid tale before us was not. The pace is sheer, supple, and enormously satisfying---very primal.<br /><br />But you really go check out \\"Beowulf\\" for one thing: you're seeing the Future, baby, and it works. I saw \\"Beowulf\\" in 3-D on an IMAX screen and the effect---true three-dimensional cinema---made me purr: I now understand George Lucas and James Cameron's fascination with the possibilities of 3-D film.<br /><br />It's a truly immersive experience, an insurgent rush that airdrops the viewer into the film, a lush, living landscape all the more pregnant with possibility and menace, and the revolutionary possibilities for this new medium became immediately apparent from the brilliant, jaw-dropping tracking shot back and away and over the Danes Mead Hall, up over a wintry and sleeping landscape, to the craggy lair of a drowsing Ogre.<br /><br />The technology is all the more ingeniously deployed in a film like Beowulf, where you're huddling in the smokey Mead Hall while some huge and furious Thing batters against the doors, or clutched on the back of a rat between a falcon's claws flying high above a winter landscape, or perched oozily behind one of Grendel's scabby, suppurating ears. I found myself reaching out into space like a giddy cat to touch the rusty, finely honed spearpoint of a halberd made real in three dimensions, or to grab ata chestful of baubles and booty tossed my way across a trestle table.<br /><br />And speaking of a chestful of booty, Angelina Jolie (Grendel's Mama)can slink into my Meade Hall any ol' time; couple that with Zemeckis's rabble-rousing envelope pushing (ripping! shredding!) technology, a lean, mean, & provocative storyline that delves into the murkier territory of the ancient Legend, and Ray Winstone opening up a vorpal can of Anglo-Saxon throwdown (new \\"Beowulf\\" tagline: \\"GEAT IS MURDER!\\"), and \\"Beowulf\\" is a real Dragonslayer that is almost embarrassingly and compulsively watchable.<br /><br />JSGspeaking of a chestful of booty, Angelina Jolie (Grendel's Mama)can slink into my Meade Hall any ol' time; couple that with Zemeckis's rabble-rousing envelope pushing (ripping! shredding!) technology, a lean, mean, & provocative storyline that delves into the murkier territory of the ancient Legend, and Ray Winstone opening up a vorpal can of Anglo-Saxon throwdown (new \\"Beowulf\\" tagline: \\"GEAT IS MURDER!\\"), and \\"Beowulf\\" is a real Dragonslayer that is almost embarrassingly and compulsively watchable.

B0001ARCFA|5.0|This is a review for recreational use at home.<br /><br />My friend has the [[ASIN:B000G3LCQC Grado Prestige Series SR80 Stereo Headphone]]and at first I was going to get those, but comfortability and durability became a concern. Oddly enough these AKG headphones turned out to also be cheaper when taking into account the cost of shipping, for these were free shipping and the Grado's were not. My only concern was that their size would prevent me from ever taking them out of the house, but this was something I could live with.<br /><br />The moment I received them in the mail I was happy that I chose them. They appear to be extremely durable, which is a good thing because I'm always hard on my headphones. They are much more comfortable than the grado's and the sound is equivalent.<br /><br />If you want some headphones to listen to music at home that are comfortable, affordable, and provide you with optimal sound quality, look no further. The only reason I'd ever consider the grado's is because they are smaller and a little bit more portable, but if your looking for headphones on the go earbuds are better.
0553383663|5.0|The Google Story by  David A. Vise  is a clear and straightforward look at the history of this fabled company. It is written for the lay person, not just techies or business types.  Anyone can, and should, enjoy it and be fascinated at this unusual company and its founders, Sergey Brin and Larry Page.<br /><br />The story is told chronologically beginning with Sergey and Larry's academic careers as undergraduates at the Universities of Maryland and Michigan respectively. Both, of course, are bright and end up as graduate students at Stanford during the height of the dot com boom.  In this regard, the book provides an interesting insight into Stanford and the connection between the university and the surrounding business community. The \\"Google Guys\\" as Vise keeps referring to them, try at first to sell their nascent search engine for $1 million with the intention of remaining in graduate school. Fortunately (as it turns out) there were no takers and the two young men reluctantly decide to leave Stanford and start their own company.  Vise consistently refers to their business naivety, inherent goodness and iconoclastic approach to business.  For example, the name \\"Google\\" itself is a misrepresentation of the word for an infinite number (googol).<br /><br />As the story progresses exciting things happen, both good (mostly) and bad.  Vise gives an even-handed presentation. The good outweighs the bad, but that is the reality with Google, one of the most phenomenally successful companies in American history.  The good includes the ability of the Google Guys to convince two of the leading venture capital firms (Kleiner, Perkins and Sequoia Capital) to invest heavily in their firm without having to give up control, the incredible success of the IPO despite an unorthodox approach, development of an advanced system for sending and organizing emails (gmail) and the continuing development of new ideas such as digitalizing all the major library collections and plans for expansion into the fields of biology and genetics.<br /><br />Vise may, however, be faulted for, in my view, glossing over the problems Google faced along the way. For example he discusses the fact that gmail constitutes an unwarranted invasion of privacy in that it reads email messages in order to put relevant advertisements in the sponsored links section, but then nothing more is said about this subject. He also writes that Google acknowledged that it violated its own code of ethics (do no evil) in order to gain entry into the lucrative Chinese market by allowing the Chinese government to censor its content.  More tellingly, in the chapter entitled \\"The China Syndrome\\" Vise examines the competition between Microsoft and Google. He indicates that Microsoft set out to counter the Google challenge as it had so many other challenges in the past. He even quotes Microsoft CEO Steve Ball Ballmer as saying, \\"I'm going to f...ing kill Google.\\"  The chance comes up when a key Microsoft employee, Dr. Kai-fu Lee, decides to leave the company and work for Google as the new head of its China operations despite the fact that his contract with Microsoft contained a one year \\"no compete\\" clause. Microsoft, even Bill Gates personally, told Dr. Lee that they would sue him in order to get at Google.  Despite this warning Dr. Lee did leave and went to work for Google in China. Microsoft then filed a lawsuit against Google in what Vise calls a \\"war.\\" Vise then indicates that a \\"preliminary ruling by a judge in the state of Washington barred Lee from engaging in work that involved search or Google's plans for China, giving Microsoft a temporary victory pending a full trial in January.\\" But at this point Vise changes gears and begins writing about a birthday party at Google to celebrate the first year of the IPO. When he does come back to the Lee case some pages later all he says is that Microsoft and Google \\"reached a settlement in the Kai-fu Lee case and indicated that the settlement terms were not disclosed but that Dr. Lee was now free to work for Google. Thus what started out as a potentially major issue just fizzles away.<br />Perhaps because of the relative shortness of the book (less than 300 pages of text), Vise was forced to leave out details on many matters. In any case, the book falls far short of being a definitive, in-depth study of the company. Finally, he also raises the issue of \\"click fraud,\\" (people just clicking on an advertisement without the intention of buying anything thereby incurring a cost to the company, but does not provide much in the way of what Google is doing about it.<br /><br />The book also gives insights into personal and business success if the reader is familiar with that literature.  For example, Brin and Page are highly focused (Focal Point by Brian Tracy) they use a win/win strategy with a competitor, Ask Jeeves (The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People by Stephen Covey), they have a burning desire for creating the best search engine (Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill) and their focus is on achieving goals, constant improvement and staying positive (The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari by Robin Sharma).<br /><br />The appendices to the book are also useful.  The first gives a number of valuable tips on how to make maximum use of Google. The second, a copy of the so-called GLAT test that is administered to potential new employees is a dud, first of all because it is difficult to get the answers (I could not get them from the website indicated in the book), and secondly when I did get them they proved to be disappointing--either impossibly hard or lacking any answer other than personal judgment.<br /><br />In sum, the book is well worth reading. I give it a five star rating because it is a very good way for the average person to learn about this important company.t that Dr. Lee was now free to work for Google.

B0014Z4OQG|1.0|One of the worst movies I've seen in some time. Other than some cool action and all the insufferable main characters dying, there is nothing redeeming about this film whatsoever. There's certainly no point or meaning despite what wanna-be critics and fanboys will try to tell you. Void of any legitimate thrills or even remote sense of terror. A poorly conceived mess with laughable dialogue, awful acting, completely unlikeable morons and way too many utter absurdities to even go into. Sounds like a review of Lost.

B00005MP58|5.0|An excellent 6 hour version of Austen's novel, with sharply drawn characters and a broad sweep of life within the landed gentry. The gradual attitude shifts in the main characters are sometimes glossed over without development and are sometimes confusingly portrayed, so some relationship changes seem abrupt. Reading the novel will fill in the gaps. Dialogue is true to the novel without seeming stilted. You will not want to use contractions ever again. The dancing and music are mesmerizing, especially when the dialogue is so beautifully timed with it.  The \\"extra features\\" advertised on the DVD are minimal - the \\"background/making of\\" is shallow and shows very little behind the scenes or interviews with main characters.
0452289963|4.0|When Eckhart Tolle says he has learned to act apart from the influence of his ego, I now believe him.  This book is written with a depth of understanding and compassion that could only come from one in touch with universal wisdom.  What is more, the author does not \\"talk down\\" to his audience or presume he is far more advanced than the rest of us, as do so many spiritual and self-help authors.    I don't think I actually learned anything new from this book; but the truths Mr. Tolle puts forth are so clearly and compellingly stated that my life has actually changed for the better as a result of reading it.    Tolle's easy, conversational writing style fits his unassuming straightforward personality and belies the profundity of the truths he gently shows us.

B0014DC0AK|5.0|This remaster sounds fantastic, if anyone out there is wondering if it's worth the upgrade, it is. The guitars are thicker and the bass is much more prominent, overall it's cleaner and louder (obviously). I love this album more than ever now, and it's still the best metal album of all time. There isn't much more to say since it's a remaster. buy it.

0452289963|5.0|[[ASIN:0141027592 A New Earth]]. For those who are ready for a purpose and a change in their lives, this book will help guide you through the process. Many may not 'get' the message the book conveys, that's OK. If you are one of those individuals, put the book away for 10 or 20 years, or better yet, give the book to someone who feels an emptiness in their souls and who are searching for a higher meaning. The person will thank you. For me, the book has helped bring a deeper sense of who I am and why I am here. I feel more confident, I'm no longer stressed out by things that use to bother me and I have a sense of peace I did not have before reading this book. I now have the courage to walk away from the people and things that were affecting my life in a negative way. Living in the moment is life altering. Because of the knowledge I gained from reading this book, I am ready to move forward and pursue my dreams. THANK YOU MR.TOLLE FOR WRITING THIS INCREDIBLE, INSPIRATIONAL BOOK. IT IS TRULY TO BEST MONEY I EVER SPEND.
1594489505|4.0|I am one of the few who haven't read \\"The Kiterunner\\" yet. I know, I know. I belong to two bookclubs and one of them is reading \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" for this month so I finally have the opportunity to read Hosseini's books. Since I have just finished \\"Three Cups of Tea,\\" this book is a splendid follow-up to that one. It may be a novel, but it is such an interesting look into women's lives in Afghanistan.     It is also a poignant reminder that war is hell. Though this book revolves around two women married to the same brute of a man, the backdrop of various wars is evident throughout this novel. One can't help but wonder if war hadn't come to Kabul, if Laila would have married Rasheed. Mariam was long married to Rasheed before Laila entered the scene. Mariam seems to be of the past where women were raised to submit to their parents' choices. Laila was raised to think for herself. Two different generations are met in this novel and together, these two women endured a brutal marriage and hardships, by being friends.     This is a novel of friendship, enduring love and dreams broken and renewed again. It shows the brutual treatment of women in the Taliban regime. It shows heartache and loss of a mother's grief, a lover's disappointed awakening to reality. It is a novel of lies and deceits and broken dreams. But it also shows that no matter what, there always lies hope and optimism waiting to be discovered.    This is an intimate look at two women's lives that are entertwined by the fact they both were married to the same man. Mariam is the childless elder wife and Laila is the grieving young wife and together, they overcome the oppression.     It is an interesting novel and beautifully written. It is an intriging look into the mindset of people in a beautiful city ruined by war and greedy warlords. It shows how men have such a deep disdain for women and yet, there are men who have the opposite beliefs. It is a reminder for us Western women on how much we have tobe thankful for.     It is definitely a thought-provoking novel and one that is absolutely perfect to share with other book lovers. I am glad that I finally took the time to see why everyone else has been saying about this author. Now, I will just have to read \\"The Kiterunner\\" a little bit sooner.    4/5/08
031286504X|4.0|This book delves into the mind, daily toil, and the immense loneliness a person might experience: his house is messy, disorganized, and only those tasks essential to survival take precidence, as laundry and routine dusting are dismissed.<br /> Robert Neville fights to supress hi<br />s sexual urges, becomes his own greatest threat as, sheltered from the vampires in his fort, he drinks himself into stupor, and contemplates the futility of existence and entertains offering himself to the vampires to allow them to end the life he ceases to value.<br /> Neville regards the vampire, as any human might, as an abomination, an evil creature that threatens life. The irony is that Neville is the rarity as a non-vampire, and the role of incarnate evil is reversed. His routine of hunting and killing the vampires during the day is justified by his need to feel safe, to protect himself. But to the vampire he is the bogey-man, the creature that takes lives while society slumbers. His realization of this dynamic between hiself and the vampiric society is what drives this book to the top of my favorites. It's seems a metaphore for the need to change with the world around you, to recognize your place and to be possessed of the ability to reevaluate your relationships, your position, and recognize the truth of your interaction with those around you. (Might have something to do with being written after WWII)<br /><br /> Enjoy the read.

1400049628|5.0|I've always loved Zombie movies and games. Their te one movie monster that still scares the crap out of me. and I think they always will. But this is not the first time I've bought this book. My first copy was torn apart, I can only assume in the first zombie attack in my house hold. Fear not I survived.    So I bought a second copy and a third for my significant other's children (13 and 16) and over the next couple years, it come to look like it seens a few Zombie attacks, complete wit blood and moister damage. being delicate now and about to fall apart I've decided to frame it with a machete in one of those \\"IN CASE OF ZOMBIES - Brake Glass!\\" displays. But I love this book and the boys have destroyed their and well on the way of destorying mine. So I bought another.    Yep, I fully recommend this book to everyone and anyone serious in safeguarding their family from the horrors of the living dead.

B000002UB3|5.0|I've listened to Abbey Road dozens of times. Tonight as I listened to the CD, I was motivated to write about the sound quality. It sounds like a poor transfer. I have the Mobile Fidelity Sound Labs vinyl, and though it has been a long time since I listened to it, it is much more tolerable than the CD. Why? The CD sound is a plastic imitation. Ringo's cymbals sound like white noise. The drums are all stick and no skin. Bass is flabby and indistinct (granted, even on the Mobile Fidelity release it is not anything to praise, but the CD is worse). The organ on Harrison's \\"Something\\" sounds more like a Casio keyboard than a Hammond. There's a smudging of everything and very little sense of open space around any of the vocals or instruments. I could go on and on, but if anyone can get a superior analog version of this album, they can make their own comparison. I think in almost every category, any trained listener would find the CD sound worse.<br /><br />Yet, I have trepidations about the inevitable remastered versions of the Beatles catalog that are rumored to be just around the corner. When they remade the Let It Be album (Let It Be Naked), the sound had more clarity, but it also seemed dynamically compressed. I could live with it, if they did that to the other albums, but I would not be completely satisfied.<br /><br />Most people will think I am just nitpicking. But good music deserves a decent transfer from the master tape. Comparing the CD with the vinyl, this didn't happen when Abbey Road was transfered to digital. I find the CD convenient, but it is always a strangely unsatisfying experience. The CD gives an impression of this great album, but the unnatural timbres of instruments and electronic quality of the voices deaden the beauty of the songs.<br /><br />If you buy this, just remember that there is more to this album than you will ever hear from the CD. We hope for better... maybe the remastered version. But I may just digitally record my vinyl copy. It may well outdo any future remastering.<br /><br />UPDATED MARCH 2011: The 2009 remaster of Abbey Road is not perfect, but in bass quantity and quality, in smoothness, overall clarity, and organic wholeness of the sound -- it beats the earlier release handily. The 2009 CD remaster even beats vinyl versions I've heard. There are new vinyl releases of this album coming, which may best the CD, but that is just an audiophile hope at this point. In my opinion, the original CD release has little to recommend it. I'll never listen to it again. Go for the remaster.remastering.

B000UBMZ4S|4.0|... if you have an HD-DVD player and want to buy this release of Blade Runner - import this version, don't get it from the UK as 90% of the extras, including the disc with all previous incarnations of Blade Runner in a branching format. I'm not a massive Blade Runner fan, but the American Final Cut is better value for money than the UK one, which is why I chose to import it.  HD-DVD being region free is what really led to the death of the format in the Hi-Def War, if you ask me. Make the most of the imports while you can!

B000SZLSB2|5.0|I first saw James Blunt on a TV show and just loved his sound.  I'm a grandmother who does not listen to the newest songs on the radio so I hadn't heard his biggest hit, Beautiful, before and so he was a new voice to me.  I bought the CD he was talking about on the show I saw and absolutely love it.  My grandkids think I'm cool that I own a James Blunt CD, so it's a win win.  His voice is very different from the \\"norm\\", whatever that may be, but it's soothing and very lovely.  Give it a try.
B0010ZR160|4.0|Ben Affleck is a smart actor who succumbed to the easy path afforded by his good looks in Hollywood and the pitfalls of celebrity in the modern age by dating a woman for whom the tail might forever wag the dog. His penance was the loss of professional credibility.    He has reclaimed that credibility partly through a solid performance in last year's, Hollywoodland, and perhaps now completely through a triumphant directorial debut with this tough, uncompromising adaptation of Dennis Lehane's, Gone, Baby Gone.    Mr. Affleck's roots are in the lower rent Boston neighborhoods that are the setting for this story, and he displays a sure feel for their texture and tone in every scene. The scenario the novel lays out, the abduction of a 4-year-old-girl as investigated by two local and inexperienced Boston PI's, may be a crime thriller, but the director makes the material come alive through the careful attention he pays to bringing that world to life: the vernacular, the sounds, the faces of people who spend their entire life within a few square miles.    As one might expect from any actor turned director, he elicits exemplary performances from a stellar cast. Ed Harris, Morgan Freeman, Amy Madigan and John Ashton are all strong, and Michelle Monoghan is solid as one half of the duo of private detectives. But the most impressive turns are from Casey Affleck as the other PI, for whom this work will prove a milestone in his development as an actor, and Amy Ryan as the girl's mother, a drugged out degenerate that strains the audience's sympathy.     As with most crime thriller plots, the third act brings some unwieldy exposition required to resolve the mystery, a challenge which Mr. Affleck answers by relying on his cast to carry the day. They do not let him down. By the end we are left with a dark movie that illuminates the human experience without capitulating to any demand for tidy, \\"happy\\" endings, which makes for a rich and deeply satisfying film.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|GREAT!!!!! That is all I can say. I could hardly wait to get to the next episode to see the plot twists.

I can't wait for the 2nd Season to be released.

From here you go to Stargate SG1... ten seasons of fascinating adventure with a wonderful cast.  This movie stars Kurt Russell who can make you believe he can truly do anything that needs to be done.  James Spader is also at his best.  Even if you don't consider yourself a sci-fi fan you can enjoy this one... adventure at its best. Who knows... what may truly be out there somewhere.

0618918248|1.0|The God Delusion is an amazingly shallow work performed by one who is: \\"Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth\\" as such men are prophesied to be in these days.<br /><br />But why not? Historical Christianity, along with every other man-made or corrupted church is not much for an intellectual mind to grasp and is equally shallow. One thing, however is sure: \\"...the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God; for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.\\"<br /><br />God apparently knows us well and respects his gift of free will to us above his own sadness caused by our willing disbelief in him. Begging the kind reader's indulgence, two pertinent poems by Carol Lynn Pearson come to mind:<br /><br />The Measure<br /><br />Friend,<br />Do you measure land<br />With a barometer?<br />The law of gravity<br />By testing<br />The freezing point of mud<br />At its greatest density?<br /><br />There is no God<br />By knowledge's rules?<br />Friend,<br />Examine your tools.<br /><br />To discover God<br />You must form your plan<br />To the nature<br />Of God Himself,<br />Not the nature of man.<br />The only key<br />Is that forgotten faculty<br />That pulses through you<br />Now and then,<br />Eluding the hand<br />And startling the mind.<br />Spirit, it's called.<br /><br />Friend,<br />You will not find<br />God though mistaken tools.<br />Who weighs a stone<br />With a measuring tape?<br />Fools.<br /><br />And,<br /><br />To An Atheist<br /><br />God must have a huge sense of humor<br />So righteously to resist<br />The temptation of turning the tables<br />On your pretending He does not exist.<br /><br />To think that the world's man-made or corrupted religions teach all correct principles, I agree, is intellectual folly. In this day, after a long spiritual darkness, the only solution was a restoration of the truth which was corrupted. That truth has been so restored and it is as much science as religion and contains deep and satisfying intellectual meat as well as spiritual fulfillment. If you seek it, you will find it but it will never be forced upon you.<br /><br />J.M. Georgeeorge

It wasn't meant to be an expose, he wrote it for all of those who are/were a part of this lifestyle, and so many others who weren't still loved it anyways.  I actually prefer his writing to his show \\"No Reservations\\" for the simple fact that he gets to say exactly what he thinks without any censoring.

B000HWXS2S|5.0|Amon Amarth sure took a different approach when the time came to write their newest album. It was a much more serious approach, as if the band finally decided to come together, concentrate, and gather ideas to make sure they got the exact sound they wanted. They decided to use a producer for the first time ever (the respectable and experienced Jens Bogren) instead of just an engineer, and the band members also quit their day jobs in order to devote all their energy to the new album's songwriting and take their time when recording it. So did all of this hard work pay off? Oh, yeah! \\"With Oden On Our Side\\" is, without a doubt, Amon Amarth `s heaviest and most focused, refined, intense, inspired, epic, and all-around strongest effort to date. This is the release that Amon Amarth have been trying to put out ever since they first started making music well over a decade ago. Indeed, it is definitely safe to say that this Swedish fivesome have officially achieved true greatness.<br /><br />\\"With Oden On Our Side\\" is filled with all the usual Amon Amarth goodies: superb melodic solos, tasty harmonic leads, and gruff yet intelligible vocals. Great riffs, too. The guitarists never lose sight of the groove, and they create a virtual symphony of guitar licks (melodic, slow and heavy, fast and aggressive, and some that border on brutal) which are utilized for maximum variety. Yes, they might be fairly simplistic, but they are superbly strong and meaty, and they build off each other and flow together really well. The album's main focus, though, is on good, mature, and powerful songwriting. The result is nine well-crafted, instantly memorable songs that are epic without being overly long, and always include plenty of irresistable hooks (which are frequently among the best you will hear in death metal), dynamics, texture, atmosphere, unexpected twists, tempo variation, and fairly intelligent, war-themed lyrics.<br /><br />Frontman Johan Hegg's trademark growls do battle against strong, memorable, churning riffs and interlocking double bass thumps to create \\"Valhall Awaits Me,\\" a very rhythmic and headbangable album opener, and one that should a concert favorite in the near future. \\"Runes To My Memory\\" works similarly, with hefty, powerful riffing and a stomping drum beat, and gradually gains quite a bit of speed and momentum. This song is different, though, because it also features well-placed guitar harmonies, effortlessly contagious, melodic choruses, and memorable lyrics. Later on, \\"Gods of War Arise\\" and the title track are two classic-sounding Amon Amarth tunes, as is the catchy battlefield march-vibe of the set closer, \\"Prediction of Warfare.\\"<br /><br />The remainder of the songs, however, find the band stepping out of the box a little, and being a little experimental. For example, on \\"Asator\\" and \\"Cry of the Black Birds,\\" the Swedish quintet lets it rip with surprisingly thrashy tempos and blistering leads (and, in the case of the latter, pounding, almost blast beat-esque drumming, too.) Elsewhere, \\"Hermod's Ride to Hell: Loke's Treachery Part 1\\" is a slowly building, epic hymn with a very dark, restrained and ominous mood.  It's bolstered by chunky, mid-tempo, galloping, and sometimes booming power chords and slow, insidious, spoken word-ish vocals. The song lightens up some, though, because a wealth of wonderful melodic licks are sprinkled into the mix. Finally, track eight, \\"Under the Northern Star,\\" is equally as mellow, and just might be the most melodic song this band has ever recorded. It's highlighted by a gorgeous, soaring solo, chilling lyrics, and deliciously clean guitar leads that carry the song and might very well stick in the listener's head for days to come.<br /><br />It is fairly hard to put one's finger on exactly what category \\"With Oden On Our Side\\" falls under for sure. It is primarily a melodic death metal album, but it could sure be argued that it falls more in line with Viking, epic, folk, and/or traditional death metal. And it also has undeniable traces of black, speed, gothic, and doom metal. But it really doesn't matter what genre you choose to say it is, just as long as you don't call it anything besides an excellent record, and Amon Amarth's masterwork. In short: all killer, no filler.niable traces of black, speed, gothic, and doom metal.

B00006L7XQ|5.0|'When the Man Comes Around' is the triumphant culmination of everything Cash exemplified in a life that revolved around living under the umbrella of grace. His songs here reflect that he was very much in touch with the idea that we are all frail, broken creatures, but that God is ever present. This is never more present than in his collaboration with Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails on the song 'Hurt', a song that had different meanings for both the artists.<br /><br />To Cash, 'Hurt' reflected a life spent mostly in fighting the demons of his past while living within a myriad of current loss and disappointment. The last lines to the song, \\"If I could start again, a million miles away, I would keep myself, I would find a way.\\"<br /><br />The video that corresponds to the song tells the full story, that Cash felt with another chance to live, he would live more wisely and make different decisions, but that it is too late now. Camera shots of Jesus being murdered and his late wife June reflect a man who feels his failures have not only pained himself, but his wife and God as well. An empty, derelict Cash museum which reads \\"Closed to the public\\" only heightens the way Cash views his past achievements.<br /><br />The rest of album resounds of everything Cash was. From the mornful tone of 'Streets of Laredo' to the flamboyant nature of 'Sam Hall', Cash shows us why he was not just a great lover of life, but a genius of bringing to life songs that would otherwise rot to death on the shelves of the American past.<br /><br />The opening track also speaks of the idea that Cash was very much still a man of hope and faith. 'When the Man Comes Around' features a forewarning on the immnent return of Christ. Cash's inclusion of his favorite verse in the thanks area of the CD booklet also shows that Cash was firmly holding onto a faith that often times tried to allude his efforts.

B00076ZZ9I|2.0|While the audio quality is okay for a CD, I bought it for the DVD-Audio quality. Everybody's correct in saying that it's two-channel PCM, and that's why I'm disappointed. Sure, it smokes next to other CDs, but it's just flat when you compare it to other DVD-Audio disks.     If you want good surround mixes or lots of dynamics, take a listen to any of the Talking Heads discs included in their Brick collection or to Donald Fagen's Morph the Cat. Even the Who's Tommy, which was originally recorded in the late 60s, on DVD-Audio, has much more dynamic range and detail than this disk does.    Sure, the music's good, but I was really hoping that the opening of Hell's Bells would rattle my teeth. Instead, it just rattles the cheap plastic clock I have hanging on the wall behind my system.

0679847367|5.0|This is one of my favorite graduation gifts. I use the front cover to write a personal note to the graduate and usually cry my way through. It is exciting to see someone on the cusp of their future and this book is reassuring as they go out into the big world. I give this book the highest recommendation possible.
B0013D8LOU|5.0|Going into Sweeney Todd I did not know any of the back story.  I've heard of the musical just didn't know specifics.  Being a fan of the horror genre I found Sweeney Todd to be a slasher/fanasy/musical/drama film (notice the slashes) baked with dark humor and bright red blood Argento style that is fueled by longing and revenge.  That pretty much sums it up.  I'd go as far as to say this could be in with the top slasher films because Sweeney Todd starts with the purpose of revenge and then spirals out of control to the point where no one is safe from his blade.    The story is about an honest barber, Benjamin Barker, who is wrongfully imprisoned by, Judge Turpin, because he wanted to take advantage of Barker's pretty wife.  With the help of a sailor, Barker returns to London years later eager to exact revenge on the judge who caused him the loss of his wife and daughter.    When Todd returns to his old home he is informed by Mrs. Lovett (who owns a shop below Todd's old apartment and sells the worst meat pies in all of London) that his wife was defiled, humiliated, and as a result took poison.  She also informs him that Judge Turpin adopted Todd's daughter as his own. Soon after, Lovett shows him to his blades which she kept hidden all these years for his return.  He then rises inspired not as Benjamin Barker, honest barber, but Sweeney Todd the demon barber of fleet street.    Lovett longs for Todd, Todd longs for his family, Turpin longed for Todd's wife and now daughter, Todd's daughter a captive in Turpin's house longs for freedom and ironically the sailor who helped Todd, and the sailor longs for her as well.  Oh, I almost forgot the little gin drinking boy who comes to be Lovett's helper now that her shop is thriving with a new meatier recipe; he longs for Lovett.  I think I might have carried on too long.    CGI has it's critics and can look pretty fake. Initially I felt Sweeney Todd looked unreal however my mind soon changed.  The reason I forgot about it isbecause in Tim Burton's films he isn't trying to re create anything. Burton has his own visions, then invites the viewer in, where we soon get caught up in the world he's created.      This was one of Burton's best and one of the best to come out of 2007.  Johnny Depp was great as was the supporting cast:  Alan Rickman (Judge Turpin), Timothy Spall (Beatle Bumford), Sacha Baron Cohen (Signor Adolfo Pirelli); however it is  Helen Bonham Carter who steals the show here with her portrayal of Mrs. Lovett.

B0013K6WLM|3.0|I have to agree with another review that gave Attack and Release 3 stars.    As much as I loathe to give the Black Keys a 3 star review as they are without question one of the greatest bands to emerge in the last 10 years (in my humble opinion) but this album just falls short in so many ways. Being renowned for their gritty and raw style with shredding guitars and insanely loud drumming the Black Keys exude all the potency of a full orchestra and they are just 2 lone guys. However this latest outing sees them team up with Danger Mouse, bringing new and unexpected sounds to the \\"keys\\". I also do not blame the boys for this but feel as though everything that made the Black Keys great has been lost with the annoying inclusion of 'Gnarles Berkley-esque clapping, strained and sometimes over synth-d vocals and small bleeps and bobs from the man who did such a great job with MF Doom and others. Here though his talents are truely misplaced and his production style reduces the 'Keys' album to an annoyingly missarranged muddle of mediocrity, where dummed down vocals and over compensated drums with not enough guitar make them sound weak and more middle of the road than edge of the cliff.    Ive been with the 'Keys' since the beginning, also and saw them this past summer live and Lollapalooza, they totally rocked! S

Great story, interesting sets, low budget and and ending that only Fulci would bring us!  Highly recommended for someone who wants something fresh from horror!
1844137872|5.0|If you know Banksy, you know everything he has ever done is worth 5 stars.  But in case you are concerned about their presentation, this book goes far to present his work with beautiful imagery and insightful commentary from the Banksy, itself!!<br /><br />If you do not know Banksy yet and you enjoy stencil, symbolism, absurdism, political art, graffiti or taking risks to prove a point- just buy this book, you will not regret it!

B00103584Y|4.0|While the film is excellent and a worthwhile addition to nearly any library, I find it somewhat problematic that this release does not include subtitles in German. Seeing as those preparing this disk saw fit to include a wide array of subtitle options and spoken languages, it would seem natural to include subtitles for the language that the folks on screen are speaking. This is not a problem specific to this release, as the DVD version did the same thing, as do other German releases such as the excellent \\"The Lives of Others\\" DVD.    All other aspects of this release are pretty spiffy, as the picture and sound quality is excellent, and the special features are interesting.    This disk is surely worth picking up for cinema fans.
B000001FTA|4.0|Thin Lizzy's 1977 release, Bad Reputation, is another strong album from the underrated Irish band. Phil Lynott's continued growth as a songwriter is apparent throughout and the band continue to further their horizons musically. The album is best known for the wicked title track (certainly one of their heaviest songs) and a juicy slice of R&B called \\"Dancing in the Moonlight.\\" One of the band's best tracks, \\"Dancing...\\" works on every level from Phil's great vocals and his funky bass line to the snappy horn lines and its catchy chorus. Like their previous album (Johnny the Fox), Bad Reputation works best on the more melodic tracks as \\"Southbound\\"  and \\"That Woman's Gonna Break Your Heart\\" are great songs led by the band's dual guitar sound while the mellower  \\"Downtown Sundown\\" and \\"Dear Lord\\" are just as good. As for the harder rockers, they're all very good with \\"Soldier of Fortune\\" and the title track being on the level of the best ones on Jailbreak or Johnny the Fox. All told, Bad Reputation is another strong album from Thin Lizzy and is worth checking out.
B000KGGIZU|3.0|Despite what the packaging may say, neither movie is presented in anamorphic widescreen.  The menus for each DVD are 16x9 and play fine on a widescreen tv, but both movies play in 4x3 letterboxed mode and do not fill the screen.
B00003CXA6|3.0|Well...very disapointed..i am quite a fan of this era, and was expecting a much better delivered film.    I guess i was more interested with the family connection, more than anything, but was disapointed with the film.  3/5 for me.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|This series does the war of the century a great deal of justice.  I purchased it about 4 months ago and have watched every episode at least twice.  The European side of the war gets a bit more coverage, but the episodes on the War of the Pacific are superb, particularly the one that documents the battles of Tarawa, Iwo Jima, Leyte Gulf and Okinawa (on disk 6).  The series is also effective in showing how the civilian population was affected in various countries.  You will probably gain a great deal of respect and sympathy for the Russian people after watching the episodes on Leningrad and Stalingrad.
0760316414|3.0|Yes quite an interesting book......sadly its not quite as easy as the book says, but interesting non the less.    If you want to realy know how to design cars,go to the Royal College of Art...or Coventry Poly.
B000WQWPKA|5.0|I am, and always will be, a fan of this old movie.  I know that it is all pretty far fetched, but none the less, a great movie, back when I saw it when it first came out, but even better now that it is in HD.  As far as the HD video is concerned, it has a wonderful video, as well as a pretty awesome, audio.  I would recommend this HD video to anyone in a heartbeat.
0385334206|5.0|I bought this book accidentally, confusing it with another my daughter wanted to give her boyfriend as a present. He is the Vonnegut fan.    Adding to my scarse salary in a third world country, another extra 23.00 u$s on my credit card made my breakfast anything BUT a breakfast of champions.  I would return it, but shipping costs might be as expensive, to me, as buying a new book.
B000P0J09M|4.0|Goodfellas is one of the best of its genre.  Based on facts, it is violent and graphic, with excellent acting throughout.  At times, the storyline becomes muddled with too many characters, but it's still entertaining.  Definitely NOT for children; the language is excessively (and unnecessarily) obscene.
B0011ZNAIC|4.0|That was the question I had.  I  belong to blockbuster just so I can rent movies and save money.  I am a real movie freak and I used to buy every movie that came out.  Now I rent them and then if I like them I would buy.  I thought the movie was OK but my 14 year old son  loved it.  It did have alot of humor in it.  The more I thought about it the more things I liked about it.  Although I thought the ending was alittle weak.  But all in all a good movie to add to my dvd collection.  Well worth watching!

0321544080|5.0|This is a wonderful book full of great photos and lots of smart advice. The best part is that you don't have to read it in a linear fashion. Just pick a page, study the photo and start reading. I polished off the book that way in less than a week, but find myself going back again and again. As an added bonus, Joe McNally has a wonderful sense of humor.
0143038419|5.0|One of the best books I've read.  The experiences were real and I felt myself living in them. Great insight with detail description of location, feelings and love.  We all live the same dreams. Great realization.
B000TM1CKQ|5.0|Season 2 of this hilarious show is even funnier than the first.  It seems that the cast overall are having an absolute blast doing this show.  You can feel everytime you watch an episode (actually several) because i can never watch just one episode and leave it at that. All the cast bring something to the show.  Whether it's the jokes at the right time or just being there for each other in times of crisis.  This show represents what it's like to have people (friends) in your life that look out for and have each other back regardless of what stupid thing you might have done or said.  Its an excellent second season to a show that out to be on anyone's radar that's into comedy.<br /><br />With excellent actors/actresses, well written scripts and just an incredible energy throughout each episode.  How I Met Your Mother is something that all should watch.  It makes me feel good that there are shows out there that bring it each and every episode.<br /><br />Can't wait until Season 3 of this comes out on DVD.  I'll be there with a quickness snatching this one.<br /><br />Enjoy.
0380789027|5.0|While I had been aware of Gaiman for years, I hadn't had the opportunity to pick up one of his books.  This book was my first experience with him, and I must say I am quite impressed.    Gaiman has a gift for making the fantastic and unimaginable seem to be part of the everyday and mundane.  No, this isn't a bad thing.  He seamlessly blends his world to ours and the result is a fantastic set of short stories that leave me wanting more.  I cannot stress my enjoyment of this book enough.  This book has become one of my most treasured possessions and I recommend it to all of my friends.

B00092ZL80|5.0|1.  At first glance, one may think this an odd pairing:  Earth Wind and Fire + Chicago.  I initially wondered, \\"how does that work?\\"<br /><br />2.  The bottomline--> one of the best concert DVDs I've viewed thus far.  The sound is excellent, the energy of the performances is excellent, and uniqueness of the event (ie seeing EWF and Chicago jam together)  is worth price of the DVD.<br /><br />3.  For Chicago fans who don't have any other Chicago DVDs, get this one.  This surpasses the A & E and Soundstage DVD on many measures.  For EWF fans, there are some other good DVDs to choose from and Maurice White isn't on this DVD, but nonetheless--> an excellent DVD to add to the collection.<br /><br />4.  What this DVD illustrates, is that no matter what the genre, there is nothing like seeing great music being performed by great musicians.
B000W4HJ44|5.0|JUST A GREAT GET UP AND DANCE AND SING MOVIE. Literally for the whole family.
0446310786|5.0|This truly is the most beautiful, profound,brilliant, redolent with meaning book i have ever read. Harper Lee's candid statement that, i quote, said\\" i intended this to be a simple love story\\" amuses me . it is so much more, exemplifying racial inequities, preconcieved notions and their detrimental effects on society, A keen love with the disabled, and so much more. This novel is what stimulated me to read every possible erudite literary work in existence. lee's cadence resonates throughout every page of the book. a must read.

B00006J9OV|5.0|As I watched Parsifal I felt grateful to belong to a society which can produce such a performance.<br /><br />There will always be differences of opinion regarding musical interpretation, stage production, selection of cast, etc., but the number of dedicated (yes, it's still a good word) people involved and the enormous amount of time and resources is stunning to contemplate.<br /><br />I enjoyed my first viewing/listening and expect to treasure this DVD for a long time. I am quite familiar with the opera, having played it many times (violinist), but seeing it from out front is a completely new experience. Generally it is understood that Wagner was a bit long-winded, and some more judicious cuts could improve the performance. I always thought it was kind of Wagner to write the string parts in the manner he wrote them in the Flower Girl Scene. There are just enough rests that the first violins can quickly turn their heads a see what is happening on stage, and our first violin section did just that in dress rehearsals (we were allowed). The sight was always rewarding, but it is even more so from out front!<br /><br />Every person who doesn't own this DVD should buy it immediately and watch it/listen to it. It will improve your attitude, I promise.

B000002WPI|4.0|If you think back, the years leading up all the way through the middle of 1993 had been dominated by the West Coast, and rightfully so.     You had one of the best beatmakers on either coast in Dr. Dre, produce an outright classic of an album (The Chronic). His protege (and probably the world's best known rap artist), Snoop Doggy Dogg goes on and produces another classic LP in \\" Doggystyle\\". Add to that mix urban film classics such as \\" Boyz N Da Hood\\" and \\"Menace To Society\\", and the West Coast owned the scene until...Wu-Tang Clan drops \\"Enter The Wu-Tang\\".    Now it must be said, \\"Enter\\" is far from a perfect album. As a matter of fact, I heard more miscues on this album then any album I could ever remember. For example, listen to the beginning of C.R.E.A.M. as Raekwon tries to initiate the song w/o the beat. They make up for this with raw energy, action packed rhymes, and innovative production.    That raw energy can be found early and often in songs like \\" Bring Da Ruckus\\" and \\" Shame On A N!&&@\\". Now, this album has an early intermission, but with that comes the classic \\"Can It All Be So Simple\\". This is one of those joints you just sit back to with a drink and just think about yesteryear.     The next two tracks do a great job of setting the stage for one of the best acronyms in the English speaking world with \\"C.R.E.A.M.\\". I mean, the song is perfect, from the lyrics to the hook, and don't get me started on the staggering piano loop. RZA's beats on this album are some of the genre's best.    Personally, I would rather have seen the album end with \\" Protect Ya Neck\\" instead of a weak song like \\" Part Two\\", but that's me being picky.    All in all, this is a good album that sets the stage for classic LP's such a Liquid Swords and Only Built 4 Cuban Linx. Cop it and see the progression I speak of.
B00003CXBK|5.0|Princess Mononoke is a must have for any die hard anime collector.  This movie presents a moral based storyline with action that makes for a great movie.  Out of all of Hisaya Monshige movies, this would have to be one of the best anime's ever made.
B00000294R|3.0|Whenever I listen to this album, I am particularly annoyed by the fact that I feel as though this album could have been every bit as good as Illmatic, except for the fact that the production was subpar.    Don't get me wrong, Lord Finesse and Buckwild were skilled beatmakers, but by time this album came out, their skills had began to wane a bit. On the other hand, Illmatic boasted production by the likes of Pete Rock, Large Professor, and most importantly, DJ Premier.     Some of Nas' best work was done over Premo beats (NY State of Mind, Represent and I Gave You Power just to name a few). I can't help but think of what this album could have been had these two masters met sooner (they did hook up eventually), especially when you hear Melachi lay waste to a perfect beat on \\"Words From The Nutcracker\\".    All in all, this is a solid album laced with a few gems (\\"All Black\\" comes to mind, immediately!), but had Big L been affiliated with a producer of like talent, like Nas was with Premo, our ears would have been blessed with a second timeless classic.
B000GW8VTO|1.0|The movie is great, but the HD copy has no better resolution than the DVD.  I played them one after another on the same scene and there was no deference between the two.  Basically, you pay for high definition and get a DVD. Disappointing.

0446310786|4.0|To Kill a Mocking Bird     Being recognized as one of the greatest pieces of American literature in the twentieth century, stating To Kill a Mocking Bird is fantastic, should go without saying. I recommend whoever is considering reading this doesn't try to figure everything they can about the book before they do so. It's better to into on a clean slate. Some references and lifestyles may be shocking but one must remember where, and when it takes place. Reading novels from today's biggest names in literature, its clear many are influenced by Harper Lee. Lacking clear violence, true love, and other huge themes seen in books and movie now a days, some may say its boring but reading thoroughly, one can see the painful conflict and romance in its pages. In summary, this piece may in some ways be offensive, but it reflects history, unjust prosecution, and the truth of the world.
B000SJJCX4|1.0|I bought this item thinking it was a great deal, but when i got it, the pedal crapped out within the first 30 seconds after the battery was placed in. I noticed a burnt wire smell and when i tried to tune my instrument i noticed that the led lights were not responding and that the smell was coming from the tuner. In summary it was a very bad purchase.

This mini-series takes such wonderful turns and twists, it keeps you drawn in to the very, final kiss.

Happiness indeed!!!

B000E41MRC|5.0|Before her death in 2003 at the age of 101, filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl would have you believe she had no affiliation with the Nazi party when she was asked by Adolf Hitler to document the momentous four days leading to the 1934 Nuremberg rally. However, it's obvious from her concurrently celebrated and reviled 1935 propaganda film that she was mesmerized by Hitler's oratorical skills judging from the dynamic way she has captured his undeniable charisma. She shows a remarkable deftness in editing techniques and camera movement and placement that remains the gold standard among documentarians. Riefenstahl succeeds in making Hitler a larger than life figure to the masses without resorting to editorial commentary to validate what is obvious from the images.<br /><br />The film begins with Hitler's arrival in Nuremberg by personal aircraft where he is greeted by enthusiastic throngs of Nazi supporters. In fact, the first third of the film focuses primarily on civilian support of Fuehrer and then transitions to the opening of the Reich Party Congress where we see familiar historical figures, such as Rudolf Hess and Joseph Goebbels, speak. This leads to the third day of activity with rather unsettling shots of Hitler Youth as they prepare to greet Hitler from the rows of teepees in which they have camped. Her discriminating use of close-ups is most striking here when we see tow-headed Aryan boys hypnotized by Hitler's speech. The film ends with the startlingly choreographed rally with the famous shot of Hitler, flanked by Heinrich Himmler and Viktor Lutze, walking down an emptied aisle to place a wreath at a WWI memorial (a shot replicated by George Lucas at the end of the first [[ASIN:B000FQJAIW Star Wars]]). The climax is designed to be celebratory as Hitler leads the masses toward unity under the Reich with his fanatical delivery.<br /><br />Like D.W. Griffiths' [[ASIN:6305130949 The Birth of a Nation]], it is difficult to defend the intended messaging behind such a trenchant film, yet it is criminal not to recognize the powerfully cinematic sense with which Riefenstahl imbues her work. The 2006 Special Edition Synapse DVD contains a good though not outstanding print transfer. However, there are two worthwhile extras - the extremely informative commentary track from historian Dr. Anthony R. Santoro (which I recommend you switch on immediately to fully appreciate the individual personalities and historical details behind the rally) and a short Riefenstahl made at the following year's rally to celebrate the Wehrmacht (the German army), \\"Day of Freedom\\". There is little use in attempting any sort of objectivity about this film as it was intended to evoke strong emotions with the sole goal of solidifying the Reich in a country still feeling weakened from WWI. In this respect, Riefenstahl succeeds admirably.et it is criminal not to recognize the powerfully cinematic sense with which Riefenstahl imbues her work.

B0013K6WLM|4.0|This album is a new direction for the Black Keys adding many more layers to their sound. Some people are saying its a little odd with the sounds, but I think it almost sounds psychedelic which I think fits well with their sound.   I would have given this album 5 stars because its still a great album from one of the best bands out there but Remember When Side A, is a TERRIBLE song.  I'm sorry its a stinker and it brings the entire album down especially cause its RIGHT smack dab in the middle of the album.  I think  their next album should be more back to their DIY roots, but definitely keep some of the new sounds especially the organ and even the flutes (jethro tull anyone?)
B00011F5DK|5.0|This game is super fun and REALLY easy to learn.  My son who has a hard time following game rules picked it up within minutes.  Great for ALL ages.  There is something very therapeutic about playing this game.  We LOVE it!    Also great for little kids who can't really follow the game rules.  They can just make designs with the tiles.  It's just as fun!    NOTE:  Be careful not to lose the pieces.  They are very small and easy to miss.  Try counting them before putting them back in the box.
1582701709|5.0|Many have criticized \\"The Secret\\" for being the marketing dynamo that it is, both the movie and the book.  Yet how else can we change the world if the simple message that our beliefs and feelings create the reality we experience is kept as an underground, non-traditional outlook? The world needs to wake up and it needs to wake up fast.  \\"The Secret\\" has been able to reach mainstream thinkers from many walks of life who otherwise may never have been exposed to the ideas it contains, at least not anytime soon. I see this wave of \\"new thought\\" sweeping the planet and I want to cheer it on.<br /><br />I've known about this so-called \\"secret\\" for a long time. What I like about the book is that it will no longer be a secret.  Not that it ever was. It's just that the status quo tended to squash this kind of self-empowered thinking wherever it popped up in the past, so those who believed it were forced to keep quiet and form secret alliances.  The wisdom of the secret is threatening to those who wield power over others and don't want to lose it. Their day is coming to an end, thanks in part to the social internet, but also due to the rising popularity of self-empowered thought.<br /><br />This book is somewhat like a divination oracle.  Due to the well-spaced lay-out and inserted quotes, you don't necessarily have to sit down and read it. You can just open it to any page and find something useful to ponder.  I find that usually the page opens to something that is relevantly meaningful for me at that particular time.<br /><br />Aside from the content, the book itself is attractive and artistically designed, with pages that resemble old parchment in color and design, but with a smooth-finish texture. The hardcover and dustjacket carry this theme out, including the red wax \\"seal\\" that is embossed on the front cover and book title. Its small size makes it appear even more \\"precious\\", not to be mistaken for some boring text that must be waded through with concentrated effort, but rather a handy reference that can easily be toted wherever one might wish to go.<br /><br />I enjoy this book for its beauty and reminders, although for me, the content was not new or secret. I recommend it particularly for seekers of greater happiness who may be just beginning to explore the possibilites that exist with an expanded consciousness.rence that can easily be toted wherever one might wish to go.

B00005OM4K|5.0|Some reviews made me hesitate to buy this, but once I did and gave it a listen nothing else mattered. This is great rock 'n' roll and it's fascinating to hear John Fogerty and the Band develop. When they hit \\"I Put A Spell On You,\\" track 2/CD 2, it's there, the Creedence \\"spook.\\" Sure this is a Screamin' Jay Hawkins song, but you can hear, right at that moment, a band that has found itself, and there's no looking back. What follows is track after track of tight, focused rock, with the occasional extended groove. The sound of these CDs is fine, and besides, hi fi CCR seems pointless. John Fogerty once said that when he had a demo of a song, he'd take the tape out for a spin in his car to see how it sounded. And you know what, it sounded great, and still does! This is working class, rough edged, roots music; sometimes political (these songs still hold up), sometimes celebrating the joys of childhood and street music, sometimes casting that eerie Creedence spell. \\"Hope you have got your thing together / Hope you are quite prepared to die / Looks like we're in for nasty weather / One eye is taken for an eye.\\" As Dylan confirmed in 2001, \\"it's rough out there, high water everywhere.\\" Indeed. Good stuff, can't go wrong, better than I remembered, and it's all here in this nicely priced set.
1604590483|5.0|This book, originally published in 1963, was way ahead of its time. The author has provided numerous examples demonstrating the power of the subconscious mind, particularly with regard to the use of auto-suggestion. Today, the trend toward a metaphysical spirituality that includes quantum physics simply confirms the wisdom Dr. Murphy has already laid out for us in his insightful book.<br /><br />These days many have come to the conclusion that the subconscious is an enemy to be defeated, simply because they do not know how to access it to create the changes they want. Dr. Murphy clearly shows how the subconscious is our greatest ally, and needs only to be re-educated in order to deliver the kinds of experiences we want.<br /><br />Subjects covered include the lifeward tendency of the subconscious mind, the use of imagination instead of willpower, prayer as a scientifically directed function of the conscious and subconscious mind and why affirmations fail, to name a few. The author describes techniques for enhancing marital harmony, improving all relationships, better sleep, enhancing prosperity and wealth, as well as finding forgiveness and greater happiness.<br /><br />There is a good reason why the International Medical and Dental Hypnotherapy Association has this book on its required reading list for certification. There are few other books that so clearly and in so much detail educate the reader about the mysterious and profound wonder that is the subconscious mind.
B000B8QG0O|5.0|This movie is a lifesaver for us. Our 3yr old loves to watch it, and it gives us a few minutes to ourselves.  It took a few days to come, and it was quick and easy to order. price was right also.
0452289963|5.0|This is a wonderful, life changing book.  It well written and easy to understand.
0446693804|3.0|It seemed to be a little imature of a book for an adult to read. However the story was nice.
B000A7DVRC|5.0|Every baby boomer knows these characters: The stoner, the twisted vet, the insecure follower, and the spoiled rich playing games.  This movie is like a long flashback with a great plot, with Bridges as a pot smoking Columbo with beach clothes instead of a rain coat.  Highly recommend.
B0011ZNAIC|3.0|A fun and farcical tale, this movie was enjoyable.  Jerry Seinfeld plays a bee torn by angst over his looming--and supposedly permanent--job choice.  This choice ultimately leads to unforeseen consequences way beyond the scope of his natural life's plan.  Jerry's performance is quite funny, although a bit much for the intended younger audience.  Most of the double entendres should fly over the youngsters' heads--hopefully, anyway.  Renee Zellweger also turns in a cute performance.<br /><br />This movie strikes one cautionary note in that even if you think you are in the right, disaster can come from upsetting the natural order of things.<br /><br />What I found to be consistently annoying were the departures from reality with regard to the natural history of bees.  Now, I'm not referring to the fact that insects talk in the movie.  Nobody's going to be fooled by that.  However, those who know little about natural science and especially small children might come away with a few misconceptions.<br /><br />Those with biology degrees or even those who just enjoy natural history may \\"bee\\" irked by the flaws in bee biology.  (I apologize for the pun--had to do it!)  For example, all workers in the hive are female.  Also, except for queens and drones, bees don't do just one job their whole lives.  Workers change jobs as they mature.<br /><br />However, the very heart of the movie's plot depends on these fallacies, so perhaps they can be forgiven as poetic license.  Just don't think you've learned anything about the real life of bees from this movie.<br /><br />This is an overall humorous movie with very little in the way of offensive material.  It is pretty good family entertainment, and likely worth an hour or two of your time.
6305692572|5.0|I loved this movie!  Andy Garcia and Meg Ryan were very good in this movie.  Meg plays an alcoholic mother and Andy is her husband attempting to keep the family together during her rehab process.  I thought the acting was very good, and the story line was captivating.  Very enjoyable, but also will pull on your heartstrings.
1878424319|1.0|The book is well criticized in many of the 1-star reviews so I won't repeat the valid points made there but just add to the numbers.    I am shocked that I actually bought this book - but there it is in my order history, bought from Amazon in late 2004. My age at the time (28 :-) ) does not justify this choice and I can only hope that it was a \\"people who bought this also bought\\" inspiration after putting Csikszentmihalyi's \\"Flow\\" into my cart.    On the upside, I don't have any friends or relatives to think less of for giving it to me as a gift. And this teaches me to never ever trust the average ratings on Amazon again but always to check for very low ratings.
B000MCH5P4|2.0|This is without a doubt the most depressing movie I have ever seen. The main theme of this movie? Tragedy, Despair, Hopelessness. Movies nowadays come out with no theme and no general message, just a bunch of high priced actors doing what they do best with average dialogue in unique settings. However, an audience of humans, yes humans, takes what they see on the big screen and try to make sense of it. Our natural ability as humans is to try and make things better for ourselves and for our families. We look for positivity in every day life and sometimes come to the movies to escape every day reality and to dream and to look for hope and for overall solace. Well, you won't find that here with Babel. While the acting for the roles is quite superb, case in point the scenes in Japan by the Japanese actors, the overall story is the most depressing I've ever seen on big screen. If it wasn't for the Japan scenes, this movie would've been a big failure to me.  Go figure, I honestly thought the best performance was done by the deaf-mute Japanese girl.  The only thing that saved it was the fact that at the end of Babel's story, there was hope between the Japanese girl and her father.  But what about mom and dad in Morocco?  What about the kids?  What about the Mexican nanny?  The rest of Babel's 4 stories are just a mess of tragedy and despair. Unless you're a viewer with similar experiences, it is a comforting thought that you are not alone, but I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone with a general overall positive outlook on life that seeks redemption after every imaginable struggle.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|All I can say is it was worth the long wait!  I think I watched it twice within the first 3 days of owning it and have since watched all the featurettes.  A wonderful film tying down one of the major story threads - the Ori.  A must for any SG-1 fan.  I understand there's one more on the way, and if there's anything to complain about is it left me wanting more.  Why did Sci-fi have to cancel the series?  Silly people.
B000JLTRIG|5.0|i love the shows.i am very hooked on the show,i watch every episode  it was a great buy,i will continue to purchase more  charmed episodes and products.
B0011TQLA2|5.0|I've been a long time fan of Radiohead.  To this day The Bends destroys most \\"alternative rock\\" albums being made.  OK Computer is a masterpiece, after countless times listening to it it still sounds fresh and interesting.  Kid A and Amnesiac, while interesting at first haven't aged quite as well, mostly because they lacked honest to god songs (although HTDC is one of my favorites).  They're more like tone poems.  Hail to the Thief had some great songs but it was scattershot and all over the place.  So it's been since OK Computer that I felt that Radiohead made an album that had both great songs and a great cohesive package of mood and tonality.  In that sense In Rainbows is a triumphant return to excellence.  9 of the ten songs on here are fantastic (Sorry House of Cards, you're pretty boring) and Radiohead has finally mastered mixing the organic sounds of the entire band with the electronic sounds of Thom and Nigel (their producer).  Phil sounds better and more precise than any drum machines and Ed and Johnny get to dust off their guitars and play, although I was a little disappointed that I didn't get to hear Johnny going apes&^t on his guitar.  Colin continues to be a main driving force in the songs with his slick, rolling bass lines looping in and out of the songs.          This is not an earth-shattering, ground breaking album like OK COmputer and Kid A were.  Those albums were paradigm-shifts in the sound of Radiohead and the sound of alternative rock in general.  While Radiohead is just one of many influences modern bands have, there's no denying an overall shift in the style of many bands towards adopting a more electronic sound.  Instead, this album is more of a refinement.  Taking their previous sounds and shaping them into something new and exciting and at the same time organic and satisfying.  It's a welcome return to Radiohead the band that writes beautiful songs rather than the Radiohead that writes beautiful noise.
B0013FDM7E|2.0|Since the mid 90s Hollywood has really been in a rut; everything has to be bigger and louder and basic storytelling has gone out the window. But I'm not gonna totally knock Hollywood they do sometimes get it right. It's just they don't produce the movies they once did. I hoped I Am Legend would be one of the few that worked well, but when all was said and done Hollywood dropped the ball again. I Am Legend had potential to be a really chilling movie, but it never reaches that level.<br /><br />First up I have to mention Will Smith who plays Robert Neville; it's pretty much a one man show and more than half the movie is just Will Smith and his dog. I'll give major credit to Smith who really does a great job at carrying the movie. In general the movies Will Smith does really don't appeal to me, but he is a fantastic actor and does one hell of a job here.<br /><br />I Am Legend is based off the Richard Matheson novel and the screenplay was written by Mark Protosevich & Akiva Goldsman and it's never really interesting. It's not easy to write a screenplay and even harder when you have pretty much one character through a majority of the movie. The concept of the movie is excellent, but their screenplay just doesn't really work. It's not terrible by any means, just isn't all that good. But with the right director it could have possibly worked.<br /><br />Francis Lawrence steps into the director's chair and fails at brining any tension or adventure. The pacing often lacks and he never really gets much going and the action scenes come out weak. Seeing the deserted Manhattan streets is sort creepy as a New Yorker and seeing that makes for a semi chilling moment, but is never as creepy as it could have been. But after a while those shots become tiresome. I never felt that whole end of the world vibe; one of the most chilling scenes in recent memory was the deserted London streets in 28 Days Later, but here with I Am Legend you never get that chilling vibe.<br /><br />The screenplay was flawed, but with the right director I think the movie could have worked. I just never felt any tension, the deserted Manhattan streets are never as chilling as it should have been and the action scenes fail at brining much excitement. The ending was very anti-climatic. What could have been a powerful scene feels rushed and just falls flat.<br /><br />The biggest downfall of the movie is the CGI; first off I really don't like CGI, but depending on the movie I can tolerate it. With a 150-million dollar budget one would think the F/X would come out good, but nope it's terrible and really brings the movie down. I've seen movies done on a much lower budget that ranges from 2-5-million with CGI and it looks on par with this. I've seen movies done under a million that have far better F/X. With the budget I Am Legend had there is no excuse for such shoddy F/X.<br /><br />I Am Legend is just too Hollywood stylized; in some ways it's better than a lot of what's out there. While this does have action scenes it's not done as much as I thought it would be. I expected mindless action scene over and over again and it wasn't. So that's a good thing, but action or not it's too stylized. A movie like this needs more of a gritty look. Again there was potential here, but when all is said and done I Am Legend just lacks in tension and excitement.<br /><br />If you are into big time Hollywood productions odds are I Am Legend will get the job done and you'll enjoy the movie, but for the rest of us we'll mostly be bored. I haven't seen The Omega Man, which is based off the Matheson novel and I Am Legend follows that movie, but I have seen The Last Man on Earth, which is also based off the Matheson novel. My opinion skip this one and check out The Last Man on Earth, while flawed it's far better than this. But again for those who enjoy Hollywood productions you'll probably like this, but the rest will be bored at another Hollywood mishap.ght director I think the movie could have worked.

B000J103WK|1.0|This product is not worth the plastic it is printed on. I have tried this on 3 DVD players, including a NEW 5 disc surround system and it will not play. I feel like I was ripped off in the purchase of this product by Amazon who should WARN their customers about it requiring SPECIFIC types of players to use it on.     Give me $ 10.00 I'll send it to whomever buys it. It's not worth anything to me.
B000RIWAYY|5.0|Wow, what a great cd! The excitement is great, music is great, feelings are great. While Joe Satriani takes guitar playing to another level, we listen to this music in wonder of how he performs with such emotion felt without even hearing singing. I guess his guitar does it for him which is awesome. This is definately one of the best albums I have heard, and this remastered version is sweet! The DVD is well worth the price too. A great set for someone looking for something different and just plain old excitement. I won't bother listing single tracks cause I love all of them. Ill just list all of them.      Track List:  \\"Surfing with the Alien\\" - 4:25   \\"Ice 9\\" - 3:59   \\"Crushing Day\\" - 5:14   \\"Always with Me, Always with You\\" - 3:22   \\"Satch Boogie\\" - 3:13   \\"Hill of the Skull\\" - 1:48   \\"Circles\\" - 3:28   \\"Lords of Karma\\" - 4:48   \\"Midnight\\" - 1:42   \\"Echo\\" - 5:37
B000NA2BEU|5.0|I had never seen this Series until the Third Season.  That being said, I was glued to my set every Tuesday hoping, praying for a new episode.  The quick dialogue, quirky personalities and overall fun attitudes, even in the heart of a mystery, made and make this series so great.    Now, after this show's been cancelled, I've bought all of the Seasons and while the Third Season is a little off kilter it still is an great Season and something I can put in and watch time and time again.
0765348276|5.0|Its been many many years since I have been able to sink my teeth into a good book. A book rep in Aust said to me that I may be interested in this one and she was spot on. Great story line and well written. I read it in two days after it arrived from Amazon. Its not yet available in Australia. I have also read Ghost Brigades..a slight change of tack but another excellent book. You won't be sorry if you purchase this one..
B000FL7CAK|5.0|Who would expect such a great series out of UPN?  Great dialogue: \\"Annoy little blond one, annoy like the wind\\" still being my favorite.  And though it's a little older in themes, Veronica Mars never forgets that, yes, this is a high school show.    I also have to admit, I never watched the show on TV, I didn't get it until well after it had aired and I had the Third Season on TV.  And being, that I LOVED the Third Season, the First and Second far surpassed my expectations.    If you're looking for a good detective show, or an even better teen show, I strongly advise this whole series.

1594489505|5.0|Yet another wonderful epic that almost matches the magic of \\"The Kite Runner\\". The pages just kept turning. Hosseini's writing style is both powerful, accurate and easy readable. The story sticks to the skin but is also emotionally stressful at certain moments. Definitely a book that you should not miss.

B0010YSD7M|5.0|As a fan of SG-1 for many years, I have enjoyed the new additions to the show in recent years. Replacing Richard Dean Anderson, those are really hard shoes to follow and I think Ben Browder does a really good job. I love his humor and one liners in this movie, he pulled off the \\"hero\\" role well! Without ruining it for anyone, I can not go in to detail, but he isn't \\"perfectly fine\\" in the end, it goes with the story. (That should make you curious).    I think wrapping up the Ori, I am glad they were able to finsh the storyline, bringing back Aydria, Tomin and Morgan were great! The twist on the ship, interesting and definatly, \\"Oh My Gosh\\". Vilian with the IOA, I hated him, but that was the point!    Loved seeing a point of view from Tealc' that had not been seen before, that I remember anyway. His scene with Tomin was very powerful.    One liners were great, cast did an amazing job, as always! Can not give anything away, but there are still one or two loose ends character wise, I would like to see wrap up for the series. Looking forward to the next film. Anyone who likes SG-1, would highly recommend this film!!
B000YXMMAE|1.0|0 of 69 people will find this review helpful.  To begin, I have listened to every Radiohead album.  I would call many of them masterpieces and even indulge in the Reggae Tribute to Radiohead.  But, this CD...it's self indulgent woo is me and made me realize that Thom Yorke's style served as a template for boredom in music.  I had just purchased a new stereo and thought a modern CD would be a good way to showcase the music.  I was wrong, like that $20.00 lottery ticket that loses same concept.  This is a band that you never hear anything negative about and any album they release will be praised to the heavens.  Good for them, but after buying every Radiohead cd thus far and just selling the majority of them later on..... 5 star reviews I'm not falling for them anymore.  I think perhaps this music is so ahead of its time I just don't get it.  Upon listening the music drones and the lyrics sound like teen angst high school woe is me poetry.  Radiohead you are not taking my money anymore.  I will always listen to the Talking Heads song \\"Radiohead\\" and think wow this song inspired a band to rip me off and keep coming back for more.  Brilliant artwork, brilliant album title but there ain't no Leprachauns or Rainbows here.  No pot of gold either.  The sublimity of Radio head though is I could say its sad that people flock to each new release by positive reviews and not give other new artists a try but, thats not radioheads fault they sell the cd for any price on their website.  The purpose of this review is if you like artists like VNV Nation, Cocorosie, Antony and the Johnsons, Sparks, Pulp, Nico, Leonard Cohen, Nick Cave, Morrissey, T Rex...then go buy or try a different band.  Don't waste any of your money on Radiohead.  Go buy a $20.00 scratch off ticket instead then you might find yourself in a rainbow rather than this sewer of a CD.  Don't Buy it Now.  Don't even buy the mint used copy I have up for sale.  Save your money.
B000BUYP4Q|5.0|\\"Batman Begins\\" is an interesting movie not only because of its storyline, which adopts a more \\"real and crude\\", free of villains in disguise approach than the so-called anthology ([[ASIN:B000B5XOYI Batman: The Motion Picture Anthology 1989-1997 (Batman / Batman Returns / Batman Forever / Batman & Robin) (Two-Disc Special Editions)]]) and its state-of-the-art production (that wasn't possible in the early 90's, probably), but the story on how Bruce Wayne, driven by fear and guilty, came to be Batman.<br /><br />For those like me, who have never followed Batman through comics, the existence of such mysterious figure was always an unanswered question until this movie came out. Taking another comics-based sequel like Spider-Man ([[ASIN:B000UR9T8W Spider-Man - The Motion Picture DVD Trilogy (Spider-Man / Spider-Man 2 / Spider-Man 3)]]) one can realize that the history of a hero was told from the beginning, which is the correct approach.<br /><br />By following a logical reasoning, one can easily tell that \\"Batman Begins\\" should be the first movie of the series and it's sad that it came so late. Looking on the bright side, it was good that this movie was produced last, taking advantage of greater and better special effects available today. People who are now being introduced to the \\"Batworld\\" can make a choice and watch the \\"Fourlogy\\" starting with this one.

B0015KO52S|5.0|I am writing this review on Sunday, April 6th, 2008.  Upon first hearing the album \\"Stadium Arcadium\\" by The  Red Hot Chili Peppers, I told anyone who would listen,  that it would be nominated for Album Of The Year at  the Grammy Awards.  And it was.  If not for the voters  rewarding The Dixie Chicks for their boldness, it would  have surely been the winner.  Now it is time for my next prediction: Consolers Of The  Lonely will at least be nominated for Album Of The Year,  and probably many other Grammys.  Now, I cannot predict  what the voters will choose to reward this time, but trust  me, this Ranoteurs album is one for all time.  Yes, it's  that damn good!

The subtle and sometimes outrageous references to Star Wars and Star Trek - poor Scotty and captain Kirk might not find some of the scenes to their liking!  This is not a serious movie and it is very funny.  If you just want to sit back and have fun with Dark Helmet, Lone Star and Barf go for it!  Strap on your safety belts for ludicrous speed!

B000067FP7|5.0|\\"Gremlins\\" is a heartwarming Christmas movie that your entire family will enjoy! When I think of classic Christmas movies such as \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" and \\"Miracle on 34th Street\\" I always fondly recall \\"Gremlins.\\" Because isn't it such a great Christmas movie that all the kids will love. Afterall, \\"Gremlins\\" has snow, and decorations and Christmas music and even those cute, furry little pe(s)ts!    Seriously though, I do love \\"Gremlins\\" because it's such a great example of a totally 80's movie! Beware if you were not a child of the 80's you may find this movie dated, corny and incredibly hokum. Come to think of it, even if you were a child of the 80's you may think that as well! But it doesn't matter because \\"Gremlins\\" is all good! When this movie first came out my parents absolutely forbid my brother and I from watching it. Of course we didn't listen to them though.     \\"Gremlins\\" was such a huge sensation; telling a kid that they couldn't see it would certainly constitute cruel and usual punishment! We even had our Gizmo stuffed animals and a few other things. Keep in mind that this movie spawned an entire genre of pseudo-horror flicks (\\"Ghoulies,\\" and \\"Goonies \\" come to mind.)     \\"Gremlins\\" tells the hilarious story of what happens when you don't follow the rules and let your Mogwai run wild! Billy Peltzer (played by one-hit wonder, Zach Galligan) receives an early Christmas gift, courtesy of his father Randall (played by Hoyt Axton.) Billy is warned not to ever expose Giz to bright lights or water and never to give him food after midnight (just a side note, if the Mogwai is from Asia, how exactly would he know that it was midnight?) Suffice it to say, the little critter soon multiples, courtesy of Billy's friend Pete (a very young Corey Feldman.)     I especially enjoyed some of the special effects. It was so odd watching Gizmo as he multiplied because the others literally popped out of him. It looked so realistic. Speaking of realistic, I also enjoyed watching the Gremlins hatch from the cocoons. They looked so disgusting and evil.     There're so many lucicrisly hilarious scenes. I could not stop laughing when the Christmas tree \\"came alive\\" and started attacking Mrs. Peltzer (Frances Lee McCain.) Actually it had one of the little denomic Gremlins hiding in it! The poor thing was badly stabbed in her face before the malicious Gremlin took off to spread some more Christmas cheer!    Ruby Deagle! She was a Super (starts with a Capital-B & rhymes with) Wiiiiiiiiiiiiitch. Mrs. Deagle was sure a far cry from Polly Holliday's days as Flo, the man-hungry waitress. Actually I'm not sure which was more terrifying, the entire pack of Gremlins or Mrs. Deagle! Her voice was entirely filled with hate and her eyes looked at Billy the way a king-cobra stares at her trapped prey! She was a bitter, old woman, that hated all people and dogs and any other sentient being with a smile (much like my mother-in-law.) Did you catch the part when Deagle went flying the hell out of her house! OMG so funny when that she-dog took off like that!! Polly played that role perfectly!! Because she managed to make Mrs. Deagle appear just as mean-spirited and vicious as any violent monster, even Naomi Campbell!      Here's some fun facts and trivia about \\"Gremlins\\" and the people who were in it:  * The voice of Gizmo was voiced by Howie Mandell.   * As a result of the controversy that erupted, the MPAA formed a new rating (PG-13.)  * The scene with Mrs. Peltzer killing one of the Gremlins in the microwave caused the most controversy.   * There really is a mythical creature called a Mogwai (keep in mind, it is mythical.)  * Because of its huge worldwide, unprecedented popularity, Warner Bros. decided to re-release \\"Gremlins\\" to theaters the following summer after its initial success.   * Zach Galligan guest stared on one ep of \\"Melrose Place\\" during the first season.   * Phoebe Cates stared in another cult-favorite, 1991's \\"Drop Dead Fred.\\"   * Since taking the role of Mrs. Deagle, Polly Holliday has never been able to shake the image of a homely old lady, and has been typecast ever since.   * Zach Galligan has often been confused with Randall Batinkoff (who stared in Molly Ringwald's \\"For Keeps.\\")   * There was a little-known horror movie from 1987, \\"Munchies,\\" which had very similar-looking creatures.    * There was actually one Mogwai (from the first batch, before any of them morphed into those destructive Gremlins) who actually showed kindness towards Gizmo; he was named Earl.     Why do I consider this the granddaddy of all 80's comedy/horror movies? Just because it's the whole good over evil saga; you know, the David and Goliath Story. And of course there's a sexy girl to keep Billy company, Kate Beringer (Phoebe Cates) who is always eager to help fight the good cause. And the entire movie is so implausible, you just can't help but laugh at the blatant and utter foolishness.      Over the years there's been a lot of speculation on the true meaning of \\"Gremlins.\\" I've heard so many different stories. To me, the moral of the story is that not everything is the way it seems. Take this movie for instance, when it came out 24 years ago, everyone got their p@nties all knotted up because it was only PG. But most of these people probably never even watched the movie. Because it wasn't scary or vulgar or offensive in the least bit. It was a comedy mixed with satire. Often, people are most afraid of things that they never even look at.

B00005JPTK|2.0|I absolutely loved the movie.  I believe it is Will Smith's best role since \\"Ali\\" and shows that he has some serious acting talent, as he holds his own in the first 2/3rds of the movie as the only screen presence for the film (minus flashbacks) opposite only a dog as his only companion and friend.<br /><br />I thought it was phenomenally shot, and genuinely the scariest movie I've ever seen in my adult life.  Nothing I'd seen until then was genuinely frightening (and not just a cheap teen horror thrill with a loud sound and/or violin shriek) when Sam (Neville's dog) rushes after a deer into a pitch dark area, with only a gun-mounted flashlight, and absolutely no music playing whatsoever.<br /><br />Followed by another genuinely frightening scene, in which Fred (one of the mannequins Neville sets up outside a video store to talk to) has been moved (as part of a Darkseeker's trap), and nearly drives Neville insane, thinking Fred is perhaps a real person, and having to shoot him to be sure, only to spring the trap.<br /><br />As great as the movie was, and as frightening as it was, and as heartbreaking as it was to see the fate of his family and his dog, I spend about 18 dollars for the special edition two-disc version.<br /><br />And I spend double the price for the single disc for... maybe five minutes extra footage, tops?<br /><br />Disc one is basically the same thing you'd get in the normal edition; movie plus four animated comics.  Disc two gives you THE SAME MOVIE with maybe five minutes additional footage, such as some minor deleted scenes setting up the premise for the Darkseeker's evolution and intelligence, and the alternate ending, which while was a bit frightening and touching at once, was hardly groundbreaking and not at all controversial.<br /><br />Spoiler Alert: The \\"alternate\\" version of the movie just has a butterfly reference (the Darkseeker girl's tattoo), a scene with Neville showing Anna and Ethan the trap the Darkseeker Alpha set for him, a scene with Ethan swimming in a fish pond while Anna asks about the Darkseeker's evolution, and the alternate ending, in which rather than sacrifice himself, Neville turns over the girl to the Darkseeker, who shows he can truly love, and the Darkseekers leave them be to escape, with a cure to the virus in hand.<br /><br />So for used on Amazon you get the single disc version for.. 8 dollars or so.  For used two-disc, you get for 14 (as of this date), and before that I paid 18 including shipping.<br /><br />So as with the Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix special edition, I got screwed; we all got screwed.<br /><br />Worthless.  Try again next time, Warner Brothers.asks about the Darkseeker's evolution, and the alternate ending, in which rather than sacrifice himself, Neville turns over the girl to the Darkseeker, who shows he can truly love, and the Darkseekers leave them be to escape, with a cure to the virus in hand.

0452289963|1.0|This book was reccomended by a relationship counselor - and I can tell you its pretty far out there and was no help. The book begins very flowery and the writing style goes back and forth from listing out numerous examples to illustrate points ...to exotic, descriptive words that are meant to impress.      If you can make it past the first few chapters you may find some meaning.      The author has a very dark view of humanity in the opening pages and to follow his line of thinking you have to identify with these ideas and be dedicated to completely re-working yourself.      This book does not give off positive vibes as you try to get into the first few chapters.  I also didn't really identify with the pain body idea that -this is a sentinent organism that lives inside of you an seeks out absolute negativeity -or the idea that a women's pain body begins soon after \\"menstruation.\\"  Makes me feel as if we are back in the 50's. I am sorry I feel more evolved than this...

B00005JKJA|5.0|This is Lynch's craziest film. Since I've seen it 4 times in 7 yrs. trying to 'understand' something about it, I guess it's one of my favorites. First, I have not followed the 10 hints in the DVD cover, if indeed the 10 hints are anything but another Lynch spoof. The film must be approached via what Theodor Reik called 'listening with the third ear' (or seeing with the third eye), registering first impressions. Logic won't work, this is more like looking for clues for a rare disease, or trying to discover whether a painting is a fake. The first impression was that I was reminded of 'Persona'. The second thing, represented by the garbage can event, is that dreams are reality here. But what about the older cracked pair at the airport, who were they? Did Dianne use her aunt's money to pay the old guy in the wheelchair to make sure that she was in the film? The 3rd thing is the message of 'Silencio', that the tape/dream keeps running even if the person performing quits playing. So I think Camilla 'dreamed' the whole affair up until she opened the box, at which point 'Betty' disappeared and the tape quit, especially since they both saw 'Betty' as Dianne dead in bed earlier. After that came the real story of events. Now, back to that ugly nut behind the garbage cans  .....
B0010YSD7M|4.0|When Stargate SG1 first appeared on the Showtime Pay network I was there with a bit of dread.  I know of many occations where a succcessful movie was bled for episodic television fare.  I was delighted in the differance from the Big Screen production and found it's quality writing and winning cast very addictive and enjoyable.  When after Ten years it was taken off Broadcast televison and going to Direct to DVD I was crossing my fingers that this trend would move forward to the new format.  After the first Made for DVD I must say it is a mixed bag.<br />  The story attemped to take alot of the concepts the producers were planning for the 11th season and it seems like they tried to jam them into a single feature length setting.  I think knowing the cast and the character development from the past ten years made a big diffeance for me to help  fill in the blanks that they had to race over to make it fit.  I am not sure if it will work the same magic for the newcommer.<br />  It had alot of things mixed together in a small box such as the Ori and the Replicators and the Giant Space Gate.  In the end the most evil cuts come from our earthbound evil element in the form of a misguied and compromized EOC agent who makes more of a mess then the Stargate team can handle...Well almost.<br />  The sound quality and picure is first rate and the special effects are a point above average from the televison series and the extras are reasonalbe and informative for both new viewers and the more experiance viewer.<br />  I concider this a must have for a true SG1 fan and would recomend it for almost any serious fan of good Sci Fi
0307387178|4.0|This is the story of an idealistic boy born with the name Chris McCandless who was from a well to do family, but turned his back on his family, took on a new name (Alexander Supertramp), marched into the Alaskan wilderness with a large bag of rice, and never came out, perishing in an old school bus.  I think, as Krakauer says in his book, it is easy when you are young to believe that what you desire is no less than what you deserve, to assume that if you want something badly enough, it is your God-given right to have it...to mistake passion for insight and act according to an obscure, gap-ridden logic, to suffer from hubris and perhaps an appalling innocence...and to assume that one act will fix all that is wrong in your life.  This book is very well written and Krakauer obviously feels a connection to Chris as their backgrounds were very similar; both of them adventurers at heart and with strained relationships with their fathers.  And Chris's obsession with wilderness, and living the life of the non-conformist are beautifully told with quotes from Thoreau's Walden introduced at just the right point in the narrative.  But one comes away from this book with such mixed feelings.  You can't help but admire this sadly misguided young man in a lot of ways, but he still broke all ties with his family and just walked away.  As a parent, I can't imagine what it would be like not knowing where your son was or what was happening in his life.  So something that Chris's Dad said at the end of the book still haunts me...he said \\"How is it that a kid with so much compassion could cause his parents so much pain.\\"  I'd like to know the answer to that question.

Reading this book is simple but putting his program into practice is another story.  His approach did change the way I reflect on my life experience.  The discipline and courage required to Practice Consciousness requires full attention.  When reading this book it is so easy to see how we get involved with activities that support mindlessness.  Now we are taught the ramifications of mindlessness and how to reconnect via existentialism and move forward in our lives.

B000R7HY0K|3.0|Tarantino's homage to B movie exploitation films just about works. Mainly I think this is down to the teriffic car chases and a superb performance by Kurt Russell as Stuntman Mike.<br /><br />However in many other areas this was a disappointment. I found some of the dialogue between the women unrealistic and Tarantino has used some if it before (i.e. discussions about foot massages). Yes it was quite violent in places. Noteably, the first female victim and first car crash. The grainy/fake film look worked quite well, but I never really cared about any of the characters in the film.<br /><br />For a film with a very insubstantial plot this was also too long. To justify its current length (110mins) some of Tarantino's trademark dialog could have been cut or replaced with more exploitation! Most genre films of that type were short (e.g. Texas Chainsaw Massacre was under 90mins).<br /><br />Tarantino is a talented director and filmmaker who has a proven record in successfully reinventing old genres. In this case he hasn't quite succeeded. Its certainly worth seeing, but I'd rent first rather than buy.

B00000ING2|4.0|The \\"Hudsucker Proxy\\" is without a doubt, very fun. With their first comedy since \\"Raising Arizona\\", the Coen Brothers create a highly stylistic film.  In terms of this style, two adjectives come to mind to describe the whole feel of this film, surreal and comic book-like.  I would go as far as saying that this film is the most stylistic of the Coen Brothers first six films, because these two adjectives (surreal and comic book-like) penetrate every angle, character, facial expression and word.    Why you will like this movie: (No Major Spoilers)  1.)Paul Newman (of \\"Cool Hand Luke\\", \\"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\\", a dozen other great films, and delicious \\"Newman's Own\\" food products) is in it.  2.) Tim Robbins is in it.  3) In the very beginning a man climbs his desk, runs and leaps to his death out of his office building.  4.) There is a battle between good and evil (Newman's Henchman and the Clock Tower worker).   5.) A hysterical scene of children mesmerized by a little boy using the Hula Hoop for the first time.   6.) Fast talking New Yorkers.  7.) Excellent movie sets.

0790731452|4.0|I have always loved Tim Burton films. Even as a child, before I ever new a name of any director out there, I did know Burton. Also Unlike any film maker out there, I have seen seven of the fourteen feature films that he has made, when they were in the theatre (including \\" The Nightmare Before Christmas\\"). Wondering if his films will captivate me as they did when I was younger, I thought that I will begin to rewatch these films which I have not seen in many years and write reviews as I view them from the perspective of someone older.     Well, starting out of order with \\"Mars Attacks!\\", I am not disappointed.  This film is as fun as I remembered it, but this time around it was even more fun because I understood those hidden jokes and gags that as a child  I never would have known had hidden meanings. In Burton's A-movie wanting to be a B-movie I was also surprised by the ensemble cast. While Nicholson and Brosnan I remembered, I was surprised to see Jack Black, Martin Short, Natalie Portman and even Jim Brown!!    I enjoyed the fact that: (The Slightest of Spoilers)    The aliens are deliriously cold-as-ice evil.  Skeletons zapped by the aliens guns stay fluorescent green or red.  Jack Black is a like a jock.  The woman with the slit in her throat from Beetlejuice, Sylvia Sidney was in it (who incidentally in real life died of throat cancer).  The movie opens to a herd of running cows on fire.
B0013D8LOU|5.0|On the corner of Fleet Street there lies a forgotten bakery -- home of the worst pies in London. Upon this rests a barber shop, the once popular alcove of Mr. Barker, the most dexterous barber in all of England. That was twelve years ago, and the London once known -- that surreal, jovial society -- has been replaced by a dark and gritty reality.    But things are about to change. A new ship has docked in the ports of London, and with it a familiar face has returned. Sweeney Todd -- formerly Mr. Barker -- is back, his fabled shaves as close as ever. And this time, he's cutting a whole lot more than hair.    So begins the tale that is Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street. At once enchanting and horrific, dazzling and gritty, it is a sweeping musical experience not quite like anything seen -- or heard -- before.    Johnny Depp gives a stellar performance of the chilling Demon Barber, making Sweeney a figure of both sympathy and hatred. His vocals are shrill and haunting, dark and ominous -- the perfect complement to the dreary world Director Tim Burton has so marvelously depicted. Equally impressive is the role of his accomplice, Mrs. Lovette, played by none other than Helena Bonham Carter. Together, Depp and Carter lend a subtly terrifying musical atmosphere to the film that's nothing short of brilliant.    Much like the accompanying music, the cinematography of Sweeney Todd is fantastic. From the dark corridors of present London to the elegant décor of the city passed, you'll be swept away by the powerful force of ambient lighting and carefully coordinated themes. It's a subtle -- yet brilliant -- achievement that's sure to appease those hungry for high-quality cinema.    All of this brings us to one sole fact -- Sweeney Todd is no ordinary film with average actors and a typical director. It is a paramount achievement in recent cinema, one you shouldn't miss. Just remember to bring snacks. Mrs. Lovette's human meat-pies are sure to raise your appetite.

B000ZN802W|5.0|But don't make a mistake.<br /><br />The theme of this emotionally wrenching drama (script and direction from Sean Penn, from a best-selling nonfiction book by Jon Krakauer) is not man versus wild, as it was in the works of one of the protagonist's heroes, Jack London.  Instead the conflict is between man and society.  Chris McCandless has just graduated from college.  His parents are proud.  His grades are good enough for a top grad school.  He's bright, personable.  It seems he has everything going for him.<br /><br />But he's bitter and disappointed.  He disrespects his parents and believes that the last thing he wants to do is act out their idea of success.  So he gives the $24,000 he has in the bank for grad school to charity and just ups and leaves home.  He has some Kerouac-like adventures on the road where as a \\"leather tramp\\" he meets some ordinary people, some good people, some retro hippies, some Middle American farm workers, some derelicts and a social worker in L.A., a pretty girl, an old man, etc., and then, believing \\"you don't need human relationships to be happy,\\" it's north to Alaska to live out a dream that might have been dreamt by Thoreau or Jack London.<br /><br />But we know from the very beginning of the film that Chris McCandless AKA \\"Alexander Supertramp\\" will die in the Alaskan wilderness at a tender age in 1992.  Was his death the result of stupidity regarding the dangers of going \\"into the wild\\" or was it a result of bad luck or accident?  Or was it the indirect result of the hypocritical and mercantile values of his parents and his society to which he overreacted?  Or even, was it the indirect result of a kind of youthful bravado that could overtake many a young man?<br /><br />What Chris does is what a renunciant in an Eastern religion might do: he leaves society to live alone in the woods.  He renounces society's shallow values and lives as simply as possible.  But Chris is not practicing an Eastern religion.  He is not an old man near the end of his life looking for moksha.  He is under the influence of Thoreau and Jack London, whose books he has read and loved.  He wants to test himself against the wild without help from anyone.  He wants to prove his manhood to himself without the help of society or society's culture.<br /><br />But he is a greenhorn in the Alaskan wilderness whose fate is sealed.<br /><br />The way that Jon Krakauer and Sean Penn have reconstructed this story (partly from notes and even from some carvings that Chris made, and partly from interviews with people who knew Chris) we see that at one point after some weeks in the wilderness Chris suddenly realizes something profound and moving.  He says, referring to the great beauty of life and the world that he is able to see: \\"Happiness is only real when it's shared..\\"  At that point he has learned what he needed to learn from the wilderness and from the people he met in his trek across the country.<br /><br />The great tragedy of this movie is what then befalls Chris.<br /><br />The ending is emotionally gut-retching and yet somehow cathartic.  To watch such a likeable, honest and spiritually advanced young man with such potential seem to throw it all away, carelessly, foolishly, or accidently, is a human tragedy brilliantly brought to the printed page and to the screen for all of us to share.  And in this sharing Chris's life gains new meaning and he becomes a guide and a teacher for all of us.<br /><br />I know it must have been very difficult for his parents to cooperate in the telling of Chris's story since the story does not show them in a favorable light.  Yet the very fact that they helped bring Chris's story to us shows perhaps where Chris got his moral courage.  I have no doubt that it was their deep love for their son that moved them to find that emotional courage.  This movie gives meaning to Chris's life and shows their love for him, and allows a wide audience to see that he did not die in vain.<br /><br />I want to congratulate not only Krakauer and Penn but also Emile Hirsch who played the part of Chris McCandless.  The role was enormously demanding, the sort of role that an actor may only get once in a lifetime, if he's lucky.  And Hirsch played it well.  He was charming and witty and very strong of character.  What a splendid tribute to the real Chris.  And kudos to Hal Holbrook who played Ron Krantz to an emotional tee, deeply sympathetic to both his character and to Chris's, and to the significance of the film itself.<br /><br />And the rest of the cast was also very good, although Kristen Stewart was a little too pretty for the part of the 16-year-old trailer troubadour, and of course William Hurt could have used a larger role.<br /><br />The lesson of this story, it seems to me is this: Young people of courage and honor, even though they may make mistakes, even though they may be mistaken at a fundamental level, can, through their valor, teach us all something important.  As Chris told Ron Krantz, \\"Get off your butt, old man.  The core of a man's spirit comes from new experiences.\\"  What he is also saying is: live every moment in a genuine way.  And we can see that is what Chris did.  A life so lived, although short, may well be the equal of a much longer life lived not so authentically.art of Chris McCandless.

B0013BNY2Q|5.0|Like many long-time REM fans, after living with \\"Around the Sun,\\" I had decided that I would not mindlessly buy the next REM album without hearing it first.  I was tired of the slow, serious, and plodding band that REM had become.  They were still interesting, but extended listening to ATS was painful.  REM had forgotten how to rock.  They had forgotten how to have fun.  Most importantly, they had forgotten to make the music fun for their fans.    The first notes of \\"Living Well's the Best Revenge,\\" blows away the dark clouds of ATS.  It's hard not to smile and whirl around the room.  Stipe's voice in \\"Man-sized Wreath\\" reveals a hint of lightheartedness that, while once an REM trademark, had disappeared by the time of ATS.  \\"Supernatural Superserious\\" has energy AND beauty.  \\"Hollow Man\\" builds from a quiet ballad into a full throttled song without losing it's heart.  \\"Houston\\" seems a bit awkward after the first few listens, with its somber tone, odd keyboard squak on the downbeat, and 6/8 feel with riff's seeming borrowed from \\"Try Not To Breathe.\\"  Eventually, however, it all seems to work.  The title track is the type of odd, quirky, minor key rocker that builds tension and releases it in short, repeated bursts of \\"Accelerate, Accelerate, Accelerate ...\\"  \\"Until the Day is Done\\" is a pleasent 6/8 number that reminds me of \\"Daysleeper.\\"  \\"Mr. Richards\\" is a slow-paced rocker energized by a droning guitar pattern and a heavy drumbeat.  \\"Sing for the Submarine\\" is a slow 6/8 tune with lyrical references to earlier REM pieces.  It almost doesn't work, but simple effective production and building drama pull it off.  \\"Horse To Water\\" is another great all-out rocker.  \\"I'm Gonna D.J.\\" is hilarious rocker.    Accelerate and the songs on it are short, but that brevity keeps REM from the aimless meandering they engaged in during their recent past.    Best news-  It looks like Stipe won't be wearing a mask of blue make-up this tour!
B000001DQG|5.0|Elton John's music in the 70's was the bomb. Lyrics by Bernie Taupin with band Nigel, Dee and David, they played the new exciting cutting edge stuff that says \\"Love me, hate me, I don't care\\" and I loved it.  Brilliant and inspired with styles that contrast from song to song and from Album to Album, it was the right time and the right mix to make an album that sounds as fresh and emotionally demanding as the day I first bought my Vinyl LP way over 30 years ago. Caribou along with Captain Fantastic, Don't Shoot me and Yellow Brick Road will live far beyond the safe (boring) middle of the road music he churns out today. Today they label Captain Fantastic a \\"concept\\" album but back then he was middle of the road in a burning hotbed of the politically charged 70's.  Caribou has some of the best music of Elton's prime with styles ranging from Rock and Roll to Dixie and plenty in between. And with the bonus track of Pinball Wizard, you may want to think of buying \\"Tommy\\" on DVD too and teaching the kids about Rock Opera's.  Don't ignore Caribou because of Captin Fantastic, buy them both and do yourself a real favour. Pollute the kids mind's with 70's Rock when you didn't have to swear to make number 1 with a bullet.

B000N6TYLW|5.0|Love this season of Gilmore Girls.  You really need to get them all because they are so good.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|I literally just finished watching this movie.  Hands down fantastic.  I've been a fan of the series since the first season and mourned when Richard Dean Anderson left the show, but was intrigued (if a little confused) by the Ori arc.  I have to admit that I didn't see every episode the last few seasons, and the last dvd set I bought was season 8, but I was completely and utterly entertained by the movie.  High production value, great script, good combo of action/dialog/science and tech that has always been a trademark of SG-1.  I highly recommend it.
B000BB1MIC|5.0|This is a wonderful series to watch.  Buy all the Season's because you will want to watch them over and over.

B000WGYMAQ|5.0|I don't have much to say about Rent except for that it was well directed and has a great story line.  It's definitely not a \\"for everyone\\" movie, but for the right person it definitely tugs at the heart strings.  I cannot count the number of times I have watched it and/or listened to the soundtrack.  The movie was very well cast and the addition of Rosario Dawson & Traci Tomms as JoAnne and Mimi were exquisite - I actually prefer them over the originals.
B000001FMC|5.0|On the strength of the first two singles (Breakout and Twilight World) I picked up a copy of \\"It's Better To Travel\\". The disc starts off superbly with SOS's signature song, \\"Breakout\\", an uplifting anthem about self empowerment. The words convey a simple message: if you're in a draining, futureless, mundane place in life, find the strength to leave and start anew. Truth be told, the first few times I heard \\"Breakout\\" on the radio, I thought it was too syrupy sweet and \\"boppy\\" sounding. I'm not sure how or when, but the song grew on me and I began to really like it. Next up is \\"Twilight World\\", perhaps my favorite track. I was, and still am, mesmerized by the sheer coolness of this tune. That fabulous intro (announcements being made over a train station PA system) evokes a Pavlovian response in me. The horns come in and my heart starts to race. Then that FAT bassline drops! Mmmmm... My head is nodding and my toes are tapping...  The strings fade in and I'm floating! Corinne starts off singing in a very low key and then proceeds, throughout the song, to do the most amazing things with her voice. \\"Twilight World\\" is beautifully arranged in magnificent layers of instruments and vocals. This tune sends me straight to cloud nine...<br /><br />After the familiarity of those two radio releases, Better To Travel gains momentum. \\"After Hours\\", and \\"Communion\\" are luxuriant, moody pieces, teeming with despair. \\"Fooled By A Smile\\" is a dark warning about losing someone special because \\"the grass looked greener\\". I love the contrast between the sunny, upbeat music and the woeful subject matter. This had to be intentional, it works beautifully... \\"Its Not Enough\\" is another of my all time favs. Love the bassline and the hook is completely addictive! I remember my kids, very young at the time, walking around the house singing \\"Don't say you're sorry, don't even try!\\" Hilarious!<br /><br />It's Better To Travel (Swing Out Sister's debut album) is nothing short of spectacular. This is one of those CDs that puts a big smile on your face because you're so glad you bought it! Every track is extremely well-crafted. I find the lyrics to be profusely emotional. SOS shows a strong affinity for heartrending torch songs. Corinne proves herself to be an extraordinary vocalist. Her voice is clear as a bell. Every word she sings is easily discernable. I find this to be a good measure of any singer's ability. Andy is brilliant on piano. Martin's drumming is superb, making those basslines absolutely enthralling. This CD is far greater than the sum of its parts. And thus, my love affair, my obsession, with this band took deep root.<br /><br />If you're a fan of Basia, Lisa Stansfield, Sade, etc. \\"Its Better To Travel\\" is a must have...e CDs that puts a big smile on your face because you're so glad you bought it!

B0013ANMWY|4.0|Good movie. Outside of the Other's I don't usually like Nicole Kidman's movie's. I did like this one alot. Worth the time.
B00003CX9S|5.0|There really are no words to adequately describe the power and intensity of this great film.  With a perfectly crafted script, brilliant acting, and superb direction by David Lynch, The Elephant Man is a gut wrenching film that will move your heart and soul.  And anyone who can get through the entire film, and especially the ending, without being moved to tears, doesn't have a heart or soul.  John Hurt - surely one of the greatest actors ever - gives a performance of a lifetime, and shows what great acting is all about.  Without his face even being seen, he brings to bear all the actor's skills - his voice, the use of body language and gesture, timing, etc., to irresistibly evoke emotional response.  The entire cast gives an incredible ensemble performance - Anthony Hopkins, Anne Bancroft, John Gielgud, and Freddy Jones in a virtuoso turn that has to be seen to be believed.  A film that explores the depth of cruelty to which mankind can sink, and the height of benevolence to which mankind can rise.  All in all a stunning film not to be missed.  But be warned.  This is not an easy film to watch.
0618918248|4.0|The first half of the book did not grab my attention due to Dawkin's overbearing scientific reasononing on why the world, creatures, etc. could be here without the presence of a \\"God.\\" Because I have accepted the scientific reasoning with regards to Darwin, Big Bang and so on; the conversation bores me. I am more interested in the psychology involving the creation of gods and religion by humans. Most of the book's discussion on the psychological aspect is nothing new. Although, I did find some of the quotes from Einstein and Twain quite amusing. Overall it was a good read.
B00005Q4CS|2.0|this movie is not a very good one. I didn't get it at first, but then the stories were really sad and had no positive endings. I didn't like this one
B00006I53S|4.0|I just started in photography with coaching I was recommended this lens to start for wide angle.  The more I experience with it the more I think this may accommodate a variety of my shots.  It covers detail and depth of field. An excellent lens.

B0013N8VWW|4.0|Este es un buen album, tiene un sonido es bastante acústico (no es un unplugged, pero se podría llegar a serlo).  Realmente me gusto mucho escucharlo una y otra vez, tiene temas muy buenos, sobre todo el primer single \\"I Thought I'd Seen Everything\\", por mencionar uno de los tracks.  Si eres fanatico de Bryan Adams, no dudes en comprar este cd, y si no lo eres, estoy seguro que te va a gustar, tiene temas muy interesantes y bien elabordos.

0452289963|5.0|Very informative.  Deep reading...needs a couple of reviews to fully understand,but in the long run makes perfect sense.

B0002NRQTI|5.0|Seg&uacute;n mi opini&oacute;n este disco Counterparts de Rush es uno de los mejores discos de los 90's, se identifica las distorsiones de guitarras que se imponen a muchos grupos de la onda grunge y una versatilidad del bajista que ojal&aacute; tenga pronto la suerte de ver en vivo.
B000002LFU|5.0|This is personally my favorite album (and I own all R.E.M.'s albums)as it is the album that got me into this group. This is an excellent album to start out with if you are not too familiar with R.E.M. Songs like Stand, Orange Crush, and Pop Song 89 make this album utterly amazing. Not to mention a great untitled hidden track (which I am still waiting to hear live). This is a must for anyone who likes R.E.M. the slightest bit.
B00005JCAA|5.0|I am a golfer. Not an avid golfer. I am an admitted rabid golfer.  Please stay with me for a minute. How much sense does that make and what does it have to do with Meet Joe Black. Well,....as the Jamaican woman said in the hospital, life is about collecting pictures/memories. In the game of golf, one can feel virtually every emotion known to man from absolute disgust and self loathing to the most extreme joy and contentment. Golfers who truly understand will tell you that Golf is about experiencing and creating powerful memories. And,...you can do it all in just over 3 hours per round every time you play. In the 3+ hours that it took to  watch this movie, I probably didn't experience every emotion, but the depth of emotion that I was taken to made up the difference. Everything about this movie was perfect. Only the best of true art is capable of such a journey. It was spiritual and at the same time it made me realize the incredible gift that the actors brought to the screen.    Yes, life is about collecting pictures and life is about building the type of life that Bill Parrish was portrayed to have built (\\"Daddy, everybody loves you\\"). I've learned much from this movie and hope you enjoy it as much as I did.    The casting for this movie was utter perfection from the Jamaican lady to the mesmerizing performance of Claire Forlani. I didn't think a human being could express such innocence and beauty. Sir Anthony Hopkins is truly our greatest living acting talent (maybe living or gone). Brad Pitt was so good as an unknowing, inncocent yet omni-powerful death that it was scary. Drew, Quince and Allison all the way down to the butler were exquisitley cast and executed with utter perfction.    There were so many best parts to the movie, but none could be better than the part near the end when Susan (Claire Forlani) and death emberace as death tries to tell her who he really is. This comes after a dare from Bill Parrish (Sir Anthony Hopkins).  It was a clinic in superb acting. Almost no words were spoken, but the point was made even more powerfully than if they were shouting at each other.     Lastly, everyone who took part in this movie was severely shafted, especially the director who happened to have created a masterpiece beyond comprehension. I say this becasue this movie got virtually no recognition and no praise. It surprisingly was not a blockbuster as it should have been. Maybe it was just intended for those of us who needed it. Oh well, it is now my favorite movie of all time, this from someone who loves science fiction and adventure. Ah romance.
B000MV9026|4.0|Great family movie.  If your kids love a good story and music, then you'll all love this movie.
B000V8I2QU|4.0|I've been a Springsteen fan since the time when Born to Run was still current. I would say I was a rabid Springsteen fan through the period of Born To Run-> Darkness on the Edge of Town -> The River -> Nebraska. In my eyes (ears), he started to stumble around the time of Born in the USA, which--though it is the album that made him a megastar--seemed rather weak at the time (and hasn't improved with age). Through the remainder of the '80s, Springsteen released only one album, Tunnel of Love, which tried to defy the superstar make-me-another-one-like-you-just-made that Born in the USA had set up with a decidedly more contemplative mood. While it featured some great songs, as an album it was only good.<br /><br />Then, with the advent of the new decade, things took a sharp turn for the worse. There was the spotty double CD released as two singles (Human Touch/Lucky Town), the dry Ghost of Tom Joad, the preachy and dry Rising and the slightly better Devils and Dust. There were good intentions littered about, some good lyrics, and some good tunes. But none of these albums created the kind of listening experience that begged you to push repeat after the album was over.<br /><br />2006's We Shall Overcome, which consists primarily of dusty Pete Seeger covers, was another thing entirely. I like Pete Seeger, and I suppose this album is good enough for what it is. But I find it unlistenable. After slogging through about 2/3 of the album, I just took it off out of boredom. My love affair with Springsteen was over.<br /><br />Or so I thought. When the new album came out, arriving on a wave of \\"back to the E Street sound you love!\\" hype, I passed it off as desperation. Then I heard the leadoff single, \\"Radio Nowhere\\", and I was even more convinced this was not gonna be good. Lyrically, Radio Nowhere is classic Springsteen-in-non-epic mode. But musically, it's just too tired and monotonous. Anyone who's ever tried to play Springsteen on their own guitar (or just glanced at a Springsteen songbook) has quickly realized that the classic Springsteen song is characterized by a simple chord progression made something special by a solid arrangement and a fantastic, sympathetic band. When things are working, you don't even notice the simplicity of the underlying music because of the great arrangement and interesting lyrics. Well, on Radio Nowhere the FIRST thing you notice is that this song is musically monotonous. Yeah, it sounds like Bruce, but this is B-side Bruce, not something that should open an album.<br /><br />So, in light his past few album misses this first single--which I consider to be subpar--I was far from excited about listening to the whole album. As a result, the album sat on my \\"to listen to\\" pile for nearly half a year.<br /><br />Finally, one night, I put it on. Track one: Radio Nowhere. Sounds just like the b-side it sounded like when I first heard it. Track two: You'll be Comin' Down. Nice, poppy and catchy, but more the kind of Twinkie that belongs, again on a B-side than prime Bruce. Track three: Livin' in the Future. Every rocking Springsteen album from the dawn of time has had a track that sound just about exactly like this one. It's always one of the worst tracks on the album, but at least in the past, the lyrics would sometimes redeem it. Here, the lyrics are just pathetic.<br /><br />At this point, I'm ready to pull the album off. But I'll give the next song a chance. If it isn't better than what I've heard, that's the end.<br /><br />Track four: Your Own Worst Enemy. Well now, this is a bit better. This still isn't QUITE prime Springsteen, but it's not bad at all. OK, the album gets another chance.<br /><br />And THEN, FINALLY, things start to kick in.<br /><br />Track five: Gypsy Biker. OK folks, THIS is prime, timeless, classic Springsteen. This track could be from any album since Born to Run, and I mean that in a good way. Good lyrics, good song, good E-street performance. Please, Bruce, let this be an omen, and not a fluke...<br /><br />Track six: Girls in their Summer Clothes. It's not a fluke! This is the E-Street Band in full-out Spector mode. It's a good, catchy bon-bon. Not the cornerstone of the album, but really enjoyable.<br /><br />Track seven: I'll Work for Your Love. Hmmm...OK. Back to something approaching b-side territory. Not terrible by any means, but kind of insubstantial, despite some lyrical patches that are reminiscent of classic Springsteen.<br /><br />Track eight: Magic. This sounds EXACTLY like something that might have come from side two of Born in the USA. To me it sounds like an inferior cousin to Born's (best track) \\"Downbound Train\\"). Alright, but I'm starting to worry that the momentum he got going with tracks five and six is waning.<br /><br />Tracks 9-11: Last to Die, Long Walk Home, Devil's Arcade. W-O-W. Well, OK. Welcome home, Bruce, all is forgiven. Bullseye. Here we have a nice stretch of classic Springsteen music. There hasn't been a 3 song trifecta of this quality since...well at least Nebraska. THIS is why I kept buying all those other Springsteen albums...Winners all around: top flight lyrically and musically, and the E-Street band really brings it all home.<br /><br />Well, what can I say? There are five tracks here (Gypsy Biker, Girls, Last to Die, Long Walk Home and Devil's Arcade) that would form about 60% of as good an album as Bruce has ever released, outside of Born to Run. Of the remaining tracks, there are only a couple of stinkers, and even one of those (Radio Nowhere) has started to grow on me--just a bit--since I've started to play the album incessantly.<br /><br />And that's really the key to this album: It is an album--the first Springsteen album in ages--that does beg you to play it, in total, over and over. For once, there was truth in the hype: This IS Springsteen's best album in many years. Too bad he wasted his last great original opus length track (\\"Land of Hope and Dreams\\") on a live album from a few years ago, because if he'd included that song here instead and jettisoned some of the B-side stuff (albeit high quality b-side stuff), this album would be a stone cold classic.a fluke!

B000OVLBGC|5.0|From the first frame to the last incredibly moving moment, \\"The Lives of Others\\" tells a delicate, suspenseful and beautifully moving story about an East German officer before the fall of the Berlin Wall, and how his surveillance of a playwright and his wife changes his life (and theirs) forever. The title is as much about envy as it is about discovery -- the main character is a painfully solitary man -- one who has always done his duty -- but this small surveillance changes him in ways he could never have anticipated. He grows to care for the lives he witnesses -- and to (perhaps) envy them.<br /><br />For instance, there's a small incidental scene where a little boy passes on his father's insult about the Stazi (the DDR police) and the man turns to snap at the boy and to reflexively ask what his father's name is (as he is used to doing -- everyone is supposed to be 'turned in' for the slightest infraction). And yet he has changed. He can't finish the sentence. It's a very small moment but it stayed with me.<br /><br />For those who may be a bit skittish about foreign films or 'art' films, I strongly recommend giving this movie a shot. It's easy to follow, incredibly well acted, and has a powerful ending.  As a snapshot of a particularly grim time and place, it's terrifying. The suspense is a constant presence because of the \\"everyone's watching\\" premise -- every word overheard, every action seen, every thought anticipated. The tension is constant.<br /><br />And Ulrich M&uuml;he simply owns the film. I was so sorry to hear of his death after filming, as the man has an incredible screen presence -- he's absolutely riveting, and despite his character's quietness, your eye is always drawn to him. His face is so expressive that its very stillness is powerful (and never more so than in the film's final and very satisfying moment).<br /><br />Note: The main Amazon review talks about \\"too many epilogues\\" and I can't disagree with this enough. The ending, for me, is perfect -- heartlifting, powerful, and beautiful.eautiful.
B0013BNY2Q|2.0|I wanted to like this. Really. The predetermined meta-narrative of this album is so easy to buy into: \\"world-class rock band returns to form after alienating fans with a tepid album of thin-blooded alterna-Muzak dreck.\\" And, to an extent, that's even true: I don't know a single person (including, reportedly, all the members of R.E.M.) that didn't think Around the Sun was the absolute nadir of their career.    But, oops, there's a problem with this. First and foremost, \\"rock,\\" as such, was never, ever R.E.M.'s forte. Sure, during their I.R.S. heyday--and, yes, I'm one of those that would take any track they released during the 80's (excluding the throw-away Dead Letter) over any track they produced subsequently--R.E.M. could toss off the occasional successful rocker: \\"These Days,\\" \\"It's the End of the World,\\" etc. But, at heart, they never were a \\"rock\\" band at all. They were pure melody-driven, sing-a-long-able pop. Their rock gestures have been, by and large, forgettable: except for a few determined contrarians, Monster is usually considered their weakest album before Around the Sun came along, and rightly so.    Alas, Accelerate is basically Monster redux. Louder, faster...even less memorable. I've played through it at least a dozen times and not a single track sticks in my memory. In fact, most of them sound kind of the same. Riffs it has aplenty...but memorable melodies? Nary a one. So while I approve of Peter Buck actually being allowed (gasp!) to play guitar, am pleased to hear M. Mills' backing vocals feature prominently once again, and note that Stipe has apparently rediscovered irony, I actually find the sum and total very blah. Better than ATS? Of course. But not as good as (the wildly underrated) Reveal, and nowhere near as good as New Adventure in Hi-Fi, let alone any of the albums of the band's great period.     Kudos to R.E.M. for still bothering to release new material when most other 25-year-old bands would be happy just to play the \\"greatest hits\\" for the one zillioneth time. But let's keep our eye on the ball here, shall we? This is mediocre. A step back in the right direction...but, if you spin any one of the first nine albums, light-years away from a return to form. 2.5 stars.
0198534469|4.0|I bought the book after the 2 chapters on complex analysis in \\"the road to reality\\" by  Roger Penrose left me scratching my head. This book covers much of the same ground, but at a more gentle pace (600 pages vs. 10 or so!). As I'm making my way through it, I feel it does genuinely justice to its stated goal.

B0010VXOXS|5.0|You always have to wonder if an import version with so-called \\"bonus tracks\\" is worth all of the extra money. THIS ONE IS! Disc One features, in addition to the original 11 tracks, \\"Era Vulgaris (Richard File remix)\\"; (I believe this was originally intended as Track 8 following \\"Make it Wit' Chu\\" because the latter ends with the same horns/sounds as what the former begins with. Pretty good tune); \\"The Fun Machine Took a S**t & Died\\", (an outstanding tune much more complex than the live version done on \\"Over the Years ..\\");  A remix of \\"I'm Designer\\" (decent) and an acoustic version of \\"Make it Wit' Chu\\" round out Disc One.<br />  THE HIGHLIGHT OF THIS PACKAGE IS THE STUNNING DISC TWO, a live set recorded in Amsterdam in late 2007. Josh Homme has family and friends in Amsterdam and it shows as he and the audience have a great time throughout this 50-min. disc. Featuring:<br />1. Monster in the Parasol  2.Misfit Love (first time as a live recording)<br />3.If Only  4.I Think I Lost My Headache 5. Into the Hollow (also a 1st time live recording)  6. Go With the Flow  7.Regular John  8.Avon<br />9. Song for the Dead<br />From start to finish, a masterful live performance. I absolutely love the live concert featured in \\"Over the Years and Through the Woods,\\" and until now, didn't think it could be topped. This concert performance is better. \\"Misfit Love\\", \\"If Only\\"' \\"I Think I Lost My Headache\\", and \\"Into the Hollow\\" is one hell of a 4 song run.  \\"Song for the Dead\\" is a great wrap-up song. But the real gem of this disc is the nearly 11-minute version of \\"Regular John\\", a vastly different version than the same tune on \\"Over the Years.\\"<br />There are a couple spots where I wish the lead guitars were mixed a little louder but, over all, a great live recording.<br />If you are a QOTSA fan, this is a MUST HAVE collection!
B000PKG7TI|5.0|[[ASIN:B000FGFSWE End of an Era]]  I have played this DVD over and over again.  When they come to the USA in my area I am there as close to the stage as possible.

You will end up banging your head with the best of them.
B0013BNY2Q|1.0|I realize that the reviews for this are mostly quite favorable. Being a big REM fan for many years and seeing the reviews, I purchased Accelerate without hearing a single note. Big mistake. Sample the tracks first. Maybe you'll like it, maybe not - but I may save a few people from the same mistake I made.<br /><br />Maybe on a big old stereo system (if anyone still has one) this might sound better but on an iPod, where I presume most of you will listen to it, it's just a lot of noise. The sound quality is not good, the songs (if you can call them that) are forgettable. If I could get my money back, I would. One good thing - listening to the CD turned me off from buying concert tickets to REM's current tour. So the $10 I 'wasted' on the CD saved me many times that in the price of the tickets that I didn't buy.<br /><br />An anxiously awaited CD and one very disappointed fan.

0316113506|5.0|Highly recommended. It will help to explain and motivate individuals who suffer from any number of today's health-related problems.    This book explains so much about the inter-relationship of the mind and  body, though a bit technical at times. A  few simple diagrams / graphics would have been a nice addition - next printing perhaps.    I happened to read it after successfully weening myself from years of anti-depresents. I understand how I was able to be so successful even though my doctor lacked a firm sense of these beliefs. It helps to know the key to so much personal recovery/growth is within AND backed-up by science.     Like Dorothy in The Wizard of OZ, we have the capacity to improve and make the changes we seek. Exercise is the 'ruby slipper' It cranks up the brain and gets us where we want to go.     THANK YOU FOR MAKING THIS BOOK! It is an important read and keeper but pass it on: Improving one's mind/body experience is the best gift we can share!

B0013FBS20|2.0|Just like my title states, I felt as if they hurried this movie and so the CGI suffered. The zombie/mummy/whatever-they're-called were very cartoonish. GREAT concept and story, but not a good film. I also felt as if Will Smith's acting wasn't his best. It almost seems as if his mind was elsewhere. If they had spent more time on this film (particularly the CGI), it would have been one of the decade's best. I think I'll wait for the remake so that they can get their CGI to where it looks better than a Disney/Pixar movie. Actually, I think I'm just going to order the book instead.

B000W7JWUA|5.0|I'd read a little bit about this game on the Penny Arcade blog. They seemed to like it so I figured I'd try it out one day. I finally bought it (along with the Cities and Knights and Seafarer's expansions) and played it with a friend of mine.    It seems a bit simple at first (a 20 or so grid board with wooden play pieces) and the rules seem complicated but once you get the hang of it, the game becomes a lot of fun.     It's essentially a board/table-top version of a small part of a Civ game. You have a grid of plots that each have different terrain. That terrain translates to a resource (i.e. a Forest gives you Wood, a Field gives you Grain, etc.). You place numbered disks on each plot which correspond to numbers on a 2d6 roll (2-12, except for 7). When that number comes up, any player with a settlement on the edge of the plot that has the number rolled gets a resource (in the form of cards in a deck). You can then take resources to build more settlements, cities and roads. You can also buy a card from the Development deck which is slanted towards one type of card unfortunately (the Knight) but some of the cards let you do stuff like buy something for less, steal resources from other players and the like.    There is this robber concept where a robber sits on a desert plot and, when 7 is rolled, is moved by the player who rolled that 7. The robber cleans out anyone with more than 7 resource cards (you ditch half back to the deck) and then the player who rolled the 7 gets to take a card from a player adjacent to the plot where the robber is now located. Also, resources cannot be drawn from the plot the robber is on. It creates an interesting dynamic in the game and throws a nice curve into gameplay.    The ultimate goal is to get 10 victory points which you get by having settlements (1 VP), cities (2 VP), and any bonuses from the Development deck or by having the largest army (most knight cards above 3) or the longest contiguous road on the map.     You can make thegame a bit better (in my opinion) by getting the [[ASIN:B000W7I7EW Catan:  Cities & Knights Expansion - New 4th Edition!!!!!]] expansion which evolves the game play a bit more.     In terms of the contents of the box, the wooden pieces are a bit retro but they're nicely made. The cards are solid (not flimsy) and the game board is made of solid cardboard. I've seen some pretty cheap implementations of games and game components and this one looks solid if a bit retro.

B000ZN802W|4.0|This is movie goes far beyond the boundaries of road movies, and touches deeply the cord of adventure that is found in almost each of us. More will also identify with the rebellion from \\"society\\" and need for indipendence. This is what makes the movie so instinctively appealing.   The displayed scenary is beautiful (I have spent one week in Alaska and surely this movie makes me feel wanting to go back - in my quest for the \\"Magic bus\\").   The soundrack is also excellent.    However, after floating with different soothing feelings for 140 minutes, and having enjoyed landscape and music, one wonders what is left with.   There is a somewhat \\"neutral\\" way to tell the story.   Is Alex an irresponsible, naive guy, who, despite the education and culture earned at school, has not yet grasped the basics of living in this world?   How is it possible that it takes so much to him to comprehend that true happiness is achieved only when one shares experiences?   One does not find answers to such questions from Sean Penn's work, therefore has just to discard them. Ultimately, this has turned out leaving me with a feel of emptiness.     Finally, despite  the emphasis given to the rebellion and alterantive ways of living (e.g. people at Slab City), one could not avoid nociting that the bottom line is quite moralistic: Alex looses his life, for having turned his back from society and family.   Mind you, I am not saying that an happy ending would have added to the message of this movie. Anyone who has travelled Alaska will agree that you cannot play games with nature up there, so this ending perhaps is the only one that makes sense.     Lastly, the best quote is that to the apple being eaten: \\"you are so ... organic!\\" Something to remeber at boring dinners.

B000Y7ZHCU|5.0|Incredible performance by Celine Dion and her team.  Sound quality is excellent and the show is just amazing.  The stage is perfectly set for every performance.  Themes like The Power of Love, It's All Coming Back To Me Now, I Drove All Night, and the endless hit My Heart Will Go On, are outstandingly performed.  Celine also performs one of her hits of her French carrier and a song in Italian.  This is definitely a must have!!!!!!
B0013BNY2Q|5.0|Usually, I'm the type of listener who grumbles about a monetary transaction that results in ponying up $11.00 for only 35 minutes of music.  But given the down-tempo moodiness and soul-searching of the past three R.E.M. albums, I suppose I should've checked my doubts at the door.  \\"Accelerate\\" is a work of masterful brevity, leaving in its scorched trail a longing desire for just a bit more of that savory sound.  Only the finest albums in your library have this power.<br /><br />My initial attitude toward \\"Accelerate\\" was marked mostly by skepticism; I was, afterall, the guy who openly preferred the electro-pop glitch of \\"Up\\" (still my favorite R.E.M. record) and \\"Reveal\\" above the party vibe of \\"Life's Rich Pageant\\" or the distorted crunch of \\"Monster\\".<br /><br />But you've got to hand it to the boys from Athens: having been more or less musically derailed by the loss of drummer Bill Berry and a slew of mediocre responses to their subsequent releases, it was unlikely for these aging rock icons to push the envelope again.  It was worth the wait.<br /><br />Opener \\"Living Well is the Best Revenge\\" showcases more group confidence than the band has shown in a decade.  \\"Man Sized Wreath\\" includes a bassline far catchier than anything Mike Mills has pinned down since \\"Man on the Moon\\".  Michael Stipe's stream-of-conscious lyrics are at their best in \\"Horse to Water\\" and \\"I'm Gonna DJ\\".  Out of its 11 tracks, only \\"Until the Day is Done\\" indulges a more acoustic texture not heard since \\"Automatic for the People\\" hit shelves in 1992.  Even if there was a misstep here (which there isn't), it would probably pass in less than three minutes.<br /><br />All the hype is true.
B0013BNY2Q|5.0|Well, actually he does, but one would have wondered if he existed after the last couple of R.E.M. albums.    Accelerate breaks that disturbing trend. Back is Buck's jangly-riff goodness, pumped through an actual amplifier. While the CD is relatively short in length (only 35 minutes or so) it makes up for it by actually sounding like an R.E.M. album, and quite a few of the tracks are very good.    The first single, \\"Supernatural Superserious,\\" had me cautiously optimistic, since I liked the first single off of the last two albums and was completely disappointed. But the title track \\"Accelerate\\" could easily be a single itself. Even the weakest track, \\"I'm Gonna DJ,\\" isn't bad.    Stipe's lyrics aren't as good as they've been in the past, but they're not bad. And Mike Mills is outstanding on bass and backing vocals, as usual.    This is a very good album. No, it's not a classic like \\"Automatic\\" or \\"Murmur,\\" but it's miles above the band's last two efforts.
B0000DESXQ|5.0|As a devout Floyd/Waters fan I'm fed up with so called music critics constant dismissal of this album as nothing but a failed attempt at recreating `The Dark Side Of The Moon' or `The Wall'. They have so missed the point, Roger does not need to recreate passed successes as he's a very rich man who lets face it does not need to work again, he continues to do so because he is a creative genius with a gift of story telling through his music. This album needs to be listened to over and over again, I'm still discovering something new 23 years later!<br />Pros shares lyrical and musical themes to The Wall, Waters wrote and demoed the piece for the Floyd as far back as 1979, Gilmour has since commented that it \\"was more of the same\\" as 'The Final Cut' and critics claimed there were a \\"lack of tunes\\" which I find amazing. There is a running theme throughout, the same melody recurs on five tracks. Waters vocals have always come under fire, so what, he hasn't got the best voice but it is perfect for the music he writes, the shrieking and manic wails have always enhanced his more torturous songs, The Final Cut's `The Gunners Dream', The Wall's `Nobody Home' and Pro's 'Arabs With Knives'.<br /><br />With the 'Pros And Cons Of Hitchhiking' Roger Waters takes the concept album to new heights on this 1984 masterpiece, his first album after leaving Pink Floyd. The 12 songs represent scenes of a bizarre dream or nightmare, whichever way you want to visualise it. Waters brilliantly captures the strange and surreal experience of drifting in and out of a dream with periods of tranquillity and lucidity accompanied by hysterical and warped passages of confusion with moments of satire and humour. The dream has Waters confronting deadly Arabs in Germany, a steamy sexual romp in a field with a gorgeous backpacker depicted on the album cover, a crumbling and boring family life, Hell`s Angels, truckers, hamburger joints, housewives, and strangers. Waters main gift of story telling is that he draws you into his vision by blurring the scenes between real life and the sub-conscious. His use of recurring themes gives the piece consistency. As the mood swings, Clapton's guitar perfectly describes Roger's vision, whether with bursts of awe inspiring guitar solo's or delicate acoustic playing of the finest order. His playing sets the mouth watering especially on `Sexual Revolution' `For The First Time Today' and `The Pros And Cons Of Hitchhiking' Other musicians involved are virtually the same as 'The Final Cut', Katie Kissoon, Madelaine Bell and Doreen Chanter provide the female vocal harmonies that have graced all of his solo works. This album contains to me one of Roger's best songs, 'Every Strangers Eyes' has some of his best lyrics which have a typical cascade of images that depict the characters Roger is trying to portray.

0452289963|5.0|This book answers so many of our questions regarding our life's purpose and how to navigate through difficulties that we have in choosing the right path.  It gives logical reasons for our behaviours and of the behaviours of fellow man.  But more than that there is guidance to help fulfil the destiny for which we have been sent to earth.  We make so many mistakes and will continue to do so, but at least this book shows us how to make them consciously.  With this awareness comes forgiveness of ourselves and others, leading us to a purposeful life.
B0009FU0ZQ|5.0|I've read most all of Robert Parker's books, including Jesse Stone. This series of stories are adapted very nicely to film, given the time constraints. Yeah, the story-line is tailored to less than two hours and, yeah, that requires they edit out a little but, overall, the movies are all well done.<br /><br />And theres Tom Selleck. I can't think of a better fit for Jesse Stone. He captures the tired, nearly alcoholic police chief beautifully. Even just walking he seems as though there's just too much weight on his shoulders.<br /><br />Even though I gave five stars I must admit I get annoyed at times with Parker. Jesse could as easily be Spenser (or Spenser Jesse.) A sentence with more than three words would be nice once in a while. But that's me.

As I've aged I've come to think of \\"Fives Miles Out\\" and \\"Songs of the Distant Earth\\" his best works since. I've sampled his stuff since and gave this CD a try because of the reviews here.

B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I bought this set of DVD's after becoming intrigued seeing only a few episodes of the 2nd season. I wanted to see each and every one, in order. They arrived in just a few days and I immediately became hooked, watching one episode after the next.    Then horror of horrors! The second DVD in the set wouldn't work! It was somehow damaged and wouldn't play. I placed a call to Amazon, no problem, they immediatley shipped a second set without even waiting until they received the damaged one back. I received the replacement set in just a matter of days, and was able to once more sink into the deliciousness of Dexter.    I was not only very pleased with Amazon's handling of the situation, but I LOVED the DVD's and can't wait for the next season to come out. Fascinating and incredible.
B00005JKGO|3.0|In my quest to see all the great films I've missed by patronizing art houses infinitely less than I should have, \\"La Dolce Vita\\" just recently came to the top of the pile. I was still on a massive high from \\"Once Upon a Time in the West\\",  \\"Seven Samurai\\", a rewatch of \\"The Endless Summer\\" and my all-time favorite (also Bruce Brown) \\"On Any Sunday\\" which I watch at least 3-4 times a year. I was LDV's to throw away....<br /><br />I think I \\"get\\" the movie... Marcello lives amongst the \\"look at me\\" crew as a paparazzi and is silently swallowed by their world. In scene after scene, with the exception of his meeting Paola in the quiet little cafe, he descends from being merely a shallow loser to being something worse than that... the kind of evil butt-hole that's too far gone to ever be redeemed.<br /><br />So I got that... Fellini drove it home through hours of beautifully photographed scenes of easily-bored pretty shiny losers and heavy-handed symbolism... that being a pretty shiny loser is a hollow, unrewarding, waste of your life... duh. All seemingly just to set up a brief ending scene with Paola again... that's about as subtle as Laugh-In's bucket of water.. that if you're a jerk for too long, you just ain't getting back. My first words after putting my time in to this famous piece of cinematic history were \\"That's IT?\\".<br /><br />I researched the film more... trying to understand what I was missing. It had to be me because this film has enormous cachet as a film. But the more I read, the more it was cemented for me that the target audience for this was solely the \\"film elite\\"... people who could appreciate film on the mere basis of clever structure and symbolism. It felt like one of the 70's sound effects records targeted at the audiophiles who don't care what the musical performance is like... just how the sound is.. that you can sense the \\"sound stage\\" and pick up the drummer is also tapping his foot, whether he's playing something great or just a piece of utter musical crap. I used to be one of those guys, so I know I \\"get\\" that..<br /><br />If I had to compare LDV to a recent film, it would be The Aristocrats... or perhaps more accurately, to the joke itself. The greatest practitioners of it are those who immerse in and innovate on the nuance of the setup... who can appreciate pushing the length and complexity of the setup to someplace absurd to most people. But I'd say those practitioners are appreciating something removed from the joke itself. They see it as insiders do.

B0010ZR160|4.0|**** 2007. This film, based on Dennis Lehane's [[ASIN:0380730359 Gone, Baby, Gone: A Novel]] was written for the screen and directed by Ben Affleck. One nomination for the Oscars and the Golden Globes (Amy Ryan). A couple of private detectives is hired by the uncle of a little girl who disappeared without leaving a trace. Great directorial debut from the co-author of [[ASIN:6305216088 Good Will Hunting (Miramax Collector's Series)]]. The movie asks a very interesting question about Morals and legal ethics. Up to where are you ready to go if you know you're right? Highly recommended.
0060920084|5.0|Bryson, an American who has lived for many years in England, sets out alone, in a Chevette! (maybe he should have taken a Camry), from his mother's house in Des Moines to re-live the family vacation car trips of his youth and search for the perfect small town. He travels through thirty-something states and finds a lot of nice, dotty people and endearing tackiness. As the Russian comedian Yakov Smirnoff is fond of saying, \\"What a country!\\" I've spent a lot of time on the same by-ways, and drawn similar conclusions. Always perceptive and entertaining, often offensive, and a lot of good laughs.
1881273989|2.0|Okay first of all, I read this entire book in about 3 hours. This was part of a study we were doing at a bible study group; and I have to say I'm cynical about this book even from a Christian's perspective.    First, take a look at the cover. See those ridiculously happy nicely dressed perfect looking people? Well if you're not one of them, this book isn't for you. It's full of superficial and contrived mini-stories. To me  they just don't seem to fit in with real life situations that people have with all the hurting and complicated lives we go through. The stories remind me of those how-to educational films from the 40's     The basic message of the book is this: learn what makes people in your life feel loved, follow the golden rule, etc. etc. It's pretty much intuition. I don't think however that it will lead to some miraculous change in how you deal with people nor will it do anything to help you establish new relationships.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Honestly, words cannot say how much more I love this controller compared to the Sixaxis wireless controller for the PS3. I actually got my DualShock 3 imported from Japan back in February and have used it all the time on my PS3. I have only played with the Dual Shock for PS2 and PS1 games though and not PS3 games yet since I only have 2 games that do not support rumble for the system. I can say that the Rumbling feature is 100% the same as the Dual Shock 2 for the PS2!     First off, the weight difference is significant compared to the Sixaxis. You can tell no doubt which controller is which once you pick up both a Sixaxis and Dual Shock 3.    Second, they now have 3 different colors for the controller which is pretty sweet cause now you can buy the controller in Silver, Black, and White.    Now, to review on the rumbling itself, well, IT'S AWESOME!!! It's 100% accurate once something happens in a game where the controller is supposed to rumble and it gives you that feeling of awesomeness when playing games that have the rumble feature.    The ONLY con I have to say about this controller is that sometimes it can drain the battery a bit quickly, but hey, I would take this controller 100 times as much compared to the Sixaxis.    Overall, no doubt this product deserves 100 stars, but I can only give it 5.
B0013D8LOK|1.0|I hated the color, everyone was so dully and dimly lit it was painful to watch. And when they were talking you couldn't hear a word they were saying, but then they'd start singing and it'd burst your eardrums. The plot wasn't bad, and the acting was interesting - although except for the singing neither of the roles was much of a stretch for Depp or Carter. I love Alan Rickman, so enjoyed his presence in the film.  I am so sick of the dark circles under the eyes in Burton's movies.

B000UBMSB8|5.0|I've just watched the new edition of Blade Runner and feel like saying a few words on the film. Why review a 25 year old film? For the same reason it's been reissued. It's a pretty important film.<br /><br />What I have to say fits under three headings.<br /><br />1. Plot<br />You know the story. Dangerous criminals are on the streets of LA and only one man can stop them. Several chase scenes and a few fights later, he does, rescuing a beautiful girl in the process. It's a basic thriller plot, used in hundreds of films for a very good reason. It works. It's got very little to do with the Philip K Dick book the script is ostensibly based on. The only thing worth saying about this aspect of the film is that it's very well done and makes for great entertainment. Think 'Total Recall'. Remember it's the plot I'm talking about here. Score 8/10.<br /><br />2. The Setting<br />Everything to do with the look of the film: sets, costumes, artifacts, design, lighting and camera are incredibly well done and make this film one of the most influential ever made. Not necessarily original, but influential nevertheless. Here we get a taste of the world Dick made, where technology has developed fangs and claws and makes life difficult for the people it's supposed to help. It's a believable future and we're half fascinated, half repelled by its depiction. The detail is astonishing and the production interacts very effectively. This is why we remember the film. It's Armageddon with a cobra stare we can't turn away from.  Score 10/10.<br /><br />3. The Themes<br />The film is loosely based on the Philip K Dick book 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep'. Dick is a major novelist with a lot of very important things to tell us if only we could forget he was a science fiction writer and listen. Dick's world is consistently one in which machines have demonstrated they have no humanity even should they be simulacra. The book is full of astonishing concepts that the film has ditched to make room for the chase scenes and perhaps that's unavoidable. But considerable play is made in the film on the nature of the android/replicant characters. Much ink has been spilt determining who is or is not an android/replicant among the major characters. Ridley Scott has emphasised Deckard's replicant nature when he remade the film (Director's Cut). But the physical nature of these characters is relatively unimportant. Dick's theme, carried over to the film, is: what is human? In a world where a replicant can only be discovered by means of an intricate psychological test, and real humans are behaving more and more like machines, the meaning and value of 'human' becomes important to define. Humans are not automatically humane, just as replicants are not automatically automata. The film emphasises this by showing the  only characters who act with humanity to be replicants. It's not profound but it's moving. Score 9/10 (loses a point for leaving out so much of the book).<br /><br />The Edition<br />The choice is a 5 disc, 4 disc, Final Cut or Director's cut edition. If you're a fan you've already got the 5 disc edition. If you're studying film you'll buy the 5 disc edition for the workprint and the rare chance to see how the film was shaped and adapted through the production process. In my view the Final Cut, though beautiful to look at, was not worth the effort. My choice was the 4 disc edition, which contains all the fabulous extras and my preferred edition, the original theatrical release, which stays a tad closer to Dick's vision than the Director's Cut. And it's the best value for money as well.<br /><br />There's so much more to say but I'll just go and watch the film again.avoidable.

0061142026|4.0|Stardust is somewhat unusual for Gaiman: the steampunk/techno-travesty universe stays away.  He still uses his standard plot, where someone from our world -- surprise! -- blunders into another, intersecting dimension of reality.  However, this time the other world is a fairy kingdom, and a fairy kingdom in the traditional sense.<br /><br />This isn't Disney's fairy utopia.  This is more along the lines of the traditional Brothers Grimm.  There's a fallen star who is, of course, stunning and magical, but everyone is out to brutally murder her.  Fortunately, they're also out to murder each other in the hopes of getting to the star first, or this would be a very short book.<br /><br />I was charmed and entertained.  The main characters, like the typical fairy-syory protagonists, are often (usually? almost always?) dense to the point of pain, but it is a mark of Gaiman's talent that he makes that irritating quirk add to their personality. The plot developments are usually visible from about 6 miles away, but that added to the fairy-tale mood.  (Come on.  Who's surprised by the ending of fairy tales?)<br />As with most of Gaiman's books, the very best parts are the ideas.  Those, \\"whoa! That's the coolest interpretation of _______ I've ever heard!\\" moments make the book.<br /><br />It's a great beach book, and a very fast read (got through it waiting for a train).  Don't expect a perspecvtive-altering, life-changing phenomenon, but it's a good read.

B000OVLBGC|5.0|My girlfriend is German and i speak some German so we heard about this movie and decided to buy it.  Great movie and it earned an Oscar us.imdb.com/title/tt0405094/awards .  the movie shows how controlling the East Germans were over their people and how they achieved that control.  might be too artsy a movie for some that may prefer Jim Carey/Adam Sandler movies which i ABSOLUTELY LOVE.  my favorite genre is Comedy, funny enough.  still this movie is thought provoking and shows you how much bureaucracy it takes for a government to keep their people down. everything can be stifled especially the arts, music and movies specifically.  Bottom line, good movie whether you speak (or are) German, but resonates more if you do or are.
B000MNP2KI|1.0|This is the Worst Bond movie ever. Bond just received his license to kill, which means he is in his early career year. But the storyline is after 911.

It may rush some of the story lines but when they decided to stop making the show they had to tidy it all up somehow.

The characters continue with their own personal stories, and the long hair on Sam Carter works surprisingly well.   It is about time that the ancients get involved in the Ori war.
B00005JPTK|5.0|I am a fan of Will Smith, I enjoy watching his movies and generally speaking they never disappoint me, and to an extent I even enjoy some of his music (mostly just the songs he's done for the various movies he's starred in). When the initial posters for \\"I Am Legend\\" arrived in theaters and listed the name Will Smith I was already psyched to see it, even though based on the posters I thought the name was the way too long \\"The Last Man on Earth is Not Alone\\", but it turned out that was just the tagline, but I still maintain that was a strange marketing strategy by not making the film's title readily visible. Anyways, when the trailers began showing up on the internet and on television I became even more pumped for the movie because it just looked really interesting and cool, and I was intrigued by the fact that based on the previews I still had no clue what exactly Will's character was up against, only that he was the last surviving member of humanity (to his knowledge) and he's fighting for survival against some monstrous person or group of people. So, the movie was released to theaters, I didn't go see it, go figure since I don't see a whole lot of films at the theaters these days, partly because of time and the other is the ever-increasing cost of ticket prices, I just find it easier to wait the extra few months for the DVD release and watch it on my widescreen TV in the comfort of my own home. Finally, it was released to DVD, and after all the various criticisms I had heard, along with some praise, though it seemed like not as many people liked the movie compared to those that disliked it to some degree or just flat-out hated it; I was still interested in seeing the movie and I must say I was not disappointed in the least.    \\"I Am Legend\\" takes place in the year 2012, as mankind has been essentially wiped out by a deadly virus meant to cure cancer. In place of mankind are these monstrous, mutated beings who are similar to vampires due to their affinity for darkness, sensitivity to light, their attraction to blood, and because they can infect others with their `vampirism' as it were; however, they are not vampires or even zombies for that matter, they are merely mutated and diseased humans who have taken over New York City and possibly the rest of the world. At night they are in charge, but during the day one lone man prowls the streets, Robert Neville (Will Smith) who along with his trusty German Shepherd, Sam, has NYC all to themselves. Robert is a former military virologist who is trying desperately to develop a cure for the disease that he is somehow immune to, while at the same time trying to keep his sanity and hold onto some small sliver of hope that there may possibly be other human survivors out there waiting to be found.    After watching \\"I Am Legend\\" I can see why some people may have not liked the movie as much as most of Will Smith's previous efforts, because prior to its release no one really knew what to expect from the movie. So, the fact that essentially 85% percent of the movie consists of either Will Smith on screen by himself or with his dog, and no one else to really interact with, could really turn some people off to the overall experience of the movie. In my case, I knew what to expect going into watching the movie, so Will Smith having to act by himself on screen a majority of the time didn't bother me at all, and I was truly impressed by how good he did and just how captivating he made the character of Robert. I believe that even if I hadn't known what to expect in terms of whether there would be other actors featured prominently or just having Will by himself for a majority of the film, I still would have enjoyed the movie all the same.    The story for \\"I Am Legend\\" is very well-paced and well-written by screenwriters Mark Protosevich (\\"Poseidon\\") and Akiva Goldsman (\\"I, Robot\\") based on a novel by Richard Matheson. They imbue the story with such heart, intense drama, and a tense, eerie atmosphere that you are instantly drawn into the plight of this lone man roaming the streets searching for a way to survive and to fix past mistakes, and in the end cure the disease that has ravaged the world. I appreciated the way the writers tried to show Robert's mental state as being somewhat disconnected from reality, by having him set up mannequins throughout the city for him to interact with as if they were real people. Also, the connection between Robert and his dog Sam was very genuine and natural, serving as an almost bittersweet connection to Robert's past and the family that he's lost along the way. Many people praised Will Smith for his powerful performance in this movie given the challenge of having to act by himself, and he is completely deserving of any praise he receives for his work here, but by the same token, I would think some praise should go to the writers for being able to craft such an engaging story focusing on one man and his dog, without really being able to rely on dialogue or any kind of interaction with other characters. This is a brilliant job on behalf of the writers and even the novelist, for being able to keep an audiences' attention every step of the way without the usual tools at their disposal for propelling a story onward.    From an acting standpoint, there is really only one person to talk about and that's Will Smith, and as I've alluded to somewhat already he did an exemplary job with the role of Robert Neville. Will is a magnetic presence onscreen in every movie I've seen him in, but normally he's able to play off of other actors in the scene, but here he's pretty much on his own or with a dog, aside from a few key flashbacks that shed some light on his previous life before the virus struck, so his ability is definitely worthy of praise. An incredible performance for Will, and one that I'm sure wasn't nearly as easy as some of his other past performances might have been, but he handled the isolation onscreen very well, and conveyedthe characters deep sense of loss in a way that was very natural yet didn't make the character seem suicidal or depressed, which would have most likely not played well with most audiences, just desperate which was very appropriate for the circumstances Robert has found himself in.    \\"I Am Legend\\" is a very entertaining movie that remains engaging from start to finish even though the focus is primarily on Will Smith and his dog, and not much else. Director Francis Lawrence (\\"Constantine\\") has really knocked it out of the park with this movie; he's definitely come along way from shooting music videos for MTV. Some have likened this movie to Tom Hanks' survivalist film \\"Castaway\\" due to his character being alone on an island except for a volleyball named Wilson as a companion. I can see the similarity between the two movies in that both movies featured a lead actor who was forced to act by himself for a majority of the film, but that's pretty much where the similarities end. Unlike \\"Castaway\\" which was a good movie, but not great, I feel \\"I Am Legend\\" is a great movie and one I will watch more than once. This movie isn't for everybody, but if you kind of know what you're going into prior to seeing the movie, you may end up enjoying it more, no guarantees though.    \\"I Am Legend\\" is rated PG-13 for violence and disturbing images.
0812975219|5.0|This book is one of a kind. It is a thought-provoking essay that presents the author's philosophical views on randomness, which originates from his long-time experience as a trader and from his vast knowledge of the western philosophical tradition.      I think the book is wonderfully written, although I understand some reviewers' comments about the arrogant style. There is actually some self-sufficiency in Taleb's writing, but I think it actually gives the book a very special ironic and personal touch: you can feel there is an author there, he is not trying to be neutral. I ended up loving it and asking for more. I have also read The Black Swan, but I must say that Fooled by Randomness is the first I read and the one that caused me the greatest impact.
B000002UA2|5.0|This is the last album before Dark Side of The Moon and the last soundtrack that they had made. It's often unfairly overlooked because Dark Side of The Moon came next and....well you know the whole story with Dark Side of The Moon. But this album should be given greater credit than it is given. The band finally get to grips with the machines that they had been trying to mastering since 1967....and while those albums are brilliant in their own way, they still gave you the feeling that they were haunted by Syd, musically. They always were haunted by Syd of course, but pre-Dark Side seemed to show it even more. It was only by the time Meddle had arrived that they were beginning to shift musically and were beginning a more settled patch.    From the start of the album, the album sees a band more confident in their abilities. The songwriting is more assured although perhaps missing some of the quirks that made some of their earlier albums a bit more fun ( I use that term loosely, some people might not see it ). But the quality of the music cannot be faulted.....as I've said it is more assured, more powerful and while not quite forceful, it certainly doesn't descend into mania like what would've happened earlier. It's the first time where you really sense they've learned to control themselves without hampering the music. It's also quite pastoral too which is quite welcome.    Having said all this, it still strikes me as an odd album for a soundtrack because if you take away the fact that it was a soundtrack this would be a very decent rock album. Having seen the film, it underused many of the tracks and does the music a disservice I feel. But then that's not the point really is it? The film's not much really....but it would be a crime to forget about this album because it's not Dark Side of The Moon or it was the one before. If you want the big picture you've got to look at the finer details that went on beforehand.
B000NVIXFK|3.0|I have owned every one of Rush's cd's- I liked this more than Test For Echo and Vapor Trails but not as much as others.    Some very very good songs (the instrumentals and leading track \\"Far Cry\\") but others I don't care for at all.
B000001FMX|4.0|I must admit I have not bought either of the Dolls records on CD. My vinyl copies sound just fine thank you. But just who's idea was it to wrestle Todd Rundgren into producing what could have been what everyone else is talking about here. I have never heard Todd's name mentioned with the word punk in the same sentence. It never should have been mentioned with the Dolls. Whoever was responsible shoud be exposed. Who was it? Who did it? All the great early songs are right here, but where is David? The instruments sound punchy and great, but where is David? He is mixed down to the point of almost just being another instument in the band. This should not have happened, not with these guys. When I listen to the dolls I want to literally see Johansen's tongue lashing at me through the speakers. I would love to give this thing 5 stars. It would be in my top ten but with an asterisk next to it like Mark Mcguire would have if he ever made the Hall which I hope he never does. Being Shangra-Las fans, I'm sure it was the band who chose Shadow Morton to produce the bands official swan song Too Much Too Soon. Thank god he chose to shed his Specteresque side and came away a winner. The material is a bit weaker but it really rocks and is a much superior sounding record. When they decide to re-master the first one for CD I'll be the first one on line. All this crappola aside, you should get this cause you need it.

0385338082|3.0|Junie B. Jones is an extremely silly 1st grade fictional girl who narrates her way through a series of popular and easy to read chapter books written for 5-7 year olds. One of the many silly, albeit age appropriate things that Junie B. does is she crosses her fingers behind her back every time she tells a fib. Emma Corrigan on the other hand is an extremely annoying, silly, fictional twenty-five year old who narrates her way through this, Bridget Jones wanna-be, book. Among many childish things that Emma does, she also crosses her fingers behind her back every time she tells a fib.  In fact, she could be the grown up (sort-of) version of Junie B. Jones.<br /><br />Overall, I was not impressed.  When I saw this book at the library, I noticed the authors name and I recognized it from her \\"Confessions of a Shopaholic\\" series, which I've never read.  It looked like the perfect pick since I was looking for something different, something fun and something light to read.  What I got was a book full of unlikable over exaggerated characters, a dim-witted and unlikely plot and sorry to say, but a stupid ending.<br /><br />I will not read anymore of this authors work. To appreciate this type of novel, maybe you have to be in that twenty something demographic, maybe you have to really enjoy super light reading, maybe you have to have an exaggerated desire for extreme romantic silliness.  Obviously, by the number of five star ratings this book has received, this author certainly is well liked, and although I have enjoyed reading through the Junie B. Jones series with young kids, this style of adult writing is just not for me.<br /><br />2 1/2 stars
B000E6UWE4|1.0|This is a perfect example of \\"Don't judge a book by its cover.\\" The cover was the only thing good about this book. Many people put Erikson in the top ten fantasy writers.  I just couldn't get into this book. I was confused from page one and my confusion simply continued. I had no idea what was going on, or what the plot was and after 100 pages, I gave up. He describes scenes and skips over to other things making the reading convoluted. I think he does have promise as a writer, I just wish he could focus on a few characters and tell a story worth telling.  His writing style reminds me of Glen Cook, another horrid writer who loves to skip around the world with godlike mages and world destroying magic with zero character development and a writing style like reading random thoughts from the scattered brain of someone with ADHD! Glen Cook wrote his books in between five minute breaks on an assembly line in a detroit car factory. It reads like that as well, as does Ericksons work.And if you see his videos on you tube he even admits that he can't keep track of everything in his world. He and a friend would sit and do one on one roleplay sessions with each other to get the story for each bit part. The problem is there are HUNDREDS of bit parts.This would be a novel idea if you would just focus on one or two characters and finish a story.<br />There are some good things about Eriksons style that I have to give him credit for:<br />Great Worldbuilding- Detailed world with interesting ideas<br />Awesome descriptions- his visual style is excellent<br />Characters that could be interesting if they were developed more.<br />The reason I couldn't get into this world is the characters are all over the place and there are far too many of them. Imagine 100 pages of describing different scenes and characters but not continuing the story with any one set of characters at a time. One chapter will have four or five characters on a battlement, then the next one will have ten new characters somewhere else and 2 characters in another country five to ten years in the future Yes he jumps through time in his book sometimes in the middle of a chapter?!. It's confusing as hell. Reading George RR Martin was easier he  breaks chapters into each characters point of view so it flows more and the secondary characters are easier to remember. Maybe if he would have changed his POV the book might have been more readable.2 characters in another country five to ten years in the future Yes he jumps through time in his book sometimes in the middle of a chapter?!.

B0010YSD7M|5.0|If you loved the television series as I did, you are going to love Stargate-The Ark of Truth.  It not only ties together the entire story line from season 10, but does it in a way that makes one wonder what could have been done on television if they had the time and money they put into this movie.  You will not be disappointed and may end up looking to the next installment as I am in the continuing adventures of Stargate SG-1.

After having this book recommended to me by several Wilbur Smith fans I found the time to read it. I am glad I did. It is a long book but Wilbur can sure transport you back in time to another world. Well worth reading.
B00011CZRE|4.0|With the likes of SAW, HOSTEL, and other recent \\"torture\\" horror films, the visceral moments in SE7EN seem a little tamer now. This is, by the way, not to say that SE7EN falls in that exploitative genre. Rather, SE7EN is a taut and frightening psychological thriller, which also happens to be intelligent and articulate. In its sensibilities, this film is actually closer to [[ASIN:B000LP6KNU The Silence of the Lambs (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)]]. And the knockout acting doesn't exactly hurt.<br /><br />In an anonymous city reeking of gloom and corruptness, a serial killer makes his opening move, as he tortures and murders a gluttonous man. Veteran Homicide Detective William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) lands the case, but being mere days away from retirement, wants no part of it, intuiting that this one has the potential to be very, very ugly and messy. It soon becomes disturbingly clear that the killer is using the theme of the seven deadly sins to frame his gruesome murders. And, contrary to his instincts, the reluctant Somerset finds himself being drawn into the case and incidentally into mentoring fledgling Homicide Detective (and his eventual replacement) David Mills (Brad Pitt). But even Somerset's long experience in the field and Mills' enthusiasm won't prepare them for the shocking depravity and grisly inventiveness of this driven, demented killer. As Somerset warns his young partner, \\"You know this isn't gonna have a happy ending.\\" And it doesn't.<br /><br />SE7EN, coming out in 1995, is intense and it's relentlessly dark - dark in its cinematic look and in its estimation of the human condition. Not only is the killer steeped in his grim, homicidal philosophies, but the film also showcases a protagonist whose cynicism and world-weariness are empathically conveyed. In such morbid light, the film's only sweet ray of sunshine, which is Gwyneth Paltrow's Tracy (Mill's wife), doesn't even come close to making a dent in the pervading bleakness. And, in this unnamed city, it seems to be always drizzling. SE7EN is filmed in a gritty style, with the interiors mostly shot in gloomy and cramped quarters, which builds on that claustrophobic atmosphere. The murders themselves are baroque and explicit, scoring well on the gross out scale. The victims of gluttony and sloth are particularly chilling.<br /><br />Although a gripping thriller, it's not really that action-packed. There's one extended chase scene, but, else, the film focuses on the detectives' cerebral pursuit of clues. This also leaves ample opportunity for the two leads to interact and flex their acting muscles. Morgan Freeman, universally regarded as one hell of an actor, is again pitch perfect. His character of William Somerset, reserved, meticulous yet intuitive, contrasts nicely with Pitt's brash, impetuous, and rumpled-wardrobed David Mills. I'm thinking it was probably around this time that Brad Pitt began to be recognized as an actual actor, and beyond his studly looks. His very next film, [[ASIN:B0007PALZ2 12 Monkeys (Special Edition)]], would garner him an Oscar nomination. But, here, Pitt benefits tremendously from being partnered with the low-key yet magnetic Morgan Freeman. As always, it's a real pleasure watching Mr. Freeman do justice to his scenes and to his dialogue. And, even when not reciting his lines, he continues to exude this quiet, commanding presence. I've always loved Morgan Freeman, as far back as when I first saw him in [[ASIN:B000051YMQ Glory (Special Edition)]].<br /><br />There's another topnotch actor here, and that's Kevin Spacey, who turns in another eerie and effective performance as the creepy madman, John Doe. When he makes his speech near the end, as he strives to justify his actions to Somerset and Mills, he's convincing enough that there's a half-stutter of a second where you actually think he's making sense. Meanwhile, Gwyneth Paltrow isn't in this one a lot, but she lights up the screen whenever she is. Too, her role becomes very critical to the film's resolution.<br /><br />Let's be clear about this, the two detectives, dogged and clever as they may be, are still no match for John Doe. Most of the film has them reacting and running in circles, and even reduced to deciphering the works of Chaucer and Dante (Somerset reads the real stuff, Mills gets his hands on the Cliff Notes). SE7EN tantalizes you with just how devious and creative and ruthless the killer is, and with how desperate and behind the game the detectives really are. Even when Somerset's wild hunch pays off - a hunch hinging on the FBI's keeping tabs on library systems - it's such an unbelievably long shot that you shake your head at the far-fetchedness of it all. It does pay off, but then John Doe still manages to get away (and simultaneously beat the snot out of Mills). When the bad guy is at last apprehended, it's not any of Somerset and Mills's doing as much as John Doe allowing himself to be captured, but for his own very sick reasons. The only negative I can come up with for this film is that I did expect more of the ending, which seemed a bit abrupt and almost anticlimactic. There's a twist at the end, yes, which is suppposed to be shocking. But this twist didn't shock as much as sadden me. In the end SE7EN manages to cling fast to its dark sentiments, leaving its audience as tired and jaded as its world-weary protagonist. This is an excellent movie, but now I'm in search of a shower and ice cream and a sunny beach with volleyball and beautiful women, and maybe a hug from my folks. Just to remind me that there are still the good things in life.ritical to the film's resolution.<br /><br />Let's be clear about this, the two detectives, dogged and clever as they may be, are still no match for John Doe.

055358202X|4.0|I love the way George RR Martin writes. I love Westeros. I love it like a heroin addict loves his fix. I've read each of his books nine times, and I have the Audio versions also. But this book was fluff. The Brienne chapters were a waste of time. I guess he wrote them to visualize what the land was like after the war of three kings. Violent. The brienne chapters were interesting but they didn't accomplish anything in the way of the story. The Sam chapters were also pretty lame. Arya's chapters were interesting, but could have been omitted.  Cersei's chapters were interesting, as were Jamies and moved the plot forward but they could have finished them in three chapters. If he wanted to focus on minor characters he should have focused on Ramsey Bolton, Bronn, Sandor Clegane or maybe members of the Golden Company. The Ironborn chapters were the most interesting. All of the really good characters are missing in this book. He is moving dangerously close to writing himself into the ground like Jordan did in wheel of time! I just wish he would cut the dead weight and finish the story. So he can write some more stories about even more interesting heroes. I did enjoy reading this book, and I don't mean to be hard on George but I really missed my favorite characters !<br />I gave this book 3 stars initially.<br />Five years later: After my initial reading of this book and being a bit annoyed. I reread it again and again. I have grown to like Jaime and Sam. Brienne has grown on me, but in reality it was her who changed Jamie and made him want to be more like Arthur Dayne again. I'm curious to see how his story will pan out. The descriptions in this book as with all of Martin's work is excellent and his worldbuilding is incredible. George is a master of showing and not telling through characterization. Cersei is incredibly annoying and paranoid and reminds me of a female Aerys Targaryen. She needs to die a horrific death, probably by Jamies hands. Some interesting things happen in this book mostly thanks to Cersei's lack of common sense and paranoia. The rise of the church Knights and pretty much destroying every ally she possibly can with her shrewlike evil. She's bringing House Lannister down into oblivion one move at a time. She pisses of the Tyrells, The Iron bank of Braavos, ALL of her relatives and Jaimie. Everyone is at war in this book and Westeros in flames from The reach to the wall, Only Dorne remains unscathed. The Ironborn invade and make a mess of everything. CHAOS! Enjoy!book mostly thanks to Cersei's lack of common sense and paranoia.

B000002UC5|5.0|Great minimalistic approach from paul - fun disc with great memories attached for me - the measure of music for most people!      I enjoyed this solo album for its simple pleasures - has some nice stuff on it and is refreshingly minimalistic in its approach to some classic writing by paul.  it sort of balances \\"Band on the Run\\" and \\"Venus and Mars\\" type studio productions.  I think of it as a close and personal type statement about paul's more happy and free time in his professional and personal lives!  these moments come infrequently to us all and i am happy paul captured this time-capsule of his life for us to share and remember moments like these we all cherish!  nothing simpler and sweeter than a bowl full of cherries that are so happy they jump out of the bowl and all over the table in celebratory jubilant dance of joy!  ;-)  can't wait for the next bout of this type of simple pleasure-cycle to come round again!  hope the same for y'all!

0151013837|3.0|Have you ever been watching a drama on TV and half-way through the season it switches to a comedy, complete with laugh track?  Or reading a scientific text on the lifestyle of gorillas that suddenly morphed into British Chick Lit?  Did you enjoy that?  If so, you'll enjoy this book.<br /><br />Life of Pi is wonderfully written.  Martel elegantly captures the twists and turns of his character's mind, and exquisitely describes his world, particularly as it relates to the animals.  It feels as if Martel's spent thousands of hours sitting and observing various animals, just as his character did.  I had no doubt that I was there in the zoo with Pi, watching the animals.  His intricate details on marine life were both accurate and enthralling.  Truly Martel knows how to create. I also appreciate how Martel plays with the line between fiction and nonfiction in the beginning of the book, to bring us into a netherworld of reality.  And the illustrations- Oh!  So beautiful they could be paintings in the middle of the book.<br /><br />And yet.  And yet.  I was profoundly disappointed with this work.  For I was gripped in the middle of a fascinating story- fiction to be sure, but believable- that suddenly changed into magical realism.  Don't misunderstand- I enjoy magical realism, much as I enjoy good comedies on TV.  I just don't like my genres mixed.  The change was abrupt enough to be jarring, but hidden enough that the reader is at a loss to understand what has happened until many pages later.  Thus at one point I am thinking that Pi is suffering from dementia, and I begin skimming the pages, only to discover later that the dementia- as fantastic as the events seem- is meant to be reality.  Or are they?  Later Martel plays with an idea little better than the [[ASIN:B001C9S0F0 Dallas]] dream retcon, in which a wonderful realistic story of a boy lost at sea with animals becomes something horrific worthy of Stephen King.<br /><br />The descriptions were wonderful but Martel has great difficulty in describing settings.  I still don't understand the layout of the lifeboat and lifebuoy, because no matter how many times I went over it, it didn't make sense.  The illustrations were wonderful but they too often telegraphed events.  We have a chapter of an individual being rescued, mentioned by name, and it is clear that the author intends us to think this individual is human.  But the picture on the very same page shows a tiger being rescued in the middle of the ocean.  The religious subtext was interesting, but ultimately a red herring that didn't illuminate the finale, and was frankly insulting to numerous religions with the caricatures and stereotypes of the worst of them.<br /><br />There was so much in this book that I enjoyed.  Had it not been for the twist gotcha ending I would have rated it higher.  As it is, it felt like this was a failed writing exercise by an excellent writer.  Or in Yann Martel's words, \\"Your theme is good, as are your sentences.  Your characters are so ruddy with life they practically need birth certificates.  The plot you've mapped out for them is grand, simple and gripping.  You've done your research, gathering the facts - historical, social, climatic, culinary - that will give your story its feel of authenticity.  The dialogue zips along, crackling with tension.  The descriptions burst with colour, contrast and telling detail.  Really, your story can only be great.  But it all adds up to nothing.\\"  In this case, it was not a missing spark of emotional death- it was a cruel cancer spreading throughout the work, only revealed in the last few pages.scribing settings.

0374280967|5.0|It's good to be Queen, but it does have its drawbacks -- long periods of tedium in slow-moving vehicles, a relentless round of ceremonial duties, and a bird's eye view of everyday life. What better solution to these drawbacks than the pages of a good book?<br /><br />[[ASIN:0374280967 The Uncommon Reader: A Novella]] is a quirky little book about Queen Elizabeth II and her discovery of the joys of reading. Pursuing her yapping corgis through the grounds of Windsor Castle, she ends up in the library bookmobile and checks out a book to be polite. From this beginning, guided by kitchen hand-turned-equerry Norman Seakins, she is soon deep in the world of books.<br /><br />This new habit of hers is unpopular with the people around her. She's becoming too \\"remote,\\" they say; Alzheimer's is suggested. Her punctuality and attention to formal routine are slipping. Norman is spirited away from her staff but she keeps reading.<br /><br />Author Alan Bennett packs a lot into this compact book. Through all the palace intrigue, Mad Hatter's tea parties, and hilarious references to writers old and new, the queen keeps reading. Her point of view widens exponentially and she begins making notes -- and then writing more seriously.<br /><br />There's a little treasure around every corner in this wry book. The final scene is pure theater of the absurd, and the final paragraph will probably make you laugh out loud. Highly recommended.<br /><br />Linda Bulger, 2008
0307387178|4.0|I recently saw the movie on an airplane and had never heard of the story.  I could not get this young man out of my mind.  I was then on Amazon and saw there was a book, ordered it, and have finished reading it.  I am still so saddened that Chris didnt live.  As a mother of three children 8,11, 12 1/2 I only hope that open communication remains a part of our lives as they grow up.  We have had 3 deaths in our family since July and my Father before that, so I can only stress to kids like Chris and parents for that matter to keep talking to one another!!!!  This was a tragedy that did not have to happen.  I commend Chris for what he was trying to do, and believe after reading the book that he was ready to come out and try to live a normal life, just made one final mistake.

0465043550|2.0|Mandelbrot & Hudson attack some popular thoughts on how financial markets work and try to set up a model to replace them.    There are two main focuses of attacks: that returns follow a normal or Gaussian distribution and that future returns are independent of past returns.  The attacks are effective - the authors show that these are false and therefore any existing model based on them is doomed.    Next, the authors try to argue that returns follow a \\"multifractal\\" - a fractal both in value and a fractal in time.  Using this model, they can create pictures of financial returns that are difficult for people to differentiate from real financial returns.    If the pictures were easily distinguishable, it would disprove their model.  However, the converse is not true.  Just because the pictures are indistinguishable, it does not mean that the model is correct.  In fact, the authors are hard pressed to tell the reader how to build a model for a particular financial market and show zero results in using the model to predict a financial market (which is the true measure of the value of a model).    To conclude, the book does a good job of dispelling some myths.  However, it's argument for multifractals is that they are worthy of consideration of future research.  And given that they cannot even show how to build a multifractal to model a particular market, it is doubtful that they are worth considering at all.
B000P12LWY|5.0|I'm an Anglophle, and I was excited when I heard of this series.  I don't have Showtime, so I had no exposure to the show as it ran its first season, so when the DVD's came out, I was ready to rush off and purchase them -- but first I read the reviews.  They seemed to praise (great production values!) and pan (ah, the history!) the program in equal measure.  So I figured, \\"Well, some of the reviews are positive, and it's only $25, so why not find out for myself?\\"  I went ahead and bought them, and I've watched them.  Here's what I think you should do about them.<br /><br />If you are a history buff who cannot abide such royalty productions of the nature of as Elizabeth and The Golden Age with Cate Blanchett, then consider avoiding these shows.  They are not historical gospel.  They're not even a historical prayer book or historical hymn.  They're pretty much historical soap opera that takes extraordinary liberties with \\"the truth.\\"  Such liberties can offend the serious scholar.  So, quite simply, if you're a serious scholar, save your nitroglycerin pill, and go for one of the highly regarded film histories on the market.<br /><br />However, if you're either a casual royalty buff or a film scholar, then I think you'd get a kick out of these DVD's.  The shows are gorgeously photographed.  The cast is unilaterally compelling; I am unfamiliar with these actors, and yet, I can't take my eyes off of them, especially Maria Doyle Kennedy (Queen Catherine) and the actor who plays the Duke of Suffolk (too bad he's too young for me!).  Gabrielle Anwar, as Henry's sister Margaret, is not only surpassingly beautiful but has an authentic comedic flair.<br /><br />Now, I will confess that I was rather shortsighted not to realize that as a Showtime production, there's plenty of nudity and bad langauge in these shows.  Fortunately, after the first few episodes, the producers seem to begin trusting the integrity of the production over a parade body parts to engage the audience -- not that the show would earn even a PG-13 rating in later episodes, but by later episodes the nudity and vocabulary begin to serve the story rather than serve to garner an audience.<br /><br />I did agree with the person who noted that the actual story of Henry VIII would play equally well if not better than this rather invented history; the recreational viewer won't know where to draw a line between truth and fantasy.  However, maybe this show could provoke a few people to research the history, and in the meantime, it's a fascinating and well designed program.<br /><br />So who should buy these DVD's?

B00132D808|4.0|FINALLY! I would never have even touched the disc until I heard fans of the first album saying it was too different. The only thing I'll ding it for is for holding on a LITTLE to tightly to the Beatles. It's a bit of a Rubber Soul - Sgt Pepper rip off but hey it's a step in the right direction. Funky lyrics and great music. It's an aquired taste so if you like Beatlesesque music but want something a tad on the new side this is a pretty album.

B00003CX5P|1.0|Just watched this again on TV the other day.  The acting is simply astounding.  I can feel for the actors, as the dialogue is so atrocious that it's almost beyond belief, but still.  Were they physically prevented from doing the thing that we normally think of when the word \\"acting\\" is mentioned?  I mean, blurting out some dialogue, or reciting it as if you're making an emotionless statement, that's not acting.  Seriously, this is what I expect from fifth graders appearing in their very first school play.  It's just astonishes me every time one of the characters says something.  It's like a big, dumb, obvious summary of what's going on at the moment.  \\"Mom, I'm not a slave any more!\\"  Mom:  \\"All your dreams have come true.\\"  Said with all the emotion of \\"Oh, you remembered to pick up the potato chips from the store.\\"  Probably 80% of the dialogue in this movie is like this.  Most first-time script readthroughs on a soap opera must be far superior to this.  Seriously, Scooby Doo has  better acting - much, much better.  I honestly can't remember ever seeing anything like this, except maybe in the worst of the worst of Sci-Fi Originals.  And even then, it's not every member of the entire cast like it is here.        Then of course there's Jar Jar, the baby talking donkey.  I guess Lucas was really reaching out for the 2 and under audience.  And the big battle at the end, with a villain we hardly know, so there's really no drama there (except what can be created with CGI), and he looks downright silly in that Halloween face paint.  Oh, let's not forget the story, as Annakin's fighter gets hit, causing him to go out of control.  He ACCIDENTALLY flies into the space station, then while shooting at some droids, ACCIDENTALLY hits the main reactor, which nicely waits for him to get to a safe distance before exploding.  Good grief, it's too stupid and pathetic to even bother criticizing.    Overall, this is an astonishingly bad movie, with dialogue that keeps one in a constant state of \\"What the **** did I just see?\\".  I mean, constantly,. throughout the whole film.  The action is much the same, dumb, silly, dopey.  the tone of the movie goes from \\"epic drama\\" to dopey silliness, back and forth, pretty much every thirty seconds.  Dopey droids are vwooshed in half by the increasingly boring sounds of light sabers, which now look more like a fluorescent tube than any sort of weapon.  And then they chop another two dozen in half, then another three dozen, then another dozen.  Then another two dozen.

1400032717|4.0|The Courious Incident is written from the perspective of a fifteen-year-old boy with autism -- the book is a book he's writing for a project at school.

Not every autistic person is a master at \\"maths,\\" and a there are a few other peculiarities Christopher (the protagonist) shares with Rain Man's type of autism. But this is a point of minor criticism.<br /><br />The book starts out as a murder mystery (with a dog as its victim), but turns into so much more. This is a short book -- 215 pages, I think -- and it could be easily adapted into a good film. I hope it is.

0385338724|4.0|Remember Me? happens to be the first Sophie Kinsella book that I have ever read but definitely not the last.      Lexi Smart is 25 years old and works for a carpet manufacturer.  She is going through a quarterlife crisis with a loser boyfriend and a menial low end job, but she still has her best girlfriends whom she parties and hangs out with.  We meet Lexi on the night before her father's funeral out with her friends when she has a nasty fall and gets a bump on the head.  She wakes up in a hospital bed the next day and has no recollection of the night before.  She looks in a mirror and has no recollection of the face before her.  She is no longer snaggled tooth, her hair is no longer mousy brown, she is the best shape of her life, and has a Luis Vitton purse.  She can't remember who this person in front of her is and how she came to look this good overnight.      She actually wakes up and it is really 3 years in the future and she is 28.  She had been in a car accident in her Mercedes and has had a nasty bump on her head causing amnesia.  She can only remember the events of her life up to the night of her father's funeral three years ago.  She wakes up to a life that one can only dream of.

B000002MU3|4.0|Monster is definitely a departure from R.E.M.s formulaic sound but it's not necessarily a change for the worse either. Monster is, by far, R.E.M.'s loudest, sexiest and most aggressive album by far. With \\"Strange Currencies\\", \\"Bang and Blame\\", and \\"I Don't Sleep I Dream\\" being my favorite songs on the CD.
0060734191|3.0|This is a very fast paced novel.  I have only finished the first book in the trilogy but have found this to be an enjoyable fast read.  I look forward to the next two books.  The world Nix creates is different from any other.  If you like fantasy or video games even, I believe you will like this series.  I felt a bit like I was playing a video game with all the magic gadgets, spells, characters and secret places.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|I love stargate and am sorry that SG1 is coming to an end. It could not end without the Ori being defeated. The movie was great. I have closure.
0307237702|5.0|If you want to know what a intelligent, kind, honest man of itegrity thinks like, read this book. If you have doubts about what kind of President this man would be, you owe it to yourself and our country to read this book. Better yet, get it on CD. Listening to him read it was amazing. I read the book first and then ordered it on CD. Where was he 7 yrs ago?? Oh well, it doesn't matter, he is here now.
B00000I41J|5.0|Whenever I need a lift, this is a good choice to provide one. This is also one of those CD's that, when I'm facing my music collection and not sure what I'm in the mood for, this is one of my \\"default\\" CD's. (The others are [[ASIN:B0000014J0 Jazz in Silhouette]] and [[ASIN:B000000ZEP Billy Taylor Trio]].) You just can't go wrong when Miles Davis is involved, and Adderley brings a whole new dimension to the definition of a small horn section. Blakey's unmistakeable ferocity in driving the tunes provides a great backbone for the other musicians to build on, and each listening brings its own indescribable pleasure. I would say this is a CD that should be added to the collection of any serious jazz fan, and it would probably be a good choice for someone looking to broaden a non-jazz oriented music collection.
B000IFQLLY|4.0|There is nothing like Depeche Mode and it shows in this cd of their best songs.  Their sound is unique and lyrics are extraordinary.  Poetry set to music.  Great cd at great price.

B0009IW88A|5.0|I watched this movie twice, and in my opinion it's the best from other batman movies. The music is excellent, but it would be nice to hear some bytes through amazon.
0143143492|5.0|I am so grateful this book came to me at the right time; but that's how it always happens. If you are not spiritually ready this book will be meaningless. If you have been reading spiritual material for some time this may be the perfect read for you. I also highly recommend Tolle's book The Power of Now. These two books compliment one another. This book has immensely helped my arising consciousness.
1400064287|5.0|If you are going to write a guide to crafting sticky ideas, your book had better embody your principles. Authors Chip and Dan Heath succeed admirably. What I love about \\"Made to Stick\\" is that it is not merely entertaining (though it is), it provides practical, tangible strategies for creating sticky ideas. Once you understand these recommendations, you can boil them down to a set of touchstone points to evaluate your own work. This sets \\"Made to Stick\\" apart from the work of Malcolm Gladwell, whom the Heath brothers cite as an inspiration. I enjoyed Gladwell's books but could not necessarily apply his ideas to my own work.<br /><br />My review copy of \\"Made to Stick\\" is covered with highlighter. I am reading the book once through for pure pleasure, and then I am going back again to apply the ideas to evaluate the communications of a non-profit organization I am working for. \\"Made to Stick\\" challenges you to distill the essence of your message, to get back to core principles and to communicate them in a memorable way. Chip and Dan point out that as we become experts, we tend to use abstraction to define our ideas, and we lose our ability to communicate with novices. They teach us how to bridge that gap so that our ideas are once again accessible by everyone.<br /><br />\\"Made to Stick\\" gives you the tools you need to revamp your own messages. It provides \\"do it yourself\\" conuslting in book form, which will be appreciated by activists, entrepreneurs, and businesses of all sizes.

B00062I6TO|4.0|Both DVD's with New Years' concerts from Vienna are unsurpassed in artistic quality and photography. A serious document of arguably the most phenomenal conductor of all times!
B000YKE87W|5.0|Jonas Kaufmann won awards for a recital of Strauss lieder last year, and now here he is being boosted by Decca as the next big thing. The company earned a king's ransom with Pavarotti, so one understands their eagerness to push Kaufmann toward the popular Italian-French repertoire and away from the less commercial German. But as the arias from Meistersinger and (especially) Der Freischutz demonstrate, his forte lies in his native language. He's serious and heroic rather than carefree, smiling, or seductive by temperament. As further evidence, see the DVD of Fidelio under Harnoncourt, where Kaufmann sings a really stirring Florestan with ease and accuracy.<br /><br />In his own mind, however, Kaufmann had to break out of the mold of Wunderlich, Kmentt, and Dermota. Trying to sound light and flexible like them, he almost ruined his voice until an inspiring vocal teacher gave him the courage to unleash the true quality of his voice, which is baritonal but with a ringing top register. That's fine, but what I crave is Wunderlich's artistry, not just his vocal timbre. To my ears, Kaufmann is rather lost in the Italian style, despite his outgoing passion. His soft singing sounds odd (as someone else here has commented), and yet there's lots of color to it. Every once in a while, as in Don Jose's Flower Song and the Massenet arias 'Ah fuyez, douce image' and 'Pourquoi me reveiller,' Kaufmann almost convinces you that he could turn into a French singer, and yet ...<br /><br />In The Gramophone the estimable vocal critic John Steane praised this CD so extravagantly that he nominated Kaufmann for Best Tenor in the World. Obviously this is a voice that creates excitement and promises great things. It's as visceral and masculine as Jose Cura's. Whatever the future holds, Kaufmann is already the best German tenor on the scene, barrring only Ben Heppner.
0375842209|5.0|Markus Zusak made an inspired choice when he asked the Grim Reaper (a.k.a. Death) to be the narrator for THE BOOK THIEF.  What's even more inspiring is how ole Grim is sympathetic -- an overworked character (it's WWII Germany, after all!) who, much like Sisyphus, has little choice but to do what he's condemned to do -- in this case, gather souls as their mortal coils lie down one last time.  Death even has a heart.  If not, why would he have shared the story of the little Book Thief, Liesel Meminger?  She's a young girl who loses her mother and witnesses her brother's death before being adopted by a German couple (Hans and Rosa Hubermann) whose lovable eccentricities would do the Peggoty family proud in DAVID COPPERFIELD.<br /><br />As the protagonist, Liesel meets Rudy Steiner, a boy whose life goal is to win a kiss from her lips.  Zusak is on record as saying he fell in love with Leisel and Rudy (much like Pygmalion and his statue), and though this is a dangerous business usually, the author's loving care translates wonderfully for his readers.  When the Hubermann's decide to hide a Jewish boy in their cellar, the tension and the key themes of the Nazis and their little war come to the fore, carrying the novel along.<br /><br />But really this is a character-driven novel.  What's more, it is a writer's writer novel, for Zusak's narration is rich with figurative language and gorgeous to dwell upon.  Yes, it slowed me down (all that smelling of the figurative roses), but it only made the sad journey all the more fullfilling.<br /><br />At 550 pp., it's a long book and may be problematic for reluctant readers of a young age, but I think most teenagers and adults alike will sing its praises when they reach the end.  How Zusak will top this, I cannot say, but I'm looking forward to his trying...
1932100660|5.0|If everyone in the world would read this book, most would be enticed to follow the advice.  Those who do follow the advice on diet and lifestyle promoted in The China Study would experience a healthy life free of the lifestyle diseases seen in the Western World today.  I think everyone should read this book carefully and with an open mind.  It makes sense.  I am alive today because I have followed this counsel.
B00030EIY6|5.0|There is very little one can say about this DVD. Brilliant on all accounts!  Maestro Kleiber was and still remains unsurpassed. A must have!
B000PFU7OO|4.0|If you saw the movie, then you already know the music is great.  Very talented.  Very original.
B0007D9VAK|5.0|This is one of those books that has helped me out alot.  If you are a beginning animator in need of learning the principles of animation or if you have had difficulty figuring out how to create walk cycles and facial character animation, then this book is for you.
B000V6BE6M|5.0|Una de las mejores compilaciones de musica para peliculas, esta es la joya que corona todo el trabajo musical de esta trilogia. Mi unica critica seria que el DVD viene grabado en los dos lados de los discos,lo que los hace muy delicados pues es facil que se maltrate cualquiera de las dos caras. todo lo demas  es un excelente producto.
B00005JKGK|5.0|I was pleased with the product.  The movie is a classic and can relate to all aspects of life. It is not only a 'chick flick', but I think a movie for all ages and likes of people.  Perhaps reading the book would be an interesting treat to compare it with the film.
B000ULQV0W|5.0|This soundtrack is an appropriate tribute to the inspirational story recounted in Penn's movie. A story about a kid who ventured on a great journey of travel and self-discovery. Unfortunately, the young man's spiritual journey reaches a noble conclusion, while his physical journey ends in tragedy. This is a real life. This is real music.
0452289963|5.0|I have not started reading it yet but heard it is real good plus my sister in law sent me one too so must be good
006135323X|5.0|Excellent Book, This audio was very informative in that it was not new information, however, it was newly linked to economics (supply and demand) and impacts the equation of supply side economics.  I believe that Dan has something here and it needs to be highlighted in our new global economy. His basis is in rational vs irrational and how it can change our behavor when we have to make an decision.
B0006GVJEE|5.0|This movie is great. It is so well done and so well acted. A break out role for everyone in it.

B000RW3YYA|5.0|I enjoyed watching the second and third seasons of Stargate Atlantis. Can't wait for the fourth and fifth season to be in DVD. After I bought the first season and watch it on DVD in my home country, I decided to buy the second and third seasons on DVD via Amazon.Those who are fans of the Stargate SG1 series, I recommend the Stargate Atlantis to supplement. You will not be disappointed. Please, please put out the fourth and fifth seasons of Stargate Altantis on DVD as soon as possible.
0060989157|5.0|There's something endlessly entertaining about Motley Crue.  From their childhoods to the story of Ozzy and the ants, this book has it all!   It's pretty crass and definitely not for everyone but I highly enjoyed it!   I'll read it again and again. It was lots of fun!   I thought it was one of the best books I've ever read!   I hope there really will be a sequel!
B000WC3AOE|5.0|This HD DVD is excellent. The image and the soud is perfect. I thing is better if the bonus was subtittle in french but nobody is perfect.
0060987464|5.0|This book was interesting from beginning to end!   I find Brian Warner to be a dark, witty, funny and sometimes disturbing man.   Parts of the book are pretty crass, as to be expected.   While reading this book I laughed a lot. My jaw dropped at least twice.   I even felt nauseated on a couple of occasions.  But mostly I laughed.    It was totally absorbing and I finished it quickly.   Overall I found it very enjoyable!    It's definitely not for everyone but it gets two thumbs up from me!
0783228007|1.0|The other reviews that mention the missing scenes in the movie are right on the money.  Key scenes are missing, and until they release a version that has the whole movie, I recommend staying away from this on DVD.
B000AP04OM|5.0|I was very pleased with this special 40th anniversary DVD of The Sound of Music, with many interesting bonus features, including the Hollywood Von Trapps 40 years later (except for marvelous Eleanor Parker and Richard Haydn, who are no longer with us).  Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer are still glorious and distinguished, and their chemistry still exists in a 2005 interview, yet watching them in this movie assures that chemistry and their beauty as a couple forever in movie history.  The DVD was most reasonably priced and in excellent condition.  I still am confused with Amazon's checkout procedure and called them by phone to make sure I wasn't buying two of the same product, as I had two other times.  Such a hassle to return.  Luckily, that did not happen with this DVD; this is a special one indeed and a most welcome one to my collection.
B000VNMMPM|5.0|I used the word sparingly, but in short this film is flawless.  The casting, the script, the lighting, the editing, the special effects, the music, the combination of drama and comedy, etc. are seamless and pure within this flawless film, like a perfectly cut diamond. Luc Besson is undoubtedly one of the greatest filmakers, having created such amazing films such as The Fifth Element, The Messenger, and lately having made forays into production of impressive but hollow martial arts action films.  To say he has redeemed himself with this film would be an understatement. In the tradition of Wim Wenders Wings of Desire and Michael with Travolta, he has created a film which contains amazing visual beauty, hilarious humor and intense drama. A couple of scenes in this film actually passed that brain barrier or that filter in my mind that has become so jaded and unimpressed in a way I cannot remember any film in memory to do, and had me entranced.  This film is magic, with a wonderous chemistry, a sparkling ambiance, a simultaneously heavy and light heart, intensely romantic and poignant with an unlikely heroic leading man and a stunningly beautiful leading woman. Let this film become a permanent part of your pysche, for it is a life affirming spark of genius and art at its best.
B0016BP0PW|4.0|This movie has all the earmarks of a full-on musical from yesteryear. With dancing, very convincing singing, and easy mindless plot lines, Across the Universe had me tapping my feet and singing along from the start. Notable was the singing by all the actors with Rachel Evan Wood's version of \\"If I Fell\\" being both poignant and captivating. The scene at the military induction center - \\"She's So Heavy\\" and \\"Happiness Is A Warm Gun\\" - was brilliant.     Go back to the Love Generation of the sixties with this Beatles movie - you'll watch it again and again.
B0000BWTK3|4.0|The recording of Grieg' music is painfully beautiful. Not less painfull is to discover the same on a newly issued Andsnes CD (Ballad for Edvard Grieg).<br />The artist played the said concerto in 1990 earning great success. I thought two different EMI-Classic CD should contain different recordings...<br />I'll be more careful next time!
B000002OK3|5.0|Very easy trans. came in the mail a little over a week.  Impeccable condition.  Thanks.
B000000OAN|5.0|This album is absolutely wonderful. The only track I skip is \\"I'm in love with my car\\", which is not appealing to me in the least. Every other track is interesting and fun to sing and melodic and memorable. There are not many other bands which can deliver the variety of styles and song themes while creating a cohesive masterpiece. I can not say enough good about this album.
B00004RFFI|5.0|My 5 year old son has fallen in love with tornadoes and asked me for a week to buy Twister at one of our nearby stores.  I couldn't find it ANYWHERE but this seller did a FANTASTIC job getting the movie to me quickly!  Unfortunately now we have to watch it over and over and over...
B000002VSN|2.0|Even tho I loved the movie, I was rather disappointed in the CD, as it is not what I would call a Sountrack.  There are a few songs I don't recall from the movie, and the ones that she sang on the CD, were not as they were in the move.  For example---Who would imagine a King---She sang this with the Childrens choir in the movie, and alone on the CD. She sang about three or four songs with the adult choir, and only heard them once on the CD and that was at the end.  For a soundtrack, I would not recommend it.  It should have just been called a Christmas Album.
074356619X|5.0|The audio book and dvd gives one a lot to think about.  It's positive subject matter, makes you think anything is possible. I listen to and watched them over and over.  Anyone with chaos in their life would benifit by either venue.      Thanks  Janice
0793573742|4.0|Beauty of the 'Burst is an overall good book. The photography is excellent, the layout is clear and the printing (critical, since color plays an important part in the discussion of these guitars) is really well done.    The book is definitely for aficionados of the sunburst Les Paul only. What you have are several hundred pages dedicated to one model of guitar, all with the same paint job and hardware. Obviously it's a very special guitar, and those people hooked on LP 'bursts will love seeing all the subtleties between instruments.    There are a couple of areas where I feel the book falls slightly short, but they're minor. In the section following the photographs (\\"Science Of The 'Burst\\", where they analyze every aspect of the guitar from the finish to the wood) there are some small factual errors such as the thickness of the maple top-plate. Not a huge deal, but in a book that gets into such minutia and makes such a big deal about the smallest of features, I feel they were obligated to get things like this correct. A person using some of these specifications to evaluate an instrument might be thrown off the mark.    The other thing that slightly annoyed me was the hyperbole used to describe every single instrument. One of the features people love about these guitars is the figured maple top. Some are nicer than others (just a fact of production, not to mention that this was a non-priority for Gibson at that time), yet every guitar is given the \\"this is the most unbelievable example\\" treatment. The plainest maple top will be gushed over, sighting something like the \\"wonderful fading of the color\\" or the \\"amazingly straight grain-lines that run the length of the top.\\"  Hey, it's some faded paint and wood with grain lines! I was waiting for them to rave about \\"the incredible way Les Paul's have mass, are affected by gravity and take up THREE dimensions (height, width AND depth).\\"    Nit-picking aside, it's a very well done book which I enjoy looking at. It also is aterrific collectors tool as well as a nice paean to one of the great, iconic instruments of the 20th century. Recommended.
B0013BNY2Q|5.0|First of all I need to say that I am not a hater of the late period REM. Though the recent albums haven't been classics, they have featured some of the best songs REM has made. Accelerate reminds me of Lifes Rich Pageant and Fables with a little bit of Automatic mixed in. My favs are Hollow Man, Until the Day is Done and Houston. Great rocking album. Keep it coming guys, you are on a roll.
0452289963|5.0|This book is so relevent to our time here. It is life changing to being present and realizing who we are as essence. I catch myself more and raise myself to a higher level of experiencing life and being greatful to every experience I create. Anyone on a spiritual quest will love this book.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|We purchased Celtic Woman after seeing it on PBS.  It transports you back to \\"Old Ireland\\" & all that your dreams can imagine.  Good choice of songs, well put together production. The young ladies have lovely voices, look gorgeous, & kept our attention for the full hour & half program.  An added bonus was the look behind the scenes, showing how they had put together such an undertaking.  The setting at the Slane Castle seemed to add to the authenticity.
0307383415|5.0|This book is excellent.  A very pleasant.  You will not be able to put it down.  Forget the naysayers who recently posted.  This book is honest and well written.
0330490192|2.0|I have to say, I was certainly looking forward to reading this book, having heard much about it from family and friends (I'm from Zimbabwe). Perhaps it is the fact that I am not a white Zimbabwean, but from the first pages, I had a bitter taste in my mouth. I admired the writing, but that was about it. The overwhelming impression that we had of whites growing up in Zim became manifest in this book, and I was transported back to those days. The most disturbing thing for me was the lack of remorse...no, redemption, by the author. She would relay stories about her racist parents, her upbringing and such, and did not transmit any sense that all this was not right, not humane. Strange how the same words can be read by different people and evoke such divergent responses.
1416524800|2.0|Although Deception Point takes a whole new direction for Dan Brown from the Da Vinci Code, there are many similarities between this book and some of his other works.<br /><br />Deception Point starts off with a bang and hinted at something great and interesting. NASA has discovered a meteorite buried deep under the Arctic ice and it seems that this meteorite contains traces of extraterrestial life. The story is really about dirty politics and the world of espionage. But sadly, the book deteriorates into a predictable juvenile action story.<br /><br />Compared to the Da Vinci Code and Digital Fortress, there is not much difference in the plotline between the 3 books. All 3 books cover completely different topics, but having read the other 2 first, I could guess the identity of the bad guy correctly half-way through the book. It seems like Dan Brown uses a cookie-cutter recipe for his novels, even in terms of the characters.<br /><br />In the end I felt a bit cheated, because a story which held so much promise in the begiing, just fell flat towards the end.
0452289963|5.0|This is a book everyone that is at a crossroad in their life should read.  It helps you to look at life in a very different way and THINK about your life as it is right now.
0060935464|5.0|I loved re-reading this book.  It has been and always will be one of my favorites.  All the characters are so rich and memorable.
B0010YSD7M|4.0|I'm a big fan of the show - have watched every episode.  I don't think that it has been given nearly the respect that it deserves.  However, I think that this video is strictly for fans like myself.  Yes, it ties up the last major storyline that was going on when the show ended, but if you didn't watch the show, you would not know what is going on in this video.
0385338724|5.0|This novel is an excellent read, with enjoyable characters.  Sophie Kinsella knows how to make you laugh and smile.  She has a way of making readers want more and love her more with each and every book!

0452289963|1.0|It is sad to see Oprah fall for this false teacher. Another new age prophet of easy living without accountability to the creator God. It reminds me of the wonderful quote from the movie The Usual Suspects: \\"The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist.\\" He is laughing at these suckers right now. Of course, nonbelievers will see this as foolishness, but so be it. Corinthians 3:19 For the wisdom of this world is foolishness in God's sight. As it is written: \\"He catches the wise in their craftiness.\\"

B000VNMMQG|5.0|Ioan Gruffud (of the Hornblower mini-series) plays the English parliamentarian who successfully fought to end the Atlantic slave trade.  This sobering and inspiring true story reveals the connection between the slave trade and the well-known song \\"Amazing Grace\\".  Everyone should see this story of uncaring injustice.
B0010X745K|1.0|...run, do NOT walk to the nearest door and DO NOT watch this film.  It takes a beautiful piece of written work and turns it into something unspeakable.  The ending is a surprise to all, including the original author.  The credits should have read, \\"VERY LOOSELY based on a novella by Stephen King.\\"  I considered it a waste of money, of time, and of film!
B000J3EEBY|5.0|In this very humble devotee's opinion, Loreena McKennitt could sing \\"99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall\\" and it would sound as if inspired by a great poet of yore, sung by the priestess of a mystic goddess. Needless to say, all of her CDs receive my highest rating. The only difference between them in my estimation is that one or the other my have certain all time favorite songs or poems--and ALL of them feature a lot of those.    McKennitt continues her exploration of Middle Eastern musical phrasing, so wonderful & prominent in NIGHTS FROM THE ALLHAMBRA.    Another element that really shines out in this CD is the superlative quality of the accompanying instrumental composition & musicians. \\"Kecharitomene\\" is a powerful non-vocal composition & performance. It's really great to hear the hurdy gurdy played on many of the pieces. I can't single out any performer because they all sounded wonderful. Also, there were some instruments I wasn't familiar with--and synthesizing made identification difficult at some points. The lead instrument in the \\"Caravanserai\\" selection sounded like a violin. was SO GOOD. In fact, it reflected a very pleasant overall romantic feel to this CD.    \\"Caravanserai\\" bestows \\"the gift of tears\\" (at least for me) and beckons like a ray of light in this very sad world. This lovely song can be heard as a musical prologue to the next song The English Ladye and The Knights, with its Palestrina like choral intro and conclusion.    \\"Kecharitomene\\" is a powerful non-vocal composition &  incredible performance.

B000002UA0|4.0|I can explain what this album is like by comparing the sound and style to three different Beatles songs-    \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\\"  \\"Blue Jay Way\\"  \\"Love You To\\"    The Piper at the Gates of Dawn is mostly an extremely heavy pyschedelic album that focuses on vocal melody for 80% of it, and the majority of songs almost seem like they were aimed towards children because of the nursery rhyme style they're written in.  Of course back in the day this was a revolutionary new style of rock music.  As a result though, for me at least, I can only listen to this album every once in a while.      \\"Astronomy Domine\\" is the highlight of the album, and really, most of the songs sound the same.  Whether you like that style or not is up to the listener to decide.  \\"Pow R. Toc H.\\" stands out from the rest because of the piano jam, and \\"Interstellar Overdrive\\" is a VERY trippy and lengthy piece of psychedelic rock at its most hardcore.   Is it a masterpiece though?  No, not really.  It gets too messy and noisy after the fourth  minute or so.  I like the chicken-sounding effects on the guitar though, and when around the third minute when the guitars sound like a bunch of hens in a hen house cackling at once.    The song I don't care for is the closer \\"Bike\\".  Just a very bad chorus to me.  I like the rest of the songs, even more so when I'm totally in the mood for this style of rock.
B00000AF95|5.0|I'm a huge KISS fan I love them so much. I had Animalize on tape until my tape player ate it. The songs are of good quaility and I love the fact that they have lyrics in the front of the album. Over all I give this a hgh rating that I(His sister) and my brother(The one who I wrote it under) both enjoyed.
B0006ZE7G2|5.0|I first watched this video back in the mid-80's and it became a staple of my VHS collection. After VCR's went the way of the Dodo, so too went my Wall video. After rehashing my Floyd addiction, I purchased this DVD and am totally pleased. The special features are wonderful as they interview the producer, animation director and even Roger Waters himself! The packaging is great and it comes with a Wall poster that now decorates my bedroom wall. I highly recommend this DVD for any Floyd fan or anybody who likes to indulge themselves in a mind-bending trip into insanity!
0307387178|4.0|I had heard about the story from TV, etc.  I was VERY excited to read it and then watch the movie (which I did).  The book was wonderfully informative, a bit hard to follow due to the format.  It had a lot of big words and descriptions. The author digressed A LOT.  Telling stories of other \\"tramps\\".  All and all I really enjoyed the book and what I learned about Christopher.  I just wish there were more pictures (only had one grainy black and white) of his journey and journal entries from his journal.  I assume the family has kept pretty tight hold on those as there are very few online either.  I would recommend the book.
0920236162|5.0|This is a princess after my own heart! I love all of Robert Munch's books and this is my very favorite. The illustrations are terrific and the princess is a girl who doesn't need to wait around to be rescued, she shows how even a princess can take care of herself.

B000Y2WAL6|1.0|Every song from the previously released \\"B-Sides and Rarities\\" except \\"Flyswatter (Polka Dots Remix)\\" and a hidden track are included.  I actually wouldn't be mad if they had included *every* track, but excluding 2 forces me to keep B-Sides in my itunes collection (yes, I'm a completionist, I only include full albums in iTunes, and yes that is my fault) Still, its an annoying thing to do to put out an album that includes *nearly* every track from another album, but not all.  I digress
B0006Z2KX4|5.0|The hilarity and hijinx are non-stop! Just when you think it can't get any funnier - it does! This has been a favorite of mine since I first saw it in the seventies! My sister and I were home from school with a bad case of the flu when this movie came on and we couldn't stop laughing all the way through! It was every bit as good as I remembered and the group of teens watching with me who swore they would hate it for sure since it was so \\"old\\" couldn't stop laughing either and had to cofess that it was a great movie !

B000002UDB|5.0|Not as good as Hard Day's Night but I still don't get tired of watching it.
0060578793|5.0|I found this book jam packed with information relating to survival in various conditions. It explains everything from the desperate situations to the mild encounters. It covers practical aspects of terrains, wildlife, how to prepare for the variety of situations you may face. Without going overboard or into far too much detail it remains easy to read by describing the facts and techniques in a non complicated manor. I would recommend this book for anyone planning traveling or even just with an aim to gain knowledge of our world around us.
B0000542D2|5.0|I first saw this movie at a drive-in when it first came out. I loved it then and it has stood the test of time.
B000YABYLA|3.0|First off, I graduated from high school six years ago, and have known many high schoolers since then, and to listen to Juno talk...who talks like this? It's really a stretch to see her as an average teenage girl.  The kids on Dawson's Creek and Clueless were more believable. But then there are tons of farcical things in this movie.  I'm a decent ways through this movie, and this high school girl strikes me as way too flippant about everything.  When she went to the abortion clinic, her reason for leaving was b/c she was annoyed by the receptionist.  She found an adopting family in the paper, she told the guy she was preggo, she told her parents...all these things occurred in short scenes.  Unless something happens that I haven't seen yet, this girl has no emotional attachment to any decision or situation she encounters.      I'm not going to say this movie was uncomfortable to watch, but there was definitely enough cringe worthy scenes. For example when Jen Garner's character starts touching Juno's baby bump in the food court and starts talking to it.  And she just keeps showing up at the adoptive couple's home unannounced which is conveniently when the husband is home alone, or she calls when he's by himself, and the overt flirting. And he's just as bad talking to her about his marriage problems (he wants to be a `rock star' and the marriage is holding him back). Speaking of the couple, for them to have tried for a baby for so long, and for Jen G's character to want it so bad, it seems they would be more concerned about this flippant girl who shows no emotion.    I'm on the pro-life side, but know girls who have both had their babies and had abortions. None, NONE, went through either process and remained as immature or unchanged like Juno. It's laughable.  Yes, I consider it good that she had the baby, but you know what? Not one person in this movie told her to GROW UP which is what she desperately needed to do.  Seriously, NOTHING about the process scared her?I don't know if the actors were given the space to adlib or what, but most of the dialogue was just irritating. There's nothing funny, nothing thought provoking.  The movie tries to be \\"fresh\\" or some other term that movie critics give to movies that are inaccurate.  Just b/c they say it, doesn't make it so. The Oscar it won was definitely a gift, and I didn't see the movie of the winner, but had EP won an Oscar, it would have been undeserved.    I always say that if a movie is lauded the way this movie was or any of the \\"Oscar favorites\\" for the last 7 years or so, chances are I'll feel the opposite of the Academy.  Most of what comes out of Hollywood these days is nothing but pretentious, pseudo-intellectual, \\"not for all you average Americans,\\" and overly political junk. Prediction:  When my future kids and grandkids and pretty much anyone 50 yrs from now is looking for a thought-provoking, stimulating, classic movie, they'll be doing like we do now, watching films by Billy Wilder, Hitchcock, Kazan, Huston, and all the other classics. I really can't imagine any of the films that we are seeing today standing the test of time.  There will be a very few of the current Hollywood era films to show up on the AFI all-time list.    It's finally over. Gosh.  Not worth the time I spent to watch. If you want to see a better movie dealing with unexpected pregnancy w/comedy...watch Waitress. That was awesome.  Matter of fact, I think Lifetime did a better teen pregnancy movie than this with Kirsten Dunst.    Oh, and P.S.  I'm a Christian, and this is not a Christian movie.  Just b/c a movie presents a pro-life view doesn't make it Christian. I don't understand that stereotype.
B000TLMWMY|4.0|Johnny Cash is excellent.  Most of the guests are enjoyable. Mother Maybelle is amazing.  Kristofferson does a great job of narrating it.  Some of the details about the guests are interesting and amusing.  Linda Ronstadt was 35 years ahead of her time in the wardrobe department. It's too bad we can't get quality shows like this on TV today. This DVD set brought back a lot of good memories and is definitely a good value.
0452289963|5.0|This is a book I probably wouldn't have bought if it hadn't have been for the on-line class sponsored by Oprey Winfry and Eckhart Tolle. I needed some help to get into it, and the online class gave me that jump start, but then, for the first time in my life, I began to understand that the ego is not who I am, and why I've always felt I was more than my body. This book isn't for everyone, only those who are seeking and ready to expand their feelings of love for all of creation.
032147404X|5.0|Amazon reviewers are thoughtful and intelligent (most of them).  I use them religiously before buying anything.  I will use Scott Kelby's 'cut to the chase' method and say this book is incredible.  I'm more on the amateur end of the spectrum, but I needed a straight forward \\"how to\\" book to get me through the simple everyday tasks I want my camera to perform.  This is a must have for the amateur and intermediate photog.  All the other 431 reviews are correct this should be 5 stars.

B000VECAEO|4.0|If you're only going to buy one season on DVD you obviously are more likely to find more of your favourite classic episode moments on previous season collections.  Season 9 however wraps up arguably the greatest show which has ever been on TV and although not quite as good, still has enough classic lines that you're going to want to finish off your Seinfeld collection with. You're also going to also want to do it while this season is still at normal prices and not at collectors ones.<br /><br />Season 9 for the most part maintained the high quality of the previous seasons with classic moments such as George's girlfriend saying no when he tries to break up with her, a bookstore making him buy and refusing to let him return a book he took into the toilet, he dates a woman who looks like Jerry and the George scenes which brought back flashbacks for anyone who was a kid in the 80s when he has to own the Frogger machine from a closing down pizza shop with his high score.  Elaine dates a homeless man, a boyfriend she wonders if is black before she reunites with Puddy who she discovers is religious and thinks she is going to hell but doesn't care, she also is tormented by a fax machine, plagiarises a newspaper cartoon and eats an historic piece of cake among a few adventures.  Kramer among other things turns his apartment into a movie set, moves to Seinfeld's parents retirement village in Florida, hides a safebox key inside a neighbours bird, takes up an acting gig in a hospital and steals police caution tape.  Jerry continues to find faults with the various women he dates including a sentence finisher and one with a secret tractor story as well as realising dating and paying his maid is not much different to using a prostitute.  The quality of the final couple of episodes is not quite up there with the rest of the series, it is almost as if too much effort was put into giving all the writers a go and trying to make these epidodes the best which only resulted in them being not exactly Seinfeldly in feel.<br /><br />Like with the other series the special features aren't as numerous in number or as good as they could have been. The deleted scene with the actor playing someone who had a sponge left inside of him is hilarious and should have been in the show.  As should have a lot of the deleted court scenes from the finale which could have maybe been there at the expense of the slow start to that episode.  Like most I thought the finale was a bit of a disappointment compared to my expectations but seriously I don't think it's possible to reach the expectations of the huge number of fans, interestingly in the scenes from the roundtable feature Larry David says he would do it with less hype if he could do it again. Just on that roundtable feature, I don't understand why they didn't include the whole show instead of a very edited version, especially since some of the stuff they kept was also told in the commentaries.  On the topic of commentaries I thought they finally got the balance right with the commentary on the Burning in relation to allowing you to hear the lines and at the same moment learn some facts (this one included Jason, Julia and the actor who played Puddy).  However the commentaries on The Maid and Puerto Rican Day by the writers was pretty average and mostly related to them telling you how good they were to come up with this or that idea and criticising Jerry for not including their ideas such as George finding out his name is really Georg when he brings his birth certificate to work.  I did like how one had the courage to criticise NBC and the politically correct nuts for not showing the Puerto Rican Day Parade episode on TV after it first aired just because a few people protested before it was even aired and they even knew what it was about.<br /><br />One of if not the best TV show ever!ctly Seinfeldly in feel.

B000WMFZMY|4.0|Aroused by a fanatical Moorish warlord, emir-king attack a Castilian village, where they are captured by Rodrigo Diaz de Vivar...<br /><br />Vigorously brave and compassionate, the noble Rodrigo hates bloodshed and vows to see his country at peace, frees the prisoners on their solemn pledge never again to attack Castile...<br /><br />For this act of courage and mercy, one of the Emirs, Moutamin, calls Rodrigo \\"El Cid,\\" and pledges eternal friendship to the Cid of Vivar... And so, in freeing the Moors, Rodrigo, accidentally, stumbled onto a battle, not to his luscious bride, but to a battle that will change his whole life...<br /><br />In the court of King Ferdinand, Rodrigo's act of clemency is misinterpreted, and he's accused of treason by his rival Don Ordonez for refusing to turn over to him the captures Moors...<br /><br />Unfortunately, Rodrigo's aged father, Don Diego, is slapped by the Champion of the king, Count Gormaz, father of his beloved Chimene... Rodrigo begs Gormaz an apology; it is refused... A duel begins and the champion is badly wounded... Before he dies, however, he asks Chimene to avenge his death...<br /><br />Chimene's wish is fulfilled when King Ramiro of Aragon challenges King Ferdinand for the possession of the city of Calahorra by the outcome of a single combat...El Cid convinces the king to permit him to fight Don Martin...Thus, according to the custom of trial by combat, God would judge Rodrigo's guilt or innocence...<br /><br />\\"El Cid\\" is an intense film, lavish and spectacular, bigger than any in terms of cast and impressive as any in visual terms... Mikl&oacute;s R&oacute;zsa gave a new dimension to the emotion that Anthony Mann was trying to express...<br /><br />Mann gives us a human story with a love story balanced with the most strongly image of a hero the world has ever seen... He presented a man of honor who thinks always of his wife, his country, and his king first... Even in death, his thoughts are for others and not himself...<br /><br />El Cid insults kings and noblemen in the name of justice and integrity and does what he knows to be right... He battles the king's living sword in respect of his father... He accepts the challenge of a champion of a king to prove himself innocent of treason and other things... He shows a prince how any man can kill and only a king can give life... He fights 13 knights, at the same time, to free a prisoner... Yet he is in addition to all of this an extremely principled leader... He accepts exile for life from the country he loves, and yet he is the only man in Spain who 'could humble a king and would give a leper to drink from his own pouch...'<br /><br />The joust sequence called \\"The fight for Calahorra,\\" is perhaps the most rousing, exciting, one-to-one combat ever filmed... The battle scenes at Valencia are taken on an epic scale... But the value of Anthony Mann's movie is the characterization in which Charlton Heston played El Cid's life...

B001437DMA|2.0|I was psyched to hear a new Joe Satriani recording, but after listening to these tracks  I'm once again disappointed somewhat. For me, Joe's brand of instrumental guitar peaked with Crystal Planet. Nearly everthing since, with the notable exception of Engines of Creation, sounds like a retread of prior stuff. Joe has a gift for songcraft and melody which is always evident on every recording right up to this one. The problem I have, is that after Crystal Planet, it was like, ok, he's pretty much mined every last piece of ground you can with this format. ie- VERY standard 4/4 kick-snare-kick-snare sounding drums, very basic power chord rhythyms that sound written to a drum machine, some things that sound a bit too cliched,etc,etc,etc...What could Joe do to create a GREAT recording? Pull a Pat Metheny and try co-writing with another talented instrumentalist, ala Lyle Mays. Bring in some guys, and write out some parts that flesh out a tune, where not every single song has melody guitar over power chords leading to guitar solo...let a virtuoso pianist add some texture and element, bring in a Steve Gaddlike drummer ...give them some space and write in some interesting parts for them. Take everything to the next level. Pat Metheny is a great guitarist as well, but he surrounds himself with great players and puts his ego aside and writes great music for the WHOLE band to play. The result is a musical sophistication which Joes gifted playing YEARNS to be teamed with, to take his compositions to a new level, imo.  I'll hedge all this by adding , it's obvious Joe has found a niche he's happy with, and all of his stuff is still entertaining and fun to listen to.
B000ZN802W|1.0|guy comes from wealthy family, and is offered pretty much anything that he wants at high school graduation.  He is too whiny for all that and chooses to hang out with hippies, swims naked in a stream, shoots a moose, then dies in an abandoned bus.  It doesn't get any more wild than that.  If I wanted to see someone die on a bus, I'd move to the Middle E... never mind.

It was somewhat distracting, but then I love the story and the acting. And a big bonus for me is that they're XBox compatible. It seems like most DVDs are, but in case anybody wanted to know about this particular set, there ya go. ^^

0767836324|5.0|I'm starting to think that all of the people who disliked this movie, calling it one of Spielberg's worst, saying it has none of the magic of his earlier films, that it doesn't capture the spirit of the Peter Pan story, is a little bit deranged. I'm not saying this is Steven Spielberg's best film, but apparently watching a guy fight Nazis and a kid find an alien is more magical and reminds someone more of their childhood than the idea of growing up and having to give up on the fun you had as a child (by the way, I love the INDIANA JONES films and E.T.). I've read a lot of the bad reviews of this film, and all of them are written by people who have grown up and apparently become the workaholic who has no time for fun anymore that Robin Williams plays here. Yet they all seem to enjoy Spielberg's other forays into capturing the fun of childhood. I'm not sure what exactly went wrong for them here. Neverland doesn't look right? I don't know how much money was spent here, but I found Neverland to look pretty amazing. Dustin Hoffman is too over-the-top as Hook? Yeah, you're right, Hook should be a real bore. The list goes on and on.<br /> Anyway, as many probably know, the plot concerns a grown-up Peter Pan, now Peter Banning (Robin Williams, doing a great job), who has left Neverland and become a workaholic with no time for his kids (like a lot of movies, so maybe that's a complaint of the naysayers). Then suddenly, upon a visit to Granny Wendy's (Maggie Smith), Peter's kids are kidnapped by Lord Voldemort... er, Captain Hook (Hoffman), who wants to rid himself of Peter Pan once and for all. However, Peter has no idea who he once was, so it's up to his old friend Tinkerbell (Julia Roberts... good cast, huh?), who snatches him away to Neverland, and the Lost Boys (apparently another complaint of people... anyone that has any energy in this film gets negativity, it would seem), who are still wild and orphaned. Does Peter become the Pan again and save his kids? Who do you think directed this?<br /> I really wish this could be considered one of Spielberg's best, because it's certainly one of my favorites. Spielberg's direction, the acting, John Williams' beautiful score, it all works so well for me. I grew up with this movie, and I also grew  up with the Disney cartoon of Peter Pan, the book, and various other film/stage adaptations, and I truly believe that Spielberg has created a magical semi-sequel. I'm uncertain how the people who don't like this movie would have done a 'Peter Pan is grown-up movie'. Would they have not done one at all? It was and still is a great idea, and perhaps it's a movie best enjoyed by people who saw it first when they still had the innocence of childhood that is explored so well here.directed this?

B000UBMWG4|5.0|What can I say about this Blu-ray 5-disk collector's set? Well, maybe I'm just biased towards this film, but I have to say this is really one of the best, if not the best Collector's sets out there.    Everything that kept this film from being as perfect as can be has now been corrected in the \\"Final Cut\\" version of the film. Ridley Scott did not take a page from George Lucas and butchered this amazing film. He just corrected the flaws in this film that he couldn't fix at the time, because of budget and time restrictions.    Though, do not worry, all corrections are seamless. This is what truly makes these corrections really great, is that unless you have already seen the previous versions, you wouldn't even know what was corrected. This is the sole reason why I'm not even going to mention what corrections were made, just so for those who have never seen this movie can see for themselves if they can spot them. I'm confident to say I doubt they will be able to.      What you will notice right away is how amazing the PQ/SQ is of this film (Final Cut). This movie looks like it could have been shot yesterday, and I'm not exaggerating. I own the Blu-ray set, so I can't speak for the SD-DVD set, but I'm sure it's amazing in it's own right as well.     Though, if you want the best experience and you own an HDTV, then I recommend you get yourself a Blu-ray player and buy the Blu-ray 5-Disk Collector's Edition Set. It's expensive, but worth every dollar.    So, what do you get in this 5-disk collector's set?     5 versions/cuts of the film, which includes the rare workprint version.    3 hour+ documentary that will pretty much give you all the information you want and more about the making of the film.    Deleted Scenes, Casting Auditions, etc....    SD-DVD, or Blu-ray you will not be dissapointed.

I know retro is kind of back in but if I wanted to hear a bad imitation of the Beetles there are plenty of other bands out there.  What happened to the great, unique sound from the last album? I should have just purchased the track I like off this album not the entire thing.  If this band survives to put out another album I hope it is more like the first.

B000R7HY0K|4.0|I like these sort of movies although this is not a particularly good Quentin Tarantino. The acting is okay as is the action.    The story is watchable.    I do like the way he made it seem like a B-grade movie. I thought that was a nice twist.

B000RJO578|5.0|Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg (director and co-writers) nailed the zombie spoof with the uber-witty \\"Shaun of the Dead.\\"  Re-assembling much of the same cast and keeping the understated yet hilarious send-up theme, they turn their sights to action flicks of the Jerry Bruckheimer/Tony Scott variety with \\"Hot Fuzz.\\"  And the results couldn't be better.    Nicholas Angel (Pegg, the lead from \\"Shaun) is the top kick-butt sergeant in the London police force.  This is in itself high comedy, because Pegg only resembles an action hero the way Rudy represents a Notre Dame football player - I half expected someone to remind Angel that he's five-foot-nothin' and a hundred-and-nothin', with a weak chin to boot.  His success only earns him the enmity of his fellow cops (including the hilarious Bill Nighy) who reassign him to the country to keep them from looking bad.    Once there, Angel finds a police force who couldn't assemble a two-car parade and haven't been asked to do much more than that.  Eventually, though, Angel stumbles upon a massive criminal enterprise and brings it down with the help of not-so-trusty sidekick Danny Butterman (Nick Frost, also the fat sidekick in \\"Shaun\\").     Like \\"Shaun,\\" \\"Hot Fuzz\\" has the usual combination of subtle and not-so-subtle humor wrapped around some shocking-yet-comical violence.  A larger budget means that explosions are bigger and deaths are bloodier and more elaborate, but at its heart \\"Hot Fuzz\\" remains an ingenious comedy more than an action movie.  While the movie stands on its own rights, it means a heck of a lot more if you've sat through more than your share of \\"Lethal Weapon\\" or \\"Bad Boyz\\" flicks - these guys feel your pain, too.
B000VDDWE2|5.0|good movie - good movie arts.  the blueray version is the best that i have collected so far about this movie.    whenever i need to keep myself somber i will take it out and watch again - are we rushing to that end?
B00005JPNY|1.0|I will put this the nicest way I can.<br />I did not read the book. You shouldn't have to read a book to go see the movie.<br />Sitting in the movie watching it. the Char's will say something that you have NO idea what in the world they are talking about. (and on several occasions) It makes NO sense, it has nothing to do with ANYTHING.<br />The writers \\"Assume\\" you have read the book.<br />We all know what happens when you Assume now, don't we?<br />0/5 Stars for a film that makes NO sense, Will more than likely have an equally horrid sequel to it, and the highlight is when a bear fights. Oooh Ahhh... I can't tell you how ashamed my 2 friends and I were that we wasted money on this movie. Please do yourself the favor and don't make the same mistake.
B000092ZYX|3.0|There was a lot of suspense in the months leading up to Radiohead's 2003 album HAIL TO THE THIEF. No one was sure if the band would go further into the IDM territory of the electronics-laden KID A and Amnesiac, or if they would return to the more radio-friendly style of their masterpiece OK COMPUTER.<br /><br />HAIL TO THE THIEF surprisingly managed to include both styles. In some songs, such as \\"2 + 2 = 5\\" or \\"Sail to the Moon\\", traditional instruments are in the fore. On other songs, especially \\"The Gloaming\\", \\"Where I End and You Begin\\", \\"Backdrifts\\" the sound is mainly electronics-based. There's also some fresh new elements, such as the use of three percussionists in \\"There There\\". Lyrically, the album often returns to some extent to the theme of existential crisis that made OK COMPUTER so perfectly capture the Zeitgeist. \\"2 + 2 = 5\\", \\"Sail to the Moon\\", \\"Backdrifts\\", and \\"The Gloaming\\" express uncertainty over our future and distrust in our politicians and decision makers, but thankfully without political references that would be quickly dated.<br /><br />Unfortunately, HAIL TO THE THIEF is padded with several songs that would have been better relegated to b-sides. Instead of a tight and consistently quality album, the band inexplicably dediced to include the uncharacteristic classic rock \\"A Punch-Up at a Wedding\\", the very generic \\"Scatterbrain\\" and \\"I Will\\", and the unsatisfying closer \\"A Wolf at a Door\\". As one major critic's review stated, it's a good album instead of a great one. Overall, I personally prefer OK COMPUTER and IN RAINBOWS to it.
B0014Z4OQG|5.0|I am 32, my wife is 28, and we went with 2 friends of ours who are 30ish to see this film.<br />We weren't expecting for the entire movie to be from a video camera. This was quite surprising. I see many people relating this to \\"The Blair Witch Project\\" well you can't really do that. Blair Witch's camera was so unstable they had to put barf bags in theaters. Not 1 had to do that for Cloverfield.<br />Not 1 person in our filled to the rim screen complained about it. Not 1 person got up and left. Not 1 person barfed. This tells me that the only ones complaining are the ones who simply don't like movies done in this style. They should stay away and quit crying like babies.<br />JJ Abrams and his crew are brilliant. Check out Lost and see for yourself.<br />We enjoyed everything about this movie start to finish. The special effects were a bit few and far between, but what an OUTSTANDING job on them. Hands down one of the best films of the year. A must buy to my collection.
B000OYC7A8|5.0|The DVD is phenomenal, like others project of fantastic David Gilmour. But I have one problem. The DVD is only for Zone 1.

It's mistake of Amazon and sellers, and I am not satisfied for that problem.

You will love every single second of Zappa's mesmerizing masterpieces and guitar solos.
B0010VD7EO|2.0|Immediate, seemingly-shallow lyrics with step-on-your-genitals vocals over sophisticated early era Gary Numan style synth-pop?  Here is a list of who will (or already does) dig MGMT: girls, girls on coke at clubs, dudes in tight jeans who think it is acceptable to copulate in club bathrooms with girls on coke, girls who like Erasure, dudes who like Burial, dudes who can pick House and Progressive and Trance out of a lineup, people who think Moby is underrated, people who know one Aphex Twin song, people who claim to love electronica but have never heard of Autechre, people who love Justice, droves of people who like it for all the wrong reasons (see above), critics who want something new but just barely new (see Burial), critics who will, eventually, secretly  concede that the disc \\"has some worthwhile traits\\" after hating it because so many stupid people like it for the wrong reasons.

1400064287|5.0|The brothers Heath have synthesized for us a methodology in which people such as marketeers, engineers and imagineers can get their ideas communicated in a very effective manner. Their formula or telling STORIES in a certain way is a sure fire method to capture almost anyone's attention. It's gotta be SIMPLE and UNEXPECTED.. you start to get them hooked then complete loop with CONCRETENESS - CREDIBILITY & EMOTION.  If you've got to sell something important to your boss or spouce (or both) read this book first. Perhaps it's best to carry a highlighter. It will be a fun read... I promise.

055358894X|4.0|I want to give this book better than four stars, but there are a couple of HUGE implausibilities that prevent me from doing so.  Notwithstanding this, I still wholeheartedly recommend LOCKE LAMORA.<br /><br />This is the kind of fantasy I like.  There is no quest, no arch-evil.  It's gritty, largely realistic and fast-paced.<br /><br />As with most fantasy novels, LOCKE LAMORA is set in a medieval-type setting.  The story focuses on the exploits of Locke Lamora and his crew of thieves.  But these are no mere pick-pockets.  No, these are skilled con-men that play a high stakes game.  What a fresh perspective in the fantasy genre!<br /><br />This novel seemed to swing back and forth between sweet and sour.  Parts of the story were brutal and dark; other parts were lighthearted and sweet.  These swings in tone didn't detract from the book.  What did detract from the book was the author's use of magic.  Its use is sparse, but not well thought out.  Any reader that dwells too much on its use may find that it ruins the story.<br /><br />I'm willing to give it a pass since the rest of the book was so imaginative and fun.  LOCKE LAMORA is a great start for Scott Lynch.  It's well worth the read.
0143038419|5.0|I'm amazed by how many people say they HATE this book.  Their reviews talk about how Gilbert is selfish, self-centered, spoiled, and arrogant.<br /><br />For goodness sake, angry people, it's a memoir.  It's written in the first person - it's all about her, which would, by nature, make it self-centered.  As far as her spoiled-ness goes, I try to make an active effort to not think about how much sadder my life is than other peoples'.  To say that she has no right to feel sorry for herself is what I would consider... spoiled.<br /><br />Okay, enough of that.<br /><br />I liked the book.  Some parts I could relate to, other parts I couldn't, but overall I consider it to be an upbeat and honest story.
B000021Y7X|5.0|For the music alone this is worth the price. Lively and fun mix of many of the best Talking Heads songs. The video adds extra interest and fun. There are three formats (stereo, and two 5.1 mixes).

1563523302|3.0|I had always heard about this book and was eager to finally read it.  Unfortunately it was somewhat disappointing.  The data is getting dated.  The message, while sound, is so oft repeated that it gets a little boring.  However, I enjoyed very much the passages dealing with how to (or more accurately - how not to) handle wealth issues and transfers with children.  Overall it is a book everyone should read, but I wish they would release a newer edition with more recent data, etc.

B000X418UE|5.0|I own the previous standard dvd and the new Blu-ray version is well worth the money. The standard dvd was not even anamorphic or enhanced for 16:9 tv's and the picture improvement is very noticable. I won't go over the story as most everyone has seen this, but the picture and sound both get 5 stars from me. It looks simply awesome on my 106\\" screen from my 1080p Mits front projector. This is a fun ride with a great cast. Go buy it and get your soda and popcorn! You won't be disappointed.

Also, the BBC version (as opposed to Discovery Channel) version, is narrated by David Attenborough, whose voice is perfect for this, and his narration is a more entertaining than Sigourney Weaver.  As much as I love the Discovery Channel, if you are deciding between the BBC version and the Discovery Channel version, get the BBC edition!!
B000UVV2DS|5.0|Deep Purple's two Concerto reenactment shows on 25th & 26th September 1999 were emotional performances captured in crystal clear, though sadly fractured fashion for DVD, video and CD release. Plenty is missing from the 'supporting' performances, but the final track-listing is at least quite similar to that used when the band toured the Concerto show around the world in 2000.<br /><br />The Albert Hall shows were recorded in their entirety in audio, but not on film. The cameras were only there for the second night, and even then were not at work for a section of the show. So, we're missing Ian Gillan's 'Via Miami' & 'That's Why God's Singing The Blues', and more frustratingly Steve Morse's 'Night Meets Light' & 'Take It From The Top'.<br /><br />The picture and sound quality on the DVD is, as expected, A1, and together with an excellent orchestral performance the show comes across as a brighter, cleaner and sharper DVD experience than the corresponding 1969 disc.<br /><br />It kicks off with two acutely emotive tracks from Jon Lord's 'Pictured Within' album, the title track sung by Miller Anderson, and 'Wait A While' by Sam Brown, an incredible performance. Ronnie Dio is as ever the consummate pro, shifting the evening up a gear by following a sublime 'Sitting In A Dream' (a Butterfly Ball track last tackled at the Albert Hall by Ian Gillan in 1975) with a rousing 'Love Is All'. Great fun, though I personally thought the latter lost a lot of punch by having the intro chords doubled up. Next, we're straight into Ian Paice's brass led version of 'Wring That Neck'. It's good mostly just to hear that riff being played again, but it still frustrates me that the rest of Deep Purple didn't join in. So near..<br /><br />The Concerto itself sounds clean and strong. The sheer variety of themes and ideas still surprises me, especially as to my ears classical music often consists of taking one flimsy idea and riding it relentlessly into the ground. Steve Morse's opening solo is way shorter than Blackmore's extended barrage in 1969, and also thinner sounding, lacking the warm Gibson guitar tone which sat so well on top of the orchestra (whether they liked it or not!)<br /><br />Deep Purple's own set sounds superb, though apart from the marvelous 'Smoke On The Water' free for all is filmed in a rather patchy fashion. A wide screen edition would do wonders to enhance the atmosphere of the recording, but sadly the DVD is strictly 4:3. It is also relatively old for a DVD release, there are no extras as you would now expect from an expensive production (the scope was surely endless), and I won't go on about the shoddy packaging....<br /><br />As a souvenir of the evening the Concerto '99 DVD still scores highly, though not as much as the corresponding CD.xtended barrage in 1969, and also thinner sounding, lacking the warm Gibson guitar tone which sat so well on top of the orchestra (whether they liked it or not!)

0312305060|4.0|This is a downer of a book. Though it is beautifully written and the concept of using \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" by Virginia Woolf as the template for the novel is a brilliant idea, the novel is depressing and deeply upsetting to read. Two suicides and a wannabe suicide are not what you want to encounter when you are depressed. What could have been a life-affirming book was doomed from the start. It's a lesson in how to squeeze the joy out of life and living, although the author would argue otherwise.<br />The three main characters inhabit three parallel stories in different eras: Clarissa Vaughan who is giving a party for her writer friend, Virginia Woolf who is in the midst of writing \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" while trying to fend off her mental anguish, and Laura Brown who is fighting to retain her sanity while preparing a birthday party for her husband. Cunningham, like Woolf, is obsessed by the passage of time and time's inner and external adumbrations.<br />The highlight of Woolf's novel is the party Clarissa Dalloway has been preparing for all day. In \\"The Hours\\" it is the aftermath of the aborted party for Richard that Cunningham highlights. Is the lesson of \\"The Hours\\" that a poet has to die so we, the living, value our own lives more?<br />The only character who is appealing in the book is Julia, Clarissa's lover.  Most of the characters are selfish, self-absorbed, desperate people. Some of them fear the hours going by out of their own mental instability. It's almost a casebook in various types of insanity. We read about exasperating, annoying people teetering on the edge of mental instability. Sexual ambiguity is a constant theme in the book. Two events in the novel have great impact and make Virginia Woolf and Mrs. Brown really perk up--when they kiss another woman. And, of course, Clarissa is in a long-time relationship with her lover Julia. Two sexually equivocal women are toppling out of their nests (homes) like birds falling out of their nests. Paradoxically, Cunningham has created real, three-dimensional characters.<br />Writing about ravaged people is almost as bad as reading about them. Like Hickey in \\"The Iceman Cometh\\" Cunningham has taken the kick out of the booze. Where is redemption in the book? We can wallow in the mental states of the deranged only so long before we slip into an abyss of melancholy ourselves.ed real, three-dimensional characters.

B000W7JWUA|3.0|I absolutely love this game, but being used to an (older) German version, I was very disappointed by the quality of the board tiles, which are made of thin cardboard (much sturdier in German version) and looked like they wouldn't make it through many game nights. Also, the game pieces for roads and towns were just little blocks of wood, while the pieces I am used to playing with actually look like roads in the country side and towns. The game is still great, of course, but it is obvious that they tried to produce it as cheaply as possible.
B0000TG9E2|5.0|This was a great gift for my niece for Easter. She really loves the colors in this dvd.
B00139W3NE|4.0|I have read all three books in the His Dark Materials series by Philip Pullman, and I enjoyed the entire series.  I also have read several articles on the making of The Golden Compass, so I was aware, very early on, that this film would end earlier than the book, and that the ending of THIS book would be the beginning of the NEXT movie.  Therefore, I was not as disappointed in the end of this film as many others apparently were.<br /><br />IMHO, the casting of this film is dead on:  Dakota Blue Richards shines as the very determined, single minded Lyra, Daniel Craig is very good as the slightly touched, windmill tilting Lord Asriel, Nicole Kidman is excellent as the true believer, yet evil Mrs. Coulter.  The entire supporting cast does a fine job as well.<br /><br />The cinematography and the animation are both very well done. The settings are truly gorgeous.  Live action and animation blend well, but do have noticeable differences.  This contrast adds to the fantasy element of the film and helps to keep the viewer firmly entrenched in the world of the story.<br /><br />Out of necessity, this movie hits the ground running and keeps up a fast pace.  The book is action-packed and filled with adventures; I imagine that there was much difficultly keeping the viewing time down to a reasonable length.  That being said, an audience who had not read the book could have a hard time keeping up.  I, at least, was able to fill in any gaps.<br /><br />I look forward to the next installment.  I believe that you will like this film, especially if you are a fan of fantasy/adventure stories. I highly recommend it.

B0000024Q8|5.0|Preamble - the wrong product description has snuck onto this page from a nearby alternative. Read for your own amusement.  I recommend to those who want to pursue the question of which \\"In C\\" to choose go over to the page for the Bang on a Can version, if only to read some other reviews that raise some significant issues. Among them: if one \\"learned\\" the piece in this version from 1968 (when major record companies were braver) and was like many others just bowled over by it, then you may consider it \\"definitive\\" -- and have kept it in your head -- much as your first exposure to a more traditionally notated piece that works for you may become frozen in the version you heard first.   Second, yes, I agree, this is first and foremost a performer's piece, a strangely introverted work that may seem to speak directly to its audience (the rules seem so simple), but still seems more about the interweaving of ensemble than aesthetic pleasure (as one reviewer says, one floats in and out while listening, i.e., is ruled by the trance element). \\"In C\\" is a improvisation within the tightest of boundaries, a pattern that happens to emulate the self-indulgence of bad soloing in jazz and popular music - audience thinks, come on, musicians, focusing on the movement to the next riff -- but the musicians think, wow, we've stayed in this cool riff combination for more than five seconds!  Someone also complained that the original sounds \\"too much like a gamelan.\\" Well, that would make sense historically, wouldn't it, if you think of the principles behind Riley (and others' music), and the growing interest in \\"world music\\" in the 1960s, and the sheer coolness of the gamelan (well, I played in a few, so maybe I'm also coming from a limited viewpoint).   I haven't heard this transfer, and suspect that the weaknesses in the original recording are if anything more obvious -- the acoustic space always seemed noisy or cramped, and that high-pitched piano pulse never sounded too great. But maybeit just needs to be treated like a modern historical recording (that I happen to like, whatever the sound).  One disappointment, sadly - despite the all-star ensemble, the live recording on New Albion has strange balances, and the percussion really is too present at times. The breathing dropouts and articulation changes stick out as well; the relative murk of the original analog recording covers those moments better, and thus lends even more of a classic sheen to the 1968 recording. The Bang on a Can may end up in my player someday, I'll admit, however.

The music is terrific and Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon give spellbinding performances.  This really is a 5 star movie but I am deducting one star as 20th Century Fox is basically performing a bit of a \\"gouging\\" of the customer here, because anyone that enjoyed this DVD enough to own it probably bought it last year in one of the earlier formats.  Funny enough, upon the initial DVD release, there were two versions - the basic, and a \\"collectors\\" version with all the great extras.  Now, only one year later the \\"collectors\\" version is made useless with this new \\"extended cut\\" but has many of the same extras. This should have been released last year.
B0002IQNAG|5.0|Even though George Romero is credited with the<br />birth of the modern-day zombie in 1968, it's real debut<br />can go all the way back to 1932 with White Zombie<br />featuring Bela Lugosi. But I think what Romero<br />introduced that got him the credit was the zombie's<br />cannibalistic need of living parts, be it flesh or brains<br />along with the disease factor of if you get bitten alive<br />you'll end up walking dead like them. It also didn't<br />hurt to be one of the first films to have a multi-racial<br />cast featuring an African-American as group leader<br />which of course in '68 was pretty rare indeed. Yeah,<br />Night Of The Living Dead deserves this honor even if<br />technically it isn't quite true.<br /><br />But it wasn't until almost ten years later Romero<br />really put the zombie in pop-culture with the much<br />heralded Dawn Of The Dead in 1978. This film took<br />the trapped survivor scenerio of NOTLD up a notch by<br />putting in the more modern day setting of a typical<br />American pleasure, the indoor shopping mall. DOTD,<br />while offering pretty much the same living character<br />design, this time made the zombies more in number,<br />appearance, and graphic actions. It was this film with<br />instead of it's shades of gray now bursting in bloody<br />color that put the Zombies on the map permanently.<br />It's a great film that not only fleshes out the characters<br />at a good pace (though at times it does seem a little<br />too detailed in that department), but truly shown that<br />zombism has no cultural bounds. Not only did the Americans<br />just eat up this new genre, but on the opposite side of the world, Europeans did so even more, especially the film-making members of Italy.<br /><br />When Romero wanted his film to be presented over there,<br />he enlisted the help of Italian filmaker Dario Argento to<br />re-edit it for Italian audiences. Argento slimed down bits<br />of comedy & slower dialouge, gave it a faster soundtrack, and<br />changed it's name to Zombi. This may have been one of the<br />most important effects this film ever could of have. Not only was the film an even bigger success overseas, but it inspired many<br />Italian filmmakers to continue what Romero started. Before<br />Romero even thought of his 1985 third installment Day Of The Dead, Italian director Lucio Fulci brought a year later his unofficial (yet honored by Romero himself) sequel called Zombi 2. This film showed what the worldwide Zombie outbreak was doing half a world away from that mall. But this time the zombies were far more graphic and the gore and pacing were turned up by leaps & bounds. It was this film along with Dawn that gaveway for the Italian Zombie craze of the 1980's. Like how the Italians created their own successful version of the classic American Western ten years earlier, they once again did it but with our Zombies. What followed was a barrage of great Zombie films that never seemed to be carbon copies of Romero's then two classics, but new ways of defining the genre. Unfortunately by '85 with Day Of The Dead, Romero seemed to be beaten at his own game by them with Day's lackluster audience response (though over time, it in itself has become the classic it deserves). But all of this couldn't of happened without Romero & his original update of Dawn Of The Dead. It was that film that launched a thousand ships filled with the living dead.<br /><br />...And now a review of the 2004 DVD Ultimate Edition Anchor Bay release:<br /><br />Without a doubt, this is one of the most exhaustive releases any one film has ever received, and it's completely deserved. The film that started the Zombie craze that still lives to this day, gets an amazing FOUR disc set that shows you every little piece of it's history and formations. With this set you get THREE different versions of the film: the US theatrical, the extended Directors Cut, and the rare Dario Argento European cut known as Zombi. Each versionhas it's own merit and differences that never, ever feels like release overkill. All has been fully remastered to the hilt, with different commentaries for each equally entertaining (though it would have been nice to have an Argento one for the European cut).

C'mon, it even comes with a comic book, for cryin' out loud! Now I know Anchor Bay/Starz is known for double-dipping their audience, but it has never been as necessary as this one. If you own any of their previous releases, sell them and add it to the pot to get this. Something of this quality to me has only been seen for a franchise, not a single film release, so you can tell just how impressive this set is.

0783230079|4.0|Good dvd about the after life.  Funny and makes you think about what can happen with reactions.  Good music and actors make a great dvd.
B00008PX8P|5.0|I love this DVD, every single part. I especially enjoy Earl's Court accoustic set, it is so beautiful and has the best version of That's The Way I have ever heard. I know a lot of people say they didn't sound so great at Knebworth, but if you can get pass the sight of Jimmy Page's pit stains it is a real treat. A definite must have for any Zeppelin fan!
B00005JKGO|3.0|I know this is a classic award winning movie, but to be honest I just didn't get it. I bought it to work on Italian language skills ( I study Italian at school) and this movie was mentioned in my textbook, so it served it purpose for that, but the movie itself was a bit beyond what I could appreciate.
B0001YRVN4|5.0|For many years, we have watched these movies, over and over on VHS.  They are my husband's favorites, along with the new movies to finish the story line.  It is wonderful to watch the 'whole' story in sequence.  These movies are 'keepers' for us and to keep them around for a long time, we replaced them on DVD, to watch them over and over in the future.
0634022296|5.0|This book is definitely a necessity for anybody who enjoys the work of the Beatles. All the songs are transposed well, and the chords used in the book are simplified when necessary, making playing along to the songs very easy and fun. There is just about every Beatles song in here except for a few cover songs like Anna and Twist and Shout, but other than that everything is there. For this price, you get a great bang for your buck. And for those who are new to guitar, this book will help you learn a lot of new and different chords that you might not otherwise.
0452289963|5.0|Before purchasing the A New Earth, I thought that people in the industrialized world and the world of technology were well on the way to destruction. I felt that I was rarely in touch with \\"the moment\\" though I knew how important it is to be present.  I found Echart Tolle with a  brilliant way of delivering his message in A New Earth. I find I am able to be aware of the ego in most instances in my relationship with others. The author systematically preents strategies that help the reader to actually become aware of thoughts and Presence. The content demands reflection in order to thoroughly process the message. This is one of the best books that I have ever read.
0786838655|5.0|My kids (8, 7, 5, 3) loved this book. We're on to the third in the series and they know so much more Greek mythology now. They role-play all the characters and want to learn ancient Greek. It was a good switch from the American Girl books we've read and the Magic Treehouse books, has really strong female and male characters. Loved that Percy has dyslexia and ADD, he's the hero! Also really appreciated that the two main chacters are a girl and a boy, working together. With both boys and girls in the house, I wanted to send the author some cookies as a thank you.... :)
B000ZN802W|2.0|I had not read Jon Krakauer's book, upon which this film is based, so I knew relatively little about Chris McCandless going into it. While the film did not motivate me to purchase Mr. Krakauer's book, it did motivate me to read (online) his 1993 Outside magazine article \\"Death of an Innocent\\" (a title that says much about Krakauer's take on the story) that was expanded into the book, and to search online for more information about Chris McCandless. There I found - among many postings: some labeling Chris McCandless a nut; others an inspirational visionary - several articles that examine Chris McCandless more objectively, I believe, than have Sean Penn or Mr. Krakauer. (In the last paragraph of this review, I identify those articles and indicate where they can be found online.) But neither this film nor anything that I have read has answered this question: What exactly did Chris McCandless do with his life for it to merit a book and a film?    The film, shot on many of the locations Chris McCandless visited, looks good and the cast is strong. But gone are the complexity and ambiguity of the story that Krakauer wove, and in its place Penn gives us what he sees, apparently, as the story of a hero for our times. How you react to this film will reflect, to a significant degree, the empathy or sympathy it generates for Chris McCandless. Because it generated little of either for me, I was never pulled into Penn's vision of the story, and that made a long film (2½ hours) seem, at times, endless.     Who, really, was Chris McCandless? Is his story that of an iconoclast's journey of self-discovery, of a visionary's search for truth, of a young man's coming of age, of a rigid idealist whose arrogance and foolishness were his destruction, of a troubled young man's descent into the abyss? You will find supporters of each view. Krakauer's strong identification with McCandless renders him less than objective, a fact that he admitted in an interview on NPR: \\"Most biographers at least pretend to be objective and unbiased, and I never pretended that.\\"  And as for Sean Penn, well, filmmakers have their own imperatives.     Indeed, what Krakauer crafted is a well-written brief in defense of Chris McCandless. He examines plausible pieces of the puzzle that is Chris McCandless, but he is selective in the ones he uses. (Many pieces are missing and always will be.)  Krakauer dismisses, without examining in any depth, the not unreasonable suggestion that McCandless - whose rigid idealism, impossibly high standards, hostility toward his parents and alienation from society could hardly be termed normal - may have suffered from an emotional/psychological problem. What led McCandless to feel as he did is a question to which no one appears to have the answer. To diffuse criticism that McCandless had gone foolishly unprepared into the Alaskan outback, Krakauer posited, and Penn embraced, that had McCandless not mistakenly eaten a poisonous plant, he would probably have survived his trek into the wilderness. That theory was effectively shot down by chemical analyses of the two plants in question. This led Krakauer, in 2007 on Oprah and on NPR, to modify his theory: He now posits that the seeds of the wild potato that Chris McCandless ate were covered in a mold that produced an alkaloid that prevented his body from digesting food. (The entry to that affect in the botanical field guide that McCandless is shown using in the film is a fabrication.) This new theory - for which there is less evidence than the one it replaces - makes clear how committed Krakauer is to the proposition that it was bad luck, not foolhardiness, that brought McCandless down. But the preponderance of evidence, objectively weighed, suggests otherwise. Given what he carried into the bush with him and what he found there in the way of food, it is more reasonable, based on the evidence, that McCandless was slowly starving from day one, losing ground by inches, not by yards, and increasinglyvulnerable to illness, accident, and miscalculation. If a calamity befell him, it was one of his own making: trying to hike out of the bush after about three months, finding the Teklanika River impassable where he had first crossed it, and, having refused to carry a map of the area, being forced to return to the bus and to slow starvation.     What is the message of Chris McCandless's story? Asked that question, Jon Krakaurer invoked a litany of New Age aphorisms: It is \\"about just doing something different. Get outside that comfort zone. Test yourself. Just don't be tempted to take the easiest path. Life is better when you step off that path, however far you step. Happiness is only real when shared.\\" Mr. Penn's assessment echoes these sentiments. But if that is the message, then I missed it. What I saw was the sad story of a privileged young man whose rigid idealism, hubris, and quest to \\"kill the false being within\\" (whatever that means) proved fatal, a story too narrow and too bizarre to have sweeping meaning. Sherry Simpson, in her essay \\"A Man Made Cold by the Universe,\\" put it more bluntly (I have thrice substituted for one of the phrases she used, so not to offend tender sensibilities and risk getting this review pulled): \\"This is what bothers me -- that Christopher McCandless failed so harshly, so sadly, and yet so famously that his death has come to symbolize something admirable. ...His death was not a brilliant screw-up. It was not even a terribly original screw-up. It was just one of the more recent and more pointless screw-ups.\\"      (A good jumping off point for online articles about Chris McCandless is \\"Out of the Wild\\" by Doug O'Harra, on farnorthscience.com. O'Harra's article provides links to a number of sources of information about the Chris McCandless story, including Jon Krakauer's 1993 article in Outback magazine; Krakauer's interview on NPR; Sherry Simpson's essay \\"A Man Made Cold by the Universe,\\" and what I found to be the most informative article, \\"The Cult of Chris McCandless\\" by Matthew Powers, which first appeared, in 2007, in Men's Journal magazine. It is Powers's article that is credited with prompting Krakauer to amend his poisonous plant theory. An excellent article available online is \\"I Now Walk into the Wild\\" by Chip Brown, first published in 1993 in The New Yorker. And an interesting analysis of aspects of the Chris McCandless story appears in \\"Into the Wild Debunked\\" on terraincognitafilms.com.)

B0013D8LOU|2.0|Ed Sanders and Helena Bonham Carter. Their interpretations of Sondheim, alhough I remember images of Angela Lansbury and the sound of her brillint voice, are all ace.<br /><br />Mr Depp lacks both the psysique and the voice to carry the role of Sweeney. It is adequate nothing more. The same goes for Tim Burton who seems to be long lost in the world of Gothic.... there are never any surprises.....<br /><br />Another letown is the bluescreen, matte etc.... It looks like you are watching a cartoon.... What happened to good old set work eyyyy??????<br /><br />The third letdown is that the virtues of this musical are strictly theatrical rather than cinematic... It doesn`t and DON`T make the travel to the screen easily. I love the world of musical; but when Anthony Hope leaves Johanna singing after being kicked - it`s just too much....<br /><br />On the screen is looks silly...<br /><br />And ..... why couldn`t they give the lead of Sweeney to an actor with a singingtalent??? In the 60s and 70s - the musical genre died out due to facts including the chorus only being in trained voices(Camelot comes to mind for one) and overlong and overbudgeted products(Hello Dolly, Song of Norway, On a Clear Day You Can See Forever....)<br /><br />But great orchestrations and the three actors mentioned remains a treat.

B0013BNY2Q|3.0|Don't fall for the hype. This is not a major return to form, what it is is a good album, certainly better than the last few but not in the same class as Automatic For The People. It gets off to a poor start with the first two tracks perhaps the worst on the album. With resequencing these to the end, or off altogether, little would be lost and the remainder would be better served. To sum up, 3 stars is a little harsh, however 4 would be overly generous. I hope this marks the beginning of a return to previous heights but more work is needed for this to happen.
0143038419|1.0|I could barely stand to read this book. I only read it because it was a book club choice. After the kudos it has gotten I at first felt like there was something wrong with me when I didn't like the book, the author, or anything she stood for. As a woman who did not have children, I at first felt some sympathy with her about not wanting children, but then the way she went about dealing with that issue was pretty selfish. She is a narcissistic person and I do not believe that she really experienced anything valuable (or teaches a thing) with her travel experiences and that rings loud and clear through her whiny \\"poor me\\" voice. To quote another reader, she is very annoying. Don't waste your money!
B0002ADY24|4.0|Firefly introduces John Lawton, Heep's second singer, who has a great voice.  Overall this album (and the others with Lawton) has more of a bluesy/soul kind of feel - it reminds me of the early Whitesnake and David Coverdale stuff of the same period.  I'd like to point out here that, after the first 3 albums, Uriah Heep never really put out a constantly \\"heavy\\" album, (in fact, almost all the remasters I have have Mick Box saying \\"not one of our heavier efforts . . .!\\"), but this one is a little more hard-rocking than the others with Lawton.  Overall, it's a great late-70's hard rock disc.
B000I2J6K0|5.0|It's nice to have an option that truly gets the heart rate up!  I only wish the workout portion was a bit longer --- the main workout section is 40 minutes and that includes warm-up and cool down.  My recommendation is if you don't get all the moves the first time around, try again the next day and the next.  It gets easier and you WILL feel results.  Plus the more you play it, the more you can focus on other things she is saying besides just the movement of the exercise, such as what muscles you should truly be engaging, like the obliques for example.  If you're looking for something easy, there are plenty of other options out there.  This is challenging, but I wouldn't say difficult.

0739311123|5.0|I am a high school teacher, and I teach many reluctant readers.  I bought this audio book to play to my students during class, which didn't take long.  The book is loadede with literary devices, figurative language, and all kinds of things that I must teach in my curriculum.  My students love it.  It has a good lesson behind it, and very few offensive words are used in the book.  Mitch Albom's voice is very appealing for reluctant listeners, too.  I highly recommend this activity to any teacher looking for something for their own students.  There are tons of activities online to accompany this book as well.
B00009P1O2|5.0|I know I'm a little late to be doing a review on this concert, but not too late. I've had this disc for years and it is still my favorite rock concert to date.  And Queen isn't my favorite band by any means.  U2 is my favorite band.  This concert is loose, funny, and yet serious all at the same time.  It was filmed in 1986 before digital studio cameras and multi Jumbotrons were around. I,m actually surprised to see the one in this concert.  If you have seen the other Queen concerts from 1981-82 the light show was all they needed.  Todays concerts are full of Giant L.E.D. screens and laserlights galore.  I liked most all of the songs in this concert. After all it is their Magic Tour concert so I knew they could not fit in classic songs like \\"Sombody to Love\\" and \\"Play the Game\\".  Seeing Freddy play the piano is as enjoyable as anything.  This concert is well recorded and sounds great especially in DTS.  The picture looks very good for not being filmed digitally.  It's not widescreen, but how many concerts are widescreen filmed before 1999?  I have to say that Queen, U2, The Beatles, Rolling Stones are the four greatest bands ever.  This disc is proof of that.  Do buy this concert 2 disc set!!!
B0013BNY2Q|4.0|In their early days, REM was basically a great little garage rock band. These are the roots they return to on Accelerate. The band rocks harder than on any record since Monster - but this time they're less moody and gloomy. Yes, the running time is a bit short (34 minutes), but there's something to be said for leaving the listener wanting more. The last song, I'm Gonna DJ, sums up the spunky attitude of the band throughout Accelerate. \\"Hey steady, steady, I don't want to go until I'm good and ready,\\" Stipe sings in a life-affirming statement of purpose. And the CD's done.     Like all the best REM records, there are some hidden gems that catch you by surprise, like Sing for the Submarine (the 9th track), which might be my favorite song after about four listens of the CD.    My only gripe is the production. The sound is rough around the edges, befitting the back-to-basics approach, but it's too cluttered and could use more breathing room. Still, for those who like the rock `n roll REM of Reckoning, Life's Rich Pageant and Document, it would be hard to wish for a stronger comeback.

I got Bourne #3 as have the other two and wanted to complete collection. If you are reading this, you know the Bourne film series plot, characters and plot twists, so concentrating on what this HD DVD offeres Vs standard def DVD.  The interactive features (VW promo, be a spy-game) are ok, not essential)  Where this disc shines and more than worth the $20 price is in its \\"U Control\\" features (aka Java-type pop up info). A massive jump from first Bourne HD DVDs bonus features (best being the Paris appartment fight scene), #3 from the opening seconds piles info, interviews and technical data onto your TV screen.   Best seen to believe, have shown this HD DVD to an engineer friend and the train station & intelligence intercept on-screen data stunned him.  Bottom line: if you have a HD DVD player, $20 and want to see just how amazing a film can look, sound and be packed with fascinating extras, get this!

Boy, am I glad that I waited until I had the time to enjoy it.  The writing was great, the story line was taut and the action flowed from beginning to end.  The characters stayed true to their nature, a few of them have grown from first book to now, and... well, I don't want to give any of the story away!!    There are a few intricate parts here that make the whole story more enjoyable, so I would read this when you have the time to actually do so.  Skipping over paragraphs could really zap some of the meat out of this story.    I highly recommend - books with heroes like these and such complex villains are hard to come by.    I hope you enjoy this book as much as I did!    All the best,    Jay
B000MXPE7O|1.0|THIS CONTAINS SPOILERS!    I hated this movie.  From the start, the movie (while portraying itself and a historically based drama) plays with history to make a politically motivated piece, designed to mislead those without a working knowledge of history.    Within the first 20 minutes, I was worried what the film was going to portray.  Damon's character is contacted by a General William Sullivan, who has been tasked by the President (FDR) to create a secret service, knowing that the US will eventually be pulled into WWII.  He tells Damon that the soon to be OSS wants Ivy League Blue Bloods like him, not 'jews, negroes or Catholics.\\"  Sullivan smiles and essentially states that he can say the latter because he's a Catholic.    The man who created the OSS was William Donovan.  The writer plays with the Irish names but the character is Donovan. However, the portrayal of Donovan is purposefully wrong:  Donovan wasn't anti-Jewish, anti-black or Catholic.  He is famous for allowing anyone, from right wing to Communist into the OSS as he was dedicated to destroying Nazism.  This is something I have gleaned from reading at least 3 OSS books, one of them written by a man who was an admitted 60's activist who idolized Donovan because while he never limited himself by ideology (he was a a Republican who FDR trusted), he just wanted to defeat Nazism.  Thus, from the outset, the movie is falsely portraying the creator of the OSS, the precursor of the CIA, as racist, anti-semetic and intolerant.      Damon's Character:    Is cold and unemotional throughout most of the movie, except when he falls for the deaf girl.  This is done to let the viewer know that the future CIA betrayer has a soul.  Their most significant date is at an almost all black jazz club in 1940.  Thus, Damon's character (who eventually betrays the Bay of Pigs operation) isn't a traitor: he's a tolerant man who loves disabled women and is caught up in circumstances beyond his control, where he finally sees the truth.    Damon's character is cold, unable to relate to his own son.  As a a father he is purposefully distant, seeing fighting Communism as more critical than raising his son.  This means CIA are all cold and distant, Therfore, their mission (defeating Communism) is improper.    Angelina Jolie:    Her character plays an odd dual role:  she is Damon's unloved wife: mother of a child of a night of passion but never truly loved by Damon who's true love is a deaf woman.      Her role is not appropriate to her stature in Hollywood (a stature I disagree with).  In this movie, it is manipulation for the director, DeNiro, who plays with her fame:  how can Matt Damon ignore such a hot woman (Jolie) for a less attractive deaf one?   Jolie got Brad Pitt but she is incapable of winning Damon's character's heart.  He must be cold.  To make matters worse, he cheats on Jolie with a matronly German at a time when he purely hates Communists.  HE MUST he nuts if he wants an ugly German over a hot Jolie.    Viva Cuba:    Damon eventually betrays the Bay of Pigs invasion which would have overthrown Castro but Hollywood has romanticized Castro and Che, so the decision (of Damon) to betray the US in ordder to assist Castro is forgiveable and endlessly romantic.      Pure Propoganda:    As 'Sullivan' becomes more anti-Communust, he admits to suffering more and more to diabetes, which requires them to chop off his legs: thus, America is rotting from its fixation on Anti-Communism.       To add to this 'subtle' rotting analogy, there comes a the Soviet defector.  After being injected with LSD, he launches into a soliloquy where the defector admits the USSR is a paper tiger with no spare parts and no ability to fight; it's a creation of the 'military industrial complex' (yes, the Soviet uses the Eisenhower phrase) to maintain the  power of said complex... therefore, the Cold War is a hoax:  they were never a threat, just a pawn in the game of the Capitalist Industrialists!    This, of course, ignores the 70's where Communism spread worldwide.  A country with no spare parts somehow sustains a 10 year war in Afghanistan, requiring Reagan to authorize the dispatch of Stinger missiles to win the war. It ignores the 1956 invasion of Hungary, the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia, the relentless efforts to turn Vietnam, Cambodia, Nicaragua, Ethiopia and many other nations into Communist pawns or the endless violations of SALT I, II and the ABM treaty.   Millions suffered under the yoke of communism, yet the Communists are innocent?  Preposterous.  Why is it I know of no Conservative who fails to conclude Nazism was an evil yet I can find Liberals who will defend Communism?     This movie exploits our short memories. DeNiro's position is that the Cold War was never a hot one, so the Communists were never a real threat.  This sickens me and anyone who knows how Eastern Europe suffered, but their names are hard to spell, so who cares.  At least, that is De Niro's view.  Is it yours?

B000E1ZBGS|4.0|Over the years, there have been different film versions of Jane Austen's novel \\"Pride and Prejudice.\\" I enjoy the diverging portrayals of the House of Bennet, where the Salic Law prevails, for new insights into the array of characters can always be gleaned. It is like visiting the same family in different seasons. I must admit that to me the 1995 BBC version was so excellent that I thought nothing else could compare, which is why the viewing of the 2005 rendition was postponed until a couple of days ago. With stunning cinematography and meticulously detailed sets, it is a highly entertaining production. Keira Knightley, although she is too thin for period roles when women were more fleshy, played the part of Elizabeth quite well. The other sisters and Mrs. Bennet were very well-cast. Donald Sutherland utterly stole the show. Sutherland's Mr Bennet seems to be in his own world yet he is really more in tune with everything that is going on than poor distracted Mrs. Bennet. That is especially evident from the way he goes over and comforts poor Mary at the Netherfield ball.    The musical score is quite romantic, capturing the desperation of young love obstructed by such obstacles as money and status. The attraction between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy is more palpable than ever, although they hardly ever touch except when dancing. Those days of strict boundaries and protocols certainly make for some great love stories.    In the 2005 version, the Bennets seem more like yeomen farmers than landed gentry, with pigs running through the house, and shabby dresses. Were the Bennets really that poor? Maybe they were. On the other hand, Mr. Darcy is raised to the peerage, living at Chatsworth like the Duke of Devonshire. The Darcys were a distinguished and wealthy family but I doubt that they had the Elgin marbles in the parlor. This was only a minor distraction (along with the few weak attempts at vulgar humor) in a wonderful film which brings the viewer into the world of the late1700's, the world of Jane Austen, when young men knelt to ladies when proposing marriage, and being a penniless old maid was the fate worse than death.

0452289963|5.0|I am so honored to be receiving such insight and enlightenment by such a caring, wise man!! His book has led me to so many wonderful breakthroughs about myself and the world around me. I can only imagine how much I would have to pay a therapist for years of sessions and discussions for information I learned in just a few short weeks!!  Phenomenal!!  Amazing!!!  Beautiful!!  I would recommend it to everyone, young and old, rich or poor.  Absolutely everyone should read it!!!  Thanks to Eckhart for being willing to be a vessel of light and change and Oprah for featuring this in her book club...how many people might not have known about it, if not for her!!!    A.

B000002H5I|5.0|Tracy Chapman's first album is a rare classic.  Each song tells a story, and alot of subject matter is covered.  Everything from love, heartbreak, politics, fascism, poverty, and spousal abuse.  Wow, take a deep breathe.  I like how each song tells a story, almost like a painting.  The song \\"Talkin' 'Bout A Revolution\\" kicks off the album.  This song reminds me how naive we all were in 80's, thinking this world would or could change for the better.  Ending poverty sounds like an ideal concept but it's like fighting the powers that be, and actually things seem like they have gotten worse since 1988.  The rich get richer and the poorer get poorer.  The whole concept of this album that I think Tracy Chapman was trying to convey is hope.  Trying to come from nothing and become something, anything.  Build from the ground up.  I dedicate \\"Mountains O' Things\\" to Oprah.  When I heard the song recently it reminded me of her.  Like the lyric \\"draggin' my furs on the ground\\".  It really makes a clear statement of fascism and how we all are caught up in the rat race called life.  The deep subject matter Tracy Chapman sings about is what makes her Tracy Chapman.  It's pretty dark but she tells a story and makes it beautiful music.
B0013BNY2Q|5.0|I've been a loyal REM fan for 25+ years. This is their 15th studio release and it is easy to say it's their best since \\"New Adventures in Hi-Fi\\" from 1996. At that point to me \\"New Adventures\\" was the best since \\"Green\\" in 1988 but that doesn't mean their other works were without merit. How many bands over the course of 25+ years put out one superior album after another? If you are a true fan you take each release, listen to it and just let the music \\"hit you\\". With that said let's look at \\"Accelerate\\".  \\"Living Well Is The Best Revenge\\" is a great quick paced, bouncy opening track.  \\"Man-Sized Wreath\\" is a hard Pearl Jam styled rocker.  \\"Supernatural Superserious\\" is the first single and harks back to the old REM days ala \\"Reckoning\\".  \\"Hallow Man\\" is a steady early REM styled alt rocker.  \\"Houston\\" is a dark haunting ballad with a great organ dirge sound.  \\"Accelerate\\" is a quick paced, bouncy alt rock that could be a raidio single with no problem.  \\"Until The Day Is Done\\" is the lightest track on the disc. It's an acoustic ballad with an \\"Old West\\" feel.  \\"Mr. Richards\\" takes the old style alternative sound fashioned by REM and moves it into the 2000's style of todays new alternative sound.  \\"Sing For The Submarine\\" is a hard progressive number in the vein of \\"Radiohead\\". My favorite track on the disc.  \\"Horse To Water\\" is another quick paced alt rocker that the \\"Moshers\\" will love!!  \\"I'm Gonna DJ\\" closes the disc with yet another quick paced \\"Green Day\\" styled alt rocker.  At only some 34 minutes it ends much too quickly but that's probably a good thing for if it was filled with sub-standard fare for the sake of time it would lose its ranking as one of their best ever. More is not always better.  If you are a REM fan or looking for a place to start with the band you will not go wrong with this 5 Star effort.
B000VWYJ8Q|3.0|The original Bourne books are about a man who risks all to go undercover to take on the world's greatest assassin (Carlos the Jackal). While there are problems with the agency due to the amnesia, misunderstandings, and some traitors, the overall tone is that the CIA and the USA are the good guys. Another distinction from the movie is that David Webb voluntarily becomes Jason Bourne--not just at first, but also again when needed to protect his friends. Webb must call on his \\"Bourne\\" persona to provide him the focus, skills, and determination to do what it takes to succeed.    English director Paul Greengrass regurgitates Bourne to give us the nauseatingly overused character of the hero being a \\"VICTIM\\" of some kind of CIA brainwashing done by rogues at the agency. These rogues are clearly supposed to be connected to--and sanctioned by--the \\"top\\" (read: Bush administration). In Greengass' version, the CIA has put together a team of assassins to go around killing undesirables--even US citizens. Unsurprisingly, there are scenes of Bourne undergoing some kind of \\"waterboarding\\" treatment to force him to continue after he has volunteered for the program and then changed his mind. How *YAWN* predictable.    Why Hollywood feels it is necessary to unceasingly inject this twisted, dark view of the USA and the CIA into movies is beyond me. I know that European audiences swoon when the USA is portrayed as some kind of dark force in the world led by sinister, shadowy groups. And indeed, Hollywood chasing Eurodollars to put Euro butts in Euro theater seats might be the part of the motivation. But the long-run effect is that Greengrass uses his prodigious talent to convey a poisonous view of the USA to the world by constantly presenting audiences with larger-than-life movie images of the same drivel that leftist journalists and editors love to insert into their \\"objective\\" news. The unfortunate truth is that sinister agencies and dark, shadowy groups are a ubiquitous part of Europe's history (as well as Asia's and Africa's). They are NOT part of the USA's history--except in the vivid imagination of some detached, ivory-towered professors and radical Leftists. Of course--they are usually the same.    Hollywood likes to pretend--and try to make the rest of us think--that it bravely speaks \\"truth to power.\\" But the consequences to \\"brave\\" Hollywood and leftist directors are none. Just lots of profits and a smug sense of satisfaction. If they really want to dip their toes in real courage (and I mean a little dip), they might try the following characters: A good CIA hero who seeks to protect people from true evils in the world; a selfish, misguided journalist who causes the death of thousands by exposing a top-secret CIA program; a greedy trial-lawyer who fabricates evidence and uses junk science to take on corporations that are actually providing a benefit (like life-saving medicines); an American soldier who is psychologically stable, truly brave, understands the larger goals, is not only in the military because he comes from a broken background, and is no kind of victim whatsoever.    The director who made a movie with these characters would risk no longer being able to get invited to the cool parties, would NEVER win the Oscar for it, and would begin to be subtly blacklisted (such as having articles written inferring that he is being paid by the CIA, is racist, going crazy/senile, or other such things). Just look at the hatchet job done on Mel Gibson for daring to make a religious movie.    The original books had a far more satisfying story than the movies and had plenty of intensity. They have sold amazingly well. If it needed updating, Carlos could have been re-created as a radical terrorist. But that would have offended certain audience groups. The only group it is safe to offend is non-Leftist Americans.    The movie is well-made, action-packed, and thoroughly engaging. Greengrass is truly a talented director. I only wish he were brave enough to take on the Hollywood establishment and speak truth to power--the power here being the ridiculously rich Hollywood elite.
B0014BECF8|3.0|This is kind of a lame release, simply because it's so similar to his earlier Greatest Hits album and because it has some fairly glaring omissions and some similarly strange inclusions, and his limited back catalog doesn't exactly warrant the need for TWO separate Greatest Hits releases, but you can't really argue the fact that these are amazing songs.<br /><br />My one real problem with the collection is the Re-Mastering on songs like \\"Heal the Pain\\" (one of my personal favorites) where they felt the need to re-record the vocal track, and he didn't even try to sing it with the same tone or inflections, plus his voice sounds considerably older now, which means it now sounds like an entirely different song altogether - and not nearly as good. Maybe there was a problem with the original vocal track when it came time to Re-Master? I'm not sure, but I'd rather have the old analog version with less than perfect audio than this beastly recreation.<br /><br />Other than that, it's a pretty great record from start to finish.
0805083367|5.0|My boys love this whole series of books - they both sing along while we read them and actually start singing them spontaneously in the car or while playing. The artwork is amazing - just like the others in the series! My only wish is that this was in board book format!
B000WZAE1I|5.0|It's like the Saturday matinees I remember from my youth. What a great lot of fun! I'm not generally a fantasy movie guy, but this one was a kick! DeNiro almost steals the show as a twinkle-toes pirate who puts on the ARGHHH! for the crew. And the rest includes, a humanoid star (yes, as in the heavens), wicked witches, wacky dead princes, a ruthless (living) brother of theirs and various assorted goats and \\"girls\\". Excellent special effects! I didn't know what to expect and finally put it on one afternoon. I'm really glad I did. It's not every day a 67-year-old can feel like he's 12 again!
1400063515|5.0|There has been much criticism of Mr. Taleb's trashing of Nobel laureates, but like it or not, he accurately predicted Long Term Capital Management's (LTCM) demise; the same LTCM founded by Nobel laureates with their sophisticated forecast models and portfolio theories, ignoring the possibility of extremely rare events (black swans) that could potentially wipe out their business as it happened in 1998.  And like it or not, Nassim Taleb has made a fortune in the securities market by practicing what he preaches, especially on Black Monday (October 1987).  His signature investment strategy results in long dry spells capped by monstrous returns.  \\"If you lose money on a steady basis and then make money in a lumpy way, people think you're crazy,\\" he once said.    Mr. Taleb's model comprises an L shaped curve (fat tail in quant jargon) following the power law distribution, with rare occurrences dominating the outcome of important events.  A \\"Black Swan\\" is, therefore, not only a rare event, but a most influential one as well.  Taleb claims most important events that shaped our history were results of such occurrences.  He has a particular disdain for Gaussian bell shaped curves, which he perceives as ill equipped to handle a world mired in extreme events he calls \\"Extremistan\\".  Bell curves are for a hypothetical world he dubs \\"Mediocristan\\".  We are programmed to make inferences quickly, with low tolerance for the unknown, owing it to our relatively primitive past environment when we worried about \\"new wild animals\\", new enemies and abrupt weather changes.  Hence the tendency to fall into the traps of (summarized by DAVID A. SHAYWITZ whose review of \\"The Black Swan\\" was published in the WSJ on April 24, 2007):    \\"Confirmation bias (our tendency to reaffirm our beliefs rather than contradict them), narrative fallacy (our weakness for compelling stories), silent evidence (our failure to account for what we don't see), ludic fallacy (our willingness to oversimplify and takegames or models too seriously), and epistemic arrogance (our habit of overestimating our knowledge and underestimating our ignorance).\\"    Mark Spitznagel, Taleb's chief trader, describes Taleb as \\"95% philosopher, 5% trader.\\"  Taleb's theories, however, apply overwhelmingly to the financial markets.  If we accept the premise that most people are risk averse and look for stability and security in life more than anything else, the application of Mr. Taleb's theories would be limited to the relatively small pool of the world population interested in flying jets rather than driving BMWs.

B000RMQH30|4.0|Perhaps I was a little harsh when I gave Ben Harper's last album [[ASIN:B000EGEKWE Both Sides of the Gun]] a three-star rating. The problem I had with that album was that, well, I realize that Ben changes his style quite often (especially evident by sometimes doing collaborations with different backing bands for entire albums), but the songs on that album were a little TOO different from one another. Thankfully, things flow more smoothly on Lifeline.<br /><br />Ben hooked back up with the Innocent Criminals this time around, and it's a good thing he did because the songs are excellent. Well, actually, the album's opener \\"Fight Outta You\\" has him singing in a very unorthodoxly low voice, but if you skip past that, you'll find quality in tunes like \\"Fool for a Lonesome Train\\", \\"Heart of Matters\\" and \\"Younger Than Today\\". And although \\"Needed You Tonight\\" isn't spiritual, the vocals still take me back to the There Will Be a Light days.<br /><br />The instrumental track \\"Paris Sunrise #7\\" is also good, even better when it successfully flows into the title track. You won't need a lifeline to help you find great music after hearing this album, so check it out.<br /><br />Anthony Rupert
0195145925|2.0|I would like to know in person Julian Barbour. His narrative is very good, and he definetively motivates the interested reader. However, my impression is that he took good care of the first chapters of \\"The end of time\\", whereas the last part of the book dedicated to quantum gravity and DeWitt equation was written quite fast and without care.   The beginner get confused. And if you are a physicist, or engineer with some knowledge of modern physics, you cannot grasp the essence. It is too qualitative.  It would be interesting if any of these guys that claim to understand relativity and field theory target a book to a regular exact science professional.  Nevertheless, I recommend the book to the reader interested in physics; it is motivating.
B000KX0IOA|5.0|Beautifully shot and wonderful storytelling. Helps to teach the concept of passive resistance over violence to enact change in governments, society, and even the current youth culture.

When I first started listening to the book I didn't think it was what I was looking for then it grabbed me. Everyone in the world should read or listen to this book. It is a book that could literaly change the world into a better place. We are far to complacent to accept the world \\"as is\\". I plan to tell as many people about this book as possible and do my part to change the world one person at a time starting with me.

B0007PALZ2|5.0|Warning: spoilers.<br />To anyone who, like me, is prone to muse that great movies are not made in modern times, I would recommend 12 Monkeys.  I re-watched this movie last night for the first time in years and it gave me chills it was so beautiful.  Not as a science-fiction film so much.  For me the movie is probably the most effective, most highly wrought and strangest love story ever told.  For me the real core of the movie is the love betwen Kathryn Railly and James Cole.  It begins subtly, with Railly as the authority figure psychiatrist saying to the drugged and drooling violent mental patient James Cole \\"Haven't I seen you someplace?\\"<br />  In the beginning, Cole's story that he has come from the future is seen as a paranoid schizophrenic delusion.  His reality is treated lightly and derided by the complacently-in-control but somehow basically like-able and fetching Railly (Madeline Stowe, in a stunning and classic screen performance)<br />  Gradually, Cole's reality becomes compelling for Railly.  She begins losing her grip on her own, smugly-complacent reality picture.  At the very same time, Cole begins to reject his own grim reality, because he is falling in love with Railly and now wants to believe that his story of having come from a grim future is a fantasy.  This plot structure is so beautifully worked out it is mindblowingly beautiful.  A prime example of how story-telling is an evolving art form.  The stories of yesteryear were rarely this complex and affecting.  You always had to stifle a yawn while watching Romeo and Juliette.  But these star-crossed lovers are such an unwittingly beautiful odd-couple it brought continuous chills of art appreciation.  As Railly glues an absurd fake mustache to Cole's upper lip - to go with his wig and loud red Hawaiian shirt - she whispers \\"I remember you this way\\" and though they share an exquisitely tender moment - in the lobby of an all-night movie theater playing Hitchcock films - they do not kiss.  Just thinking about it makes me start to get broken up.  It is only in the final scene in the airport that they exchange one, brief, almost embarrassed kiss, rigged out in their wigs and cruisewear, become the absurd and yet extremely dramatic versions of themselves that have haunted Cole's dreams for as long as he can remember.  This is great writing.  It is an example of how most of the truly great storytelling today is happening in movies, not in books.  Books are awash in mediocrity and pretentiousness.  The publishing industry festers to its core and has been overrun by people with such degenerate taste that it can be truly said that bad is the new good.  However sometimes in movies you get true high art.  I cannot conceive of a better, more touching love story than that between Kathryn Railly and James Cole.  Thank you Mr. And Mrs. Peoples.  Thank You.about it makes me start to get broken up.

B000HEYVD6|4.0|Great story. Baldacci uses a great sense of world affairs and superbly wrought characters to keep the pages turning in this espionage, political, action story. The only thing I would critique would be the passages where Mr. Baldacci attempts to educate his readers on the finer details of Islam. At times the story got a bit textbookish in that regard. Also, some of the foreshadowing ended up tipping the writers hand so that I was able to predict the events before I read them. Notwithstanding, the stiil was well conceived and was a real page-turner.

0525950079|4.0|I was so excited to receive this book for Christmas and I read it right away, but without the same enthusiasm as Pillars of the Earth. Mr. Follett is still a magician when it comes to breathing life into a myriad of characters, but I got tired of the frequent sex scenes. I guess I wanted more construction, less dalliance. Still, the book is great. The details about the plague and the theories behind its cause and treatment are especially well done.
B00004VVNB|4.0|I liked this movie when it first came out and for me it hasn't lost its appeal. It's a story of a post-apocalyptic future where in an enclosed city a vast computer network takes care of its inhabitants every need...up to a certain point. Human life has little value here past a specific age and those who try to escape risk the rath of the the Sandman, a police unit designed to eliminate runners. Until one day, a Sandman is given the assignment to find out about a place called Santuary...
6305882592|4.0|I've heard about this film for years but somehow never saw it till now.  I'm sure that if I'd seen it when it came out in the early 70's I would have adored it. Now....well, it is dated.  The themes which were very important in those breakaway years are a little old now.      We see a young, very disturbed man, trying to get his mother's attention by various stagings of suicides.  She is a wealthy socialite whose values Harold despises.  She buys him a Jaguar but he prefers driving an old hearse.  She arranges him to meet girls but he succeeds in acting so wierd that they all run away.  We are supposed to hate her and feel sorry for him...but after a while I was more sympathetic to her than I knew the film intended.  He really is a putz!      His only interest, beyond staging suicides is attending funerals.  This is where he meets his match--Maude, a frisky woman on the verge of turning 80.  We don't know how old Harold is, exactly.  To me he looked like a very young teenager.  Maude loves life as much as Harold seeks death so she teaches him to dance, to sing, to play music, smoke dope, drink and ultimately to make love.  Obviously she is the antithesis of his mom.  Maude somehow has the knack for driving any car she picks up on the street and has no compunction about taking them.  That's part of her \\"live free!\\" agenda.  Again, all of this was wonderful during the years the picture was made.  We see photos of Nixon and Pope Paul (the grim one) and Freud on the walls of various experts he is sent to consult.  We get the message loud and clear---this is a time to throw off traditional authority and go for it.    The cast is great.  Ruth Gordon, a one-of-kind herself is perfect for the role of Maude.  (She was married to a much younger man, in \\"real life.\\")  Bud Cort is excellent as Harold--at first so repressed and then gradually coming to life.  When you first see the hints of a smile on his mask like face, you really do want to cheer.    Obviously there are a whole lot of people who love the film and if you think you might be one of them, after reading a variety of reviews, then go for it.  Personally about halfway through I got a little tired of the increasingly zany antics Maude would pull and they ceased being charming and cute.  I lived through those times and I can appreciate the message but enough, already!

0517122707|1.0|I'm about a third of the way through and it's slow-going. I keep waiting for the uproarious comedy and scathing insight promised by this book's glowing reviews. Nothing yet.   The sections of the book written by the character Ignatius are at least readable; a take on modern life provided by a misanthropic medievalist is kind of interesting. But that's not enough to justify the $15 I paid for my copy. Be warned - if you're intent on reading it, borrow a copy from the library.

B000PC1N54|3.0|If it were not for the Triumphal Scene, this production could be forgotten.  It was poorly filmed.  You were distracted when scenes changed by flimsy material blowing in front of the cameras.  The processional was truly fantastic, well orchestrated, and grand opera at its ultimate.  Who said you need animals for this scene?      All in all, the music is always grand, the set was very good, but the direction and filming leave a lot to be desired.  I am surprised the La Scala audience was not letting their usual vocal reactions be heard!  Perhaps it was edited!
B00005JOFQ|5.0|Aside from all the negative issues about this movie, it was one of the saddest love stories I've ever seen. After seeing the movie, I read the short story it was based on. Movie was very true to the story. This story was very moving, and I recommend seeing it for all who have been  hesitant. The gay issue was handled very tastefully. In fact, as you watch the movie, this issue will take a back seat to the real story about two lonely people who weren't experienced in love relationships, and together found the closeness they were missing in their lives.

I highly recommend this book to anyone who sincerely is seeking an improvement in their marriage through opening up their lines of communication!

O.K. so no one in a small, mostly white, obviously corrupt town don't bat an eye.  Without giving away the whole story, I will not mention some coincidences that made no sense to me.  I guess I miss the hard characters who have a bit of depth and some philosophy about life in general.

Even though the movie would have you believe that it takes place in Alabama, it was shot in Julliette, Georgia, a little north of Macon, and they still serve fried green tomatoes.  Y'all come and eat you some, they're delicious..<br /><br />Jessica Tandy is simply superb as a resident of a nursing-home, reliving her life to a  an unhappy housewife who is a happenstance visitor.<br /><br />Highly recommended for any one who has friends or family in a nursing home and fans of  Jessica Tandy.<br /><br />Cicely Tyson has about five seconds of time in the movie.  I don't know why they bothered.  You can ignore all that racial scatalogical matter, that's just Hollywood.<br /><br />Gunner, April, 2008
B0013BNY2Q|4.0|So everyone's saying Accelerate is, if not a return to form, at least a good hard driving album that sounds like an REM album, rather than an adult contemporary band inspired by equal parts REM and Air Supply. This seems true, and I quite like the album, but, like Monster from 1995, this album seems to be rocking out in quotation marks. If, as the Angela Carter has said, the \\"performance perfectly simulated an improvisation,\\" then this album perfectly simulates a rock album by a rock band. But there's something just a little, well, studied about it. Like me: If I study hipness and hard living enough, I can sound just like my students, fit in with them on Facebook, drop references in class that astonish them with my currency. But I'm still a slowly aging nerd.

B000UGG39Q|5.0|I was introduced to Down quite by chance. Someone had bought their first LP, NOLA and didn't dig it, and wanted to move it. So I took a listen and after the first song knew I had to have it. As any Down fan knows, NOLA is one of the great hard rock albums of the last decade. I didn't think they could improve on it, and while Over the Under doesn't eclipse it, it comes damn close. What I like about Down is they are evolving with each recording. Bustle in Your Hedgerow was a pretty varied release, but it has some serious classics on it - Lysergik Funeral and New Oleans is a Dying Whore among others. Over the under is another new chapter. Phil in particular is giving his voice more free reign and I like what I hear. There's depth there, particularly on Beneath the Tides and the killer closer. Of course, you also get the guitars, and boy do you get them. From the first second they are everywhere, weaving mountains of sound, and the playing is soulful and scorching at the same time. Down have emerged as the most interesting and productive of Phil's 'side projects'. I feel they are ready to conquer the world with over the under. He can finally emerge from the considerable shadow cast by Pantera and enter a new phase of his amazingly productive career./

There are so many other better writers out there who never get published.I'm not one of them, so this is not bitterness.
B0009FU0ZQ|5.0|Tom Selleck may very well have found his new niche since becoming famous for playing Magnum on Magnum P.I.  It's rare that a television actor fits so easily into two roles in their career, but Tom Selleck is perfect as Chief Jesse Stone in the adaptation of Robert B. Parker's novel, \\"Stone Cold.\\"<br /><br />I've been a fan of Parker's novels for a long time which also include his more famous character, Spenser.  However, in many ways I found myself liking Jesse Stone even more.  I think I like him more because he's fallible.  While Stone is very smart, he's got personal problems that people can relate to.<br /><br />This film brings a beautiful sense of style to it.  The small seaside town of Paradise is exactly how I envisioned it to be when I read the novels.  It's a place where everyone knows everyone, and I've always had a soft spot for the New England coast anyway.<br /><br />Jesse Stone is the chief of a police force of four people.  He's a lonely man who finds more pleasure in a bottle of booze than in those people around him.  After losing his job and wife in Los Angeles, he moves to this small town in an attempt to start something over...or, is it an attempt to get away from his previous life?  One can argue both ways.<br /><br />Jesse quickly finds himself in the middle of two cases.  The first involves tracking down a serial killer(s).  The second involves helping a young 16-year-old girl who was gang-raped by some boys at the local high school.  The film balances both storylines wonderfully and makes the viewer keenly interested in both.<br /><br />The dialogue in the film is as sharp as the dialogue of the novels.  Parker is one of the best writers of dialogue, and it translates beautifully here in the film with quick, witty answers and lines being exchanged, especially by Stone.  Selleck taps perfectly into the character.  While Jesse is a somber character, Selleck is careful to make sure that the audience sees the light wittiness of the character as well.  It's a tougher balance to achieve as an actor than most people realize.<br /><br />The supporting cast of characters rounds things out nicely as each becomes a believeable person that we come to care about, especially that of Alexis Dziena who plays the rape victim.<br /><br />The film is simple which is why it works so well.  There isn't a lot of violence.  Instead it is both character and plot driven, and the film excels at both.<br /><br />Quite simply, this is one of the best made-for-TV films made that I've seen in a long time.  I've already seen some of the others, and they are just as good as this one.<br /><br />Whether you're a fan of the novels or not, you will find yourself enjoying cracking cases with Jesse Stone as well as the immense satisfaction of having such a seasoned actor as Tom Selleck portraying him.achieve as an actor than most people realize.

B000VLOKQI|5.0|When I was fifteen in 1965 I heard a record called My Generation on our \\"pirate\\"radio station Veronica ( a ship on the North Sea ).  I can remember that I got goose flesh immediately.  I bought the album as soon as it came on the Dutch market.  And I am glad that I stiil have it ( in mono ).  This record changed my life as well as my musical life.  And even now I got goose flesh by looking at the dvd The story of the Who.  It did not disappear.  I think it is incredible that this band and its music stayed in my mind and life for that long.  I therefore thank the members of the Who for the amazing journey and the story.

B00104W8T6|4.0|The soundtrack to the quirky indie flick that is being hailed as the best movie of the year, \\"Juno,\\" is an eclectic compilation of subtle complexity and rambunctious lyricism.     \\"Juno\\" is a 2007 comedy-drama directed by Jason Reitman and stars Ellen Page as Juno, the witty high-schooler who finds herself nine weeks pregnant by track star and friend Paulie Bleeker, played by Michael Cera. \\"Juno\\" features a character that is confronted with the difficult task of balancing life as a pregnant woman and as a 16-year-old girl.     Not since \\"Garden State\\" has a movie featured music that makes for the ideal indie/alternative playlist.     \\"Juno\\" features the odd yet captivating music of Kimya Dawson, whose band The Moldy Peaches also appears on the soundtrack.     Dawson's combination of words and themes may leave you scratching your head in wonder, but her music ultimately captures the essence of Juno's character-sarcastic, wordy and all over-the-place-in-a-good way.     \\"Juno\\" includes Sonic Youth's play on The Carpenter's \\"Superstar,\\" a dreamy kaleidoscope of sounds, and Cat Power's beautiful, breathy rendition of The Honeydrippers' \\"Sea of Love.\\"    The Moldy Peaches' \\"Anyone Else But You\\" is the theme song to the movie. The soundtrack includes Cera and Page's movie-cut version, complete with the sound of the track team's footsteps at the close of the movie.    \\"I kiss you on the brain in the shadow of a train/I kiss you all starry eyed, my body's swinging from side to side/I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else/But you.\\"    The soundtrack is the perfect companion to the film's charming original screenplay as it flows flawlessly, each song fitting perfectly into the movie's artistic play on life.

B000NDIAWY|5.0|If a work of art could speak, it would sound like Brandi Carlile's \\"The Story.\\"    Pristine songwriting paired with a powerful voice makes \\"The Story\\" a distinct album.    Carlile signed with Columbia Records in 2004 and has since climbed her way to the Billboard Hot 100. She spent two weeks recording \\"The Story\\" with GRAMMY award-winning producer T-Bone Burnett at his Los Angeles home. Twin brothers Tim Hanseroth, on guitar, and Phil Hanseroth, on bass, helped co-produce Carlile's first self-titled album, which was released in July 2005. Cellist Josh Neumann joined the band one month later.    Carlile's sound is one of deep-rooted Americana and folk, with tracks showcasing her aching, straight-from-the-pit-of-her-stomach vocals. Her propensity for storytelling is evident throughout her second CD, released in April, beginning with \\"Late Morning Lullaby\\":    \\"The first sign of morning is gray and alarming/It's so disappointing the day has come so soon/While the rest of the world greets the day and feels new/I will push it away just like I always do/ I will be/Dreaming, Dreaming, Dreaming/Your real world away.\\"    \\"The Story\\" has a poetic quality, leaving room for interpretation in songs such as \\"Cannonball\\":    \\"Someone told me a lie/Someone looked me in the eye/And said time will ease your pain/But behold, when you fall/It's that same old cannonball/Coming back for your heart again.\\"    In \\"Turpentine\\" lyrics such as \\"I started losing sleep and gaining weight/and wishing I was 10 again/So I could be your friend again,\\"convey heartbreak and confusion, the kind that comes with living.    Carlile's sound may be somber and sleepy, but a few listens of this record prove that Carlile is no Debbie Downer.     Getting lost in the album's meticulousness is easy. Fortunately however, you won't want to be found.

B0014Z4OQG|4.0|The basic &#34;plot&#34; of CLOVERFIELD is this. A group of twenty-something hip New Yorkers are having a going away party for one of their friends, Rob (Michael Stahl-David) who has received a big promotion at the company he works for and is moving to Japan. The party is going along relatively smoothly until Rob has a brief confrontation with his ex-girlfriend. Shortly after there is a massive explosion and the power goes out. No one knows what is happening and the party moves outside. The frivolity comes to an end when there's another explosion and the head of the Statue of Liberty falls from the sky and careens down the street. Mass hysteria ensues and chaos runs rampant. The core group of friends and a couple of tagalongs attempt to evacuate the city with thousands of other people until the bridge they are crossing is attacked by a giant creature that is just barely glimpsed on screen. The remaining friends want to evacuate, but Rob refuses to leave the city until he can make sure his ex-girlfriend has left her apartment. What follows is a quick and jerky romp through the tunnel system of the city, being chased by fleshing-eating miniature monsters, getting caught in the crossfire between the military and the monster, and just trying to stay alive. The tape being used to cover the event is interlaced with a few scenes here and there of Rob and his girlfriend from just weeks before when they were still a very happy couple.<br /><br />CLOVERFIELD has been described as a cross between a Godzilla movie and THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT. Though that description isn't completely accurate, it does give a decent assessment of what the movie is like. The monster is never really seen until the end of the movie, but it does a huge amount of damage. The film is extremely shaky and when I first saw the movie several people were overheard complaining about the headache they had. Despite this, I really enjoyed the movie. It was something different and somewhat original and it makes me want to see more. It would be great if the studio did a follow up of the picture or published a book or something explaining where the monster came from and telling the story in a more linear, narrative fashion than the personal-point of view that CLOVERFIELD is. Most people either enjoy the movie or find it a complete waste of time; there are very few people who fall in the middle. If you don't mind shaky camera footage and are looking for a different kind of movie that tells an old-story, but from a newer perspective, give CLOVERFIELD a try. Also, in all honesty the DVD is probably the best way to watch the movie. Not only does it include the film, it's loaded with extras.me want to see more.

0316666343|2.0|Corny and effusively sentimental, with a too-tidy ending that brings justice to all. I didn't connect to any of the characters because they were all entirely unreal in a stereotyped way, much like a 1950's sitcom. The one positive is that I felt compelled to finish it.

I would not advise people like me to get too into this book. Maybe start with a Motley Fool book or Peter Lynch.    I really really enjoy the footnotes by Jason, and also the commentary in between chapters, it speaks in a much more reader friendly tone.    Obviously this is \\"The Book on Investing\\" so maybe I'll re-read it later in hopes of getting more out of it.
B000V8I2QU|1.0|So far as I know, I've only heard one song from this album.  Is that enough to do a review of the album?  I think so.  The song is \\"Girls in Their Summer Clothes,\\" and I've only heard it recently because the music video gets played *constantly* at the gym I recently started attending.  I heard the song several times and hated it right away, but at first I had no idea it was Springsteen.  It doesn't sound at all like him.  It sounds like Green Day or maybe Coldplay trying to be as sappy as they can to make the biggest possible score in the pop market.    Even worse is the video.  (That was how I found out this was a Springsteen song.)  Good God.  Is this really Bruce Springsteen?  I already knew that too often, pharmaceutical commercials look like music videos, and music videos look like pharmaceutical commercials, but this video seems to be the textbook case.  You can't possibly get any more emasculated.  \\"Do you suffer from feminine itch?\\" the screen seems to ask.  \\"Try Magicil.  Ask your doctor for details!\\"    Is this really the guy who did \\"Darkness on the Edge of Town\\" and \\"Nebraska\\"?  Is he reduced to doing macho poses with an acoustic guitar on a hilltop while a camera circles around him?  Intercut with pretentious images of \\"girls\\" of all ages staring serenely and majestically into the camera?  Did he not make enough money from this previously multi-platinum albums that he has to resort to lite FM musical stylings?    This song is so bad, so syrupy, so dull, so tedious, so awful that I wouldn't listen to the rest of the album if it were given to me.    Maybe Bruce can go on tour with Celine Dion.  As for me, I wear earplugs at the gym.

B000OHZL44|5.0|Malkovic?    If you don't mind the exceedingly creepy idea of your wife leaving you for another woman whilst occupying the body of a man (John Malkovic to be precise) then this movie is for you.    It's completely absurd, abstract and entertaining, if only for the fact that you will see Cameron Diaz at her absolute worst in terms of image (although quality acting).    Certainly a very entertaining way to spend a couple of hours!    The HD-DVD version isn't the best or worst transfer out there, it just is what it is, so if you like the movie, go and buy.

B000UJ48V8|5.0|By now, you probably already know how good a movie Full Metal Jacket is.  If we have to explain the origins of Lee Ermy or go into detail about how great a war movie this is... well... just buy it and see for yourself.    In terms of this medium, HD-DVD is an excellent way to enjoy this movie.  The visual quality is average. I'm attributing that to the age of the source film, but the HD-DVD comes out excessively grainy and not as sharp as more modern titles. It's still a head above regular DVD.. but not much.  In terms of audio, that's where this really stands out.  TrueHD 5.1 is the feature and you will never have heard Kubrick's war masterpiece as clearly as this. Even the original cinema wouldn't have given you this much ear delight.  Special features? who cares... I buy a movie for the movie, and rarely do i ever sit around for 4 hours later watching rubbish they tack on to make the back of the box look better.    Overall; Not exactly a HD-DVD demo, but great soundtrack and better visual quality than DVD make this the best way to experience FMJ.

B000GBFQT8|4.0|First book printed, second book chronologically.     I began re-reading the Narnia series after coming across a beautiful boxed set of all seven novels.  Mainly this was out of nostalgia, as these were favourites when I was young, and I was interested to see how they held up as adults.  I found them all to be written very clearly with provocative descriptive prose, and narrative that often draws the reader immediately into the story.     This is, of course, the most recognisable title of the series as well as being the first written/published.  Most readers will pick up the book hoping for a written account of the events in the recent film, or perhaps the BBC drama series if your memory goes back that far!  For the most part the events are the same, although elements are extracted and expanded upon in the films making the novel a little pale in comparison.     It is not however lacking in terms of character or charm, and is an alluring tale that sucks the reader in instantly despite the intrusion of the narrator at times.  The protagonists, places and events are described straight-forwardly with insightful touches that enhances the specific element that brings the scenes to life.  Even as a \\"grown up\\" who was only mildly interested in the story to begin with, I found the story absorbing and even inspirational.     8.5/10

B000VJAICK|5.0|This is a review of the quality of the HD DVD, not the movie.  I am very fond of the movie, I watch it about every two years or so.    I had heard that the Tremors HD DVD wasn't very good quality and was not really worth buying if you already had the standard version DVD.  This is a personal opinion of course, but I thought that the Hi-def quality for this movie was outstanding.  I had been told that the EE (edge enhancement - to help sharpen the HD picture) was so heavy that it made the movie almost unwatchable.  While I did notice a little EE, especially in some of the outdoor, day shots, I still thought that the picture was a nice improvement over the standard version.  I highly recommend it.

B000RJO57I|4.0|This was a very interesting movie. A coworker recommended this movie to me and I was not disappointed. It has Drama, Intrigue, and Comedy all rolled into one.

B000059LGC|4.0|Wow! What better backdrop for a story than the pyramids and ancient ruins of Egypt.  Set mainly along the Nile, I sometimes found the story second to the scenery! Not that the story didn't fully engage - it did! The varied characters in Death on the Nile, are quite a bunch - there is an element of humor underneath all the intrigue. We know someone is going to get it as the movie unwinds, but who? and by whom? Many seem to have their reasons...     I loved the first half of this movie.  It starts off with the craziest scenario.  Niece wants fiance to get a managerial position at her very rich auntie's estate.  She asks auntie and auntie says, well, let's meet him.  Did I mention that besides being filthy rich, auntie is also quite young and attractive?  When auntie meets fiance, sparks suddenly fly and then -    Cut to Egypt.  Suddenly riding horses amongst the pyramids - rich auntie, and niece's fiance - they're married!  And trailing around in their dust is the poor niece, bent on making a nuissance of herself during the honeymoon that should have been hers!  There's a certain humour.  And the scenery of the Nile, the ancient ruins, the Sphynx - it's stunning, and yet very much a part of the story.    For the second half of the movie though, I started to find myself less engaged.  It became more of what I think of when I think of a cliche mystery.  Less shots of Egypt.  Less humorous situations.  More tedious regurgitation of the murder as the Ustinov tries to solve the case.      The second half I give 3 stars as a noticeable lull seems to set in with the latter part of the cruise.  It becomes more \\"in the head\\", and I wasn't terribly convinced when the murder was finally solved.  A bit far-fetched..  While I don't mind far-fetched if it entertains simultaneously, I was becoming less and less entertained as the movie wound it's way toward the conclusion.  Not terrible.  Just not what the first half of the movie was - gorgeous, clever, witty and interesting.  One reason for this may have been that for the second half of the movie less attention is paid to the myriad of interesting characters interacting with each other, and all things focus on Ustinov, who's rather stuffy and dry most of the time, although he's not awful.  Just not as interesting as other characters which get more attention in the better half of this movie - the first.  Fortunately, the story ends on a powerful note.      This movie is worth seeing.  There are some jaw-droppingly beautiful scenes, which, at the same time, tie in so perfectly with the story.  The tying together of such a dramatic backdrop (Egypt) with the riviting story this begins as, and the satisfactory final scenes, make this movie more than well-worth seeing.

B000KKPN5C|5.0|For a small portable flash that can overcome the 'wide angle shadows' that the built-in flash can't. I'm taking it with me traveling, and leaving the SB800 home.      The bounce works great in the horizontal position, but not in the vertical.  That's the only small con.
B0016BP0PW|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies.  It is set to Beatles music and it is great for all ages of adults.
B00006LLOB|5.0|One of my first exposures to the world of Chicago-style blues, after a steady dirt of country-style Delta blues, was the Rolling Stones' version of the Willie Dixon classic Little Red Rooster back in the early 1960's. I thought that was a song to beat all songs and it had nothing to do its allegorical nature, you know, about sex. What, moreover, capped it for me the fact that it was originally banned in Boston- from the radio airwaves of the times. Naturally that made this teenager want to hear it even more.     All this is by way of saying-yes; the Stones did a great version of that song but if you really want it heard then you must go to the master- Howlin' Wolf. That big gravelly voiced man who, in pictures that I have seen, seems to be inhaling the microphone lets it all hang out as he struts his stuff on that number. In Do the Do, Little Red Rooster, Killing Floor and on and on the Wolf sweats, bleeds, sucks up the whiskey, has another one for good measure and gets down on his knees, sometimes literally, to belt out the blues.      In this two-disc set of Howlin' Wolf classics some of those Stones did exactly what I mentioned above-went to the source. Listen in to the dialogue when the Wolf tells these trained musicians how to do the do here on Little Red Rooster. And they are all ears. That says it all. Moreover, the musical excitement builds as song after song gets you in a true blue mood. This is all about sex, about whiskey, about hardworking weeks to get to fun-loving Saturday nights. Yes, the hour of the Wolf is just before the dawn. Get this masterwork. You will not regret it.
B000FA57N0|5.0|The show Firefly was really good.  After one season they cancelled the show; the movie although good really doesn't answer all the questions we have.  If Firefly were allowed to continue it would of had more viewers and ratings probably would've gone up.  However, the movie especially in HD is really clear, great sound, and great special effects.  Anyone would be happy with this on HD-DVD.
B000002MG1|5.0|Very few albums are completely beautiful from beginning to end.  This is one of those rare gems...
B000002P72|5.0|B.B. King-Live At The Regal *****<br /><br />Recorded live at the Regal in Chicago in 1964 this went on to become what is now widely considered the all time greatest live blues album. This is rightly deserved as this is in fact the greatest live blues album of all time.<br /><br />King's single note guitar lines are crisp as ever, and his vocals are beyond comparison. Aside from being obviously his best live recording, Live At The Regal is the best recording of King period. This is with out a doubt the best version of 'Sweet Little Angel' ever released. The essential version is more correct. 'Every Day I Have The Blues' and 'Its My Own Fault' are among some of the most inspired performances ever caught on tape. The albums closer 'Help The Poor' is just gut-wrenching. Pure bliss!<br /><br />This performance is pure electric. With every passing listen to Live At The Regal I still get chills all down my spine, and if you ask me that is the mark of a fantastic album after all these years and listens.
006097625X|4.0|good stuff, though i felt 'making comics' was better all around. easier read, and more pertinent information... though this is a nice companion book.
B00005ASHM|3.0|The Beach Boys-Pet Sounds ***<br /><br />Honestly I don't get it. I have tried time and time again to give The Beach Boys a chance and I just don't get it. I know it is good time music and summer fun but for the most part I really just think they are overrated and I feel the same way about Pet Sounds. I totally understand that it was a landmark album and changed the way music was recorded and the way it could sound, but other then the production I don't get it. Yes it inspired Srg. Pepper by the Beatles but so what, so did Freak Out! by Frank Zappa and The Mothers Of Invention and that doesn't get half the acclaim this does.<br /><br />I think 'God Only Knows' is a great song....lyrically that is. Music wise I do feel the band could have done better. The melody is smooth as ice though. 'Wouldn't It Be Nice' is hands down one of the greatest pop songs of all time, no debate, I would even fight someone who dare says a bad thing about that tune. I must say though that 'Sloop John B' could have been better. The title track is really awful to my ears. 'Here Today' was misguided. 'Caroline No' may be the best song on the album and it rarely is spoke about.<br /><br />Now I know everyone is gonna vote not helpful on my review just because they disagree with me I wish you would be open minded about where I am coming from though like I have tried to be time and time again with The Beach Boys before you click no. I am just saying that this is not an album for everyone there for I don't understand the claim that it is one of the ten greatest albums of all time. Maybe someone could leave me a comment explaining it to me because I am not saying this is a bad album because its not, but it isn't amazing either.
B000U618C8|3.0|I bought this CD after having heard some of the mp3s on MySpace, those songs  are his best songs, and really, there was no need to buy his CD after all.
B000LZ52XY|5.0|David Bowie-Station To Station *****<br /><br />When David Bowie released Station To Station he was deliberately trying to change the way rock music was played. Once he was done with his (in my opinion, horrible Young American faze) he started to go for more of a Roxy Music sound as opposed to soul and glam rock, which had really been his main stay over his previous albums. With some exception of course.<br /><br />This was recorded in California in what you could call a cocaine blizzard, as Bowie was so out of his mind on coke that he nearly pushed everyone in his life away and apparantley turned into a real jerk. During the opening lines of the albums title track, 'Station To Station' Bowie refers to himself as the *Thin White Duke* the nick-name and character he would adopt for the next several albums, including his Berlin Trilogy. The albums hit single 'TVC15' can best be described as New Orleans jazz meets George Clinton of P-Funk in a bar. One of his all time best songs. 'Golden Years' is what James Brown would have done if he ever went into space.<br /><br />Station To Station musically is the very best album that David Bowie ever released. Lyrically it is close as well. As a whole it is not Bowie<br />s all time best album but it is damn close. Station To Station is a must have in all music collections, simply because it would find a niche in every collection no matter what the style.
0452289963|1.0|Instead of returning this book to Amazon, or sharing it with someone else who might glean \\"something\\" from it, I chose to throw the book away. I can't even remember when I did such a thing before.  It's not out of anger or frustration, but a genuine concern regarding the philosphy of this man.  As a (striving to be) Christian each and every, I can't in all good conscience support such writings that make reference to Christ as if he is just \\"one of the boys\\" or equal, or less than Buddha, etc. Please know, fellow readers, the decision to throw this book out was not lightly made.

B0013ISU0A|1.0|R.E.M. has been my favorite band for years and years, so I automatically plopped down the cash for this \\"deluxe\\" version of their newest CD.  As the other reviewers have stated, that was a very dumb move!  I love the the CD, but this sad excuse for a mini-movie just irks me.  I agree that the director was more interested in being high concept or \\"artistic\\" than in making something even remotely watchable.  It's so dark that you can barely see anything, not that there's much worthwhile on the screen anyway!  In addition, I have to say something about the political content of the film.  Look, I've always known that the members of R.E.M. were far more to the left politically than  I could ever be, but I was still a fan because I'm listening to their music, not their views.  But to hear Peter Buck say on this DVD that he's ashamed to be an American just aggravates me.  I spent 20 years serving my country so that some rich rock star can complain about the country that put money in his pocket and is one of the few places in the world where he can voice his opinion?  I don't mind if he complains about things he disagrees with, but I'm so sick of people bad-mouthing this great country that we're so fortunate to live in!
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Quite simply, the best.  A work so perfect, its a \\"must see\\" and \\"must own\\".  I would call this \\"required\\" for all people with a TV, but especially if you have a nice widescreen HD set/system.  Trust all the 5 star reviews you see on this and give this a watch. This will take you some time to get through, but for hours upon hours you will have the most pleasureful viewing experience you can imagine. Every moment I sit with my family and watch this, my jaw is on the floor. I watch this in Blu-Ray on a 47 inch Toshiba HD Regza with Yamaha powered surround sound (5.1).     Words hardly assist in describing this, just do yourself a favor and devote some time to it, you will be taken to places you cant possibly imagine, all on our own Planet. God is revealed in His wonderful glory through this work. Enjoy!
0385495323|5.0|For a book on cryptology from a historical perspective it's really hard to believe it would be as entertaining as Singh makes it. Using his skill as an author he weaves history, technology, and methods of encryption together to explain topics that normally would leave many of us in the blind.<br /><br />The most interesting thing about the whole book is that as you begin to read up on forms of encryption and decryption you begin to absorb yourself into the whole culture. One chapter describes the Beale Ciphers, a set of ciphers that gained popularity especially in the early 1900s and still are significant today linking to a fabulous treasure and yet still remaining unbroken. I remember spending the day after reading up on it thinking of ways I'd try to break the cipher. Not many books fill your mind with such rich images and excitement as this book seems to.<br /><br />Generally, the book is wonderful and has enough to keep you hooked until the very end despite its historical nature.

0812932293|5.0|This book chronicles the life of Richard Branson from his starting years to the early 2000s. It goes into intimate details such as his early dealings to his current endeavors. Richard is never shy to explain anything including his mistakes regarding women (and cheating) to his usage of drugs during a business meeting costing him heavily by closing clients.<br /><br />This book is perhaps the most fun of any auto-biography I've ever read. Richard goes into such great detail that you're left laughing through most of the story, hoping for the next piece of his life to be as exciting as the events that had already passed.<br /><br />That said, Richard is a very lucky man and I'd assume he's the only person that could pull off being a leader like he describes himself in his book. He is perhaps one of my favorite people in the world and definitely a hero to someone interested in business leadership but his style of leadership would lead most people into bankruptcy. He tends to jump head first into business dealings, doesn't always know much about the businesses he's entering, and he continually breaks every rule in branding ever created. Had it been any other man in his shoes likely Virgin never would have survived.<br /><br />He's definitely an interesting person, however, and his leadership style does work for him so obviously he knows the secret of getting it to work. And he's also the sort of guy that really has integrity in a time when the business environment and leadership lacks that. Even if I don't think his leadership style is the most solid I would definitely deal with a man of his character if I had the opportunity.<br /><br />You will enjoy reading this book, I promise you.

0792844890|4.0|A complete satire on the space movie genre is the best way to describe this movie. From the downright stupid to the completely goofy humor this movie is indescribably funny, if you enjoy that sort of humor.<br /><br />This isn't the sort of movie I tend to watch with friends on a weeknight, however, when bored. Why? Because it takes a certain mindset to really enjoy this sort of comedy. Some of the humor is overdone completely (the opening scene was funny but just way too long).<br /><br />The movie's literal interpretation of everything is also hilarious. I won't spoil any of the jokes here, because most are situational and are related to the interpretation of what's said but you'll quickly understand what I mean if you watch this.<br /><br />The only downside I see, as a lover of this comedy, in watching this movie is that there is one period of time in the movie where things drag on for a little while. The story is decent enough for the nature of the film though and picks up just as quickly as it slows down as it progresses. It's nothing amazing story wise but when you watch a satire it's less of a concern, I think.<br /><br />In short, it's a good movie with some minor flaws. If you love goofy humor you'll likely like this film as well.

076790592X|4.0|I think this book is perfect for anyone who has lost the life of someone dear to them or is in the process of losing someone. As you read the story you degenerate alongside Morrie, an older gentlemen who is dying of a disease which is slowly depriving him of everything in his life he enjoys. But as the story progresses and you learn more of Morrie you begin to understand that despite this he finds a way to move on with his life and still enjoy what little he has left.<br /><br />It's somewhat strange that in our culture where we are so driven by materialistic means and the lives of a pseudo class of celebrities that something as wonderful as this book can come into play and shake us back to our core selves. You won't walk away from this book happy, it's not a book like that. But you will definitely feel glad you read the book.<br /><br />The only downside to the book is, while this probably doesn't sound politically correct, I felt like the author's motivations for seeing Morrie seemed more so for the sake of getting a story out of him than for seeming him for the purposes of just visiting an old friend. Perhaps this was the author's intent, however, because he makes it clear that from the start he didn't visit or even remember Morrie very much and you get the feeling that as it progresses perhaps some of this selfish desire to fulfill a story is replaced with genuine caring but it still left me unnerved.<br /><br />Regardless of the intent of the author, the book is a wonderful gem that is definitely worth reading. I highly suggest you put aside a Sunday, sit down, and read this.

B00005JMFQ|5.0|One thing is clear about Love Actually, either you'll completely be blown away by it or you'll hate it.<br /><br />Personally I am of the former camp in regards to this movie. The characters have complex interactions and despite the seemingly unjoined stories you find bridges that connect characters left and right which unwind as the story develops.<br /><br />The movie also brings together many stories with both sad and happy endings depicting all the aspects of relationships which can be encountered.<br /><br />Not to mention the movie is hilarious. Hugh Grant's character is amazingly fun to watch and the character called Collin is insanely funny.<br /><br />All in all, I could go on for awhile about this film but I'll leave my comments at this. I could watch this film twice in the same week without losing interest in it. I can't say that about many other films.
1591396190|5.0|I remember being blown away by the articles in HBR that this book was based on. The strategy canvas is a fantastic tool - very simple, very visual and very powerful, so too is their \\"eliminate-reduce-raise-create\\" grid.     The book doesn't add much of substance to the articles - but the stories are useful illustrations and it is easy to read - also it's easier to keep the book on your shelf than tatty old photo-copies of an article.     Another INSEAD professor has now taken this work further, in my opinion. [[ASIN:0132363429 The Momentum Effect: How to Ignite Exceptional Growth]] (which has been endorsed by Kim and Marborgne) calls creating this sort of uncontested market space \\"origination strategy\\" - ie originating new and different value for customers. The two make perfect partners. Both are excellent books.
0393317552|4.0|Ever wonder how the Europeans managed to conquor the Americas, and not the other way around?  Well, if you're unfortunate enough to have that much time on your hands, there's now a book tailor-made for you!  Jared Diamond details how some civilizations have come to conquor others, and not vice versa.  Obviously, they do this by utilizing guns, germs, and steel (gee, wonder where he gets the title from?)...but the underlying question, of course, is HOW certain societies got those advances, and how others did not?<br /><br />I'm not a professional historian, biologist, anthropologist, or what-have-you, so I can't state boldly that Diamond's evidence holds up.  But his argument does have a certain logic about it.  Not saying there aren't other factors that he should consider (environment can't be the only reason people do what they do), but he does present a convincing argument, at least to this layman (and the fact that we're still reading this book 10 years later suggests professionals have found it food for thought as well).<br /><br />A note to casual readers, as many of you probably are.  There are sections of this book that become a bit monotonous; the three chapters detailing the rise of food production in various world societies is a bit mind-numbing (blame our violence-soaked media), and there's a lot of information that gets tossed around here without thorough explanation.  Never fear, though--this book is well-worth the read, and is largely entertaining.  Diamond's prose would make for a good textbook (there are questions in the back accompanying this volume; not sure what class you could read this in, but I would reccommend it for anyone interesting in trying it); he places a bit too much emphasis upon New Guinea (where he has performed years of field research), but we can't blame him for writing about what he loves, can we?  \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\" is an interesting, thought-provoking book about the rise and fall of society throughout the ages.  Highly reccommended for anyone with even a passing interest on the subject.nyone with even a passing interest on the subject.
0765348276|4.0|'Old Man's War' is John Scalzi story of a man who undergoes a tremendous change. On Scalzi's Earth, space travel is controlled and limited to a select group of people. If you are from a poor culture, those people a selected as colonists. The human race is caught up in a 'race' to take habital planets in the universe. As the human expand into the universe, an army is required to protect established colonies and to fight for control of other planets.    The second group of people allowed to travel in space are the volunteers for the Colonial Defense Forces (CDF). These are people who are 75 years old. These people are trained and transformed into a new engineered body. This new body grants the person renewed youth, strength, and an inboard computer system.    The story is centered on John Perry, a 75 year old widower. It is very interesting as we follow John through the process of entering this new army. The book spends a majority of the book setting the stage for the transfer into Johns new body. While this is being set up, John bonds with a group of new recruits. It is unfortunate that this bond wasn't further developed. Some of the chracters are a little flat and under developed.    Once John is assigned and survived a number of battles, we see that he is not just your standard grunt, but has very good leadership skills. That being said, the end of the book has John re-assigned to the elite 'Ghost Brigade' (GB). This part of the story was a little hard to belive based on what we have been told about the CDF and the GB.    The story is still very entertaining and well worth the effort. I am not planning to read the next book in Scalzi's series about this universe. Enjoy!

B000001FA4|4.0|This CD broke right about the time that I was finishing high school and heading off to college and U2 was bridging the gap between being a college radio Irish band and musical supergroup.  \\"The Joshua Tree\\" and other later discs will be lauded by most as the bands best...bit this one is my favorite.    It is a monumental jump in craft and production from the anger fueled \\"War\\".  Songs like \\"Promenade\\" \\"A Sort of Homecoming\\" and the \\"Unforgettable Fire\\" provide the sonic foundation for songs like \\"Pride\\" and \\"Bad\\" (Which ranks up there with \\"Rosalita\\" as the best songs that I have ever seen performed live.)    There are a few uneven moments, but even with that being said...I would not call any of them mistakes.  Almost 25 years after release I still pull this CD up and listen to it from start to finish.

B00003CXAA|5.0|I bought this dvd set for a friend and he absolutely loves it.  He's a film major and he said all the bonus material on the dvds are great extras he's never seen before.  What he doesn't know is that this set can be purchased for an amazingly low price online to which I myself give a big thumbs up. The only complaint that most reviewers have is that the quality of the picture seems to be a bit low considering the new technology available for digital re-mastering.  The film itself is relatively old and I myself thought the picture quality was good as it did not bother my friend nor me at all.  At the moment I believe this is the only comprehensive dvd set available anyway, and at such a low price you'd be crazy not to buy it.
B000000WFU|5.0|When I first heard Adiemus, I was very enchanted and somehow all my thoughts just went away, making me feel very relaxed. I believe that Karl Jenkins and Miriam Stockley did a great job with all their music. It's something that I can listen to while I do my homework.    I would also like to add that for those of you who feel that this has no music in it, maybe it's because you're interests in music lies in other styles other than Karl Jenkins'. The music isn't exactly \\"world music\\", but it's supposed to give that idea with some Celtic and European influences. Also, the words are all made up, so if you don't understand it, don't worry about it too much. The idea of using the human voice in these songs is to feel relaxed. And for those of you who claim that she is crying at an unbearable pitch, apparently you have not heard people that think they are sopranos when they're not. Stockley is a great singer . Her voice sounds amazing in all these songs. But if you still don't like it, fine, it's your opinion. After all, people's tastes in music differ person to person. I happen to enjoy new age music as well as classical, pop, some rock, and anything that I feel fits for lyrical or modern dances. And some people who like other music in this genre may not like what they hear on this album just because of our different tastes. So I do recommend listening to the samples first before you make your decision of buying this CD.

B000002KYR|5.0|Eliminator is one of my favourite albums. It works on several different levels, and it works well. On the surface it is a great collection of catchy pop songs. I can dance to them, hum them, play air guitar to them, shave to them, paint the ceiling to them etc. There isn't a boring song on the record, and the album isn't too long. It doesn't cost too much and the cover looks nice. I can hold it up in front of my face, and pretend that I am a car. Eliminator also works as a coherent whole. The music is uniform, but instead of being repetitive and dull, the album instead feels like an excellent half-hour composition divided into movements.    On another level, Eliminator is a thinky album. It's a writey album. I like to ponder it, it sets my mind in motion. Eliminator is a clever scientific musical experiment. It was a conscious attempt to change ZZ Top's style, to make the band more contemporary, and it was an enormous success, on both an artistic and a commercial level. I'm sure that old-time fans of the group might have been upset at the disco rhythms, but only the most uptight square could fail to be moved by \\"Gimme All Your Lovin'\\" or \\"Sharp Dressed Man\\". I imagine that kids in 1983 might have thought that ZZ Top was a brand-new band, a modern boogie group with a clever retro style, and videos with hot women in them. You know, like Robert Palmer. He made records in the 1970s, but when he did that video for \\"Addicted to Love\\" in 1985, an entire new generation assumed that he had just come from nowhere, with a bevy of hot women. Did I mention hot women? Robert Palmer had hot women, and ZZ Top also had hot women. I know this because I have just checked on the Youtube. ZZ Top's women are not as hot as Robert Palmer's women, although it has to be said that any woman would look hot when stood next to ZZ Top. Perhaps that was ZZ Top's way of attracting women. Robert Palmer, on the other hand, did not have to do anything special to attract women, in fact he had to shoo them away, they pestered him so much that he moved to Switzerland, and died young. But I digress.    With Eliminator, ZZ Top did something that Genesis and The Rolling Stones and Jefferson Airplane and The Who and Paul McCartney failed to do, they moved with the times without trashing their reputation. Of the band's contemporaries, I can only think of Yes having achieved the same feat, although that was done by essentially ditching all that was Yes about Yes except for the vocals.    So, as a musical experiment, Eliminator works brilliantly. I cannot think of another album that combines disco and guitar rock and synth-pop so well without sounding awful. It's a deceptively simple record as well. The drums are basically straightforward four-to-the-floor pulse beat, all the way throughout every song, a mixture of drum machine and real live human drummer. Ordinarily this unvarying drum style would be monotonous, and in a way it *is* monotonous, but it's monotonous in a good way, hypnotic rather than boring. The twin guitar lines are often very complex, but they are mixed so that they become a backdrop. The synths are generally tasteful, restricted to pulse-bass and a few swooshy pads. The vocals have a distant, unemotional quality that sounds cool rather than affected. The songs are classically structured rock tunes, none of them have a rapping bit.    On a further level, and perhaps this is unintentional, Eliminator has a timeless quality. It's a period piece, but it has dated well. There's nothing offensive about the overall sound. The music is classical. The dual-guitar playing is technically impressive and the guitar tone is still awesome, although subdued. The lyrics are generally dumb beyond parody, with sexual metaphors that would make Roy \\"Chubby\\" Brown feel uncomfortable, but that just adds to the charm. ZZ Top were real men, you see, from an era that did not value manly manliness. Nowadays they come across as endearingly retro and harmless. Eliminator has datedmuch, much better than \\"Afterburner\\", the band's next album, which came out in 1985. Afterburner really does sound like a mid-80s record, with fake drums and fake guitars that could have come out of an arcade machine. They're both cheesy records, in the sense that you couldn't take them to a posh dinner party without people laughing at you and mocking you and deriding your taste, but Eliminator is likeably cheesy whereas Afterburner is just an anonymous mid-80s synth rock record.    In its day, Eliminator was a big popular success, although the critics thought it was just another modern pop-rock record. Today it is grudgingly respected as a classic of the period, but I believe it deserves more. There are few albums that entertain me all the way through, that I can listen to in one sitting without being bored. Kraftwerk's \\"Computer World\\" is one. This is another. It's the musical equivalent of one of those films that you can just sit and watch; Raiders of the Lost Ark, or Where Eagles Dare etc. It's easy to overlook that kind of entertainment, but it's precious and rare and should be cherished. I would love it if Eliminator goes into the time capsule.
B0002I831S|5.0|You can't miss the first season of original Trek. While season 2 may represent a time when all the characters were \\"hitting their stride\\" so-to-speak, season one has quite a few episodes that represent the best of TV science fiction writing. City on the Edge of Forever, Balance of Terror, The Naked Time, absolutely excellent. The documentary about William Shatner's horse business - not so much. I'm a bit of a purist, as well; so while I appreciate the new versions with the updated special effects (they did a great job on them), I really want to see Star Trek the way I remember it. The budget struggles and antiquated effects technology are part of the history, and tell you something about television production of the 1960s. I love this DVD collection.
0307265730|5.0|Following the enormously successful 'The Interpreter of Maladies' and 'The Namesake', Ms. Lahiri weaves a beautiful set of stories in this evocative collection.  In her inimitable style, we view the world in the persona of the protagonists - taciturn, often Bengali. They do much of the \\"talking\\" sans dialogue, expressing their complex and deep emotions about the world around them. It is here that Ms.Lahiri's literary magic really becomes apparent. She paints broad brush strokes of time and emotion yet is remarkably descriptive of the smallest facets, taking us into the mind of her characters. In amazing detail, she outlines the smallest bits of scenery, without ever sounding verbose or dull. While one may not have ventured to all of her locales - Calcutta, Seattle or her favorite Ivy League settings in the northeast or an autumnal Italy, her vivid descriptions enable us to be right there. For the first half of the book, we are taken for 50-60 pages at a time into the lives of Ruma, a daughter who feels a strong sense of duty towards her widowed father who visits her and bonds with his grandson, all while concealing his secret love affair, to the \\"crush\\" of a married woman for another man as seen through the eyes of her daughter. The couple Megan and Amit who attend a weekend wedding with their own marriage having a crisis moment to Sudha grappling with her guilt at her brother's alcoholism to the story of Paul who harbors unreciprocated feelings for his housemate Sang and is drawn into her life in a manner he never anticipates. The second half of the book deals with the stories of Hema and Kaushik as their lives intersect as kids, the secret and kinship they share, Kaushik's life and a chance encounter decades later that leaves so much behind and yet doesn't.     One does not have to be Bengali or even Indian to appreciate the universal appeal of the human stories she deftly weaves - infidelity,  familial interactions with parents and siblings, love, loss and longing and of course her themes of straddling two cultures. It is true that she is not venturing into unexplored territory in this novel. She writes as before, of (Indian) immigrants who struggle to adjust and who build their own little bubbles. But the feelings are global as is Kaushik the photojournalist who thinks \\"he had so little to do with India.....and yet.....he was always regarded as an Indian first\\".   The subset of people who may have roots in both Calcutta and the US is probably limited. A few uniquely Bengali mentions - a grimy \\"flat\\" in Maniktala, chanachur (an Indian snack for \\"tea\\" time), Haldiram's (purveyor of the same) and words like dada and boudi (for elder brother and sister-in law often not used in a strict relational sense) merely ignite a sense of kinship with the author. Her richly textured writing make these literary easter eggs all the more savory while one knows that almost everyone is likely to find situations, feelings and characters that they can relate to.   Some of the stories do not really come to \\"fruition\\" in a conventional sense. The complexities of what may transpire next are left to our imaginations. The characters and their stories leave a sense of poignancy that lasts long after.
B00139W3NE|3.0|As a fan of Harry Potter and the Chronicles of Narnia I gave this movie a chance. I found I greatly enjoyed it. After having read the book (after I saw the movie) I must say, they did leave out the most important chapter, and even though it did not take away my initial enjoyment, it left me a bit disappointed and wanting. In a world of long movies, what was 30 more minutes to show us the ending we should have had. Overall I still like the movie and intend on buying it when it's released on DVD.
0321544080|5.0|Joe McNally is definately one of those people whose character comes out from the pages. This book provides plenty of insight into various techniques/approaches he used throughout his career as well as some great stories from this world renowned photographer.    I should state that this book isn't a book for someone who is wanting to learn about photography. It doesn't show you the bare basics kind of stuff, but is still a valuable edition to any photographer's bookcase.    Very enjoyable....
B000WS4QJG|5.0|It was my brother birthday and the one thing he wanted was Micheal Jackson... Thriller. I got it just in time.
B0010YSD7M|3.0|I was really excited to get this movie.  It was the ending to the Stargate SG1 story and wanted to see what the would do with it.  I think the movie was good but I was expecting a lot more.  The epic battles were epic to the point and tune of 30 seconds. I would say get this DVD if your a fan of SG1 and want to see how their story ends.  If you don't like the series then this movie isn't for you.
B0013FYTA8|5.0|I bought this CD because Chris Daughtry is featured on, \\"By the Way\\". Not only do I love that song, but I find myself liking all of the tracks. I would definitly recommend this CD.
067144901X|5.0|my daughter had a copy of this that she loved so much! It was read and loved until it fell apart. We got her a second copy for her second birthday, and it's still a hit. Great rhymes, great illustrations. a classic
1577314808|5.0|An amazing book! It took me a while to absorb the clever prose and succinct metaphor, but I believe the gist of Tolle's insight is this:    Sit on a bench for 2 years and have a nervous breakdown. Realize that if you write a book full of drivel and sell it to the masses, you'll be rich! That's his revelation. Get a billionaire talkshow hostess who posesses all the critical thinking of a kumquat to promote it to other idiots in the Bozone, and you're rich, and the moronization of society continues...  By the way, if you don't get this review or are angered by it, you just aren't evolved or enlightened enough yet. You heard me.
B00133KFGW|5.0|I bought this movie after reading great things about it and was a little confuse at the beginning but it all falls in to place as the movie moves along with a great soundtrack , so what can I say that hasn't already been said about this movie , Great & Recommended .
B0012IV3RS|3.0|A reputation can be a terrible thing. In the napalm-blast of     1980s' fear concerning movie violence, many worthless slices of     cinematic dross acquired undeserving kudos by virtue of the     'video-nasty' label, while several genuine works of art (A     Clockwork Orange, The Evil Dead) were dragged under the wheels of     the juggernaut of public paranoia.   Fulci's The New York Ripper is a film that deserves to be     extricated from the censor's dungeon and reappraised, not as a     shamelessly mistreated classic but as a video-era schlocker     that's tacky, tonally incompetent and, above all, completely     harmless. Fulci's silly slasher belongs to the subgenre of balls     'n' all gore films that can trace their lineage back to the     bloody, zero-value outpouring of Herschell Gordon Lewis. The plot     lurches unevenly from one torture-scene to the next, with a     near-comatose Jack Hedley as a nominal hero cop who sleepwalks     through the mire of cod-psychology and seedy sexuality that Fulci     favours in lieu of a decent script. Just as in hardcore porn,     plotting, characterisation, dialogue and direction are irrelevant     window-dressing to the money-shots of flesh-ripping on display.     There is a gleeful sadism evident in the scenes of     broken-bottle/vaginal interface, nipple-slicing and eye     bisection, but nothing that will faze fans of the Hostel or Saw     franchises. Indeed, there is an almost quaint, kitsch appeal to     the ropey latex mutilations, with Fulci's stark, almost careless     camerawork resolutely embracing the no-frills style of     exploitation cinema.This truly is the stuff that Eli Roth's     wet-dreams are made of.  Lit like a peepshow, and boasting just as much cheap titillation     with as little artistic merit, Fulci's Ripper is a camp curiosity     that offers some basic sustenance to gorehounds with an interest     in the history of the  genre. The absurdity of the 'duck-voiced     killer' conceit suggests that Fulci probably didn't take this     nonsense too seriously, an approach which every viewer should     wholeheartedly adopt. You may baulk in disgust at a few moments     of lingering body-horror; but mostly you'll just spend the 93     minutes' running time sniggering.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|This is a must have for all Stargate fans.  Great story...well done.  You've got to see it!
B0013D8LOU|5.0|I have just seen the Broadway Play, which is also available on DVD, Sweeney Todd - The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (Broadway 1982).    OMG Tim Burton's Movie is SO MUCH BETTER. Burton gets right to the core of the stoy. This is a DARK, VERY DARK story and Burton gets that across very well with the acting, music, and back drop.  Both Carter & Depp seem to put more passion in their characters.  I believe Depp did a much better job with his singing than Hearn did in the '82 Play.     Thank you Tim Burton for your Movie, keep of the good work.     Warning:    It is a very Dark Movie, But hey, it's a story of a serial Killer.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie as any true Stargate fan would. It gives closure to this popular series. There is so much more they could have done with this series but unfortunately the powers that be do not agree. I would have liked to see \\"Jack\\" in the movie but we will have to wait for the next Stargate movie which he is working on.  Definitely a must see!
0452289963|5.0|This book will change your life forever. When I finished reading it, I started reading it again!!! It is full of info that has forever changed me!!!
B0010YSD7M|4.0|Since we didnt get a 11th season to finish the Ori storyline at least we got a great movie with lots of special effects to wrap it up.  I liked how they ended it but I felt it was rushed through.  Still over all a great DVD.
B000WCBMA8|4.0|Una sola palabra: adictivo. Había planificado escribir la reseña de Magic, el nuevo disco de Bruce Sprigsteen. Estaba avanzando muy motivado por el tremendo trabajo que 'The Boss' viene realizando en el nuevo milenio, cuando cometí un error mortal: compré el recién salido The Black and White Album de The Hives. Ahora no puedo parar, lo escucho una y otra vez, en la combi, en el baño, bailo en mi cuarto, muevo la cabeza como un zombi en la chamba; he caído noqueado ante el nuevo puñetazo de estos suecos... y sigo, fiel al golpe.  Todavía aturdido puedo decir que el cuarto disco de estudio de The Hives en diez años es el mejor de su carrera. Howlin' Pelle Almqvist, el inquieto cantante de la banda (que en el escenario es una chillona combinación de Mick Jagger e Iggy Pop), esta vez muestra sus mejores registros vocales y va del grave al agudo con mayor naturalidad y solvencia que en grabaciones pasadas (It Won't Be Long y el final Bigger Hole To Fill son prueba de ello). El resto, el fantástico Chris Dangerous (batería), Dr. Matt Destruction (bajo) y los guitarristas Vigilante Carlstroem y Nicholaus Arson; componen una base musical potente y difícil de igualar en estos días.  Continúa el fascinante rock acelerado de riffs afilados que siempre caracterizó al grupo, sin embargo, lo más sorprendente y contagioso de The Black and White Album es su versatilidad rítmica y melódica, lo que no se pudo escuchar del todo en los discos anteriores. Salvo por un par de tracks, Veni Vidi Vicious (segundo larga duración de la banda, 2000) era un fogonazo continuo, mientras que con el excelente Tyrannosaurus Hives (2004) el grupo exploró nuevos sonidos pero sin arriesgarse del todo.   Ahora que cambiaron de traje (negro por blanco) los suecos se atreven a tocar funk en la altanera T.H.E.H.I.V.E.S. (que incluso es algo `disco', a lo Earth, Wind & Fire), algo de punk a lo Ramones (Return The Favour), una misteriosa cantata en piano (Puppet On A String, que bien podría formar parte del repertorio de Tom Waits), o inclusive una simple melodía instrumental con órgano y una caja de ritmos (la sorpresiva A Stroll Through Hive Manor Corridors). Ahora usan mucho más el sintetizador y el resultado mejora el timbre general de la banda, con holgura.   Claro que en el resultado tienen que ver, y mucho, los productores que han trabajado en The Black and White Album (La calidad del sonido también supera a los discos anteriores). Pharrell Williams, el famoso cantante de rap (N*E*R*D) y productor ganador del Grammy, trabajó en varias de las canciones del disco. Se puede apreciar su `mano' en la irresistiblemente bailable Well Allright! (Howlin' aúlla \\"Everyone's a loser in the modern world\\") y la mencionada T.H.E.H.I.V.E.S. Otro ganador de la academia de la música, Jacknife Lee (que hizo Vertigo de U2 y ahora produce del próximo disco de R.E.M.), es el responsable de Hey Little World. El resultado es de primera.  ¿Lo mejor del disco? El inicio. Si no te mueves con Tick Tick Boom (en mi opinión, candidata a canción del año), Try It Again y su coro femenino (que grita el pegajoso estribillo \\"Up from the floor on the count of ten, oh you get up, you get down and you try it again\\"), y You Got It All... Wrong, simplemente no tienes músculos en el cuerpo.  Que continúe el baile desenfrenado.
B0011KQSZ4|5.0|Wickedly funny with classic British dry humour. Wonderfully cast, brilliantly written and superbly performed you will enjoy this farcical comedy immensely.    From the under-appreciated son, to the scared witless future son-in-law every character makes you smile with their humanity and laugh out loud at their predicaments.    Very funny stuff!
0756404746|4.0|I had a really hard time rating this book...  I both thoroughly enjoyed it and had reservations about it at the same time.      It started off a bit differently than I thought it would, and at first, I didn't think I was going to enjoy it at all.  Kvothe (or Kote, or Reshi, depending on the perspective) wasn't a very interesting character at first.  The Name of the Wind starts in its present timeline with Kvothe as a bartender, running from his past and trying to make sure no one knows who he is.  He's a legend, for reasons mostly unknown, even at the end of this book.      The book starts with the small town in which Kvothe resides having an encounter with spider creatures that may actually be demons.  The locals discuss the portents of this and Kvothe tells them how to deal with it without telling how he is knowledgable of these things.  Soon Devan Lochees, or Chronicler (not The Chronicler, just Chronicler, oddly enoough) arrives, having wind of Kvothe residing there and deperately wanting to chronicle his story, as his name implies.      The dialogue between the locals and even between Kvothe and Chronicler was pretty typical and not very interesting and I was close to putting this book down.  However... as Kvothe actually begins his story the book becomes insantly addicting.  Somehow it seemed like a completely different book.  The dialogue had whit and was clever and even funny in parts.  His traveling theater troupe of a family and his first teacher Abenthy made interesting characters and Kvothe himself as a child did as well.  The magic system that is explained by his teacher is also clever and partially explained by science, so when it comes up later, it doesn't seem to be a Deus ex Machina.    The book moves from one setting to another, following Kvothe all the while as he lives through various events and tragedies.  Mostly tragedies.  He lives a pretty harsh life reminiscent of Fitz if you're familiar with Robin Hobb's work, though perhaps not QUITE as tragic.  He meets various friends and mentors, and enemies as well.  After theiving and hiding and trying to survive, he makes his way to the University to study the Arcane arts and the book finds its focal point.  I think this is where people are coming up with the Harry Potter comparisons, but other than the fact that he attends a school that teaches magic in some form, there's really not much else to compare to Rowling's series.      This may sound a little boring but it isn't.  Kvothe's life actually is very interesting and he develops to be a well thought out character, even if none of the secondary characters really do.  And there is an underlying plotline behind all this that I can't really go into for fear of ruining it, but it involves powerful beings that resemble demons, and may even be so.  That might sound familiar if you've read a bit of fantasy but it's handled well and provides a creepy underlying tone to the whole book.    One of my biggest issues with the book is that Kvothe seems too perfect, as if there's nothing he can't do.  Everything he tries to do, he excells at:  music, theiving, arcane arts, outdoor survivalism and various other random things.  He practically does everything in the story but have a child.  He still made some bad judgement calls and does a few stupid things, but this pales compared to his vast knowlege and the fact that he exceeds above average in every class he takes at the university.  He says he doesn't know anything about women, yet every woman he comes across seems to be infatuated with him.  But... as the story ended I realized that his borderline perfection might've been what Rothfuss was going for, after all, Kvothe is a legend.  If you tell a story about a fictional legendary character, I suppose it has to come out something like this.    Rothfuss' style is well read, though there are a few clumsy mistakes like repeating the same idea or the same phrase more than once in a paragraph.  This doesn't happen much but itseems like something an editor should have caught.    And of course there is the fact that this is only the first of a trilogy.  I ususally don't mind this, but Kvothe's story doesn't really come to any kind of head or give a satisfying conclusion.  The present day portion gives a bit of a surprise and revalation, but his past chronicle is basically just put on pause and really leaves one wanting more.  I suppose I can't complain much about this part, as orignally the author was just going to write one book, rather than three.    Still, this is a good read, despite my complaints.  I have to admit after reading both of Scott Lynch's Gentleman Bastard books, my fantasy reading nose was held a bit high along with my expectations, but I can't compare The Name of the Wind with fantasy along those lines.  There really isn't a whole lot that is new here, but most of it is very well done.  Kvothe's change of character between past and present is pretty reasonably explained, so by the end I was satisfied with some of what bothered me in the beginning.  So I recommend this to anyone who likes a good story (or a good story about a good story, depending how you look at it.)  It's not for those with a short attention span, as the action is few and far between, but as a good writer can prove, action can be provided with more than just blades.  If you're looking to check out what's new in fantasy, Rothfuss may prove worth your while.
1577314808|1.0|All you need to know about Eckhart Tolle is that he has been struggling with depression for most of his life. Every few years he will come out of it and be in a mania for several months, where he will write. The reason that his writings are so odd, vague, incoherent, mystical, fanatical, etc., is that that is how a manic person thinks. It is no wonder that many people feel good when they read Tolle's work; he is writing in a state of mania, which is a very energetic, invigorating felling, and this is the psychology he communicates to his audience. However, it must not be trusted, and the fact that mania is a pleasurable, feel good state, has absolutely no bearing on its truth value. He is psychologically unstable. He is no person to give spiritual advice.
B0010ZR160|5.0|Wow!  Bawstun has some purdy ruff language.  But, once you get past the rough language - and it is very realistic and real time for people in this situation - the story is very well told and very compelling.  I just could not stop or look away.  Wow.
B000VBP38C|2.0|This review pertains to the medium rather than the movie itself (which I really enjoy). Do not purchase this movie in HDDVD. There were parts where the film appeared \\"dotted,\\" almost like watching it on a computer screen. I was pretty excited about seeing the movie in high-def, but the quality was actually worse than the regular DVD. Bottom-line: don't waste your money on the HD, just purchase the standard DVD.
B000B8QEYC|5.0|All songs in the CD are perfect!! you can listen when you would like to relax, or play in your invitations.. If you are Enya lover,I strongly suggest this album...
0143038419|5.0|The reason that Eat, Pray, love has garnered so many negative reviews is most probably due to the enormous hype surrounding it. I read it before I knew anything about its popularity (I got it as a christmas present) and quite frankly when I first looked at the cover, I thought this book was going to be pretty stupid. I mean pray? love? Is this some sort of meandering and blundering casual self-help book in a market of already too many self help books? In addition, since I am a college undergrad, Elizabeth Gilbert's book about her divorce and subsequent spiritual journey has little to do with my life. It was with complete trepidation and reluctance that I began reading (It was Christmas break and I had plenty of free time).     To my great surprise, I was immediately drawn into this book. What made this book great is that Gilbert makes her extraordinary experiences relatable to someone in a completely different stage of life as me. I wasn't interested in reading about a mid-30's woman's life after her divorce yet this book is unbelievable absorbing. Sure, this book is all about Gilbert but who else would memoirs be about? It's not meant to be a political science book about the role of women in modern indonesian culture and etc. It's not really selfishness on Gilbert's part that she writes about herself; it's the genre. What's amazing is that such a huge amount of people, many outside the target audience such as myself, enjoy and relate to this book.    However, her writing, while engaging and witty, isn't as tight or concise as I would like and sometimes it tends to be slightly rambly. Gilbert's neither the wisest person or most skilled writer I've read. So why the 5 stars? Because this book isn't meant to be a great work of literature but a casual account of her personal story, and I was extremely touched by her experiences. Sure she was paid to write it before she went on her journey. However, this person put herself out there to tell her story and has gotten a tremendous response. Who are we to begrudge her success?
B0010358D0|1.0|I don't understand what they were trying to accomplish with this. The character interactions are like something a first time writer made. Their so abysmal and disinteresting. The reactions to situations in the movie are like a bunch of teenagers. The entire character development (or lack there of) was even more disappointing then the first. The first had at least a little bit of redeeming qualities even though the dialogue was fairly weak. This movie just made me wanna change the channel if it was on tv. If you're oohed and aahed by anything flashy and shiny, you might get something from this movie. Even then I doubt it as the action sequences aren't close to the 2004 Appleseed. The fact that the voices changed was even more disappointing. Every single character was done by a different voice actor. I mean come on. To some people the voices are just voices, but to me and many others the characters' established voices were kind of like their identity. Sometimes I got lost in who was actually talking if the voice was from off screen.     Basically take Applessed 2004 and smash it to death with a baseball bat and you get Ex Machina. A bastardized version of the 2004 make. I don't know if they just got too far in the film to turn and go, \\"It sucks lets start over.\\" But I really wish they would have just done that. Overall a movie that leaves a gross taste in my mouth. I'll be honest and say that I couldn't watch it all the way through. I couldn't really see the ridiculous characters doing, saying, being anything redeemable. If you wanna see it, find a friend who has it and laugh at him for buying it after you watch it.
0525948023|1.0|People, if you want to be enlightened, quit reading about it and be in the moment. Don't damn worry. If you must read, read Mr. Dalai Lama.  Or even Ram Dass.  This is predigested pablum, and you'll not get what you NEEED.
0895260131|5.0|Got it fast and in excellent condition!  Very direct and concise.  I haven't finished reading it yet, but so far the facts presented have checked out against other sources.  Highly recomend both this title and this seller.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|This movie was great.  I really enjoyed getting to see the resolution to the Ori story line that this movie offered.  Hopefully they will continue to offer a new movie every year or so to keep the franchise rolling.
031286504X|5.0|The story that started it all.  'I Am Legend' is the classic story that inspired countless zombie movies and stories, despite being technically about vampires.  This is not just about monsters,  but human nature, the environment, and our future in an evolving scientific world.  This book also contains several short stories by Matheson that are exceptional.  A must read.
B000002AH9|5.0|When I was very young, I heard my mother play this record, and I envisioned the singer as follows: she bathed in milk, ate chocolate for breakfast, wore violets and fur all year round, and took frequent vacations on other planets; equal parts Venus de Milo, Mother Earth, and the Tooth Fairy. Years later, I read Lady's book and found out that I was both 100% wrong and 100% right. I also started buying Lady's early works, and I understood how she arrived here.    Lady in Satin is a work of sublime majesty and grandeur. If you've ever wondered whether there was life after Bird and before Trane, buy the record. If you've ever wondered whether jazz can be sung with strings and a chorus, buy the record. If you've ever wondered whether Marvin Gaye or Robert Palmer got it from, buy the record. (Both claimed it as formative.) Whatever time of day or night you listen, dawn caresses the heavens for the duration of this album.
0345457692|5.0|This is an excellent cyber punk thriller.  In the future your mind can be recorded and loaded into a new body if you can afford it.  The story is fast moving and with lots of violence.  It makes you wonder if the future could be like this. After finishing this book I rushed to get the other two books in the series.  They were both excellent, but each book had nothing to do with the others except for the main character.  The second book is more of a hard science fiction book with aliens and spaceships.  You can read them in any order, it doesn't matter.  Richard K. Morgan is an excellent writer. Now I am reading another one of his books,\\"Market Forces\\", and it is also very good.  Other authors that I recommend are David Weber, and Peter F. Hamilton.
B0002KPIQY|5.0|After watching this film, Angelina Jolie's performance proved to me she is undoubtedly the greatest actress in the world now. Never has she given a more complex, emotional, memorable, and sexy performance as she does in Gia. Never have I seen her act more natural in a film as well. This movie is a must have!!!
1582701709|4.0|I think people are looking too deep into this book. Yes it's extreme in its views. Yes some of the ideas are absurd, but at the core it's a self-help book, and nobody can deny that many people have been affected positively by this book. It's meant to create inspiration, to install hope that we're creators of our own destiny. People that are saying this book is terrible are taking this book too literally. It's meant to remind us that we're in charge of our own destiny, that we can improve our life through positive thinking and positive action.
B00133KFGW|4.0|The film starts with two young musicians performing in two very different venues, Lyla as a cellist with the New York Philharmonic and Louis as a lead singer/guitar player in a rock band. Before I go too far, it is important to remember that this is more of a fairy tale than a believable story. That doesn't take anything away from the movie-you just have to turn off the rational part of your brain and enjoy the movie for what it is, a very entertaining story. The two 'hook up' afterwards at a party for a one night stand in which Lyla gets pregnant. Flash forward to Evan, an 11 year old boy living in a New York orphanage who is teased by the others because he hears music in his head which he believes is his mother & father calling him. Afraid of being adopted or sent to a foster home, he runs away to try and find his parents. The film follows the lives of the three who separately discover thru their music that all roads lead to NYC and a 'stand up and cheer' ending. A delightful and entertaining family film with great music. Enjoy. [...]
B0013FYTA8|4.0|Theory of a Deadman is back with their third album.  I see that the Nickelback comparisons are flying in full force once again.  In my opinion, the \\"influence\\" has worn off on this album.  Chad Kroeger did not contribute any songwriting on this album.  If fact, it appears several songs were written with the help of Tyler Connely's wife, Christine, which I found interesting.    Anyway, as my title suggests, the content has not waiverd much on this album.  One song, you have them singing about ending the relationship.  The next song, you have them singing about how good it is.  A person would get confused if they didn't know any better.  Nevertheless, it's another solid album that is up to par musically with the first two.  If straight-up rock is what you look for, this effort should suit you fine.  My personal favorites are \\"By The Way\\", \\"Not Meant To Be\\", and \\"Wait For Me\\".

0452289963|5.0|This was a very great book. Well written and very insightful as far as human nature,and the human phsychie. I now have a clearer vision of who I am and different areas in my life needing work. A whole lot of ah ha moments. Each time I read each day, I learned more than the day prior, both about myself and those around me.  Please read and study along with each line.......
B0016679JW|2.0|Yawn.........    To be honest, most of this album breaks absolutely no new ground or moves the band forward. Just more R.E.M. \\"expected\\" formula music.     Just three keepers on it. Save your money and only download these rockers:    - Horse to Water (Live version)  - Living Well Is the Best Revenge (Live version)  - Accelerate    I think the guys have really run out of gas - especially lyrically. Maybe it's time to call it quits and just do solo projects.
B0010X8NF0|5.0|I first saw this movie without \\"Hotel Chevalier\\" (the first 13 minute part with Jason Schwartzman and Natalie Portman in the hotel room) and I have to say I like it much better without it!  \\"Hotel Chevalier\\" just doesn't seem to fit with the rest of the movie (except for the matching luggage of course).  \\"The Darjeeling Limited\\" on it's own though I really adore.  There's no complex storyline or real plot twists, so this is not a movie for everyone.  I can understand how some people will dislike it and feel that it's unorganized or pointless.  However, the real point of watching the movie is the interaction between the three brothers (Schwartzman, Owen Wilson, and Adrien Brody) and their efforts to shed their baggage, literally.  They are brothers but don't really seem to know each other, they are on a train that is richly colored and exotic but ends up getting lost, lurking in the background is the never totally clarified death of their dad, and a mysterious mother who has gone MIA in her maternal role.  It's not a complete story, more of an outline that the viewers are trusted to fill in themselves.  Wilson's character has an itinerary for their spiritual awakening and mysterious bandages around his head.  Schwartzman is the quiet brother who writes short stories with characters no one believes are fictional.  Brody (who gives a casually great performance) is wearing their dad's prescription sunglasses, carrying his car keys and believes that he was the father's 'favorite'.  I've seen other Wes Anderson movies, but I have never liked one as much as the \\"Darjeeling Limited\\".  I knew as soon as I saw the opening sequence with Bill Murray running for the train and being overtaken by Brody (with music by the Kinks playing) that I was going to love watching this film.  It's not only beautiful to watch because of the vivid colors, settings and music, but also because of the lack of storyline to keep track of. This movie deals with loss and how different people cope in adarkly deadpan comedic way, it's not trying to tackle any world problems.  It's best to just sit back and enjoy the ride on the \\"Darjeeling Limited\\".
0151013837|5.0|This is a wonderful story. I decided to buy this edition because of the illustrations. The colors are brilliant and beautiful.
B000W1V5VU|2.0|I loved the slickly packaged, star-studded fluff that was \\"Ocean's 11 (the remake, of course).\\"  After the farcical nonsense that was \\"Ocean's 12,\\" director Steve Soderbergh promised that \\"Ocean's 13\\" would be an assured return to form. With the addition of the Godfather, himself, Al Pacino, and the welcome return of actress Ellen Barkin I was primed for a cool time.  The result in Blackjack jargon- House Bust!    \\"Ocean's 13\\" is nothing more than a remake of \\"Ocean's 11\\" minus the palpable fun and energy.  With no Julia Roberts this time around to provide any romantic heat, writers Brian Koppelman and David Levian bring back these icy-cool Robin Hoods for another casino raid.  Again the patsy is another thug like Vegas tycoon(Pacino)who has fleeced Reuben Tishkoff (Elliot Gould), our hero Danny Ocean's mentor, of millions and literally breaking the man's heart.  Seeking revenge (think \\"The Sting\\"), A-List stars George Clooney (Ocean), Brad Pitt, and Matt Damon and the rest of familiar faces from the previous movies dream up another elaborate caper (these thieves all seem to be members of MENSA) to embarrass Pacino and also steal his prized possession of diamonds.      Soderbergh is a gifted filmmaker, of course,  and has managed to infuse all the \\"Ocean\\" movies with a snappy, retro 60's vibe.  However, the problem lies in the fact that after \\"Ocean's 11\\" there was no discernible reason to see any of these characters again (unless if you're a greedy studio executive with an eye on the box office).  Thus, \\"Ocean's 13\\" is another pointless, soulless sequel-the proverbial, dull tasting, third glass of beer.  The lack of urgency shows in the material and the actors. Clooney and company all interact as if they were stoic world leaders during an economic summit.   Pitt, in particular, seems visibly bored and I can hardly blame him.  His part more than ever could have been filled by well-dressed department store mannequin and he oddly disappears through out the midsectionof this movie (\\"Hey George, gotta go!  Angelina and the kids need me!\\").  Pacino seems game at first with an edgy performance but ultimately is made to look wide-eyed and ridiculous while Barkin does indeed smolder as Pacino's bitchy first lieutenant.  Also comic veterans Carl Reiner and David Paymer are among the few with a twinkle in their eyes.      It's better to skip the adventures of Ocean and his boys and watch Jules Dasin's grittier \\"Rififi- the granddaddy of all nifty capers.
B000NOKA0S|5.0|The songs on this cd are classic Cohen.  If you like Leonard Cohen, you will love this cd.  Turn down the lights, turn the volume up, sit down and just contemplate his voice and words.  An awesome poet, songwriter, singer.
B0013BNY2Q|5.0|This is only a bigger surprise than The Black Crowes recent strong return because it's even better.  I think it is a complete return to form and as such qualifies as a minor miracle.<br /><br />This is what rock albums were once:  beautifully paced, programmed to emotionally get you into the songs, and make you want to hear more.  You can read this as NO FILLER!  R.E.M. is back with a vengence.  This album rocks; the guitars both sweetly jangle and snarl with distortion.  Keyboards, if there are any, do not get in the way.  The producer brought Mike Mills great high harmonies back up in the mix. The sound is right and the songs are strong, heck any track could be a single.  When your finished with the 35 minutes it lasts your still wanting more.  Replay never seemed like a good option until now.  Recommended
0753820250|3.0|This is a mysterious and complicated story which covers a ten year time period in a boy/young man's life. The plot is summarized well in many other reviews; in my opinion, the characters were richly drawn and true to their individual descriptions. The story is told through Daniel's perceptions and his point of view can easily be appreciated and enjoyed, but not always followed. At times, I thought I needed a color coded chart to keep up with the relationships and time periods being described. I would suggest reading this book if you have time for long, undisturbed sittings. It's not advisable to read short excerpts, then put the book down for a day or so. Although I DID want to finish the story to find the solution to the mysteries (and there are several), I was not so intrigued that I  could not put the book down.

B000RO8T7K|5.0|This is a welcome latest release of the German violinist Frank Peter Zimmermann.  Zimmermann is a 'violinist's violinist' who performs with great elan and musical humility such that his total musicality is refreshingly rewarding yet non-obtrusive.  His interpretations of all the major concerti on disc have consistently shown a steadfast dedication to singing and musical integrity rather than an opportunism for showcasing brilliant technical virtuosity.  Rather, all of Zimmermann's considerable technical ability is devoted to the expressive realization of the works such that the composer's voice is always heard first without the common imposition of the performer's 'persona' onto the music.  Zimmermann is therefore a rarer breed of violinist whose great expressivity can be overlooked due to his more reticent showmanship.<br /><br />His recording of Ysaye's solo works offers undeliable evidence of this most 'comfortable' and rare marriage between virtuosity and musical voicing.  Ysaye's sonatas have never sounded so musically enjoyable to me compared to most recordings of Ysaye which may be either characterized by sterile perfection or the stress of hearing the very real physical challenge of bringing these works to life.  Not so with Zimmermann.<br /><br />These readings of Bach's sonatas for violin and keyboard are likewise most enjoyable to listen to for their musical sensitivity coupled with a real sense of intellect that is so characteristic of Bach's compositions.  The mind is an equally present force driving this music in addition to the heart.  Zimmermann does not fuss with any concerns of period-performance authenticity (most thankfully) and instead plays Bach with a freely expressive yet well-prepared style that is fully mindful and acknowledging of the time period and instruments existing when Bach wrote these works.  Again, the music is central to all other issues in Zimmermann's recording which puts Bach first and the performer and other considerations second.  Perhaps Zimmermann's self-effacement is what has kept his profile as a fine violinist less visible than other violinists who are promoted with so much publicity and self-flamboyance such as Vengerov, Kennedy, and Mutter?<br /><br />The pianist Enrico Pace is likewise a beautifully-matched full collaborator with Zimmermann.  Pace allows the musical line to begin, breathe, grow, and finish while sustaining a beautiful, non-interrupted line throughout the movements.  And he moves seemingly effortlessly in unison with Zimmermann while they share counterpoint, dialogue, and tuttis.  There is real propulsion to these performances with a fleetness to both bow and keys that is infused with a true sense of being alive rather performing in a vacuum or on auto-pilot.  Pace also shines during his solo movement of the sixth sonata.<br /><br />You will most definitely enjoy listening to this fine 2-disc set.  The sound quality of the recording is beautifully balanced and engineered providing a very realistic sound picture as if one is hearing this in a recital hall.  It was recorded in November 2006 at the Grunwald Music School in Germany.immermann's self-effacement is what has kept his profile as a fine violinist less visible than other violinists who are promoted with so much publicity and self-flamboyance such as Vengerov, Kennedy, and Mutter?

1580176941|5.0|I just bought this book over the weekend, after searching online for information on frosting cookies.  I belive my prayers were heard and answered.  This is a neat book, with tons of information.  The only thing I didn't like, was the way the book was arranged.  I think they should have put all the instructions at the beginning and showed the lovely pictures at the end.  Other than that, it was a great book!
B0012RCMBA|5.0|After not having listened to this album for over a decade because it was not available on cd domestically until now, it still holds up like I remember! From the unreal guitar work of Steve Vai (who replaced the incredible Yngwie Malmsteen no less!) to the searing vocals of Graham Bonnett, this record is a lost classic. Anyone that thinks that this might be some weird '80's hair metal record are wrong! There is lots of good ole rockin' with all the cool surprises that Steve Vai brings to any project but with a focus on actual songs and not just over the top shredding. The remastering work is stellar too. Any fan of either Vai or Bonnett MUST get a hold of this cd ASAP! It will not disappoint!
B0010YSD7M|5.0|This is the best series ever.  Sorry that it came to an end.  Movie is very good. Hope they produce more

B000FGGE68|4.0|Dazzling visual style, eye-popping special effects, wild imagination, thrilling martial arts, balletic violence, an absence of gratuitous sadism, and probably the most beautiful woman in the movies today add up to a feast for the eyes - a visual poem, a live comic book. This is the movie Sin City wished to be.
B000VBJEEG|4.0|The blonde and I went to see this movie as a compromise since she accomanied me to Transformers last summer. Well it turned out to be a very cute movie, and we both enjoyed it. I bought the DVD for her for Christmas, to this day it's one of her favorites.

B000002UE9|1.0|Just horrible glam rock!  Glam at its worse really!  What makes people think this is good?  Saw them in concert (I was on a date) when they were touring for this album and I had to laugh watching CC Deville doing his solo: 15 minutes of fingertapping two notes.  Wow! What talent!  Poison's music is just atrociously amateurish to say the least.  Someone with just elementary skills can play this stuff.  The lyrics are just more of your typical glam stuff, \\"Dirty girl, party time, yeah, yeah, yeah!\\" Just terrible stuff!  Listen to early Ratt, Crue, Bon Jovi, or just KISS for glam, not this junk.  Even Warrant is better than this stupid crap!
0452289963|5.0|Awesome!  This is a book that I did not just read to enjoy... I read it to digest it.  I'll read in again and again.  There is just so much in the book that I want to use in my life.  Thank you, Edkhart for writing the book... and Thank you, Oprah for bringing the book to the attention of the world.  You have both done a great service to humanity.
B000002L7V|2.0|Dio's last album with Vivian Campbell. Great vocals but just terrible lyrics and the guitar work just doesn't measure up.  This is where Dio's mystery lyrics get just downright annoying: meaningless and generic.  'Last In Line' is the last good album Dio made: avoid 'Sacred Heart' and everything released afterwards as it just doesn't measure up in music and the 'magic' lyrics just get cheesier and cheesier. Dio's best stuff is with Sabbath and Rainbow really. He also did two great tracks with Kerry Livgren on 'Seeds of Change': 'Living for the King' and 'Mask of the Great Deceiver.' That's something you wont hear anywhere else, Dio singing Christian rock!
B000QGEB12|5.0|One of the most perfect movies ever made, just got a little better. If you've never seen Kung Fu Hustle, SEE IT! If you have seen Kung Fu Hustle, SEE IT AGAIN! This is the unaltered movie as it was originally meant to be seen.    This \\"Axe-Kickin' Edition\\" doesn't add a whole lot to the previous American release, it just puts back some of the details that were edited out of the original Hong Kong version, presumably for the delicate, easily offended American masses. Nothing too dramatic, just a little blood and such. For some reason Hollywood seemed to think that American audiences couldn't handle it. Which I don't get at all. I've seen other \\"R\\" rated movies with 20 times as much blood and violence, as the Hong Kong version of this movie. Plus the violence in Kung Fun Hustle is presented in such a totally over-the-top manner that makes it seem much less harsh than the mostly realistic violence found in American movies. (Like the Oscar winning \\"No Country For Old Men\\" for example).    Kung Fu Hustle is not a \\"spoof\\" of martial arts movies, it's more of an \\"homage\\" with a wild mix of crazy, laugh out loud humor and amazing martial arts action. Bottom line, if you like fun and awesomeness you will love Kung Fu Hustle. I guarantee it.
B000000H42|4.0|Great satanic metal without being thrash. If you haven't heard King Diamond's voice before, you you may want to listen to it first as his voice ranges from very high pitched falsetto to guttural from one bar to the next. If you don't like falsetto voices then you probably won't like King Diamond. What really makes Mercyful Fate great is the talent of the musicians. Great talent all around with alternating lead guitars.  Although I find 'Melissa' to be superior in terms of music, this album still delivers quite a punch. Every song on this album rocks!
0954510364|5.0|I have a copy of this as well as the one with Wyeth illustrations. I prefer this for the kids as there are more illustrations throughout the book, it is a bit larger and pages printed to give a parchment look. The quality of the illustrations is outstanding. This is a beautiful book.
B000002LCE|2.0|Dio's mystery lyrics get just downright irritating and generically bland with songs such as 'I Could Have Been A Dreamer.'  Good replacement for Campbell but the guitar work is not all that great.  'Last In Line' is the last good album Dio made: avoid 'Sacred Heart' and everything released afterwards as it just doesn't measure up in music and the 'magic' lyrics just simply become lame.

B000P0J02E|5.0|I love movie scores and this is one of the best.  I love all of the \\"Pirates\\" scores...but this one is by far the best.  It includes all the themes from the previous movies.  And the new themes are GORGEOUS!
B000002L61|5.0|Last good album by Dio and the last good collaboration with Vivian Campbell on guitar.  Great vocals as usual and some memorable songs like 'We Rock' and 'Last in Line.'  'I Speed at Night' is good too but most of the other songs are pretty forgettable.  Dio's mystery lyrics just get old after a while.  I'm sure Dio himself doesn't know what the hell he's singing about half the time!  'Last In Line' is the last good album Dio made: avoid Sacred Heart and everything released afterwards as it just doesn't measure up in music and the 'magic' lyrics just get cheesier and cheesier.  Dio's best stuff is with Sabbath and Rainbow really.  He also did two great tracks with Kerry Livgren on 'Seeds of Change': 'Living for the King' and 'Mask of the Great Deceiver.'

B000UNYJXQ|5.0|What can I say about Michael Moore?  He's my favorite filmmaker and quite frankly one of my heroes.  There is NO reason why the \\"richest nation in the world\\" can't give its people the healthcare they deserve.  When rescue workers of 9/11 can't get the care they need, yet the prisoners who've been convicted of having a hand in 9/11 are in Guantanamo with full access to all the care they need, then there is a clear problem.  My favorite part of this movie (and the one that makes me cry incessantly) is when, while in Cuba, Michael decides to take these 9/11 workers to a Cuban hospital to see if they can be treated.  Guess what?  This nation that we look down on gave them all FREE care.  This is an amazing, eye-opening movie!
B000RZGFZC|5.0|Just another great album by Slayer. Slayer is a band you either love or hate. If you like this album then you will probably like all of their other albums except perhaps for 'Undisputed Attitude' because it's mostly punk cover songs. Slayer has always been consistant in style and quality: they just never sold out like other speed/thrash bands like Metallica, etc.  Otherwise, every album by Slayer rocks and this one is just as great with songs like 'War Ensemble', 'Expendable Youth' and 'Dead Skin Mask.' The ultimate mosh band.  Enjoy!

0452289963|5.0|[[ASIN:B0015LS12W A NEW EARTH by Eckhart Tolle]]     This book has the potential to change the world both through individual and universal consciousness.  The pages become a personal journal of enlightenment and I highly recommend that one reads with pen in hand allowing yourself to write your own pearls of wisdom in response to what your heart will speak to you.    If you have trouble relating to the early chapters, I would encourage you to keep going because at some point you will recognize the truth of what Eckhart Tolle has been inspired to share with you and the world.    This book is not a sermon or another 'how to' book.  This book is a mirror and it will reflect back to you who you are, how you were made and how to be who you are meant to be.  It is not always easy to look into a mirror when looking with your eyes only, but this book will have you looking at your reflection with your heart and the love you will feel for yourself will transcend to the love for every living element because you will connect with the truth that we are all ONE.    Suzanne Sjogren
B0013ISU0A|5.0|I must disagree with the previous reviewers about this release. The DVD is short, but worth the exrtra few bucks. The footage from the live rehearsal is terrific and the in-studio footage is a hoot. Anyone who could be curmudgeonly over a short film that catches Mike Mills attempting (and failing) over and over to capture the word \\"water\\" on tape is just a sourpuss. It's hilarious! And, no offense to anyone who has served in the military, but for the previous reviewer to use a review of anything by REM, who have vocally opposed the Bush adsministration from the outset, to disparage the band is ridiculous. To say that you hate the DVD part of this release because you don't like REM's political views is like saying you hate Metallica's new album because you only listen to flute music from the Andes.
B00111L0MY|2.0|Seeing as how most of the reviews present here focus on the story, and it's covered quite well, I'm here to give a few quick comments on the quality of the Blu-ray disc itself.    Starting with the audio, I would have to say that the sound is lackluster yet passable.  This isn't a movie that you'd watch expecting to have your socks blown off by the audio.  The uncompressed Dolby soundtrack is just fine, but nothing is lost by stepping down to Dolby Digital soundtrack you'd also find on the standard DVD.    For a Blu-ray disc, the video quality is poor, average for a standard DVD.  Oh well, at least the previews, that you might just skip through to get to the feature film, look pretty.  Basically this isn't a disc that you'll pop in to impress your friends with how good Blu-ray is to behold.    Now, having seemingly poo-pooed this BD, the question is should you buy the BD or the DVD.  Well at the $19.95 price point I have no problem saying to go ahead and buy the BD, however, if you find the DVD for less money, save a few bucks and flip for the standard DVD.  Either way, you'll likely enjoy the show.
B000FS9FCG|5.0|In one word....BRILLIANT!!!  This movie is incredible.  Hugo Weaving did an excellent job, he is the only one that could have pulled it off like that, with his voice especially.  I loved this movie, his words are inspiring.  Love love love it
B000JLSM00|5.0|This classic came up alive and flawless after Blu-Ray technology. A must buy for the fans!
6305736650|2.0|As a true classic should be, this movie is so good that you actually look forward to viewing it again and again just so you can be sure you didn't miss anything the last time you viewed it.  The cast is excellent, the acting sublime, the soundtrack is inspired and the screenplay is also exquisite.  Special mention should be made for actors like Peter Lorre, Sidney Greenstreet and Claude Rains who are excellent here just as they were in other film classics such as \\"The Maltese Falcon\\" and \\"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\\".  Although this is not Bogart's best performance (for that you'll need to see \\"The Treasure of the Sierra Madre\\"), he still puts in an excellent performance here.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this DVD version is very poor, especially so for the sound quality which is very poor.  The volume levels are very soft and although the picture quality is much better, there is still room for improvement.  With the advent of Blu-ray now, here's hoping that Warner will make the effort to produce a much better restoration project on this film improving upon the picture quality as well as and especially upon the sound quality adding DTS with THX or at least Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround options to really give this film the truly great restoration that it deserves.  Also, the Special Features are really sparse comprising really only of an interesting documentary hosted by Bogart's wife Bacall but truly more and better extras could have been added to this film masterpiece as well.<br /><br />Contentwise there is no disputing that this is one of the best films of all time however this DVD version is not befitting of such a great film and my recommendation is to wait for a much better restoration job to surface which is inevitable at least in the Blu-ray format very soon.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|An excellent board game that is surprisingly fun and competitive.  The only downside is that the game maxes out at 4 people (unless you buy the expansion pack).  A cross between Risk & Monopoly.
0452287588|5.0|A great book to  be  read  carefully , over and over again , in order to understand the spiritual contents of it and to prectice  the life changing wisdom  .
0810994739|5.0|For my grandson's 9th birthday I gave both of the Diary books. I also gave him a blank journal,just in case.  It's now a month later and he told me he not only finished both books, he is writing and drawing in his journal. What a great inspiration for young children to be interested in writing stories. Three cheers to author, Jeff Kinny.
0452289963|5.0|I have just finished this book and found it very enlightening.  It sounds like a wonderful way to lead your life.  There were many interesting ideas in the book to cut down on stress.  It is a wonderful way to look at life and enjoy it more.  I found it easy to understand and hard to put down as I wanted to know more, and more.  I highly recommend this for anyone who has a lot of stress in their life and are looking for a more peaceful way to live.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|One of the best movie series out on Blu-Ray and DVD.  Would recommend anyone to purchase and watch it, and great as a gift!
B00013RC8O|4.0|This is not the movie I thought it was when ordering but I am far from disappointed. I have one of those you never know what's next kind of teens and she actaully watched this with me and more-so really liked it and has carted it around to watch with friends. She has seen it many times now and *gets* something different out of it all the time. I felt ripped off at the finish, maybe because i just wanted more, I really liked the character too and wanted better for him....oh Mom it is just a movie I am told.
B0013BNY2Q|2.0|Lots of loud guitar, lots of monotone singing, no melodies to speak of.  Or maybe it's just the same melody over and over again.    I give it two stars because it's extremely short and better than a Britney Spears recording.

B00133KFGW|4.0|A great family film. It only misses a 5 star rating because of some small confusions... like the need to listen very carefully to be aware of the passage of time. ie. Months pass when August is at Julliard and in the clutches of Wizard. You need to be aware of that. While the guitar playing seems to develop extremely quickly, again we must be aware of the passage of time and that the techniques employed are reasonable quick to learn when using DADGAD tunings. (Perhaps the biggest annoyance was seeing him play piano notes going in reverse to the actual sounds.) There are also 2 deleted scenes that might have been better restored - for understanding - even if it extended the length of the movie. 1. The scene where his mother goes to the orphanage and meets his friend. 2. The scene, underground, where Wizard realises that he has to let him go. All that being so, this is still a 'feelgood' movie where, like a fantasy, one has to suspend reality a little. And it is not beyond reality that perhaps a little 'Mozart-type' prodigy would absorb musical knowledge as quickly as the film suggests. (I have tutored musicians who have developed 10 years ability inside 2 years.) For a similar type story see 'Vitus' - in that film the playing is 'real'.... not faked! Teo Gheorghiu is actually a piano prodigy!

B000001IQH|4.0|but what you really have here is good, catchy, even poppy, songs that ebb between streetpunk and ska.  Strong organ solos on a couple tracks.  Great lyrics.  \\"Out Come the Wolves\\" is a pretty big leap from the gritty streetpunk of \\"Let's Go.\\" There next album, \\"Life Won't Wait\\" is more in the vein of \\"Out Come the Wolves\\" and I highly recomend it to anybody who likes this record.  Unfortunatley, I can't recomend any of the more recent records.

B00005JKN9|4.0|Martin Scorsese's Gangs of New York is hugely ambitious.  He attempts to tell the story of the origin of the country in a violent, unceremonious bloodbath.  This is a wonderful film even for its flaws.  Just as my heading says, it is a near masterpiece.  The flaws are there, every reviewer will tell you this.    One of the problems with the film is the character's motivations.  Amsterdam returning to avennge his father's death is perfect, but some of his actions seem faulty.  He appears to be fickle for no reason at times in the film.  Johnny (played by Henry Thomas) is the same way.  He betrays his \\"friend\\" for no other reason than to drive the plot forward.  I could go on in detail about the miscuses of other characters, touching on Diaz's lack of pickpocketing after it served its purpose for the storyline but I'll move on to what I liked about this movie.    For one, it's absolutely beautiful, the sets, the lighting, the shots, everything.  The recreation of Old New York is magnificent.  I can't imagine why (COUGH*Harbey Weinstein*COUGH) the Academy did not award Dante Ferretti and Martin Scorsese for this wonderfully designed film.  The cinematography is just as excellent, with the scenes popping, figurately and at times literally, off the screen.  The colors are vibrant and exuberant, the buildings the pefect shade.  It looks remarkable.    Another strong point is its absorbing power.  Once the story gets going, you just watch, amazed at what a great job Scorsese did.  It's not without its pacing problems, but it does a great job of keeping you entertained.  The last thirty minutes is when everything falls apart though.  The grand draft riots has no buildup.  It occurs, which, if it had happened at any other point in the film it would have been all right, at the end, when you need a dynamic ending to push the film into the epic stratisphere.    A near masterpiece that, in the future, will be remembered as one of Scorsese's greatest accomplishments, probably right below [[ASIN:B000286RP2 Mean Streets (Special Edition)]], [[ASIN:B000R8YC18 Taxi Driver (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)]], [[ASIN:B00062IVKS Raging Bull (Special Edition)]] and [[ASIN:B000286RKW GoodFellas (Two-Disc Special Edition)]] and in the same company with [[ASIN:B00006RCNV The King of Comedy]], [[ASIN:1559409037 The Last Temptation of Christ - Criterion Collection]], [[ASIN:B00003CX8S The Age of Innocence]], and [[ASIN:B0007VZ9DK Casino (Widescreen 10th Anniversary Edition)]].    Now, for the DVD specs.  It features a great and informative comentary from Scorsese.  It must be heartbreaking talking over a truncated version of one of your most personal projects.  Two desing featurettes: Costume and Production.  A Discovery Channel documentary on the History of the Five Points, some other Five Points information and U2 \\"The Hands that Built America\\" (Golden Globe \\"Best Original Song\\" winner) video.    Like stated, it's a near perfect film from one of America's greatest working and overall directors.  It's not a must see, but it's real close.  The violence may be a little unnerving but it's definitely needed to tell a story like this.  I hate the fact that the film's split over two discs but this still earns a high recommendation from me.    Highly recommended.
B000VWE5OY|4.0|\\"Torchwood,\\" a spin-off of the revived \\"Doctor Who\\" series, is a strange bird.  It can be one of the greatest shows around and then tank miserably.  The show centers around the Torchwood Institute's Cardiff operation, headed up by the dashingly handsome (and quite possibly immortal) Captain Jack Harkness (played with excellent flair by John Barrowman).  He leads a small ragtag group of scientists, specialists, etc. who set out to protect the world from bizarre aliens and other creatures that make their way to our home planet via a rift in time and space.  Some of the visitors are good, but the bad ones get the attention.  The team includes Tosh (Naoko Mori), a shy computer specialist who longs for Owen (Burn Gorman), the cocky and not-all-too-likeable team doctor.  Ianto (Gareth David-Lloyd) is the quiet and always reliable clean-up man who is basically a butler in the same vein as Batman's Alfred (although much younger).  The team is rounded out by Suzie and eventual team newbie, Gwen Cooper (Eve Myles), who adds heart to the team.<br /><br />Fans of the new \\"Doctor Who\\" will recognize Captain Jack.  He's still the dashing and cocky hero that the Doctor and Rose met, but throughout the season his character becomes more mysterious and, at times, morbidly dark and heartless.  He is the glue that holds this show together.<br /><br />What \\"Who\\" fans might not recognize is the heavy adult tone of \\"Torchwood.\\"  The language, violence and sexual content go way beyond family-friendly.  This helps and hinders the show at the same time.  The language is about as bad as a PG-13 movie for the most part, but a few scenes get (necessarily) R-rated.  The violence is also essential for the most part, but the action can be too much for younger viewers.  I felt like much of the sexual content was thrown in just because it could be.  I have no problem with this sort of content but I do believe it should be used only when it adds to the story.  In \\"Day One,\\" a sex-crazed alien that survives off of orgasms (yes, I said orgasms), makes for an interesting and hilarious story.  While some may not like seeing homosexual content, the episode \\"Captain Jack Harkness\\" uses just that develop the character of Harkness even more.  In other episodes, there are brief encounters that really needn't be there.<br /><br />The series has some excellent episodes, such as \\"Small Worlds,\\" a downright creepy thriller involving the activity of fairies in our world.  Another bright spot is \\"Random Shoes,\\" told from the viewpoint of a dead man following the Torchwood team as they investigate his death.  It's funny, interesting and even touching at times.  The top of the heap as far as series one goes, though, is \\"Countrycide.\\"  The team visits a rural town where the body count skyrockets in cycles.  Who or what is killling off these people?  The answer will shock you.<br /><br />Of course, for all that is great about this series, there are a few clunkers that almost turned me off to the show entirely.  First was \\"Cyberwoman,\\" which showcases a relationship of my favorite Torchwood member, Ianto.  He's keeping his semi-Cyber girlfriend hidden in the bowels of Torchwood hoping to find help for her.  The Cybermen are my favorite classic \\"Who\\" villains, but even I have to say that Ianto's Cyber-girlfriend was too hokey to digest.  The ending almost saves the episode, but it's the biggest downfall of the series so far.  Secondly is \\"Combat,\\" which features a very interesting fight club that is used to develop Owen's character a bit more.  Unfortunately, it all falls flat in the end.  Also, a couple of episodes, \\"Greeks Bearing Gifts\\" and \\"Out of Time,\\" are mediocre at best.<br /><br />The DVD release is very good, with excellent extras including \\"Torchwood Declassified\\" and extensive looks into each character and special effects.<br /><br />So, you take the good with the bad and you end up with a new series that has wonderful highs and horrible lows.  I would recommend this series as a purchase since there are more pros than cons, but do not let your chidren watch this until they are much older.  I understand that many \\"Who\\" fans were completely turned off by the series' abrasive ways, but it's okay with me.  Remember, this isn't \\"Doctor Who,\\" it's a whole new animal.han cons, but do not let your chidren watch this until they are much older.

B00005JPTI|4.0|Director Francis Lawrence deserves a standing ovation for portraying such haunting images of a deserted Manhattan, its streets and thoroughfares overgrown with weeds and teaming with wild life.  A desolate Times Square long silenced into decay and deterioration has real impact on the viewer.  These images, combined with an exceptional performance by Will Smith, make I AM LEGEND a haunting, yet ultimately satisfying, experience.<br /><br />Smith, with the help of a German Shepherd, aptly carries this movie by himself.  I've seen this actor in numerous films, and in my opinion he's never been better.  The viewer shares Smith's range of emotions--from his determination to eradicate a deadly virus that has decimated the human population, to his fear and terror of the mutated zombies who survived the infection, to his grief over the loss of his family. . .to his utter loneliness and despair.  Intermingled with flashbacks depicting the once-promising virus (a cure for cancer) unleashed in New York, Lawrence and Smith convey a story that systematically builds tension and delivers suspense right to its tragic end.<br /><br />My biggest complaint (and it didn't take away from my enjoyment of this film) had to do with the cartoonish appearance of the zombies.  Bald, charcoal-colored, hairless, shirtless, these monsters with super-human strength and athleticism looked like they belonged in a video game, not a motion picture.  One can only wonder how much more real and convincing this story would have been had real actors been used. . .<br /><br />Regarding the special features of this two-disc set, the first disc includes four animated short features depicting other survivors coping with loneliness and/or despair in other parts of the world--and all four include some very disturbing images.  The second disc is another version of the entire film, featuring what is dubbed a \\"controversial ending.\\"  Having viewed it, I am so glad the theatrical release ended the way it did, as the alternate ending was over the top--way too much of a \\"feel good\\" ending, and not in keeping with the post-apocalyptic theme of the story.  And for a plethora of extra features and segments the viewer is advised to insert Disc #2 into his/her PC and go online--something that is above and beyond the call of duty of at least this couch potato.  Setting these drawbacks aside, I AM LEGEND is recommended viewing, a haunting story of loneliness, tension, and heart-pounding suspense.<br />--D.

0316113506|5.0|In this groudbreaking book, Harvard psychiatrist, John J. Ratey, MD, takes us on a fascinating exploration of the impact of exercise on the brain. Most people just think exercise is good for overall health. But what's extraordinary is that exercise is the best thing you can do for your brain, not just your body. Exercise reduces your risk for Alzheimer's by 50%. It produces the protein BDNF, which is like Miracle-Gro for your brain. Exercise can mitigate the symptoms of depression better than drugs like Zoloft. Exercise can help your productivity at work. I could go on and on. After reading the book, you will have 100 reasons why you need to do aerobic exercise (for your brain) every single day.    SPARK is a terrific compliment to John Medina's new book, BRAIN RULES (full disclosure: I'm the publisher of the book). One of the 12 Brain Rules is \\"exercise boosts brain power.\\" It's impossible to read these books without wanting to get up and move. Unforunately, our workplaces and schools keep us in cubicles or desks for 8 hours a day. I hope these books can do something about this problem. Sitting goes against everything we are built to do.

Where has \\"Heavenly Creatures\\" been hiding all these years from my film viewing????    This story about the ultra-intense relationship of two girls from from 1952 to 1954 in New Zealand who end up committing matricide held my attention in all ways for the brief 109 minutes that it was playing.  Melanie Lynskey and Kate Winslet, under the direction of a pre-Jackson   [[ASIN:B000654ZK0 The Lord of the Rings - The Motion Picture Trilogy (Platinum Series Special Extended Edition)]] and pre-Winslet  [[ASIN:B000ANVQ0K Titanic (Three-Disc Special Collector's Edition)]] and pre-Lynskey  [[ASIN:B000GTJSTY The L Word - The Complete Seasons 1-3]] that was mind boggling.

A true story that is absorbing, shocking and expertly filmed.  No need to go any further!

0452289963|5.0|If the Christians don't like it, it should be really good!!    Ok jokes aside.. I read it.. twice, and think that it can be of great help to the earnest spiritual seeker. Many of the concepts are indeed hard to wrap your mind, since it's such a different way of handling our being. We're so accustomed to dealing with everything on the thinking level, that we never consider any other options. This book has the potential to change that. Highly recommended!
B00133KFGW|2.0|Musically, this film was good and the 'music' and 'musicianship' content was great!  A few faux pas on the playing scenes, but if you're not a seasoned musician, you'd never catch them.  HOWEVER, the story was nothing more than warm, fuzzy, fluff.  There were a lot of 'gaps' in the story and the realism was pretty lacking.  I understand this wasn't intended to be a documentary or anything like that, and I wasn't looking for spoon-fed information, I was simply disappointed with the 'movie' as a whole.  The acting side of things was pretty tragic.  Robin Williams was good, in a disturbing way (due to the character), but the storyline and 'depth' in the other characters was pretty shallow.  If you're looking for low-substance, warm, fuzzy, family film ... this one works well.  If you are wanting something more 'real' or at least a sense of 'believable', then it's not.

0385338724|5.0|Fresh, fun, and fabulous describes Kinsella's newest heroine, the indefatigable Lexie Smart.  Waking up in a hospital bed and realizing she has lost three years of her life is no laughing matter, but being fascinated by her shiny new hair, pearly white teeth, ultra-toned body, and eye-catching manicure softens the blow.  Frustrated by not remembering anything past the night when, at age 25, the snaggle-toothed carpet seller was getting smashed with her best friends after losing out on a company bonus and being stood up by her loser boyfriend the night before her Dad's funeral, Lexie  begins an often frustrating but always interesting journey to find out how she became, at age 28, a senior executive of her company, married to  a handsome husband she can't remember,  and at home in a posh loft apartment with pieces of furniture and art she could never dream of affording.<br /><br />Her new life is too perfect until she discovers her former friends want nothing to do with her, her husband's right-hand man tells her they are having an affair, and her sweet baby sister has become an extortionist.  How Lexie sorts out what happened in the missing three years will have you alternately gasping and laughing.  Sure, you may have to suspend reality a bit, but the trade-off is an entertaining story that is light and breezy and sure to be a hit with Kinsella's legions of fans.  I never thought she'd be able to top the fun of the Shopaholic books, but I think she actually did it with this one.  Not only is Lexie as endearing as Becky Bloomwood, but the story is much more suspenseful as little by little we come to understand what happened to Lexie to move her out of her struggling, lackluster existence to become the shining star of her crowd.

B0014EVO4M|4.0|This is a great soundtrack and I love listening to Eddide Vedder. Every song on the album is great which is not something you find very often.    The thing that keeps this from 5 stars though is the album is just too short! There are barely over 30 minutes of music and most of the songs are really short. The longest song, Guaranteed, has a long pause in the middle (I hate that).

1401307450|5.0|I've been a fan of the Red Hot Chili Peppers for a while now and just recently decided to read Anthony Kiedis' book. I'm so glad I did (and wish I would have done it sooner)! What a highly entertaining, surprising, fascinating book! I literally couldn't put it down! I've always been intrigued by Kiedis' lyrics and the meanings behind his songs so it was very interesting to read how many of his songs were written and the true meaning behind them. Kiedis doesn't hold anything back in this book and is highly explicit and honest, which made for an absolutely excellent read. 5 Stars for sure!
B00007K02F|3.0|Jane Eyre is by far the most modern and cinematic of the Great Eight novels by the \\"Austen/Bronte Team\\" simply because it boasts a woman protagonist who never leaves center stage, who has the grit, complexity, intelligence, and character to infuse any length movie with utterly fascinating rhythms. This movie seizes on one of those chords and strums it relentlessly. The result is a pretty good souffle but one that's missing a few key ingredients.<br /><br />Anna Paquin as the young Jane is surprisingly emotionless and squinty; she makes clear that the film will keep Jane's passion out of the mix. We will get all the stoicism and forbearance imaginable. This Jane Eyre is a saint, one who endures all, overcomes all, and forgives all. She laughs only once when the young executor of her estate chases his wind-blown hat.<br /><br />She falls in love with the self-centered and distractingly irritable William Hurt as Mr. Rochester as the result, it seems, of a handshake, and the movie is at great pains to convey the fact of her lovesickness in every scene thereafter.<br /><br />Charlotte Gainsbourg, the adult Jane, is visually astonishing. She is at turns homely and forlorn, then radiant and winning. She always seems to be calling on some inner reserve of courage and strength, and as a result her acting is so restrained I wondered at times if she was still breathing.<br /><br />Despite all that, I enjoyed the movie, was moved by it, and, most important, I did come to care about gritty Jane and her flawed but ultimately gallant beloved. It is a testament to Bronte's genius that the movie holds together while opting to explore only one facet of fascinating Jane Eyre.
B00007GZR5|5.0|Magnificently lush and breathtakingly beautiful, this movie is my #1 absolute favorite movie of all time, because of the profound depth of the story. No mere love story in the conventional sense, it delves into the deepest of human despair, with a stunning performance by Annabella Sciorra, and just when you think you have shed more tears during this movie than all the other movies you've ever seen in your entire life put together, it reaches deep inside your psyche and pulls out the boldest, most heartwrenching understanding you've ever had about the POWER OF LOVE.<br /><br />To be willing to go to the depths of 'hell' itself for your love, is the profound concept illustrated in What Dreams May Come. In addition, the concepts of creating our own reality, soul mates, and the nature of 'heaven' and 'hell' are explored in exquisite depth.<br /><br />I can't say enough about the quality of this movie. No other movie (that I've ever seen anyway) has ever come close to its caliber. Oddly enough, this is one of those rare instances in which the movie was actually better than the book.<br /><br />SEE IT! Have a box of tissues handy. But you will feel enriched afterwards.
0810994739|5.0|I have a nine year old fourth grader who doesn't like to read.  This series by Jeff Kinney is just the ticket for him.  When we got this book he read the entire thing (224 pages) in less than 3 days!  And when he was reading it during study hall at school, several of his classmates asked to borrow it when he was done.
B00007LTIA|5.0|Long before the progressive rock band \\"Yes\\" began to deteriorate into a more pop/hits band with various original members coming and going, in other words, in Yes's most creative era, came perhaps their greatest overall work.  In the spirit of \\"Close to the Edge\\" and \\"Fragile\\" and \\"Relayer\\" and \\"Going for the One,\\" \\"Tales\\" is a double album made up of four main \\"pieces/songs,\\" each approximately 20 minutes long.  While Yes had previously tackled non-FM radio friendly, long and intricate, powerful musical ideas, \\"Tales\\" is without a doubt their most significant contribution to this whole genre of great, lengthy progressive art-rock attempts.  As would be Genesis's \\"Lamb Lies Down on Broadway,\\" Pink Floyd's \\"Dark Side of the Moon,\\" and The Who's \\"Quadrophenia,\\" but to name a few.<br /><br />This is really just about the only real progressive rock \\"symphony\\" ever created however, in the way it is presented.  There are four \\"movements\\" here, each complete in their own way, but when the four are put together, this work remains to this day, the closest any mere \\"rock\\" band ever came to matching the greatest purely classical music composers (and their own symphonies) in the history of music itself.  High praise, Yes!  And so well deserved.<br /><br />\\"Tales\\" is not for everyone, whether a casual or devoted \\"Yes\\" fan.  It takes musical ideas and lyrical compositions beyond anything the mostly original lineup had ever offered before or since.  Misunderstood and under-appreciated after its release and for many years afterwards, this is, when all is said and done, probably the band's greatest work.  Each of the four parts take many twists and turns, and hold within a life of their own, constantly switching from long lyrical adventures to strictly instrumental, to intricate vocal harmonies, and almost all of it is done in brilliant counterpoints and tempo changes, none of it ever predictable.  Utilizing early synth sounds and techniques, it is such a complex and historically important work that it may fly way over the heads of first time Yeslisteners, and may even eventually become tiresome to a lot of ex-Yes fans who have come to see it over time as overly pretentious and Yes at their most self-indulgent.  If there were any one effort of progressive rock in general (like Genesis's \\"Lamb\\" especially) which demands repeated listenings to fully appreciate its true genius however, this is it.<br /><br />Aside from the extra tracks in this version of Tales, the four, original parts of this four part Yes symphony remain the essence of it all, and they are:<br /><br />The Revealing Science Of God Dance Of The Dawn<br /><br />Starting rather slow but speeding up fast with obscure lyrics from the get-go, and a slowly building harmonic, music and effects background, which turns into all instrumental and then more voice and combinations of musical styles typically Yes, from past and future works.  There is no \\"rush\\" here to fit into any pre-conceived time frames, so both the music and voice parts take their sweet time, and while demanding patience upon first time listeners, there are riches yet to be had in this, only the first quarter of the work.  The music speeds up as do the lyrics, only to swell back into slow, rather minimal joys, of the type only Yes ever really did well among most progressive rock attempts.  The early synthesizer sounds and traditional instruments blend wonderfully, and Jon Anderson brings it all about in many beautiful new age parts interrupted by faster, but just as compelling and involving instrumental only sections.  A great start and introduction to what may just be Yes's greatest work ever.<br /><br />The Remembering High The Memory<br /><br />Continuing from alternating slower, more reflective parts to lead into more instrumental dominated diversions, while again taking its time to develop themes and ideas more deeply than previous and later efforts, echoes of Yes's best efforts won't disappoint fans, especially thoseof such classics as Fragile and Close to the Edge.  All of it must be taken in stride, but there are rewards musically throughout, and a lot of the latter parts will predict future Yes classics such as can be found in Relayer, and especially in the epic \\"Awaken\\" from the Going For The One album.<br /><br />The Ancient Giants Under The Sun<br /><br />Without a doubt the strangest quarter of Tales is this, with an emphasis on instrumental, there are new sound effects being constantly introduced, and while this part may demand the most patience to develop from the other parts to fully enjoy, like the other parts, it continually flows in a glorious whole.  And various themes here again refer back to earlier parts.  The classical guitar parts here shine especially.<br /><br />Ritual Nous Sommes Du Soleil<br /><br />Again, beginning with an emphasis on the instrumental, soon, vocals and lyrics slowly take charge, and lead later to incredible and faster combinations of so many sounds, all featuring great keyboards, effects, and plaintiff yearning and attempts to wrap it all up with Anderson's vocals.  Jon sings, \\"We Love When We Play...\\" and it becomes obvious that this whole work is just all about that.  An album made by Yes, basically for Yes, and anyone else who finds value in it all, much the better.<br /><br />Not for everyone, \\"Tales\\" will always remain Yes's finest contribution to the very idea of \\"progressive rock,\\" in all of its, at times, seemingly pretentious, but ultimately satisfyingly wonderous overall achievement.  This is surely a masterpiece which demands repeated listenings to fully appreciate its unique, simple and complex, musical beauty.  I can't recommend it enough, and it will always be on my short list of CD's to be stranded on a desert island with.

B000AMJG4Y|5.0|This movie is incredible , the plot actually fits in with FF7 and the fight scenes never dissapoint , not too much talking and not too much fighting, this movie can get boring after watching it a few times but its still well written and played out.
B00139B39E|3.0|As an avid Dream Theater fan who appreciates Dream Theater albums as complete works of art, rather than a collection of songs, I got what I expected from the Greatest Hit album and ranked it three stars accordingly.    Dream Theater's music is complex and their albums are very thematic. They are written like epics and can only be truly appreciated when listened to from beginning to end with little or no interruption (just think [[ASIN:B000021XS0 Metropolis Part 2: Scenes from a Memory]], [[ASIN:B00005UEAR Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence]] Disc II, or [[ASIN:B000002JKA Awake]]). Many songs which used to flow into each other have been abruptly truncated or awkwardly resolved so they could stand alone as singular pieces on this album and some of the most amazing feats of musicianship (Petrucci and Rudess at the end of Solitary Shell) have been tragically removed altogether.    As a collection of songs for someone who wants to listen to \\"cool music,\\" this album does the trick and may inspire one to purchase some of the albums the individual songs come from. But what is lost is analogous to listening to a \\"Broadway's Greatest Hits\\" compilation.. the songs are pretty, but you lose the story. Listening to and understanding Dream Theater is an experience which can only be understood by listening to their songs in the context of the entire album.    All in all, I agree with the majority of the reviews on this album.  For the DT fan, realize that you're not getting a work of art, but a collection of pieces.  For those interested in progressive rock, I recommend you start with [[ASIN:B000021XS0 Metropolis Part 2: Scenes from a Memory]] or [[ASIN:B000002JKA Awake]].  For the casual listener, this will be a nice and interesting album to have in your collection.

0855329483|5.0|I purchased both of Ann Cox's books on silk ribbon embroidery.  Beautiful books, they both offer clear instructions and beautiful photography.  I'm hooked!  I've used the silk ribbon embroidery for both making cards and as a way of embellishing crazy quilts.  This book is Ann's second book on silk ribbon embroidery.  Her first book was geared to beginners.  I would recommend purchasing both of the books at the same time as they follow each other nicely.  Periodically, I run across \\"must haves\\" for my craft library.  I'll refer frequently to both of her books and am very glad that I purchased them.  Highly recommended!
B00000G3AZ|5.0|This could be Jane Austen's best story yet.  Well acted and funny, this one is a refreshing change from the woe is me main character of other Austen stories.
B000YXMMAE|5.0|I don't write many album reviews (in fact, this is my first) but I wanted to throw my two cents in here.  I gotta say, I'm a little confused by the overall negative and/or ambivalent reaction to this album.  I'll admit this is definitely not as groundbreaking or inspired as, say, Ok Computer, but I don't think the greatness of a past release should be used as a template for judging everything else a band produces.  If you look at this as just a rock album, it really, really works.  I'll even go so far as to say I enjoy In Rainbows every bit as much as Ok Computer and The Bends.  (I'd say the same thing for Hail to the Thief as well.)   It's subtle and subdued but it still retains the same kind of complex, ambient, distant sound that you aren't quite sure how to label.  I'd say if you're a fan of good music and you're not expecting Ok Computer Part II, you can't go wrong with picking this up.
0553381407|5.0|My Christain counselor recommended this book.  My husband devoured it from the day it came in the mail.  I, the victim, had to sit it down at times so I could sleep.  It is very thorough and eye opening.  The Lord knew the suffering in my heart and gave me just what I needed.  My counseling continues and my enormous load gets lighter each day.  As far as gifts from God, I rank it second only to my salvation.  If you're the victim, take this life preserver and free yourself from the undeserving guilt you've been living with.  Get a Christain counselor and start this book.    5/2010  I've given this as gifts. After reading reviews of the book Hush by Nicole Braddock Bromley I realized I needed to look at this review and make is more usefully objective. Although it has been a while since I read this, I still remember it very well!    What I like  Dr Forward gives clear directions on how to be honest with yourself and the abuser(s) thereby freeing yourself to heal. The last chapter gives a step by step guide on how to confront your abuser(s) with details on where, who and the option of a letter if need be.  The truth shall set you free!    This book is not just filled with miserable stories that, while they can seem to alleviate the pain because you know you're not alone, they actually can add to the burden of pain if you read too many of them.    Dr Forward gives actual psychological explainations of why victims react the way they do. It's liberating to know my reactions made sense and were not signs of insanity.    What I don't like  Some of those miserable stories had such graphic details, I felt like I was there. Sadly, those details are sometimes needed to show the extent of the pervereness, but now I have one that sometimes plays over in my mind. NOT something I needed!    Comments that Dr Forward makes is obvious she is not Christain. While I can truly understand why people would lose their faith after such misery, I personally know how important my faith was inkeeping my sanity. I even told my adoptive father (my abuser), \\"It's a wonder I didn't end up a lesbian and athiest because of you!\\" A person's faith is too personal and she should have stayed neutral in that arena.    Dr Forward should have given a suggested time line on reading this book. Myself, I could manage about 1 chapter in a day then lay it down for a month. There is so much pain with childhood abuse and plowing through this book at break-neck speed could possibly hurt more than heal. Take little bites, and then \\"chew\\" slowly.

If you are a Power Point serious user, and recognize that you (and the people in the auditorium) are tired with the \\"standard\\" way you do your presentations, you must buy and read this beautiful book. You will read it in hours - it is marvelous. I strongly recommend this one.
B0010X73ZG|1.0|I found the movie off to a good start that quickly melted into stereotypical movies that Hollywood churns out in droves in the hopes we don't notice.     A black man is seen as a protagonist, and then goes out under the guise of \\"educated bravado\\" to be killed with his group that consists of many of the black extras seen in the movie. Why didn't any black people make it to the final minutes of the movie? Hmmm. I think I know.    Mrs. Cormody is a typical Hollywood canned intolerant Christian who curses a filthy streak and then claims to be a messenger of God. Sorry, seen this one too many times. The only reason anyone would say this performance is riveting would be because it aligned with they're prejudice. If 85% of Americans are Christians, why can't Hollywood get it right?    The military is portrayed as they have been in many recent movies, negatively. Oops, what a surprise! And then as cowards. Fortunately, by the end of the movie this was set to rights. Go, Troops!    The little guy, though he is brave and determined, still gets it in a way that shows through exaggeration that he is small. He deserved better.    The child actor was wonderful and was the true standout performance. His father attempt to protect him against overwhelming odds was what appealed to me to finish watching this formula to the end, and as it turned out, nothing new under the sun!    This was not intended as a family movie, got it! But I can't help feeling that I spent two hours with a curmudgeon who only complained about how bad the world was. Thank goodness this is not reality!    Oh, yes, there were suspenseful moments, but generally, it was overshadowed by stereotypes and indoctrination.
B00006LI4S|5.0|I love it, specially \\"Dimming Of The Day\\" - besides that most the program is Pink Floyd unplugged. Only the windscreen on David´s Vocalmike is awfull.

B000A6T262|4.0|The DVD movies were of excellent quality, both sound and picture. Since I had already seen all the movies, that was not an issue. Mostly I wanted them for ease of viewing and good sound and picture quality. I got what I wanted and what I expected.
B000WQWPKA|4.0|If you are looking for the extended cut, you won't find it here. This is the original theatrical version (that is why I left off 1 star). If you are reading these reviews to decide if you want to buy this movie, my best advice is that if you like movies like the old 70's disaster movies, like Earthquake, or Towering Inferno you will probably like this flick. Jeff Goldblum and Will Smith carry the movie, along with the special effects. If you are looking for a sci-fi movie that entertains on a popcorn level you really can't do much better than this one.
B000P12LWY|5.0|The Tudors is a great series and very well acted.Historic series either are a flop or they are great.This one is fantastic.I found Mr.Meyer too good looking for the part of Henry the VIII, but I do not mind.He is worth looking at.Considering that the series are based on history some of the characters resemble to true people that lived in that time. Sir Thomas Moore,the actor that plays the part resembles the real one very much.  If you watch these series you are then interested in costumes,history,and the characters.Check the really women of Henry the VIII.Check Henry the VIII himself.He is not as gorgeous as Mr.Meyer is.He was fat,had leg ulcers that never healed.Had diabetes.  Anne Bolyne was very pretty if you look at some of the pictures.However one wood have never guessed that she had 6 fingers and very ugly moles.It is fascinating to read about Henry and his wives while the series are on.  Whoever created these costumes I admire her or him.They must have loved this assignment.So reach and so elegant elegant.The accessories so well selected.  The settings just lovely.  I strongly recommend you to keep this series in your DVD collection.
B000001GBJ|4.0|Wonderful CD with lots of relaxation. I love the instrumental combinations. It's great to listen to while doing other things, and I actually enjoy  listening to it while going through my Yoga poses at the end of the day.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|I wasn't a great fan of the last two seasons of Stargate SG-1, but I thought this movie wrapped up the whole Ori arc very well.  I don't think I will ever get tired of the SG team stories, this story ends one storyline but sets up the viewer for a new adventure.  I hope there are many more!
B000F0UUT6|5.0|I find the British cast and version of this to be excellent.....better than the U.S. version/cast.
B000R7I3LY|3.0|a lot of her songs sound just like her \\"one hit\\" everyone has heard of. Sarah B has a sweet \\"little voice\\" and this is good, relaxing music to put on after a long day at work. Not a lot of variety in terms of tempo or type of music she does, but, it's not really necessary.
B000M5AJQI|5.0|Martin Scorcese is definitly a brilliant director, there is just no question, but many were angry that this was the movie for which he was finally recognized at the Academy Awards. I enjoyed this movie immensely, watching it over and over.    The thing about this movie that is so genuis to me is there are two characters living very different lives coming to the same result.    Leonardo Dicaprio and Matt Damon enter state police training. Matt Damon passes with flying colors and is immediately made into a sergeant. His secret, he is friends with Jack Nicholson,(Costello) a very evil mastermind that generates just about all of the cities crime. He is based on a true character of that time with a few small changes. Scorcese even recruited the police chief that worked on the case for a small part in honoring the new state police which I found to be very noble. Leonardo DiCaprio doesnt quite make it through the state police due to his background they don't quite trust him with the responsiblity. As he fails that, and is told he could be an astronaut not a statey, he is recruited to be undercover in Costellos crew to finally catch him and his gang once and for all. Costello ends up liking him, while questioning his motives.     Excellent movie, lots of decisions to be made which leads us to a very complex conclusion. Superb acting from many of our leading men including Matt Damon, Leonardo DiCaprio, Jack Nicholson, Martin Sheen and Mark Wahlberg. Definitly worth your time, and worth owning.
B000VR824S|5.0|After seeing this on PBS I decided it would be an ideal gift for my brother, a huge Eric Clapton fan.  I sent it off to him and he tells me that it is absolutely the best he has seen and heard, especially when his all-time favorite, Albert Lee, was featured.  So, a big thank you to all involved with putting this great show together, can't wait to see what's next!
B0013FXWU6|5.0|Many infamous moments in this movie make it great. I am sorry but I cant really get on board with the people who say poor acting in this film because Daniel Day Lewis was at his best and has the Oscar to prove it.    The reason I liked it so much is because you were in such awe and fear of this man at the same time. A similar performance to Gangs of New York, he nailed the man we refer to as Plainview.     We start at the beginning with about 15 to 20 minutes of silence. He has struck oil. We fast forward to when the boy has grown to about 8 or 9 and he is helping his father make deals for oil as they are already extremely wealthy. After the meeting of the townfolk to see if they will agree to do business with him as he does all of his own drilling, a man approaches Plainview stating that there is money to be made in his hometown, the oil is right at the surface. Paul Dano is excellent as both characters. You may remember him from The Girl Next Door. With that, Plainview sets out to this town which will make him a much more fortunate man. There are many trials and tribulations to which our very complex characters experience.     To the end we will put closure on the many different occurences from many different angles. And yes...the overused term, \\"I drink your milkshake, I drink it up!!!\\" was there too. :)    To put fear, greed and religion in the same atmosphere and see how they coexist with one another is truly a treat to be enjoyed in this excellent blockbuster!
B000WTNCYA|4.0|just saw \\"Sweeney Todd\\" and the character Johanna (who was the daughter of Sweeney Todd / Johnny Depp) reminded me of Melody Gardot.  Both were temporarily confined to their bedroom, (especially Melody after her debilitating accident)...Johanna says...\\"if I cannot fly, let me sing\\".  Johanna's love interest also asks her \\"do they think walls can hide you?\\"  No, Melody, walls cannot hid you or your \\"melodic\\" voice...       Yes, there is a similarity to Norah Jones, but much more here...it's impressive that she wrote all of these songs, but I would love to hear her sing some of the classic standards sung by Diana krall or even Shirley Horn...
B0010X73ZG|4.0|If you loved Alien or Aliens, you will love this movie.  Some characters were a bit over the top, but the movie had it all - a little comedy (some really quirky characters, such as the Bible lady), a little sadness (some of the major characters end up dying), and a lot of edge-of-your-seat drama (very thrilling scenes of humans vs. alien creatures).      The ending was shattering, but very realistic.  All in all, I would have given it a 5 if it had toned down the swearing.  One of the best movies I have seen period.
0452289963|5.0|It certainly is an eye opener.  I believe you will learn a great deal about yourself and it will challenge you to make each moment of your life count.  You will be less materialistic and more careful in how you express yourself with friends and in relationships.  I recommend that you read it.  It will take some time and you will have to think about it as you read.  It is not a book that you can read through quickly.
B0012K1ILW|5.0|I've always liked her music, but she's pushing it so far now that you'd be crazy to not recognize the genious.  Outstanding music - like nothing else you can find - is the background for intelligent, personal poetry about our current culture.  Even if you don't agree with the politics (or the spacy interludes), you have to respect the concept and the talent that delivers it.  One of the best talents in music today!
B00003JRCQ|5.0|This movie starts off slow but is an excellent adaptation of Jane Austen's written work.  I love the fact that not every actor is drop dead gorgeous...and the prelude to the kiss was fantastic!  Anyone with a love of Jane Austen will love this movie!

0452287588|1.0|My book club chose this book because of the positive press it was receiving. There were eight members at our meeting to discuss the book - three had finished it, three had gotten part way through and given up, and two had read the first one or two chapters and weren't interested.  I did get all the way through the book, and did not like it at all. I did not feel as though Mr. Tolle presented any new information, it has all been said differently before. His writing needed to be more succinct. While living in the NOW and overcoming past hurts is desirable, he made spirituality seem very complicated and difficult to obtain. I feel my time could have been better spent doing something other than reading A New Earth.
076781326X|5.0|I would imagine most people know about the movie and  what good entertainment it could be. The quality of this reproduction was terrible. I'm returning my copy. See the two star reviews for less about \\"chat\\" about the movie's content and for reviews about the terrible quality of the DVD. Wait till a better quality reproduction is available.
B000U7169W|5.0|I decided to write a short review in here, simply because this movie seems to have gotten mixed, if not very poor reviews. I personally was fascinated with this movie! I thought this was actually one of the best \\"Satanic Cult\\" movies I've seen with one of the better twists I've seen at the end of a movie. I think AnnaSophia Robb plays her role great!Even without very many lines, her character is VERY intense and well-acted. I think you have to watch it 2 or 3 times to pick up on the subtle parts of the prophecy which add to this very interesting and original plotline. Anyway, I just wanted to put my two cents in because I THOROUGHLY enjoyed this movie. I'm thinking that some of the best parts of this movie may have gone unnoticed by some of these harsh critics.
B00005JLCI|5.0|I have been waiting for this version of Hamlet to be presented on DVD for many years. It is worth the wait. An extraordinary cast, wonderfully vivid photography and Shakespeare. Who could ask for more?
B000FDFVZ6|5.0|This book has a very original premise - the story being told by the child who had been murdered.  It's very touching to see her watch as her family falls apart after her death, and to observe the progression as years pass.  Not for everyone, but I couldn't put it down.
1433210428|4.0|This is a must read for all those \\"woe is me\\" people always complaining about everything.  Man's Search for Meaning will enlighten you to what \\"having a bad day\\" really means.  I applaud Viktor Frankl for his inner strength to survive such an ordeal and come away with such dignity and inner peace.
B00000J9HE|5.0|The recordings of Jean Sibelius' symphonies Four through Seven made by Herbert von Karajan and the Berlin Philharmonic are the best that Karajan conducted and are considered in the top five records made by Karajan and the Berliners (most recently by NPR).  I had the Sibelius Seventh on LP and always regarded the performance as my favorite, so I was very pleased when I found it had been transferred to CD.      I do not think that I have heard a more moving or powerful performance of the Fourth Symphony with its somber slow movement (perhaps reflecting what Sibelius thought was a fatal illness) with a more joyous finale. The Fifth Symphony is beautifully paced with the soaring theme of the swans in the last movement truly reaching for the sky and the triumphant ending certainly one that inspires awe.  The Sixth Symphony is probably the least known of Siberlius' symphonies and receives an insightful and glorious performance. The recording of the Seventh, for me, has been the most moving and engaging that I have heard and the final bars never fail to bring tears to my eyes.  I have performances of the Seventh by Beecham, Ashkenazy and Colin Davis but the energy of this performance and the sound of the Berlin Philharmonic has a depth that I have not heard surpassed.     The set also includes a stunning performance of Tapiola and an atmospheric Swan of Tuonela.  This DG set (recorded in the mid 1960s) may not have the sonic range that recent digital records benefit from but the performances, arguably, have a place among the best. Certainly for me they have had a permanent place with my other CDs of Sibelius' music.
B0006Z2LH4|4.0|i just love these movies, i must admit i did love the bright fresh new idea when the first one came out, I hope there will be others, what I liked about it is that there is now answer really, but there are clues through the movie, I recommennd this movie if your into something strange ;) have fun
B000PFU7OO|5.0|If you liked the quirky little movie, you will, of course, like the soundtrack.  I think Glen Hansard's voice is haunting and lovely, but then again I love the honesty and forthright nature of Irish singing and folk songs.  My favorite track is 'If You Want Me.'  Some of you may remember Glen Hansard as the gawky red-headed kid in the film The Commitments.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|Loved the show. Loved the movie. The extras where great. I enjoy movies better with the extras.
B0014Z4OQG|1.0|I have to say that this absolutely the worst movie of 2008. Paramount should have learned its lesson from Sony Pictures Entertainment Corporation during their debacle of their Godzilla (1998) movie adaption. Their viral campaign showed very little of the monster until the day of the movie and it ended up bombing, not making much more than Cloverfield did.    To make things worse, Matt Reeves took what could have a wonderful creature movie and turned it into a rollercoaster ride of nauseated dizzyness. Now, there's talk of a sequel filmed with a different point of view? Matt Reeves is making a mockery of the Movie Industry in Hollywood.    Even the filming style was completely un-original ...    If you want to see a real monster movie, stick with the originals ... Godzilla, Gamera, King Kong. At least with these movies, you won't become nauseated by the constant shaking of the camera.
0823003590|3.0|This is a beautiful book to look at but I found the title deceptive. No where in the book have I found drawing instruction for the head. The author/artist basically just does his own thing, but doesn't offer any direction for someone wanting instruction on the drawing of the head! I will keep it and possibly scan it again when I am more advanced.

B000N6TYLW|3.0|I was disappointed with the final 3 episodes and especially the final ever epsiode, it was so undramatic and cheesy and left you lingering with a few unanswered questions that will now never be answered. I can't really pin point particular things that I didn't like, it just wasn't what I was hoping for or expecting.
073934272X|3.0|Much less engaging than World War Z.  This is modeled on military manuals and is just a series of listings of techniques, equipment, etc, with sometimes quite creative and humorous commentary.  However, it is tough to make an audio-taped manual consistently interesting listening on long drives.  What made WW-Z compelling was the sequence of vignettes , each a short story in its own right, woven into an overall history of the war.  It had momentum that carried you along--That is lacking here.  Still, there are some fun parts to this
B000A6CLL0|5.0|Finally the series has become more adult.  The Captain has grown up and all the other characters have gained more depth.  I am surprised to find that they only made one more series.  It is a bit like Buffy and Angel - they became more focused on inner conflict and their characters became more realistic or the writers matured and decided to write for a grown up audience.  I was so impressed with this series I bought the 4th and final series.      Michele Gladden

B000002LMK|5.0|Yes it's all electric distorted guitar, with Neil soloing all over the place, no acoustic... It's the HARD rockin Neil and Crazy Horse, and it's beautiful. If you're a fan, or even just a casual fan, of the hard rockin side of Niel YOU WILL love this. If not then buy it anyway because it will grow on you. When I first played this back in the 90s I was a little put off by the kind of country rock sound of the first two songs. But after about three spins, I was (and still am) in love with this disc. A great disc to play when your in a bad mood or feeling down because it pumps you right up. If your system can play loud it sounds especialy great. If you can crank it on a P.A. system in a backyard you will be in heaven. If you're a sensitive type, the last song, Mother Earth (Natural Anthem) which was done live and in the studio, might bring a tear to your eye when you think about these days we live in. Hope this helps!
B0013UIUBC|3.0|Unlike some romantic comedies, this movie has some depth to it.  The female lead is flawed, and remains so throughout the film, but that doesn't prevent her character from growing enough to move the plot forward.  Her neice, likewise, undergoes reactions to her mother's death and her new circumstances that are more realistic than some other films that use a newly-orpaned kid as a prop.  Eckhart's character might be a little too long-suffering to believe, but he has an understated charm that is infectious - I tried hard not to like him.  This type of movie might not be my preference, but I enjoyed it.
B00132D808|1.0|After their first effort that was so original and interesting with every track, I didn't think it was possible that they could screw up so monumentally, but they found a way.  This is the exact opposite of A Fever You Can't Sweat Out.  No originality, no unique twists on the alternative genre we see today, and aside from 9 in the Afternoon, not one decent track on the whole CD!  I don't know what they were going for, but they had better pull that first attempt out of the trash and revisit those tunes, because this new attempt at a sophomore release misses the mark completely.  I don't write reviews very often, but this one actually is so bad it moved me to do so.  Go back and listen to \\"A Fever...\\" again and forget buying this cd.  Or better yet, wait another month and get the new cd from Jack's Mannequin.
B0009MAO46|5.0|Toy Story is one of those movies that you must own to keep in your classic collection.  I have the VHS movie and felt that I need to get a little more modern and buy the DVD!!  Toy Story is a movie that appeals to any age.  There are jokes that only adults would understand and the animation appeals to younger audiences.  Buzz is every toddler's hero.

1594489505|5.0|...before I got to Chapeter 6. I literally could not put this book down, and had finished it in only 4 or 5 days. I was moved with the way Hosseini, a man, could express so accurately and poetically the emotions that women go through. I am a poet, and I don't feel that I've ever described my only feelings the way the Khaled has.    He captured each character fantastically, and did not make anyone an ultimately good character (or dickens-esque as I call it), but showed that the everyday protagonist is flawed, just like Miriam, Laila, and Tariq. I loved this book and recommended it to everyone I knew.    Also, I am very, very satisfied at the way Hosseini put to bed the stereotypes Americans have about people living in Afghanistan. I am neither of the Islamic faith, nor from Afghanistan, but I believe that people everywhere, no matter how they are portrayed in the media, have the same experiences: going to school, dealing with a villain, finding sanctuary in a trusted friend, going through life's disappointments, seeking and maybe finding true love... Americans have been portraying people from the Mid-East as a whole, including Afghanistan, as being a backwards people who do everything wrong that they can in the name of Allah. I put my own stereotypes to rest years ago as a teenager when I read the autobiography of a woman name \\"Khadijah\\" who escaped from Iraq. Thank you so much, Khaled, for teaching the rest of us that HUMAN BEINGS live in Afghanistan, not the bomb loving people they portray on TV.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|I was really surprised at how inexpensive this was and what fantastic quality. This is one video my teens have watched every single day for the past month.
B00104QSOM|5.0|Of all the films released this millennium thus far, \\"There Will Be Blood\\" is the most deserving to be immortalised. As epic as life itself, this film can be quite comparable to the story of the enduring \\"Citizen Kane\\". This film, simply put, is the rise of a self-made \\"oilman\\" and his decent into madness while it is supported by the lives and people he destroys along the way.<br /><br />This is not a happy film. The character of Daniel Plainview (played by Daniel Day-Lewis) is not a character much visited in film or even in real life, but it is not difficult to imagine someone so calculating and anti-social, and Day-Lewis' extraordinary portrayal of Plainview should not be taken as either exaggerated or over-acted, which is perhaps the most horrifying facet of the film. It is Day-Lewis' acting that takes the spotlight for this film's magic, I will admit that. It should not be missed. Some people will regard this as farcical acting and therefore unnecessary, but then some people are idiots. Some just do not see the big picture and see this as a character study. I didn't say one has to like it, just that one should not consider it superfluous.<br /><br />Day-Lewis' acting is a major highlight, but it is the director's talent that overall makes this a true work of art. Though it has a more Kubrick-esque approach, the director, P. T. Anderson, has made a spectacle that blends experimental methods, with classic techniques, and his own style; the result: a very, very well made film that can reach a wide audience. It can please the entertainment seekers, the film-as-an-art lovers, and the critics. Its scope is on par with \\"Gone with the Wind\\", \\"Titanic\\", \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\", and \\"Ben-Hur\\", but on a far more psychological and intimate level. It delves deep into the psyche of a cynical monster until he snaps and then the curtains close and the show is over. And it is the end that captivates me so. It is overly-fascinating. It draws fissions up the spine and they stay there. If only every film could have such a destructively wonderful conclusion.<br /><br />Yes, perhaps it was \\"No Country For Old Men\\" that won the Oscar for Best Picture, but I would love to see \\"No Country For Old Men\\" stand the test of time to be an eternal masterpiece by itself instead of just part of the Coen Brother's portfolio. If you want to see a movie, go see \\"No Country For Old Men\\", if you want to see a film, go see \\"There Will Be Blood\\". But, I'll stop bitching about something so irrelevant to this film's actual importance. So, all in all, \\"There Will Be Blood\\" will be a prevailing masterpiece in the history of film and should not be underestimated or disregarded, even if only for Day-Lewis' performance.film could have such a destructively wonderful conclusion.

B0010YSD7M|3.0|This movie is good if you're a Stargate Fan.  Since we don't have the opportunity to see it on TV anymore - it will seem really good to fans.  Not too much substance to the movie - mainly just going thru the motions - but it was good to see all the characters again.
0143143492|5.0|I had so many discoveries about myself and how I relate to everything and everyone on this planet, while reading this book. The book was an eye opener to many things we took for granted or just didn't understand why we do what we do. I talk about men all the time and their ego and forgot how egotistic I can be as a women. What resonates with me most was when I read chapter 5, it speaks about the pain body and how we search constantly to find other pain bodies to feed our own. I see it in myself, on the news, in the supermarket, at the malls, everywhere. All the pain bodies unconsciously looking for more pain.    It is an exciting read and it takes you to another level of what Eckhart Tolle calls consciousness.
6304712944|5.0|This is a fantastic movie, if I could hear it.  This is the second time I have purchased this DVD, and the second time that the sound doesn't work.  Only the background music plays.  Voices cannot be heard.  I purchased this first a couple of years ago, so I can only assume there is a manufacturer defect on this DVD.

B000AV2G3I|3.0|Let's be honest- you can't make a definitive collection for a guy like John Lennon.  Not when there's over 90% of his discography that's worth hearing and owning.  The only possible way a collection like this can be complete is when 90% of his legacy has been included.  Anything less than that is really not worth owning.  You mine as well just buy his regular studio albums when so many of his best songs have been left off his collections.  With that said, what we have here is really good despite not being an essential purchase.  You will recognize many of the songs, because they've become important pieces of music over the years, but let's just buy Lennon's studio albums instead.
B000FIMG68|5.0|Lost season 2 picks right up where the first season left off.  You meet new and interesting characters as well as more mysteries.  I'm working my way through the 3rd season now, but the second season is when the action and plot pick up and thicken!  I highly recommend this season for any fan!
B000EQ47GS|2.0|Boston were never really one of my favorites.  I think because *every single song* from the debut has been played millions of times on the classic rock radio format.  Over the years, when it's just the same eight songs *over and over*, we're bound to get tired of those songs.  It's only natural.  That's why variety is important.    However, if you're one of the lucky people out there who HASN'T heard these songs every single time you turn on the radio, you might be able to find something to like here.  Every song basically has that samey guitar sound that must have been made in the studio with the intention to turn the volume WAY up high, and the commercialized approach in full swing.  This album was meant to be huge, and that's why people remember it.      Still, I can't imagine coming into this album for the first time today and enjoying a song like \\"Long Time\\" which is a pretty boring song if you ask me.  It's overlong, and the mid-tempo style does nothing for me.  Only \\"More Than a Feeling\\" manages to bring a smile to my face after all these years.      Not a recommended purchase.  A band that was a lot better than Boston IMO was Cheap Trick.  Check out that band instead.
B00005JPNY|2.0|I had heard a lot about this film being anti-Christian, blah blah blah. So, I wasn't expecting this movie to be just plain BAD. I wasn't offended at all by any anti-Christian message, but I was just offended by how horribly bad the movie was. BLEH. It gets 2 stars for decent CGI.
B0000257BI|5.0|Southern Accents is probably Tom Petty's most underrated album.  What amazes me especially is how a song like \\"Don't Come Around Here No More\\" sounds totally different from anything else Petty has ever made, not to mention VERY freaky and haunting.  On the flip side however, a song like \\"Rebels\\" is a lost gem.  \\"Spike\\" is a very catchy song as well.  An album that combines Petty's most memorable songwriting with his most underrated effort as far as radio exposure goes.
B0013BNY2Q|3.0|REM finally throws a bone to the fans who prefer the Bill Berry days.  A 35 minute bone that shows the sheer lack of interest these guys have at making this type of record.  Did the big boys at Warner Bros threaten to drop them if they didn't stop crafting post-post-modern 21st Century pop 'masterpieces' and would just make something more 'REM-like'?  I'm no insider.  I have no idea, but if so, REM must have responded... ok... here you go, squatted for a few minutes and pooped out some REM songs just like old times.      Again, I have no ties to the inside of Michael Stipes eyelids, but I would not be surprised if the lyrics to this album is stuff Michael Stipe had in his old journals sitting around for forever that he dusted off for this fun exercise in nostalgia.  The whole album sounds kinda like digested stuff they've done a couple of times before, doesn't it?  Even the song 'Sing for the Submarine' contains lyrical nods to past REM songs.  It's the End of the World as We Know It and I'm Going to DJ?  Notice a retreaded theme there?  At the end of the album no less.    Here's a breakdown of the album tracks and the album/period they most sound like:    Living Well... - Life's Rich Pageant  Man-Sized Wreath - Green  Supernatural Superserious - Automatic for the People  Hollow Man - Up meets Reckoning  Houston - New Adventures in Hi-Fi  Accelerate - Monster  Until the Day Is Done - Out of Time  Mr. Richards - Monster meets Reveal  Sing for the Submarine - Murmur meets Around the Sun  Horse to Water - Fables  I'm Gonna DJ - Green    I admit there are a few nice musical moments on this disc. 'Accelerate' hints at something much more powerful that REM could be focused on. The album as a whole is not by any means terrible.  This short disc (e.p.?) sounds passably like REM is 'supposed' to sound and no, not in the 'Imitation of Life' way either (REM paroding itself).  Here they're really trying to be REM again.    Sidebar:  If you get the deluxe version, you get to seethe film '6 Days' which, I'm sorry to say, but honestly it's pretentious garbage.  Just as the CD does not contain an album's worth of material, the DVD, despite its title, does not seem to contain excerpts from 6 days worth of video.      What it does have is REM's 'I hate America' stance.  Peter Buck reveals that if he didn't have family and friends in the U.S. he would move, being so disgusted with the politics of it all.  At least he has a choice, being uh.. a rich rock star fed by the Capitalist system he loathes so.  Gag.    There is some almost interesting stuff from their Dublin 'non-shows' and we are supposed to think it is cool to see a creative process where they are getting feedback, trying out the new songs.  But I don't think REM invented this way of doing things.  A lot of other artists actually play new songs live to audiences and change them up along the way before recording them in a studio for an album.  It's like REM baked bread, took a knife to it, cut it into thin sections, and said- 'look what I just invented!  sliced bread!'  Yeah.. no.      Oh, and watching Michael Stipe drive around... someplace.. Dublin?  is exceedingly boring.  And he needs to stop smoking.  And I really really like experimental cinema.  This 6 Days thing was just.. nothing really.  It didn't have one thing going for it.. actually, I fell asleep about 3/4 the way through it.  It was uncompelling and seemed lost between overly artsy, self-consciously artistic, minimalistically creative, painfully politically protesty, or all of these things rolled together and moving at a snail's pace then, when it did do anything tangible, with the attention deficit disorder factor on 5 (for those unfamiliar, that's one of the highest settings).  A full version of a live song would have been nice, but no... we have to cut from the music so we can here William Burroughs or someone talking about how America sucks or whatever.  Boring boring boring.  I'm not a flag-waver, but come on... REM's past political statements all have been very powerful due to their symbolic, truly beautiful or intense and artistic nature (Cuyahoga... Exhuming McCarthy).  In 'Six Days' they're just griping and trying to pretend that they hate America.  Uh... is that because you're being paid in U.S. dollars and not Euros, Peter?      But back to the music... if you have just the CD, good for you, you saved some money (though you missed out on  two halfway decent B-sides that were thrown in on the DVD).  But, basically, the album should have three or for more solid songs to be ... no, not a great album.. no, not a good album... but how about an album at all.  My suggestion is for them to rent a cheap studio put a few more songs together and offer them up for download.      Then, cull the best of the Dublin shows and offer that as a live DVD release.  Yeah... wow.

0143038583|5.0|The subject of the book is an analysis on what we eat and, to a certain extent, why. But what distinguishes this book from many others on the subject is the live-in experience that the reader has accompanying the author through his hand-on experiences. The other excellent part of the author's approach is the scientific information that accompanies this travel (history, laws, nutrition, interviews with industry people, agricultures (organic and not), veterinarians, etc.) allowing the reader to arrive to his own conclusions, which makes it very powerful (nothing is given as dogma). I have kept wondering how long did it take to the author to write it, this is not library feat. The result of this novel approach is, besides the knowledge of the eating process in our modern society, a permanent new way to consider not only the content of what we eat, but also the way we shop for food and why. If before we weren't aware of it, after reading this book we will not be able to forget that, whether we want to acknowledge it or not, our daily eating routine is part of a political act.
6305014140|5.0|I viewed this back during my college days in the mid-90's and let me say that this is one of the crowning achievements in japanamation!    The story centers on a masterless samari named Jubei who is (more or less) forced into service by Dakuwon, an agent of the Tokengowa goverment of Japan. Along the way, they battle the 8 Devils of Kimone, led by Jubei's old enemy Himiro Gemma and gain an ally in Kegero. A ninja woman who is blessed with an immunity to poisons but cursed because she can't enjoy any physical intimacy with anyone without killing them. Together, the three must prevent the 8 Devils and their masters, The Shogun Of The Dark from overtaking the government of Japan via a civil war.    Great action, great animation and a lot of plot twists along the way to the firey conclusion at the end. Great viewing but IT IS FOR ADULTS! In other words parents, DO NOT BUY THIS FOR YOUR KIDS!

0312379293|4.0|Jeffrey Archer has had a remarkable run --- one that has taken him to the top of bestseller lists for fiction and nonfiction works, to both houses of British Parliament and to British prisons. When Archer is said to be known as \\"The World's Master Storyteller,\\" one cannot determine if it is indeed meant as a compliment without knowing the predispositions toward Archer of the person making the statement. However, there is no question after reading A PRISONER OF BIRTH, Archer's latest work, that such a title should be applied in the positive.    A PRISONER OF BIRTH is a literary novel in the classic sense; it is impossible to read the book without thinking of Charles Dickens's A TALE OF TWO CITIES or any number of works by O. Henry. Yet this is a contemporary tale, from beginning to end, set very much in the \\"now.\\" It begins with a London couple, Danny Cartwright and Beth Wilson, celebrating their engagement with Bernie Wilson, Danny's best friend and Beth's brother. Before the night is over, Bernie will be dead, Danny will be framed for his murder, and Beth will have lost the two men she has loved most --- one to the void, and the other to a misapplied justice. Danny is sent to prison thanks to the machinations of a quartet of friends --- a barrister, an aristocrat, a popular actor and a successful real estate agent --- who, directly and indirectly, are responsible for Bernie's death.    The ironic sense of humor of a prison guard results in Danny sharing a cell with Nicholas Moncrieff, an inmate whose jailing is as unlikely as Danny's. It is Nicholas who, both directly and indirectly, provides Danny with the means by which he is able to gain his freedom from incarceration and begin a studied and relentless revenge against the men who have sullied his name and ruined his life. How he is able to pull this off provides the meat for this complex and intricate tale, supported by a cast of unforgettable characters who come together in a spellbinding narrative, bookended by nerve-wracking courtroom dramas wherein freedom and an endless love hang in the balance.    There are certain elements of A PRISONER OF BIRTH that require some suspension of disbelief: the close resemblance between Danny and Nicholas, upon which so much hinges, seems just a bit contrived, and Danny is almost too quick a study under Nicholas's tutoring to reasonably be believed. Such complaints, though, pale in comparison to the body of this story, which will leave readers alternately stunned and cheering --- and furiously turning pages until they reach the shocking conclusion.        --- Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub
B00102F5WK|3.0|The Rendition message...? To be different in America could be costly, especially since certain people have gone power mad and have taken it upon themselves to rend lives in a quest which has derailed egalitarianism. The movie did the job of dramatizing what we all know is actually happening, a campaign to enable Americans to enjoy pristine lives. A high caliber cast of actors served to entice me to watch this DVD.    When we bred flesh eating monsters in our own backyard what can we expect? This is so unreal.   We must realize that no matter how strenuous the home-cleaning, the effectiveness will be nullified when the next door neighbour nourishes a house full of rats and roaches.  The process of fumigation will cause some innocent ones to suffer collateral damage during the campaign exercise.   This is real!    Who is to blame? How can we safely get the chaff out without destroying the wheat? When will it stop?  Enough already! Everyone must stop the eye gorging before the entire world goes blind.  I give it a three star for depressing as it brought to my frontal lobe the dark reality of destruction in this world.

I you like to play games like MLB 2008 The show you know that vibration is a must for getting into the game exitement...This could seem unusable for many but for those who likes the rumble, like dual shock 2, this controller it's a definite tool to have..get it,,it's worth the $55.00..
B000EQ5SR0|4.0|Should you be someone who likes female action heros who are real pleasing to the eye, this movie will be a treat for you.  The costumes worn by the actors to depict the era of the movie is most interesting.  This movie is entertaining and the plot is not bad at all.  I do not regret purchasing this DVD.  I have watched it quite a few times. Anyone who likes the movie Equilibrium may find Aeon Flux worth watching.
0307383415|5.0|What a wonderfully sensitive, introspective book.    Of course some Republicans will use this as ammuntion to say he is Un American and/or a drug user.    It reads like a novel. Obama is definitely a talented writer who knows himself very well.
B0011ZNAIC|3.0|Where does this movie fall - for small children the plot and suggestiveness is a little too much for them to comprehend.  For older children and adults it does not cut it.  Maybe I expected too much but it is not sweet enough to be a \\"little mermaid\\" or \\"Ants\\" movie.  Neither is it funny enough to be likened to a Tom and Jerry. it is a little commercial effort that fell short.  Still if you have children let them enjoy it.  The suggestiveness will pass over the head of the smaller ones and will cause the older ones to smirk.
B0010YSD7M|4.0|Rounded the story off nicely that was kind of left hanging at the end of the final Stargate SG1 series.
0452289963|5.0|This book was a so enlightening and truly changed the way I view myself and the world. Really a read that everyone can relate to no matter what their religious belief and really provides an answer to your life's purpose and an understanding of the ways humanity is evolving and needs to evolve. This book has brought be closer to God and more in touch with my true sense of being. If you're looking for peace and purpose in your life...I highly recommend this book!

B00000IOSU|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums to listen to. Many beautiful songs with the poetic lyrics we have come to expect from MchLachlin. Another CD to check out is Afterglow. Not as well-known or as many hits off of it but a terrific listen.  Sarah has one of the most beautiful, soulful voices of today.
B000KZ3BWE|1.0|This is the worst movie that you can ever see. Everything Al Gore says in this Scientists have proven to be wrong. Gore is also being sued by the creator of the weather channel for Gore's attempts to create a carbon credit business. Carbon credits were personally designed by this guy as the perfect money making scheme. He could have made millions for selling the privilege for factories to function. All of the charts that he shows are wrong. The major fact that this Global Warming is a political weapon is that according to actual Scientists and not college dropouts have shown that the world is going to get colder, not warmer! The actual scientists have shown that the increase in temperature was caused by the SUN!!! The Sun was going through an up cycle over the last few years, and now its decreasing its output. But now the politicals are saying that now global warming/cooling is now global climate change. Which basically means that every time the temperature goes in either direction its caused by the negligible increase in carbon dioxide. This is just the ultimate political weapon. Far better than the bird flu that everyone was supposed   to die from a few years ago.     SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!!

B000WMFZMY|5.0|I had seen El Cid over twenty years ago and had been waiting for its DVD release for many years. This is a true classic and will endure through the ages. It is a highly entertaining film with great action, romance, and adventure. It was a time of true nobility - when honour and respect meant everything to a person, even if it meant sacrificing one's true love. The quality of the DVD is excellent. The superb, moving performances of both Charlton Heston and Sophia Loren will leave a lasting impression on you. You will not regret including this great movie in your DVD collection.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|Enjoyed this a lot!!  Can't wait for the next one to come out. To bad they cancelled the series. Hope they continue to make the movies.
B000Y7U98C|2.0|Sunshine is an attempt at an intense psychological based science fiction movie about a mission to save the sun, and by extension all life in the solar system.  The casting is good, and the movie is intense up to the last 25 minutes or so at which point it becomes just another sci-fi action movie.    If you're into intense psychological drama, it falls short of its promises. The opening plot about a mission gone wrong is compounded by a ghost ship seems like the making of a psychological thriller. Unfortunately in order to continue the escalation the director relies on a trite plot twist, at which point the movie de-escalates from epic to standard Hollywood fair.  Although, a benefit of the shift in pacing has the advantage of not having to risk dragging on like George Clooney's remake of Solaris.    Ultimately Sunshine fails to dazzle. It's still got all elements of a good sci-fi flick but the physics of it play a bit off. With the abrupt pacing change failing to jumpstart a semi-present chemistry the film feels more like a sizzle.
0517147688|5.0|This book can't be beat for price (you'll pay more for the individual paperbacks) and the binding looks like a much more expensive edition.
B0015KO52S|5.0|I'm not going to write a long review, or a history of the band like some of the other reviewers. All I can say, will say, is that this is probably the best album I've listened to in a long time, and I listen to a lot of music. Previously my favorite song this year was \\"Bullets\\" by Tunng, but \\"Carolina Dream\\" at the end of this album blows that one away. The composition of that song is pure genius. Jack White, Brendan Benson and company have outdone themselves with this one. At least once a day it's heard over my iPod. I hope this is their last album, because it would be hard to top.

1416550518|5.0|This uniquely complex novel will appeal to anyone who loved the British miniseries \\"Upstairs Downstairs\\" and the book \\"The Forsythe Saga\\" by John Galsworthy. The story begins prior to World War I and ends in the twenty first century. The reader is drawn gradually into the lives of a wealthy household in England, a family of privilege where loyalty, honor and secrets abound. At the age of fourteen Grace Bradley is accepted to become a servant to the Hartford family at Riverton House. Her mother has served in the house in the past, so Grace is following in her footsteps. Later, Grace becomes a lady's maid to Hannah one of the daughters of Lord Frederick and remains in this position even after Hannah married. Grace remains loyal and kept Hannah's secret even after she fell into temptation. Hannah became involved in a love triangle and a death occured as a direct result of this event. The true events were neatly covered up and only three people knew the consequences. Only Grace remained alive who knew the truth of what happened that fateful night. She wanted to unburden herself of the truth. She was making a tape of her life story to give to her grandson Marcus, a famous author and writer of best selling novels.<br /><br />Grace is elderly, in her late late nineties and living in a nursing home when the reader learns her story. Two young ladies introduce themselves to her, one is a film director and the other is an actress who will play Grace in the film they are making about life at Riverton House.

Together, David and Robbie later volunteer to fight the Germans in World War I, they feel a need to fight for their country and are drawn to adventure ... Unfortunately, David is killed in action and although Robbie survived the war and returned, clearly he suffered from post traumatic stress syndrome ...<br /><br />Told in a flashback manner, Grace recalls her duties as a servant and her relationship to the family as she relates what life was like at Riverton House.

Her mother never talked about Grace's father, just that they were separated ... First, we learn of Grace when at fourteen years of age, she gained acceptance and learned loyalty to the Hartford family. The servants were treated with respect and politeness by the family. Next, we learn of Sir Frederick and his various attempts at making money to maintain his lifestyle and the upkeep of Riverton House. The young lives of David, Hannah, and Emmeline are described, including their secret game. The reader learns of their interests and different personalities.

Hannah comes to her rescue several times and saves her reputation, even her life. Hannah's father nearly loses Riverton House but ends up selling it to the Luxtons, a wealthy American family who are prosperous in business. Grace reveals some complex relationships and feelings which arise due to the family union after Hannah marries Theodore Luxton ... Robbie Hume becomes an author and poet and reenters Hannah's life.

0452289963|5.0|This book started slow for me, but I kept on reading and was I ever glad!  For me, this book was not only education, but also a validation, which is one of the reasons he said he wrote it -- to be a validation for those of us who are out here in the hinterland, doing the best we can with what we have.<br /><br />I very much enjoyed this book and bought a copy for one of my friends who seems to be \\"on the path\\".  I would highly recommend this book for people who are interested in enlightenment and doing the needed personal work.  I am reading it for the second time and know people who are in their third reading, so it is a book of multiple layers.<br /><br />Forever, it seems, I have been interested in learning more about the ego, and have felt that people who were into ego \\"bashing\\" were somehow missing the point.  Here is a wonderful teaching about this subject, which is so very welcome.  Being introduced to the idea of seeing my reactions as part of ego has been a real eye-opener.  Perfect right timing.
B0013D8LOU|1.0|From start to finish this filmed version of \\"Sweeney\\" is achingly sad -- this show, the greatest musical ever written and the most cinematic of all of Sondheim's musicals -- could have been a brilliant, incredibly dynamic and engrossing film.<br />Instead, Burton dredges up this drab, dreary, pointless exercise in the limits of one man's imagination. (When every movie you make looks the same, doesn't that say something?)<br />Having Toby played by an actual child adds a certainly poignant quality, but sadly there is nothing else about this film that even comes close to generating the electricity of the stage version.<br />Whatever you may think about the acting abilities of Depp and Carter, the plain fact is that they simply can't sing the score. (It's especially telling on the DVD extras when people talk about hearing Depp's voice and being \\"relieved\\" -- it's like listening to the drama teacher talk about the football captain's audition for the school musical.)<br />And the thudding, literal addition of all the gore -- what's interesting is that the movie is ten times bloodier than the stage version, but not one-tenth as scary. It's puzzling that Burton and company would think that an audience would be more afraid of chorus scenes than vivisection.<br />I've spent most of my life looking forward to a movie version of this show ... and this one, sadly, is the only one I'll ever get.<br />When all's said and done, \\"Cabaret\\" still remains the greatest film version of a Broadway musical.
B0013XS8A2|2.0|Very disappointing. To be fair, the album isn't bad when rated in the classical music department! This is not the music of Mike Oldfield I can fall in love with as I did with Mike's early, and even some later work. Classical, orchestral, and don't get me started on the violins... but where's Mike's sampled electric guitar? Sorry Mike, this one is going to the bottom of my CD collection. I'm still looking for album with magnitude of Tubular Bells, Amarok, Ommadawn, Platinum, QE2, and many more released before year 2000.
0525948023|1.0|Everyone is entitled to their personal opinion; that's one of America's greatest attributes, however, we will have to fight in order to keep it.  As for the book; I think it sucks.

In 2001 after hearing elite on dbz lord slug and change on dbz cooler's revenge something told me this album was going to be awsome and it was some songs was relaxing like knife prty and digital bath and the the other songs were serious metal especally elite the way it was sung was amazing and the guitars outstanding and I loved change that song was real deftones for your ears this album was amazing.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|That's just a bit of humor. I have to be honest, I love this game. It is very fun, but it takes 1 game for people to truly understand how to play. I still consider it relatively easy to learn though. I like the game, but I have to admit - I feel the dice hate me! Actually, I got rid of the original dice because they were too light for my liking.   Anyway, this is a great game to play with a couple friends. I think if you add the expansion and take it to 5-6 players, it becomes a very fun game.   This edition with the framing seas (which I don't have) looks like a great addition...
0316010669|5.0|While I'm a bit surprised to find that many people didn't care for this book, I found it fascinating.  I had no idea that there was so much going on in our brains that was subconscious.  Knowing that the shape of an ice-cream container changes the way a person enjoys the product or why Pepsi wins the sip contest over Coke may not change my life, but the fact that there are reasons that can be measured and explained intrigued me to no end. And the items that related to race were both scary and very sobering.  I've listened to this book on audio several times and enjoy it every time.

B000LPQ6DE|5.0|This adaptation of Jane Eyre blew me away! The story came alive for me like never before, and the actors were completely believable as the characters. And what a screenplay. The dialogue was true to the novel while still branching out, and adding even more depth.    Truly stunning! Loved it!!
B000VNMMQQ|5.0|Great movie and the seller sent the DVD to me in good time, didn't have to wait more than a week after I ordered it.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|This is an excellent recording of the musical. There is also a very minimum of dialogue included, what you have here is pretty much just the songs, which I took as a positive. Some of them, however, are really short sleepers that you pay little attention to in the play.    The great ones, however, are magnificently performed and sound wonderful.    All in all, a good purchase.    Side note, album art is beautiful, liner notes non-existent.
B0000640SA|1.0|I think Memento is a fine, interesting film. But if you just want to see the movie itself, DO NOT BUY THE 2-DISC VERSION. you literally have to participate in these series of psych-type tests in order to get at anything you actually want to see, and there's NO WAY AROUND the tests. you can never watch without going through them. you're paying for the tests, not just the film. i'm not exaggerating. i bought one, tried for maybe ten minutes, and now i'm putting it back on sale on amazon.    tj
0312360266|4.0|I love this book. Couldn't put it down. Read it straight through in about 3 days. If my mother hadn't interrupted me would have been done in a day. Great book about a young woman's journey about discovering who she is while being introduced to a new world and the world of vampires. Can't wait to read the second book. Lots of surprises and twists in this book.

B0013FXWU6|5.0|\\"There will be blood\\" is a penetrating analysis about two equally transcendental lines; it's about how an audacious and smart oilman, who explores and makes drillings in search of the devoted black gold,  may become when the dreams of ambition and greed transform themselves in ethic values; and how these fatal consequences isolate him from his friends and family; on the other hand we have in contraposition, the religious fervor of a faker who pretends to be the embodiment of a spiritual call.<br /><br />It's not a mere coincidence the chosen historical period reminds us to the well reminded episode that inspired \\"Inherit the wind\\" in which the religious intolerance was represented in a vast portion of the nation.<br /><br />Daniel Day Lewis once more demonstrates us why he is one the ten best actors in this planet with his spellbinding performance.<br /><br />A crude and revealing testimonial of forceful transcendence
B000021YQV|5.0|My mind races at the thought of having to compare Toxicity with the first album. They are both amazing CDs that compliment each other so well thats why its such a mindf**k to pick a favorite between the two. I can choose  favorite tracks; Shimmy and Needles. All I can say is that Toxicity is a better album to smoke pot to since I cant decide which album is better.
B0000UI2NM|5.0|I love both the orginal and sequal, you can get the directors unrated cut of first movie with a few small extras on regular dvd. I dont have blueray but I do have a philips upconvert dvd player and it looks great compared t 480p u have to use a hdmi connection. I agree with another reviewer who said there was little difference in dvd/blue-ray while I didn't do a scene by scene comparison I have seen it on both formats at local big box store. I was looking at a tv just happens they had one hooked up to blueray on one side and on another a regular dvd to the salesmans dismay I asked him to hook up the dvd player using hdmi VIOLA upconverted to 1080i looked good to me,order your hdmi cables online and get the movies used from another seller on amazon save some cash. AWESOME MOVIES BOTH UNDERWORLD AND EVOLUTION BEST SEEN IF YOU PLAY THE FIRST PART OF SECOND MOVIE THEN SWITCH TO FIRST PICK UP SEQUAL RIGHT WHERE FIRST LEAVES OFF STORY MAKES MORE SENSE ESPECIALLY IF VIEWING UNCUT ORIGINAL. totally recommended, and hold on buying blue-ray tech is changing so fast you never know whats around the next corner but dvd is not going anywhere soon as in the way of the vhs.
B0013D8LOK|3.0|This is a quick review of the dvd's image quality.  Although the image quality is excellent in terms of sharpness, black level, and color, the transfer somehow created lots of shimmering on small straight lines when the camera pans.  It is as if it is an interlaced signal being deinterlaced by a bad dvd player.  I have not seen a recent, high budget film transfer to dvd look as bad as Sweeney Todd does in this one respect.  It was quite distracting at times; though I was watching it on a 106\\" screen--it would probably be less noticeable on a small screen.
B000F1IQNM|5.0|This is a great family film.  With laugh out loud moments - it's something that my children like as well as my husband!

B000ZLFALI|4.0|This was a big suprise! I actually bought the movie for a friend...and ended up really liking it. We found ourselves relating to the times and to the characters in the film...and had great fun watching the film. THe music worked right along with the story...and did not detract or bore us to pieces...which is saying a lot!
B0010X745K|2.0|The Mist starts out well but soon shifts from a horror/monster movie into a study of the disintegration of humanity when faced with horror -  and not a good study at that.  The actual monster scenes aren't well done and lack much tension (save for a few moments here and there) and are relatively short.  The bulk of the story centers around the characters devolving into baser versions of themselves all with an odd, out of place religious theme.  By the midpoint it was just too much to sit through.  I finished the film for the sake of finishing it, but it was lame, predictable and stupid.    SPOILER ALERT (if you keep reading now then don't waste your time posting a comment saying \\"you ruined the ending\\"...)    I too disagree with the ending.  Not only did the character not deserve to have that happen, but it was also out of character.  Here is a man that has done all he can do to keep his son and him alive and moving and when the gas is gone he just calls it in and blows the kids brains out.  He doesn't stop to think for even two seconds that maybe there could be something else done like say, siphoning some gas out of all the other vehicles they've spotted, taking bearings of the surroundings to see if there is a safe place to hole up, at least waiting it out to see what other options might open up.  For all he knew the wind could spring up at any minute and blow the mist away.  He has been rationale and \\"get it done\\" up to this point, even going so far as to risk his life to get medicine for a dying man, so that to just suddenly give up like that was too much to accept.  I would have expected him to take his son's life only as a last resort.  If that was a decision any parent found themselves contemplating I bet they would have done anything and everything before accepting the way out the way he did.

0765318741|5.0|I saw \\"I Am Legend\\" the movie with my fiancee at the theater in January.  We both liked the movie, and after watching it, we went across the street to the video store to rent a couple of movies for the night.  The clerk there was very informative and told us that the movie was \\"Somewhat\\" based on the book of the same name.  Being the curious type, I bought the book, and read it.<br /><br />The differences are very obvious, and I won't point them out for those of you that want to read the book if you've seen the movie or see the movie if you've read the book.<br /><br />I will say that I think the book is superior (Aren't they always?) to the movie.  There were some times in the movie that gave me the creeps, but the book gave me the creeps all the way through.  It's a very psychological thriller of a book.<br /><br />The book is short as well.  In my copy, the story \\"I Am Legend\\" only runs 159 pages, and is an easy read.  My copy also has several short stories by Matheson after \\"I Am Legend\\", and these stories are entertaining too.
1846680492|5.0|This is the loveliest little book I've read since I discovered Helene Hanff's \\"84 Charing Cross Road\\" a million years ago.  Using the Queen as his catalyst, Alan Bennett gives us this love story between a new reader and the world that opens to her through the magic of books.  He could be speaking of any bibliophile, but because it is Her Royal Highness, the opportunities for wit and plot twists in this slim volume are multiplied exponentially.  There were several beautiful quotes which I will be adding to my favorites list, and I recognized myself on every page as a person who struggles to find time to read and resents having the obligations of everyday life intrude upon that time.<br /><br />Time spent reading is never wasted; furthermore, time spent reading The Uncommon Reader will be looked back upon with great affection.
0452289963|5.0|Most of the ideas in Tolle's new book are not new, but presented in an enlightened, understandable manner.  A group of 6 friends view together the dialogue with Oprah on her website.  I believe ideas such as these will raise the understanding of our culture and our race to live in much better ways than we have been.

B000VZC4CQ|5.0|This is the better of the two Joy Division albums, though their first is an excellent album itself. This music is just so charged with the intense feelings of Ian Curtis, you can't possibly describe how heavy this album is. I won't say more. Just go and buy it. It is worth your money, it is worth your time, and if you can, go see the movie Control and enjoy Joy Division. Music this good cannot go unheard.
B000SO7OM0|5.0|This is a fantastic live album of Loreena McKennitt, as most of her live albums are.  I must have listened to this CD for several weeks on my iPod. I had the pleasure of seeing Loreena at Barnes & Noble in Manhattan and then later at Radio City Music Hall.  She and the musicians were magnificent. Especially the violinist - Hugh Marsh. He is phenomenal.     This CD really captures the live energy that was in the concert I went to in the US.  The CD/DVD is a nice little package. On the DVD you get a glimpse of some historic architectures and monuments that Loreena visits and narrates about. She talks of the cultural influences and the meanings behind them.  She gives a narration before each piece she sings; giving you a thorough understanding of how she builds her inspiration.  I highly recommend this CD/DVD. You will not be disappointed.

B0000029GA|3.0|I recently read a book called \\"It's No Secret\\" by Carmen Bryan, the mother of Nas's daughter named Destiny.  In the book she said that Nas was uninspired at the time and didn't want to go to the studio.  She said that she encouraged him to go to the studio daily until he finished \\"Illmatic.\\"  After reading that and hearing the countless good reviews from people's mouths, I knew I had to listen for myself.  I feel like a fish out of water because I did enjoy some of the album, but the beats and hooks weren't impressive at all.  What really gives this album points is the profound and unforgettable lyrics.  Nas impressed me with most of his versus.  Further, I have most of the albums that followed \\"Illmatic\\", and I must say, I have never heard this much energy from Nas, but it was a virtue.<br /><br /> \\"Illmatic\\" is very short for an album, clocking in at thirty-nine point six minutes.  I don't usually care for long albums, but this is one of the shortest albums I have come across in a long while and it was a bit of a turn-off.  This album has a few guest appearances, and all of the men do well.  Dark, haunting production is found from track one to ten.  I never was a big fan of the beats on Nas's albums, but this album has some really bad beats.  What gave it a bit of saving grace is the fact that one of my favorite songs of all time is sampled: Michael Jackson's \\"Human Nature.\\"  \\"Human Nature\\" was sampled on the last song called \\"It Ain't Hard to Tell.\\"  Lyrically, this is an amazing song and I listen to it all the time.  The horns should have been left off of this song, but they don't take too much away from its quality.  \\"It Ain't Hard to Tell\\" and \\"Life's a B****\\" are easily this album's best moments.  (\\"Life's a B**** samples \\"Yearning for Your Love.\\")  This album was released in 1994.  The only song I can remember receiving any airtime is \\"The World is Yours.\\"  Music listeners loved that song.<br /><br /> I recommend this album to rap lovers, but, in all honesty, if you love rap, you should already have \\"Illmatic.\\"<br /><br />Mikeisha's Top 5<br /><br />1. \\"It Ain't Hard to Tell\\"<br />2. \\"Life's a Bitch\\"<br />3. \\"NY State of Mind\\"<br />4. \\"Memory Lane\\"<br />5. \\"The World is Yours\\"rap, you should already have \\"Illmatic.\\"      Mikeisha's Top 5    1. \\"It Ain't Hard to Tell\\"  2. \\"Life's a Bitch\\"  3. \\"NY State of Mind\\"  4. \\"Memory Lane\\"  5. \\"The World is Yours\\"
B0013BNY2Q|4.0|After several years of relatively mellow and muted atmospheric albums from these alt-rock pioneers, R.E.M. bounce back with a renewed sense of urgency and power that has been largely absent since their 80's hard rock hey day on LIFE'S RICH PAGEANT and DOCUMENT. Despite the euphoria felt by many long-term fans over the fact that they are \\"rocking again,\\" the album is pretty dark, full of conflict, turmoil and bitterness. Yet there are some rays of light that shine through.<br /><br />Recorded quickly and only 35 minutes long, ACCELERATE rushes by like a hurricane wind, featuring several tracks below the 3 minute mark. While I generally agree with those who contend that the more subdued R.E.M. of recent years has been somewhat disappointing (especially on the lackluster AROUND THE SUN), I still contend that UP is a very different but very strong album well worth hearing (despite prevailing popular opinion). Still, it IS great to hear the band crank it up again although they do sound a little too eager in places, like they're trying too hard (especially Michael Stipe). Also, I'm no audiophile, but I honestly don't get all the whining about the mastering job. It's hardly RAW POWER for Pete's sake.<br /><br />BREAKDOWN!<br /><br />\\"Living Well Is The Best Revenge\\" - A metallic jangle from Peter Buck's guitar followed quickly by a raging full-band assault announces that R.E.M. are back in full-on rock mode. Michael Stipe borderline shouts his words while Mike Mills rocks out with busy, melodic basslines and sings great counterpoint melodies in classic R.E.M. style. *****<br /><br />\\"Man-Sized Wreath\\" - immediately settling into a slightly funky groove, the band swings hard on this heart-felt rejection of the \\"pageantry of empty gestures.\\" *****<br /><br />\\"Supernatural Superserious\\" - This driving mid-tempo rocker features a crisp power-chord guitar riff and more super-melodic progressions on bass, background vocals and additional guitar. A poignant observation about the growing pains most of us have to endure in our youth. ****<br /><br />\\"Hollow Man\\" - showcases a quiet/loud/quiet dynamic and another solid melody. The title is pretty self-explanatory . . . the \\"Believe in me, believe in nothing\\" line at the chorus is unfortunately a bit cliche and less than compelling. But the picked guitar and piano parts on the softer intervals are sublime and Stipe's singing is exquisite. ***<br /><br />\\"Houston\\" - is a moody yet jangling acoustic rocker with pulsing organ and what sounds like a groaning cello (probably a guitar though - ?). The song recalls some of their more brooding downtempo tracks from the 80's. Sung from the viewpoint of a Hurricane Katrina survivor (the most obvious interpretation at least) who struggles to maintain a positive outlook in the face of disaster - and succeeds. *****<br /><br />\\"Accelerate\\" - the lyrics on this forceful rocker and title track are devoid of the hope proffered by the previous song despite what the title alone might suggest. The word itself in this case refers to the increase in speed experienced during a free-fall and the narrator laments that his life is spinning out of control. ****<br /><br />\\"Until The Day Is Done\\" - Even the downtempo tracks like this one recall LIFES RICH PAGEANT, undoubtably one of their best albums ever. This bleak yet gorgeous tune can easily be read as a scathing indictment of the Bush administration. *****<br /><br />\\"Mr. Richards\\" - resembles the sound and feel of certain MONSTER tracks (another one of their best albums, IMHO). Another thinly-veiled attack on President Bush, it's steady, confident and bold. I've heard it's really about Michael Richards (Kramer on Seinfeld) after he went off on a bizarre, racist rant onstage. I don't know about that and it doesn't really matter anyways. One great thing about songs is you can interpret them any way you want to. *****<br /><br />\\"Sing For The Submarine\\" - An eerie, spacy track that's also a powerful rock song. It's enigmatic, possibly about escapism or maybe about starting over in a post-apocalypic underwater fantasy. Mysterious and dreamy, I rate this as one of the best tracks on the album. *****<br /><br />\\"Horse To Water\\" - Possibly the hardest rocker in the collection, this one's a quick blast of energy with Stipe singing in defiance of someone who would drag him down (if given the chance). A simple verse/chorus/verse tune, not the best but still quite effective. ***<br /><br />\\"I'm Gonna DJ\\" - This \\"devil-may-care\\"-style rock jam (\\"Death is pretty final/ I'm collecting vinyl/ I'm gonna DJ at the end of the WORLD!!!\\") sounds like it wants to be the new \\"It's The End of the World as We Know It (And I Feel Fine)\\" but isn't nearly as catchy. Stipe sounds like he's trying WAY too hard on this one and it's not too convincing as a result. The song is still fairly enjoyable even though it closes out the album in an abrupt fashion that isn't entirely satisfying. Others will find this to be a fitting finale for the rushed, immediate vibe found on ACCELERATE. ***ypic underwater fantasy.

B000002MJ0|5.0|My Bloody Valentine - Isn't Anything (1988)<br /><br />I would have to say I prefer this album to LOVELESS. The guitars don't fill up the speakers in a strange, otherworldly way quite like they do on that album, but there's still plenty of lush guitar noize to savour. It must be the unrestrained rocking-out which matches the dream pop that I really love - especially on the second side (beginning with \\"Feed Me With Your Kiss\\"). That side really JAMS in a gleeful kind of way - gives me a great feeling. \\"Sueisfine\\" is pretty trippy and I swear they're really saying 'Suicide' which is a twisted thing to gleefully repeat over and over. \\"Several Girls Galore\\" is darker and more sensual with bassier drums to match the seductive female vocals. \\"Nothing Much To Lose\\" is another highlight with absolutely spastic drums that do something different each time they cut loose. This song is one of several that takes dramatic turns, leading the listener to surprisingly different places - a bit like 2 or 3 songs in 1.<br /><br />Side 1 has some real gems on it as well, but I'm not too crazy about the slower songs \\"Lose My Breath\\" and \\"No More Sorry.\\" They're not great musically; they're a bit atonal-sounding in fact. However, I've gotten more used to them in time and actually have an appreciation for them. \\"All I Need\\" is another slow one which might take some getting used to, but its brilliance shines through with its V.U. pulse and shimmering guitar wash. To be honest, Kevin Shields doesn't have the strongest vocal quality, but I dig it nevertheless. These minor drawbacks aren't nearly enough to deny this album the 5 star rating it deserves. An alt-rock classic and every bit as essential as LOVELESS.
1591841992|5.0|As an longtime napkin scribbler and doodler, I was so pleased to see someone actually put some rigor and science into that process! Bring it from the bar room to the boardroom, so to speak.   Anyone who even remotely buys into the idea that we are becoming increasingly dependent on right brained thinking for success needs to be exposed to Roam's work.    The ideas and techniques in this book can make the difference between engaging people's brains and losing their interest.   Between \\"making a sale\\" and losing a prospect.    Between getting your idea across and boring people to tears.   Very important piece of work for anyone who is in the business of communicating ideas -- and who isn't??!!     The ideas in this book are the types of things that I will keep coming back in my work -- looking for new ways, techniques, approaches etc. to  communicate in a powerful way.   My only complaint -- I wish that the publisher would have invested more in high quality color images, since the work itself is so visually oriented.

B0006IUDXA|5.0|Richard Dean Anderson plays secret agent Angus MacGyver, a man so brilliant he can make land mines out of pine cones, he can fix the brakes of a car while it's moving, and he can single-handedly defeat the armed forces of the Soviet Union multiple times, once even in Afghanistan. This is the first season of the series on DVD, and it is impossible not to be entertained and amused by the cheesy irrepressibility of this show.<br /><br />Every week MacGyver gets himself into some kind of impossible jam, but due to his knowledge of, well, pretty much everything, he always manages to escape. I love the episodes with \\"opening gambits\\", pieces of plot unconnected to the main story that run before the credits to get the episodes up to the proper length for airing on network television. My favorite example of the opening gambit in this set is in \\"Deathlock\\" in which MacGyver's coffin (which he is cleverly using to escape East Berlin) transforms into a jet ski. It's a sequence that is so ridiculous that I never tire of it.<br /><br />These episodes are all outlandish, fun, and enjoyable. In addition to \\"Deathlock\\" my other favorite of the set is \\"Target MacGyver\\", in which MacGyver and his grandfather are targeted by a professional assassin, \\"Axminister\\", a bad guy who might be more fearsome except he looks for all the world like Al Roker wearing the sunglasses elderly patients wear home after cataract surgery. The only episode I didn't really care for in this set was \\"Every Time She Smiles\\" which features an actress playing imbecilic actress \\"Penny Parker\\" in a fracas with the Bulgarian Secret Police. I could almost not make it through this episode due to the extreme grating nature of Penny Parker: obviously MacGyver is truly a man of steel to be able to endure her.<br /><br />This show is off the charts for ridiculous plotlines, but it is fun, entertaining, lightweight entertainment that plays well even today. My only critique of the DVD set is the complete absence of extras, and in the extreme Spartan nature of the menus. Other than wishing from some commentary by Richard Dean Anderson and Henry Winkler, though, this is a great set, and I recommend it for a nostalgic bit of amusing and entertaining television.partan nature of the menus.

B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Color me stupid. I send all this money to my cable company for subscribing to Showtime, and I never watched Dexter? Now I'm a day late and more than a dollar short!<br /><br />But purchasing Dexter - The First Season at Amazon was worth it. How good is it? Well, there are 12 apx 1 hour episodes in the 4-DVD set, and it took my wife and me less than 12 days to watch the whole series. I think that we even watched three episodes in one night. In other words, the show is compelling enough to make you very want to get to the next episode.<br /><br />So certainly one of the good things about Dexter on DVD is that you don't need to wait 12 weeks to see a season from start to finish. But certainly the best thing about the series is how well done it was.<br /><br />Dexter (played by Michael C. Hall of HBO's [[ASIN:B00006NT1S Six Feet Under]] fame) is a blood spatter analyst with Miami Homicide. It's his job to help solve murders, and he also happens to moonlight as a serial killer....Just a side note that last part.<br /><br />The acting in the show is terrific, and the thrills and twists are plentiful. Combine the nature of Dexter's professional life with his favorite pass-time, and you can bet your carotid artery that there's plenty of blood in the show too. But rest assured that the show isn't just about killing. Relationships, family, the inner working of a homicide squad...all of this \\"stuff\\" is also packed neatly into the Dexter series and makes the show one of the best on TV that I've seen in a long long time.<br /><br />The show (I hear because of a lack of programming due to the recent writers strike) has been ported from Showtime over to sister company CBS television, but I just can't imagine this show without the R-rated material...from the blood to the adult oriented situations and language. So I'd recommend this DVD set highly over trying to catch this on \\"regular\\" TV.<br /><br />Add this bloody-good show to your cart. I've already got a pre-order in for [[ASIN:B000V86OKG Dexter - The Complete Second Season]] since I missed that on Showtime too.since I missed that on Showtime too.
0811836363|4.0|I am 56 and so just caught the end of the Beatles era.  I enjoy their music, but would not label myself as a Beatles \\"fan\\".  What I liked most about this book was discovering what happened in fact that I was only vaguely aware of at the time.      One strength of the book is the illustrations.  Many of these would not be considered worthwhile to include in a biography, but they can stir interest, such as seeing portions of contracts for their performances did for me.  Another strength is hearing the story directly from the band members. (John's \\"contributions\\" were taken from interviews he gave prior to his death.)  They do debunk some silly rumors that have persisted about the band.  I also enjoyed hearing the circumstances that prompted the writing of many of the songs they recorded.      One negative is that, being an anthology, you get the various opinions on what occurred at key points in time.  These can be repetitive and even contradictory among the different band members.  So, you do not get the persistence and continuity of having one point of view from the author.  The book follows the general sequence of the band's development, but doesn't provide an exact chronology which is sometimes an annoying omission.  At times the Beatles are quite candid and at other times I feel like they are offering up answers that protect one another as I would expect from any close group of musicians.    All in all I now have a much greater appreciation of the Beatles phenomenon, their contribution to popular culture and their personalities.  However, I still feel that I know \\"the whole story\\" and would only consider this book to be one key reference towards understanding the group.

0679759328|3.0|I ordered this book because it was the March selection for my book club.  Ms. Brookner has a distinctive writing style and a rather clever sense of humour, but the story she tells is age-old and a bit worn -- despite the two major twists and turns she carefully builds up to.  It's a story about a still-single, perhaps destined to be single forever, fiction writer who writes romance stories that are alluded to as being rather old-fashioned, just like their creator.  Edith Hope is old-fashioned in the way that she cooks and waits upon her man, but he is married to another woman.  Edith hopes (how clever Ms. Brookner) for something better, and the setting for this hope is the Hotel du Lac where other single women migrate before the bleak winter season settles into the Swiss landscape and their beings.  This setting is where the age-old scenario of sarcastic, biting soundbites of cat fight and cutting glares is exchanged between women competing for the scarce male attention at the hotel.  Even with Ms. Brookner's writing flair and unexpected turns in the story line, it lacks the oomph to make it anything more than diverting read.  Actually, the book club discussion was much better than the book itself.

I do believe it will take me a few more listens to rank it up there with some of their previous work...not quite as natural to me as they were...but I will get there. I can see why this was called one of the best albums of 2007. It seems like the guys from Radiohead will be turning out rock music that is both unique and thought-provoking for a very long time to come.

BUT, in less than a year the rechargable battery would no longer take a full charge and I had to spend another $25 for a new battery. Even with the new battery, the sweeper's performance really declined to the point that I'm now shopping for a replacement vac. While I loved the Swivel Sweeper for the first 10 months, I will not be buying a new one to replace my old one.
B000I2J0W4|2.0|I'm not the biggest fan of Stephen King. I've only read a couple of his books, and find them notoriously difficult to get into. Especially Carrie, get to the point! My dad has all his books, the only one I think I actually enjoyed was The Green Mile. I don't remember ever reading The Shining book, I have seen the movie before though with my dad.<br /><br />The first positive thing I will say, is that some of the opening scenes, and the scenery around the Outlook Hotel, is crisp and so gorgeous in High Definition. The opening shots, when the camera is tracking the car driving up the mountains, is absolutely amazing. It's just perfect.<br /><br />The score to this movie is really atrocious though. It's not even nice noise, it's jerky and meaningless. It doesn't add to the movie. I could have done a better score. It just doesn't work, or enhance the movie in any way.<br /><br />Jack playing funnily enough Jack, is amazing. He's the only reason for watching this movie. His portrayal of Jack slowly descending into madness (\\"All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy\\") makes you keep watching the movie, since he's in pretty much nearly every scene. Up against Shelley Duvall (who I wasn't keen on personally), he steals the show, even when she's doing her wide eyed screaming scenes. He does his utmost to scare the viewers, and he certainly scared me. There is a couple of times I have to look away from the screen - especially one of his last scenes in the movie when he's frozen. I actually have to turn physically away when that happens, I can't watch him, that image is burned into my mind now.<br /><br />There's something about the late Stanley Kubrick's work, that I really don't like. I've seen this now twice, and I've also seen Eyes Wide Shut, and neither seems to have anything that resembles a plot. And he was such a perfectionist as well, getting actors to ridiculous amounts of takes (127 takes for Shelley for one scene). Nah. They just don't appeal somehow.<br /><br />I don't understand what all the good reviews are for. I don't get it.ews are for. I don't get it.

0786239212|5.0|Best book I've read so far this year.  Despite a couple bumps (like length), this novel was awesome.  McEwan's writing is perfect, and I look forward to reading more of his novels.  Even though I say his writing style is perfect, the book is a little lengthy, but it did not take away from my engrossment in the plot.  I do say, I wish the second part of the book had been longer, and Briony's parts less, but I still think it would have taken too much away from the point of the book.  The point being not just a love story, but the sadness that we can try our best to manhandle and control life, but ultimately cannot.  I don't want to give too much away!  The ending I think is superb and lets us remind ourselves of the greatness of McEwan's writing- to suck us in completely to the point where we become more than just a reader-- we become a critic of life.  I loved the ending-- it gives me a reason to continue reading fiction: someone always pulls something out that's different and refreshing, if not heartbreaking.  Alas, I've said too much...<br /><br />*I saw the movie after I read the book, and am glad I read the book first.  Although the movie tries extremely hard to fit every morsel and important piece of the story into 130 minutes, it cannot live up to the book in any way shape or form.  You especially miss out on Ian McEwan's masterful writing.  It is worth watching, but please don't forget the book!

B0013BNY2Q|3.0|While the last few records were by no means master pieces, I found great moments in each. I feel Accelerate is the start of a new birth in guitar rock for R.E.M. but not the great record that I think will come in the future. This record fits somewhere between \\"Monster\\" and \\"Document\\". The mix is somewhat in your face without much dynamic making it sound like an R.E.M. punk record. \\"Horse to Water\\" should please the fans of \\"End of the World\\" and \\"Bad Day\\" and my selection for 2nd single. \\"Supernatural Superserious\\" is a great single and already hearing it overplayed. Good for the band bad for us fans.  \\"Hollow Man\\" starts with a nice mellow piano intro and then kicks into a really catchy chorus. (3rd single) \\"Houston\\" gives a reminder of \\"Swan Swan Hummingbird\\" I have listened to the record several times on a real CD player and now on my Ipod and I can say the snare drum on \\"Houston\\" sounds like crap on an Ipod. I'm Gonna DJ\\" is a cool little punk rock gem as if R.E.M. was listening to the \\"Sex Pistols and \\"Mission of Burma\\" while recording. \\"Until the Day is Done\\" would not sound out of place on \\"Fables\\" or \\"Life's Rich Pageant\\" but would not have been one of the stand out tracks. \\"Mr. Richards\\" would have fit nicely on \\"Document\\". Yes this record has a lot of songs that could have fit nicely on older records but feel like the songs are not as strong. That does not mean I do not like \\"Accelerate\\" because I do, I would like it a bit more if it had one \\"World Leader Pretend\\" somewhere on it. 3 1/2 stars!

B00005JPAO|4.0|To confront the Queen of England, Tony Blair and the death of Lady Diana, the Princess of Wales, was dramatic at the time but has totally aged today. And the film has aged to. This big vignette, this enormous cameo in normal life that this week after the tragic end of a young woman was has become quaint, charmingly quaint but with little meaning left.<br /><br />During that week, or even that summer, the monarchy nearly fell in England but the Queen, though surrounded by too many people who were deaf and blind, managed to hear the piece of advice given to her by Tony Blair and she followed it and saved that monarchy. Is that what happened or not?<br /><br />That is not the problem. It is reassuring to believe it is what happened. But it is also important to understand that in today's world what counts is public opinion. We may think public opinion is looking for emotional and sentimental empathy instead of real deep inner grief. But this public opinion remains the yardstick with which we are to measure and determine our behavior.<br /><br />Apparently Stephen Frears wants to make us believe that Elizabeth II did feel and understand the necessity to accept that rule. Something of the kind surely happened.<br /><br />Yet the film is in no way transcendingly immortal. The best part remains Helen Mirren who is embodying a Queen that is superbly heart raking and soul moving.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU
0446364495|4.0|After reading a gut-wrenching novel, I decided to read something that I thought would be light and quick, so I settled down with the Bridges of Madison County.  I don't normally read romances, but I had heard a good review, and I thought it would be worth the time.  It turned out that it was, although not the light reading I had anticipated.  A very emotionally draining book, this is a story that will stick with me for a time.  It is written as though it were a nonfiction book, even with a beginning on how the story came about and was researched, and ending with an interview with a musician who knew Robert Kincaid, one of the main characters.  But don't be fooled, this is a piece of fiction, and there was no Robert Kincaid.  This is a deeply moving love story of two strangers who fall in love, but spend only four days together before making the decision to part forever.  Separate, but not forgotten, their lives were from that time on woven together.
