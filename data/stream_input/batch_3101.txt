B008AK8FHM|4.0|I have been studying near death experiences since 1976 when my dad had cancer. I have a friend who refers to the NDE-ers as the &#34;Dead Saints&#34;, who bring back their experiences of heaven to us. I had heard about Dr. Alexander, and thought he would be able to<br />give a new reference point for it. I was hoping that he would inspire other scientists/doctors to see things differently. I would have liked more detail about what he learned and felt while over there.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I don't want to pay extra for extra lives. I guess it's probably a good thing that you can only play for so long--if you don't advance to the next level, it makes you wait a period of time (I've had to wait 1/2 hour) to play again...keeps you from spending your entire day or night playing this game.
0380715430|1.0|What I mean is: if you've played \\"Boner\\"--the game where two competitors (typically students in school) must one-up each other in loudness of \\"Boner\\"-yelling until one is busted or gives up--well, you've got an idea of the breathless, sugar-addled goofiness this book exudes. Also, its organizational sophistication, respect for learning, and care for accuracy. If you've ever studied language, or even thought it about it for ten minutes or so in your car, you'll probably get a queasy feeling within a few pages.<br /><br />This book is exceptionally rich pickin's when it comes to criticism, but here are a few of my favorite things that haven't been mentioned in the reviews yet (as far as I can see):<br /><br />1) page 223 \\"[the word] 'Bollix' is commonly used in America to describe a confused situation...\\" Er, maybe not super commonly. Well, Bryson cites one newspaper article with it, so who's dumb NOW?<br /><br />2) you want seamless organization? How about Chapter 1 \\"The World's Language,\\" Chapter 3 \\"Global Language,\\" and Chapter 12 \\"English as a World Language.\\" I find myself wondering if at some point in the process Bryson and his editors actually tried to get 16 chapter titles that all meant the same thing, but then realized there was a college football game on TV and forgot.<br /><br />3) on page 81, you get the amazing assertion that \\"in-, for example, almost always implies negation,\\" a clause that itself (arguably) contains a word with a non-negational variant of the 'in-' prefix, one of dozens if not hundreds in the language. But the sentence is not finished (and I have elided nothing): \\"but not with 'invaluable,' while -less is equally negative, as a rule, but not with 'priceless.'\\" Except for the fact that dictionaries standardly define the first form as something along the lines of \\"NOT able to be valued,\\" and the second form as \\"invaluable.\\" So, although swimming in examples that confirm the straw-mannish irrelevance of the first observation, Bryson manages to come up with an example that FAILS to demonstrate what he wants, while inadvertently using one that does. Wow. We're in the hands of a master.<br /><br />4) okay, one bonus thing. On page 66, Bryson gives us some difficult grammar forms, regular/irregular alternatives that regularly flummox users (i.e., make a... bollix?). You know, 'dived' vs. 'dove,' 'sneaked' vs. 'snuck,' 'hove' vs. 'heaved'... those kinds of things. Wait, what? Did he say 'hove'? Have you ever heard any human being say that? Hmm. Such an error in isolation might not stick in your craw, but the book is really chockablock with 'em. I think the copy editor just stopped looking at the example lists by the 60th page or so, because on page 69, you get this huge list of supposedly 'redundant' phrases using 'and,' and it just ends with what is clearly a note from the draft margins: \\" 'pots and pans,' 'cease and desist,' 'rack and ruin', 'without let or hindrance,' 'to all intents and purposes,' 'various different.' VARIOUS DIFFERENT? Did anyone read this before it got sent to the printer? And since when are pots and pans the same thing? I mean, if I tell you to get me a pot, and you bring me a pan, I'm not gonna be able to make my damn pasta. But forgive me for being redundant.<br /><br />So listen, if you like playing 'boner,' and/or are primed to laff yer buns off at the fact that Chaucer and Browning used some really bad words, then this is the book for you. It may also claim that the word 'douchebag' appears twice in the King James Bible... I'm not sure, didn't really check... but the main thing is that writing is entertaining, right? BOOOOOOOOOOOOOONEERRRRRRR!!!!!
074356619X|5.0|I find these CD's inspiring to listen to, while I am doing housework!<br />Who says you can only do one thing at a time?
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Like all Adobe programs it works very well. Now if they would go back to providing support for Kindle with their flash player.
B00FSBW2L6|5.0|The Black Eagle Inn (The Three Nations Trilogy) by Christoph Fischer is another 5 star book from the author.<br /><br />I love the where this story takes place and The Black Eagle Inn, an old  restaurant and part of a family farm business is in a sleepy Bavarian town outside of Heimkirchen.  Anna Stockmann has fought hard to  keep it running through WWII. She is a hard woman and strong and very manipulative. All of the characters in this book are wonderful and fully developed and as this wonderful story moves along I became totally invested in each of their stories and their lives.<br /><br />Christoph Fischer manages to enthrall me in his books, where the culture is both different from any I know and filled with so much rich history. The pages turn themselves and as you get deeper into his very creative and marvelous story there will be many twists and turns to deal with.<br /><br />I would recommend the entire collection of The Three Nations Trilogy to everyone for a great experience with a wonderfully talented author.<br /><br />Christoph Fischer gets 5 stars for this captivating book
0151003084|5.0|It is delightfully macabre in both subject matter and presentation. Arrived in the mail very promptly and would recommend adding it to your collection if you appreciate detailed illustrations and and dark humor.
B000286S8S|4.0|If you are looking for Van Halen hits this album is for you.  There are three new songs but unless you are a big fan they are not enough to buy this album.  I wanted a few of the hits and liked a few other songs on the two disc set so I got more than I expected.
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|The master has given us another masterpiece. As great as anything he released in the seventies, recorded in secrecy, and released by surprise on his birthday David Bowie proves he can still surprise. He is a genre on to himself.
B005LAIGW8|1.0|I liked the first one of these movies but this was bad.  It lost me early on and I wound up giving up on the movie and giving it to Goodwill.
B00ARF92HK|4.0|Very enjoyable movie to watch!!  So much better than the first one with Stallone..<br />Has a nice dark feeling with it but not overly done.<br /><br />-Nigel
B007U1FEJE|4.0|This is a good album but certainly not up to Pet Sounds.  The intro isn't bad but it doesn't improve the album.  The title song is the best and only a couple other songs are near that good.  All in all a nice album and a must have if you are a Beach Boys fan.
B00GBCMW9S|5.0|After the last few CDs I think Eminem has gotten back to what made him great! I love this CD
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|candy crush is on of the best apps kindle as granted thank you...also should look into the pet rescue saga very cool..
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Just<br />started using it but impressed already!! One of the few I haven't deleted after a few tries..<br />Love I can add my own alarm music
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Excellent, At times I was too sleepy to read but could not put it down and fell asleep. It held my interest and attention at all times.Very well written. I can't wait to continue the next book.
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|Great album, worth the money. You should really buy it. All the songs are great and have a new sound.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I loved this book and I laughed second second of it. It rd a great well written book and I know you will enjoy it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|A great, fun game that makes you think. Warning though: can be highly addictive. But I think it's worth it. :)
B000GPIPT2|5.0|Finding this Frankenstein was a great plus for my husband.  He has been wanting it for a long time and it just happened to be the right price.  Once it was ordered it did not take any time at all to get it in the mail.  The movie was shipped out the next day and it only took about 4 days to receive it.  It made my husband very happy to watch it, thank you so much.  I would order through this site again.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|I love this app. Fills the whole screen of my tablet. Best weather app I ever had all worth it.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|Really good book if you like adventure books well , this is a very good book for you but yet very disturbing
B0067QPVJ6|5.0|great movie to add to my collection and great price;;I will be shopping for more movies to add to my collection''im happy;;
B0067TQQI8|3.0|This broke very soon after I purchased it.  The input for the charger simply snapped off and went inside the unit.  I can hear it rattling around in there.  Needless to say, the unit is rather worthless if it can't be charged.  I would not recommend this product.<br /><br />Update:  Anker honored the warranty after I sent the order number and a picture of the damaged port and returned the unit (postage paid).  Their customer service was impressive.  I have received a replacement but it is too soon to comment on its quality (so far so good).  I have changed my review from one star to three.
B005LAIIN0|4.0|Great movie however I'm not sure the extra 6 minutes run time is worth buying the whole deluxe package. I really expected more zombie death action from an uncut version - this wasn't much different from the theatrical version.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|So far just using the free version. Easy to use and just what I've needed to organize all my &quot;stuff.&quot;
030758836X|1.0|When I initially picked up this book, I was more engrossed in it than any book I've read in a long time. Couldn't put it down. But as other reviewers have said - the ending was a total letdown! It was as if the author couldn't figure out what turn the plot should take, so she just wrapped it up as quickly as possible. Very disappointing. I should've known, considering she misuses the word \\"literal\\" throughout the book. I almost put it down several times just based on that (and the characters are writers, so there isn't any reason why they would have such a fundamental misunderstanding of the English language). I wish I hadn't picked up this book.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Excellent quick look at conditions first thing in the morning. Just looking at the background gives you a real time snapshot of the weather. Much needed tool at 5:00 a.m.
B00AEBBAEK|5.0|I love the movie and love Johnny Depp!  This was a gift for my son's birthday and he has watched it several times in the past week.
B002QH2NUA|5.0|Paul at his best.  A ton of great songs, a great setting to do them in, really a super enjoyable concert.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is a must read. It is a unique love story. I feel like I know hazel Grace . I feel like this book is real.
B00B5C0YOO|4.0|Does what it says that it will do.<br /><br />AppMonster Pro is very useful for backing up apk files. Although you can always get the latest and greatest from Amazon's or Google's 'cloud', it is nice to have your own local copy.  Especially useful to go to a previous version for an app (perhaps the new update does not work well) or to re-populate your entire phone worth of apps (how often have you switched phones).<br /><br />The interface is easy to use and responsive. Information included is useful.<br /><br />It would be wonderful if AppMonster could also back up data. Android makes it hard for these apps to readily share data on un-rooted phones.  AppMonster does not claim that they backup your data.<br /><br />What AppMonster does it does nicely. I have no issues with this program.<br /><br />Running this on a Galaxy S4.  I am NOT rooted.<br /><br />I find this app useful enough that I will keep it, and am very much looking forward to future improvements.
0812993357|5.0|I don't often read memoirs because I'm not exactly too interested in other people's real lives (which is why I more often turn to fiction).<br /><br />But I must say Grace Coddington swept me off my feet.<br /><br />I don't agree with some of the other reviewers that her writing is poor and uninteresting. Sure, it's not the most sophisticated language I've ever read, but it's not supposed to be a dissertation but an encapsulation of the others' voice, which I think was captured perfectly.<br /><br />At first I wasn't sure if her life was fit for a memoir but it definitely was. Grace Coddington is an amazing character and this book just proves that her life is worthy of being put in writing. It's entertaining, fast-paced and focused on the magazine world but anyone who picks up a copy knows that her profession dictates her life story (or anyone who has watched \\"The September Issue\\"- I highly recommend it).<br /><br />Don't buy this book if you're looking for a dry historical artifact like most other memoirs because you won't find it here. This memoir has a vivacious life of its owned that's contained within it but it certainly isn't a historical transcript of Grace Coddington. It's an entertaining and easy read, in a good way.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Can't do anything with it when you are in the Philippines. Bought this so I can show the chrome browser on the TV from my Android phone but even that wont work. Can't stream existing media. Can only be used as a youtube viewer. Very disappointed.
B00E3IZIM0|5.0|Love the movie. This is a movie that was poorly advertised.<br /><br />When I saw the trailer, I looked at it and was like this is going to be crap, I was wrong. Extremely wrong. Turned out to be in my top 5 movies for this year so far.<br /><br />Great action, great 3D, great acting (from main characters) (some are average) great for a monster/robot movie. Puts transformers to shame.<br /><br />Hope for a sequel.
B00136LZOK|5.0|This four disk compilation has every song I ever liked by Luther. Even when he sung in the group Change.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|A great box set with great art<br />One for the fans.<br />Love the remastered into Bluray.<br />Don't like how the discs are in the cover though.
1250038820|5.0|If you are not a HONY website fan or FB follower, you should be! Brandon has taken a gentle and caring look at the beauty behind the many faces of New York by including interesting quotes from them.  HONY humanizes the images of a huge city through his gentle and successful approach.  I bought four!  Because I wanted to give them as gifts to people I know who appreciate the great variety and unique specialty of individuals if you just take the time to look past the initial glance.  LOVE this book!
B008RA3X5E|4.0|nice options on the clock displays and I like the added weather feature.  with more alarm sounds I would have given 5 stars.
B00AYB1TP0|5.0|very fun interactive game. My daughter enjoys this app and she likes doing the puzzles. I love that she gets to learn while having fun.
B00EQ0CKRQ|4.0|One of my complaint is that it doesn't sort car class when you're racing online. You could be racing a fast class C car with your class D. You know the fast one is going to win. They need to sort similar speed cars together.
B00EP22QKG|5.0|Great price, i bought two.  First album Joan has released in a long time and I love it. My mom is going to love her copy when she gets it for Christmas!
B0044RUSZM|5.0|This is a great product, very stable and easy to assemble out the box. Nice colors that complement the Macbook pro laptop. A great addition to the workspace! The material they used keeps the laptop in place and it doesn't slide around. I reccomend this product to anyone looking for a laptop stand.
B005VPRG10|5.0|Bamm son to the tune of two twenty two and then one son mom dada son father mother sister uncle aunt cousin nephew niece.
B002LC8HF0|5.0|This was a phenomenal conclusion to this series. I had a hard time putting this book down. It really tied everything together very, very well with several surprise twists too.
B00DQC2FPM|5.0|Bamm son to the tune of two twenty two and then one son mom dada son father mother sister uncle aunt cousin nephew niece.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Things ChromeCast is really good!  I plan on bringing it on my travels to Southeast Asia as there aren't many English channels.  Love it for the documentaries.
B00005JPD0|4.0|We weren't sure what to expect when we started watching this.  It turned out to be a pretty good movie.  Interesting plot with interesting twists.  Although the very end didn't seem plausible at all.  But I would watch it again.  Maybe it'll make more sense, the more you watch it.  Who knows.  I did like it and I would recommend it.
B002P5XXR0|3.0|This CD was not what I thought it was going to be.  But the seller did a great job getting it to me.  The CD and cover was in great shape.
B00005RDRO|5.0|We have always loved this movie.  It is absolutely hilarious.  We've seen it several times and we'll watch many more times too.  We both definitely recommend this movie.
B00FWLSLJ4|4.0|Somewhat predictable, but still entertaining.  Like a Godzilla movie on steroids.  The monsters are cool, but at times the beatings they and the robots take but still function are a bit far fetched, but then again...it is a giant robot/monster movie.
B00AZMFJYA|3.0|As a movie, by itself, it's ok.  But I feel the Star Trek line of movies (as well as tv series), has long since peaked and ran it's course.  Sadly, they continue to try to revive it hoping to make more money off it.  The movie industry needs to give it up and start writing their own new stuff instead of trying to feed off of someone else's successes (like endless sequels or remakes).  It really shows the true lack of talent in the industry today.
B005HSG3TC|3.0|it makes a heavy, clunky product heavier and clunkier... get an ipad or shop for a different cover. But, it does work as advertised.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This app is great for sleeping. The variety allows you to match your mood. And the sound has good quality.
0763660531|5.0|Amazing Illustrations. My four year old daughter loves to read this one to me (no words), and I love to read to her. I try to point out something different every time, which is not difficult with the amazingly intricate drawings. Also shows a little girl that is very brave, and virtuous. Polar opposite of books like Pinkalicious. Very cool book - a must own.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|Am enjoying using this app to learn Spanish. Love the lessons' format and length. It's easy to squeeze in a quick lesson when you have a few minutes to fill.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So nice to have candy crush on my Kindle! Love it! I can now play it on something bigger than my phone but not have to sit at the computer.
B009KUWWW0|5.0|The whole series is a must read.  Follettt is one of my favorite authors.  It's hard to put down and the characters are memorable.  This is the 2nd book in this 2-book series.
B0035QUXWQ|5.0|We have seen this movie a bunch of times, and it still rocks! It is in our top ten list for sure!
B001UGB1X8|2.0|For a Tommy Lee Jones movie it was diappointing. He was good in the movie, it was just slow. If this was a book the book was probably better it wasn't translated into a movie very well.
B00ANYJ3NI|5.0|Michael Lewis keeps you on the edge of your seat It is very hard to put down, and you constantly have to ask yourself, &#34;What were they thinking?&#34; Even some of the most complex financial instruments are explained in a way that the average person can, mostly, understand. This book adds color to the late 2000.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is fun and somewhat addicting. It is a good thing you only get a limited number of lives. It kind of forces you to take a break or spend money. Hopefully the former.
1250038820|5.0|This pictures are beautiful and the blurbs that go with them evoke a range of emotional responses. This book is very well done and proves that the most interesting people are out there, and we are them.
0525478817|5.0|One of the best books  I have read, Very emotional. I would definitely recommend it to any reader. Just be ready for a lot of emotion.
B008J05EL8|1.0|Downloaded ok took my money ok. But it does not do a thing will not open will not do anything but take your money.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great story line that allows you to peak into a very transitional time for society ... we really enjoyed the journey into history!
B00BPDR3F6|3.0|Lessons in botany? History of scientific development? Travel log? A Philadelphia Family story? A woman's epic life journey? Insights into the psyche & sexual desires of a spinster? What was this book?
B00CL0J99K|5.0|In my opinion, the best of the 3 Iron Man movies.<br />A little darker, but still the same RDJ that we all love!
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|Loved this book!! It was moving, honest, and beautifully written.  The story is sweet and you connect with the characters.  A wonderful read!
B00FEHXISA|3.0|a lot of the same ... 2 was my favorite ... Mickey was great! ... Avengers was very good ... this just didn't stack up
B000PKG7I4|5.0|Wow; this is the best collection of Amy's music yet.  More jazz and blues than the other albums,  Reminiscent of Billie Holiday.  I find myself playing this one over and over.  What a true talent she was.  Gone way too soon....Miss you Amy
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I'm from Montana and now living in Florida but this game gives me that feeling of back home hunting. Large game, great choices of firearms and exhilarating challenges. Great game.
B0049VVE7Y|1.0|This was utterly boring, dull, uninteresting and time I will never get back. I wouldn't recommend this show to anyone.
B00DWOUY3Y|5.0|An excellent collection of Saturday matinee broadcasts from the Metropolitan Opera. We can complain that a few &#34;historical&#34; performances were not included and question one selection in particular because there exists a fine commercial studio performance of the work featuring mostly the same cast .... but if you love Verdi and treasure great singing, this is an album you should purchase immediately while it's still available.
B00BB3UYS8|5.0|I love mystical books like this. This book reminded me of the magic of life. There is so much more to everything than we can perceive. This is a recommended read for those interested in supernatural books, powers, meditation etc.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This was an amazing book which makes you consider what you would do if you faced the same prognosis.Not wanting to be a burden and losing my independence is something which would make me come to same decision.
B005LAIIMG|3.0|Disappointing.  I now understand why it was removed from theaters so quickly.  I purchased an advance copy of the DVD.  Why?  Easy money for Pitt.
0812983459|5.0|Interesting characters all with their own stories.Twist at the end was unexpected.<br />Does pull at the heartstrings.Ordinary people living their lives
B00E3VTR1K|5.0|I truly enjoyed the writing style of the author. Interesting and highly unique stories stretched my imagination and left me wanting more. I highly recommend these writings and hope to read more in the future.
B00EDOS6IC|4.0|Really strong set of songs - probably not the equal of 'Blackbird' but there does seem to be an issue with the mix/dynamic range : it's just far too thin and scratchy -particularly at volume. It's a shame because the music is excellent.
B003O86FMW|5.0|best book the more and more I reading it I really think all you hunger games fan should read this book.
B00DQAM5LI|5.0|Old -school, brilliantly produced metal record. Anyone who doesn't like 'Hail To The King' is simply envious of how well it will do. It is a very similar record to Metallica's ' Black' record `: monster production/ great tunes and tons of hooks - surely the aim.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love minion rush. It keeps me entertained when I am board. It's fun and challenging at the same time.
B00C7O8MJ8|5.0|This was a gift and My Friend absolutely Loved it! If you are a Sound track Fan you can't go wrong with this one!

B00574P9EQ|5.0|Super cute movie.  My daughter has watched it over and over.  I even enjoy watching it with her.  We have also enjoyed the other DOAWK movies.
B00GBCMW9S|5.0|The passion and intensity of eminem's lyrics are as strong as ever. It's truly amazing the talent he possess. He is a perfect example of phenomenal.
B004IYISSK|5.0|Great book and have recommended to severral people.  Good story and easy to read.  Was very sad in parts and broke my heart that people lived in such harsh conditions.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|Everyone needs to read this book. If I had the money, I'd give it as Christmas presents to everyone I know. If you're an introvert, it will give you insights into yourself that are invaluable, and as strange as it sounds, it will give you permission to be who you really are. If you're an extrovert, it will give you a great understanding of as much as half the people you interact with. How valuable is that?! Read it. And live a richer life.
B001VFTYW8|5.0|Love to read her books!! I have read everrything that she has written thus far and am waiting for the next book to come out!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I have read every one of John Grisham's books and he certainly doesn't disappoint!  As usual, I didn't want to put this book down and enjoyed this story immensely!
B005OT2YVA|5.0|This was a gift for one of my grandsons.  He loved it and wants to watch it again. We will watch it again.
B00AJCTY8S|5.0|Great debut record...good songwriting, impressive vocals, nice harmonies...really nice job all around. Suggest seeing them live they have a great...really big sound...
B0083P1QUM|5.0|I have read all of her books and will continue to do so as long as she keeps writing.  I cant wait till her next book comes out.
B009LDCXNY|5.0|The series just gets better and better - I love that the aren't afraid to laugh at themselves and that they throw in some laughs.
B005FHXB0O|4.0|Oh boy, Quentin really did well with this movie.  It is truly a fast movie with this couple taking on one bizarre situation after another as they handle with the resources at hand.  Impressive.
B00119ZMKW|5.0|Great series, decent stories and just enough twists to keep it interesting, although sometimes the desire for one liners gets to be a bit much.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|A nice continuation of Lion's Game.  As always, Nelson DeMille pens a great fact based fiction story.  Cory never slows down.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is just a great little game! A friend recommended it and I am glad I got it! You cant beat free either.
B005OCFGTO|4.0|My granddaughter had this collection on her Christmas gift list last year and she was very happy to receive it.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This thing is so simple , a cave man can do it. And for under $50 bucks, what more could you saw ask for. :)
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I loved this book.  It was down to earth and felt real rather than like the author was taking over you.  The exercises were easy and were enough to crack open the door to possibility.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I wish you could play as long as you want. frustrated that you only have so many chances to beat a level. fin game to pass the time
B008OJ291W|5.0|Good quality recording. Has all of their hits. Has provided many hours of listening enjoyment for me and family and friends
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a book that's hard to put down once you get into the story. It's actually not too hard to imagine a world so easily enslaved and persecuted. The author does a great job telling the story and keeping your interest, throughout the book. What I might hate about the book is hard to say, maybe some of the characters and their plight in the story. It's a book that anyone young and old should read that like gladiators, modern hand to hand combat, and warfare.
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|I have always liked Eminem, this CD though is very different from the others. I love it. It's a great CD.
B00F8KIJ2I|3.0|WELL I BOUGHT THE TARGET EDITION OF THIS ALBUM WITH ROCK N ROLL ACOUSTIC AND ITS AWSOME.<br />I EXPECTED MORE FROM THIS 5TH ALBUM BEING AVRIL LAVIGNES BEST BUT HALF OF THE ALBUM HAS TOO MANY SLOW SONGS.<br />THIS ALBUM NEEDED MORE FAST SONGS AND GOOD ONES LIKE ROCK N ROLL AND 17. HERES TO NEVER GROWING UP AND LET ME GO WITH HER HUSBAND CHAD ARE AWSOME ALSO. THIS CD NEEDED MORE FUN CATCHY AWSOME SONGS ESPECIALLY SINCE LA REID HER 1 PRODUCER WAS IN IT TOO JUST THE FIRST FEW SONGS START GOOD AND THEN THE REST OF THE ALBUM GETS BORING SORRY AVRIL HOPEFULLY THE 6 ONE WONT HAVE TOO MUCH BALLADS LIKE THIS ONE AND GOODBYE LULLYBYE MAKE MORE FUN SONGS AND LESS BALADS AND ULL HAVE A OUTSTANDING ALBUM
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game graphics and all it is amazing I would recommend it to all ages really ties in with the movies mostly 2nd

B00EMAGCJM|4.0|The songs where Miley sings, I absolutely love.  The songs where she raps, I really do not like.  If I knew she was into rapping, I probably would not have purchased it.  She has a wonderful voice and I think when she gets older her music/singing will be fantastic.

B00EEPFRGE|5.0|I'll never forget the first time I heard Stryper. I believe it was 1984, and it was in my High School library. My friend had a Vinyl copy of the Yellow & Black Attack and he put it on the turn table in the media room. Hearing Loud and Clear for the first time blew me away. Similarly, when I heard the first track of NMHTP I had the exact same feeling. Revelation blew me away. You can tell that this record was written, recorded and produced by a new, revitalized Stryper. The band has not only matured, and developed as musicians and performers, but it is obvious that this time around they have put everything they've got into this. Just like Elvis made his \\"come back\\" in 1968, this is Stryper's comeback album.<br /><br />The band has been through a lot. But it is now obvious that their trials and tribulations have proven to make them stronger. This record is the long lost follow-up to THWTD. Musically, it feels like the perfect fusion of THWTD and ATL. This one has it all. Each track is a hit, and there's plenty of variety, something for everyone. There is simply no bad song. The writing is strong, lyrically, the message of each song is simple and clear, but their faith and maturity shines through. Michael, your voice is unbelievable, and your guitars impeccable. Thanks for bringing the original RR V back. The bass and drums sound amazing. Tim Gaines finally gets the showcasing that he's always missed but comes highly deserved. You guys did everything right this time. You nailed this.<br /><br />I'll never forget seeing the band live in 1985. They had a fire about them that you didn't see in other bands. When they broke up in 1992 I depressed. The reunion of the early 2000's and subsequent Reborn record provided some hope, as well as an updated sound, but this record proves that the Stryper of the 80's is back. How many 80's metal bands can say they are back with the full original line-up?<br /><br />I guess what I'm trying to say is, I'm totally blown away. This record will kick your ass and rip your face off...and after every song, you'll be asking, \\"May I have another?\\" Stryper is back.will kick your ass and rip your face off...and after every song, you'll be asking, \\"May I have another?\\" Stryper is back.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This was great from start to finish. I loved there relationship. It was just so good I can't describe it. But what happens to hazel!?

B005544TRQ|4.0|I like the character development.  Harvey is so arrogant but there is a softer side of him that appears occasionally.  Fast paced.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I chose this rating because it is a good book and it is a wonderful piece of art and literature in life. Everyone should read it. I think the Twilight Saga is better than the Hunger Games because it has alot more description
B007V2UGPE|4.0|It's a good game to pass by the time. They should lower the coins and stuff for in-game upgrades. But other then that it is a better game than most.

0525478817|2.0|Cancer patient Hazel Lancaster has been treated for cancer for as long as she can remember. She attends a support group where she dutifully shows up. Then she meets Augustus Waters. Gus also had cancer and he loves Hazel for who she really is. In this story, two terminal cancer patients fall in love and face important life questions like where we go when we die and how we can enjoy life while we are still able. As Hazel puts it, “I cannot tell you how grateful I am for our little infinity…You gave me a forever within my numbered days (Green 215).”<br /> This book did have some good themes, but overall it was remarkably unsatisfactory. The title, “A Fault in Our Stars,” gave some insight into cancer in today’s society. It plays off the theme established in Romeo and Juliet. When the stars are crossed, nothing good will come out of it. Green also did a good job addressing major questions that teens have in regard to death and dying.  These questions include where we go when we die, what people remember about us, and the impact we have on the world. Ultimately, we will never be remembered, even if we want to be. Gus found this to be true. I have read many fiction books and novels; however, this does not qualify as a well written book. It uses casual language which people use every day, making it harder to read because we all hear these wearisome, unexciting words often. It also uses a lot of swearing. Swearing can be good in some cases to characterize someone or illustrate a point, but Green uses too much of it for no reason. Another major dilemma I have is the fact that no one in real life would act the way Gus and Hazel do. What teenager is going to be totally obsessed with a weird book, meet the love of his or her life at a support group and fly half way across the world with them to visit a drunken author? Obviously, Green’s plot is not realistic.<br /> Though this book has some good themes and ideas to demonstrate, it is severely lacking in skillfulwriting, language choice, and probable plot events. So I would say that although this book might have some relevant topics, pick something else on the shelf. You can do a lot better.
B00CNQ7CRI|5.0|I love this book! It was worth the wait! It ended up with a sweet ending. Some chapters were nerve wrecking! But I love how the book deals with real life scenarios to which I can relate! Especially with her two darling Darcy's :) A must BUY!
B002ITWSUQ|4.0|Really cute film! Great cast and zany plot. Awesome showing by Peter Dinklage! Love him! Also an interesting character by Reese Witherspoon. Wasn't expecting so many stars! Makes for a fun afternoon watching. :)

B000O75GKI|3.0|I Thought The Item Was Good For The Price, But Not Sure After Watching It. In MY Opinion, I Didn't Think The Quality Was Blu-Ray Quality And There Was A Brief Part In The Movie Where The Sound Didn't Match Up With The Character's  Lips. Just Strange.
B009ZAY8MM|4.0|Great, amazing album.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because after seeing the proliferation of all of their videos on YouTube, I was kind of let down that there were only 6 songs on the album.

B00BRUQ3PS|3.0|The third book in the Oryx and Crake saga is better than the second book in the series, but ultimately still falls well short of the original novel.

1589949811|5.0|This is an excellent card game that belongs to the collection of any enthusiast of this genre. As redundant as it sounds, if you enjoy Tolkien's work, you will love this title. There are a lot of in-depths reviews so I'll just stick with my first impressions after a few solo quests.<br /><br />The pros:<br /><br />- The replay value is just phenomenal. It perfectly captures the randomness that card games in general have (and attracts us). Even using the starter decks against the same scenario, each play through will be unique. I can only imagine when I'm comfortable enough to start building my decks. You absolutely don't NEED to buy extra expansions to enjoy the, or to check if its a good fit. On the long run, obviously, they add a lot to its longevity<br />- The art work is what I came to expect from FFG. Simply amazing<br />- Atmosphere is great. You can really immerse yourself into a game session and completely lose track of time<br />- It can be played solo out of the box, no need for fan developed rules or any such thing<br />- The game is hard and almost brutal. You will die and fail, a lot<br /><br />The cons:<br /><br />- It's slightly complicated, but not much. I highly recommend taking a quick glance on the first part of the book (up the description of a turn) then watching a tutorial Youtube video. You will learn it much faster this way<br />- As it seems to be FFG tradition, most of the more powerful cards will have only a single copy in the box (while the max number of repeat cards per deck is 3). I personally despise this aspect of their games (specially since the only option available is to buy 2 extra entire core sets for a handful of cards)<br />- It's a well established game with around 400 dollars worth of expansions (plus money that you will need for sleeves/binders). If you really get into it, expect your bank account to complain<br /><br />In summary, if you like Tolkien and have some slight interest in card games, buy this one.
1451666179|5.0|If there were 10 stars, 20 stars, Hyperbole and a Half would get all my numbers, even if I had to count my fingers and toes several times.  This writer is an antidepressant; I left an O frabjous day review on Goodreads, and I'm a devotee of her blog.  I am completely and madly in love with Allie Brosh's work and convinced we are all the same as far as inward struggle.  I adore this book; will probably gift more than one person with Hyperbole and a Half - Allie Brosh - May your name be on a resplendent statue in the park, any park USA.

B00ECK21WO|5.0|First things first, the box set is wonderful! However, if you've bought releases from the King Crimson Collector's Club and paid for downloads from the band's site over the years, there isn't too much you don't already have here. If you haven't then your in for a real treat. The large chunk of the USA and Canada tour is here running from the end of April to July 1974. This is the last tour that the band would do until the next reformation in the early 1980's. The box also includes Red and USA albums in their new 2013 mixes. They're also included in high resolution in various mixes along with a few other shows on the dvd and blu rays. There's also the nice bells and whistles with booklets and such. Yep, it's a bit of money but it's well worth the purchase if you can afford it. Mine actually cost a bit more as I bought it from Burning Shed but it came with a t shirt.
B007ZGBZHE|2.0|Even for three bucks this book is a pass.  Ironically, if it was half as long it would be worth twice as much.  It seems the authors didn't know how to stop this story.  Too many sub plots going on and a corny ending to the main drama.

B003O86FMW|5.0|When each chapter ended I was hungry for more. I found it impossible to put down, and when it ended I bought  Mockingjay immediately so I could know what happens next. I am going to be very sad, and probably lost when the story ends.
B00AYB20KI|4.0|This movie isn't too bad.  The fact that the lead female is gorgeous certainly doesn't hurt anything.  A lot of horror and suspense movies are cheesy these days but this ones straight forward and enjoyable.

B003KVKQB4|5.0|CAUTION - this is a very political book review<br /><br />A tsunami devastates Southeast Asia, tragedy or opportunity?  Well, for the people the with money it was a party in the streets.  People who had lived on the beaches, made their livings on the beaches - for generations, were displaced.  Destitute.  But what a great chance to pay them off and build an all new resort!  The worse the news, the better the earning opportunity.<br /><br />It's all about the money; everything is about the money.<br /><br />This book really drove home the fact that MONEY IS EVERYTHING, and there are enough rich and greedy Americans who want more and more and more.  (I'm sure it expands beyond Americans but they are certainly huge culprits.)  There is no question that this book had a strong bias.  It has a strong philosophy and it drove the message home.  So though you could categorize this book as &#34;anti-right&#34;, it impacted me differently.  It left me anti-everything. I believe the right wants &#34;less government&#34; because they want to give business to the private sector because that benefits them financially in myriad ways.  (Rumsfeld made a KILLING off Tamiflu, even though he was supposed to have sold his shares due to conflict of interest when he was Secretary of Defense.)  I believe the left wants more government control, because THEY want to control the money and keep it in their hands.  But either way you look at it, the American left and right are MEANINGLESS.  What we fight about on Facebook means nothing.  It is something to keep us occupied while they amass all the wealth.<br /><br />On September 10, 2001 Rumsfeld gave a speech about the threat America faced.  A dangerous threat.  &#34;We know the adversary. We know the threat. And with the same firmness of purpose that any effort against a determined adversary demands, we must get at it and stay at it.&#34;  He was talking about the Pentagon.  And the bottom line was outsourcing to the private sector. And then we got bombed, and he went about his business while we were otherwise occupied.  Several years later, a company called Health Net's profits are soaring.  Know why?  They are treating Vets of the war for PTSD.  Record profits from the suffering of our vets due to outsourcing.<br /><br />Everybody complains about the media when there's a shooting or a major event, but we're all glued to our sets.  Guess what happens?  Ratings soar, profits improve.  Every tragedy brings more money.  New Orleans was a Godsend for the elite with the funds.  You couldn't ask for a better investment opportunity.<br /><br />And opportunities to take over abroad?  Let us at them.  You should read this book just to hear some of the things we did in Iraq.  What the contractors, sub-contractors, sub-contractors, sub-contractors jobs were.  There is so much money involved, we can't even fathom it.  And we sit here and cry about gun control and Obamacare and it's nothing more than a distraction.  As we bicker, the scales of income inequality are so far off balance, we may never recover.<br /><br />I'm not a conspiracy theorist, and I realize it probably sounds as if I am.  I know I have to filter the fanaticism of this author's point of view, but there is a LOT here that makes sense.  We are insignificant.  &#34;We the people&#34; are pawns on a chess board, and they could wipe us all off the board, and put a resort where we used to be, and not miss a beat.<br /><br />One of the most important books I've ever read, and though it certainly isn't easy reading, particularly for a conservative, I think everybody should read it.e got bombed, and he went about his business while we were otherwise occupied.

140006922X|5.0|Just finished reading this magisterial tome and found it to be highly engaging and thought-provoking. Not sure why some readers have deemed it tedious--I actually found Dr. Aslan's style to be very lively. Also, I fail to see why Dr. Aslan's Muslim faith should be an issue at all here. In Islam, Jesus Christ is a high-ranking and very highly respected prophet, and it is also rather insulting to insinuate that a Muslim cannot be a discerning scholar. Read the book, and agree or disagree as you see fit, but don't fall prey to preconceived notions.
0345479092|1.0|Sorry, but this book is dangerous to breastfeeding moms!! The author recommends to ignore basic hunger cues and put the baby on a schedule instead. The AAP states that crying is a LATE sign of hunger- babies should be nursed when they are mouthing/rooting, etc. They should also not be made to wait! Having nursed 2 babies successfully, I know that it is very normal for breastfed babies to wake up at night and need to nurse, all the way up until 1 year or older! Prolactin levels, the nursing hormone, is highest from midnight to 3 am, so it's completely normal for a baby to want to nurse at this time. In fact, going more than 6 hours at night can severely decrease your milk supply. I'm all for babies sleeping through the night when they are ready, but putting them on a &quot;schedule&quot; while nursing and not nursing when they are hungry is not good for breastfeeding moms. The ONLY way a baby can increase it's mother's milk supply is by nursing more frequently (basic nursing science- more frequent emptying of breasts= more milk production!). Sorry, not going to recommend this book ever!
0141394811|4.0|I thought quite a bit about what I would say.  Critiquing someone's autobiography is critiquing someone's assessment of their own life, and that hardly seems fair.  Still, we're being asked to plunk down some cash to read it, so I'll try to be as objective as I can.<br /><br />This is unusually written in the present tense, and I quickly grew to enjoy it.  It made me feel as if I were along for the ride and living the experiences with Morrissey.  However, things would often veer off (as life itself tends to do) and conversations or situations would pop up seemingly out of nowhere and I'd be left going backwards in the book to see what I had missed.  Still, I enjoyed Morrissey's style.<br /><br />Without judging the man, let me say this: Readers who say that there wasn't enough content devoted to The Smiths have a valid point.  It's not that this period was ignored, and it accounts for around 10 percent of Morrissey's life thus far so Morrissey may have thought it didn't deserve a huge percentage of the book.  But, like other fans, I felt that this period didn't deliver as much about his experiences with The Smiths as I would have liked.  I recognize that Morrissey has license to choose how to tell his own story, but that was what I was most anticipating and found myself feeling a bit short-changed.<br /><br />However, a considerable amount of time was spent discussing the lawsuit between Moz and Mike Joyce, which was clearly a painful recollection.  I, for one, found it enlightening to hear his side of the story.  And this helped me understand why a Smiths reunion will never happen.  People may say mean things about Moz because of his unwillingness to reunite, but when seeing his perspective on what happened, I can understand why he feels like he has given them enough.  Yes, it's the fans who suffer (and I'm one of them), but I can understand why he just can't hand these guys another payday.<br /><br />To be fair, and this may be a cultural thing, but even in his autobiography, Morrissey seems surprisingly distant.  For someone who conquered the world with his heart on his sleeve, this rather surprised me.  But, more often than not, the reader will be given facts with a minimum of feelings.  Perhaps Moz feels like he says it all in his songs.  Given the events he described, a reader can see why he might be slow to trust anyone.  I don't know if everything in the book is 100% accurate, but if this was his reality as he saw it, he has every right to be suspicious of the world.<br /><br />In short (although it's probably too late for that), some people will find Moz to be rather judgmental and aloof.  Others will see someone who has paid a dear price for success.<br /><br />So, I would recommend it, but don't expect to get everything you might want from it.  You'll walk away with a better understanding of Moz, for better or worse.

B0030DBGXY|5.0|This is a monster of a knife. I have a growing collection and this is the most serious knife I have. The blade comes razor sharp and it is so think, it is scary. I saw the specs of the knife online at the time of the purchase but when I received it, I was shocked by the quality and thickness of the blade. I am not huge fan of the handle material though. It looks too thin and plain for this kind of a knife.

I've since purchased the HSM 2 and 3 movies and they are fantastic as well, so much so that I've given the entire movie set as gifts to numerous little girls. The response is always the same, they love High School Musical. This is a Disney Production and appropriate for any age (no adult behavior (sex, smoking, drinking, swearing) is represented). The kids are cute as well as respectful and kind, and the songs are fun.
B00F91RYL8|1.0|Horrible... I'm glad that I only had to pay .99 to  see this movie. That's two hrs of my life I will never get back!
B00BPDR3F6|4.0|An interesting tale, reminiscent of some of the great female novelists of the 19th century, the book introduced some memorable characters and relationships that I won't soon forget.  The book did, however, have a strange sexual element that just never seemed to fit the characters or the tone of the rest of the story.  Otherwise, I greatly enjoyed the read.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It freezes up a little and it slows a  bit but otherwise it is very entertaining enjoy this game very much
B009NQKXYK|3.0|mind altering special effects. I wish there would have been a more cohesive story line. SURE, you can fill in lots of holes with your own take, but I would opt for a tighter story and script.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|This app is great is great!!  I've reviewed it in the past. I said before that I can't believe it's FREE. It's too good!<br />I'm glad it's free but you can pay infinitely more for considerably less.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Great book, thought it was going to be a &#34;chick book&#34; which would have been fine, and thought I knew the &#34;secret&#34; but wrong on both counts.  Excellent read
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|Solid charger that does what it says. Has a tight, secure fit in the cars outlet and offers quick charging for my iPhone when i need to use it as a gps while on a low battery. Would recommend this product to anyone looking for a car charger,

B00F8KIJ2I|4.0|This is more like a 3 1/2...it's not bad, for what it is...and better than I expected...I wanted to hate this record, to be honest...because she is a faker version of a genuine female powerpop rocker...but the hooks on the songs are pretty undeniable.  Katy Perry is much better in the same style, and so is P!nk...Cassadee Pope from Hey Monday (and now a Voice winner and incorporating some country elements into her songwriting)...is a MUCH better version of Avril (who really started out as country when walking into Arista and seeking a deal...but they molded her into a fake &#34;punk&#34; with the Matrix)...and in reality, Avril's sound is hybrid mix of bubblegum (a la Britney), powerpop and vulnerable singer/songwriter along the lines of Alanis Morissette, with little hints of darkness lurking ahead...NOT fullblown goth by any means, but traces of it, like working with Marilyn Manson??!!??!!<br /><br />This record is FAR from perfect...I'm not even a fan because I don't readily embrace what the public likes, as I choose not to be a follower...but I was curious because certain friends bought it, and it was sold out at a local Target, and reviews are mixed...so I checked out the samples...like I said, some rocker songs have undeniable powerpop hooks that are quite solid, (&#34;Rock & Roll&#34;), some ballads show her vulnerable side and show how pretty her voice can actually be (&#34;Hush Hush&#34;)...some songs are glaringly silly, but still kinda fun (such as the dubsteppy [!?!?!] &#34;Hello Kitty&#34;)...and this album does not feel like a throwaway either...just put some songs out as product and see if people buy it...nope.<br /><br />Avril does know what she is doing, and knows her audience...not me...and working with new husband Chad &#34;Froggy&#34; Kroeger just nails this home...as for me, Nickelback is one of THE worst bands ever, and his voice is up there with Michael Bolton bad (that duet was pretty unlistenable)...but I do admit, he knows the way around a pop hook, and so does Avril...this record is good for what it is, but I feel utterly uncomfortable around shameless, obvious, corporate pop and rock, which is what this record is...admit it...some bubblegum can be art, and some bubblegum can be radio bait...and that's what this is...it AIN'T art, that's for sure...sure ain't goth, which Avril on the cover is trying to be...nope!!  This is not album of the year...but for what it is, it doesn't suck...and ya know what??  Avril seems to channel all sides of her musical personality and songwriting here, more than on her other records combined...so that says something...she still sounds too much like Alanis and Cassadee Pope for comfort...her audience will eat this up...pop hook, and so does Avril...this record is good for what it is, but I feel utterly uncomfortable around shameless, obvious, corporate pop and rock, which is what this record is...admit it...some bubblegum can be art, and some bubblegum can be radio bait...and that's what this is...it AIN'T art, that's for sure...sure ain't goth, which Avril on the cover is trying to be...nope!!

B005K0HDGE|5.0|As a child of the 60's it was a joy to remember all the references of my childhood.  I also love the fantasy aspect of time travel and Stephen King is a master of telling a tale.  It didn't hurt that I happened to read this near the 50 year anniversary of the tragedy the narrator was trying to avert.  And then, I got a sweet love story to boot.  A joy to read....and weeks after, I still think about the characters and imagine myself traveling to a place where the past is obdurate.
B008EEBBIY|5.0|Great album by a great new band! I like the entire album. It is very relaxing, easy listening. Very talented group.

B00FEMJF6O|4.0|For example, when you click on the friends seal, it shows friend's that already playing.  If you touch the letter to invite, it reveals your entire friends list instead of populating it with the friend you clicked on.
B003EEMIV8|5.0|Kids will lose their mind with this radical truck.  It is sturdy and durable. Just don't sit or stand on it.  I gave it a good look over so I would be ready with all questions on how to work this new truck and I found any pieces that I Popped off were poppable and went right back on with ease.  Very durable and will withstand some serious trash trucking!
B00EEPFLHE|5.0|A brilliant and exciting listen and just does not get repetetive on repeat. Absolutely their finest work to date!! For me, the best album of the year!
078322947X|4.0|Hot on the heels of his success with \\"The Exorcist\\" (1973), William Friedkin decided to do a remake of the 1953 French film \\"The Wages of Fear\\". The project took years of preparation and almost a year to film, mostly in the jungles of the Dominican Republic. The production was so hampered by problems that just getting it shot was a huge accomplishment.<br /><br />Unfortunately \\"Sorcerer\\" was released one month after \\"Star Wars\\" in 1977 and it couldn't compete with the mass hysteria of that film, which signified the debut of blockbuster-oriented cinema and the demise of the New Hollywood movement that more or less started with \\"Bonnie and Clyde\\" in 1967.<br /><br />Aside from the competition of \\"Star Wars\\", there were two other factors that prevented \\"Sorcerer\\" from appealing to movie-goers at large: The first fifteen minutes featured foreign languages with English subtitles and North Americans were turned-off by what they thought was a foreign film. Secondly, the title was misleading. This was the next film by the maker of the popular \\"The Exorcist\\" and it was called \\"Sorcerer\\", but there's nothing conventionally supernatural about the film at all; it's a gritty adventure-suspense flick, not horror. (We'll look at why the film's called \\"Sorcerer\\" below).<br /><br />THE PLOT: Four men from around the world -- a Latin assassin, an Arab terrorist, a French extortionist and a New Jersey gangster -- are exiled in a poverty-stricken remote village in South American who's economy is reliant on an American oil company. After an explosion at the oil well, the company enlists the four outcasts to transfer nitroglycerin to the well in order to put out the fire. It's a suicide mission because the nitro is unstable, the jungle terrain is rough and it's a 218 mile journey, but they're so desperate for the the high wages (of fear) they have no choice but to take it.<br /><br />\\"Apocalypse Now\\" was being shot when \\"Sorcerer\\" was released in '77 so it obviously didn't rip \\"Sorcerer\\" off, but there are similarities: Both films had long, expensive and troubled shoots deep in the jungle and their plots deal with long jungle journeys, the former takes place on a boat up a river and the latter on two trucks over wild frontier \\"roads\\". Also, coming from the same era and the same cinematic movement -- the aforementioned New Hollywood -- they have the same gritty, surreal feel.<br /><br />\\"Apocalypse Now\\" is the superior film only because it focused on character development and was more epic in nature. The main problem with \\"Sorcerer\\" is that the first act establishes the four main characters as criminal dirtbags and so it's hard to care about them later on. The fact that you do start to root for the gangster, the extortionist and the Arab is testimony to the film's quality. These are desperate men forced into a extremely hazardous situation.<br /><br />The best part of the movie, of course, is the second half, which focuses on the long journey. It's rough & wild and hampered by one serious obstacle after another. How they got those two piece-of-junk trucks across that hanging rope/wood bridge I'll never know.<br /><br />The surreal score by Tangerine Dream is very effective in establishing the film's desperate ambiance.<br /><br />There's a funny scene in the second act where Roy Scheider's character gazes at a billboard in a saloon. It features a hot babe on the beach with a bottle of Coke, but that's the closest he's gonna get to either in that Latin s***hole.<br /><br />About the name of the movie, \\"Sorcerer\\" is actually the name of one of the two trucks, which is painted on the hood in French. But this only reflects the surface meaning. I used to interpret the deeper meaning as a reference to the miracle (or magic) that the men figuratively concoct in delivering the dynamite on a suicide mission. This interpretation is legitimate, but Friedkin said he actually named it \\"Sorcerer\\" in reference to the evil wizard of fate, which people supposedly have no control over. The grotesque idol-like face we see at the opening of the film and later along the jungle road presumably represents this sorcerer of fate.<br /><br />My wife objected to one aspect of the ending, but it ties into the whole \\"evil wizard of fate\\" theme, as well as the biblical \\"your sin shall find you out\\", \\"you reap what you sow\\" and \\"he who lives by the sword shall die by the sword\\".<br /><br />We all know the four men are allegorically in hell, is it possible that they're in literal hell or purgatory, at least Roy Scheider's character? After the car wreck some strange man appears and tells him, \\"They're gone.\\" As he stumbles away from the wreckage it's odd that the police don't see him. Did he die in the car wreck? Is he a ghost at this point?<br /><br />After his hellish experiences delivering the nitro he thinks he's free, but it's clear that his past has caught up with him. This could be an endless tormenting cycle (hell) or perhaps purgatorial in nature.<br /><br />Friedkin may insist that \\"Sorcerer\\" is a straight adventure thriller, but the supernatural undertones -- including the title -- point to a metaphysical interpretation. It may have been a subconscious thing.<br /><br />The film runs 121 minutes.<br /><br />GRADE: B+ve no control over.

B007A4SDCG|5.0|The motivational tools offered by the author are some of the most effective, and simple, I have found in the last 50 years.  That I started my quest with the teachings of Napoleon Hill should indicate the power of this book.

1623650003|4.0|I would love to be able to read this book in the original French because English doesn't have the nuance of how people relate to each other when they speak.  The use of the familiar versus the polite form tells you soooo much about the relationship between two people.  In France the use of the familiar and the exchange of first names is done only among good friends, sometimes not even between relatives.  Even among the 'greats' few are called by their first names such as \\"Le Grand Charles\\" (for Charles De Gaulle) or Napoleon (for Napoleon Bonaparte).  Great writers are always referred to as Proust, Zola and Sartre.  So I know that part of the book is lost to us English speakers.<br /><br />I also wonder as to how much of the tension and uniqueness of this book is do to the writer Le Maitre or the translator Wynne.  Wynne should be singled out either way for his splendid translation, which seems to be seamless to the story.  But that also means that we don't know if Wynne managed to 'clear up' parts of the book that might otherwise ruin its' flow.<br /><br />I won't go into any of the story except to say that the main character is Commandant Camille Verhoevan who is the head of a major crime squad that deals with murders in both Paris/Ile de la Cite and related crimes nationwide.  Verhoevan is a man of distinction who is considered a 'Maigret' of his generation.  In many ways this book parallels Fred Vargas' \\"Adamsberg\\" series, in that it is populated by all sorts of oddballs.  Verhoevan, who could be described as a midget (he's 4'11\\" due to his mother's heavy smoking during her pregnancy) also parallels Cara Black's secondary character of Rene Friant, who is a brilliant dwarf who has also learned how to overcome his stature.<br /><br />Like any great 'Noir' character, Verhoevan is a tortured soul.  Not because of his height, but because his pregnant wife had been kidnapped and was later found murdered after which he sank into depression so deep he had to be hospitalized.  The case of Alex, which is a kidnapping, is the first time he has had to face spectre of his wife's death since coming back to work.  The story, which is really a couple of novellas and a novelette, are too complicated and interwoven to describe without ruining the book.  Just say that it's a great work and go read it for yourself.<br /><br />Zeb Kantrowitz
B009YP9L7U|5.0|A cute book.  It was a light easy to read story line.  The author made you like all the characters.
B008JFUO72|5.0|Another great Iron Man movie.  If you love the series this movie will not disappoint.  We saw the movie at the theater and thought it was good enough to add to our collection of action films.

B009GX69RK|5.0|I love this show, and I am surprised I do. I watched the pilot when the show came out, and I thought it was stupid. However, I cancelled my cable when I was having money issues a few years back and don't really miss tv. I did invest in a subscription of Netflix. I began watching New Girl and thought it was hysterical. Jess reminds me of Lucy. She gets into jams by herself and with her roommates. It's not realistic at all, but it's not meant to be. It's just a funny show. Netflix only had the first season, so I used my Amazon Prime account and bought the second season and have it in the cloud. I watched it on my Kindle.
0385537131|5.0|Another AWESOME John Grisham novel!  He is an amazing writer and makes me want to work in a legal office!
0679720200|5.0|One can feel that Camus wanted to, more than any thing else, lay out and argue ethical questions in this novel. The bad tendency for a fiction to aim this is for the book to come out as didactic. What's remarkable is it did not came out this way in any of the pages. He still relayed a good story, with drama, good characters, and tension in it.<br /><br />I've read this in a 6-hour flight, and, as I was disembarking, questioned myself afterwards if there's any meaning to the daily slog, and if that tiring trip and upcoming discussion that I need to prepare for are really needed. Any book that can bring this out in a person is a must read.<br /><br />The Stranger a superb exposition of the absurdities of life. And in a compact and clear form that you can finish in one sitting, at that! What more can a reader ask for?
B00FEJHPRI|4.0|Cant take my eyes of off the screen. Robert and miss Paltro r on screen together. The tension is very real and energize
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Beautiful.  Clever.  Sophisticated.  Wonderful atmosphere.  I couldn't believe that there would be so much variety and interest in just figuring out how to open a bunch of boxes.  Absolutely absorbing.  Just one small quibble.  It seems to me that it would be better to place the hint button more out of the way -- maybe in the inventory slot.  I was pushing around the screen and twice got a hint I wasn't looking for.  The hints are just helpful not real spoilers but still better without getting by accident.  The 3-D.  Effects are amazing.  There is so much pleasure when you figure out something yet the tricks and puzzles are not impossible.  So goodly
B00004R7TP|5.0|I love this Cd I also have the original Hounds of Love cd but this one has some 12&#34; that I really love such as Running Up That Hill and The Big Sky and there are some songs that I don't have that are on this CD.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The hunger games was a page turning story showing the worst of human traits and the best. Katniss is not your usual heroine who always knows the right thing to do, but struggles through horrific situations to the best of her ability, trying to protect her family and friends without getting herself killed. There are heavy topics addressed in this series. War and the lines that are often crossed in the name of freedom, is a recurring theme. The lines between right and wrong are often blurred in this imaginary world much as we deal with in the real world today. The author did a terrific job of painting this war torn country with the excesses of the Capitol and the poverty of the districts. It's definitely an entertaining adventure to get caught up in.
B00443D4E8|5.0|This is a great version of Hounds of Love.  I do like some 12&#34; songs.  I have recently started to collect Kate Bush's vinyl records.  This is the third one I have purchased so far.
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|It's really good. Great quality. I would recommend this for all my friends. Also good deal on the price. Good luck.

6304696566|5.0|Best western ever made.  John Ford and John Wayne together in both of their best works.  THe sotry line is great though it bends the truth of the era a bit...
B00712Y28Q|5.0|This is a pretty well designed product, and the first I'm I've ever gotten into buying a collectible toy.  The amount of poses you can make her do is crazy, and the box/packaging is great as well.  The figure looks slick, and doesn't come off as \\"cheap\\" at all to me.<br /><br />My only complaint is that getting the model poser into her back was a pain in the ass, and I read online that it's a common problem with some Figma models.  I read that you can sandpaper down it so it fits more, but I eventually was able to just force it in after a few minutes.  Be careful though that you don't go too hard.<br /><br />A very good buy, and she'll be on my desk for a long time to come.
B00GBCMW9S|5.0|MMLP2 might be the most focused, complexly detailed rap album in history.  As a b-boy and supporter of hip-hop for over 30 years I didn't develop this opinion haphazardly.  From beginning to end, each song displays great lyricism, rhymes within rhymes, specific references that only a true hip hopper will catch. Even the sound effects in Rap God and Groundhog Day are specific to the verse. He also touches on thoughts from MMLP in subtle ways that are overlooked by mainstream fans and media. Dare I suggest, this might even be better than its predecessor?  MMLP, had more emotion adoration because of its impact and it's incredibly hard for an artist to garner the same attention a decade later. But think about this, Dr. Dre was in his prime and was an awesome spring board for MMLP, this time around it's just Marshall. Every hip hop aficionado should relish and salute a masterpiece.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|It's entertaining, but getting long and monotonous, and becoming more difficult to remember some parts of the storyline from earlier volumes.  Reading all the volumes represents a significant investment of time, but I'm still reading.
B00E8S2JZ4|2.0|OK - most of the controversy surrounding this release is New Line Home Video's choice to go Blu-ray.  I'm starting to feel like a broken record, but Blu-ray WILL win the format war with HD DVD (aka LaserDisc) and I'm glad New Line made the right choice.<br /><br />As for the movie itself, I couldn't be more pleased that Peter Jackson decided to follow George Lucas' lead in introducing some modern-day silliness.  Jar Jar Binks has nothing on Radagast the Brown!  And there is no shortage of situations where there is plot-altering, certain doom for the little gang, only to be saved by wild luck!  I'd love to see Jackson take future installments even further in that direction with more baffling escapes and more goofball characters.  I mean, watching movies IS supposed to be fun, right?<br /><br />I recommend double featuring this with Neverending Story III.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|only reccomended for people that like hidden object land puzzle games. nice plot to keep things interesting. you don't have to pay to play, but it does take patience.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Probably my favorite Sci-Fi book outside of the classics (Heinlein, Asimov, and even Ender's Game). This guy did his research which is always appreciated so I don't have to &#34;suspend my disbelief&#34; and it's hilarious too! Highly recommend!
B0092SQ5EG|5.0|very enertaining,funny, it was nice to see the real katy perry  not just  she apears to be i would definitly watch it again
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I did not have either the extreme love or hate that others have mentioned about this third book.  I loved the series as a whole, and this completed it.  Thank you, Veronica, for the ongoing discussions in my family that initiated from the series.  Good stuff if you're willing to be vulnerable.
B000FCKC4C|4.0|Coehlo writes a wonderful parable.  One can read these stories over and over and always come away with a wonderful feeling of well being.  They just ring true to life.
B00008R9KF|5.0|I was really glad to find this because I remember loving it many years ago when it first came out, and I wanted my partner to experience it since he is younger. He agrees it is a great film. Nice to see Daniel Day-Lewis as a young actor, with his superb talent showing already even at that age.
B000NA2BEU|1.0|There are no closed captions with these, and closed captions are so nice to have.  So, even though we love Kristen Bell we haven't watched them that much.  There should be a notation in the advertisement telling us whether there are closed captions or not.
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|He's back, but maybe not in the way you would expect. For Eminem to call his latest album The MMLP2, well, quite frankly everyone is going to expect it to live up to its predecessor. In most songs, lyrically, it does just that. Em goes back to his roots and pulls no punches, remaining the center of controversy with his colorful lyrics we all know and love. However, old school Eminem isn't so old school anymore. The MMLP was released over 13 years ago and as amazing as it was, we have to realize that Eminem is a little bit mainstream these days. Though not over the top, I would have never expected a duo with Nate Ruess (.fun lead singer) Rihanna (since Recovery) and Kendrick Lamar. Even His 'Survival' music video is implemented with the new Call of Duty.<br /><br />All that being said, it was a great album and I can't wait for the next one. If you just can't seem to enjoy it and think Eminem is dead, you have to stop expecting the old Eminem. Its been well over a decade now since then and we have to keep moving on. He's progressing, but if you want his old style, buy his old album!

006202406X|2.0|I really enjoyed this book...until the end. I loved the series. I loved Tris and Tobias. I loved everything about these books. However, the way Veronica Roth chose to end this series was, in my opinion, extremely disappointing. I have read many series, none of which have ever ended this way. I finished the book feeling upset, angry, and quite frankly, unfulfilled.
B00CL0J99K|5.0|Besides of being a great movie, the bonus videos of the disc are great. It's highly recomendable to get this movie to add into your colection.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This thing is awesome. It is fast. It never lags while streaming videos, and the video quality is totally perfect. It runs 1080p without a problem.
B00D3Y1C8Y|4.0|This figure is really awesome, with amazing detail and paint work. The big disappointment however lies with the fact that I cannot get the figure to stay attached to the pegs on the stand. I don't think they are lined up correctly and while this is a small detail, it is annoying. Luckily the figure stays standing even without the stand, which is why I didn't give it too low of a rating.
B0089LOG02|3.0|Started out very good, interesting information about the &#34;orphan train,&#34; character development good, maintained interest in story but as story went along, (about three fourths of the way) became trite and predictable,
B008602KQI|2.0|Thin story line, high melodrama and a very abrupt ending.  A little unpredictability and/or character development would have been nice.
B004JMY312|5.0|Quickly if not already a Halloween classic. Kids love to watch it over and over...I enjoy the subtle adult humor as well.
0500512159|5.0|Perfect - exactly what I was looking for, for a 17 year old Grand Son, who is &#34;addicted&#34; to this style of Footwear. Cannot believe how much he knows about the history of these shoes. Great photography, covering so many favorite brands. Can't wait for him to open at Christmas.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|I would recommend this book to everyone .It is a great classic!Any Charles Dickens book would work .The book is in great detail,and varies a lot in the text.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game makes you look at objects from a whole different perspective. It's hard enough to make you really think without being so difficult that you get frustrated. The hints are vague enough that you still have to puzzle out the next step, but clear enough to nudge you in the right direction. I love how just when you think you've figured it all out you realize there's another level. I'm having a hard time putting my kindle down, I am dying to see how it ends!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a great app. I truly enjoy playing it. If you love the minions, you'll love this game. Great fun.
B007EC27QM|5.0|I have been using this app on my Kindle fire.  I really like it.  It's easy to use and I have had no problems whatsoever.  I recommend this app.
B000W7JWUA|4.0|Fun game if you have an hour to kill with some friends or family. Gets a bit repetitive after a few plays, even with expansions.
B008OOYALE|5.0|This is the best game I have ever downloaded this game is just so mind taking of how long you can spend on it I love how you are trying to get one dragon but instead you get one even better than the one you wanted  buy this game it is free and so as some that you can't put it down I rate 20 out of 5 on this game
B009CG1YZ8|5.0|One of my faves!!! Its Bruce Campbell... Need I say more?! Army of Darkness is pure genius. I love it!
B00F9040HU|4.0|Challenging. Concentration a must & strategy important.  Interesting concept, can be frustrating, not a relaxing game, but a good one.  Ter
B003VANOFY|4.0|The surround is AMAZING, it is an experience just to watch movie!<br />Also the sound is good to listen to mucis, but the bass aint the best...
B0013LKFVO|4.0|Good replacement bulb for your C or D cell light. Be sure to match the number of cells (batteries) with the number recommended for each bulb.
B00G9B1MEM|5.0|I've had this game on my phone for a long time and have been WAITING for it to be released for my kindle fire HD. The graphics on this game are amazing!! I highly recommend spending the 99&cent; and buying this game! You will be hooked immediately!
B0091QS88K|5.0|Great game daughter and I enjoy very much. Great job fun app and easy for little ones to use alone
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|A very fun and entertaining game. Lots of puzzles and hidden objects to solve during an interestingly scary adventure. Definitely recommend!
B00DGKQF2S|5.0|This album is great! I love the groves in every song. Richie's voice is a nice bluesy tone that goes great with the music.
B000KIRT6A|4.0|Extremely cheap price  but works just fine. Plastic case could be a problem in a working band. No extra noise is introduced
B005LLSZNM|5.0|I enjoy the struggle that the characters go through trying to stay alive all while maintaining some sense of humanity.  Jax's struggle to get the club into legitimate business ventures has proven difficult and I have enjoyed watching him develop the character into what he is in season 6.  Even though it is still not clear what direction the character will ultimately do with the Club I can bet it is going to be sad...
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is fun and addicting! Life Recharge could be faster but still a fun challenge to pass the time. No problems loading.
B002WY65VU|5.0|This is a great action/comedy.  There are a few dorky moments, imo, and some gory moments, but the dialogue is pretty great.
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|I am typing this out between having finished the Kindle edition in a single sitting and ordering a bajillion paper copies for everybody for Christmas.<br /><br />There are plenty of funny people on the internet, but few have something really valuable to say.<br /><br />There are plenty of smart people, but few manage to say their smart things in a way that doesn't take 532098 pages and is funny, straightforward and relatable.<br /><br />Allie Brosh is possibly the singular person occupying the intersection of both. A sage relating the wisdom of the ages in funny drawings and simple sentences, Allie is the girl I wish I met in my late teens to validate that I am not, in fact, a friggin weirdo and if I am, then of the most lovable kind.<br /><br />On top of that, she has the brutal honesty and utter disdain for convention of Sigmund Freud, saying unashamedly aloud what most people are too scared to even think to themselves, and to top it off, the looks of a supergigahyperomigoshbroshmodel.<br /><br />This book is likely to turn Allie from a nachos-eating bum into a nachos-eating millionaire. I'm contributing as much as I can just to see how that turns out.<br /><br />P.S. Marry me. Seriously, I mean it. I have fifty bottles of wine for the winter and a similar aversion to household maintenance. We can hire a maid or something. Europe is nice.<br /><br />Our babies will be smart, beautiful, AND clinically depressed. Tought to beat that.
B00708LBFS|5.0|I enjoyed the remaster and loved hearing the last disc with the progress they made while recording these songs back in the day.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|___candy crush saga.  the grand children love this. they play it while riding in the car.  and they fight to play it.
B008K8VDPU|3.0|You can play some song, and free style but its still an app that requires money for music length,  so you  need points that you pay for.
B003JH8LPW|5.0|This book reveals Snowden's motives and the reasons his detractors are so angry. This should be movie. I loved it.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|worked as i wanted.  still have several unaddressed issues with the kindle fire but thats not something for this forum.
B00EEPFLHE|5.0|This is EXACTLY WHAT I NEEDED! It ROCKS! Their best yet! Everyone needs to hear! Thank God for Stryper, still rocking and putting out uplifting METAL!
B001P9KR8U|5.0|This is a classic movie that all should have in their collection. I rate it as very very good. xxxxx
B00BSW29OE|5.0|Couldn't have asked for a better account of the survivors of that terrible day. Great work, and a good book for review.
B002ZB26AO|4.0|I did not realise the conditions in North Korea were so terrible. A real eye opener. A very informative book.
B00CNQ7CRI|5.0|Laughed, cried, and simply enjoyed myself throughout the whole book. I didn't want it to end...and hope to see more in the future.
B00G9U7NEQ|5.0|The level of detail in this movie is amazing; some scenes / shots in the movie look very realistic .
B0011UJMK2|4.0|This was a good read, but the setting in early communist Russia made it all the more intriguing.  Nicely done!
B0084AZXKK|5.0|Seems like I needed to refresh my memories about this great book. Still enjoyable at a very advanced age (73).
B00006D295|5.0|I love this movie soo much. I was so happy I found it for the price I paid.<br />The movie contained special features and bonuses I would not have expected from a 3 dollar dvd.
B00D48BT5A|5.0|Hugely interesting and entertaining, all strands (and there are many) very cleverly and amusingly plaited together for a great read.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|This was a refreshing positive message to young girls starting their careers.  It was motivating and inspirational in working toward a career and a family.
B004T4KQJS|5.0|Clear, compelling, and even humorous writing about a topic that -- even as the author leads you to understand it -- you can hardly believe the human mind can understand.  I am not a scientist, but I value science writing.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The wife and I did not think we would enjoy this show as much as we have. We are not horror/zombie fans, but the writing of the show, the actors, and the drama gets you interested and after a while you aren't really fazed by the zombie gore.
1416585710|5.0|Probably my favorite SK book. Very good story with many layers. I actually enjoy<br />the special words the couple shared that SK thought up. Very Creative, Not annoying<br />to me at all. Highly recommend this book. Well crafted and so creative!
B002N5N4M6|5.0|Being geeks and sci-fi/fantasy fans, the wife and I enjoy the humor of the Big Bang Theory and a lot of the &#34;in&#34; jokes, spoofs, cameos, and general chemistry among all the actors and the situations they get themselves into.
B0091REZMW|2.0|You tap on the objects  from the list but nothing happens and it seems as though you cannot get any further than the bathroom. Like with other hidden object games the items to find are always the same and the directions are not helpful
B000W91RUG|5.0|Being geeks and sci-fi/fantasy fans, the wife and I enjoy the humor of the Big Bang Theory and a lot of the &#34;in&#34; jokes, spoofs, cameos, and general chemistry among all the actors and the situations they get themselves into.
B004YOEFG8|5.0|Thought that it was wonderfully narrated and presented.  Really brings back memories to when I first purchased it when I watch it  almost 3 years later
B003L77G6A|5.0|Being geeks and sci-fi/fantasy fans, the wife and I enjoy the humor of the Big Bang Theory and a lot of the &#34;in&#34; jokes, spoofs, cameos, and general chemistry among all the actors and the situations they get themselves into.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|At first I thought I wouldn't like it, once I played, can't keep me off. I love candy crush, addicted I guess

B00BD99JMW|5.0|So sad but the best book ever I might read it again after I get over the sadness I just breathe in and breathe out
B001FB4VXU|5.0|Being geeks and sci-fi/fantasy fans, the wife and I enjoy the humor of the Big Bang Theory and a lot of the &#34;in&#34; jokes, spoofs, cameos, and general chemistry among all the actors and the situations they get themselves into.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|Love this app/game! Really enjoy puzzle games and this is one of my faves! Challenging but easy to pick up!
B00742GBDM|5.0|Jane Austen done right!  Frances O'Connor is wonderful as Austen's protagonist and Jonny Miller the boy who takes so long to realize how much he loves her.
B00992CF6W|4.0|This game is awesome I just wish it was just like real minecraft with infinite worlds and train tracks and Redstone besides that it is AwesOme.
B00CNQ7CRI|2.0|I identified with Bridget as a struggling mother but Mr. Darcy's absence was felt and it hurt the book and the character.  The ending, although happy, felt cramped and hurried.  Still fond of Bridget but<br />this was not my favorite book.  Maybe this was all a dream sequence and Mr. Darcy will return after being held prisoner?  Wishful thinking.
0802473156|5.0|The 5 Love Languages book was one of the books that we used in our premarital class. We enjoyed the book and it is the perfect engagement or wedding gift for us. As for me, I can finally put all the pieces together about my relationship after reading and applying the tools in 5 Love Languages. I have recommended the book to my friends, family and co- workers. We will be referring to this book throughout our marriage.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Easy read, at the same time the story kept me guessing. I felt it was a new twist on an old theme, and realistic from the standpoint of the women's various reactions. I recommend this book!
B00G25VQFA|5.0|Love, love, LOVE this record! I am SOOOOOOOOOO happy to have him back in my life! Thank you Jimmy B! :)
1423124111|3.0|I guess there was no misrepresentation but the book wasn't really up to my expectations. I was expecting all full page posters, and additional information with each one. Color is beautiful and there is no shortage of posters! It is a large, heavy, quality book.
B009CF7JDU|5.0|This is my favorite movie.  It reminds me of what is was like growing up in the 80's... a simpler time when your worries and responsibilities were few.  Matthew Broderick plays Ferris, a smart and mischievous teenager who takes the day off from school to hang with his best buddy Cameron (Alan Ruck) and girlfriend Simone (Mia Sara).  It is one of his last times to hang with his friends before going off to college and venturing into adulthood.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|Malala is such an inspiration. I read the book very quickly. She is a wonderful young lady and I believe she will go very far.
B008OOYALE|3.0|This is a fun game, but unless you want to use real cash to buy gold, it's very slow leveling.  My daughter really likes to play and hatch dinosaurs.
B00BSBR9N6|5.0|I did not know what to expect after reading the synopsis of the book. I'm so happy I read the sample and purchased this book. This book kept me guessing the whole time even with Don's rational thinking.  I read a review that was having trouble putting this book into a category and I agree that this book is so much more than one category. This book is Romance/Comedy/Suspense/Drama with a little science and morals thrown in for \\"fun\\". The awkward yet lovable main character makes you look for all the Dons that are out there.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I loved the movie as my son had told me that the movie was very good.  I look forward to the next movie
B00EEDJM2Q|4.0|An addictive challenge that keeps you thinking and can be played in minimal time.  Fits well in my busy schedule yet affording short diversions.
B00EBJ624O|5.0|This is more recollection than review, so take it for what it's worth.<br /><br />Several years ago, I heard Yuja Wang in concert with an excellent regional orchestra, the Rockford (IL) Symphony, playing the Prokofiev 2nd.  As is typical with young performers, she was cutting her teeth with orchestras in smaller cities with smaller budgets.  At the time I don't think she had made any commercial recordings (at least, I couldn't find any) and she may still have been in school.  I was amazed by what I heard, but at the same time was concerned, anticipating a rather tepid response by a small town audience to a work that has some challenges on first hearing.  I need not have worried.  The audience response was the most enthusiastic I had ever seen at a classical concert. She was called her back for three encores and the applause only seemed to get louder with each one.  Normally you would see a few people drifting out for intermission to be first in line at the wine bar, but not this time.  They were glued to their seats.  Finally coming back from the wings after the third encore, she bowed, walked to the piano and pulled the cover down over the keyboard as if to say &#34;That's all you're getting!&#34;  and walked off.<br /><br />My feelings for this recording are colored by the memory of that performance.  I have been waiting for it ever since and I am not disappointed.  My only issue is with the cover photograph.  She is a very attractive gal.  The dress and the makeup are waaaay over the top.  Some art director at DGG was out of control.  Totally unnecessary.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Wouldn't have missed a good read!  Loved being reunited with the characters again, and always amazed how Grisham can weave a tale without descriptive violence and sex.  Would love to see it on screen!
B00EVW0SA0|1.0|It would be really nice if Hollywood would label clearly each film with their political agenda so we could decide if we would like have it rammed down our throats ahead of time. The saving grace of this liberal and Obama supportive film is that it's so poorly made, no one can take the agenda seriously.<br /><br />Don't waste your time on this one. Even if you are Dem, you'll be embarassed to be one after you watch this trainwreck. Where have all the good filmakers gone? I'm not even asking for great, good would suffice. This one goes in the horrible and contrived catergory. Asking Amazon for my money back! Yuck!
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|Relevant today.  Current events at a personal level.  Cultural insights!<br />Understand the Taliban, and the persecution and oppression in Pakistan today.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|The way he details his stories creates such empathy for his characters. Absolutely beautiful story of so many entwined lives.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|It is so well done.. casting, visual graphics are so real, and story line is amazing with the over all mindset still very human..
B0013F1D02|5.0|Great film and great acting. I'm not big on magical movies, but this ones is very good. I would recommend to all that are seeking something a little different, yet good and entertaining.
0783225857|5.0|If I were to say Amazing, or awesome, or wonderful, or spectacular, or any number of positive superlatives they would fall short of aptly describing such a classic.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|love love love, had to order this because I am not ever home when the show is on. again love love love
B00355L2TU|5.0|I love 30 day shred! I have done all kinds of exercises....running, yoga, body pump, spinning, walking. None of them transformed my body like 30 day shred!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Since I did not watch the first movie and it got really good reviews I went out and bought all three books at once. Very good story if you like scifi. Although it has its dark moments it clearly has a good message.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|fun game. works well on the kindle. played on my phone first but it was hard to see on the smaller screen.
B00E3IZIM0|5.0|I'm not going to review the story or the originality of the movie as others have complained about.<br /><br />The movie is simply amazing to watch in 3D and is very entertaining. It's an fun sci-fi action movie that really takes advantage of your 3D television and engrosses you in the action.<br /><br />All in all 5/5.
B00FAIPDAE|4.0|A fun build and battle kind of a game, it takes a little getting used to especially because when yo fight in the campaign you lose all units used in combat and have to rebuild any defences you may and probably will lose in PvP combat. Over all it's a fun game and a good time killer.
B00BSBR9N6|4.0|Great read! Couldn't put it down, picked up this book on a whim and I'm so glad I did! The Rosie Project had great character diversity, the main character was my favorite :)
B004SKQAJI|5.0|I bought the DVD for mom & blu ray for me. As usual, I love it! I find it hard to believe Michael was over 50 in this performance! His feet sure still move fast. Yes, there is a little less dancing by him, but the quality of his dance is still A+. Wonderful also to see his leading lady Bernadette Flynn back. As mesmerizing as ever. Miss Gillian and Daire but the new cast was great! Love most of the new costumes and the set. My only complaint was that some of the video was a little too far back. Otherwise, great!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|From start to finish a fantastic read! I love the way the story is told through different eye witness accounts. Overall just an extremely well written book.
1444737112|5.0|Being a cat lover, I adore all those true stories about cats. Beside being adorable, Bob really had an positive impact on James's life and of course, James on Bob's. I know there is a second book after this one and I will get it. I watched all the videos on Youtube and it was fun to finally see them. There are no pictures in the paperback I bought unfortunately.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I LOVED the other 2. I couldn't put them down but I found myself struggling with this one. It didn't keep my interest and did that end really happen? Seriously?
B002ZG974M|5.0|I have been letting my daughter watch this from a very young age.<br />I actually took her to the theater showing when it first came out.<br />Our whole playgroup went with their infants.<br />There is no dialogue which I think just shows how we're all the same even with different languages.<br />We used to watch it on Netflix, then they took it off their queue.
B00AEBB8YW|5.0|This movie is an old favorite with a newer cast.  Even better, if possible!  Very funny and elegant.  My daughters and friends have enjoyed it with me.
B009HNDSL4|5.0|If you are going to watch Modern Family, you MUST see it from its beginning!  You will laugh and get an occasional knot in your throat.  Great television!
B00BSBR9N6|5.0|I fell in love with this guy...he worked so hard at changing behaviors for someone he loved.  He was so charming.
B0081KZ20E|5.0|Well written.  I was in Germany (US ARMY) when the OAS was active in France.  i have been to London, Paris, Copenhagen, Vienna and Rome and am somewhat familiar with some of the landmarks he describes.  The plot develops at a great pace.  Very believable story with incredibly viable characters.
B0015DWJX2|4.0|It is a good portrayal of the resilience of the human spirit. How in the mist of darkness and terror humans can chose to remain human and cope with harsh circumstances by turning to each other and good books.
0385528787|4.0|Atwood is a fine writer, it is a pleasure reading her books.  This is the third book in her trilogy and is a worthwhile read as are the other two, &#34;Oryx & Crake&#34; and&#34;The Year of the Flood&#34;.  She engages many contemporary issues, environmentalism, the position of corporations in modern America, the dangers of genetic modifications, etc.  I recommend this book heartily!
B003VANOFY|5.0|This is a great headset that I use for work. I can hear customers very clearly even with noise in the background and can listen to music while not on the phone. I had an issue with the headset a couple months after purchase with it not un-muting when i put the mic down towards the mouth but Logitech promptly sent me a replacement while I still used that current unit.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Scarpetta knows her profession. This one keeps you on the edge of your seat trying to tie things together. Cornwell is an amazing writer.
B00AEBBAEK|5.0|Awesome movie!!!! I love the characters and the atmosphere of London. Did I mention I love musicals? Love Jhonny Depp!!!
B00D7Z4GQY|1.0|Shortest book I ever read.  Didn't get the whole book apparently even though I was charged for it.  Would like my MONEY BACK!
B008YKGQR4|4.0|I have tried at least 3 other Facebook apps and always come back to this one because of it's dependability and speed.  The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because I have problems with the links - if I click on a link or story, I can't get it off my kindle which is where I use this app the most.  I end up removing the app and  downloading it again to get back to my home page - but only once in a while, not enough to be bothersome.<br /><br />This app lets me navigate and has everything I like about facebook.  I think it offers even more manageability than the original Facebook app.  Best yet is that it's free!  I wouldn't be on facebook as much without this app - it's great and so much better than the other fb apps.  Enjoy!
B00F87ZUYG|3.0|I'm really starting to wonder if this show is actually going anywhere. The first season was awesome but now it's starting to feel like a chore watching these. The movie production scale from the first season and the sense of story progression is gone.
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|This incredible book covers so much ground and is so fascinating.  Bill Bryson has done it again, with research and an innate ability to find and tell incredible stories, he has written a great history of a fascinating time (summer 1927) and a decade (the 20's.)<br />My book group loved it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Caught up in the games continue to be spellbinding. More is required and hoping the next book answers thought provoking questions and resolutions.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|General held my attention. Was a bit slow at times. Nicely brought together at the end. Of course a very predictable end but easy read if you are just looking to clear your head.
B001BANK32|5.0|I saw the movie long ago and the book, as usual, really gave so much more. Watching Jack lose his mind was so scary in such a real way really makes this a top King book for me. The movie also robs the brilliantly poetic ending from the book which made it a story new for me. Fun read!
B00BPDR3F6|4.0|Unusual, but forgettable  Good pace, good writing, I'd recommend it despite the fact that inmy opinion it doesn't have universal appeal. They won&#34;t make a movie of this one.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|This book is written by a teenager and helps to put light onto the complicated Pakistani history and social problems.  Her honest and straightforward narrating endears her without being sugary or fake.  Great book to read if you want to get a feel how things really happen in that part of the Middle East.
B0012GTZC0|5.0|great spy story, fast moving,<br />graphic details and sex. Movie was good but left out a lot of the action in the book.
B0067EKY7M|5.0|This si a great film.  There was not a lot of advertising or publicity when this movie released, but it is one of my favorire all time movies, in the same league as &#34;A river runs through it&#34;.
1451666179|5.0|So good you guys. New stuff I don't remember from the site, old stuff that is awesome and good. Wish it had the fish story, in the sequel perhaps?
B00BMCAM6M|5.0|I've been listening to this station FOREVER it used to be called iceburg Radio,,,,,SO much better than Pandora,,,that CONSTANTLY keeps jumping from one genre to another,,Accu stays with one,,,,,,,,YAY for Amazon.
B000003FMY|5.0|Knockout performance!  Dynamic, well paced and visceral!  There is a lot to be said for this classic recording.  One of the best of the era.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I thought I would have to replace my Kindle, but it turned out it was only the USB cable.  Thanks for great customer service!!!
B0006PV5VC|4.0|Knockout performance!  Dynamic, well paced and visceral!  There is a lot to be said for tese classic recordings and this is one of the best of the era.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|The entire series - what more could you want?  We bought a copy for us and a copy for my in-laws - it will make a great Christmas gift!
B004X6PRO6|3.0|I can't believe this book won a Pulitzer prize. Granted, the first part of the book was amazing. I actually had to put the book down and spend some time to process what I had just read before I could continue to the second part of the book. The problem was that there was a second part. The first part of the book was sublime, and should have ended there.
B000066744|5.0|Now THIS is a strange movie. But impressive. (AND IMPOSSIBLE TO describe. It's a film you'll want to see, but only once.)
B005PW3OS8|4.0|I enjoyed the movie, its not an amazing film by any means but it was entertaining. Particularly for someone like myself that read the comic books when I was growing up. Worth watching if you are a fan of the character or a comic book fan a all.
0792163710|5.0|An American classic. A great Western, great performances — and a love story, too. It is so much more than just a film. A study in duty, principle, values ...
B000SUKPKM|5.0|Great all-around CD if you like the Goo Goo Dolls.  Love listening to it in my car and while cooking dinner.
B000G8NXYG|5.0|All fans of the film should see it once. A classic. If you are ever to see it, DO watch the full, three-hour version.
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|The idea that a woman botanist was working at the same time that Darwin and Wallace were developing their ideas through natural history observations is quite appealing.  Her writing is beautiful and the main character is a complex, interesting, and resilient person.
0688103111|5.0|This is the kind of book that is both humorous and light enough to sit down and read in a single afternoon (I read it in spurts over a long weekend myself), but also offers a certain level of depth or introspection that is worthy of pulling back off the shelf for a re-read.<br /><br />I am biased I admit; I deeply enjoy Bryson's writing tone that veers from humble and introspective one minute to cynical and crass the next, while managing to never take himself too seriously. His humour is pointed, witty, but never striving for a punchline so it is refreshing. He often borders on being self-depracatory (usually toward his own English sensibilities) but more importantly wastes no opportunity to poke fun at other culture's idiosyncrasies when warranted. Bryson is the kind of traveler and author that will unashamedly poke fun at how awful Italians drive or at their failure to queue up in a line with any semblance of order, while simultaneously remarking how he loves the pandemonium that the country and it's people are alive with.<br /><br />If you are the kind of reader that holds world travel and travel writing on same sacred estoeric level, this might not be the book for you, BUT..... if you like ANY of Bryson's other books, then this is classic fare and par for the course for his characteristic tone. The visuals of the cities and impressions of the people Bryson crosses paths with are anything but dry, and sprinkled throughout his re-telling are some poignant reflections on how truly different life is elsewhere in the world. Again though, he has the remarkable ability to not take himself too seriously.
B009WUAK2M|2.0|Take washed up actors, give them a lame script and let the film role.  There are worse films but that isn't saying much
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is fun game I love puzzle games I play them all the time....I really like this game ill play it all the time....everyday.....
006202406X|1.0|What a disappointment!  I couldn't tell what the author was doing, but it was clear that she didn't know how to wrap up the series.  So she jumped tracks, made up a new and totally confusing story line, added a bunch of characters without developing them, and killed off a main character to wrap it up into a nice, neat, random, boring bow.  It was almost like she didn't even know what happened in the first two books.  I hope the movies stop after Insurgent, because this book as a film will be dreadful.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It was the most exotic book Iv read.The author paints such a vivid picture!<br />I was not able to put the books down till I read th all.I am still craving for more.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|The Chromecast met my expectations. I did extensive research on the item before I purchased so I knew exactly what I was getting. It has performed exactly as described and I use it on a daily basis to stream Netflix, HuluPlus and sometimes my Chrome browser to my 55&#34; television. It does everything seamlessly. My tv is actually a smart tv, but the Netflix and Hulu apps tend to lag when played directly from the tv itself. This doesn't happen with the chromecast. I highly recommend the Chromecast to anyone who would like to stream these apps to their tv.
B000E8N690|5.0|BEST MOVIE IN THE WORLD!!!!!!!!!!!!  I can watch it over and over and over and over and never get tired!!!!
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|This amazing puzzle game is not only entertaining but it is wonderful. With short readings before you play the level to presents and bonus games this game is a nonstop player and I recommend that you should get it
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I haven't used this sharpener yet but since I have another Smith's sharpener that has performed very well, I'm not worried about being disappointed. I got this sharpener so that I could have one that I could throw in my pack that would take up minimal space and still give me something to sharpen my straight blades and the serrated edges as well - sort of a &#34;plan B&#34;, auxiliary sharpener.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|I thought that the book was excellent.<br />The magic system is interesting and well explained, and the story was exciting and engaging causing me to look forward to future installment of the series.
B00BVMXBDO|5.0|Great Sci-Fi. And the actress handles multiple roles brilliantly. In this season she portrays 5 or 6 characters and some of those characters impersonating others. Astounding.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|It does what it says it does, easy to set up and use, and cheaper than a smart TV,<br />While the selection of what it can stream seems limited, I am looking forward to other websites joining in on the action.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's great to have this challenging (frustrating!) game on my Kindle. I've enjoyed it on my computer for quite a while so being able to take it with me is a treat.
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|The idea of this game is great. The only problem is that you either have to be willing to spend real cash or you have to wait long periods of time to build up enough coins for research or evolution. Can be over 500k to evolve one dinosaur and probably more with higher level creatures.

1619698196|5.0|Preston & Child's  Pendergast Series is one of my favorites in the mystery and adventure category.  Two Graves is the last of the Helen Trilogy and it certainly did not disappoint this reader.  I have all the Pendegast Series issued unabridged on CD and a couple that I could only find as abridged CDs.  To me this was the best of the Helen series trilogy.  Now I await White Fire,  the next offering in the Pendergast series.
B00C5R8364|3.0|Rather disappointed with this book for several important reasons. The plot overall was rather thin and very predictable with not much character development. Worse than that, there were several rather glaring simplistic research errors.<br /><br />He discusses the much used Glock pistol and references it as Swiss. It is not, it's Austrian and very easy to verify. He references Craigslist as a place to buy a gun and they do not allow gun ads. The Brit commandos prefer the Kabar knife and he states it is British. It is not, Kabar is an American manufacturer of knives. And then he has a Glock misfire not once but twice, back to back to make the plot work and that is a virtual impossibility. First, it simply isn't going to happen as the Glock is one of the most reliable weapons in the world - that's why it's used by police and military world-wide.  Poor research damaged what could have been a much better book. Not likely to read another of his.
1469240661|4.0|This Follet offering is not as satisfying to Follet fans as his works such as World Without End or The Pillars of the Earth, Winter of the World or Fall of Giants but if you enjoyed Lie Down with Lions, Triple, and Eye of the Needle and others of his fiction you will enjoy On Wings of Eagles.  Lots of action in this novel so give it a try.
B00BEIYMZ6|5.0|Great movie, I saw it 3 times in a week! Took my sister, she went 6 times and pre ordered it as soon as she could.
B0077ATSSQ|5.0|This movie is mostly excellent but at times sad because of Tom hanks' character being killed off in the beginning.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|This read like classic Clancy. I rate it just 1 tick below my favorites (Without Remorse, Red Storm Rising, Hunt for Red October). I was concerned about it being co-authored, but don't be.  There was only one section, set in a Hong Kong nightclub, that didn't quite fit for me. It was well written, but seemed different in a way I can't put my finger on.<br /><br />This book does such a great job of balancing shootouts, dogfights, naval strategy, and geopolitics. There is a sequence involving drones that matched the intensity  of the stealth fighter dogfight in RSR.  I don't know how realistic this stuff is as far as the threat from China is concerned, but it sure felt real.  Some of the early explanation of the Chinese government could easily have been too complex or boring, but it zips along just like the rest of the book.  There were some references to events that must have happened in other books that I have not read (John Clark is 65!) but those were asides and did not interfere with following this book.<br /><br />Much of the book focuses on cyber warfare.  This was done very well. As a systems engineer, sometimes the handling of high tech in books and movies makes me groan. But not here, with one exception.  At one point a crew of hit men raid an office building with the objective of scrubbing every last hard drive in the place of incriminating evidence. This would be utterly impossible. Even if they blew the entire building up, and somehow accounted for every laptop and mobile device, the servers would still be backed up off site. So the mission was pointless. Still riveting, but I had to work harder to suspend disbelief.<br /><br />But that is just a quibble. If you are looking for a good Clancy book, look no further.
B002R88G5E|3.0|I loved the history and the characters.  The love story was beautiful.<br /><br />The ending was very weak and disappointing, it didn't seem to fit.
B002436WFI|5.0|If you're ever read &#34;The Color of Magic&#34; you will love this movie adaptation. The Characters was perfect, and who wouldn't want a trunk made of sapient pearwood? :D
B0059XTTW8|5.0|Gary Oldman is one of my favorite all-time actors. Unbelievable that this was his first Oscar nomination. The story is completely told with an economy of images and dialogue that you never see today.
1577314808|5.0|This is the most helpful spiritual book on the market, period.  Have read it dozens of times and each time come away with a deepened, peaceful approach to life.  It really does teach you how to quiet the mind.  Love it, Love it, Love it.
B00F3BRQLM|5.0|It's great to see a movie where Khan crushes heads, kicks butt and takes names. Benedict Cumberbatch makes a great villain and Peter Weller is reliable as always. The new crew builds on their relationships and the special effects are terrific. A good second outing.
B00445RHKI|5.0|This show drew me in immediately. The comedic timing is impeccable. I especially love Cam and Phil. Great family dynamics.
B004H1YH66|5.0|Spectacular reproduction of an iconic soundtrack. Basil Poledouris was a genius. Check out For The Love of the Game and Starship Troopers for more great music.
B005NAE04E|5.0|Sometime in the fantasy fiction genre we get a great story poorly told , but not with this author .Great story interesting characters , love having London as another character , the notion of a city of layers all heaped upon each other knitted together by a London below.<br />Only problem is that it is getting harder to find this type of story that is really well written
B00881VLCE|3.0|I enjoy the puzzles but wish there were more options. The pieces are easy to place together. I like that the puzzles have a few different categories to choose from.
B008Y212PI|5.0|This game is so addicting if you are a puzzle person you would love this game. When I first saw it I thought that it could be fun but it turns out it  my favorite game ever. I give you my word you will fall in love with game at first sight.
B009NY43NY|1.0|*Spoiler Warning*  I didn't expect the story line to be quite as lacking.  I had a really hard time with the two villains as they were.  I had to look up Glassport, because he hadn't left enough of an impression for me to remember him.  Makes his part in the vendetta pretty weak. Newlin made sense as a villain, but wasn't developed much in action.  I don't see claude as a strong leader, certainly a weak candidate for the massive plot against Sookie--he's never struck me as a mastermind. :P Sookie also seems very different, but not in the sense that she's grown or developed, but more like she's altered completely.  She also shows remarkable inability to cut anyone any slack (e.g. Amelia can't get anything right in Sookie's mind it seems)<br /><br />As to the romance...<sigh> Granted, I knew when I got this book from the library I was likely to be disappointed in the romance aspect. I am among the Eric supporters, which is strange, because I don't usually go for the ultra-old, master uber vampire at the top of the pyramid.  His earlier dealings with Sookie though, how he showed in so many small ways that he would care about what happened to her when others neglected her (the gravel, the coat, etc.), not to mention how they were together when he lost his memory was so precious, so indicative of a real caring.  Like others, I also have a hard time picturing him giving up his freedom and autonomy to be some trumped-up queens playboy/1st officer.  Its as though he had a brain transplant.  Bleah.  Then there is Sam.  Sam, who as Sookie pointed out in the first book, never showed her a drop of interest until she got involved with vampires.  Getting past that, he made so much more sense as a friend. There just wasn't a believable chemistry between them for me. As an aside, why the h*** is the series titled all about dead when she ultimately swears off nearly all-things vampire and ends up with her boss???<br /><br />Whatever. At least I got to see the end of the story. Now I'll go back to some other series that have better potential.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|Game gets frustrating when you lose all the lives that you have saves. Plus some of the levels seam to need to purches to pass
B009CVRQLY|5.0|Celine Dion is one of my all time favorites, big fan I just love her singing of At Seventeen. Brought me back to that time when Janis Ian first came out with it!
B00DZV15FU|5.0|This book will always be a classic and one of my favorite love stories. Thank heavens for a book that so many future books could mime in a way that applause  it's brilliance.
B000FA675C|5.0|I love this book, though I have not yet watched the movie. I heard heard there is big contrast between the book and the movie.
B00G2SIW7M|5.0|I was nervous to listen to this because I love all previous Arcade Fire albums--intensely--and don't want anything to taint my impression of them. There's no question this album is very different from the others. I'm glad to find my anxiety was unfounded! I have actually loved this album from first listen. As for claims of pretentiousness, I just can't see it. I have a ton of respect for this band and can hear their love for music in everything they create. I don't hear them \\"trying\\" to come off any particular way--it just sounds like they really enjoyed making this album. Thank you, AF!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|OMG! That about sums up my first reaction to this incredible trilogy from Suzanne Collins. This unlikely adventure of Katniss Everdeen, her family, friends and fellow competitors in the Hunger Games will shock you....but you will quickly find compassion for this amazing young woman and want to know what happens next. This is definitely a series of books that you can't put down.... and once you read book 1, The Hunger Games, you will have no choice but to buy Catching Fire which leads you to book 3, Mocking Jay. The fact that you just can't wait to read the next page...then the next book makes buying this in a 3 book Trilogy purchase the absolute best way to go. I definitely recommend reading this trilogy before you see the movies. I have never read another book like this....even though their is much violence, especially between children, Collins makes her story one that will also touch your heart... don't shun this series because of things you've &#34;heard&#34;.....read it for yourself and I think you'll be pleasantly surprised that this is some of the best writing you've ever read.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is highly addictive beware and have fun. So many levels so little time. Music is annoying though mine is on silent.

B004X4R49Y|5.0|A great story that many Americans probably did not know. Colin Firth is worthy of his Oscar! A great story of overcoming a challenge!
B00F880BWG|5.0|Much anticipated and did not disappoint.  Clear viewing and easily accessible.  Would recommend esp if your cable company doesn't carry AMC. Price is reasonable, as well.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This is a gut wrenching account of a very serious, intent, famous American sniper, Chris Kyle, who was more than just lethal but enjoyed his \\"work\\" immensley. He wrote the book \\"American Sniper\\" which became an instant success, describing his war time experience in Afghanistan as a uniquely skilled sniper,<br />its intensity and the thrill of doing his work so competently. He killed an enemy soldier at the distance of a mile but it was the number of kills he had, more than a hundred, that sets him apart from all other snipers. Just 2 weeks after I had read the book, he was murdered here in America by being shot in the head by some crazed gunman who had asked him for lessons in using a sniper's rifle. I do not know what ultimately happened to the crazed gunman but was shocked to hear that Chris Kyle, considered a hero, had been murdered along with a companion who had apparently set up a rifle range for teaching marksmanship. His passion for his \\"work\\" sets him apart from the average, but he accomplished a serious war time need that inevitably saved many American lives thus justifying the medals he recieved for his valor and passion for his role as an American Sniper, disregarding the dangers of such a job and virtually putting his life \\"on the line\\" every moment he spent in Afghanistan.
B00902AKK4|5.0|This game was pretty frustrating at first, I admit, but once I got the hang of it I fell in love with this game. the boards are highly addictive and make you really really think hard. the little bug character is also adorable and makes you not want to help him die. I strongly recommend this game.
B00EJOCB4G|5.0|This was for my grandson and he absolutely loved this Lego the price was great and the shipping was so fast will tell all about this for sure
B007SYWFRM|4.0|The graphics are awesome! It is fun and interactive for all ages. The story line keeps it moving and interesting.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Too complicated set up. For some reason it generated a second Netflix account. I am giving this thing up and have canceled Netflix forever. Will stick with DVDs or nothing.
B00C2AXDAU|5.0|The opening guitar is hauntingly sad but sweet.<br />Kurt's voice in this track, especially, sounds like a live incarnation of the late Lou Reed.<br />Overall, this track is fresh and nostalgic at the same time.  I thank NPR for using this song in one of their promos and making me aware of it.<br />From now on when I need 10 minutes to myself this will be the song to time it with.
B008XG1X18|2.0|I did the upgrade and now my pins will not load correctly. I use to love this app but now it just frustrates me.

B000OCXIDK|5.0|This was a throughly enjoyable book club choice. This is a delightful European period piece and well worth the read.
B00C5R8364|4.0|Forsyth does not let you down. This book keeps you riveted to the story throughout. The main character, the tracker, is new type of hero to Forsyth's long list of heroes, but very intriguing nonethelless.
B009IH0ICG|5.0|For getting red hot fully lit coals this is the bees knees.<br /><br />I'll admit I was a gas griller for far too long. I was always worried I could never get the coals lit in any reasonable time and I've had a few over-fueled bad bad grilling experiences to know that also wasn't for me. A friend turned me onto this with an electric bbq lighter and I knew I had to ditch propane.<br /><br />So I prefer to use the electric bbq lighter [[ASIN:B000I1A5L0 B000I1A5L0]] thrown in with a pile of coals stacked on top and around it. It also has a wire rack at the bottom which cones upward so you can place a piece of kindling or fire starter or even newspaper below and light it up. Whatever it is you use, you will be amazed at how you have a pile of glowing completely fired coals in 20 minutes or less. I was worried the handle might melt or be too hot to handle but it's completely cool and not scary at all. I also like that it's made of sturdy, but thin sheet metal so it cools down real quick after you're done and isn't a hot fire hazard waiting to catch things ablaze.<br /><br />All in all, this single product is basically responsible for me converting over to charcoal/chips bbqing and I can't believe it took this long. If you're like me, get yourself one of these, that lighter, and a lodge cast iron grill and throw away that giant propane grill....OR DO WHAT WE DO AND USE IT AS A HOUSE FOR YOUR LODGE GRILL!

0061122416|5.0|For nearly ten years I was stuck working in a restaurant. It wasn't what I wanted to do with my life, and I knew I was stuck, but also, it felt like I was doing the only thing I could be doing at the time. I told my manager about by hopes and dreams, and he recommended I read The Alchemist. So I did. Then I read it again. And again. I highlighted passages, I memorized lines. This is the kind of book that can change your life. When you get to the part about the China Shop, you'll know why. I am no longer working in a restaurant.
B0034JKZ86|3.0|DVD skips at times or just stops randomly and I have to return to the main menu to re-start it.
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|A beautifully written tale by a master story teller. Spanning over fifty years, this evocative and tragic story offers some insight to the both the beauties and horrors of life in Afghanistan and all of the cruelty and deprivation that accompanies such a war torn location. Evocative and moving story of the enduring love of a brother and sister separated by a cruel fate and the paths of their lives as they try to make sense of their<br />life journey.Highly recommended.

I got the autograph 2 but funny thing is, it's not from this movie....No complaints, I just wanted to say if you order that it's from Friday The 13th (he's not wearing the glasses at all, and I had it checked.....it's from that movie.....I just wanted to say that because I know Corey Feldman s movies SO well, I've seen Every one of them since I was 8.....he's my FAVORITE actor and is just SO COOL! I saw  this one when I was a kid (like I said) and he was my FAVORITE character in the movie. Besides Kiefer Sutherland (Who as in interesting fact I found out on the net last Summer.....Met Corey then, and THAT'S how we got Lost Boys. I love how Corey's The Bad Boy telling weird stories in the movie.....and I read this Short story Last Summer (I wish that it was a novel though.) Now I saw Friday The 13th after I saw Scream.......(cause I had to know this background story; but I DIDN'T actually know Corey was in this one till I saw him in the flick.....It was a nice surprise though and I REALLY like how the characters are SO similar. AND that's something else that's REALLY cool about Lost Boys 1 thru  3 you get to see Edgars character develop thru out the years......the others.....not so much (although I DO like Allen as a Vampire.....and the background scenes That were references 2 the 1st movie (this is in The Thirst) And the respectful references that they had to Corey Haim in the movie, I thought that was descent.

0142180300|5.0|Mr Carroll does a great job with a pretty difficult subject if I as a none-academic can grasp what it's all about.<br />Well maybe not all of it but enough to keep reading.<br />As a person born in the 1920's it is incredible to my understanding of that silly word progress that we humans who in my time have spent so much of it trying to kill each other could get so many good minds together and even more so, so many practical makers of machinery to get inside the inside of the inside.<br /><br />Well done one and all, not forgetting Amazon for helping to spread the word.<br /><br />Ray
B007SGM084|4.0|People where saying these books were a good  read.So in reading these books, I found them to be quite sensuous.My only problem was Anastasia, she was such a wimp,always whining about herself.I'm not good enough for Christian

0316055433|5.0|Leafing through an art book, scanning the internet, or visiting a museum, you've probably had a work of art captivate you and then reappear in your mind at various times, perhaps even many times over the course of your life.  What it means to you is personal, for good art is personal.  And so it is with Theo Decker and Carel Fabritius's The Goldfinch.  For Theo, the painting is an anchor to his mother and a representation of order in a disordered world, a world of happenstance.  For everybody else in the novel, faux art dealers, thieves, and his friend Boris, it represents commercial value, value that, ironically, can only be realized indirectly.  Alone, for Theo, it is his anchor in a sea of troubles.<br /><br />And those troubles abound, recalled from their culmination in an Amsterdam hotel room, beginning with an infraction committed in school that has teen Theo worrying about his fate.  But his real fate proves worse than he could have imagined.  Visiting the Metropolitan Museum of Art with his mother, both deserted by their alcoholic and gambling addicted father, they are caught in a terrorist bomb attack.  It leaves Theo separated from his mother, who he learns later has perished, dazed, with an old man he had noticed earlier with a girl his age he found himself drawn to.  The man seems to encourage him to take a painting and entrusts a name and a ring to him.  Theo, with no help in sight, flees with The Goldfinch in his possession.<br /><br />Now his trying journey through life and maturation begins.  He meets Hobie and the girl Pipa.  The wealthy Barbour family take him only to have his father reappear and remove him to Las Vegas, painted by Tartt as a blown away dream of success and prosperity in a desolate ocean of foreclosed and half-built homes.  Boris, a teen Ukrainian criminal in training, befriends him.  Drugs and alcohol possess him, until he returns to New York to live with Hobie and learn the art restoration business.  He becomes a success.  Unfortunately, he employs devious means that return to bite him.  Worse, a person claiming to know he stole The Goldfinch reveals himself.  Then another more startling secret divulges itself in the person of his long lost friend Boris.  Which, toward the end accounts for Theo's febrile presence in that Amsterdam hotel room over Christmas.<br /><br />There you have the barebones of the story, but none of its heart, none of Theo's angst over stealing and concealing the painting, or the haunting pain of losing his mother, or his desire for acceptance and love, or his threading of an often hostile world, or the lessons he learns about life, about the chaos and unpredictability of it, and how he comes to terms with himself after little more than a decade of struggle, both inner and imposed.<br /><br />Some have described The Goldfinch as a Dickens-style novel.  It's that in the expansiveness of the adventure, in the profusion of characters, and in the propulsive plotting and twists.  In many ways, it reminded me a bit of Thackeray's [[ASIN:1593080719 Vanity Fair (Barnes & Noble Classics)]], in that Theo develops and employs his cunning to survive and prosper, though Becky Sharpe never becomes as introspective and reformed as Theo.<br /><br />Highly recommended for the story, the artful plotting, the colorful and colorfully presented characters, and Tartt's impressive knowledge of low- and high-life, as well as the meaning of art and the art underworld.  It's a tale you'll easily lose yourself in.unately, he employs devious means that return to bite him.  Worse, a person claiming to know he stole The Goldfinch reveals himself.

1609611543|1.0|Misleading and potentially dangerous advice for those who are not among the 6% affected by celiac disease and wheat or gluten allergies. Please do not confuse wheat flour, GMOs and processed wheat with whole grains (which includes wheat). There are healthy ways to lose weight and no so healthy ways. This falls into the latter group for most of us. Unfortunately, some people have no choice (those with celiac disease).  This topic inevitably brings in the Paleo/South Beach/Atkins diet to the discussion.  But if you want to lose weight AND be healthy, consider that nutritionists and licensed dietitians consider the Pritikin and DASH diets to be the healthiest. These diets have the most scientific support over many decades of research. One measure of how brainwashed people are about the paleo diet is to see their zealous attack on anyone who questions it. If you do not have celiac disease and want to keep your colon clean and disease free, eat plenty of fiber, a plant based diet, drink lots of water and avoid animal products as much as possible.

B009KS4XRO|4.0|I like playing this game. I would love playing this game if they would slow it down a bit.  I cannot completely enjoy it because the pace is much too fast and I have on many occasions missed bingo because of the ridiculous fast pace.  Also, I have on occasions missed bingo because the game stalled or did not allow me to tap the number or the bingo key.  I felt ripped off.

B005COO1X6|5.0|IMHO absolutely nothing Stephen King has written, has been anything but 5 star material except when he's teamed up w/ other writers. Those novels are good; don't get me wrong. And I'll read other authors also that I like a lot. But my preferred author is The King. The way he describes his characters and the situations and/or surroundings sometimes makes me feels like I'm right there, physically watching these stories unfold or I picture them in my mind like a movie.<br /><br />I will never pick apart the way any story is written as some will in their reviews because each novel or story is unique in it's own way for it's own reasons. If I stay interested and can't wait to start reading it again then I like it and will give it a good review. If it's only there as a way to pass time, fuggitaboutit.<br /><br />&#34;Mile 81&#34; like all the King's books, kept me interested from start to finish and I recommend it to anyone.

B00A6CCF0K|3.0|Stephen King is a brave fellow. Not many authors would entertain a sequel for such a popular and renown effort like The Shining. In his afterward King admits the notion of returning the characters to life had been haunting him for years. By imagining Danny Halloran's later years he undertakes a cathartic experience and invites readers to join him.<br /><br />The novel initially draws one in with an engaging chronological catchup and back story. The best part of the book covers Danny-now-Dan's troubled years. His struggles with alcoholism are scarier than any supernatural apparition. It is the ghost of his father that provides the most chilling scenarios. Dan picks up the pieces to the best of his ability with endearing and generous help from sound New England folk. King has taught us that if you are ever facing evil or malevolent spirits, it is best to have some hearty New Englanders on your side because invariably they win.<br /><br />I did miss The Overlook hotel in this outing. Substituting is a group of travellers called The True Knot. They, at first, were entertaining and mysterious but then grew disappointing. I could not help but draw comparisons to John Connolly's Charlie Parker novels and the strange villains he encounters in the same part of America. The True Knot are actually ancients but act like retired folks traveling across the US in Winnebagos (they reminded me of Irish Travellers or the Black Dutch). They too have an addiction that drives all of their decision-making.<br /><br />Doctor Sleep was interesting but lacked the scares and thrills one would expect. In fact, it was quite procedural. Laced throughout are lessons on family, facing adversity and the King constant of standing up to evil in all forms. He peppers the book with entertaining pop culture references and cutely cites one of his son's literary villains (how many caught that?). I am a bit harsh with the 3 star rating, it is more 3.5 and deserving of continued kudos for the challenge of bringing Dan back to us.bringing Dan back to us.

B00F031X62|5.0|Not as good as Justin beiber BUT he can play guitar ALMOST as good as John Mayer? LOL!! Seriously - we are talking about HENDRIX here!! Slap me around and show some respect for a God!! Recorded just after the Axis album and while recordings were in progress for Electric ladyland, this set is arguably Hendrix's finest, certainly his most visceral IMHO. All the songs are from his first album (no Axis here). Too bad. I understand he was to play an additional set later (which was rained out) and that could have included some Axis songs.<br /><br />The sound quality is excellent and the band just cooks!! One request - compare the sheer mastery of totally original free form  playing here with recent &#34;studied&#34; recordings by the likes of Joe Bonamassa and others. it is like comparing a baroque orchestra playing J.S. bach with a modern &#34;authentic instruments' academic exercise. Hendrix is the real deal - a genius who created his own style and reinvented the way an instrument is played. 1000 years from now, Hendrix will live on. However, Mr. Beiber, Mayer and, also, Mr. Bonamassa? Creative artists and entertainers they might be. But....there was and only will be, one Hendrix. This recording captures HENDRIX at his very best during his period of most creativity. But the CD AND the DVD/Bluray. I did.

B000002KB8|5.0|When ever does the first album of a new musical genre end up being the best album of the genre? This first one, Black Sabbath, may be the best 'doom' metal album of them all. Perhaps Nirvana's 'Nevermind' album is the best grunge album? I don't know. I don't really like grunge (sure a lot of great songs were done in that style or sounded perfect in that style), and I don't know much about grunge.<br /><br />This is nowhere near one of my favorite Black Sabbath albums, it's not even very close to being, but I wouldn't argue with someone who thinks it's their best album. Some people feel it is. Whatever it is Black Sabbath does differently, they do the most it on this album. This is nothing like a 'wall of sound' production. Each individual instrument can be heard so clearly and so distinctly, perhaps never has there been seemingly so much apparent 'space' between each instrument.<br /><br />The song 'Black Sabbath' almost sounds as if it's intended to be a novelty song. The rest of the album improves from there, so the song, and the band, had more of a life than being just that weird song someone plays in the background on Halloween while giving out candy. Black Sabbath would go on to play more than just doom metal. Ozzy Osbourne would later say, 'All that occult stuff only made up one album' as if to try and dismiss it. At least two of the songs on that album would come from here, the songs 'Black Sabbath' and 'N.I.B'. As is the case more often than not, in these occult songs the singer or narrator is confronted by evil forces 'Black Sabbath' and even asks God to help him. This is a viewpoint or position some what similar to the song, 'God is Dead' on Black Sabbath's latest album 13? Sometimes the singer of these heavy metal songs will narrate the viewpoints of those we assume he doesn't necessarily agree with. During 'N.I.B.' the singer tells what would appear to be his girlfriend, \\"my name is Lucifer, please take my hand\\". What would Ozzy say about that? And what 'would Ozzy do'?. Somehow I went 20 years or more never knowing what N.I.B stood for. A fan finally told me, 'Nativity in Black'. Then I forget what it stood for. . .<br /><br />I remember a reviewer pointing out that the band Metallica would have soft instrumental numbers between their songs, and this just made the other songs sound that much heavier. This is something that Black Sabbath has always done, and in truth it may be as old as music. After the song Black Sabbath, the happy, upbeat 'The Wizard' follows in what surely must be an odd song in the annals of Doom Metal. It's a nice song, even getting some airplay 15 years later or so on some Album Oriented Rock stations. The band Metallica would also follow Black Sabbath in that they would include a bass solo as an introduction to their song Whiplash on their first album, 'Kill em All', something Black Sabbath does here with their solo 'Bassically'.<br /><br />Most of the songs on the album are good, in my opinion. I may be partial towards 'Wicked World' and some of the others.. Somehow I went 20 years or more never knowing what N.I.B stood for. A fan finally told me, 'Nativity in Black'.

B00400NHRO|4.0|You may think this is a religious book--but it's not! Far from it. Written in 1978, but taking place in 1973-74, this is a satirical look at the first year of a medical residency at what is likely Beth-Israel Hospital in Boston. The main character is a graduate of Harvard Medical School. The book, which has been a cult hit among med students for years, tells of the slow and steady decline mentally, emotionally and physically of the interns. For the mother of an intern, it is a horror story. But I learned a lot! Do you know what GOMER is? Read the book and find out!
B000JMKTLO|4.0|I had read Gone Girl last year and really enjoyed it, Gillian Flynn kept me gripped and I couldn't turn my Kindle off, I couldn't wait to find out what happened. Sharp Objects is very similar. Up until the very end you really have no idea what is going to happen and who is the culprit of the murders. There's plenty of false leads and diverging characters that all intersect into a twisted reality. Flynn is a master at confusing her readers but keeping them so intrigued they can't put the book down. I think I read this over 3 nights and I certainly went to bed later than I wanted to each night because I could not wait to see what happened.
B009LDCXNY|5.0|What can I say? Addicted to Sam and Dean... No matter what they do, I want to know how the story goes on! Good DVD, nice bonus materials. top!
B0027MJU00|3.0|I read Gone Girl and Sharp Objects, Gillian Flynn's two other novels, and thoroughly enjoyed them. She made her characters rootable and kept you fairly confused and intrigued. Unfortunately, while she succeeds in keeping her readers confused and intrigued at the same sense, you can't really root for her main characters. Flynn's characters all have major flaws, that is her signature, but Libby was unlikable and I wish I had the ability to go to the character and shake her and tell her to get her life together already. She was not very sympathetic at all. You can have very flawed main characters but they need to be redeemable and be seen as a sympathetic character to the reader, however Libby was not. I was kept glued to the book because of Flynn's style of writing, every other chapter has some sort of unexpected twist, but at the same time I could not wait to finish reading the book because Libby was so unlikable.

B008JFUPK8|5.0|Please take this review with a grain of salt! This movie was a perfect blend of drama and action for a comic book based movie,and it does well to stay true to the characters.( yes in the comics superman does kill general zod in the comics via alternate universe) Nevertheless you really have to pay close attention to the movies course of the plot and why it unfolds the way it did. It answers many of the contreversal questions in the movie. Long story short an extremly entertaining summer or saturday night movie.
B003G4W49C|3.0|Was expecting a lot more considering the positive reviews and the fact that the book has recently been made into a movie. I found the story interesting but not particularly engaging and lacking in some character development. A solid read but unlike the title character Ender the book wasn't exceptional.

B00BB67UNW|5.0|Twisty tale that shows the seedy side of things. This movie has a great story, it is a drama with action.
0385537131|2.0|The last 75 pages of this novel were quite entertaining.  The prior 300+ pages could have been summarized in two paragraphs.  The plot is an old, over-used one.  There was not even a hint of humor anywhere in the book, as there are in some of his.  If it becomes, or if it is a best seller, it will be because of the author's fame, not because it is a fine read.  Basically, I find little to recommend here and nothing to justify the book's cost at any price.  Nevertheless, I look forward to his next novel.
B00B769XB8|5.0|Excellent adventure, and good acting from a great cast. The 3-d effects are very good and story line is fun.

B00CDZM4QS|2.0|This is, overall, a very unsatisfying Ring.  Thieleman's conducting and the orchestra are magnificent, however the sonics of this recording are just awful.  You have jack the value all the way up to barely hear the soft parts, only to then be blown away when things get loud.  It is really unfortunately, because you can tell the conducting and orchestral playing are of the highest quality.  Not much needs to be said about the singing, because there is nothing special to be had here in any role.  I don't think anyone is particularly bad, but no one gives an outstanding performance that leaves you wanting more.  I will say Wellgunde sounds like she's chewing gum while singing.  With the many alternatives out there, this set should be avoided.  It's a shame, because with better sonics, I would have loved this Ring.<br /><br />For a great modern Ring in the making, check out Gergiev's Rheingold and Walkure.  Now that's the cast this Ring should have had.  Both recordings feature the best singing I've heard since the late 60's.  Siegfried and Gotterdammerung follow next year.<br /><br />Update: I am returning this Ring.  It is just not listenable due to the horrible sonics.

The problem is that the Anker does not always charge the phone. Last evening while charging the phone, I checked the phone to see that my battery had only 25% left. This was after an hour of charging. I unplugged the connector and reinserted it into the phone. The phone began to recharge again. I don't know if there is an issue with the charger or with the plug of the charger. I am seriously thinking of returning for a new charger. The size and the weight  is no issue.

I certainly came away with a better understanding of how life was probably experienced by &#34;almost&#34; ordinary people from different social, political and economic circumstances.

B00AS1Q8FW|4.0|Great story, action, adventure. Tom is at his best in this movie, as he sells this movie. Fun adventure film.
B008JFUR10|5.0|Very overlooked and underrated sci-fi/monster epic.  Absolutely amazing spfx, but upheld by good story, and good performances by largely unknown cast.  Incredibly imaginative from top to bottom.  If you loved Godzilla movies growing up, plus Voltron, Robotech, Force Five, Shogun Warriors, etc., this movie is the ultimate realization of that genre.  It's very entertaining, but it actually has a solid story to go along with all the mind-blowing action.

B0026IUXME|5.0|This is by far my favorite film of the new millennium, and I have seen it many times. It is a faithful rendering of painist Wladyslaw's Szpilman's own simple and moving account of the terrible events he suffered in occupied Poland. Great for its performances, sets, script and costuming--but it's the carefully nuanced details that elevate this production- and they could only be brought to life by someone who lived through that era and knew that part of the world.<br /><br />Witness Wladek paying the piano in a restaurant and flirting so delightfully with a lady patron, Wladek strolling with a charming young cellist, who so sweetly and innocently says. 'Oh Mr Szpilman, you really are quite wonderful.' That is an era that is gone, swept away by that brutal war, never to return.<br /><br />There are, of course, many scenes which stand out during the film, but I think the young woman who is shot and falls to her knees on the street during the Warsaw Uprising, the 'crazy' old man and his orphans, the child who is beaten to death trying to crawl back under the wall into the ghetto, the young woman who has asphyxiated her child, the German soldiers who eat sandwiches while burning bodies, the gold tooth on the crook who is supposed to take care of Wladek but uses the opportunity to enrich himself, are outstanding.<br /><br />Brody's performance is amazing, but so is that of Kretschmann as the German officer who helps him- a mix of superior charm, cynicism, and benign indifference--one often saw that in European intellectuals of the era--but it is a character type that is sadly lost to history as well.<br /><br />The final scenes of the devastation of Warsaw are incredible and powerfully moving, as is the Chopin Polonaise that Szpilman is required to play after a long and devastating period of isolation.  A beautiful film and the fulfillment of the incredible promise that Polanski first showed in my favorite film, Chinatown.
B008JFUO72|5.0|Iron Man 3 brings what you expect from a great series of excellent movies. If you have not seen this movie yet, sit back and enjoy the show.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I loved the premise of this sequel to The Shining!  And I'm definitely glad I re-read The Shining before starting Doctor Sleep.  Both so good.
B00A8MGIZG|1.0|Strange movie, I normally feel ok about spending monies for a movie before I see it, as it's cheaper than going to the show...this was a complete waste of money and just added to the trash at the dump.
B008JFUOVI|2.0|focuses way too much on chow and the other characters just fade into the background.  alan and chow do not a movie make.
B005V5WBFG|1.0|This product slowed down my device. It caused some apps to not work as the drag on the system was too much.
B002RRWWQ4|3.0|I thought this would be as good as the rest, but it was by far my least favorite. Especially the ending. So disappointing
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|Fun and free! A good way to waste some time with a fun app. This is an excellent adventure with a cast of crazy birds.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|The Shining is one of my all time favorites.  Doctor Sleep will be one as we'll.  I loved little Danny Torrance,  I now have a great respect for Dan &#34;Doc&#34; Torrance.
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|This is an awesome game I love playing and do so several times a day. My kids enjoy playing as well it's got good challenges we work on together. It actually even teaches you a little about the farm.<br />Would love more neighbors I do play often and gift. Please add me FAUGNOE.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I am really enjoying this game. Plenty of levels and suits to unlock. Nice upgrades and bonuses...did I mention it has Minions?<br />Really well done and runs smoothly. Best of all you can move along in the game without IAP's. Something rare in this day and age for free apps.<br />If you enjoy runner type games grab this one. If you love the antics of the Minions like I do, you'll really enjoy it. Great time killer.
B00ANTX3HA|1.0|I only watched five minutes of it, no need to over think what was happening.  We lived this once and that was enough.
B00F2HW20M|4.0|Nik Kershaw and one incredible version of &#34;Blood On The Rooftops&#34;!!! This series of &#34;Genesis Revisited&#34; has been really really great!
B00CLD65X0|5.0|I really love the show.  It is wonderful in every aspect.  I can hardly wait for the next season to begin.
B00CH3DBNQ|4.0|This memoir provides a clear, detailed and unsettling view of life under the Taliban in Pakistan.  I was inspired by the determination to resist oppression.  I was frightened by the violence, lawlessness and poverty.  The lack of peace in the daily lives of this part of the world will scar generations.  I thank Malala and her family for their willingness to stand up to injustice and share their story.
B002JIBA8W|5.0|I can't believe I didn't watch this show while it was on the air.  This show was FANTASTIC.  I could go on and on but you won't understand until you watch it.  Go watch it now.

B003O86FMW|5.0|The second book in the series was everything I expected and left me wanting more. Highly recommend. I can't wait to read mocking jay
1594202273|5.0|A fair and sobering exploration of U.S. nuclear weapon technical policy from the 1950's through the early 1990's. While critical of military nuclear policy in general,and the strategic air command in particular, it is also caring and respectful of those who worked and sacrificed to keep the nuclear weapons system in the U.S. at all times ready if not at all times safe.  Its also a great read.
B00D8HNR2K|5.0|Back in top form, a mix of ambiance, power funk, and manufactured industrial tracks make this a solid album.  It was 2 listens before I felt great about it.  Really sit and listen careful to the layers, the samples, the lyrics.  There are some wonderful performances and some great guest artists contributing to a very good album.
B004J4WN0I|5.0|Interesting, fun, and complex while leaving no gaps or \\"just because\\" scenarios in the storyline. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and will read the others. Great job, Mr. Hearne!
B009YU62H2|5.0|Easily the best all-around album from Soundgarden since &#34;Badmotorfinger&#34;.  Almost every track is a gem.  Really only could have been better had the track from &#34;The Avengers&#34; soundtrack &#34;Live to Rise&#34; had been included.  It's musically tight and rewarding to listen to without sounding formulaic.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My kids love the despicable me movies and they're nuts about this game. I've tried to play it, I'm not that good since I don't use if often, but I think it's a funny and cute game for kids. They love it, and as a parent when you need an hour break, anything you've got to keep them entertained is worth gold.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|A visceral and descriptive tale - sometimes gets a little lost in itself but all in all an enjoyable read.
B005V5WBFG|5.0|i think it is wonderful that i can get McAfee Mobile Security free from Amazon. I have no idea what it does but I know that the name is outstanding in security. As soon as a grandchild comes to visit I shall find out what it is all about.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|it worked good for a month or so, but then it got missed up. It always says &#34;no cast devices found.&#34; I sent feedback and tried to fix it but nothing changed. In addition to that, you only can cast from Netflex and Youtube which is kind of good. However, when it first came out, you could cast videos and files from your cell phone and laptop. They canceled that features.
1451620837|3.0|I think it is important to remember these Rock Bio's are like paintings. Since we did not paint them ourselves we can only give our opinions or interpretations. Only the artist knows the true meaning. It is also important to remember bands are really families. Your family members may surprise you with their opinions of you and the details of your past. This has always been the case with the members of KISS. One guy remembers it his way and the other guy remembers it completely different.<br /><br />I would also say Peter comes across as more honest then Gene or Ace did in their books. The problem with Peter always has been that he blames everyone else for his problems throughout his life. The same theme continues in this book. He is what he is and did not try to sugar coat any of it, but he failed to come clean about why he was thrown out of the band three different times.<br /><br />Peter was given an opportunity to talk about the KISS albums and tours in detail, but failed to do so. As a KISS fan this is what I want to read about. Peter does not talk about his demands to be an equal member of KISS (during the Reunion tour) and his demands for more money on every tour after that. He tries to come across as a victim of Gene and Paul.....and in this book even Ace. Fact is he was given a second chance and when he screwed it up......he blamed the other guys.<br /><br />He was honest.......but not honest enough for my taste. Go to You Tube and listen to some of his post KISS interviews. He is very bitter and in denial. It leaves a bad taste in your mouth throughout the book because true KISS fans already know the truth. The book written about him by his ex wife Lydia was much more honest and as a result a much better read.
B00G722T22|5.0|Avril never disapoints me!!!!!  Love her and Chad's song...they sound awesome together!!!!  The entire album is great.  It's nice when you don't have to skip songs....love them all.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I love this movie. This version actually comes with 4 discs. the digital copy, the regular DVD. The Blu ray DVD, and the 3D DVD. Fantastic!
B004GNFSO0|4.0|It's the story of an incredible journey.  It's hard to imagine the hardships they must have endured.  Well worth the time spent reading it.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This is such a game changer!  I absolutely love casting music to this when cleaning up around the house (and the sound is so much better than using my headphone output on my phone to the surround sound), or casting videos whether from YouTube or Netflix.<br /><br />The controls are nice, and it sits tucked away behind the TV.  I can't wait to see what Google does next!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Probably the best I have seen of its kind. Part hidden object part superb puzzle. Highly recommended it. The music and the graphics are  very well done. Can use a bit more storyline, to make it much more than a puzzle game. Like Lara Croft with out the shooting. Plus there needs to be a climatic ending.
B008XG1X18|3.0|Pinterest is a nice app to save images of things you love and things you might admire. The downside of it is mainly when you click something interesting to hopefully find out more about it it takes you to a dead link.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|fun and amazing game. when im bored I play bingo blitz with friends. I enjoy it great app for my kindle
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|I saw the national news reports claiming this game is very addictive with its glossy look and soothing male voice. I played it for a week and that was it. I am not one to pay for extra content, perhaps if you are you might like it.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|My high school Spanish class uses this app and its awesome! It's easy to use and fun to compete with friends!!!!! Definitely worth downloading!!!!:)
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|DVD was new.  Quality was excellent.  My sister and I enjoyed watching this season together in my living room on the weekend.  I had to write all that stupid sentence, because this box required a certain number of words before it would let me submit it!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Sooo much better than the movie. A quick, easy read, but well thought out and very creative. Sets the standard for a zombie tome.
B000002KXO|4.0|Following the brilliant albums of the mid-1970s, the eponymous 'Fleetwood Mac' and 'Rumours', and the rambling, sprawling double album 'Tusk', the Buckingham/Nicks/McVie version of Fleetwood Mac seemed to be breaking apart. When they got together for this album it was something of a surprise. Perhaps people expected too much; perhaps the style didn't match the New Wave/Heavy Metal vibe of the time. For whatever reason, this album got rather lost. Fleetwood Mac were far from finished, as 'Tango In The Night' several years later showed, followed by a series of reunions. However, 'Mirage' has always been the album everyone forgets.<br /><br />It's a pity, because this album has a lot of good stuff on it. The writing is as tuneful as ever, with the three songwriters demonstrating their distinctive styles. The singing is even better; I've always preferred the clarity of Christine McVie's voice to the more throaty Stevie Nicks and on this album Christine has some lovely songs. Stevie does her part and Lindsay Buckingham chips in with some interesting numbers. I particularly like 'Eyes Of The World', which starts off with a tribute to Pachelbel's Canon and develops into a bravura guitar solo from Buckingham, a rippling stream of sound at the very limit of the speed at which fingers can move.<br /><br />As always with FM, the production is first-class, uncluttered and pure with every vocal and instrumental line clearly separated. Mick and John do their usual solid job and the sound is well-grounded.<br /><br />It's really a first-class album and over the years I believe more and more people are seeing it that way.
B009LDD5E0|5.0|Who wouldnt love Glee! I have to admit that things started off a bit rough for season 4 but now I cant wait for season 5! The first three seasons were so innocent. Probably the only down side to season 4 is missing the characters I came to love in the first 3.
B00B8R1NP0|1.0|I have never felt the need to write a review about any book I' ve read,but this book was just horriable. It felt like I was reading a BAD B movie. I don't understand the high ratings for this book.

B002T8Q5SW|1.0|Marilyn Manson(real name Brian Warner) is without a doubt,one of the sickest,creepiest,filthiest,poor excuse for a \\"human being\\",that has ever walked this earth! This man(if you wanna call him that) has done and said so many vulgar,obscene things,that it would probally take five hours or more,to tell you of all the wicked things he has done and said throughout his hideous career.For example...he promotes suicide and murder at his concerts,by telling his fans(most of them teens) that they should kill themselves and their parents.He even mutilates little innocent animals.An example of this,would be the time he threw a six week year old puppy out into the audience at his concert,and told his fans to rip it apart and spread the blood all over each other...which they gladly did.What I wanna know is,where the heck were the animal rights groups when he did this??? As far as I'm concerned,Manson should have gone to prison for that! This twisted degenerate also influences listeners to do illegal drugs as well.Sick!
B000VLOKQI|5.0|my father in law loved this present as he loved this bad and he did not know that I knew it so it ws a great surprise.
B009NXV2RK|5.0|It was right up there with Tom Clancy's best - holding attention to the end and riveting.  Sad that it is the last in the series
B00G4PX1MO|5.0|Finally a fantastic game that you can play without spending money at every turn. Very fast paced and addictive! Best of all, you can play the entire game without having to spend extra cash for every single upgrade. Too often these games are a complete money drain, playable only by spending massive amounts of cash, this as rare exception! Highly recommend.
B0096HIEE2|3.0|This movie was all over the place. It lacked a strong story line. It lacked dialogue. It did not explain things for the viewer to understand why and how things happened. It was very slow. Channing's dancing was excellent. Dancing is his expertise. That was not surprising. Channing's dancing was the only exciting thing that I liked in this movie.
1465414444|5.0|I loved it! It was full of pictures, information and lore. But i think it was damaged on delivery or something, because the glue in the spine is coming off. Other than that, hundred percent happy!
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|I didn't like the story line. It was slow getting to the point of why and how this all happened. Denzel played his part successfully but not my kind of movie. It was Boring and lacked excitement.
0446582778|5.0|I am an avid Harry Bosch fan his strory goes on and continues to be fairly realistic, binding reading. The only problem is that i read the book in a day r two so the enjoyment is too short.

B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Definitely keeps you hooked and is very fun. You will not want to put your device down! Well worth its price. I bought it wondering if it would be a lame puzzle game, but it was very addicting and some places, challenging :)

0880794968|4.0|These cards are standard sized. They come in a simple cardboard box that has examples of the artwork on the front and back. Some people don't like that they are glossy. I love that about them. I like anything that feels as if I can clean it if I need to. They are sturdy and don't feel flimsy in my opinion as well. Shuffling them initially is a bit difficult as they are stiff. That's absolutely fine, I'd rather have stiff than something that feels like a paper towel. The artwork is bright and clear, much easier to read than other RWS decks I've seen.<br /><br />Overall, nothing special, just a good, reliable deck great for anyone from beginners to pros.<br /><br />On another note, I think Amazon needs to start looking at some more efficient packaging. Compared to the deck of cards, the shipping box was HUGE! Quit killing so many trees guys, use envelopes maybe?
0316074314|5.0|Wow, wow, wow! Beyond words.<br /><br />That was my first impression upon reading The Luminaries. It's a mindful novel, vast in scope, steeped in thought.<br /><br />At least for this reader, the time taken to read it slowly, with diversions to explore astrology sites to plumb the many allusions and the story's framework, all proved rewarding, not that I claim any great degree of mastery after a single passage through its pages.<br /><br />But, it is understandable why it took a highly qualified Booker jury no more than two hours to sort through a most competitive field of nominated tomes to arrive at the consensus (no vote was needed) that the most deserving of the lot is The Luminaries. Each of the jury members read it thrice and was rewarded handsomely each time through. This puzzle of a book is well worth a reread.<br /><br />As might be expected, professional reviewers split in their judgments. The majority, as best I can determine, deemed The Luminaries a wonder; with a minority not nearly so positive. Janet Maslin of the NYTimes even went so far as to trash it: \\"There are readers who will be fascinated by the structure and ambiguities of 'The Luminaries.' But by and large, it's a critic's nightmare.\\"<br /><br />I agree that this is no book to be read under deadline pressure, with the goal of arriving at some simplistic judgment on its worthiness.<br /><br />In addition to a slow hand, it might be more illuminating (ha,ha) to approach Eleanor Catton's book in a way that accommodates the thought and art Eleanor Catton infuses in its pages. It is a book, I think, that most rewards readers who surrender their projections before opening the cover.<br /><br />Catton employs several structural devices, the most important being the Golden Spiral, a geometric configuration frequently seen in galaxies. The spiral, a cousin to the gyre, expands by a factor of roughly 50% from the preceding spiral as it moves away from its source. Graphically, it's a tunnel effect.<br /><br />Catton says her original application of the Golden Spiral would have resulted in 300,000 words. So, like many others who start out to employ the Golden Spiral, she modified the formula and came up with a 200,000 word tome.<br /><br />The effect on the reader is a leisurely spiraling story for the first 360 pages, the essence of which is that a group of 12 residents of the gold town - the luminaries - are gathered in a hotel to shed light on a murder, a disappearance, and the provenance of a fortune in gold discovered in the murdered recluse's hut.<br /><br />As the story spirals, the sections are reduced by half, and the pace quickens as the story enters the 12th and final section.<br /><br />The second structure is a circle, which obviously manifests in the inner and outer circles of the astrology charts at the outset of each chapter, but also the ourouboros or snake/dragon figure from antiquity symbolizing a cycle of regeneration.<br /><br />In one of many fascinating and poetic passages, Cotton examines not only how the houses of the Zodiac each contain qualities that relate them to neighboring houses on either side, but that the whole Zodiac is a story unto itself, which incidentally manifests in the novel's characters as they move through the various characters:<br /><br />\\"What was glimpsed in Aquarius - what was envisioned, believed in, prophesied, predicted, doubted, and forewarned - is made, in Pisces, manifest. Those solitary visions that, but a month ago, belonged only to the dreamer, will now acquire the form and substance of the real. We were to our own making, and we shall be our own end.\\"<br /><br />The passage goes through the houses examining their influences on one another in describing the story of the Zodiac governing the story of The Luminaries, concluding with this:<br /><br />\\"But the doubled fish of Pisces, that mirrored womb of self and self-awareness, is an ourobouros of the mind - both the will of fate, and the fated will - and the house of self-undoing is a prison built by prisoners, airless, doorless, and mortared from within.\\"<br /><br />The reader who takes the time to reflect on this passage gains the key to the story.<br /><br />The end of The Luminaries is all about beginnings springing from the union of the male and female luminaries, in the convergence and divergence of the sun's direct light and the moon's reflected luminosity:<br /><br />\\"Different beginnings? I think we must.\\"<br />\\"Will there be more of them?\\"<br />\\"A great many more...\\"<br /><br />This is a story set in circular space/time, an eternity without beginning or end. There is no inherent distinction between the three times, past, present, and future.<br /><br />Enough about the structure that is causing such a buzz, and I think discomfort to those reading The Luminaries under deadline pressure and readers more comfortable with a more linear story.<br /><br />The more traditional linear action of the book is easily described. It answers these questions: Who killed the recluse? Where did the prodigal son get to? What is the provenance of the gold treasure that so many lay claim to?<br /><br />The answers are sifted like gold by a cast of approximately 20 characters in the spiraling course of the story with no beginning and no end. (Interesting to note that the movement of panning for gold is at once circular, but also requires tilting of the pan so that the circular motion resembles a spiral to tease out the gold.)<br /><br />The characters - including the 12 luminaries each aligned with a house in the Zodiac - are deeply drawn psychologically in the first 360 pages. The astuteness of the psychology, based on the story of the Zodiac, itself is otherworldly. The defining qualities of each character as well as the recessive counter qualities all come into play under various conditions (including convergence with others manifesting complementary or opposing qualities).<br /><br />The discerning reader will come to see that the qualities manifest in these characters mirror people and relations we face in our lives. The play between these qualities and their manifest characters explain how the most hardened and mercenary character can show compassion to someone he has victimized such as when the capitalist Mannering in one instance is threatening the Chinaman digger Ah Quee with a pistol, and soon thereafter shows the same man compassion in saving him from a beating being administered by thugs who have been set in motion by the primary law authority in town.<br /><br />The characters are drawn with great humanity and compassion, which allows them not to appear as ideas with arms and legs as they might if sketched by a lesser talent than Catton. The cast itself creates a community with all of its functioning parts that itself evolves as a character, with many balances not the least of which is the convergence of goldfield law, and the more established codes of civilization's law.<br /><br />I've gone on at too great a length. For that I apologize. But like the many professional critics who have taken a run at this wonderful book, I have yet to scratch its surface.<br /><br />About the author: In addition to doing some research on astrology and the Zodiac, I culled interviews - written and audio - of Eleanor Catton. Normally, I pretty much leave the author out of any book's consideration (how do you factor into Billy Faulkner's works his diddling 17 year old girls...don't answer, please).<br /><br />But in this exceptional case, it's well worth the time to pore through the interviews. As one might expect, The Luminaries springs from the finest kind of creative mind, and she is guileless enough to field every question asked of her and answer intelligently.<br /><br />As a former newspaper reporter, I have never seen anyone so accomplished in an interview, and she's doing it without talking points. Her sure-footed answers are offered graciously and without hesitation.<br /><br />As she matures, you might not be offered such an unobstructed glimpse into that fine mind.he qualities manifest in these characters mirror people and relations we face in our lives.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|It works and it is very simple to install. My wife uses it for Netflix, almost exclusively, and some YouTube, so I cannot opine on other channels (does it work with Amazon PrimeTime? Don't know, haven't checked). The form factor is excellent; no problem finding space for it in the back of the TV. I installed in HDMI 1, and it's just a follow-the-instructions exercise. Once operational, very fault-tolerant. We really enjoy it.
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|Bryson at his best!! He is amazing at his research and has a wonderfully humorous way of presenting it. Even if you don't know much about the babe and Lindbergh , you will love the connections to the world at that time. A great read!
B009FZHYKU|4.0|This is my guilty pleasure. I recently made the decision to not watch it anymore, but I really loved the series while I was watching. If you love zombie stuff, this series has set the bar pretty high. Even &#34;World War Z&#34; seemed to pull from it.
B0053O89WY|5.0|Bought as a gift for my son!  He (as do I) loves this series!  The humor is fantastice, great belly laughs!
B0001AUAU4|5.0|What's not to love about a sexy French woman serenading you? Seriously. Carla Bruni is my new favorite singer! My sons, who are taking French in school, love listening to this disc with me and telling me what she's singing about.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|Love this movie!  The cast is awesome and it has everything I love in a movie!  Action, adventure and humor!  Was so excited to be able to add it to my video library!
B0000AK7AB|5.0|I love this movie. It's so adorable. My whole family quoted it for years after our initial viewing, so it was with great joy that I purchased it from Amazon. Super fun for the holidays, and your kids will love it.
B0094K1PW4|4.0|Even though the movie lacked continuity and a reasonable story line, I was caught up in the action. The final scene did not wrap up the many questions that were not answered earlier. It is the kind of movie that I feel guilty saying that I like, but it held my interest throughout. I am usually disappointed when a movie leaves me with so many unanswered questions, but something about Super 8 made the time spent to watch it worthwhile.<br />I enjoyed Joel Courtney's performance. He had a mixture of naivete and sophistication that seemed to fit the movie well. One minute he seemed to know exactly what was happening and the next minute he seemed to be at a loss about what he should do next.
B001S86J0I|5.0|Another great movie for families. We love to quote this one, like &#34;That was a hell of a thing,&#34; and &#34;By Grapthar's Hammer... what a savings.&#34; Too great to describe. If you enjoy movies that aren't afraid to laugh at themselves and the genre they are poking fun at, this one's for you.
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|This album is truly his best in my opinion. His first three albums are great... and thats where he started to fall off. His comeback with recovery was pretty good but there was something missing. I think with this album, he really accomplished what he was trying to do with recovery. The sound has a little bit of that recovery vibe to it, but it is much more polished. His rhyming patterns and flows are at an all time high. They are better than his first 3 albums. The songs have meaning and are well thought out. There is only really one true single of this record and thats &#34;The Monster.&#34; The album is very well balanced with rappity rap and slower songs.  This album he revisits all of the same topics from Marshall Mathers LP but brings a closure to those story lines.<br /><br />For those complaining about the beats: The sound for the most part is minimalistic but you knew that was going to be the case when he brought Rick Rubin on board to executive produce it. Its more of back to roots hiphop.<br /><br />If you are expecting to hear Eminem rap in the same style as he was in 2000, you will be disappointed. If you have an open mind to an artist progressing and changing, you will be blown away.
B001NESPHC|4.0|I want to love this album, but I just can't. I'm not sure why, but some of the covers she does just feel kinda tired. When you have such amazing talent, it seems odd that you would just tap someone else's song. However, those that are her own are wonderful. She's a magnificent artist, and I look forward to adding other discs of hers to my collection.
B0000AK7AA|5.0|Such a great movie from my childhood. Couldn't beat the price and it was a great addition to my Halloween movies.
B0013O123Q|1.0|It is just SICK!!! You can understand the story line if you can bare to watch it to the end. The filming just plain sucks, the violence is way over the top and the actors are not real.
6305428042|5.0|Love this movie! It came in perfect condition and in perfect time for Halloween. Couldn't beat the price for this movie.
B0049U4NQO|5.0|I liked all the action that took place in this book. It kept me reading it. This book is AWSOME! I recommend it to EVERYONE!
B005PWPUW6|5.0|This amazing little thing works wonderfully to connect my iMac via TOSlink optical cable with a mini plug adapter to my vintage stereo for fine reproduction.
B00GBCMW9S|5.0|He's back! Love all the different styles. This guy can put anything on a track and it's money. Going emerald!
0385537131|5.0|As usual I enjoyed reading his book.  Grisham as usual has his hand on the pulse of real life and I always enjoy his writing style.
B0050PYNP8|5.0|Original and imaginative , really funny seriously do not know anyone that does not like this movie. I can only Imagine what the creators of this movie are thinking and racking their brain to sequel this movie. This could be called a cult classic someday.
0060245867|5.0|This is absolutely fabulous. The key story is engaging and brings joy to people of all ages. The illustrations bring a whole additional story line to the book and are absolutely incredible. I will be reading this one again and again and again. One for the ages.
B000HZHBIM|5.0|This was the first and it set newer standards, also story line is relevant and plausible. Just a movie to enjoy the old fashion way, some popcorn, and something to drink. I was glad I watched it.
B0026QC0TA|5.0|It's just a great movie. Suspenseful but no perfunctory 'collateral damage', good message and good people. The acting is very good.
B009LQKHIO|3.0|I was going to give it four, but (and this seems to happen a lot) theseauthors are just not writing enough and as a result their stories and characters just aren't singing. this should have been great, but its just not.
B00B89LZ4C|4.0|Say My Name..Great display piece for the BB fan. Mine arrived half separated from the backing card so..yeah a display piece. Not the highest of collectable pieces produced so I am enjoying it displayed bag in hand with meth on top of cash and gun in hand. Hat and glasses are separate pieces and removable as well. Overall nicely done Heisenberg by Mezco Toys
B00F8KIJ2I|4.0|Contrary to what the singles might lead you to believe, \\"Avril Lavigne\\", the album, is a big step up for Avril Lavigne, the singer, as it explores different sounds and nuances of Avril's voice and personality.<br />As a matter of fact, I believe Avril ought to be picking her singles not just because they are commercially viable - I mean, outside her fanbase, who would know that her last album effort, \\"Goodbye Lullaby\\", was such a nice, smooth ballad album, when her singles included \\"What the Hell\\" (which could've been taken straight out of the poppy \\"The Best Damn Thing\\") and the (rather generic) \\"Smile\\" - but instead, because they reflect what the album is really like as a whole, its 'soul', if you will.<br />In the new album, her current single \\"Let Me Go\\" may be a better option to do just that than the previous ones; but truth is, there are much stronger songs in the album. Songs like \\"Give you what you like\\" and \\"Bad Girl\\" stand out particularly because they're so different from Avril's previous efforts, and still, you can surely believe it's her, and not just her faking something she's trying to be. Not only are these songs fresh - thank God! - but they're also really good; \\"Give you what you like\\" is actually one of my favorite songs of hers-- ever. And that's saying something! Too bad it never became a single, further reinforcing my point. Most people will never even hear it.<br />That's not to take credit from other solid songs like \\"17\\", \\"Hush Hush\\" and \\"Falling Fast\\", but these songs are within what you would expect from Avril, she's good at that, we know it. After more than a decade, I'm ready to see what else she's got-- and she's starting to show us.<br />I have to confess I was a bit worried when \\"Here's to never going up\\", the first single off this album, came out. Even though I thought the song was 'fun', I feared this album would be just another attempt to mimic how successful \\"Girlfriend\\" was, but, thankfully, I was wrong.<br />Good for you, Avril. And good for the fans, too, obviously. Here's hoping the next one proves everyone (once again) how great you can be.ns, too, obviously. Here's hoping the next one proves everyone (once again) how great you can be.
B00E95ED32|2.0|I heard &#34;Wake me up&#34; on the radio and instantly loved it.  I'm a fan of Aloe Blacc and thought that it was his song initially.  I had never heard of Avicii.  So I blindly bought this CD and it's just not my cup of tea.  With the exception of the aforementioned song, each song started out good but then got annoying  after about a minute and a half.  I couldn't force myself to continue listening to each track to just try it.  There is just an overuse of the dynamic pulsing for my tastes.  Many of the songs sound like someone is constantly turning the volume knob up and down.  I should have just stuck with the single.  Oh well, live, learn and Ebay.
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|I enjoyed it tremendously. Gilbert's language is sparkling, so quick and alive. I had the sense I was watching a movie; her descriptions are so gorgeous and so effective. Has a very cinematic feel. I was completely captivated within a few paragraphs. Humor -- there's a lot of humor in the way she words things. A lot, a lot of laughs. It's as though the whole thing is a comedy. She finds a way to look at everything through a lens of wonder. I really enjoyed being in that head, behind these eyes and ears that always saw with wonder.<br /><br />I adore the fact that the heroine isn't gorgeous.<br />I adore the fact that the heroine isn't a very sexually active character (for most of it / without giving too much away).<br />I adore the fact that the heroine is a disappointment in so many ways to her society's expectations.<br />I adore the fact that the heroine finds a way -- many ways in fact -- to keep herself thrilled, entertained and sort of in a wonderland no matter what happens.<br /><br />I really enjoyed Ambrose & his way of thinking. Had chills when he was describing his worldview.<br /><br />And that, dear reader, tells you the book is entertaining and enthralling, without giving away the plot.
B000069KE0|4.0|I liked  it.  I originally got  the album on vinyl back in  college('70-'75). It sounds just as good, except the &#34;Make Me Smile&#34; suite when played on the cloud.  Whereas on the album the tracks are close enough to sound continuous, on the cloud (I  use Roku), the  tracks are obvious.  Why?
B008JFUO72|5.0|Love the Iron Man series with Robert Downey.  He makes the character seem real and its a fun movie to watch.  I've watched Iron Man 3 several times and have enjoyed each viewing.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This app is a blessing because I do a lot of reading electronically on my PC Tablet as well as I'm doing research for a paper.
B004EF65QA|4.0|A beautifully acted love story set against the backdrop of a grey industrial town in Northern England. Daniella Denby-Ashe and Richard Armitage are a great match and convey emotion with a look.  Worth seeing
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great read....was suggested to me while on vacation, and I could not put the book down, lots of twist and turns, I highly recommend it.  I have never read any of her books before and now I'm looking to read more of hers.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have this game downloaded on all of my devices so that I always have it with me. My daughter and my coworkers are racing against each other.
B005HP2JAM|2.0|The use of 3D for this film really offers a great perspective of the curvature and texture of the surfaces these very ancient and well preserved art works exist.  This I enjoyed however for about 20 minutes.<br /><br />The problems with this movie are a few things:<br /><br />Werner Himself:<br />Werner drones on monotonally with a voice just slightly more exciting than Stephen Hawking.  He also drones on with an overly self important dialog.  As you watch you begin to lose focus on the cave and paintings and being to imagine how proud Werner is of himself.  His self important drone culminates at the end with a stretch of a connection between albino crocodiles in an artificial environment 15 miles away and how they might question the drawings if they saw them.<br /><br />Material:<br />In the movie we are presented approximately 20 images, repeatedly, ad nauseum, and some of the mineral formations.  The cave itself is never really presented except for a 3d dotted plot which leaves you wanting to actually see how large and expansive the case is.  This is never really shown.  Although you see the paintings, you never really get to see them in the context of the surroundings.  This is essentially the same thing as buying a DVD of the a tour of the Louvre, seeing only the paintings and never actually seeing the Magnificence of the museum that they reside in.  The Louvre building itself is very much also a part of the experience.<br /><br />Organization:<br />This movie is very disorganized and disjointed, we see the paintings, then an interview about life outside the cave, then paining, then life outside the cave, then sculptures, then painting, but never really getting how they work together or tell a story.  Then discusses albino crocodiles that have little to nothing to offer about the cave, but I think was a way for Werner to show off the fake tropical environment miles away but didn't have material to make another movie about that.<br /><br />Overall, this entire movie is just way to long, monotonous and unsatisfying.  It is great for some images of ancient, well preserved cave art.  So, fast forward through Werner or watch with the sound off and subtitle on.  Play your own music and you have a great 20 minutes of 3D art presentation.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Book kept me interested the whole time. I love the ending; very much on the vain of Empire strikes back.
0425252868|5.0|My word, this is a Great Book.  I read a friends, and then had to order one for myself, and one to share with other friends and family.  Hardship with a wonderful ending.
B004SDSSFY|3.0|I chose this because it was inexpensive and easy to use.  I use the word processor for taking notes during lectures and sermons. I can easily transfer material from my phone to my pc for saving and editing.  I have been using it for several months and have not had any trouble with it.  The excel is usable for simple projects.  Because of the size of the phone screen, it is not useful for complex projects.  But I do use it for expenses and other things.  I have not used the Powerpoint very much. So far I haven't found a way to insert pictures.  But I didn't buy the program for the Powerpoint. If I were looking for something sophisticated I would probably buy something that cost more and is more intuitive.
B000FC1K66|2.0|The novel is not quite interesting as the movie US did. The analysis is too basic and the author clearly wrote the book thinking it as a movie. I believe the author saw more movies than read much books.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Titles are a good size.  Easy to see.  Even the kids like it.  Like the variety in lay outs.  Would recommend.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|It was fun reading this fairy tale about dating a kinky rich man and living happily ever after. Is this book TELLING women if your good at sex, you will marry a rich man?
B00FY9JJYA|5.0|Loved it just as good as his last album some thing you can play from beginning to end most have
B00DJ6KYWQ|4.0|Frederick Forsyth again writes a thrilling story. A very good read.  Recommended to all who like a thrill. Looking forward to the next book
B00C5R7F8G|5.0|As an AIR Force veteran and student of history, I was amazed at how little I knew about the history of nuclear weapons. Everyone working with complex, dangerous technology should read this. Especially those making decisions about next generation weapons.
0062082841|5.0|An amazing coffee-table book that's just jam-packed with cool and interesting photos and details about Guillermo del Toro's sanctum sanctorum, notebooks, and creative process.  Anyone who's a fan of del Toro's work (and who isn't?) would treasure this volume.  Not since Forrest J. Ackerman's legendary Ackermansion has there been such a wondrous place as del Toro's \\"Bleak House.'  Usually these sorts of books are vapid puff-pieces and advertising nonsense.  Not this one.  An invaluable look into the mind and philosophy of a master film maker.  Can't recommend it highly enough.
B003TQKVGU|5.0|It's so empowering knowing that subconscious mind is a divine instrument of the universe with powers beyond conscious comprehension.  I am, I can are more than just words but are triggers for the subconscious mind to propel you to your desires.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|This is a really great product. The quality and ability of this is as good as it gets. It shipped rapidly and came in a really nice box. Great product. An offer like this is a no brainer to buy. I don't know anywhere else that you could get this for anything close to this price. Wonderful . . .
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|The cross fire series is awesome. Yes it is an alternative for fifty shades but I have read all of them so far and I will keep buying them until the end. Unfortunately I know I will be upset when it ends.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|Phillip Phillips is a great performer. I really like his style and his every sound is unique. The purchase and download went very smooth. Anyone making this purchase will be very satisfied. Great...
B0083Z614S|5.0|No real words can describe how beautiful this story is. It's pure, and clear like a glass. Every description transported you to the gardens, and it feels alive in your mind. Every time I have somber thoughts, I come back to the pages of this book and remember who I am.
B00A7W29BE|5.0|Love it! Very clear pictures, I don't need a scanner to send documents. It was free, but I would have bought it if I'd known how good it was.
B008ALA6DW|5.0|OK, the fact is, when I'm using wifi, the download speed is 10M/s, but when I use the adapter connect to the ethernet cable, it is 57M/s!!!!! Great! (download speed results come from Speedtest.net)
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Such a great series, it looks very clear and has great colors even in just the DVD form. We put these on for the kids to go to sleep by, David Attenborough's voice is so soothing and calming, they are asleep very fast!
B0079J28NW|5.0|&#34;Hey Bulldog&#34; scene, crucial to the full vision of the film, is included, although it was not in the original American theatrical release.  Fully restored frame by frame, it fulfills the vision of Brodax and Company.  A treasure.  I bought a Blue-ray player just so I could watch it.
B00AF7Z44K|5.0|It's a great series, so the third season couldn't be less.  If you like the TV program, get all the seasons.  It's worth it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It took a while for Amazon to get the &quot;real&quot; version, and in my opinion, it's spot on!  Haven't found any glitches either. FUN GAME!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|While it's not the most original idea for a game, the scenes from the movie, good graphics, and fun powerups make this a good value for the low low price of free :-)
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|works well and easy to set-up.  Somewhat limited in its functionality but for the price it does everything expected of it.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|A wonderful story of friendship, courage and love, with added insight into the human soul from an unusual third party narrator.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|great game, but very addicting as everyone who plays will tell you.  I purchased a mini i pad because the kindle did not have candy crush and so gave my 5 yr old grandson my kindle.  when I saw the kindle now has the game it is keeping the grandson very busy trying to catch up with me on the i pad.  Thanks so much for getting the game on the kindle.
B003AYMZO2|5.0|i am enthralled with the entire series of &#34;breaking bad&#34;. there is always a &#34;twist&#34; you never saw coming. I would watch this series again, and again, and again.
B00CS74W0C|5.0|A fabulous story line and a lot of attraction and romance that similar books lack. I can't wait for the next books to be released!!
B000002UZ4|3.0|Just didn't like the song choices on this album, could have stuck with 7 or  8 songs and it would have been more pleasing to me.
1401938906|5.0|This book was a blast.....Fun, thought provoking, clear and precise. I loved it. The concepts are factual and the exercises simple and easy to do.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Just wish didn't take so long to get lives back other than quite challenging. Some frustrating but keeps me strategizing
0321146530|5.0|Very nice book. Explains the subject in a very interesting way and answers a lot of questions which are quite common from people learning TDD. Everyone who wants to learn the real thing should read it, as this book is the real source.<br /><br />Of course, some of the stuff is outdated, since this book is from 2003. For instance, JUnit now offers a better alternative to testing exceptions, which is the @Test(expected = MyException.class) construct. Also, Hamcrest is an additional library which offers more fluent assertions. You can find it here: [...]
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Bingo blitz is very enjoyable for bingo players like myself. They have been great returned  chips due to lost connection. You can complete rooms on your own that's great .
B00EHMG358|4.0|Very interesting beginning to what is always a good read in the Pendergast series.  As usual can't wait for the final version to be released.
B008476HBM|5.0|This was a really good book! It was a easy read and a fun book to read!!!! I will be reading it again!!!!
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|When I had made my way through this book, I was reminded of the screensaver on my desktop which has a photo of a small child stuffed into a wire waste can with the sign \\"Put your ugly children here.\\"  This book has that sort of odd, slightly off tilt perspective throughout.  It would read best on a device that shows off the photos and handwritten letters, but I had no difficulty reading it on the Kindle Keyboard.  Can't say I loved it, but I was definitely intruiged enough to read it straight through.  I'm thinking this one would do well with the teen age crowd rather that younger children, but it is enough of a good story to keep an adult entertained for the duration.  Put your Odd on and give it a read.
B00AB7HESI|4.0|A lot of people are having problems with this game and giving it one star because they can't place an item after typing it in. Guess what?  Don't use the button... hit your Enter or Return key afterwards. Works fine!<br /><br />My only complaint is it helps you out too much with clues and that there aren't updated levels fast enough.  Keep new levels coming!
0767817478|5.0|Although I prefer the Japanese look of Godzilla, the story on this one was very well done. Seeing Godzilla wreaking havoc in New York was very nice. The chase scenes with him going after the cab was very nicely done and very funny.  I kind of missed him using his destructive breath as in the Japanese versions but I really did love the movie so I will give it two thumbs up.
B000W93CHC|5.0|This sequel to The Pillars of the Earth, continues the story of building the cathedral, and follows the families involved. The life and times are so detailed and delightful.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I just cannnot get enough of it.  Dont know why Im so in love with this series!  Woke up thinking about it this morning.  I guess Im just so upset they killed Matthew off, and now Iam searching for season four!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Very interesting read, even for a guy! Will definitely spice up your relationship with you spouse if you take notes!
B002OSXDAU|5.0|One of my favorite books. Rand is very controversial, but put the politics aside and you have an excellent book with great characters that win over your heart because you truly want the best for all of them...even if you think they are selfish scum. It tells the story of two ways a relationship can do. You end up wanting to be a Roark and not a Keating. I reread this one often to keep me humble.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I can't even say how much I love this. Part 3 was my favorite. This is the best book in the trilogy
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Works. Have used it to communicate around the world, great tool! CHEAPER than making phone calls. Be aware of your postings.
B000TKW3E2|5.0|The composer and the musicians are sublime.  The music is like a river which helps one navigate a painful and moving story.
B00F880BWG|5.0|I am a zombie fan from way back, love the show. Can't get enough, I got my family into it.
B00F91H666|1.0|Good book - Terrible movie.  The book was premised on an after-action report for the UN.  Compilation of interviews of survivors of the &#34;Zombie War&#34;, origins of the disease, government and individual reactions, political mistakes, military mistakes - and lessons learned.  The movie was so loosely based on the book it shouldn't have been allowed to use the title.<br /><br />Brad Pitt seemed to be the luckiest person on Earth - no matter what the location, or how bad his situation, or the hordes of overly athletic zombies - There was always a helicopter, armored car, machine gun, or soldiers ready to save his butt.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I enjoyed Divergent and Insurgent.  This book gives it the ending that is needed.  Like the Hunger Games Trilogy, you are felt fulfilled and complete.
B009Y6X65C|5.0|Wow what a testimony to talent.  Enjoyed this from the first listen.  Guitar runs are stellar, lyrics very smart. Booyah.
B004UJTG6Q|4.0|Very Very good read. I really enjoyed it, has been a long time since I read it. I sure see why it is a classic.
B00E9ZFIMM|4.0|Great note taking tool - suffers from the standard kindle keyboard flaw - to small for my fat fingers.  Other than that works well, downloaded it and several other note aps over time as the free ap of the day and this one seems to work the best.
B00GD9F59S|5.0|Holy Daimon Babies. That book was wonderful. It had me laughing, crying and completely stunned. It was the perfect ending to the series. Jennifer L. Armentrout is a wonderful writer and I absolutely love her books. If you though the pervious books were good this one is amazing. Definitely worth reading. I had it finished in less then 24 hours because I couldn't put it down. :) READ IT!
B0087HT36U|5.0|Fun alternate version to angry birds.  had some glitch operation but subsequent updates seem to have corrected most of those.  I managed to work through all the phases, maxing out the score on each one so it must be simpler to play than angry birds - maybe that's why I like it.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I have no problems with the news feed. It helps me stay in touch with family and friends out of state and sometimes out of country. :)
B006C45MRE|2.0|I wanted to like this movie. Aliens and the wild west. It had potential. But, sadly, no such luck. The fast action scenes were too fast so you couldn't get a good look at the aliens and the plot, well, very weak. Anyway, it was rather boring and they tried to give it some interest with the personal relationships in the movie, but that failed. I'm also tired of watch Ford flinch. He does it in every movie he has ever been in and he just can't act. He gives the same delivery in every movie. Just change his clothes and the location. As far as the lead. They just tried to explain too many things about him through flash backs, flash sideways and flash forwards. I guess it is a movie for guys who like cowboy stuff with a little alien thrown in. It is really just a cowboy movie where they hunt the aliens instead of the indians.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|It really helps me when I'm mad to calm down I love b how it's just fun and helps me learn to have fun when ever and where ever!!!
B00FJMK9VE|5.0|Stryper has been one of my favorite gospel rock bands for a long time. For awhile I thought that they gave up on the gospel rock scene. But they arrived back on the scene just in time for me to realize how much I missed hearing gospel rock music. I love their signature color gold and black, cool colors. They also did a fine recording job on the album. Stryper still rocks.
B00E5N8E2O|5.0|I bought this for my son because he is an avid fan of Def Leppard.  He's been asking for it so I bought it for his birthday.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|Both of my grandsons love Minecraft. I have bought two sets for each of them. One of them did not stop construction until it was finished.
0307949486|5.0|This book is filled with secrets, and figuring them out is the real fun. Steig Larson's &#34;The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo&#34; is an incredible work of fiction unlike anything you have read before. Its ingeniously crafted mystery and great cast of characters makes this one of my favorite books, and hopefully yours as well. I love a good mystery and this one may take the cake. The characters that drive this mystery are some of the most well crafted, memorable individuals in fiction. Among these is Lisbeth Salander, a hacker and analyst who is very troubled to say the least and Mikael Blomkvist a disgraced journalist is was convicted of slander against the powerful Hans Erik Wennerstrom. I wouldn't want to spoil any character development, but I will say that Lisbeth Salander is one of the most memorable fictional characters of this generation. Mikael Blomkvist was great as well and I thought Daniel Craig did an excellent job as Mikael in the US release directed by David Fincher(and no I haven't seen the original swedish version, but I am looking forward to watching it soon). Stieg Larsson did an amazing job writing this book. Many people find it slow, but I find it's meticulous knack for detail to be extremely intriguing. It's sexually explicit nature has turned away many a reader and I can't blame them. Sexual abuse is one of the books main plot points and it gets pretty disturbing as the book goes on. With that being said, I couldn't put the book down and I read the book in only 3 days(This is quite an accomplishment for someone who has read a lot of books at a snails pace)! I have yet to read the following two books in the Millennium Trilogy, but i'm expecting great things from them. So.... you should read this book! The meticulously written, twisted plot and memorable main characters make this book a classic. Contraversial, but a classic nonetheless.
B005MMY9A8|5.0|Great movie and nice storyline, keeps inline with comics and mythology! I will be adding this movie to my collection!

B00EVW0VTI|2.0|This one trails way behind the much better \\"Olympus Has Fallen\\". At least in that one there were well written characters and dialogue. In this movie the President seems to be very concerned about his Nicorette gum and his Air Jordan sneakers. All of the jokes do not work and there is no excitement until the very end. I guess it is an OK watch just once but I watched \\"Olympus Has Fallen\\" at least 5 times already.

B005Y423ZC|5.0|Aside from the fact that she is an excellent vocalist, the DVD that is included shows her show live at the Royal Albert Hall which is unbelievable. I looked up the history of the hall and it is quite interesting. This CD has all of her best hits.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|If you enjoyed Divergent and Insurgent DO NOT read Allegiant.  It in no way resembles the first two books.  It's better to leave it to your imagination what happens than to read this book.  Such a disappointment.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Whenever the Infinite gave me what I wanted was a complete surprise. I say \\"surprise\\" because:<br />1 - I was not expecting;<br />2 - I did nothing to happen.<br />Yes, I had a wish, but it was so light, so elusive that it can not be considered as a product of my will. It's hard to explain: it was as if the desire had come to me spontaneously and I did not give it a second thought.This happened to me so many times that I believe the secret is to let it happen. God knows what we need before we ask. So if we believe in God, then we believe that we have always the best for us. The more we relax trusting in God, the more we will receive.<br /><br />This has been my experience. When I relax and let happen, big positive surprises happen. When I try to make it happen, nothing happens and often happens that I do not want.<br /><br />If you prefer to learn a technique, E Squared is an interesting book.
B00FPH6AXE|2.0|Here's the deal.  If you LOVE Will Smith as an actor, you  will probably be ok watching this moving on a cold or rainy night with not much else to do or see.  If you merely like Will Smith as an actor,  re-watch MIB  or Independence Day.  The ONLY reason Jaden Smith is in any movie is his dad.  I watched until the end,  while surfing the net on my iPad at the same time.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Better than Facebook edition!!!  Love the fact that you never run out of energy!!!!  Will definitely request my friends play!!  I am so glad I can play on my kindle!!!
B00F35BV64|5.0|J.J. Abrams is has really done a great job with the Star Trek series reboot.  It's extremely rare that I buy a movie, but I did (the blue-ray - digital download combo is really neat).<br /><br />The movie moves quickly and easily held my interest.  I first saw this flick in the theater with family (wife, kids, in-laws) and some friends.  Everyone loved the movie.  It is just as enjoyable watching again, at home.  The acting is very good and it looks like the actors all had lots of fun making the movie.<br /><br />Please make more!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|One of my favorite apps.  I make sure this one of the first things I download with a new phone.  The predictive text is amazing.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I play candy crush on the pc all the time and now I have it on my kindle. So happy
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|At first I thought this game was going to be simplistic and boring, but I was pleasantly surprised to find it to be fun and Challenging.
B006WZLCZ4|3.0|Just received this- these are Beautifully crafted wood toys but the pot and pan are TOO SMALL!<br />The picture of the little girl playing with them are deceiving! The utensils are actually bigger than the pot and pan. Let me put it to you this way, the salt and pepper shaker will not fit in either the pot or pan, together. This set is a great ADDITION- but you will need to get pots and pans that your little one will be able to put things in! The Hape toy makers make Beautiful products but they Failed to adjust the size of their products accordingly. The pots and pans are what makes the play fun, being able to put stuff in them.
B00003CX95|2.0|'Braveheart' has always been a very popular movie ever since it was released 1995.  It was a big blockbuster hit and won many awards.  To me, this is just a decent movie.  I can sort of understand its appeal up to a point, but the story has many weaknesses and Mel Gibson seems pretty self-absorbed.<br /><br />First of all, I felt the love story at the beginning was very brief and was skimmed over pretty quickly.  It was a nice love story, but it started and ended with abruptness.  I don't know the history of William Wallace very well, but many parts of the story were confusing.  It was hard to tell why the Scots and Brits were at war with each other, other than the fact that the Brits were oppressing them.  One thing that ruined the movie for me was Mel Gibson's ego.<br /><br />Many unnecessary scenes are filled-up with showing the viewer the coolness of Mel Gibson.  I can't help but think Mr. Gibson was going on an ego-trip, especially with the ending of the film.  The movie prides itself on vague notions of freedom.  Freedom is wonderful, but I think most people now think its corny when the main hero of the film yells, \\"Freedom!!\\" in one of the final moments of his life.  It doesn't look or sound dramatic and heroic; it looks and sounds cliched and over done.<br /><br />The movie does have some fine qualities to though.  The battle scenes are well made and it has a wonderful soundtrack.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Just downloaded this game today. Oh my! How fun and easy to play. The tutorials are very very helpful. You DON'T HAVE TO BUY WITH REAL MONEY as long you take your time n follow the steps it provides for you. Time flies when your having fun. This is the best hidden game I've played in long time! Get it!! Learn new stuff. I also LOVE the music...Graphics on my Kindle fire is great! No glitches too! Enjoy it.. you'll love it!!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love that candy crush is on the kindle it is awsome I love candy crush it is a awsome
B0091REZMW|4.0|I recently download this game and its kinda get use to playing. The tutorials are very helpful so please do that before you play. Have to hook up to people either on Facebook or Twitter. But I went through people I don't know and added them. They can be helpful if your stuck in a room or need help of killing a creature. Only BAD THING is running out of DIAMONDS too soon. You need these to get energy and tools to get to place to place. Only time you get more is finish a level or BUY them in the shop. Which I won't do. Thank you. Other than I love it and makes the time go by. I'm still learning this game.  The graphics on my Kindle fire is fantastic. The only other part of the game is try to find objects just about in the dark. You use a flashlight sometimes. I hate that cause of my eyes... So I blown up the screen to see...so it's not boring! Have fun and enjoy the game!!!!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I love playing the game but I don't like that after so many try's you can't continue for a certain amount of time when you earn it.
1451666179|4.0|Allie Brosh's Hyperbole and a Half is one of the internet's favorite personal experience blogs.  This book takes some of the greatest hits from her website and combines them with several brand new stories, all illustrated in her signature neo-primitive style and printed on very heavy paper.<br /><br />That is an attribute not to be ignored.  This is a very heavy book.  As in weight, or mass.  (well, weight is just mass multiplied by the acceleration due to gravity, so it's all related, but you get the idea)  It is one of the best book values in terms the quantity of paper for your budget dollar, therefore I highly recommend it.
B007ZGO7EM|1.0|DON'T GET!!! It keeps freezing up my whole kindle every time I open the app. It won't sleep or react to anything!! I have to totally power in off while in the charger and turn it back on. I say again DO NOT GET!
B000FCK65W|5.0|“A Tree Grows in Brooklyn” is a coming-of-age story that chronicles the life of Francie Nolan.  The title of might seem a bit obscure, but the author does a good job of explaining its significance and draws upon this metaphor as we watch Francie grow up in Brooklyn in the early 1900’s.<br /><br />The book included interesting tidbits from life in the early 20th century and some nuggets of wisdom.  One passage that stood out was, “They learned no compassion from their own anguish.  Thus their suffering was wasted.”  That is a great life lesson for everyone to learn when they go through hard times.<br /><br />I found it interesting how Francie’s mother was completely against any form of charity, and she was determined to get by on her own hard work and merits even if that meant some cold, hungry nights.  Imagine what our society would be like today if people took their own fortunes into their hands and were willing to work hard for a living!<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed sharing in Francie’s highs and lows as she endured some hard times, but still managed to have some fun along the way.  The episodes recounted in the book had me smiling at times, angry at the injustices Francie encountered, and sad at times as Francie learned some of life’s hard lessons.  I recommend the book to anyone looking for a good family story, a look at life nearly a 100 years ago, and a story of hope and possibility.
B007AJFSJW|5.0|Right off the bat, I have to admit my knowledge of economics is pretty much zilch and I’m a loyal fan of Krugman’s biweekly column in the NY Times. If you enjoy his style, this book is for you. As usual, Krugman manages to break apart complex theories into palatable pieces, presenting a convincing case for ending austerity measures along with a Keynesian expansion of government spending. Likewise, he demonstrates how this will never happen in our current political environment. Usually, I despise punditry books, but Krugman has won me over with his ability to dissemble complex ideas into simple examples, such as his illustration of the flaws with the Washington babysitting cooperative. A quick read (and a bit dated at the time of this review) I highly recommend this book to any economic novice who is seeking an understanding into the current fiscal mess and achievable means for setting the economy back on track (hint: it doesn’t include shutting down the government).
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|John Grisham never disappoints. This man can really  tell a story . He brings a lot of characters in and then brings them all together.  I  could hardly put it down, yet I hated to finish it, because I won't have another Grisham ,until he writes another. I have read all of his books ,and am amazed at his ability to keep coming up with intriguing stories. Mr Grisham, thank you for all the hours of enjoyment that your books and movies have provided for me. I am almost 90, so I hope that I live to read another  John Grisham  novel.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is one of the best weather apps. The ads are not invasive and are not close to the control buttons like other apps. Good job to the devs!
B00D7OMNXS|1.0|5-stars for amazon.com shipping and quality. But this movie WAS THE WORST of all of the Iron Mans. Gave Iron Man 1&2 5-stars. This one yuck!
B00B7FXZQS|5.0|Good scary movie!<br />Recommended for anyone who enjoys being moderately ruffled.  Not extremely scary so I let me 10 and 12 year old granddaughters watch it.
B000O8OTNC|3.0|I was so anxious to use it since my knife was dull. It's okay in a pinch yet I don't particularly think it works wonders. I should be able to cut through a tomato without much effort. The jury is on out this. It's compact and easy to store yet I didn't get great results. Maybe I need instructions...
B00G9U7NEQ|5.0|Best Kids movie of all times. It has it all of the graphics needed to make a very good movie.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Even though I have never gone hunting (though I want to). This makes me feel as though I am actually hunting.<br /><br />  Sincerely, A hunting lover
B00F8LPH90|5.0|I think that its a beast game, except its basically the same thing over and over again. But with the rush and all the upgrades and types of cannons, it never gets old.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|some levels are way too difficult.  It tends to become more aggravating than fun at times, so I give up
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|Lots of twists and turns. Morgan Freeman is one of my favorite actors, and he didn't disappoint. I'd write more reviews if Amazon didn't force them to be lengthy.
B008Y212PI|5.0|This game is quite fun and addicting, I bought all of the other FlipPix art games after playing it. I like how there are multiple difficulties for each puzzle. The only thing is that, in the 15x15 and 20x20 puzzles, the squares are too small and I oftentimes tap the wrong square, which is frustrating; I think a zoom feature would be helpful. But overall, very fun game. :)
B005Q1W10A|5.0|So Rich!!!  The story lines, the character development, the casting, the acting.....I can't think of enough superlatives for this series!
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app is the best weather app that I have ever had... it gives a ton of detailed information and is easy to use.
B00B0LPWU6|1.0|We could only bear to watch the first thirty minutes.....it was so utterly ridiculous in so many ways as to make it almost laughable, but there was nothing funny about it.  My husband is a pilot, and he said the only thing they got right was that the pilots did not wear their hats in the cockpit.
0764141201|5.0|Just what I was looking for to enrich lessons for intermediate and advanced ESL students. This book is a complete resource of so many verb phrases we native speakers take for granted.  Perfect!
B00BUVPIRS|1.0|Decent game at first but after a few hours food becomes the main focus breaking the immersion of the rpg . Too bad it showed a lot of promise
0307408833|5.0|Had to own this book after my sister-in-law introduced me to it, and I actually tried the recipes! It is hard to believe these are not full fat, full eggs/butter/milk! Delicious. We aren't vegan but we're dabbling in gluten free, and so it is nice to know these recipes are truly yummy.  Our favorites so far are the gingerbread cupcakes and also the carrot ones!
B003O86FMW|5.0|To put it in short.  This book was amazing.  The new characters brought in were captivating and I just couldn't put my kindle down once I started.
B005PK57IK|4.0|Very good,, always keeps my interest.  Love the varied court cases and the different people in the firm.  Hope it continues.
0803738412|5.0|A wonderful story for the fall season. The kids loved it. I do wish we could get our hands on the British English version, but we'll live with this one!

B0040I09RM|5.0|This show is compelling, enjoyable, gripping and extremely entertaining. Sons of Anarchy keeps me at the edge of my seat!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun game!<br />My daughter &amp; I play as a team. Very challenging &amp; takes up a lot of time. So far I really l like it
B0032UYFA6|5.0|The Wire meets the Sopranos!! I could watch this for years and recommend this to a friend......Everything I expected and then some!
B000V5Y1SQ|2.0|Though the storyline is interesting, the viewer is so frequently subjected to the character's immature outbursts and grossly exaggerated overreactions one would think the entire crew must be schizophrenic.  They should have named it Deep Space Nursery.  Even the Captain is all nanny nanny boo boo.  As a casual fan of TOS and TNG I found this series to be a let down.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|Wow this is so epic I love it the best game ever and thanks for making It free P.S thanks Reliance games
B00BSBR9N6|4.0|Cute story with hilarious moments. Modern day happy ending, all characters are like able, and there are a lot of them!
B0048WQDIE|4.0|Unlike everyone else I did NOT have to read this in high school but I was always curious about it.  My husband bought it on kindle but he could not get past the first few chapters.  The chronology is very jumpy in the first section.  I decided to read it and once I got into it, I couldn't put it down.  Reading this edition on Kindle was a very smooth experience.  I really loved some of the sections; when<br />the war becomes a metaphor for life, when Yossarian asserts the basic responsibility of each person not to take the life of any other.  It was a little confusing and repetitive.  If you are looking just for a good yarn, you will be disappointed.  It is more than just a story of exploits.  I am glad I finally read it.  I think I appreciate it much more now than I would have in high school.
B00007KWHG|5.0|I love this CD and everyone at work loves it too.  All original recordings worth every penny.  In fact I've bought it twice because the first one got scratched.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|Hard to put down. Wish the energy core problem wasn't' there. Otherwise perfect . By the way loved the movie
B000QRIGLC|4.0|Good read overall read this a few months back would read again in the future on a rainy day recommended read
B003L7DK74|3.0|I love Flight of the Conchords. It is a hilarious show that mocks everything in the perfect ways. The music is awesome and the humor is awesome. The only problem I have with my purchase is that it took too long and the discs are scratched. The box was damaged. I bought this new, by the way. I have finished the first season and it was skipping the whole way through. Not many scratches though. I'm scared to watch the second season because it is scratched to the max. I'm disappointed. I think I'm going to buy both seasons over again, separately. What a shame.
B0036TGT2A|3.0|I love the The Little Mermaid.  As a film, it's a true gem in the Disney vault.  The reason I gave it 3 stars is I bought the 3D version and was very disappointed.  I'm sure you're thinking &#34;well it wasn't made for the 3D&#34;.  That's very true, but there's been a few conversions of 2D to 3D that were amazing.  Finding Nemo comes to mind.  Disney should have left this one as a 2D film and saved people the extra money.
B00EJX2YGM|1.0|Though, I enjoy having the movies and box set, the fact that it says Digital Copy but its not its Digital Ultraviolet which is a huge let down as you can only watch them via Ultraviolet apps. Which I cannot as I don't have an ipad or iphone, though I have android phone I didn't buy this so I could watch it on my phone I bought it for my ipod.
B00DXLO0D6|5.0|They don't make shows like this anymore. If you want a show the whole Family can enjoy together this is it!!
B003DXSXCI|5.0|Another &#34;must see&#34; movie. Steve Mcqueen very good actor. I had heard about this movie but I has never watched it before it was great. Thanks to you guys at Amazon. For you guys out there joint the club to watch &#34;free&#34; movies.
B00GB7GX20|5.0|New sound but same amazing vocals...Celine Dion is more than amazing, this is what a great album should be she never dissapoints.
B004FGMV0W|5.0|She is still awesome! You could tell how hard she has worked since she first started singing when she was 17. I am 20 and have been listening to her since I was about 8. I love her music and she is my hero.
B003UYUP58|4.0|Great book.  Reads like a detective story in parts and very informative.  Sometimes gets bogged down in medical jargon that can be hard to follow.
B00F8KIJ2I|5.0|I love her music and I am glad I bought the CD. I have been listening to her since I was about 10 years old and I am now 20. She is my hero.
B007VUCAVO|4.0|It does just what I need and has more features I don't.  Have installed it on both our Kindled because we liked it so much.
B000FC1PNE|5.0|It tells the story of Colin Bridgerton and Penelope Featherington who have known each other for 12 years.  Penelope fell in love with Colin at first sight...and Colin doesn't even remember when they first met.  Penelope has been a wallflower on the outskirts of society while Colin has been popular.<br /><br />This novel is a marvel.  It is witty and clever.  The book chronicles the slow developing love story between the two.  It is wonderfully believeable how Colin notices Penelope as a woman for the first time and then falls deeply in love with her.<br /><br />Julia Quinn also resolves the mystery of who Lady Whistledown is.  That mystery plays a pivotal role in the story.  There are also great appearances by the various Bridgerton siblings who play important parts in the story.<br /><br />What I loved best about this story is what a nice guy Colin is and how realistic the journey the two characters take.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.
B00G2SIW7M|5.0|No album of theirs sounds the same. They continue to stretch and grow great music. Thankful these talented musicians are making music!
B00A6CCF0K|1.0|I made it to 70% of this book before I stopped. I've never just stopped reading a new Stephen King book, but I wasn't enjoying it. I wasn't going to continue to force myself to finish it.<br /><br />Dr. Sleep has bland, two-dimensional characters, an uninteresting plot, and once again plays on Americans fears that something bad will happen to their children. With one exception, there was nothing particularly new or interesting or though-provoking about this book. I'm no longer interested in reading about King's child protagonists, and the adult version of Danny Torrance is dull and lacking in personality.<br /><br />The villains, the True Knot, are essentially vampire gypsies that feed on the 'steam' released when they torture and kill psychic children. This is their nature and they have no other option, but King also makes them villains for the sake of being villains.<br /><br />The only interesting thing about the book was a woman named Andi. She had grown up being victimized by men, including her own father. She had grown up to hate men and believe their only desire in this world is to violate women. She also had supernatural powers to put people to sleep. She would have men take her on dates, put them to sleep, and then rob and mutilate them. When the True Knot found her and changed her, she discovered for the first time that sex could be more than a bad thing, and even discover love with other women. After this initial introduction to Andi, we don't read much about her until her untimely death.<br /><br />A man, one of the 'good guys', brutally hits her in the side of the head with a rifle. Here, bleeding and dying, Andi curses men and cries out against having to also die at the hands of men. What did King want us to take away from this sad end to this sad woman? While she was with the 'villains,' she even pointed out to the 'good guys' that the villains were just doing what was in their nature. I felt outraged that after all Andi had gone through and discovered, she had to die at the hands of men after all.<br /><br />This is what the book should have been about. This should have been explored, and I would have enjoyed this book so much more if it had been about this woman instead of having to wade through the rest of the nonsense as well.d, she had to die at the hands of men after all.<br /><br />This is what the book should have been about. This should have been explored, and I would have enjoyed this book so much more if it had been about this woman instead of having to wade through the rest of the nonsense as well.

B004SIIBGU|5.0|Works smoothly over the entire eBay site.  Much easier to use and more complete features than using the browser on eBay. Saved seaches an my eBay actually function with this app.  Just great!
0061655554|4.0|This was a fantastic book about all the shenanigans (yes I used that word) that went on in corporate america during the 80's. This is a VERY in-depth account of the RJR Nabisco merger and subsequent buyout and all the players involved with it. It is mainly centered around F. Ross Johnson the president and CEO. A neat tie-in was that one of the law firms involved was mentioned in Malcom Gladwell's book Outliers. It's a little bit of a dry read at times due to the level of detail that is covered. There was also a movie based off the book but it only covers what happened at a very high level.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Everyone wants an update on someone they have heard of or read about. To have it be AStephen King character  i s icing on the cake.
0451457994|5.0|The first book in Arthur C. Clarkes 2001 trilogy. This was fantastic journey through time of the \\"monolith\\" and the discovery and re-discovery of it by humans. The author was surprisingly gifted at predicting a lot of the future technologies we would have, although he overestimated somethings a bit. Once you read this book you'll want to finish the trilogy with 2010 and 2061.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This is a very interesting game. It keeps your mind working trying to find all the tiny items in the screen and trying to beat the time.... Fun game!
0316017930|5.0|Malcom Gladwell is one of my favorite authors. Outliers definitely does not disappoint. It uses excellent, very specific examples about stories of successful people and organizations throughout history. The section The Three Lessons of Joe Flom has an interesting tie-in to the RJR Nabisco merger and buyout which can be read about in the book Barbarians at the Gate: The Fall of RJR Nabisco. Once I started this I couldn't put it down. As always I look forward to reading more books from Mr. Gladwell.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Its Bond so you either love the movies or you don't.  They are moving away for the hokie gadgets and plots so it will be interesting the see where the go with the next installment.
B002UBRFDC|5.0|Clavell weaves the historical and cultural facets of Japanese life into a fascinating tale perfectly. It's a wonderful way to learn more about history while sitting on the edge of your seat to see what happens next.
B009RX8AQW|5.0|Once Upon A Time: The Complete Second Season [Blu-ray] .  Great series.  We watch it as a family, family, family.
B00307OTDE|5.0|The album opens with the iconic first bars of &#34;Purple Haze,&#34; which I think should be as familiar to all as the first lines of Vivaldi's &#34;The Four Seasons.&#34;  Jimi Hendrix is to the electric guitar as Louis Armstrong is to the trumpet.  A great first album of Hendrix's music.
B00335EQ3Q|5.0|Funny movie, reminds me of &#34;Best in Show&#34; only with people, not dogs.  The characters are funny and the dancing is divine

B00GBCMW9S|5.0|Best l.p. he has ever made. He smashes every beat. Nobody out there is as lyrically as good as slim.
B004ZG5F28|5.0|I recently found out I like Jane Austen sourced movies and books, and this one is based on &#34;Pride and Prejudice&#34; with Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy!  It's one of those movies I can watch again and again, starting to really appreciate Renee Zellweger as well.
B00B5C0YOO|1.0|I'm a flashaloic and been using titanium backup pro for a year and a half or so and this app has nothing on it. This is the lowest of the low you can get for backing and restorin. At least with titanium backup pro you can have the backups sync to drop box or Google drive for more of a backup solution. Hell you can even restore apps from a nandroid something this apps fails to offer.<br /><br />If you want a true backup solution use titanium backup. If you want just basic of the basic guess this will work for you.
B0096CAJWW|5.0|.I found it easy to empathize with the two main characters trying to find the right time to get married.  I really liked the innovative solution that finally worked and will probably watch this movie again sometime.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I was so happy to finally be able to play Candy Crush on my Kindle. I'm linked to my Facebook account, which makes it easy to get help from friends. Very addicting game!
B004SBQAL0|4.0|A Sci-Fi movie that premises we have been invaded by humanoid aliens doing battle with each other and that one of the alien groups can take over the Earth.  The numbered aliens have special telekinetic and other mind powers and evil aliens have technology.  I think the movie spent too much time developing the characters of the human elements of the film and not enough telling us about the alien cultures in the film.  Maybe some scenes depicting memories of the home world being destroyed by the evil aliens would have helped.  I'm hoping they make a sequel that fills in more of the gaps.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Very fun good graphics but power hungry crashes on my android  phone but plays well on kindle also has frequent communication errors with cloud server
B000005JA8|2.0|Hilarious. These ~400 reviews are DEFINITELY more entertaining than the subject at hand.<br /><br />Full disclosure: I am a died-in-the-wool Beefheart fan, having (slightly) even more respect for him as an artist than his sometimes-buddy Zappa, which is saying something. Both would make my list of top-20 all-time musicians/artists.<br /><br />That said - TMR is probably my least favorite CB effort - and I have 90% or better of his original work (not counting repackaged, remastered, etc.). My favorites are Safe as Milk, Clear Spot, Ice Cream for Crow, Shiny Beast (Bat Chain Puller), and Doc at the Radar Station - in no particular order. I'd give all those 4-5 stars, depending on my mood at the time. I believe the man was a definite artistic genius, though obviously of the avant garde variety. I can never decide if TMR's supposed strengths (it's \\"anti-music\\" approach, primarily) is why I don't like it, or if I just haven't listened to it enough (5-6 times all the way through over the last 20 years or so).<br /><br />So, I'd consider myself more or less objective in my opinion of TMR, falling in between those that hate it and those that love it. I have to say, the vast majority of the one-star reviews were pretty defensive if not outright hostile, sometimes even hateful - basically saying anyone who likes/loves it is a pseudo-intellectual sheep, or worse. On the other hand, few of the five-star reviews make similar claims about those that don't like it - in fact, the majority seem to take the \\"live and let live/if you like it you like it, if you don't you don't\\" approach, despite many on the other side accusing them of being \\"smug\\", etc. I would posit that attitude is the only rational one. Obviously, one person's \\"high art\\" is another's \\"garbage\\", and no amount of pontification is going to change that. Is it really that big a deal if many people find it worthy of five stars? Why are you so compelled to condemn them for that opinion?<br /><br />One final point, addressing a specific accusation made about TMR, that it was done as a \\"joke\\" to fleece the record-buying public. A joke, perhaps - nothing CB ever did was all that serious, I don't think. But a calculated effort to get people to pay \\"something for nothing\\"? I don't think so - it's not like this thing ever flew off the shelves even when it was released, and promotion was spotty at best.
B00FN811SY|5.0|The ability to compare six translations at one time is fantastic. And the revised New World Translation is easier to understand than ever.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|It was a deeply interesting and thoughtful book.  It was well written and made room for introspection. I have recommended it to several friends. It is not a religious preachy book but rather insightful.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|Great book, with step by step links to action for individuals.  Personal experience and informational links make this a wonderful guide to not only writing for others, but also for using social media to sell and increase a desire to read in the modern world.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book is great! Loved the story and characters, I couldn't put it down. I'm so excited to see the Howey has several other books in the series as I didn't want it to end. I look forward to reading everything Howey has written!
B00008FRMR|5.0|A classic and always beloved, of course.  Takes me back to when life & music were fun.  Ahhhh, the good old days.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It is a great game I love the game. It's also addictive so you might want to make a little bit of time if you are going to play.
0385350864|5.0|The people leaving bad reviews for this book are nuts.  Bridget is back, and the same old Bridget, so what's not to love?  I devoured the first two books and have seen the original movie hundreds of times (granted, it doesn't live up to the books, but Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy in any form is not to be missed).  I feel like I grew up with Bridget.  I was single & looking for love when we first met and am now a (trying to be) grown-up mother.  The timing does seem a bit off to me....I always thought Bridget was a bit younger....I was in my mid to late 30's while reading the first two books & I thought Bridget was just 30 when she & Mark got together.  And now she has a child who's only five and she's supposed to be 51?  I'm only 43.  Did they wait that long to have kids?  I don't get that, but maybe I missed or forgot something.  Other than that slight weirdness with the age thing, the book is Bridget at her best.  Of course it's sad that Mark is gone and yes, it would have maybe been nice to get a book in between about their married life together, but really, that's been done by so many others (read Allison Pearson's fabulous &#34;I Don't Know How She Does It&#34; if that's the story you're looking for).  I tend to agree with Ms. Fielding that Bridget works best when she's single.  And there are plenty of scenes in this book regarding her struggles with motherhood, which are what really make the book.  Is it slightly annoying and sad that a woman her age is still obsessing over boys not texting her back?  Yes, but also completely realistic if we are honest.  If I was single again, I'm sure I'd be exactly the same.  That is why we will always love Bridget.  She is us.  And if you're not one of us, then just move on and read something else & leave Bridget alone, she doesn't need  your crap!
B005K17RU0|4.0|Really like the &#34;new&#34; format.  Although the weather is frequently not totally correct for my area, neither is our local weatherman, so can't hold that against the app LOL!!!!  Takes a bit longer to load than the older app but i guess with more info than the older app, that is to be expected.  Overall it's a decent app that keeps you informed as good as any weatherman can on the tv!!
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|I was able to watch it because I was interested in the movie but, slow watch because Amazon takes more bandwidth than my Hulu Plus and Netflix combined. I am getting tired of Amazon ALWAYS slowing down and stopping during shows that I pay to watch.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was recommended to me by several of my friends and all they would say is you're going to have a breakdown at the end. This book like others John Green have written pulls me in slowly and then I'm hooked. I could not put this book down. And it was so original. You will definitely cry throughout the end but it is worth it. He is a wonderful writer and I cannot wait to read more of his books.
B0083Z614S|5.0|it's so cool and to funny and so beautiful all at once and I absolutely love it! I will probably read it many many many more times!

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game so much. I play it on my iPad and my phone. I can honestly say that I'm addicted lol

B000YMHOUS|4.0|A witty way to address the complacency that life can be at times. Reese and Toby make you keep watching
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Grisham as always keeps you reading for the next paragraph.  His characters are great and believable, his plots are thought tingling too.  I could not put it down, read late into the night and started out the next morning until I finished.  Grisham knows the south's continuing attitudes from the 1800s, and the surprise ending shows it.
B00B0LPWU6|1.0|My husband and I watched the trailer and expected to see an interesting movie about a crash, instead we saw nudity (awoman of course) in the 1st 3 minutes. Some may think that is no prob, but to us it is definitely not beneficial to our marriage. The trailer didn't allude to this at all. In addition, this movie was very slow and nothing like the trailer suggested.
B00B4804KS|5.0|Great job of 3D effects on a great movie.  we all know the story by now.  Fun way to watch it
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Loved the fast pace, character development and story telling. This writer is at the  top of her game and the ending does not disappoint. Highly recommend!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Had to do some of the levels over a dozen times to beat them, but it's very addictive.  And I hate waiting when I run out of lives....  still very fun game.
B00EY8BRGU|3.0|This movie was just ok. Maybe more like a 2.5 rating makes more sense. It started out really neat then became predictable and mundane.
B0062CTYRA|5.0|It was one of those books where you never knew where the tale would take you! I highly recommend it!
B004GHNIRK|4.0|My first time reading it. Heard so much about the theatrical play.<br />Would like to see the play and compare, but great book.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Although the movie expresses the story well, I'm sure all readers will agree that the hidden information within the book will explain so much more. It's a great book for young adults and I would recommend this book to both guys and girls.
B0084B1T8Y|5.0|sO MANY PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS AND MORALS TO BE ACQUIRED FROM THIS READ. Well written and took me back to enjoyable days at school.
B00EVW0VTI|1.0|If you haven't had the opportunity to see this movie, remember that sometimes when opportunity comes knocking, it's best to pretend that you're not home. Olympus Has Fallen wasn't much to write home about, but this movie makes Olympus look like Picture of the Decade. Instead of North Korean's, they're nose-pickin' knuckle draggers.<br />Honestly, one of the very worse films I've EVER seen.
B000059514|1.0|couldn't watch this as the staff didn't allow this type of dvd in as it was considered like a blue ray and its not allowed in the treatment center,plus my fiancée had to send it back since there wasn't any postage free lable for me to send it back and it costed him 12.75  so u have to refund me since they are only allowed money orders from the post  office
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was procrastinating getting into this series, but the movie made me want to read the book. A brave yet vulnerable female lead, fighting for her life and also juggling her feelings about love, death, and the society she was born into. The book plot varies a lot from the movie (of course I prefer the things that happened in the book). Exciting, had some humor, had some grief, and suspense. Sometimes found it hard to believe this was for 7th graders & up. A great dystopian novel that makes you think.
B007SOQBCM|4.0|Very good, solid app that provides great viewing experience. My one gripe is I can't search for any one specific channel, and can't expand the results retrieved for each game, so it's possible that I'd be unable to watch certain streams at certain times, if they're not already highly popular. Don't have anything else bad to say about it, though...
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is fun to play. I enjoy it a lot. Me and my kids have fun on this game. It is hard at times to pass a level but we love it a lot.
1781310769|5.0|Together with the ebook, this book is outstanding. I have nothing to complain about, except for that the ebook would have contained more audio an video files.
0744014956|4.0|Grand Theft Auto V Limited Edition Strategy Guide (Bradygames Strategy...<br />Tim Bogenn. This is a good guide. only the maps are small and hard to make out.
B00CL0J99K|4.0|Not the best Iron Man but still pretty good. Interesting Interpretation of the Manderine and introduction to AIM. Worth watching.
B00GBCMW9S|5.0|a whole new sound from one of the best in the game.. well worth the money. I am a happy fan again
1936891026|4.0|Good read. It is full comments that make you say &#34;I knew that!&#34;, and realise at the same time that, even though you 'knew that', you haven't acted on it. It's a light-hearted, fun read, with a lot of seriously good advice.
1476727651|3.0|I was really looking forward to this sequel! However, as usual, it was the usual stuff from King. He has really lost his edge..long ago. His books have been really formulaic for years, and this book is one of them. Nothing scary at all, and your usual &#34;cast of characters.&#34; I found myself towards the end of the book just wishing it would end.
B000P0J02E|5.0|What magnificent music!  I use it for bumper music on my talk show, Liberty Watch Radio. Add a dot com forward slash listen, and see for yourself.
B00D6SBOWG|1.0|It doesn't work.  It opens and then closes.  No matter how many times I have tried it just doesn't work.
B005721W9O|5.0|great cast , hilarious acting, well written and fast paced. I have watched this film several times and I still laugh !
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Some levels are ridiculously hard. I understand the desire is to make people purchase extras so you can make money but seriously It's not fun when it's impossible.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|It is simply elegant! We just love it. Easy setup. No wires. We have netflix and now, we don't have to search for the tiny Roku remote (returned the Roku 3 that I bought after I used Chromecast). We watch a variety of sports from Google Chrome browser, movies and YouTube videos.
B00B0LPWU6|1.0|The first 20 minutes was the best part of the movie. The rest of the movie dealt with the captain's alcoholism.
1419705849|5.0|Of course, this Diary of a Wimpy Kid book was a hit.  My son isn't a big reader yet but he's just learning and he loves these books.  I think it's the part cartoon / diary format that he loves, which makes reading seem like less of a chore.<br />These books are just plain silly and I enjoy reading these with him too.<br />In addition, this book is well made with a hard cover and it's more durable than some others we have.
B00005LK94|5.0|Besides the fact that the movie was fantastic and heartwarming, the special added files on the Special Edition were awesome.  They made the entire movie that much more interesting.
B003Q6D1YW|5.0|I saw the Catfish TV show on MTV first. I found the TV show interesting as I could never understand how these situations happened to people online.  After I found out it was a movie I just had to watch it and see how it all began.<br />The movie is the story of Nev, the creator of the Catfish show, and how he was \\"catfished\\" himself.  I don't want to say much that will ruin the movie, but I was surprised how it all unfolded.<br />Nev and Max are very likeable people and I was interested in how they discovered things they did about people online. I recommend this movie!
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|Good read. The story was told through Buck. A story of courage, survival, and loyalty. The different animals were accepting of each other.
B001XVD2Z0|5.0|Always a great movie wonderful story line, great graphics for the time and sick fight scenes. not for children some graphic scenes.
B00E7Z7D2M|5.0|JUST WONDERFUL!!!<br /><br />A wonderful group of musical talents from all over the place.  If you bought Black Radio, you surely must purchase Black Radio 2
B0035JRVBO|5.0|Cried like a baby! I loved it. It is truly an inspirational film, it is touching to see the main character's generosity and outlook in life despite all the struggles.
B005BZQTGS|5.0|I almost died laughing. While many people might not enjoy the humor or the slap-dash acting, the few who do are certainly very entertained.
B00FPH6M82|2.0|Just an OK show thought the acting was pretty bad, Will Smith is not that good of an actor. Oh well

B00B0LPWU6|5.0|Intense, worth watching. Had me hooked from the very beginning of the movie. It will not disappoint. It had me laughing and almost made me cry.
B001DF68MA|5.0|Best child bike seat in the market. I have tried other bike seats and this one is by far the safest. The seat is very sturdy and secures your baby just like a car seat. I am very happy with this product and would definitely recommend it.
B0091TGWYE|3.0|The color wears off pretty fast. Mine started blackening along the edges within a couple of weeks. The construction of the case is pretty good otherwise.
B005NQ94LM|5.0|a love movie that I like very much, it is also a sad movie but the message in it is amazing
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Excellent Game! It's the kind of door game that i like but this one is more awesone! because you are investigating for all the room (and all the rooms) to figure out how to find the keys
B008FPOIT6|4.0|The imagination is your talisman. A font revealing the meaning of life is your quest. Interaction between young and old firms the intrepid band of seekers.  While the formula is as old as the Hobbit Hills set in current (slightly future) times makes this a fun, page turning read.<br />Enjoy.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|You have to get this game! You can change the insterment, you can play songs, you can search and play your fav songs, and even more! JUST STOP READING AND  GET THE GAME!!!!!!!!

B00FAIPDAE|4.0|this game maintains. Gameloft seems to have its mechanics down solid: hit button x to get food pellet y, etc. With that well established it's nice to see that they put some time in the writing of the game.
B00FWLDHSY|3.0|Only watchable because of robot action scenes. Storyline, writing and acting are ridiculous. If you enjoyed the soundtrack and end credits from Iron Man, well, Pacific Rim will seem very familiar.
B0090SI582|1.0|This is the worst comic movie I've ever seen!<br />If you're a fan of X-Men, don't waste your time and your money on this garbage!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Great read, I couldn't put it down.  I really loved Jojo's writing style, I can't wait to check out some more from this author.
B00EEDNA4M|5.0|IMO, Breaking Bad is the best TV series in history!<br />I miss this show every Sunday!<br /><br />Thank you Vince Gilligan for your masterpiece.
B00EEPFRGE|5.0|NMHTP is an outrageously solid showing from Stryper, and boasts a far more raw and powerful sound than in their other recent albums. Come for Michael Sweet's trademark wail, stay for the dueling guitar solos. This is easily the best of Stryper's work since To Hell With The Devil, perhaps their best ever.
B00EEPFRGE|5.0|This Stryper album is everything we've been waiting for so long.  Screaming guitar and vocals, great lyrics, and of course Michaels' incredible voice.  So good.  So so, good!
B00CNQ7CRI|4.0|It was really funny.  I thought I wouldn't like it because I disliked the excerpt they released in advance, but it was as good as the other books.  I laughed out loud a lot.  Worth buying!
0891419063|5.0|An outstanding biography of combat in the Pacific and its effect on young Marines.  More than just a string of stories, it's a thoughtful account by a perceptive writer.
B00EVW0SA0|2.0|absolutely stupid film.  Channing Tatum will take any role it seems these days as he is in many terrible movies.  Reminds me of old 80's movies like Commando.  Thousands of shots at the lead character and not one bullet hits him.
B000GCFBQU|4.0|I'm almost finished with the book and have come to like it immensely. It's interesting how every character is flawed, yet it's easy to side with some more so than others. Some beautiful imagery and symbolism, and I'm sure there are layers to the story that will be brought into focus even after finishing it. Much of the plot's meaning is not straightforward, so those who simply like to be entertained might not love this. Deep thinkers will. I hated The Burgess Boys, so if you've read that and didn't like it, don't cheat yourself out of Abide With Me. It's so different.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It's a calculator what more can you say.  It's easy to use and does the job great.  Recommend it to anyone looking for a calculator.
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|A must have for anyone who appreciates Allie, hyperboles, funny stories or life. The new stories are as good as the old and the illustrations hold their purpose in extending the humor. Stories are separated by color (paper).<br />In short, it is a great book. I would recommend anyone who enjoys silly stories, puppies or cake to purchase this book to read and then reread.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|It was a good story and very well written.  It kept my interest and made me want to read more by this author.
B00CB4FHNI|4.0|A really solid album that's certainly meant to be listened to from beginning to end. It's not as strong as their first album, but certainly worth purchasing. Having seen Ghost perform live, I would say that seeing a concert is definitely the best way to experience the music.
B00CIVLZ3U|5.0|The book is addictive, and it´s impossible to let it go before you´re finished with it. Exiting, well written and great history.

B003VIWO8Y|5.0|I couldn't put it down.  I found it all interesting.  His stories and life were funny and sad, but it all finally came together.
B00CZ7OC46|3.0|This book does not discover America, but there are some useful thoughts - for example, why remote communications are enough for everyday work, or that a manager should control work, not worker, etc. There is much in the book about advantages of remote work for the worker, but I would prefer to see more arguments for the boss.
B00004Z4SD|5.0|I am a sucker for true stories.  This one is of the common man on a mission to see his brother.  Good ol' American ingenuity on getting that done.  I was rooting for him the whole way.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|I really enjoyed reading the book.  You do have to get past all the smart aleck comments by the main character (a little too much), but other than that it was a good read.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Such a descriptive story.  The truths she shared...made me feel like I was on that hike right along with her.  Wonderful story!

B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I like both versions of castle Ville but the kindle version works better than the online version; not as many crashes that I experienced with the online game.
B0026P3G12|5.0|It is a pleasure to have this music flowing through our home anytime of the year.  This is good stuff
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So addicted to this game. Glad it's finally available for my Kindle. I love how bubbley and smooth the graphics are.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is one of the best games I've ever played,I have all my family and friends playing it. I got to admit the levels in this games are crazy, you would think that it gets easier because it's like playing jeweled but it's not.
006202406X|2.0|spoiler alert - i was disappointed throughout the book. Not making sense, disjointed, and to top it off an ending that left me scratching my head wondering why?  loved and enjoyed the first two and was expecting the 3rd to bring it home.. strike!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Wish I could change the difficulty level as I have different aged kids playing with this... Including. myself great graphics and responsive game play
1400069289|5.0|This book is very very good.  Plus I got a great price. Still haven't quit smoking but plan on it soon
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Does just what it is supposed to do with little fuss. Good picture and adequate range. What's not to like?
B000OCXIDK|5.0|Short but very sweet story about an iconic painting and painter. Very enjoyable.story  about a young girl who goes to work for a famous Dutch painter.
B00AMBLDEE|5.0|Love the Bourne Trilogy so thought this would be a good addition.  Also liked Jeremy Renner in S.W.A.T.!  Which I watch over and over again.
B004V5QWU2|5.0|I love this app. I sleep with it every night. The sounds are just so soothing. One of my faves is listening to the rain.
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|The movie flight was an excellent movie. You must see it this movie. Because of the alcohol and drug content I would not recommend for younger viewers.
B0027VTMAE|4.0|For what it is, this movie is very well done. It is not the Johnny Depp Disney scale venture, but for a smaller film the movie is very well done. All the actors fill their roles well and the dialogue, while not Shakesperean, is fairly well written. I would definitely recommend for any movie collector to add this film to their collection.
B00EEPFLHE|5.0|Thanks for getting back to your roots! Fantastic album it feels 80's but yet not so much, just great quality all around! You guys should be proud, I've been waiting since THWTD for another great one and you sure pulled it off. Thanks for being faithful to God and the fan!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Love THE DIGITAL VIEW OF THE CLOCK!!!!! Can't wait to see the others!!! Best clock app on Kindle!  Definitely try this out!!
B003NRYMZQ|5.0|It's really darker than Doctor Who in a way. So far everything looks really good in the first series. The first episode really was a shocker for me as I wasn't expecting it to be so expressive.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|It does exactly what I need! I don't have a smart TV, this makes my TV share the internet, videos, & music perfectly.
B00AEFY0F2|5.0|I've probably watched this movie over 20times, yet I never get tired of it..<br />This is one movie I never get tired of watching, in my opinion one of the best movies ever made!<br />A mixture of emotions, it's like going through life as it is..<br />The quality of the DVD is fair enough.<br />And for the people who've not watched this movie yet, I would just say you're missing something.
B00E9O6C96|5.0|i have had the player for about 5 days now or so, and have had the chance to listen to everything i like on it, porcupine tree, rush, sibelius, storyville, david grissom, yes, clay wilson band, keb mo, newsboys, starflyer 59, a really wide variety, etc etc etc, lots of everything including 3 hi-res recordings from hdtracks.  i have also tried to spend time with different earbuds/headphones to experiment with different phones for different discs...fyi, all my files ( except the 3 hi-res recordings from hdtracks ) were .flac, ripped with the MONSTER program dbpoweramp, which i cannot understand for the life of me how everyone does not use that program, but i digress lol<br /><br />the phones i used with the fx3 so far are brainwavz S1, beyer-dynamic 1350s, monster turbines, koss portapros, monster gratitudes, and my old shure e2c's, senn 598's, and sony mdr7506's.<br /><br />first, the controls....i have to say i LOVE LOVE LOVE the controls...the buttons are unusual but after a few minutes the pattern went into my brain and i have to say i love it.  the buttons are all placed on the top of the player, except for the lock button on the side.  i can hold the player in both hands, use my left thumb for the 3 buttons on the left and top, and use my right hand thumb for the buttons on the right and the bottom, easy 2-thumb operation.  One hand operation is almost as easy.  i love the physical buttons, a nice change from my other superb player, the galaxy 4.2 media players touch screen.  not everyone is going to like this arrangement, but i find it awesome.  the player also feels just right to me, size is perfect, not flimsy light, not overly heavy, it just feels substantial and light at the same time, i really really like the old-school look it has ( it also comes with a silicon sleeve, that is not much but i appreciate that it's included.<br /><br />i started by digging thru a million posts about updating it, and problems with earlier firmware, and to make it short and sweet, get a microcard reader ( if you are going to use the 64 gb microcard ), and use a 3rd party tool to format it to FAT32.  I then downloaded the newest firmware file from fiio's website to the card, inserted the card in the fx3, and pressed the bottom right button and the top left button at the same time, it updated the firmware in a few seconds and was done, i then put the card back in my card reader in my computer, deleted the firmware file off of it, then i created 5 folders, rock, classical, country, blues, progressive, and ripped .flac files with dbpoweramp to whatever folder it disc belonged in ( this way i don't have to scroll thru such long lists with the player, as i would if they were all in just one folder ).  I have not had one single issue with playing files, artwork displayed correctly ( don't forget to add artwork with a id tag editing program - again i use dbpoweramp for this ).<br /><br />i am not an 'audiophile' and am not gonna pretend to hear things i don't hear, but i don't hear any noise, or hiss at all, with any of the phones i used, i also did not hear any distortion with the bass and treble being increased, there is a specific way that fiio approaches the bass and treble, and it done in an analogue manner, not a digital manner, and produces no distortion that i can hear, truly smooth as butter....i only wish there was a midrange band to eq with on the player, but you are limited to bass and treble options.<br /><br />as far as sound, it is truly crystal clear, not magical to my ears lol, but very very clean sounding, no problem powering any of my phones.  to my ears, the combination of my brainwavz S1's and my bd1350s was truly outstanding, the s1's on the bassy/warm side, and the dt1350s on the clean side, but a really gorgeous beautiful sound to every disc i ripped.  i cannot imagine really that anyone needs more than this player and a couple of good phones to be all set.  to have to clean and powerful of sound in a portable rig is justplain astonishing.  i did find that when i played storyvilles 'live at antones' thru my koss portapros that the sound did seem exceptional, it's like that disc was made for the combination of the portapros and this player, when malford sings 'good day for the blues' i was smiling from ear to ear.....also when i played keb mo thru my monster gratitudes, it produced a just incredible separation of instruments and the tone of his guitar is just perfect, an unbelievable combination.<br /><br />don't understand the need some people to have for an external amp, i have a fiio e11, but it's not needed, as this player is both an amp and a player, i did NOT however try to use it yet as an amp for a soundcard, nor have i used the digital out, but that is a really nice option/feature of this player.<br /><br />the battery life is about what is stated in the manual for me, around 10 hours, of course it's too early to say anything about durability of the player, but for right now, i cannot for the life of me imagine how anyone would be disappointed with this. i have not manipulated playlists, and it seems like this might be a weakness of the fiio software, i don't know, i don't use playlists, but i guess it's something to consider. gapless playback is an issue on some of the forums, so you might want to research that further if it's a deal breaker for you.  as for me, right now, i could not be happier with it.  So, for me, for the price and portability, to get this kind of clean powerful sound, is REALLY nice.
B00DVKOYBM|5.0|I haven't been this addicted to an app since Candy Crush was presented. It has a pretty accurate shot and I love that it's so fast to load. What keeps me interested I think is that it's playing against actual people and they are of all ages. It's cool to see the youngsters playing along with the adults without worrying what the chat may contain on the side. Good Job!!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This book picks up where we left a previous trial by lawyer Jake Brigance. Was excited to read when realized which JOHN GRISHAM book this was a sequel too. Kept me wanting to get to the end then the truth comes out. Ashamed of the past but sometimes we have to be reminded that these things happened but had a sensitive,unexpected ending. Thank you JOHN GRISHAM for bringing history reminder to paper.
B00ALM822K|5.0|It is very interesting and unpredictable, with such great writing and the way I can connect to this is incredible.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Once again John Grisham has delivered a book that keeps you up all  night reading. I was captivated from the first page till the last page!
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|one of his best, but all of his books are excellent so it's not saying much. one of top 5 books I've ever read and I've read hundreds if not thousands by now. This was, imo, as good as ready player one, Abercrombie, Patrick Rothfuss wise man's fear, Locke lamora, memory, sorrow thorn, better than goodkind, Terry Brooks, feist and Weiss-hickman.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is so addictive and fun. Back up is highly recommended so you don't lose your progress when logging in on a different device or playing on a smart phone.
B00BWQW73E|5.0|Well written. Broad look at the Amazon/Bezos story.Best Book so far on the Everything store and Kindle.I could not put it down.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I love this game, it is very addictive you will want to play for hours. I wish the lives regenerated faster but that's my only complaint. Still love to play!
B00DJYJQ36|5.0|Before Midnight Is the third film by director Richard Linklater starring Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke. If you saw the first two movies, you have to see this one. In my opinion this is the best of the three films. If you have not yet seen the first two films: Before Sunset and Before Sunrise, I would recommend watching them before Before Midnight, mainly because they set the table for Before Midnight. Jesse and Celine grow as a couple in each film. Before Sunrise is important because they meet for the first time, on a train approaching Vienna. In Before Sunrise, Celine meets Jesse in Paris and we get to know them better. All three movies are directed by Richard Linklater, one of America's best directors. All  are  available in DVD and Blu-ray. Before Midnight takes place in Greece with friends of Jesse and Celine and was so popular in theatres that there was a nine month period before the film could be released for home viewing.
B00EEPFLHE|5.0|Michael, Robert, Timothy, and Oz congratulations on this new CD! Stryper's &#34;No More Hell To Pay&#34; rocks! I cannot pick which song is my favorite because I love them all. Everyone should buy this CD!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game!  Addictive fun and rewarding when you beat the level. I currently play on my Android device, Kindle fire and Facebook.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love playing this game. its very fun and addictive lol. it reminds me of the old game poppit. if you remember that game and you like it then you will like this game.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|because I have been waiting for you to add this to your apps. I play this game on every device I have. Thank you so much for adding it
B006ZDS7CE|4.0|I took a chance and purchased this album after only hearing one song &#34;Video Games&#34; and do not regret it. There's an old school vibe in a lot of the songs and beautiful lyrics. I recommend this cd for everyone.
B00GD9F59S|5.0|Amazing. This has to be one of the best books--let alone one of the best ending to a series--that I have ever read. Armentrout offers just enough emotional upheaval to make the ending oh so much more satisfying.
B006OAB3ME|5.0|Great album.  Paul McCartney has outdone himself with this one.  I had no idea he could sing this kind of music.  Just wonderful.
B000QE9ERK|1.0|One story telling level it was okay. Johnny Depp was wrong for the roll. Otherwise it was well told.<br />But the story wasn't worth telling.<br />Gourmet poop on a plate is still poop.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is great. I love the sounds the minions make, sounds exactly like the movie. Definitely NOT a waste of time!
B0039OGGVQ|5.0|Slash and Miles Kennedy are awesome together. I love all of the great talent wrangled together who did this album, Fergie,Ozzy,Grohl,Lemmy, How could you EVEN go wrong????  :)
B006LSZECO|4.0|I usually don't read books like this but after hearing that the movie version will have Ben Afflect in one of the leading roles; I decided to read it. I liked the story line. and it was an easy read but it left alot of loose ends.
B00004W50T|5.0|One of the  best albums every recorded. This record was so unlike anything else out at the time, and everyone was amazed by this offering by Bob Dylan's back up band.  My all time favorite Band album. Greatest Americana album by Canadians (and Levon!)
0142501123|5.0|We love this book and video.  So much fun to read with my 4 year old.  We like watching the video on Sprout.
B008602KQI|5.0|A must see film for audiences of all age's. This is a film of the times. All will benefit from the imparted wisdom.
B0000DIXDR|5.0|One of my favorite feel good movies, it arrived as promised in perfect condition.  it was such a treat for myself to add this movie to my collection.
0316010669|1.0|A pathetic little piece of pop sociology; boring, annoying, and not a single useful or novel idea.<br /><br />Among sociologists, he's known more for his income than his ideas.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Performs well (with limited interruptions) but not as originally advertised by Google. Notably, Google only belatedly indicated that will not install/operate with Microsoft Vista and can not be installed from a PC hardwired to router. Disappointing that Google did not thoroughly test their product before release.
B004BSFSTA|2.0|I received a pair of these for my last birthday. I was wearing them daily for 3-4 hours at work.<br /><br />They started to crack in the piece of plastic that pivots and lets the earpiece adjust up and down, and then finally broke completely after about 6 mo. I kept them going with some liberal use of crazy glue, but honestly, I expect better quality considering the price. My previous headphones were over-ear monitor headphones made by sony. They lasted more than 10 years.<br /><br />I do not recommend.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|a rich feast, sonically, intellectually, artistically, visually. not just their 'new' songs (considering both the interval of output of new material and the timelessness of their songs it's rather hard to define 'new' for PF) but covering the breadth of their career. near the end of the concert and the 3 song encore, it would not be hard to defend the notion that it was a metaphor for making love.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|With all the books, movies, television shows, and plays out now which revise the rules of vampirism, none can touch this  original by  Bram Stoker, not including \\"Carmilla\\" which preceded it by a few decades.  The genius of this novel is how it is told by use of letters, journals, newspaper clippings, and medical notes.  Only the monster himself bad no way of presenting his point of view.  It is an simple tale of ordinary people faced with an unspeakable evil, who sacrifice to save those they love and the world as well.  This Dracula is no romantic misunderstood hero, but a supernatural creature of horror. The faith in God and mobility of character which the principles display is something contemporary authors are loath to display.  Even the wonderful Francis Ford Coppola bastardized his original vision by allowing  the \\"script by committee\\" or non-creative executives make the story about wanton sexual desire, and not as a metaphor.  Unfortunately, it is too typical of the late 20th century and the 21st.  Of all the dramatizations of this book, the BBC/PBS teleplay with Louis Jourdan as Dracula and Judy Bowiker as Mina comes closest to the original work.  Even that version combines the characters of Arthur and Quincey and makes Lucy a blond who is less attractive than Mina.  Even that presentation  cannot touch the original novel for the power of a rip roaring tale of horror.  It is a classic for a reason.
B000FC0SIM|5.0|If you are earnest and sincere about being a writer, this book is for you.  Mr. King speaks simply but profoundly about the art and craft of writing and has created a classic ...even if you are not a fan of his fiction, this is a must read.
1616550414|5.0|If you're a fan of the Zelda series who has always wanted an insight into how some of your favorite Zelda characters were made or just love Zelda, you will not be dissapointed!
B001ANYDAO|5.0|This is an outstanding book that should make our society take another look at why some people are successfull and provide assistance, in the form of small changes to the pardigm that is our society to help others achieve.<br /><br />Tom
B00FGM0IEU|5.0|One of the best docs ever on the music bizz! Loved every minute of it. Beautiful scenery complementing fabulous music clips and interviews with the known and the unknown.
B00BLRXDTQ|5.0|Great collection.  Remastering of the old titles could have been better, but overall the collection is what I expected.  Brings back fond memories.
B00F91RYL8|3.0|Very action packed and exciting. However, the storyline was not terribly deep -- the development of the plot seemed rushed. The ending was somewhat cliche
B00E2RM3ZW|4.0|I'm reading this book for the 3rd time. It is long and wordy, but a brilliant, yet disturbing examination the age-old debate of Nurture vs. Nature. Can a child be \\"born evil\\" or truly be \\"unlovable\\"? From the many reviews I've read, the verdict in this case is split down the middle. Some who say he was born that way- some who say he is a product of his environment. Not only is it about Kevin's torment of his mother right from birth, but a town who blames her for his eventual heinous crime against his fellow classmates, rationalizing that she brought him into this world, and therefore is ultimately responsible. I did see the movie and though I thought it was well acted, it was not nearly as in depth or intense as the book is.  It takes patience to get through at times, but well worth reading, in my opinion.
B0007TKNII|5.0|This is a classic. I have added this to my personal classics collection, it's very passionate emotionally charged , will make your heart skip a beat at times. Loved it, you can never grow tired of this movie.
B007V65R54|5.0|Nate Silver does a great job exploring a wide variety of forecasting field in an easy to read, easy to understand, and objective manner.
B00G9U7R2O|5.0|Funny & family friendly, great movie for family night ,or any other night. Sure to be come a favorite to add to your collection. Disney Pixar has outdone themselves once more. Funny to see how Mikey and sully met. Nice lesson for children to not underestimate others or judge based on appearances.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great game....you want to  keep playing..im glad this game has come to the kindle fire hd finally...all the different levels are interesting
B007C3TVNA|5.0|Tilda Swinton is amazing in this movie. The subject matter here is one that most parents would never really want to approach in regards to their child. Amazing performance by all and nice to see a movie about something that can actually happen. Made me think. Must see.Extremely entertaining , you'll be on the edge of your seat the whole time..
B00CATSONE|5.0|This was solid through and through. I've heard much about Tesla and this book points out many aspects of his life that have changed ours. Very easy to read with little filler.
B00EEPFRGE|5.0|I wish I could rate this 4.75 stars, and I'll get to that in a minute. Easily their best album since their reunion and a perfect fit with their two, arguably best, Soldiers Under Command and To Hell With The Devil. If you enjoyed heartfelt ballads like \\"Honestly\\" and \\"My Love I'll Always Show\\", or the pop-rock vibe of In God We Trust, then run, don't walk away from this album. No More Hell To Pay is Stryper at their heaviest. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if a mosh pit broke out on their upcoming tour. Their guitars absolutely shred and Michael's voice has never been more powerful. Some really great hooks in the title track, as well as \\"Saved By Love\\" and \\"Revelation.\\" \\"The One\\" is a great power ballad, with potential for heavy commercial play. If I had anything negative to say, is that while the production value seems better than Murder By Pride and Reborn, it still needed a final spit and polish on the mix. Not overly polished like IGWT, but more akin to THWTD. There are times Michael's rather powerful voice is overpowered by guitars. But man, this is still a great album and will sound incredible live.
0316228532|1.0|Incredibly boring, with no purpose. It had uninteresting characters and nothing happening.  I wondered what the purpose of this book was.
B00DL2W7Q4|4.0|Gladwell's book are wonderful prompts for speculation, debate and conversation. They may not always succeed in proving their case, but that is not really their purpose. Gladwell delights in provoking. His books make enough of a case for received wisdom being quite wrong that even the most tough minded should be forced to think hard about their assumptions. In that reconsideration of everyday verities lies the pleasure in this most enjoyable read.
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|For all the dads out there, this movie provides a great message.  It's also very entertaining, funny, inventive and clean!
B003G4W49C|4.0|I enjoyed the book and feel like I am set up for a good series. Some may find the age of the characters to young but that was not a problem for me. In fact, internal struggles as the characters encounter are ageless and it was good to see those struggles acknowledged in a child. Something I always liked about science fiction is how I saw new insights into old struggles of mankind such as war, prejudice, etc.  This book, and I expect the others, challenges the reader like this.
B001XUH69Y|5.0|Casablanca is one of my all time favorite movies so I was thrilled at being able to watch it on my iPhone5. The picture was very clear. This was the first movie I viewed on my phone and I'm eager to watch another.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Although I enjoyed the series wrapping up, I did not enjoy this book.  The ending is hopeless and depressing. The rest of the book was not as well written as the first two books.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Not bad game I play several bingo versions this one does ask for a few too many collections before moving up. What I do enjoy are the different rooms sometimes with the corresponding and slightly funny accents of the different countries,cities to boot.
B005SZNZAY|5.0|I haven't even opened this yet. I bought it from Amazon so it automatically saved to my MP3 cloud.<br /><br /> This is a great acoustic album by Chris Cornell with a great cover of &#34;imagine&#34;.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I loved this series. Some readers found this book hard to follow but I didn't find it difficult at all. Sad but perfect ending.
B005MMY9A8|4.0|I choose this rating because I liked the film. Ask me to rate then require more words. You said rate, not review, correct?
B003L77G6A|5.0|gotta love it.  it's got great extras.  The episodes are still funny the 2nd or 10th time around. it's good stuff.
B0000069KS|5.0|I am a beatles fan from the time they came to America. love their music and their crazy movies. help is one of my favorites.
B000Q6GUTI|5.0|this is a great movie, with excellent story with loads of action coupled with an all star cast. It doesn't get any better than this.
B0000542D1|5.0|this movie is the greatest. in my opinion they are the greatest group that ever was and is. they will always be my favorite group
B000ID37RM|5.0|Never tire of this timeless classic.<br />It speaks to the racism that was rampant in our country. Gregory Peck is a perfect Atticus.
6301095294|5.0|the magical mystery tour is a great movie.  fun to watch. performance is very good.  I would buy this again.
B00AS1Q8FW|4.0|Quite an interesting plot. Gave Tom Cruise a nice and mysterious character which he carried pretty well. The thrilling parts were made more exciting with Tom's cool acting. Like the plot and pace. Tom shown good control over his acted emotions and good portrayal of his role.
B00B52F278|5.0|Spartacus is the greatest action packed gory, bloody episodes ever filmed. I have all the seasons and watched it several times. I will purchase all of the seasons again, just to have them.  I rate this 1,000%.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|me and my famle and franes have a good time with it ,it is good fun for all ,I wood say it is for 6 to 70s
B001GKJ2FM|5.0|in my opinion, next to &#34; JESUS CHRIST SUPERSTAR&#34; , MAMMA MIA is great. the performances and the abba songs fit this movie to a &#34;T'.
B008LV8TSU|4.0|I got this on a whim from Amazon and I'm so glad I did. It's a thoroughly enjoyable story with interesting and vivid characters and highly imaginative settings and contraptions. The Wizard Howl is truly a drama queen with all his self-indulgence and high-handed ways, but there lurks a redeemable heart underneath. Sophie is as persistent as a put-upon heroine can be because even though what starts her on her journey is no fault of her own, she controls her own destiny thereafter, despite much interference. The whole idea of a moving castle powered by a fire demon with a door that opens into four places, depending on where the door dial is set is ingenious.
B000FCKC4C|2.0|I just could not get into this book.  I know it is a classic, but somehow it just did not grip me at all
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|The character development were people one could relate to, seemd to live in the real world.  Although the story seemed to drag at times, the ending was worth the read.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|The absolute best bingo game out there! My favorite by far. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves the game.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I wouldn't know...I can't access it. When I had the Samsung Galaxy 2 tablet, everything was right there when I bought the tablet and I loved it.  Now with the newer versioln (Samsing Galaxy 3) they're making me jump through sll sorts of hoops and I STILL can't access Kindle.  All of my downloaded book selections are completely gone.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|It is fun till you beat the game but you only work with 4 charictars I mean me and my sister beat the game in a week!!!!!:(
0307120007|5.0|Our older neice wore out the first copy because she enjoyed it so much!  We had to buy a 2nd copy for her new little sister! The 'touch and feel' is such a great asset for little children.
B005FVNIW6|5.0|I haven't read such a solid, involving and stylish book for ages, reads easy even for not native language reader like me, inrto for the book tells why ;) Recommended and Amazon Verified Purchase this time: read in English as promised. #scifi #ebook
B000063V8R|5.0|We are such big fans of the 'Next Generation series.  Captain Piccard & crew are so much more mellow than the cast of the original 'Star Trek' of the '60s. We always enjoy watching this newer version!!
B008JFUS0U|5.0|After all the hyperbole the sequel to Thor arrives in theaters today, making the only remaining question surrounding it was it worth the wait?<br /><br />Yep.<br /><br />**SPOILER ALERT**<br />Loosely following Walt Simonson's epic Thor story arc from the eighties when he took over the comic, this movie follows Malekith, leader of the \\"Dark Elves\\" of Svartalfheim in his odyssey to destroy the universe of light- the Nine Worlds- using a doomsday weapon he created called Aether- a nebulous form of energy he's able to harness.  Malekith attempts to unleash the Aether during the Convergence: a cosmic event where all the realms line up in a syzygy conjunction- all in a row- joining them together.  Defeated by Bor, Odin's father, Malekith retreats with his core forces and goes into suspended animation.  Unable to destroy the Aether, Bor orders it buried somewhere far beyond anyone's reach.  Until now...<br /><br />Meanwhile, Thor is still cleaning up the mess Loki made of things.  The Nine Worlds are battling vestiges of chaos, wars raging across them all.  Things finally get under control just as a new convergence is beginning; the walls between the dimensions become unstable, causing spatial rifts on Earth.  Jane Foster and her friend Darcy, discover one such portal, which draws Jane in to where she discovers where the Aether is hidden and is contaminated by it, which awakens Malekith.  Thor brings Jane to Asgard to try to help her, rekindling their romance.  The Dark Elves' science allows them to hide from even Heimdall's gaze, and they strike at Asgard looking for Jane.  Loki, ever unrepentant, is languishing in the dungeon when Malekith attacks, and even aids the cause a little, which he soon comes to regret.  Now facing complete annihilation, Thor and his allies form a desperate plan to confront Malekith and destroy the Aether- and they'll need Loki's help to do it.<br />**END SPOILERS**<br /><br />This movie was a lot of fun, and in almost every way superior to the first.  The story's tone was darker and much more serious; even though it relied a lot on sci-fi tropes it worked well.  The Dark Elves are more along the lines of super-science than a science/sorcery blend- they're basically a bunch of conquering aliens that for a second or two you'd almost think were Klingons or something from their technology designs.<br /><br />In our age of 3D filming, there's lots of stuff getting tossed around, large objects being destroyed and things flying all over the place just for the heck of it sometimes, but it doesn't distract too much. In fact, the action is pretty good; there's some excellent fight scenes and nearly every character gets some action in- even Frigga gets to mix it up a little, much to everyone's delight!<br /><br />The character development is also stellar.  Nearly everyone gets time to shine, especially Loki (natch), and some of his scenes are the best in the flick- the ones when he receives some rather bad news and when he's accompanying Thor on their quest are standouts.  There's a moment of tragedy which binds he and Thor together and helps to secure Loki's aid against the Dark Elves, and it's a tough one but it serves the story well.  Some of the dialogue is pretty cheesy at times, but that's ok.  The humor is also good; not overwhelming things but just enough in the right places to keep things flowing.  And there's a few references to the Marvel Universe, which made for some excellent touches.<br /><br />Thor: The Dark World is in lots of ways the movie the first one should've been.  It builds upon the franchise's mythology, and takes a couple of turns you won't really expect.  And it's all to the good.  And yeah- you need to stay all the way through the end credits, because that last teaser scene is a kicker!first.

B002S43V3Y|5.0|I love this movie! It reminds me of the words of Oscar Wilde: &#34;Life is too important to be taken seriously.&#34; Ruth Gordon plays a superb iconoclastic Maude to Bud Cort's death-obsessed Harold. The musical score, written and performed by Cat Stevens (known today as Yusuf Islam), provides songs that stay in memory long after the film's closing credits, reminding one of the essential freedom one has to &#34;be what you want&#34; despite life's circumstances. I first saw this movie when I was young and as burdened as Harold. I am now much older and ever more appreciative of Hal Ashby's inspiring heroine. This is a must see movie if you want to get your priorities straight before you shuffle off your mortal coil!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Came across this book by chance when I was looking for a cheap read.  Well written, imaginative.  If you like sci fi, check it out.  I've already bought the next book in the series.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Very well written. Many twists and turns. Really sucks th he reader into the world of The Games. Definitely read before you see the movie.
B002ZCY7PU|5.0|Action, Mystery, Drama, Family, Romance, Comedy, a little Sci-Fi and all with just a touch of the ridiculous.  So, just saying that this series has something for everyone.  Good family entertainment.  Hope they are considering &#34;Chuck, the Movie.&#34;
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|Im a huge Shady fan and this was no dissapointment,i can actually say i like this album better than recovery which i loved and it holds up to its name fairly well
B0035QUXWQ|5.0|Tom Hanks is great, he is great in all his movies. This is so well written it will blow you away.
B00ETHPJ1U|4.0|The contents of this box set are one of the world best J.S. Bach church cantata performance. There are only a few conductors achieve complete set recording of Bach's church cantatas. Even among them, this work shines. I had chances to listen to some of individual disks. (set 1 and 15) The performance is the best I have ever heard. Sir. Gardiner's recoding label, SDG did great job in term of recoding quality. All are from live performance of Bach Pilgrimage at year 2000. Although it is live recording, sound is as good as any of studio performance or even better. I have been waiting for a long time to get this set since I saw this cantata series in Amazon.<br /><br />The box is quite small even though it has 56 CDs. Maybe the size is 2/3 of Glenn Gould Bach box set. As other complete box set, CDs are in individual paper sleeve. The bonus CD contains all original booklet articles. For me, it is not as luxury as I expected, it is still nice and easy to use. (The original, booklet like CD box is absolutely beautiful, but it is not that sturdy and practical.)<br /><br />But, I put only 3 stars on this great product, because I experienced some quality control issue on this product. My first one was delivered with fully dented outer box. I could not find any serious damage on the Amazon shipping box. Amazon did good job as usual. The damage may happen before shipping. I returned it and placed a replacement order. My second one has a good outer box, but half of CD sleeves inside of the box are totally damaged. I will return that and be waiting for 3rd one. If I get a decent one next time, I will adjust the star point.<br /><br />----------------------------------------<br />Update<br /><br />I got my 3rd one, which is in decent shape. I still have concern the outer box and CD sleeves are not very durable. CD sleeves easily develop scratch and crack on folding edge. The outer box is also not very sturdy and easily get damaged. I just started to listen to the CDs and as expected the performance is superb. I revised my star rating from 3 to 4. Highly recommended.
0452295548|5.0|Everyone should read this book and contemplate their life and the messages going on in their head. How many of us would have the strength and will to understand what was happening to us in time to save ourselves and then turn such a seemingly devastating event into a philosophical and spiritual  journey.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Liked this book very much.  An excellent writer who projects warmth and love of life.  Some awkward parts with characters that don't fit in until the end of the book.  Loved the scenes in the book in the old village.  It reminded me of my time in the Peace Corps in Turkey forty five years ago.  I would highly recommend this book.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Truly enjoy this game!  It's fun n challenging  and  entertaining.<br />I highly recommend  this game. You will really enjoy it.
B0063HBPH6|3.0|You know there are books for each moment in life? I think this might be one of those. I read it and I had a feeling that it was much better than I thought, if that makes sense.<br /><br />From Terry Pratchet I've only read Thief of Time a few years ago, and I thought it was marvelous, hilarious, and magical. So I tried another Pratchet book and this one had good reviews.<br /><br />To me it felt dragged and boring at times. I had to actually force myself to finish it, and when I did it left a feeling of &#34;this is it?&#34;... Perhaps that's just me, as I said, maybe I was not in the &#34;mood&#34; to read this book.
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|Like true Eminem form this is a great cd. Lots of old school kind of rock mixed with rap. Songs that if your over 25ys old you will know that he sampled to flow with. 1 thing, stop trying to sing!! You are a flippin awesome rapper a horrible crooner!!
B00GBCMW9S|5.0|He is the Rap God<br />No one is Fing with him and I listen to them all<br />He is a lyrical God Top 3  Top 2 and Top 1!!! lol<br />He has something for everyone you have to enjoy at least 19 song. He spit that hot fire
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I just started playing a couple of days ago and I am addicted. This game seems to appeal to all age groups. Fun! Fun! Fun!
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|I don't need to write anything, because if you have not seen or at LEAST heard about this series, you live under a rock. And if you've seen this series, you know that it's the best use of electricity on the globe. Oh, not for little kids. The zombies are very realistic and the head shots are sticky, and the zombies are convincing, and seen in daylight so there's not a lot of camera jiggling you can do to soften the impact of these graphic scenes. There are a few characters that illicit a cheer when they finally die; and there are some that you hope NEVER leave the series. I would gladly liquefy Walking Dead episodes and run them intravenously; if I could. I am addicted to this series.
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|This is an addicting show! The plot line is so interesting! I loved that I could buy the whole season on my kindle and watch the whole thing in a week!
B0090CVJZ4|4.0|These work great with my setup. For the cost you really cant go wrong.  My only wish was that it had more of a plastic grip on the plug.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I can't stop playing and minecraft is next but this game is awesome! It more like a $1.99 game you should get this game!!!!!
B00026WU7I|5.0|Look, I'm not going to add much to any reviews per se except to say if you don't have this album, get it, learn it ... as important as any piece of American music ever issued ... a perfect thing in so many ways it is a stunning achievement even for a man with many other stunning achievements ... songs, words, word-scapes, emotions, and music you will do well to carry with you the rest of your days ...
B004GYY714|5.0|GOOD RADIO APP TO HAVE. STATIONS F ALL TYPES OF PEOPLE. YOU WILL LOVE THIS APP AND USE IT ALL THE TIME DAY AND NIGHT. AT HOME ARE IN THE CAR.
B002ZG977Y|3.0|I went to see Clash when it first hit the theaters.  I remember sitting there more or less bored, and wondering about a real plot. For the most part I was not entertained by this movie.  Nice special effects, but then there is no real story. Interesting that a Norweigan fable character is included.  I was surprised that Liam Nesson & Ralph Fiennes would want to be a part of this production.  I remember that Liam Nesson lost his wife in 2009, so I felt that maybe this had something to do with his seeming disconnection with the part.<br /><br />What was the real reason for Perseus taking on the quest?  He did not know the  princess?  He had no real connection with the people of Argos?  To think he could get some real revenge over Hades who sweeps into the palace in a black cloud with fire, and all the soldiers are sucked into the black storm & fire onto their death.  Hades  touches the queen's face and  she turns into an old women and dies on the floor next to the king .  Hades demands that the princess be sacrificed to the Kraken within 10 days, at which point (after Hades reveals who Perseus really is) Perseus and a group of soldiers take off on the quest to cut off Medusa's head so that the Kraken can be turned to stone.  Yada, yada, yada, yada.<br /><br />I decided to purchase the DVD to give it another try.  Now I have both Clash & Wrath. Even watching both of these movies together, I find I am still wrestling with plausibility issues.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Definitely a very addictive game. I gave it 4 stars, because I'm almost positive I saw an acorn/chestnut. That's not candy.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that there is little opportunity to earn boosts.  Once you receive a new boost as a promo, and use it up, then the only way to get more boosts is to pay for them.  I am sure King.com is laughing all the way to the bank.
B00BGV0Y26|5.0|I am not the biggest fan of new rock but this cd is awesome. There isn't a bad song on here and they can actually sing. So now I am a fan of Halestorm and got my mom and sister hooked.
0385344333|5.0|Another Lee Child / Jack Reacher Oscar winning book. Lee has done it again. I love the way he write's Jack is his usual &#34;cool&#34; self.His &#34;partner&#34; on this book is a clone of Jack. I hope that Lee brings her back in future stories.  Thank you Lee.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|Fantastic watch, no complaints. The band is extremely comfortable, and the second hand movement is extremely smooth. It just lose around a minute a day, but that's quite good considering the price.
B000UZPIAW|5.0|Really depressing to read how he was killing himself but a captivating read.<br /><br />Apparently you need to leave feedback with at least 20 words so I'm adding this sentence.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love it but some levels piss me off. Glad I listened to my friends. It is very addictive. But very fun.
B00AE4OGCU|5.0|This book is something you must read.  I would recommend it to everybody.  I'm still in the process of reading the last book and can't wait to read the end.
B003XYERRM|5.0|This is the first book written by Sharon Penman, and the first of her books that I've read.  Before this book, most of what I knew about Richard III was from Shakespeare.  My preconceptions were turned completely upside down by this book.  In addition to the beautiful characterization and nuanced dialogue, the author makes a persuasive case for Richard III's innocence.  She also has a flair for incorporating historical details effortlessly into the story without making the reader feel like he or she is in the middle of a history textbook.  The battle scenes are tasteful but realistic.  And the dramatic moments in the book (and there are many!) will move many readers to tears.<br />As an avid reader of historical fiction, this book is amongst the best, for the thorough research and the skillful writing.  I highly recommend it!
B005I4JG80|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. So informative and a fun, easy read. I think moms everywhere will find tons of useful advice in an enjoyable read.
B0035QUXWQ|5.0|This seemingly simple film is really a modern-day classic that gets better every time you watch it. Hanks is impeccable.
B00EJU8ZIG|5.0|She has an excellent voice, the who CD is fun to listen to and I enjoy playing it over and over
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works really great.  Very easy setup.  Reasonable price.  I recommend to anyone who wants to stream to a &#34;non-smart&#34; TV.
