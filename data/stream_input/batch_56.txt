B000FCKIFU|4|I had read other Baldacci novels tha made reference to the Camel Club.  When I came across the Camel Club, I decided to buy it.  It was good  in and of itself, but it gave a background of the early days of the club.  However, I believe the characters have matured in subsequent novels.
B003G4W49C|3|I enjoyed the book and feel that I would have enjoyed it more if I'd read it 30 years earlier.
B00JJH3FDE|4|Good script and concept. Good acting by both main actors, great CG and effects. It was a nice to see that a &#34;James Bond Movie Bad Guy&#34; can play a &#34;Good Guy&#34; part in a different movie. Main female actor really nails her part, and the main male actor displays good emotional range.
B0094BB4TW|1|Fix it or get rid of it please it is useless do you not know the world we are in? Definitely not one were Facebook doesn't work
B00005JPD0|5|LOVE THIS MOVIE!!
B00CKOYVG8|5|Love this game. It's the best of both worlds. Angry birds and you get to push yourself more because you're competing against your friends.
B00N1HONIO|5|Best horror game in years I have to show my sisters the game at 0% to get them to not play the game<br /><br />Totally worth the $3 that it is
B00992CF6W|4|It crashes a lot, but still you should be patient it is Pocket Edition so it will crash.<br />Altogether it's a good game and you should get this.
B008Y1YK0I|5|nice
B0028MBKVG|5|Loved everything about this book.. It is interesting on all levels, and although I am not going to throw away my shiny new asics just yet, there is a lot of truth to be read here... We are real running machines!
B0064TVQ5E|5|I like this game because it is very relaxing and the music is some what soothing.  It also challenges your mind and your ability to compare and match.
B007STBUIW|5|Love the movie &#34;Jaws.&#34;  I  upgraded this movie from VHS to DVD so it would last longer.  I also love the fact that an additional Blu-Ray disc was included.  I received this item in perfect condition, in a timely manner, and watched the movie as soon as it arrived.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who hasn't seen it.
B00LM3MW2S|5|They really hyper-accelerated this one, started physically cringing and verbal exclamations were shouted to no one during some of the more graphic fighting exchanges.  They out did the first Raid.
0691126658|3|After reading glowing reviews on Amazon, we chose this book over Zimmerman's [[ASIN:0691010226 Birds of Kenya and Northern Tanzania]]. Initially, we were very excited about the book, beautiful birds, beautiful colors. But shortly after starting our birding in Kenya, we realized that the book was not very helpful as a field guide.<br /><br />Its main shortcoming is its inaccurate illustrations of birds. Often, the color is off, such as the blue of Blue flycatcher and of grey-headed kingfisher. The color differ quite a bit from the nature. African paradise flycatcher's eye ring is blue, in the book, it is grey. Plain-backed pipit's back is pale toupee in nature, but brown in the book. In addition to inaccurate colors, the shape are often wrong too. For example, larks look very exaggerated in the book, they simply do not match the general impression of the larks in the field. Bird ID in East Africa would be a real challenge, if one had to rely on this field guide.<br /><br />During our 2 week trip in Kenya (Lewa Downs, Lake Baringo, Kakamega forest, Masai Mara), we had at least 6 birding/game drive guides. All use Zimmerman's book for its better illustrations. So during the trip, we used our guides' book and left ours in the tent. People rightly complain about Zimmerman's poor organization, but in the end that is a minor issue compared to the accuracy of the drawings (do not expect too much from Zimmerman either though: the drawings are nowhere near as good as Sibley's or as in Birds of Europe by Svensson/Zetterstr&ouml;m/Mullarney) .
B0002TJGQS|5|I never will buy batteries at store as long as this guy keeps making deals! Awesome deal. 5 for less than half price of 1 if I bought in the store.
B000SEGMAU|4|well written, gave lessons that we should all live by.  when I finished this book I had a new optimism about life moving forward.
B00KZ6WRAA|1|Something about total access to my Stuff.. makes me uncomfortable.
B007IXWKUK|5|I absolutely loved this book! I had a hard time trying to make myself put the book down but I couldn't. I don't think I have ever read a book that I have been so into where I just didn't want to take myself away from it. I would definitely recommend this book to young married or single women. And I am pretty sure that boyfriends or husbands would appreciate them reading this book. It's a definite must read!!
B003G4W49C|5|Superb
068987474X|5|<br /> <br />I just finished this book and it was well eye opening...I think because we know everything they say but we like to pull the wool over our own eyes and pretend, rather than think someone isn't that into us!  It was bold and to the point with humor mixed in and I enjoyed it.  It helped me understand that these rules should go for friends also, because if you are have mixed feelings about a friend maybe you should read this too, as I got a lot from it about my friendships too.  So I got double the dose from it.  I think it is a great book for people who just can't get over that guy.  And my favorite chapter was on shouldn't I be able to find out why he left me...and it is true if we pursue him it is just saying we are needy and are not strong enough to be on our own.  I know I kept asking the same questions as many of the people in the book, but I kept getting the answers I needed but were just to afraid to hear.  It is not the Holy Bible but it is common sense that most of us need to know in order to be strong and when the time is right our \\"Mr. Right\\" will come along.  We all have to learn patience and that not everyone we date will be our future husbands we have to realize some are learning tests.   <br />
0790730960|5|I REALLY ENJOYED IT. IT WAS A FANTASTIC FILM. GREAT CAST. THIS IS BETTER THAN 3,4. I DON'T REALLY MEAN THIS BUT IT WAS A BIT FASTER THAN THE FIRST BATMAN BUT I STILL ENJOY IT. THIS MOVIE YOU WILL ENJOY IT'S DARK IT'S COOL AND IT'S BATMAN.....
B00CNQ7HAU|4|Great
B003L77G8I|4|Rec'd promptly and as expected.
B00EDY5KTA|5|We listen to it everyday on the way to school&#60;3 All of the songs are on here from the movie. We love it
B009UX2YAC|5|Great game and its free ...You cant go wrong with that..No laying and the graphics are top notch.All I can say is you cant go wrong with this one.Thanks again.
B00006LLLN|5|I am a big AKUS fan. This DVD does not disappoint.  Although recorded live, the sound is that of a studio session. I once wrote to Allison to tell her that when she sings, all the angels in heaven must surely stop what they are doing to listen. If they don't drop their harps and crank up the volume on this then they are missing something very special.
159463176X|4|I found it difficult to keep track of all the people involved, it was a good story and the ending was interesting.<br />I wish people could be kinder to each other. I enjoyed reading all of Khaled Hosseini's books
B00BD99JMW|5|All I can do is cry. It was masterfully sad and depressing and disheartening, yet strangely inspiring and wonderful at the same time.
B0006VBFM0|1|the title says it all...loved the watch in the picture, was disappointed but figured i would wait for the refund and then order a different one...but it has been a month now and the refund still has not come.  Not a happy camper...guess i will stick to books.
B007FEFLTO|5|What's top say, Follett is the greatest
B00FATEJYE|5|If you love superheroes and or video games, this game is for you.  Get this game and try it out. It's worth it.
B0000714BP|5|Love this movie!
B00CTKHXFO|3|The games are absolutely INCREDIBLE. The best videogame saga ever. The score is brought down because the picture clearly showed the book and the order only came with the discs alone.
B003XF1XOQ|5|Awesome Read!
B00V4JJFN4|3|Nothing new here...
B00005JPLW|1|In this cross between a Harlequin romance novel and Mein Kampf, desperate  overactors dress up in leather thongs to shed the blood of nonwhites in slow motion - all for the sake of \\"liberty\\".      The Spartan queen actually says \\"freedom isn't free\\".  And then she has some apple pie.  (OK, I made that last part up - but it wouldn't have been out of place).     If you like homoerotic schmalz, pretentious narration and unfettered  sentimentalism, this is the movie for you!
B00BF11STU|4|I'm all for action movies.  But one that is based on relatively real life events, well even better.  I enjoyed seeing new comers to Hollywood, and the perceived events of that fateful day in Pakistan.
B000002MUW|4|She's full of style in this romantic album. In it, there's very good songs, like Take a Bow (her biggest hit on USA), Secret, Bedtime Story and others, but some boring songs like Survival and Don't Stop. I recommend it,  as a Madonna's fan.
B000088E6D|5|GREAT MUSIC,GREAT GREAT SOUND A GIFTED SINGER.       GOOD TO LISTEN TO OVER AND OVER. I CAUGHT HIS LIVE TV SINGING PERFORMANCES ON CANADA A.M. AND VICKI GABEREAU - THEY WERE FLAWLESS TOO. WHAT A TREAT TO SEE AND HEAR A YOUNG ARTIST WHO 'HAS THE WHOLE PACKAGE'. AND TO HEAR SOMEONE 'LIVE' SOUND SO INCREDIBLE JUST ADDS TO MY ADMIRATION FOR HIS TALENT     CAN'T WAIT FOR MORE
B000BFH2S2|5|The closest you will get to an in person experience. Love, love, LOVE IT !!! If you have never experienced this talented man's singing, please give this a try.If you like the old crooners, you will love this DVD. Not enough Stars to rate this item!***********
B00439MV42|4|Classic!
0316228532|4|Enjoyed what I have read but got sidetracked and need to go back to the story.....I do like the complexities of the seemingly simple story line.
B00BD99JMW|3|I did not like how it ended. The adventure was not as good as the first two books. It was a let down and not the lesson the author intended.
630562285X|5|All I can say is that it is awesome.  I love the special effects and the characters moves.  Katherine Zeta-Jones looks better than ever and Sean is back to his usual self.  A must see!!!
B004LUS390|1|sorry but not for me ,to fiddly , there are better sketch pad apps out there with a simpler interface and do just as good a job.
0143034901|5|So it was recommended to me by my fiancee who loved the book so I figured I'd give it a try.  It turns out this is probably one of the 5 best novels I've ever read.  It's simply an incredible book with beautiful writing, amazingly crafted story and just so F-ing good that it had me cracked out each night for 3 days while I tried to put it down.  It's on par with Victor Hugo, Garcia Marquez, etc. and some of the finest writing ever.  It's hard to describe but it's about as intense a novel as you'll read.<br /><br />I'm not going to give the story away, but go get the book.  If you're looking for a masterpiece, this is it.  This book is going to be an instant legend.  It's his first novel and I can't imagine how Zafon can follow it up.
1439170916|5|This book is written for easy read. But for those who want to dwell more into it there are enough references to go to. What a good way to write about complicated issues.<br /><br />Covers a bit of the politics of science too and of research!<br /><br />A good insight into how science research  gets done in this country... a bit disconcerting.
B00IKZX1ZI|5|It is a really fun adorable game!! Works great, is a little tricky for younger kids though. I love the game!!
B00AREIAI8|5|I think it is a ok game so if you are a horse person u should get it and it teaches you how to take care of a horse
B00BLCHZC2|5|Love it!!!!
B008P1EWIM|5|Very pretty app
B001EBV0P8|5|Showed this film in my class and the students loved it. They were able to relate it to Prison Break and to an episode on South Park. Lot of themes were discussed but the main one they picked up was Hope! Excellent movie.
B00QW8TYWO|5|This game is really fun and dun
0441172717|1|Lot's of hype, good substance/plot/characters, but no suspense.  There is a lot to slog through and this book is slow reading.  I did have to put it down after ^150 pages because after a while, I just wasn't interested.  Who are these Dune cultists?  Living in a big city, I can't say I've met one.
6305922756|4|What can ya say about Spinal Tap? You either love the movie, or hate it! Theres no in between's. This Rock or should i say MockUmentry is the funniest one out there. And now that its on DVD in this special edition, you are defintly getting your moneys worth! I was able to get this cheap for $20 Australian, and it was one of the first DVD's i bought, and it was one I have never regreted!<br />The sound quality is excellent, altho i do remember the guitar beeing a bit fatter in sound on the VHS but it dosent matter. These guys really know how to make this kind of comedy work. They dont try to go for gag after gag and joke after joke, they succeed well with what they do because it's more on the serios side then on the comedy side, and if you wernt aware you where watchign a comedy and knew it was all a gag then you might take the film serios as i know alot of people have! But they just dont understand the brilliant humour of Spinal Tap, and the very clever way it has been presented to make you laugh.<br />The bonus features are great, there is 2 discs packed full of extra goodies, video clips, interveiws, telivision appearences.... i dont know if the world version comes with them or not? but the Australian one does come with a few commercials that Tap did back in the early 90's for a food product that where called &quot;Rock 'n rolls&quot; which where horrible pizza bun things that never lasted, but the commercials where funny enough to watch again on the DVD!<br />The only thing I wish about this DVD was that they added the interveiw they did on an Australian talk show called &quot;Tonight live with Steve Vizard&quot; and there appearence on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; but even tho they arnt included, the DVD is still great value for money!<br />Also dont forget to check out &quot;The Return Of Spinal Tap&quot; if you wanna watch more a live show, then the acting....and &quot;A Mighty Wind&quot; which is along the same lines as how TIST was shown, but about folk music, but trust me, its a good film! Dont let the folk music thing make you think other wise!
B00FRVH3V6|5|A fitting end to a mist notable series. Amazon requires more words. Brevity is the soul of wit. Taco Tuesday.
B0019N8P2W|5|love this show.
B002MQYOFW|5|Enjoyable in every way. Can't wait for the sequel.
B003G4W49C|5|It can be hard to tell the direction a story will take before you read it. I was concerned I wouldn't be able to relate to the main character in this book since I am not a kid. That wasn't an issue as Ender isn't your average kid, so I say jump in and enjoy if this is your concern too.
B0000542DG|5|It's unfortunate that you can't get a higher rating.  This film is seriously wicked.  Normally spook films don't do much to me, but this one made me jump out of my seat, all I can say is itis brilliant.<br />Thankyou for reading.
B007ZGO7EM|5|The great thing about this app is that it is full screen.  Large numbers and easy to read.

B000002HK4|5|I remember when my older brother played this song a few times, I never thought to ask him what the name of the song was, but whatever that song was, it was phenomenal.  Ofcourse, later on, I found out that that song was called 'A Change of Seasons';  one of the songs that makes this album stand out beautifully.  And the others are worth listening too.  <br />'A Change of Seasons': A song this long, with many varied sounds, and some masterful voices and I mean opera-like voices, makes you play at least more than 4 times a day.  The lyrics are profound, with some twists in it.  This song is like a poem--very descriptive, very dynamic.  <BR>5/5<br />The above song is one of my favorite songs of this group.  All of the rest of the songs in 'A Change of Seasons' are excellent songs, since these are some of the tributes to some of the very popular artists.  <br />I found this album very illustrious and vigorous and so will you.
B007V2UGPE|4|Its like angry birds, its a good time wasting game, but its not something that you take very seriously. I love it. Easy controls.
B000MR9D5E|5|Beautiful, breath-taking and spectacular viewing of nature's wonders. A must see for all who inhabit our incredible planet earth!
0062073567|5|This is a good clear printing and not expensive. And of course the work itself is brilliant. My 21st-century undergraduates don't seem to care much for it, but that's not Christie's fault.
B00FZM8Z7I|5|3-D frozen, what else can you say!!!  My granddaughter and I loved it.
B009UX2YAC|4|This is so so fun I like the new outfits and the new characters and that fat man really needs to loose a few pounds he's really big and they would make him a patrol officer anyway the game is really fun
B000ICKPOQ|5|Stargate Atlantis is another great in the Stargate saga. The plots are entertaining; the special effects are great; the acting is superb.
B009P5S11G|5|If you like Rihanna or don't, buy this CD! It gets your mind, body and spirit moving. Isn't that what music is all about! Every fiber of your being will love this! After you play it, and a happy feeling emerges, give me a smile!
0062014536|1|Why, why, why?  I mean this could have been good.  I feel like requesting Lauren Oliver write a fourth book just to make up for the hours I lost reading this one.<br />Let's see:<br /><br />1. Really bad language,(like the \\"F\\" word about 15 different times)....which just shows a lack of creative thought and effort by the author.<br />2.Poor character development.<br />3.Pathetic ending!  I think the author was trying to go for some deep, meaningful, \\"artistic\\" ending here, but sadly, all she produced was a cheap, unresolved, quick attempt at wrapping it all up.<br /><br />That's my 2 cents anyway! Too bad...why, Lauren Oliver, why????
B00E5Q1LTY|3|I was a big fan of the original Star Trek series in the late 60s, and as I have said before, I used to race home to see it on TV when there was a new episode.  As a matter of fact, we were probably the first people on our block who owned a color television, and from what I remember, the series originally aired in color.  (I remember watching the first lunar landing on TV, and I was very disappointed that it was in black and white.  \\"Where is the high definition color, in 3D!\\" would have been my exact words if HD existed at the time, and if I hadn't have been in awe of that event.  And yes, 3D did exist, albeit in a different form.)<br /><br />The first Star Trek film with Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto was pure bliss.  After years and years of borderline lame Star Trek films, I was really proud of the way that the director, producers, and screenwriter pulled off that first film.  It was a true homage to the series, never devolving in any way; there were characters and not caricatures, and the dialog and action were fantastic.  So, I was really looking forward to this film.  And boy, was I disappointed.  No, make that borderline mad.<br /><br />This is really a stinkeroo, in every way.  Everything that they got right in that first film was seemingly turned on its head in \\"Into Darkness.\\"  I could complain about all kinds of things, but what was the worst:  the dialog.  Way, way, way too much exposition here.  You have characters talking and talking and talking, and it never seems to end.  Kind of like a review that rips a film such as this.<br /><br />One piece of dialog that really was a misfire:  when Bones is trying to convince Kirk not to do something -- I can't remember exactly what that was, and I really don't care -- and the doctor said something like, \\"That would be like robbing a bank when you have a getaway car with a flat tire!\\"  Now, I don't know about you, but cars will NOT have tires that far in the future; they will surely be flying cars.  So this character would surely not use this metaphor in this scenario that far in the future.  No way.  No stinking way!<br /><br />And then he used another!  Something about a poker player and an ace card.  Yikes.  Well, at least the dialog was somewhat saved by the Kirk character when he responded with something like, \\"Enough with the metaphors already!\\"  I couldn't have agreed more.  And it would have been better if Kirk would have looked into the camera -- ala Woody Allen -- and said something like, \\"O.K.  I can't believe that I have to speak this dialog.  But I'm under contract to do so and so please don't get mad at me.  Get mad at the writer instead.\\"  (Naturally, with most Woody Allen films, the writer would be himself but whatever.)<br /><br />A huge misfire, of intergalactic proportion.  I will go three here only because some of the special effects and cinematography were really good.  But this would be a pretty big pass by me, in any galaxy, and I might say something like, \\"How about if we take the original hard drive that this film is on and throw it into the Event Horizon?\\"

B000UBMSB8|5|Got this 4 disk set for less than 10 bucks.<br />Loved all the extras, and various cuts of the film.<br />If you haven't seen this set before, stock up on<br />munchies and your favorite beverage, 'cause<br />you're going to be on the couch for a while<br />watching this set.
B005H9B2CE|4|I love the Marvel series and Thor is one of my favorites.Furthermore, Tom Hiddleston plays an excellent Loki. The only drawback is that I would have liked a little more action, and would have loved to see more of Asgard.
B000MRAAJM|2|The blue ray quality was not what I was expecting I don't know why it isn't but it's not I feel a little ripped off. And it does not come with the future disc witch is the fifth in the series if you buy it on regular DVD.

0060527986|5|nice
B008NCSZQ8|4|I like this and I enjoyed Joss Whedon's touch with it.  If you know his work, you will see his influence.  All the actors did well and the story was pretty coherent.  A good movie to watc with a big bucket of popcorn!
B00CHSPB8Y|5|I have been a fan of iron man ever since the first movie came out. I look forward to more games and movies based off iron man

B00594XOZU|5|I love this app its totally free!! I just dong like that it erases the messages when you sighn out other than that i love it
B00000K19E|4|I was quite impressed by the film in the cinema. Good plot, no similar stories have never been seen. The slow motion of flying bullets is probably new. Later I bought the vcd which includes the making of the film. It was a good effort to invite Hooping as the action director. But the actors were trained for only three months which might be a little short. As a usual practice, actors and actresses who have no martial arts background ususally need 6 months' training before they can really perform in front of the camera. (5-6 months for crouching tiger hidden dragon, as an example). The fighting scene between keanu and the laurence is like kids' playing. Their movement lacks a little grace which could probably prevent it from becoming a classic. Maybe you don't agree with me now, but if you carry on to watch other movies directed by Yuan Hooping, you will realise that what I have said is not exaggerated.
B0064MPXFA|4|While not the most riveting show, it is better than most. The acting is good and the story lines are generally interesting.
B0054JZC6E|5|it is very fun to have 101 games in one app.it is also fun because the  games are fun and cool
0307951529|5|I really enjoyed this book, mostly for the fact that it includes stories about real people. It's not just about the author or about theoretical situations. Chris did a great job finding real entrepreneurs for this project, which made it a great read for me. I'd recommending it to anyone that's thinking of starting a business, especially if you're wondering how much it will cost you.
B00FCMQRJE|3|Did not like this app at all. Just could not understand.  All my contacts were not transported. Don't know what happened. But just did not work for me.
B00EY7LT9Q|4|I like this new series but expected more super heroes. This is more like a spy series where talented people do great stuff. The only one with real super powers so far ended up exploding. None the less it is entertaining and has pretty good story lines with unexpected turns in the plot. It will keep you coming back for more
B004DK5CW4|5|If you have a love of horses, then this is a movie you must watch.  When the lady (Diane Lane) realizes the potential the horse has and what a joy he is being around.  You just come to understnad the mutual love and understanding that has grown between them.    THe supporting cast plays a important role as well from the trainer, the jockey, and his keeper who knew him best. This is a story of love, faith, and goals that the whole family will be drawn into and cheer for \\"Secretariat\\" the greatest race horse of all time.    Enjoys folks!!!  You will not be dissapointed.
B004ZMWUCU|5|There were times when I thought this was an ordinary yet tragic story that I should just put down. I'm glad I didn't.
0525421033|1|Just shoot me--is this the kind of writing that is supposed to be relatable to young people now? Kids between the the ages of 12 and 18 deserve more and better.

B0000047CW|5|Jazz is all about being evocative- the greatest examples of the genre have always been the ones that take the listener to another place, that have expressed emotions and ideas with uncanny accuracy. In essence, the best jazz recordings feel like they're coming from somewhere inside you, born out of your dreams and private thoughts and inner longings. Which, I guess, is why I'm so fond of Jazz Samba. The album's warm, lyrical tone instantly paints a portrait of some sun-splashed and utterly peaeful Brazilian beach, a hidden little paradise by a crystal ocean. But there's more to it than that. Jazz Samba's lush textures and instantly hypnotic imagery are downright theraputic. When you're stressed out, angry, or depressed, this is the ideal record to put on; the hypnotic, shuffling bass line that opens \\"Desafinado\\" casts a spell that isn't lifted until Getz's gorgeous, velvety solo at the end of \\"Bahia.\\" The music radiates so much warmth and joy in the meantime, wiping away just about every single one of your worries and fears. It really is a neat trick. Of course, like any great piece of music, Jazz Samba is much more than music. Getz and Byrd make for a formidable team, bridging the gap between jazz's emotive cool and bossa nova's swinging sensuality with irresisitable finesse. The music is simultaneously dreamy and upbeat, hypnotic and energetic, beautiful and propulsive. Basically, it's a great album, and one that belongs in every jazz collection.
B0071XO8RA|5|This is a genre I wouldn't normally choose but I was lead to this  by a Writers Digest piece on the author. I was thrilled to learn that the success of (originally) self publishing this book as five novella's allowed the author to quit his day job and write full time. The story had me on the edge of my chair, devouring each chapter. I would encourage anyone who would raise eyebrows at a post apocalyptic novel to give this a spin. Go live in the silo with Juliette and Lukas for a day or two...you won't regret it.
B00005JPMZ|2|It's funny how fast Hollywood pumps out these terrible CGI movies as a way to make a quick buck. But did they have to ruin one of my childhood favorites? I mean, if they want to exploit another movie by over- merchandising a bad story with even more obnoxious celebrity voices, they should've just made Shrek 4. The kids of this generation are getting gypped. Don't watch this movie.
B00AEJM6H2|5|I play this during the commercials when I'm watching live TV.  Also for a few minutes when I'm in bed just befroe retiring.
B001AQO3WY|5|In Generation Kill, David Simon and Ed Burns (creators of HBO's Critically Acclaimed series, \\"The Wire\\") give us highly realistic portrayal of the invasion of Iraq and the trial and tribulations experienced by the Marines who led the charge. The events here were orignally reported in the book of the same title by Evan Wright, an embedded Rolling Stone reporter sent to document the first days of the invasion.     Though it is now clear that the military incursion into Iraq was \\"bungled\\" by our defense, military and political leaders, in Generation Kill, we see how much of an effect it had on the soldiers sent to lead the charge. They went in without armor for the turrets on their Humvees, without enough batteries to keep their night vision goggles powered, without a clear plan as to what exactly they were going to be doing. Further, the political in fighting and occasional incompetency among the marine leadership on the ground in Iraq simply creates more confusion and chaos for the soldiers of this unit to contend with.     I can only hope that Generation Kill (both the book and the mini-series) serve for years to come as a realistic document of the Iraq war and a reminder that when sending our military in to foreign battles, we equip them with not only the supplies they need, but the forethought and planning that is necessary to keep them safe and make their operations run smoothly.     I recommend this to anyone with any interest in the Iraq war, regardless of wether or not they support it.  They only way we can prevent the arbitrary use of our military in foreign conflicts in the future is to keep the American public informed about what happens.  Generation Kill is a first hand look at the situation in Iraq, and much credit should be given to HBO, David Simon, Ed Burns, Evan Wight and the marines whom this miniseries is about, for bringing it to life and showing us, from the comfort of our living rooms, what is was like to be there.
B009EEOQIU|5|This is my absolutely favorite Cinderella story.  Drew Barrymore is wonderful as the cinder girl.  It has some action but no real fear.  It is a chick flick extraordinaire.  The mean stepmother(Angelica Huston) is magnificent as are the two stepsisters.  This movie is the equivalent to reading a very good book with fully explored characters.  Dougray Scott is fine as the Prince and love interest.
B00DR0PDNE|1|I decided to ignore bad reviews of the Google Chromecast. That was a bad mistake. I received my Chromecast in after four hours gave up trying to install it. Everything went well until I had to download the first update. I got the message that it could not connect the network. So I opened up Settings and noticed that the WirelessPasswordwas only eight characters long instead of the 10 characters that made up my Internet wireless password. I could not change it nor could I get it to display the characters.I could not find any help on the Google website but a Forum gave me an answer as to how to do change the password. I was told to push the button on the Chromecast until it reset. Just doing that didn't work so I completely uninstalled Chromecast and started all over from the beginning. The same problem cropped up. Even though I entered the correct password for the wireless network, Settings still showed only eight characters. So Amazon, give me a refund.

B00BVYNSLC|5|Tatiana Maslany is fantastic actor. She takes on each part with gusto and zeal. The supporting cast is fantastic as well. Jordan Gavaris is a stand out as well.
B0055SWM08|4|I really liked. this game,  but it was over too quickly. I guess I'll just have too go back and try to complete each level perfectly.
014241493X|5|John Green is a great author and I purchased this almost immediately after reading &#34;Fault in our Stars.&#34; Delivery was very fast and book was in great condition- even though listed as used.
B00AEFYS2M|5|one of the classics
B000002KHH|5|This CD makes me messy. I love it and all, but I get myself all brushed and neat in the morning, and then I put this CD on, and an urge to bang my head comes on, and I get messy. But you can see why I have this headbanging urge. This is one of the essential metal CDs. It would be impossible to not bang your head while listening to such metal classics as 'Iron Man', 'Paranoid', and 'War Pigs'. It was also Black Sabbath's highest-charting album in the US. And I can see why.
B0063GORYU|5|Great - one of my favorites!
B00ATDOVNK|5|This game is really good, it's dark, suspenseful and challenging. I like how it rewards you for not using the hint button, it gives you the feeling of you actually did something. The graphics and animations are amazing it's like the levels are alive, really good game. Well done by the developers.
B008JFUPK8|3|Back in the summer of 1989, I was walking out of the most ginormous superhero movie ever made. Actually, it was the most ginormous movie release ever, at the time, bringing in $40 million its opening weekend. All of my friends were ecstatic and cheering, and my cousin wouldn't shut up about how the Joker had pulled that three feet long pistol out of his pants and shot down the Batwing, a moment I'd thought was especially stupid, and I wasn't really happy.<br /><br />Yeah, I know. I hear all of you out there being oh so shocked.<br /><br />But, see, the thing I kept thinking, the thing I still think today, was, \\"Maybe, if Burton had just been honest and called the movie The Joker, I would have liked it.\\" [And I could go into a whole thing of all of the things wrong with having Burton make that movie to begin with and how the Joker was the only character he found interesting and how he didn't (and doesn't) like the movie nor, even, the idea of making it--he just wanted to be a part of what he expected to be a vast pop culture phenomenon. But all of that is for some other time.]<br /><br />And that's how I feel about Man of Steel. If Nolan wanted to make a movie about General Zod, he should have just called it General Zod. As it is, I'm left with feelings of dissatisfaction because Superman was only included as what amounts to an afterthought. He's the guy that's going to defeat Zod, and there's only just enough information in the movie to let us know who he is.<br /><br />Which brings me to what I think is the biggest issue with Man of Steel, which includes Nolan's abuse of the title (and let's not fool ourselves into thinking that this was not Nolan's movie, even if Snyder directed it. The story and style was Nolan's, which makes it his). Nolan exploits our outside knowledge of who and what Superman is to skimp on the origin, which he then changes. It's sloppy storytelling. Worse than sloppy. And I don't like feeling exploited. The truth is, if I didn't already knowSuperman's background, I would have had a difficult time with the movie.<br /><br />For instance, my sister-in-law is a Marvel girl, so she doesn't really know about Superman, not the details, anyway. Her entire exposure to Superman was the godawful Superman Returns, so there were parts of Man of Steel that she didn't get. Like why we should care about Perry White. Within the context of the movie, the fact that we spend so much time watching Perry and friends run away from falling buildings makes no sense. We have no reason to care about that character UNLESS we already know about who he is from the comics (or previous movies or whatever). And she didn't feel any real connection to Clark because the whole reason we care about Clark is we know the Kents took him in and raised him as their own. They accepted him. But what we get from the movie is Jonathan Kent constantly telling Clark what an outsider he is. And don't get me started on the ridiculousness of Jonathan sacrificing himself to the tornado to \\"protect\\" Clark's secret. All of this includes the lack of context for calling the movie Man of Steel, which does not come from the movie. Unless you know that Superman is called the man of steel, there's no reason to understand the title, so, again, outside knowledge. Also, the name the \\"Man of Steel\\" was given to Superman when humans thought Superman was actually human. They never think that in the movie, so that particular moniker becomes inappropriate, so, in effect, it's a stupid title for the movie and something only chosen to distinguish it from the other Superman movies. He should have just gone with Superman or, even better, General Zod.<br /><br />So, with all of that in mind, no, I did not like the middle of the movie. I thought the origin part of the origin story of Superman was very poorly handled. We have no idea of who this new guy is, no idea of the strength of his character, no idea of why we should trust him. Other than, well, he says we should, and that after trashing Metropolis (at least, I suppose it's Metropolis--the movie wasn't explicit with that). What we do know is that, when he was a kid, he saved a busload of kids and got in trouble for it. Later, after having a fight with his dad, he allowed his dad to be killed by a tornado.<br /><br />Also, the idea of Clark having spent 15 years as a drifter while looking for his origins is... well, it's dumb. Why didn't he ever stick that key into the spaceship in the barn? The technology should have been exactly the same. Or is it that the spaceship was \\"broken\\"? I'm just not buying that explanation. And why would he even expect to find anything else on Earth from wherever it was he was from? There's no good logic for any of that. It's just a contrived way to bring Lois into contact with Clark and not a very good one at that. And I have nothing to say about the \\"symbolism\\" of having Clark be 33 when Zod comes to Earth. That, also, was just dumb. As was Clark learning to fly, basically, because daddy left him a super suit. For which, by the way, there is no good reason for it to have been on a spaceship buried under arctic ice for 20,000 years.<br /><br />The beginning of the movie, though, I liked. Mostly. It was good to have a back story for Zod beyond \\"space criminal.\\" The swimming scene and the codex being a skull, though, was, again, dumb. As was depositing the codex within the body of baby Kal-El. The rest was pretty cool, even if it was rather like watching Star Wars what with the big battleships while Jor-El flew around on some kind of giant insect. Yes, I'm overlooking the part where, basically, the entire population of Krypton chooses to stay on Krypton and die rather than evacuate despite having the technology to do so. [I'm also overlooking the fact that, evidently, every single Kryptonian colony failed despite having huge world engine terraforming machines.]<br /><br />So... we open the move with Zod, and we end the movie with Zod. It was a movie about Zod. And the end of the movie just went on and on and the destruction was beyond my ability to accept. See, here's the thing, we, as viewers, accept that Superman is a good guy, because, well, we know he's a good guy. We have 75 years of prior knowledge that tells us he's a good guy. But the people of Earth in the movie have no such prior knowledge. They don't know who Superman is any more than they know who Zod is. What they do know is that two aliens showed up and destroyed a major city and tried to destroy the world. But, yet, they just accept that Superman is a \\"good guy,\\" and Nolan gets away with it because he bases that on our knowledge of the character, not what's revealed of the character in the movie (who, remember, allowed his human father to die because of an argument).<br /><br />But how was Zod? So much of the focus is on him, so how was he? Michael Shannon was, actually, very excellent as Zod. If you've seen him in Boardwalk Empire, it's apparent why he was chose, and it was a good call. He brings just the right amount of zeal to the role to make it believable.<br /><br />Russel Crowe, whom I generally dislike, was pretty good in his role as Jor-El. Well, except for the hide-and-seek bit in the spaceship, but that was hardly his fault. Seriously? The virtual Jor-El is going to play hide-and-seek with his son upon being uploaded? Another bit of contrivance to get Clark out of the way so that Lois could injured. [And, um, just why didn't Clark hear her coming down  the tunnel? It's not like she was being quiet. Or that that should have mattered at all.]<br /><br />Henry Cavill was adequate as Superman, although I think he really got the part due to his resemblance to Tom Welling from Smallville. They have the same \\"farm-boyish\\" grin. I liked Costner as Jonathan, even if I didn't like the part, much, as it was written. I don't have, however, have strong positive feelings for Diane Lane as Martha. I also thought Amy Adams was good in her role. The rest were non-spectacular.<br /><br />The final result is that I have a lot of mixed feelings about this newest Superman, which is a far cry better than how I felt about the last Superman. This new one is just too much Nolan for me, who seems to be more concerned on an ongoing basis with what seems cool rather than what makes a good story. Seriously, I didn't need more of the Inception-type building collapses. I am interested to see where Nolan is going to take the story, unless this just ends up being a setup for the JLA movie that DC and Warner Brothers are still trying to get off the ground, at which point, I will decide that DC needs to scrap all the previous movie history it's developed and start over, just like they keep doing with their comic book world. Maybe, someday, they'll get it right.
B001BPJJ1E|3|This reminds me of the early Bee Gees music in the 1980's. I have been looking for this movie for more than 20 years. The movie itself is simple & sweet but the background music & songs reminds me of my younger years. The clarity of the DVD is less desirable but can't fault it - surely it was probably copied from a VHS or Betamax tapes. LOL. Still love the musicality of the whole thing.
B00A8ECU24|4|Really Good and cute game. Only downside is that they don't really give you much opportunity to get free gems. The only thing is to level up, or watch YouTube videos advertising their other games. But, as I said, a very good game, with tons of cute ponies just like the ones in the cartoon. Satisfied, yet again. Great job Gameloft!
B00KMX5V8G|3|It's ok until you climb up the latter and unless you buy boosters, etc., you are not going anywhere.  I've stopped playing. and deleted it.
0345805054|5|Excellent condition..wonderful story!
B00EAIMGDW|2|to tell you the truth, (because that's all I know), this game was dissapointing... I guess that I was expecting something more...
6305327041|1|What's good: Tim Roth doing Michael Caine. Antonio Banderas doing the tango. <BR>What sucked: The rest of the movie.<BR>Surprises: That Tarantino could be so incredibly bad. <BR>Reason to buy: Only to complete (or pollute, if you like) your Tarantino collection. But then it had to be really cheap.
B00EMJBVAI|4|Very good movie
B000002GQK|5|Even better than the original Threshold LP! How nice to have a high quality recording without the scratches acquired since 1971!
B00AREIAI8|5|I love horses. and I love this game. the bolts go up in time. any game that I can play without spending money gets 5 stars from me.
1590171993|5|Excellent!
B00EHMFC78|3|Typical Baldacci fare, like able characters for the most part. Predictable ending, I saw it coming from the introduction of the Korean characters. A bit disappointing. Expecting more!
B00BEPVAV8|4|Fun game to pass the time. My eight yr old son polices it and it's even fun for myself if I need a quick way to kill time :-)
B000002V0Q|5|Yes, I am a big fan of both Peace Sells and Rust in Peace, but this was Megadeths best in my opinion. <BR>It is perhaps a more commercial album compared to earlier releases , but it still has everything you love about megadeth.<BR>If you are a fan and dont have this album - you must buy it. On the other hand if you are wanting to get into the band, this is a good place to start.<BR>Great metal album.
0740797719|2|It was very limited.
B009RI4ZKC|4|It was definitely a different role for Bill Murray and Bruce Willis; Willis especially was good.<br />The young boy though stole the show.
B00JQP111W|5|very good blue ray
B0032KNA4I|1|I knew this movie was a dud but it has some nice special effects and I have a weakness for disaster films.  What I didn't expect was the klutzy way this disc was designed to operate (if it wasn't \\"broken\\").  When pause or fast forward is pressed, the bottom 20% of the screen is overlaid with a background color and a \\"thermometer\\" type set of lines to show how much of the movie has played.  I could find no way to get rid of it.  It became very difficult to read subtitles or to see any action near the bottom of the screen.  The real surprise was when I pressed stop (thinking this might return to full screen mode).  Stopping results in the movie going all the way back to the start.  I could find no way to access a menu at this point to select a scene.  I went through these key punches a couple of time just to be sure the first time wasn't an anomaly.<br />I returned the disc since I refuse to commit to watching the whole 2 hours plus without touching a key.  Now, to add insult to injury, SONY also won't let you skip the ads at the start of the disc.  I was already mad at them for adding another warning (which this disc has too) stating that they are not responsible for what you see in the movie. If that is so, how can they take money for someone else's work?  No wonder SONY is losing billions.  They deserve to.
0547258305|2|I've seen so many great reviews of this book and how everyone loved it, but I just couldn't get into it. I really wanted to be able to like this book, and I hoped it would get better as I read further into it, but it didn't. I don't know, it was a very good idea for a story and Cashore's writing was fine, but the story line didn't do enough for me. It was very slow moving and it didn't seem like there was much going on in the story. I just think the story line could have been 'beefed up' a little more; adding in more action instead of just a long walk through the forest.
B002QE3CTY|5|It was a very good book. Exciting and terrifying at the same time. Excited to read the next book bet it will be just as good.
B0001L3LUE|3|I don't disagree with the good things most reviewers said about this film. It is intelligently done and includes statements on most of the important sessions in Robert McNamara's life.<br /><br />However, it is clear from watching this that many of McNamara's perceived \\"lessons\\" of war are cast from his own personal guilt over his role in fire bombing Japanese cities in World War II and the foolishness of American involvement in Vietnam beginning in 1964. McNamara clearly is uneasy with his personal history, and that unease has much to say about his \\"lessons\\".<br /><br />Furthermore, I'd have been happier if he's just come out and admitted that the Tonkin Gulf event never happened instead of simply implying such. This was the linchpin event leading to American involvement in Vietnam, after all. It would be good to have on the record, finally, that is never occurred.<br /><br />The most telling portion of the film is McNamara's description of events surrounding the blockade in Cuba during the so-called Cuban missile crisis. The events McNamara describes were almost perfectly realized by characters in the 1964 film \\"Fail Safe\\". For me, this was the most enlightening section of the biograph.<br /><br />I enjoyed this film but, after reading about it for months, was a bit let down by McNamara's real guilt over events from his life. I found this more of a lesson in McNamaraism than in history, to be honest.
B0036S4B6M|5|My book group reads a fair bit of nonfiction, and this is one of the best written memoirs I think we've come across. I love the style of the writing, and the fact that the author doesn't appear to make apologies or excuses for what happened to her. She owns it. Over the timeline of the story, she works in some frightening and disheartening statistics about our prison system, but she does so in a seamless way that doesn't interfere with the flow of the story, but add to it. I think I want my high school daughters to read this book, because it says better than I ever could that yes, you can be held accountable for your actions. A marvelous read, well done, and I sincerely hope the author never has cause to write a sequel. :)
B00001ZULV|4|I have been reading many of the reviews of the long awaited Genesis greatest hits CD and am tired of all the whining about the lack of songs from the Peter Gabriel era of Genesis.  Genesis became popular after Peter  Gabriel left the band, so there should be no surprise that there aren't  many Gabriel tracks on the CD.  I believe the CD is a nice compilation,  although I would have liked to see &quot;Paperlate&quot;, &quot;Man On the  Corner&quot;, &quot;Illegal Alien&quot; and &quot;No Reply at All&quot;  included and the uncut version of &quot;Mama&quot;.  Probably the best  approach would have been to have two greatest hits CDs, one from the  Gabriel era and one from the Phil Collins era, but I think the record  company would know that the former would collect dust on the shelves.  A  good CD for the casual Genesis fan.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4|I very much liked this book.  It really gave a historical context to much of what was written in the new testament. I don't understand the negative views since believers and non believers should continually challenge themselves.  This book certainly makes Jesus and his followers into complex people that should give most pause about what they truly believe.
B000QCQ8Y4|3|Who is killing Jack Reacher's former army comrades? That's the basis of the story. The journey into Jack's past and his army buddies who populated it is the best part of the novel. Author Lee Child is at his best when he is probing his hero's past exploits and the reunion that happens here has great promise. As usual, Jack gets to have an affair with a helper and this affair has a twist that let's us know a little bit more about Jack and his past. The action is strong although the rush to the finish doesn't quite suspend the reader's disbelief. Good for airplanes and sleepless nights.
B00KW25MFY|5|In my humble opinion, this is a very, very good Tom Cruise movie, and an excellent sci-fi flick! You could say that Tom has stayed within his lines as an actor. Sometimes when he deviates from what works for him, it doesn't work for me. Who am I though. I think he should try all sorts of genres, but in my estimation, he got into a movie that matched his prowess as an actor. If you take the time to research his commitment to his craft, he gets himself mentally and physically prepared with a rigid regimen everyday. He may not sell all the tickets like he once did, but he has fun making films! EOT, more than anything was a lot of fun.
B00HBR9OWU|1|I like the price, It is cheap
044654759X|1|Did anyone else see the similarities between this book and Black and Blue & the movie, Sleeping with the Enemy?? I was greatly disappointed in lack of originality. I had heard that from Sparks there are twists and turns, but the \\"theme\\" with Jo was overshadowed by the grotesque character of Kevin.    I kept reading just see if I would be surprised and no, I wasn't...this will be my last.
B001N1DPDE|5|Heavy, durable and everything I expected in this knife.  Great for chopping, cutting or making fire starting material. Extra thick blade so can be used as a wedge.
0380002930|5|I first read this book when I was a teen, reread it in my early twentys, again a few years later, and most reciently, at the age of 42.  Each time, a new discovery, and new feeling of triumph.  It has been at the top of that &quot;must read&quot; list that exhists in every avid readers mind, the list that every new aquaintance must listen to at least once.  The list that starts &quot;Oh, if you like to read you MUST read.....&quot;  Always number one on my list since that first accidental discovery (It was a last minute grab in the school library as the bell rang..) Watership Down has given me untold hours of pleasure, both in the reading and rereading, as well as the sharing.  Not a person alive should allow themselves to forgo the pleasure of &quot;Watership Down&quot;

B0097C8XL0|4|This is a pretty cool game I love it but sometimes it not as fast as I thought it is also in Speed but I thought is a very very fast . You can get cool people and there's not a pro version that you have to pay for I hate those because they make the first one bad on purpose so you for the pro version that might not be worth buying .

B000001FYZ|2|Crazy World is about on the same level as Savage Amusement for me. It's a good CD for Scorpion fans, but to a widespread general audience it's probably just the album that contains the hit Wind Of Change. Never able to recapture the brilliance of Love At First Sting, this one continues the Scorps' downward slide from the top of their game. I like this CD enough to keep it as a part of my collection because I really like the band, but after the first few tracks I usually get bored and listen to something else. My favorite tracks include: Tease me Please Me, To Be With You in Heaven, Wind of Change, Kicks After Six.
B00NEQRNVG|4|I liked the series, and i thought this would be the last book. The book itself was good but how long are they going to keep dragging this series out, now i have to wait for the next book.
B0063IH60K|5|its good for passing time because i personally love card games. great for kids and teens. but i thought it was great.
B003M6G86E|5|The GF got hooked on bones and this was by far the easiest and cheapest way for us to stream it through our laptop to our tv. I actually ended up getting prime after this because it streamed so well
B000UNYJXQ|5|If you were the kind of person that sent your friends to see \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\" you will need to buy this DVD to loan to twice as many friends.  Unless you have had to use your health insurance in the past couple of years, you have no idea how out of control costs and restrictions are -- making health care financially unattainable FOR THE INSURED!  Regardless of how you feel about \\"socialized health care\\", you must watch this film to understand why America's plan is not working.
B0011Z5IVE|5|New music still can't beat a classic album like this. This is a testament to the genius of Jimmy Page, and Robert Plant. They may get older, but you just can't best their chemistry.
B004J4WLB4|5|This story touched my heart.  The author used flowers to represent feelings, the way a painter uses a pallet of paints to create a beautiful painting.  The drama and joy of the past and present intertwine like grapevines to produce the sweetest fruit.  Lovely!  Riveting! A must read!
B005CRQ4XI|5|Held my attention from the first page! Lots of emotions - very honest. Kind of makes me want to try it - for a few weeks!
B00S6K4UMK|4|Great album, but not better than Imaginaerum if you remove &#34;The greatest show on earth&#34; hehe...<br />Im sorry to say this but Olzon could make this album to be 5 starts for my taste. Jansen may have the best range, technique and anything you want, but Olzon made Nightwish unique, she has a unique voice that cant hear anywhere...Anyway, very good album and the greatest show on earth is the best track ever...For me Endless forms most beautiful, Edema Ruh and Alpenglow are fillers, or they dont compare to the rest of the album.
B001PPLJIQ|4|\\"The Reader\\" struck me as a most unusual movie.  As I watched it unfold, I found myself drawn into it more and more despite some significant shortcomings.  The film begins as a fairly racey \\"coming of age\\" story.  A 15 year-old boy encounters an older woman (at one time mistaken as his mother) and things develop.  Things end abruptly when the older woman leaves with no forwarding address.  Naturally, things resume later only this time the 15 year old is a young adult law student in Germany (everything takes place in Germany but no one speaks German).  Now the former lover (looking a bit older) is on trial for Holocaust crimes.  The young man wrestles with the unfolding truth while holding back on his own knowledge of the truth.  Well, I'm not trying to give away the plot but eventually something unique and wonderful happens as the film makes its' way to a bumpy end.      For a movie about relationships, this was a movie that was equally guitly of not clarifying relationships.  One night the teenage boy has to nervously make up his excuse for being late for supper and the rest of the nights who knows when he gets home.  I suspect that an arrangement of some sort of boarding school happened when I blinked.  How about the marriage that failed without us ever really knowing it happened.  Of course a total of 2 minutes of good dialogue was all that was needed to explore the deep and fragile relationship between father and child.  Then there's the brief appearances of Ralph Fiennes which constituted top billing.  Oh well, Kate Winslet is the movie; not Ralph or his youthful understudy.  This film is about nobody doing the right thing with a major lone exception and that is where the film's title comes in.
B0002S94OS|5|The Best Album Ever!!!
B002DQLGHU|4|My daughter loves it!
B004AHNIGM|4|It was better than when I thought it would be
B00BAXFECK|5|Great book
B002VPE1AW|5|Avatar is just the right amounts of fantasy, sci-fi, romance and drama.<br />It's the most visually beautiful movie I've ever watched...bet you'll watch  it repeatedly, each time gleaning something new from the story!
1933952806|5|This is an excellent book on the D7000. While I have just received the book and have not had a chance to read the material completely, I can tell it is well written. Particularly handy are the author's recommendations for each camera menu setting.
6305736650|4|One of the greatest love stories of all time. Bogart showcases his fantastic acting ability bringing heft and grit to his role. Bergman, Henreid, Greenstreet and Rains all contribute in a brilliant way. Fantastic!
067443000X|3|I read through most of the one stars reviews to help me decide whether I wanted to purchase this book. It became obvious to me that most who where posting one star reviews had not read the book.
B008HK3RVY|5|I love my case for the Kindle Fire HD 7&#34;! it fits perfectly. I have dropped it a couple times from standing up and always the kindle is still in perfect condition.
B002XMGGJM|5|One of my favorite movies of the year, and of the last decade. Great excitement and twist at the end that I didn't see coming.
0439023521|5|This books grabs on and won't let go.  I had a hard time going to sleep after I started this book and now I'm waiting for the UPS man to bring the rest of the series.  Buy it!!!
B00JH49OTS|1|Nihilistic, misogynistic, dispassionate, meaningless, self-loathing, and on and on seem to be the filmmaker's view of life in this tiring, 'artsy-fartsy waste of time. Johanssen was probably happy to be paid for being photographed in trite scenes where nothing was expected from her but to keep a straight face. It is no mystery why this work failed to recoup its cost, which at 13.3 million, at least provided the producers a budget that could be ransacked.
B007PT3QOQ|5|This game does not require money but u can get extra if you like. I thought it was very fun and the best part for me is the game does not require Internet once it is downloaded!  It was not a waste of space or time like the other gameloft ones! Nice work gameloft.
B000000WA4|5|Mellon Collie is a beautifully written masterpiece in my opinion.  Of course, I simply adore the pumpkins.  I find the album itself can satisfy a vast array a different music \\"moods\\" and left me with a number of songs I could identify with at that specific time in my life.  For those who say it doesn't compare to Siamese Dream:  While I admit Siamese Dream was a masterpiece, I see no decline with mellon collie-just difference.  It was still the beautiful pumpkins music I knew I loved (which is more than I can say now in 2008). Anyway---Beautiful Album*****
0920668372|5|I knew of this story prior to purchasing the book for my son. I love it. It is somewhat sad though. My mother in law read it to my son for a bedtime story and came out crying hahaha. It is a sweet and sad story. If you haven't read it, I highly recommend it for your kids. My son loved it when he was a baby. Especially when we would read the song verse.
B00003CX95|5|When first saw Braveheart i thought would dumb,but i was absolutely amazing. Powerful and funny at parts. Every time i watch it i love it even more. If you haven't seen Braveheart see it!
B006GLMHBM|5|My favorite series!  Stinks I gotta pay to watch .
B00FAPF5U0|3|I do love that I can play this on my Kindle now. I just wish it had the perks of a PC game, or even the phone app. Can't spin the wheel or play the night owl.
B00881VLCE|3|fun at first but hard to move pieces.  very frustrating.  way too many ads that can't be avoided.  popup ads every few seconds. paid 3.99 to remove ads.  supposed to be good on all my devices but only shows up on the kindle I used to purchase the ad removal.  really a pain in the butt to use.
1469984202|4|First, I must say that any book that is hard for me to put down and leaves me wanting more has done a great job. I did love this book. I am writing this review about an hour after finishing and less than a week after starting.  Part of me sees this book not unlike many of the great shows that I grew to love. My biggest frustration with the book were the questions left unanswered. But yet many were. I think back to my favorite show LOST and how it did a great job of weaving you into the story, leaving you wanting so much answered. WOOL does this as well. Part of me would love to see a part six and beyond, to see these characters lives unfold even more, and yet... like our own lives, only so much can be told. In summary, this is a must-read for me.
B005S9EK5Y|5|Having seen the show on Broadway, I was concerned about what would be in the movie.  The movie was really great.  Voices, acting, sets.  Great.  Neither are, it should be emphasized, is a real replacement for the book.
B00T3DNKIE|4|The book moved slowly for the first half but then delivered its intended subject matter.
B00C7TAF3Y|5|Never, in all my playing games (and I'm 51) have I had so much fun with a game that I actually completed it. This was my intro to this type of game genre and I hope to get more of these from this company.<br /><br />My only complaint that I have is the same as everyone else's - too short although I can understand this when I discovered this was this company's first game. I mean why go through all that hard core programming if no one likes it.  Well now that you (the devs) know how well received this was, hopefully your next one will be longer (please oh please oh please! :)<br /><br />I discovered I had to use the hints but only sparingly as I figured out the mechanics of the game. Hint to first time players - look at EVERYTHING through the special eyeglass you get at the beginning. Even if nothing special shows up if you don't use it you'll miss some important stuff which is one of the reasons I had to use the hints when I did. I forgot to look through the eyeglass. Duh<br /><br />The graphics and gameplay are extraordinary. Sharp, HD, graphics and easy to see/read words made this game super fun even with my p***-poor eyesight.<br /><br />Hope you enjoy the game as much as I did.<br /><br />Played on a Kindle Fire HD 7&quot;
B000SCHC0Q|4|I liked the Kite Runner and found Splendid Suns to be written similarly. The story was accurate feeling, but grueling in that the tension and abuse never let up. I was hoping for some type of hope or resolve by the end, but was really left feeling that there would never be any peace for these people. Women will forever be disrespected and abused.
B00ET0PZDO|4|if you have played point and click adventure games on pc, especially 'Escape&#34; games then there are no surprises for you with this offering.  Nice graphics, some puzzles and generally a good time waster.  I would love to see more of this genre in the app market instead of the bajillion shooters or racers that bore me to death.  The only downer was that the puzzles were too simplistic and it was hard to target effectively by using your finger on the touchscreen, which for a point and click game can be troublesome.<br /><br />still, well done and would like to see more from the developers
0553582453|5|Very well written, Easy to follow with great character insights.
B003XF1XOQ|5|Have a box of tissues in the end you'll need it. On a scale of one to Ten,9 because it's just a little confusing
B003N5VOUO|5|Excellent
B007Z9QS5K|3|This movie was a typical romantic movie.  Though it was an enjoyable movie, it's not one that I would watch over and over.
B004O3YGMC|5|Best thing since sliced bread and spreadable butter! This app truly expands the value of the Kindle Fire by increasing storage and remote connect. Have looked at several ways to get around the limited device/cloud storage constraint without having to shuffle load/unloads all the time... this is the answer! Everything is at your fingertips. Fantastic app and well worth the small price!
B009XIXVU6|4|It seems like East of Eden written for another time and audience. The author places vignettes that seem to have no connection, but as the vignettes become full fledged pictures, the connections are clear.
0470876417|5|A really great book, I recommend buying the actual book rather than the kindle version.
B001FB4VXU|5|the big bang theory is just silly laugh out loud comedy i love the big bang theory
B003DZX3US|5|I have been looking for this product for a long time, and am so happy to have found it in such good condition!!!
B0026PW67W|5|My daughter loves this map. She asked for it as a gift and it was hard to find and was not a good price most places. It was on stock and a good price on Amazon. Great.
B00BAXFJ5M|5|Another great read by David balsamic. I always love the characters he creates. The only issue is that a lot of things magically come together. You won't be bored reading this book. Now let's bring back the camel club!!!!!
B00BAXFAJC|1|Although beautifully written, I found this book to be tedious and boring. It is much too long.
B00VRYCGLO|3|Do not like running out of lives at all. Otherwise good game.
B00JORDEJ4|5|This show is addictive!! Love all the character, the plot line is great and I can't wait for next season. You can't watch just one, make time for a bender!!
B00E6Y4V8S|5|Wonderful album and amazing performer.  Stromae is incredible.  Watch the videos of his live shows on Youtube, can't say enough good things about him.
B008Y7N7JW|5|This just showed up on my Roku for a free viewing on Amazon Prime.  Had never seen it.  It was a good show and thanks to Amazon for the showing.  The delivery on Roku was flawless and at a high resolution.
B007EECSFA|4|This was a really good read. Well developed characters and story line with lots of mystery. Not to mention the irony.
B00HV2KPNW|5|duh its frozen!

B00992CF6W|5|Fantastic Game!
B00IOVH8AW|5|Pharrell Williams has brought Motown up to date. Great beat and fun lyrics. Reminiscent of Marvin Gaye.
B00E5Q1HJS|5|Good movie
B002PZ6XB8|4|Enjoyed watching the step back in time.  Very stuffy time to live but Miss Potter managed to find her own way, despite her parents.  Interesting to see how she came to be the children's books most famous author.  Scenery is lovely also.  This movie won't tax your brain but is a pleasant time in which to relax.
B001ANYDAO|5|Free books force you to consider the way you view the world like Gladwell's do. Unmatched levels of consideration couple with a knack for storytelling that make this a joy to read.
B007SYWFRM|5|the game is fun. tons to do. only downside is a short lag in kung tu scrat. so many characters. don't have to wait much like other games.
B00992CF6W|4|Cool but when is the new update it takes for ever for one to come in. Great game buy  the way.
B005544TRQ|5|Addicted...love the writing, plots actors/actresses! Just wish my Amazon playback wouldn't get blurry every other 3 minutes.
B0089LOG02|4|Simple retelling of history in the narrative style.  Good easy read.
B00AE2J5HI|4|Liked the setup with how family values meant something. Never back down from a fight and always stand behind your family.
B003M6EAXM|5|Jack Bauer never dissapoints. On the edge of my seat till the very last second. I can't stop watching it.
0345803485|1|This book is basically glorified abuse and should not be taken that seriously. Honestly it's not really BDSM if the dominant person is a control freak and that's the reason they're into it, that makes the character abusive. After seeing the movie people will probably go home and get injuries from improper knot tying, kidney damage from improper crop use, and more because this author actually knows little to nothing about how BDSM actually works. Please just don't even waste your time with that.<br /><br />Another thing is the writing. The author didn't put too much effort into keeping the characters American as I think they intended, because there's an overwhelming amount of British lingo in there. If they weren't going to take the time to learn the American ways of speaking they should've just set it in Britain. Then there's the repetition. The author reuses so so many phrases multiple times it just gets annoying and tedious to read. There's really no variety in their phrases. The author seems to have just written something and sent it out without checking with an editor that wasn't Spell Check.
B005ZOBNOI|5|This book does not deserve 5 stars... it deserves a million. I recommend this book to anyone looking for a beautiful (and somewhat epic) romance between two beautiful characters. I must warn you though... you will cry so prepare some tissues if you decide to embark on the magnificent journey that is \\"The Fault in Our Stars\\"
B00004SCX6|2|People of the world, let's face it. Britney can't sing. Little nine year old minds will be damaged forever upon the listening of this. The only 2 decent songs on the whole cd are Lucky(I wonder if that's how she feels but  I think she too blessed), and Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know(Mutt Lange  is a songwriting genius and Britney HAD to butcher a creation of his). I've  heard bad remakes but this rivals all. NO ONE SHOULD EVER CHANGE THE LYRICS  TO A CLASSIC SONG LIKE SATISFACTION, ARGUABLY THE BEST POP SONG EVER! The  titanic blowoff was so inane on Oops. And besides, Britney has said in  interviews that she doesn't really relate to what she's(supposedly)  co-written in Dear Diary. I really don't get that. People write songs to  express their feelings and opinions, not because an industry makes them. I  think she co-wrote it to shut up all her critics(and God there's a lot of  them). If you want to hear a nice song named Dear Diary, get a copy of  M2M's Shades of Purple. FYI:They are not the same lyrics. Britney has  promoted herself as a &quot;real girl&quot;. Sorry sister, you are only as  real as your implants and there is music by better artists who deserve more  attention (see above). I give her credit for the good stuff.
B0063IH60K|4|good version
1400034779|5|Precious Ramotswe is the thirty-something protagonist of Alexander McCall Smith's successful series about a lady detective in Botswana. The first book of the series is \\"The No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency,\\" in which Smith gives the back story of how Ramotswe came to be the first female detective in Botswana.<br />Mma Ramotswe, as she is known throughout the book, is the only child of Obed Ramotswe, whom she idolizes. Since her mother died when she was young, Mma Ramotswe learned about life from her father. Obed owned a big herd of cattle, which his daughter inherited upon her father's death. She uses the proceeds from the sale of her father's cattle to buy a house on Zebra Drive and set up her detective agency.<br />Using lyrical prose, Smith does a brilliant job of imbuing his book with the ambiance of Botswana. We see the thorn and acacia trees on the horizon, we marvel at the colorful birds as they swoop down from the sky, we taste the sand of the Kalahari Desert, and we feel the leisurely, gentle pace of everyday life in Botswana.<br />Ramotswe is a thoroughly entertaining character. She is fat and proud of her girth, and she is confident in her ability to read human nature. Ramotswe investigates cases of various con men, a misbehaving daughter, and a missing husband. Although she has no experience as a detective, she uses common sense, intuition, and her professional bible, \\"The Principles of Private Detection,\\" by Clovis Andersen, to guide her. More often than not, she comes to the correct conclusion.<br />However, Ramotswe is not simply a female Sherlock Holmes. She is a kind and compassionate individual who is careful to use the information she gleans to help her clients live a better life. Her support system consists of Mr. J. L. B. Matekoni, mechanic extraordinaire (and her not-so-secret admirer) and her talented secretary, Mma Makutsi.<br />\\"The No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency\\" is a throwback to a kinder gentler detective novel. Instead of violence and mayhem, Smith writes about the psychology of human nature and he emphasizes the importance of knowing who you are and of having a secure place in the world. He also stresses the satisfaction that comes from loving your land and your neighbors. If you want an exotic, sweet, and utterly enchanting novel about a most unusual detective, start reading this series. I guarantee that you will be eager to read the rest of the series, as well.yhem, Smith writes about the psychology of human nature and he emphasizes the importance of knowing who you are and of having a secure place in the world.

1564148793|5|This book is an excellent guide to using protection magic.  It helped me to obtain peace in my life.  I always felt that hiddent forces were influencing me, making me angry and belligerent.  Since I began using the practices outlined in the book I have become much more calm and relaxed.  I recommend Protection and Reversal Magick to anyone dabbling in the magical realm.
0446343129|5|Fantastic book. Highly recommended.
0061537969|4|I wasn't sure about this book but I tried it and I'm glad I did. It talks about racing a lot but I didn't mind, as it pertained to the entire story. I really liked this book. I was crying at the end but it's such a nice surprising ending.
B008M36EEI|4|Love this movie! 2nd time I've watched it. Have Faith, watch it ;)
B003JLA4KS|5|An outstanding never before seen insight in to the lives of outstanding musicians and the creation of the greatest band that ever was! Besides a highly interesting close look in to their lives, a nostalgic look from their early (and perhaps) best work.<br /><br />Thanks for bringing this treasure in to all of our lives......the fans!!<br /><br />All the best from Mexico City
B004J4WKTW|5|A fantastical, mesmerizing story. Erin Morgenstern immerses the reader in her magical, mystical world with spectacular imagery and sensations bound with unexpected emotion.<br />I wanted to devour it, savor it and go back for seconds all at the same time; I regret being so late to the table on this one.  The best novel I have read in a very long time and one I will think about often.
B00CWY76CC|1|All you do in this game is tap, tap, tap, and more tapping.  It is more than a bit boring.
B000092Q7O|4|Films like The Pianist are important to watch for those of us born after WWII.  It is hard to believe such things actually happened, and if we forget such utter depravity is possible it will happen again.  This film shows how one average Jewish Polish family was destroyed during the Holocaust.  It portrays well how powerless human beings truly are against institutionalized evil.<br />     That being said, I could not help but compare this film with \\"Life is Beautiful (LIB).\\"  At first I thought LIB was the better film because it is more \\"entertaining,\\" meaning there is a greater range of emotion -- you laugh and cry.  The Pianist elicits mostly negative emotions, and can get tedious.  But then I realized that this is also a part of the suffering that the protagonist went through -- fear without relief for 5 years, waiting and not knowing what had happened to his family or what would happen to him, having to remain silent, hiding and waiting.  <br />     This movie is probably closer to the truth of human experience than LIB.  Although both protagonists of The Pianist and LIB are very talented, The Pianist does not idealize the life of its main character as does LIB.  The Szpilman family is also not ideal -- they do not seem to be particularly pious or observant Jews, they do not know each other well and there seems to be the average amount of family discord and jealousies.  Wladyslaw (the protagonist) is more lucky than brave or smart.  He survives by playing dead, but then is almost shot by Russians for wearing a German coat.  He allows himself to be separated from his family and is not able to return a kindness to a German officer.  He appears stunned and numb for much of the movie, simply focused on survival.  In short, he is an Everyman with one great talent -- like most of us.<br />     So, is The Pianist a good movie?  It depends -- if you are looking to somehow be entertained by a Holocaust movie -- then watch LIB instead.  However -- if you watch movies to engage your mind and you want to understand the realities of war and evil -- then this movie will help you imagine how terrible war is, and how powerless everyone becomes in its face.  This can be the first step towards whatever action your conscience leads you to take.  The worst evil of all is apathy.

B0000549B0|5|What a great story. Had it on tape but glad to have a DVD. Love Stewart and his character . A&#34;Pooka&#34; is an Irish word for spirit also.
B003JTHXOK|4|Great book!  I was a little disappointed with the ending, It was abrupt.  Maybe it will lead to a sequel!  I can only hope!
B004ZZS4CC|5|This book is Incredibly heartfelt and Jaycee is a true inspiration!!!! The fact that she wrote it without really any help is amazing!

B00004LN16|5|Every couple of eons (or so it seems) AC/DC decided to bless us with a new album. Although not prolific (three studio albums in the last 10 years), their work is normally top-notch, and thankfully, Stiff Upper Lip is no  exception. Although, if you like one AC/DC song, you will pretty much like  them all, there is really a lot to like about this release. The best songs  include the title track, Meltdown, House of Jazz, Safe In NYC, Satellite  Blues, and Can't Stop Rock 'N' Roll. As usual, Angus opens up his seemingly  bottomless bag of awesome riffs, and is punctuated well by his brother on  rhythm, while everything else about the band is as it should be. On a bit  of a downnote though, it must be said that all the songs are short (indeed,  there is not a 5 minute song), and none of them have &quot;long&quot;  classic intros like say, Hells Bells. But the fact remains that this is a  new AC/DC album, and a fine one at that.
B005ZOBNOI|5|This book in one word is amazing, makes you want to read till the end and then wish there was more
0062409859|4|I might be one of the few who enjoyed this book. I thought it was a good read!
B002MQYOFW|4|Page-turning easy reading. The characters are well developed so that the reader feels as if they are real people, flawed and complex but realistic.
B00BQ4NLC8|4|My first time to read Liane Moriarity and liked her style so much so that I downloaded another of hers to read
0345803485|1|Ashamed to admit that I've read all 3 because I had to provide feedback but I really wanted to stop after the first chapter or so. The story line was so much fantasy and based on female weakness. Except Ana didn't come from a background that warranted her succumbing to the ... nonsense of an abused and abusive male child. Her character played on the age-old myth that a woman can change a man once she reels him in.<br /><br />The author didn't develop the story. Grey was supposed to be strong and rich and influential yet he could not protect his family from some basic losers. Ana's voice was too \\"teenagerish\\", like she had no imagination whatsoever. Imagine listening to someone say \\"like\\" 5 times for every 10 words they utter, now substitute it with \\"oh my\\" and \\"holy crap\\". That's 50% of the books. No the plot or language DID NOT improve in the other books. But...sex sells so there was a generous helping of abusive, smutty, trashy sex to sell these books, except it happens on every two pages so gets REALLY flipping boring. Author need to do some research before putting pen to paper again or else face the reality that her books will end up on dusty shelves of dime stores.<br /><br />These books seriously going to be made into a movie? Seriously?
0446678430|3|The wierdest thing (noone has mentioned):<br />After reading between the lines, I'd bet anything that HE HAS WORKED HARDER THAN 80% OF THE GENERAL POPULATION TO GET TO WHERE HE IS!  For some unexplicable reason he presents a life story that saunters into money.  And then he talks about skipping weekends, running several small businesses, going broke, going to work early, leaving late.  That ain't easy stuff -- but he seems quite happy with his life, good for him.<br />...<br />The book is a paradox.  On the one hand, I am EXTREMELY grateful to him because his RDPD \\"kicked me in ...\\" to seriously start investing....  On the other hand his website and RY book comes off as promotions for his whole system.  Kinda like TV evangelist who has some good things to say and lots of things to sell.<br />I've read all the reviews for RY and the reviews cover the spectrum of \\"horrible\\" to \\"supreme enlightenment\\". For good reason.  He does a good job expanding his earlier ideas (the repitition doesn't bother me, then again I blew through the book in an hour and a half in a bookstore) and his overall gestalt for thinking about money is appealing.<br />But his adoration of money leaves a sour taste -- for him being rich seems to be the ultimate.  I would frown upon such an imbalance just as I would frown upon myself else being so \\"artistic\\" that I became irresponsible, hurting family and friends ....<br />...<br />Both books are worth reading, but a healthy dose of skeptism mixed with an open mind should accompany your eyes.  For me, it has gotten me to study investing -- but in the meantime I have other goals and I AM GOING TO RETIRE OLD (hopefully rich) AND ENJOY THE PRESENT.
B000JIHP88|3|The only problem I am having is with the leaves when they go down they are slow to come back up, and sometimes stop completely. Other wise my 4 month old loves the light and music on it when going to sleep.
B00A2AHU2E|5|This is a terrific movie.  This is one of the extended versions, not the theatrical release, which I have found to be a significant improvement.
B00ESNE696|5|A little late to the game since it's in its 5th season i think. But I love binge watching. Great characters and great plots. Love the escape.... does open up the whole world of law offices --- big fan.
B001PJRAUS|5|Love this joy of a movie, what fun!
B009ZQC7MY|5|It is very enjoyable and good relaxing entertainment.  Can't wait to watch it again.  Have no complaints whatsoever.  It's the best.
B009SQRC9E|5|Again, this was purchased for my grandchildren and they watched it many times over the holidays.  I'm sure it was well worth the price I paid...kept them entertained.
B003JTHXOK|5|This book was definitely a good one. I have never read any books by Nicholas Sparks, but I'm glad I did. I couldn't put it down. It was a true love story with a little suspense.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5|It's not as good as the iOS verson but it dose the job
B0001LJC2K|5|You know, honestly, I gotta say...  I'm not sure where people are getting the \\"This sounds exactly like an imitation of Radiohead\\" crap.  Ok, yes, Matthew Bellamy's vocal has some allusions to Thom Yorke's sound.  I own The Bends, OK Computer, Kid A, and Hail to the Thief, and NOTHING on those albums even remotely resemble anything on Absolution.  It is blatantly obvious that a majority of the detractors heard from their friends, or other various hearsay that Muse were a blatant rip-off of Radiohead.  Then they listened to like three songs, and decided to say the same thing.      As far as I'm concerned, Muse's sound is completely original, more approachable than Radiohead, cleaner, less annoying, and CATCHY.  God... Apocalypse Please, Time is Running Out, Sing For Absolution, Stockholm Syndrome, Falling Away With You, Hysteria, Butterflies & Hurricanes, The Final Print, and especially Thoughts Of a Dying Atheist...  THEY SOUND NOTHING LIKE RADIOHEAD.  Not only that, they are absolutely fantastic songs.  And they call sound different from one another each offering a different greatness, from the non-mainstream drumming in Apocalypse Please, to the great beat and riff synchronization in the 2nd verse of Time is Running Out, to the epic singing choral section in Sing For Absolution, to the passion of Falling Away With You, to the In Your Face guitar work in Stockholm Syndrome (which, I may add, is probably one of the most original songs I've heard in a very long time), and finally the greatness of Hysteria and Butterflies, and Atheist.      This is what I ask of anybody with a free ear and an open mind when it comes to music.  Ignore the pleas from the ignorant people senselessly stating that Muse is a Radiohead rip-off.  While there are some distant similarities, Muse is completely their own band, and worlds far and away better than what Radiohead could ever be.  Buy this album, give it a chance, and I guarantee you won't be disappointed.    4.9/5 (sorry only Dream Theater's Scenes From a Memory gets a 5/5)

B0009ICXX0|5|Comparisons between \\"Stage Beauty\\" and \\"Shakespeare in Love\\" are inevitable, but this 2004 film does not suffer much by the contrast to that Oscar winner for Best Picture. Both films deal with the conventions of the English stage that dictated the roles of women be played by men and while both have a woman who wants to play a woman's role, this one has a man who wants to play only women's roles. Both films conclude with a live performance in which the focal character ends up playing the opposite of their original roles. Both films are intricately involved with the Shakespeare plays being performed to such an extent that it goes beyond life imitating art. But whereas \\"Shakespeare in Love\\" was about writing and love, \\"Stage Beauty\\" is about acting and love, and I think it is ultimately more about its primary artistic focus than about romance.<br /><br />When it comes to performing the classical plays of Shakespeare or the tragedies of the ancient Greeks, I believe in realistic (nee naturalistic) acting rather than following the acting conventions of those periods in contemporary performances. I enjoy those conventions, but I also think that if you can break the poetic constraints of the dialogue you can make those texts come alive for contemporary audiences. So one of the reasons \\"Stage Beauty\\" resonates so strong for me is that it not only endorses but also celebrates the idea that such realism can have much more of a profound impact on an audience that those historically accurate sytlistic conventions.<br /><br />Half the inspiration for the original play \\"Compleat Female Stage Beauty\\" was when playwright Jeffrey Hatcher came across an entry in the diary of Samuel Pepys (Hugh Bonneville) that the actor Ned Kynaston was the most beautiful woman in the house when he was portraying one upon the stage. The other half was the decision of Charles II (Rupert Everett) to not only revoke the prohibition of women acting on stage, but to declare instead that henceforth only women would play female roles on the English stage. Thus we have the story of the most famous female impersonator of his day suddenly thrust into a world where he is no longer allowed to do what he does best.<br /><br />Billy Crudup plays Kynaston and his success as a woman on stage hinges in part on the acting conventions of the time. He has studied the affected mannerisms demanded of the women characters on stage and if you would fault Kynaston's portrayal as Desdemona you can level the same charges against the Othello being played by Betterton (Tom Wilkinson). This is simply what acting was during the Stuart Restoration. Pointedly, a pair of women with aspirations towards acting on the stage doom Kynaston's career, one being his dresser, Maria (Claire Danes), who has memorized each inflection and gesture of his Desdemona and performed it in a tavern (which is technically not a theater). The other is Nell Gwynn (Zoe Tapper), the king's mistress, who has more than the king's ear when it comes to persuading him to change the way things are in the theaters of London.<br /><br />There is, as you would suspect, some sexual tension between Maria and Kynaston, although it is more ardent on her part for most of the story. She loves him, but he loves acting. His argument against women playing women is that there is no \\"trick\\" to it. I was going to say that he means no skill to such performances, but he really does mean trick. Kyanston has studied his craft and literally suffered as his training stripped him of every aspect of acting masculine. He has the trick of creating the illusion of a perfect woman (for example, the five positions of feminine subjugation), without the skill of acting the part, and he is offended by the very idea that being born a woman would give Maria or any other woman any advantage in doing so. It is only when Maria and Kynaston discuss the tricks of being a woman versus being a man, after his life has been taken away from him, that he not only seesher as a woman but begins to see himself as a man. For her the key is her admission that she has never been able to do his Desdemona, not because it is mimicry, but because she disagrees vehemently with his premise that the character would not fight back when Othello murders her in her bed chamber.<br /><br />This all sets up the grand finale and for me the last act of \\"Stage Beauty\\" when we get to the rehearsal and performance of the play is totally captivating. What we see is no less than the birth of naturalistic acting, which is exactly why I was so absorbed and why I know that those who have acted or directed actors will respond to those scenes and this movie in different ways from those whose vantage point has always been as members of the audience. Danes shows flashes of brilliance which we have not seen from her since her death scene in \\"Little Women.\\" But Crudup gets special mention here, not only because his role is the pivotal one in the story and because he gets to play both Desdemona and Othello, but because his character is put through the wringer and has to evince two different styles of acting.t only sees her as a woman but begins to see himself as a man.

B0000025D0|5|When Springsteen was churning out his biggest hits I must have been around nine years old. Suffice to say I missed Born in the U.S.A when it hit the market. Come puberty I started to discover Rock & Roll. Who didn't. The Boss just disbanded the E-street band and recorded the Human Touch. With teststerone raging through my body I let the Boss pas by. I don't think anybody can blame me. His albums by than were disastrous. The Red Hot Chilli Peppers and Nirvana were just more apt for my needs at the time. The boss wasn't cool enough. To stadiumrock. Happily every band of brothers has one in their midst who just won't walk the line. He was a Springsteen fan and managed to catch me by suprise by playing Adam Raised a Cain without telling me who it was. I was amused by it at the time but it wasn't untill years later when I bought the album I realised how good it really is.  <br /> <br />This album truly is the one where his songwriting and big sound come together perfectly. The album does a better job at teenage angst than Nirvana ever did. Springsteen's main strength is as a story teller. And he had some stories to tell. Most compelling racing in the street. It's bleak scenery is perfect for cars. Someway adding colour to dismal lifes where there is none. Badlands is Rock and Roll gospel. Candy's room's fierce sexual energy. Springsteen should've made this album when I was fifteen. I would've learned how to play the guitar and would've become a stadiumrocker. Now I'm just punching my fist in the air with other overaged Springsteen addicts.

B000002UDD|5|The most underrated thrash metal album of all time opens with a whirling, precipitous instrumental that truly creates the sensation of plummeting helplessly Into the Lungs of Hell.  Set the World Afire, although not a particularly catchy tune, is a showcase of shredding, dissonant riffs.  Anarchy in the U.S.A. exemplifies how Megadeth, bestowed with proficient musicians no matter what the line-up, eclipses the original anytime they cover a song.  Mary Jane is a haunting track replete with melodrammatic emotion, a paragon of what a metal song should be.  One of the week points of the album is the lackluster chorus of 502, while the rest of the song runs smoothly and evokes quite well a sense of speeding recklessly down the highway.  Although the beginning of In My Darkest Hour is reminiscent of For Whom the Bell Tolls, the more dynamic and sincere Megadeth ballad will make you forget the Metallica hit.  While seemingly incomplete, Liar is nevertheless a worthwhile listen and maliciously fun.  Although not as impressive as So Far, So Good...So What!'s grandiose overture, the final track, Hook in Mouth, closes the album on a nevertheless high note by combining catchy lyrics with a spine-chilling guitar solo.  Megadeth's third release is certainly not without its foibles.  Flaws in production have left the drums in the lurch.  Due to the departure of the skilled jazz musicians Chris Poland and Gar Samuelson, the groove that characterized the band's first two records has diminished.  Yet, So Far... So Good... So What! is saturated with raw innovation and nimble guitar virtuosismo, which make it one of the best thrash albums of all time.
B002BU0DPE|2|Like other reviewers, they are cheaply made but decent sound quality.  They do break easily on the left side by the mic.  My son only had them a month and they broke right where E-1 said they might.  Be careful and handle with care.  Will not buy these again....will try a sturdier pair.
1592400876|5|My sister gave this to me for my birthday.  I have been living under a rock, so I had not yet heard of this book.  When I opened it, I said, &quot;Wow.  A book about punctuation.  Thanks, Ashley.&quot;  I thought it was one of those gifts people give English grads, because they've run out of other ideas.  My mom quickly jumped in and said, &quot;No, I've heard it's supposed to be really good.&quot;  I gave it a chance, and aside from the less than stellar Frank McCourt intro, I fell in love with the book.  Previous to this, I would have laughed at the idea of a funny and interesting book about punctuation.  I find that I am unable to stop thanking my sister, and I will probably be giving this book as a gift to all my friends.  They will read it and like it.
B00BWBHIUG|3|ok for 4+? but a little too complicated for younger ones. too many text boxes to navigate before getting to game activities. maybe we'll try again in a year.
B00BUCXVPI|2|If you like Tom Cruise action movies this is one.  I find they become predictable and boring after time.  Tired of guns going off and cars crashing.
B008Y5FNL4|4|Maybe tame now, by current standards, but the insanity of war holds up well.  You need to think about what this movie is saying
B0001ZMWQO|4|Ever since the year 2000 it seems music has taken a dive for the worst, with no NEW \\"real\\" artists coming out making \\"real\\" music in the last 5 years. <br /> <br />Except for \\"A Perfect Circle\\" and \\"Franz Ferinhad\\". <br /> <br /> <br />Thank goodness Franz Ferdinhad came along.
B00006AUIG|3|I rented this movie because I am from Mass originally and had never heard of Danvers state. I must say some parts are a bit confusing...But all ties together in the end..what I liked mosy about it was the DVD version has Extras, They speak with the actors who actually were very creeped out to work in this place.I think its well worth renting and giving it a whirl...The whole abandoned Mental Hospital is creepy in itself!
B00CH26TL8|5|A fun game and just the right increments in challenge.<br />o
B00DJFIMW6|3|its really awesome an addictive but I cant link my facebook account or download the other two levels so I cant find macho or menna an I cant finish my missions then
B007IXWKUK|5|I was surprised at how good these books were. I loved the slow draw to one another. How it works in real life. And the erotic parts were not disgusting.
B00BAXFECK|3|Dis not deserve the Pulitzer.  Save your self the time and try another book.
B0054JZC6E|4|great ecspecially if your bored. I give it a four star because you have to play the same ones over and over before you can unlock more.
B00G6HO368|5|Great movie, but I am a Pride & Prejudice sucker.
B00HVJB4VM|5|Fantastic story about the market advantages gained by technology and the willingness of financial firms to remain consciously ignorant as long as they continue raking in profits.
B0060MYM7O|5|Having the Blue-ray for the series and watching all of the extra content truly make getting GOT worth it.  The special features and behind the scene features add much more to your viewing experience and deeper understanding of what the directors/showrunners were trying to do.  I always seem to appreciate the shows more after understanding all the work, thought, and emotions that many different people put in to create this one fantastic show.  The audio commentary too are also fantastic to listen too.<br /><br />The DVD and Digital copies are also a very nice addition to this package.  I am able to give my parents the DVD, which to this point still has Chinese subtitles, so they can understand the show even better.  The digital copies are nice to have so I can bring it anywhere!
B00FAPF5U0|5|TOOOOOOO  fun and makes you think.
B00I8Q77Y0|5|Nice game, same thing as floppy Bird.it's addictive I like how it has more color than floppy Bird;) totally recommend it
B000JMKNV0|5|It was actually quite enjoyable reading the book after the seeing the movie because I caught a lot of things along the way I perhaps wouldn't have otherwise.  I thought it was going to be a waste of time since I knew how it ends, but I was wrong.  Generally, there's nothing worse for me than reading a mystery when you know the ending.  However, even after being familiar with the story, it was still a page turner because it is so well written.  If you're ambivalent about reading this because you saw the movie, don't be.  Go for it.
B00AREIAI8|5|This game is really fun.........
B00IIUATDM|5|very good
B0087IT8FK|5|A must see incredible film
B007J4T2G8|5|Wonderful. Ready for the next book. Would definitely recommend to anyone. It really draws you in and keeps you hooked.
B005K17RU0|1|My husband was looking for an app which provided an up to date and live in motion radar due to his job. We downloaded this one and as soon as we put the radar in motion, it froze our new Kindle Fire, and since the battery was fully charged, we had to wait 4 hours for it to die, hoping once it did, we could uninstall it and it would fix it. Luckily it did.. I was starting to worry there for a little while. Reading everyone else's reviews, I'm not sure why this happened, but just beware of this before installing.
B0071PS7AC|3|Ok for free app., but prefer  Galaxy Bowl, which is a better game. Do like the fact though that you are playing against a computer player in this game.
B00QW8TYWO|5|Fun challenging fuuuuuunnnnnnnnnn
B007Y36K46|4|The film is not an exact reproduction of &#34;A Princess of Mars,&#34; but then Deja Thoris was not a very interesting character in the original, and the film version is a considerably improved improved character.  The basic world of Barsoom &#34;built&#34; for the film could have been more faithful to Burrough's Barsoom, but again it could have been far worse.  The flyers were my personnel disappointment.  I've always liked Burrough's version while they would not have been visually as exotic, would still have worked just fine.
B00DURGZHW|4|This is a good movie with a really strong cast. Great story, good plot and is pretty even throughout. For me, the very best thing about this movie is Matthew McConaughey. I have always thought that he was and underrated actor and had not had the right movies/scripts to really draw out his talents. No longer. This movie along with his recently winning an Academy Award for best actor in Dallas Buyers Club has elevated him to a place he deserves. Not bad for a former truck driver from a small town in east Texas. I highly recommend this movie.
B00GN76K4Y|3|It's ok, not used it a lot yet.
B003G4W49C|5|I loved this book and I chose this rating because there is so much detail in every paragraph that even the movie couldn't fit it all inside. Read this book!
B000023X9W|5|Lord knows Neil has had no shortage of acoustic songs and albums throughout his career, but none sound like or bear anything but a superficial resemblance to Silver and Gold.  Whereas albums like After the Gold Rush and Harvest had a yearning, desperate feel; Comes a Time a wistful aceeptance of life's challenges, here Neil sounds like he's perfectly in the moment - contented to be where and who he is, and joyed to be doing it with the people he's with (I mean his family here, not the instrumentalists on this album).<br />Some songs are standouts, all of them are wonderful. The album is performed in a laid-back, homedown manner, as if Neil had simply got his family together in the living room, got the fireplace going, made sure there were enough marshmallows for the hot chocolate, and simply got out his acoustic and played these songs for his loved ones.<br />I really recommend this album quite highly.  To say &quot;it ranks this high or that high&quot; in his catalog is really inaccurate and unrepresentative.  And I don't know if it's fair to say &quot;if you like Tonight's the Night, but not Harvest Moon, then this won't do it for you&quot; or &quot;If you're a fan of Comes A Time, you'll like this&quot;.  To me, this is a collection by a master songwriter not trying to impress anyone, just writing and performing songs, as he says in Buffalo Springfield Again, &quot;for the fun of it&quot;. <br />Should you get this album?  That depends.  Do you like music?
B00004XMTJ|4|i would have loved to see this live. As a cat owner, i wanted to show my family the classic Broadway play! The great dancing, music and story make this a timeless classic!
B00ISJSPXY|1|This movie is such an extreme disappointment. The middle of the story repeats itself over and over. No real story line. I'm sorry that you've made such a great story into a money maker, only.
B00BUCXVPI|4|Its good one
B00H1UK3UO|5|This is history at its most jarring, love at its most surprising, and homophobia at its most bitter beginning.  A must read for anyone interested in early Holland.
B0090EJR1K|2|There were funny parts; however, you saw them in the previews. The movie was highly predictable and as usual had distasteful jokes.
B004XJRQUQ|5|Seriously captivating! Thought this would be another twilight but it was far better. Story has great depth and will leave you wanting more.

B00FEPQ212|5|Excellent, funny, though provoking.  I felt like I had skied myself.  Thank you for a wonderful read.  Keep it up.
B008JFUTT0|5|What a great documentary!  What a great story!  A tale of a 70's singer-songwriter superstar named Sixto Rodriguez who actually had no clue he was a superstar.  I think what makes this film so great to me is how calm and cool Rodriguez actually is throughout the entire span of events which is around 40 years.  He's a very genuine person who takes everything that happens to him in stride.  And his music is actually quite amazing too!  I ended up buying the movie from Amazon and saw Rodriguez - Cold Fact in my local record store and picked that up too!
B00E0MCYPS|3|The racing game was fun but it was hard to steer the car.  Maybe a few more times playing it then I will get the hang of it.

B006C3Q6GG|5|Beautifully written.  Full of information.  Only downside would be that reading on a Kindle makes it hard to flip back to the picture in the beginning that is a diagram with names of all the sails.
B002JVWQSW|5|The characters are all pretty people with great comedic timing, but the secret to the hilarity on this show is the writing.  Watch these episodes more than once and listen carefully, oftentimes the writing reaches comedic genius.  Love all of the characters.  While this is nothing like real life as you watch it, when you think about it it is so real it is scary.  Watch a couple of episodes on TV and you have to have this, trust me
B0036EH3XE|1|Worst ending to a TV series ever.  Lost revolutionized the way I watch TV - and not in a good way.  For six years I rode the wave of cliff hangers, Easter eggs, mysteries and awesome WTF moments, always believing we were building towards a solid ending. Instead the characters I loved were manipulated and twisted so many times as to be hardly recognisable, and the mysteries of the island, time travel reoccurring numbers and disappearing cabins all became a big fat pile of red herrings.  I can't imagine ever wanting to re-watch the series when I now know that 90% of what I watch has no meaning whatsoever.
B007N6EUHI|1|Oops. I purchased the app. Tried 8 times to instal but in vain. Called customer service. They said the only thing u can do is take a refund coz dis App isn't working at Galaxy due to BUGS in the App. Disappointed😞 me a lot. And i repent on this waste of time !!!
B008LXZFH6|4|Had to watch it before seeing the sequel. Glad I did. Funny! Amazon does great again! Can't wait to watch the next one!

B0033H7VI6|4|I have several knife makers that I follow and this style tends to be the trend now, but I really like it. The blade is thick and heavy but this speaks to me of a knife that is ready for anything around the camp, or other things. I could not give it five stars because of one design issue. The blade is beveled more like an axe, and while that may prolong its durability, it is a bugger to sharpen. I actually had to file the bevel down to get a decent edge on it. Now that was my choice but I could not tolerate it as it was. I saw the reviews of the knife and went hunting for it and no one had any. I was surprised at how quickly this arrived.

1595141979|4|It's a big day at St. Vladimir's Academy. It's the start of the field experience where each Dhampir will be paired up with a Moroi in a six week training exercise. Novice guardians will act as actual Guardians out in the real world protecting their charges from &#34;Strigoi&#34; attacks conducted by the teachers. Everyone is excited. Especially seventeen-year-old Rose Hathaway. Six weeks of hanging out with her best Moroi friend, Lissa Dragomir, not having to attend classes other than Lissa's. Doing what she's been doing her whole life: protecting Lissa.<br /><br />However, when a fellow novice and friend, Eddie Castle, receives Lissa as his charge, Rose thinks that it's some sort of mistake and is perplexed. But it gets worse when she learns that her charge will be Lissa's boyfriend, Christian Ozera.<br /><br />As if that wasn't bad enough, Rose finds out that Victor Dashkov, a royal Moroi who previously kidnapped and tortured Lissa for his own personal gain, has yet to be sentenced and is awaiting trail that will happen soon. Outraged, Rose demands to be taken to testify upon learning that neither she, Lissa, nor Christian will be allowed to go.<br /><br />Add seeing your dead friend on campus and you've got a whole lot of crazy. But crazy doesn't even begin to describe things as Rose's temper soon starts getting out of control.<br /><br />The next six weeks are certainly bound to be interesting for everyone.<br /><br />Wow. That's one word to describe Shadow Kiss. So much happens, that it becomes impossible to put the book down for a break! Let's start with the three major parts of Shadow Kiss before diving into other things.<br /><br />The Field Experience.<br /><br />As said, for six weeks novices will be in the acting role of Guardians for the Moroi. Rose is assigned to Christian. This is something that I found interesting. The reader basically assumes that Rose will be given Lissa as a charge due to the bond that the pair share. So when it's given that she would be assigned Christian, I couldn't stop smiling. It's not surprise that these two are my favorite duo. They may not get along all the time or fully care about each other, but their chemistry works completely.<br /><br />The fierceness and loyalty both share towards Lissa helps this duo get along. But when Rose begins spending more and more time with Christian, it's clear that she really doesn't hate him. (Something she actually admits when he asks) I just wish that they would get along semi-better than they normally do, because they really do make an amazing team. But I do love the snarkiness between them both. There's also a part towards the end where something happens. Rose does a quick check in on Lissa through their bond and &#34;see's&#34; that she's alright, but Christian isn't with her.<br /><br />And since Rose doesn't have the same ability with Christian, she begins to worry. What she does proves that she obviously does care for Christian as a friend. Honestly, if the entire book was just about these two, I would be a happy camper.<br /><br />Seeing A Dead Friend.<br /><br />It's obvious who the friend is. Mason. The poor guy was killed by a Strigoi in Frostbite, and Rose has felt guilty about the whole thing ever since. And because of this, she thinks that she's hallucinating, but it could also be caused by the exhaustion she feels from the field experience. We don't see Mason all that much throughout the book, but when we do, we see that Rose hasn't really gotten over the whole thing.<br /><br />It's a saddening thing to read since Rose is described as someone who doesn't let anything get to her. But even the death of a friend is enough to make someone hurt. There is something wrong and this is why Mason is appearing, but I can't get into that without spoiling the entire book.<br /><br />Victor Dashkov.<br /><br />Early on we learn that Victor has yet to stand trial for his crimes against Lissa. There's even a possibility that he may be set free. Rose,Lissa, and Christian, however, are not allowed to testify against Dashkov due to the fact that the Queen, Tatiana Ivashkov, doesn't want the public to get ahold of his crimes. But since he's related to the Queen, Adrian is the one who gets the three to the Royal Court to testify.<br /><br />On the flight to and from the Court, Rose starts to experience something. (This will be gotten to later) The world building with the Royal Court falls somewhat flat. There's the outline as to what the place would look like, but it's almost hard to imagine everything aside from it being the same size as St. Vladimir's. To me, the whole trial seemed to be a filler of sorts, but the way it was handled appears to be setting something up for later on. It's still not clear, but actions speak louder than words so to say.<br /><br />I feel like the trip was for us to see Rose have a complete freak out away from the Academy. She begins seeing things that she shouldn't on the way to the Court. Dead things. Pressure begins pressure up against her skull causing the pain she experiences to be massive. But it's on the way back to the Academy that things get weirder for Rose. Reasons for this are made clear towards the end of the novel, and I'll leave it at that.<br /><br />And, of course, a Vampire Academy wouldn't be complete without its romance. Things begin to heat up between Rose and Dimitri once again. This along with other events puts their relationship to the test more than ever. I'll be completely honest here: I'm not a big fan of this relationship. The whole things feels sort of forced and awkward. To me it feels to be an almost insta-love, but not completely, and this is speaking from their very first encounter back in the first book.<br /><br />The chemistry feels kind of … bland as well. I'm still not too clear on my exact reasoning for not caring about this particular romance, but hopefully it'll become clear as I continue to read on in the series.<br /><br />One of my favorite things that happen in Shadow Kiss is that Rose is made to go to therapy. Here is where she questions certain aspects of her life. Such as being Lissa's Guardian, her relationship with Dimitri, Mason's death, her mother, and what she really wants in life. I'm extremely sad that we hardly got anytime with her sessions. Maybe two-three of them at the most, and that seemed to be it.<br /><br />There is a part after something major happens at the very end of the book. The scene with Rose and Adrian. Honestly, it made me upset. It, to me, mirrored something else that Rose asked him to do as a test to herself prior to the major plot events. It made me disappointed, and she dropped down a notch or two in my book.<br /><br />Regardless, Shadow Kiss is a heart pounding follow up to Frostbite, and one book you won't want to put down until it's over.Lissa, and Christian, however, are not allowed to testify against Dashkov due to the fact that the Queen, Tatiana Ivashkov, doesn't want the public to get ahold of his crimes.

B000I9U9A4|3|I actually purchased this to give a friend. So I cannot tell you anything about it. But I don't think they would have requested without hearing good things about it!!!
B0002YLC24|4|First off, if you haven't already seen the first film, \\"Before Sunrise,\\" also from director Richard Linklater, then stop and go rent or buy that film for a solid romantic backstory.  After that, this film is an excellent continuation with all the fantastic acting nuance and phenomenal chemistry that Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy still have.  Richard Linklater even used these two actors for an scene in the animated film \\"Waking Life\\" to great effect.  Most of \\"Before Sunset\\" is basically one long conversation between two former one-night-stand lovers talking about where they are now in life, where they've been, where they think they are going, what they believe in, whether or not \\"love\\" is a luxury they simply cannot afford in their now too complicated lives.  Ultimately, this is a very realistic look at intimacy, all the while hoping these two do end up together.  The only \\"flaws\\" in the film are two-fold(particularly for hopeless romantics): 1)the film is too short, 2)the film is very linear.  You want these two to go on forever connecting, all the while only a glance away from a passionate embrace.  By \\"linear,\\" I mean that nothing especially exciting happens during the film other than a re-awakening of long-dormant emotions let loose in the Parisian dusk through conversation and walking from location to location.  However, this is a very good film with some great chemistry between the principle actors, and an excellent continuation from the underground hit that was \\"Before Sunrise.\\"  Both are worth owning, especially if you believe in love.  Thank you.
B00CWY76CC|5|I found this game as fun as the last one.  I like the puzzle aspect of these games, and looked forward to playing each day.

B009ZQC7MY|5|I looked forward to watching it each evening. The acting was superb!
B009ZQC7MY|5|I was not able to view the series as it was televised and now I am hooked.  There are a lot of programs but very few are worth spending any time viewing.  Excellent series!
B006GLLREU|5|I fell in love with this series when it first aired on HBO. Don't let the title fool you. It's about life for the Fisher family as they deal with business, family and personal challenges. A top-notch drama series that's worth a look.

B001P9KR8U|5|Director Danny Boyle's 'Slumdog Millionaire' is a touching, moving and completely riveting cinematic experience. I was blown away not just by its poignant story, but also by its striking contrast in cultural and societal differences from our own here in the Western Hemisphere. In addition to its compelling screenplay, it's also beautifully photographed and captures the backdrop of the dauntingly wretched conditions in the slums of modern-day India as meticulously and realistically as any movie can and probably ever will. The musical score is quite amazing and unlike any other I've ever heard, which hilights several intense dramatic sequences of chasing and running.<br /><br />The story opens up with Jamal Malik (Dev Patel), a seemingly uneducated teenager from the slums of Mumbai who gets a much coveted, one-in-a-million chance to escape from his hopelessly indigent existence by appearing on India's 'Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?' gameshow where contestants have a chance to win monetary prizes by answering a variety of trivia questions. He's had an unprecedented hot-streak on the show thus far by answering a rather difficult and seemingly esoteric series of questions and in the movie's opening moments, Jamal is just one question shy of winning the grand prize of 20,000,000 rupees. But the show is out of time before he has the opportunity and must reconvene the following night. Following the episode's airing, Jamal is arrested and detained after the police and the show's host (Anil Kapoor) suspect him of cheating. While in poilce custody, Jamal recounts through a series of vivid flashbacks to his childhood that brilliantly reveal how he knows the answers to all of the questions he has answered correctly.<br /><br />We learn that as children growing up in the squalid, nightmarish poverty of Mumbai's slums, Jamal and his older brother, Salim, were orphaned at a young age when their mother was killed in an attack from an angry Hindu mob on their shantytown. Together with their female companion, Latika (whom Jamal loves even as a child), the three band together as a scrappy, self-styled version of 'The Three Musketeers', their favorite literary work from school. They stick together and endure a wretched existence on the muddy streets that is at times despondent and depressing. But this is where the movie's message of hopefulness comes in as the three are a plucky group who display courageous fortitude and spirited resourcefulness despite their trying circumstances. Jamal and Salim become separated from Latika after escaping from a nefarious child exploiter where the two subsequently take to riding the many railroad trains crisscrossing India. The trains become a source of livelihood for the two brothers as they manage to eek out a scant subsistence on the trains by peddling to, hustling and in some cases outright stealing from the trains' passengers. There's even a rather funny passage in this part of the movie where Jamal and Salim end up at the Taj Mahal where they hustle tourists as faux tour guides and even steal their shoes to sell on the streets! The two brothers continue this for several years until they eventually end up in the booming metroplois of Bombay. Here, after becoming employed as a tea server at a mega communications call center, Jamal then gets the opportunity at appearing on the gameshow, something every teenager and young adult in his society longs for. It's at this moment the story segues back into the point we originally see in the movie's beginning. After being grilled and harshly interrogated by the police, Jamal is set free and allowed to continue on his final night of the gameshow after he becomes a national celebrity and hero to the public who demand to see him get his chance to win the grand prize. But having not seen his long-lost love Latika (Freida Pinto) in years, his shot at winning the jackpot is more about reuniting with her than it is about wealth.<br /><br />Slumdog Millionaire is a love storyat its core, but there are no sweeping romantic locations and visuals. Jamal, Salim and Latika grow up in a level of squalid, forlorn poverty that makes even the most impoverished American ghettos look like a vision of paradise by comparison. Still, it's surprising how much their culture has been influenced (or polluted) by the West. Interestingly enough, the poor of India are seeming to be as obsessed with gameshows and tv as we are, possibly because it's their sole lifeline to a better existence so few in their society get to experience. A wonderful movie that inspires and teaches us that true knowledge and wisdom comes not from age or education, but from the sum total of our life experiences. A beautifully irreverent and moving cinematic experience with one of the most amazingly original endings and credit sequences I've ever seen in a movie. Always interesting and at times fascinating.

B005ZOBNOI|3|I'd be lying if I said this wasn't a page turner. It was good. In fact, there are some lines and observations and straight up truths about the facts of life that are artfully composed. But aside from that: the diction is overstated and flowery, while the story is predictable. Nevertheless, it is worth the read for those interspersed nuggets, and characters, who while predictable and typical in some ways, made you fall in love with them.
B0055SWM08|5|Graphics are lively. Action is smooth.  Puzzles are challenging but not so much as to dissuade one from playing.  Very enjoyable.
6303407188|5|This is one movie I like to watch over and over. A brilliant story on the life of one of Hollywoods independent directors. Tim Burtons unique ability as a director shines as always. Johnny Depp, Martin Landau and company are  all superior. Ed Wood did more for science fiction than any other director  of his day. The movie shows the constant struggle of a man and his dream,  how ingenuity and perserverance can bring out the creativity in a man, and  what Hollywood does to people. With very little money Ed created a  completly different vehicle for movie making thus insuring his place in  history. Tim Burtons portrail of Ed Wood should be an inspiration to  independent film makers everywhere. Martin Landau gives an excellant  portrail of Bela Lagosi. Very sad to see how Hollywood turned its back on a  stage and screen legend and how he died broke like so many other movie  greats. It took the talents of Tim Burton to tell this story.
B0000640SB|5|in 1997, my fourth of july weekend [stunk]! but there was one highlight--not the fireworks, which are becoming boring to me. the one highlight of that fourth of july weekend was seeing Men In Black. i laughed nearly through the whole film. that is the sign of a great film. and i eagerly wait for MIB2 this summer.

B0013ND30M|5|My granddaughter loves this movie and so we have watched this over and over together.  The fairies are her favorities.
B00B7PIRIE|5|I sat down and watched all three DVD's  at the same time and I loved all of them and cried at the end of two of them.
B000W1V7KE|2|I don't understand why this movie ships with the Toshiba HD DVD player.  The intent of the filmaker was to give the look of a 60's era film.  For someone viewing their first HD DVD - they will be extremely disappointed in the picture.  I tweaked with all picture settings trying to make it look better.  After a bit of research, I learned that this was the way the film was produced.  Just don't let this be your first HD DVD viewing experience!
B00005QIPH|5|In a year that produced several outstanding CD's, this one is the best.  Not only the best of this year, possibly the best CD released since I've been alive (1972).  A future Hall of Fame canidate, this one is equally good as such heavyweights as &quot;The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico&quot;, The Stooges &quot;Fun House&quot;, and Television's &quot;Marquee Moon&quot;.  30 years from now, this one will still be around...guaranteed.
B00003W8NM|1|The film is a malicious and ugly descent into self-justifiable darkness. <br /> The film gently escorts the viewer along with the premise that the average life is awful so lets start fight clubs and hit each other. Fairly harmless premise and if it ended there it would be acceptable, however the fights have several motives: 1. they're used to desensitize the viewer to aggressive violence for whats to come later and 2. the harmless fight clubs have the same form and structure as the terroristic Project Mayhem, so the film tries to convince the viewer that if Fight Clubs are good, terroristic Project Mayhem is good. <br /> They bring you on board with the fights and reinforce the view that 'regular' life is so awful you cant make anything of it so just give up on it. A horribly cynical and destructive view of life. Once they have your thinking on this inevitable track, they then push you along to making terrorism an extension of Fight Club(i.e. cool). Strangely enough the film rails against society endlessly through the film yet the target of Project Mayhem are credit card companies. If society is so unredeemable how would blowing up credit card companies and resetting debt to 0 accomplish anything at all? The film doesnt even make sense in its own perverted world view. <br /> <br /> Once Project Mayhem becomes revealed the film becomes more and more hazy on what exactly is going on. Obviously its some sort of internal struggle, some say its a visual depiction of mind control, some say MPD. The film didnt have the guts to explain itself so we'll never know for sure.  <br /> <br /> All I do know is that anyone suggesting someone give up on life and actively destroy society because its not perfect(which is exactly what this film suggests) is wrong. We've seen what happens when a whole nation takes on this self-destructive mindset, it happened in Communist Russia and Communist China to diabolical results.
0547884591|5|\\"The 4-Hour Chef: The Simple Path to Cooking Like a Pro, Learning Anything, and Living the Good Life\\" - by Timothy Ferriss<br /><br />I would highly recommend you buy this book. Yes, you will dramatically improve your culinary prowess in the leanest time possible..... but that is only the beginning.<br /><br />This book is so much more. I call it a path to personal happiness. Why? The answer is Personal growth.<br /><br />If you have any interest at all in learning how you can crush new skill acquisition, take on challenges and overcome them with minimal time and effort, and unlock a world of personal growth - then I recommend you buy this book.<br /><br />I am a massive fan of learning. I am an even bigger fan of personal growth and taking aggressive action towards personal happiness.<br /><br />I love this book (i got a pre launch copy) and consider the best book Tim has written.
B009UNGYHG|5|Great protection for my bluetooth and assures me that it will be charged with minimal effort whener needed.  A great product for the price.
B000063DIA|5|I love it. It was a time of major changes for Iron Maiden: First change in lineup since \\"Piece Of Mind\\", and with new guitarist Janick Guers they went back to a more raw sound... It's sounds almost like their first album. Also at that point, Bruce Dickinson gave up all the high pitch wailing that makes a lot of people hate Maiden, and he went for deeper, angrier vocals. He finally reveals his sense of humour with those \\"Hee!Hees!\\".  <br />After all those extremely successful albums, all they could do was decline, but \\"No Prayer For The Dying\\" includes their ONLY #1 HIT SINGLE \\"Bring Your Daughter... To The Slaughter\\". Come On... Isn't that a great song?  <br />Once again, the people who hate this album are the music fascists who can't accept changes and would have liked another classic album with Adrian Smith on guitar... GET A LIFE!  <br /> <br />P.S.: That new cover is rubbish. The man being strangled has been wiped away. Now Eddie isn't strangling anything. He looks like a pathetic zombie.
B007U4DIM6|5|Enjoyed this movie very much. It is good for all ages. Everyone needs a laugh or two and they will get it from this movie.
B000ASATWQ|5|NOW EVERY SINGLE TRACK ISN'T GOING TO BE A HIT, AS THAT GOES WITH EVERY ALBUM, EVEN BOB MARLEY HAD ALBUMS WITH OK SONGS, BUT THATS REALLY NOT THE POINT. REGGAE IS MOSTLY REAL TALK ANYWAY, SHOWS REALITY, AND ALMOST ALWAYS HAS A MESSAGE IN THE SONGS.JAMROCK WAS A HIT, NOT ONLY WITH GOOD RYTHM, BUT A MESSAGE, PPL WE ARE NOT ONLY LOOKING FOR BEATS AND RYHMES.

0312330537|5|We read this book in our Bookclub. Opinion varied as it was a very long book. However it is a very interesting and very well written book. It held my interest throughout. I learned alot about India and the customs from there, both good and bad. I loved some of the philosophies and wish that I could remember them all.
B001C5ZR1E|5|GREAT ALBUM !!!!!
B001P9EQH8|5|I bought this to use especially w/ a pair of Sony Over-Ear headphones that I wanted to use with my new 160gb iPod. Well, the iPod just couldn't give them enough output or power. So I was HOPING that this would do the trick. Well, IT DID!!!! Now my headphones are just the right volume, and it made all of my In-Ear phones REALLY LOUD and with a better sound overall. Def the best $25.00 I have ever spent on anything electronic-wise ;) I would DEFINITELY suggest this to anyone looking for more power and volume out of their head/ear-phones :)
B009GEEMLY|4|I am not a fan of any of the comic book based movies as I didn't grow up reading the comic books and feel that those who did tend to be a little fanatical and immature even in adulthood.  With that said, I have an open mind and really liked this movie.  The dialog was witty and funny and the action was very intertaining.  Well worth the the time and price even if you are not a geeky comic fan.
B005ZOBNOI|5|Read for a book club. Easy read. Sad and beautiful. I think most people would enjoy reading it. But get some Kleenex first. ;).
B00B5P37IG|1|I must not know how to use it because I don't see anything of interest. The picture quality is poor.
B00122PUS2|1|no Peter Gabriel but Tony, Mike, Phil and Steve put out an awesome album with great music.  a must for any real Genesis fan.
B004GTLFNW|5|I purchased the book to go along with the iPhone App.  Together they make an extremely easy program to follow with complete explanations of what to do, why you are doing it and suggestions to alter the specified programs to fit your individual level of fitness.  As Body weight training is new to me, I enjoy the pre set programs.  However, the goal of the book is to get the reader to understand body weight training and lay out enough exercises (200+) so that you can then devise your own programs.  Each workout is only 25-45 minutes.  The idea is not to just follow the set programs but to make body weight training a part of your regular routine.<br /><br />I am 49 years old, had been lifting and running for about a year and in pretty good physical shape.  Since body weight training was completely new to me I started on the Beginner Program.  Although the exercises themselves were too easy for me, learning the proper technique was important.  Most exercises incorporate multiple muscle groups with complex motions using &#34;stabilizing muscles&#34; not often used in lifting and running workouts. For the beginner exercises that were too easy I just did more reps than the program scheduled to increase the physical challenge.  I am in week 6 of the Beginner Program and now that I am more used to the techniques I am substituting in some harder variations of the exercises, or using the &#34;Step it Up a Notch&#34; suggestions in the book where necessary.  I am looking forward to advancing in the Program and becoming more adept at the more difficult techniques in the future.  Handstand pushups and planches here i come!!!!!!<br />In sum I think mark Lauren has developed a program that is easy to adapt to your individual lifestyle, is interesting to do regularly without getting bored and is challenging enough to keep you focused on future goals.
0767817478|5|I have enjoyed Godzilla movies since I was a kid. This one did not disappoint me in the least. I have watched it many times and have shared it with all my children and grandchildren as often as they will tolerate. I truly enjoy this movie. *S*
B0036S4B6M|5|I read this book after watching the Netflix series (which is very different from the book).  I almost skipped the book after reading some of the unfavorable reviews.  I'm glad I decided to ignore them.  Contrary to the bad reviews, Piper does not constantly talk about being blonde, or about graduating from Smith.  And for those who claim the book is just \\"about Piper,\\" I wonder what you think a memoir IS?  This book was funny, engaging, and intelligent.  For those who could only pick it apart, I can only say that this book was written from her perspective.  To say she should have written it the way YOU think it should have been written is simply ludicrous.  Kudos to any woman who can serve time and keep her sense of humor.  Privileged or not.
B00E8KLWB4|4|You actually get to continuously play. It is not a free game that you play for 5 minutes and then you have to buy it.
0399255370|5|My son loves this book. It has a great message about creativity and encouraging kids to think outside the box.

B000002MJC|5|Many people have different feelings upon this album, altough they consider it good, they feel that the group was falling apart, and somehow they were right, but this album is still a classic rock album, and with time it will become a cult album.<BR>Despite the fact that the change was maybe too radical, from techno-dance-softdark album (Violator) to a dark-album almost gothic like SOFAD, this one have everything to reach the status of a cult album, Great Lyrics, Great Music, Sadness, Love-Hate and Lust fellings, the question is... What else do you need in an album?<br />The highest songs are &quot;Judas&quot;, &quot;Walking in my Shoes&quot;, &quot;In Your Room&quot;, &quot;Higher Love&quot;, &quot;One Caress&quot; and &quot;I Feel You&quot;
B00942Y35S|5|This was a surprisingly good movie. I can't believe I never heard of it before. I would recommend it to everyone.  Very family friendly with a great storyline.
B000FC1LOC|1|I was unimpressed but I also have known people with severe illnesses and have been exposed to the designer baby to save another child idea.  The writing was mediocre at best and there were multiple passages where subpar research was very evident.  I was expecting more from an author that holds a graduate degree and went to Princeton and Harvard and prides herself on her in depth research for her books.
B00304RMFE|4|Pretty good, quick watch though. Wish there was more content and explained more of the lore.
B00008WT5J|5|This is a real good cd a AC/DC tunes. I also have the album and I wanted to have the cd to play in my car.
B004SJ3BCI|1|It's not the regular version, so I don't like it or use it.  Perhaps an Angry Bird afficionado will like it.
B00QW8TYWO|5|this is a fun little game and it's cool to play as different characters
B000QAUNLK|1|Unfortunately the record came in poorer condition than expected and skips a lot. I'm now trying to find one in good listening condition. It's arrived on time though.

B005544TRQ|4|Fresh faces with refreshing story lines. Great entertainment.
B000VZD8TO|5|Betty J. Eadie had a Near-Death Experience in 1973 that was [in her recounting] one of the most detailed ever recorded. She also wrote the follow-up book, [[ASIN:1451686560 The Awakening Heart: My Continuing Journey to Love]], as well as [[ASIN:B005XD5KJK The Ripple Effect Our Harvest]]. Her LSD/Mormon background---which is reflected is her comments about the preexistence, etc.---is not detailed in this book, but is known from other sources; e.g., [[ASIN:0889651191 Embraced by the Light and the Bible Betty Eadie and Near-Death Experiences  in the Light of Scripture]].<br /><br />She says of her experience, \\"I saw a pinpoint of light in the distance... It was the most unconditional love I have ever felt... There was no questioning who he was... He was Jesus Christ... I wanted to know why there were so many churches in the world. Why didn't God give us only one church, one pure religion? ... Each of us, I was told, is at a different level of spiritual development and understanding. Each person is therefore prepared for a different level of spiritual knowledge. All religions upon the earth are necessary because there are people who need what they teach... No one church can fulfill everybody's needs at every level.\\" (\\"Embraced by the Light\\" chapter)<br /><br />She says, \\"There are far fewer accidents here than we imagine, especially in things that affect us eternally. The hand of God, and the path we chose before we came here, guide many of our decisions and even many of the seemingly random experiences we have.\\" (\\"Healing---and Dying\\" chapter) She notes, \\"Of all knowledge, there is none more essential than knowing Jesus Christ... Whether we learn of Jesus Christ here or while in the spirit, we must eventually accept him and surrender to his love.\\" (\\"The Greeting Party\\" chapter)<br /><br />She observed of angels, \\"They delighted to help us and were especially joyful when somebody prayed with enough intensity and faith to be answered immediately. They always responded to the brighter, larger prayers first, then each prayer in turn, until all of them were answered. I did notice, however, that insincere prayers of repetition have little if any light; and having no power, many of them are not heard.\\" (\\"Prayer\\" chapter)<br /><br />She states, \\"Five years after my death experience I felt a desire to go back to the hospital to find out what might have happened to me physically that night... I didn't need the doctors' confirmation to know that I had died---Jesus himself told me I had---but my friends wanted more information.\\" (\\"My Recovery\\" chapter)<br /><br />She reveals in the concluding chapter, \\"More experiences have come to me since November 18, 1973, but I am reluctant to share them here; it took nineteen years and countless proddings to get me to share the experiences in this book. Everything has its time; for this book, the time is now.\\"<br /><br />For anyone interested in Near-Death experiences, this book will be of great interest.the brighter, larger prayers first, then each prayer in turn, until all of them were answered.

B000050XEI|5|I have shopped amazon for many cd's now.  I always consider reviewing what I have or have bought but never bother.  I usually look to the worst reviews to be the most honest and picky (as I am).  In this case however, the reviews are off and so I write my first CD Review on amazon.<br />Enya I love and this CD I love as well.  It carries a slightly different style to her previous recordings. (all of which I own and love (except celts))  It is made up of Enya's wonderful voice and a very summer's day feel.  The bottom line is that this CD is great.<br />Don't listen to the other reviews, If you like Enya (or similar) and you pass this CD up...well, it'll be your loss.
0316055433|5|Nancee Swartz -The Goldfinch was a Pulitzer Prize winning novel and won the National Book Critic award. It is similar to a Dickens tale with many twists and turns, It tells the story of a boy who undergoes life changes when his family faces a tragedy.  He meets many interesting characters and each cause him to change who he becomes and what is important to him in his life. I would guess they will make this into a movie or a miniseries. The characters are so well defined you feel they are friends as you move along in the story. I liked the ending although I know some readers felt it was abrupt. It is a slice of life story and if you take it as such the entire plot is more meaningful.  I give it 5 stars,  Nancee Swartz
B0071XO8RA|5|Hugh, I was surprised, dumbfounded and gained a new respect for the simple resources we use daily but never actually make with our own hands and intellect. I am only left wondering how it all started, how the end began the new beginning that became this story. Thanks for a great read.
B004GYY714|2|I've only used this thing ten minutes as I type this, and already I've realized that I can't get any of the local stations I really want to listen to. (Instead, the app refers me to what it thinks are near-equivalents.) I live in a city large enough to support two major-league sports teams, and these stations I can't get are among the largest and most popular in town. 00 Tunes on Apple plays them without skipping a beat-- why not TuneIn? I'd gladly buy the paid version (at twice the price I paid for 00 Tunes, I'll add) if I could get the stations I wanted-- and if other reviewers didn't claim there's still ads on the paid app. Until then... I guess I'll have to keep trying others. Or else hope against hope that 00 Tunes comes to Kindle.  Also-- There's no good search function to find a station by call letter.
B0068THAGY|4|The kids are the heroes in this &#34;something is out to get us&#34; movie.  Suspend disbelief and enjoy the ride!
B005MQW5RI|3|It's an ok movie, a fun way to spend 90 or so minutes.  A good twist on the usual evil versus good movies where the Villain wins and then is lost without his nemesis to pit his wits against.  It is also a good moral of how even someone who has been created pure and good can turn evil.  The 3D effects are better than some other animated movies I have watched recently like Brave.  Not much else to say about it, other than it is offers nothing new from every other similar animated movie but it does entertain for 90 minutes
B008Y6ZRBY|4|It was well acted..very good
B0017SWPXY|5|From the first chapter, this story entered my soul. Through tears and laughter, Enzo helped me to get a grip on my own life. Beautifully written.
B00BAXFJ5M|5|I enjoy intrigue, mystery novels, especially David Baldacci books, and this is one of my very favorites! I heartily recommend it to anyone who reads this genre.<br />Johnny Wilson
B005ZOBNOI|5|Leaves you wondering  whats left after all is lost in your life a romantic tale about two cancer patients who fall in love knowing the losses.
B004EF65QA|5|I am a Dickens, Austen, Bronte fan. This is very much on the same line. If you love those, you will love this! ENJOY!!!!!
B0089LOG02|5|I had never heard of an orphan train- opened my eyes to a whole new world. I really enjoyed this book. By the end of the book, i had fallen in love with these characters. I might even read it again( that rarely happens)
074356619X|5|I purchased the book and the CD's together. I couldn't put the book down!Since I read it so fast, I feel the CD's are a reinforcement,plugging in the areas where the written word didn't impact me. I listen while driving, and find new things in the content all the time. What a delight to listen to. I'm finding things are coming to me,actually without that much effort on my part. I've NEVER been SO conscious in all my life! It's commanding that we live a full life in all areas, to evolve into our higher self. Definitly gives you the how and why and the ability to get into the flow and act on our instincts. I can't stop telling people about this!
B007HACDLK|5|I liked the way Mitch Rapp is moving forward in his own development not just a static set of character parameters.
B000VOC90Y|5|Very sturdy and practical
B00JVZ0DQG|4|In traditional FarmVille fashion this game is fun and gives you lots of things to do and activities to complete. Of course all those activities can suck up all of your time. Still, if you have time to kill or things to put off, this is a great way to pass the time.
B00DMCV7K0|5|Powerful and entrancing. Enjoyed the historical accuracy of the tale of the Grimke sisters. Would recommend this to a friend.
B00J6YBOFQ|5|I loved the many aspects of the tech and startup world this book covers.<br /><br />Everybody wanting to start a tech business should read it.
B003ODIZL6|5|It helps with school work and I am in college we have all big words. Like spranoimer it really helps.
B009UX2YAC|5|good
1607066017|5|I read between 5-12 comics a week. I started reading saga in single.issue form the first week it came out and it is one of my favorite books. There is something in this book for everyone.<br /><br />I'm a fan of BKV and I like this a bit better than Y:the last man (it is very different).<br /><br />BKV'S story stelling and Fiona Staples's art really makes this book the total package.<br /><br />I would reccomend this book for a more mature audience.
B0047Y17P2|4|A twist ending that I did not see coming makes this another thought provoking good read. All our old friends are here .
B001HNE3NO|5|Excellent plot
B004EPZ034|5|I bought this movie for my niece and she is super happy with it! It came exactly as it was described.
B006TTC5JK|5|It's James Stewart. No need to say more. From westerns to the Air Force to straight man for a rabbit he is a classic by himself.
B00SI7GCJK|5|Much better than it could have been.  Great spiritual story dressed up as an action flick.  If you think there has to be more to this life; then you'll wanna see this!
B00CHVIPP2|4|Not a super blockbuster, but a very good movie.  The graphics are terrific and the story line good.  Didn't seem to be on a level with Ice Age or some others, but a pretty outstanding watch just the same.
B006R8GK2Q|2|I really, really wanted to like this app. I've played a couple of other G5 games on my Kindle Fire, and they were pretty addicting. This one...this one angered me. First off, the minigames. They didn't even offer a tutorial to help explain what you were supposed to do. For instance, the minigame where they ask you to untangle the strings on a board. I figured out the first one by pure accident. Then the screen changed before I could even see what I had done! That was my first ever experience with something like that. Ever! Because there wasn't any sort of &quot;here's the gist of what you are supposed to do&quot;, I ended up skipping those.<br /><br />The next big complaint: Finding the transparent objects. Some of them are easy to spot, but some of them weren't eve  made visible until I used a hint. I admit that I have to wear glasses, but some of them were just bs to say the least.<br /><br />My final complaint is two-in-one, and this one is the biggest problem I have. Every time it came to a puzzle where you had to tell the difference between two pictures, some kind of glitch would happen. The first time, random stuff would just flash and vanish without me touching the screen. After a couple times of that happening, I thought it had cleared up. I found the items pretty easily without glitches on the 3rd puzzle like that with no problem...until the level completed. It froze my Kindle entirely. I couldn't do anything. When I finally got my Kindle to shut off, it wouldn't turn back on. I had a full battery; it took me hooking my Kindle up to my laptop to fix it. I didn't leave it plugged in for anymore  than 3 mins, but when I disconnected it, all was fixed. That happened twice. I uninstalled it immediately after the second time. Like I said, I've never had a problem with any of G5's other games, but this one is a total bust. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because when the game worked, it was kinda fun. Too bad it's sooo glitchy :(
0802473156|5|I have not finished this book but it seems to be hitting home on a lot of levels....Brings thought to the process of others.
B006ID6NDQ|5|The story hooked you from the beginning.  The story tells about the inner courage and determination we have to survive.
B008476HBM|3|I always have a hard time getting through the &#34;classics&#34;..this on is no exception.  REad it because it is a classic but not because I enjoyed it.
B003ZD9DUC|5|Love watching this movie.  &#34;They say people don't believe in heroes anymore.  Well, damn them!  You and me, Max, we're gonna give 'em back their heroes!&#34;
B00A8MGLAI|4|I liked it. You have to be able to stand moving around in time...
B005544TRQ|5|Love it! Can't get enough!
B009JBWOU0|5|I bought these for my son for Christmas.  He was so happy.  They came on time and were perfect.  Recommend buying them!

B00QW8TYWO|4|My grandson said all his friends are playing it, so he had to have it, too.  He loves the game.
B007BVOEPI|5|This show pulls no punches! it puts you right in the middle of the action. The characters are all believable,the villains as well as the heroes.
145162445X|4|A UNIVERSE FROM NOTHING BY LAWRENCE M. KRAUSS  A Review by Tim Campbell  Something from nothing!  The title alone will give the hard core fundamentalists conniptions and will confuse most other religionists.  But the universe according to Dr. Krauss does not require a magic being in order to exist and the \\"nothing\\" of which Dr. Krauss writes is anything but nothing.  In fact, \\"nothing\\" refers to the vacuum of empty space, which, rather than being an empty nothingness is actually teeming with energies and particles and stuff, all of which contribute to our universe, and us, being what and how we are!  Dr. Lawrence M. Krauss is a well-known and highly respected theoretical physicist and cosmologist. He is Foundations Professor and Director of the Origins Project at Arizona State University.  He is author or co-author of more than three hundred scientific publications and eight books including a best seller: THE PHYSICS OF STAR TREK.  And yes, to be forthcoming here in this review, Dr. Krauss and I are both unbelievers in tribal gods, including Yahweh, the god of the Hebrew Bible and alleged father of Jesus.  As Dr. Krauss has argued before and explains most eloquently here, \\"Forget Jesus. The stars died so you could be born.  A UNIVERSE FROM NOTHING does not answer definitively the question of how the universe originated.  The book offers the best and most plausible natural explanations for the existence of something rather than nothing, and Dr. Krauss explains in fairly easy-to-understand terms how science has arrived at it conclusions and what enormous pillars of evidence support the likelihood of its conclusions.  Gravity, Gravitational lensing, Type 1a Supernovas, Clustering of Galaxies, Inflationary Theory, General Relativity, Einstein's Cosmological Constant, Hubble's Constant (which ironically changes over cosmic time due to the effects of Gravity), the age of the Universe to four digits (13.72 billion years), the certainty of the Big Bang (supported by three pillars of observed and predicted evidence:  the Hubble expansion of the Universe, the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation with a current measure temperature exactly as predicted by BB Theory, and the almost exact agreement between the predicted abundance of light elements and the observed and precisely measured abundance of these elements: hydrogen, Helium, Deuterium, and Lithium) are all covered and explained.    As a side note, Dr. Krauss points out that these \\"light\\" elements are the only elements that could have been produced in the course of the Big Bang and the subsequent expansion and cooling of the Universe.  ALL of the heavier elements--carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, iron, and so on, in other words the things that make US--could only have been produced later by the atomic effects of exploding stars. These are the Supernovas, the result of giant stars burning through their hydrogen fuel and dying in a cataclysmic explosion of radiation and newly formed heavy elements.  As he puts it somewhat poetically, our own Milky Way Galaxy has seen more than two hundred million of these supernovas since forming billions of years ago.  The matter formed by these explosions became the matter that then formed our planet and then us.  The atoms in your left hand most certainly came from a different star than the atoms in your right hand.  We are all stardust!  These ideas and topics and much more are discussed and explained throughout the book.  Dr. Krauss does an excellent job of making these powerful  and complex concepts accessible to the layman.  While a background in science would certainly be helpful, the average person can still read this book and be both entertained as well as educated.  Dr. Krauss is one of a number of renowned scientists who have taken time away from their own work in order to bring their work to the rest of us.  Along with Neil deGrasse Tyson, Evalyn Gates, Richard Dawkins, Jerry Coyne, and others, Dr. Krauss is following in the tradition of Carl Sagan and Isaac Asimov as an \\"explainer of science\\".    The book is written in a clear and concise manner and not laden down with difficult-to-understand math or jargon that would be understandable only to another physicist.    The future of the Universe is also examined.  Not the silly theological predictions for May, 2012, or any of the infamous Harold Camping oopses, but rather the eventual fate of a Universe in which normal matter and energy (Us) comprise only about 4% of the actual stuff of the Universe with a whopping 70% being comprised of an unknown, but pretty darn certain stuff that physicists amusingly call Dark Energy.  And it is this DE that makes it possible for us to get \\"something\\" from \\"nothing\\".  This is the energy of empty space, the force that fills the vacuum and pushed the universe (space itself) to expand and to expand at an even faster rate, so that one day, in about two trillion years, whoever may be around at that time, will not know what the universe actually is!  As Dr. Krauss puts it, \\"We live at a very special time...the only time when we can observationally verify that we live at a very special time\\".  Another poignant side note:  the late Christopher Hitchens was supposed to write a forward for this book, but his health had deteriorated to the point where he was unable to complete the commitment.  Biologist and also best-selling author Richard Dawkins stepped in and wrote an afterword.    Writes Dawkins (referring to the theologians' arguments of design): \\"And now we can read Lawrence Krauss for what looks to me like the knockout blow. Even the last remaining trump card of the theologian, `why is there something rather than nothing?' shrivels up before your eyes as you read these pages. If ON THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES was biology's deadliest blow to supernaturalism, we may come to see A UNIVERSE FROM NOTHING as the equivalent from cosmology. The title means exactly what it says. And what it says is devastating.\\"  Eloquent, entertaining, funny, and ironic, A UNIVERSE FROM NOTHING represents the triumph of reason and evidence-based science over irrational and revelatory-based superstition.
B009EJSUBY|5|I have a problem knowing which CD to play.  There are so many of them that I found playing them was difficult not knowing which ones I would enjoy most.  I can't tell which ones were most well known, etc.
B004GJDQT8|5|I LOVE amazon!! I use it for 80% of my shopping. I recommend it to all my friends that haven't used it. I honestly can't say enough good things about it.  : )
B00002SSKI|5|Great coming of age movie, very funny with an A list cast. Christina Ricci's young in this movie but she's so talented even when she was in the Addam's Family. Great movie!

B006VRDZ44|5|Excellent story of the politics in the 20's.
B007WULJ5G|5|i picked up this uncut gem after watching a bootleg version(it was uncut as well) and deciding that, to me, it is the most brutal underground gore film since slaughtered vomit dolls.<br /><br />i usually am a harsh critic on horror films and i must say, i dont have one single bad thing to say about this movie. it had a great, original plot, it was not a remake, it had a soundtrack that went well with the feel of the film, over the top gore and just brutal in general scenes, multiple twists near the ending, and touched on topics that are deemed taboo by even the most jaded gore hounds.<br /><br />i dont want to give away too much, for the first time watching this without really knowing whats around the corner is priceless. but one of the main topics that caused all the controversy had already been done in the last in the vomit gore trilogy called, slow torture puke chamber(which i had already watched). so, i went into watching this movie, not focused on the very few scenes that closed minded viewers couldnt handle, but i was able to absorb this film for what it is. which to me is just a great exploitation movie. i felt that all the scenes that caused up roars all over were completely justified by the film's brutal story. i dont think the director did these scenes on purpose or to shock rock us, or to get his film talked about. i think this director just had a wonderfully, over the top story and wasnt about to compromise his vision just for people that feel that its immoral. if you have issues with the subjects dealt with in a serbian film(which most of you will), just dont watch it. stick to friday the 13th's and such.<br /><br />for the gore hounds, and fans that enjoy degrading,filthy,perverted, sleaze cinema, watch this at all costs(avoid the cut version). the idea to cut this film on just a few scenes is ridiculous. any one that can handle the cut version, can handle the extra few mins. for those that have watched this, i have 3 words for you,<br /><br />bravo! bravo! bravo!ravo! bravo!
B0011UJMK2|4|I was introduced to this book by my hubby who saw the movie and raved about it,for some reason in thought this may just be a book. How happy was i to see not only is  it a book, its 3 flipping books!!<br />This is a story about USSR during Stalin and later  Khrushev's stringent rule. This story moves fast and furious, never gets off track and of course, the big reveal and ends with a cliff hanger. Now i will  download Book 2 from Overdrive/ my local library
B00756GRUE|5|I have had this watch for 8 months and love it.  It keeps great time, works beautifully, and looks awesome.  I am always getting compliments about it.  This watch is very durable I wear it everyday and it gets a lot of abuse but it still looks like the day I bought it.
B00NF4POZO|5|Good Music
B009ZQJ0ME|3|This was a pretty good story.  I hope this isn't what our future is going to be like.
B000FJGWBC|4|Good movie. Action/adventure. Moves right along. Fast paced. Great underwater scenes and beautiful girls in bikinis. What more can anyone ask for.
0446608955|5|This was one of the most amazing books i have ever read. I don't think i ever gotten that emotionnaly involved in a story before. At the beggining of the story, Nicholas Sparks described the town in which the story takes place, I could picture it perfectely in my mind. This story was wonderfully written and was told through the eyes of the main character Landon Carter. <br /> <br />       I remember at so many points in this book, how i laughed and i was smiling at the beggining, when Landon was calling girl after girl desperatly searching for a date. And then how that quickly turned into tears. It was a beautiful story about young love and true love. I'll never forget this story, ever.
B00AFCEIB0|5|I cant use any other website. i love google and this app is awesome. its fast and very effecient. :)
B00B47MTZC|5|Absolutely loved the show I was forced to watch it refused but after a 6 day trial in court my decision was overruled and I am a better person because of it thanks Kevin Bacon
B00003CX9E|5|Not much I can add to previous reviews of this masterwork.  It could have been made last year, as crackling as the dialogue is, as inventive the camera work. <br /> <br />If you could create one work of art this powerful and compelling in your lifetime, consider yourself complete.  I also highly recommend the other DVD \\"The Battle Over Citizen Kane\\" for an overview of the Welles/Hearst situation. <br /> <br />A must own set for any serious collector, and even the casual movie fan.
B00AQ3K8IU|5|I read the reviews on this book, and they all seemed generally pleased with it. I don't recall reading that it is an entirely consuming page turner. Which means I fell into the story myself (which I love to do) and just couldn't put the book down. Another reader was so spot on with their review...just when you think you have it all figured out the author throws you another curve ball....it's just elaborate enough with twists, love and turns that you will dote on every page. There is a bit of darkness to this story, but a good romance and page turner wouldn't be as enticing without it.
B00E9PMML2|5|I bought these films for my girlfriends boys because they had never seen them. They were totally blown away by them. Very good present if I do say so myself.

B008Y2FRFO|5|Fun way to pass the time. Just like the game at the carnival. But with more challenges. Recommended for anyone.
B005LVR6ZA|5|awesome book, must read! goes to the heart!
B00A9V2JSG|4|The author &#34;takes you there&#34; with her writing - something I crave, (but too seldom find) in many books these days. I have to admit that at times I found my self wanting to skim to get to the meat of the situation, but a small price to pay to read a really good story that is well articulated.
B00E8KLWB4|4|Very fun. I enjoy all the puzzles and the challenges keep it entertaining. Only downside is the amount of time it takes to build up your energy. I haven't bought any crystals or energy, but it sure is tempting when you want to play longer than 15 minutes at a time.  Overall, I'm glad I got it and kind of wish I didn't spend so much time playing :)
B00B7FOQCK|1|It doesn't work with Windows 8.1 . It is recognized then it is unrecognized by Windows. I finally removed it.
0345544927|5|Amazing book! I'm not a Jodi Picoult follower - too formulaic for me - but this one was a big exception! I heard about this book because of the elephants, and I'm an elephant enthusiast. All of the information about the elephants and tying it into the really well laid-out story was simply amazing. The story had so many twists and turns and the ending is really shocking, although perfect. The best part of the book, though, was the medium character, Serenity. All of the research on the science of psychic work was intriguing and resonated with me, since I have experience loss and found solace in a medium reading, myself. All in all, great research and great story within the research. Very worth your time as a reader!
B004DK5CYM|5|With a blu-ray/DVD combo you can have it both ways.  I have the blu ray for home and the DVD for my vacation cottage.  This movie brought back fond memories of the greatest race horse I ever saw.  As far as the movie, it was well done but I must say I liked Seabiscuit better.  Both movies are worth seeing.

LOVE IN AN ELEVATOR became a Top 20 hit as did JANIE'S GOT A GUN,THE OTHER SIDE and WHAT IT TAKES. FINE is an acronym for the following adjectives:F---ED UP,INSECURE,NEUROTIC,EMOTIONAL. Steven Tyler spells the acronym in WHAT IT TAKES. This was one of the best-selling albums in 1990 although it was released in fall 1989. For some reason,the band decided to leave DEUCES ARE WILD off the PUMP album which they would release on the various artists album,THE BEAVIS AND BUTTHEAD EXPERIENCE in 1993. You can see videos for some of the PUMP tracks on the video,&quot;Things That Go PUMP In the Night&quot;.
B001V5CIFI|5|Woulderful movie for the family!!!<br /><br />My daughter, 14 asked to watch the movie again.  We thoroughly enjoyed seeing it again.  A nice way to instill some boundary!<br /><br />Light & Love,
0026009102|5|&quot;The Fountainhead&quot; is the story of Howard Roark, an ideal man of perfect virtue in world full of men that want nothing extreme and follow those who do know what they want, so long as the leaders help them mask  their emptiness.  Roark is an architect who only works his way, asking no  one to like or accept his work, demanding nothing from others.  His  buildings are highly efficient and a tribute to the best within man, and he  deals only with those who approach him ready to accept his terms.   Ultimately &quot;Fountainhead&quot; is not the story of his struggle  against his antagonists, but the story of their struggle to stifle the good  in men so that Roark can never work, which would destroy him.  <br />This is  about the broadest synopsis of the book's conflict that I can make.  I read  the book at a time (at 18) when I was fighting off the growing realization  that my religion and my country were intellectually and morally bankrupt.   This is terrifying when you aren't aware of *why* they are and what  alternate thinking this implies.  I was looking carefully for some new  ideas.  I found &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; and some very challenging  questions of mine got answered.  If you haven't read the book I hope you  will.
B00FEN000S|5|I guess I am biased... because I am an absolute Sci Fi fanatic, especially with giant robots fighting giant aliens/monsters.<br /><br />If each element of the movie is isolated and reviewed separately, I'd say they are only \\"good\\" except for the visuals which I thought were outstanding. The costumes, sets, and CGI are amazing especially when you see the scale of the Jaegers and Kaiju with respect to skyscrapers and typical city environments. The story is your typical Japanese mecha anime, but the actors helped make the story more interesting.<br /><br />Overall 5/5 stars. I cannot wait for a sequel!
B00BJ9VBLI|5|Very addicting. I got all the way through the 100 levels. It was maddening, frustrating, infuriating, and exhilarating. Can't wait to do it all again!

B00E8KLWB4|3|Entertaining, but sometimes frustrating. Would like more objects to find and a larger screen. Nice way to pass the time when you have a few minutes.
B007MDB71O|5|I have read every book that Edgar Rice Burroughs wrote.  That is almost 70 stories.  I always wanted to see a version of Tarzan like Burroughs wrote him.  It has never happened.  When I heard that John Carter was coming out, I was thrilled.  It is a story that should be put on the big screen.  I am glad that it finally did.  I had a great time watching it and experiencing it in the theater.  Is it exactly like the books?  No, but the basic story is there and the cast of characters is there.  It really upset me when Disney dissed their own movie and that it didn't turn out to be a blockbuster.  I do hope that they do another one.  I will definitely buy the Blu-Ray!
030758836X|5|This book is awesome.  Gillian Flynn is an incredible author.  Couldn't book the book down.  Lots of twists and turns I wasn't expecting.  Bought her other books, just because I liked this one so much!
B0069G5Z9K|5|Love this game and its finally on android! Get this game now! Tons of replayability. Fun graphics and missions. Definitely save your coins to buy flash the dog
B00AB7HESI|4|I recommend this game for everyone.  Creative thinking is the goal here, so I believe that this game would be especially beneficial to children.  The only issues that I found with this game are frequent crashes that occur at random times (Kindle Fire HDX).  The controls are a little finicky as well.  I found that trying to drag created items around can sometimes be frustrating due to unresponsiveness.  Luckily there is an option to just shake the tablet in order to remove created items.  Great game otherwise!!!
031623480X|5|For anyone concerned about your health I HIGHLY recommend you read this book-It gives the science of LCHF in a way that is easy to understand.

0525478817|2|Initially, I approached The Fault in Our Stars with excitement having heard so much about it, but that quickly fell apart and I assure you that it's not because too-high expectations. It was just bad. The novel is essentially a love story between two cancer kids. Green does his best to keep his style unadorned and create a specific voice for Hazel, the protagonist. We get the picture: she needs an oxygen tank to breathe and she's best friends with her Mom. And while her life is not what anyone hopes for, Green uses humor to keep the novel from being of the overly sentimental variety. Okay. But from there, things fall off. How you ask?<br />1. Augustus Waters is completely contrived from the dialogue to his need for metaphors. He is essentially a cardboard cut-out of a dreamy teenage boy.<br />2. Green uses a novel both Hazel and Augustus read as a crutch to support their love story.<br />3. The third act's step away from realism or simple plausibility shows way too much conscious effort.<br />4. Hazel's voice is inconsistent and tiring after 300 pages.<br />I don't recommend this. I'm sure there are better cancer stories out there. With this one, You'll rip through it and wonder why you even bothered in the first place.
B000FZETIO|5|Great movie, Great price, came fast, & was brand new, no problems! Anyone who hasn't seen it.. should watch it! Such a classic!
B00J8CG6KE|1|Sorry that I wasted my time with this film.  Very tedious and disheartening to watch. Confirmed my suspicions of the mindset and morals of Wall Street.  Am rather disappointed that I helped to put more money back into his pocket by renting this thing.

0790733226|5|He became so famous as an astronomer that it's easy to forget he was one heck of a fine wordsmith as well. Yes he was. You've watched six shows, at most, on PBS. Sesame Street, Are You Being Served, Monty Python's Flying Circus, The Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy, Red Dwarf, and Cosmos with Carl Sagan. If you're brighter than me, throw in The McNeil-Lehrer Report or its sequel. But that's it.<br /><br />Why COSMOS? Well, if I type \\"billions and billions\\" in quotes, you hear his voice in your head. Yes you do. The man made astronomy interesting because he was a wordsmith.<br /><br />CONTACT is a novel by Carl Sagan. Copyright 1985, which works for me. I read it when it was new. Back in my security guard days, down in Tampa Florida. (Yo Bob!) I later saw the film, very well done, with Jodie Foster, but I can't remember it. One of the advantages of getting old.<br /><br />How does the book stand the test of time? So well that I'm gonna recommend you get it right now. Of course the science is spot on, since this is Carl Sagan. If we ever do hear from somebody not of this earth, this is how it'll happen. But that's a given. What's easy to forget is that Sagan gave us some very well-drawn characters from his world in an eminently readable style. And, as always, accessible science that makes you marvel at the possibilities. Keep in mind that I've probably never used the word \\"marvel\\" in a book or movie review before. I'm too old and jaded to marvel. But heck, I marveled.<br /><br />As if that weren't enough, he had so much fun predicting the future. This far down the road, we can see where he misfired, which was almost never. We can enjoy how accurate he often was. This is where he let his subtle humor roam free, and we can love him for his wit. These are the traits I didn't catch 20 years ago, because I was looking for aliens. Which he also delivers, somewhat, but I don't even care at this point. I just know I love this book.<br /><br />And yes, the DVD as well, which is good since that's what I'm supposed to be reviewing here.  The DVD is true to the book, so of course it's excellent.

B007MCTTHY|5|The game in fun. You rearrange the pipes to make the liquids go where they need to go. Some of the puzzles are easy, others more challenging. After completing everything, I passed it on to my 4,6, & 8 yr old. They loved it too. They enjoyed the concept of getting the liquid through the pipes, and even making it \\"fail\\" on purpose. I got the app when it was the free app of the day, but still, at the 99 cent price I would say its worth it. Its a nice time killer. I just hope they come out with more \\"books\\" one day.

0618551050|1|The first thing that the potential reader should know about this book is that it is not about physics at all. It is about ideology. It uses modern physics as the backdrop for presenting an ideological position and a world-view.    The intellectual level of the scientific arguments can be fairly gauged by the following quotation from p105. of the hardcover edition.    \\"The world does not appear to have 25 dimensions of space. Why it is that the [string] theory was not just abandoned there and then is one of the great mysteries of science.\\"    If the sheer stupidity of this statement is not immediately apparent to the reader, he or she should substitute any of a multitude of counter-intuitive ideas from the history of science to see how it pans out. Of course everyone knows - Professor Smolin above all - that we don't abandon accepted scientific theories because they conflict with everyday \\"commonsense\\" perceptions. If we did there would be little left of science and Professor Smolin would probably be fretting about the dynamics of billiard balls and the like instead of quantum physics and relativity. Which makes the above  statement little more than a cheap shot at string theory, and of course a visceral dislike of string theory and its practitioners is the major motivator for this book.    The early chapters of the book give a reasonable description of the more recent developments in advanced physics and would be interesting were it not for the constant interruption of autobiographical snippets, anecdotes, ad-hominem digs at fellow scientists and   attempts at a strange, often clumsy, humor.    The last few chapters deal openly with what I consider to be the main point of the book and which I want to address. What this part boils down to is a weird melange of half-baked philosophy and sociology, amateur psychology and a huge spray at the \\"establishment\\".    Professor Smolin's estimation of the value of Feyerabend's deconstruction of the scientific method is hilarious. I can assure the reader that very little of Feyerabend's harebrained epistemological anarchism has stood the test of time and even in the atmosphere of wild intellectual anarchy, in which we now find ourselves, his ideas have been quietly put to sleep one by one. You could probably count on the fingers of one hand the number of working scientists who still take his ideas seriously. It's disappointing but probably very revealing that Professor Smolin values this childish dribble so highly.    It comes as a huge, unwelcome surprise to me that a scientist as accomplished as Professor Smolin, who also has academic qualifications in philosophy, should have such naïve and confused ideas about his own field of expertise. But perhaps it's par for the course. My philosophy lecturer, who made a mid-life career change after being a successful researcher, told me that most working scientists care little for philosophy and that in general I should be wary of those who do. More often than not they have half-baked ideas based on some need to validate their own positions.    If after reading Professor Smolin's book you are amazed at the clannishness and closed minded group-think of academia then you must have led a very, very sheltered life indeed. The problems of the modern University are myriad and if anything physics and mathematics have escaped relatively unscathed from the unrelenting attacks on scholarship, one might say attacks on rationality, which have engulfed much of the Western intellectual tradition. What is puzzling however is the way this in-group behavior is presented by this book as though it is an entirely novel and unprecedented phenomenon rather than the longstanding norm. It is a historical fact that Einstein almost lost out on his first academic appointment because he dared to question the accepted wave theory of light. Only Planck's recommendation, in which he played down the young man's \\"foolishness\\", secured the position. Of course Einstein went on to be rewarded with the Nobel price for his foolishness. Nothing much in academia has changed since then.    The in-group, out-group dynamics of organizations is not only well understood and documented, it is almost certainly inevitable given the human psyche. These shenanigans are experienced by anyone who has ever belonged to any group, say the boy scouts, or any organization with rules of acceptance and shared beliefs. And the topic has been done to death by every psychology department and MBA course in the world.  It is our very good luck that many great minds choose to be outsiders and to pursue their ideas without reference to accepted dogma thereby avoiding the dangers of the group-think which exercises the good professor so much. I hope that Lee Smolin turns out to be one of these great thinkers and that his ideas prove decisive in cracking the five great problems he poses at the start of the book.    Each time I have picked up this book, as I have done over the last year or so while I pecked away at this review, I had very much wanted to like it. It is after all about a subject I find fascinating, by an author whose many original contributions are widely quoted in the technical and popular literature, and it is well written. But each time I have been disappointed. If you want to find out about physics, you don't need this book - there are others much better. And if you want trite sociology, homilies about the evils of modern science or just psychobabble - they can be found elsewhere too.

0618680004|5|A brilliant expose of those who play the \\"My God's better than your God\\" game.  To me, God is an imaginary friend for grown ups and no other author equals Dawkins profound articulation of this view.  A must read for believers and non-believers alike.

B00006M183|5|in my mind this is their third best album behind \\"ten\\" and \\"vs\\" it's a wonderful hard rock not grunge because that died when kurt cobain died and when soundgarden split up this is pearl jam with a more mature sound and vedders lyrics sybjects are darkier and more compelling than anything he's done before,  <br /> <br />Riot act this is the first time i put this album on in two years and i thought well i'll give it a go see if as good as i remember or bad being whatever your opipion and i was shocked and how much they changed since ten and Vs i was ready to write them off, but i really enjoyed this album with the opening track  <br />\\"can't keep\\" to \\"arc\\" a mature pearl jam showing us they have an alblity to make damn good ROCK RECORDS  <br />

B00FHB2XB6|5|Much like many, many kids mine are in love in Frozen, and anything from Frozen. We look for anything we can get out hands on, as Frozen merchandize is scarce, and hard to come by, due to high demand and the latest craze.  I was able to get this from Amazon at retail price, which was a bonus.<br /><br />I also got Ana's caste to pair this up with. They are not the most superb quality (but perfectly reasonable), but my kids absolutely love them.  And I'd rather pay this price for this quality, than three times for something extraordinary.  After all, how long will they play with these, certainly not more than a year or two (if I'm lucky).  And it's certainly not a collectable.  In the meantime, my girls have had them for a month, and nothing has broken yet, even though the younger one is not the most gentle creature, and tends to be a little rough on her toys.<br /><br />Overall, highly recommend it for any Frozen fan kid.
B00005QGAZ|4|My all time favorite.  I really appreciated all the original cuts, without the extras.  I feel the extra tracks on this is valid for the history of how it was put together.  However, I was only interest in the original cuts.  For the same reason I did not like Thriller 25.  I will add the sounds on this CD has been enhanced and it sound just great, good job.  Michael is missed, but his music will last forever in the industry.  An exceptional talent.

B00003CXN4|5|As a huge fan of New Jersey Drive and Clerks, I was hoping Traffic would be the perfect middle ground. A film with these power house stars all traveling along on a highway giving witty commentary would have been right up my alley. But alas I was foiled into a great experience none the less. Who could have guessed this film was about the drug trade?? It gives an incredible insight into all facets of the drug trade, letting us see it from everyone's point of view. Asking tough questions of whether the drug war is one that should even be fought, or if the lives it saves are small in comparison to the lives taken to fight it. Then it swings around and shows the true devastation drugs can cause, making for a great theatrical ride. Also, I can't wait to get to Mexico. Cuban cigars and that totally funky lighting down there totally rocks. And Michael Douglas was forced to be with a woman his age, while his real life wife is hit on by Dennis Quaid. The one thing this film was missing was a totally hot chick. No offense to Mr. Zeta-Jones Douglas, but she was pregnant and average looking at best. I mean a top notch super hottie, Shannon Elizabeth for example. Not really to add to the movie, she could just walk around nude mostly, just for our pleasure. I have expressed this idea to George Lucas for the upcoming Star Wars film, and he said &quot;Genius.&quot; but he is not sure he can get it done. Finally, I just gotta give mad props to the That 70's Show star, Topher Grace. He plays the quintessential teen upper-class drug head, but he lets slip some of the movies most idiomatic lines. He has a way of commanding a serious sense of presence even when he is in all reality a punk rich kid. While not what I was hoping for, this film still succeeded on many levels. Watch it.

B00OGTDZP8|5|An interesting and honest look at the differences in an multi-cultural relationship. Mrs. Mineta does an outstanding job of explaining both the struggles and the wonders that can be found in such a relationship. Her lighthearted cartoons showcase her experiences and through said drawings she also helps explain some of the terminology you would/could encounter on a trip to Japan. Some of my favorite comics in this book ( don't worry I won't post any spoilers ) revolve around her and her husband's respective families.<br /><br />As avid reader I have never preferred reading on any electronic device which is why I will also be purchasing this book in paperback. For those who prefer to read this way as well I can honestly say that it's worth the money.
B00LP1MVSW|5|My grandsons loved this game.
B00KFG156C|2|I had a headache by the end of this book. It was so tiresome.
1451636016|4|This is a great book. Maybe revolutionary.  Not exactly by the &#34;waking up&#34; pointers by themselves. Even if there are some great insights there (like the &#34;man with no head&#34; one), the chapters about how to awake are not very profound for the experienced spiritual practitioner.  But as a former atheist for 15 years, I can see how this book will be amazing to open the door to spiritual practice amongst atheists that use to discard the whole theme as &#34;mystical mumble jumble&#34;.  If you already read other spiritual books you may find that the content of this one is mostly scientific arguments to convince skeptical people that waking up is actually a thing and not a magical illusion. The book is more focused to satisfy the mind with knowledge than to feed it directly with spiritual pointers, but that is exactly what is needed for the intended audience.  If this is your first spiritual book, I suggest that you proceed with other teachers, like J. Krishnamurti or Eckhart Tolle. These teachers are also &#34;non religious&#34; teachers and you can ignore pseudo-science explanations of the cosmos and use only the practical advices, that are more deep than the ones found in Sam Harris book.

B000002U82|5|From the cash registers to the chiming clocks to the intermittent lines of dialog, this album is one of the greatest ever. Five stars is a rating so often thrown around on this site to any old cd, but this album clearly deserves it.<BR>  Its meant to be listened to all the way through, each track flowing seamlessly into the next, Time and Money are the two classics on this but the other songs are excellent also.  Brain Damage/Eclipse is one of the best closing tracks I've ever heard. Roger Waters lyrics are incredible and Gilmour's guitar is its usual self with well crafted solos. The drumming is first rate, especially on &quot;Money&quot;.<BR>   This is a cd that gets better with every listen, the first time you hear it you may ask, &quot;This is it?&quot; but give it a few tries and you'll see, you'll see....

B001FB5634|5|I think it may have been unfair to even think about reviewing this film.  Cormac McCarthy's novel is, in all honesty, the greatest novel I have ever read, and I read a lot.  I know that it has many detractors, but the simplicity that illuminates the savagery he creates is just beyond flawless in its execution.  No single novel has stirred me in so many different ways.  So, when it was announced that this film adaptation was in development my initial reaction was that of immense joy.  I could not wait.  And then the film was delayed and that always worries me.  Then the critical response was lukewarm and not what I was expecting.  I understand the oppressive bleakness with which the story unfolds can be a deterrent for some, but I really was expecting a very warm critical response (especially considering that director Hollcoat's previous effort was `The Proposition', which is the single greatest western of the decade).  The reviews came in and I sidelined my anticipation and moved on to other, more critically accepted fare.  In the back of my mind I was still aching to see this film, but the constant thought that I was setting myself up for disappointment haunted me.<br /><br />Finally, I caved in.<br /><br />I'll say first off that this film is not as strong as the novel (by any means really) but it is far from a weak effort.  There are many elements that work masterfully here (not the least of which is Viggo Mortensen, who just commands with such authenticity) but there are also a few that don't.<br /><br />The story is a simple one.  A father and son (in the novel referred to as The Man and The Boy) are trekking across the barren wasteland that is earth, in search of the coastline.  Their main objective is to survive.  The men and women still alive are either good (like our man and boy) or have turned to cannibalism and thievery as a way to survive.<br /><br />Simple as that.<br /><br />For me, it is the ambiguity and open-endedness of the story that makes it so compelling.  I have heard some complain about not knowing all the details (How did the apocalypse happen?  Why did The Woman kill herself?  What awaits them on the other side of survival?), but for me, these questions do not need to be answered.  In fact, my biggest complaint with the film is the attempts to answer some of them.  For me, the flashback scenes that `build' the relationship between The Man and his wife are unnecessary and take one out of the film.  If the film had been stripped of all flashback sequences except the one where she leaves (because that is a central emotional point in the novel as well as the film) then the narrative flow would have been better (in my humble opinion).  The Woman is not important here.  The knowledge of her existence and her suicide are very important, but the foundation that supports her memory is not.<br /><br />As some have mentioned, the stories progression on the written page depended on the imagery created by McCarthy's words.  A sliver of that is lost on the big screen.  Some stories are just not well suited for a film format.  That said, I don't think it's a big enough slice to really dampen the films impact.  The imagery that is created by Hillcoat and company is not as sharp as Cormac's pen, but they are spellbinding in their own right (depictions of the aftermath is at times shocking to behold, and completely surreal).<br /><br />But there are some big selling points found within this film, which include some tremendous performances and Hillcoat's spectacular direction.<br /><br />Mortensen is utterly brilliant here.  The character of The Man is a tricky one because, for me, it is one of those characters that is so rich for development but could easily (in the wrong hands) become one-note.  Mortensen breathes so much humanity into this man.  The way he tackles his instincts (to survive and protect) with his own selfishness (the way he handles finding his old home was flawless) as well as his nostalgia (giving us the tormented looks at his happy love life as well as his affectionate response to something less emotionally demanding, like a whiskey) is all simply perfection.

B00CS74W0C|4|the writer captured a wonderful character in Eva.  She was realistic in her with holding of information from her dad and the concept of coming from a split family was dealt with well.  The intensity of the novel's was great and watching the on and off again relationship was good.  Steamy scenes and fun parties added to the plot.  Really enjoyed the murder issues too.
B004RLPTT0|4|Absolutely brilliant soundtrack with the exception of two tracks.<br /><br />The first being the \\"I Want It All / We Will Rock You Mash-Up\\". Whoever thought this fit in amongst the rest of the music contained in the movie must have been high that day. C'mon... can't just ONE movie nowadays be made without having at least ONE rap track in it? It's so out of place that it feels like it was just thrown in as a favor to someone in the crew.<br /><br />Secondly, the \\"Love Is The Drug\\" cover does no justice whatsoever to the brilliant original by Roxy Music. This one I can live with much, much easier but it's by no means even 1/4 as good as the other 7 greats that are on the disc. The song in itself is a classic, i just think it should have been done more akin to how Sweet Dreams, Where Is My Mind and Asleep were done. If it would have been only 1 out of 9 bummers... I would have given it 5 stars.<br /><br />Regardless of the number of stars - it still get's two thumbs up from me.

B009EANE3M|5|The Script continues to put out great music, and I love the way their style has been evolving. There isn't a song on here that I don't love, as is the case on their previous albums. They've yet to disappoint, and this album is worth every penny.
B000E1ZBGS|5|I never write reviews, but after seeing this movie, felt compelled too.  This movie is absolutely lovely.  Keira and Matthew are brilliant, along with an excellent supporting cast, breath-taking country-side make this film definitely worth seeing. I too am a fan of Mr. Firth, but Mr. MacFadyen brings more emotional depth to the role.  There is one scene that makes me melt everytime and that scene is when Mr. Darcy first declares his love for Elizabeth in the pouring down rain.  Those piercing blue eyes, the emotion of the declaration that he's made, makes you feel the emotion.  Makes you believe in fairy tales.  See this movie, you won't regret it.
B00LDNE3FG|5|The game is very finished and is super addicting, but on my kindle, every now and then it glitches, and the game keeps going but you stop moving. You can still throw balls, but you won't move any further. Other than that, super fun game, and the glitch shouldn't stop you from getting and.playing it!

817224164X|5|Achtung, Baby!<br /><br />Mein Kampf has a nasty reputation. When it comes right down to it, Mein Kampf is a bad dog, a bad, bad dawg. If Mein Kampf were human, it would be the balding forty-year old guy with the canting glass eye who loiters down by the stairwell selling tap-dancing aphids out of a hat.<br /><br />But if you step back, take a deep breath, get the mental picture of grim soot blackened kilns and miles of concertina fence and razor wire and baying German shepherds and slaughterhouses & black-smoke belching smokestacks festering and brooding beneath a slate-grey sky---<br /><br />Where were we? Oh yes: if you get past that stuff, you'll be able to see Mein Kampf for what it really is: the world's most influential Self-Help manual.<br /><br />Who needs Dale Carnegie & all that \\"Smile 'til your Gums Bleed!\\" crap when you've got Adolf Hitler: Carnegie wants you to wag your tail & get another friend, Hitler wants you to wag your fist in your enemy's face & slice off another rump puppet state.<br /><br />Let's take a little mental inventory of Adolf Hitler, circa 1923: starving, failed artist, no money to pay the rent, wandered around ranting and drinking all day in beerhalls, and worst of all, stuck in the Munich pokey after he and the boys got knocked around by the local hoo-haw after a wild night gomezing around on the town and a few too many Heffeweisen.<br /><br />And yet this guy, not even a decade later, is not only shooting hoops and slam dunks but kicking everybody's [EXPLETIVE!] around the court. Around about 1941, Hitler doesn't have any time left to kick [EXPLETIVE!] & take names. Why? Because he's too busy kicking [NAUGHTY!] to take names.<br /><br />With that in mind, let's break this little masterwork of Teutonic Take-no-Prisoners Motivation down by the numbers & see what Mein Kampf can do for you---today!<br /><br />1) Give in to your Anger! Your Hate will make you Strong! Whether it's building a battle station that can destroy a planet in a single blast or emptying the Eastern Marches of Bolshevik Scum, get in touch with your Inner Monster & give that bad  boy a ticket to ride!<br /><br />2) It's all about Marketing! Coco Chanel knew it! Tommy Hilfiger knew it! Idi Amin knew it!---Marketing Matters! Hitler proved it. Schwag matters. Gift boxes matter! Little corporate doohickeys with your logo & slogan on it---all of that matters.<br /><br />WWHD?---'What would Hitler Do?' He'd make it colorful! Primary colors, baby, lots of red and black and white! He'd add chrome! He'd come up with a catchy slogan. He'd probably have a military march with torches somewhere in there! He'd invade Poland!<br /><br />3) Mission Statement: KISS goes here (\\"Keep it SS\\"): make it brutally simple. Example: a) Revenge the betrayed fatherland by shooting the Bolshevik rotters; b) hold lots of torchlit parades; c) invade Russia.<br /><br />Show me, don't tell me. It's results that count, daddy-o. See #3.<br /><br />3) Business is War! Get in the other guy's face & scream! Make him wipe your spittle off his mouth! Yes! Go over the line! Pound on the table all you want to, but if you don't get what you want, it's time to cross the enemy's line of Death! No more Mr. Nice Guy!<br /><br />Your Enemies are a bunch of Fairies! They shave their legs & go cycling after work. Think I'm wrong? Think Carstairs in Accounting has the mojo to take you on, Dear Leader? Try nailing his cat to his desk. Your patience is at an end! Exactly! Would you like a little Belgium or France with your order, Sir?<br /><br />4)Shoot your rivals. What about Carruthers, the guy from Marketing? Seriously, Old Hoss, keep an eye on that guy. He's quiet, he's shifty eyed, he does what you tell him, and when you screamed at him in that P&L meeting last week he---I jest thee not---he wet himself. That said, remember: it's the quiet ones who get ya, one way or another. Hitler, for instance. Hitler was a frustrated Marketing guy, too.<br /><br />It's kinda funny tothink about, but had someone back on the old arts school admissions council at the Vienna School for Drawing Little Teutonic stick figures decided to let Hitler in, we'd have gotten about 15 years of bad cubist stuff instead of the Blitz & the Holocaust.<br /><br />5) Strike first! Strike hard! Kill! Kill! Pick yourself up out of the gutter and get back on that Tiger tank! You think it's enough to humiliate Dimwiddy in the board room, you lunk? Fool! You've got to destroy Dimwiddy! You've got to crush him, annex his office space, invade and destroy all those little projects that mean so much to him, get him fired, laugh as he has to haul all his personal shxt out in a cardboard box---and even then it's not over! You've got to gloat, gloat and cackle, when you spot him on the street corner, down in the gutter, eating his daily ration of cat food out of a tin! Shove his face in that horsemeat! Push!<br /><br />6) Never Underestimate the Stupidity of the Masses: This is a biggie. Think about it: you're German, it's 1930, and one of the candidates for Reichs Chancellor has a shifty looking brush moustache. When asked about his resume, he replies nonchalantly about being big on killing vermin.<br /><br />Would you vote for that guy? Guess what? They did! Hitler won in a landslide! If he can, you can too!<br /><br />With that in mind, ACHTUNG! Baby! We got a little Liebensrauming to do.<br /><br />JSGeutonic stick figures decided to let Hitler in, we'd have gotten about 15 years of bad cubist stuff instead of the Blitz & the Holocaust.     5) Strike first!

B003KK6GOQ|5|I loved this book and wanted it to go on and on and never stop. It related an episode in history which I had no knowledge of and was set in place of which I knew nothing about. The 'letter' style was unusual at first but became less so as the book progressed and the letters became longer. It made me want to go to Guernsey and give all these lovely characters a big warm hug.
B001W63DXC|5|Live CD's can be hit and miss.<br /><br />You have the likes of Nirvana's brilliant Unplugged, and then you have the appalling examples of... well, you know them as well as I do.<br /><br />Flight 666 is simply outstanding. Two CD's packed full with all the anthems that made Iron Maiden the kings of NWOBHM. A crowd in fine voice, musician's nailing it every time, and Bruce Dickinson doing what he does best.<br /><br />The highlight tracks are Fear of The Dark and Can I Play With Madness - simply outstanding.
B000MNP2KI|2|Being a huge Bond fan, I highly anticipated watching Casino Royale and I'm sad to say, I was completely disappointed.  The storyline was very fractured, Daniel Craig was not believeable as Bond and at the end of the movie I found myself sayin \\"huh?\\"  I understand Casion Royale is the first Bond book and this movie introduces Bond to the world and Bond is learning his way, still I don't think the story was told very well.  While there are a couple of exciting chase scenes, I think the time spent on the chase scenes may have taken away from Bond's character development.  Even at 2 hours 22 minutes, the story felt half-told. <br /> <br />Eventhough I am disappointed with Casino Royale, if you are a Bond fan, it is a \\"must-have\\" for your collection.  Maybe it will be one of those movies that grows on me after I have seen it a couple of times, I hope so.

B008RF0M9O|5|I thought I would need to buy a new pair of Sony MDR-7506 headphones because of the ear pad deterioration until I saw this product, read the reviews and decided that it was worth giving it a try, especially at such an attractive price point. I received the product sooner than I thought I would, and they arrived in good shape. I needed to work on attaching them to the headphones a little bit, but it's not really difficult and quite simple to understand, so in short order I had them attached and ready to go. They fit perfectly on the headphones, are comfortable to wear and definitely improve the sound! Best of all, they saved me $$$$ that new set of headphones would have cost me. At an amazing low price, too! I'm thrilled with these.
B009X01GJ2|5|Very pleased with this Malware case for my Kindle Fire HD 8.9\\" purchased through Amazon. It's attractive, protects effectively and works efficiently.

B00MU79IL8|4|Not as good as expected
B00127RAJY|5|Loved it, loved it and loved it! Let me tell you I hate working out. Still hate working out and I may always hate working out but the one thing I realized with me needing to lose about 90lbs is that with correct eating I have to work out as well. I used to work out 3xtimes per week doing low impact aerobics and I saw a difference in my body. However, when I started doing Jillian's workouts, man she kicked my butt! Just the warm up makes your heart race and your body sweat. By the end it I am laying on the floor, soaked with sweat but really feeling good. I have knee problems. Not because I hurt my knee but because my weight is causing my knees to ache and grind. Even though I hate jumping, but I still do it. If a 400lb person can jump and not knock themselves out then I can do it. Some people say this is for more advanced people. No, its for a beginner as well. She gives you the beginner and modified version and you can do it until you have lost more weight or have the strength to do the modified version. So, buy this DVD, you will not be sorry and you WILL see results! Good luck! I will check back in a few weeks and let you guys know how much additional weight I have lost! Go Jillian and thank you for bringing basics back!

B0067TGSOK|5|This is one of the books where you actually end up with ideas or at least a direction of what you should do next.<br /><br />Beautifully structured and well written.
B000003N7G|5|Those were the words of the record store owner as I brought the cover to the counter to purchase. I of course already knew this; I may be a compulsive buyer when it come to CDs but I am also selective (otherwise I would probably have triple the amount of CDs I do!) and I had heard the music on this album before.<br />I had heard a year before I purchased it. At the time I was fairly new to the jazz world. I had listened to the work of Miles Davis on Kind of Blue and Birth of the Cool. This album is nothing like this. It is ironic that Miles who was an often short-tempered and jealous man would be able to play music with such beauty and eloquence. Coltrane was often referred to as an &quot;angry tenor&quot; for his often raw and bursting solos, yet he seems like someone who would be more the brooding kind. <br />Over the year I have become a much deeper jazz fan and I understand a great deal about the history of the music. Having listened to the more free and wild sounding work of Miles' Second Quintet at the famous Plugged Nickel in 1965, I had grown more used to to strangeness that seemed present on &quot;A Love Supreme&quot;. <br />This album is so emotional it is not funny. He plays from his soul. The music seems like noise to a person who has the audacity to play it as background music, but if you focus on Coltrane's soloing, you'll hear something close to pure beauty.<br />Not for the faint hearted and the unadventurous, this is an album that is demanding but very rewarding. If you bring an open mind with you for a listening session, you'll bring so much out with you. Although this was John's prayer to God, he has left us with a divine gift that shows us that God's is a love supreme.

B007IXWL2C|5|These series were amazing to read. Such intense moments where you really felt like you where there next to the character.
B004PYDBVM|5|The author demonstrates through his own testimony how powerhungry and vicious the North Korean Kim regime happens to be. I was moved by how the author's family moved to North Korea from Japan with a starry-eyed vision of North Korean society, only to realize their mistake in moving there. Although the book covers the 1970s and 1980s, it is just as relevant now; since the North Korean government has not changed its policy of imprisoning political prisoners.
B00VFTD43A|5|Everything about this movie is excellent! The acting and writing is superb. Unfortunately, the story is true.
1592401791|5|Like most people, I enjoy the Beatles music but I am not really a fan. I didn't expect this book to engage me as much as it did. I read it in a day! <br /> <br />The book is well written and easy to read, which I think is the contribution of co-author Howard Massey. Massey has written another great book entitled, \\"Behind the Glass,\\" which is a collection of interviews with top record producers describing how they create hit records. I highly recommend that book as well.  <br /> <br />This book is not technical and is really written to appeal to anyone with an interest in the 60s, the Beatles or the music industry. There are \\"cameo appearances\\" in the book by some other great artists of the times, including Judy Garland and top classical musicians that recorded at EMI studios.  <br /> <br />Some of the other reviews criticize Emerick for his favoritism of McCartney and knocks on the other Beatles. My attitude is that this book is about Geoff Emerick more than anything else. This is a recollection of his personal experiences with the Beatles and is written from his point of view. The fact that his impressions of the four Beatles as individual people don't always coincide with the mythology that has developed aboutt them over the years is interesting and understandable. It makes complete sense to me that Emerick, as a professional recording engineer/producer, would favor McCartney. While I strongly prefer Lennon's music over McCartney's, the fact is that McCartney was the best overall musician of the Beatles. Ask anyone who has seeen McCartney live lately, he effortlessly moves between bass, guitar and piano, and plays them all equally well. Since Emerick worked everyday with some of the world's greatest musicians (he worked with some pretty famous people other than the Beatles), he must have been impressed by Paul's talent.  <br /> <br />Emerick also claims that McCartney was the one Beatle that took the strongest interest in the process of recording. Since Emerick isa professional recording engineer, it makes sense that he would bond with McCartney. Let's face it, if one of the Beatles took a strong interest in what you do for a living, you would think they were the greatest Beatle too! <br /> <br />I rate it five stars. It is well written and gives a fresh perspecitve to the Beatles.
B00J2PEU3W|5|This movie did a lot to make Walt Disney a likable, real person that you wish you could have known personally thanks to the awesome talent of Tom Hanks, and you definitely will want to see the Poppins movie again after the vivid  characterization of the story's  author by Ms. Thompson . A great , feel-good movie .

0321344758|5|Absolutely everyone should read this book. The internet would be a far better place. I am a professional web designer and parts of it were still eye opening.    But even my mother, who is not a designer of any kind, enjoyed reading it for fun and came away with a new appreciation for good design (and the need for common sense on the internet!)
B000MQC9H4|5|I bought it 2 days ago, and since...I watched it 4 times in a row. LOVE IT. What a masterpiece ! And it worthes any penny ! Love it , love it, love it !!! <br />Nancy Meyers: BRAVO !

B00003BDXG|5|This movie gives off mixed reviews, since most people can't see through the murderous rampage the movie takes us through. This a typical Tarantino movie, even though Oliver Stone picked it up, meaning that you have to like gore, violence, and sex a whole lot more than the average Joe. I feel the cast was perfect for the topic, Juliette Lewis has always done a perfect job at portraying mental patients from retards to maniacs. Woody Harrelson also a superb job as serial killer...but my favorite has to be Robert Downey Jr. (the 'do anything for a story reporter')he's the one who gives the movie a comical touch, along with Tommy Lee Jones who plays the uptight and over confident warden, at the prison where the killers are being held.     The movie's camera angles and weird effects help get the insanity across, this may catch a lot of you off guard...  In the end the movie requires effort from the viewer to get its point through, which is to mock and portray an exagerated view of the American obsession with tragedy, and its corrupted media.
B000002KHH|5|Truly the complete package. Bill and Geezer were a solid foundation for the brilliant riffs of Tony Iommi and Ozzy's superb lyrics.<br />They were the best and I still play this cd. People believe they were devil worshippers etc. Listen to the lyrics. The songs are about warmongerers and evil politicians. Menacing sounds but not occult. Geezer and Ozzy, Tony and Bill had their finger on the pulse of the out of work and downtrodden. I love it.
0156027321|5|It is one of those books you wont want to put down until you read it all. Makes you reflect on the important things in life.

0689835604|5|This is my grand-daughters 3rd book of where's the belly button. It's one of her favorites. It's cute to lift up the flaps. We've bought another of Karen Katz books with flaps and short lines on every page and she loves them too. Just enough words not too long for her to lose interest.

B00000IPAX|3|Granted, this album got me into blink-182.  But right after that, I picked up Buddha, Cheshire Cat, and Dude Ranch - all of which (well, maybe not Buddha) are VASTLY better when it comes to originality and true punk.  blink intentionally went for a more processed, radio-friendly sound - but come on.  They got what they wanted - fame, fortune, and reputation, but at the same time, sacrificed a lot of their fans and went back on their raunchy, punk roots.  Now, that's not neccessarily a bad thing.  They wanted to try something different.  Their next album (Take Off Your Pants And Jacket) is, according to Mark Hoppus, old-school, Dude/Cheshire blink-182.  There ARE a lot of good songs on this - Adam's Song, Dumpweed, Anthem (GREAT GREAT song), and Aliens Exist are a few - but this is something you'd listen to on the radio and MTV, not at a punk show.  It's a great pop album, no matter what people say, but if you want raunchy and snotty blink-182, look elsewhere.

B000XUBFE2|5|We may know the history of the holocaust but each individual story that is revealed in fiction or in fact brings us deeper into that horror.  And if that  revelation is accomplished with humor and.
B007MS5B6Q|5|Love this it is awesome!
B0047Y17P2|5|Michael Connelly succeeds in keeping the suspense until the very end. I have learned that to speculate about &#34;who did it&#34; is a waste of precious  time...now I just sit back and devour every well written page.
1932100660|5|The China Study would be a great text for all high school and college students.  It is the definitive study of diet and nutrition on cancer, as well as the major diseases that plague our industrialized nations.  The answer is \\"simple\\" (just eat plants), but tough to learn a whole new way of eating.  However, the prize (good health) is worth it.  My brother is currently dying of cancer, despite the best efforts of traditional medicine.  My son's girlfriend is also using traditional therapies to treat her cancer.  The rate of cancer is soaring.  This book is the first to give real answers, based on 40 years of research with the largest population sample ever taken in the world.  The results are conclusive. After reading this book, my whole family is learning a new way to eat...  and we actually like it!
B003G4W49C|3|I thought it was not beautifully written it was pretty good and I want to read the second one that is called Speaker For The Dead
B007I1QUYE|1|I ordered it new and it came in in an already opened case and it was fairly poor condition I had to tape it for it to stay together....enough said
B00H58VGIA|5|You don't have to live in Charleston,SC, to appreciate the story because there is such a strong sense of place. I was transported back to a time when being a woman and being a black woman in particular had its rigid codes and dangers. Great story based on true characters.
B00NEJ7MMI|5|This is a wonderful cd. If you're looking to add to your collection I hghly recommend this one.
B006DJ2JSI|5|Couldn't be any better. What every tablet needs. It even pronounces the words. Easy to use and to look up words.
B00JKOI26G|5|This one I have to say I was very excited to get when I heard they were releasing it. As a longtime Kiss fan, since the age of 6, I really played their Lp's to death. The Elder as we all know, is very controversial within the catalog. I was taken aback when I first heard it when it was originally released and couldn't appreciate it for what it was then so I just played my favorite tracks from the LP then.  Over time, I've grown to love the LP and its one of my all-time favorite Kiss releases and its the one I play just as often as Destroyer (resurrected) and Alive I and II. The quality is very high. Having the correct track listing helps a lot with the story as well Ha! Everything is reproduced here beautifully and it sounds so thick and good it's intense. Actually, it puts the Remastered CD version to shame. This is the way it was supposed to be and say what you will about this one song-wise but there is no denying the sonic quality of this particular release. It's better than the original release of course, and I am so happy I got it. Now I can zip up the original version and save it for nostalgic reasons and play the heck out of this one... I might just wear it out. It's really incredible.
0060899220|4|I've never worked in a restaurant myself, nor do I typically read non-fiction books, so this book would not normally fall on my must-read list.  However, one of my best friends (who managed a very successful restaurant for years) insisted that I had to read it.  I'm glad I did.    This was a gritty, raunchy, satisfying look into the food industry as a whole.  AB tells stories from his past experiences starting with his first love of food and following him to cullinary school and through his first jobs in the real world.  He isn't afraid to share his failures both personally and professionally.  He also isn't afraid to share some of the secrets of the kitchen.    If I remember nothing else from this book, I'll remember his instruction for when it is best to order seafood in a restaurant and when it is a bad idea.  The book is worth reading for that little bit of information alone.     I also appreciated his description of the signs of a restaurant that is starting to fail.  After reading this part of the book, I could see these signs in several places I used to go to but lost interest in.    There was certainly nothing glamorous about AB's kitchen world.  And, because I have no experience in this arena myself, I really couldn't speak to the truth of the descriptions and am simply taking his word for it.  But it was fun to read regardless.  It actually read more like a novel than non-fiction which I was happy about.  AB is very good at telling a story.    I'd recommend this book to anyone who considers him/herself a foody either professionally or as a hobby.  If you are a fan of the food network channel, and you don't mind a lot of cursing, then this book is for you.

B00004SVID|5|I anxiously awaited the release date of this cd so I could sample if I wanted it or not. Tower records had almost the whole cd samples on their web site, but the samples made me think it was very similar to the original  recording with little variation. Then the local newspaper gave it great  reviews (a rarity). So I read other amazon reviews and decided to try it.   I was blown away!  The songs are better than the original... except  Comfortably Numb, which is better served on Pulse,  which actually improves  on the original studio version. The best is Another Brick in the Wall Pt2  which has an extended guitar solo. Also the new songs are quite cool.   Notice the lyrics to What shall we do now? are printed on the original wall  lyrics sheet, but the song is absent.  How cool to have it included here.  The last few bricks, the second &quot;new&quot; song is like an  instrumental summary of the theme of the album with some cool guitar work.  I opted for the cheap version rather than the book version, and after  hearing the cds wish I had spent the extra money for the book. If the book  is anything like that of Pulse, it would be worth the extra cash.  Not to  say the 2 booklets in the version I got aren't cool.  But they tease of  what the book might be like. Anyway...if you are skeptical, give it a  try... you might be very pleasantly surprised.
B004G6009U|5|I loved the movie. I rilly injoyed it from beginning to end. I have nothing ells to say adout the movie
B009ZQC7MY|5|Well written and acted, interesting storylines, very classy and everything else about this series is excellent. I love British programs!
B00BGI076M|5|Nice to again see Kevin Bacon on TV.....Think the first season is better than the second....what will the third be like?????
B000UZ4EP2|4|I have this cd 3 weeks now. I like it very much, it's a very moving and enchanting cd. It's always difficult buying a cd based on some pieces of music from about 30 seconds. But talking about Maire/Moya Brennan you never buy a pig in a poke (my personal opinion). Just sit back in a quiet place and enjoy this music. No yoga can compare with this. I hope there are more cd's from her to come.
B00QVZ1VXI|4|I don't like it as much as their first album, but it's still really good.
B001MYIXAC|4|The other reviews are stating that you should hold off until you can get a hand on the original theatre dubbing of the movie but I still found the Magnolia release adequate. I've seen my share of badly dubbed movies and this was a decent dub.    As for the movie itself, I found it chilling but sweet. I can't find a way to describe those aspects without spoilers so I'll just say this; if you love vampire movies, you'll love this. A human boy meeting a vampire girl; the awkward and disturbed boy with the girl with adult eyes.
B004EPZ0AC|1|This film was HORRIBLE! Was such a waste of money! I pretended to have a stomach problem to excuse myself from watching the film with my friends, who also left it early because it was so bad.
B00AIUUXHC|3|I love this game, I wish the accessories were back:<br /> (Baby shark,<br />  Top hat,<br />  Price tag,<br />  Gold necklace, E.C.T...)<br /><br />But still fun to play.
B00QR7ZOZG|5|Review of the DMM vinyl reissue ... replete with download code for FLAC files and single sleeve cover with single, 2-sided sheet with lyrics and photos from original sleeve.<br /><br />This was the first Rush album I ever heard and is still the album I most enjoy on a repeated basis. I'd say its easily my favorite Rush release, in part due to the critical time in my life when it was released and also just the perfect nature of the songs themselves. As always, the Rush sound continued to evolve with this album. Like any great band, Rush never evolved too quickly for their fans' sake. This record was the perfect transition from the old Rush to the new Rush (at the time), and to this day the sounds from this recording remain very distinct from the other Rush releases. The ethereal quality of \\"Jacob's Ladder,\\" \\"Different Strings\\" and \\"Natural Science\\" stand perfectly juxtaposed with the more commercial/accessible \\"The Spirit Of The Radio,\\" \\"Entre Nous\\" and \\"Freewill\\" - all so wonderfully balanced. Lyrically, Peart finally broke through with words everyone could grasp - the lyrics some of the band's best ever. \\"Jacob's Ladder\\" is just such an obliteratingly ominous tune with a sound that echoes the message and to hear this in this new vinyl formal is really a treat. And \\"Natural Science\\" - the other epic here - sounds equally enthralling. From the music, to the lyrics, to the album artwork, this release remains a timeless masterpiece and the DMM vinyl brings out all of the fullness this recording has to offer. This is easily the best one in the series so far.
B00FAPF5U0|5|Very fun easy to understand. I love the boosters, great for kids. A lot like farm saga but a little easier.
0761145613|5|I love this calender. There's lot of room to keep track of all the activities and events for the family. This is my second year buying one and I don't think I will go back to the traditional calender again...the vertical layout is great!
B00T40UK20|5|Great product. Thank you.
B00AHSIQWE|2|The final film in this trilogy was a &#34;  Grave Disappointment!!! &#34; It just didn't make any kind of sense at ALL!!! I mean, what the hell was &#34; Cat Woman, and Bane all about!?!?&#34; They just didn't fit into the narrative and/or plot of the film...it would have been better to bring back the character of &#34; The Joker &#34; to finish the trilogy...especially since the character didn't die in the second film...&#34; The Dark Knight!,&#34; which I found to be the &#34;Very BEST of the trilogy&#34;...especially w/ the 'late' Heath Ledger' performance as the &#34; The Joker!!! &#34; I keep asking the question: &#34; Why keep putting &#34;Cat Woman &#34; in the film franchise, if all she' is going to be is a &#34; glorified sex symbol &#34; w/o any &#34; real sense&#34; of purpose to the story or plot of the movie!?!? &#34;  And...&#34; Bane&#34; left me w/ huhs?? & &#34;WTFs?! &#34;  This particular character was just &#34; a waste of time, and effort!!! &#34;  I expected &#34; much better substance&#34; from Christopher Nolan,&#34; but that' NOT what we received...and that' a &#34; tragedy in and of itself!!! &#34;  So...I'm giving it &#34; 2 Stars&#34; only because I liked Christian Bale' performance of &#34; The Batman!!! &#34; -Mikey
B005E7AOHI|5|In a year (decade?) that has been largely free of great rock records (Them Crooked, Foo Fighters, Big Talk, Mastodon and a handful others excepted), it's so damned great to hear Primus get back to basics and deliver some seriously mindful rock.     Oh, and you need to buy five. One for you, and four for the people who will love you for the gift. That hot girl/guy down the hall/next door/at work? Yeah, s/he needs this record... and will reward you by fulfilling your every fantasy. Worked for me, this trick, and it can work for you.
B007XKEY6Q|5|Love it💚
B00JCW0BCY|5|Being Mortal is very inspiring, informative, and genuine. I learned a great deal and have gained new insights on medicine, death, and the meaning of life. He is a great author and I plan on reading his other books as well
B005ZOBNOI|5|Wonderful story. Well written. Heartfelt love that endured life struggles. I was able to read this book in a day. Loved the authors voice and style.
B002QE3CTY|2|This is a weird hybrid of ENDER'S GAME, HUNGER GAMES, LORD OF THE FLIES and a rip off of a dozen other stories. If you're looking for something good to read, I recommend turning to THEM INSTEAD.<br /><br />I read this book after hearing so much hype about it. In truth, it should have been right up my alley but after plowing through it last night I have to say I was very disappointed.<br /><br />The characters were oversimplified, bipolar and shallow.  The story was confusing and pretty lackluster. The pacing was way off. The first 50 pages could have been condensed into 10. The writing was distractingly poor for much of it - although was much less noticeable throughout the action scenes. Dashner does seem to have a way with the action scenes and some of the more suspenseful, creepy moments. A star for that. I definitely had nightmares.<br /><br />If the main character had any more emotions I might have screamed. I did like Minho - the Keeper of the Runners - but he suffered from the same failing as the other characters: undeveloped.<br /><br />Tonally is was at times amateurish and at other times way too adult. There were just so many things that made me scratch my head and I never got a good answer for them. Nor did it make me want to keep reading to series to get the answers. I finished it so quickly just to be done with it.<br /><br />All said, I think it will make a far better movie. It's in desperate need of some network notes.<br /><br />SPOILER<br /><br />Chuck was one of my biggest pet peeves. Why the hell did Dashner keep teasing that he may or may not be evil but there was no pay off? His sacrifice and Thomas' connection with him seemed COMPLETELY unwarranted. Also - I can't remember the line verbatim - but Thomas cares about Chuck so much that he feels like they have the same MOTHER? I mean....was Dashner just trying to make their bond seem stronger or do they ACTUALLY have the same mother (like is that the worst foreshadowing ever)? I'm perfectly happy getting the cliffnotes answer rather than having to read the other books.
B00BC5I6Q2|5|I love the acting in this thriller. It is so upsetting to see, but I'm sure that the real stories in government parallel this series. Too bad that elected officials are so corrupt and out for themselves.
B00DQR26EC|4|I got it as app of the day. Its fun but definitely has some of my least favourite tropes from jrpgs (low money:hp ratio, have to grind twenty fights to upgrade 1 piece of gear for 1 character)
B009YP9L7U|5|This book is a great read. Quirky and made me want to have their life. Read it!!! Now. Go! Yes.
B008M34INW|5|Despite the peaks and valley of Mr. Gibson's career after his verbal rant and relapse, Mr. Gibson's acting has earned five stars from me.  This movie kept my interest until the very end.  supporting actors were excellent also.
B005LAIH3G|5|I have to add my 2 cents to these reviews and say I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Enough so that I will definitely be purchasing the 3D version of the Blue Ray. It had an intriguing plot, great chemistry between the actors and fantastic special effects. I was not familiar with the 100 year old story/book but would like to read it now that I have seen the movie. It's regrettable this movie did not fare well in the theaters because it's doubtful we'll see any of the subsequent stories brought to life on film. That's a real shame!
B00DMCV7K0|4|Based on  historical background and factual information the characters bring to life a period of US history that I wouldn't have thought I could learn something new. But, alas, I did.  Developing two different perspectives from a culture of slavery  the author gives insight to the inner feelings of both, and the part they played in developing their future journey revealing  an inner strength that propelled them to their surprising destiny.
B004WR125O|3|This thing would've been completely awesome had it worked. I installed it, seems to be picking up wireless signals okay, not sure if it's a problem with the wireless adaptor or the receiver, either way I don't have wireless so a waste of $$
B005XQLBU4|5|This game starts off easy and gradually speeds up and becomes more difficult. In the early levels, the player is allowed to become comfortable with the dynamics of the game, as well as upgrade their missiles. Once the player reaches the higher levels (nights), the game becomes more strategic and requires more concentration.  Overall, the game is very fun, but can become a bit repetitive.
B007SGM084|3|Predictable.
B00IUBXPEY|2|If you read the books, and/or loved the first movie, you are in luck, as this is the first movie all over again. The whole first half of the film is a convoluted plot to get them back in the &#34;games&#34; again, from there on out, it's about the same as the first one.
0756404746|5|Great storyline.  Would love to see them make it into a film.
B00I8Q77Y0|4|This game is very similar to floppy birds and just as hard! It is harder to get the bird through the pipes, so it may cause more rage.<br />But overall, a very good game!
B0098VXBIA|4|This was a cute movie. I liked the portrayal of both mothers-to-be and the fathers-to-be. Some parts were cheesy, but overall it was good.
B0097HSS4M|5|My 11 year old daughter loves this! It is simple for her to create captions, get rid of red eye, all on her mp3 player.
B00L9B7IKE|5|Really enjoyed the book.  Fun mystery reading.
B00JHIDON6|5|Excellent book. Top five. We have a problem and it is the extraction industry, not unlike the alien in the movie Alien.
B0001AP12G|5|Kanye West! A great producer and lyricist. I bought the cd yesterday and fell in love with it. Most of the songs are inspirational and full of humor. One song that hit me the most is JESUS WALKS! I played that song over and over again and sometimes wish why didn't I wrote it!? Anyway, Kanye is one of the greatest producers/rappers in hip hop im my eyes. Luv ya, Kanye!!!!!!!!!!!
B00E9O6C96|1|I have been unable to get this thing to read its additional memory, even after going through all the conniptions required to format it as FAT 32.  It just resolutely refuses to see it.  Also, it won't update its own software.  Not exactly encouraging.  I notice lots of people seem to have had this problem.<br />So as long as you are happy to live with its meager internal 8G of memory, it probably works OK.  But I can't recommend it.
B0096MM9GG|5|This game is awesome I played the kind of same game sometime but I don't remember but all you'll have to know is this game is good and I got it for free 5 star of course
B006BDHAX0|5|Love game-many different screens -- relaxing -- music gets a little boring -- maybe have some different ones to choose from.
B001PPGAIA|3|I (for the most part) enjoyed Australia, the acting was a bit over the top, and the plot meandered quite a bit, but was over-all pretty entertaining once it settled in.<br /><br />It is a bit long, and has three separate plot lines.<br />1: The Apartheid that was practiced by Australia.<br />2: A business crime plot<br />3: A romance.<br /><br />Each of which was pretty good individually but for me, they didn't quite mesh as well as they might.  For those interested in the Apartheid plot and the \\"Stolen Generation\\" You might enjoy the film [[ASIN:B00005JLD4 Rabbit-Proof Fence]]that documents this ugly period in Australia's history.<br /><br />So, here's the deal Australia is a pretty good movie, but would have been a better mini- series.
B009UX2YAC|5|Started playing this game with my grandson and we both love it..I updated but kinda like the old version better but this game is fun. My grandson loves it!
B00BAXFECK|2|The prose was amazing, but I did not enjoy the story of 2 pathetic addicts.  I honestly couldn't wait for the story to end so I could read something that didn't put me to sleep. I will not read any other novels by Tart.
B00KA87GCW|5|Very fun to play.  Too bad that you need to use energy to play.  Overall I recommend this game for people who like this type of game.
B00QW8TYWO|5|All I can say Is AMAZING AND ADDICTING AND FUN
B00B7Y0206|5|Don't know what Linda is talking about I give five star it is completely free and she is crazy
B00FKF0F3C|3|I have read a good share of Ken Follett's books. Some of his early books were amazing. I found that this really was a slow read--not a page turner as some of his books have been for me. I had trouble keeping track of characters and, with a few exceptions, I did not think the characters were that well developed. That said, there were parts of the book that I did enjoy reading and I liked the subject very much. My expectations were high and I have to admit I was disappointed in the end.
B009ZQ8FQG|5|Excellent!
B00004VVPR|5|Having remembered fondly the other Buck Rogers movie from the late 70s, if I recall right, I had always wanted to see this one.<br /><br />I wasn't disappointed. Filled with dramatic and improved special effects (it was now several years from the first Star Wars movie), spectacular cinematography, absolutely fabulous costumes, beautifully done sets, and a stellar cast, this movie delivers on all counts. I suspect just their costume budget was more than the original Star Wars movie.<br /><br />The plot is well known, so I won't comment there. But the entire cast looks like they're having a grand time with this campy, fun-filled, futuristic romp. Brian Blessed, who plays Vultan, the king of the Hawkmen, looks like he's having the time of his life. In fact, while watching the movie I reflected that I couldn't ever recall seeing an actor having such an uproarious, rip-snorting good time playing a role. He is absolutely beside himself with the pleasure of playing that part,  and I just found out why after doing a little research on the IMDB site. Here's an except from the page there:<br /><br />\\"As a child he and his friends used to play at Flash Gordon, inspired by the Buster Crabbe TV serials. In these childhood games Brian would always play Vultan, leader of the Hawkmen. In the 1980 film Flash Gordon he played the same role as he had in childhood.\\"<br /><br />No wonder Brian is having such a good time. :-) It's amazing that he got to play the role of his favorite character in the big screen movie. Good for Brian, who has always been one of my favorite actors. What an amazing coincidence and stroke of good luck for Brian.<br /><br />All the actors are great too, and Max von Sydow is perfect as the evil Ming. But everyone else in the cast is superb also, including the ones I didn't know as well, and I only knew Timothy Dalton from his James Bond roles.<br /><br />Overall, a fun movie that more than does justice to the original concept.
B0041KKYH4|5|love it
B000002UB6|4|Let It Be....Naked id much better then this! But this also has its moments. All The songs here are good and so it has no low points except for the extremly of produced part. Phil Specter is one of the greatest produces ever and we all know that but what he did to this album was just wrong, the title track sounds completlydiffernt on each album, and 'The Long And Winding Road' completly sucks on this album, I never liked this song till I got it on Let It Be....Naked. Now my biggest complaint about this album is where the hell is 'Dont Let Me Down' that is one of The Beatles top five songs.<br />So this is worth the money if you are a true Beatles fan but if you just want this album for the hits then get Let It Be....Naked becuase the songs sound better, they got rid of the filler and it has 'Dont Let Me Down' which is better then any song on the original album of Let It Be!
B00H3GZMIE|5|My new favorite singer. Very soulful
B00HV8TN7K|3|It was an interesting study in filmmaking. Two hours, one character and almost no dialogue.
B007J4T2G8|5|Christian was a deeply troubled character with a laundry list of issues, but as a reader, I could understand why he was so flawed. He had a terrible childhood that would leave anyone emotionally damaged. Once Ana came into his life, he was finally ready to take a chance on life. Some of the things he said and did were a little creepy, his jealousy, possessiveness, stalker-like tendencies, were more than a little unnerving, but it made his character so compelling that I couldn't put this book down. Off to start Fifty Shades Darker now...
B007IXWKUK|5|Great Read!!
B003UXX0JW|5|Love this TV show. It has everything sci fi lovers look for, magic, action, love and an exciting story of good versus evil for all ages. I wish there would have been a third season, but these two seasons were superb!
B00W6XM002|5|Keeps me challenged!
B009UX2YAC|5|My son's favorite game ever.
B007PT3QOQ|5|One of the best free games out there. Totally worth the download. Better than any of the &quot;tap&quot; games. I would recommend it to anyone who loves Sim and strategy games.
B00BP4Z8XY|5|I enjoyed watching this movie for family night with my girls! I recommend this to all families! I wonder sometimes if this really could happen in real life!What if?
B00G9C6USE|5|This is very beautiful and brightens up a room. it takes a little while to put the pieces together but it is worth the time and energy.
0553260111|4|This book was great...after reading the book after I watched the movie, I relized that the book was better.  Although I liked the movie and purchased it, I felt that the book had enough detail to keep you reading as if you were watching the movie.  The book was great and I will most likely read it again, if you liked the movie I highly recommend this book, and even if you have read the book I recommend that you watch the movie, it was great too..
1616550414|5|Very we'll put together. Does a good job of explaining a lot of what can be missed even by hardcore or long term fans. Beautiful art. Half the book is dedicate to Skyward Sword, which didn't make top three for a lot of gamers, but the rest is a well done canon of Hyrule legend and mythos, plus plenty of concept art.  Well worth the buy.
B001UV4XTC|5|Larry Gopnik is a physics professor and family man who suddenly finds his life turned upside down. It starts when his wife takes up with Sy Ableman and continues with a seemingly endless stream of moral, legal and financial problems. Most people would fight back with a fury. But Gopnik has a timid and indecisive temperament, the kind that allows others to walk all over him while he wonders what he is doing wrong.     He goes to see two junior rabbis. They bring up issues related to God that has Gopnik questioning himself even further. But, stil feeling unsatisfied, he has a driving need to see Rabbi Marshak. However the senior rabbi is unwilling to talk with anyone besides boys who have just had their bar mitsvah. The film ends abruptly and with a sense of impending doom that leaves Gopnik more confused and doubting himself than ever.    I really loved this movie and I'm disappointed that it hasn't seemed to garner the widespread acclaim of the Coen brothers' \\"No Country For Old Man\\". But maybe it's very Jewish characters are difficult for some people to relate to. Personally, as an atheist \\"goy\\", I found Gopnik's struggles to be universal and enjoyed the movie's religious imagery and biblical references. Suburban life in the late 60's was also beautifully captured, including Gopnik's nervous lusting for a sunbathing neighbor. I especially enjoyed the subplot involving Gopnik' teen-age son, as his pot smoking, Jefferson Airplane listening and general rebelliousness signal the social changes occurring. The best film I have seen this year. Don't miss it!
B005KJJ4F8|4|Great book. I bought the second and will buy third and fourth. I liked how finally Cinderella is not helped by a fairy godmother. I recommend this book to people who like mecha robots and a love romance.
B004HW7JMO|5|My husband loved it!!
B008JFURF6|5|Purchased as present for granddaughter. She loved it.
0345803493|3|Same old same
B0010YPTGU|5|This concert is VERY special and worth the price for a front row seat!!!    I'm so glad that I discovered it!!
B000FCK65W|3|I had trouble keeping interested in a story that tries to describe life in detail, but at the same time follow the lives of several characters over a lengthy time period. As a history major I appreciated the authenticity of  their circumstances, but the teacher in me was glad to see education receive its due!
B004EBT5CU|4|I like Adeles singing and this had some of her best. I like it and listen in my van. Very nice
B000JBWWRY|5|Just received this by mail yesterday. My daughter and I grabbed popcorn and sat side by side to watch it. Love our moments together with her Disney movies.
B00008J2PG|4|I realy  enjoyed the selection.
B000002KFJ|5|While \\"Paranoid\\" is probably Sabbaths most wellknown and most appreciated piece of work (a classic), I believe that \\"Sabotage\\" is my favorite Sabbath album. This isnt to say that \\"Paranoid\\" isn't a metal classic, a ground breaker. However, there's something about \\"Sabotage\\" that really gets my blood rolling. Ozzy is obviously crazy, and it really comes through on this album. The lyrics are totally nihilistic, self loathing and narsicistic. In other words, its genius. Ozzy, for those who dont know this yet, is NOT the best singer. He's not even pretty good singer. He's often off key and out of sync with the music, but its the WAY he delivers his \\"sermons\\" that make him so damn good. So LISTENABLE. Its almost as if he's making STATEMENTS, not singing. The music, as on ALL Sabbath albums, is pounding, deep and unrelenting. These guys were really the predescessors of all metal....speed metal and death metal that we hear today. Although most metal bands play louder and faster than Sabbath, nobody plays BETTER. All songs on here are good, with my favorite being \\"Dont Start (too Late)\\", \\"Megalomania\\" and \\"Hole in the Sky.\\" This album is a must have.
B009XIXVU6|2|The story started strong but died in the middle with events and character's unrelated to the main character's.<br />The ending was no surprise and somewhat predictable.
B003VANOFY|3|Alright so I've had these for years now and can say that they are just mediocre. The interference that occurs when around any wifi signal sucks. Having the headset cutout while your trying to talk is outraging sometimes. It has pros, like the fact that its wireless and that its 7.1 is setup pretty well.
0061015725|4|I found Prey to be a real page burner. It hooked me from the first few pages until the very last phrase. As scifi goes, the book is not of the caliber of what are in my opinion the greatest works of scifi such as Dune or the Foundation series, but Crighton manages to consistently produce novels that are both scientifically sound and engaging that echo the long gone era of classic science fiction in which science and not magic drove the plots. As forty year devotee of the genre and a faculty member who teaches a course about scifi, I highly recommend it.
0596007124|5|If you haven't read a pattern book before, this is the one to start with.  It not only teaches patterns in an approachable manner, it also teaches sound object oriented design.  It's so good I've bought one for every person on my team.  Each time we hire a new developer we hand them a copy of Head First Design Patterns.  Excellent book.
B009FZHYKU|5|great show. lots of character growth. no favorites played. the writers are unconcerned about who they kill off and i think that is a great angle.
B009FZFONO|5|Great Series- I am catching up before the new season starts...Amazon is easy to order from and I like the way it keeps track of what episodes you have already purchased.
0140186395|5|This is the most interesting book I have ever read. Slow paced and somewhat unorganized, yet the book presents powerful and unique characters, making the book even more intriguing.  Adam and Charles and Aron and Caleb recreate the old Biblical story of Cain and Abel. Battling between the choice of good or evil, the characters allow themselves to shape their lives. Therefore, Timshel or thou mayest, the power of choice, is the most important underlying theme in this book. The choice helps characters to reflect oneself and to mature by recognizing their own mistakes. Read this book! I strongly recommend it.  And learn how to make right choices, which could change your life.
B000002WYT|5|The songs are fun. Crash is a  beautiful song. Nice CD. I enjoyed listening to this CD in particular driving down the road.

B007J4T2G8|1|Truly one of the worst books I've read in a very long time. Can this writer ( and I use the term loosely) honestly think readers will believe that the completely innocent young lady did not run screaming in the night after seeing Christian's \\"play room\\". And how many times can you insert \\"holy crap\\" into the dialog. The relationship which actually included a contract is one of the most ridiculous ideas I've seen, and the thought that some sane woman of intelligence, which we can only assume was Anastasia, since she had just graduated from college, would actually consider is beyond realistic. Save you your money and your time......this was so not worth $9.99 on my Kindle. Maybe if it was free!
B007EECSFA|5|I am a Kate Morton fan and she didn't disappoint me.  It was a \\"page-turner\\" and the ending did not disappoint.  About 2/3 through the book, I decided I had figured out the mystery, so I was anxious to finish to see if I was right.  I was!!  But, she was able to make me doubt myself, several times.  That is when a mystery is fun.
B00005ASOI|5|This is as good as horror films get.That's all.
B002JM1VJG|2|1. Holiday (live concert version)<br />2. Love don't live here anymore<br />3. Bad girl<br />4. Fever<br />5. This used to be my playground<br />6. American Life<br />7.

I have to think like this: Warner Bros. wanted to make a quick money with the last deal with Madonna. And Warner Bros ruined this DVD release. Don't you think so?
B006LSZECO|4|The style in which this is written was excellent at portraying the same events from different perspectives.  It will keep you tied into the  deviant personalities of the main characters, until you find out how similar they really are. I recommend this book for those who like a good mystery.
B00HV2KPNW|5|Such a great story and songs!  The focus on sisters is very special and different than most Disney movies - and the kids love it!!
B008MEM24S|5|okay if you've seen the Disney commercial about the secret duck go to the credits (in the options) and if you find it its a secret level.
B0010SKUYM|5|Loved it!
B00AREIAI8|5|My kids can't stop loving this game they are on it so much  we live on a ranch and they know how to take care of our horses now.
B004LROUNG|5|This is one of the best Grisham books I've read thus far.  The characters are well developed, and the story line is a fun one.  Anyone who's worked in corporate America will appreciate the humor, and necessity to get out of the pigeon hole rat race, and find themselves again.  It's a fun story of the 'nice guy' not always finishing last.  I recommend this to anyone out there.  A great summer read that'll keep you smiling, and rooting on the characters.  Loved it!

B008602KQI|5|Sad story. Although it's depicted as a fictional story it is the reality of what our lives are like now, people going into war killing people strangers. THe film itself is done really well. The cinematography, edit, and the impact they make with the contrasting costumes

B007IXWKUK|5|To be honest, I skip through most of the sex stuff.  Whatever.  But the characters, the story, the language, is brilliant.  Love this series, wish there were 10 more to read.
B008JGSM6G|5|A thought provoking, brain using game. Well thoughtout concept. I would highly recommend the purchase. Many boards to play and worth every second.
B003P2WO5E|5|It drew me in from the first chapter. Was a little worried after trying Alloy of Law (a sad attempt to continue the Mistborn series when the Trilogy as it ended was perfect as it was), but this completely restored my faith in Sanderson. The characters were believable, human and compelling. The story unfolded slowly, but with great pacing. Every chapter revealed something new and kept me turning the page. A little bit of a throwback to the various allomantic capabilities from the Mistborn series  (precious gems this time instead of metal?), but all in all, an amazing new world to get excited about and a great story line to unfold over the next books in the series.  Highly recommended!
B008XG1X18|5|I am a huge Pinterest fan and when I seen that the Kindle Fire had a Pinterest app I was super excited. It is everything I could imagine its convenient and fast easy to browse and you can easily re pin items. hands down my favorite app on my fire :)
B002361MLA|5|AMAZING! Going to read twice. This book holds the key to peace on.earth. Tolle is a spiritual guide to peace.
1423113381|4|If just from the book story itself, I'll rate 3 star at most ... but fortuantely, I listen the audio book which Katherine Kellgren's British accents for Sadie just make it very funny and exciting.  Overall, the story are quite simple but drag on too long.  Strongly suggest audio book for this.
B00127RAJY|3|I am finally motivated to lose weight and i was really feeling the burn on this DVD but it stopped working, in the middle which is really disappointing, I want to return and get another one but have no clue on how to. Help?
B00CNQ7HAU|5|As always a great story line and an character from a popular book. Love reading books that are a series with a character with a new story but with some past references to add interest.  Story line flowed well and was easy reading.
B00004Z459|5|Linkin Park is one of the greatest bands ive heard in a while. Their songs are excellent with amazing lyrics and vocals. Some hardcore might be dissapointed bc it does have a little rap in it and alot dont go for that...but believe me, i am a hardcore fan and i love this band. This band is great in many ways and takes rock to the next level.
B002RXMG00|5|Lot to think about
B008FQ1O1K|4|The book itself was very good and worthwhile reading.It makes you realize the value of time and how important little things are in life.
B008V59AF2|4|Good songs. Particularly :Sledgehammer&#34; and &#34;These Eyes&#34;
B000VLOKQI|5|We saw this first on VH1 while channel surfing. We were glued to the set and I knew I had to track it down for a fellow Who lover. It's a great dvd for anyone into the Who, or who would like to know their history better.
B0041KKYCY|5|I'm not a fan of horror flicks but this one was really good.<br /><br />Most horror directors pander to demented individuals who seem to enjoy excessive slash & gore & in the process they ruin what could be truly scary stories. Not so with this film! It was made with just enough violence to get the point across. No cheesy dialog & no dragging out the scenes way beyond what a normal human being cares to see.<br /><br />This movie deals seriously with rape & provides viscerally satisfying endings for each of the perpetrators.<br /><br />Gore lovers will be affected by the extreme tension in this movie but may feel cheated (who cares?)<br /><br />Pros: Read above<br /><br />Cons: Made me EXTREMELY uncomfortable (but I'm OK with that...)<br /><br />I would recommend it to any adult who's looking for a tense evening (except my Mom; she watches Fox News for that.)
B00G5G7K7O|5|Great movie! We've already watched it countless times. Definitely a favorite already!
B004G5ZXVQ|4|This CD has been out for a while, but I still find myself listening to it several rimes a week.<br /><br />It's just ripe with solid songs, and the final haunting lyrics of Blue are fantastic.<br /><br />Way to go boys.  Now hit the links.
B00XOXDXV8|5|Possible spoilers. In the summer of 1982, one of the last drive-in theaters in Northwest Indiana was about to shut down.  It was a beautiful night and what the hell, let's go.  As usual it was a double feature.  I don't remember one of the movies, but the one I do remember was called \\"Road Warrior.\\"  Not expecting much, I was mesmerized by the style and the actor I had never seen before.  It was a film by Australian director George Miller and the star was Mel Gibson.  As it turns out this was actually the second of Miller's film's featuring Mad Max.  The First called just \\"Mad Max\\" was in limited U. S. release in 1980 and didn't make any waves.  The third film was called \\"Beyond Thunderdome.\\"  It wasn't terrible but had been dumbed down in order to get a PG-13 rating.<br /><br />Miller, now 70 years old has rebooted the franchise with this magnificent spectacle, featuring Tom Hardy as Max.  While the film stands on its own, logic would suggest it takes place sometime between \\"Road Warrior\\" and \\"Thunderdome.\\"  It really isn't important.  Miller (co-scripted with Brendan McCarthy and Nick Lathouris) gets into the action quickly as Max is being chased by a gang of cut-throats.  We see him and his trusty Ford Falcon XB GT eventually get run down and he is captured.  This chase across the barren landscape (filmed in southwest Africa) is only the beginning of many, each more enthralling than the last.<br /><br />Max is taken to the Citadel headquarters where the community is ruled by a ruthless dictator named Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne, who played \\"Toecutter\\" in the original \\"Mad Max\\").  He rules over the wretched from a high stone mountain, where he controls the water.  He is aided by pale-skinned boys and young men called \\"War Boys\\" who believe death will lead them to paradise.  Key to the story is one of Joe's lieutenants named Furiosa (Charlize Theron).  Kidnapped as a young girl she is transformed into a smart, trusted warrior.<br /><br />As Furiosa leads a mission to get petrol at a nearby plant, she diverts the semi-truck and her minions in another direction.  She has in fact, rescued a handful of young women, \\"owned\\" by Joe and destined to provide him with children.  They are called \\"breeders.\\"  Women are key elements in the story.  Not only is Furiosa as strong and smart as any man, she has superior leadership skills.  The young women are able to defend themselves when the time comes.  Later in the film, older women find a place with the band heavy on estrogen with a strong dose of adrenaline.<br /><br />When Joe realizes what has happened he and his tribe are after Furiosa and her girls, one preggers with Joe's baby.  So where is Max?  As wild as this seems, Max has been converted to a literal life-line transfusing blood to a War Boy called Nux (Nicholas Hoult) who had been injured earlier.  Not wanting to miss out on the action and a possible Valhalla, he attaches a muzzled Max to the front of his rig and off he goes on the chase.  And it's a wild one.  Max eventually gets his freedom, but he truly must earn it.  In one of the better fight scenes, Max and Furiosa get it on before joining forces against the evil doers.<br /><br />There are several elements which puts this film in rarefied air of action films.  First, the photography is spectacular, providing a visual element of the expanse of the desert world the people live in.  We see long aerial shots from high above where the distance between the chased and the chasers can be reasonably calculated.  The color and scope is wonderfully elegant in contrast to the violence of the people.  In fact, an argument can be made that the film has many elements of true art.  There are a few scenes where the film blanches to black and white with perhaps a wisp of color in the eyes or a small article.  While the film has no real story to speak of, aside from survival, there is very real character development.  We care about the ladies and even Nux.  Theron is truly remarkable asFuriosa giving one of her best performances.  Dare I say, her best?  Max is a bit of a jerk, but slowly warms to the point where perhaps he and Furiosa can have some semblance of \\"redemption\\" as he says.<br /><br />The final chase back through the desert is perhaps the best I've ever seen involving vehicles.  As I understand it, the tricks with the cars and trucks are not CGI created.  Perhaps enhanced.  But the thunder of the vehicles, the booming kettle drums mounted on the back of trucks and the creep playing a fire shooting electric guitar in front of a sea of speakers is a stunning experience.  Once the movie had finished I realized I hadn't had time to even eat my bag of popcorn.  The film score is by Junkie XL and is enhanced by the Dolby Atmos sound in the theater I was in.  See it on the biggest screen you can find.  You won't be sorry.<br /><br />One of the best movies of the year watched this time in a 3-D version that wasn't an option in theaters.  Surprisingly well done, it was just as good the second time around.  This is a \\"go-to\\" film from the action genre.  Charlize Theron should be recognized at awards time, but of course she won't.  Great soundtrack adds to the fun.ces.  Dare I say, her best?

B00009RDGA|5|This is a great movie - I still chuckle at Addie demanding her $200.  I wonder if it would get past the censors these days with the scenes of Addie smoking.  Tatum O'Neal thoroughly deserved the Oscar she won.
1451662432|5|No, but seriously. This book is great. I'm a fan of Arnold, been since I was 5 years old. Doesn't mean I'm a fanboy though. This book however is very motivational and gives the reader a great perspective and lessons on life. GET IT NAU!
B0064ORVCQ|1|This has surely got to be the worst 3D conversion I have ever seen and I have watched over 150 3d Blu-rays...The film was so dark most of the time that it was hard to follow the film..Poor 3D conversions always lose quality of film and make films look really dark and make the colors dull..Worst Potter films ever 1 AND 2...

0345409671|5|Anne Rice has truly done it, a story so unbelievable that if written by anyone other than Rice herself it would be complete absurdity.  Anne Rice is a true master of the craft, which is so obviously displayed in this story.  Rice boldly travels where few authors have ever dared, Heaven and hell itself. A rich and dazzling tale made for true intellectual thought, this isn't just a story to be read passively.   Rice has pain stainkenly and passionately described both sides of heaven and hell.  Yet with true Anne Rice style she has made it an open ending for the reader to decide fact from fiction.  Can't you see the true genius of the irony in it?   The reader is so consumed deciding which side is truth that you completely forget its only fiction.  Memnoch is absolute genius, completely brilliant.
B009POCG5Y|5|Great Movie.  It is a well acted very entertaining light hearted comedy-drama.  Amy Adams and Justin Timberlake make for a good romance.

Say \\"insurmountable odds\\" and you barely encompass the challenges this 14 year old in the middle of a famine faces as he tries to change his beloved, poverty stricken village for the better.   This true story is about hope and inspiration in a world the average American can't wrap his mind around. William Kamkwamba is an endearing African teenager, who speaks simply and honestly, with the drive and persistence of a real hero.

The instrumentation alone is pure genius. Though the death of Nelson Mandela prompted me to buy this recording, I do not like it for nostaligic reasons but for the sheer pleasure it gives me.

B0026FCNK2|5|12 Monkeys is an outrageous twisting, spiraling trip forward and backwards in time.  The world above has been eradicated by a virus, leaving the remaining vestige of humanity dwelling in a Orwellian underground prison/laboratory.  Cole (Bruce Willis) is chosen to take a walk up top and collect specimens.  Later, due to his adaptability, he is chosen for another trek, this one back in time to before the virus is unleashed upon the world.  Here he meets Kathryn Railly (Madeline Stowe) a psychiatrist and Geoffrey Goines (Brad Pitt) an enigmatic mental patient on his quest to seek out the Army of the 12 Monkeys who were supposed to be responsible for the deadly virus outbreak. David Morse is the creepy scientist with the end of the world ego who travels the world with empty vials of...  Wild ride.  Terry Gilliam is at the reigns.  As with Time Bandits and Brazil and The Fisher King, twists and turns abound.  The ending might leave you asking questions and then again it might not.  Amazing movie.  Willis and Pitt throw out performances that should have garnered Academy Awards (especially Pitt's hilarious/psychotic Goines).  Definitely a treat.<br /><br />Dig it!
0743496736|4|Amazing book in my opinion. Definitely describes the hopelessness of bullying that occurs throughout school. As Picoult shows, bullying is a closed loop with no way out for the victims, who sometimes are the bullies themselves. The children being bullied really have no way out, since complaining to authorities results in the bullies getting even angrier at them because they are punished. Yet, even the bullies themselves, such as Josie, have trouble breaking away from the wrong crowd if their conscience bothers them, because doing so would cause them to draw attention to themselves by challenging the status quo.
B00IUBM8PQ|5|Much better
B00E8KLWB4|5|I love this game.  I go to it several times a day to play.  It allows me to keep my perception clear and allows me to keep my skills sharp. As soon as I think I know where an item is, it's not.  That's the vindictiveness of this game. I give it *****.
B00BPDR3F6|4|I enjoyed this!  It was thoroughly engaging, especially could be for anyone with an interest in science or 19th century history.

B002PQ7JQK|5|My experience with Star Trek is something of a jumbled mess.  My first exposure to anything &#34;Trek&#34; was the film &#34;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan.&#34;  Before that, my only knowledge of the series was what little bit my brother told me about it as he was the only person in my family who liked the original series and watched it in syndication.  I also recall getting a few coloring books featuring Trek as well.  After that, my only real exposure to Trek was the occasional TOS episode that I saw while our family was on vacation because we lived too far out in the country to get cable (not that my father would have let us have it anyway) and the films until TNG hit the airwaves.  Even in that case, though, I only watched TNG if the weather allowed.<br /><br />When I entered college, my dorm room thankfully had cable television.  I caught a few episodes of TOS on the Sci-Fi channel and watched TNG whenever I had the chance.  DS9 never grabbed my attention, and when Voyager and Enterprise came along, I only took moderate interest in either of them.<br /><br />It hasn't been until the last five years that I've really upped my exposure to Trek.  I started reading many of the books (I'm especially fond of the IKS Gorkon books), have met many castmembers, and have taken a particular shine to TOS.  I went ahead and purchased this set in order to &#34;experience the full Trek.&#34;  I was not disappointed.<br /><br />I have watched all of the episodes included in this set and most of the documentaries and specials.  I'm especially fond of the first season and really enjoy seasons two and three.  This set features excellent restorations and remastering of the source material, and the option to switch between the new and classic special FX is a very nice touch.  I especially like the fact that the updated effects blend seamlessly with the old footage from the program.  Don't go into this expecting a glaring difference between the effects and the original footage as happened with the special editions of the original Star Wars trilogy.  No, Paramount took care to not detract from the source material, opting to enhance the work that was already done instead of removing it entirely from the program.<br /><br />Of particular note is &#34;The Trouble With Tribbles,&#34; which garners its own disc and includes documentarites and the DS9 episode &#34;Trials and Tribble-ations.<br /><br />Eventually I plan on catching up with DS9, Voyager, and Enterprise.  I have many, many friends who loves these shows as well as TNG and TOS.  TOS has become my favorite program of the lot so far, and I hope to continue my voyages with the Starship Enterprise!<br /><br />Highly recommended.ppened with the special editions of the original Star Wars trilogy.

B005PK56TA|4|Overall, I really liked this season.  The actors did a great job delivering their characters.  It became addicting watching the episodes.  I think I watched the whole season in a few days!  The writing of this show is also very good although there are some scenes that were probably not necessary.  It became very sexual and graphic with some parts.  I guess the gore and sex goes with the horror territory.  It probably would have been worse on HBO or Showtime.  Despite that, still love the show, even so much more than the second season!  Wished the writers would have continued with the original storyline and cast for the second season.  : (
B00FAPF5U0|5|candy crush is addictive!!  having a little trouble getting off one level and running<br />out of lives-have to wait for new life to continue. great game--lots of fun
B00L9B7IKE|5|Fantastic mystery.  I couldn't put it down!  Expertly written.
B004DLPXAO|5|While I can still see more on a big screen, the Android app has a feature I've been hoping for forever and it's not on the computer app.  It tells me how much I have to read in a chapter.<br />When I'm reading, after I finish a chapter, I'd like to know how long the next chapter is so I can decide whether to read it or put it down. Easy in a book. Impossible on the Kindle without messing up my forward progress.<br />Now it tells me how much is left in the chapter at the bottom of each page.<br />It says it in minutes rather than pages. I'm not sure why. Pages make more sense, but it say it, and that works beautifully.
B0099Y2MYK|5|Love it.
B005544TRQ|5|Has gotten better with each episode!
B006LSZECO|4|Adult fiction; with mind bending situations at every turn of the page. A very good read with a surprise ending.
B00L9B7IKE|3|Two things led me to pick this book to read. First one is the fact that this book belonged to psychological thriller genre and second is it being the top seller on Amazon for consistent weeks. However, after completing the book, I should say it was an above average read (falls short when compared to Gone Girl). The story as it progresses is quite intriguing and keeps the reader hooked, but as it nears the end, the story becomes a tad predictable. The story is centered around Rachel, the protagonist who is made to believe that she doesn't remember anything after black out, but one day she ends up being a witness to a murder when she is totally drunk. How she decides and interprets the events of that day forms the crux of the story. I definitely liked the way, the story is presented with careful juggling of the events from the past year and the present date. To summarize, I would say it is a good read.
B0017SWPXY|5|This story is both heart breaking and<br />heart warming. It is adorably told from the dog's perspective. Dog lovers will<br />love it!
B004SIIBGU|5|Ebay is a great value on about everything you could want. Love ebay.
B004DLPXAO|4|I like the kindle and the prices here on Amazon. I liked the way you use to be able to highlighted a word and it would give you a brief meaning or click on link to give you full dictionary, they took that away in the latest update.  I also liked the two page view or one page view option., again they took that away. On my galaxy s3 phone 1 page was great and on my galaxy 10\\" tablet the two page view was perfect. I would like to see those to option back.<br />Overall one of the easiest way to one-click and buy to read I have found. It is easy to search for a book. Archiving is very easy also, but deleting can be difficult to accomplish.<br />Overall I give them a 4 star.
B003L77FYS|5|Always entertaining, this is my current go-to series for relaxing viewing, the television equivalent of comfort food. Having adored Nathan Fillion since his soap days, I looked forward to the premier season, and haven't been let down since. As he notes frequently in the commentaries, the series manages to land wonderful guest actors to glow alongside the marvelous regulars. The writing is clever and satisfying, the cinematography often exceptional for network television, and if anything would ever, ever make me want to visit New York City again, the spirit Castle might just do it, as the city herself is a central character on the show. Altogether terrific!
B00AA0TZTW|3|Some good material on here, somewhere, gypsy boy, villanova junction, but i found myself skipping thru half the tracks more often then not, some of the dagger records tracks would have been more interesting IMO. i got the target version with the extra tracks ezyrider mlk/jam, to me that was more interesting then say let me move you. the barrel bottom has been scrapped
B00992CF6W|5|I love minecraft and I have it on xbox live but there is a few problems I log on but it says it full so someone add my name on top is the tag for xbox and minecraft but please help I don't know how to use realms.
B00A17AD36|5|Absolutely love this album!! I would recommend it if you like R&B neo-soul music  - I listen to the whole thing all day long
B004ZMWUCU|4|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this tale of two people who find an unusual connection through a personal's ad. Without giving away the ending (which was perhaps a bit contrived), I will say that I found the characters to be humorous, utterly believable, and terribly poignant. The author manages to convey two very different points of view, and to intertwine the present lives and the histories of these characters in a way that left me wanting to read more of her work. Some great moments of slapstick comedy (I can easily see this done as a movie!), as well as heart-breaking sadness. Lovely read.
0547884591|5|I'm 10% of the way in, but already have a fun success story. This book is about more than just cooking, it's about how to learn. One of the examples is a short section on basketball. I've recently taken up basketball again after twenty years of not playing. My shot was never good, even though I've practiced for hundreds of hours. I always knew that I probably had poor shooting habits, but I've never known what to focus on. But somehow, this short section from 4-Hour Chef completely changed my shot. Everything that I've wanted to happen just clicked and I know with every shot what are the three things I'm focused on repeating.
B0064TVQ5E|5|2 months since I started playing this game. Get this one! You won't regret it. A little down time everyday and I go right to playing this game.
B007THA4FI|4|A detailed, introspective story about the rich and the poor. The inward battle of a few select characters leads to both growth and tragedy. J.K. Rowling continues her excellent story telling although there is no comparison to be made to the Harry Potter series.
B0060D16VI|5|This is a great movie for kids of all ages. So glad I have a kid so I could watch it :)
B009C7ZQM4|5|I like the app. it has been helping me keep my kindle fire run much faster. definetely worth getting the app
B000XUBFE2|5|Excellent read.  It was so real.  A person could just see all of this as if you were watching in person instead of reading.
B002SSUQFG|2|This watch requires constant resetting, as it will stop after a short time off your wrist. Also, it's a little on the small side.
B0014VPFTA|5|A very enjoyable group of songs except a couple of them stick in my head and after awhile it makes me crazy.
1401324649|4|An quirky little tale that makes you stop and think about nuclear proliferation.
B00J2VSS0C|4|Engaging at first, but grows to be time consuming and frustrating.
B0069UP2PI|5|This has to be one of my favorite movies of the year! Utterly believable! Not much action and a very straight forward story line but the acting, especially on Matt Damon's part, and the great production make this a special movie. More like watching a documentary than a Hollywood blockbuster. So if that's you're thing, you will love this movie as much as I did.
B00FQAZ7PW|5|I admit I was not prepared for how good this album would be. Most bands do their best creative work in their 20s, but Lightning Bolt is perhaps their best album to date--yes, even better than Ten, which is one of the best albums off all time.  Settling down to marriage and kids has been good for Eddie as his voice is amazing and his lyrics ever more thoughtful. Can't wait till their next one.
B008BMWKXO|4|4 stars
142314189X|5|Bought to encourage my 7 year old grandson to read.  He reads well and loves a challenge.  Popular set that he wants.  Watched the movie and he is excited to read on his own as well as a set his parents will read to him at night and his little brother will be listening.  Keeps everyones interest.
B00AIQP9DE|5|Excellent plot, graphics and very interesting. I liked the flow of the theme and characters. Did not like the game stopping to get you to purchase scenes.

B011KKE5OK|5|Very believable and intriguing.
B0002OERI0|5|I have been a Green Day fan since Dookie so it's great to see these guys still producing such high quality music.  It's all here; slashing guitars, bitingly sarcastic lyrics and pop hooks that grab your cranium with all their might and won't let go. Green Day proved long ago they were an excellent punk band. How many other bands could have stood in for the mighty Ramones when they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall Of Fame?  On \\"American Idiot\\" Green Day show us they are also a great pop band.  Billie Joe Armstrong is one hell of a songwriter and he proves it over and over again on this CD.  I haven't been able to find a bad song in the bunch, even after many repeated listenings.  \\"American Idiot\\" is a swift kick in the balls to the right wing junta that have taken over our government and are trying to force-feed us their neo-fascist agenda. It is even more unkind to the co-opted media and the hypnotized masses who are even now mindlessly drinking the kool-aid. It's a great song and absolutely burns the house down.  \\"Jesus Of Suburbia\\" is a masterful long form piece that takes on American suburban alienation with a nod and a wink. (It's no easy feat to keep a pop song going for over 9 minutes and still keep it fresh!)  Equally good and similar in subject matter is the punk anthem \\"Boulevard Of Broken Dreams\\".   \\"She's A Rebel\\" and \\"Extraordinary Girl\\" have soaring hooks that take you straight to pop heaven.  The boys aren't afraid to bring it down a notch and show us they can be tender on the wistful ballad \\"Wake Me Up When September Ends\\".  Best of all \\"American Idiot\\" hangs together as a cohesive whole.  All 13 tracks add up to one big piece of music that is greater than the sum of its parts. Repeated musical and lyrical themes appear across various tracks adding to the sense that this is actually the first punk rock opera. It represents a giant step forward for Green Day, a band that continues to fight the good fight against the endless deluge of mediocremusic flooding our radio waves and cable transmissions. Keep up the good work guys. Don't give up!

B007ZGO7EM|5|I like that I can see the last figure calculated, which really helps when calculating a large amount of figures.
B0012FHGCW|5|In the prepper world we call guys like this 'sheeple'.  He had a great plan but he was not prepared for living in the wilderness.  There are people who actually go off into the wilderness by themselves and they are very successful.  This guy had no clue.  The thing that made the biggest impact on me is that he died in the end, something I didn't expect.  He died from eating the wrong plants when he was starving.  His preps consisted of a jar full of rice, he had no real gun, what about the stream next to him, he didn't even go fishing.  He killed some big game but didn't know what to do with it and it all rotted.  He should have spent a year or two hunting, killing, builing shelters, starting fires, learned how to prepare meat for the long term by drying, salting, etc.  He should have had more supplies, more food, a better plan than just living in a bus.  This movie really opened my eyes to being prepared, we should all know this stuff just in case we find ourselves lost in the wilderness!
0061122416|4|In \\"The Alchemist\\" I thought the author's fable about the shepherd boy, Santiago, and his travels were an interesting story. I loved every second of Santiago's search for his treasure by the pyramids and his journey through the desert. The book gave a wonderful insight into a person that is seeking their own destiny and learning from that pursuit. I did have a hard time connecting with the character Fatima. Maybe it was her fate, but I was hoping she would do more that sit around and wait for his return. Overall, Paulo Coelho prose is delightful, and inspirational and direct.
B00821OX98|5|Didn't get involved in this series when it was first launched.  Heard talk about it so I found it on Amazon Prime.  First couple of episodes are a bit slow -- setting the plot and introducing characters.  However, after that I was hooked.  Trying to get caught up so I can watch the current episodes as they are aired.
B00L9B7IKE|5|Loved this book! So hard to put down and kept me guessing throughout. Highly recommend this book and can't wait for more from this author!
B00028HBKC|3|The Bottom Line:    If you enjoy sadistic depictions of pain or feel that Christ's suffering the sentence of any common criminal was more important than his teachings than you may like this film; if you prefer not to see egregious use of slow-motion, ridiculous anachronistic jokes about tables, and 90 minutes of graphic torture than you may not.
B00CL68QVQ|5|I chose it because someone told me it was a very good movie.  It was an adult movie and that is a fact that I like very much.  It told an excellent story.  ie: &#34;A Beautiful Mind&#34;.<br />It had perfect casting.  Each person was excellent in their role.<br />I wish they made more movies like that,
B005FISBTO|2|I enjoy Dexter and the sixth season as on par with the others, but if you want to watch it, don't buy the DVDs.  It is incredibly annoying that every disc has a long list of Showtime ads that come up every time you put a disc in.  You can't skip them, jump to the main menu, or even fast forward.  That is really unacceptable for a product of this price.
0767802519|5|Very good movie.
B004VMUS9G|5|This app is so amazing that I don't even know where to start. You can even use your own music to wake you up. How great is that?! I highly recommend this. I mean at first my friend told me about this app and how awesome it was. I agree with her!!

B00BP4X3W2|5|I want to watch this movie every now-and-then...maybe every four or five years.  I rented this from Amazon.com without any regret, and maybe renting this again in the future.
B009ZQ8FQG|5|Missed this episode and could not continue on with the series with a gap in the story line. So glad that I purchased and didn't miss any of the drama.
B005KJJ4F8|5|I've put off reading this book for a long, long time. I don't know why. I finally picked it up from my local library a few weeks ago and I've already ordered the second book (Scarlet) and am currently devouring it. The plot is original, the girls kick ass and the queen is EVIL and I LOVE IT. I think the pacing could be worked around, a little. Things move too fast or too slow at times, but this book is def. an all time fav
B009CF3MEK|5|Loved this movie in 1974 and it's still great. The color isn't as spectacular as the new version but Jay Gatsby is still cool.
B00L436E7A|2|Meh... The idea is rock solid, but the controls are far too finicky. As I spent 90% of my time just trying to get enough speed for the 360 flip that inevitably turns out to be a depressing pop shove-it. Oh what's that? You want to kickflip that 7stair? Sure you can pop shove-it it, but no, no kickflip for you! And there's the delightful fact that EVERYTHING costs real money. There's zero chance to earn or unlock anything. Just one deck, and one park that gets old, fast.
B004X6PRO6|5|One of the best I've read in a long time, independent of genre. No matter what your preconceived ideas of this novel are by the description, delve in and get messy. It is well worth the trip.
B001FD5KJM|5|I'm not a fan of comic based movies, but Iron man has grown on me. The witty humor and likeable characters are just amazing. Robert Downey Jr. was a perfect fit for Tony Stark. All around great movie. :3
0451196716|5|Of all of the Stephen King novels that I have read, I have to confess that I found The Long Walk to be the most psychologically horrifying. While it is true that the majority of King's body of work has deeply psychological elements (whether exploring multiple personalities or the horror of dealing with poverty in dystopian realities), this book hit home like a punch in the gut. Anyone who has ever suffered will be able to relate to this book in some way or another.<br /><br />The story has been told numerous times in other reviews here, and of course there are hints given on the back of the book. 100 boys are chosen from a pool of volunteers for The Walk, a contest in which only one boy can possibly win. The walk continues until there is only one Walker left.<br /><br />Throughout the story, King follows the perspective of Ray Garraty who, along with his small band of friends, struggles with his own emotions, his hopes, and his feelings of teenaged angst. We learn just enough about Garraty to keep us reading. We know that his father is dead, that he has a girlfriend who he is desperate to see during the Walk and that his mother is afraid of what will happen to him.<br /><br />The story of The Long Walk is the story of psychological, rather than physical, suffering. The first time I read this book I considered it dystopian, but I am now not sure that this genre placement is accurate. Instead of the story being sociological (wherein we see the depravity that often comes from poverty), we are dealing with the thought process that leads up to a boy submitting himself for The Walk.<br /><br />Each boy must endure a series of tests in order to qualify for the walk, and still only very few are chosen. Of those chosen, each has the choice to drop out before the deadline, and yet there are 100 boys at the starting line every year, risking everything for the walk.<br /><br />I don't want to say too much (not that too much hasn't been said in other reviews) because the book does hold some secrets. Anyone who suggests that the ending is predictable or that the entire story can be given in a review without giving it away is a fool. Read the book for yourself, and ask yourself: Would you submit yourself for The Long Walk?e ending is predictable or that the entire story can be given in a review without giving it away is a fool. Read the book for yourself, and ask yourself: Would you submit yourself for The Long Walk?
B00008BLAS|5|I owned this record when it came out as a teenager.  Having also owned &#34;We're an American Band&#34;, I was expecting something similar.  I admit I was a trifle disappointed, since the band seemed to have gone in a different direction, musically.  Well, I was wrong.  They were simply evolving and I think they'd gotten better.  Being considerably older now, I can appreciate the lyrical content to a greater degree.
B00T3DNKIE|5|This book provokes a lot of feelings. Very much a truthful  depiction of the time period. Changes your views about each character.
B000K7VHQ4|5|After watching this movie I made a rare purchase of it.  It's great and has it all.  Emotions, thrills,  humor, tragedy, history, politics, corruption, mystery, and a super ending!  This is not a \\"chick flick\\" though it would work well on a first date.  A boy and girl are childhood friends but as they mature this historical fictional film makes it clear that any potential match is doomed due to the different social and financial strata that exists between them.  They are literally forced to part by her father's \\"men\\".  Years pass and Edward Norton emerges as an mildly successful magician-showman of sorts who sets up his show in this European town (whose important name escapes me right now).  He is more like David Cooperfield than Houdini.  He is intentionally provocative, quick witted and brilliant.  The movie must be seen to be appreciated and to say more might spoil it.  I'm now an Edward Norton fan and I now see why such a fuss is made of Jessica Biel and her beauty.  The classic police inspector is portrayed by Paul Giamatti - he did a very nice job of it.  Some movie titles have so little to do with the story; here, THE ILLUSIONIST is just perfect.<br /><br />Watch this movie and you won't be sorry.<br />Donna
B004T2QZL8|2|As others have pointed out you can combine the same two things over and over.  This doesn't create anything new it just wastes your time and becomes frustrating.  If I have already combined them, just ignore it and do nothing.  Or graphically show me which ones I have combined.  Don't waste my time.<br /><br />To make matters worse, they keep moving things around.  This makes it hard to remember what you have combined.<br /><br />Not much to this game.  Just combine two objects and hope they do something special.  When they do then you try to combine the new thing with other things.  The only nice thing about this are the quotes you get when you combine things.  It gets boring and frustrating after about an hour or so.<br /><br />I tried this app about a year ago and it doesn't seem to have changed.  In fact a new feature is still listed as coming soon.<br /><br />km - 3-20-2012<br /><br />Try other alchemy type apps rather then this.
B003SI605K|5|It was a  beautiful and touching film, it taught me a lot, and made me wonder what my mothers life was like as a young girl.
B005S9EJ14|3|An enjoyable movie.
B008QTVNUI|5|Simply the best thing on television right now. Layered, complex characters combined with superb writing and directing make Homeland must-see-TV

0060531053|5|I love this book and use it offten when brewing or looking for ideas for my next brew
B006LSZECO|4|Very good read. Keeps you guessing till the very end.
B009V5KI98|1|Picture Quality was Horrible Streamed thru my Sony Bluray Player
B009KWU6Q2|3|Not bad, but feels a bit dated and is not bringing out the best in the actors. Captain hook is great but the others so so.
B006UG90RM|5|This is an awesome cd!  David Lee Roth sounds great.  Eddie's playing shows why he ís and will always be King Edward the Ass-Kicker and a guitar legend :). The music sounds fresh and like classic Van Halen at the same time!  It is great to hear a cd that just ROCKS!  GREAT CD!
B0096HIEE2|4|Good movie, great dancing, not as \\"nude\\" as first thought.  Pretty boys.  Didn't really like the ending because of the brother.  You'll have to watch to find out why.
B00IXF8PLU|4|I recommend this movie to anyone who just wants to watch a good movie and kind of learn a bit about history.
B005BGBP3Y|5|I love this movie.
B009UNGYHG|4|I use this to protect my headset while on the road. It's made out of ok plastic, so don't drop it. It charges my headset and keeps it save.

I am a technology journalist and pride myself on providing fair and honest reviews. Please feel free to ask any questions you might have.&#34;
B00E4W40C4|5|I'm gonna start off by saying that this movie is great and I think it's stupid that everyone is complaining about the fact that the unrated version is only on the blu-ray 3D pack. I'll admit it was a bad idea on Fox's part, but the price difference is only $3. If you're complaining about spending an extra $3 then maybe you should'nt be buying a movie to begin with. In my opinion it's worth the extra $3 cuz the movie is great and the unrated version is definately better than the theatrical.<br /><br />Now onto the actual review. Wolverine is my favorite superhero and this is the best movie he's gotten since X2 and much better than his first solo film. It's been about 13 years since the first X-Men and Hugh Jackman looks better now than he did then. Other than being about a foot taller than Wolverine is supposed to be, I think he played the role flawlessly. The film does start to get a little cartoony toward the end, but it's a superhero movie so that's okay. All in all, The Wolverine is definately one of my favorite films of the year.
B00DXLO0D6|4|It started well, the first season was captivating. Unfortunately, in the following seasons an irritating trend developed in that Jeannie started to<br />act as if she were stupid, and landing her master and whoever else was around in the soup. She who was so good at changing reality could<br />not change herself into a modern woman genie, in spite of her professing to want to marry her master.
B000001EIA|3|Gene is everywhere and I'm sick of his face.  I would rather stare at his daughter than him, but he is all about the money, and he says it.  I loved him in the 70's, when it was all about the music and before the departures.  Now it is pathetic.  This is a great CD for the special appearances only.  Stick with old Kiss and the solo albums of Ace and Peter.
B00FAPF5U0|5|I love this game! I'm absolutely addicted to it. I really just wish that they would add more levels faster. I've already beaten them all on my phone!
B006FO3ERQ|4|You expect excellence in language from Ford and this did not disappoint in that respect.  If  you like a thoughtful approach, with a gradual expansion of the narrator's awareness you will like this &#34;coming of age&#34; story.  There is more emotion to the depiction of the landscape and its stark character than there is emotionally satisfying resolution, though.  It is a &#34;cool&#34; toned novel, despite its dramatic opening and events.  I liked it, I would recommend it, but I didn't love it.
B00HGJ18C2|4|Works as described, no problems.
B000X3UJ00|5|I have been a huge Harry Potter fan since 2004. While deployed to Afghanistan I watched the first three movies and read the first four books. My collection now includes all eight movies on both DVD and Bluray, the American version books and the British version of the books. Once I heard that their was the British version with the title Philosopher's Stone it became a must buy. I believe that anyone who has a love for the series should consider adding this to their collection.
B006MW3V6U|5|Outstanding production from every aspect.  Top notch writing, acting, casting, costumes and sets.  Maggie Smith in particular is delightful but the entire cast is remarkable.
B008V8FVTI|5|This was a great movie with an awesome cast, the plot kept you interested throughout, and then to discover it was based on an historical novel.  Worth taking the time to watch!
B005LAJ22Q|5|Must own for fans.
B00C81LYH2|1|I like that you can take her dress off. We have another holiday Barbie and you can't do that. The shoes and earrings don't seem to fit right and are very frustrating for my daughter to play with. Dress is glittery but a very cheap material.
B008602KQI|4|I enjoyed the movie but would not rate it as one of the top 5 movies I have seen.  I look forward to seeing the second one.
B001FB4VXU|5|i can not get enough of lenard , penny raj howard and my favorite sheldon. this is by far in my opinion the best sit com ever i want to own all the seasons and i watch it everyday on tv
B00TU9UFTS|5|Great movie
B0081336FO|5|I had missed the first season by clicking on this show but it was still great.  Later I got the first 2 episodes of season 1 but they also were great.  It is a modern take on the deductive master and his sidekick.  Somehow they make a very unlikeable personality someone that others can root for in addtion to Watson.
B008NABUU8|5|Great game!  My grandsons enjoy it, and so do I.  There is a lot of thinking involved, and no killing of humans.  It is not violent, yet there are cars and trucks and buses that crash if you do not build your bridge correctly.  Math is also involved; each level has a construction budget.  Different materials are used, so there is some thought required to build safely.  All in all, a wonderful game.
B005KJZDXK|3|I've always enjoyed M. Ward, but never got into She & Him, but when I saw they did a Christmas record, i had to check it out.  Zooey's voice does justice to quite a few of these songs, but her limited range leaves some to be desired.  I really think the arrangements could have been more lavish.  The duets are great!  I did three stars, not because I feel the release is horrible,  but because it could have been more memorable.
B0000296SI|5|I have heard this cd. I like it alot....  i Think my taste in music is changing cuz i use to love all of those boybands but now i know they are nothing like BLINK182.  Blink writes their songs, play instruments, and are  guys who worked for it all. With their cds Buddha, Cheshire Cat, Dude  Ranch, and Emema of the state they deserve credit for their work. Mark,  Travis, and Tom are all good guys and they sing really great. If you like  rock, punk-pop, alternative, you must buy all of their cds.  So i truly  think my TASTE in MUSIC is CHANGING. BLINK 182 RULEZ. THEY ARE ON OF THE  GOOD BANDS OUT IN THE WORLD! KEEP THE BLINK PRIDE ALIVE.

0425098478|1|I was forced to read this, and attend multiple seminars from the Blanchard group.  Our CFO lives by the concepts, and he is running our department into the ground by following them.  The book is mostly fluff and took less than an hour to read. <br /> <br />There is ONE good point that I got from it, and that is when setting goals for people they should be trackable, relevant, and attainable.  I got that message in about 5 minutes though.  The rest anyone should already know -- praise in public and reprimand in private.  No kidding, learned that the first time I got humiliated in grade school. <br /> <br />Skip the book, and polish that resume if you are forced to read it.
B006LSZECO|4|Interesting writing. MAkes me anxious to see the movie and how it is done. Liked the first person narrative. Got better as it developed.
B0016HNOXQ|4|After a decade, Portishead sounds more down to earth then the previous albums. It still has the absolute unique sound of Portishead, but a liitle more mature and less intimate.   The vocals of Beth Gibbons,remain stunning and esoteric, just beautiful.     Conclusion: it's somewhat different and modernized, yet still a little piece of art.
B000VMFDW2|5|A case of where truth beats fiction.  I can't think of any instance in which American determination, value, and skill was more evident than in the Pacific where the marines and army and navy all worked together to achieve, what in retrospect, was a next to impossible task.  It makes me proud to see what they did.
B0031RSA24|5|The God Delusion is one very long but brilliant argument as to why there can be no such thing as God. It says everything that I have ever wanted to say to people when they ask me why I am an atheist. Now when they ask, I simply tell them to read this book and they will know why. Reading Dawkins's arguments and rebuttals of arguments posited by religious organisations and people, it is even more difficult to understand how anyone can believe in God. I was a very strong atheist before reading this book but always tried to be tolerant and understanding of others and their religious beliefs. This book has opened my eyes to the serious consequences of (some) religious beliefs, both at an individual level and on a more global scale. To begin with, I was a little horrified at some of the harsh, critical language used by Dawkins but soon came to realise that he is absolutely right. If you are already an atheist, you will love this book. If you are unsure about the existence of God, please read this book and at least gain a good understanding of the atheist viewpoint so you can make what will hopefully be a sensible decision. Overall, a well-written, well-argued book that will have atheists saying \\"Yes! That's right!\\" and believers in God shaking their heads in disgust (and defiantly ignoring all the unarguable facts against the existence of God).

0440241588|3|This is a terrible book and a great read. Of course I'm biased-I love Grisham's stuff! This is good fun, but it's not his best work. It's as if Grisham is winking while you read, saying, \\"I know it isn't very believable, and I admit I wrote it on vacation in Italy, but you asked me to tell a story, so here you are. What did you expect?\\" At his best, Grisham is wonderful. In The Testament, The Firm, and more recently, The Last Juror, he catches the flavor of a locale and his characters become real people. At other times, however, it's as if we're all kids sitting around the campfire and he's telling one heck of a yarn. This is one of those. It's fun, but it sure ain't literature! Take it for what it's worth. Relax, kick back, and let him take you on an adventure. Then, when you're finished, leave it on the airplane or by the pool for the next person. You've been entertained on a boring flight or enjoyed your cruise, so call it even.
B006OOHYIC|5|In spite of the fact that it takes me multiple tries to solve some of the selections, I find this a very compelling game. I like the music, the colors, and the layout. It holds my interest while being relaxing at the same time. I wish  there were hints which would help in solving those challenges which I'm unable to complete in as timely manner. Those which are given are helpful but not enough to complete the challenge. I have to quit and return later, often several times, to try and master where I'm at.

B0017O1MIM|5|For some, this is a tedious movie.  For the rest of us, this is one of those rare works that can touch you in many ways.  This might be my most beautiful blu ray to look at!  It is visually stunning!  Maurice Jarre's signature Lawrence theme has never sounded better.  I thought my old Laser Disc was the best I would see...the blu ray trounces it!  Bravo to Robert Harris and his team for restoration and preservation of this amazing work.  This is the one to get if you love this work.  If you just want to appreciate the view, get the single disc of the movie.  I love this film...highest recommendation!
0385334176|4|Although not Kurt Vonnegut's best novel, Deadeye Dick is an enlightening, fast-paced, and highly entertaining satrical look at the death of innocence and the randomness of life. Through the plot and the life of the protonagist, Rudy Waltz, we are shown how seemingly random and completely unforseeable events can completely change and/or wreck a person's life. Everything we do, however seemingly trivial, has a consequence. Vonnegut's writing style is as fluid and graceful as ever, with a prose, quick wit, and pace that will keep you reading. His ever-present humor and light touch with weighty subjects is apparent from the very first page. A good read that you will enjoy. If you are new to this author, I would recommend reading something like Cat's Cradle first, but this is a fine novel and recommended for all Vonnegut fans.

B0074D3CAQ|4|Harold Fry is an unlikely champion. He is the every day senior citizen we are likely to pass on the street who has a past that could break your heart and a future full of promise, if only he can get past all his regrets. While describing this story to some friends of mine, I realized the overall idea sounded a bit depressing, but the book is anything but. This is a book of hope, gratitude, repentance and victories. It is worth the read and provides a very insightful perspective on meeting people where they are and not where you would like them to be.
B00005JPY2|3|It's a beautifully filmed, nicely edited, with particular attention to special effects, film that has an uncertain plot and a weird understanding of the world and its audience. It's the kind of movie that no one really understands but appreciates its sincerity and accomplishment. At the end of the day though, it's not a film that I would rewatch or watch the sequel to it. As it is, I'm glad I saw it in IMAX because, as i mentioned above, the film is visually stunning.
B008JFUTUY|5|My wife Judy and I just viewed the Movie 8/11/12 in Royal Oak, MI., feel it is one of the best movies we have ever seen.

I sincerely urge all of you to see this beautiful movie & witness his great music for yourselves.  DVD soon to come.  Definately a 5 Star Product!!
0441003257|4|Terry Pratchet has done it again. He has written another rib-tickling novel, as good as his books about the `Ring-World'. And this time helped by another great British writer, Neal Gaiman, famous for his comic-books and  novels published by DC Comics.<br />The book `Good Omens', is a good way to  analyse the professional career of these authors, because the novel has a  lot of coincidences with their previous works.<br />In the case of Terry  Pratchet, he continues doing spoofs of others books and films. In the  Ring-World  novels, he parodies the fantasy books and in `Good Omens' the  horror ones. In fact, the whole book is a big joke about the Armageddon and  Judgement Day, because the plot is two friends (an angel and a demon)  trying to avoid the End of the World, which will be caused by a  ten-year-old English boy.<br />At the other hand, you can notice the touch of  Neal Gaiman in his continuos references to other books or songs (for  example, `Bohemian Rapsody' of Queen is the song which uses the  Devil to  communicate with his subordinates) and the way the supernatural characters  behave, very far from the traditional point of view.<br />But the book has  flaws too. The final chapter is less funnier and good than the rest of the  novel and a bit too long.

B00005K3NR|5|When did you first decide to stand up for yourself? From the opening scenes Carries is an American classic. There were many talented individuals involved in the creation of this gem. It is a classic film directing achievement. It is a classic literary achievement. To top it off it is also a classic acting achievement. Put all this talent together and you have a movie that set a lasting standard in the history of film. Carrie was directed by the great Brian De Palma in 1976. It was based on the novel Carrie by Stephen King. This was a situation that involved two masters working at the top of their respective games.  A person can say all they want about the film Carrie. If you have watched it you will never forget it. When you watch it now all the terror will return. Anyone that has lived or breathed the culture of the American individual can understand the story. Carrie is an original outsider. She is played with legendary grace by Sissy Spacek. She is confused, misguided, innocent, and ultimately hated. Carrie is essentially pushed by life directly over the edge. This was a theme of many early Stephan King novels that the film captured perfectly. The dissociation of the American teenager. On the surface this is a horror film. The truth is it's actually about life.  In the story Carrie must feel guilt for everything, even what she does not understand. The horrific outcome at the end is symbolic for all the rage a person could ever feel. The point is that no matter how ridiculous, hateful, delusional, or judgmental this world may be: a person can always find the strength to stand up for themselves and make their way. Carrie is very thoughtful film with timeless themes about the eternal struggle of the individual.
B00005JNBQ|4|This a \\"clean\\" movie that anyone can watch with their kids.  True, Napolean is a nerd, but he is a funny one.

B000B8QEZG|5|Not only is this one of Madonna's best album's of her career, it's one of the best album's of it's genre. This is an album Madonna fans & dance music lovers alike, can all enjoy. There is also some sampling going on throughout the record, from ABBA's &#34;Gimme Gimme Gimme&#34; on &#34;Hung Up&#34;, and the Jackson 5 smash &#34;Can U Feel It&#34; on &#34;Sorry.&#34; There's also a throwback sample of Madonna's own hit in &#34;Push&#34;, as well as &#34;Jump.&#34; Now, &#34;Jump&#34; doesn't actually sample anything, but it's a definite throwback to hits & fan favorites like &#34;Express Yourself&#34; &#34;Deeper and Deeper&#34; & &#34;Vogue&#34;, containing similar elements in it's lyrics, rhythm, and bassline, and is strongly influenced by the club sound of the late 80's, early 90's.<br /><br />&#34;Get Together&#34;, &#34;Sorry&#34;, &#34;I Love New York&#34; & &#34;How High&#34; are what I was drawn to immediately. Everyone I know who owns this Album sings &#34;Get Together&#34; in acappella as if to be a radio hit, and goes down on my personal list of faves of Madonna favorites.<br /><br />Oh! and let me just say that the Album Artwork is just divine, her hair colour on this album along with the pink top & shoes are so stylish & hot!<br /><br />I'm keeping this review as short as possible otherwise it will be too lengthy.

B006885FZI|5|After watching \\"Band of Brothers\\" about a hundred times, I had expectations of the same product with a little \\"Flags of Our Fathers\\" mixed in for atmosphere.  A background of a pacific atoll instead of Normandy but otherwise the same kind of narrative of another 'band of brothers' throughout the Japanese campaign in the Pacific.  However in \\"The Pacific\\", the story line splinters as the men go in separate directions during the conflict so it is more like a bunch of mini-movies instead.  And like in Game of thrones, favorite characters die early and often.  What sounds like a criticism really is praise since while the story in the first series may be an exceptional one (where most of the men stayed together throughout most of the main storyline, the sadder, more gloomy stories in \\"The Pacific\\" feel more like the reality of war.

0307576736|5|I started the collection on audiobook during a road trip, and finished it on paper. Listening to a story is a curious experience: you have no idea how long each it is going to last, and so are held in the total control of the writer. And when that writer has the mastery of Alice Munro, the sensation is both alarming and curiously satisfying. The first story, for instance, &#34;Dimensions,&#34; beautifully read by Kimberly Farr, is about an hour long, but it has already taken you round several loops of the roller-coaster within a quarter of that time. A young woman, working as a cleaner in a motel, takes three buses to visit her husband, who is incarcerated in a mental facility. You think the story ends when you discover the terrible events that had placed him there. But no, the tale goes on and on, and now seems to be about the terrible power he still has over her even after she should be free of him. Then it takes another turn, and ends in a surprising moment of accidental grace by an Ontario roadside. Or does it? The story might equally well continue onto the next disc; Munro's best stories are not about moments, but lives -- lives that began before and will continue after the period she chooses to show you.<br /><br />Something similar happens in &#34;Fiction,&#34; which is in two unequal parts. The first shows the breakup of the marriage of a music teacher and her carpenter husband. In the second, many decades later, the woman, now in a very different marriage, finds that part of her first life has been turned into a story by a girl who was one of her pupils back then -- ostensibly fiction, though she knows otherwise. Just as she is reading the story, wondering when the young author is going to hijack the painful truth and take it off in some fictional direction, so we listen to the reading of Munro's story, moving from one possible ending to another -- until we realize that she is saying something important not only about the changes we encounter in life, but about her own art, which feeds off them.<br /><br />Turning to print took away some of the magic. Even reading with the care that Munro demands, each story took less than half the time to get through, and I always knew where I was in the book. It worked best for those stories which take place in a few hours, days, or months, such as &#34;Free Radicals,&#34; about a surprisingly resilient old lady coping with a home invasion, or &#34;Some Women,&#34; about a teenage girl who takes a job as carer for a dying man. The latter gains resonance by being related many years later as a distant memory; long perspective seems an important element in Munro's best work. This was certainly true of the most devastating story of all, &#34;Child's Play,&#34; about two girls who become best friends in summer camp then break off all contact; only at the very end, when one is old and the other dying, do we learn the reason why.<br /><br />But I found it hard to recapture that delicious sense of suspension that I got on audio. This was especially true with the long title story that closes the book, which just seemed meandering and fragmentary. Though there may have been another reason; this story, &#34;Too Much Happiness,&#34; is the only one where Munro goes outside her own place and lifetime, taking a real woman as its protagonist: Sophia Kovalevskaya, a late-nineteenth-century Russian mathematician. I'm afraid I kept thinking of how well Julian Barnes handles this kind of thing (for example, in the collection [[ASIN:1400076501 THE LEMON TABLE]] and his extraordinary [[ASIN:0345806581 LEVELS OF LIFE]]); Munro, though writing well as ever, did not seem fully engaged here. But then her strength is to take the ordinary people of her native Canada, and show how a few extraordinary events may define an entire lifetime and give it meaning.

B0067Q42BY|1|Although I do like Mahjong, having ads in a paid app is just plain WRONG. These developers are getting out of control with the ads, greed, and total disrespect for their customers. I could also do without the cheesy cartoon screens in between each board. Now, as far as the game itself, it is decent, but I find it nearly impossible to overlook the outright disrespect of paying customers by placing ads in this app. Afterall, the main reason people get PAID APPS, is to AVOID ADS.

B004DK5CW4|5|One of Disney's best.  Inspiring.  Historical.  Fascinating all the way through.  The finish could not be better.  But it is one of those you don't want to see end.  One of the best movies I've seen in a good while - twice in the theater - now by owning it.  Any time I need to be uplifted, watching this movie again is a good way to do it.  The horse was fantastic as well as the acting.  It surprised me not to see it winn an award.  Nice to see a  movie you don't have to be ashamed to watch with your grandchildren, for a change.
B008YWY0HK|3|I was excited about this movie because the animation seemed brilliant and cutting-edge & Scottish culture is very colorful & interesting-- so I bought it in HD for $20.  The visuals & computer graphics did not disappoint-- Walt Disney would be awestruck and ecstatic if he could see what the industry can do these days--No doubt. But I believe he would have had the writers work on the storyline a bit more before releasing this to the public.  It was a nice idea -- I'm sure that every mother & daughter would be able to recognize themselves in this tale of Merida and her queen mom-with-nagging-high-expectations.  And, yes, when rifts and disagreements occur as a result of youthful pride and stubborn ego a mother figure can become, at least in the eyes of her daughter, a scary giant bear--who can be threatening & monstrous towards her girl --as well as more protective of her baby than any other natural force in the living world--- I completely get the metaphor and it had so much potential to resonate more with people than it actually did.  But somehow, the metaphor in its beginning is strained and carries little momentum.  There seem to be few apparent parallels between the Queen and her enchanted persona.  Perhaps this could have been fixed by making her more \\"bear-like\\" before the transformation-but it would be difficult to do this and still have her be likable.  So as it stands for most of the film, there is very little to make us believe that the Queen is really inside of this bear-and it's somewhat horrifying to think that her husband is getting ready to slay his wife b/c of mistaken identity.  The story is redeemed in the one scene when Merida believes that she has failed to break the spell that holds her mother captive.  She waits for the bear to transform back to her mother -and she is crushed when it does not occur as she had hoped.  She is humbled and can only hopelessly cling to her mother's side -wishing her back to who she once was.  This scene was masterfully done and rightfully brings the audience to tears.  Almost as fulfilling as the classic scene from \\"Dumbo\\" where his mother reaches thru the bars of the carnival cage with her trunk to be with him as much as she is able to.  C'mon Disney-Pixar -- don't be distracted/overwhelmed by your own visuals-- make sure the story is refined and fleshed out as much as possible before takeoff.

1577314808|5|This book changed the way I view the color red and yellow, among other basic things in life. If you need a wake up call and like a simple read, THIS IS YOUR CALLING.
B00JOT3HQ2|5|This game helps hand-I coordination I would say. It also has fun music you can listen to in game too.
6303148352|5|This movie is spieldbergs greatest masterpiece. While Schindlers List may be his best movie on story, this is far better. The story is very simple and with a movie about dinosaurs rampaging how complex could it be in the  first place? The effect may not be as overwhelming on the small screen, but  considering the power of this movie it shouldnt take long before you are  engulfed in it. This is in no means a classic based on deep and riveting  story line like the above mentioned schindlers list. It is more of a  classic because of the extremely high entertainment factor based of  effects, and the fear that is conveyed from the actors to you. I remember  when this first came out I was about 9 and I saw it 24 times in the  movies(seriously), and it still hasn't lost any of it's magic.
0380018179|5|Anyone who loves a good old romantic saga should read this book.  You go  through so many emotions while reading this book.  I could not put it down  and I cried all the way through it.  Even though I am only 16, I know what  a good book is and this one is great.  Everyone should read this book and  watch the miniseries.
B0094BB4TW|5|Still learning how to maneuver application but very interesting knowing you can stay in touch with people everyday who are far away and can f I.d old long time friend classmates.
B000M341QE|4|Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson and Mark Wahlberg were great.  However, the movie definitely did not end as expected.  Worth the price of pay-per-view.
B007N8RULO|5|Good start game
B00E5Q1HJS|4|Very good
0553386816|5|Different than most of Grisham's work -- but extremely well written.  A great slice of life; the book contains 7 short stories, and although it is set in the same small town as a previous book, none of these stories require any knowledge of any of Grisham's other books.  This would make a great gift for nearly anyone.  My favorite story was \\"The Funny Boy\\" though there is little \\"funny\\" about a man who returns to his hometown in 1984 to die, and is shunned by his family.  It pulls at the heartstrings.  Disclaimer: These are not short stories with a \\"twist\\" at the end -- if you are expecting this, you will be dissappointed.  Rather, they are just well-written, realistic views of southern small-town life.  Enjoy.
B003TSEEDY|5|Looking forward to seeing the movie.  Chbosky tells the story that made reflect into my teenage years and had me comparing.  Great read.
B00AVTMCYW|5|Movie had a good feel to it and was enjoyable to watch.  I felt so bad for Charlie throughout the film.  Emma Watson is beautiful, but she is not so great with hiding her accent.<br /><br />The Good:  Enjoyable movie<br /><br />The Bad:  some of the acting was so-so<br /><br />Overall: Enjoyed it and will watch it again later on..
B000065V42|5|My son is a big fan of this series of movies.  He loves the shrink ray!  This is good clean viewing for a child.
B00IMYSCR4|3|The movie was visually stunning from beginning to end. I'm not sure if I was not in the right mind set to watch it but I was getting annoyed with her acting and I usually love her . It was a good story nit sure if a different actress would have made it better for me.
B0009MAP9A|5|The header says it all I think; this album is seriously heavy, moving, and easily one of the best efforts Dylan ever put to tape. Not an album to groove around, but Dylan song writing at it's best and with a great delivery too....if you only buy one Bob Dylan album, buy this one!
B000002J6H|5|<br />I too am a tad thrown by the Editorial Review. The fact that Stills wrote  <br />Suite: Judy Blues Eyes - in itself - is remarkable. Just that one song, <br />let alone all the rest.  <br /> <br />I can think of many great and wonderfully talented musicians in this <br />world and Stephen Stills is certainly among the best of them. <br /> <br />As much as I love Neil Young - I would say that Stills is the most <br />significant of the bunch. <br />
B0006A9FKA|5|British humor and zombie movies, what more could a geek ask for?  Brilliantly written and wonderfully acted by a couple of guys who know what it takes: write what you know and write what you love.  Aside from zombies (which many of us have spent enough time growing up with to at least FEEL like we know them) everything in this movie feels real.  From the mostly disfunctional relationships to the idiotic reactions of characters to bizarre situations, I think most people can relate.
B0074V33MK|4|An excellent read.
B005G81726|1|I ORDERED THIS ON 31 NOV---AND STILL DON'T HAVE IT.  WHITE CLOUD SAID THEY SENT ANOTHER PRIORITY---AND STILL DON'T HAVE IT.  HOW DO I GET MY MONEY BACK?
B006885LZM|4|It is a great portrail of some horid events in history. Not for the weak stomach. It was done with such realism that I was in awe. While the story follows a few soldiers it didn't exactly show the brotherhood like &#34;Band of Brothers&#34;. The extream violence and lack of character group development are the only reason I cannot give it 5 stars. Kind of made me feel like I was jumping around to much. Maybe that is the way it really was.
0062127241|3|While they write completely differently, one coherently and one idiosyncratically (guess which is which), I found a similarity between this memoir and Neil Young's \\"Waging Heavy Peace\\" - both books fluctuate starkly between being immensely informative/interesting and equally tedious.<br /><br />Mr. Townsend's book is a wealth of information, both personally and historically, and for the most part I enjoyed it. The down side? Oddly, for a man as accomplished and erudite as he, Townsend's open reportage often comes off feeling self-congratulatory - and when writing of others, often feels like name-dropping. Is this his insecurity coming out or am I imagining things? (Don't answer that.)<br /><br />Either way....
B002VPE1B6|5|I loved Star Trek 2009. I really like Avatar. Watched both more times than I have fingers (standard 10). But, and it's always a matter of taste, Avatar is a special effects special, with a good story line, but ST2009 just had great acting, characters, storyline and well, I've been a ST fan since it began in the 60s.
B00I8Q77Y0|5|This is an amazing, challenging game just waiting for you to take your quit rage out on whatever is near.;) I highly recomend this game if you have anger issues and want to have a reason to show it.
B008MG1E4A|5|great book started like all the other Seal team books ive read over the past year or so. I found that i couldnt stop reading and had it done in 2 days. No sleep
B00L23SE52|5|This is movie is very well done. It has a lot of jokes and references only adults will understand, but not crude in nature. Clean and funny for all ages.
0756405890|2|I listened to the audio book while I drive to and from work 30min each way. It's a boring drive so I don't mind boring books but this one was boring and abrasive. There were parts of the book that I liked but for the most part I found it quite boring. Nothing really happens until the very end of the book.<br />The biggest problem with this book is that there is basically no plot. There is a beginning but there is no middle and no end in sight. Really, all it is is a list of events in chronological order until the author thought it was long enough that he had to cut it off. That is not the same as a plot!<br />The other problem with the book is that the main character is too contradictory. He's an arrogant, outgoing, witty, smart-ass who can sell a ketchup Popsicle to a man wearing white gloves but he's shy and clueless around girls? huh? and can't seem to ever have enough money to feed himself either? What?<br />Plus the fact that he's way too overpowered and awesome at every kind of magic, remembers everything, knows everything...<br />Another peeve with this book is that it felt like he spent half the book as a beggar/steet kid with amnesia, talk about cliche and BOOOOOOORRRRRRRIIIIIINNNNNGGGGG.<br />My last annoyance is the authors preoccupation with keeping Kvothe beggar poor the whole book. Is that the best kind of conflict that the author can think of for him to overcome? It's just chapter after chapter of him trying to scrape together enough pennies to pay tuition and eat.<br />Despite the above problems I've decided to give it two stars because I did finish the book and I liked the idea of the magic system, runes, naming, etc. I can't give it more than two though because of the sequel. I don't think I could ever recommend \\"The Wise Man's Fear\\" to anyone. I'd just be too embarrassed because of the preoccupation with sex throughout the second book. Since I can't recommend the sequel I can't recommend this book either. Good going Rothfuss. Your trilogy? series?whatever it is, won't ever become big like Harry Potter because parents won't want their kids reading this stuff.
B00K4APIN0|5|This is the best game I have ever played no doubt.
B00005JKG9|1|Great cast right?  That's why I bought it.    Let me tell you, I've never seen a movie with so much yelling in my entire life.  Now I can handle the f-bomb in most movies but this one went over the top, especially when it's being screamed at you for an hour and a half.  This one ended up on my shortlist of films my wife and I simply couldn't sit through.  Why people are loving it is beyond me.
B0092MKFIY|5|Okay, it's not all happy, but a lot of it is, and it moves my body and it moves my soul. I fell in love with them when I heard them open for AWOLNATION and they were amazing, and the crowd was body to body to see them! And everybody knew all the words to every song (except me! That won't happen again!) I hope they don't end up an overplayed cliche and keep churning out great uplifting, imaginative music for a long time!
B005HED11Y|5|The restoration is great and it looks like a brand new production.  I have been going through them and reliving the 1960-1970s!
B0012DH51Q|4|This is a Digiview bootleg of the original Arrow Entertainment release, the special is wonderful but, typical Digiview, they plaster their name all over the DVD, I love the cover art but they misspelled Max Schreck's name. I wonder if this fell out of copyright because all Digiview product is public domain. I know the original 1922 film is public domain, but is this specific version PD? I don't know, I have every version of this out there (1998 VHS, 2001 DVD, 2006 DVD and now this one). At least Digiview is defunct so they can't rip off anyone else. I know this must be in a legal tangle because of the Type O Negative soundtrack and royalties had to be paid to them, maybe that is the reason Digiview is defunct. Oh well, must be off. Thanks for reading the review.
B00CO8D3G4|5|Love this book. Stop being a victim and victimize somebody for crissake! Just kidding. Srsly, this should be a &#34;go-to&#34; book for people who fear rejection or who are weighed down by inertia. There was a time in this country where we had to fend for ourselves. No govt assistance, no taxes, no credit, etc. you ate what yo killed, literally and figuratively. That time has come again.
0865478007|5|Read it and weep.
B00004ZB9D|5|I just love lenny kravitz, and would buy any material I can find on the internet. <br /> <br />Have you heard the last news :  <br />Alicia Keys and rock star Lenny Kravitz are rumoured to be dating. <br /> <br />The pair dined at a New York restaurant and then headed to a nearby nightspot. <br /> <br />You can read more on &lt;a href=\\"[...]\\">Lenny Kravitz Fan site&lt;/a>
B00FGEOA9M|2|This season Homeland  decide it would be much more interesting to bog the series down in the misadventures of an annoying teenage girl better placed on a bad episode of Gossip Girl.<br />Who needs to see the machinations of the the C.I.A., Brody's occasional appearance, Quinn standing around doing nothing, Saul mumbling something, and Carrie's continuing array of facial ticks to convey I'M CRAZY!<br />All that doesn't matter when Dana can entertain Homeland fans with her crazy teen angst misadventures. Too bad she's been given the flick for season 4. Fans will cry themselves a Dana river for her loss even more so that Daddy couldn't 'hang' around to witness it all.
B006VRDZ44|5|Excellent and riveting first season that leaves you wanting to watch the next episodes.
