B0095PU36M|5|Great
B000BZA7A2|1|This failed for me after 300 miles --- probably because I was using the wrong spark plugs.<br />Not what I expect from Borg Warner.<br />Took $500 of parts, tools, and towing to diagnose where the problem was, because this coil was still sparking weakly (so the ignition appeared to be working fine).
B007M5QFWS|5|This has become the &#34;junk drawer&#34; in my SUV and handles the job perfectly.
B005GLXW7G|5|Perfect fit on our 2011 ford flex, single exhaust (double tip).  Please note installation should be a breeze (four bolts your Flex is already pre-drilled and weld nut prepared for).  However, you will need to jack up your Flex to get plenty of clearance and you will need the proper pry bar to remove your exhaust hangers.  Since I didn't have those things I took it to my local exhaust shop.  They installed it for $40.
B008VUFIG2|5|Love it
B000BRRHZS|5|Works.
B0091YWA22|1|Short lifespan. Had for less than a month, replaced half. Usualy one or two smd leds die then the rest flicker till it all dies
B00OA66IG0|5|AMAZING
B0028NEWCO|5|Very nice pair of glasses!
B002NLTLEK|5|Great price fast shipping
B000WJX6IM|4|Works great.. I'll buy it again.. You'll want something stronger for the wheels, though.
B00P1N8QU2|5|These are excellent towels for the gym and also general cleaning. A great price and fast delivery from this seller.
B0090NB7RS|5|Still going strong, I ride hard in a lot of mud, I would buy this again
B00NWGZ3A6|3|Readings were all over the place on some stuff, doesn't feel sturdy at all so I've been very careful with it. Not sure how long it's going to last. Great for checking batteries though. I will go for a better one when this one breaks.
B006MIXJFM|5|Great item
B005FLZODM|1|The purchase was not u
B00AN5TINW|5|Awesome brake pads and rotors for the price. The only con was that the caliper clips had to be re-bent. They would rub on the rotor after being installed.
B00C7XUBT8|5|It definitely hinges my hood.. 2008 Mazda 3
B00EI6CKVE|5|Exactly as described and shown in picture. Great quality. Easy to use.
B004Y4R0II|5|Fixed my brake pedal assembly.
B0097BC6UU|1|they cracked and busted while putting them on.then when i finally got them glued and managed to get them in the channels of the windows the windows closed on them and busted them again.not happy with them.had to throw them away.
B00BBMD2O2|5|Really nice tail and brake lights they are very bright
B00826OVWW|4|love it
B00IJKH092|1|Could not use it, had to through it out.
B00VGVI6S0|3|Strong smell ..but is good-looking
B007772HG4|4|For hooking a trailer, these should be mandatory for all married couples!
B00HN4CX8I|5|Received part for my 2004 Ford F53/V10 Motorhome, promptly. Was an exact replacement for OEM version, fill cap and top hose/clamp included. Very happy with order delivery and price!
B0045CUNT2|1|The tap in the kit had a reduced diameter threaded end which protruded into the combustion cavity and tore a hole in the piston top, thus ruining the engine.  I can see no need for this reduced section of the tap and it can destroy the piston as it did on my engine.<br />Jim
B004K6JT9I|1|Scam alert as a automotive specialist I can assure you this product will not provide any additional power or fuel efficiency. They offer this product for Mercedes and their ecu cannot be fashded or reprogrammed
B0041TU4BG|1|After installing, all you hear is a whining sound from it. It works but annoying. I just opt to replace it with a different brand. Preimer Gear did and work really well on my mazda 6 04 atx
B001KWGA10|5|USE THE OIL IN MY SUZUKI M109R AND THE RESULTS ARE A VERY CLEAN ENGINE ON THE INTERNAL PARTS AND SHOW LOW WEAR
B00JY079PG|1|We used these twice and they were broke. For that kind of money they should be able to replace. Never again
B007IGTUM8|5|Its amazing...I love it.
B000IYSI0M|5|Fully met my expectations. I'd buy it  again tomorrow if I needed one. AND it was half the price of the local chain auto part store.
B00P2D41OQ|5|Excellent product and it is so bright in the night.  I can see the road and objects surrounding much better when the car is backing up.  No problem with dimensions and fitting at replacing out the old bulbs.  Philips should make more LEDs that are universally compatible to old or new vehicles.
B00SUWSSMM|1|Worked for about 1 week.  Worked off and on after that, constant stuttering and hesitation, tachometer went crazy and never read accurately.  Kinda wish I would have just assumed this was bad instead of replacing this and then the stator, and then the CDI.  It was this piece the whole time.
B00E5OUOCQ|5|I actually accidentally bought the wrong size. I drive a Ford Edge and my windshield measures 32&#34; tall. This shade says 32&#34;, but I didn't realize the fabric around the rings do not have a rigid frame, only the rings are rigid, and those measure about 31.5&#34; I was told by a representative of the company. So mine actually was too loose and is hard to keep on the windshield. And actually, maybe I might have measured the windshield wrong, the tape measurer end might have been too big to fit into the corner where the windshield and the dash meet or something. But either way, I would make sure to use this on windshields SHORTER than 32&#34;. But besides my mistake, the shade itself looks like it's pretty well made. Folds up conveniently to a small size, they include a little carry pouch, but that's not needed because it has a little elastic band you can use to hold it folded after you fold it. So if you're driving a car like a Honda or something, I would recommend this shade. But I can tell you for the Ford Edge it's too small, you should take a look at their Grande' Jumbo II or III.
B001447VB2|5|I bought this because I heard that it's the best,,,, well ,,,, it is. I was using Mothers Mag polish , and that's excellent but with the Flitz  I use less and the shine is fantastic. Amazon has the best price for this product.
B00A740VQM|3|I like the set other than the fact that the one bit that I need the most it slightly to big to fit the screws.
B0041TQU14|5|Great for the price! Replaced OEM exactly on 2014 KIA Soul
B000KE8XXM|5|Sounds amazing!
B00CPL918E|5|I have been using liquimoly oil and fuel treatment products in my e46 330ci for over a decade, and I could not of made a better decision.<br /><br />The oil products were neatly packaged and delivered on time.
B00SNB2I7G|5|I purchased this for my car window. It's easy to apply and sticks well.
B00D1418KI|5|Smaller than what I thought it would be. But that isn't a negative, the compact size makes it easy to carry in the car as it doesn't take up a lot of space. My husband who is a mechanic so this is a pretty cool machine to have on hand. Worked great although we didn't have a tire to inflate we did use it to inflate pool toys. I received this product for a discount in exchange for an honest review.
B0038B7H40|5|Removed the ugly orange OEM BMW side marker lights (they pop right out) and replaced with the clear ones.....installation of the two new ones takes less than two minutes total. The new ones blend in with the car much better than the ORANGE oem ones. Not 100% sure if they are lawful in Iowa; but will wait to see if the cops stop me. Well worth the money in my opinion.
B0010Y9ZU6|5|Go TEXAS!
B00HZSLCL6|5|Worked perfectly on my 2013 F-150 Lariat.  They were easy to install.
B000RTSE70|5|Never knew this product existed. the many times i could have used this over the years<br />Now i have it. Great product
B00DMP2184|4|Awesome
B00W0E4QX6|5|Love the sticker just trying to get the word out of what a piece of sh!t president he really is!
B0001UZUW2|4|Alas, it's also healthier for &#34;my&#34; flies . . .<br /><br />Before the gun arrived, some people were standing at my door, holding it open and gabbing.  Why do they do that, then seem offended when I politely ask them if they were brought up in a stinkin' dang barn?<br /><br />So I had to buy a can of Raid, which weakened the surviving flies enough for me to nearly hit them. The gun works best for the ones bravely clinging to screens, and I practice on those that died, yet are stuck there.  They've been dead long enough to be dried out, no messy entrails remaining, and I rarely miss.<br /><br />For the price, this is better-made than I would have expected.  I think the spring will go first, and make this less efficient at killing anything it would if I aimed right.  It's too bad most flies favor LED screens, since the shooter is strong enough to damage a TV or PC screen.<br /><br />If it weren't for that genuine-looking video from another reviewer, I would suspect this doesn't kill anything.  She's good!<br /><br />Recognizing the potential in a fly gun, I'm pretty sure I'll spend a little more for a better one.  And I give this one four stars, half a star more than my real opinion which is no reflection on design or quality, and a full star to allow for my own failing.
B009M1VO6C|4|the light not look like the picture but it's fine
B004GDQ32G|5|It fit perfect and works. It's all that I asked for.
B003TST8FI|5|Works Great!
B006OHPXOG|5|Got this to replace the original shifter in my '09 Honda Fit Sport.  This knob has a great feel to it and is very well made - highly recommend.
B004GXJ8LE|2|This clear is a 2k (of course) and simply put, it sucks. First-off, it's hard to lay out smooth. Then, it stays soft for WEEKS.  And on top of all that, it's a mother to try and buff out. Orange peel like crazy!  It is the best cheapo clear I've ever used though.  Just remember, this stuf is crap quality, and you can get it from Sherwin-Williams automotive paint stores right now for $56 and the reducer for another $18. Not exactly a steal here on amazon, loL!
B00Z7KIZPA|1|The opening is too small to accommodate larger handbags. I found it to put unnecessary strain on the back to get into a position to place anything in the pouch! OUCH!
B00YML13OU|5|fast shipping.  Great product if you have teens learning to drive.
B00FIY7ISA|5|Nice quality
B00QWSMU5M|5|A+ all around
B00KZC60KC|3|Great lighting ability, very bright. Screws weren't long enough they had. And it doesn't come with a relay switch. And mine seemed used. But great product minus those details.
B00C0ZJ9QO|3|I purchased this kit for my 1981 Honda CM400A and was disappointed that the kit did not contain a Stator gasket, shifter gasket or a kicker gasket. The head gasket was of good quality, which was the main reason I purchased this kit. This must be a kit for a CB400 and should be sold that way, not as a kit for all the bikes listed.
B00294QHXY|4|Perfect factory replacement - tried to go cheap the last time around, and the wipers were noisy. Going back to the OEM part, the noise has gone away.
B000BROHBK|3|These mats are okay - BUT THEY DO NOT FIT THE 2014 BUICK ENCORE AS REPRESENTED TO ME. It was not possible to cut these down to fit my new Buick Encore.  I gave them to friends with a Chevy Suburban, which seems to fit fine.  Very disappointed.
B002FY4G36|3|Needs something done to it, my headlight doesn't look clear and doesn't go very far.....
B00SKYYI2O|5|Perfect fit, took less than five minutes to change.works great
B004P22CIM|5|Fast delivery  great product as advertised
B000GU5PW2|5|Very Nice
B00EA0ZB7I|5|Work great very brite
B00RHP2YPA|5|Worked very well on our UTV.
B00M9NX9MC|5|Fits 2010 Jetta perfectly. Arrived weeks faster than anticipated.
B002M3P828|5|No issues. Traveled over 2000 miles and everything was high and dry!
B00GCS4UPU|5|Very nice keychain. Not bulky. Looks great
B0066RCT4G|5|Perfect replacement for our BMW at a price a fourth the price.
B000MWU3V2|4|Fit my MC Enterprises backrest like a glove and the finish is excellent.  Only complaint is how difficult it it to reach the screw head in relation to where the mounting holes on the backrest.  There is not enough room to fit the sort side of an allen wrench in the screw head. I used a needle nose vice grip to hold the screw head while tightening the locknut. If MC Enterprises could include a special short allen wrench that could solve the issue. Also, don't let the picture fool you, the actual rack does not have the single bars connecting to the back rest nor does it have the bar on ht back resting or mounting to the fender.  If you go to the MC Enterprises website for the parts for the VN900 you will see the correct pictures
B00CH4GYQG|5|delivered on time and fit my scooter great
B00YLZ7C3S|2|too small
B000CQOIV4|5|As advertised, keep under your car seat, might come in handy.
B0002M9UUW|1|Burned out in 1 month.
B007BE7YY8|5|Part fit perfect.
B00VJYYLSI|5|The fit was very good and comfortable. It washed well with no noticeable shrinkage. The only negative if there is one is that; as mentioned before, the material is very thin. This will probably cut it's useful life.
B00UPCHH5Y|5|very good quality
B00OU5LOT2|5|Awesome lights, so bight you can see them during the day. Super easy set up!
B0049U33EM|5|This worked great and fit perfectly. Easy install. Great product and good quality.
B002R0MZ5O|5|Thank you I received my order on time  I save money and time it was very easy to install it looked great on my car I recommend it 100%
B000EVYGZA|5|Great product, use it all the time.
B005ML1S4E|5|LOVE THEM!!! I am a HUGE Transformers Fan but with that aside, these do the job and keep my seat belt from scraping my neck.
B00386Z3RI|5|This is a very nice kit. I installed these on my CJ7, But shortly after I started having massive Death Wobble, My shackle holes were drilled for 1/2&#34; and these were 3/8&#34; so I had alot of play in the front end. Did not work with aftermarket shackles.
B000BZJ9Q0|2|Noted per amazon.com as a &#34;fit.&#34;  Did not.  Returned for correct oxygen sensor.
B00W8ADB1K|5|Fits a 1999 Jeep Cherokee Passenger seat perfectly. Well made and sturdy. I have a long commute to work and this is perfect for all the little things I need while driving to and from work.
B001GG09GW|5|Stick on well, after ran and snow it is still on there. Don't worry about bubbles they will eventual smooth out.
B00V30J86I|1|Cannot fit a lot in it.
B006ZVLVBU|5|Good product, great price, works perfectly.
B0083Y0WL2|1|Within a month it has several leds out and what are left have turned a yellow color.<br /> Not happy with it.
B00062YC2E|4|Bought this back in 2007 for my Triumph Spitfire SU carbs. Here it is in 2015 and it still does it's job.
B00NIZZZ5Y|5|Delivered as promised, fairly priced.  Thanks!
B003PA07DC|2|Strap is very low quality. It will break again. Bad engineering
B00OS9G4F4|5|It was cute
B00M0YWMC8|5|I love them!
B00DRB1SXW|4|Great for our 2013 Beetle TDI.  Guide lines point up, but not a problem
B007VWYEF2|5|pump it up aok
B004DDX3G8|5|Gets dirty fast
B0030G7Y64|1|The refrigerator failed to chill food or to freeze after a full 2 days of running.
B000C5UFK8|5|Fixed PO155 (Bank 2 Sensor 2) on my 2002 Tundra. Fit perfectly because it's the exact same part (Denso is OEM for Toyota)
B00C9O8SV8|5|It's very nice and it looks really beautiful even thou the screws didn't work and I couldn't use the caps that come with.
B00LA4Y6AA|5|Great mats that display my Army service very proudly.
B008BTLB1O|5|Excellent battery, super fast delivery and ready to go right out of the box. No complaints, would buy again for sure!
B000ARPVT8|5|It's a Fram, good quality at a lower cost.
B00FBOW814|5|Excellent one minute fix, just pop open the broken case, put the inner electronics into this case, snap it closed and it works perfectly.  Toyota logo and the FCCID (transmitting frequency) of the old case would not be stamped on this one.  Dealership quoted $179 for a new case plus additional $50 to program their remote, so this $8 purchase was quite a find.
B00HTOB0NG|1|Blew up violently. Louder than any firecracker. These are electrolytic capacitors inside. Because they are wired backwards, the voltage inversion causes them to whine loud then explode. The second one started to go but was disconnected in time.<br />Cannot be wired backwards by end user since the leads are in place already.
B0002SREB8|5|Great tool. Too bad some ATV manufacturers quit using this style of clamps, because the new mushroom type are a huge pain. With this tool and the right clamps, you can take a clamp off and put a new one on in ten seconds.
B00WE1A9UO|5|I would like to thank the people who provided this kit.  It worked perfectly and everything we needed was included.
B0016KA9UO|5|Fixed the problem. Just what I needed.
B001THV9D0|4|OK PRODUCT
B005QW9G0W|5|Exactly what I needed.
B00ELR41BW|5|Great
B005Y1T6VO|5|Great
B000C7Y804|1|This does not fit 2001 BMW 740iL. it just doesn't go in cause it is bigger than the hole its supposed to go in. I will pot a picture comparison between both. total waste of my time. the one on the right with O ring is the one out of the car and the one on the left is what I got from amazon
B00HZTDKZG|5|So far so good. Will update if the thing stops working after a short time.
B005HAYDR4|5|works great !
B0019HYQ9O|5|great brake pads!!!  great stopping power, extremely low dust, and no noise...pads fit perfectly...will definitely buy these pads again.
B0089LOCSI|1|I ordered two (2) Dorman 924-612 Hazard Switches in the end of December 2014 since the turn signals in my car started failing.<br />When I then was replacing the original, it started working while I was wiggling it out, so I threw one of these into my glove compartment (so I could change it on the road if the original would break), and left the other one to my garage, and continued with the original.<br /><br />This week (August 2015) when I was at the cottage (200km away from home) the original broke so that it didn't work at all anymore, so I was glad that I had one spare part (Dorman 924-612 Hazard Switch) in the glove compartment... Too bad that when I installed it, it was not working properly, first I thought that I had myself ordered a wrong part... but when I drove over 200km back home from the cottage without working turn signals, and opened the second Dorman 924-612 Hazard Switch box, I noticed that the other part that I had in my glove compartment was a faulty part.<br /><br />There is 7 metal pins in the original VW part, and the part I had in the glove compartment had only 6 metal pins and one plastic pin (pin #3), and the part I had in my garage also has 7 metal pins, and it &#34;works&#34;. So one of the two parts purchased was faulty (=50% of my order was faulty).<br />As you can see in the attached photos, there's the original between the two Dorman 924-612 Hazard Switches, the Dorman's have the same codes in the boxes, and same codes in the parts, but one of them is invalid and missing one pin (pin #3).<br /><br />I can't really recommend this seller and this part at all, for two reasons:<br />1. One of two items were faulty in a way quality control should have noticed it just by looking at it (and since return policy was only for 30 days, and I didn't need the part until now since the original started working while I was taking it out, I can't even return the piece of garbage now, I guess I should have opened the boxes and carefully looked at the parts before the return policy ended), it was really not that safe journey driving over 300km without working turn signals. People could have died because of the faulty part.<br />2. The blinking frequency of the part that &#34;works&#34; is annoyingly fast, a lot faster than the original, makes you think you have a broken signal bulb somewhere since it's so fast.<br />3. I needed to go purchase a real spare that is reliable and blinks slower than these faulty products.<br /><br />I can give the one part that works (fast) like 2/5, but since the other part did not work at all and was faulty Monday issue from the factory I can only give 1/5, and there's 1 too many.
B001OMVCIC|5|They work great---  just got back from 1000 mile RV trip pulling travel trailer and they made a big improvement in handling, sway stability and leveling the load.
B004WLROZW|5|Works great!
B0024E6ZW2|5|Surprised at the difference in trailer stability using this little step brace. Great construction and easy to adjust and use.
B006D9W5FA|5|Had these for over a year and they work great. Price was right. I thread them onto each tire then go back to the first tire and check it till its at the correct pressure (Checking while the deflator is still on is very helpful). Takes only several minutes to air down.
B000GVAETA|5|Perfect, Looks great & perfect fit to 08 Rd King hardware. More stable ride at highway speed that the larger 22&#34;.
B00KC8OLYQ|5|Part fits just as the original did and functions flawlessly.
B00PU1PVH6|5|I drove to Michigan and back and the sensors registered the temperature and the air pressure on the tires.
B00301CF18|5|worked perfect
B000CFHCYU|5|Good quality axles! You wont be disappointed.
B00KVPNVJ6|3|Works good, a bit awkward and plastic hose fittings not very strong, especially if it tips over.
B00158SFNK|3|The female plug did not match up with my Koolatron cooler. The polarity was reversed and the little tang on the cooler would not allow me to flip it over. It seemed like the female ports were larger diameter than my old one that came with the cooler. Since my cord was malfunctioning I decided to cut it off and replace the RoadPro plug with my old one, reversing the polarity. It seems to work. Will use it on a road trip soon and am hoping this product will last.
B00ARK6ZVQ|5|Fit very well and towing at 70 mph was no problem. Definitely cut down on dirt coming in the back.
B01237AQSS|5|This was delivered today and as soon as my son came home my elderly father had my son set this up, which was very easy to set up! This is big enough for 2 people. My father says that the hammock is so comfortable he is going to sleep in under the stars tonight ! Even for a man in his advanced age of 83. I believe that this is going to be giving us many years of kicking back pleasure. It is also nice that this is portable and comes with its bag attached with it so we many take it on our camping trips with us.  I did receive this Portable Parachute hammock  at a discounted price, to test it and then provide an honest review. I have been a purchaser with Amazon for over 9 years Thank you very much for taking your time to read my review.
B000JZZ6UK|5|Perfect part and at a great price
B00K63OJO4|1|Wasted money. Does not include a chip. Original key cannot be moved over to this plastic casing since the geometry is a tad off.  Complete dud.
B008Y82Q1G|3|I love the pink and that i can strut my Ohio pride all over SC but it covers up my month and year decals. If i lived in NC this would fit perfectly!
B002WRRNFO|5|Great product for locking valuables up in your car. I have two!!!
B00UHVUYYO|5|Just installed in my 2012 Polaris RZR 900 xp yesterday and it sounds amazing!  Awesome quality for the price and super easy install!  Really impressed with the quality!
B000FJQWYO|3|Not great....But cheap...
B001O3M5UA|1|I have a 2002 celica and these lights do not fit the existing mounting bracket or the frame, and will require drilling into the car to attach the mounting brackets provided.  In my opinion, if I have to take a drill to metal, that meets &#34;extensive modification&#34;, unlike what was mentioned in the description. 00 - 02 models have the same mounting bracket, I can't speak for the 03-05 models, however looking at the pictures of the frame I'm not too confident in it fitting those either.
B00CFXW1AM|5|Good product
B002YKEZ5U|5|A bit pricey but well made. I wanted a socket hex that was made in one piece and that's what this is. I needed it to remove the drain and fill plugs on a differential for a 1979 Mercedes 240D. The similar 300D most likely will require the same hex size.
B001ILIQXI|5|OE set, and for a decent price!
B000C83XJA|1|I am a qualified VW mechanic since 1968. I should know how a turn signal switch works, I know why it is not working but I want a replacement unit.  The switch I purchased from Amazon/Standard Motor products, TW33 Turn signal Switch does not cancel from the right turn position, and sometimes on the left turn, the wiring is Good, but the mechanics is poor.[[ASIN:B000C83XJA Standard Motor Products TW33 Turn Signal Switch]]
B001H1O688|5|I bought this for my 2011 F150 XLT Ecoboost. It keeps my mind at ease knowing that no haters can put anything in my gas tank, or jack my gas. Battle Tested, 5 Stars
B0016I8E1M|5|amazing price for the product. very stong
B001PWA0IO|5|Installed this into my 2011 F150 XLT Ecoboost. It was a quick install and has worked perfectly since. I have a cap on my truck so it feels great knowing that my cargo is secure when I lock the truck with the keyless remote. Battle Tested, 5 Stars
B002GG18RU|1|Cheap, not worth it, might as well spend a little more money. These are thin, slide around and don't stay in place.
B00GBNMX4Q|5|Awesome
B00JRE38EA|3|This bulb was too tall to fit in my license plate light holder on my 2015 Ford F-150. They are a couple of mm taller than the original bulb.
B006EH9WUC|2|These disconnects can't take much pressure when tightening to battery post. Approx. in the middle area  between where you clamp to the battery post and  the switch half there is appox. ~1/8  inch of metal .  Care is required during installation.  While tightening my first one it broke in half. A replacement was installed. more carefully.  You need to be careful when installing the battery connections. After installation It's working ok as ground disconnect switch. Additional care is required when removing or installing the battery cable.
B00LB0BB9W|5|Great matt to have in garage or in your trunk. So versatile you can use it for multiple purposes, very comfortable and light to carry around.
B00D6YIVU8|1|They didn't my vehicle....Maybe it's Amazons fault. Who knows.
B00HLM7G0M|5|Very happy with these BRIGHT lights. Came with a well thought out wiring harness that made install a breeze.
B002UCYRZU|1|This product is not working at all. Can not remove any scretch from Lexan plastic.
B007QEVDYA|5|Very good &#34;fit for purpose&#34; item
B003IOITIK|5|worked great !!!!
B00A14H3TG|3|Good basic tool for the price.
B000KSTCGU|1|This tool broke during the second attempt at using it.  Total waste of money.
B00UW09BV2|5|The head lights/parking lights look great and fit nice. I've had many compliments on them.
B00D3298A0|2|With this product it has you select your vehicle to see if these will fit, after selecting my 2014 Fusion, it claimed they would fit, but they did not. The back two fit great, but the driver's side in particular moves around frequently due to the lack of fit and often bunches up or slides to the side. We then tried cutting it down to fit, but no matter how much we try, there is not a good way to shape this for the vehicles unique style without compromising the amount of surface area it covers. I will be throwing them out and purchasing new ones for the driver/passenger sides that are made for my vehicle.
B00RCEJUYO|4|Product is very nice. Thought it would come in a gift box though. Its just in foam.

B00V9EJSMW|5|Much brighter than I expected. The magnet isn't very strong, but the beam of light is fairly epic for 50W.
B00RSOLXFM|5|Exceeded my expectations. My car is totally odor free.
B001UOOY02|4|Like every one else, I found the gaps to be wide and tight in different areas. I also swapped the screw clips to use the stock screws. I retro fitted a set of BiXenon Projection D2S headlights into these. I used a heat gun to soften the glue and separated the lens from the back very easily. They fogged the first time I ran them but haven't had any issues since then. Now my neighbor wants me to do the same thing to his F150.... Nope, not gonna happen for free... LOL
B001FRT34Q|5|great item
B00W2D80TG|4|Do NOT use the foam sponge applicator supplied. It's messy and extremely wasteful! At least 40% of the product stays in the sponge and does NOT transfer to your top. Very wasteful! I found 3 superior ways to apply the black dye. 1). Pour the dye into a separate container and use a paint brush. You have more control around the edges and no waste. 2). Pour the dye into a 4&#34; disposable paint roller pan & use a 4&#34; FOAM paint roller. (Make sure it's a foam roller and not a cloth roller). Both of these 2 processes give you better coverage than the supplied applicator. My PREFERRED way to apply: 3). Use a spray bottle! Either buy a &#34;throw-away&#34; spray bottle or use an empty Windex or household cleaner spray bottle. Be sure to clean it thoroughly! Dilute the dye about 1/2 dye to 1/2 hot water. Mix or shake well. (Diluting the dye will not diminish or effect the desired finish). Use the spray bottle to spray the dye directly to the top. By using the spray bottle, you get better saturation / coverage and no waste. It also applies much faster and evenly with a spray bottle. Be sure to keep a WET cloth handy for over spray and any drips. This dye is water soluble until dry, so wiping away drips while still wet is a snap. As others have recommended, USE RUBBER GLOVES! This product is a permanent dye, and very difficult to get off your hands once dry. I hope my experience with this product will help other with the application process. For everyone who has asked; I used this dye to change the color of my canvas CLOTH TOP from TAN to BLACK!
B00VNBDWPK|5|Perfect fit looks great...low beams
B00KFPDLZQ|5|Product performed as described.
B00DRHL1VU|4|Matched the color of my Benz perfect and fits nice.  Only thing it's a little twisted so when one side is sticked on the other side lifts up.  Hopefully it doesn't fly off
B00NT4P284|5|Look sick. Thanks recon!

B0002MG9TC|5|Nice n sturdy
B007ED84XG|4|This looks adorable on my 2013 Hyundai Tucsan. My brother said it makes my baby look like a character from the disney movie cars. I love it, only thing that kept me from giving it 5 stars was many times ill get off work and the suction cups have came loose and its now laying on my dash. Kinda defeats the purpose. Other than that its made well. It is what it is for what ya pay!
B000I1CCCA|1|Not a precise fit for my oil cap. There is some slack.

B000CH02MW|5|Great product thks will recommend
B00CNX0NGI|3|not really bad, not really good!
B00JRHI1LM|4|I was a bit worried when the package showed up.  The box was completely ripped apart and the mattress was sticking out of the box.  Good thing the mattress was covered in a plastic wrap.  Once the mattress was opened and give it a day or 2 to fully expanded to it's final shape, it was good.  It's a little firm for me but great mattress.
B009CCM6CC|5|fixed my issue for much less than a dealer would charge. The lights are little brighter than stock

B000FQ2278|4|Fit perfect
B00JXOIV64|5|So guys. This is a universal switch. How it works is you plug it into the harness, screw it into the hole, then slowly close the door to set the switch to the correct depth. It's also a good quality one, too. Worked great for my cherokee. I am thinking of ordering a couple more for my back doors so I can wire them into the security system.
B001DR9VHW|2|I only use Wagner brakes in my car. However, these pads were missing the little metal place, they made a lot of noise. I would not recommend these type Wagner pads.

B00CSY1UMS|1|This is a waste of space.  I bought it as someone recommended it for the Sylvania SDVD1332 (bigger portable DVD player.  There are random strings and velcro strips on the thing, but as you can even see in the picture, NOTHING works to secure a laptop-sized device.  So if you're going to actually move your car, the thing is going to just fall into whomever is watching it's lap.  That seems dangerous.  And the stitching was almost completely out on one side so it looks like a cheap piece of garbage.  And the &#34;strips&#34; that are supposed to secure it in a vehicle?  They do not fit around the standard sized headsets in our car, so this was just a complete waste of money.  You're better off using string from your junk drawer.
B004W5TGJU|5|THe tail light lens looks just like the original;  however, the price is much, much less than from the dealer.  One would think that this after market item is original equipment.
B00BFDFDNU|2|The part fit but did not come with the nuts as advertised in the description.  I had to re-use my old nuts.
B00I8IJEDA|5|Worked perfectly; Jeep Wrangler 2014
B0002X520S|3|I went to use this product today and was really disappointed that the bottom of the jar was broken, which I didn't notice until after the return policy date had passed. Yes...I should have inspected the jar more thoroughly, but it's been a busy summer and I just was happy to receive the order and set it aside till I had time to actually use it. Other than that, Obenaufs is a good product. Bummed because I've got a busted container. :-(<br />I would give more stars otherwise.
B00A8M188I|5|these lugs looking stylish on my woman's car! and they sure hold up to abuse of changing wheels still has all their color!
B00B26JDY0|5|Factory part and looks great. Easy install, pay attention to the spacers while tightening the clamp.
B007W51ED8|2|I'm not happy with this product. I'm a tire guy heavy trucks and industrial tires, I can set bids with my Cheetah 5 gallons better than with this one 13 gall, I'll replace the hose (with a bigger ID size) and the nozzle for a straight one.<br />The blast of air on this one is far less than the cheetah 5 gallons.

B00JQWD7L2|4|Cool accent for your ///M. People ask me all the time if this came with the car. Despite what people wrote above, the quality is good for what it costs! For $10 were you expecting something of Hermes quality? I say, go for it!

B00C0YKJ6E|1|when it arrived all the ball bearings had fallen out of 1 of the front wheels, so I had to buy a new front wheel, so my rating<br />is poor

B0011YHOE4|5|2005 Chevy Suburban was blowing hot air out the driver's side vents while passenger side was blowing ice cold.  Found a good DIY video on Youtube and did this fix in about 30 minutes.  Dealer wanted nearly $400 for the job!
B000GHYAYE|3|This is an excellent paint shaker, but it's got some inherent issues.  The springs can and do break.  I was able to replace the one spring that broke on my machine, but I had to purchase the entire set.  At the time, some years ago, the set cost me about $80. The springs are not all the same.  I also had one other problem, a more serious issue which I have yet to resolve.  The shaker, all of sudden, would not work reliably.  I checked the wiring and found that the power cord had become frayed next to the motor where it attaches to the frame assembly.  This occurred near where the power cord enters the motor.  This is an area of high vibration.  My hope is to cut off the bad area and reconnect the wires, but there may not be enough cord for me to work with.  I'm not excited about going into the motor itself and attaching new wires.  Once I get it fixed, if that's possible, I will edit this review.
B008E0V74G|5|Perfect fit... Beware others that are too long for Mercedes C series plate lights
B002M4C9RO|5|Great fit and they work great!

B00IHVJFIM|1|Worked for less than a hour
B0013I5WN8|5|I never tend to write reviews and i guess it depends on what &#34;batch&#34; you would get, however I bought these roughly 7 years ago and one of them just went out. These lasted quite a bit.
B000C9UJ14|3|these were not as pictured, which would have been identical replacements. but ok, it's just a filter. the shape was not identical either. close, but not identical. popped the old ones out and slide the new ones in. they were very tight. they appear to work after putting them in place, but i couldn't get them back out. i'm concerned it will be a struggle, if i can even replace these.
B002R106I6|5|good deal
B001DME50K|5|Very good quality
B00GXHM7UU|5|Quick. On time. Was as advertised.
B00BQS9JUW|5|Love it. Would totally recommend this kit. Great price. It all fit perfectly on my son's 1990 BMW 325i E30. Steering is tight again.
B00P83LR7E|3|Though there were holes in the drivers side mat to attach to the floorboard, there were not knobs to attach the mats to in the 2015 F250 4x4, so the mats slip and slide.  They are useful to keep farm mud out of the truck but don't fit that well with nothing to attach them to.
B003NI6NTS|5|replacement part works just fine. easy to install
B000GZAUQ8|5|These seem legit !!! they are actually exactly the same thing as the old spark plugs I pulled out of my 2003 CRV.
B00ZSNUBDK|5|Just perfect!!!
B0049JEHCK|1|I purchased an entire exhaust assembly from Walker using one of the parts diagrams on their site made specifically for my car.  Little did I know that they don't even offer one of the parts labelled on the diagram, so the assembly didn't even fit right.  What's the point of buying specific assembly parts if you're going to need to cut custom pipe just to get the bloody thing to work?
B00LN3QI1I|1|Bright enough. Ordered 4 total lights. 2 of these spots and 2 same type floods. A junior high student could have machined them better. All 4 lights look like they're from the same factory and all four needed work to be used. Mounts don't fit, wrong bolts, mis-drilled, untapped holes partially filled with powder coat, etc. You get the idea. I wouldn't recommend these to a friend if I wanted to keep that friend as a friend... Don't buy unless you have more time than money.
B0048IY46Q|5|Excellent price and service
B00QMWQOHS|2|They don't stay in place slids all the time

B000C6OL70|5|perfect fit for the John Deere
B007IDMCL2|5|This hat is my favorite hat of all. Super nice. Looks awesome wearing backwards. Definitely recommend.
B000C2EDQS|5|Excellent product.  Fit my intake manifold perfectly on 1998 GMC Sierra.  Much better than the plastic OEM from General Motors that blew out.
B007XE8C74|5|Awesome! Helped me identify the true problem with my van. I needed a new TCM and this tool worked perfect. I should have bought this a long time ago, Amazing value!
B00NANMUN4|4|Pros:<br />-Looks cool<br />-Uses strong adhesive that stays on after washing<br />-Worth what you pay for<br /><br />Cons: Does not PERFECTLY match the size of the OEM emblem, so there's a little space leftover around the top and sides of the decepticon emblem, but I don't think that should sway anyone from purchasing it.
B00KTHXN1M|1|It doesn't work
B0000AYAFE|4|With this emergency key is the second time to try  to get a good product. I don't have installed  yet.
B000CJHMNW|3|It doesn't keep pressure 100% of it's length around the gasket. May be due to design of the 300D only having 4 hold down bolts, but it's a new part and it still leaks.
B00B0C1ICQ|5|Stop and look great, installed on my wife's 06 Jetta tdi, best price I could find for the quality
B00KJLMGYI|5|Worked perfect for my MK1! Installed in minutes with only a flat head screwdriver! Highly recommend!
B00BG07QZA|5|I installed on my 2009 klr650.<br />I'm impressed with the quality.<br />I followed the directions and it fit perfectly.<br />I used the red sealant where directed and it doesn't leak. Sounds good too.
B00BT1H1ME|4|Met all expectations and allowed repair to door lock.
B00MGJ4LZS|5|Love the light and so did my co workers, one has already purchased one after seeing mine.  The only thing that would make it better for me is if was a little taller,  but that is just my preference.  :)
B005UQQARG|4|Good products to protect your CR-V from Winter. Slush mats, that can be trimmed to fit most any small sUV. Needs to be deeper for serious snow or slush, but fine for basic flakes and muddy waters.
B00XZ9PKW6|5|It's a perfect fit, thank you
B000C9SNF8|5|Did the job at half the price of autopart stores
B00CAYFKTU|5|Purchased these bars for my 2012 48 sportster. Very well made, but them were lower than my stock handle bars. I had to return them, and get the chump bars. You can say they are like mini apes. But, I love them because I can findly sit up stright. I did Not have to change any brake lines or cables! I only had some trouble strighting the stock bend & rebending to give me the slack to fit. Overall, I am very happy with the chump bars!
B007TYNE8A|5|Perfect condition when arrived . Fit perfect  no problems thank you
B000HBNV9E|5|Works great.  Sealed up the gasket on my motorcycle crankcase like a charm.
B00T9NWUYS|1|what's up, mini...you usually think things thru... this doesn't protect the sides, which is where people hit you while pulling out from tight spot....which is where every mini is often in when parking -- a tight spot.  And what's your response to the chemical smell reported by the other reviewer? come on  mini customer service...we're counting on you.
B00D8BFJP4|5|Looks great and the large size makes sure no one has to squint to see where I stand.
B003E5TXFG|4|Good product
B00YOC99HU|4|I really liked this product.  You  get 2 of them with suction cups, ta boot.<br />I read the instructions, which were clear enough, but honestly, being picky here, but the shades have 2 sides of which neither were depicted as the one to go on the glass window.<br />The shiny side or plastic-y side goes up against the window.  Which stuck really nicely.<br />Love it.<br />Easy to apply and take down.<br />The part where you fold them up is a bit fuzzy and tricky, but if you play with it, the shades will fold up into the shape you received them in.<br />Overall, great product and very useful.
B00DZ54I7I|5|Excellent product very durable.  I drive a city bus for 8 hrs straight 5 days a week. Really helps my back. I even gave a co-worker one. Thank you for carrying a good product.
B00EP02NHY|1|This sealed battery was leaking through the package upon arrival.

B0095OWE8S|5|Just what I was looking for. Picks up stations just as well as the oem one.
B0022YJ0QM|5|I had no idea which type of cover to get for my 1993 HD Ultra Classic. I reviewed all the covers for days finally deciding on the Mustang. I my biggest concern was that I wanted a cover that fit correctly. I saw where another brand was a form fitted but I was concerned it was going to oversize my led.  I made the right decision going with the Mustang covers.  They are labeled on the under side as to R/L.  I actually had to Google to make sure which was which.  FYI, you determine the side by sitting on the bike.<br /><br />I tried to get one on without warming and I could tell it was going to be difficult.  So I dropped them in the dryer for 5 minutes.  It was the perfect time.  I sat on the couch and put one bag between my legs and pulled the cover on. The logo goes on the back of the lid.<br /><br />So there you have it.  I recommend these covers. NO wrinkles at all.
B004J10HAY|4|Worked great

B0100F7R5K|3|Review upated 9/3/2015 with following comments (original review follows below)<br /><br />I had to come back and update my review here as I experienced problems with the remote that I had ordered and had been using when I wrote the review below.  I give great credit to the vendor as they have worked with me, or are working with me, to resolve the problems that I've had by accepting the now defective unit (the volume up area of the joystick on the remote ceased to function after a few weeks of being on my motorcycle's handlebar) as a return and get me a new one that will resolve this issue.  I appreciate the vendor's efforts and their customer service as they've been nothing but friendly about working with me.  I did get a little frustrated with the manufacturer who I turned to originally, expecting that they'd offer to RMA the device and swap it for me.<br /><br />While the manufacturer eventually headed towards doing an RMA, they also suggested that I would be best to turn back to the seller.  I'd much prefer to not have to go back to the vendor, especially with something that I'd call a manufacturing defect, but I have to admit it is up to the manufacturer to determine how they wish to proceed, and also up to the vendor as to how they want to handle problems.<br /><br />I am again looking forward to getting a replacement unit, but that will take a few weeks to get done.  Meanwhile I'll go back to using the headset directly (the 20S that I was pairing this with).  It may not be as convenient for adjusting the volume while listening to music, or switching the channels while listening to the FM radio, but it does work.<br /><br />Review updated 9/3/2015 - original review follows:<br />I have a couple of observations and recommendations with this device as a few days of usage has lead me to a few issues and some pointers that may help others out.<br /><br />I originally oriented this device similarly to the picture that is shown on the product listing with the joystick on the &#34;front&#34; of the device and the power indicator light at the top.  When I did that, I found myself hitting the buttons too easily which lead to frustrations and actions that I didn't need/want at that point occurring (things like changing radio stations when I didn't intend to).<br /><br />I wound up turning the device &#34;upside down&#34;.  Once I did that I found myself hitting the buttons much less frequently.  On a related note, I also found through trial and error that the buttons weren't doing what the instructions stated they would.  For example, bottom button is supposed to be the equivalent of the Ambient button for Sena 20S users (which I am) except that doesn't seem to be the case, at least not for me.  The bottom button (which is now the top button for me) instead serves to turn the FM radio on (if held in for 2 seconds, give or take) and also serves to advance the FM station to the next preset station when the button is pushed momentarily.<br /><br />I am easily able to use the joystick to flick up or down to lower or raise the volume (reminder, I'm using this device upside down to &#34;up&#34; lowers volume, &#34;down&#34; raises the volume).<br /><br />I have mild frustrations with how this device fits on my Harley Dyna, since it is a little wide and tends to line up in such a way that it blocks my thumb access to the left turn signal and other buttons on my left control cluster.  I find that I have to move my hand a bit to reach my thumb over past the joystick and this remote control to reach the turn signal, horn button, or headlight control.  Additionally, I would note that using this device also means lining up the open end of the remote control so that your clutch handle can be pulled back into the space where this remote control might otherwise block it at.  Think of this device as a bit horseshoe or U shape that has to have the opening of the horseshoe/U aligned with your clutch handle.  If you don't have that sort of alignmentthe thickness of this device may intrude into being able to completely use the clutch (which would be a very bad thing).<br /><br />For me this is a fairly solid 4 star device.  I might use more of a 3.5 star rating if that was possible, but it isn't, and I really do find this device very useful, so I'll stick with the 4 stars.  If you are a user of a Sena headset, then definitely consider this add-on if you can use it.the thickness of this device may intrude into being able to completely use the clutch (which would be a very bad thing).<br /><br />For me this is a fairly solid 4 star device.

B002692308|4|Arrived quickly. The plastic is a bit thinner, but it works.l
B009FU7KHM|5|Great product
B0080HJL7S|5|This is just what I needed for my car! I immediately put the bag in my car and immediately put it to use. I had a few old receipts and papers around the car so I threw them in there. This will definitely help me keep my car litter free. The inside of the bag is made of plastic material so it's waterproof and can be easily washed out in case anything spills inside. The bag may not be able to fit all that much but it does the job. It definitely comes in handy.<br /><br />I have received this product at a promotional price for product review purposes. All opinions are my own and reflect my honest and unbiased opinion.
B00JBI9G7K|2|Looks great.... the left one was wired backwards for high and low beam so had to modify....fit great,Good price only downside was wires<br />crossed

B008PRI07U|5|share on facebook
B00GHT0VDY|4|The lid keeps the odors out pretty well. My unit did not come with Led light, but it's not needed by me. I could not stand throwing butts out the window anymore. Worries about fires as well as the streams and rivers. If I'm gonna smoke, I'm going to at least be responsible for proper disposal.
B0044FPNIG|4|yes
B004ZF4MW8|4|It turned out great and i liked the Lights.
B000EQNST0|2|Thought I'd do the right thing and change everything until checking out the wimpy thin material, decided to re use my 120000 mile parts that were still in pretty decent shape.<br />Looks like they would be fine if you really had to replace your originals<br />They are on the shelf for next time (maybe)
B000WJIVO6|5|Works great and fit perfectly
B002IXNPAY|5|Great price and it fit perfectly.
B0024G49G4|5|Brought the color back to my tractor fenders. They look near new, but took a lot  of hard work. Well worth it.
B000A1794E|5|Great price and a great step (actually bought this pair and an additonal single step)<br />Easy to install on the 97-03 F150 and no adapter brackets needed. I used 1 of the enclosed reinforcement brackets from the AS-500 kit and they are stout. My fat neighbor couldn't get them to budge with his 300+ pounds.
B001UN78H4|5|these dark glasses are great all around: fit, hinges, etc... if you are looking for that Lou Reed look, get these, they are perfect... wear these indoors and watch the reaction of people see how awesome you are, haha...

B011KZE1B2|4|These do snap nicely into the factory openings. Not bad for the money... poor plastic molding for connector lock engagement... had to use a pen drill to make a hole so I could insert a straight pin and create enough tension for connector to stay in place... bought two different switches and both were made same way, so it's a manufacturing issue. But... they're ok if you know what you are doing. Also if these are going into a Tacoma, when you tap into the backlighting... the green goes to solid green on your fog light switch and the black goes to the green with a white stripe that is the rheostat controlled dimming ground...
B008P17RPC|5|Love them and they got here fast
B006TMQNOU|5|Awsone
B001UFQBAM|5|Excellent quality
B0125VTH7I|1|Well the saying is a great one, unfortunately it is impossible to get it transferred onto a laptop top, car, etc. because the letters don't all come off -- this is even after attempting to apply the decal several times.<br /><br />In addition, it is overpriced for the quality of the item.  I was really disappointed!  :o(
B0031M9UQE|5|$70 for new starter or 20 mins and this. You choose. It was easy. This had everything in it. Worked great.
B004UVUDXY|5|Fantastic products.
B000EGZ5FK|4|Great to have.
B008BGOWDQ|5|I bought this to use with a Midland 75-822 CB and I love. Works great, easy to mount and remove from both the helmet and the motorcycle when not needed. I highly recommend.
B004GDT7A6|5|Perfect fit as a replacement for oem parts.
B003PY60J8|5|great product
B000C9PTPU|5|I was very pleased with my order. Fast shipping, the correct part, and a great price. Thank you.
B00WXT57R2|5|Perfect size and color
B008RUIT1W|4|Awesome product, worked as intended
B000IYSKF0|5|Love the price and is very quiet. I save $70 compared to AutoZone. It arrived two days later when you elect two day shipping. Very pleased.
B000CLHC80|4|Easy to install, they work fine
B008OYHSYA|5|fast ship, great product and packaging
B00MVMRPWG|5|Very bright for being so small. These things can be put almost anywhere. Get creative
B0096Q5UFY|5|Great gift for my daughter.
B00BGZ5EKY|5|She has pink wiper blades, so of course she needed a pink FOB!  #dottiedixon
B00UEABUKA|5|Great helmet fits perfectly 1st helmet I bought online.
B000C9QUEO|5|it was the right one  and shipping was fast
B0018DO5PY|4|Excellent product, easy to install and should outlast the original equipment manifold. I would have given it a five star rating if the package had contained all of the intake mounting bolts, but as others have pointed out, it was one bolt short.l
B00G9ARJMC|1|The incorrect blades were included.
B002SYSQWK|4|Makes changing pads so much easier
B000COVXDM|4|they worked perfectly and they were pretty easy to install
B0028JQZ5U|5|Everything I needed in a creeper very comfortable and rolls well.
B00Q8FUAO2|4|This was a b*** to install without instructions plus nothing fit the way it was supposed to so I had to improvise doing the entire thing.. on the bright side after installing I have increased HP, Exhaust sound and better MPG. So i recommend this to people who can figure things out themselves. btw it doesnt come with any mounting hardware so i had to use bolts from the bottom plate of the old intake to mouth this one.
B00JPXT4ZA|4|The first wrap I bought, and I'm very pleased about the product.
B006KMRSU2|5|Incredible performance. I have a 2012 Dodge Journey RT that is now getting more horsepower and better gas mileage. Excellent price and I'll have it for the life of the car, what more could you ask for???
B00B5MGIX0|5|Got this for my girlfriend. Thanks :)
B00IO4EYMY|4|Good value as I usually buy 1 at a time, but this is much cheaper.
B00GSAUHB8|4|Works fine as a standard windshield, as I expected.
B00RPOOO1U|5|Worked very well
B00I8IPD8K|5|My 2013 Jeep Wrangler Sport didn't come with cabin air filters for some reason.  I read about this product on the Wrangler Forum and thought I would give it a try.  Watched a Youtube video on how to install.  Installation was really easy.  Just pull out the glove box, flip up the two clips and place the filters inside with the arrows pointing down.  I know its kind of silly to want a cabin air filter for a Jeep where I frequently take down the top.  But, I figured for just over 8 bucks what's the harm?  For some reason the price on this item fluctuates.  I paid $8.62 but the day I wrote the review the price was over 10 bucks!  I recommend the product, just wait until the price drops.
B0006IX850|5|Solves that problem of getting water in tank with a hose and no shutoff.
B00OBTO520|4|Fits and works as it should.  Time will tell if the quality is as good as OEM.
B0036IA6JI|5|It was great
B000GKD5NI|5|Bought this for my BMW 318I last year fits and does the job well , excellent product at a great price!
B0090DXBEK|5|ok but not nice looking than the original thanks
B008VK5Q46|1|That product did not much the siscription you they refuse to give a refund
B00HB9KC1U|5|Perfect fit and easy installation.
B008XIQ5KA|5|Nice and of good value! Good Prime day buy!
B00FFZU1S6|2|Chain cleaner is good, but the rest is worthless.
B008C00JKG|5|Everything it is suspose to be!!
B008A5GRHM|5|Outstanding product. Made my 05 avy look like new again. Truck is in show room condition inside and out. Never could get plastic to restore till now. Highly recommended to any one. Time consuming to apply, but very worth the effort.
B004J30G7G|2|Good for a half carb rebuild kit. Not a complete kit doesn't come with both jets.
B00512X66M|5|My daughter suffers from Fibromyalgia, I got this for her, she loves it! She had one before on her laptop, the laptop &#34;blew up&#34; and she was sad. I am glad I found this. A must have for every Fibromyalgia sufferer.  Well made, bright colors (even though only black and red)
B00SH1AI2O|5|Love it !!! Works great !!
B00T36BRYU|1|The covers are way to small.
B00ZVJ2T0O|5|Quality materials and construction. They fit my Ford F-150 and I expect they will last a couple years with heavy use. They will definatiley keep my seats clean for when I want to sell, so I am quite happy.
B002KNYN44|4|Nice jacket, fits well. It's really stiff as some of the other reviews said, I've been wearing it for almost 2 months commuting 3 days a week and it still does feel &#34;broken in&#34; yet.
B004LEYIHW|5|Good motor oil
B00BTLEHSK|2|Front seats fit great.  Rear seat cover doesnt fit on so well. Kinda disappointed.
B000C33KRU|5|Fits perfectly! Make sure you enter all of your car's important data to verify proper fitting. Year, make, model, engine and carburetor etc...
B00068OKZ2|5|This product fits a 2004 Mini CooperS (R53) despite Amazon's fit recommendation.  Replacement is simple and it works as expected and is much cheaper than other websites who sell the same product advertised as Mini Cooper specific.
B003G5O9GW|5|WOW, Bright as day at night.
B000OO0W7I|5|Exact fit
B00HVHFV4K|4|Exactly what I needed!
B00802F2US|5|Excellent item good price.
B00C5MGCGW|5|Fit right and wired up very easy.
B00UZYI1UC|5|Item delivered as promised, it was the correct size, has cleared up bad cabin odor almost immediately, longevity pending.
B005JU5YCU|5|These wipers made a huge difference and I would recommend them to anyone.
B0002SQVNA|1|Was leaking when it arrived want my money back
B000EDSSDO|2|Doesn't sit right. You get what you pay for.
B005JD595E|4|Another reviewer mentioned the heavy tire smell. They were not exaggerating. It is very very strong. That being said, it arrived on time, and looked just like pictured. I had to put the tires on and that took a minute. The strap that came with it to attach my kayak is plenty long enough and sturdy. It worked great moving my kayak and maneuvering it up onto my car alone. I have not used it as as chair yet.  I would recommend it to anyone who needs a hand with a heavier kayak. Tires came inflated, fyi.
B00G0P0GHQ|5|Old one came off in pieces and the new one slipped on and is clean and new.  Perfect.
B00895EX7Y|5|Quite pleased with this Headset.  Works great in The Skyhawk.  Love the Boom Microphone.  Did not notice any unusual or significant weight issues while flying.  Fit was good.  I usually wear a Baseball Cap underneath in the Summer.  Sound quality is good, no discernible issues.  My Earmuff came off of one side one time, but I easily reinstalled it...no worries.
B000CONU1K|5|Great fit!!!
B004J6IIIM|1|Incorrect size. Nearly twice the length of the rear disc brake pads as my 04 Mazda 3 pads.  What in the crap?
B00AFO749Q|4|Cute but looks a little cheap of the material.
B0006H93FA|4|I ordered and I think it helped. My issues is that I'm parked in a RV park and can't get the movement needed to help clean the sensors.
B001KQ43B0|5|This is for variable effort steering, code NV7 I believe?  So it was a wrong part and had to return it, but learned a lesson on verifying correct part ordering!
B001UROU08|2|the color fades onto your hands and just leaves your hands ugly looking
B00H7H06JE|4|For the price its amazing I like the front seats for my 2011 Toyota Camry floormats could be better but like I said for the price I'm exceedingly happy it makes my car look nice I love it i would definitely recommend this to a friend
B00Y5GSBB0|1|Does not fit my 2012 honda civic loke it states also need to add a harness kit.
B00ERFGYGI|5|Great!
B00TJJFYLS|5|The goggles that I replaced from england are 35 pounds. plus shipping. These look pretty much the same An awesome deal for the money and no exchange rate
B00P2D3VT2|5|A must upgrade for the heat generated halogen bulbs. I'm glad to find there is a good replacement for all interior bulbs in my car because PHILIPS is just entering these universal LEDs market from 2013 according to its website? My family used to forget to turn off the dome or map lights in the car that drained out the battery juice quite a bit. I have to replace OEM car battery every 3-5 years with its 7 yrs warranty. Really getting tired of draining the battery problem, so I'm thinking these LEDs upgrade could help to reduce using of much battery juice. Not only battery draining issue, the heat from the OEM halogen bulbs seem to be shorten the life of one electronic module that costed me over $200 to replace a new one. Well, I hope these LEDs will save me off a little bit of time and money. I also prefer to use professional or known name product to keep me safe of electric failure and other expense when thing could go wrong.
B0012PP4LC|5|great what i needed .
B000XG8Q0W|3|These seemed to work well for a road trip in a rental car abroad, but I did not put a lot of weight on them, just a few water bottles. You can place them in front or back of a seat to secure plastic shopping bags. They do not seem very sturdy though and may be hazardous to use around children jumping around.  Easy to place and take off. Useful only for seats with pulled up head rests, not bucket seats.  I gave them away abroad after the trip, so I cannot comment on durability.
B00684TAYY|1|Programmed easily. Worked for less than 24hrs. After that the unlock button wouldn't work. Remote still locks car but doesn't unlock. Trash. Not even going to waste my time hassling myself to mail this back for a refund. Keep the $8. Your product is garbage.
B005BNZ1BE|5|perfect fit for my bottles.
B00MI3OXOG|3|Had to return the awning.  The zippered insert panel coupled with my existing awning created too much bulk--thus creating too much stress on my awning motor. It may work adequately for owner's whose awning open & close manually.
B000BJ6ZCM|5|Easy to install. Like the lower profile look. Latch is easy to use.
B001G4Z5J0|4|Love the size . Holds a lot of camping gear behind my jeep . Bolts rusted but I leave this cargo on 24/7 . Nothing alittle spray paint can't fix .
B00MN963JS|5|Very handy for cold weather life. Covered my face pretty well and I get to look cool with the ghost mask on.It’s made from good material, very comfortable
B00PQWN5DQ|5|First of all, the customer service from JACO Superior is beyond phenomenal.  After I bought the gauge, their co-founder personally contacted me by e-mail to ask what I thought of it.  I know it wasn't a robot message because when I responded, he personally wrote back to address my comments. When does that ever happen?  As to the gauge, I bought it because I was tired of inaccurate tire pressure gauges.  I bought a digital gauge thinking it was high tech, but the thing wouldn't give the same pressure reading twice in a row, so I took it back and decided to stay with the tried-and-true technology of an analog gauge.  Of course not all analog gauges are accurate either (e.g. the one I got from Harbor Freight)  but I liked the ad copy about the quality and accuracy of the JACO gauge, so I took a chance.  When it arrived I had just gotten back from having the tires rotated on my SUV and the tire shop had checked the air pressure on all of the tires and recorded it on the work order.  They use Snap-On gauges that cost ten times more than the JACO gauge.  I rechecked the tires using the JACO gauge and got an identical reading to the tire shop, dead on.  Score!  Finally a tire gauge I can trust!  Other features I like are the angled swivel head and the bleeder valve.  The swivel head allows me to see the face of the gauge no matter where the tire valve happens to be, and the angle design allows the gauge to be used on bike tires where a straight gauge won't work because the spokes are in the way. When pressurizing a tire I like to over pressurize it a bit then bleed down to the desired pressure.  That way I only have to connect the air compressor to it once.  The JACO gauge is ideal for this.  I can remove air from the tire by depressing the bleeder valve without removing the gauge from the tire. When the bleeder button is released, the gauge instantly resumes the air pressure reading (unlike the digital gauge I bought that had to be removed from the tire and reset for each new reading).  I may be old school, but I like being able to read an analog gauge.  You know where you stand with an analog.  The only comment I had in responding to the co-founder's e-mail was that my 65-year-old bifocalled eyes found the gauge dial to be a bit small.  It is 1-1/2&#34; diameter.  I suggested that a 2&#34; dial would be easier to read ,yet still compact enough for glove box or tool box storage.  Guess what?  He wrote back to say that they are working on just such a gauge.  It will have a maximum scale reading of 60 psi, perfect for car tires (but not for high pressure bike tires).  That one will be easy to read, even for me.  So I am glad to have the small gauge because I do have a bike to use it on, but I am looking forward to the larger gauge when it comes out.  I plan on getting one of those, too.  They said it will show up on Amazon when it is ready, so stay tuned!new reading).  I may be old school, but I like being able to read an analog gauge.  You know where you stand with an analog.

B001GH1P6E|5|Excellent product. Me and my daughter installed this in a couple of hours in my driveway would recommend to anyone
B000FFY8VC|4|I had a black version of this for years to hold my EZ-Pass, but after I lost one of the suction cups, I needed to replace it.  I bought this off-white one because it was cheaper than the black at the time, and neither is particularly attractive.  Yes, this sometimes falls off the windshield when it's particularly hot or cold; however, it stays on most of the time -- even more reliably than my GPS.  The nice thing about this holder is that you don't have to permanently attach your EZ-Pass using the adhesive method.  When you buy a new car, you simply register the new car with the system and switch over your EZ-Pass.  The only thing I've noticed that has changed in 10 or so years is the flexibility of the suction cups.  The newer version seems stiffer and therefore possibly more prone to falling off.  So far, I haven't had that happen; however, if it does, I'll return to update my review.<br /><br />-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann
B00BVQ5S3Q|1|stop working after 3 weeks
B000IG5PVU|4|Had whistles on the car for two weeks. Only the adhesive strip was on the car after one of the whistles came off from first set..  Put another set on.  Our cars are not without these whistles.  We have seen what they do for over 20 years.  In that time deer and dogs have turned back from road, and just look at our car from side of the road.
B0085IJIPC|5|Worked great.
B003UM7B98|5|Thank you!
B00HVHMFF8|5|These work well since TOYOTA does not offer any other replacement for the 2003 Toyota Tacoma.  Lasts 1 month is the pocked of a guy.  Sticks a bit like you would suppose but the price alternative compared to buying a new cover at $80.00 is worth the thing sticking in my pocket.
B00499ZFZ8|4|As described.  Promptly received
B0035YGLZG|5|works great just what I needed
B008E9110W|4|Worked well for 2002 Jetta license plate illumination.
B000BODVEW|4|Unfortunately did not fit our electric pump but good quality.
B00029XB1Y|3|Works and sticks good but the red looks like it's has a orange color to it.
B00HNMLQAG|3|The plastic bends and warps too easily, but it allowed me to replace a radio and speakers!
B00OI55HSS|4|Love them but was shorted 4 bolts so I can't give them a 5.
B004TCV6QM|1|had to return it because the electrical plug plastic sheath was broken.  Wanted to replace it , but it would have taken a month to get the replacement.  Went local instead!
B00K6976RK|1|don't work and shorts out the system poor buy Defenitaly not compatable with 1157 usa
B005LLLB56|1|Both the instruction on the package and the video from the website matches the original wiper in the Prius which this is supposed to be  the exact replacement of. Except the blade in the package DOES NOT. So the instruction is useless and there is no obvious clue as how to install it. Spent half and hour of trial and taking the connect apart and finally forced it in. I was about to return it.<br /><br />Not sure about the blade, but Trico gets one star for shipping product that does not match their own description. Cause me 30 minute for something that should take 30 seconds.<br /><br />By the way the 19 inch blade I also ordered does not have this problem. It matched exactly the package instructions and the original blade on the car.
B0091FJYES|5|Just what I needed. Got what I expected.  And the delivery was quick.
B007KPX1JU|5|save your money buying replacement items from OEM, these are well built, tough and will last a lifetime.  A little tricky to install but not impossible.
B0009IQZH0|5|These towels are perfect for drying the car.  It takes me two of them to dry my Audi Q3 SUV.
B0026N334O|5|This worked perfectly for my 99' wrangler. My problem turned out to be a bad cam shaft position sensor, however these sensors apparently commonly fail and I'm glad to have it replaced.
B00RCNCBWS|5|Installed on my black F150. They blend right in and look great. No instructions, so test fit before peeling or stick. They fit under the front mirror lip, not on top.
B00TQ07IOQ|1|Not up to expectations.
B000CAYSJ2|5|Oem fit on the 04 kia rio base model 1.6
B00G49DVGG|1|Not good
B0085SMY80|5|BAM !!<br /><br />This seat is super comfortable. It will sit you up a little and forward a little, maybe an inch in both directions. The backrest is easily adjustable and has a nice feel to it.<br /><br />This might be the single best thing I have done for comfort. The stock seat on the FLD is a good seat, but if you want to be solo this is a vast improvement over stock dyna solo seats.
B0002V9IFU|5|Good
B00L1U8CXK|5|It's good quality.
B00JBG8C1S|5|Go beast mode!
B004133BW6|5|Works like original.
B0018YGMZE|5|Great shocks and easy to adjust.
B0013FIMUG|4|02 Grand prix w/3.1 put about 5,000 miles on, works fine.
B00WL64VAQ|5|This plate frame fit perfectly on my car & it should identify me as a Doctor Who fan to other Whovians out there.
B00HED2QYE|5|Works Great!
B001EAQTRI|5|I installed this in my lexus is250 because when I played music and used the cigarette lighter next to it there would be a low level sound. After installing I had no issues. Plus I had no issues with Base or sound. Everything sounds great!
B005N53AM2|5|Love it
B000IG3QNY|1|This item is completely dangerous. The mirror is held on by two stickers. After two weeks in my car the mirror fell out, onto my face, fell to the floor of my car and shattered. Thank God I was sitting with my feet on the seat or I could have slashed my feet to pieces, let alone if it managed to break on my face.
B001FRE1E8|5|working well
B00SY2OLFQ|3|Came verg quick awesome lil key chain the only thing is it wont whistle but still a pretty cool key chain
B00GTXS16M|5|Just what I expected. Fits, looks and feels great
B002BHRXJ6|5|Good selection of fin courses.  Not sure how long the plastic teeth will last.
B0019SVYMK|5|Good product but a little pricey
B00UXKPYQW|4|Not an exact fit, but close enough.  Would have been nice if it was a little longer/taller on the sides by about 1/4 inch, and if it came with instructions.  Put on over the existing one (the new cover would have been too big without it). Have to disassemble the armrest to expose the edge of the existing fabric.  I cut out the existing fabric just outside of the lip on the bottom using a razor blade, leaving in the tacky strip in hopes that it would hold down the new fabric when I installed the new cover (it didn't, oh well).
B0013KB14U|5|After reading many reviews, this one was the best for the price. It is good quality and fit my 2008 Kawasaki mule 610 perfectly. The only adjustment I had to make was to add additional spacers along with longer bolts for the two front attachments....no big deal...about a $2.00 visit to Lowes.
B00A70CLZ0|1|Because I asked if it fits in my car. It said it was the right part but it didn't fit anyone.
B000C8NXAO|5|Fit my '01 Ford excursion perfect!
B00BAZBNGO|3|One bulb only last a day, I complained and seller replace it for free. I guess you get what you pay.
B0034ZVXLS|5|Direct fit and function replacement. Quick delivery.
B00Y85UME2|5|I love then. Well worth the money
B00V5QDIPW|5|I love these guards!  Simple to install and remove to put your drone back in its case for travel.  Great product and great buy.
B000I04Z7Q|5|This really is an amazing product. Very easy install. Quick tip is find an old ac adapter and cut the wire. Then tie the wires together and plug the ac into a port in ur car. Much simpler than fuses.
B000OO0TXK|5|Perfect fit.
B000C14U1W|1|JUNK. Not a real Dorman product. Lasted a week, I went to the local parts store and compared it to their Dorman product. The real DOrman products have &#34;Dorman&#34; etched into them. This one does not. Cheep Junk- beware-
B0009IQZH0|1|Very bad product .. We get same quality in $1.. Totally disappointed.
B00B8B8RS2|5|Good quality.. You can tell this is going to hold and be sturdy
B00BZSDOCM|3|I ordered for a jeep compass - but did not fit my model.
B0010DZZPG|5|It's an effective air filter.  What more is there to say?
B00JVHLS3G|1|Cheap Cheap Cheap!  Should have known this based on the price.  Did not come with groments.  BMW logo is nothing but a sticker that you put in the mount.  I installed it on the hood of my car, drove 5 miles and the logo blew off.  A waste of money unless you want to hang it on your wall.
B00OH0S5Y2|5|great
B002SVHD0O|5|Fixed the problem
B00067Q1RS|5|I am very pleased with how this easily removed left-on tree sap as well as road grime, without damaging the paint and clear coat of my new metallic silver car. (Directions say to spray this on sap, but no sprayer was included. I applied to the included sponge, then to the car in circular motion, wiping off with soft dry towel.) On some spots, I used my thumb nail to scrape away a bit of sap. I would like to find more of the nice sponges it came with because after doing my car once, the sponge was full of debris and useless.
B003G9G4X4|5|It works
B005SB6RSU|5|Exactly what we needed
B009OBW5XQ|5|Works great on my car interior!
B0086JIWKM|5|Got it fast, went on with ease and looks great.
B0013LEZGK|5|Very strong well built, no complaints, worth the money way nicer then my old ones
B004BCDR2G|5|Nice..
B006MX7ZRK|4|It's fits in my car perfectly. After put this cover, my car interier looks good..
B000QAA5QS|2|When I first looked at the gun it looked very well made and it is to a point.I wanted to like this gun I really did, but I DON'T! It's very easy to pinch the web of your hand. At first I thought it was just me but a little while later a co-worker did the same thing.The mandrels are constantly getting stuck in the gun causing you to stop, go get some more  tools out ,disassemble, reassemble a frustrating pain.Also the very nice looking knurled end is too big to get into tight areas.The way the handle pivots with the head makes it awkward again to get into small spaces or against a wall.I use these for a living putting in hundreds of rivets.Overall I'm very disappointed.
B000F3RYGA|5|So issues so far.  I'll need to see how well it holds up.
B00UXX052C|1|To big does not fit nicely on a jeep wrangler 2012, how the back seat should work makes absolutely no sense to me
B001NAUAG0|4|honestly didn't notice any performance gains, but not to worried about it myself. wanted a reusable filter
B003YNJ1NM|5|Good quality brake line. You wont be disappointed.
B00LY78N8E|4|I really like it a lot.  The spots of the 1/2 drive sockets are not big enough to fit the sockets.  But for the most part works really well for the 3/8 sockets.
B00CIMAGB6|5|Well worth the money got it with a 4in lap to make it a slip on and works perfectly nice deeper sound Then 5in tip
B009F10S3Y|1|The adhesive was terrible and I threw it away after 3 days it was hanging down
B0045XRK06|5|A good little when you need it
B00ER1QJNA|5|This was easier to install then I thought it would be. No soldering or splicing. Plugged right in to the existing connection on the van. It even came easier then expected.
B001L1INRO|5|it was a gift
B009OBW29S|5|This is a great wax for my car. Worked amazing, will definitely use again and again
B00EF3SAJQ|3|It's okay, but barely. Knock $15 off the price, and I'd not question it at all.  I drive a 2014 Nissan Sentra (4 door sedan, very small w/ limited cargo capacity).  I wanted something I could put on top of the car to carry longer, larger items that simply will not work in the trunk. The 150 lb limit is important, but  works for me. I really expected it to be more versatile, to fit midsize to small roofs. This BARELY fits the width of my Sentra. It is important that the feet rest on the edges of the roof, close to the door to ensure that the weight is resting on a supported area of the roof. I would not dare put more than 100 lbs on this, given that it is about 3&#34; short on either edge. Measure the width of your roof to be certain that the feet will fit close to the edges. The distance between the outer edges of the feet is 44&#34; when set to the outermost holes. There are 3 sets of holes to allow for more narrow roofs, so it would probably work well for a Mini.  The feet have a rectangular cover to serve as additional protection for the roof, BUT, they don't quite fit. They are just a bit too small, so they will ever be a problem to keep attached. I will have to get a little creative to be sure they stay in place (and don't get lost.). I will have to think about the &#34;gator clips&#34;. I will likely replace that feature with a ratcheting strap. However, this will not be difficult, as these straps attach to the bars by passing the bar through a loop fitted on the bar before attaching the feet.<br /><br />I chose this set mostly because it straps completely around the roof, not just to the edge. I've had a lot of experience carrying such racks on small cars, and know it can be done safely IF I am careful about safety and stability. I do not anticipate needing this often, so I will keep it and deal with my issues. If you intend to use it often and for some large loads, I would probably caution you to pay special attention to the size of your vehicle, and be prepared to return it if you have serious doubts.  If I anticipated using a soft roof bag for luggage or light weights, I would not hesitate to use it, but I'd be careful to put a pad under it to protect my roof.<br /><br />Overall, I am not saying to NOT buy it, just to consider how you intend to use it on your own vehicle. I do not anticipate any real issues for my purposes.ared to return it if you have serious doubts.

B000PTKONY|5|My husband LOVES this thing. We bought this for father's day for him. He has been changing tires by hand for years this has saved time and muscle. He just wondered why we didn't buy it along time ago. Would recommend to anyone to get this even if they only change two tires a year it pays for itself.
B00917KFWQ|5|Nice quality. It was bigger than I thought but it does the job.
B0064IU5FW|1|Does not deliver as promised.  Disappointing.
B00HQZNOQO|4|Fits as expected. Latch a little iffy.
B002XLGR2O|4|A little &#34;lighter&#34;  than expected.  should work for low frequency use.
B000AME4VE|3|Serves it's purpose.  I'm happy with it.
B00IAYRMQ8|5|Does its job. Sz L fits my 08 Victory Vegas 8ball with room to spare even if you have saddlebags on it. Good value to keep your bike clean
B0032C8Y2O|5|Great product, easy installation on the Road King (no fairing issue) However, I rode for a year with the factory oil before changing out to the Screamin' Eagle heavy for oil. Night and day, no bottoming over tracks or driveways aprons. Might as well do the oil while you are there. Rubber side down.
B0009IQXM2|5|Great value for the money!  I will order more!
B00GA3BBBS|5|Works as expected, god quality from Puig.  Was originally concerned that it wouldn't secure as easily as I wanted, but it has performed flawlessly at highway speeds for a couple months. If you are looking for an adjustable deflector and don't want to have to drill into your current windscreen this is a great option.
B007P72248|5|Worked great and excellent price! Would recommend it.
B006B23XF0|5|MY fork are working great now .
B00BCRMAAS|2|Doesn't fit a Mazda 3 as well as I would like but I'm really thinking that is probably the standard fit from all of the covers. It's not a bad buy but not a great one either. It does its job and the material is decent, it's not the most comfy but it keeps dirt off your seats. I will add pictures later today...
B004AFK1HS|5|i so needed it, glad i purchased it
B00F49PQ9C|5|This product works great on my 2014 charger better acceleration awesome sound improve  MPG.
B00Y9HCFSU|4|Did not fit my 99 forester. But I drilled it out and re-tapped to my needed size.  Its a good quality mid-weight shift knob. All things said im very pleased with it
B00AJBM4BI|5|I bought this to work with my Blackberry Z10 and the Torque app, because Torque doesn't work with Bluetooth on Blackberry 10. This adapter works great with my phone.<br /><br />I couldn't get it to work with my dad's Nokia running Windows Mobile though.
B000WEPI4M|5|Great having extra cup holders. Works like a charm.
B0002ILK7M|1|Battery will not start my Harley, I have this exact battery in my one of my bikes now that works fine, I purchased this as a backup. The battery did not come with a full charge and I was ok with that, so I put 2 batters (old and new) on 2 chargers. The next morning, the new battery still did not have enough juice to turn over and start my bike. Will not be buying another one of these, buyer beware.
B000IYK66Q|5|Ok if your looking for the housing that has the 2 holes for the push sensors it is this one! This is the part with the holes drilled out for the sensors but PUSH SENSORS WITH CLIP NOT THREADED ONES!
B000HYL20G|5|Good, strong magnet
B00BGRDN6O|5|Bolted up perfectly. Remember to remove retaining clips for a flush fit
B000E0E6GK|4|Works great.  As described.
B001JT550G|5|Great base antenna! I talk all over the country on 50 watts!!
B000C946DQ|4|fit pretty good but did have to buy a gasket for the end coming off the manifold.
B0055PD3G8|5|VERY GOOD PRODUCT.
B007772I54|1|Tank wouldn't  fit, tried to force it in and it broke. I tried to return it before it broke, but they wanted shipping fees, which meant I'd only get about $4.00 back, so I just kept it and tried to make it work, obviously, it did not.
B00E1SNXEC|4|Fit on my 2006 cobalt ss sc fine . Don't see much difference in stopping so they seem ok.
B000COCU8O|5|Work great.  Good price.<br />I can't blame the headlight bulb for the pain I went through to change them in my 2008 Yukon.  Ouch.  I am impressed with general motors ability to make things difficult.
B007V2D7GY|5|This car shade is very well built and is a very nice fit. It doesn't exactly fit the sides but by leaving a small 1/4&#34; gap on each end, it makes installing the shade much easier. I would buy this shade again and recommend it to everyone.
B0073L7TNU|4|Good
B0085XV9JA|5|Make sure you want a super small trashcan when you order it.  It was cute, but not super functional.  I decided i can't give it a low rating because if I wanted a small trash can it'd been great.  Good quality! #dottiedixon
B00O9H0QIG|5|terrific so far
B000EQ6FI6|4|better stopping power than stock infiniti pads, they appear to be wearing more slowly and they don't dust up as bad.
B00M9N1NM0|5|looks very nice and it i unbelievable how well it works.
B0017KIZSQ|5|Fit perfectly on my CJ7 . love it holds my lights perfectly and it was cheap enough that I saved money and time, not building them myself,
B009SO7RBY|1|Cut is not good. Very stiff.dont like these at all.
B000GBGNO0|4|JFYI - I never give out 5 star reviews, so take that into consideration when reading my review.<br /><br />I own a 2005 Hyundai Elantra GLS (hatchback), and I purchased 2 of the hydraulic arms to replace the old busted ones.<br /><br />Pros: Rather easy installation, especially being that I'm not a car guy.  Opening my hatch is actually easier than it ever has.  Almost opens itself.<br /><br />Cons:  The arms are a bit longer than the OEM version, so the hatch is a bit higher and more difficult to get leverage on to close (I'm 5'5&#34;).  Closing in it self is a bit harder.  I personally don't mind this, but I'm pretty sure my wife will complain about it, because she might have trouble closing it with one hand when taking the groceries out of the car. Guess I’ll have to help her. :/<br /><br />Installation Notes:<br /><br />Find a couple (just in case one breaks or something) good old sturdy broom sticks, or something similar, and use them to hold the hatch open while making the repair. Take out your new hydraulic arms, and put them in an easy place to reach when your ready for them.  Look at the top of one of the old arms that should be still on the car.  There’s a grove, that will allow you to get a flathead screw driver (or something similar) in to pop out the clip that is holding the ball joint in the arms shoulder.  Go ahead and remove it like that.  Once you've got the top remove from the hatch, you need to remove base of the arm from the car's frame.  Take out your socket wrench with the 12 mm socket and remove both of the bolts holding the ball joint to the car.  You could try and take out the arm with out removing the base ball mount, but I realized pretty quickly that would take more time monkeying around than just removing the bolts.  Anyhow, once you take the base out remove the socket from the arms joint, just like you did before.  Now the easy part!  Take the ball joint mount that you just removed and pop it into the bottom of the arm (make sure it's the bottom, you can mess this up), then reattach it to the frame of the car.  Make sure you put it the way you found it, so look old one that should be still on. Now take a pair of pliers and twist the top of the arm to face the ball joint that it will attach to on the hatch. I had to do this to both of my hydraulic arms, because they were not even close to being aligned. Once aligned don't attach to the hatch just yet, I would suggest waiting until you have the other arm’s base installed, then do them together.  Now check the broom sticks and make sure they are still in a holding steady, and fix them if they've shifted. You really don't want a couple hundred pounds falling on your head. Now remove the other arm just like you did the first.  Once both of the arms bottoms (bases) have been installed to the frame of the car, your ready for the last step.<br /><br /> Warning: this step is kind of dangerous you might want to have someone help, plus it won't take more than minute to complete.  Lift up the hatch about 3 in from its original height (with the oem arms), and you should be able to just snap on the arms to the hatch of the car.  Done!
B001RNOHBC|3|ok
B000C9QX50|1|Although this is the part listed for the 2010 Silverado 5.3 liter, it is not.<br />Use ACDelco 24236933 Professional Automatic Transmission Fluid Filter Kit.
B00U0N3XLU|5|Fast service, bright lights.
B00ZB84CDM|5|Easily to instal plug and play working fine
B00JDAZP4E|5|Everything has always been great!<br />I love amazon.
B000CMIG66|2|I bought this belt because the belt tension mark on my cart was off with its very old but looking-fine belt. Installed the new belt and was happy because the mark was good again. But after some drive the mark was off again with the new belt. It looks like this belt expands too much on tension.
B009IFIETM|4|Excellent fit, only difference is that this does not have the heated/defrost sign at the top left edge
B002LEEY1E|5|This plate is of excellent quality and would look good on any car. We have received many compliments - even one from an LSU fan!!!!
B00D77UCU6|5|gauge was great and a great price
B003RYOWH8|1|Very hard to install, to thin they slid on the leather seats,looks nothing like the picture, wrinkles under you when you sit on it<br />I have to constantly straighten them out  Very displeased
B002UC30AS|5|fun
B000E4RXN4|5|Timely delivery and accurate part.
B00N58KQTE|3|Good Lock Set.  I had to remove some metal where latch went through in order to install screws.  No big deal.  After finishing the install, put key in and when I turned the key the plastic on the key just fell apart.  Now I am worried about quality of product.  That is why I couldn't give it 5 stars.
B00LLNTRY0|5|I've only had it for a couple of weeks and it seems to work great. It only took 4 hours to charge and started a completely dead battery without any problems. I like the compact design and that you can charge your electronics with the USB port. Everything goes into a little bag so you don't have to worry about losing parts.
B00EV8VXPI|5|This is a good cover. It has protected my trailer through harsh weather. The price is worth it.
B003ZOFTDG|5|Good product !!
B0028OFV7S|5|Great item

B00UHD4HJA|5|I bought them for my laptop, they're great quality and came super fast!
B005ZWM0R4|5|I did not have &#34;Star Trek magic box that works perfectly all the time&#34; expectations. Even though there are standards in the OBD arena not all vehicles are exactly the same, not all vhicle computers are exactly the same or even gather the same levels of detailed information, and not all manufacturers enable all the same options.<br /><br />I have a 2008 Honda Odyssey Touring minivan. It's on-board computer already displays MPG, instant MPG, trip A and B, and all that good stuff. My reasoning for the USB version of the Scantool is that all I really only wanted to see if there were errors and warnings, like from engine light events. No need to keep the dongle plugged in all the time.<br /><br />I followed the directions. The downloaded software and driver had no viruses at all and it was painless to download. They even have a download for the CD contents, which was not included in my shipment. I normally toss them out anyway. Didn't have to pay for the software/downloads and there were no weird download manager sign-up scams either. Nice and simple download what you want and be done with it.<br /><br />It worked without issues and was quite responsive. Not all of my vehicle sensors are turned on because not everything was available. However, the software dashboard was fully functional. The MPG was accurate and the instant MPG was exactly the same numbers as my van display. The dashboard also had a temperature reading (in F), engine load reading (in %), and hours per gallon of gas. Apparently my van burns half a gallon of gas per hour of idle. Nice to know!<br /><br />The error codes and such worked perfectly as well. Saved me a $140 diagnostic fee. Apparently the engine light on a Honda can come on if your gas cap is not providing the proper venting/vacuum. I reseated my gas cap, saw there were no actual engine problems, and I feel better. The vehicle computer also keeps a history of all the errors it's ever had and how many miles ago the error was. So I got to see the cylinder misfires 47,000 miles ago when Honda did a recall on the programming and fixed it as part of the warranty. No errors since.see the cylinder misfires 47,000 miles ago when Honda did a recall on the programming and fixed it as part of the warranty. No errors since.
B004Q8L894|4|the reflective tape doesn't like to stick to the belt. but the unit works fine
B000MAJL08|5|Love 'em, I got the blue ones - they don't quite match Miata Smurf blue, but it's still a great look.  Not as cool as the factory cloth, but not bad, and a lot more waterproof.
B001OBGLHA|4|Bought this to replace a completely fused up right rear calliper on my 2000 Legacy. Initial impressions out off the box was &#34;wow! remanufactured in the USA! Don't see that much anymore.&#34; Came with all the hardware I needed to replace it including crush washers for the brake hose, and clips for the brake pads, and a nice silver paint coat.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the silver paint coat almost instantly rusted the next day as soon as it was on the car. Clear and sunny all week and it still rusted. The calliper bracket still looks great though. Also when I loosen the brake bleeder valve, brake fluid leaks out from the threads.<br /><br />However, it works great, so I can't complain too much.
B0040CTYBU|5|Work great for any of the clips i needed to replace on my 2004 350z
B00BXUU920|5|this is a great investment,  easy to use, no more guessing, and no more broken rocker arms due to being over torqued!
B0099S68U0|5|Great feel and great wear...
B00E1L72RS|2|Probably keeps out the sun well enough, but I can't figure out how to attach it to the window using these flimsy suction cups!  Until I figure it out, I just sit them in the window and hope they stay.
B00T89EZPU|5|I am going to put the sticker on my car first thing tomorrow. I placed my order on the 16th and it was here on the 20th. NEVER have I ordered something from Amazon and it has came so fast. Stick is thick and seems extremely durable. Came super fast and the envelope even included a very detailed list of instructions. Will possible order another one for my laptop :)
B00KQHJDB4|5|Actual fuses that are good quality. Very nice.
B00VXU9EOY|5|Dark tint, easy to install
B0023VJ3PW|5|I was extremely satisfied!!!
B0051P7DTU|5|Comfortable, well made and no weird stitching internally. Very supple and the gel palm in not annoying at all.<br /><br />They will get hot on a 100+ days, but not so much to stick to your hands.<br /><br />I doubt these will be very good at 40 or below temps, but they are not designed for that either.
B002JFEETW|5|Cool shades!
B00A9T28R0|5|We only used 2 gallons of water for the car and 3 gallons of water for our Chevy Silverado Truck.  Living in drought means you can't waste water washing your car. This product changes it.  It's easy to use and leaves a great shine. We used a sample of this a couple of years ago and loved it.  We ran out and we couldn't find it anywhere.  Finally found it again here.  Hooray!  The stuff really works and is great in drought stricken regions.
B00XNRMKJG|2|These are really cheaply made (very, very thin). If you have a front side window that tapers to a point, these are worthless. I had mine for a week and the fine netting began separating from the perimeter rim. I know they're cheap, but you get what you pay for.
B00QI029G4|5|Hard to get on... But it did go on. My biggest complaint is that it smells like new tires... And it makes my hands smell like that. It went away after 5 days, but that was annoying at first. Feels great on my hands and fits very nicely. Looks just like the picture.
B00J1CO9UA|5|Great fit and it looks nice.
B008GVBM70|5|Works just as described, can't complain.
B000KE2J96|5|I had Saddleman Saddle Blanket covers for 5 years in a GMC Sonoma and loved their longevity.  That's the reason I got these for my Durango and I'm sure I will be just as pleased.  I'm about to order for the 2nd row seats.  Oh, the fit for the front was right on.
B005TFOUFM|5|i use to use mcguires 3 step on my boat...which turns out to be triple the work...  gel gloss worked much better and is only 1 application...  if your gelcoat is bad, better to use mcguires...  if your gelcoat is in good condition then gel gloss works great
B000BYGD4W|5|Its a coil!  It sparks like it wants to!
B00180JD3Q|5|fit as designed. No whining
B003VB2L9S|5|When you're in a situation to need jumper cables, they better be good ones. That's why I bought these. They look so much better than others I've purchased. The first time we needed them, when our old car battery died, they charged the battery quickly. I also appreciated the extra-long cables because we couldn't get very close to the car we were charging from.
B000A0CBAW|5|These air filters are great...they perform on par with k@n and for the fraction of cost...this is the 3rd mustang ive run with one and couldnt be happier
B00651C998|1|Definitely a piece of junk. Just useless. I bought this antenna for my Truck, and my thinking was that since it was flexible and short, I wouldn’t need to remove it every time I went through the car wash. It solves the car wash issue, however, the performance of this antenna is just terrible. I receive less than half the AM and FM stations than I did with the stock antenna. I can get better reception with a wire coat hanger. What a waste of money.
B00W2DKKCQ|5|This is my second set of C&C Worx license plate brackets.  In 2010, I ordered a set for my Subaru Outback, they have lasted thru 5 years of automatic car washes.  Now I have a new Outback and a new set of license plate brackets!!!  They are easy to install, securely mounted and add a touch of class to the Outback. Thanks
B00LL6PK2K|5|The reason I was so interested in getting one of these was due to an incident that I had with my husband. I could tell that the tire pressure in one of his tires was low, but he blew it off, saying that it was just the position of the vehicle (on our driveway incline). The next day, I took it up to the air pumps at our local gas station, and sure enough, he was driving on a tire that was well below the recommended tire pressure.<br /><br />It was shortly after that incident that I began searching for a quality tire gauge that he could keep with him in the glove compartment (and one that I could whip out whenever I thought the tires looked low). The reason I like this one is because it is digital, has a backlight, and is durable. I am known for being Miss Clumsy, so durability is a must.<br /><br />To test this tire gauge's accuracy, I took my husband's car up to the air pumps and checked the pressure. I then corroborated it by using this tire gauge. It was accurate, so I can vouch for that. There are different reading options available, other than PSI, which is pretty neat. After testing the pressure, I forgot to turn it off and luckily for me, it shut off on its own after a certain amount of time. This will help conserve battery life, which I appreciate.<br /><br />Overall, it's a durable, nifty little tool, and I definitely recommend it.
B008AJI7O4|5|I used this to replace the throttle tube on my 1981 Honda CM400A and it fit perfect. I was not able to find a Honda part number for my original tube, so I was very happy that this one worked out. Seems to be of good quality and was as easy to install as any other throttle tube I have messed with.
B00KWEWO3A|5|my wifeloves it
B00142Q3KY|3|I bought these off my GFs prime account. The showed up in a reasonable amount of time but 2 of the flares are deeply scratched & both are scuffed.. The other 2 were wrapped in plastic so they are ok.. I'm thinking about returning these.. Not really impressed for the price to receive these scratched & scared....
B000E7YP82|3|Got this for a 1500 mile family trip.  It worked well for our need, and wore pretty well.  I realized the night before my trip as I was packing that my luggage rack =does not have the cross pieces.  So I only attached it to the side of the rack.  Worked fine this way.  No flapping or movement, even going 85 on the interstates.  I put blankets in plastic bags as other reviews had recommended, and this was good since some water got in from rain.  One of the buckles on the side broke when we first put it on the van, when my 14 year old football-player son yanked on it to tighten it as hard as he could they should have been more sturdy.<br />Not too bad for the price.  I will spend the money and buy a hard-sided carrier next time.
B00CYO17P2|5|these settled my bike just the amount I needed for a more comfortable seat.  I had to make some spacers  to get fender clearance but love them.

B00U85I3ZG|4|Was not trimed good, pocket knife an small file took care of it.  Fit good...
B000BZN7LS|4|A strong long lasting starter for a great price! it even came with roadside assistance from Bosch! The only gripe I had that earned 4 stars instead of 5 was that someone (a Bosch employee?) installed the bolts in upside down! And they are pressed in so I had to hammer them out! What's up with that Bosch?!
B00HFRQA50|5|So far soo good, I've put 300 miles on this new chain and it seems fine. I plan to buy again, and would recommend this chain to anyone. Honda XR650L.

B000C9JV1S|3|Ok I guess
B00V3MVVZM|5|Much classier looking than it looked in the photo.  Arrived in a timely manner and it looks great on my car.  Luv it.  It's hard to be a 49er fan in Washington, so the license plate frame helps shout it out.

B00DUTS2V2|4|Great riding jacket. Vents fairly well, but on the east coast with the humidity, anything over 85F becomes uncomfortable. Jacket broke in really quickly, so comfy to wear in that regards. Reflects the sun pretty well, so not totally bad below 90. Think I may get a Klim mesh coat for summer next year and suffer a little until fall riding kicks in for now. The only thing I don't like is the velcro on the right side neck area grabbing my helmet neck pad unless helmet is on first, or I secure the velcro before donning helmet. Vendor shipped quickly and it was packaged OK. Only thing is my wife got hers later, but it included a really nice Klim hanger, which was not included with this purchase.
B00HB4SEZ6|3|was ok,,drier wasnt the same had to modify the bracket n oring kit was wrong,, none of them were thick enough.  wouldnt order it again,,compressor was same is all
B0080C7HC4|5|Exactly replaced original equipment
B00C4B18JU|5|The product arrived in good shape even though it is large and heavy.  Installation on my 2015 Lexus RX was very easy due to the video Curt has on there website.  Fit was good all the holes were where they should be which made it a no brainer.
B00AM1Y3X2|5|Good oil at a good price
B00TPXO6NA|5|Worked as needed.  Was exactly what I needed.
B0009PI13E|5|Excellent product, fairly easy to install for anyone handy with tools.  Just takes time more than anything.  Would buy again.
B006C52KLE|4|Very nice looking front...but the backside is black rubber
B000CMD5BM|2|Said it would fit my car... Does not fit.
B006I442FG|5|Not fit my 78 trans am
B002OPO2PI|5|Nothing spectacular, but better than the POS the moco uses.
B0038F8SYE|5|Great product. Thanks.
B007KPRDEY|3|Cam bushing needs to be line reamed. I had an incredibly hard time finding a shop to do it. Better off spending the extra coin for the nosecone that positively claims to be ready to go. Or know a good indy shop that has a right side EVO or Shovel case needed for the job. I could not find one in central CT anywhere. Whoda thunk?
B001ILIK3O|5|These helped eliminate the clunking sound coming from my front end. These are also a lot more beefy than the stock ones and come with grease fittings. I feel these are the best option out there.
B00T4GX9OA|1|Didn't come with the bulbs!  Where r my bulbs.
B00G1Y2HU0|5|Fit and mounted perfect on my 2006 fz6. They was also delivered pretty fast for only having the option of standard. Will deff. Return in the future with more Business.
B00SSX5ILW|4|good order
B004TTS640|4|I appreciate the ability to replace my door handle in 2 days for a reasonable price, but this thing is definitely going to break again. I'll give it a 8 months.
B000C16XLW|5|Perfect
B0032J1KAK|5|this is great .you see everything bigger.you can move it left or right,up or down
B0000AXY5A|4|Emblem is metal but the rest is plastic.
B008UVRF54|4|excellent packaging and a good fit.
B00IYNRT9A|5|2014 Honda Civic Sedan - manual transmission<br /><br />Looks great, easy install, but could use better instructions. Installed in less than 2 hours with the help of another person during the lifting/bolting of hitch to car step. Suggestion: follow the pictures for good reference points on how big to cut holes in plastic underbody and heat shields. Make hole for plastic underbody wide enough for two hands/wrists to fit inside, while seeing what you're connecting. If you have a long socket with magnetic end and/or long extension that will fit easily, then keep hole in plastic the size of the instructions for a nice fit.
B00CIWTFW2|4|This part has nissan on it.
B0031HI0HY|1|Amazon recommended for my 2004 Toyota Corolla. It is not compatible with my vehicle.
B000BOZVW2|5|good product,..clean view , easy install.
B000630GKU|5|WORKED GREAT
B001AZLBAW|5|look good and very light to handle
B00FP0G5EK|5|*******update**********Kensun customer service is working with me to resolve my concern. If you want to buy a product that is backed by the manufacture you can't go wrong with Kensun. They get 5 Star for the customer service alone.  This was easy to install. My problem is that I bought the HID headlights for two new GM trucks and had a problem with both vehicles were the right headlight wouldn't turn on intermittently. Kensun Technical Assistance was very helpful and suggested I try the relay kit. I installed flicker modules and relays in both vehicles and it fixed the concern with the right headlight. Now intermittently I don't have both lights working. I have been stranded once already at night. I love how bright the lights are but sadly I'm going to remove them. This set up doesn't work with a 2011 Silverado or 2013 Sierra.
B004AIHKT2|5|My 07 Dodge Magnum had the shifter locked issue. Could not pull it out of park. With this part and a couple of youtube videos I was able to fix my car in about 20 minutes. Saved me a LOT of money!
B002ESEHF0|5|all good
B002GP456M|5|looks beautiful and everyone knows what it is right off the back and a few people have tryed doing the toe stand hahaha
B000C3ZDEI|5|When I changed all 4 they fit my Sierra 2500 perfectly and totally changed the dynamics of the truck. Slightly bumpier on a flat road but significantly more control and less harshness over bumps and at speed. Have yet to test off-road or with a heavy load. Build quality looks good and the price is right. Hope they last.
B000MD4YKM|1|Leaks constantly. Impossible to keep primed.
B00HESFIJ4|5|I don't know how many tire gauges I've had over the years. Every one of them basically cheap, inconsistent and hard to use. I finally decided to spend a few bucks and get a decent gauge and this one is it. Well made with a quality feel about it. It's about as accurate as you need for cars and bicycles. Check a tire and it holds the pressure until you release it. Just works. Quit fooling around with the other stuff and get the real thing. If you care enough about checking air pressure, you'll appreciate this gauge.
B001DCA24S|5|PERFECT
B00EV4JEEY|5|A very good product, I am in love with it, empire racing ships very well and fast.
B009Y7MJVS|5|holds fast to windshield. can be easily moved to second car.
B000URC0I8|5|Best price for this item
B00KBJ8X0E|5|Very cool sign...looks better in person. Love the vintage feel it gives me.
B001URQU7E|4|Good glove for the money
B0059XCVVO|5|Use a hair dryer before application or it wont stick well. Heat it up then apply! Works great.
B00E5OUOCQ|5|This worked great.  My only regret was that I didn't buy one sooner.
B012E87QHU|5|the words say it all. These are the most funniest magnets for your car. they are made of a very strong magnet so they really stick to the car. I have so many people who want one of these.. Funny thing is. The men love them the most. They are a good size too. Not too big and not too small. I would suggest these magnets to anyone who is tired of the boring old &#34; baby on board' . I received these magnets( you get 3 of them) at a reduced price in exchange for my honest review. I love them
B00BMCIQ42|5|I use these as barn work gloves when the weather is really cold and nasty. They're great. With a liner and hand warmers I can be out in frigid weather all day.
B000EQQM4S|5|Perfect fit!  Watch installing it 1 tooth off!  It will run fine but your timing offset will be way out!
B00P14X6GK|5|Loved it
B00IJ4T7DK|5|This works beautifully and it was easy to install.
B000BRCGNQ|5|Good vent.
B001GRWCXY|5|Great
B000EQ98EE|1|I had to return this product as it leaked.  I replaced it with a Wix brand filter which worked fine.
B00J4P8C66|5|So far so good. The fit and finish looks great.
B013VA0F14|5|So bright and nice quality.<br />Best led ive ever had.<br />In for one!
B001CA6L8M|5|right thing for my suv
B00L2T4RLQ|5|Great Product!
B00NMZ4ODY|5|Great price. Fast shipping. Thanks
B0001WW37U|5|I love this cd organizer it help keep my cds  store neet. The package arrived on time and for the money this is a great buy.
B0075JYPNM|1|This decal was made and shipped by Spladder Inc. It arrived in a regular security envelope with no instructions, no protection, and no sales slip about 5 days later. I would have been fine with all of that though. What I was NOT ok with was that the decal was printed in the wrong font. If it was just about the quote and not about Firefly being one of the most awesome shows ever, maybe I could have used it. But as it is, it's worthless to me. Not even worth the effort to return. I would not recommend ordering this decal from Spladder Inc.
B003YHEI54|5|I work IT at a local Vocational School. I am responsible for 500 iPads and their protective covers. This is the only thing repair the cases with. People in the Auto Mechanic area recommend it to me.
B00J5947ME|5|worked awesome vert easy
B00IABDWLU|5|I love this thing,  I see a difference in both handling and gas mileage.  I drive a 06 expedition.
B0007L70V4|1|Will not fit any stock ford 302 buy a K&N
B007I6Z05Y|5|Great device.  In addition to adding security from battery theft, it also tightens your hood down better.  My hood no longer shakes while riding next to a semi.
B00WDSVEE8|5|These clip-on sunglasses are everything my husband had hoped for.  As he wears a baseball cap while golfing, these clip-on, tip-up sunglasses are perfect.  Since his optometrist recommended polarized lenses, he is even more happy with the product.
B00XPL88NC|5|Used it on my bike and car tires within hours of receiving. Well built, accurate, and easy to use. Enjoying the product already and am looking forward to continue using it.
B000BZEHZ8|5|superb service - will use again
B000VKVXOG|1|Doesnt really filter any thing, still bring all types of weird smells into the cars cabin.
B00AVYGEJG|5|Didn't like the look of the OEM antennae on my Chevy Volt, so I bought The Stubby -and I really like it.  Very easy to install, took 30 seconds!
B00E1ZRTEA|4|Makes the ride more enjoyable when you can stretch your  legs.
B00CXMJAPY|3|One of the tops pulled away but I think it's after I pushed it back on to the bottom part.
B00F0BD0H4|5|Works great
B002QOYS42|5|Harder to find a place to put it and it was to install. Looks great functions very well.
B000C9FNGU|5|Made in USA
B00XZ9ONA6|4|So far product works fine.  Had one problem when I dropped my keys the key fob came open.  After I put it back together the buttons were not working properly.  All of the buttons were opening the trunk.  After re looking at the fob I opened up the fob and saw the battery was not pushed down all the way.  After I pushed the battery back in place and closed the fob up it started working again.  So far it is still working.  If it stops working again I will update this review.<br /><br />Surjit Kumar
B00N4266EK|4|seem ok so far, had to modify bulb socket on bike so ground would touch bulb on metal side instead of plastic at the base.
B00SUNHB7Y|5|I recently purchased this kit (arrived early) and just finished hooking up my buddies cbr600rr. It looks great!  Study up on your local laws so you will be able to have some solid legal standing.  Anyways.. the kit was pretty easy to install, it just took a while to figure out where to attach the lights.  The overall outcome is excellent!  It looks amazing! The kit comes nicely packaged with plenty of splitters and 3 different attachment lengths. More than enough to wire the lights wherever you want. I really can't attest to the durability being as i only got to take the bike on maybe a 10 mile ride. I already had people rolling down their windows to say how nice it looked! ...now I just have to wait till MY cbr is out of the shop so I can put a kit on it. I plan on purchasing at least one more of these kits for my bike and hopefully the neighbors as well. I can't wait to go on a ride with the guys and we will all have kits! Thumbs up and cudos on a great product!
B0006IX850|5|This really works. It makes filling the water tank possible without it &#34;burping&#34; water back at you.
B00J1TK0WE|4|Nice part
B000CF3W7G|5|Worked great
B004J7B8L0|5|This filter fits my 2013 Hyundai Elantra perfectly. I had a little trouble finding my air filter online or locally for a reasonable price. I found some filters for over $20 but I wasn't willing to spend that much. As far as the filter quality, it fits well and seems to be the same build, if not better than the OEM filter in my car.<br /><br />According to the fit guide on Amazon's website this shouldn't fit, but when you look at the Purolator website this is listed to fit.
B00T74VX24|5|Good
B006YHVXJU|5|It was a great experience. Fast shipping. Easy install. And the performance is amazing. I can hear the turbo spool, so impressed ! Very happy
B000C1QOGQ|4|okay
B000EQB0AY|5|excellent quality. Perfect fit and no flawed cables.
B008427D88|5|good
B000XQ9MGE|5|Quick shipping and product is as described.  One week after purchase my son's car battery died.  He used it with excellent results. The instructions on the charger were clear and his car started with the first &#34;jump&#34;.  I checked the battery indicator and it showed no loss of charge.  I am extremely pleased with this product!
B000CSINYU|5|Husband said it fit perfectly.good part
B000NDM9WQ|5|Perfect condition
B00SJXE9R0|5|I love this little fridge. Keeps things nice and cool and the size is just right. Got two co-workers to purchase one.
B00GWFKT26|5|Fit great, great quality!
B004XACFK6|1|Very cheap and not very well constructed. Don't waste your money.
B00P2D46N2|5|Well made and solid product with all accessories provide in the package.  Unfortunately, my rear lamp fixture and car metal body has no much space left in between.  The rear lamp cover fixture is all plastic which not recommends to mount the load resistor due to the heat releasing.  Read the warning caution from load resistor, saying it needs at least one inch space gap of installation.  I think the load resistor could be warm to hot while using the LED.  I can't find any good roomy space to mount the load resistor in the rear of my car.  The safety issue is holding me off.  Otherwise, I still do like this product and give it 5-star recommend to anyone who could find better way to use it.  No luck for me!
B0059XCVVO|5|Used to wrap tired looking shift knob in bmw e60. Looks great and saved me $100 over the cost of a new shift knob. Will buy again
B0054N8NIO|4|Girlfriend loves her new helmet and it fits great!
B009SUJTZK|5|ok
B00GQ3D3HM|5|These were fast to install and work perfect
B00U12BX4Y|5|Perfect fit..exact same as the 18 yr old falling apart original one I had on my '98 S70 GLT.
B00TQ07IOQ|5|Product was exactly as described great purchase!
B00BFDI2GK|5|Replacing my old relay with this new one fixed my problem of my 1999 Honda Accord not starting in hot weather. It has also made a difference with the acceleration so I'm very happy with my purchase.
B00QATFX5C|5|JUST WE NEEDED AND DELIVERED ON TIME GREAT PRODUCT, GOOD SERVICE.
B004BHZR1A|3|Bigger than what u think but still good
B008G3E94Q|5|Was relatively easy to install and did not need adjusting afterwards. Big improvement over original headlight assembly. Quick delivery time and great communication with seller.
B00W6IZ2BQ|5|Great<br />..all i can say ;)
B00SXGWOL6|1|On star will not activate this because it is in my Jeep Wrangler!
B00TGCGZHU|4|I bought this to go along with the V&H fuelpak for a 2011 Ultra Glide. There were 2 bolts, for the outer housing to the bracket, missing from the parts bag. The bag was sealed so it appears they were never there. Not a huge deal but I did have to go to the hardware store and buy the bolts. That's why only 4 stars. I can't tell if this air cleaner has made a difference in performance yet but it seems to have helped with the deceleration popping. I will update this review when I have put more miles on it.
B00XORKK0G|5|Can't beat it for the price . Super bright .
B000066OC7|3|not very firm /flatten rather quickly
B00RW7X0E2|5|Fits my 2003 Saturn View perfectly. I live in the desert so I have not gotten much use out of them, but the few times that I have needed them they worked perfectly. They were simple as can be to install, took half a minute, and seem pretty sturdy. No need to waste money on higher priced wipers, these do everything needed in a wiper.
B000C5627S|5|Bought a set to replace my the ball joints in my Dodge Stealth.  Mitsubishi/Dodge claims you can't get just a ball joint and must buy the whole control arm.  The cheapest I have seen a control arm is around $250.  I completely rebuilt both my front lower control arms for $130 with the Moog ball joints here and a bushing kit purchased elsewhere.<br /><br />I'd recommend these Moogs to anyone with a 3000GT or Stealth looking to replace their ball joints.
B00SMH58RI|5|Nice and bright! There's a pattern for everything, I know it says 16 patterns, but it feels like so many more when you're rolling through them. I didn't have any trouble as described in some of the other reviews, my package was complete. The light definitely seems like it's high quality, it doesn't feel cheaply made. It seriously lit up our entire street. Very pleased. I did receive the light at a promotional price in exchange for my honest review.
B0009IK5VW|2|Too long for my Ford Explorer for the rear. Ended up at advance auto parts to get the correct one
B00MB9KLNO|5|Great fit and looks good! Thanks
B00BXLE7M2|5|appears to be well made and should fit my needs exactly.
B000COPC9S|5|This is great oil and if you have an older classic car with solid lifters this is an excellent choice.  Has the ZDDP additive that the lifters need to prevent damage.  It is a full synthetic oil also.  If you need to buy this oil suggest you check out Walmart who sells this in 5 Quart size for considerably less than elsewhere.
B0071LF4FM|1|I really liked this hand lantern at first. It has two light settings plus a switch to lock the light on. After only using it a few times, the batteries that came with it were dead, so I replaced them. Shortly after that, the light quit staying on, even when locked. Now, after only a few weeks, the bright flashes on for a brief second and then goes out, and the dim light may or may not come on. It doesn't matter if I am using the trigger or the lock, the light does not work. I replaced batteries again but this did not fix the issue. I do not recommend this item.
B00CJ3IUI0|5|Worked great
B0058WXNOK|5|As described
B00N34H6Z2|5|Great product, fast delivery.
B00KMKS4EC|5|Best magnet light EVER!
B004NFXA7I|5|I use this product on my shower doors. It works wonders for reducing water spots and soap residue
B0068MTQU4|5|works as advertised.
B00FJDL0J8|3|I like chemical guys and have many of their products. But this seems to go on nice but starts to run and streak in the sunlight leaving lines. One rain and it's almost gone.
B00JF9IJ7I|5|I've had this for months now with no problems. Installed right to my van using the existing screws/holes and looks awesome. Some people complain the picture &#34;looks&#34; white when it's actually grey but that's the color it should be, it would look weird if it was white IMO.
B00563JQ9C|5|Just what I hoped I would get. Worked great!
B001F9YBPA|5|True to size & comfortable cut. Great value & better fit and equal quality of Most other brands.
B000COCXHC|5|exact replacement, just do not last too long. not sure any do...
B00RFUS6TU|5|These badges really make the car 'pop'.  Definitely need to clean the application area with rubbing alcohol to remove any wax/dirt from the area but once applied they look fantastic.  True to the original metal badges of the 70's style challenger's.  Can't ask for more.
B00MYA6AXA|5|Fit well, quickly installed. Seems highly durable.
B009ZC9IP2|5|Cable arrived as promised, fit as expected.
B000VTVSJC|4|No issues
B00F2QPTK8|5|Perfect fit
B00DGB3G4M|5|Fantastic quality. The print quality is sharp and the material of stickers is great for motorbike riders. Plus he set more than I ordered so I shared them with fellow riders of the group I roll with. I will order from here again.
B00WTPY8F2|5|These are much brighter than the stock reverse lights on my 2008 Jeep Wrangler.  The lights arrived on time and are a great improvement.  I plan to replace all the incadescent bulbs in my vehicles.  I have also purchased another model by JDM ASTAR for my 2011 F150 that greatly improved reverse camera visibility at night. Very happy with these and would recommend them to others.
B00IMJXKF8|1|I did not use them.  They looked too big on truck.
B000276B2C|5|Filter as expected--fit perfectly and installed easily. Very pleased and satisfied with purchase and with seller.
B004QHLG4W|5|Great price for this hub.... Haven't had any problems so far... Great deal.
B000M8R0QM|1|In ten minutes, this pump couldn't fill my tire from 28 psi to 40 psi. It shut down and I gave up. I'll keep it around for bicycles.
B00HFLH5LE|5|my power windows are back to normal work fine easy install
B003UT577O|5|What's not to love when you've given your heart to this &#34;greyT&#34; breed!
B00NAQ2S3S|5|My daughter is a Hello Kitty fan, and her boyfriend is a gun enthusiast. This was perfect for them. Very bright colors, well made.
B000GUYT56|5|Very nice rad valve installed it on a 84 cr250 and brought it to life, easy to install
B000CQ20M8|4|works great for my new 2100 carb for my jeep
B004PXWKLA|1|These tire caps are DANGEROUS!!! They come with little black gasket seals in the end of the cap, but they do not seat properly and will get stuck in the actual tire valve releasing all the air in your tire slowly as you drive down the street!  It is a really good thing my low tire light came on before I crashed or just simply walked up to a car with four flat tires!  DO NOT BUY!!
B00IS94K6K|2|Looks good went on easy but if you have a soft top jeep this light mount is in the wrong spot it will make your top flap really bad starting at 30mph and just gets worse... had to cut and lower almost 2&#34; and move the light forward 2&#34; then had to re powder coat the mount..
B000VSYFFW|2|Setup was easy, as advertised. I just wish I had thought to look everything over to make sure there were no defects or damage first. I now have everything in place only to notice a large 1&#34; crack in one of the visors. I'm worried this will allow rain water into my truck, which obviously defeats the purpose.<br /><br />I tried to see if there was an option for partial replacement or even repair, it but it looks like my only options are full replacement or refund. Neither suits me, as the hassle of removing everything would be worse than just dealing with the crack. I'm not sure I want to go back through the process of surface treatment now that I've added the adhesion, etc. The result could very well be worse and more permanent than just attempting to patch the crack. I guess I'll try some glue and/or tape, but I would prefer for the seller/manufacturer to provide a more robust solution for this.<br /><br />Unfortunately leaving a review is my only recourse at this time. Very disappointing.
B00S8K7A66|5|Perfect!  thank you
B000N9VSUY|5|easy install
B00F68GYXI|5|Great product as advertised no surprises.  Installed and fixed my issue.
B009DJRX90|1|We were disappointed in this sale.<br />The left turn signal bulb was burnt out.<br />After we installed it we had to take it out again, go buy a new bulb, reinstall the new bulb.<br />Over two hours getting this done and cost more money.<br />I wouldn't order from them again.
B0016KBSPO|5|This hitch is much better than the adjustable one. The bolts were pre-welded in place to receive this hitch. Had it on in about 20 minutes!
B00JV9GOPG|5|I have no problem with it.....
B0054R7KV6|5|Fit was great
B00KTIVX68|5|Great product
B0083H4SMI|2|Woes as it should but mine lights up green/blue which is the Denali color. I don't remember reading that in the description.
B001B7E0FM|4|when mounted the receiver angled up. not sure if my old machine or product. other than that it as a solid quality piece of equipment.
B001GF2THK|1|Decent windshield fit howver the included 1 inch velcro square doesn't keep it from unrolling when stored. I can't deal with a constantly unfurling 5 foot wide sunshade in my car.
B006X6NHEG|5|It was very easy to install, The price was stupendous. I've never seen these this reasonable. It looks great. The only thing I changed was to add Nyloc nuts instead of the ones provided so that it cannot possibly vibrate loose.
B0040CU00E|5|These are very small so if you are looking for certain spots make sure you measure!!
B002OKMJIK|5|2002 Tundra needed a new headlamp, this worked great
B000IY75KG|5|Everything was as expected
B00BQVVV2I|1|Kit arrived and I was a little disappointed. The wires that go between the two tail lights is not loomed. Just three wires that could get pinched or rub something. I bought some loom and did it myself. Also, the kit does not come with an umbilical cord. The price that I paid, $197, you would think there would be an umbilical cord with it. Very disappointing to go through the whole wiring process and I can't even check to see if they work. I kept it and used it because I was in a pinch and did not have the time to reorder one. If you don't mind paying twice as much and getting half of a kit then this is the one to buy.
9539751047|5|Perfect
B007S0LDME|5|Works great......took care of our rest room odor.
B007WD3VCC|2|Will not fit k5 gsxr 1000. The coils don't grab on to them so it doesn't start and when it does the bikes shuts right off. Asked seller to replace them and seller declined my request since it's been 2 months since purchase. It shouldn't matter when u get to installing them as long as they are correct as advertised. I don't trust this seller anymore.
B009DZW2ZO|5|Really fast service and a good product. Thank you.
B003JOB594|5|arrived early worked well thanks
B000H7CJAK|5|very well made
B00EPXCWKE|5|The table was a birthday present for my sister-in-law.
B00BCRMBSO|2|It doesn't fit as well as I would have expected but I do use it to kinda cover my front seats from the hot seats and the steering wheel. Therefore, I only use the 2 front seat covers and the steering wheel cover. The seatbelt covers gets in the way. The product was okay for the price, but it doesn't really work for my 2007 Benz.
B00ACXISLS|5|This light switch did the trick. Easy install through air conditioning vent. Good product, good price. Very pleased.
B0060KJS7U|1|Not a great fit to begin with. The adhesive on the back held for one day. Had to buy stronger double sided tape at home depot for $9, so the price of this mirrow was over $50! The entire mirror assembly is only $65...
B00029XHZ4|5|Since politicians in America would rather perform one knee jerk reaction after another while turning a blind eye to criminals (unarmed my butt). I decided to pull a knee jerk of my own. Every time I see an &#34;unarmed&#34; thug on the street, I blast these babies.
B00CA5PQMA|5|Item shipped fast and looks and works great like factory direct item will order from them again!
B0015RO3PU|5|Will order again
B007FISJ08|5|Exactly what I needed. Lens were aging and one cracked. Replaced both sides on my 2005 Suburban and the look great. Not to mention they were incredibly easy to install.
B004I0YMXE|5|Great item!
B001Q4VILY|3|Worked pretty good but I hooked to a heavier trailer and went over a hump in my yard, the rear hole was left open and hit the bottom of the tongue bending the hitch.  Not suited for much weight but it is useful in situations.
B004SSAFDC|4|Great fit
B001TZSAJI|5|This was exactly what we needed and quickly.
B00ZR4WUTS|1|Does not fit my 2005 BMW X5. It came all scratched and looks like crap. Do not buy this. Here is hoping for a return.
B009PNEIHY|3|Very nice looking seat covers...nice texture and color as advertised...difficult to cover seats and secure with fasteners provided.
B00IJEA7IY|5|Just what I needed for less than what a dealer would charge. Super easy to swap out.
B00OOFLHQS|5|Cute!
B00BVL7W1C|4|Pretty simple device. 3 piece set of rim strips designed to slide over lip of rim to protect it from tire tools. After receiving these, I changed 4 tires on 2 bikes. 3 mag type wheels and one chrome spoked wheel. The protectors fit great on both types of wheel. They have strings attached so that if they slip off and fall into tire, they can easily be pulled back out. I used the strings to sorta of tie them to the rim so they wouldn't slide off the lip of the rim. That is actually a slight issue. As you pry against them, they have a tendency to roll under the rim lip and fall off into the tire. After 4 tires, they are a bit scarred up, but better them than the rim lip. Even with the scars, they still function great and will last through a few more tires I'm sure.
B00YCYCNLY|5|Chain was everything I expected great price and good quality !
B004OHEWD6|4|How could they not work?
B0092ZWDNG|4|Great product but a little too delicate
B00LL6PK2K|4|Thoughts on this particular tire gauge after a couple of months of ownership.<br />1. It appears to be accurate as I checked it against two other mechanical gauges.<br />2. Although it is very light which initially made me think it was low quality the case seems to be holding up. It is a two part plastic mold held together with two small eyeglass type screws. The activation button continues to have a positive click<br />3. The blue LED is easy to read and does come in handy during low light situations.<br />Disclosure: This item was sent to me complimentary for review purposes. However, the opinions expressed are honest and my own.
B005XDOV9A|2|Holes to line up bolts do not fit,  have to lift the whole platform to try to lock carrier in upright, Went to hardware store to get smaller bolts to they would line up better, contacted seller for assembly instruction was told he shipped his back and does not have them, was told by seller to contact manufacturer or google it, this carrier does not have those on google or on you tube, The carrier is a crap and not happy with the seller,  See no way this carrier can be handled by myself going to need help to lift carrier up as the pins are not lining up
B000N4UQL6|4|A great tool to have
B005RA6W8W|3|Would be better if it were side opening vice top opening.
B00W81OBPO|5|It fit perfect. Thank you.
B00XG879RK|2|It makes sense why the cost is what it is. The installation was a huge pain in the butt, required removal of the headliner and I had to practically destroy my stock light to get it out. Doesn't come with nuts to fasten it in place and the stock ones are two small to work with the new housing. After I managed to fasten it in place securely there was a gap between the housing and the cab which needed to be filled in with silicone. Hopefully this thing at least has some longevity and the lights are a little brighter. You get what you pay for. At least it looks nice.
B00VEP2NGE|5|Was easy to apply and has stood up well in the blazing sun. Would definitely buy from again
B007WR25ES|5|Traveled all over the U.S. rain and shine. Kept all of the contents dry. Love that it is soft and can mold to fit bulky items. Also love that it can hold alot or a little.
B00RUES2PY|5|awesome
B002YXC07W|5|great product
B00BINYS9W|5|Great Product and Fast Service!
B002E3644W|5|aok
B0048FMM4U|5|Perfect fit!
B013JEN4E2|5|Hi, Harley rider 25 years. Just bought my first F3 Spyder. Colors look great on this jacket and the plus Kavalier. I ride in black leather kavalier,  too hot. Is this jacket nice for spring, summer and fall? One more thing there is no size chart. I am 5'10 160. Will it fit me?
B0013REXPW|5|Look great and fit with no trouble at all. I'm very happy with them
B0048ECQU6|4|Fit was perfect. Material was nice, but sheds a little.
B00IMPEWHM|5|Worked fine on my 99 chev silverado
B00C7VU9BA|5|just what i needed
B0074OWDA0|4|good quality very visable
B00JUQFVX6|4|Great for long trips and storage of my grandkids DVD player, snacks, water, etc.
B00V9T31HK|5|Love the head lights!!
B0041CDPQO|5|Great product
B008S8VZ9Q|2|If the rim stem is less than 90 degrees don't work, and if you try to hold it in an angle is going to break the brass stem.
B005NLQAHS|5|This thing is awesome for pulling codes.  Seems to do a lot more but i haven't tried everything out.  Can't believe how cheap it is and there's tons of free app options.
B0033QQ4VW|5|Pre-mixed.  I just pour it in and go... perfect formula for my 2003 Dodge Ram 1500 Laramie (Hem).
B00XP5KGYM|5|This makes my 2008 Mazda 3 look better than when I bought it. (Rebuilt)
B001449ZHK|5|Direct replacement for the stock ignition switch on a 2007 Moomba XLV. Fits and functions perfectly. Easy to install and operate.
B002SVHD0O|5|works well
B00ELNATDA|5|Finally, I can start loading the dishwasher and even though I may not have a full load, and can give my family the message that the dishes aren't yet clean. This is definitely a large magnet (Check the sizing.) but it's flat and lightweight. It sticks well to my dishwasher and never scratches it, which I appreciate.
B0007M1ZGE|5|Works well as advertised.
B00SMWZC4M|5|works great
B01092IEEM|5|Shipped very fast. Fit good and look nice. They have online videos to help with the install which made things a snap to put in my seats. Inexpensive but no made cheap. Happy so far.
B00G620ZVU|5|I was pleasantly surprised to see I actually received two lights, and not just the one I was expecting.  All of the brackets and mounting screws were included as well, so installation was a breeze.  We used them on our 2012 Polaris and have been incredibly impressed.  We even went through some heavy rain storms and hit some water, and the lights held up great.  The light output is impressive and just what we needed.  The price really is incredible for what you get.<br /><br />Love them!  Would highly recommend these lights!<br /><br />Fog lights received to test with the option to review. No financial compensation is EVER accepted, and vendor may request that item be returned. I reserve 4 and 5 star ratings for products I would either recommend to others or buy for myself. This is a great product that I would highly recommend.
B000CN7AC6|4|Easy enough to install and functions as it should.
B00ZH6IPMM|5|Very small and convenient.  Filled exercise ball and utility tire in moments.
B005DHXSSQ|5|Nice clean bright replacement for the running light on my r1200gs.  I am showing a fault code for front, but it probably is due to something else since these are canbus ready.
B000EQ0DP2|5|Exactly what I needed works fine
B0042EIJ44|5|Exactly what it said and nice hoses, 09 crf250r. Came with everything needed, great price
B00VGOKO4G|3|I like all of it besides the steering wheel...it only has 1 logo on it but I was under the impression it would have a couple.
B00BJ7OMQ6|1|Broke after a few weeks crome looked good though.
B0060U92FS|5|This switch is just awesome. It lights up red when on and the switch can be closed to prevent it from being broken or hit like the aircraft switches. I installed this into the bed of my 2011 F150 XLT to turn my bed lights on and off. Its diesel as hell and hasn't had one issue.<br /><br />Battle Tested: 5 Stars
B007Y86Z78|5|Works perfectly. As new. Shipped to me in about 10 days (Vancouver island).  Was the hardest alternator to install however. Had to remove front engine mount to push motor forward.
B00QFEJVG4|2|didn't fit in my 2015 ford fusion trunk.. disappointed
B008G22G1A|5|These low cost headlamps have worked quite well for me.  They did include a bulb, and they were a great fit on a 2004 Dodge Grand Caravan.  They've now been road tested on an extended 4 week road trip (about 7000 miles) and another 8 weeks on top of that.  Holding up just fine.  Mine came with nuts (no bolts), but yes, I'll agree the nuts on these are just total garbage, mostly because they are made out of cheap soft metal that can't be tightened without stripping out or deforming.
B00NS6W790|5|Seem to work and the ride is good in my 2002 f150 supercrew over the last couple months.
B003OB2MXU|3|Only giving 3 stars because of a small quality issue. The package arrived on time and all the hoses and clamps were there however they were the wrong size on one or two of them and also were pretty mangled. Luckily I had some other clamps in better shape so it was not an issue as far as getting my car running again. All in all I do not regret my purchase as it did solve a minor boost leak, however the quality of the clamps was terrible. If you were to replace the clamps that were shaped like this it would be very costly.
B00BVBVO98|5|it so good
B0054FJEDK|5|This is so much easier to use that trying to open the hatch to the connector under the steering wheel.  Got one for my mechanic, too.  Used in a 1998 323ci
B0063CSSBC|1|Poor quality. Very disappointed. Chrome finish is so dull it looks gray and no shine.
B00QEXOMY2|4|They are upright but don't throw the light as far as I thought they would in front of me. The do light up the sides of the road very nicely, however. I may try switching them from high beam to low beam and see how that works.
B002T4U3Q6|5|Works great, looks great, funtions 100% like it should. Somewhat tricky to install, extra set of hands would of made it easier. Bottom bolts were difficult to get to, used a deep well socket and 6 inch extension to get to them from the top side. Very pleased with this product.
B00OUM8GLY|5|Really like this shade. I live in AZ and so it is really important to have a good shade that does a good job. This shade is easy to set up and covers the window and dash really well. I would definitely buy it again!
B007ZDGIYM|4|These look nice
B000BRCFX2|5|works fine
B000A0O27C|4|Like the fit and look. Haven't had them long enough to predict life out in the elements
B005SUU2HS|5|The first one I received had a loose crimp on the driver tip and didn't work.  However the vendor immediately shipped me a replacement and it works fine.  I used it to adjust the carburetor mixture screw on my Kawasaki VN800.  The screw is best adjusted with the engine warm and running  but it's close to impossible to get to it without removing the air filter housing (at least with my fat hands).  Even then it's difficult to get to the screw with the engine hot without getting burned.  This tool allowed me to go through from the other side of the bike without removing anything and make fine adjustment of the idle mixture with the engine warm & running.  I suspect the first one I received just slipped through the manufacturing QC.  It was in the manufacturers blister pack so I can't blame the seller & the short inconvenience in getting a replacement was of no consequence to me.  I have several motorcycles & it looks like this tool will work with them also.  Great item.
B0014BEQ54|5|I bought this for my 2009 is250 and it fit very easily and works perfectly.
B0000AXPDU|2|The lock seems to be decent quality material, but the locking design is not great, and it is sloppy and loose. I put a zip tie around it to help the flopping, but it only cuts it down, it will not eliminate it.. My lock is on a boat trailer, so the rattling is far from the cab. If you put this on a spare tire on you car or jeep, it might drive you crazy.
B002662FKE|3|Just received it and already notice things that are not the same as the OEM. Cover is a very shiny black finish while the OEM is a matte black finish, electrical harness is much longer than original, takes a lot more force to fold the mirror, and the bolts and bolt holes are not the same as OEM but does come with a set of screws.
B0009V1WS4|5|Came as ordered awesome shipping good product as well.
B00267PZUK|5|This tool was a life saver. I recently did a tune up on my 2006 Ford F-150. The truck has 71,000 miles on it. All 8 spark plug broke as I was turn to take them out. I ordered this kit and all 8 of them were extracted with ease. I HIGHLY recommend this tool before you start your job. Your spark plugs will broke.
B00KTPXZC6|5|Just got the set of 3 led lights for my RL it's looks nice with the blue inside light looking to buy more
B00429NKWK|5|The process takes about double the time that the box says, but other than that the process is straight forward and the results are great. You do have to sand the lenses quite a bit and it is scary that they remain cloudy right up until the final step, adding the clear coat, but it is well worth it to have clear headlights again. Do a good job of taping  around your lights before sanding so you don't scratch the paint around the headlights. I recommend this kit.
B00D2DS50Y|5|working good
B00KUL5AVI|5|Just what I needed.
B00KBBL4H6|5|It's good quality.
B009DJTJ6U|5|Awesome
B00681BE2S|5|VERY satisfied. It's a must buy if you're needing a replacement like I was. My remote just randomly stopped working, even tried replacing the batteries but nothing worked so I bought myself one of these. It was nothing different than the one that came with my 2006 Ford Mustang. Pleased!
B00AG2HD7A|5|Excellent service. Ordered it it came and the description was good.
B0066S5CTY|5|Very nice  do be careful with your instrument cluster
B00CIJ3T1S|5|Bought one for my friend after they commented on mine. They love it.
B000JFL7ZS|5|This is far superior to a regular socket for changing the oil on bmw, volvo and Volkswagen.<br /><br />Works in tight spaces.
B00RD4D9AO|5|Bolted up just fine.  Bolts were included and was even better
B007S0LDME|5|My husband says it is the BEST Treatment for the Black Tank for the RV!!  Excellent!!
B00FFD53DG|5|Very usefull as expected, I already have an old one and he still works great.
B00PX1KITE|5|Much better than the open grid orange ones
B00OQP5ZL4|1|This probably was not made in America, as it was shipped from Asia, and to top the piss poor quality, it shipped slow and required very extensive instructions, also poorly translated. I could have done an equally poor job for free. Specifically, Fujian China, which was on the package. Don't buy this.
B011C5UK0G|3|Esta bieno
B0002MADZ8|3|One burnt out after first week, maybe a  fluke,  maybe not.
B000C2YXLI|5|great product
B00MUAI7JO|5|I used these to replace the bulbs in my pop up camper ant they worked great. They are brighter and use a fraction of the power so you don't have to worry about draining your battery. The light is a cool blue that is typical of LED lights.
B002Y39NFY|5|I like Denso products this coil works great
B00V9VC714|5|Super strong and EASY TO INSTALL!!! GOOD SHTUFF!!!! :)
B000TK3U4O|5|Great product!
B001C92UAQ|4|Look good but long stems transmit a lot of vibration. Not easy to adjust on the road while riding. OK product for the $.
B00I0H28F0|1|Did not fit
B00MI8I58G|1|They do not fit at all junk so unhappy with them
B00R168R8I|3|Lights did not fit well with where the template laidthem out at.  The back of the light socket hot the inside of the dash cubby holes
B000GZO3Q6|4|Best I ever did see!
B00DJ5KE9U|4|My wife rarely drives her car (health issues), so the battery runs down. I got this after too many calls to AAA road service - none of our trips was long enough to charge the battery. It was easy to hook up, and over about five days (!) it went from &#34;solid red&#34; (charging) to &#34;solid green&#34; (charged and maintaining).<br /><br />I'm impressed by the engineering care that's gone into the unit - the hot lead is fused, it's not supposed to be a spark hazard under just about any reasonable situation, and so on. There were two sets of battery connectors - one with clips, like you'd expect, and a permanent one with proper bolt-on connectors, like for an RV or boat.<br /><br />The LED status indicator is not very bright - hard to see in sunlight.<br /><br />I'm very happy with the unit!
B000CBVELG|5|fits pickup and looks great
B000C9NO52|5|Excellent.  I have used ACDelco 24216035 twice on transmission fluid changes for my 2005 Cadillac Deville base model.  Excellent fit and product.
B009Z1EW0E|5|Great price and this product comes in many sizes in 1&#34; increments so you can get the one that fits you best
B0067UCKBE|1|I received the mount with the end of the threads damaged from imperfect machining. I could not screw the OEM nuts on because doing so would have stripped them out. I did compare the threads on my OEM mount to confirm they are the same size/pitch.
B00029JOE2|5|Very satisfied
B0007M2PGI|5|Works great.
B000YC9FTQ|3|You get what you pay for. It looks good, feels very light and cheap...<br />Im sure it will work just fine...<br />VIAIR is a very good company and this is their entry level gauge..<br />I only bought this to get an order over $25 to use Prime..
B00936M8Q6|5|great
B00HAXUL0O|5|great price
B008Y5AO40|5|A great investment! Probably allows you to pack more than you really need. But it's a very good quality piece of luggage. I had read where it wasn't designed for H.D. Airwing rack, but it still worked well on mine for a 2,000 mile trip with no problems.
B000OCHF2A|4|Great tool when you need a Puller.
B000WGNNUQ|5|works perfectly coupled with our solar panels
B00B4XBQPU|5|I love this frame. So easy to install and it looks so classy on my silver car!
B000NUE6ZC|5|I bought this for my 2002 Lincoln LS. Amazon said that it would not fit but it is the right part number and IT DOES FIT. I did not install myself because I don't have the steering wheel puller but it took my mechanic less than an hour to R2 it. I replaced it because my horn and all of the steering wheel buttons did not work. Everything is good to go now. Great product!
B00G620ZVU|5|Nice and bright for hooking up my trailer at night
B008DWPYO4|5|These are the best connectors I have used.  The have heavy gauge wire as expected for this type of connector.
B00853A6FI|5|Perfect fit. No hassle install.
B00F3J2FW4|5|collects all the unwanted dust and dirt, stays in place, made well and seems to be durable. fits my Jeep wrangler Unlimited well
B007AOSAM4|5|Looks great fits good
B00KMDBODC|2|Good sturdy product. Recommended. Update: two years later it's started peeling so bad my truck was a mess. I threw it away. Should last longer than a couple of years.
B001662WPS|3|The part was okay, it did not have a spring seat arear so when the spring was uncompressed it did not sit very even had to work it several times to make it sit okay.
B004VQTOD8|1|does not fit anything newer than 2009 ram
B001FO9WEU|5|Item arrived as stated.
B000N5U5VG|5|Replacement battery for 2006 Kawasaki ZX6R 636.  After letting my battery sit for too long without use it was dead. This was a direct replacement that swapped straight in. There are write ups online on how to the do the swap it is straight forward undoing a few fasteners and removing the seat to get the battery location. Ships dry and then you add the acid when it arrives. Design is great cover on the acid becomes the cover for the battery sells and the puncture system ensures no mess or spills. Would recommend to others.
B00VHOE3RE|3|Adhesion is not 100% and required some finesse and multiple tries
B00BSEQKVK|5|packaged well, nice steps, look good
B0002F9YHI|5|Perfect for motorcycle leathers: not greasy like Leather Nova.
B000FPZV0E|5|Great product just as described, worked perfectly to correct my caster angle after lifting my CJ7 3.5&#34;.<br />2.5&#34; springs and 1.5&#34; boomerang shackles. My Jeep is spring under axle, will not work with spring over
B00EKEGRVS|1|Ship. Not good. Breaks easy.
B000FPYFBA|5|Just what I needed, just like the original, only better, On a 1984 CJ7
B00FKDJ0J4|5|Just what we needed, thanks so much
B00FLKIKQA|5|Works great
B0001XPC6S|5|High quality leather. Plenty of space if you have a lot of cards. Fairly thick with cards in it and he center ID holder is not removable so don't be fooled. But great product. I love it.
B00PHAQE6W|5|I hooked up my 1200 Peak Inverter using the DB Link fuse holder using a 4 gauge wire. This is the most rugged and diesel aftermarket fuses I have ever come across. It was easy to install and I have the peace of mind knowing my truck and inverter are safe behind it.<br /><br />Battle Tested:  5 Stars
B00BS102A8|5|Great quality. Easy to remove and stick. Quite large and very visible. I love it. Shipped in three days.
B005EB259Y|5|Fast shipiping and well package!  The only problem is that the smell doesn't last long.  I still love the smell though
B00CNUFZ14|5|Met all my expectations.
B0055ELS6G|1|Bad news! It arrived smashed in pieces!
B00RW4MTM4|4|They fit our '03 Pilot well.  There is a bit of noise we can't get rid of though.  Also, the ends that tighten the clamp before locking...pretty easy to break since they are made of plastic, so be careful tightening them.
B002OUMU66|5|Worked great, on motorhome now
B00480BVQA|5|This was an exact fit and color match.
B00KGID5YY|5|Great replacement starter
B000UD6BN2|5|Worked great on our Hot motorcycle one week trip this summer, love it!
B00HY06SS2|2|I ordered these a few weeks ago and as the saying goes you get what you pay for. The license plate is too small and I had to modify it and the trunk led to get them to fit and occasionally have to tap on them to get them to come back on. The map lights were almost too big to go back in. Real poor quality. Save your money and buy something else
B00OW856RS|5|Super  Quality
B000GZJHD0|5|Nice THANKS A+
B003QHT5L4|5|Great price compared to the ones on the tool trucks. And it works great.
B000BZN9IE|5|Perfect fit
B00GTGU554|5|I installed these on my 2010 STX f150.lights installed easily and LIGHTS UP the cab of my truck,cargo and reverse lights are allows bright..very happy with this purchase..highly recommend for your f150..
B000S2WD00|5|Love it
B00A3JIDUC|4|02 Grand prix w/3.1 put about 5,000 miles on, works fine.
B004K9KETY|5|Good stuff brah.
B00B4UP7US|5|Awesome product,  did exactly what it's meant to do.  Would recommend to any one.
B00CMOBTU2|5|Excellent flagpole for camping or tailgating. I've used it a handful of times with no issues. Very light weight and easy to set up. Would definitely recommend it
B000BYB1WQ|5|Fit my 1994 Mercruiser 3.0L ignition just fine. Way cheaper than other options. Seems like OEM quality even though I'm sure it's offshore mfg...<br /><br />Got about 4.0 hours on it. If it ever fails prematurely I'll update this post.
B009FU7CUC|5|Nice!
B00VE1C3OK|3|At first I was very satisfied with this product.<br />It's a great looking keyring<br />The keychain metal is high quality.<br />The leather strap is also very nice.<br />I like the thick metal ring for attaching to a key ring.<br />It is spring loaded and it works well.<br /><br />However, I am giving it 3 out of 5 stars because after about a week of owning it, it broke (partially).<br />There are two small screws which affix the leather strap onto the metal keyring.<br />One of these micro screws fell out and I have no idea where it went.<br />The other screw is still in place and therefor so is the leather strap.<br />But it appears like the leather can separate from the metal at any moment.
B007OX6E3S|5|Can't go wrong with these.
B00H6ETIWY|5|Just what I needed
B011BTMDQM|5|I installed LED bulbs for the turn signals/hazard lights in my Datsun 260Z. In order for them to work properly, I needed an electronic flasher relay. However, the one I chose allowed the turn signals and hazard lights to blink quicker than I liked. I searched for adjustable turn signals and found these. It was just a matter of plugging them in and adjusting the speed until I liked it.<br /><br />The only drawback is that they don't click when operating, so it is possible the turn signal could keep going, and you might not notice. That isn't a big deal for me.
B00FW1JRVK|3|brake reverse lights are not very bright. Everything else is legit. :)
B009TBUOLG|5|Awesome stuff
B0072UHJN2|1|Well, i was going to use the hitch as a bicycle carrier as a Chevrolet Volt is not allowed to tow trailers. I bought the hitch with a eu ball mount. There was so much play on the euro mount, there where it is put in the hitch, that the bicycle carrier moved from left to right and made rumpling noises on the road. I had to weld the mount to the hitch to solve this problem.  Furthermore the ball that was on the mount had play from its own. To het it right i also had to weld it on the mount.  Mounting on the car however was easy.
B002QYDD3O|2|Didn't smell like leather. It's not a terrible smell though as long as you keep it in the plastic bag when it's opened or else it'll be overpowering.
B00NHY392M|5|Great price !!
B003CJQRDU|5|Good looking bandana with a different center and border design than most you will find. Have had one for like 7 years. I approve of this product.
B003YC3TZO|5|Perfect OEM fit for my application. Great quality, arrived on time, packaged good! I would recommend & would purchase again!
B009FNWPCO|3|item had a few dings on it and it does not mount as shawn in the picture. The mounting system sent is pretty flimsy. I would not have purchased this item had i known how it actually mounted.
B000GZPH2U|4|Nice works as advertised, I just found that the wide really is a little too wide for my liking.
B006A2J1XO|4|These were the mirrors my former owner had. This one feels very stiff, which is good. My former one was very loose and I had to constantly adjust after 80mph
B00K69GEQY|1|It's a nice little clock but it does get a glare anywhere you put it in your car save your money buy something better
B000E8X5GO|5|These are great shock! I have a new rack on my ford P/U and the new shocks I just put on were not able to hold it down, so I put on these Ultras and it is nice and stable back there now (no more bounce).
B002RSIK4G|5|There should be a warning label on this stuff &#34;May cause entrapment&#34; LOL! Wow, this stuff is unbelievable. I can't imagine anything it wouldn't stick to and become a permanent part (including your hands). The obvious use is for RV roof sealing but I found a number of uses like sealing around the step well on my RV and waterproofing the base of my external RV refrigerator access compartment.
B01182M7OU|5|I really like this front and side sun shade set by Starlitt SunShade. It is a total package, with this your car is safe from the heat. My car has leather seats so consistent sun does damage the leather. With these i don't have to worry about the dash and seat leather as-well as the car being an oven in summer while it is parked.The shades are made with high quality materials and fit perfectly.<br /><br />Side sunshade:<br />-  The side sun shades attaches to the window without suction cups, which is great. They provide perfect amount of shade without obscuring the view. To place just peel backing-off the film, and adhere to window. It sticks without any messy glue or water. (Make sure you clean your window before placing the side shades).<br />Front sunshade:<br />-  Just place them in the front windshield and they sit perfectly. After use you can fold away sunshade flat for storage in carrying pouch.<br /><br />The measurements of the front and side sun shade:<br /> -  PVC cling side sunshade:42cm by 38cm.<br /> -  Front windshield sunshade:150cm by 70cm<br /><br />Now for packaging and shipping: The shades were packed in a plastic bag. The front shade comes with a small carrying cover so you can store the shades while not in use. The shipping was also very fast, i received the sun shade set in two days after placing the order. The price is also very reasonable luckily i bought them at a discounted price for testing and unbiased review. I am very happy that i did because these sunshades provide great & complete protection against sun.
B00AI0BU1K|5|got to me very fast and works great.. thanks
B007VG9E9Y|5|What else can you say.Their Weather Tech.
B00LNG6C5M|3|A little flimsy...
B003VAV0L4|5|super heavy duty and well made!
B00D1418KI|5|This is a pretty compact device, smallest compressor I’ve owned. Aired up my golf cart tire no problem. It’s now my travel buddy because I can just put it under the seat. The gauge works well, you have to turn it off to see the real pressure. I received this at a discounted rate for my honest review. I was actually impressed as well with it, wasn’t even that load of a device. Would buy again if I need too.
B00CSBO6J0|5|Best price found.  Fast shipping.
B005GOPT0G|5|Exactly what I needed for an RV
B00CFCI404|5|I put these in my 04 Toyota Camry and they fit great and are pretty heavy duty.
B000P7O5DG|5|Good
B00B9DEDVY|5|This product works very well to ELIMINATE active odors. It doesn't leave a heavy sweet smell. Fresh, easy to spray away the odors.
B0002S9X3K|5|Great fit for my 97' Wrangler. Bought this due to some small rips in my seats. It covers the seats perfectly. Material is sturdy and no movement when driving.
B00873J0YY|4|It was easy to install but you have to a little mechanically inclined. But all in all their fine.
B000HS8UHA|5|This is my second Baker ratchet pawl. You can't go wrong with this product. Top notch company with great products. A little pricey, but so what? So is the motorcycle it goes into. This will be the LAST shifter pawl you ever purchase. It's my second because I have three motorcycles, and will replace the worn shifter pawls with a Baker unit every time.
B008473MU6|4|Not as reflective at an angle as others I've used but head on and at a slight angle it is good
B0010E1LYY|5|Work great! Easy installation.
B001EU59VA|5|I bought this along with s and b filters mouth piece 76-1006b for my 2005 duramax lly. The combination really helped with throttle response especially at low speeds. It was an easy install and imho with the money. And it looks good too. I've had it in for 4-5 days driving daily no problems and good instructions with color pictures
B00DJEDBBY|2|So I will address something that I have discovered the hard way.  I have a 2014 Ninja1000. Came with the factory hard bags.  This fender eliminator placed the blinkers to a position that the bags cannot be installed. Beware...<br /><br />Second, for 100+ dollars, could they have pre assembled it a bit?  It comes in more prices than Ikea furniture.<br /><br />Third,  please leave the dollar store metal alone and use quality.<br /><br />Fourth,  the wires used for the LED are so small that they cannot properly fit into the NON WATERPROOF connectors, and dare I mention, no connector end, expect splicing.<br /><br />I am not allergic to work, but my 100 dollar fender eliminator just negated my expensive hard bags. If you have a Ninja 1000 with bags, don't buy these.  If you have aversion to poor quality, don't buy these.<br /><br />Finally, looks good when complete. Only reason for two stars.
B00DSD66P4|5|nice thick strong adhesive. Has lasted one whole winter season. The wife is a huge harry potter fan and loves this on her car.
B006M9VIRM|5|Saved the front of my trailer.
B00NXL4KHM|3|Compared to brand name light bars, these are pretty decent for the price.  Build quality is ok
B00MXC1PXO|4|Mine ran a little large.  But the feel great and look great, too.
B000C36D3I|5|Not much to day about a radiator hose -- It's exactly as described as far as size & shape, and the quality seems fine.  It satisfied my needs for a 90 degree bend in this particular size hose.
B00BY24MT8|5|Cool shirt
B004L04SBM|1|Really loud in truck and leaks..lens is hazy from moisture getting in
B005BYOOJS|4|It's fantastic!!<br />In my case the only problem is that, the blinkers aren't allowed in my country.
B001P2EF9E|5|Great
B00QMWQK2M|5|Excellent!!
B00JO9ZIA0|5|Works :)
B005ZS091M|5|Outstanding.  By purchasing this online we saved a considerable amount of money, and the mirror was very easy to install.
B0021YZER2|3|It does cut through the harder water, however be prepared to do it several to many times on the hardest stains.
B002OMNAMW|5|Will this fit 2014 harley davidson street bob fxdb?
B00KHUQAY8|1|Stinks like gasoline
