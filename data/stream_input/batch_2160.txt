B000QRIGLC|4.0|Navy Seals have to be the toughest guys on the face of the earth. They are real patriots. Words can not express my gratitude for the sacrifices they have made. So that my family and I can live in the land of the free...
B004U52VPS|4.0|Grandson, age 6, was not that familiar with Angry Birds, but was willing to learn the game.  He had heard of Angry Birds but had not had any experience with it.
0765325950|5.0|Another amazing piece of work by Jordan/Sanderson.  Some parts of the books did drag a little bit, but overall definitely a page turner.
B009GFEOY8|4.0|Using on a Vintage OneStep Poloaraid, Didnt get great color or quilaty, but then again I'm using a camera built fin the late 70s, takes about 30 minutes or more for the to delevop. Will buy again!
B005IQZB14|4.0|I enjoyed following her journey and was amazed at what a bold and daring adventure she had.  Really enjoyed it.
B004WR125O|4.0|Simply installation and configuration, good sinal, provide a wireless connectivity that enables access to Internet Radio and my Media Server with no glitch, but lacks for information on manual for setup as a fixed IP Address.
B00136JQMI|5.0|You just feel hip listening to this. Bourbon in an expensive glass enhances the experience. Very cool album here, folks.
0385535147|3.0|The Racketeer is Shawshank Redemption with its own twists and turns. A wrongfully accused lawyer tries to use the \\"solve a crime and get out of jail\\" card and to tweak the Feds at the same time. Half way through the book the turns of the plot become nearly unbelievable and the Feds naïve and hopeless. Decent yarn.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|It's not often that I read a book that I loved as much as I loved this one. It's perfectly truthful and honest. I never wanted to put it down.
B000VHXD7O|4.0|I love movies based on fact and this is one that I really enjoyed. Learning about how the Navajos tricked the Japanese with their language was inspiring. There were a few slow spots in the movie but overall I enjoyed the action and characters and especially the story line.
B00B0ZT9NI|5.0|I had heard this was a great flick and it really is. The directing and acting were superb. I recommend this to anyone who likes a nail-biting tense drama.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|You gotta love Zemeckis, he's great!<br />And my man Denzel is (as always) sooooo gooood!<br />Good movie, worth every cent.
B004ODLUGM|5.0|What a tremendously entertaining story for children.  This DVD is a treasure among my three year old grandson's collection.  He never tires of seeing it.  He knows the storyline by memory and continues to enjoy it every single day. Even mom, dad, gamma, and gampa enjoying watching it over and over and over.<br />  And Amazon gave terrific service in filling my order.  Thank you!
B007AJFSJW|5.0|I was surprised and delighted to find that a book on economics was so readable!  It's my first book on the topic, and I'm enjoying learning from it.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I like that the puzzle pieces fit like a regular puzzle. and the pitchers are great but I don't like that the puzzles sometimes disappear in the middle when I am working on them.  and it would be nice if the frame of the puzzle would lock i in place. other wise I have a lot of fun.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|Facinating story on survival in the grimest of circumstances. Interesting look on the choices that need to be made to survive.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Very addictive.  The first few chapters of the first book in the series were confusing...no idea what was going on.  Now I am completely addicted to the stories and characters.
0062017926|5.0|Awesome read. I thoroughly enjoy James Rollins' books.  I don't know how he continually hits them out of the park, but he does.  He always ties the unusual into a theme and makes it almost believable ... and the parts that aren't believable are enjoyable!  The twists and turns of his plots keep the reader on the edge of their seat.  I always look forward to his books and this one met its mark.
B000IYU9IG|5.0|John Wayne's version of  Taming of the Shrew is hilarious.  It is more fun than a barrel of monkeys, so to speak.  Most of the regulars in John Wayne movies are there, and a few new faces, too.  Fun movie.
B00A1AD6ZU|5.0|Awesome read. book.  I thoroughly enjoy James Rollins' books.  He is creative, thorough and easily grabs the reader's attention throughout the book.  This was another slam dunk!  Loved it.
B002UZXJA6|5.0|Celtic Woman says it all. This CD has great arrangements and many new cuts.<br />If you like Celtic Woman, you've got to get this one.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Takes a while to gain energy but I like it,  I have enough energy to do what I can in the little amount of time this I have to play games.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Chris Kyle is a true American Hero/Patriot. He truly sacrificed for his country out of a sense of duty to his country. This book tells the stories of those physical, emotional and relationship sacrifices and the story of the greatest sniper in American History. A must read for anyone interested in the Seals, the wars of the past decade or just the man, the legend that is Chris Kyle.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think it is a.great game for all ages. It keeps me on my seat and does not lack any thing<br />it lags tho
B0012GN0JE|3.0|i bought this albumn just to get a digital copy of the song Ambitious. what a great effort with some very creative guitar playing.
B0011EU0NG|5.0|you really can't go wrong with this classic movie. My husband who had never seen this movie even liked it :)
B00B2V66VS|5.0|a great game with better graphics. then the first. I reccomend playing the first one first becaude you wont like it if you start witu the second game.
B0050PYNOY|5.0|This movie is hysterical and completely unorthodox at the same time. The more you watch it the funnier it is. It also has some big name stars. If you like funny adult humor and the Middle Ages you'll love this movie.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I am addicted to all things angry birds. This is a great variation on the classic with a fun theme
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This series is awesome. However, you have to be open to reading hot sex scenes they may differ from your own practices. Its a great read.
B001AI7KAE|5.0|I BOUGHT IT ALONG WITH A A CD OF SPANISH GROUP &#34; QUINTA ESTACION  &#34; BUT I HAPPEN TO LIKE THIS CD MORE ! I LIKE HER VOICE ! ALONG WITH THE SONGS ! I REALLY RECOMMEND IT ,BUY IT !
B00ARAO1LC|4.0|Pretty good movie, not just a run of the mill production. Great cast and interesting story this one will keep you on edge throughout.
B007704PRU|3.0|Good sequel, not really brilliant but good. Kind of obvious from the start where the plot was going but if you don't mind that, keep on reading because the ride is a good one. Loved how Lena evolved as a character - from someone I didn't like in the first book to someone I rooted for here. Lauren Oliver is a master at character development!
B007IK44CK|5.0|Probably one of the best MI movies in the franchise. Yes most of the cars were BMWs (and that concept car was gorgeous) but it was a very action packed film with a lot of intense moments. I enjoyed it a lot.
B002RI9M2U|4.0|Couldn't put it down, such a haunting read! Clay's reactions to the tapes were so very real and offset the emotions that Hannah portrayed in her messages very well.
B00081U7HC|5.0|I have always loved Richard Gere. He is my all time favorite actor. He and Julie made this movie sizzle.
B000SEGMAU|5.0|It makes you think about life and how to appreciate little things we take for granted. I not only learned to appreciate little things but also be able to distant my self from the world's over bearing  culture; rather helped me create my own culture. A must read.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Season 3 is the best yet with the most surprises, action and suspense! I constantly wonder what's going to happen next and how they get out of every situation!
6301640659|3.0|Great movie, great Pacino and a really lurid subject matter rarely looked at. BUT, you must buy the DVD or Blu-Ray copy instead of this VHS.
B004ZMWUCU|1.0|I read a couple of chapters of this book and could not get into it.  I found myself skipping parts to see if it was going to get better.  If I have no books left to read I will try and force myself to finish it but I ended up getting some other books for now.
B00BESCJII|5.0|What a fabulous gem of a film!!!!  All of the characters were believable.  I imagine many people can identify with many of the characters.  Beautifully written and adapted to the screen!!  A must see!
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|my favorite part about this game are the grapic and power ups. its so much better than the first especially because it stops right away instrad of always taking a few steps off the cliff! and i also appreciate the fact that it is free so try both if you like! :)
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I was pulled in due to the positive user ratings this Anker mouse was receiving and the great price that came with it. This mouse fits comfortably, is very responsive, has great customization with the programmable buttons and you're just a click away from their website to install the newest drivers for the mouse. The option to change the glow of the logo color is just an extra cherry on top!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Excellent ! Couldn't put it down. I didn't think I would care about reading the next book but find now that I couldn't  Miss it.
B007SGM084|5.0|Just finished reading all three books and I think it is just as good or better the second time around.
B007QPFGJW|2.0|I am being kind with two stars. The characters are depressing druggies - even Hole who claims to have kicked the habit. Marion.
B000G8NXYG|5.0|Subtitles were hard to see sometimes.  Story line was great.  I thoroughly enjoyed the mood lighting, and have always preferred old black & whites to the current color films.
B00908DDZM|5.0|Macklemore and Ryan Lewis are beyond brilliant. This is the BEST rap CD in ages. He truly is a poet with quick wit and awesome beats and not all smack talk and call women bitches and HO's .. Can't wait for the next CD. We are playing this CD over and over and over at my house..
B00065GX64|5.0|This is such a classic movie.  Parts of it was banned due to the content, but I am pleased that it came out in a set.  Black & whites are filled with mood lighting,
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Keeps my i7 3770k running great.  Just wish it came with the secondary fan like the picture shows.  But I also should have read further into contents detail.  Still a great cooler though.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Love all the Pendergast novels, this is no exception.  Very exciting.  Can't wait for the next novel to come out.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|A romance with a twist.  A good quick read that was hard to put down at times.  I enjoyed it myself.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Gideon and Eva have very troubled pasts and can share that experience with each other and us, I hope Sylvia Day keeps writing this way I enjoy her books.
B00B9366VO|5.0|This is an amazing Documentary filled with some of the most talented musicians ever! I highly recommend it to everyone!
B008QQP34I|3.0|The item I received was not the item advertised. The product description indicated &#34;Three disc Blu Ray special edition&#34; What I received was a 1 disc rental copy with no special features. Delivery time acceptable&#34;
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I was 2 seasons behind on Downton Abbey and finally caught up! Yeah!!! Now on to Season 3. I highly recommend this series to everyone.
030759565X|5.0|I got this for my sister 2 months ago because the pictures for each recipe in the book look so tasty and I thought she would get a lot of use of it.  She has made a lot of the recipes already and I've been invited over to try some of the delicious recipes.  I would recommend as a gift, or for yourself.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|This is a beautiful CD.  Andrea Bocelli has a magnificent voice and his choice of songs on this CD was wonderful.
B006SMLAMQ|1.0|ha!!!  THIS PRODUCT DOES NOT WORK.  WASTED MY MONEY.  I HAVE TRIED TO GET IT SET TO MY CITY, AND IT JUST WON'T.  I HAVE TRIED EVERYTHING.  THERE ARE OTHER APPS THAT, I AM SURE, AND 10 xS BETTER, AND THAT REALLY WORK.
B00B37RYMQ|5.0|Nothing to complaint about. Good edition from the beginning to the end for an excellent book of classic literature. I enjoy it.
B002N1AEN2|5.0|Simply beautifully done music. Seriously, songs like VCRs or Basic space or Heart Skipped a Beat. Amazing. Buy it, please.
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|Loved it.  Was a great story with enough twists and turns to keep you guessing.  Sparks is a wonderful story teller.
0307454568|5.0|The last in the trilogy was extremely well written...I definately recommend it if you have read the previous two books..
B00005JL0I|3.0|A stellar cast, and a good takeoff on the James Bond series. This is a comic farce - one that's worth seeing at least once.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I really enjoyed the story, and am looking forward to the sequel. It was really easy to get into the story, to like the characters and care for their fate. I strongly recommend it to anyone looking for a well-written fantasy story, without childish or half-baked elements.
B007REV4YI|4.0|It may not have broken any box-office records, but Skyfall is first class entertainment. The special effects have gotten better, and the action a bit more exciting - all in all, a worthy continuation of the Bond series.
B000FC13MM|5.0|A well-written, fascinating story, with truly original details. This book was really hard to put down, and I knew I would have to buy the 2 sequels. I regret that this author is not more prolific! If you are looking for a great story, with lots of suspense, immersed in an interesting universe of its own, buy this book!
B00006878K|5.0|Want to hear where the late great Stevie Ray Vaughan, arguably the greatest blues guitarist ever, got his primary inspiration in developing his style? Here it is folks...this album, released in 1967, when 13-year-old Vaughan's style was still in its formative stages, is pretty much the basis of SRV's toolbox, particularly &#34;Personal Manager&#34; and &#34;Laundromat Blues&#34;, with King's groundbreaking super-bend stylings all delivered with impeccable taste and use of dynamics! Albert King was no &#34;blueshredder&#34; by any means...he was more interested in squeezing as much emotion out of every note possible, and SQUEEZE them he did! The rock-solid backing of the equally legendary Stax house band plus the Memphis Horns add a rock-solid backing for King. My favorite part of the whole album is toward the end of King's burning solo in &#34;Personal Manager&#34; when he's bending the crap out of the strings, and a band member &#34;whoops&#34; in encouragement in the background...classic! I'm not sure who it was...I'm guessing Al Jackson, Jr...whoever it was obviously just knocked out by King's playing...I mean, who else was playing like that back then? Everybody in the studio must have been really digging it, for sure!<br /><br />The slower ballads on this album are a stark departure from King's down-n-dirty blues guitar vehicles, but I suppose the producer was interested in showing all sides of King's abilities as a performer, and he indeed croons with the best of 'em on these more relaxing tracks. I actually really enjoy his vocal performance on &#34;The Very Thought Of You&#34;...he sounds like Nat King Cole at the beginning of it, and his strong vibrato really shines throughout on that track...you'd be surprised how versatile Mr. King is!<br /><br />Anyway, just an awesome record, and the sound quality is superb, especially for being 35 years old (when this re-master was released). INDiSPENSABLE for blues guitar fans!!
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Loved it. should be required  viewing for anyone who has a problem. drinker in their life or as a wake up call .
B009XHAM8G|5.0|I love this book, I used to read this to my son when he was little. I was looking for it not to long ago and turned out the book was gone. I saw this on here and had to get. My son at 13 still remembers it and it warms my heart. This is truly a great book to read to your little ones. You may be surprised and many years down the road they remember it. I recommend it highly to all parents.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Will order Season 3.  One of the most interesting things about the series is the small things that were important to nobility 100 years ago.  Even in a movie, I had never seen a formal dinner where the hostess turns the table.  At the Abbey, the Countess turns the table during a formal dinner.  They are also most upset about having to let maids serve in the dinning room.  This is not a female job!
B009K86D86|5.0|I can't recommend this movie enough!  It truly is a must see!  Exposes the lies and untruths within the food industry.
B00425S1H8|5.0|It works the way it should. Easy connection and automatically detected. No problems at all.  I would definitely recommend to anyone
B0000024JN|5.0|Do you have a CD player? If so then buy this CD. Enjoy the sounds that come out of your speakers and relax. This album is good. You should already know that.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Great product to use for the knives. Very portable. I have no complaints about the product. Would purchase this again.
B000FC10MU|5.0|One of my all-time favorite novels. Ever. It just captures the conflicts of modernity so elegantly. Gaiman is a master storyteller, and his interpretations of old mythological figures and narratives does it for me every time.
B000X1Z0BU|3.0|Although I LOVED the musical, the movie is a little slower in pace and didn't leave me feeling as inspired.
B0079XPUOW|4.0|Really enjoyed reading this. Lots of plays on Trekkie and SF culture in general, but an enticing story in and of itself. Cool plot turns at the end as well!
B0068FYZIO|5.0|Received as described and 16 more words required now 11 now 9 now 7 now 5 now 3 now 1
B00136Q342|5.0|If you like Johnny Cash, you will love this live album....  It's a must have for anyone that is a Johnny Cash fan.
B0050Q3TDY|5.0|As good as it gets, jazz choices are numerous and music is continuous. Highly recommended and the price is right.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Absolutely loved this book, couldn't put it down until I had finished it, and then immediately bought the next book in the series.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|My husband never reads.  I downloaded this to his iPad and he read it in two days while on a cruise and wants to read another John Grisham book!  Once I started it I couldn't put it down.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Absolutely loved this book, couldn't put it down until I had finished it, and then immediately bought the next book in the series.
B005XN2ZUC|5.0|My husband and I stumbled across this show on  Netflix. After the pilot, we were hooked!! It's a must watch series! Every show is excellent!!
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Absolutely loved this book, couldn't put it down until I had finished it, and then immediately bought the next book in the series.
B006GHA9QQ|5.0|now gerald butler  could play in this new one we loved this one but how about a movie  since it follows the phathom  well think about it  even our 10 year old loved this one & used to watch over & over at  5 to 6  years of age the phathom
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Absolutely loved this book, couldn't put it down until I had finished it, and then immediately bought the next book in the series.
B004ZNAGNE|5.0|Bought it for my sister for a present and she snet me a copy which is just fantastic.I listen to it while cooking and it takes me back to a really nice place.Don't hesitater if you are a classic rock fan.
B000ICXQUQ|5.0|in this film The Star ray consella is searching out closer with his father who passed away and she never really got to enjoy time with
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|A friend started me on this series years ago; read all of the books once, I'm on my second time now.  :)  Great story, great writer!
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|The trailer for this movie did not excite me. I rented this movie because I could not find anything else new to watch.<br />I was very impressed with the film. The acting was very good and the story kept my interest.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is a very easy to use app! Quick to learn and just as addictive as the real carnival game!
B003QS9WIE|4.0|I like this film a lot. The only thing I did not like was the quality of the sound. Some of the actors mumble a lot and it is very hard to hear. But over all the film was very clever and had many plot twists.
B00992CF6W|3.0|My boys have mindcraft on their Itouch, my Android and on a Kindle Fire. The Itouch and Android received the latest update and the kindle did not. I don't see anything here that would allow me to have that app update on the kindle. So now for the 6.99 I paid 3x's, it's for nothing because now they can't even play together anymore. Which was the idea behind getting the kindle to be able to play on the larger screen. Any advise would be greatly appreciated. not paying for the app again. The boys do love it.<br /><br />s
B0074MZSWW|5.0|Just awesome, saw the video for \\"Hold On\\" on VH1, walked over to my computer & ordered after hearing only one song. The first person I thought of when I heard them is Janis Joplin. I have never said that before...need I say more? LOVE IT!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love subway surfers but I have a question for the makers. Was this game made before or after temple run. I don't mean to offend the makers but the two games relate pretty much the same. Anyways I do love this game. I also think you should add more characters. Maybe characters that are animals.<br /><br />  - Codilianna :)
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Great action, excellent POV writing, enough tech to keep the nerds happy, and a truly compelling story line all combine to make one great book. I read this book far more quickly than I wanted to, simply because I couldn't wait to see what happened next! Do yourself a favour and get this book!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Wonderful book, the romance the twists and turns.  Absolutely<br />Exciting.  I would refer this book to anyone needing a little romance in there life.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It's a calculator. it helps me with my bank balancing. it gets the job done. there's even fancy functions if you need to compute complicated equations.
B0093WVND4|5.0|I personally love this book. Because it has a wonderful twist to it. And the ending was awesome + the story was described very well. p.s I hope you enjoy it!
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|This was an interesting movie that me and my child both enjoyed.  I loved the video game references throughout the movie and if you are a game nerd you should catch some fun things as well.  The story was really good as well for the people not interested in video games.<br /><br />I can't wait to own the movie because its rare to find a movie that your child and yourself can both enjoy with multiple viewings.
B00B99KJR0|4.0|This game is a lot of fun and gets more challenging, got stuck on day 57 still not sure how you got past all the locks.  The one and most important bad thing about the app is you cannot close the game and resume it later, that ruins the whole<br />shame.  Otherwise fun.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|The film is a classic Tarantino film.  It has its share of vulgar language, violence, and a lack of political correctness.  Hopefully you've seen his films before so you know what to expect.  Christoph Waltz makes this movie.  He is simply amazing and if you enjoy him in this and haven't seen Inglorious Bastards you really need to check it out as well.<br /><br />The downside of this movie is the length.  It is very long and there is a long drawn out set of sequences before getting to Leo that probably could have been trimmed down.  Saving that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it all.  This was the kind of movie where I was glad to see if keep going, but I could see where the runtime could bother some people.
B007SGM084|5.0|I have not completed the book, but it keeps you interested and make you not want to put the bbok down.  I will give you complete outlook once I have completed the book.
B00A81MV3U|4.0|If you are a fan of something different that's not just a Hollywood type story than you will enjoy this.  It reminds me of a Bad Santa type of raw movie.  De Niro, Cooper, and Lawrence play such flawed characters and I find these movies refreshing.  You don't get to see movies like that everyday so I enjoy them.  I wouldn't call it a laugh out loud comedy, but there is a few funny scenes.  Most of it has to do with how out of touch these people are with their issues.
B001I8A76A|5.0|love Pink! great songs on this album great quality from cloud equals happy customer. i hate how these limit your words.
B007REV4YI|5.0|I've never been able to get into any of the Bond films over the years, but these last 3 with Daniel Craig have been great.  I'm not sure how Bond fans feel, but they've made me a fan of this series.  This movie was the best of the 3 with Craig I've seen so far.  Lots of action and drama in this movie with a very intense ending.  Can't say enough about these last 3 flicks.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|This is a very good sharpener for the price.  It does an excellent job of sharpening things.  It is quick and easy and can sharpen more than just simple straight blades.  I use the tapered diamond rod to sharpen serrated blades and woodworking chisels.  I actually own 2 of these.  I keep one with my tools and the other in the kitchen.  As for pros/cons : The only one I can think of is that although it is clearly labelled \\"Carbide\\" and \\"Ceramic\\", it does not say which surface to use for sharpening and which to use for honing.  I suppose that is more of a failing with me than the tool.  It is small and light enough to keep in your pocket or on a lanyard.
B00AFEYUVG|4.0|I had no clue what this movie was about when I started watching it, but its a very interesting movie.  I didn't see any slow spots in the film.  It gets a little dark in some spots with some subjects that may be uncomfortable for some.  I enjoy movies that aren't so clean cut and by that I mean they don't have to have a clean Hollywood type of story.  This seems very real because of the bumps these 3 people deal with in the movie.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Great story!  I couldn't put it down. Maybe a little soft on the finale.  Not the ending I expected. You be the judge.
B0002V7O3S|5.0|I am happy with my purchase. the movie arrived quickly and was in good condition. I paid $15 dollars for this movie. It was the cheapest I could find. I think they are not making it anymore. Great movie!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Nice UI for the world's best known card came is a great way to waste a minute or an hour.  It's hard to go bad with a game like this, but Amazon Apps has found a great user interface and functionability to this old time time waster.
B009JBZH54|5.0|excellent film, great actors, director, cast, crew and most of all, great spirit in all of you!!!!!!! of making this film real
B009CPJHY4|3.0|Recommended by others, I found it entertaining. Slow moving that it is, I would recommend it as a breath of fresh air from all the shattered glass, explosions, fires, and gunfire in much of the videos today.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|Recommend this book to everyone.  Helped me to keep a proper prospective on life.  It is book that I read more than once
B002FQOI0A|5.0|This is a fun and easy read for 11-15 year olds.  Being a teacher, I think it really captures the mind of young teens.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's a great game for anyone who loves horses and keeps you entertained for a long time.very good graphics as well.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|this is SUCH a addicting game!!! if u like talk with friends and drawing and just having a good time then this is a GREAT game for you! :)
B0063IH60K|1.0|Junk! Full of spam! You don't get anything for free! Don't bother! Pay a buck for Solitare+ by Brainium. It's worth it.
B00127RAJY|5.0|For someone who never writes reviews for ANY product, (but does read them) I feel compelled to comment/rave about this workout and I'm only on my 5th DAY of THE 30 DAY SHRED.<br /><br />I am the mom of two small kids. In my late 30s. Tall and fairly thin, yes, but not in particularly great shape as I've not really EVER worked out consistently. I've had several opportunities to join beautiful gyms due to my past employers offering substantial discounts but never, ever stuck with it.<br /><br />Now, with two small kids and so little time in my day for anything, no money for the gym, expensive yoga classes, or babysitters to cover me for either, I've done nothing for myself, including taking care of my body and I'm closing in on 40. After reading the thousand of raves for the 30 Day Shred, I thought, fine, what's there to lose, right?... but secretly wondering WHEN I would actually lose interest and give it up.<br /><br />5 days in and for the first time in my life, I WANT TO KEEP DOING IT AND FEEL A CHANGE IN MY BODY ALREADY.<br /><br />What makes it different for me?<br />The length of the workout. Above all else, for a mom whose job never ends, the short time commitment is paramount. You are DONE before you know it and you feel like you worked hard. I have yet to feel like bailing and skipping a day the way I almost certainly would if this were a 45-50 minute workout. I can't stress this enough. The length of the workout is akin to a shot of confidence -- once you've done it twice, you know you can easily do it again and again.<br /><br />The length of each circuit, the change-up of the exercises, coupled with the 3 different levels, makes it perfect for beginners AND perfect for more the advanced. It's my 5th day in I have not felt like I absolutely can't power through a tough part watching Anita on level 1. AND I see great potential in doing the Natalie moves (more difficult) as I improve, coupled with the 3 different levels for even more challenge. Even on day 5I am able to do deeper, more advanced versions of some exercises.<br /><br />Jillian is a great coach. She knows what to say, how to say it instruction-wise and WHEN. Everything she offers to ensure you are doing a move correctly is spot-on. When she describes the knot in your abs during the very last part, she is reading your mind and that acknowledgment is a confidence booster. In other words, it all feels natural and is easy to follow -- a perfect balance of instruction and encouragement considering I read so many gripes about other videos and how 'this or that' is irritating.<br /><br />If you are sitting on the couch looking for inspiration, please give the 30 Day Shred a try... I am only 5 days in and an enthusiastic convert!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|it just gets boring some time and I dont even know what every thing on the screen is that makes me sad....jkjk I LOVE IT!!!!
B003UBTX6S|4.0|Loved it!  As good as the first.  I wanted the story to continue- I can't wait to start the next book.
B007L6VR12|5.0|What a surprise! An absolutely charming movie. The cast is excellent and the setting is simple and straight forward. It is more than a coming of age story. Two young people are finding friendship and respect in a world of dysfunctional adults. There is no overblown music and it is spare in presentation. It was a great find.
1780721676|5.0|Great way to loose weight and return to vigor.  Best plan as i have tried many and this one works so have a go at it if you want to return to better health the easy way.  Respectfully,  Lew
B009GEAPYW|4.0|Great blu ray , great picture .. Good sound ... Kinda short though ... Alot of extras on blu ray
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed both Helen Hunt as a sex therapist and William Macy as a Catholic priest in the movie &#34;The Sessions&#34;.<br />The subject matter was very unusual.Many people think that the disabled or those with severe abnormalities are asexual. After getting to know &#34;Mark&#34; and his desire to have sex for the first time it becomes obvious that sexual urges are not just limited to persons that are normal.  I've recommended  &#34;The Sessions&#34; to a good friend who is severely disabled. She sounded interested in seeing a movie that included her favorite actors and a film about an incredibly unusual topic. This was a great movie. I cryed at the end when the three special women in his life were together at his funeral.
B008X9Z37A|3.0|The outside of the case is a nice durable finish.  It has solid front and back flaps to keep the Fire safe....  light weight<br /><br />I personal prefer to have a strap to close the case<br /><br />Also I don't like the way the corner points secure the Fire in place --  it seems stable enough but I just don't feel they are constructed well.<br /><br />Also don't like that the charging port is in the center of the case  -- just not good design<br /><br />There are a lot of better cases out there.  Such as the [[ASIN:B008ULPBJG Verso Trends Darwin Croc Case for Kindle Fire HD 7\\", Red (will only fit Kindle Fire HD 7\\")]]  -- Or any case by Verso --
B001NHNG64|4.0|Opens BIG, with the abduction, you are immediately caught up in the frenzy of being &#34;taken&#34; and then the hours of cross country travel which could have been an &#34;are we there yet?&#34; situation, was filled with the same tension that all of Reacher's adventures bring us.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|I feel that Daniel Craig is second only to Sir Thomas Sean Connery KBE in portraying James Bond in any iteration of the Bond Franchise.  Skyfall was entertaining, gave escape from the humdrum of today's World and was profanity free (on Amazon's VOD).  It was definitely worth the view and I recommend it to anyone seeking a &#34;Bond Fix.&#34;
B000003R7G|5.0|Classic album from a timeless band. The basslines, vocals and samples make this album a great piece to ones collection.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great book. A great and believable love story. I would recommend you read this one. Can't wait to see the movie.
B0000013GS|4.0|Outkast is by far one of the biggest influences in rap and hip-hop. So it goes without saying that this album is a staple in the genre.
B0000DJE9R|5.0|THE CD WAS IN GOOD CONDITION AND PLAYS WELL.<br /><br />THE SONGS ARE MICHAEL'S BEST AND IT QUITE ENJOYABLE.<br /><br />I PLAY IT ALL THE TIME.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Heard from many people to just skip reading this one.  I'm so happy that I didn't listen to them.  The book bounces to different times in Katniss's life but was easy to follow and made sense when reading the whole book.  It was worth the read...and will probably be read again.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Good book in the series.  I would recommend this series to my friends. Now to find something to read that is as good as this series.
B005LAII12|3.0|Funny at first, but then went off the wall.  Not sure where the story was going most of the time.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|Who deserves to have physical love? Everyone, right? It is  basic need for all humans, and those with physical challenges deserve no less than others. This is a rather beautiful movie that makes you look at how important human touch is to all of us, and lets you walk in someone else's shoes for an hour or so. Good, good movie.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I really enjoyed this book only wish the ending would've gave me more. It felt like it was missing something.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|LOVE IT! ONE OF MY FAVORITE! MY DAUGHTER PLAY IT ALL TIME, DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS GAME, YOU WILL MORE THAN HAPPY.
B004DK5CW4|5.0|loved this movie I have watched it about 20 times already. I love horses and I grew up in Conn and would have loved to go to the bellmonte I did go see a horse race once
B007N5YIUS|5.0|LOVE IT! ONE OF MY FAVORITE! MY DAUGHTER PLAY IT ALL TIME, DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS GAME, YOU WILL MORE THAN HAPPY.
B005NJU8PA|4.0|Random interesting stuff.  Basically a book with a lot of life hacks.  If it means anything,  after reading this I bought his other book 4 hour body.
B00000FC5H|5.0|Man. how do i begin?! First let me say, that i am a HUGE EWF fanatic! I'm one of those die hard fans that wants all of their stuff. That being said, this collection isn't really enough to satisfy my craving for their music. I agree that it covers their essential hits, but I am much more content with buying the original releases. There is maybe two songs max out of discs 1974-1981 that i do not have rated 5 stars on my iPod, or even have but that's it!<br /><br />As some of the other reviews have said, this is a great compilation for those who just want to start out basic or just have some hits. My dad bought this album, and i bought a copy too (from Media Play) just going to show how long i have had this. Since then, i have collected the original albums, plus Live In Rio, [[ASIN:B00008KKZM]] ,[[ASIN:B0000033Y3 Earth Wind & Fire - Greatest Hits Live]](FYE or Best Buy) and [[ASIN:B0026OIBN6 That's the Way of the World: Alive in 75]] (FYE) As well as DVD's [[ASIN:B000056N8W Earth Wind & Fire - Live]] (Circuit City) and[[ASIN:B001675YUW Earth Wind & Fire In Concert]](Best Buy) which my dad also introduced me to on VHS. I even got[[ASIN:B000069RJI Essential Earth Wind & Fire]] (Best Buy) to get a wider variety, mostly for In The Stone. For quite some time, I really wanted Raise!,but that album was especially out of print. So i got and was [[ASIN:B0033XKV78 Raise/Powerlight]] and was 100% satisfied! Once again, all of the songs are rated 5 stars on my iPod. Even the song Miracles, which as any fan would agree, has the wrechedly out of tune children singing at the end.<br /><br />Nonetheless, I have known a couple of their songs before i even knew who they were!! The songs i remember hearing are Getaway, and Let's Groove. So all in all(get it?) They are in my top 5 most favorite bands ever to hit the earth! This is for the simple fan, but any one else like me I suggest you buy the orginal releases.
B00B0LPYXG|4.0|The movie started out with intrigue, but then it became sort of natural way about it.  It was very entertaining throughout the movie, but I guess I expected more from it.  I enjoyed it and would recommend it to people to watch it.  Denzel Washington is a terrific actor and played the part like a trooper.
B006X50OPW|5.0|As a commodities trader of years of experience, I think this book very good.  By rereading it once every year, I constantly realize the gap between the masters and myself still exist, though narrowing.
0316066524|5.0|I literally both laughed and cried while I read this. It's a tremendous and savage literary journey into the pursuit of happiness in america and each of us. I've though forever differently since.
B00139XSBA|5.0|Great read, very entertaining narrative on the beginnings of the space race. Recommended for anyone interested in the genre of space.
B008LY5VHE|5.0|I enjoy watching this movie when I'm depressed, the suspense in it is very exhilarating and at times Roy Scheider  can be a bit funny.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I thought it was amazing how well he bounced back after being so ill.  I was a clinical nurse specialist and worked 45 years mainly in psychiatry.  I am a spiritual person and also have read &#34;Heaven is for Real&#34;
B00B2V66VS|3.0|this game is addictive but very hard to focus<br />things come at you too quickly.<br />but it is still fun to play.
B0087GJ8KM|5.0|Mr Pink illuminates confirms what I've believed for a long time.  All of us are in the business of selling and, therefore, should treat one another with respect.  I enjoyed reading this very much.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|It was a good story but have to confess the author over the years has become pretty predictable.  No real surprise in story line and I honestly have no desire to see movie as it too will be pretty predictable.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Great book, very well done, I'd love to see more from this author. The story was full of detail, it was clear he did his homework, and strived to make the story as realistic as possible.
B007U5OOT6|2.0|I was attracted to the movie because of its average 4 star rating but boy, was I disappointed. There is nothing in the movie that keeps it interesting. In fact, I had to force myself to get through it! There are many other great movies on Amazon Prime - just don't waste your time on this one!
B0076DELIG|3.0|A captivating story, page turner, can't put it down,--------for 90% of the book!  Why is it so difficult to finish the task?  The ending makes one think the writer simply got tired and simply said, &#34; Let's get this one to the editors and start something new!&#34;.The finish destroyed my enjoyment of the build up with its totally unplausible and weak ending.
B0026PW67W|5.0|again, the grandson loved the map and anything to do with harry potter. he has the map opened all the time.
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|I saw Lawrence as a young man in the movie theatre. I had purchased a David Lean collection on DVD several years ago and thought that what I was seeing and hearing was good, until I tried the Blu-ray version in my living room.
B008CX2A2I|3.0|Download the the free Onkyo app from iTunes and pair it with your *newer* Onkyo receiver and you don't need this USB
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Totally entertaining movie. It was something that my wife and I could both watch together with our daughter.  I would recommend it!
B000Q7B8FS|5.0|Awesome.  What else can you say.  It's rare that a sequel, referencing the two follow ups in the trilogy, ever compare to the original.  Haven't seen the Bourne Legacy, however, this movie and the subsequent follow-ups that make up the trilogy are a MUST OWN!!  That is if you're into this action type genre.  Don't F!#@*%$#@ with Jason Bourne!!  I've downloaded the digital content and will revisit these movies often.  The blue ray is the ONLY way.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|Amazon basics line has never let me down.  This is a great value.  It doesn't add much bulk to your phone.  I wouldn't test it with roof distance drops but waist high drops protected it just fine.<br /><br />Since it's clear it looks a little dirty over time becuase dust gets trapped in it.  I'm too lasy myself to clean it, but it still works.
B00AIA89HS|5.0|Best album ive heard since the middle of last year.  Hatebreed really did a great job on this, and i can't stop listening. I'd recommend this to anyone that likes metal or hatebreed.
B006FO3ERQ|5.0|A strange book, Canada is not a pot boiler or even like Ford's Updikian Rabbit-like Bascomb tales to which I related as a middle-aged male reader. This is something unique, a one-of-kind tour de force that leaves me enthralled by the power of the narrator's voice and changed somehow by the story he tells. Here is a book in which the biggest moments are given away in spoilers and yet demands that its pages be turned. Strange people, strange places, bizarre events and yet all completely believable and fascinating. I'm not yet sure what happened here but I love it and believe in it completely. Dell and his sister are real people to me. I will never forget them. Ford made it happen with a kind of magic.
B00BHUVD3K|5.0|I NEVER MISS AN EPISODE,I EVEN DVR ALL SHOWS THAT RUN ON TNT.TRUE CHARM,WIT,AND TOTAL SEX APPEAL[[ASIN:B009RX7IX8 Castle: The Complete Fifth Season]]KEEP THE GOOD COMING.HE'S SUCH BAD BOY THAT IS TOTALLY ALL MAN.
B006LSZECO|1.0|This book had received a very promising review from &#34;Entertainment Weekly&#34; so I felt justified purchasing it. After a very slow beginning, I finally began getting into the novel. It switched back and forth between the two main characters. First you would hear from the wife, then the husband and so on. The story became more and more implausable as it went on. I searched my very soul to stay interested. I decided that I had devoted so much time to this book that I must see it to the end. Then it ended. I seriously despise books that build up to what should be a blockbuster crescendo, only to end. I always feel that the author got tired of writing and just decided to end the book. I wished I had made that same decision, only several chapters before the last.
B002O1TMI4|4.0|not even close to as great as Black Holes and Revelations. I'd still buy again, worth every penny. Also, excellent price.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Good story and a quick read.  I like the focus on character development and the brief focus on the sexual pursuits of the main characters instead of focusing solely on the sexual aspect.
B005LAIHQS|5.0|This was one of the best movies that we have seen in a long time, I'm always recommending it to people!
B009GED3HS|3.0|This show seems to be puttering out. Performance are getting stale and so are the characters.<br />Barney was one of my favorites, now I feel like I can quote his lines before he says them.<br /><br />And Ted. Oh man, please, somebody shoot that character. So annoying. The worst kind of character. One that Says NO to everything and is a roadblock in moving the story forward.<br /><br />But, I still watch the damn thing. Cause they got me hooked.<br /><br />So, it's okay.
B005WUHAX8|2.0|The idea of this case is great, but the screen had a wave in it so the &#34;touch&#34; screen doesn't work at all.  I returned and ordered a new one from a different retailer.  The new one is great - same design but a much better fit.  The return process with Amazon was great.
B009FZHYKU|3.0|Or better yet, DON'T read the comic. You'll probably like this more than I do.<br />What have they done to Andrea and Michone?<br /><br />My God. Andrea is the furthest thing from a good character. Whiny, whiny, whiny. And Michone? WHY WON'T YOU TAAAAALK? Jesus, that's annoying.<br /><br />Rest of the cast is great. Can't wait for a zombie to munch on Andrea and Michone to cut off her head!!!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Who needs reality TV when you have a program like this.  Thoroughly enjoyed!  Love the characters and the story line.
B004Q3SGWG|5.0|I didn't know what to expect...I had heard the gist of the story once the movie came out but wanted to read before watching.  The author takes you along every obstacle and triumph as he climbs the 14,000 foot mountains in the Utah and Colorado areas.  I learned so much.<br /><br />When Aron is trapped and details his ordeal, he shows personal growth through his torment and results in being a better human being.<br /><br />The ending brought huge unexpected emotions from me, which is rare.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|I like to race the clock and complete as many as possible in 1 minute.  I do get bored of it easliy.  The game is easy to use and it flows free.
B005H29GSI|5.0|I got them on sale in December for 6 dollars and ordered so many that I ended up with free shipping. The cheapest I had seen them in the store was at $14.99. The kids love these and played for hours. I have some the regular set, some the space and I found agry birds on ice as well.
B008K8VDPU|1.0|Not a finger tap piano person. Thought it was going to be the bubble drop/tap piano my friend has.  You have to play the notes to get a tune - Waste of time really.

B007N8RULO|1.0|I play spider solitaire on my computer all the time. . love it.  I downloaded this to my kindle and the screen is just too small or something.  It worked okay, just didn't look right so removed it from my device.  Now I play free cell on my kindle.

B0097GVJWQ|4.0|Point and click adventures can be a mixed bag. This one is good. The puzzles are challenging but not too difficult.
6304806418|4.0|If you like the stage play, you'll enjoy owning this version.  Antonio Banderas surprised me with his singing ability, if he in fact did the singing.  Madonna's singing was good but her acting ability was so-so -- nothing to write home about-seemed to be just playing herself.
B007V5CF5K|5.0|I recommend this game to everyone, family and friends, it has mass appeal. After I raced through the game I immediately jumped into the second one, they are addicting.
B006RXQ1L6|4.0|The movie is a great alternative to a &#34;live&#34; stage production-singing and dancing surprisingly good-thoroughly enjoyed it.  Would highly recommend.
B0064W65UM|4.0|Love this one.  Most likely a five star rating with a re-read as the numerous characters were tricky to keep track of and tell apart.  The climax of the story was powerful, will stay with me.  Thank you for sharing your genius Mr. Moore.
B0000640VN|5.0|If you liked Meg Ryan in &#34;Sleepless in Seattle&#34;, you'll love her in this film about finding your true love even if it means having to go back in time to find it!
B00632HWOG|5.0|I added this and use it consistently as my mail service.  Works perfectly, although the navigation is a bit different from PC version, and I wish it would revert more simply to Inbox....  I prefer the display - makes me feel at home wherever I am!
B00003CWLF|5.0|Truly spectacular love story of an English woman and a king that stays true to the original book.  Where the &#34;The King and I&#34; white-washes the brutality of slavery in 19th century Siam, don't get me wrong-I love the musical, this movie portrays the harsh reality of not obeying the law of the land-the king- and it's consequences.  The scenery is absolutely beautiful and the cinematography captures it very well.
B002Y0TGOU|4.0|This movie was great to watch even for the second time.  Actors did a nice job and it was nice to see the older Spock again.
B008Y1YKE4|5.0|What a great cast of voices!  Recognized Jim Broadbent's voice right off.  And who doesn't love James MacAvoy or Bill Nighy.  A lot of funny lines in this one.  It is a favorite of this Mom and of course the boys love it too.
B0025KVLRO|4.0|Recently I added the highest quality DAC to my audio system.  As a starting test, I compared the 1987 CD release of Please Please Me to this newer remastered stereo version.  I focused on Love Me Do and P.S. I love You.  Try as I might, I could never hear any difference between the two CD's. Then I played the original LP version in comparison and again the only difference was the surface noise on the LP.  To add insult to injury, I down loaded these two songs on iTunes and guess what, I could not determine any sound quality difference between the two CD offerings and LP version.  I am glad I did not waste money on the remastered box sets.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I absolutely love pinterest.  It is nice to have it on my device....portable and perfect.  Wish I had a larger device to view the pics but that is not the apps fault....
B00B9366VO|4.0|Great review of the 70's through the 90's rock culture.  Very well done and it was fun to watch.  Highly recommeneded
B008518MOW|4.0|I love the special effects in this movie and it has its funny moments, but overall the first one is still the best. I think this version is more cartoonish and the character development is very poor.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|My kids sure seem to enjoy this app. However, neither they nor I have been using my LG MyTouch phone for the last 10 hours (except for half a dozen text messages, and no calls), and yet I'm down to 15% battery (with WiFi and Bluetooth turned off). Android reports that My Little Pony has been consuming 52% of the battery. What's it doing, since nobody has been playing it today? Perhaps it would be better to install this app on a tablet rather than a phone.
B0079KGAOY|5.0|Everyone knows that Mel Gibson now has major issues, to put things kindly. But as Martin Riggs, loose cannon and suicidal (over the death of his wife) detective, he used his charisma, angst, and sense of humor to full effect. And, once Riggs is teamed with veteran family-man detective Roger Murtaugh, the fun begins, including what one would expect in these movies: Lots of quips, explosions, and memorable villains, most memorably, Gary Busey (another actor with issues), as Mr. Joshua in the original film.<br /><br />Over time, the audience meets other villains, not to mention Leo Getz, played to annoying perfection by Joe Pesci and IA detective Lorna Cole, played by Rene Russo. Cole and Riggs do the usual hate/love dance - complete with a great scene of comparing battle scars in the third film.<br /><br />While the last film is arguably weak, it still manages to keep the action going thanks to a new villain played by Jet Li in his first (I think) American movie role. And Chris Rock adds more humor to the mix (some may say too much humor by then) as fellow cop and new son-in-law to Roger Murtaugh, Lee Butters. Butters and Rianne, Murtaugh's eldest daughter, also give Murtaugh a new person to stress over/love in the form of a grandchild-to-be, much to Roger's surprise. Naturally, Riggs and Cole are on a parallel path with Riggs having found happiness with Cole, awaiting their own bundle of joy. Okay, so the last film seems like family overload, but again, the new villain angle lets everyone know this is still an action franchise, so enjoy it if just as an end to a great series.<br /><br />Included in this set are the scenes which were included in the so-called director's cut (so-called since Richard Donner once blasted that and has publically stated the theatrical versions *are* his \\"cut\\" with the inserted scenes seen as a cash grab) as separate bonus/deleted scenes. A fifth disc not found on the UK version also contains more extras, too.<br /><br />So with the price being so low, grab this now, make some popcorn and have a marathon with L.A.'s craziest cops, proving in scene after scene, movie after movie, that while they claim \\"[we're] too old for this s***!\\", they can still get the job done and live to joke about it.
B007W1BLN0|3.0|It was OK<br />Character was interesting, and the scenery was very nice, but too long and moved along too slowly.
B00AE2IJIE|3.0|I really wanted to like Paranorman and, well, I basically did.  For me it lived up to both the praise and the criticism, simultaneously, somehow.  Some things about the movie really work, including:<br /><br />The stop-motion animation, which is beautiful. I've never seen it done so well and it really shows the care someone put into this movie.  The characters don't look too cartoony and the horror-scene visuals are truly creepy.<br /><br />The archetypal characters, who are used to good effect and in many ways seem to be tongue-in-cheek.  The humor, too, is corny and somewhat predictable, but that doesn't mean I didn't laugh.  What can I say?  It's very cute.<br /><br />Notably, however, there are some important elements which really miss the mark (spoilers):<br /><br />The entire sense of danger is misplaced.  When the witchcloud first appeared in the sky, it was *clearly* coming from a particular spot on the ground some miles from where Norman was standing.  Wouldn't that have been a good place to check for her grave?  Norman didn't have to go to the records building at all.  A slightly different visual would have made this a non-issue, but as it stands the illogic is glaring.<br /><br />Finally, the moral of the story is ham-fisted and flawed.  Tolerance is good, okay?  Nobody should have been mean to Norman.  But expecting people to refrain from flipping out at zombies is a bit much, especially when the zombies don't get around to explaining their presence until it's plot convenient.  And Aggie?  It was wrong to kill her, no one's arguing that, but she WAS in fact a witch.  So much for misunderstood.  The whole witch-trial plot doesn't work the same when witches exist.<br /><br />So overall, I liked the idea of Paranorman better than the execution.  I really really wish it had been a triumph of characterization and storytelling, since it found itself at the middle of a mild debate about values and stuff.  But I guess I shouldn't expect every movie to be a cultural landmark, even when it's obviously trying to be. *sigh*
B00AEFY3DQ|5.0|I do not watch movies more than once.  I'm just not enough of a movie fan to waste 1 1/2 to 2 hours of my life on entertainment I have already seen...except this movie.  My husband and I have watched this movie about 6 times over the past few years and I still laugh so hard I cry.  I have no idea why this was not a huge hit!  If you grew up on Star Trek, you will absolutely love this movie.
B000JZ3TYA|4.0|well written story with twists and surprises throughout.  Michael Douglas and Sean Penn lead us to a grand finale.  Michael Douglas plays his somewhat typical &#34;Rich Guy&#34; role - and plays it well.  Penn is perfect as the shady brother.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This book was recommended to me and I thought for some reason that I wouldn't like it. It had a slow start but once I &#34;fell in love&#34; with the characters, it was a beautiful and poignant love story. The writer was very sensitive to the lives of two people; both disabled in different ways. Both matured and realized that judging another has no place in a loving relationship. All the characters in the story grew as the plot continued. Really loved it.

B004EFYZ1C|5.0|Lots of great information with this app. Current phase, moonrise, moonset, current distance, astronomical co-ordinates, altitude & azimuth, lunar phenomena for the last 24 and next 24 hours. Also some solar info as well.<br /><br />Recommendations for improvement: Add declination/RA and distance for the sun. Allow user to select type of twilight begin/end displayed (civil, nautical or astronomical). Flag solar and lunar eclipses occurring within 30 days.
B0035S996U|5.0|What a classic!!  I was first released when I was in high school and we saw it over and over in the theaters.  I've talked about thru the years (\\"Warriors, come out to Play..yay\\") and so my kids got it for me on DVD a fews years ago for Father's Day.  Watching it in HD was really great.
B008BU70HW|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this method of reading, especially how detailed this was.  One gets to know intimacies which bring our favorites more realistic, now I wonder what ever will become of Tom without Matthew?
B001TOQPA0|5.0|I'm so glad to get this 2007 trade paperback edition.  My first copy is a paperback I've had for decades and it threatens to fall apart if I reread it one more time.  It was good to be able to spend time with Kitty and Freddy again!<br /><br />Pity young Catherine Charing.  She's led such a restricted life with her miserly guardian and her silly, poetry-addicted governess.  Mr. Penicuick has no sons and all of his sisters are dead.  Is he willing to do something sensible, such as leave some of his considerable wealth to his adopted daughter and divide the rest among his eight great-nephews?  No.  He's decided he'll leave all of the money to Kitty, provided she marries one of those great-nephews.<br /><br />Luckily, stuffy George is already married, odious Claude is part of the Army of Occupation in France, Charlie is still a student at Oxford, and Edmund is a little boy.  Hugh is handsome, but a saintly bore.  Dolph may be an earl, but the politically correct term for him is &#34;mildly-to-moderately developmentally disabled&#34;.  Freddy is very nice, well-mannered, has exquisite taste in all things to do with fashion, and will be a viscount someday. Still, it can't be denied he's a bit slow and not handsome.  In fact, Freddy is such a nice, dependable guy that even the most jealous husbands will let him escort their wives.  Yawn, right?<br /><br />Then there's Jack.  He's handsome and dashing.  Not only is he her guardian's favorite, he's Kitty's favorite, too.  The problem is that Jack hasn't shown up to make an offer.  Kitty is furious.  She HAS to marry one of the great-nephews or she'll be destitute.<br /><br />Against his better judgment, Freddy agrees to help Kitty with a scheme that will allow her to fufill her dream of visiting London and seeing the sights.  (Don't let yourself miss Freddy's reaction to seeing the Elgin Marbles, not to mention the Tower, in chapter nine.)<br /><br />Thus begins another of Georgette Heyer's Regency Romances.  There's plentyof her trademark delightfully diverting dialogue, subplots that in lesser hands could become too silly to believe, and no fewer than three romances to follow.  It's a good thing that Freddy's mother is such a nice lady because two of the other mothers featured are ghastly people.  I'm rather sorry that we don't get to read what's in store for those harpies.  It IS fun to imagine, though.<br /><br />In chapter 7 we come across the abbreviation 'crim. con.'.  In case you are wondering what the full phrase is, it's &#34;criminal conversations&#34;.  That euphemism gives me a chuckle whenever I run across it.<br /><br />Louis-Léopold Boilly, who lived from 1761 to 1845, painted 'The Amateur Print Collectors' (1810) in oil, on canvas.  A cropped version of his painting was used for the cover of the 2007 Sourcebooks edition.<br /><br />Vorkosigan Saga fans who enjoyed Ms. Bujold's Heyer homage in A CIVIL CAMPAIGN, Ivan as portrayed in CAPTAIN VORPATRIL'S ALLIANCE reminds me a lot of COTILLION's Freddy.<br /><br /><i>Cotillion</i> isn't my favorite Georgette Heyer, but it's a great read!

B009XY97VC|5.0|HOLY COW! I just picked up this album and it is absolutely amazing! Life just became more epic...I deleted the rest of my iTunes Library because it is all in the way of more TSFH. I work in a cubical and when i lisiten to this music i start to sweat cause i get so pumped up. I was clean shaven the first time listening to the album in my cubical, but by track 6 i looked like teenwolf!! Tracks 1,3 and 4 are perfect....BUY THIS ALBUM
B004JZBGWI|5.0|This has turned out to be one of my most helpful buys.  At first a trial idea to fool around with.  Has become indispensable.  We all know the feeling of having lots on our mind and making a list can clarify and take away that nagging feeling you might forget.  But paper list are a real problem.  This way I make a list and have it on my Kindle.  All list in one place, easily revised,  Even a list of bookkeeping task takes away the &#34;what did I forget&#34; feeling.  Since my kindle is always with me, the various list are always with me, easily deleted, updated, or whatever.  It has a calendar at the back that I discovered accidentally, but have already had my calendar in place and haven't played with it.
1593272790|5.0|It is a good book for adult  Lego hobby masters and older kids say, 13 years and up. It is very instructional and not like a colorful Lego Ideas book. It is more technical and is mainly black and white. It has good building tips.

B000FJXQUC|5.0|I gave this as a Christmas present and the recipient was very pleased. This John Wayne movie is a little different from regular westerns. This has an edge of comedy that is very unique! This is definitely one of John Wayne's movies that is so enjoyable to watch. Good cast and good photography! John Wayne did a great job in this situation comedy. Price was great and the shipping was fast....I recommend this movie to John Wayne fans...
B00AEQYM6S|5.0|I have been following Kaufmann's career for a while now and am always pleased by his approach to what he sings: not just the melody and the words but the feeling the music is intended to portray.  This Wagner disc blew me away.  I thought the excerpt from Lohengrin was the highlight of the disc until I reached the Wesendonck Leider.  This the first time I have ever heard them done by a man ( maybe they never have been) but Kaufmann doesn't just do them justice, he takes them into a new realm.  BRAVO BRAVO!!!!!
B00846REIS|5.0|I thought Christian Gey was hot until I met Gideon.<br /><br />That's all I'm gonna say for now.<br /><br />And that Sylvia Day writes incredibly well, and that Eva is who I want to when I grow up - she's not afraid to put herself out there and confront stuff.<br />This story is not about the innocent girl who fell for the billionaire. This one has many, many more layers and I just looooooooooved growing through them.

0802473156|5.0|This book is a great tool for understanding relationships.  I've read several other books such as the Men are from Mars, Woman are from Venus books, and this book takes a different approach to understanding love and how we express love to our partners.<br /><br />This book put into words what we see happening in our relationships but weren't able to decode the meanings behind it. I've learned a lot about myself from reading this book.  For example, knowing what my languages are for love, helps me to explain to my significant other why I do things for her (service).  And how my service to her is the way I say I love you, without saying the actual words.  I think service is one of the main languages the male population expresses love.  But at the same time, the book help me to understand that I too need to understand my s.o.'s language so that she knows that I know how to say I love you in her language too.<br /><br />It's a great read and I think I'm a little better at love than I was before this book.  So kudos on a great read on love.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|My only disappointment is that  Anne Hathaway's songs aren't on it more!  Such a beautiful voice! Otherwise, it a great collection!
B0010ZR160|5.0|I usually don't engage in movies like \\"Gone Baby Gone,\\" but this time I did at the urging of a good friend, and I am glad I did. Plotwise, a little girl is kidnapped, but all is not what it seems. A young though street-wise Private Eye and his pretty partner \\"in business and in life\\" are hired to find her, but....<br />--> BEN AFFLECK's direction is EXCELLENT, tying everything together TIGHTLY without wasting anything--including the viewer's time: everything pertains to everything else and is necessary to everything else--with a few surprises along the way! The movie is pensive rather than an Action Flick, but there are parts which will keep you glued to your seats and have you even \\"rewind\\" to \\"see what exactly happened.\\"<br />--> The portrayals of the street people, drug users and dealers, and the cops in the movie are VERY real, and sometimes even scarily so--possibly because many of them ARE actually drawn from their milieu, off the streets, rather than from Acting Class! Ben's brother, CASEY, is the \\"Hunky\\" (-?) Private Eye who's The Man Who Never Loses His Cool, but his acting is actually nil: very little or no change in facial or body expressions whatever, regardless of \\"whassup\\"! (Even a Mr Cool SHOULD show SOME kind of emotion SOMEWHERE rather than being just vacuous all the time!) And his movie-\\"partner\\" (MICHELLE MONAGHAN) IS pretty but seems to be along just for the ride--or for decoration: her character seems to be \\"just there\\"--except for one crucial scene later on where she sets the crux and we then find the need for her having been along at all. (We don't know for sure if Michelle has any Stuff to Strut, given her part, but there are glimmers....) On the other extreme, however, AMY RYAN as the drugged-out mother of the kidnapped child is excellent: you can almost SEE her as such in real life, her pinpoint characterization is that good (and downright scary, even)! (She well-deserved her nomination in the Oscars for Best Supporting Actress!) --And whatcan we say about MORGAN FREEMAN's almost extraneous (although--again--necessary) role except that Morgan Freeman plays Morgan Freeman: no surprises, just low-key excellence--as usual.

B001KVZ6HK|4.0|Like everyone is saying, the movie is great.  I got it at a great deal at 20 bucks.  My walmart and best buy stores charges way more than the average price here on Amazon.<br /><br />Digital copy downloads in only 1 format that you choose, the file is encrypted and will only work with the format player you chose.  So it's not as if you can download the movie and then take that movie file and watch it on other devices.  It'll only work on the computer you downloaded it to.  Yes, there are ways you could possibly rip the video, but it's actually easier to rip the DVD than it is to rip the digital version to make it portable.<br /><br />All in all, you get 4 versions of Avengers all in 1 package.  So it's a great buy.  Wish I could have given it 5 stars, but the &#34;digital copy&#34; advertised in the adverts misleads you to think that the digital copy is portable across all of your computing devices.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I love this game! Viewing all the different scenes, and trying to figure out what the next move is supposed to be is making this game number one on my list!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|The story line kept me guessing, the characters jumped off of the pages. I was able to invision every scene within my head, and I enjoyed every page of it. I will recommend this book to all of my friends and I will also be seeing the movie in the near future. I hope the movie is just as amazing as the book itself !

B0095ZMMCK|3.0|I was thrilled to see a Tom Clancy book available on Amazon, I could hardy wait to get it downloaded; but I was very disappointed; I don't think Clancy had very much input to this story, other than the idea and maybe the outline.  Too wordy until several chapters in.  When I see one well-regarded author and an unknown one on same book,  I should know it would not read like a Clancy book.

Many years later, re-reading seem kinda funny but it makes more sense specially with more life experience and other great books, such as Power of Now. I bought ebook to read in electronic gadgets, big mistake. Ths book can only be read in print... enjoy doodles , illustration. far-out circular writing.... which is hard to do in e book-you can't read it.

It doesn't look very substantial, but I have yet to have one break and I own one for all my Cells and my I-Pod Touch 4.

B001ANSSDC|5.0|What a great read, and tremendously entertaining book by first-time author Matthew Quick, could not put it down, read it straight through in one sitting. Even though the movie has been nominated for several Oscars, and playing in virtually every theater, I have not seen it, but intend to. The story of Pat and Tiffany coming to life again, in the aftermath of personal tragedy, is in turns, funny, sad, insightful and most of all, hopeful. Mental illness is certainly a topic that runs through the book, but it does not defeat nor define the story, instead it serves as a backdrop for what is ultimately a love song, with no saxophone, between two people struggling to regain a life of value.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I love this movie, I cannot wait for the new seasons, and the shipment comes in a timely manner, you got to watch it!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love the show so far. Season 2 was a bit of a drag and I would only recommend it for keeping in touch with the characters but at least it ended well. Season 3 has been super charged with character deaths and zombie kills all over the place. I love Monday mornings now..

B00AFROVQC|1.0|There is so much that is wrong with this series and the author.<br />1. It is truly a book for younger teenagers. The premise is interesting, but the fat fingered way in which Morgan Rice goes about telling what should be an epic tale - a la raymond feist to name one example - is instead covered in an abridged cliffnotes summary. The 14 year olds speak like they are 30. Deus ex machina plot devices abound every 5 pages. And the progression of the story is just highly unbelievable: the protagonist never actually works for any of the copious rewards he receives. 'So you just magically saved the kingdom, was honored by the king and are immortalized now in song...but since you just stole that cookie, I will now proceed to beat you on the head with my mace and you will be forever vilified by the kingdom.' No, I will just not cover every single way in which Morgan Rice fails as a good/decent writer.<br />2. Only $3 so you would think it's an amazing deal. Think twice. Each book is about 50000 words. I finished each \\"book\\" in about 2-3 hours. While any other honest author would charge $6 for a true book containing a full story that takes me at least 15 hours to read, you are instead paying $3 for a fraction of the story. Each book ends abruptly on a \\"cliffhanger\\" in the middle of some battle or other. The story should not end there, and yet, that is the end of the book - where for any other author it would have simply been the end of the chapter. This is plain insulting.
B004DM0UII|5.0|I love the musical variety that this app gives you access to. As a big House, Club and D&amp;B fan, there is plenty to pick from.

B000IDEORY|5.0|I can't possibly tell you how many times I have watched this movie.  Originally bought it for my daughter when it came out and she has been through at least 2 copies.  This one is for her also.  I do watch it every times it comes on TV.  One of the best movies I have ever seen.  Love Patrick Swayze.  The world lost a great actor when he died.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|It is hard to maneuver, my &#34;likes&#34; don't always register, and I can't navigate the way you can on a regular computer.  I have Timeline Remove on my computer so the pictures don't overwhelm the screen. Haven't figured out how to do that on Kindle.  Can't find my games (e.g. Scrabble and Lexulous)... maybe I'm just missing something obvious here, but don't want to spend a lot of time struggling with figuring it out.  It is okay for really basic stuff.

0316044938|5.0|This book was absolutely amazing. I finished it on a flight back from Hong Kong. It is a story about a young girl who gets murdered and her spirit is unable to move on and she watches her death affect each one of her family differently.  The grief felt by each parent and how it is addressed is realistic. As our heroine struggles to comes to terms with her purgatory state and helping her father solve her murder, the reader can feel her desperation.<br /><br />I truly enjoyed this book and it left a lasting effect one me.
B00A9C3RB8|2.0|We had problems viewing this movie.  The movie stopped several times during the movie.  I feel like we shouldn't have to pay the full price.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This novel is just amazing! I couldn't put it down and didn't want it to end. The first one is also wonderful, but this one is even better. Can't wait to read the third book just to keep reading about these two likable characters. Their story is so romantic and the book is very well-written. I couldn't put it down! Lots of sex yet it's not sleazy. Absolutely loved it!!
B001NLKT60|5.0|Very suspenseful...I never got bored as I moved on to the next chapter. Looking forward to reading the third book.

B003UBTX6S|5.0|This book was progressively better than the first. I am quite anxious to read the next. A Great love story.
B007REV4YI|5.0|This is the latest Bond film, and in my opinion, one of the greatest.<br /><br />I would rank it up there with From Russia With Love, For Your Eyes Only, and Casino Royale (my favorite Bond films).<br /><br />Along with great performances from Daniel Craig, Javier Bardem, and Judi Dench, Skyfall is also beautifully shot, and amazing to look at.
1594744769|5.0|I bought this is as a gift. I have not read it but after reading reviews it looked interesting so I purchased it for an avid reader. It arrive quickly and in perfect condition
B003O86FMW|5.0|Don't need to rehash the many, many great reviews this book and its series have gotten.  I am an adult male and these books are just as enjoyable for me as any teen reader.  Highly recommend for an easy, engaging read.
B001JRB16U|5.0|Our 3 yr. old grand daughter just loves Mary Poppins and having borrowed the library's DVD copy on several occasions and getting upset each time it had to be returned, she was totally overwhelmed and delighted that she now has her very own copy and can watch it over and over again without having to give it back anywhere.  A real hit.

0765363836|4.0|I would probably give it 3 1/2 stars if that were an option. I recently watched the TV show on Netflix and decided to give the book a try, despite mixed reviews. I have to disagree with those who say the book and the TV show are nothing alike. The superficial plot details certainly are quite different, but the overall premise is much the same (at least at first). It was obvious upon whom certain TV characters were based, and all the essential roles were filled in one way or another. However, I can definitely understand why some people strongly disagree, especially since the later episodes deviated quite a bit from the book in explaining how and why the flash forward occurred. There is a lot of scientific talk, but the author seems to make an effort to explain things in layman's terms whenever possible. I think it's worth reading, though you might find yourself unsatisfied with some of the author's choices, which IMHO if tweaked slightly would have made for an excellent novel. I definitely agree with one reviewer who said it was great right up until the end... Before the final chapters I was thoroughly engrossed, and it was a quick read... But he kept going too far, to the point where the ending seemed somewhat ridiculous. I felt that there were several unanswered questions & loose ends that he should've used that time to address instead. As for the show, I wonder if it would've been more successful if it'd been adapted to be a sci-fi show, rather than an action FBI drama type thing. Maybe the nerdier viewers would have kept it going for more than one season :)
B00797MB0O|2.0|2 stars for the actors, but the story sucks. You hate the main character, have no sympathy for her whatsoever. The entire plot is flawed. A pathetic loser tries to recapture her lost youth with a married man. If there's a point to this, I'm missing it.

B0095P33IW|4.0|Captain America is probably the least &#34;explosive&#34; in the Marvel series. But that doesn't diminish its appeal in the least. The thread leading to The Avengers is pretty slick. It took me a while to get around to this one, but I'm glad I finally did.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I didn't want to read this book because I hate ghoulish, horror-filled nightmare-inducing stories in any form, and have always associated Stephen King with that kind of writing.<br /><br />I kindled and read it only because a well respected friend praised it so highly.<br /><br />Couldn't put it down!<br /><br /> I see where the man gets his reputation as a writer - this story is spell-binding, the characters are real, the ending is perfect...a glorious book I'd recommend to anyone
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book and wound up reading the entire series in less than a week.  It definitely hooks the reader immediately.
B0052UYJDC|5.0|This book is truly a great resource for anyone wanting to begin a minimalist lifestyle or is in the midst of starting one. The book has practical recommendations for simplifying your life, and also includes chapters on the author's philosophical view of being a minimalist.<br /><br />This book has a little bit of something for any level of minimalist, and the price is right. This has been one of my favorite minimalist books so far.
1452101248|5.0|I am not a vegetarian, but this book makes me feel I could be. Not that I am going to, but I could live very very happily on the food in this book. I particularly recommend the green gazpacho and the sweet potato cakes (serve them with the cucumber salad).
B00364K6YW|5.0|This production deserves all the praise it has received.  The casting is marvelous and the script follows the novel so closely one might be reading it aloud.  The cast delivers the 19th century dialogue so naturally it seems they truly belong in that era. Although the roles of Elizabeth and Darcy have received the most acclaim, Mr. Bennett is a special delight, delivering his ironies with the perfect mixture of mockery and wit. Wickham achieves the proper balance of charm and perfidy; Mr. Collins of pomposity and foolishnish; Bingley of boyish enthusiam and bonhomie. The extra features on the DVD are informative, especially the one about the care taken in reproducing the costumes and mannerisms of the day.

B007EW9ISM|5.0|Allow me to start this review by saying that this is my fourth stylus and none of the previous ones that I owned belonged to the cheap category. I use my ipad mainly for taking notes and annotating and hence owning a good stylus is a must.<br /><br />This stylus seemed thick and big which scared me off in the beginning but after reading the good reviews I went ahead and bought it. It is indeed big but it feels sturdy and I can comfortably use it for extended periods.

B009U9S6FI|5.0|I  completed Man's search for meaning in a single reading which lasted til 4:30 in the morning. I could not set it down. Frankl provides highly skilled professional observations and in depth analysis of the behavioral characteristics of humans under the most stressful and violent conditions of human existence-as prisoners in the Nazi concentration camps. Frankl  describes why Man's Search for Meaning is so important to survival And emphasizes that personal responsibility, hard work and discipline is needed for the successful search for ones meaning.<br /><br />The book provides a deeper understanding of the human degradation and human tradegy faced by the prisoners of the of the Nazi concentration camps.<br /><br />Man's Search for Meaning has independent value, is a very well written, important book, unique in its approach and necessary to one's understaning of the psychological basis of survival.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I've had a kindle now for a while and I just recently bought a Kobo Glo to use at home. I have wanted a case for both that I can easily use at home and at work for both my kindle and my kobo. I need something that can protect both of my e-readers but also looks cool! I saw an earlier version of this cover for a different kind of kindle and was very jealous that it didn't fit mine. Now that the one for the Kindle Fire has come out, I couldn't get my hands on it fast enough. it's absolutely perfect! I can easily slide my kindle in and it's held in place by the straps. The cover is hard so I can put it in my purse without worrying that it's going to get scratched. The best part, is that I can use it for my kobo glo as well because it's a pretty standard size. There is nothing on the sides, so I can easily see the entire screen. Lastly, I can bend the cover back and the case allows the kindle to stand on its own. It's the perfect case!

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I've avoided this book, I've avoided the movie... I saw trailers for the movie and it looked good but the premise was just too brutal for me. So, why now? Mostly I deal with audiobooks and right now there's a 2 for 1 sale at Audible. I found one book in the sale that I really wanted and I needed to pick another one so I started researching the other books available. I almost passed this by again. I listened to the sample and didn't like the narrator. Somehow I got to a \\"read the first chapter\\" spot and I was hooked. This is the first thing I've done since I started reading several hours ago. It's terrible to start the book knowing that any character you become fond of is likely to die. Since it's a first person narrative you have to assume that Katniss is going to survive. How the story unfolded is gripping. There were other things I should have done, but I kept telling myself I'd stop at the end of the next chapter. Except I never noticed the ends of chapters. The world Collins has created here is gripping. There are other dystopian worlds out there that I've enjoyed reading but none has caught me up the way this one did. Am I sorry I waited so long? Will I see the movie? Certainly the answer to the first one is no, I'm glad I waited. I'd be in emotional agony if I couldn't go right on to reading the next book. As for the movie, maybe, maybe not. It sounds as though it follows the plot of the book well, but I'm a reader. The characters and the setting come alive in my mind and I'm seldom satisfied with someone else's picture. The big question, do I recommend that YOU read it. I can't say. There's so much violence and the premise is heartbreaking. I tend to enjoy books with guaranteed happy endings. I can't guarantee you all happiness... and I have to read the Catching Fire, and Mockingjay to know how I feel about the whole story. I'll be starting Catching Fire this evening. I really hope I get to sleep tonight.
B008TRUDAS|2.0|It makes me sad to write this review because I had such high expectations for this book.  I bought this book after reading \\"Hopeless\\" by Colleen Hoover and absolutely loving it.  This book didn't even compare.  The basic premise of the story is that boy meets girl, boy realizes he can't have girl, boy and girl fall in love, life gets in the way.  It's actually a formula for an excellent story but this one just didn't make it. I thought the characters were juvenile and immature, but considering this book is about young adults you can forgive that.  What I couldn't stand were the constant quotes through out the book from the Avett brothers (a band that both characters love).  I get that they are a good band but it gets soooo annoying. I hated how things jumped around and you were left feeling a bit confused and cheated out of a good story.  I'm a little mad that this book was more expensive than \\"Hopeless\\" but was not as good.  It's also a series story. I bought both books in the series together and will write more about that in my review of \\"Point of Retreat\\".  Overall...disappointed.
B000001DU5|4.0|Everything worth listening to from this band is on this one disc. Lush vocals and pure 80's synth-pop. A trip down memory lane for some, and great example for others on the soundtrack for a decade of oblivion.

B006LSZECO|2.0|At first, somewhat intriguing, then as the book progressed, I kept looking for something to like and root for in the main characters.  Didn't happen!! As I got closer to the end, I kept looking for some resolution.  Also didn't happen! The book just died, leaving the reader to draw his/her own conclusion about the future misery of these thoroughly miserable characters. Probably what the author intended, however, I felt like she just got lazy or ran out of ideas.  The book just abruptly died!  I will probably try one more Gillian Flynn novel, but if it disappoints like this one, it will be my last.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|LOVE this game! Very enjoyable, challenging, loved the way it walked you through and gave you little stories about each level. I'll be playing it again for sure!
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|I originally reviewed this book on my blog about a year or so ago but I thought I'd post it here too!<br /><br />The Hook: Sometime in the near future, love is considered a deadly disease known as Amor Deliria Nervosa.  All citizens of this new world are inoculated against this sickness when they turn 18. Our protagonist, Lena Haloway, is just 95 days away from her scheduled “treatment” when she meets Alex, a mysterious and handsome young man who makes her doubt everything she has always believed to be true.<br /><br />My Thoughts: This is a love story, no doubt about it. But while a budding relationship is central to the plot, it belies a much deeper theme: is security more important than freedom? The government in this fictional world decides that love is hazardous because of the symptoms it produces: anxiety, depression, impulsiveness, and irrational behavior to name a few. The people in power believe that eradicating these behaviors will make the world a safer place. They may be on to something. Watching enough Criminal Minds or Law and Order  and hearing about the various “crimes of passion” that frequent them, illustrates that love can make regular people do heinous things. However, by “curing” their citizens, they take away their right to choose their own futures and stop them from experiencing the things that force them to grow. The result is a world that is safe (as long as you follow the rules), but populated with stunted, emotionless husks of human beings.<br />I have to say, I loved this book. I originally picked it up because the idea of a world without love intrigued me. I mean, our lives are so driven by this complex emotion that it influences everything from the way we behave to the things we do, the music we listen to, the things we watch…the list goes on. It’s only natural to wonder what the world would look like without it. Oliver does an excellent job not only describing this “perfect world” but slowly building the sense thatbeneath this perfect façade lies something sinister and inhumane. She able to tell the story in such a way that the audience, though we know better, feel ourselves awakening just as Lena does. Even her description of Lena and Alex’s relationship, though at times borderline corny, captures the essence of first loves.<br />I’ve read other reviewers complain that Delirium is slow, and while I do agree that the pace of the story is a bit slower than other books I’ve read in this genre, at no point did I feel bored. I’ve also read reviews that compare this book to the Hunger Games Trilogy and I can tell you with one hundred percent certainty that it is nothing like them. They may both fall in the dystopian young adult genre but that’s where the similarities end. Hunger Games is an action packed series full of violence and gore while Delirium is more of a coming of age story set in a world that on the surface, seems very much like our own.<br />If the premise of the book intrigues you then I suggest you pick it up. It may not be an action packed thrill ride but it certainly doesn’t disappoint.<br /><br />Ages: 14 and up- Mature themes, violence, sexual suggestions
B001NHNG64|4.0|I enjoyed reading this Jack Reacher novel.  It still does not measure up to the first one, but it was good recreational reading.
0316066524|5.0|This is the highest literary fiction has reached since its' publication nearly twenty years ago. Never have I read such brilliant fiction, and although I'm moving on to Pynchon after finishing this novel, I'm finding it hard to not just go back to page one.. Quite easily the best novel I've ever read (although I'll admit I'm not that well read). Infinite Jest is not nearly as difficult as some reviewers have made it out to be, so if you're considering attempting to read it, go for it. You'll be glad you did.

B00AYB0TOW|4.0|The movie gave me everything I expected from it.<br />Just a good sci-fi action film.  No great plot twists or exploration of deep philosophical ideas.<br />No really great &#34;operator&#34; scenes either but the action was very good for a sci-fi movie.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|I love this game!  Needs more levels, I finished it too quick!  I love buying things for my fishtank and completing all the game.  REALLY like this one!
B005MMJ84K|5.0|So if you read my review, you know that I loved Delirium, but I was afraid that Oliver’s second book would go that way that most middle trilogy books go which is straight into the crapper. I am happy to say, I was totally wrong. I didn’t think it was possible but I think I enjoyed Pandemonium even more than it’s predecessor!  Any complaints I had about lack of “action” were more than adequately addressed in this book but that action didn’t come at the expense of character development. Hallelujah!<br />Lena has gone from naive teenager to full-blown freedom fighter in a relatively short period of time (6 months if I remember correctly) and thankfully, her transformation is believable. Unlike some other heroines of young adult dystopia (or paranormal romance), Lena does not just sit and mope for months on end after her love, Alex, dies (I’m looking at you Bella) but instead, devotes her life to protecting not only the things he believed in but also the people she herself has grown to care about. Lena is by far one of my favorite female protagonists of recent years. She isn’t “special” in any way (no super powers, no amazing fighting ability of any kind, no immunity to mind reading vampires) but she fights for what she believes in and is willing to sacrifice everything for those beliefs.<br /><br />The story centers mostly around Lena’s first official mission as part of the resistance but is told through flashbacks as well as present day experiences. At first, I found the constant time change a bit disorienting but once I got the hang of it, I started to appreciate the chapters about Lena’s first months in the Wilds. I especially liked how Oliver showed that the Wilds were not the paradise that Alex made them out to be in the first book but a place where people were free but suffering. Hunger, sickness, and the constant threat of being found hang over the residents of the Wilds every day.<br /><br />And then there was Julian. Oh Julian. I likedhim much better than Alex simply because he just didn’t seem so perfect all the time. He is, after all, the face of the pro-cure movement and his father is, for lack of a better description, a total douche. Despite all that, I found that Julian’s character was much more developed than Alex and he seemed, to me at least, much more human.<br />I’ve read some reviews that have said that the plot twists in Pandemonium were predictable and while I do agree, I think that sometimes, the way the plot twist is presented is more important than the twist itself. Even though I had a pretty strong hunch about what the “big reveal” would be at the end of the story, I still thoroughly enjoyed it. Maybe I’m just biased, but for me, knowing what was coming did nothing to take away from the experience of actually reading it in print!<br /><br />Overall, I think Pandemonium was a great sequel and if you enjoyed Delirium but thought something was lacking, I encourage you to give this book a try!<br /><br />Ages: 14 and up- Mature themes, violence
B00AMBK6J2|3.0|It was ok and I love mark w but not up to the hype.. Overall ok but just don't expect too much.
B008LZHA3G|5.0|Another great Dylan album. Still great stuff after over 50 !. Just amazing.Tempest was almost 14 minutes long but enjoyed every bit of it.<br /><br />  Stan
B0029LCJJS|3.0|Strikes me as lacking in character development and so-so writing. Too bad I have to fill this space with more.
B005MP28B2|5.0|I've wanted to see this since watching The Thin Red Line and loving how that movie struggled with reconciling the beauty and peace of nature with the violence and grotesqueries of itself.  This movie, also by Malick, looked from the trailer to have similar themes.  This time with the backdrop of an American childhood.  Well, it does and it doesn't.<br />If you're looking for a movie in any traditional sense, with a plot and a story progression, then I wouldn't look here.  The movie is more like a singular artistic statement.  It's something I would expect to see playing in a museum, like when you go to an art exhibit and around some corner there are people sitting watching a short film.<br />The movie is full of dramatic landscapes, beautiful images and really well done camera work.  You end up caring about some the characters as you explore their being.<br />I'm kind of a simple &#34;love and honor&#34; sort of guy and it's possible a lot of this movie went over my head but I felt better and re-energized somehow for watching it.
B008TMA1LY|1.0|Really disliked this game. Very difficult to play, didn't like the controls, just can't go fast enough when the game doesn't pick up a tap.

B000AJIF4E|5.0|These are hands down the most durable headphones I've ever owned. Just tonight did they go on to headphone heaven. I got these bad boys in 2004. That's 9 years of being lugged around, stretched so I can walk across the room while they are still plugged in, and stuffed in a back pack while walking through airports and such. I used to wear them when I walked back and forth to school with a portable cd player (yeah, you young bucks don't know what that is but, onward we go!). I was living in Florida so my ears and hair would sweat on them. I always worried it would ruin them but it didn't. Yeah, the &#34;paint&#34;, as I like to call it, kind of peeled off the padding but not completely and not all the way through to the white cushion. That's expected. But, just tonight did the wiring to the right can come undone. Devastation! I feel as though I need to give them a proper burial. Anyway, 9YEARS FOR $100!!!? SIGN ME UP!<br /><br />Quality you ask? Love it. They make anything you listen to sound that much better. I've mixed with them, recorded with them, and used them for casual listening. Bass and high's response is damn good. Sometimes too good for mixing though. (I know, you aren't supposed to mix in cans but sometimes you have to) They hug the ears so well that it creates a night club atop each lobe. Hence, I am looking for the same exact pair.<br /><br />Cheers, Sony!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I would recommend this product to anyone that likes dystopian futures and zombies. I liked season 2 but there were serious lags in the story. They fixed it by putting more effort into integrating action with drama in a healthy ratio. I love this series and can't wait to see the next episodes.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I love this book! One of my faves!!! &#60;3 this book is one of the bests in the series!! Thank you!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I played this many times when trying to fall asleep. Very soothing yet challenging, easy to control. Finished all the levels then went back to beat my score. Very enjoyable.
B0061S073A|1.0|Really pointless app. You would do better with the Parental Control on the device which stop's your child from much more and the screen is not some fun color that hurts your eyes. Poinless maybe that's why it's free.

B0000046KM|5.0|For all jazz lovers, this CD is a must have. Shirley Horn is great with the string arrangements by Johnny Mandel
B003O86FMW|5.0|Hey!<br />I love this book but I accidentally deactivated my account  and I don't know how to get everything back!<br />Can you help me?
B00A8ECU24|2.0|I LOVE MLP and was so thrilled to see this game, but it's really hard to get coins to fulfill the tasks, everything is really expensive and then you need to buy gems to complete some of the tasks! No thanks.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I've read some Nicholas Sparks books before and I've liked them all. I assumed they were all the same though so I didn't try to read them all. I was curious about this one and a friend urged me to read it. I'm so glad I did. It was a wonderful story. So well written. I will definetly give the rest of his books a chance. Ill probably watch this movie too!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Enjoyed this movie a lot.  Watched it with my 13 year old who had seen it before, and I think I enjoyed it just as much as she did.  The download was smooth and faultless.  Rewinding was a little awkward since we only could judge the seconds/minutes we were going back without seeing a video cue of where we were rewinding to.  Other than that, great experience.
B004VSTP4Y|5.0|The final book does not seem final. The ending is inconclusive, leaving you with your imagination as to what's next. This is nice as you can decide, but it leaves the series begging for another book. Come on Maggie, give us more!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is my favorite book! This is the best book I have ever read! It really, shows meaning!<br /><br />I rated this book on a five star because it doesn't deserve any less because it is inspirational and tells so, many, details that I'm actually, living into the book!!
B009LT1YZ6|4.0|This game is requires some coordination and concentration, it will definately keep you entertained! The kids really enjoy it too.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I, too, tend to read lighter material than this thought provoking book that was a real tear jerker....  I say thought provoking because it not only covers an issue that is very personal in many people's lives but makes one realize that however bad their situation may be, it could definitely be much worse.  Very well written; in fact, so well written that I can still imagine Lou lying next to Will in the last chapter and it will be a while before I will be able to lose this image in my brain!  Good book!  I just wish I could read a book like this without being wrung out from sobbing!
B004UID2LC|4.0|App is fast and easy.  It's an app, and it works like it is supposed to.  Not much else to say about it.
1451696191|5.0|OK, so my friends told me to read the book before renting the DVD. It is an easy read (1.5 evenings to polish it off) and I could not put it down once I started reading! If you want a book to escape your own reality for a few hours, this is the one to get! The characters were relatable, and it's easy to wrap up in these characters for a few hours! 5 stars, easily!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|A true American - a great account of what it takes to to be the best in your profession. Now that Kyle has left us,we should never forget the bravery and sacrifice he gave to our country.
1423140605|5.0|Love to see what my grandchildren are reading and I am hooked. Was disappointed to have to wait for the next book! Will order it as soon as published.
B005DOKK7Q|4.0|This is exactly what i needed, something sleek yet protective for my kindle.  This case is super durable and does not feel flimsy in the least.
1616960922|5.0|I love Sanderson's concise style, and his well thought out plots.  This is a great novella.  I recommend it to everyone.
B007JMW46U|4.0|Very well written and easy to read.  The short story format makes it convenient to read a complete story in one session.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I finished the book in a day and a half.  Couldn't put it down.  Loved that I couldn't figure out the twists i the story.
B008B68IV8|5.0|I don't know why but the Ghoulia dolls from Monster High are often the cutest of any that have come out so far.  And this one is no exception... she is absolutely adorable.  And definitely my favorite from the &#34;Travel&#34; edition of the Scaris line.
B009MCRHH6|4.0|Gets boring after a few stages,<br />Kinda creepy graphics.<br />Overall a decently challenging game<br />Good game to play during spare time.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I really liked this book. One of the better zombie book out there. It has a feel like the z war really happened. I recommend this book.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I don't like it when I keep getting requests to play games that I don't want.  the birthday thing doesn't work right.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I liked it it was interesting I liked it a lot it was very good to read better than 1st one not as good as 2nd
B003E2UQMS|2.0|Maybe it is me.Too american? Lot´s of competitive sports, wich I hate? Maybe the movie is better. Anyway, it isn´t my thing.
B009KNPPS0|4.0|I have not heard much about the songs that have been added. As far as I am concerned any recordings of EC are welcome no matter what tour they are from. I saw EC on his Slowhand. Tour in 1977. As I recall he did almost the entire Cd that night. It would have been nice to see these Live recordings included. It would have been a much better set. Along with Layla, Disraeli Gears and Wheels of fire this remains one of my favorite albums of Eric Claptons carreer. A MUST for any EC fan. One thing that really bothers me is that 5 songs from his concert are omitted. He takes these songs and puts them on the super deluxe set for an ungodly price. Of the 5 songs only 2 are worth having. One is Key to the Highway which is the best version he has ever released. The other is Nobody knows you when you are down and out.  Marcy Levy sings it. Nothing against Marcy but I would rather hear EC sing it. Ok I said it
B00514HDNW|5.0|This was really good book. It has nothing in common to the movie that was made, the book is much better.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|I can't say that this product is in any way neccesary and has you log in while the connection inside Maxthon web browser doesn't and both have about the same functions.
B008N9AAQ4|5.0|Visually breathtaking and carries you away to exotic places. Everyone will love this..This will delite your eyes and take your breath away.
B003O86FMW|3.0|This was OK. Katniss really annoys me at times. But thankfully, I have Haymitch to cheer for. SO #teamHaymitch. I read this for the FIRE Category of the What's-In-A-Name6 Challenge.
B0002KPIQY|3.0|A fair price for this movie especially if you like Angelina Jolie in the buff. Great acting but who cares.
B0047WJ12K|5.0|I enjoyed this movie COMPLETELY! Great acting and directing!<br />MUST SEE!!! The blu ray transfer is amazing. A visual treat!
B005PK56TA|5.0|This is an awesome series.  I know I am behind but I am ready to start watching season 2 of this.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Excellent piece of period history of England with all the twists and turns of real life,exciting characters showing aristocisy and their servants and how their life's entertwine.
B007THA4FI|2.0|This book just was not for me, beginning was confusing keeping up with the long character list. Small town where everyone knows everyone and all their drama. a character dies in the first few pages and the whole book is about all these people in town wanting to take his seat on the council. I did enjoy the story of the young girl taking care of her little brother while her mother was hooked on drugs. I did become very attached to her and enjoyed only the parts where she was involved, which was basically all intertwined with the other characters in the book. That was the only thing that got me though it was wanting to know what would happen to her. all the other mini stories were boring and just fluff.
B001C46P2K|5.0|Great value and quality! I love the film and it is even better in blu ray. I strongly recommend this product.
B004J4WN0I|5.0|I tend to be more of an alternate world scfi/fantasy reader.  Reading the well know series (Wheel of Time, Sword of Truth, Fire and Ice, D&D.  I tend to avoid alternate present reads, because well I enjoy world building an they don't have to focus on that as much.<br /><br />In any case my wife turned me on to the Iron Druid Series and I would say it is splendid.  It is amazingly present, to the point that things happen in the story are things that I have be around to witness and form and opinion on myself.<br /><br />The writing is engaging and easy to digest, but the author inserts a good number of old English or \\"smarted words\\" I think I have had more cause to use my kindle dictionary then I every had in any other book I have read.  This is actually pleasant to me, as I feel I am learning a bit while reading.<br /><br />The writing is standard hero in modern world must cope with a number current and historic \\"boogieman\\" and it is done with equal parts seriousness, comedy, and description.<br /><br />It is one of the rare books that I feel recharge and better after reading.  Almost a panacea against a crappy day at work.  Kudos to Kevin Hearne and is supporting network.<br /><br />The only downside would be that the books are quick reads and in the case of the kindle edition are price a bit higher than average, but at the same time they aren't putting out $20 hardback editions, so I think the price is fair.
B003VR5PPY|5.0|The concept of a visual novel game was foreign to me before I played this title but now I can really appreciate the medium. This game is basically a series of puzzles with long text segments in between, many might scoff at the idea of reading a game but it is fantastic the novel segments really make you care about the characters, and the puzzle sections make you think hard while worrying if you made the right decisions. 999 may not be the most action filled ds game but it is one of the most emotional titles on any system.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Brilliant story of a long ago imaginary country with kings fighting for sections of kingdoms with the frightening foes of the windings and the a group of undead walkers trying to come against the kingdoms . Plus the girl they cAll the dragon queen whose family once ruled the kingdoms, now in a far away land planning to come back with her dragons and reclaim her lands. Very very exciting and on the edge suspense. Love. It!
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Love Clancy. He really give you a page turner. With what is going on in China today, this novel makes you wonder just how much of it is true. Exciting from page one to the last page. Really sorry to see it end.
B004WDRT1Y|5.0|Who would have thought that after The Lion King was released 18 years ago that they could make it even better? The 3D is amazing, the picture quality is stunning and crisp, and the music comes alive in this remastered set. Definitely would recommened to family and friends! A++!
B007RI56NY|5.0|I got a kick out of 50 Ways; it got stuck in my head in a bad way and I just had to buy the album.  Now, I'm tired of that song (but still like it!  Just needs a rest) but I am enjoying the others on this album, esp. You Can Finally Meet My Mom, Mermaid and Drive By.  The kids love this one too.  It's a fun, catchy, mostly upbeat collection of songs.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This is way better than the original version. I really think that this is a must have game. That's why I rated this four stars. But I think that it is really annoying how the dude grunts over and over again when you jump and land. That's why I didn't do five stars.
B000TGJ7ZY|5.0|I can't say much about the movie, I mean it was new, wrapped so of course I was happy with the purchase, what I can say is that the seller added a personal touch the the package by thanking me for the purchase, that was pretty cool. Only that I wish I had been given a tracking number, I work for the post office so tracking my purchases is very important to me....other than that, great buy for a classic
B0076L9W9Q|5.0|This is an awsome album. I would recommend it to everyone. It has the perfect balance between songs to totaly rock out to and slower songs like Break In and Let Me In Your Room. I love it and you will too.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|This mouse is everything that I was looking for in a gaming mouse and for only a fraction of the usual price.  It looks good, it's sufficiently customizable, the weights are great, and most importantly, it feels very comfortable in my hands.  Update: 2 years later the rubber on the side of the mouse is loosening so I am looking to replace it.  Overall, it's been a great experience and great value for the price I paid.
B007M45PMU|4.0|I bought this MP3 for my husband, who loved the song \\"Ho Hey\\".  I was just going to buy that one song, but I couldn't pass up the low price of the whole MP3.  He loves it, and now I do too, after mulitple listenings.  It always takes a while for an album to grow on me, but after this one did, I am really enjoying it and listen to it a few times a week.  Browsing around on Amazon after buying this also led me to The Head and the Heart, which I really love now after buying that one as well.  It's nice to have some music that is a little different.  I usually like Death Cab, Coldplay, the Killers, etc.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|Love it but the police tern on the police sirens and lights why can't we I wish I can turn them on!
B001NLKT60|5.0|Good character building. Could not put the book down after murders occurred. Seemed to be no w a y out for the main character and then amazing conclusion. Real insight into the mental strength and skill and intelligence of the main character,Lisbeth.
B00B4VI8MQ|2.0|The game consists of hidden object in one room and puzzle in next room. There is never any doubt as to where to look as you are prompted at every moment. Not challenging. Not fun or interesting.
B00APUQH0W|4.0|Good movie, yet a little slow and predictable, but enjoyable and glad watched from home rather than at the theater.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|Could not stop watching it--wonderful cast and story.  You won't be able to watch one episode it's addictive and well worth the sleepless nights
B000NQRE1E|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies, but I did not own it on Blu-ray. Had to have it. Very happy I finally ordered it.
0802473156|5.0|I would recommend this book to all couples. It is very informative. It is not just for married couples. Very good!
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Easy but not too easy. Graphics are fairly good too. Really liked the mini games...wish there were more of them. Overall ..am getting re sequel.
B00AE2LJVS|4.0|quite a bit of violence, however enjoyed and realistic story from that era and anything Shia LaBeouf is in is worth a watch!
B0099KJFJ4|4.0|Cung le does a very good job as a ex con seeking redemption in this unique, suspenseful, and interesting actioner.  JCVD is at his very best as a melancholy convict (carrying a heavy burden) who teaches Cung Le how to learn how to fight, and redeem a neighborhood known as St. Jude Square, which is essentially run by a corrupt police force using two warring gangs to carry out their schemes and machinations (great turn by Peter Weller as the corrupt police chief).  The story has many interesting, and not altogether predictable plot twists, and unique insights, as well as little unresolved mysteries (I am sure deliberate), contained within what appears on the surface to be a simple plot.  The acting is solid, and the film well worth a look.  Hyams has really started making some interesting films as of late that leave you with a bit to think about.  The film also carries with it some truly laugh out loud funny scenes, that are in some ways a demonstration and indictment of the human condition, and a statement on the fragility of men.  Very good stuff. Big recommend on Dragon Eyes.
B00ADQPB50|5.0|Like many reviewers here, I loved Season 1, even though ghost stories and haunted house stories are a dime a dozen in the horror pantheon. The ensemble cast worked wonderfully, and the winks and nods to classics of the genre were delightful, much like hunting easter eggs in the software.<br /><br />Season 2 was a different kettle of fish altogether. Asylum was REAL horror because nearly all the story lines were grounded in the horrors committed in real life, the horrors of humanity's lack of humanity. Jessica Lange was her usual astonishing self but the real treat was the performance by Lily Rabe as she went from the sweet innocent novice nun to the demonically possessed nun with a grudge and the means to carry it out. How many women were incarcerated, either in institutions like Briarcliff or \\"sent to the nunnery\\" for daring to be daring?  With the exception of the alien storyline, all the horrors of Asylum are grounded in historical reality, and continue among us even to this day.<br /><br />From reading many of the 1- and 2-star reviews, it appears that some came to this second season to be entertained, not horrified. And when, to their horror, they *were* horrified, they ran with tails tucked between their legs, throwing imprecations like \\"torture porn\\" over their shoulders as they averted their eyes from the real-life horrors unfolding on their small (or big) screen TVs.<br /><br />There were so many brilliant moments in this second season, from story arcs to character development to cinematography and visual references to some of the great horror films and filmmakers. I cannot wait to see what Season 3 will offer. I expect it to be a bit lighter in tone, shedding Zachary Quinto who is mostly a one-note actor and bringing back the sweetly intense Taisa Farmiga. With nearly all the ensemble cast returning to play new characters, I know I can count on thrilling, chilling performances, great storytelling, and thought-provoking commentary on horror in America.<br /><br />Two thumbs up ( I'd give it more but unlike one of Dr. Arden's experiments, I only have two thumbs to give).

B0063M22QO|5.0|Love This Great Game!! I enjoy playing this game! It really relaxes me!! I Highly Recommend This Game to anyone!!
B00ARAO720|2.0|Sad waste of talent, it was interesting to learn that messengers develop &#34;Bullet Time&#34; skills to avoid being splattered by a truck or splattering a woman with her baby carriage.
B002ZG99TA|5.0|We love this movie.  It's realistic, very few language issues and Washington and Pine are very believable in their roles.  The fact it is based on a true story makes it more of a thriller.  Our grandkids, 8 and 10, have watched it approx. 10 times to date.  Well worth the money.
B00BGDF1FO|5.0|We just finished Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance a few days ago and loved it, we had to have the boss battle themes! This soundtrack has all of the boss themes with vocals plus instrumental remixes for each.<br /><br />The music for Revengance is an awesome mix of heavy rock and dubstep; normally I'm a huge dubstep hater but this is so well done and not at all the usual farty-annoying noises that I've become so used to hearing branded as dubstep. I'd highly recommend this to anyone who enjoyed the game and even to those who haven't played the game but just like hard rock.
B0089XH38M|1.0|I uninstalled. I was not happy with it. It scanned then would say not responding check again at a later time . I got rid of it fast . Not happy at all.

B002PMV9K6|5.0|Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince is a fantastically well done and richly satisfying movie. Here,we see the darkest and most mature Harry Potter movie of the 1st 6 by far. The charm and innocence of Sorcerer's Stone that so defined Sorcerer's Stone is completely gone now. Harry is growing up and preparing himself to take on his greatest challenges yet. As those who have read the book know,Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince really has 2 important storylines to it. On one hand,Half Blood Prince is a backstory story where we learn more about Voldemort's past. At the same time,Half Blood Prince is also a setup story as the events that occur in Half Blood Prince in real time are setting up the events of Deathly Hallows. The film does a brilliant job of bringing those things to life. I was especially happy with the depiction of the day Dumbledore first met the young Tom riddle. That was a scene the filmmakers nailed. I was also very pleased with the way the circumstances of the Half Blood Prince's book were handled,both in terms of that 1st Potions lessons and in the scene where Harry is forced to get rid of it.Then the acting was superb. Daniel,Rupert,Emma,and Alan have mastered their characters by this movie. And Michael Gambon gives his best performance as Dumbledore in this movie,particularly in the many scenes in which he and Harry are alone together, Finally,I was immensely satisfied with the climax. Apart from the presentation of the events themselves,the emotional aspects of the climax hit the heart for me. Even after many viewings,I get teary eyed when Dumbledore dies and when the students are all raising their wands in tribute to him. This is a very poignant time for Hogwarts. In this movie,Dumbledore is preparing Harry for what lies ahead as events culminate in the climax that sets up the major war in Deathly Hallows. My only criticisms are that they should have included the memory where that witch shows Voldemort the Cup and Locket so they,as Horcruxes that become important in Deathly Hallows, would be properly introduced in this movie. That memory should have been in the movie instead of the Ron-Lavender and Dean-Ginny stuff,which should have been cut from the movie (and the book) because it added NOTHING to the plot.  Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince is a deeply rewarding movie that MUST get 5 stars.s that become important in Deathly Hallows, would be properly introduced in this movie.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|i think temple run 2 is way better than temple run 1.i wish you could trade gems for money though.the graphics are GREAT.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I can't wait for the second season to be released. This is a tight political thriller that presented some surprise moves that just propelled the series to another level.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|would recommend this product. Price was reasonable and it functions well. Would buy it again. Sturdy cover for the price.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|Love this season and all the other season all worth watching. I was able to watch it right on my computer or on my tv love it!
B006X415GK|5.0|Got this doll for one of my twin granddaughters, She loved it, my granddaughters do not play with other dolls, not even barbies. they love monster high, i have given both girls the monster high dolls and they love them. they play with them for hours.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love this game.but whenever i go to do the daily challenge i have to wait until 7:00.very creative.like i said love this game.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|I decided to read this because friends of ours had a daughter who commited suicide.  And while every person's reasons are different, this at least gave the reader insight as to what the children were thinking.  As adults we always wonder why.  This story told of the few reasons that were weighing on the young lady.<br /><br />As parents we need to encourage our children to talk with us about anything.  And we need to be mindful of the unintentional pressures we put on our kids.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|nice game, a little short. multiple hidden object mini games along with a story line. decent graphics. ive played better but still a nice game
B00A6VAW9W|5.0|This CD is so much fun! It puts me in a good mood and energizes me. I often put it on when I exercise - some of the songs are fast enough to run with on the treadmill. I saw Blue Sky Riders on a morning news program and couldn't wait until the CD came out. These three singers harmonize so well. I always liked Kenny Loggins, and this CD doesn't disappoint.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a great game because it uses up time you have to waste! I had it for two days and unlocked all of the people! lets just say it's very addicting! I would know because I am addicted!
B0058VW36U|5.0|I LOVE OM NOM!!!!!!he is the cutest thong ever.i've got past all of yhe seasons and i love a good challenge.i have also seen all of the videos.REALLY CUTE!!!!!!!!  :P
B005K17RU0|5.0|I had a weather app that i used before i got this one.  I love this one, and use it all the time.  When planning hiking excursions, this is great.  I also supervise people who work outside, and this app helps me make sure theycan be safe.  I love the radar option.  Great app.
B009LGO88E|5.0|My son loved it.!!! . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . kk
B0063M22QO|4.0|This is a good idle time passer. I don't have to think too hard and have the satisfaction of completing the level.
0061989142|5.0|My daughter wanted this. She loves Lauren Conrad so this was a great Christmas gift. Very good quality and great pictures
B005K17RU0|5.0|I like to switch from Florida to my home in the north very easily to keep up with what is happening at home
B007IXWKUK|3.0|There was a couple of moments when I was wondering what next, but not many. The book was an ok read for me. I give three stars.
B002XXLKHY|4.0|Will Ferrell funny and sweet....at times you laugh til you cry.  Zoey Decshenal, too.  It's a new Christmas family classic.
B00846F1YW|4.0|I like that it isn't just a search and find game. I like that it has other type of game play.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was a great book to read it was hard to put down I loved and now ready to see the movie
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love the game. I want everyone to play it.So everyone play Subway Surfers. Also rate the game. It's awesome.
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|This remake of the Arnold movie has good special effects and action throughout. Good way to spend the afternoon. Worth seeing.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|The movie was excellent in carrying the theme of an addict's journey and path back to his integrity. It showed classic examples of denial, enablement and ultimately acceptance. LUV'd IT!
B00B5HQL50|5.0|Great action throughout the movie. I think Daniel Craig is the best of all the Bond's. If you haven't seen it yet you are missing a real treat.
B000VDDWDS|5.0|This is one of my most favorite films of the sea and sailing ships. It truly transports one into an adventurous  time. And it is an excellent story told from superb directing, photography, set and art direction, and not the least, acting. This is a classic.<br /><br />My only regret is that there is no second film (hint, hint)!
B005CKPQNE|4.0|I'm a latecomer to this series. Netflix got me hooked on the first three seasons and Amazon Instant Video kept me hooked on the 4th. I've since begun watching the series the old-fashioned way: as it's on the T. V.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|This book is lame<br />Dbshshshsjs<br />Agsgshshshshshshshsydhdhdjdhdudud his Shah disks hahaha shaken shaken soaps apps slavish sons admonishes snags skydive shrugged enshrined disputed discovery widget eighth
B007R3BFR0|4.0|Great to have a new Garbage album! Very polished, and very well done. Putting this on, you can easily transition from Version 2.0 to this. They fit together well. If you loved 2.0, you'll love this.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|Consumed very little time, I could not get use to the controls maybe good for someone a little bit younger.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Great film, great conclusion. The villain is a beast. What more do you need to know? It's freakin' Batman. If you haven't watched the other films, you might need to catch up. As for special features, they went a little lighter than I would have liked.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Here's a novel where the reader cannot determine who the villain is until more than halfway through. Truth be told. there are really no good guys but one person stands out worse than all the rest!
B004X2M9VY|5.0|One of the best seasons ever = )<br />If you have not watched it do so soon while you wait for season7.
B00A4EDAN6|5.0|My favorite T&S album, been playing this nonstop! Every song is a gem. It is definitely more pop than the previous albums, and every song deserves to be a radio hit. It's short, but it's sweet, and is the best album I've heard in a long time!
B005I6EU7U|5.0|This cover really looks nice. The fit of the Kindle is just as it should be. Happy this is the one I purchased.
0307887448|5.0|I would have to say that Ready Player One is one of the few good novels I have read this year. The amount of references to the eighties and all things geek in this novel actually made me feel like I was a part of the story. Also, the characters seemed to be interesting and real. The far future is bleak, but Oasis is not. I definitely can't wait for Armada.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|This represents a finely crafted blend of action, intellectual stimulation, joy and pain.<br /><br />Being referred by a friend, I will do likewise for all I call same.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app is really good in so many ways.Now I can check my battey level just by checking my notification.Really good app,thanks guys.
B00A2LOAKI|5.0|Fans of the book will love the animation.  One of the best graphic novels even written in my opinion.  Definitely not for kids
B005IQ39AY|5.0|What a fun game for all ages, helps you to study the colors and look for the best shots to get the best scores and yes all ages can play this.
B00A2H9LK6|4.0|Silent Hill Revelation was a good sequel to the first film. I didn't actually realize they were completely connected until twenty minutes or so into the movie. This is a direct sequel set a few years after the first. I don't want to ruin anything, but the Silent Hill fans will be happy come the end of this movie. Watch it!
1451695195|5.0|I was most impressed that a man of science could be so strongly influenced by his out-of-body experience.  That's a most unusual situation.
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|great movie, a must have if you are a Final Fantasy fan, comes with more scenes and extras, I am very happy with this purchase and glad iI did so
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved reading this book.  It really kept me enthralled and I couldn't put it down.  I've never been a huge reader so to finish a book so fast was an accomplishment and a testament for the story lines of this book.
B000MQRE4C|5.0|There is something uniquely subtle about this film that Stanley Kubrick has achieved in that the viewer feels that he is seeing the pace of the 18th century characters come to life and how people lived and interacted with each other.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|The game downloaded fine, but when I try to open it it takes me right back to my home screen. I even had to force restart my tablet because of trying to open it. I have played the other Angry Birds games and they work fine, though. So I suggest downloading the other versions of Angry Birds.
0316228532|2.0|I had not read any of J. K. Rowling's previous books, which I knew had been extremely popular in different age groups, therefor I was expecting something much more interesting.  I read probably no more than the first 3 or 4 chapters & decided it was not going to hold my interest.
030758836X|1.0|I enjoyed the book until it switched to just Amy and not her diary.  I thought the characters were shallow and unbelievable and unlikable.  I also thought their actions were way over the top and the fact that the author chose to pass the insanity on to the next generations was a cop out.  Don't bother.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved reading this book.  It really kept me enthralled and I couldn't put it down.  I've never been a huge reader so to finish a book so fast was an accomplishment and a testament for the story lines of this book.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|It a good album, but not sure the songs are the best type of music for josh.  No my favorite work.. If you like Josh you will like it.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|It's a . Ok game good for kindle needs to be on other tablet is fun but I wish you could race horses
0060558121|4.0|Not quite what I expected.  It comes together well at the end.<br /><br />I am not a science fiction reader, and I would not put this in that genre.<br /><br />It is many stories interwoven throughout in an easy red manner.
B000I5X81K|5.0|well all I can say is I love Josh Groban's music and voice. CD shipped and worked well , with no problems.
B003R5C5JE|4.0|my cousin got me this model car for my brirthday and me being a huge back to the future fan i never owned the car before so i love this little car...any fan should have one of these in their collection at their home or office...its not the best car out there but its def nice to have especially if you a fan like myself...plus is not that expensive..i your looking for something more detailed or that lights up or something look elsewhere and be ready to spend 100 bucks for that one but for those looking to not spend so much and still have a delorean in their home(atleast untill we can afford the one that lights up or the real delorean) then this is the right car for you..also good for kids over 5..
B0007TKNII|5.0|This movie provides an interesting view of what may go on behind the scenes of major artistic productions such as this one.
0061906220|5.0|Thanks!<br />It is exactly what I was wanting and the price was not too bad.  I would love to see where you could buy all of Pete's books together.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|This game would not install on my tablet. I don't know what to do as I could not find any help. I got this free. But I would still like to be able to play it on my tablet.
B0000CFW87|5.0|this is a great CD​, a great combination of his great songs. Shipped well, no problems with the function of DVD.
0810970686|5.0|What Grandparent does not want his offspring to enjoy reading? It is a huge key to learning. My 7 year old grandson has read two of these already and I bought him two more....he is so excited to get a new book, and reads very well for his age...I want it to continue.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|i have all three of them all three seasons in each year i hope they are making more seasoning 4 5 6???
0142403873|5.0|My 3 year old son loved it, he laughs out loud every time when I read it to him.  It is funny and clever. One of the best children books every.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved this book so much! One of my favorite Nicholas Sparks books. I recommend for everyone to read this book.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|It's such a treat to watch a tv program with great writing, acting, sets and costumes. Having lived through the 60's , I remember how it was and this show captures it perfectly. If you have not seen it yet, I suggest starting at the beginning, if only to see the progression of the characters and the big change in society as it moves along into the late 60's.

B0006A9FKA|5.0|what a crazy weird movie  but it not for me for my son hee hee thank you.... never care for goofy movies.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I have really gotten addicted to this game I just wish we didn't have to buy so many acorns to finish. it would be nice to make them cheaper
B00003JRCQ|5.0|The best version I have seen of this movie; excellent actors, true to the Austen's story.  I have seen other versions where the acting is not as good.  These actors appear in many great BBC film series.
B0011UJMK2|5.0|I love this book. Very interesting to learn about this time in history and how people lived and died.  I could not put this book down and when I did I could not wait to get back to it. All the twists and turns of this story kept me glued to it.<br />Normally I do not like killing & violence in books but this had a real story behind it.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Fun but hangs far too often at the splash screen and has annoying full screen ads. Sort it out NaturalMotion Games.
B006FO3ERQ|5.0|This is my first experience with this author but believe me when I say I will soon be back for more.  In part, this is a coming of age novel in the spirit of Hemingway.  The language is often spare, reminiscent of the landscape it describes but it is always thought provoking.  In addition to being a gripping tale, the book explores the complexities of family relationships and the depth of the human spirit.
B000002J03|5.0|What can you say about Led Zep 2 Wanna know the definition of hard rock? Play it. Page,Plant, Jones and Bonham set the bar. They rank up there as there own like the Beatles & the Stones...Sure, bands like ACDC, Van Halen, Aerosmith etc. are great, but it doesn't get any better than Led Zep
B008OOYALE|5.0|Love this game! I've been playing for over 3 months now and still check in every day. No reason to pay for anything in game if you are patient.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is a pretty fun game! The only problem is getting the horse to have enough energy to train. It keeps telling me come back or give more treats. I have done both and it stills says come back later.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This is a very good game that keeps you trying and trying to get farther. You just want to always exceed your prior distance.
B006LSZECO|3.0|It was fun figuring it out questioning reality throughout.  Not totally shocked or surprised at the outcome but satisfied with it overall.
B000JML90Y|4.0|Classic book and it was free.  What else do people want.  Beggars can't be choosers (that's what my Ma always said).
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I love this book so much it's like no other I have read all three books three times lol but I would like to say to Elle James that she is the s*** for writing these books and I can't wait for the movie...........
B009VLX8FS|5.0|We bought this CD to download onto her brand new MP3 player for Christmas. Needless to say, she was absolutely wow-ed when she found out that Taylor Swift was already on there! She has listened to this CD practically every day since Christmas, so I would say she gives it 5 stars!!
B0086700CM|4.0|This game got me hooked to playing it after my first time.  I have fun when playing this gamebevery time I play it.
B0094K1WZE|5.0|There is a finer art and a creative work in making movies and in titles like these, with almost name brand recognition there is a standard to exceed. And Cruise with his team nailed it on this production. Memorable!
B000JQUZCI|4.0|Classic book and it was free.  What else do people want.  Beggars can't be choosers (that's what my Ma always said).
1451695195|4.0|This book gave a different approach to the out of body experience . There were a lot of techincal/medical explanations that were a bit above me..but that was to be expected as a neurosurgeon wrote it.
140123769X|3.0|I hate spoilers, incidentally, there won't be any in this review. If you're looking at reviews of the 18th book in the series, you probably already like it. But overall, the following was my impression of this one:<br /><br />Cubs in Tyoyland takes a couple dark turns for the worse. Suffice to say, there's a lot of suffering found within. While I'm always excited to get my hands on this series, this one put me in a foul mood after reading. At the same time, I can't help but think, things can only get better from here and at least the worst parts are already over. Guess I'll find out if that true with the next one.
B003Y5HWJU|4.0|Another hit for HBO! Although I must say very graphic almost to graphic. I don't know why, these shows feel they can't leave anything to the audiences imagination. I give this show only 4 stars because the director felt they needed to be over graphic to hold it's audience, where the story itself is a winner! This is where the old stand by &#34;less is best&#34; holds true.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I hav e pictures of my grandchildren, sitting side by side on our e-readers.  We sometimes  have to pull them off just to eat a meal or participate in somehting that is non electronic/
B000FC1HBY|4.0|I really like the series.  Nice layout for Kindle.  Maps are hard to flip to, but just bookmark it and you get used to it.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Great game time passing game love working towards the levels wish there were ways to get free coins when I run out.
1451695195|5.0|While in a deep coma, this doctor who had no faith in the afterlife, had an amazing journey. It all made sense to me, and the fact that he previously didn't believe in brain survival or life after death, made it quite intriguing.
B008CRC506|5.0|Love the cast and love the story line. If you like musicals, this is a winner!! It's a plus for your personal DVD library.
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|Mystery series fans & fans of ABC's Castle will enjoy this series! This is the second in the series, so make sure you read Heat Wave first for context.
B000JQU1VS|4.0|Classic book and it was free.  What else do people want.  Beggars can't be choosers (that's what my Ma always said).
B009UNGYHG|5.0|It works perfect and I always have messed up my earpeices before.  This makes it to where I don't mess it up, and can charge at the same time. It is very durable as well.
1609611543|5.0|Astounding information regarding wheat and blood sugar that I found fascinating! Although a bit technical, it was a very interesting read.
B0051E9INK|5.0|I love this movie, and just feel that they should have taken their motto to heart: &#34;There can be only one!&#34;  The series and movies that followed cannot hold a candle to the original movie.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I found it very challenging and enjoyed trying to get faster and faster at solving it. Thank you for offering it as a free app.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|There are so many stories out there on the subject of spousal abuse, I think I could have written this one myself, although Nicholas Sparks has a great style for putting words together.  You feel the heat of a hot summer day at the fair, and the fear Katie is experiencing.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|I'm inspired to pursue my personal legends. And pay attention to the omens. But most of all to pray and be still sometimes
0321344758|5.0|This book is good for beginners graphic designers. It teaches it tricks and methods to create a navigable and user friendly templates. It is easy to read and gets straight to the point. Lots of good tips.
B004DM0UII|5.0|I thought this would be like all the rest... it is not! Fast buffing.. not sure how it does it... but it rocks.  Easy to search and save. Highly Recommended
B004TI5N38|4.0|As usual Balducci's style keeps you interested from the first line thru the end of this book.  Excellent read and well worth your time.  The characters are well developed and seem to fit into the story and follow the series of these books very well.  I recommend this to Balducci fans.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|great game for little girls!! game works great on my kindle! have never gad any problems with this game!  keeps my little one happy!
1558908498|5.0|THIS IS A BIRTHDAY GIFT FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS DOWN THE ROAD.  WE HOPE IT IS JUST WHAT HE WANTS.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very cute game for all ages.  Challenges you to save your money and purchase different farms and supplies for your horse.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This was my first 3D movie, and it did not disappoint. I've purchased many since then, and none have the great story, great special effects, and great 3D. Highly Recommended!
B006VFLIYK|3.0|At first I thought I would really enjoy this story as it was different for this character and certainly a less tense setting.  However, I found the premise of the story somewhat lacking and as expected as you kept reading the book.  As the novel developed it really went very slow.  I kept wanting to get it over with and move onto to another more exciting Balducci novel.  The characters were okay but very predictable.  I could almost tell the end of the book before I read it.  It is an okay read for the beach or any other place where you can handle distractions and easily go back knowing where this story goes.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This game is really good g5 did great a game I would exspect from thrm I will be buying the full game.
B003O86FMW|3.0|I recently finished this book.  it is a decent teen sci fi fantasy book, it was not as good as the first
B008D28HYS|5.0|I have CrossMe so when CrossMe Color app was available free I had to get it. I can't wait for the next updates
B003EI2EH2|3.0|While this book is an entertaining read, I doubt it is good advice.  Many more qualified than I have slammed it for lack of scientific method, which I think is a valid issue.  The sorts or reckless experiments the author indulges in have a kind of &#34;Darwin Awards&#34; charm, but that's about it.<br />As a principle, &#34;attempt to get the most gain from the least amount of effort&#34; may be sound and worth taking a look at, but the actual advice in the book just doesn't work.<br />My partner and I, following a basic low glycemic method have each lost fifteen pounds in the last year--he a bit more than that.  Lots of vegetables, sensible portions, ride the bike, stay away from sugar.  It was easy to do.  When we stalled after the holidays we tried this method as an alternative.  We found it both restrictive and essentially unproductive for weight loss or muscle gain.<br />Altering your diet is a delicate social and emotional balance, and rather than like a lifestyle The Four Hour Body is like following a bus schedule.  Eat this now!  Make sure to eat this later! Never anything white!  The huge amount of protein advocated actually packs a bunch of calories and fat.  It's almost impossible to get around too much focus on food when required to eat six times a day very specific things.<br />Bottom line?  Loved the read, went back to the old more sensible method and have shed the Christmas gain and back on track.
B00AQ71FLK|4.0|love this game would of gave 5 stars but controls little hard to use and game lags at times but all and all good game
0767836324|5.0|purchased for grand daughter who is currently reading the variety of stories on Peter Pan. She couldn't wait to watch it with her Dad the same night. Product arrived quickly and in great shape for a used DVD.
B003L16FAE|5.0|I love the fact that older movies that I love are getting released on Blu Ray. This movie looks amazing and sounds awesome. I've seen it around 50 times and I'm sure to see it 50 more!
B005LAJ212|5.0|I love this series and I'm addicted. My case was cracked when I got it but it's not a big deal. The dvds were in good condition.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this app. My family and I love the time trial part woe we can se who can do the most puzzles in 30 secs or 1 min. Its fun and addictive and can getvery challenging.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|Powerful and brilliantly written. Not all in the book club loved it, although most did. All agreed it was worthy as a book club book. Lots of discussion.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|We finally tried Downton Abbey and watched Season 1 (several hours worth) in 2 days - TOTALLY HOOKED!<br />'Loved Season 2 as well (following weekend!).  We were ecstatic to find Season 3 at a reasonable price on Amazon.<br />Thank you, once again for having what we want, when we want it, Amazon!
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Show how drugs and alcohol can affect the lives of everyone. Not a movie to watch if you have a flight coming up the next day.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|This is one of those awesome girl powered movies that the guys in the room will still find funny enough to watch it with you!  Plus, the music is SOOO great!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great game and fun to play. Can play this game for hours on my kindle. Can resume where u left off when you have to exit out and come back.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its really fun and addicting many people like it especially me. Its cool and new it glitches sometimes but its still totally rad.
B00271HAK8|4.0|I forgot how funny this movie was. The language wasn't too bad and I looked at the obvious character flaws as a teaching opportunity. The humor made that easy.<br /><br />Appropriate for older teens and adults.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|My 10-and 12-year-old boys are both enthusiastic readers, but their reaction to this book was over the top. They were late for meals, late to bed, and pretty much didn't do anything other than read once they got their hands on it. They both evangelized it to me and insisted I read it as well, and I can understand why. We've been talking about it ever since (weeks now).<br /><br />Palacio has an extremely authentic voice for a first-time novelist. She so effectively makes (main character) August's struggles real, accessible, and universal. I would recommend this book to any middle-school-aged child struggling with feelings of alienation, loneliness, or feeling &#34;different&#34;--which is to say, pretty much every middle schooler! My kids really related to August, and I related to the mother. One of my children has special needs, so the book especially resonated for me, but I truly think it would for both typical and atypical families. Highly recommended.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I rated this game 5 stars because It's graphics are great and many of the puzzle sets are free, as is the sets manager.  The many different sets available at the maker's site are either free or no more than 2 or 3 dollars.  You can buy at the game site and pay via Amazon.  Best  of all, it works just great on my Kindle Fire.  Many hours of fun and a huge variety of puzzles make this my favorite Kindle game.  Be sure to enter your credit card on Amazon's Kindle one-click page.
B0086QS7N2|5.0|This album is just simply awesome.  They have improved so much over Vapor Trails and this is a continuing example on how to continue to put out new material.
B009EEFTMC|3.0|Great time waster...really beautiful graphics, pretty colors. I really enjoy racing my previous time. Only downside: you can't see all your previous times, just the last one. Not a Twitter fan, so that's not appealing.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Recently I was running out of space on my FIre. I have on very large game loaded, and I wanted to load a second game but I did not have enough free memory. So I bit the bullet and started deleting apps, but my available memory was not increasing like I thought it would. Through the use of this app, I realized that even though I was uninstalling apps, cached, and downloaded data from those apps was lingering on the kindle, and taking up precisous memory space! Once I started clearing that data through the use of ES File Explorer my available memory jumped back up and I was able to juggle my apps accordingly.
B00BB8SKPW|5.0|Kept me glued to TV! The flight was very realistic. One of Denzel's best. Enlightened me to what happens after an airline crash.
B00BB8SKPW|1.0|Unfortunately I never got to view the movie in its entirety the obscene words and nudity at the beginning of the movie prevented me from completing the movie. Why do moviemakers insist on ruining what might be good films with so much immorality?
B0090SI42Y|1.0|was not a good movie. i never write a review but this movie was so bad i had to. rza can not act worth a damn
B005IQ39AY|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this game. I play it every day, several times a day. YOu know you have it bad when you turn the volume down on your device so no one can hear you playing it. Surprisingly fun and addictive!
B0023SDPS6|5.0|I have never read anything by Longmire, but I plan to remedy that by reading the rest of his work. This is an excellent book--strong characters, well drawn, wonderfully evoked setting, and the Indian history and lore is fascinating, every bit as good as Tony Hillerman's work.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Pretty good game. owning a horse is a lot better though. The graphics really aren't that bad. I don't know what else to say
B007DIQC90|5.0|Each and every song has a drive to it. The underlying rhythms invoked the same kind of excitement as say Enya or other Celtic type of music.  I found them to be refreshing, new and uplifting. Don't change a thing.
B005S9EKCW|2.0|Having loved the Broadway production of this show I was truly anticipating watching the movie. Everything was going great until Hugh Jackman opened his mouth in song. Even Russell Crowe was able to squeak by in his baritone role and Anne Hathaway was all the rave for hanging on to her high notes while in closeup mode but unfortunately, for  me, that was not enough. Grat story, beautiful music, good costuming, but unfortunately too much of a poor voice.
B004BCNVOA|5.0|Excellent choice!!! If you're a P!NK fan, you'll love it. Unfamiliar with P!NK, buy this. You'll find yourself listening to it over and over
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Loved it!! Each book keeps you in anticipation. Definitely a series I would read again and again. You won't be sorry.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Movie about a man who can't (or won't) acknowledge his problems and the results of this stubborness.  It was well acted and presents a lot of food for thought.
B008NW67E0|5.0|Regarding with the songs that i've been down load to my computer is very nice and i love it thank you so much..
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|At this late pre-Oscar hour there is speculation that Argo may be the one to beat. It is not only a well made movie but a real life thriller Sometimes it is difficult to tell where real life documentary ends and movie begins. It is unfortunate that it is a recreation of such a dark episode in our history but we cannot change that. I felt the acting was great,the story was both educational (about the event) as it was entertaining and thrilling. I can't speak for others but these are the reasons I go to movies and this one fills the bill. I will be watching Sunday to see if it makes it to the top!
B001ANSSDC|4.0|It's nice reminder how people see themselves and how usually the other see them. I liked the way the story is told. I especially liked the description of footbal games (not a fan myself though) as a passion and this bonding
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is the most inspirational, educational, and addictive app ever! I love it! I have learned how to save money making my own cleaning products, upcycling, found some fabulous recipes and craft projects.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|If you like horror stories this one is it.  It keeps you going.  I can't wait for season 3.  I highly recommend this show if you like excitement.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Amazing Book! Great Follow Up Story To The First Book.<br />Gripping Story Line! Recommended Book For All! Author Has<br />Such A Way Of Telling The Story You'll Feel Like Your Really There!
B00AY7Q01C|5.0|Great story and very moving.  A few things were left out to create some drama, but still a lovely story.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Thank you for a trilogy with a never ending story. True to emotions and insanely hard to put down. Wow.
B0044FEZBC|3.0|The amazing, heart pounding sound from the strong orchestra will send shivering to your spine.<br /><br />The dance is fast paced and full of energy, with amazing precision, dazzling jumps and endless whirlwind twisting. It can't get any better on the technical part.<br /><br />With that being said, sometimes I felt the pace is uneven, the ballroom dance is, frankly, quite boring.<br /><br />Natalia Osipova is such a strong character, she is confident, decisive, sometimes I feel that part is little overdone. She definitely looks like a dancing machine, instead of a human! In some dances she jumped ahead of the partner. I wish she has more opportunity to show more emotional skills.<br /><br />Comparing to Natalia, Nina Kaptsova is very delicate, and I find she shows the deep emotion beautifully. She also did a fantastic job in the Nutcracker performance.<br /><br />I do wish they put a bigger picture of Natalia on the cover, as Natalia is as good as Ivan.
B0061S073A|2.0|App it difficult to maneuver....it does keep my locked in to the apps I want him to access but it difficult to get out of for me when I want to exit.  It's extremely irritating.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|&#34;In the ruins of a place once known as North America lies the nation of Panem, a shining Capitol surrounded by twelve outlying districts. The Capitol is harsh and cruel and keeps the districts in line by forcing them all to send one boy and one girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen to participate in the annual Hunger Games, a fight to the death on live TV. Sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen, who lives alone with her mother and younger sister, regards it as a death sentence when she is forced to represent her district in the Games&#34;<br /><br />Amazing Book!! Recommend For All
0307595579|5.0|Got these for My sister's b-day, everything was shipped on time.  She was happy with the  product and had no issues
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|Wasn't sure from the previews if this was going to be one of those movies where all the good, funny parts are in the previews but it turned out to be a &#34;hoot&#34;!!  Could of got it cheaper from Redbox but couldn't be bother to run out so I streamed it.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I just discovered Ken Follett this year and am really enjoying catching up on his writing. Excellent page-turner - am wanting book 3!
B001UTW7QU|4.0|I was a little iffy on continuing to watch the series after the first few episodes because the show hadn't really grabbed me yet.  But there is definitely a big payoff towards the end of the first season that makes it all worth it.  Similar to LOST, the more you can suspend your disbelief and just enjoy the twists and turns the creators are throwing at you, the more you will enjoy the series.
B0086700CM|1.0|I would get tempel run 2 this game is too easy for me!! I would not get it  is a wast of time. I think tempel run does not have good sound effects so take my advise I have it do not get IT!!
B0000549B0|5.0|I had the immense pleasure of meeting Jimmy Stewart many years ago and have always enjoyed all his movies.  Harvey has always been a great movie and I wanted a copy of it.
B0013D6LEM|5.0|An oldie but a goodie. Would reccommend to all my friends. I love love loved it. Amazing. Speechless. Breathtaking. Loved it
B008L1F91A|5.0|Can't wait to see the others. Love the colors and the detail. The whole set together will look great. Looking forward to purchasing the other figures.
B009GX69RK|5.0|Hands down one of the funniest shows on television.  While every character has their moments, Nick and Schmidt are the heart of the show and manage to steal every scene, sometimes back and forth from each other.
B004SJ3AXI|2.0|GET IT :)!! IF U DO NOT LIKE IT U R CRAZY!!! Not a wast of time so get it or u r walking away from something good so take my advise!!:) also easy so cool . Awesome birds!! !!!!!!!!
B0055SWM08|5.0|Wonderful game that I love to do as I am winding down for the evening. The music makes it! Nicely done.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I love when people concern themselves with forwarding themselves and their loved ones. Tina shares her joy and pain while handling the stress of critics in such a graceful and humane manner. I like her even more.
B005WUHAX8|3.0|It was awesome for the first week and a half then the bottom part that locks in to keep water out of the charger port broke off....now I'm looking for another case...
B000007492|5.0|I really like this CD as it has the most popular Supertramp songs that I have always loved. If you are looking for a CD that has the most popular songs and are not looking to simply gain &#34;personal expertise&#34; on a group by getting all their many albums this CD is what you are looking for. That is what I really look for in most of my CDs. I love lots of different kinds of music - not just one person or group - and I insist on keeping a collection of many songs and many artists. That is what works best for me and if that is what you seek as well this is definitely for you.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love to play it for fun when I am board one thing I would like too change is having two lives!! -dancergirl 1234
B002JWD6AS|5.0|I loved this book will probably read it a lot more times in the future. Um getting the next one soon
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I'm not much of a book person, I usually like movies and games more but this book is a fun read, especially as a person interested in Sci-Fi and outer space. This has been a good read, and has kept me engaged long enough to want to finish it.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|love this app! I use this on a daily basis. Its perfect for my 7 and 9 year old to use also!
B000000OTU|5.0|Really love this CD. Love to listen to this group as they rock my whole place and I find myself singing along and dancing to the beat. If you are seeking to do that with some of the best rythym around you then this is definitely a CD you would love too.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This story is so great! Really makes you think about things. I will definitely be rereading this book again and again!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Goodbye Edward Cullen, hello Christian Grey! Definitely not what I was expecting, but all in all an amazing book. I could not put it down.
B004OZOTSQ|5.0|This was exactly what I needed.  It solves the problem of simple data transfers to my Android.<br /><br />Although not intended to be such it also present a nice view of what the Android hard drive looks like.
B004XNGKBS|5.0|Does what is necessary for a note taker.<br />Hand written.<br />Exportable.<br />Sharable.<br />Fast...<br />I recommend this app to all looking for a sharp note taker.
B00B2DSIAI|5.0|This is a great movie to watch with your kids.  It has so much in it to keep the parents entertained and it is movie about games, what kid doesn't love playing video games!
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|The movie was interesting from the beginning to the end. It was funny and had lots of action. Will watch again in the future
B0083Z614S|5.0|i rated it with all 5 because i have always love the book yes i will tell people to read the book
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was a wonderful read.<br /><br />It did have a good ending to some extent, but since finishing I've felt 'down in the dumps' and feel a little sad. The book is so jam packed full of strong emotions and darkness that I feel like I need a happy read to go to.<br /><br />Colleen Hoover is an absolutely incredible writer. I read Slammed and POR months ago and still think about them regularly. When I heard she was releasing a new book, as a stand alone, I knew I needed to get it as soon as I could and I wasn't disappointed.<br /><br />The story starts out with a 17 year old Sky starting out a new high school. Everything about it is new to her as she has never attended any type of school before. She doesn't own a mobile phone, there is no TV in her house and she's never had access to the internet. To say she's coming from the dark ages would be an understatement! She lives alone with her adoptive mother Karen. Just the two of them.<br />After school one day she meets Holder, the beautiful, amazing Holder, who changes her life completely. She fights her feelings for him, she seems to think he is bad news but regardless of all that her attraction is too strong.<br /><br />Soon things start to unravel around Sky and all of a sudden she's left wondering who she really is. Every person in her life she thought she could trust, suddenly seems not so trustworthy. She has to make some life changing decisions that could potentially rip everything away from her that she has ever known.<br /><br />I felt everything in this book. Like I said, I ended it feeling very sad. I shed a few tears and just reveled in these feeling, it takes a great author to pull those emotions out of me and Colleen managed it perfectly. It wasn't always an easy read but I am so glad I read it.<br /><br />This was without a doubt my favourite quote in the whole book, and so so true.<br /><br />\\"It's real, Six. You can't get mad at a real ending. Some of them are ugly. It's the fake happily ever afters that should p you off.\\"<br /><br />I think sometimes we forget whilst reading that you don't always need a soppy HAE. Life isn't always that way and Colleen gave us a subtle reminder of that with Hopeless.at should p you off.\\"<br /><br />I think sometimes we forget whilst reading that you don't always need a soppy HAE.

B0018PH3L0|5.0|I have owned a copy of Lonesome Dove ever since it came out on VHS video tape.  Recently I purchased the newly released digitized version (DVD) with surround sound and was thrilled with the high quality of the video and audio.  What a difference!  Well worth the price if you are a true fan of this wonderful western film.
B002RKRV4Y|5.0|This book was amazing I've read 8 or 9 times and each time you get something new out of it great read quick read.
B009Z5975A|5.0|Great movies for a great price!!!! I love all three of these movies and would recommend them to anyone who enjoys Steven Spielberg movies.
B000R7I3LY|5.0|On a road trip with a friend we listened to Sara Bareilles the whole way and I really liked her songs. I was not a huge fan of Love Song at first but her other music definitely won me over.
B007REV4YI|2.0|Too keep things short and sweet the people who decided to do this internal reboot as it's being called basically decided to stick their fingers in their ears and shout \\"LALALA September 11'th didn't happen LALALAAA\\". Instead of fighting terrorists, or dealing with global criminal finance, or the controlling of natural resources as in the last two movies Bond is fights a maniacally laughing evil genius who can do whatever he wants via computer hacking almost to the level of it being a ridiculous super power. I half expected him to threaten to blow up the moon if he didn't get a million dollars. I will give it this, it is an extremely well acted, and directed movie, but the plot is ludicrus, and the nostalgia tripping script is not what I was looking for especially since I don't feel nostalgic towards the old movies, also there are several sections that are unexpectidly slow which screwes up the pacing. September 11'th happened, so did Austin Powers and I want a James Bond that lives in a world that realizes this. In other words I want James Bond in my world but hey, who wouldn't?
B003JUGQ38|5.0|I will admit Donna is my favorite companion of the 10 doctor.  The writing in these episodes is superb and the acting is, as the British say, brilliant.  If you like Dr. Who, time travel or SF in general, you will enjoy this.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Refreshing. Enjoy this series immensely and like the outstanding acting, cinematography, and concept. Thank you for  providing  wonderful clean entertainment without the need for vulgarity, nudity, and debauchery, for debauchery's sake. A well-developed storyline that flows exceedingly well. A big &#34;Thank You&#34; for restoring my faith in wholesome programming.
1449410243|5.0|There is nothing better for the cat to be on your lap as you read this book. I always suspected the cat knew more English than it let on but now I am positive about my suspicions. Every laugh was met by a glare of epic proportions.
B000NY12LO|5.0|I really like this author even though some of her stories are a little off for me.  I really enjoyed this and will continue reading her.
B000I9YWDO|3.0|I guess my office experiences has been greatly different from what I saw in the movie.  This is was just an okay movie.  Every office I worked in copiers, printers, machines has worked and if not, someone immediately fixes it.  I guess I must have worked in the most professional offices in my career.  I hope that I do not ever experience what these poor people suffered from in this movie.  So sorry, I did not see all of the humor everyone has been raving about, but it is an interesting movie.
B000005JAX|5.0|I am a huge depeche mode fan and I can't believe I waited this long to hear songwriter Martin Gore's solo album. I. Didn't realize the first few listens that these are covers! Martin's arrangements are as beautiful as ever. If you want to hear a record that sounds like violator and songs of faith and devotion had a baby, check this out!
B007LB1O3I|3.0|I should have known for the Super Bowl performance that Madge is trying to target the wrong audience for this new album but against that knowledge I bought the CD. I got a very Kylie Minogue of the 90's vibe for this album and truthfully I am over this style of music.
0446614459|5.0|I really love the King and Maxwell stories and hope he will continue to write more of them.  They move along great and he has the best story lines.  love'm
078322740X|5.0|Goldie Hawn and Steve Martin make a great pair.  The movie was received in excellent condition and was sent as agreed.<br />I have never have any problems with Amazon or those that provide products through Amazo
B00APJLFEG|5.0|The movie was better then I expected It to be.  The whole family loved it.  It's a lot more romantic then I expected and my wife loved that about it.  Over all I was a great buy!!!
B004PVKFR8|5.0|I heard the song Sail on the radio quite frequently and once it got stuck in my head I decided it was time to investigate the other songs on the album. Overall the CD is good but Sail is by far my favorite song still.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this story, it was full of love and heart break.  They made a movie out of it and it just wasn't very good.  After I watched the movie I went back and read the book again a and wow it was great.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|Watched it with my 8 yr old who absolutely loved it. Its funny, is filled with adventure and a bit of fantasy.
B002YCVWXQ|5.0|What a great movie. Brad Pitt and Christoph Waltz are amazing actors. I could watch this over and over again.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|I wasn't sold on their first single It's Time, I liked it but not enough to buy the entire album, but when the second single Radioactive came out I couldn't hold out anymore! This album is so catchy.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Her childhood was bleak, horrid, without hope.  She overcame all odds and I believe the future is bright.  I'll never look at a flower  without thinking: 'what is it saying?'
B000VDDDVO|5.0|This movie will always be one of those classics around christmas time. I remember watching this movie every year, so glad I'm finally able to have it in my collection of movies.
0780622650|5.0|I grew up watching Lost in Space and i was truly afraid they had messed it up with making this movie...... I was wrong LOVE this movie
B004EIZCPM|5.0|This movie was full of laughs and who couldn't laugh at something Stanley Tucci is in. Emma Stone is a great actress and I am glad that she is getting noticed.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Difficult to read at times it was so painful. Society doesn't know what to do with sociopaths, parents certainly can't be expected to know.
B006J420UE|5.0|i bought the a8-3870k from what i heard from friends it was a pretty good cpu and they were right it doesn't slow down at all no matter what i thow at it the only problem i have that i noticed it runs alittle warmer then the a6-3600 i was using before but it just could be me but over all it is one heck of cpu and it overclocks nicley
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This series has it all.  Everything about this series is so real that you are drawn into this world of early 20th century England and I'm sure the use of Highclere Castle cements that feeling.  The only concession I saw to the 21st century was the use of modern lights on the enormous Christmas tree (I'm sure it was a liability issue).
B00004Z400|5.0|Chino and gang have done an amazing job again, the single Change is great but I think there are other gems on here that were overlooked by the radio heads.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I gives it this rating because it's awesome I would recommend this book to everyone thing is very very awesome
B008D28HYS|5.0|I can't put this game down (this and the non-color version).  Love how it makes you think and a great time &#34;waster&#34;.  Thanks!
B000QCS8TW|4.0|Found it difficult to stop reading after the first chapter....bought book 2 half way through. Great sense of humour, I laughed out a lot of times
B00A0HQ7H8|4.0|I feel like Lana Del Ray hit the States like a tsunami.  I watched The Voice and American Idol and there were so many references to her music but I didn't know who she was so I decided to try out the CD and I am glad I did, Lana has a pretty voice.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book shows that women of abused relationships can get away and have a true relationship. Loved reading every word. Going to see the movie now.
B007SGM084|5.0|I really enjoyed these books and now to have them on my Kindle makes it very easy to take and read any where.
B001EC3JME|4.0|Okay thought I needed this for a Streamlight but didn't it seemed to work okay kinda tight, but then if it wasn't someone would say needs to be tighter.
B007MU85D0|5.0|Wow am I glad Keflavik shared this amazing talent with the world. I ador the song Little Talks and the rest of this album won't let you down if you are into indie folk/rock/pop music!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My child loves this the game a  a a a a a a a a a a a a a<br />...............
B00005N6KG|5.0|Ear buds don't fit into my ears but the others are hot & uncomfortable long term.  These solve both problems.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Medievil (spelling?) warring, spying & intrigue ~ Just the weapons are different today!  I will read the whole series, but need a &#34;buffer&#34; book inbetween...
1439110123|5.0|This large book has great unique insights for anyone interested in the geopolitical and political intrigue of the context of the oil industry. Read it!
B007X2JV0S|5.0|Yes, that's a cheer for the series and for the music. I really enjoy the music - have series 1 and 2 now and will eagerly await both the TV series for Season 3 and its music!!
B000VNMMQG|5.0|A great story with an inspirational plot. Amazing how one mans biblical morality moved a nation to do something it was unwilling to do up to that point.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I really like this show even though it is a little corny. The only problem I had was with the connection. Even though my internet connection was working fine, Amazon cut out around 4 or 5 times during the course of viewing Season 2.
B0013K11AE|5.0|You should definitely watch this if you are a classic horror fan.I love this movie. Of course reading the book you notice things that are different or cut compared to a movie, so why do people mention it? If you decide to watch please do. Also check out misery, it (which is VERY long) & thinner !
B000I9U972|5.0|A classic for sure.  Great characters and funny as hell!<br />Gosh, get your own tater tots!<br />Guestion:  Is Lafonda a man or woman...???
B00BF8OYJO|4.0|What a treat to read, a sort of Miss Marple sprinting past Usain Bolt pace, there was no hanging around in this tale, except for the murder victim of course.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|It's nice to have a short quick look into Brandon's worlds now and then to contrast the huge volumes he would otherwise produce.  Very nice story set in the same world as his debut book, Elantris, yet utilizing another unique feeling magic system.  Great read.
B0042J6VUS|5.0|I wasn't expecting this to be all that great, but it turns out to be one heck of a tripod. I've recorded several videos using my MyTouch 4G Slide using this item with no issues at all. Well worth the price, and is made of very durable material.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|It is great to have all the titles in a single boxed set.  Disappointed with the hoops needed to use UltraViolet.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|This show delivers a roller coaster ride throughout the season and the series.  You quickly become emotionally invested with Walter, Peter, and Olivia.  The acting is superb and Fringe fans all know John Noble who plays Walter was robbed of a Emmy each year.  In fact I don’t believe he was ever nominated.  If you enjoy syfi, you will enjoy this series.  I watch the series and the reruns and I still bought the complete series, it was that good.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a good app!  The pictures and sounds are very interesting and entertaining.  Just make sure you have a lot of time because it is hard to quit playing once you start!
B009FZFONO|5.0|Can't say enough great things about this show!  Definitely hooked!  Season three was incredible, just as I knew it would be.
B005LAII1C|5.0|An excellent &#34;R&#34; rated comedy that stands up well to repeated viewing.  Disappointed in the hoops you have to jump through to use the UltraViolet capabilities.
0525951652|5.0|I absolutely loved it!  Could not wait to finish and get on to Winter of the World.  Ken Follett is truly a master at creating characters that pull on your emotion and keep you envolved.  Even with so many characters to follow, Mr. Follott's skill makes it easy.
0718143361|5.0|This book is a must read, and you will find the hardcover on almost anyone's shelf. If you've never read it, make the time to do so
B001FW58D6|5.0|This show is absolutely amazing, and my only regret is I just found it in 2012.  The characters are incredible, the plot will blow your mind and it will definitely leave you wanting to see the next season and the next and the next!  Conspiracy theory folks, Sci-Fi or simple people who just love a good love story will all enjoy this show.  It actually made me start researching science again!  Don't miss out on Fringe!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Season 3 is progressing faster than season 2 did considering in the comic book the farm only lasted 6 issues and they spent an entire season milling pointlessly about Hershel's place. It's better late than never to introduce Tyrese though I wish they would tone down his &#34;get along to get along&#34; attitude. I hope with the Governors attack on the prison Rick will snap out of his post Laurie craziness. No matter how else I could criticize the storyline I would probably would swear off T.V. if this show was ever cancelled.
B001NLKT60|5.0|I love this book. It kept me on my toes from beginning to end. I'm sad it's only a trilogy.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|Unlike most books, this book makes you think and keeps you coming back for more.  The attention to detail is what drives this story.  Although the one discrepancy I found is that if Lisbeth Salanders character was so good with computers, why would she take her computer to a repair shop to see if anything could be salvaged from the hard drive?  That's the only thing I found wrong with this series. If that's all I found wrong, then this is a great series and I would recommend it to anyone.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I just finished Hopeless, by Colleen Hoover a short while ago.  This book exceeded my already high expectations.  After reading Colleen's other two books, Slammed and Point of Retreat, I knew that this author had a rare and beautiful talent for writing.<br /><br />Her books are never easy to read, in the sense that they are never light fluffy reads.  Yet, they are full of substance, life lessons, and teaching us that no matter our circumstances in life, it is important to gather strength, and courage.<br /><br />Hopeless, was no different.  At the beginning of the story, we learn that Sky was adopted when she was five years old, and has a very close relationship with her adopted mother Karen.  We also learn about her best friend and the fact that both girls like to sneak boys into their room at night which has earned them a negative reputation.  When Sky is making out with a boy, or should I say when he is making out with her, she feels nothing.  She becomes numb and counts the stars on the ceiling in her bedroom.<br /><br />Sky's life changes when she meets Dean Holder or just Holder as he goes by.  He sparks intense feelings inside her.  As the two get to know one another, they get extremely close and fall hard for each other.  Little by little, Sky starts having nightmares, and remembering long forgotten/repressed memories from her childhood.  Holder helps her unravel  the mystery of her past, as well as cope with what she finds out.  She in turn, teaches him about love, hope, strength, and new begininngs.<br /><br />What I love about Colleen Hoover's writing the most, is her ability to make a story come alive in your imagination.  I could picture the characters, their voices, and events that took place with great clarity.  I also love how I am able to grow such deep attachments to the characters through her writing.  I don't feel like I'm reading a story.  I feel like I am experiencing someone else's life through their eyes.  Sky and Holder became so real to me that when I experienced the depth of their pain, I had to keep saying to myself, \\"This is just a story, it's not real.\\"  However, the painful events made me feel so bad inside for the people that have gone through, or are currently going through, some of the events that happened to Sky and Holder.<br /><br />Hopeless blew me away.  It is a story that will stay with me forever.  I recommend Hopeless to everyone who loves to read and appreciates a good story!  I give Hopeless 5 Heart Aching Stars!that when I experienced the depth of their pain, I had to keep saying to myself, \\"This is just a story, it's not real.\\"  However, the painful events made me feel so bad inside for the people that have gone through, or are currently going through, some of the events that happened to Sky and Holder.<br /><br />Hopeless blew me away.

B0095P2TBE|5.0|i enjoyed this movie more than the others i felt it seem to be more real and the actors were more believable
B00BESM14U|5.0|Cast is well chosen, acting is great and the entire film is excellent.  Expect to laugh and cry.  Definitely recommend watching (and read the book).
0743243153|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read. I first read this book in the mid 80's. It helped me alot. There are portions I have re-read over and over through the years. My son is a psychology major in college. He discovered my copy. Read it. Loved it. Thinks everyone should read it. He gave it to a friend. I'll never see it again. So I ordered a new copy for me and one for my son. Very worthwhile reading.
0891416811|5.0|I read a copy of this book when it first came out in paperback and when I was much younger.  I loved then and am very please to now have a hardback copy.  The first time I read this book was before I ever heard of Stephen Ambrose or his book &#34;band of Brothers,&#34; but it was Burgett's &#34;Currahee!&#34; that really got me interested in the 101st during WWII.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I like it because it is something fifteenth and cool and easy ya ya ya. it is cool for everyone to play
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|I hoped it would be longer.  the game ended rather abruptly.  the puzzles or mini games were nice.  the graphics are nice.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I purchased SLP and and once I started reading it I couldn't put it down.<br />This book caters to anyone who enjoys a good drama and comedy.  Couldn't help but to love all the characters.  Mine of course was Tiffany.
B00B7FWWNA|3.0|Since this was based on a true story, the story itself was heartwarming and brought out some of the difficulties of handicapped people that aren't often discussed. The character it was based on was depicted as  a very caring and loving person.  However, I would have been embarassed by all the nudity if I had seen it with friends in a theater.
B000FVQLRA|5.0|I watch this movie over and over because I am inspired that God's providence saved this man.  Through no machinations of his own, this man is saved from the Nazi's time and time again and even provided for by his enemies at times.  Adrien Brody does a terrific acting job too.  If you are a person of faith, you will love this story as I do.  Unfortunately, there is also brutality, but this man's story is inspirational.
B005DN5BE4|5.0|Had to watch this for my professor and it's so much different to actually see what happened to slaves than to hear or read about it.
034580404X|5.0|What can I say about this book that hasn't already been said.  Everyone is reading it so I bought it.  I have already read the first one and am onthe second.
B00B0ZT9NI|3.0|I heard a few people say it was the best movie they every saw so my expectations were high.  However, the movie did not meet my expectations although it was good to learn some of the 'behind the scenes' actions during the hostage crisis.
B003L77GRO|5.0|Im writing to say, We love this show!!!! However, season four disc- four never came.  Instead there were two disc three's in the package. We would love to have this disc sent to us. Thank you very much.

1580084621|5.0|I gave the book as a gift, but read some of it before giving it.  I found it to be a beautifully written and informative book.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|easy to read layout for my mobile device (all that i use once i leave work).  easy price checking, ordering, and reviewing.
B005FISBTO|5.0|Cant wait for weekend morning to get here so we can catch up on this show. This usually means breakfast in bed while we watch tv.
B002UHTTWQ|4.0|A great read. The author describes emotions and events well but sometimes the descriptions are crude and not those of a mature writer. Though I believe this was her first novel. I'm looking forward to reading her last one, for comparison of writing style.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|Great book. It really has a message . It is so greatly detailed and you will fall in love with this book. So make sure you get this wonderful tale of a book. So do me great favor. It is free so I would definitely recommend getting this wonderful tale of a great book.
B000GL1BHO|4.0|I bought this for one of my twin daughters. Her sister got a different one, and when this one came in the mail, I was very concerned that she would feel bad that it was half the side we expected. But the twins love it and play with it all the time. The detail was finer than the other toy.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Love the different perspective of the characters in the book! It was so good I read it in one day!
B00A8KJK7G|5.0|Surprised our Grandaughter with this before It hit the stores and she totally surprised. Ordering it early and having it sent to her was awesome
B0002TJGQS|5.0|Like what can you say about batteries other than the are &#34;fresh&#34; and work as intended.  Try some and you won't be disappointed.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|i love this game it is so amazing they should come out come out with new ones this is way better than regular temple run
B0064T6LV8|4.0|got this game because I've always found pinball to be fun and a good little time waster.<br />I wasn't sure how it would come across on the kindle but found that it's actually quite good.<br />The controls work well and were designed for ease of use.<br /><br />The different games are fun, challenging, and diverse.<br />Well done.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|Was bought this for our Grandaughter for Valentines Day and ordering it ahead of release time worked out perfect. Thank you for offering this
B0071DJZZA|5.0|Pretty good book I loved it. And the movie. I'm on catching fire now. They better come out with a second movie.
0741470314|5.0|Dr Moriarty obviously has a soft-spot for Michael.  While she does provide a large amount of factual information, she tries to take a positive view on the more \\"seemly\\" aspects of Michael's life.  She makes it clear that as a professional in mental health, her experience is that the societal \\"good\\" person has demons - its part and parcel of the human condition.  She says none of us should judge Michael too harshly, or to quote one of his songs, \\"The Man in the Mirror\\".  She writes in an entertaining manner and provides insights into Michael's behavior, and by assocation, our own.
B005HSG3TC|3.0|The cover fits well, and it serves to protect the screen and edges, but that's about all.  The slot that the edge of the cover is supposed to fold into isn't deep enough to hold the edge in place to form a stand; sometimes just touching the screen to turn a page is enough to collapse the fold and the Kindle falls down flat.  The elastic strap doesn't seem to serve much of a purpose.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|I rated thismovie 5 stars as it kept me rivoted to the screen wondering what was going to happen next. My hopes for the character swayed this way and that. Denzel had me believing this character was real. I was ambivalent about the ending as I was so wrapped up with the character and the choices he made. I won't say more so as not to spoil it for someone who hasn't seen the movie but you won't be sorry watching this one.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This was an enjoyable book.  Easy and quick to read.  Even though it is fiction, it depicts a problem that occurred in the past.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I love this game.  It leeds you to where you need to go and what you need to get.<br />The story line is very good.
B008YRVW0I|3.0|The game is really addicting and my 5 year old loves to buy stuff for the aquarium stuff, but I think there should be more sections. It only took me 2 days to complete each sections gold medals, now it is kind of boring because I just play and there is no goal.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|It was my first book from Moyes and I must admit I was expecting something 'lighter' but I loved it.<br />Funny, entertaining, sometimes sad and it will definitly make you think.
B002FE5XVK|3.0|This review is of the 25th anniversary blu ray version. The music and the performers' stage presence are terrific. The problems start with the source video that should have received considerably more restoration. The bad lip sync in one song is even more distracting/disturbing. It doesn't help that in the bonus feature interview David Byrne says that an overdub changed the words that he spoke live between songs. It makes you wonder how much of the entire performance was overdubbed.<br /><br />Great music. But the \\"Greatest concert movie ever\\" seems like just another concert film that was \\"sweetened\\" for mass consumption.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|It was a really good dictionary really I didn't find it to interesting but it was good a b c
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Great game. I enjoy being able to play different seasons. I play one holiday and there is always another season coming up. When I get back around to Christmas, I'll play it again.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Easy enough to put ideas together but just hard enough to keep you on your toes! I got stuck in a few places, but I always had the &quot;hint&quot; button to help me out!
B000SEGUDE|3.0|So, I may be of limited intelligence but I really found this story hard to follow.  The six stories themselves were fine on their own but I am having a hard time seeing how they all fit together.  I read the book twice and then went and saw the movie, which confused the issue even more.  Then I read the reviews and see that there are multiple interpretations of the stories interconnections.  If the purpose of a book is to get you to think then Cloud Atlas exceeds all expectations!  The explanations of this book contained in the reviews all make sense in hindsight but I can't decide on which one I agree with and it is just getting too hard; so I'm just giving up on this one and sticking with books that are easier to understand like Les Mis&eacute;rables, Moby Dick, and War and Peace...
B002RI9VVM|3.0|I hadn't read this book since school and wanted to see if it still had the same effect - it did - I cried.  A simple story, written in an older style, still easy to read and a classic.
B0066W1AZK|3.0|I'm not a big chess playing and I don's really play this that much. I might delete it, because I like to play games to pass the time and not have to think too hard about. If I want to play chess, I would get out the real chess board.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|But it is a true story. Heroic. Unusual inside stories on the dealings of the Nazi thugs with the German military.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I really enjoyed Season 2. Season 3, maybe the setting of the jail, the fatigue of zombies makes it a little less interesting.<br /><br />now I've watched through the latest episode and it did get more interesting so 4 stars now.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|I ordered this for my wife to play on her Android tablet. I don't think much of it; a waste of time. but she loves it and will spend hours working her way up the levels, which increase in difficulty. It's a good simulation of objects and gravity and makes entertaining noises.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|This game is more fun than the original. My kids like to play also so the whole family plays together.
B000ZN8036|4.0|I enjoyed this movie. It is hauntingly beautiful and will stay with you for days after you watch it. Well-acted and beautifully shot in the wilds of Alaska.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|I watch the whole of season 2 and never even watched season 1. It was gripping and loved the characters.
B009NPA3Q4|3.0|Too bad they chose to overproduce this CD. It had the potential to be better. Looking forward to the day when P2 is free to develop his music as he wishes.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|This is a great time-management game!  Great and clever graphics make the games super fun to play.  If time-management games have been boring this will not disappoint.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|Great little short story. Fascinating characters. Wonderful and thoughtful magic system. Brandon Sanderson is a genius when it comes to giving a magic system a plausible explanation. Loved it.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This is well-written, but you have to take into account that the author deliberately changed a lot of essential details in order to prevent disclosure of confidential information.  The author explains why this was necessary in the \\"Author's Note.\\"  However, he seems to have gone overboard, hiding things that are already public knowledge.  For instance, he describes the two helicopters that assaulted Bin Laden's compound as Blackhawks.  In fact, they were super-secret stealth helicopters.  Within days of the attack, pictures of the tail rotor of the helicopter that crashed and was partially destroyed were plastered all over TV, newspapers and internet.  It was clear from those pictures that this was not a Blackhawk or any other publicly-known military helicopter.  The shape and materials clearly showed it was a stealth craft.  Nonetheless, the author repeatedly calls it a Blackhawk, and he does not explain that the reason they placed so much incendiary explosives on the helicopter was to protect the secret of how it was built and to prevent other countries from learning how to detect it.  So you know you are being given misinformation, and it makes you wonder what else he has changed that undermines your understanding of the events of the raid.  Nonetheless, it is a good story and a good read.<br /><br />The author spends about a third of the book talking about how he became a Navy Seal and progressed onto Seal Team Six.  This is necessary background and context, but if you want to get a more in-depth feel for the lives of these extraordinary soldiers, I recommend reading [[ASIN:B0078XOCRY SEAL Team Six: Memoirs of an Elite Navy SEAL Sniper]] by Howard E. Wasdin.  Also, there is a fair amount of detail about how the CIA pieced together the information that identified Bin Laden's location, but the movie \\"Zero Dark Thirty\\" will give you a much better picture of how this was done.  Put it all together and you will be awed by the courage and skill of the people who risktheir lives every day protecting us.
B00APACSJG|5.0|The Vorkosigan series is my favorite science fiction series and since sci fi/fantasy is my favorite kind of book the Vorkosigan series is my number one love. It was wonderful to read another Miles book. As usual, great characters, fascinating situation, many a surprise twist in the plot, some great belly laughs! Definitely worth reading!<br /><br />Bujold relied too heavily on humor (and other emotions) derived from references to other books in the series and characters who were not involved in this book. This is a shame. I would prefer that she reach the same heights in all her books--creating situational humor in the midst of fast-moving plots that better than any writer I know.<br /><br />I recommend that you start at the beginning of the Vorkosigan series--do not let the first book (Shards of Honor) discourage you (it is not one of the best and the second book (Barrayar) will make up for it) and go straight on through the series. What a ride!!!<br /><br />And in future, please give us some more of the old-style Miles books where he *really* gets in trouble, Lois!!<br /><br />And, fellow readers, do not let Amazon forget that we are upset that it uses the equivalent of a nuclear power plant's worth of energy--much of it dirty diesel--at a very inefficient rate (see investigative report by NYTimes). We need to see change or we need to shop at bookstores.
B0011Z32KI|5.0|A perfect collection of songs to set your mood for some romance and the price is affordable!  I enjoy listening to these songs during coffee breaks.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I decided to start from the beginning and I watched season 1 and 2 in a day and a half because I loved it. Great show!
1611134226|5.0|I love listening to anything that Preston and Child put out.  I travel a lot and it really makes the time go by.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|A great historical novel. I always love Ken Follett's books.  He is a great story teller and provides wonderful detail.
B004SRPXWQ|1.0|I don't like this app, talking ginger is better, it's an iPod app. This cat is angry looking, dangerous, and not very kid friendly. I need to go through all talking animals app too see if any work for my 21/2 yr old.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Price was reasonable, couldn't find it anywhere else like Netflix.  Love the program but never watched it before this year so I had to catch up two seasons before I could enjoy the third!

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|this book was excellent.  it did not end as expected, but did end well. the series was written for a much younger crowd than my age group, but I really enjoyed it.

Over here in the UK where Nemo Blu-ray hasn't been released n it maybe sometime before it is getting from the US was a nice surprise! It is duel play Blur-ray/ DVD..<br />For those wanting Nemo should know that the Blu-ray disc is region free so the fact that the DVD is region locked to region 1 doesn't put off buying this!<br /><br />Thank you very much and enjoy.. this 1 is cushty
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Simple to watch, I needed to catch up on Season 3, loved it! Recommending to all my friends and Walking Dead fans.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Game of thrones season 2!  A billion things I can say about it but I think it's kind of obvious.  I'm gonna talk about the packaging that it came in and the bonus features.  The packaging is super slick looking and even better the more you open it up.  Very nice.  And the bonus features (just like the first season) are among some of the greatest bonus features you can ever get on a blu ray collection.  Thank you.  It's amazing.
B003O86FMW|5.0|this one was my least favorite of all Hunger Games books, until the second read. I am looking forward to the movie in the fall of 2013.

B001UTW7QU|5.0|Friends and family kept  telling me about this show but I never had time to watch it. The stories and the set up for<br />Upcoming episodes is well thought out. It is like reading a good book. I especially enjoy Walter. The looming secrets<br />Of Massive Dynamics and the relationships of the team. I have 4 more seasons to go and looking forward to it all.
B008CP6RWU|5.0|and it is!  This is a great game!  I want to play it again and again! The story is compelling and amazing!
B000FCK65W|5.0|This book appeared on an optional eighth grade reading list for me -- 45 years ago. And, I'm very sorry I waited so long to become acquainted with Betty Smith's masterpiece. If nothing else, Francie Nolan is a contemporary of my grandparents, and it would have been a great way to start conversations that might have let me learn more about what it was like to grow up in poor immigrant families in small-town Wisconsin.<br /><br />Beyond that, though, this is a truly compelling story of a girl's coming of age under less-than-ideal circumstances, buoyed mainly by her own strength of character. Smith's sparse writing style took a bit for me to get used to, and it helped reading her biography and learning that she was primarily a dramatist; she prefers to show her readers what's going on and leave them to their own interpretations, rather than simply telling them.<br /><br />The latter chapters weren't quite as rewarding, even though it's comforting to see that Francie's hard work is finally going to pay off. The real meat of the story occurs in her formative years ending with her own eighth grade graduation. Even so, these were not characters I was prepared to leave when the book ends. And, while I believe I understood the adults better for having waited 45 years to tackle this book. I'd heartily recommend it to anyone 12 and up who wants to read a wonderful story of a girl's growing up.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I really live this show, great story. I also really love that it's on here the next day after it airs, since I don't have cable...
B007REV4YI|1.0|Have you ever seen the Death Cry of an Old Coyote?<br /><br />Well, neither have I until I saw this 007 Skyfall movie.<br /><br /> I even hate to use the good name of 007 together with this terrible, terribly directed movie named Skyfall in the same sentence.<br /><br /> The opening action sequence looked like it was directed by an amateur, including the terrible handling of firearms.<br /><br /> This movie was so boring that it took the entire movie for them to kill the old, wise coyote.<br /><br /> Sadly, the axiom of Hear no evil, See no evil, and Say no evil does not apply for this 007 movie. Why?  Because this terrible movie tortured all 3 of those senses and--following the theme of a good 007 movie, which Skyfall is not--it's pay back time!

B004C3DLJ8|5.0|I like renting from Amazon.com because they're all willing to make things right if there are any problems viewing a movie. Unfortunately we had issues watching this movie,amazon was quick to resolve the prob. With what we were able to watch...do to internet prob. It is a cute movie!
B000QCQ9O8|5.0|It actually took me awhile to get into this novel. I had recently watched the movie and the movie is extremely similar go the book. However the book (and the movie) are great!<br /><br />The book is about lovers who are torn apart by a young girl`s lie then kept apart by war. There are no true happy endings. But the journey is marvelous!

B00B7G3NFU|5.0|This is just one of those meaningful movies that makes you reflect about the purpose of life and love and moreover how love transcends more than the physical appearance or physical abilities. I just loved the fact that this is not another conventional, predictable and stupid movie. If you want to see something touching that leaves you with a message... watch it! enjoy!
B001F4UHGC|5.0|Just adding to my garage collection.  Another classic.  Probably one of the better chase scenes.  Another for when my buddies visit.

B009K0OL06|5.0|Revenge grabbed ahold from the first episode and has never let up. The writers' creativity is remarkable as they weave characters in and out without sacrificing the main goal for the lead actress Emily, revenge for her father's conviction for a crime he did not commit.  i

The clothing is beautiful.<br /><br />LOVE LOVE LOVE this series.
B007KFZ7RE|5.0|R&B as a music category has been corrupted through the years by lumping any black artist as R&B and ignoring other folks. Nick Waterhouse brings back the R&B soul sound I remember growing up in the 60's and 70's. Straight forward bottom thumping magic with guitar and horns! Sounds like it was recorded at Hitsville, USA in Detroit. I love it!
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|Good job I really enjoyed the details given about all the games I grew up loving. ...... Again good job
B0012QRPU4|4.0|The show is great, Did not like the fact that the episode I purchased was censored.<br />If I'm paying for the episode I would like to see the show as it was originally broadcast.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I love Nicholas Sparks!!!! His books are easy to read but always so good!! This book is definitely a winner!!
0525423842|5.0|This book was bought for my father-in-law.  He loves to read! I am sure that he enjoyed it very much!
B007SGM084|5.0|I loaded it to my ipad . I had no problems and the cost was more than reasonable through Amazon. The trilogy & the author was awesome. It had taken me awhile to get around to finally reading it after everyone I knew read & raved about it. I was not disappointed & I couldnt put it down. I was only disappointed  when I realized there was no more left to read.
1451626657|5.0|Great book as always. It's bigger than some previous versions. Good if you like the feeling of flipping solid pages.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Absolutely love this show! Takes you to a world that you otherwise would never be privy to. Can't' wait for the next episode!

B007F1BQMS|4.0|This movie was recommended to me by family. My 39-year old daughter AND my 18-year old grandson each spoke highly of the film. They each have very different tastes in movies so I was intrigued enough to see the movie. I was not disappointed. Well acted, good story line with a nice blend of mild drama, romance and comedy. We watch several holiday movies every year and I have added this one to our &#34;holiday library.&#34;
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love love love this game!!! I think it is much better than the first one.  I got it when it was free. But I would buy this game if I had to.
B008NAFDF6|5.0|Working with this drive was a breeze once I got the proper ZIF connector. Originally picked up a ZIF to SATAII to USB connector. SSD read on 1st boot only, then used a ZIF to USB B and it picked up from then on. Fitted perfect in my UX-380n, cloning was a breeze and went well.
044042321X|5.0|This book was bought for my father-in-law.  He loves to read! I am sure that he enjoyed it very much! ;)
B00005JNJV|4.0|It seems lately that films based on comic book heroes rely solely on effects and cheesy dialogue to achieve the story line. Now, finally, this film does not. While I enjoy the Batman films (and prefer the Michael Keaton ones to the sequels), Christian Bale and this version is refreshing in its focus on the man. For those who think it will not connect to the series, fear not. The last few scenes make this film an appropriate prequel...and even better than the rest.
B00AECDDYY|4.0|Read the reviews and decided to try it. Eight levels later i cant put my kindle down. Challenging and fun. I wasnt sure what to expect and im not sure even now how to best describe this game. It is fast paced and simple to grasp but challenging. Win for me.
B004LWZW6U|4.0|Seriously, this one is way more fun without a lot of stupid filler like the first one. It's fun, it's tongue-in-cheek and it's a lot of 3-d mayhem. The first was bloated and just dumb with what seemed like an hour underwater sequence of boobs that was just dull. The star power was wasted. Here there is obviously less \\"studio\\" pressure to deliver one for the masses and rather, one for the fans of these types of movies. Thanks Gulager! A good follow-up to the Feast movies!

B000KX0IOK|4.0|I really liked this movie. Though slow (as it should have been), it displayed the growing friendship between teacher and student, both in need of something beyond their normal lives. Ryan Gosling, a long way from his Mickey Mouse days, always impresses in every one of his roles. So too does Epps. While some might say the film lacks a plot or traditional climax, the scenes in the bathroom and in the hotel room provide the viewer with those very climactic scenes, with those moments that leave you feeling like something within the characters have changed. This ties in with the classroom discussion on change, on turning points, on opposing forces, on working within and against the machine. Working in an urban school myself, I also love the message that students, from any background, can be challenged and rise up to the challenge.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|This game provides many different options to win and is enjoyable to play.  I only wish they would give more free games in order to aquire more bingo chips.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|I knew that this book wouldn't by have a good ending, but it makes think about what I take for advantage (freedom and family)

B00004XMTJ|2.0|When I saw Cats on stage, I was up in the rear balcony. I loved the music and dancing but kept thinking I was missing something. I wasn't. The musical is disjointed but it's music and costumes are absolutely stunning. Unless you can afford front row seats, this dvd brings that right to you. My only complaint was the cutting of the pirate ship scene. It's not my favorite musical, hence the two stars, but, for those who love it, a dvd that's up close is a bonus.
B004GVT0BY|5.0|A great book, good voice acting (not the best). I converted to MP3 and it works on iPod and other MP3 devices. I would recommend this book.
B000E1MXSW|5.0|I have wanted to have this movie as part of my collection for many years!  This year that dream came true.  I truly enjoyed learning about this young woman and her journey into and through consecrated life
0525425764|5.0|This book was bought for my father-in-law.  He loves to read! I am sure that he enjoyed it very much! ;)
B000E1YVZU|5.0|I've seen Rent in theater and count it as one of my favorite musicals. When I went to see it on film, I wasn't disappointed. They translated a musical that is perfect for the stage into a likable film, adding certain depth/understanding to certain issues. Most of the cast returns and deliver another great musical performance. Portions of songs are cut out and/or changed into dialogue but this is done for stylistic reasons, for helping the story flow on film. By turning the musical into film, I can soon, when it's on sale, watch it whenever I want. However, if you like the movie, see it on stage. It's a great experience
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I was not able to watch Downton Abbey when it first started and am playing catchup. It is wonderful to be able to see all of the episodes for Season 1 and Season 2 for free as a prime member. The quality on my Kindle Fire is excellent.
B00005JN8Z|5.0|The story and the photography were just stunning!! I would recommend it to everyone!  The scale of it is so grand.  Awesome!!

B0097NGUJG|5.0|This album is quite the expirience. Textures and textures and sonic goodness. Be sure to see a live performance by them.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|I love this app. It is almost like the Mario Brothers. I will play this game for hours. it is interesting.
B00008J2PG|5.0|I never tire of this story!!  I just love Gregory Peck's performance.  That it is a true story, makes it so appealing--and exciting!!

B008D30K7E|5.0|The title of this book grabbed my attention, it sounded quirky, and once I'd read the description I knew I had to read it...<br /><br />A story about a one hundred year old man who climbed out of a window, but far from disappeared, and it's far more than just that... It's pretty much his whole life history, with a lot of history thrown in too...<br /><br />The book jumps about a lot, chapter by chapter, but luckily the chapters are titled accordingly so it's easy to keep up with... Just as you get hooked on one part of his life, it jumps to another part, only to return later...<br /><br />If there weren't so many fantastic tales throughout, you'd be forgiven for thinking it was more of a biography than a great story...<br /><br />I found this book quite amusing, though it's quite long and drawn out, it took me a while to read, I thoroughly enjoyed it!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I love this game. It's pretty twisted that the objective is human extinction, but the strategy aspect keeps me addicted.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I am addicted to Pinterest so to have it on my phone is awesome.  The App works great and is easy to maneuver.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|again, here's is a must have mystery. its intrigueing, holds your interest and keeps you wanting more. time to invest in the full game because I cant get enougg
0470449764|3.0|Well, I am rating this based on what I saw in the book.  I actually never used this book.  I felt the GMAT Premier was enough and concentrated on that book.  The content in this is much the same and would be good if you felt you needed the extra practice.  I just didn't feel I did after the extensive studying of the other.  Although, the price was not bad, so this is not an indictment of this product.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This game is just plain fun. Some of the levels are insanely tough and others are simple,but it is always fun.
B0095P29EG|3.0|Wasn't great but glad I saw it just to understand the avengers movie better, but not that great by itself.
1616550414|5.0|This book is absolutely fantastic. Official art, concept art, the official history of how all the games tie in to each other, plus an exclusive manga chapter by the team who created all the other Zelda manga. if you're any kind of Zelda fan, long time, new fan, young or old, you simply need this book.

B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Still do not know if Mathew is dead. I am having a great time with this series and so are my grandchildren. Hated to lose my favorite daughter in this series but the unexpected is what makes these sets so darn good.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|As if Season one wasn't the best thing I ever saw, it just gets better!  This show has consumed me!  The music plays in my head all day, I anticipate getting home ot my kindle to watch while I run on the treadmill, just a fabulous show!
B004UID2LC|5.0|This is the perfect App for watching how to do things.  Two years ago I began teaching myself to draw.  When I found the YouTube app, I began to watch all types of artists who are the best in the world teach me how better to draw.  I quickly graduated from just sketching, to drawing, to colored pencil, to watercolor painting, to acrylic painting.  I am much better by watching &#34;How To&#34; videos on YouTube FREE.

B008G59IBI|2.0|This album sounds like Greenday running out of ideas and just decided to throw their leftover songs from the first two albums of the trilogy onto a third disc.  Not impressed at all.  Guitars are too mellow sounding, weak distortion, and not one Song I can say is memorable.
1577314808|5.0|A gift to humanity...  The only issue I had is that he briefly (1 page) mentioned that people on medication (e.g. for depression) are really not conscious (as he defines conscious)... that the drug is just keeping them from growing to true consciousness. If Tolle does not have a medical degree or, more specifically, is not a neurosurgeon or psychiatrist, I don't think he has the authority or knowledge to make such a claim. I have battled depression first hand... causing not only mental anguish, but major insomnia also. Without my meds, I would not be here nor would I ever get any sleep. The meds have allowed me to feel normal again (not artificially good). I can now feel normal emotions... happy, sad, etc... thanks to meds. Otherwise, I would not feel normal and would never sleep.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was very well written, and a page turner. It does cover a heavy topic, but the believability in the characters reactions was enthralling. Highly recommend.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a very enjoyable game.  It is fun to play.  The graphics are great. This is even better than the original.
B008C1O8CA|4.0|This album is pretty good.  The best one of the trilogy.  Kind of reminds me of the Nimrod era, which I thought was really good.  Some weak songs on here but at least half the songs on this record are pretty damn catchy and energetic.  Nuclear Family, Carpe Diem, and Kill the DJ are too notch Green Day.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I LOVE IT BUT IT WOULD BE SO MUCH BETTER WITH CLOSED CAPTIONING. THE ENGLISH ACCENT MAKES IT VERY HARD TO HEAR EVERYTHING.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Very factual, overdue of release of long-awaited story!  Enjoyed interviews by actual hostages at the end of the movie. Highly recommend!
B002LC2DQ4|5.0|Es un excelente producto, lo recomiendo mucho y es exactamente como lo descrito por el vendedor, tambien el empaque fue adecuado y llegó en buenas condiciones, sin daños ni problemas
B00A12VW86|3.0|Not nearly as good as Uno.  Guitars aren't crunchy and overdriven enough...a couple of good songs but mostly filler here.
0345803485|1.0|Honestly,  I only decided to read this because of all the hype surrounding this book. I purchased the Kindle edition, well that's 10 dollars I will never get back! If only I could give this book a 0 star rating. This book is pure garbage. The characters are so poorly developed,  it's difficult to care about what happens to them. The plot is nonexistent between a scruffy girl with brown hair and \\"eyes too big for her face\\" and an older man (27, jeez if he's old someone better throw me in a nursing home) with gray eyes, hot body, mega millions, oh yeah and a large unit. That's about as descript as it gets, that and the incredible amount of lip biting and eye rolling. There's a lot of mumbling,  murmuring,  muttering,  whispering,  so on and so on. The sex scenes were boring and pretty much appeared to be copy and pasted on every other page. Ultimately,  the writing was horrendous.  I've read better written Nancy Drew books in 4th grade. These are two unintelligent and immature characters that can't seem to have a decent conversation throughout the entire book, it shows me how unimaginative and lazy the writer is. I am not a literary snob by any means, but I know poor writing when I see it.<br /><br />Ana must be some sort of super woman in the sack, she has the \\"big O\\" right out of the gate, impressive. I think if a cat rubbed her leg she could orgasm. The whole inner monalogue also known as the \\"inner goddess\\" is enough to make me wish Ana would have been hit by the bicyclist in chapter 3 or whatever and suffered a major brain injury that would have killed off the IG. I could go on and on about how terrible this crapfest was...but I've relived it enough. God help the actors who take roles in the 50 shades movie, their careers will probably never recover.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome I believe it is even better that temple run.I'm still trying to get things though because o just got it
B007HC3LHS|5.0|I admit the first chapter was a little slow at pulling me in.  I had a sense of what the book was going to be about and thought I had it all figured out.  The book turned out to be extremely fast paced and I coudn't put it down.  Admittedly there where a few times I was actually nervous to read the next page(s) for fear of the lead character.  It was a very suspensful book and for a change, I actually liked the ending.  Some books get you all fired up and then leave you flat on their endings - this one was good.<br /><br />If you like drama/suspense - this is a GREAT book!
0307120007|3.0|I really love this book as a story but it only took my one-year-old a matter of an hour to rip several pages off the ringed binding. It is just not a practical way to make a book designed for young children, especially one that actively encourages a tactile experience with the pages. From now on I guess we will stick with board books.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I compared dragonvale and dragon story by downloading both on my phone.dragonvale is much better because u can get dragons u like.plus things are faster.dragon story is toltaly different. things are slower and stuff costs to much.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Great story.  one of my favorite Jack Reacher novels.  A real page turner and very suspenseful.  A good read!  Go For It.
B003DTMUOE|5.0|This is among the top reads ever for me. On the wiki list of the best sellers ever, this one is there with more than 30 million copies. It is simply a marvelous book that each person can interpret in his or her own way.  I first read it in Spanish, and then in English (my native language) because I liked it so much.  It has been translated into 71 languages, more than any other novel.  Sometimes books will be popular because of the hype, and turn out to be poor books, and as Mark Twain said &#34; the man who reads bad books is no better off than the man who doesn't read.&#34;  You will be better off having read this book.<br /><br />One of the additions currently available also has a study guide in the back, presumably because it is also used in book clubs.<br /><br />Simply one of the best ever!
161218412X|3.0|This is not a review of the contents of this set or the works of Doyle. It is simply a review of this box set. It is cool looking and the way the box folds up and opens is &#34;neat&#34; but after the first moment of oohing and ahhing my husband (who was the recipient of this gift) commented that the binding looked a little bit cheap. I inspected it closer and these books do not appear to be very durable. There are nicer sets out there. I got a discount on the item through a coupon code so at the price I paid I feel it was reasonable, but there is no way this set is worth the $96 it is currently priced at.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|Sons of Anarchy never lets you down, just wish that the next season was offered as free to view with Prime membership!!
B004USRLRS|5.0|If you are of a certain age, you will remember this album.<br />I am collecting the music I enjoyed long ago, and this<br />is a hit!
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Prophetic depiction of our cyber challange with vivid descriptions of just how computer warfare can kill. This book is very well written and keeps your attention throughout. It is an amazing match with very current events in our relationship with China.<br /><br />Gerald Rodts
B001XUJMZK|5.0|I liked Braveheart since it was released in theaters. This is no different, and the streaming worked flawlessly. If you haven't seen it, watch it.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|Didn't like this one and so I removed it from my kindle and will not replace it, not kid friendly.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|** spoiler alert ** I thoroughly enjoyed the first installment of this series by George R.R. Martin. The sophisticated marriage of sci-fi, fantasy and historical genres was well-done. I will say that I did myself a disservice by watching the HBO series before reading this book. While the book was fantastic and entertaining, after about 400 pages I was a bit bored since I already knew what was going to happen. On the other hand, without the foundation of the TV series, I probably would've been a bit puzzled with so many story lines being tied together. I can see that all of the story lines and different perspectives may be problematic for me as I read the next books. Too much bouncing around. However, if not too many new character's perspectives are introduced, I'll probably survive the next book.<br /><br />\\"When people play the game of thrones, you win or you die.\\" --> If only poor Ned had understood this! It made me a bit upset that his pride and excruciatingly high sense of morale caused him to lose the \\"game.\\" Alas, the old saying goes that \\"nice guys always finishes last,\\" or in this case, dead. Martin certainly proved the previous aphorism to be correct. I applaud the author's bravery in killing off central characters regardless of the reader's connection to them.<br /><br />The imagery that Martin is able to express via carefully chosen descriptions is applaudable. I love the world(s) that he creates and his ability to *not overdo it*. Just enough fantasy and mythical elements to pique interest, rife with mentally unstable despots, a heavy dose of brutality and sexuality, with a smattering of romance, all shrouded in an almost familiar historical context. Kudos. The world presented in GoT is believable. The characters are guaranteed to evoke some type of reaction from the reader - whether it be adoration, love or pure hatred. And the interwoven stories leave you wanting more. If only the page count was under 600, ah well.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Only had this for a month or so, but works fine so far.  I mostly play FPS games like CoD, BF3, CS.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved the book of course I wish it would have been more detailed through her first pregnancy and them really getting to know each other.  But by far this is the best ever series of books I read.
0142501123|5.0|My husband's aunt in Scotland sent us a Julia Donaldson book for our son and he loves it! They are fun to read for parents (let's face it, some kids books are downright annoying) and my son enjoys the vibrant illustrations and the fun flow of the rhymes. I think we now own every one of her books.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Because I worked with battered women for many years I found the book point on about the behavior of the main character. I would recommend to others and I can't wait to see if the movie is as good as the book.
0486438600|5.0|I originally ordered this book to get a coverup design for one of my existing tattoos.  This book had pages and pages of wonderful designs for traditional henna designs or regular tattoos.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Fun and addictive. But I love dragon story. I just love dragons period. My hubby got  me hooked on this game.

B00APUYN0I|4.0|Loved the singing and the humor.  Well done.  Storyline was a little, light, but I didn't expect much.  Hope there is another one!
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|A Discovery of Witches has come recommended by many friends. I was curious, so I bought it on a whim. Let me tell you folks, it was the best purchase I've made. I love the character development, plot, and all of the little details that brought this book to life. I literally could not put it down. It's not just witches and supernatural, it has science and history weaved throughout.<br /><br />If you're looking for something special and well-written, buy this book. You will not be disappointed.
B007N5YIUS|4.0|I think that angry birds space is an a amazing addictive game but after you've had it for a long time it gets a little boring

B007L3BMGA|2.0|not much of a storyline.  Relies solely on sex to sell.  No great literary worth.  Would like to know if she stays with him but not sufficiently to purchase next episodes
B006XF5BTG|5.0|This feels like the culmination of a lifetime of experience in one book-cant say too much as i just started two weeks ago but i feel great about it so far...also recommend picking up \\"the shredded chef\\" so you can make meal plans! This one has the potential to be a lifestyle-changer...J
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I absolutely love this book. I swore that I would finish the book before I saw the movie and I'm so glad I finished it. I'm laugh and cried. It's an amazing story and I will read it again.
0345803485|5.0|This book is in great condidtion for being used and I love the price I paid for it. I would recommend it to anyone.
B00AQNOCZ0|5.0|This is a great collection. I spent a lot of time trying to decide what collection to buy. The regular 8 film Blu-ray collection seemed like a quickly thrown together, cheap set. Many reviews said the same thing. So, I did what some other customers suggested, I got the UK version.<br /><br />This is definitely the way to go. The UK film collection is of a better quality and costs less than the American version. It is region free so it plays on all Blu-ray players. Don't make the mistake of thinking you can do the same with the DVD collection because those are all region locked.<br /><br />This is more affordable and just all around better value. It even has bonus features, which I love.<br /><br />To sum it up, the UK version costs less, gives you more, and isn't some cheap looking little collection.
1449410243|5.0|If you have cats when you read this you are going to laugh so hard. It is a quick little read but my husband and I still make jokes about it when our boys get into trouble.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I personally think this book is awesome and I could just keep reading this book for hours and hours.to people out there that want a good book to read this is the book you are looking for.you may think ewe this book is all about lovely dove things,then you're all wrong.I
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|i really enjoyed this game because it was a whole lot like nintendo mario bros. wish it was a little longer but it was awesome fun for the whole family and i think anyone who enjoys mario bros. or crash bandacoot would love this game!
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Overall it is an interesting read although some of the language and terms are not in the time frame of the book. For instance, the book refers to the USAF during the 2nd WW. The USAF did not come into being until Oct 1948.Some of the profanity terms used in the book was also not used back then. In some places it drags quite a bit as if the author is just trying to fill pages. Not as good as the first book but acceptable. I hope the final book will focus more on accurate historical facts.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I loved this book, it had so many twists and turns, I was totally blown away by the ending, I didn't see it coming and I read a lot..<br /><br />Great read from begining to end..
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|The frequency of pop-up ads diminishes the time trying to enjoy the game itself.<br />While I'm enjoying my Kindle Fire, I've played this particular game on other pads with fewer interruptions.
B008MEM24S|4.0|I downloaded the firs free version of Where's My Perry? and like lemmings I ended up with the newer improved version.  I have no idea why the game catches my interest.  I actually bought it for my grandson but I log in many more hours playing it than he does.  I have no idea why but it is an interesting game to spend your time with.
B001RJQ700|5.0|I remember this film and remember loving it. I watched it again and know why I did. The struggles in day to day life to make good decisions is universal even for assassins ascended from Hell. Although Al Simmons has made a deal with Malebolgia to lead his army of hell spawn against humanity in return getting Wanda back. It seems strange that an assassin who wanted to retire is killed by his employer then goes to hell returns to kill his boss and through the world into an apocalyptic state only to be redirected by Cogliostro to made the right decisions and trump Hells plans. The choices we make decide our destiny even if we're hell spawn.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|This book had me at the edge of my seat throughout the whole book. The cliffhangers at the end of each chapter made me want to continue and not put the book down. This is a great find for reluctant readers.
B007RE0RR8|5.0|Deffinitely My Doughter is very happy with this item, mainly because in Brasil we don't find it in the stores......
B003VPWX6K|5.0|It's really amazing how much is packed into this book. I think you could apply any critical lens to your reading and find something new every time. That's not common enough!
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|Best bang for the buck if you don't need hyper-threading.  Perfect for multitasking and very few games at present require Hyper-threading.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a good game but I really wish it had more stuff and I need to get better at it
B004UJTG6Q|4.0|the vivid way in wich mark twain makes relive tom's life makes him one of the greatest writter ever! anyway, it's more a story for kids...
B009LRJ9EQ|4.0|This is another live performance deformed by coughing and sneezing by an insensitive audience. I have a hard time dealing with such distractions. That said, Sokolov's rendering is assertive, even aggressive, with interesting flourishes. But the microphones are poorly placed, giving the recording a shallow echo associated with the earliest days of live recording. Glenn Gould has yet to be dethroned for all the endless attempts at the Goldbergs.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is truly addictive. Great graphics and interactivity. Can still have plenty of fun without having to buy upgrades.
B0060MYM7O|1.0|I pre-ordered this product in the summer of 2012.  It is available now on the shelves in Wal-Mart and as a download on iTunes!<br /><br />What a joke!!!<br /><br />My shipment shows to be somewhere in transit.  It's going back the second I receive it.
B009EP3DJM|2.0|Heavy with synthesizers, layered production and vocal processing from top to bottom here, we're left to wonder just what she might actually sound like. Is Kei$ha an artist with ability or just a front for a manufactured wall of sound?
B0044C5SCU|5.0|Great show very entertaining and well written.  Happy i didnt have to wait a whole week to see the next episodes!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Good read. I read the whole thing in one setting. The characters were great and I loved that the author wrote from both if their perspectives. Excellent
B0063M22QO|1.0|This game was fun while it lasted, which was about an hour. When I tried to reopen the app for a second use a few minutes later all I got was a blank screen.
B007QDNKQA|4.0|Shooter is a fun movie with a decent conspiracy story (although it is fairly predictable).  It's not a pure action movie because there was a decent back story.
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|Love this app............ I use it on all my devices..  tablet and smartphones. my wife even loves this  app. way cool!
B0054EU0H0|5.0|I bought this for my Nikon D3100 and it works great.  Doesn't distort the image on the LCD and works as if the screen protector wasn't even there.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|this app will usually just go to the loading page then freezes where I cant get into the actual game. I have never had this problem with any other app on my kindle fire and I have plenty of storage room left on the device so I know its an app issue not mine. its too bad too because when i am able (rarely) to actually get in the game its a ton of fun.
B005LAII8K|1.0|What bothers me most of all was that if I had once third of the money it took to make this piece of Hollywood trash that I just spent 1 1/2 hour of my life watching I could lead the rest of my life in luxury in the Bahamas. As it is, this disposable clunker will sink without a trace, without bringing a single moment of pleasure or insight to the human race. Now that's what I call tragedy. As usual, the film begins with explosive violence, people being killed, shot in the head, chest, while a cute little soundtrack plays in the background. We are then greeted by a few further killings, enormous guns, a dumb (really dumb) explanation of time travel and certain shennanigans having to do with hit men, killers, disposing of bodies, etc. The narrator attempts to explain this to us in certain occasional remarks (\\"Now this is what we call closing the loop\\" and other really - really  - dumb sounding statements). As usual - excessive violence, needless killings, drug use, prostitution, nudity, all add up to a total bore. I'm now convinced after watching a few Hollywood films of the last year of two things: (1) the only thing worth watching are shows like Game of Thrones, Boardwalk Empire, Downton Abbey, that have some life and drama to them instead of endless bloodshed and bad acting, and (2) Lynch and Cronenberg are our only great directors. One half hour of Cosmopolis or Dangerous Method has more content and drama and insight than all this kind of trash. Avoid. F.
B00B7G3Y4U|1.0|I've been a fan of series but this movie is a complete waste of money....The lack of plot and unexplained moments is stunning.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|One of the best novels I have read in many years.  Love the ending. 6 more words,  more words, more words.
B009YU6FJM|4.0|Been a fan for over a decade. The band still brings the goods in their own way! Koi No Yokan indeed!

B007HACDLK|3.0|The plot is not as intense and deep as in some of the previous books. Nothing very great, this book is ok.
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|Whenever there is a topic, current issue or allegation (anything of the like) of abuse esp. in the clergy sect I cringe inside and it makes me queasie, sick-like.<br />I grew up ALL the way thru college in private schools, NOT by choice=just ended being that way. We knew in grammar school that the nuns were sic, mean, honery etc...<br />But getting back to the book it was good, I like going back and forth and getting to 'know' the character, however I think it's a easy way to make someone worthless and sad and empty.<br />His redemption was his and I'm glad of that.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|I love this app!  The only question I had about it is the volume control - it only goes so high.  I'm still playing with it though so maybe I'm missing something. But, I love the way it's set up w all the different sounds and you can make your own by combining sounds together.
0671449028|5.0|This was a gift for my 4 year old grandson he was has bedtime issues reading this book helped make bedtime fun.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The whole trilogy is amazing!! Can't wait for more to come out. The only books I've ever read more then once.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|The story moved along well and was very heartwarming.  I liked that it didn't end in tragedy! Looking forward to the movie....
B00BGD07KS|4.0|This song fits well as an inspirational soundtrack single for the movie \\"Oz the Great and Powerful\\". At first listen it sounds like a good, but un-extraordinary effort from Mariah Carey. However, after two or three listens it is infectious. Also, when framed as a soundtrack cut, against the storyline of the movie, the song will no doubt catch on with audiences and be a radio hit. Mariah songs are held to extremely high standards. So in way, she has the hardest time releasing any single compared to other current hitmakers. If a new Mariah song isn't instantly another \\"Always Be My Baby\\" or \\"We Belong Together\\", it is unfairly dismissed. \\"Almost Home\\" is overall a good song and a solid showing for Mariah Carey.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|A tough read at times but well worth continuing on.  A true story.  I watched the SEALS train on Coronado Island but never realized the intensity of their training.
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|bought it for my wife and she loves it. but she loves any thing adam. myself I think he could have done better.
B00A4Y9BT8|5.0|Must have for any RATM. fan.Remastered version gives you some epic live tracks.  Five stars for ever and all ways.
B004DLPXAO|2.0|Majority of magazines can't be bought for anything other than IPad or actual kindle. Very restrictive. Other than that it's just ok.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|A true classic! Hard to follow at first... Well worth the persistence in the end. This is a book that everyone should read.
B000SJ5XF0|5.0|This is one of my favorite Led Zeppelin albums, and it was in very good quality. The cover was a kind of beat up, but what can you expect from something that's over 40 years old and pretty well used.
B007712XAU|3.0|One of the discs would not play properly and I missed a whole section of important plot information.  Yes I am disappointed.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Geez...I totally LOVED this book...but the ending stinks!  Unfinished...and leaves you hanging so bad. You have to finish it yourself. That's why I give four stars.
B008ALAHA4|4.0|I'm generally happy with this adaptor.  It allows me to use my old MacBook power supply, which is what I needed it for.
B008PZ69Q6|5.0|My husband has enjoyed this album very much, and we would purchase this for a friend our family are all Elvis fans.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Liked a lot really. I really really really really really really really really really really really really really really liked the movie.
B00AA0U05A|5.0|I love this CD.  It's a nice change from most music that is played now.  The honky tonk rhythm is very nostaglic.
B007RTAR64|5.0|This is such a cool Collector Barbie. My daughter was thrilled with it. Looks exactly like Katniss and is very detailed.
0452295548|5.0|This is a well written account of Jill's experience, before, during & recovering from her Stroke.  Only a Brain Scientist can truly<br />relate what is happening.  Very helpful to anyone who has had a Stroke or has a friend or relative dealing with the results of a Stroke or head injury!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I keep losing coins every time I die. and it is difficult to earn gems. other than that it is a good game it's challenging but not 2 challenging.
B00BESIKWM|4.0|I thought the movie was pretty good, but it wasn't nothing like the last one. They also waited to long to drop this. But me being a horror flick fanatic would watch it again. So you should give it a try!!
B005JE1JZC|4.0|Sometimes the second book in a trilogy can be building for the last book but I am a big fan of Robin Hobb and haven't found one that I didn't like so far
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I can't help but think what a world we would have if everyone would open their hearts and minds to this message.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|Well written, ingeniuous style, and captivating characters!  We had seen the film and like it once we figured out what was going on.  Now that we've read the book, we want to see the film again.
1936608898|5.0|For the first time I actually understand what is going on in my body when I eat contrary to what is good for my type 2 diabetes.  In the first two weeks, my glucose reading decreased by 76 points.  That isn't all.  I'm never hungry anymore.  Belly fat is decreasing rapidly.  This is the ONLY diet I've tried that actually WORKS in the eight years I've had diabetes.  (I've tried MANY)  One of the best purchases I ever made.
0307596885|5.0|This book touches my heart.  I am so involved all along the way.  Poo Poo to all the nay sayers!<br />Poetic and soulful.
B005LAIIPS|4.0|I was always curious about the Bourne movies, but I guess not curious enough to watch any of them. I read the bio and thought about my step son and I having a movie night, you know with the nutritional foods (yeah right), just us buds with a good movie.<br />Well not exactly. My step son was a no show but I got to watch a really good movie.  Now my step son wants to watch it. Nope............... you snooze, you lose.  Good Movie!
B0011TQLA2|5.0|Love this album! Only wish I could find it on spotify to share it with friends & family there too!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I enjoy the ease of learnign what the weather is going to be like which is available with this application.
B00821OX98|5.0|When I saw the first the minutes of this show when it originally aired, I turned it off. I thought it was going to be another cheap and cheesy series that would die out quickly. When I recently saw a third season was forthcoming, I thought maybe I would give it another look. Boy am I glad I watched it again.  The story line is entertaining, the aliens have superior tech, but not so superior we can't beat them. The movement of the story is satisfying and not too predictable. I am looking forward to the third season.
B003ASLJO0|2.0|I've grown up with actors and actresses still living and lots of them deceased. I was born in the 19, yes 1940's so stop the snickering in the background. Movies then were real: in other words, credibility. They weren't slapped together, artificial. The abusive, violent language that producers allow to make a few bucks is not worth hearing or seeing.<br />Throw this movie ( sorry Clint) in the trash can!
B006LS7DQE|4.0|I had the original puzzle quest on a Samsung a few years ago and loved it.  This update is pure AWESOME!  It is by far the best mobile game I've ever downloaded.  I'm taking a star off because it's not as smooth as some of the others graphically.  The gameplay more than makes up for it!
B005HE5J7I|5.0|Reviews of this book generally referred to the length of the book. Many lost interest after a few chapters. I found it to be a entirely engrossing read, especially on my new iPad Mini. The only thing I would comment is the appearance that the latter chapters seemed underdeveloped, as if the author was tired and ready to complete it. I noticed this with New York, anther Rutherfurd epic.
B00170MYIS|5.0|Exactly what I wanted and needed for one of my Sony cameras at an extremely low price.  Very happy with the purchase.
B001CWOCUO|5.0|Fantastic concert DVD with excellent quality recording. Must buy...ella ella ella ella eh eh eh ella ella eh eh eh
B008EEHRAU|5.0|Wonderful movie, glad to have it available to watch again. This is a great girlfriend and coffee movie. Love IT!
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|How can you go wrong? Action/Adventure done well. Very good premise, above average acting, and promising set-up for continuation of the series.  Recommended, unless you are one of those who don't want to think too much.  Not knocking you. I'm that way sometimes.  This just isn't the movie for it.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This short booklet gives you all the nuts and bolts information you need to lay out your original MSWord file and save it in the right format for uploading and subsequent .mobi conversion by amazon.com.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|if you like a great story, get this book, you won't want to put it down.  You might find it a little heavy on the technical side, but if you like that sort of thing, this is a book for you.  Just the right amount of action, introspection, external forces, and murphy's law.  I highly recommend it
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Loving this game ,I grew up playing Mario brothers,and its so familiar ... my friend told me about it and I'm addicted
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Good app, simple to use, nice display does everything you need for an alarm clock.  I am using the free one, and don't see any need to pay to upgrade it.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Really enjoyed this book. Good read! Like the humor between the main characters. Glad Connor came to his senses! Worth reading.
B00884GR0W|5.0|this game is the first favorite on my favorite shelf on my kindle fire.  But here's the thing, I just finished the last mission from the under world.  I was the thinking &quot;what can I do.&quot; I then thought where's. the humanity.  I mean, you don't need to eat or sleep.  I think the magic and the flying should stay, but I think we should have to do every thing humans do but have a little more.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|I LOVE it! It has a lot of different types of recipes , but you need to buy some sort of fake cash with REAL money that can go up to $100!!
0743270754|5.0|Goodwin's treatment of the workings of Lincoln's government was very interesting.  She drew from letters and commentaries of those involved and others to give a first hand treatment.  I would highly recommend it, especially for anyone interested in Lincoln, or who have seen the movie, Lincoln.
B009FZFONO|5.0|This is one of the best shows on TV with plots,acting and make-up and effects. IF you have not seen this show yet, it's a MUST watch!
B00012QM8G|5.0|Leon Leyson who was the youngest of Schindler's survivors was actually one of my high school teachers and he just passed away a few months ago.  I wanted my grandchildren to watch the movie with me so that the history of  WWII and what happened would never be forgotten.  Many children of this generation do not fully know or understand just what occurred and I want to make sure any children or grandchildren of mine know the truth.
B0084BMUFA|3.0|This book was ok, I was a little young to read this book I think. But it was cool how if I didn't know a word that I could just highlight it and get the definition. The book was very good and I loved the message! I hope to watch the movie sometime!
0670024813|3.0|Although I enjoyed Diamond's book, Germs, Guns, and Steel, I just couldn't get interested in this one.  It was competent, as usual, but I couldn't get past the first chapter.  Probably the topic, more than his treatment of it.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This novel evoked a variety of emotions from pity to laughing out loud. Character buildup is outstanding as is the author's use of the Irish dialect. Surprise ending.
B007SGM084|3.0|Very repetitive and poorly written but given the content and subject matter, it's easy to read quickly. Overall it's was okay.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I chose this rating because of its design. The only problem is some of the levels get harder and then easier but I enjoy it. It deserves 5 stars
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I can't wait for Season 4. The characters, the setting, the stories - all wonderful.  Maggie Smith is the BEST!
B002WV5A9G|5.0|This is a great picture with action, adventure and comedy. The acting is good and the comedic timing is great, which is why this movie has great watch-ability. I watch this movie EVERY time it's on TV so picking it up for around $5 was a no brainer.
1407109367|4.0|I must have seen a number of so-so reviews for this book because when I finally got around to reading it I was primed for something I thought was going to be significantly sub-par compared to the first book.<br /><br />Pleasant surprise! Yes, there are faults. The plot more-or-less follows the same path as the first book, Katniss is frequently just a bit too clueless, some of it is clearly padding, the scene at the cabin was pretty implausible when you think about it, etc. For that stuff, I can only rate this with 3 or 4 stars. But if I'm honest, I have to admit I couldn't put it down. The characters are likable, it's often more sincere and insightful (and brutal) than I would expect of a book aimed at young adults, and even though it isn't fresh (it IS a sequel) it's still well-written and interesting and... fun. It's a genuine page-turner that'll keep you up later than you intend.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really like this game. It is actually quite addictive. I work with horses every weekend&amp;this game helps me get my equine fix during g the week.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|I saw \\"Life of Pi\\" last night and absolutely loved it.  I still feel so overwhelmed by it, its visual splendor and the moving story that kept me involved for the whole time. The latest Ang Lee's film is beauty itself, and everyone involved in creation of such sparkling intelligent and classy entertainment deserves the highest praise and admiration for the work they've done.  I am sure that in two days, \\"Life of Pi\\" will receive majority of Oscars it is nominated for. It deserves them.<br /><br />I hesitated to see it because I did not think that the movie about a boy and a tiger stuck together in the middle of the ocean for months after the horrible shipwreck on the drifting lifeboat which the ferocious tiger first claimed as his territory and a makeshift inflatable raft chained to it which was Pi's fragile shelter would be so compelling and gripping but it was. Roger Ebert said that Life of Pi is \\"a miraculous achievement of storytelling and a landmark of visual mastery\\". I gladly agree with that. I simply can't find anything wrong with \\"Life of Pi.\\" It is beautiful, profound and adventurous story of survival and understanding life with all it offers or throws at us.  It is life affirming even though it takes us along with Pi Patel through unspeakable hardship, losses, and deadly danger of indifferent and indomitable forces of nature's elements and wild creatures. And it manages to say a lot about faith and God without being over-simplistic, preachy or shoving religion in your face. It does help an atheist to understand the believers or at least to try. It also turns itself in unexpected direction when we thought we were in the end of the journey, reflects on the darkest corners of human nature and leaves the viewers asking questions on what they really want to believe and whether they are open to the possibility of miracle in life, in their lives. It is up to the viewers to choose the answer only they would be satisfied with.<br /><br />Peaceful beauty of Pondicherry, former French colony in India that surprisingly for me looked like a charming small French town, totally enthralled me in the beginning of the film that started as a typical coming of age story. Well, it is coming of age story but amazing on so many levels, spiritual, ethical, physical, religious, humanistic, testing the limits of what a human being can deal with and how it would shape him, his life, and his perception of life.  This is an experience, both movie watching and afterthought that will stay with me. What else can I ask for in a movie?  I've always respected and admired Ang Lee and found his movies exquisite. But \\"Life of  Pi\\" is without doubt his best work. Furious tiger, brave boy, magic journey, fascinating story - amazing movie.rry, former French colony in India that surprisingly for me looked like a charming small French town, totally enthralled me in the beginning of the film that started as a typical coming of age story.

B0031RS69G|4.0|I was very much entertained while reading this book. Two protagonists, two personalities, one adventure. A splendid satire of our medieval society.
B00351ZUHY|5.0|When they did a remake of Footloose I wasn't too sure about it. But then I went back to watch the original again. They both make me want to get up and dance, and go buy some red cowboy boots.
B003B02PF4|5.0|I Loved this book, kept me completely intrigued, couldn't put it down. Have enjoyed all of John Grisham's books that I've read.
B0092S4WLY|1.0|I had a hard time with this game.  If you don't figure out the solutions then you are done with the game.  No hints or help.  Just do or die.
B0094K1PW4|2.0|This movie is oriented toward kids, not adults, but there are a lot of scary scenes for young kids and I wouldn't really recommend it for kids under 13 either.<br /><br />The train-crash scene is grossly exaggerated and the alien-creature scenes are so ridiculously dark that you can hardly see anything. There are perhaps very few scenes with decent special effects, which still can't make the rather dragging plot any less boring.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I needed an easy fix when I was on the go and had only my kindle with me. It's very convenient to have the calculator on my kindle because I take it just about everywhere I think I will have a waiting time. Great product !!
