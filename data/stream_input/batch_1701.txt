B0085776BG|1.0|rented this movie,Red Tails but it  never would load so didnt get to watch it.....frustrating !!!!! This has  been happening with greater frequency lately what's up Amazon ?
0316228532|2.0|I really feel that a quote from Thoreau just about covers this novel.  \\"Most men live quiet lives of desperation\\".  Hard to find much hope in this story.
145470246X|5.0|Not had time to tackle a project yet but impressed by the design and her helpfull tips. The illustrations are very good.She is also practical in her advice to try other mediums of resource material.<br />Took the book into college, my students are impressed enough to order it.
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|These are great - what a cute,inexpensive way to decorate my daughter's princess bathroom.  The jewels are a nice added touch.  We let her help stick them on, and she had a blast helping (she's two).<br /><br />They appear to have some good \\"stick\\" to them, but also seem to not be causing damage to the paint - so if that continues to be the case, we will be extremely satisfied.
B000UVT3OI|5.0|Wow I always play this cd in my car and I like most the song make you feel my love.
1439152802|4.0|The story starts strong with 16 year-old Laurel seeing a crime being committing by her mother. After that, there is a slightly confusing scene in the second world war of Laurel's mother, Dorothy, and a friend, Vivian during a bombing in London. The scene is confusing, because the reader doesn't have all the information yet. It wasn't off-putting though and reading the scene back after finishing the book, everything fell into place.<br /><br />I didn't find the story completely convincing. Laurel's mother was old and frail, but rather than going through great lengths to find out what her mother's secret was, Laurel could have tried a bit harder at asking her mother.<br /><br />I wasn't sure about the order in which the story was told. That is, generally we first read a bit about the past and then about Laurel trying to find out what happened at that time. Because of that, I didn't find the story too compelling, because the reader already knew what Laurel didn't. There are a few \\"cliffhangers\\". While this felt rather contrived, it did work to make me interested in the next part of the story!<br /><br />While I could take or leave most of the book, I was really grabbed by the last quarter of the book. By then, there really was a mystery to be solved and I was actively thinking along. And close to the end, there is a shocking revelation, that changed my whole idea about the story (which is why I read some of the beginning again) and finally made me decide this was a good novel after all.
B005LAIHZE|3.0|Look, it's not a blockbuster or a great movie...  But if you're into this sort of fictional/alternative history (i.e. Fatherland, It Happened Here, etc.  Granted those two are more plausible \\"what-if\\" scenarios), this was a fun movie.  Good special effects, decent acting, just simply fun to watch.  Don't go into it prepared to be blown away or walking away a better person for having seen it.  Take it for what is.  If I could've done 3-1/2 instead of 3 stars, I would have.  Best way I'd describe it:  It was fun to watch & I enjoyed it.  But I won't be buying it.  I have NOT read the book, but I've heard it is MUCH better & i know some things from the book are left out.
B0098VXE50|5.0|This was an enjoyable, movie. I give it 5 stars!!! We loved  so much that we watched it over and over.
B0017P520U|5.0|This is a great adventure and a wonderful representation of a really old story.  I will enjoy it many times in the future.
B008PJ3IDO|5.0|Every time I listen to Walking Papers, I find something new to like.  Catch hooks in the songs, but still heavy enough to satisfy the rocker in you.  McCready's guitar work is stellar.  This is a heavy hitter in my iPod now.  I bought this because of my love for Pearl Jam, and I've used it to convert some of my friends who weren't big PJ fans in the first place.  Great CD.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game rocks my balls its so fun you explode with awesome niss.I LOVE IT.  SO MUCH THIS GAME IS BEING PAYED FROM ME.
B009NCM248|5.0|I always liked Stone Sour, but with this album they've grown from what felt like a side project of Corey Taylor into a group capable of producing something Slipknot never could. While it does have some furious tracks that could certainly be mistaken for Slipknot songs at face value, the album itself adds up into a nearly surreal experience of a young man struggling to find himself. It is best listened to in it's entirety before being judged, I believe. It may only get a few singles, but I can't wait to get my hands on part 2 at the start on next year already.
B002PEP4SC|4.0|A fun read with contemporary slant on female detective work. Now that I know the main character, Nikki Heat, I look forward to following her exploits in the next book in the \\"Heat\\" series.
B00005N6KG|4.0|They are very lightweight .. these are very comfortable for listening music while walking and travelling.<br />good quality music and very cheap price.
B0083XFFWO|1.0|I loved the face of this watch, except for the fact that you have to look closely at the hands in order to see what time it is. The biggest downside and reason why I gave this watch one star was because it has one of the cheapest bands that I have ever owned. So cheap that I actually returned it because it squeaked really bad and constantly pulled the hairs on my wrist. I've owned a few stainless steel Timex watches in the past and I highly doubt that this was even a Timex. Be wary when you purchase.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|It's a good game. Also it is addicting too. but it needs faster data. I was playing and the graphics slowed down and I lost. And I had the highest scrore and like 100,000 coins and when I opened the app I lost all my data and coins. Kiloo ApS needs to work on the game saving data and better graphics.
B005UBNKZG|5.0|Good cpu AMD rules esp for gaming what more can i say pair it with a good cpu cooler like liquid ones and you good to go enjoy.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|you know how you watch a zombie movie and then it ends, really sucks right??? well this zombie film just keeps going on and on and on and on... if u like good flicks than order this on amazon.com or watch on sunday nights at 9PM om AMC....
B002GYI9C4|5.0|This is a wonderful story.  The characters are written in a believable fashion, the World is internally consistent with itself, and the plot flows so naturally that it never breaks the fourth wall.  Several times in the story a character has wondered something that I myself was wondering for just a short time, Pulling me deeper into the tale.  Few books have ever brought a tear to my eye, and this is one of them.<br /><br />  I highly recommend this book for anyone who enjoys political intrigue, fantastical powers, coming of age tales, and stories that make you both laugh and cry.
B002KFJWBG|4.0|This album sat forgotten amoungst my vinyl collection until I heard an interview with Rod Argent and Colin Blunstone on NPR. Afterwards, I pulled out the record but it was too badly damaged from years of overuse. Listening again reminds me why I played it so often - it is a real gem from the 60s.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  The action was amazing; my favorite was, spoiler alert, the part with Porphys when Frank was a gigantic goldfish.  If any one is having second guesses to buy this book, do yourself a favor and buy it.  Of course make sure that you've bought and read the first two books, but I'd assume that that's a given.  I also loved when, spoilers, Annabeth tricked Arachne into weaving one of those not-so-Chinese handcuffs, but I saw it coming from half-way through the book when, another spoiler, Annabeth helped Frank with his not-so-Chinese handcuffs and the book commented on it being a \\"woven prison\\" and it doesn't take a rocket scientist to put two and two together and get that \\"woven prison\\" lined up with the \\"woven prison\\" from the prophecy.  But that's my only complaint and it's a flimsy one at that.  Riordan, please do not make the next book long in coming because I'm dying for more.
B0051QIGP4|2.0|Not her best album especially in comparison to her 1st one. Does have maybe 2/3 songs I like. Glad I only paid .99 during the 24hr special.
B009329ZF2|4.0|At first, I thought to myself what story line can they pull off from a game. I was very surprised and entertained. I liked it a lot.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Very well written story. Could not wait to get back to it whenever I had to stop reading. Amy was really scary.
B007SSEBCU|2.0|The story has much more potential. I think the film is slow and sometimes boring. Without punch. I don't recommend it. I didn't like it.
B008G8SFGO|5.0|This is the best CD/Album KISS has released since Revenge.  I like every song and at least 5 titles could be released as singles.
0345803507|5.0|Relationships need a good beginning, then a lot of hard work.  The start was wonderful, the sex scenes are amazing and even liked the ending.
B009YDAUJ0|5.0|There are two big characters in the comics who are fully seen in this episode.  These are Michonne and the Governor.  Michonne will be part of the good guys whereas the Guv is one of the worst guys we meet in the comic series.  This is such a big introduction that we don't even see the other camp or Rick in this episode. The Guv is one of these psychopaths in this new world who is capable of leading but he is very twisted.  Michonne is a warrior. I found it fascinating to see how well these two characters were brought to the screen version.<br /><br />Andrea has been with Michonne for 7 months on the road.  She is a character who doesn't seem large but the thing is that she is enduring. I just read the 103rd comic in the series this month and Andrea is still alive and well.  You can't say that about many of the characters in this series. Andrea is the best shot in Rick's group which makes her important for the group. She is the only one capable of getting up high and picking off the enemy expertly with a rifle. Since Andrea is with Michonne, she is also a big character in this episode.<br /><br />Darryl's brother, who does not exist in the comics version, finally appears again, as we suspected he would.  His missing hand has been fashioned into a metal weapon which is quite effective.  He's the Guv's right hand man.  He wants to see his brother Darryl again.  Since Darryl is also not in the comics, I don't know what that means for the future.  So far these are the only two who do not exist in the original comics version.<br /><br />It is seeing a new society form with a new leader which keeps me glued to my seat week in and out.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|My son's favorite line from the movie \\"and Hulk, smash\\".<br />Fantastic movie!!  2.5 hours flew right by!<br />Even though it's full of awesome props, non-stop action and a damn solid story, The Avengers works because the actors are clearly loving every moment of what they're doing.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|omg i love this game it tots fun it is one of ky fav games on the kf yaaaa so fun

0316228532|5.0|Can I just suggest to people that if they find long books with lots of characters difficult, that they don't read this? While you're at it, don't read Middlemarch, Bleak House or War and Peace.<br /><br />Similarly, don't read it if you are offended by references to sex, drugs or people living in poverty.<br /><br />This is a modern parable, full of impassioned anger at the contempt the rich have for the poor. The wealthier characters in the book literally want to disburden themselves of the poor people occupying the council estate, by making them someone else's responsibility. The  one person who has the compassion to want to help the worst off, Barry Fairbrother (note the name) is dead, and no-one else cares quite enough to make a difference. Rowling is great at creating a sense of place and showing us how the life of every person in this community touches on someone else's, however much they want to keep themselves separate. No man is an island, John Donne, said, and Rowling challenges the view that we can just shunt the poor off and pretend that they're nothing to do with us. The ending is tremendously bleak, but it's not all a grim read - there are some comic touches that are reminiscent of Dickens's attitude towards characters such as the Veneerings.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|This book was honestly amazing.  Being bullied, I could kind of relate to the story and found myself never beiong able to put it down.  I literally sat down and read it without getting up once.
B0046B3QTG|4.0|Very cute movie. Although a little old for my 3 year-old to understand but that doesn't stop her from asking to watch it over and over. A good movie for kids 6 and older
B00471TLZS|4.0|Movie is a little tame by today's standards but it has an actual story that starts with why you should even care about the people. Then the weirdness starts, builds and puts you on edge. Good for tweeners and up!
B0095R64AO|3.0|This movie has a really good plot.. But I expected the movie to be funnier. I think that with the way the story was in the end it just did not have room for too much funny scenes without seeming like it was trying too hard. Overall it's a good movie to rent for either date night or girls night.
B000RK73LW|3.0|I did not purchase this album or dvd for one reason: I already own all but one of the songs. (All but the song Raglan Road can be found on previous albums.) You can see the discography for \\"Alhambra\\" by going to Wikipedia and typing in \\"Nights from the Alhambra.\\" That way you can see what songs you are getting.<br /><br />A better buy for big fans of Loreena McKennitt (like me) would be \\"A Mediterranean Odyssey,\\" which has a fair few new songs, composed after 2009. \\"Mediterranean Odyssey\\" does not, however, have Raglan Road, which is, I think, only found on \\"Alhambra.\\" I may have to go to iTunes or Amazon and try and buy Raglan Road separately as a download...<br /><br />I do not doubt that the dvd of \\"Alhambra\\" must be really something, though, after all that has been spoken in the comments about it.<br /><br />Having said all that, a newcomer to Loreena McKennitt would probably be hard pressed to find a better single album than \\"Alhambra\\" just judging from its selection of songs - even though my current favorite album is still \\"The Book of Secrets.\\"
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I reread the first book, and I enjoyed this book, not as much as the first.  I would recommend this series and have in the past
B009NQKPUW|5.0|One of the best Blu-ray sets of the year.  The picture and sound are amazing, it will give you HDTV a true workout. And if you like knowing the thoughts of the people behind the film you get the commentaries from director Ridley Scott and the writers.  Plus there is the excellent 'Furious Gods' documentary about the making of Prometheus.  The only thing this set lacks is a director's cut of the film.
B000PKX2KA|5.0|Needed a good backup for my laptop plotter and as a primary GPS to use when I bring it home from the boat.
B001C4CI8A|5.0|Good chemistry amongst the actors, not bogged down in anyone area, and it is very accurate to field ops good and bad.
B0061S073A|3.0|I love how this organizes all my son's apps on one page, starts when the Kindle is turned on and brings him back to his home page when home is pressed. He can't get into other places on my Kindle Fire. I made sure the setting would block the Internet but apps are still able to get through to the Internet. So far he's sent two emails (through a drawing app that lets you share) and purchased almost $30 of videos through Amazon Video. I allowed him access to Amazon video since we have Prime and there are tons of videos he can watch for free but it is allowing him to purchase the videos. Thankfully Amazon refunded my money and showed me how to restrict purchasing using the Kindle Parental Controls I didn't know existed.<br /><br />So for the home page, starting when the Kindle is turned on, and changing the home page this is great. Don't expect it to prevent your child from accessing the Internet. This combined with the proper Kindle parental controls is good though.
B007STXHTM|5.0|Ok, so I bought this for my HDH 2 to go diving and eliminate the curved lens look for other projects.  I have tested video, time lapse and photo underwater. However I only got it down to 5' after my SCUBA trip happened but the dive company went under, ba bump bump. So I used it in hotel pool to test. No leaks, clear footage, and drop lets side off lens real easy.<br /><br />Side note: I stopped by home depot and bought 1/2\\" 4x90 degree threaded elbows, 2x8\\" threaded pipe, 4x6\\" threaded pipe, 3 solid nuts threaded, and one 3 way T threaded.  Built my own under water rig to mount my Hero to.  Imagine an old aiplane control stick setup for two hands. Wide mount the 8\\" pipe with \\"T\\" in middle and extra pipe in the \\"T\\" facing forwad.  Mount camera to forward pipe. Now on the wide 8\\" pipes put 90 degree elbows. Insert 6\\" pipe in each elbow. Now balance the angle of these as grips and the front facing pipe so it feels like flying a 747. Now put in the sealed nuts into all open pipes.  This provides some bouncy on surface. Now you have asked yourself, why whould I build this.  First it cost me $10 vs the $200 kit online. Second you can mount your own dive lights. Third and last is TSA sucks and you can colapse this into a plastic sack and weighs only 3-4 ounces. Boyah!
B008YZXYY2|5.0|My god, I honestly can not accurately convey with words how amazing this album is. It's beautiful, gorgeous, sensitive, brutal, heavy, motivating, depressing, and happy -- all at once. Absolute Zero is motivating and heavy, Taciturn is sensitive and beautiful, Travelers pt. 1 is almost happy, but depressing as well. These are the three songs I'm just listening to over and over, the rest of the album is excellent too, but these three songs have me basically hypnotized and I just listen to them constantly.<br /><br />One thing that really stands out is a sense of renewed energy. Audio Secrecy seemed like most of it was forced, House of Bone and Gold sounds like the debut album from a band that is newly formed and bursting with new, fresh ideas. I've never heard anything like it honestly.<br /><br />Another thing I really notice is just how much better Corey is as time goes by. His lyrics have never been bad and I've always enjoyed them, but at this point he's just far superior to his former self in the lyrical department. He's actually poetic at times: \\"I think I'm happy, mostly happy, on a green autumn day. I'm walking lazy, barely moving, I settle out and fade away...\\" \\"In the middle, under a cold, black sky, The sun will only burn for you and I, In the moment.. Before I lose my mind, These hours don't mean anything, this time..\\"<br /><br />His vocals genuinely get better every album too and this one is no exception. The dude is one of the most amazing artists of our time and will undoubtedly go down as one of the greatest rock minds in history.<br /><br />Really, this album is a treasure -- one of those rare pieces of art that cause you to feel butterflies and relate with the pain, anger, happiness, or any other emotion conveyed in the music. I HIGHLY, HIGHLY, HIGHLY recommend House of Bone and Gold pt. 1. If you like rock you will LOVE this album.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|I am slowly getting into this series after all the raves online saying this is a must see.  First off, make sure the kiddoes are in bed before even putting into the dvd player. It is graphic, violent, and a little pornish, but with that said, it is to HBO's high standards.
B008KL2ITW|5.0|I loved every moment f the book. I was recommend this book but my friend refused to tell me what it was about \\"just read it!\\" She told me, so did not knowing what the book was about and I'm so happy j didn't know because every chapter was anew soldier and the entire book was so original and new :)
B000FC1HBY|5.0|A continuation of book one that loses nothing in its' fascinating panorama of multiple main characters as their lives intertwine in a tale of the worst and best of human nature with realistic scene and geographic description and improbable yet gripping fantasy.....well written and gripping.
B008JIFJ4W|4.0|I really enjoyed this album. All of the tracks are pretty good. While the album as a whole has its own feel, each of the songs also has individual character.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|It's difficult to remember when engrossed in reading of this book that the events were not real.  The characters come alive and like real life they are a mixture of good and bad traits yet there are those that are pure evil as well.  All the elements of human interaction are included in a skillful manner and the scenes are set in great detail where one can feel the weather's effects and the emotions of the players.........almost Shakespearean without the iambic pentameter......an epic novel of violence, love, deceit.....all of it.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|The Perks of reading this book are style, characters and heartbreak. I recommend to anyone that likes to walk in others shoes for a bit.
B003JTHWPA|5.0|\\"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter\\" is an excellent novel. I had to read it for class, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that it's a book I would read again. McCullers' style is easy to read, and the way the book focuses each chapter around one character keeps you turning the pages to see how each individual story unfolds. I also liked that the book makes you think about the prejudices we have against others without being preachy. It's almost like its the original version of the film \\"Crash\\" in some ways.
B003XF1OJK|4.0|Second time reading this one. Loved the games and the story gives Halo an origin. Also gives a great history on the Master Chief!
1400082773|5.0|I really enjoyed reading his book.  I will buy more books if he writes them.  It kept my interest through the entire book.
B00992CF6W|5.0|minecraft is one of the best games ever. but when will the free version come out for the kindle fire? I'm trying to get my bff to try this game but she refuses to pay the overpriced 7 dollars. (this game should be $1.99) thanx tor letting me review this app!!!!' ;)
0307455874|5.0|He is such an interesting writer, as well as a wonderful President.  I certainly will buy more of his books.
B007RTAR64|5.0|Great looking model of an actual character. My 13 year old loves the books and the movies and wanted this doll as a collector piece. Would love to see some other characters from the movie made.
034580404X|5.0|I had no intension of reading this trilogy after reading reveiws and hearing about what its about.  Then I went to a Bachelorette party and EVERYONE had either read or was reading the books.  So I ordered the set (from Amazon) and read the trilogy in 9 days!!  I read a lot before I go to bed but never have I finisihed a series so fast.  I couldnt put the books down, if you enjoy romance novels and you can be open minded with the sex scenes then I recommend this series.  I found myself laughing at times and feeling embarassed other times.  Last night I watched The Thomas Crown Afair and noticed quite a few similarities, thought that was interesting.  This series is worth the read but only if you can remain open minded to some unrealistic sex scenes (she O's at him saying her name....give me a break) and some rather kinkey stuff.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|excellent app. many great features and brilliant display. features are easy to access and easy to navigate through. I recommend this app.
B008DVJMAW|5.0|Wow!!! What a great album. I have purchsed the other BBS albums but this one blows them out of the water. The sound that BBS has aquired is one you just don't hear anymore. Highly recommend buying this album you will NOT be disappointed.
B000J5XS3C|5.0|I love Karaoke and was tired of the crappy karaoke machines out there.  I have a nice Stereo system and just wanted a way to connect a microphone to it while playing youtube karaoke videos.  This was the exact solution.  You will need a few other accessories as, including a Dual 1/4 Inch To RCA Cable.  I am sure that this mixer can be used for much more sophisticated audio uses but I have yet to explored them.

0316228532|2.0|I waited with eager anticipation for the release of this book.  I did manage to finish it but was so disappointed in the chopped manner that the story was told and that there were so many confusing characters.<br />I had wished that Rowling had put a list of characters in the front of the book to help us readers keep track!
0393338827|5.0|Very interesting and enjoyable to read. Great perspectives on the 2008 financial meltdown, and really piqued my interest in studying finance and statistics.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Getting the 3D Blu-ray, Blu-ray, DVD, and Digital copy all for $19.99 was an amazing deal. Loved the movie, and I can't wait to watch it in 3D at home!
B008QE9XD2|1.0|Tim Burton's movie adaptation of the Dark Shadows soap opera is a travesty, a waste of valuable celluloid, and an affront to the memory of Jonathan Frid, who makes a cameo appearance. The movie should be offensive to any Dark Shadows fan. It goes without saying that even with its limitations, the original Dark Shadow episodes are far superior to the pablum Burton serves with this movie. Johnny Depp maintains he was a Dark Shadow fan. This hard to believe, because if he was a true fan of the original series he would not have consented to acting in this role and would have had nothing to do with the making of this movie.<br /><br />A real fan of Dark Shadows should stay far, far away.
B008IJTFYW|3.0|I like a few of the sound boards on this app. There are too many bugs in it as it crashes my phone and if you exit out of the app, the timer won't stay on playing the music. This is a take it or leave it app. Too many bugs
B007NWCZR4|5.0|I could play the BOYS like eating potatoe chips just one right after another. What a compilation.

B004WR125O|5.0|I use this USB wireless LAN adapter for me Onkyo TX-NR609. It works s advertised. Setup is easy, especially if your main router supports WPS. Connection speed is relatively fast and seems pretty responsive although I have only used it for Pandora so far. I especially like it because it is very small form factor. Since it plugs in the front of the receiver I was worried about it protruding out or not looking too good. It is so small I hardly notice it.<br /><br />Wired connections are always but when you can't get a wired connection to your receiver, this UWF-1 is a great low cost solution. I paid about $25 on Amazon plus free shipping.<br /><br />One more note: My wireless router is on the 2nd floor. The receiver is on the 1st floor. They are located for the most part one above the other. I would say the straight-line distance between them (assuming the ceiling is not there) is about 15 feet.
B004LWZW4M|5.0|This is exactly the reason I stopped going to the zoo to stand at the gorilla enclosure and stare at these magnificant animals.  The last time I went, about20 years ago, the silver-back glared back at me, then stood up and turned his back to us, sat down and did not move.  That was probably Ceasar's daddy!  I will forever watch from afar and be grateful I don't live in San Francico's Marin County!! :>)

B0006GVKGG|1.0|Cliched characters.  Unlikely outcome.  They get together...they split up...they get together...etc...They talk lots about their feelings.  The sexual mores of the time would hardly have been consistent with the amount of sh  gging.  Amazing how pregnancy not considered or discussed.  Highly unlikely.  I never want to hear another violin.  The older characters are convincing but not the actors who play their younger selves but then the plot and dialogue so poor that no wonder.

B006VA57CY|5.0|This is the best entertainment I have seen in a long time,I cant stop watching it! And I have gotten a lot of others hooked too! We all agree, the acting,the production,the clothes are the best weve seen! I wish American T.V. would do the same!
B008LSVLZG|5.0|What to say besides excellent...I appreciate the way this band has developed.  Steven has had several guitar players in his solo group, but as a whole, it is a truly awesome band.  I am a die-hard Porcupine Tree fan, but I appreciate the way Steven Wilson follows his muse and I think his 'solo' work has been phenomenal.  I saw this group in NYC and it was frustrating because there was no seating and we had to stand for about two hours before the band got going, but SW apologized for the mix-up...very thoughtful of him.  Both Porcupine Tree dvds were and are fantastic, and again SW has outdone himself.  Apparently, there are potential sound problems on some player formats...I had trouble with Windows media player, but the sound was pristine when I used VLC or a component dvd player.  Phenomenal concert.  And well recorded and presented.
0307730697|5.0|I ordered this  book on the Kindle.  The story of the life of Adam Brown is nothing short of a miracle.  His determination to achieve his dream of being a leader on the most advanced team of Navy SEALs is inspiring.  His unwavering faith in God is amazing.  Thank you Adam Brown for your service to our country and for paying the ultimate sacrifice. Thank you to his family and friends for telling his story and the author, Eric Blehm, for writing it.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book was fantastic. I was on the edge of my seat seat the entire time. I finished it in two days because I simply refused to put it down. Riordan did an excellent job of allowing his characters to age without losing sight of who they are. I love this book =)
B008I3R2VG|5.0|If you are a fan of The Killers buy this album now! :) If you are not a fan of The Killers and haven't listened to them since they first got big then you should still check this album out.<br />The band's sound has evolved a lot since Hot Fuss.<br />Battleborn is a diverse album with catchy fast paced songs, slowed down songs showing Brandon's improved range, and songs that are just too unique to classify. My favorite song off this album is A Matter Of Time. It has an awesome flow back and forth between intense rock and soft rock. Other ones that really stand out to me are Miss Atomic Bomb, Flesh and Bone, Deadlines and Commitments, From Here on Out, Prize Fighter, and Be Still.<br />But they are all good. I can honestly say I like all the songs on here and don't have any that I always skip over.<br />I think this is The Killers's second best album behind Sam's Town.
B004XJHBCE|3.0|It used to be utterly fantastic. Definitely one of my most used apps. But for the past week or so it crashes every time I try and launch the app it crashes while loading the list of apps. And every time I install a new app FO crashes. It's very disappointing, since I use this app so much.
B008602KQI|5.0|Awesome movie.  I have watched this movie at least 30 times and my 9 year old loves it too.  It may be a little scary for younger viewers, but my 9 year old watches it over and over without ever getting scared.  Great movie.  My best purchase yet!
B001GQSY64|5.0|Hell Yea!!!! Just got my Star Wars The Clone Wars on Blu-Ray, AND I was given the Target Edition with the Star Wars The Clone Wars Shipyard of Doom comic book! I didn't even know that was included! The movie is great! The movie did took a while to get here though. Still AWESOME MOVIE!!!!
1416955070|5.0|This book was amazing yah it was similar to Harry Potter but everyone loved Harry Potter... This book Love Triangle drives me crazy why cant she, Clary, Have everyone?!?!?! ugh i love it i wish i could read forever. JK but for real with all the twist and surprises its like OMG did NOT see that coming like Simon... that is all i'm saying. I really think teenagers will love these book, I would know i am one not a grown up reading a teenage book criticizing... like they know what we like. Just read it i GTG lol enjoy...
B000683VI4|5.0|This is an excellent movie with a moving storyline that will get your attention and keep you involved. This is a must see movie for all.
0741470314|5.0|DEFENDING A KING ~ HIS LIFE AND LEGACY is a must read!!!!  This book gives a magnificent portrayal of MJ in a very accurate manner owing to the fact of  Dr. Moriarty's above and beyond research. I found this book very captivating and effortless to follow. I recommend this book for those who want a well rounded depiction of the \\"King\\".
B008673ZAQ|4.0|This book was ok but not as good as the first one Bared to You it was jumping around to much to many things happening all at once should have split up this book into two different books the whole thing w/the step brother and Gideon telling Eva to just wait that was all to much for one book I will be waiting for the next book to see what happens with these two love birds
B002TVQ4H6|5.0|because it's a good one.  I've seen it classified as horror but it's not a horror flick in the sense of ghouls jumping out at you.  Rather it's a horror film in the realm of ideas, so it could just as easily be classed as science fiction.  I'll compare it with Groundhog Day in that it's a time-loop film but whereas Groundhog Day is comedic, Triangle is dark.  Bill Murray had the advantage that he always had great recollection of his time loops but what if you're the character and it's not like that?  What if the only thing you have left of the loop is deja vu, some hazy feeling that you've been here before?  How would you know where you are in the loop?  Melissa George doesn't know.  Neither do we.  Watch the movie.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|This album definitely lives up to Macklemore's expectations of a mix of inspiring and fun music that has quality messages and bars.
B002UM5BXW|3.0|Drawn by the desire to know what really happens in most kitchens across the U.S., I hungrily read Chef Bourdain's book.<br />It is his personal diary of his journey through a world few of us will ever know or understand, yet we crave the results of it and pay big bucks for it.<br />This book is not for the faint of heart, working in the kitchen of a restaurant is not glamorous and the people are not normal. Of course you don't want them to be, you want them to have the drive and passion and shear insanity to create food for the hunger crazed diners who have their own psychiatric problems.<br />This book takes you into the kitchen, has you tasting things you may never have eaten, preparing food in ways you may not understand and has you shaking your head in disbelief that Chef Bourdain is still alive in the end.<br />The honesty is refreshing and the humanity grounding. In this current world of the foodie movement, where the restaurant dujour is a status symbol, if you get in, I now have a new appreciation for those restaurants whose chefs are cooks.
B0072OFOM6|5.0|Another great chapter to the legend of Spartacus! I'd highly recommend this, especially in Blu ray. It won't let you down
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I learned new words from the dictionary that I never knew before and I know how to use them and confuse people with dictionary talk :)
B008673ZAQ|1.0|This was an accidental purchase made when showing my mom how the Kindle works, and egad! It looked awful!!! I luckily got a refund, and it was very easy to do, Amazon is wonderful!
B003CR9BYE|1.0|No problem with the disc itself or your service.  My problem is I thought there would be more focus on Tony Jobim, but the CD was almost entirely about Sinatra.  I mean, Frankie was a great interpreter of song, but Jobim was more special to me, since I love his melodies.<br /><br />So thanks.<br /><br />S. Charles
B0069JBKHI|5.0|This is one of the best things I have ever purchased!  The battery doesn't last long but besides that its great.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|This is a really good movie.  Very touching.  I enjoyed it and so did my friends. I am running out of words.
B009AJD5E0|5.0|When I first watched this movie I didn't know that it was a prequil to the Alien series. Which is one of my favorite movie series. This film is well done and the ending is left to give us fans another if they choose. I love the fact that they pulled archeology and the mythology of the giants into a clear picture of life here on earth in the ancient of days. Great Movie!!
1455502758|4.0|A poignant, darkly humorous, and ultimately touching journal about \\"living dyingly.\\" One can't help but be amazed by Hitchens' intellect, love of life, and drive to enlighten. His Saul Bellow quotation, that  \\"death is the dark backing that a mirror needs if we are able to see anything,\\" is perfectly suited. I am enriched by this slim volume of insight.
B00992CF6W|4.0|needs water buckets and online multiplayer and BLUETOOTH and every one wants to set off the TNT on creative mode not just for show!
B008FSCNTK|5.0|WOW that is what I say about this album, but then again when have I ever heard a Diana Krall I did not like???
B0092G1O8A|5.0|My favorite movie ever!!! An it came before arival date an works perfect an for a low price ! I watch it almost all the time
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|I couldn't put it down.  It was entertaining but also inspirational.  He restores hope that we have good people in this country and gives great descriptions of  reasons for war along with compassion.
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|or you'll regret the time you spend going after your refund.  I purchases 2000 coins through Amazon ( let's not evaluate my sanity for that at this time.).  The screen said that my purchase was successful, but coins did not show up.  Then, the app crashed and told me to reinstall.  So I lost all of my stupid progress by uninstalling and I STILL DID NOT GET MY COINS.<br /><br />Total waste of time and effort.
0385344333|1.0|This is the worst of all of the Reacher novels.  Mr. Child seems to have started putting trash out because his fan base is big enough for him to make money with a bad product.  He has grabbed my cash for the final time.
1934030198|5.0|This book is simply amazing. Inside it lays out so much detail and helpful information for triathletes ranging from beginner to elite. Highly recommend.
B00729GQ0A|4.0|In the realm of Paranormal steaminess, The Forever Girl does not disappoint in turning up the heat. This romance is centered around twenty-two year old Wiccan protagonist Sophia. From the onset it is clear Sophia is not an ordinary girl with her mental static, her reputation as the town witch and her bad luck at being around whenever strange deaths occur. Then, if things weren't weird enough for her, she begins hearing voices, dead people and animals with sulfur-green eyes that glow in the dark. Ominous signs abound. So then the next logical progression? Enter the vampires.<br /><br />Okay, so in this book they are not called vampires, but elementals. They have some creative new powers and a mythology that stems back decades. Sophia finds herself wrapped up in all this when her friend Ivory takes her to a mysterious night club. There she encounters Charles, the sexy and mysterious dream guy who of course is a paranormal creature, one she is extremely attracted to. Now the question is, how can she uncover the secrets of her past, while managing her feelings for Charles and staying alive against the forces that seek to destroy her and her love?<br /><br />Buy the book to find out.<br /><br />The Forever Girl has many striking similarities with Twilight. Critics have pounced on this, calling it a rip off. However, sales alone indicate that Hamilton is merely tapping into a fad that people want. Women want the sexy and dangerous love interest; the kind, but troubled damsel in distress; and the evil, fanged antagonist. Sure, this story is similar to Twilight, but I think that is what most readers find appealing.  While reading I found myself making connections between Twilight and this story, but it did not detract from my enjoyment. Hamilton is a clear professional. You won't find errors, weak subplots or stilted dialog. This book reads like any you would pull off a store shelf. And the passion between Sophia and Charles? Stephenie Meyer has nothing on Hamilton. A word of caution: while the sexual references are tasteful and by no means pornographic, this book is not intended for children. It is written for \\"New Adults\\" a burgeoning category that seeks to entertain the 18-30 crowd. And those 18-30 year-olds have not been disappointed.<br /><br />If you enjoyed this review you can follow Underground Book Reviews on Facebook or Twitter and subscribe to our newsletter.

B008G8SFGO|1.0|Might i say right from the start, this is the best band in the world, in my opinion.<br />I have loved them and bought nearly every album since the self titled 1st. Ive collected books,magazines,dolls,puzzels...ect and anything else i could get my hands on.<br />Until this album the only one i had trouble liking was Carnival of Souls.Im not saying its a bad album but just not a good kiss album.<br />Now the bad news! Ive listened to this at least half a dozen times so i could be fair with a rating.And what ive come up with is; This is the biggest pile of shit they have ever done!! I cant believe the hype over this crap,there was nothing memorable on the whole thing. I was so dissapointed that i even went back and put Sonic Boom on just to cheer myself up!<br />I hope this is not the end and they do come back with another album, that we can all be proud to own and put in our Kiss collections. But until then dont waste your money on this garbage!! Listen to it first you've been warned!!
0345444051|4.0|I'm still not completely sure how much I liked this book. No question, it is very good, but I think I expected a little bit too much... so, maybe the star I took out of my rate was just because my anticipation was too high ;-)<br /><br />The story had stood the passage of time and doesn't seem outdated; it's straight, centered more on the plot than on characters, without jumps in time, and it's that kind that leaves you wondering about the possibilities and questions raised throughout the tale. Don't expect to have all the answers, a good deal is left to feed the thought.<br /><br />Certainly a worthwhile reading for those who like Sci-Fi.
0553386794|2.0|I read this because I LOVE Game of Thrones on HBO. While the book played out just like the show, I couldn't finish the book. I kept putting it down and not picking it up for days. The book reads much slower than seeing the show, which is maybe why I didn't love it.<br />The characters are great, have wonderful depth and while hating some of them, you still love them.<br />The book just wasn't for me, but I highly recommend the show to anyone who has read them.
B004SIIBGU|4.0|I have been using this APP for about 5 days now and find that for what I need it to do  it's workable. It seems a bit quirky but that may be because of the cheap tablet I'm running it on.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|The Avengers combo pack was a good deal for the cost.  4 different options in one package. With the 3-D BluRay, the regular BluRay the DVD and the digital download this movie can be viewed many times over in many diferent formats.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Really don't have words for this movie. Was awesome all around, watched it three times in a 48 hour period, just can't get enough it
B004Q7CIFI|1.0|and I have read EVERY word King has written. I pre-ordered even though I dislike &#34;history&#34;. I put off starting it because it sounded boring. I read reviews to try and jumpstart my interest. Until now I've only ever not finished a book once because it was terrible. I've just read more reviews to try to find some reason to read on, but I just can't. Can I have the &#34;Real King&#34; back, please?
B009KHDT0C|3.0|DVD came earlier than expected and in perfect new condition.Both exterior and interior packaging were intact with plenty of padding. Always enjoy ordering from Amazon. I do enjoy Johnny Depp movies though this one left us more confused than when we started watching it. We had many unanswered questions at the movie's end but still some funny moments. Seventies soundtrack was awesome and the guest appearance of Alice Cooper priceless.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Couldn't  organize my life without it.  It's on all my computers, phone, and Kindle.  I use it for filing web receipts, pictures of parts to take shopping with me, lists of many types, birth dates, recipes to shop from at the grocery store and then display on the Kindle while I prepare it.  I keep important info organized such as passwords, membership numbers, addresses, list of my prescriptions with reorder dates, pet info, family sizes for shopping, etc.  It truly makes my life run smoothly.
B007B5EDEG|5.0|If you have yet to hear of this series I think you had been living where I was! I had heard of the DVD's but didn't know about the books. A friend suggested reading the series first. Great Idea. I am only half way through but have been fascinated by the story. If you enjoy fantasy then this is a series for you. Intrigue, twists and turns and a bit of magic have made this tale very enjoyable so far.
0062127241|3.0|Pete Townshend gives a great deal of himself in this autobiography, but after a while it becomes sort of a big bore. Pete seesm to be pretty honest about his shortcomings, but we just get one woman after another that he grooves on that you can't keep track of them, he keeps buying and selling houses (yawn) and boats (yawn again) and tells you more about recording some of his crappy solo albums than he does about recording and writing great albums by The Who. Kenney Jones comes and goes, much like Richie Cunningham's brother Chuck. In all a pretty standard rock autobiog, though it doesn't come across as one of those \\"told to\\" ones where the star talks into a tape recorder and someone else edits it; it appears Pete wrote it himself.
B008KRJWEK|4.0|this is basically just like temple trunk just better because your killing MUTANTS or ZOMBIES which is amazing 2 kill.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|very enjoyable and addictive! Worth downloading. Especially nice if you can obtsin as a free app. of the day. Works great on kindle fire
B0041D843M|5.0|I found the information and its presentation to be an excellent resource to address the question of animal versus plant protein.  What could have been a difficlut analysis was explained in a manner that almost anyone can understand / comprehend.  This book is one of the best studies I have read on nutrition.
B007VUA7VO|3.0|it doesn't reaally do anything and sometimes its incorrect... plus when I go on an app and plug my kindle fire in to the outlet it goes straight to the battery app...
B005K17RU0|5.0|Great app, never crashes, has radar, forecasts, and accurate updates... excellent!  I love that it has two weeks worth of forecast!
B0063IH60K|1.0|I was very upset when my game began with a Mitt Romney ccommercial. I cant play solitaire without the government interfering...ugh but I really do enjoy the game
0316228532|5.0|I can't believe anyone would give this book less than five stars.  This is a book about the dark side of human nature with a glimmer of hope strewn throughout.  The characterization is incredible, including the fact that Rowling  personifies both Yarvil and Pagford.  The apex of the story is worth several reads.  All the characters lives are intertwined in insidious and unavoidable ways.  Forgiveness is possible, but comes with consequences.  This is an intense, thought provoking read that is creative in its ideology and needs a serious, intelligent reader to appreciate its breadth and depth.  I anxiously await Rowling's next foray into the dark recesses of the human spirit.
B006G3MZRQ|5.0|Oh what a movie, I knew it would be action filled and emotional, but I had no idea that meant sitting on the edge of my seat the entire time and trying to pre-cog who would be the winner.  The pace is wonderful, you learn each character just enough to fall for each on of them and their flaws...and it builds to an amazing ending. The acting was superlative by Hardy and Edgerton and Nolte, and the fight scenes were well choreographed! Zero spoilers here, so I'll stop here and say this movie is a must see. Highly recommended.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Great Movie! Quality is great, display is great. Shop a around for this product with all that it includes, but only found it here for the best Price.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|Just great, watch it twice, too!  Wish it had been a longer film...<br />Acting and effects all very great and sound/score was great, as well.<br />Fassbender and Rapace are excellent in this film.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Incredible!  Thank you to operators and ALL service members for keeping us safe.  Could not put down this book until I finished it.
B0053O89RY|5.0|I do not get to see the regular episodes when they air.  This show is so funny that I am happy to pay to see it.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|EXCELLENT!! FANTASTIC!!! AMAZING!! This book did not let me down...what a great continuation of a wonderful story.  I cant wait until december when the 3rd book comes out!!
B008PCVGKI|5.0|This book is an intelligent, provocative, documented essay on pharmaceutical research as it is conducted today, and how it impacts (negatively) health care for us all. Some readers may feel that the author sets the bar too high, or that he risks demonising an industry which benefits us all. They would be misguided as only writers as Ben Goldacre help society advance where it can and should be today: we deserve so much more by one of the industries which should deliver us so much more. When precision with facts meets a passion for ethics and for improvement, you get the best books: this is one of them.
0060873175|3.0|As others have commented, this book provides an interesting perspective and has a plot that requires a suspension of disbelief. For my part, as a reader, I am willing to suspend disbelief in physics along a large continuum for the sake of plot, but find myself annoyed that the book uses a premise that a modern car with an automatic transmission can be put from park into drive without the brake being depressed -- this is not what suspension of disbelief should be about.
0316228532|1.0|Can't believe the same person who wrote the Harry Potter series wrote this nightmare.  It's probably the most boring book I've even tried to read, but I'm determined to finish it.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|This was a very well written book and I am excited to read the rest of this series. I think this will replace the whole that will be left with the conclusion  of WOT.
B0058YPL66|5.0|Exellent writing and amazing retelling of fairy tales as we know them! My only gripe is that there is no episode guide included.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Not worth reading.  Very sad characters with very low self esteem. I will not read the trilogy for sure.  This is not writting, it's a joke!
B006DJ2JSI|3.0|Just want to look up a word like in a regular dictionary.  Features with this are over kill.  Not that easy to use.
B007MU85D0|5.0|Not a bad song on the record. Love the vocals and driving beats. Dirty Paws and Little Talks are unreal. You shouldn't be reading this, you should be downloading this and dancing to it.
B002BE7JE8|5.0|quality product. It has audio and lgendas en. The resolution is great and the sound also has superior quality. Despite the old movie, deserves to be part of the collection.
B004YM6JK0|5.0|This was a great season. It did a great job of starting a new story arch. Recomend it for any action/sci fi lover.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|I loved this movie.  It answered alot of questions from the original, Alien movies.  There is alot of good action and special effects.  If you like science fiction and action, it is pretty entertaining.  Michael Fassbender and Naomi Rapace are great actors.
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|The Hunger Games DVD -HD arrived quickly and provides excellent presentation of the movie.  The movie is well done and follows the book rather well; within the confines of \\"movie vs book.\\"<br />The cast of characters was well chosen and the set was excellent considering the story.  The movie has to take some liberties and shortcuts in order to deliver the story in a reasonable time period, and the plot with climax flow quickly. You will be on the edge of your seat! The time flies!  If you have not read the book, see this movie and then read the book for deeper understanding and appreciation. The story is amazing and will captivate anyone from middle-school age thru adult!
0316228532|4.0|It's excellently written.<br />A lot of characters who you end up knowing very well.<br />It's one story written in several points of view.<br />I recommend it :)
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I love the flexibility of the alarm.  Works well on my kindle.  I love the use pf math problems. to wake and/or interrupt &amp; prompt me to go to sleep.  Great app.  Can't speak to how much it drains battery.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The book continues, not with a \\" space filler\\" , as I read in some one else's previous view, but with a taut, twisted, edge-of-your-seat, thriller. There are so many surprises I couldn't put the book down. My hats off to a great story teller and an awesome movie sequel. Good job, Suzanne!
0525953728|5.0|This book is really excellent. Frankly, I didn't expect much (except the story of Osama bin Laden's killing), but the quality of the writing and the whole information about the SEALs' life made the reading great experience overall. It's a page turner and I finished it in two days.<br />You get also some info about how much we pay for these wars with all the ships, airplanes, weapons, and people involved in every operation around the world.<br />I feel deeply in debt to these smart, highly trained, selfless, brave guys from the special forces, who put their lives in mortal danger almost every day, serving proudly to their country. Thank you to all of them!

B0071XO8RA|5.0|It's not easy to find great post-apocalyptic/dystopian fiction; most is either short on character, short on logic and consistency or just too damn depressing. Hugh Howey's Wool Omnibus is none of the above -- it's engaging, well-written and the characters are believable as well as lovable. I'm already on the hook for Book 6.
B009UX2YAC|2.0|this is a really fun app but sometimes it freezes up. my kindle doesn't, the APP itself does. it is pretty much like temple run, except there are more characters and powerups and it's more fun! Also when I turned my fire off, it killed all the characters, money, and powerups I had and now I have to start from scratch.<br />sincerely,<br />T.O.F.<br />TWEEN ON FIRE!!!

B0050DIWFC|4.0|Disturbing, entertaining, suspenseful and frustrating all at once - the story and the storytelling.  A 14-yr old boy is accused of killing another 14 yr old boy. Did he do it or not?  Read his father's (Asst. D.A.)narration and courtroom hearing dialogue to find out.
1400067820|5.0|Here is the context (in the Prologue) from which an excerpt serves as the title of this review: \\"By grasping the mechanisms of antifragility we can build a systematic and broad guide to [begin italics] nonpredictive [end italics] decision making under uncertainty in business, politics, medicine, and life in general -- anywhere the unknown preponderates, any situation in which there is randomness, unpredictability, opacity, or incomplete understanding of things.\\" With meticulous care that is among the defining characteristics of his thinking and writing, Nassim Nicholas Taleb explains what antifragility is...and isn't. I wish it were possible to eavesdrop on a conversation between him and Joseph Schumpeter because both of them see great [begin italics] potential [end italics] value in what most people fear or at least try to avoid: destruction, of course, that can in fact be creative but also randomness and uncertainty \\"which also means -- critically --  a love of errors, a certain class of errors.\\" Taleb insists -- and I agree -- that antifragility is a property that helps to explain why some natural and complex systems survive and others do not.  Moreover, he adds, depriving any systems of volatility, randomness, and stressors will harm them.<br /><br />Recall what Taleb has to say about Black Swans -- unexpected major upheavals such as hurricanes -- in a previous book: \\"Black Swans hijack our brains, making us feel we 'sort of' or 'almost' predicted them, because they are retrospectively explainable.\\" Black Swans challenge us to respond effectively to them and -- more often than not -- we overreact with fear. \\"\\"Because of this fear and thirst for order, some human systems, by disrupting the invisible and not so visible logic of things, tend to be exposed to harm from Black Swans and almost never get any benefit. You get pseudo order when you seek order; you only get a measure of order and control when you embrace randomness.\\" Taleb explains how and why to do that. He also includes hundreds of examples of infragility and its impact in all domains of human experience. He does everything humanly possible to help his reader to develop a new mindset, one that appreciates, embraces, and then leverages uncertainty, randomness, probability, disorder, \\"and what to do in a world we don't understand, a world with unseen elements and properties, the random and the complex; that is, decision making under opacity.\\"<br /><br />These are among the passages that caught my eye and were especially interesting as well as informative:<br /><br />o The Antidote to the Black Swan (Pages 6-17)<br />o Proto-Antifragility (36-38)<br />o How to Win a Horse Race (43-48)<br />o Antifragility by Layers (65-71)<br />o In Praise of Procrastination -- The Fabian Kind (121-124)<br />o The Soviet-Harvard Department of Ornithology (193-197)<br />o The Green Lumber Fallacy (207-211)<br />o The Industrial Revolution (226-229)<br />o Fat Tony versus Socrates (251-253)<br />o On the Importance of Attics (263-266)<br />o A Simple Rule to Detect the Fragile (268-271)<br />o Learning to Subtract (313-318)<br />o The Stiglitz Syndrome (388-391)<br />o The Professionals and the Collective (411-414)<br />o The Tyranny of the Collective (421-422)<br /><br />Taleb views this book as the last in a series during which he develops \\"one master idea, each time taken to its next step, [and now] the last step.\\" He allows his reader to accompany him during the completion of an intellectual journey that began with Fooled by Randomness and continued with The Black Swan. In this third volume, he explains how, \\"by grasping the mechanisms of antifragility, we can build a systematic and broad guide to [begin italics] nonpredictive [end italics] decision making under uncertainty,\\" whenever and whatever the given circumstances may be.<br /><br />I urge those who read my review to read and then re-read very carefully the book, of course, but also \\"Appendix: The Triad, or a Map of the World and Things Along the Three Properties.\\" They are FRAGILE, ROBUST, and ANTIFRAGILE.

B001GS1DS8|5.0|I like it when it first came out and I found the unrated version to be just as good with only a minimal change in the movie. This will go down as one of my all time favorites
B005LAJ16I|5.0|We have almost finished watching the 4 DVD's that comprise the 12 shows in the first season of Homeland.  The packet arrived in \\"like new\\" condition, and the series itself is just as terrific as the reviewers have said.  We are totally hooked on it!
B006PHD0RW|5.0|im addicted. cant stop playing this game. always a different combo of items. never know how it will turn out.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|I love this game. It keeps me busy while I'm waiting. Simple. Challenging. Good graphics. I love the little stick guy, he's sooo cute, lol.
B007STBUIW|5.0|This movie will always be great.  Really enjoyed the extras although most of them were released with the VHS special edition years ago.  The audio on this bluray version is phenomenal.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|this is a great app for when you have a power outages when big stroms come in like hurricane sandy which Is going on right now in the us. so I do love this app a lot right now in the us. well I hope you like it. see you all l8r bye
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Fantastic movie with or without 3d but how can u turn down that amazon price?  Great addition to the collection.
B008G8SFGO|4.0|From people that don't know what they're taking about (and I'm referring to people that reviewed Peter Criss's book (but even the band members don't like each other at times).<br /><br />\\"considering their illustrious, 40-plus year history 28 U.S. gold albums, the most gold records for any American rock band, 40 million sales in the U.S., and a total exceeding $100 million worldwide\\".
B008MU8ZNO|5.0|Great flick for a great price to add to my bluray collection.  Really glad they decided to release this on bluray.
B008GOAFBQ|5.0|Which I have grown tired of after awhile because it was the only slow song on the album and even though I do very much like Peter Criss and his work and still believe that he didn't get the credit that he deserved even hough he might disagree because after all he did leave the band and the same goes for Ace Frehley. I recently saw a tribute band called Gods of Thunder that are a tribute to Kiss and they did the song Flaming Youth off of this album and after they sang it the lead singer told the audience that \\"nobody plays Flaming Youth anymore', it's a great song if you really listen to it, I thought that that was so cool that he said that.<br /><br />The other album that I don't think that they got enough credit for was the double set of Kiss (Double) Platinum. But if you disagree then so be it.<br /><br /> Gods of Thunder are a pretty awesome rendition of classic Kiss and you need to go check them out (They are on Facebook) because I think they need to do more touring. The bassist even has a rendition of Gene's Battle Axe buitar which I think is awesome. They made a few mistakes here and there but who cares because it's KISS and I dig the fact that the bassist was wearing a pair of the original 'dragon boots' on stage. I hope to see them again.
B009NQKXYK|3.0|Good but not what I expected... needed more action! Left a lot to be desired... special effects was great... I look forward to the follow-up... the DNA of the human race!
B009GX6AKQ|5.0|Absolutely Love New Girl!! By far, one of the funniest shows on TV!!! The cast truly make this show wonderful!
B00328G4XY|5.0|I was always under the impression that Jimi had two great albums.Are you experienced and Axis bold as love.However, when Electric Ladyland came to my hands and after hearing it,I found out how great it was.Actually as Jimi's fan I knew the album and I also knew other albums an concerts he had in his catalog.But I used to think:Yeah Jimi had great music but his best work was the first two albums.Now I've changed my mind and I can tell that Electric Ladyland completes the TRILOGY.I'm a big fan of the Beatles and I can tell you that this album competes with the \\"White album\\" and with \\"Wheels of Fire\\" of Cream.I'ts a classic.Talking about this edition.I'm very happy with it.Yes! there is a big difference comparing this edition with the 1997 edition.I have the 1997 edtion I think that it was a good edtion but this 2010 cd/dvd surpasses the 1997 one.The sound is better and it has more presence in my stereo.The art work is great and the dvd documentary is also great maybe too short.I think the documentary is excerpts of the tv program \\"Classic albums\\".I'm going to buy me the other albums of this edition.The first two and Valleys of neptune via amazon because they have a great service.If you like Rock and Hendrix.Don't hesitate.This album and this edition is a MUST.
B009KHDT0C|4.0|This is a quirky movie, but it's a good \\"dark\\" comedy.  There is a disproportionate number of funny scenes in the trailers, so the movie may be a little more serious than one may be led to believe from the ads.  Overall, good enough I will buy the Blu-Ray.
B008OTTRXU|5.0|I bought this CD for the kids and they loved it.  I received it in a very timely manner and it was in perfect condition (as I expected).  I actually have bought a second one for myself since this one because the kids took my first one home with them!
B00992CF6W|5.0|it the most addicting game u will ever play. I play it all the time. much better than block story.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Alright, I must confess I was hooked. I blazed through the other two books and looked forward to this finale. I was not dissapointed. Without spoiling the ending, there are enough critics out there, how you respond to the ending will depend upon your personality and how you view happy endings. But, it is well worth the read. Collins uses engaging prose, characters and personalities. I have two dissapointments. First, I hate crying when I read a book. Hey, I'm a tough guy, but there are some lines in this book that just choke ya up! Seccond is that I am done with the trilogy, and am now I have to leave the Mockingjay and begin reading another adventure.
B005RJI67I|5.0|very excited to find this set as we are regulars at our local lego store and have never come across this configuration...easy to assemble (there is a hidden compartment inside) and we love the colorful potions decanters (<fancy, huh???)...
B009WJWMNI|4.0|I currently like Walking Dead, Revolution, Breaking Bad, Spartacus and 24 to give you an idea. If you like those shows you will like this one!<br />Good loocking cast, Action and some mystery regarding an Island. This is good stuff! I prefer the Cable stations movies to network tv then you get nudity more blood and realistic Action but<br />this has all that without the R Rating. Check it out Action fans, there is even Some Batman esque similarities here.
B009CCBCU4|5.0|In this by author Zoe Saadia - \\"The Highlander.\\" We are introduced to the amazing people and the great civilizations in the valleys of Mesoamerica. The story is set around the ancient city of Texcoco, a major Acolhua City-state in the central Mexican plateau region situated on the eastern bank of Lake Texcoco in the Valley of Mexico, to the Northeast of the Aztec capital, Tenochtitlan.<br /><br />The Highlander is an exceptional tale about two young men from differing tribal-nations set in ancient Mexico. The story is a richly-developed, engrossing, and awe inspiring tale of evolving friendship & loyalty, combined with excellent romantic, dramatic, blood-curling, and exciting sub-plots throughout. This magnificent story combines expert in-depth knowledge by the author, with wonderful creative writing that not only makes the book a gripping read, but a fantastic way to learn about some of the richest yet, least know historical civilisations of our times.<br /><br />The two central characters in the story, Coyotl and Kuini first meet when they are young on a hill overlooking the Great Capital of the Acolhua people. The two young men forge their friendship and bond on this peaceful and beautiful hill however; their respective journeys and lives ahead are very different although always somehow closely related. The reader is drawn into their lives and consumed by the fantastic ancient names and equally fantastic supporting characters contained elsewhere in the story.<br /><br />The book has outstanding visual descriptions, allowing a reader of any age to travel through these ancient Mexican times and the lives of these two young men, as if they are sat right next to them, hearing their every word, and following their every adventure and progress in life. The young men share a love and lust for many things however; who seeks love and who lust power remains to be seen. The book entraps the readers in this incredible world and enables a vastly valuable historical culture to be taught in a most creative and inspiring manner.<br /><br />Nothing is predictable in this story, like Coyotl and Kuini, the supporting characters are all affected by the threat of an impending tribal-nation conflict, the outcome and consequences of this looming is hard to predict as the plot is filled with deceit and unpredictable developments. The only constant throughout the story is the two main characters quest to keep their nation-tribes safe from the challenge of the times.<br /><br />There is nothing one dimensional about this book, you will be totally absorbed by superb character names like Nezahualcoyotl, Iztac-Ayotl, or the incredible tribal-nation names like Tepanecs, Aztecs and Chichimecs to mention a few. The story is the perfect blend of creative writing, art and history told in a breathtakingly educational manner in my opinion. I found the book is exciting, emotional and fast-paced with the reader drawn in by the quality of the storyline, which is only surpassed by the quality of the writing. It was an immensely enjoyable read and contains a whole wealth of information about ancient Mexico woven throughout the story, which I loved.<br />This book is powerful, it allows you to travel through the times and you will long remember the names, places and events long after you finish reading it.<br /><br />The author has created a marvellous book and is definitely a rising star! A not to miss read! You won't be disappointed!be taught in a most creative and inspiring manner.<br /><br />Nothing is predictable in this story, like Coyotl and Kuini, the supporting characters are all affected by the threat of an impending tribal-nation conflict, the outcome and consequences of this looming is hard to predict as the plot is filled with deceit and unpredictable developments.

B007TBZ63Y|4.0|Fast paced and entertaining, an enjoyable addition to a fun book series.  The only thing I didn't particularly like was that Percy Jackson, as a character, was rather one dimensional in this entry in the series compared to the others.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is easy for all ages.  No reading so it can be played in the car without causing eye strain.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is great but it needs buckets. redstone. water. lava. and spawn eggs. be careful though&hellip; it may erase everything you had built for some reason. I ended up losing 8 diamonds and a week's worth of survival work and tunneling. but I still love it! :-D
B0083SBMBM|4.0|A lot of action and some comedic overtones<br />It is a deffinit must buy for any comic book fan in your life this holiday season

0399157565|2.0|I've been a Patricia Cornwell fan for a long time, but this book was a huge disappointment.  Granted, she jumped the shark long ago but this book was shark jumping in outer space.  At best, it is disjointed, at worst it is out and out non-sensical.  Seems like no one edits Ms Cornwell any more -- did she not learn from her English professors that you don't shift topic in mid-sentence? I kept having to go back and re-read portions to figure out what the mid-sentence shift was about. The \\"case solution\\" was too quick (while the lead up was way too long) and seemed to be more about food than about why the murderer did what he did.  Ms. Cornwell clearly needed to eat a pizza while writing because Scarpetta is obsessed with it through the entire book. This book could easily have been 250 pages shorter and conveyed the exact same information in a less disjointed and more entertaining fashion.  Time for a break Ms. Cornwell -- losing focus again.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|Finally, a great prequel to Alien.  The only thing that could have made this better would have been to somehow write the iconic Ripley into the script.  Hopefully they will make a sequel.
B0027HOBM2|5.0|Am in love with Mad Men and have enjoyed every episode.  Especially enjoyed commentary with every episode.  Remembering the Cuban Missile crisis and how very close we came to nuclear war
B009NQKXYK|2.0|A little more introduction of how the 'Aliens' really began.  Needed to explain why the 1st kept these 'things' in containers and where did they come from.  I enjoyed all the alien movies and this would go with the rest of my collections.

0071373586|3.0|I read this after 22 immutable laws of marketing. I would suggest getting that book over this one. A lot of the same ideas are presented, but I think 22 immutable laws is a much more mature and easier read book.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0887306667 The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing:  Violate Them at Your Own Risk!]]

B005K01VZS|5.0|This book was one I could not put down! There are a lot of profound statements that made me have \\"A-HA\\" moments.  Such a great read I have started going back thru it to refresh my memory so that I can share it with my family and friends.
B004A8ZWW4|2.0|When I first saw the movie I loved it.  So that is why I ordered it and I can't stand watching a bad copy of a movie.  It was kind of blurry and I did not enjoy watching.  Will never order a used movie again.<br />\\"You get what you pay for\\"!!!!
B0002YLC24|5.0|Prior to writing this review I read the one star reviews which included complaints about a lack of action, liberal viewpoints of the characters, and the immorality of the characters.  If those are the three most important qualities that you would look for in a movie then you would not like this movie.  You might like Independence Day instead.  This movie is just a camera filming two people strolling along and talking to each other, so there is not any \\"action.\\"  While you might not like the viewpoints of the characters, the movie is not trying to communicate a political message; it is a romantic movie.  The dialogue is not meant to incite, rather, it is meant to capture how two people might talk to each other in real life.  In real life, liberal people say liberal things just as conservatives say conservative things.  As for the complaints about the morality of the characters, I assume the reviewer is using his or her imagination to fill in the blanks a little bit.  Judging the morality of the characters seems like an odd way to judge the quality of a movie so I really cannot respond to that line of criticism.<br /><br />What makes this movie good is the acting, the story, the dialogue, and the scenery. The plot is original as far as I know.  It is not like a romantic comedy type plot.  I am not a romance genre fan, yet I really enjoyed this movie and its prequel.  It is a very fitting sequel to Before Sunrise and it captures an intimate moment in two people's lives.  I think the nature of the dialogue and the progression of its intimacy seems natural which makes it believable to me.  It is about lost opportunity and heartache.  It is about two people reconnecting.  It is about the characters holding back from what they really want to say because of their uncertainty about how the other feels.  The characters are imperfect, the situation is not ideal, and the ending is not conclusive.  These are what makes the movie great.  Stories must have conflict to make them interesting and I think most people have experienced conflict in life, particularly in relationships.  Perhaps those who have experienced heartache or who question what might have happened if some part of their lives went differently might relate to the characters in this film more than those whose lives have gone as planned.<br /><br />If you liked Before Sunrise you should like this movie.  I actually like this movie slightly better than Before Sunrise and I saw this movie before Before Sunrise and now I own both.  If you are looking for politically neutral or conservative characters, who do not face moral dilemmas, who are involved in a lot of action then this is not the movie for you.
B007KOYEOC|5.0|Great read. The end result of Grey's journey to become a \\"normal\\" person. He certainly had some hang ups. All seems strange to me but I could understand where he was to start with and where he ended up.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|the notebook is definitely a chick flick - one of the most heart warming movies/books I have come across.  It is right up there with \\"message in a bottle\\"
B007KZY1YY|5.0|A great read. I was at first I was quite shocked at the content but then realised the story is a journey that Grey is taking back to the normal so to speak. I found the changes in Grey facinating.
B004WR125O|1.0|Unit did not pick up the wireless signal from a Cisco Linksys E2000 router from less than 20' away.  Within 15' signal was less than 24%.  The unit's effective range is so short that it's effectively useless.
0393312836|5.0|This is a fantastic novel and a must read for anyone interested in psychology, philosophy, social issues, and the powers of government. Both humorous and poignant, Anthony Burgess has created a modern-day masterpiece that strikes at the very core of civilized society and asks important questions about the nature of humanity.
0307346617|2.0|The one shot characters and stories were very boring for me.  No back story for the vast majority, no real character development, not much of anything.<br /><br />If you are big into zombie fiction,read it, you probably won't be disappointed but I'm sure you won't be wowed. If not, save yourself some time and money and just pick a different book.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I don't know what the price is now, but when I bought this product it was 20 dollars, and what a bargain! It is excellent, the movie itself is a masterpiece and the four disc set is so great because my mother has a 3D tv that I can watch the 3D blu-ray on (though otherwise that particular disc just sits in the package).<br /><br />Speaking of the package it is a really cool one, with a holographic cover that my bf will stare at for hours (he is easily amused) and it came crisp and clean.<br /><br />Lastly, the soundtrack downloaded perfectly and though I  don't listen to it often, it was a nice addition, and for only 20 dollars! It was great, I really recommend this if the price is still so low.
B009GEOLM4|1.0|I didn't know the movie was a cartoon. I was ready to watch the latest Batman movie and got a cartoon. I didn't watch the movie.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|An excellent film.  The characters were well developed and the story line was great.  I will watch this movie again.
B0091REZMW|3.0|its an ok game if u intend to play for a little bit but gets boring and ends up costing u some if u want to play for a while
B009HV2JT8|4.0|I was leery at first about this movie after reading the negative reviews, but they seem to mostly be critiques of comparison to the book. I did not read the book, so I had nothing to compare it to in that respect. I'm a vampire movie fan (as long as it's well made). I thought the characters were interesting and the movie moved at a good pace. It's a vampire action flick, with a fictional Abe Lincoln as the hero and to expect the movie to be solely about historical timelines and Abe Lincolns's life is too much to expect. Maybe if I'd read the book, I might be more critical....who knows. For now, I'm enjoying the movie as it is.
B000AQJPQE|2.0|This thing is pretty unimpressive. It blazes through batteries, it's flimsy and and dimly lit--even at full charge. (Oh yeah, it takes 3 C-batteries. Just what I wanted, an odd number of the least prevalent cell at any store.) Wish I had researched this better. Oh yeah, Saturn touches Jupiter on every orbit, noticeably slowing the whole thing down. Meh.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|this a different take on a Reacher novel.  In this book, the reader learns about how Reacher thinks, reasons, and acts as he figures out what is going on in his current circumstances.  Absolutely intriguing, and a must read for any die-hard Jack Reacher fan like myself.  If you are new to this series, I would suggest that you read any of the other novels before reading this, so that this novel means more.
B008U7ZPHS|4.0|I've been a keen follower of Rick Riordans writings & coupled with my interest for mythology & fantasy it makes good & absorbing reading
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|It was awesome. I loved the interaction of the heros. Our favorite is the hulk. They were all great though.
B007THA4FI|3.0|\\"Casual Vacancy\\" seems to have some structural problems that get in the way of my enjoying the book.  I think the book should begin with Barry Fairbrother's funeral, which would introduce the pretty extensive character list, followed by the various set pieces and character sketches leading up to the funeral.  The book could then move through Barry's post-funeral influence and its redemptive qualities and humane vision (as well as its occasional feebleness against stubbornness, stupidity and ignorance) and then end, as it does, with the other funeral (I'm trying not to spoil the ending here), with narrative symmetries of good changing into evil and evil changing into good--and life going on.<br /><br />The chief problem I felt while reading was keeping the various characters and their relationships straight, and by the time I got that on track, I'd forgotten who had done what to whom.  I felt the book needed a few more drafts before being let out into the world.
B006ZPJWBM|5.0|At 85, Tony Bennett reminds fans why he is a living jazz legend.  The golden-voice octogenarian powerfully displays his versatility as he performs musical duets with 16 superstars from a wide range of musical genres.  From Andre Bocelli to Lady Gaga,  from Willie Nelson to Aretha Franklin, Bennett brilliant blends his signature jazz stylings with the diverse styles of his popular partners.<br /><br />Even after 90 minutes, this album left me wanting for more.
B001LF347E|5.0|this show gives everyone access to  the legend of Camelot. It's just fun watching and always leaves the viewer with hope for a better world.
B009NCM248|2.0|This album is just OK. It definitely falls flat compared to Come What(ever) May. It feels like a rehash for the more part. If the songs come on, i dont change them, theyre all pretty decent, just I wouldnt op to put this album on over their earlier stuff.
B000HWZ4A2|2.0|The Fountainhead with Gary Cooper and Patricia Neal is a great story. The black and white DVD that I received was poorly cropped (actually cutting off the top of the characters heads at some times), but it stuck to the story and was worth the price I paid for it.
B002WTC92E|3.0|I've haven't finished reading it yet but so far so good!Its a little different than the type of books I like but it is still good.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This is the most addicting, the most entertaining and overall the best game I have ever played... There are only two faults, the fact you can't go back and redo levels, and the fact that you can't duck. It is by far the most interesting game I've ever played.
B003LWN8F8|5.0|I find nothing interesting in \\"Electra Heart\\" but in this album, there's hardly a song that I don't love (ok, a couple at most) - and same goes for my 7-year-old son, for what it's worth (I've imparted to him a lot of my taste in music).<br />The voice is particularly interesting, with a large range and sudden pitch changes slightly reminiscent of Shakira (although I vastly prefer Marina's musical style), and the lyrics are interesting too...<br />Too bad the title song (\\"Family Jewels\\") is not actually part of this version (MP3) of the album!
B0086700CM|4.0|I like temple run but I think it takes to long to slow you to jump and slide. It's very addicting but it's just not as touch sensitive as it should be.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love it; Ty for the updates! i love it when i can go to my notes and find a key word and go right to it. instead of many note papers all around. lol. Be Blessed!
B005V20JKI|2.0|It's great fun, but user beware: If you install any of the updates, the ones that state that your \\"user data will be saved\\" - it WIPES all your user data, and any level you have reached is gone. You have to start back at ground zero... After doing this once, I was done with the game, when it did it again (I thought maybe the first time was a glitch...should have known better!).<br />Too bad, because it is really fun, very involved upgrades to the characters you get to play, and you can pick which one to upgrade and the upgrade purchases are free (no pesky do you want to buy more stuff?).

174179403X|5.0|We have just returned from a month-long trip through the three countries of the Caucasus and found, sadly, that they (to paraphrase the old Kingston Trio song) don't like each other very much.  While Georgia is on good terms with both neighboring Armenia and Azerbaijan, the latter two seem to be on a collision course... reinterpreting history to suit their own current political ends.  If you visit Armenia first and travel to occupied Karabagh, forget getting into Azerbaijan.  You will even be hassled at the airports of both capitals if your passport contains a visa from the other country.<br /><br />This whole bit of nastiness between the two even extends to guidebooks a traveler might be carrying upon entering one or the other.  If authorities notice in Baku that you have an \\"Armenia Guidebook\\" they will confiscate it... and visa versa in Yerevan if you have an \\"Azerbaijan Guidebook.\\"  This, therefore, makes the Lonely Planet Guide that covers all three countries a good choice for a guidebook to be carrying through the region...if for a sad reason.  While other guidebook might provide more detail on history and places to see, as usual, this Lonely Planet Guide manages to do a good job covering things in all three countries in one slim volume.  Well done, again, Lonely Planet!
B008IYR2BA|4.0|I thought season 6 of Dexter was good but it did not have those hold your breath moments like in previous seasons.
B006GHA9QQ|2.0|I write plainly, not fancy theater talk. :)<br /><br />Why hasn't anyone brought up that ALW is now recycling music? It is probably inevitable after such a long career that some melodies are reused/reminiscent of others, but to recycle an entire melody for the title song is beyond disappointing. Check out \\"Our kind of love\\" and \\"Love never dies\\". Some bits of the songs (can't remember track title right now, think it was Meg singing) remind me strongly of the woman in white.<br /><br />Like all ALW productions this one is still better with better tracks than many others. However it is not a 5 star production by any stretch of the imagination.<br /><br />The Phantom in this Australian production is all hardness, Christine has a soaring voice and looks like a porcelain doll. She also acts like an expressionless doll. I would have liked to see Remin and Sierra playing their parts because they may be the best Phantom/Christine ever. I'm sorry but the Australian ones just lack chemistry (in addition to acting, ugh).<br /><br />Madam Giry was like Snow White's stepmother, and Meg was all nice and then suddenly turned nasty. Raoul became a loser, and \\"It's beautiful\\" is plain horrible without the haunting sounds of \\"Past the point of no return\\". If it's not a nice melody, just stop using it. I would rather ALW recycled some other nice melodies instead of using this.<br /><br />I think the little boy Gustov could be the best performer of the Aussie production.<br /><br />This production needs a lot of work and new soundtracks before it can make it to broadway...and please, Sierra and Remin!<br /><br />--------------<br />This musical just does not flow. Could be the story, a large part of it is the music, and the stars were not able to bring truth and vulnerability to their characters (probably they couldn't because the story is stupid).
B006SMLAMQ|1.0|This app is horrible.  Once u download it stops working and it wont open. Dont waste ur money on it.
B0018OIK0E|5.0|Shaun of the Dead is EASILY one of my top five favorite comedies.  If you like Simon Pegg, British humor, Spaced (Simon's previous tv series), and the associated ensemble of actors, you'll love Shaun of the Dead.  The director has a unique plot style, camera cut-away usage, and other distinct aspects that were perfected during the filming of the tv series Spaced. MUST WATCH!
B0037NB6QE|5.0|Wonderful book. I loved how it was written cleaver twist to the ending. All The Shop on Blossom Street are excellent.
B000VK99Z6|4.0|Though not as original as Shaun of the Dead (the first film to include this ensemble of actors), Hot Fuzz is still a great film with Simon Pegg at the helm.  The plot is not as unique as Shaun of the Dead either, but as a genre film, it is great fun.  This is also the second film in Simon Pegg's trilogy, so it's a must watch!
B0086700CM|4.0|This game keeps me up at night! Even when it got boring and I stopped playing it....the second I started playing it again I was hooked! :)
B009NQKPUW|4.0|This is a great sci-fi/action film.  It doesn't necessarily have the suspense or scare factor from the other Alien films, but it is well worth the watch.  I watched it twice in  a week!
B0083GQKQG|5.0|Sad story of a family in crisis; mom remains decided to her son, following a horrific incident that not only impacted her life, but countless others.
0307352145|3.0|I'm only about half way through and would probably have been thinking along the lines of 4 or 5 star review, UNTIL she started on the subject that every one's an expert on - global warming (sorry climate change). Why does everyone feel compelled to offer their opinion on this ridiculous topic in a book that's got nothing to do with it?  Al Gore's an introvert? Gimme a break.  Opinions on this (fashionable) topic provide an instant guide to writers' (politically-influenced) willingness to think for themselves - if not to their overall IQ.
B0096HIEE2|4.0|Big fan of Channing Tatum and Alex Pettyfer and as usual they didn't disappoint.  The choreography was good, and Matt McConaughey held his own.  Keep up the good work Steve Soderbergh!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Can hardly wait for the third book. The series is fantastic, the characters are so real they live in your head literally!!!
1936891026|5.0|This book is a must-read for anyone with creative ambitions, be they in art, music, writing, ... whatever.  The author articulates questions that I struggled to form in my head and offers answers that make a lot of sense.  I learned a lot about myself by reading this book.
B004FGMDOQ|3.0|Really enjoyed but not sure about the ending! But it definitely<br /> was peculiar and enjoyable.<br />Good quick worthy read try!!
B0098VYCCE|3.0|While Stewart is a fine actress, I think someone else would have been better for the part. Charlize Theron was fantastic as was the Huntsman. Couple of moments where it felt like too many different myths or fairy tales were in one script.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This book can help you nurture your love relationship long after the inital \\"in love,\\" feeling has faded.  Understand how you percieve love and what you need to hear/experience to feel love will help you communicate love effectivly with your spouse, partner, childeren.
B004EPYZXK|2.0|The movie is technically very well done, but its premise is lacking.  Aliens that mimic Moon rocks?  Which live in space but can function just fine in an atmosphere, and which happen to be able to eat humans?  What do they normally live on and how is it they can digest us, when they aren't native to our planet?  Also the military sent astronauts there but then refused to let them return with the organisms they were presumably sent to bring back in the first place?  The f*ck?  (Maybe they were trying to avoid getting too close to the premise in &#34;Aliens&#34;.)  Also, the idea of these space beasties attacking astronauts on the Moon was reminiscent of the movie Red Planet, almost like that was a(nother?) borrowed idea.  That said, the producers obviously did their homework.  The moonwalks etc. look very realistic (though the guys do seem to be walking in Earth gravity from time to time).  The Soviet lander was right, which is very impressive--that's pretty obscure, and the Soviet lander was indeed a one-man craft called the LK.  The fact that the astronauts identified it as an &#34;LK-Proton&#34; is curious (since the Proton is a rocket, not a spacecraft), but a 1970s astronaut probably wouldn't have all the terminology right since the Soviet lunar program was top secret, and he did well to get it right at all.  A Soviet lunar landing, had one actually happened, would likely have been lifted on Proton rockets since the N1 Moon rocket was a failure and the Soviets' unmanned lunar flyby tests were lifted on Protons.  I would really like to give this 2.5 stars, because it's so well-done technically; too bad half stars aren't available.  But given a choice of a 2 or a 3, I come down on a 2 because the plot is so far-fetched.
B003KIMOIK|4.0|Entertaining as all get-out.  Cinematic license in the fights and shoot-out scenes, of course, but still entertaining.  Wisecracking was a plus.<br /><br />Kurt
B009KUANWG|5.0|Very good! Love the jazz theme. A lot better than most of the previous Bond theme songs, and a good song on its own as well.
B007UPNA6Y|4.0|I almost didn't bother buying this because the reviews weren't great but glad I did. Enjoyed reading it. Not quite as action filled as other Reacher novels but still entertaining.
B000QCQ8Y4|4.0|This is one of the better stories in the series showing Jack Reacher's leadership style<br />and loyalty in working with others.
074356619X|4.0|I was introduced to the Secrets by a friend.  Listening to this CD has turned my life around.  I have learned so much and have turned around from my old life style and now learning to live day by day positively. I am glad to have found the Secret.
B00632HWOG|4.0|It is a pretty good e-mail system. Not great. Just OK. It has hung up a few times on my mobile but nothing major.
B004026NP0|5.0|Loved it, arrived on time<br />Size is a but largar than other size 10 crocs but my daughters feer will grow on it
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This is an excellent book!  I read every book in the series.  I cannot wait for the next one :)
B009NQKPUW|1.0|This movie was horrible. It did not answer any question and if it did it was late in the movie. Unbelievable that the Alien creature did not show up until the end and even then it did nothing. I hope that there is no second movie to this mess of a movie.
B008HK3XOU|4.0|I thought it would be similar to the one I had for my first generation Kindle, but it wasn't.  Still good for protection from small falls and keeping it from getting scratch in my purse
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I have been following The Piano Guys on YouTube and love their music.  I really enjoy listening to this CD in my car.  It helps me relax on the way home after a stressful day.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|If you enjoy this type of carnival or arcade game then play this game! It is a ton of fun and addictive.
B0091REZMW|4.0|cool game nice for passing time and dealing wit boredom different from many other hidden object games... very interesting and keeps yours attention in many ways...
0385737955|5.0|The Maze Runner is a very adventurous and unique novel. For a young adult novel, it is for sure a page turner and a must read! The crazy and very well thought out twists and turns throughout the book always have you thinking! James Dashner's way of writing has you hooked from the very beginning, and you just can't read it fast enough! He really connects you to the characters where it feels as if you are living their lives, their storys and adventures with them! This has turned out to be on my top 5 books of all time that I have ever read. James Dashner wrote two additional books in this series as well as a prequel. All of the books in the series were really amazing and I would hope that you all can read this book and the rest in the series.  I really loved this book and would recommend it to basically anyone, and I am sure all of you will really enjoy this perfect literary masterpiece.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|From the first line this nook was exactly what I was looking for. It was recommended by our marriage counselor & has made such a difference in how we view and understand love as it evolves through our lives together
B002ZG9846|5.0|this was a awesome awesome movie.. WE Loved it!!!.. why does this have to be 20words.. I just want to say.. I LOVED this movie.. that is all.... i really liked the movie..<br /><br />not for children
B0054JZC6E|5.0|awesome awesome this thing/game rocks so so so so so so so so so do so so do so so much
0345803507|5.0|It's a great book and great trilogy. I love the story line and you keep wanting more. I think she has great detail and good on grabbing the attention of the reader.
B00914JWSW|5.0|All I can say is that after listening to this CD, I want more -- more vintage Barbra. Please tell me there are more hidden gems like these from Barbra Streisand, the all-time greatest female recording artist.
B001EC3JME|5.0|I had a hard time finding a holster for my mag 50 flashlight.The nite ize holster works perfectly.I use every night at work and it has held up well.Product arrived on time in original package.I have recommended to co workers and friends.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|temple run and subway suffers are the exact same but since temple run was here first subway sufers must have been a copy.Its so the same chased by something  upgrades and coins.when I found out I imedietly deleted it.<br /><br />  DONT BUY ITS A RIP OFF<br />!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0345803507|1.0|I cannot believe that these books are as popular as they are.  Definitely would have been better if the author stopped after the first book.  The sex scenes seemd to suggest that the author has never had sex, or at best has had sex in one position.  The plot is endlessly repetitive - Ana does something, Christian gets mad, they have a fight, then they have sex.  During the sex, all he has to do is talk for her to have an orgasm...
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love the fact that I can keep all the things I see in one place to go back too and try and that friends  can share theirs too and we can all get different ideas off of each other
B009KHBDUU|4.0|Is this the best vampire movie of all time? No. Is it worth a watch? Yes! It definitely passed our 20 minute rule, and had me laughing out loud (seriously laughing out loud) several times.  I would highly recommend it, especially at this time of year. It's the perfect blend of comedy and thriller.
B0087HT36U|4.0|Great game. Takes some thought to figure out the correct angles to take out and at the same time save the.angels.  A lot of fun!
B007C4ZJ3K|4.0|Good movie. The action sequences are very realistic. Good script. My wife even enjoyed this one and she usually doesn't like action type movies. We hope to see Gina Carano in more movies.
B002LC8HF0|4.0|Well, I've been a long time fantasy fan and reader, and I have grown weary of the standard good vs evil, good guy wins in convincing fashion stuff. Then there's George RR Martin on the other end of the fantasy spectrum who likes to kill off ALL of the good guys. Eventually, I found Mr. Sanderson. What I really enjoy abut Mr. Sanderson's style, is that he keeps all the clues hidden away as to who the actual heroes are until quite literally the end. With the Mistborn books, I really was intrigued how he developed the characters throughout all 3 books, each coming into his or her own identity with both strengths and weaknesses, and in a convincingly believable fashion to boot.<br /><br />I wasn't sure about Brandon as an author, and I'm sort of an author-picky geek... There are certain authors whom I will read almost anything they publish and certain authors that don't even pique my interest. Well, I was that way about Robert Jordan, and got sucked into the Wheel of Time saga, nearly losing my sanity in the process. However, after Mr. Jordan died, and Brandon took over, I decided to give the series another try. That's how I discovered that Mr. Sanderson could REALLY write: He made more progress with the story and characters in one novel than Jordan did with the last 3 or 4 in that series! SO, I decided to read some other stuff by Mr. Sanderson, and at the suggestion of a friend, I went with the Mistborn and I certainly wasn't disappointed.<br /><br />I would wholeheartedly recommend this book and series to any fan looking for easy and entertaining reads that really capture the reader's attention and imagination.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Challenging and easy at the same time.don't bother purchasing the extra levels, they take your money and never give them to you. After you email them, they refund it.. No explanations. But the free version is good!
B008MEM24S|5.0|This game is addicting and is sometimes very challenging at times. This is a good use of your money. Good game.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|TWD season 3 kicked off at a rockets pace, picking up after the winter had passed and all our heroes are reintroduced. Production values are improved from last season, the scripts aren't so laden with unnecessary exposition/ explanation, the actors are getting more comfortable with their rolls and the characters themselves are far from stagnant, stereotypical scream and run away from the monsters types. Season 3 holds a lot of promise for things to come.<br /><br />I primarily watch the show streamed from amazon, (no cable tv in my home) the streamed delivery has been flawless, no buffering, no pixilization or freezing during playback. I couldn't be happier.
B000K3M1VI|5.0|We have just returned from a trip to Krakow and of course went to Auschwitz and Berkenau. The German people were inhuman and they ALL knew what was happening. I have no sympathy for any of their cries of, \\"we could not stop it!\\" Watch this movie and decide for yourself if they could have done something to help the innocent children and the pregnant women.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is so good but the stone brick is not in the the creative inventory but it is still a very cool and awsome game.
B002PEP4U0|4.0|A very compelling and heart warming story. Leaves you in awe of William's creativity and tenacity. The only thing that kept me from giving 5 stars is that it starts out a bit slow.
B009OA57MI|4.0|this is an entertaining king app not hard wish you could get one kore air plane gets boring with just one the f18 game is fun too wish you could get one more airplane also.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it's fun for both kids and adults. it has games the whole family can enjoy.  no app has as much fun and thrill az this one.
B0000C0FJB|4.0|Poor sound quality? The reviewers who said that were casting blame in an incorrect direction.  I am sure the recording studio folks did the best they could with this material.  The problem here is just a rude and obnoxious crowd.  That simple.  A Rush concert, in my opinion, is an intellectual and cultural event.  It is not Carnivale or a soccer match!  This crowd is far far too noisy.  Due to their ridiculously high volume, they show extreme disrespect to the band, to its virtuouso playing and singing, and most of all, to its extremely cerebral and noble lyrics.  True, this raucousness was acceptable and even fun on that lightest of all lightweight Rush anthems, \\"Tom Sawyer\\". However, for the crowd continuing to act like kids in a middle school cafeteria at lunch on the powerful \\"Distant Early Warning\\" was shameful.  Yeah, the crowd almost makes this a worthless live album.<br />\\"Almost\\", however, is the operative words.  With the exception of a weak riff here and there, every song is a gem.  As a result, I urge all Rush fans to buy this one and be patient with the ill-behaved boors who screaming insanely from their seats.
0316228532|4.0|Once you get to the second half of the book, and put all the characters in place it is an enjoyabe read. Looking forward to her next book.
159420411X|1.0|I was hoping to gain some insights into forecasting and perhaps information from this book, but I learned nothing. The content is pedestrian. It is filled with distracting irrelevancies. Do you really care that a forecaster \\"is seventy-four years old has a healthy goatee and looks fifteen years younger?\\" I don't. The substantive content of this book plays second fiddle to its biographic and journalistic aspirations. In short this is a long book that is short on insights.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|Everything is fine. I won't overclock it yet.<br />You must pair this with a nice video card. (Series 500+)<br />My games are working at full speed and high settings.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Great special effects, held my attention till the end, story was well written. Love Robert Downey Jr. The second Thor movie still interests me.
B009NPKTN6|4.0|I really liked that all the stars did their own singing. Some part were funny too. I also liked that the main characters were new to movies.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|Excellent group with a fun sound to listen to.  Some of the songs have been stuck in my head for days because they are so catchy.
B009UX2YAC|2.0|this game is a remake of temple run i had one of the highest score and the next day everything was gone i will not redo the hole game to get my high score back
B008673ZAQ|5.0|If you are a true lover of Romantic stories, you'll love this series. It is full of love, hate, and surprise. I couldn't put these books down- even when I definitely should have been sleeping!
B003Y5H5FQ|2.0|Overall I was disappointed in the movie.  I read good reviews on the movie, and mainly on the 3D...the 3D was basically non existent, minus a few scenes which were actually really good but they only lasted 2-3 seconds.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />- dark scenes looked terrible (not a tv issue either)<br />- acting was not great - especially in the beginning<br />- sound was not good<br />- 3D was awful - a few scenes were good, but only lasted a few seconds.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- story was good (should be for a remake!)<br /><br />If I would have went into it with lower expectations, I think I would have enjoyed it more.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I bought this book at 10 a.m and finished 12 hours later. This book is absolutely impossible to put down. A must read for anyone who loves to laugh. And for those who don't like to laugh ,  you will after reading this.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I was very anxious to read the follow up to Bared to You and was swept away from the very beginning.  Very quick read, over way too soon!  Can't wait for the next book due in December!
B009NQKPUW|5.0|Great movie, would not get tired of watching this movie, 3D version is just amazing, special features shows the great quality of this movie, Ridley Scott is a master!!
B009NQKXYK|3.0|Very good movie, I liked the visuals and the action but the story line took a long time to build up,
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Of Course! This DVD was everything I expected it to be. The movie was fantastic! I would definitely recommend this DVD to anyone who is a Marvel Comics fan!
0547564651|3.0|Not as well written as I would have liked.  Good info but a difficult read unless you are an academic type.<br /><br />I purchased one for a friend and it was damaged.  Never had this issue w/ Amazon.<br /><br />Noticed it is difficult or impossible to contact Amazon by phone...not good.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book had me at hello. I was totally hooked and engaged by the characters. It is as good as they say!
B000FCKGPC|1.0|Mr. Martin has no regard for his fan base does he expect readers to sleep through 800 pages of boring, uneventful, characters just so we'll buy then next book? Well not so Mr. Martin, I've completed the trilogy in my mind already and created the resolution for the characters on my own. I don't need you any more but thanks for the beginnings of a good story.
B0086213XW|1.0|just when you think it can't get worse it does....WTF  where and the hell did those sex scenes towards the end come from ....I can't believe I watched the whole thing.
B0098VXBIA|1.0|I had trouble viewing the movie at first and should have just gotten my money back when I called for help. I didn't even finish watching the movie. Too many storylines and was very juvenile. Just a plain terrible movie.
B004YM6JK0|5.0|Its not quite season five caliber, but season 7 is still good. Better than the other shows left on CW. I watched while it aired & watched it immediately when I got it in the mail. I'm still loving this show.
B006TVQTHW|5.0|Pros:<br />Top notch cable management<br />Excellent built in fans with room for extra fans on both sides of the case<br />USB 3.0 front plate<br />Water-cooler grommets. I won't be using them, but they're there.<br />Great size for modern, large GPUs<br />Cheap Price<br />Isn't covered with gaudy blue-LEDs and designs<br /><br />Cons:<br />Inside isn't painted. Doesn't both me much but it's a cut corner<br />No intake fans installed, everything is a blower<br /><br />Overall this case is amazing, especially for under 60 bucks.
B008FTAAG2|1.0|this whole album really sucks. I mean i can't listen to the whole songs with out them just not be apeasing with the lyrics they have. Sorry but Blood is not the best album they have nor do i ever want to buy any of their albums if i can help it.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|So poorly written- I just cannot understand the popularity of this book.  Maybe because of the hype?  Would not recommend.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|This book provides graphic details about Jaycee Dugard's kidnapping and captivity. It was difficult to read and I often felt sick at my stomach as I read about the sexual abuse that this little girl experienced at the hands of Phillip Garrido. It was equally upsetting to learn that the kidnapper's wife, Nancy Garrido, supported her perverted husband and failed to do anything to stop this horrific situation. It was also disturbing to know that Phillip Garrido was a registered sex offender and reported to parole officers during all the years that he held Jaycee in his back yard.<br /><br />I applaud Ms. Dugard for having the courage to relive these years and share her story in writing. I hope and pray that her testimony will make people more aware of what is going on in their own neighborhoods. I also hope that people will have a better understanding of what a mentally ill sex offender is capable of.<br /><br />This book is not for the faint hearted. This book presents evidence that EVIL exists in the world and we must be prepared to protect ourselves and our children.<br /><br />Read this book and have an honest talk with your children. We can't afford to believe that something like this only happens to other people in other places.
B004CLYKLI|5.0|This book is an easy read.  I found myself completely re-examining my parenting  philosophy.  It's extreme- I think the author would be the first to agree- but then again I think our American approach can fall on the other end of the spectrum.  Highly recommend.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I thought it was a good ending for a coming of age book for teens. Something I can relate to with my grandkids.
B008AITJ24|5.0|Another great season! I really enjoyed How the characters have grown and changed in this season.  I'm excited to find out what happens in following season.  I wait to watch so I can see them in a row!
B000003N7R|5.0|This cd has two jazz masters in respectful synch with each other.  A very interesting and rewarding combination of musical talents.
1402545355|5.0|All of Mr. McCall Smith's books that I have listened to work well in the audio format.  Actually, they are BETTER this way than reading the books. I understand that is a strong statement. And having listened to many of them, I can attest to this. Here is why:<br /><br />Narrator--Lisette Lescat is nothing less than superb. In an unabridged format, you get every word the author wrote, delivered in a melodious voice that conveys many shades of meaning that the words have.<br /><br />Format: listening really helps you get the dialogue down better. And dialogue is one of the key strengths of these books.  Storytelling verbally is the oldest form of communication. These books will make you smile, laugh, and think, as you listen.<br /><br />I was lucky enough to hear the author at a recent book signing. He told us that he does have input into  who reads the books for audio, and with one exception, has enjoyed the books very much when spoken.
B008FSCNTK|3.0|This CD has a retro feel to the song selections.  Diana Krall sounds like a singer from a by-gone era, as well.  This is not my favorite Diana CD, but it is interesting.
B000000ITM|5.0|SUPERB RECORDING, MUCH CLEAR THAN THE REGULAR CD . IF YOU CAN GET A HOLD OF A COPY, DO IT AND PLAY IT LOUD.
1451696191|5.0|I listened to this as an audiobook on a 8hr road trip. It is one of my favorite books. You fall in love with the characters and just want the book to never end. On that note, I still loved the ending.<br />I saw the movie a few days after finishing the books and it was very well done.<br />All in all, READ THIS BOOK!
B004F1F32A|5.0|We had watched this movie before, but wanted to view again before going to the sequel at the theatre. Very high quality HD movie and easy transaction to view.
014241493X|3.0|I listened to this book on as an audiobook on a long road trip. It kept my interest, but I never got into the characters. I didn't really understand what the big deal about Margo was, so I couldn't get that into it.<br />It wasn't a bad read, but I didn't get anything out of it. It left nothing to resonate with, so it was kid of useless.
006112429X|3.0|I thought that the first 40% of the book was the worst written book that I have recently read. It was slow to develop and quite pompous. I put it down for months, only to give it another try yesterday. The remaining 60% was a work of art, masterfully written and exciting.  My advice, skim through the first 100 pages or so.
B007MAETA8|4.0|Great new album.  John's sound is maturing. I'm so glad he didn't sell out to the pure pop genre.  This album is reflective, some songs are mellow and relaxing, and some downright moving.  Just as important, the tunes and melodies are good solid music.  I like side 2 better.  It reminds me of a modern day side 2 of Abbey Road, where one song flows perfectly into the next.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|The only thing i enjoyed about the movie was the set production and special effects, visually it was appealing. Considering Mr Scott's rep, this was well beneath his previous work. The story is weak, the characters are unrealisticly idiotic, and the choice to make this a prequel was absurd since its ability for special effects was far superior to the other movies and so therefore makes the technology in the others appear primitive. Recommend waiting for free streaming on Netflix if your morbid curiosity cannot be quelled.
B0096HIEE2|3.0|It was, okay. Tatum Channing was very easy to look at! It seem liked they were on a budget to make this movie.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book is worth reading, as it credibly challenges fundamental assumptions of current \\"scientific\\" thinking. It's not the first to talk about NDE nor is it a comprehensive review/analysis of NDE studies. It doesn't claim to be either of those. It is a personal account of one credible individual who is putting his reputation and career at stake in publishing this book. Hats off to Dr. Alexander for taking this courageous step.<br /><br />Change often begins at the fringes and is hotly debated and viciously fought as it nears the centre. This book brings NDE experiences one step closer to the established science, with credibility. Therefore it threatens a huge bunch of scientists and doctors who have committed their lives to studying and applying the current model of science in this field. So they are bound to revolt. And get a LOT of airtime:-)<br /><br />This book also threatens the entire army of skeptics supporting Dr. Richard Dawkins who are up in alms against \\"religions that divide the world\\". Even one single credible case of \\"consciousness without brain/body\\" could prove to be the proverbial black swan that invalidates the entire hypothesis of Dr Dawkins and company. Since he has a LOT of learned scientists and very articulate followers and I expect this book to hit a very raw nerve with them, I wont be surprise if this book generates a huge amount of heated debate.<br /><br />Where do I stand?<br /><br />1) There are just way too many \\"black swans\\" building up around NDE to close our eyes and ignore them. There are way too many doctors and studies coming up in favor of NDEs being real.<br /><br />2) Every single reason for \\"NDE is caused by xxx\\" as per conventional science, has been negated by this book and some others in this field (see reference in the book).<br /><br />3) If there is even a small element of truth to any one NDE experience in the world, it is just way too important for people to ignore - both as scientists and as individuals living a life(without requiring science to prove every important thing in your life including \\"I love my spouse/kids\\" - which people are willing to accept without \\"scientific proof in a laboratory\\")<br /><br />So I encourage you to read this book. I suspect that at some stage, the debate on NDE will the centrestage in the Dawkins/Atheists camp vs rest of the world. At least I hope it does. Truth will survive all assault...whether NDEs are eventually proven or not, for Truth's sake lets hope that there is intelligent and open minded discussions/research around this book rather than emotional arguments that both camps tend to use in justifying their viewpoints.

B003XKDEX4|3.0|The performances here are average at best.  If you want outstanding and very consistent renditions, try the I Musici or I Solisti Veneti boxes--though they are a little dated, all are magnificent.  If you are looking for more energy or intensity, try the recordings featuring Giulano Carmignola, usually with the Venice Baroque Orchestra.
B00008973A|3.0|The first live, professionally performed musical I ever saw was \\"A Chorus Line,\\" at Wolf Trap in Virginia, on the lawn with wine and a picnic with friends. I thought it was brilliant. That was 1982 though, and my memory is admittedly faded.<br /><br />After reading the \\"most helpful critical review\\" of the movie, I am sure purist fans of the show will disagree with me, but I enjoyed seeing the movie. Did I think it was a great movie? No, but I thought it was a decent movie, not boring, and refreshingly adult compared to a lot of musicals. This movie is not suitable for young children. By way of example, one of the songs, a clever number about the commodification of women in entertainment, is called \\"Dance 10, Looks 3 (T--s and A--)\\".<br /><br />For the uninitiated (are there any?), A Chorus Line is about auditions for a chorus line. There are parts for \\"four boys and four girls.\\" The exacting director, Zach, wants brilliant dancers. He explains further that they will need to do some acting in his show. He doesn't expect dancers of their caliber to be great actors, so he will cast people whose own personalities will work in the parts they need to play. After an initial audition group of dozens is weeded down to 16 people, Zach asks the dancers to talk about themselves. We learn about the dancers' personalities, their backgrounds, and why they became dancers. A 17th person, Zach's ex-girlfriend Cassie, arrives late for the audition. Desperate for work, she begs to be cast in the chorus, even though she has enjoyed considerable success as a soloist.<br /><br />I thought most of the acting was good, the dance well performed, the casting process made interesting, and most of the dancers' stories moving. I enjoyed hearing the songs again even though I did not like all the arrangements. In particular, a lot of \\"I Hope I Get It\\" was arranged to sound like a television ad jingle. I especially liked Terrence Mann as Zach's assistant Larry. They did a decent job making the camerawork lively. I felt the dancers' tension and an emotional stake in the outcome of the auditions.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the nature of the show (it grew out of some workshops that originally were thought likely only to be of interest to the theater community--nobody anticipated a monster hit that would be the longest-running show on Broadway for many years), all of which takes place on a theater stage, makes it very difficult to open out in the medium of film. I am sure many people for whom the show is a huge cultural touchstone would have preferred that they make a visual record of it by actually filming a number of live performances and editing the best into a cohesive whole, rather than this movie which substitutes a few of the songs, replaces the choreography with something more in the style of \\"Flashdance\\" than the Broadway show, and tries unsuccessfully to heighten the drama by playing up Cassie's relationship with Zach (due partly to the limp performance by the actress who plays Cassie, and partly to her zero chemistry with Michael Douglas as Zach). I probably would have preferred that too. Some stage musicals just don't really need to be translated into the fundamentally different medium of film. \\"A Chorus Line\\" falls into that category.<br /><br />If you have seen \\"A Chorus Line\\" on stage and it's a big favorite, you will probably want to avoid this movie.

1423101502|4.0|Riordan delivers an action-packed, suspense-filled story with his final book in the \\"Percy Jackson and the Olympians\\" series titled \\"The Last Olympian.\\" The battle is on between Kronos, his Titans, the Olympians, and the demigods. The prize is Earth and it's way of life. Who will win?<br /><br />New York is under siege and the Titan Typhoon is wreaking havoc throughout America. The mist hides the truth from humans, but the demigods and Olympians struggle against the Titans. Percy leads Camp Half-Blood in the defense of New York, however things aren't what they seem. By the time the dust settles, Percy and his friends will have their courage, resolve, and inner strength tested. The final battle is packed with surprises.<br /><br />Riordan's writing style is easy to read. There's adventure, fast-paced action, and plenty of suspense mixed in with the perfect does of tender, character revealing moments.<br /><br />Percy's come a long way since his first adventure, displaying a rare maturity for his age. Nico diAngelo, Hades' son, also proves his worth. There are a lot of surprises in store for the demigods and how they face adversity defines their character. It's a lesson that will resonate with the novel's young reading audience.<br /><br />Again, Riordan's done a wonderful job putting a modern twist on the ancient Greek legends, making them appealing for today's audience. The series inspires young readers to explore and read.<br /><br />\\"The Last Olympian\\" is full of secrets, unexpected twists, and nail-biting suspense. Readers 9-years-old and up will enjoy this novel. I highly recommend it.

B00884GR0W|5.0|I must say this game was very detailed and quite unique, but it just wasn't what I wanted. Its very difficult to build and mine. The quests are too hard, and crafting is just... Bleh EDIT: They have updated the game a lot and it is now 10x better.
0307949486|4.0|If I hadn't seen the movie, I don't think I would have lasted through the first 200 pages of this book. There is no way the early parts of this novel could be called a 'page-turner' by anyone who isn't a Swedish Fan of tourism.  Once the book gets past page 200 the thrills start. There are two investigations that dovetail, action, some mild sex, crisp dialogue, and a great story about journalism and economic shenanigans that I found more interesting than the other parts of the book.<br /><br />I ended up liking this, but am glad I didn't buy into the hype a few years ago.  I would have been very disappointed.

B000UFAURI|5.0|This has got to be the most diverse album from the foo´s yet. Its simply full of great melodies and a good balance between their hard-driving guitar rock and the mellower stuff that the band is certainly capable of creating. I have to admit that I am not into 50 minutes pure up-tempo rock with constantly distorted guitars and minor chords. For me to enjoy harder sounding rock bands like Foo Fighters, there has to be quieter moments that shows depth and reflection. This is fullfilled with \\"Echoes, silence, patience & grace\\". From heavy tunes like \\"Let it die\\" and \\"Erase/replace\\" to the beautiful longing and melancholy of \\"Home\\", and with cool midtempo popsongs \\"Long road to ruin\\" and \\"Statues\\", this release has won me over. - And I still love it today, 5 years after its release.

B006O2QNOU|1.0|As someone who works in finance, I can tell you that this movie is just retarded.  It's filled with typical liberal quips about \\"making too much money\\" (oddly they don't talk about how much Stephen Spielberg or Johnny Depp make).  It also has a nonsensical diatribe where one of the characters talks about how he \\"made a bridge\\" and it helps so many people.  He obviously doesn't talk about where the financing came to make the bridge.  Another typical liberal jab that infrastructure spending is selfless and noble but managing capital markets is ignoble.  I'm amazed this movie has such good reviews but, considering the average American can complete 16+ years of education without having taken a single finance or accounting class in either K-12 or in 4 years of college, I'm not exactly surprised.
B0095R64AO|2.0|Watched it with my wife because she thought it looked cute. Not very entertaining. This movie was not funny or very romantic.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The first part of the book is very interesting but the story becomes far stretched and difficult to believe. However, it was a good read.
B0070ZLZ1G|5.0|As a retired psychologist, I was familiar with much of the research that Paul Tough reviewed, however I was encouraged to read about the successful efforts to promote the traits of conscientiousness, perseverance, and \\"grit\\" in students.  This is an important book for parents, educators, and politicians to read.<br /><br />I would have liked a discussion of temperament included.  (See a discussion of Temperament on the Wikipedia website. ) Most parents recognize their children's temperamental traits from an early age.  Stella Chase and Herbert Birch were among the first to note that many children show  inborn traits that reflect \\"easy,\\" \\"slow to warm up\\" and \\"difficult\\" temperaments.  The concept of \\"goodness of fit\\" between the child's temperament and his/her environment  are critical to promote success.  I expect that even children experiencing many stressors differ in the way they respond, as examined in the literature on the \\"resilient child.\\"  I am just emphasizing the need to meet children's individual needs as they progress through any program. Obviously in the impressive case studies presented, each individual was involved in a caring, supportive relationship with a mentor.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Great book for history lovers. It gets a little long, specially on the long descriptions of the soviet revolution. None the less, an amazing read full of amazing characters and stories. Almost like 5 stories in 1 book.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|Blake Crouch's \\"Pines\\" was a surprising good page turner.  It was my first introduction to Crouch's writing and it was not disappointing at all.

B007THA4FI|4.0|I continue to be impressed by JK Rowling's ability to create truly real characters. While most of the characters in 'The Casual Vacancy' are not people I particularly like, they are people that I have met in my life and that ring absolutely true on the page. This is a novel that presents humans as their messy, selfish selves but that also demonstrates that despite their many flaws, they can occasionally rise above their nature. It's an excellent piece of writing.
B000E1YW0E|5.0|I had seen this movie a while ago, and I knew I had to own it. It is a moving movie that highlights so many important life lessons and issues in the world. It is about far more than the AIDS crisis.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I'm not really one for writing reviews, but having just finished the Wool Omnibus Edition, I realize I haven't been that drawn into and intrigued by a story in many moons. The strange yet believable world of the silo, its inhabitance and its inherent secrets were something I had a hard time putting down. And while I love science fiction, by making these characters fully dimensional, this work transcends the genre to where most readers who enjoy a good mystery would love it. I hope Mr Howey continues with the tales of the down-deeps, the mids and the up-tops, because I'm certainly looking forward to exploring many more levels.

B0031RAOW8|3.0|Director Lasse Hallstom (\\"Cider House Rules\\") recreates a 1987 Japanese film (\\"Hachiko Monogatari\\") which was based on a true story from the late 1920's.  Richard Gere stars as Parker Wilson, a middle aged college music professor.  He lives in a bucolic small town in what appears to be New England and commutes on the train to work.  One day he arrives home to find an Akita puppy wondering the train station platform.  He takes the dog home and tries to find the owner but alas no luck. With the reluctant approval of his wife (Joan Allen), he adopts the dog.<br /><br />From this point, it's just a matter of time to determine what unfortunate fate will strike the dog (Hachi) or the Wilson family.  And since this is really a movie about a man and his dog's love and loyalty, the \\"G\\" rating should give away the answer.  Yes there is a goodly amount of sentimentality but not enough to make the movie overly schmaltzy.  Ultimately it has a good story, some decent acting and is heartwarming and modest enough for the entire family.<br /><br />The Blu ray version of this film is just fine.  Shot on video, it comes with a 1.85:1 aspect ratio and a 1080p resolution.  Although not of demo quality, it was always accurate and clear.  The  DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 soundtrack likewise is perfectly fine.  Most of the action is up front and the dialog is clear and distinctive.  Aside from the usual trailers the special features only consist of a \\"making of\\" feature.
B009NPKTN6|2.0|Ok, maybe it's my fault. I guess I didn't pay enough attention to the trailers. But I never noticed that this movie was going to be full of people singing songs throughout! And yes, I knew it was \\"based on\\" an actual musical. Anyway, I was really excited to watch this movie, given all the great celebrities in it. I even made my husband watch it with me. Now I need to figure out how to give him those two hours back that he wasted watching this with me. I'm in trouble! LOL. The stars are still great, and the music is actually pretty good - love the 80's! But it was not what I was expecting, hence the 2 stars.
B009AMAMF2|5.0|I suspect this is one of those films that most people will fall into a love it or hate it camp.  It is long (just short of 3 hours), complicated and controversial.  Actors Tom Hanks, Jim Broadbent, Halle Berry, Jim Sturgess, Ben Whishaw and Hugh Grant play half a dozen roles and another handful of actors have 3 or more characters.  Unless you know ahead of time, you will have a hard time identifying some of the actors.  That certainly is part of the fun.<br /><br />It is nearly impossible to try to describe a plot or a story, so let me just say that there is a connection between the characters that strongly suggest a minimum of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu and the probability of reincarnation.  The six stories cover a period from 1849 to 2349 and somehow the directors and co-writers (Lana and sibling Andy Wachowski along with Tom Tykwer) and especially editor Alexander Berner, make the transition between the segments amazingly seamless.  It will take me another viewing or two to come close to making all the links but suffice it to say, it's all there.<br /><br />What is interesting is that each actor's character does not necessarily have the same values or personality in another segment.  There is an evolution of sorts that is transpiring.  In that the individual stories cover half a millennium, it is remarkable that each segment is handled so beautifully when it comes to the technical aspects of the production.  In any one scene we see a sailing ship crossing an ocean transition to a 1970's reporter investigating a potential nuclear cover-up and on to a futuristic battle for human survival.  The film is funny at times, erotic on occasion and full of big screen wonder.  I need to see it again.

0425263908|3.0|I must say how disappointed I was with the comparison of this book to 50 shades. Gideon does not have the charm that lures everyone into 50. Also, 50 is so well written in the sexual scenes. I'd hoped for some of the banter I'd grown to love in 50, all in all I felt like I did read the book in 2 days so it was interesting but not like 50. The second book is so much better.
0575081406|5.0|This has to be the most incredible, astonishing and intensely gripping debut fantasy novel I have ever encountered. I was recommended this book a while back on GoodReads in view of the fact that I am an avid reader of the fantasy genre and love to hear about new, fresh works within this genre. As soon as I began to read chapter one I knew that I had stumbled upon something quite exceptional, that I can only explain as my reaction being something on a par with how I responded the first time I ever read JRR Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. I would like to reiterate the comments by Publishers Weekly who said \\"...this is the type of assured, rich first novel that most writers can only dream of producing...the fantasy world has a new star.\\" I couldn't agree more with this statement that is so true, as I feel that although there is so much great works within the fantasy genre, I have just found something quite remarkable and momentous. It is Patrick Rothfuss' originality, depth and complexity of plot, fluid and beautiful narrative that makes this story not just your average magical, fantastical delight but somewhat truly great. It is like someone has opened a door onto the fantasy world glancing at Narnia, Middle-Earth, Pern and Novaria and has then looked even further across the horizon to see the four corners of civilization, where this inspired writer's world lies amidst all of the familiar and outstanding creations that we know and love. It is humorous in places as well and absolutely terrifying, as it touches upon all the senses making you feel so many different emotions like never before; with one minute anxious and scared to the next feeling totally elated and empowered. Rothfuss' world and entire creation full of magic and demons, Dragons, bloodlust and great power. It has that wonderful historical element to it that so many readers love with formidable battles between the good and the ambitious. The book is divided into two time periods with the first in the present and the other covering years of the past, that chronicling Kvothe's youth as he tells his story to a Chronicler who asks for the unexaggerated version of his life.<br />\\"...I have stolen princesses back from sleeping barrow kings. I burned down the town of Trebon. I have spent the night with Felurian and left with both my sanity and my life. I was expelled from the University at a younger age than most people are allowed in. I tread paths by moonlight that others fear to speak of during day. I have talked to Gods, loved women, and written songs that make the minstrels weep. My name is Kvothe.You may have heard of me\\". So begins the tale of Kvothe with his daringly brazen yet successful bid to enter a difficult and dangerous school of magic. One comes to know Kvothe the notorious magician, the accomplished thief, the masterful musician, the dragon-slayer, the legend-hunter, the lover, the thief and the infamous assassin. The more you read on into the story the more you want to know about the protagonist who is so believable, who one can relate to and connect with in a tale that is so delicately woven and subtle but has the most powerful and profound effect on the imagination. I am just so excited and cannot wait until the release of the sequel `The wise mans fear' day 2: the Kingkiller chronicles. This has to be my read of the year and one which is a great testimony and verification as to why I am a devotee and enthusiast of the fantasy genreent and the other covering years of the past, that chronicling Kvothe's youth as he tells his story to a Chronicler who asks for the unexaggerated version of his life.<br />\\"...I have stolen princesses back from sleeping barrow kings.

0575089911|5.0|If you thought that you had experienced it all within the fantasy genre, by reading the most original and inspired imaginative creations, then you obviously have not discovered Brandon Sanderson as yet. His Mistborn trilogy is something quite remarkable and unlike anything I have ever encountered before, with his concepts on magic and death to be something quite different from what is stereotypical of the fantastical world. The trilogy begins with book one Mistborn: the final empire and then continues with book two, Mistborn: the well of ascension and Mistborn three: hero of ages and is basically a hybrid epic fantasy heist story with a focus on political intrigue and powerful action scenes.<br /><br />For a thousand years the Skaa lived in fear as the Lord ruler reigned over the entire world filling everyone with fear and terror, with his power growing as he became invincible. Every attempt at a insurrection was futile but hope was not lost as a new kind of uprising starts to be planned, which is dependant upon the cunning of a criminal mastermind and the courage of the most unlikeliest of heroines. A Skaa street urchin named Kelsier is the only person to survive and escape the Lord Ruler's most brutal prison, who learns Allomancy and the power of the Mistborn. The Mistborn is based on the internal \\"burning\\" of certain metals all of which the Mistborn can use, and is certainly the main element of this narrative that makes it so atypical and idiosyncratic of the author. Kelsier must travel to the center of the palace to discover the secret of the Lord Ruler's power and ultimately find the key to destroying him, thus infiltrating the nobility and possibly overthrow the existing state of affairs.

B007GCY8FS|1.0|I couldnt make sense of the ending.<br /><br />Not in the same league as other Lee Child books in Jack Reacher series.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|It is basically the Twilight story, rich, handsome guy falls for inexperienced girl who can't figure out why this \\"amazing\\" guy likes her. The difference is that rather than restraint, this guy uses restraints during a lot of sex.<br />It is an easy read, not especially well written, again same level of writing skill as twilight, which<br />isn't great.  That doesn't mean it's not fun to read anyway.

B004UC4HCG|2.0|I work at a medium size company that was committed to Shuttle computers mostly because of the form factor, and I am responsible for switching us to a mainstream vendor due to reliability problems.<br /><br />To summarize the decision:<br /><br />* Power supplies routinely fail on all of our Shuttle computers.<br />* Small form factor PCs are provided by mainstream PC vendors.<br />* This particular model seems to suffer from random power off events, not fixable by replacing the power supply. ( present in at least 5 of 20+ PCs ).<br />* Long term support seems to be poor, although I have no personal experience with it.
B009KHDT0C|4.0|I am only 25, but am a big fan of the original Dark Shadows tv series. With all of the mixed reviews this movie received, seemingly more so negative, I figured I would stay away from it. However after my father saw it on a plane he recommend we give it a shot. The movie was not what I expected. While it definitely is not a 100% throw back to the old series I found the story and overall plot to be entertaining and well crafted. The key here I feel is Johnny Depp's Barnabas. I feel he stayed very true to Johnathan Frid's overall style of the character of Barnabas with some humor thrown into the mix. He and Eva Green definitely carry the movie. Eva Green made for a very menacing and cruel Angelique and was a great leading lady opposite Johnny Depp. The rest of the cast played their characters well, but played modern societies image of a typical modern dysfunctional family rather than a secretive family with a rich, but dark history. The goal of the movie seemed to be to compile all of the major events in the first half of the original series in the \\"modern day\\" (1960s in the old show 1970s in the movie) as well as touch on how Barnabas was cursed. The key to enjoying this movie is to go in with an open mind. Do not expect the old series, but expect a drama/comedy with a modern and Tim Burton style Gothic twist, which is actually not over done in this movie, with some familiar elements. Is it a candidate for greatest movie ever made? Of course not, but If you go in with this in mind you will probably enjoy this movie.
B007FEFLTO|2.0|An awkard sensation of \\"deja vu\\" in this second book, the pace and the rythm was far from the thriling events of the first volume. A lot of scenes and descriptions were too much predictable. We can only hope the last volume of the trilogy will catch the first one!

075669812X|5.0|My son (age 8) has several of these DK Lego books. I have reviewed all of them and would give them (and this one) 6 stars if I could. Amazon has excellent prices on them and they are well worth it if you have a young person who likes Lego's. This one, like most, comes with a special edition Lego mini-figure (even though the product page shows the insert area blanked out). It has the entire Ninjago universe laid out in extremely colorful and detailed photos. Even one of the small bagged Target sets that my son got a year ago gets a whole page to itself. Very detailed photos but more importantly a lot of written material as well associated with each page, set, and figure. My son lugs these around the house and prefers to read them to watching TV. He likes to read about the little tidbits associated with the characters and sets, and although not perhaps incredibly intellectually stimulating, it is reading and most importantly he does it on his own, is interested in the subject matter, and likes to talk about what the books are telling him. (I will also admit that I have read them all to, just because they are that well done.)<br /><br />We are over two months into the Lego Batman DK book and he still reads it daily. Star Wars and Lego Harry Potter are still by his bed and get read weekly and they are about a year old in our house. This one being new has displaced them on the top of the heap. At the price Amazon discounts these they are well worth. I highly recommend. Also Scholastic publishes a similar looking and titled book on the Lego ninjago universe also with free figure. The DK book however has the actual Lego sets in it as well as descriptions about the characters and ninja go universe. The scholastic book just has descriptions on the characters and doesn't actually feature any Lego sets. We have both in our house and the DK book is the nicer of the two in my opinion.
0741470314|4.0|First of all, I am a ridiculously big MJ fan, so any positive publication is going to get high marks from me.<br /><br />Much of the info in this book was taken from other sources for sure, but I'm not offended by that, as MJ was generally a very private man. Any fan knows most of all that is contained within it but it's all still very nice to read.<br /><br />While I am not surprised that the end touches on the notion that MJ was supernatural to the point of Divine, I completely reject that. He was AMAZING and there was never anyone like him ABSOLUTELY!!!! I whole-heartedly believe he was the greatest but there are enough factual accolades about his greatness without jumping into the realm of the riduculous. Even MJ himself would likely reject, and may even take offense, to the notion that he is Jesus reincarnated. Get a grip people! He was just a man. But OH MY GOODNESS.... What an amazing man he was!!<br /><br />There is no need to go into detail because, like I said, there isn't a whole lot in here that wasn't already written but this book touches much more on his final years than any book I've read so far. It was very interesting getting the perspective of his security detail and it was very nice to read the contributions of his friends. He really was a good guy.<br /><br />WARNNG: The chapter about the events surrounding his death is enough to bring tears to your eyes. Such a tragedy. He was far too trusting and far too generous.<br /><br />Rest well Micheal
B009NQKXYK|3.0|This was an interesting movie. The movie's central idea about the origin of man was thought provoking. Some of the details from beginning to end were confusing, and I wonder if they were relevant to the plot. However, these questions might be resolved in another movie(?). I don't know, but if you eliminate that possibilty, the movie remains a bit too abstract for my taste, and I love sci-fi! Ridley Scott is normally great, but maybe his creative juices have finally dried up.
B0081KTI0E|2.0|Arthur Kipps is a lawyer in London whose wife has died in childbirth.  He has a four year old son and a nanny for him. However, he is in danger of losing his job at his law firm because apparently he has done nothing but mope around for the last four years. He is given one last chance to redeem himself, to go to a remote village and Eel Marsh House, where the owner has died, and sort out her many papers.<br /><br />He meets a man, Samuel Daily, on the train on the way there, and despite Arthur's very rarely opening his mouth to speak (ever), Samuel becomes his one ally in the town.  Arthur goes to Eel Marsh house to look for, and at the papers of this woman, and get them in order and locate her will.  How he is expected to do this, I do not understand, because even in the daylight, with candles, that place is dark as a cave.<br /><br />The important papers (birth and death certificates, adoption papers) are placed conveniently on top so that Arthur finds out what he needs to know right away - about the ghost, The Woman In Black (what wearing black has to do with anything they don't say). Every time he goes to the house, there is always a lot of unexplained sights and sounds, which never faze Arthur in the least. He's still just so stunned from losing his wife four years ago.<br /><br />The ghost, Jennet, really does seem to be taking her anger out on the wrong people. After so many deaths, you'd think they'd move away or hire an exorcist or something. As is usual in these movies, what the living person thinks/hopes/believes/is sure will appease the out of control ghost does not work. I didn't really care about any of these silly characters, and watching Arthur go from being covered in mud/dirt/or soaking wet to being dry and spotless wearing the same clothes, was irritating.<br /><br />Something that perturbed me: on the adoption papers those involved are referred to as Mr., Mrs., and Ms. (the unmarried ghost). But from all the period British novels I've read, there was no use of \\"Ms.\\" back then and periods after honorifics such as Mr, Mrs or Dr were not used, and still are not. Jennet should have been referred to as \\"Miss\\" on the adoption paper.<br /><br />Janet McTeer was wasted, but I guess it's a paycheck.was no use of \\"Ms.\\" back then and periods after honorifics such as Mr, Mrs or Dr were not used, and still are not.

This is an enjoyable album simply because I've never heard Barbra sing these chestnuts.  You actually hear a young Barbra singing.  If you have all her albums you must have this one.  You'll enjoy the music.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|I don't know how to explain this book...I read the Amazon review while sitting in an airport waiting for a plane. The review and title reeled me in...I was getting on a plane and decided to download the book.  I loved the concept of a bookstore open 24 hours a day, and it takes place in two of my favortie cities, San Francisco and New York City.  Then it becomes a mystery; why does the book store only sell a very few books? Why do they only have a couple of short shelves with new books for sale? Why do most people known as Members come in and check out books from the back of the store where the stacks are all most 3 stories high?  Those checking out the books are strange and the Clerk in the store must write in a log book each time a book is checked out and describe the Member checking out the book, details as to how he/she behaves write down to what the Memer is wearing.  And, then the young Bookstore Clerk begins to think about the fact that his generation no longer reads an acutal book, instead they download books, or read it on-line.  And, then one evening a strange, smart, beautiful girl who works for Google stops by the store...what is the Owner, Mr. Penumbra's story...he seems to have a mystery surrounding him. This is low-tech versus high-tech, but so much more.  I loved the read although it is complicated to explain.  I am a Baby-Boomer who found the intellecutual questions as compelling as the read.  It is worth your time.  I wish I had a hard copy to pass on to my nephew who is \\"old school\\" and will only read the real thing, \\"a book\\".  I think he would find it compelling too.

B00932AA5G|5.0|Watching the the beginning of the movie, I thought the story seemed a bit run of the mill, then it started getting a little bit too silly and I almost turned it off.

1451695195|2.0|There is much to suggest NDEs are real, from experiencers \\"seeing\\" physical things they couldn't observe from where their bodies were lying, such as objects atop tall cabinets, to encounters with relations they didn't learn about until afterwards.<br /><br />None of those things are in this book.<br /><br />In fact, all the confounding aspects of the NDE phenomenon are here. Absence of science; uniquely subjective experiences that don't jibe with others' testimony; lack of detail about the structure, mechanics, and purpose of the \\"next world.\\"<br /><br />Unlike most NDEers, Dr. Alexander gets no tunnel of light, nor life review, nor encounters with loved ones who have already crossed over. He perceives an extended flying journey over a richly colorful landscape -- something his subconscious dream factory might be likely to conjure, given his history of skydiving. Do all NDEers go to differently designed environments, or does each NDEer create his or her own?<br /><br />Dr. Alexander insists his physical brain could not have created his experience, but is maddeningly short of medical reasons why. He keeps saying his cerebral cortex was \\"offline,\\" \\"shut down,\\" etc. But that's pretty colloquial terminology, and at any rate most neurologists would tell you the brain delivers unexpected abilities and functions all the time.<br /><br />Dr. Alexander writes giddily about the huge stores of knowledge he acquired during his experience, but keeps most of it to himself. Only wisps and hints emerge. His post-recovery research is half a tour of old ground (as he discovers the 40-year-old research of Moody and Ring), half cribbed from pop summaries of quantum physics. Toward the end of the book, scientific method goes out the window. During his experience Dr. Alexander perceived a beautiful young woman flying alongside him, acting as a guide. He did not recognize her. Later he is given a photo of a deceased, previously unknown sibling, and decides that's who his guide had been -- an example of retroactive rationalization / evidence-tailoring that would shame any sophomore scientist.<br /><br />Despite the book's title, from a hard scientific perspective Dr. Alexander delivers no proof, any more than a UFO contactee with a vivid story to tell provides \\"proof\\" of UFOs. Ironically, in fact, Dr. Alexander's experience will bolster the skeptics' view that NDEs are locally manufactured hallucinations. There are many more convincing, hard-to-dismiss NDE stories to hear.an example of retroactive rationalization / evidence-tailoring that would shame any sophomore scientist.<br /><br />Despite the book's title, from a hard scientific perspective Dr. Alexander delivers no proof, any more than a UFO contactee with a vivid story to tell provides \\"proof\\" of UFOs.

0143113100|5.0|\\"The Brain that Changes Itself\\" is truly amazing. It gives hope to stroke victims, autistic children, dementia patients, brain injury patients and many others.  Dr. Doidge not only gives the reader carefully documented research and facts, but shows the reader how to partake in the latest discoveries. While much of the book is scientific, it's worth putting in the effort to learn about the plasticity of the brain and just by reading the book, it will help our brain expand by learning new areas.

B008OIQYTG|2.0|To be honest, the tracks are really good; however, the quality of the recording is really bad.  If you have a decent sound system, you will notice \\"clipping\\" going on from the very first track.  To my way of thinking, there is really no excuse for things like this.  What a shame that such a good song list could be so compromised.
B0079KKJ3M|3.0|Before Olivia Newton-John was known, she was part of a group called Toomorrow that made a movie by the same name. It was a disastrous flop, but I actually like it better than Two of a Kind. It will, however, never measure up to Grease. The story is better than in Xanadu, but the music in Xanadu is a lot better. The group gets abducted into an Alphoid spacecraft because of the vibes in their music, but they are returned to Earth as they can't produce these vibes in space, away from Earth. Later, however, their entire concert arena is beamed into Space. I'm glad that it finally got issued on DVD, but the DVD itself didn't live up to my expectations.  The quality is rather poor with some bits of footage lost here and there, and there's sound in only one channel. I would have preferred two-channel mono. Nevertheless, it does have some nostalgic value as it depicts some of the styles and general atmosphere at the end of the 1960s and beginning of the 1970s.

None of the characters were very likeable (except for one IT guy who's in two scenes), and there wasn't much character development at all.

B00526ZKYS|5.0|When I read the reviews I saw that some people actually didn't like the book.  But while I can understand why I am thinking that it was most likely because this is book is a starter for the series.  To some it may drag on with conversations and internal struggles but in reality we have to understand Lena'a character and why she makes the choices she does.  We also have to understand why their world is the way it is and understand how the government has brainwashed their citizens. When I read the hunger games and saw the movie so many people said that they hated.  They told me it dragged on and on and then the epic ending didn't last long like they thpught it would.  Well yes it was drawn out and long but every good serious needs a base to catapult itself into another book.  If your creating a new world in a novel this is mandatory or your reader will get lost. Delirum in my opinion was a fantastic book.  The premise if the story was flawless and her writing was fluid and beautiful.  I'll compare it to the likes of an artist.  Which is what Lena reminds me off. She notices the world around her and sees its beauty and grows to also see its lies.  Her growth is done wonderfully and not so fast that your sitting wondering what the hell.  It was realistic and well thought out.  This book is amazing and I really recommend you read this.  And if you don't like it well Amazon is amazing at returns so return it and call it a day.  But I have faith you wont

B009B50QOU|4.0|Green Day certainly aren't lacking for ambition. After two groundbreaking rock operas and a Broadway play, they decide it's time to revisit their roots of punk blasters. But not like they'll just rack up 12 songs and see what happens. \\"Uno\\" is the first step in a rapid fire release date trilogy, with \\"Dos\\" and \\"Tre\\" to follow. The album is a machine gun zapper of the kind of songs that made \\"Dookie\\" a classic,\\" with the band now sounding older loud and snotty instead of young. This is not a bad thing.<br /><br />In fact, there are remnants of the Ramones that haunt a lot of these tracks, be it the immediacy of \\"Nuclear family\\" or the snap-to-it of \\"Let Yourself Go,\\" that buzzsaw guitar riffing is care punk with the kind of pop-sugar coat that Green Day has excelled at for decades. Yet the band stretches on the dance ready \\"Kill The DJ,\\" which is begging for a remix, or the simple and sweet \\"Oh Love.\\"<br /><br />What is missing are good lyrics. Too many F-Bombs sound like the band wasn't 100% ready with the words, so they just filled in the blanks with obscenities. Not that there are a lack of great couplets, like \\"Want to crack your cranium delirium\\" on the rocker \\"Troublemaker\\" or \\"I ain't got much time, so I'll get to the point/Do you wanna share a ride and get the f--k out of this joint\\" on \\"Stay the Night.\\" (Which is backed up by \\"Carpe Diem.\\") \\"Uno!\\" is not a great album, but it kicks off the trilogy with a bang.
B007R41E8O|5.0|Twisted Lands - Shadow Lands is another Mystery/Hidden Object game from Alawar Entertainment - a company well known for its excellent games.  Well, this one is another fine example - beautiful artwork, mysterious story, and just enough difficulty to make it fun without making you so confused that you can't figure out what too do next.  Oh sure I had to use the hint button a bit; most of these games I'm just not expert enough - but I don't mind a push in the right direction as long as I'm not penalized for it.<br /><br />And as in most of today's games, this one has you going back and forth to get objects you need.  For example, you'll need something near the beach for something in town, you get it, bring it to town and use it, then find out you need something else near the beach.  You go get that, bring it back, then find you need something else, and so on ad infinitum.  Sometimes it does get old - you do wonder why you couldn't have picked everything up that you needed the first time, right?  Hear me Software Writers?<br /><br />Still, all that taken into account, this was an enjoyable game, but I don't want to give it away, so I'll state this in general terms, okay?  First - I was confused by the ending a bit - why did she do what she did?  She did not seem upset nor angry, right?  And if he was supposed to be what he was, how did he do what he did to her at the end - getting her from one place to another, right?  It just didn't make sense to me, illogical I'm sorry to say....

The ending left me wanting; I would not say more but wanting something. I was so engrossed in the book I was shocked it was over.  It felt like a great romance that turned into a one night stand.<br /><br />I do not want to give away the ending nor do I want to pull this book down as I did enjoy the time I spent with \\"The Book Thief\\" and look forward to more stories from this surprising writer.
B0090EIC3Y|2.0|It has its moments, but this movie is just simply unfunny to me most of the time. I think Sacha's best work came punking the unaware while Ali G. Even Borat had a better run as a feature-length movie...it's all a matter of opinion of course...knowing what kind of his work I prefer, though, should help you know if my 2-star rating means anything to you.
B0050DZ8J0|3.0|App needs a lot of work and to paraphrase the Head of the company doesn't think you care about the privacy of you data. Id be careful what I put into the site.
B005DESVPO|2.0|I love Gary clark Jr,s rough edged blues and realy hoped that this album would stick to the reason people buy his albums and what all the reviews talk about,HIS GUITAR STYLE ! This album has only a few good songs that (in my opinion) people like him for. It is a largely R&B and unlikable for that. I put an album in for a certain mood and this puts me in a bad mood, you get one great song then junk that belongs on a totaly different album. Its style is not consistant its all over the place..I gave it away.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator is supersized.  I can use it without wearing my glasses, I highly recommend this product.  It takes up the whole screen...it's great.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|This is absolutely one of the best super hero movies out right now.  Lot's of action and lot's of fun scenes.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|This game has been able to be easy enough to keep me my daughter who is 7 and my 2 yr old son busy for days and you don't have to spend any money unless you want too. Thanks again we love it
B000TXG3YA|5.0|I was really excited to get the Red Album, having heard a some of Baroness' other work.  This album did not disappoint.  It was a little heavier that the other albums I have heard, but that is not a problem.  These guys are really good, and this album is a must-have if you are a fan.
B0098VYCCE|3.0|This movie was accomplished in a visual sense, but didn't have a whole lot else going for it. It was a total waste of Chris Hemsworth, who didn't have much to do in the film. The trailer had made me think this was going to be a cool movie about this princess learning to become a warrior, taught by the hot Huntsman, whom she would end up having a thing with. Well, I don't want to give away anything, but let me just say that you get a couple of tepid bits of what I expected, but not a lot. I also thought Theron wasn't great -- and I generally like her. Her accent was bad (always annoying to me), and her \\"losing it\\" parts just didn't cut it. Back to the talent they wasted: the great Ian McShane, playing a small role (no pun intended) as a dwarf. I see that man on screen, I want MORE! I can't help but feel like a bunch of material must have ended up on the cutting room floor, yet they chose to leave in much that could have (and should have) gone. Dwarves singing, etc. -- CUT IT!  Kristen Stewart actually wasn't bad -- did a credible job in her \\"Henry the V rallies the troops\\" rip-off scene. Really, this was about plot and choices more than anything else.
B0087HT36U|5.0|very entertaining... fun levels. my son and myself play levels over and over. wish there were more levels though but still overall a great game.... keep it up
B0040JHLM2|4.0|I ordered this shoe after reviewing available running shoes on Amazon.com and I am happy with my purchase! It is very light and provides a good cushion to the feet, along with the intended stability. It seems to be made of quality materials, and appears well stitched and cushioned. You can clearly make out the lightness of the shoe compared to the one I had before (a regular Nike sneaker) and running is that much easier with this one. I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a well cushioned light shoe for running.
B0053VKP8S|5.0|Using it to connect a digital-only output LCD television to an ancient analog-only receiver.  Yes, the volume is very muted, as others have said.  But keep in mind the cost of a high quality DAC.  Unless this is your main setup and you're an audiophile, I'd give this a try before spending $200 on a high end product.
B008LSVL6U|5.0|Dark yet beautiful. If Clapton is God, Steven Wilson is the holy ghost. Why isn't this music anywhere in the mainstream? I guess I'm just a grumpy old man that doesn't get it.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|This release is the best I have ever seen the 'Indiana Jones' series look. The detail is striking and the sound track rocks. So happy this was treated with such respect!
B006OAB3ME|5.0|I purchased this CD for my father as a gift.  He absolutely loves it!  Paul McCartney is fantastic! A great combination of old and new songs made a wonderful gift.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved Catching Fire as well as Hunger Games.  Not a science fiction fan, but this was a great story that captured my interest.  Could not put it down until the end where I started Mockingjay to find out the final outcome of the trilogy.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|The mark of athena is an engaging book that follows in the footsteps of Riordan's previous books.  It is full of action, and ends with a twist that you will not suspect. So to summerize this is a good book.
B009KHBDUU|3.0|Had it's moments but overall was poorly written. The idea for someone from the past being subjected to present day is not new and that's pretty much what this movie is about.<br /> Seems like more movies are coming out from Hollywood with very little attention to details. Granted, they were writing a comedy but the plot should still have something to it besides just capitalizing on the actors fame and the the watchers remembering the old TV series. I really think movies should be able to stand on their own. In my opinion, it's just laziness and the desire to mae a quick buck.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|Great season, some very shocking things happen.  When you think you've got it all figured out it takes an unexpected turn...love this show!!!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Great price for what you get.  I don't have a 3D Blu Ray player, but the price was still cheaper than anywhere else.  So once I get a 3D player, I will be able to watch it.<br />Movie is highly recommended.
0671449028|2.0|I read this book as a child and later as a baby sitter.  The order of the events that are done before going to bed makes no sense and I felt that way even as a child.  Plus as an adult I know that all the running around is not conducive to sleeping.  I could not enjoy this book no matter how many times I read it.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|Great Movie! I would love to see a sequel. I would recommend it to anyone who likes Sci-Fi Movies. The quality was good from Amazon Video online too.
0679777547|2.0|THE CLUB DUMAS, by Perez-Reverte....I had a difficult time getting INTO this story.  The author's characters were not very interesting to me....may be to others but not to me.  His character descriptions and  his general descriptions of scenes and people seemed like they were written by someone who was working overtime at being creative...they didn't \\"feel\\" natural or \\"genuine\\"....more contrived, as though the writer was a student in a composition class who was trying to impress an instructor. This purchase was just fine in terms of getting what I paid for...the physical condition of the book was very good...delivery time was excellent.  I just did NOT like the book.  I read it because it was being discussed by my book club. I think part of the reason I disliked it so much was that I had a hard time getting in to it so it felt like a READING ASSIGNMENT rather than an enjoyable read....It's a book I would not have finished if it had not been an \\"assignment.'
B009NPKTN6|4.0|Very different from the Broadway version but good.  Tom Cruise does an excellent job.  I was surprised!<br />I was not impressed with Alec Baldwin.
B009YDAUJ0|5.0|Who'd have thunk it?! The best episode this season does not have Rick and company -- period. Considering \\"season 2\\" had awful writing and dialog, this season -- in particular this episode -- is brilliant. Way to come back! Characters are complex with the perfect balance of horror and drama.<br /><br />The Governor makes Shane look like Mother Teresa. I'm not sure why his men are loyal to him, I mean to say I don't yet understand how they look the other way and participate in the horror. But hey, gang members do it everyday.<br /><br />Andrea seems \\"hot for teacher\\" with the teacher being the man who can educate everyone on how to stay safe in a world full of zombies (a.k.a. the governor). No fooling Michonne. I predict a flashback in a future episode of how she became like she is, which will include the back-story of her two zombie pals.<br /><br />This episode is a combination of the best parts of \\"Day of the Dead - 1980 version\\" + \\"Re-animator\\" + \\"Stepford Wives\\" +  M. Night Shyamalan's \\"The Village.\\"
B007OWRBJK|4.0|Mr. Townsend is one of my fave songwriters and gitbox strummers. I admire his imagination and ability to (sometimes) convey strong messages creatively across multi disciplines (rock, pop, opera, film theater, etc.) He writes well about his creative process (if a tad labored on details of Neve mixing boards, etc.) and about his life growing up in the post-war years. He is honest in his accounts of wreckless drug use and borderline misogyny. Where the memoir falls down is on his overly defensive and slightly re-engineered account of his child pornography prosecution. Otherwise a good addition to the rock'n'roll canon.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It is so good but hard on some levels. but really good in general!You also have to constantly look up because you might jot connect the pipe and have to start over by you used to it
B001TODCII|2.0|I hate to say it, but this is a perfectly awful film.<br /><br />Right from the start, there is something wrong with the tone of the film, as the retired agent is trying to get close to the daughter he alienated by his long and mysterious absences.  The viewer gets dished up a dripping melodrama about a painful divorce, with all the hot button scenes - trying to get her attention with a gift, his ex-wife standing in the way the whole while with bitter sarcasm, and the innocent (beautiful) daughter pampered by her new dad - that are supposed to pull at the heartstrings.  The acting was so wooden and the dialogue so stilted that I couldn't believe any of it.<br /><br />Then suddenly, the tone shifts:  dad excessively worries about the daughter going to Europe on her own at 17, and sure enough, she is immediately abducted by the worst kind of guy and gang.  But dad happens to be available and puts his \\"special skills\\" to work, becoming a sudden superhero, in a blur of brutal violence, questionable methods to put it mildly, and an entry into the underworld of modern slavery and prostitution.  This section is better, if you are looking for an action film with a lone good guy fighting packs of baddies.  I enjoyed this part more, though wondered about the PG-13 rating.  It is raw, ugly, and full of blatant stereotypes.  That he rescues her - miraculously not violated or even deflowered, but right at the moment a fat ugly sheik is about to have his way with her - is to be expected.  But all credibility is lost - seeing that he is also now a criminal fugitive in France, you wonder how he gets her out.  It is so ridiculously unbelievable that I could never completely go with the flow for fun.<br /><br />It is shocking how stupid this all is.  What a disappointment.  Not recommended.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|Awesome concert! Have watched this DVD several times, love the songs that Eric Clapton, Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr and many others sing. A DVD to buy if you are a Beatles fan.
B009HQ9UHC|2.0|This game is tons of fun. However, twice now I have been on the 20th level or so and I've come back into the game to have all previous work gone and starting over at level 1. Super frustrating andnot fun re-doing levels over and over. &asymp;( ThereforeI am done playing. 5 stars if not for this.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Book is very entertaining, easy to read, even better than the first.<br />For those who loved the twilight saga.<br />Will definetely read the third.
B0034DGPEU|1.0|I cannot believe how so many people thought this book exemplified good literature. Just because the author includes every known example of slave realationship to white owners, and throws in a child indentured servant (?) and tells us it's in Virginia between 1797 and 1810, that doesn't make this a historical novel. The presentation was lame and flat sounding, as were the characters. Had the writer been more skilled in writing it has the bones of what could have been really entertaining, but I could hardly skim read fast enough. Not my idea a good reading experience. Warning! Kindle buyers.
B000OT6V00|5.0|As mid October rolls around, brisk winds sweep through the crisp autumn air, jack o'lanterns decorate steps and porches, the scent of wood smoke radiates from wood stoves, and the leaves are in their peak season of color. October is a magnificent month, and in celebration of its annual visit, I've decided to review a few great flicks for the Halloween season. The titles that I've chosen to review are \\"alternative\\" Halloween movies... not the classics that generally spring to mind, but fun movies with elements of the supernatural. Just good, lighthearted stuff here... nothing gory or scary (at least not too much)!<br /><br />\\"Hellboy\\" is one such film, a delightful treat for the eyes and the imagination alike. This movie is based on one of the lesser known comic book heroes, and the results are fantastic. Guillermo Del Toro's unique directing style and eye for spectacle is well served in the bizarre universe of \\"Hellboy\\", where creatures of all shapes and sizes are about, going bump in the night and causing mischief. The characters are well played and extremely likable, particularly the charismatic Ron Pearlman as none other than Hellboy himself. It's great fun to partake in the adventures of Hellboy and his companions, as they attempt to unravel the engaging plot line that revolves around the occult. It's a wild ride that stimulates the imagination, and it looks especially vivid on Blu-ray. Fantastic, from start to finish!
1451620829|5.0|Great book that really shows the insights into the excesses of rock and roll.  Peter pulls no punches in his sometimes shocking account of his life both in and out of KISS and how he percieves the members of the band.  I took me about 2 days to ready this book as I could not put it down.  Must read for any KISS fan or any fan of rock and roll.

Just good, lighthearted stuff here... nothing gory or scary (at least not too much)!<br /><br />As imaginative and stimulating as the first \\"Hellboy\\" movie was, \\"The Golden Army\\" manages to surpass it. It's crammed with critters and beasties that any fan of the supernatural, science fiction, special effects, or creature features is sure to enjoy, high lighted by a particularly enjoyable romp through the \\"troll market\\". Del Toro's unique vision is once again brought to life in this eye-popping spectacle, which looks absolutely stunning on Blu-ray. The plot is much more \\"fantasy\\" based than \\"occult\\", as it was in the first movie, but it's still fantastic, and it works perfectly with the imaginative universe that the  charismatic Hellboy and his friends inhabit. If you're home on Halloween night, a double feature of \\"Hellboy\\" and \\"The Golden Army\\" is a great way to spend the evening, as you munch upon Whoppers and Reese's, dispensing candy to the little ones as they come knocking at the door. Just be sure that you're giving your treats to children in costume, and not creatures that have escaped from the imaginative world of Hellboy... on second thought, you should probably give them candy, too. Got to keep those trolls happy, you know... it's certainly in your best interest to do so!
B008G8SFGO|3.0|Monster reminds me of the 80's work that the band did.  Very disjointed and very little flow to the songs in the mix.  PLEASE stop Gene from singing - his voice is okay on a few songs every now and then, but he should be limited in what he takes the lead on.  He is not a lead singer and never will be.  Glad to see that Thayer and Singer got a chance to show what they can do - their respective songs are decent.  Overall, not my favorite KISS album.
1908117230|4.0|Hi, like everyone else that wrote a review and commented on Mr.Hermes showing how to make the Italian Meringue only and that's what I also thought, until I read the recipes one by one, not until then that one will notice that the French meringues are included at the beginning of each recipe, you'll see it there. I haven't made any of the recipes in the book yet,  but they do sound excellent, I love the intelligence that Mr.Hermes accomplished by marrying the different ingredients together, something that no one has done before.

B00622B3MY|5.0|My 3yr old absolutely loves loves loves anything Disney Pixar Cars/Cars 2 related. From different clothing paraphernalia to any and all figurines, toys & youtube videos. So needless to say he went absolutely bananas when I got the movie for him. So on behalf of him I have to give this movie 5 stars!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a great book and the rest of the serees is just as good.  I was unable to put the book down and finished it rather quickly.  I would highly reccommend this book.
B003O86FMW|5.0|After the way the first book had the mutant animals , I didn't even want to read the second. So glad I did! This book had the perfect blend of sarcasm, excitement, suspense and thrill that I couldn't put it down! Well done! I have to download the third book asap!!

B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Great Movie with an Excellent cast that feels like it flows naturally from the previous movies. Now Joss, with all this new found blockbuster glory... maybe you can Bring Back Firefly.  :-D
B0029XFN9O|5.0|The 1st and 2nd Home Alone movies are like THE BEST Christmas movies in my opinion. Could watch them over and over and over without getting tired of it. The blu-ray version looks great and I can see lots of details I never could see on my old VHS tapes. Glad I could find it on Amazon because I couldn't really find the blu-ray of either one in stores near me.

B009KHDT0C|5.0|Not only is Johnny Depp amazing in this movie, but the supporting cast is crazy good.<br /><br />This movie is funny, dark, sad, surprising and beautiful to watch.<br /><br />This quickly became one of my all time favorites.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This modern coming of age tale was perfectly transparent. It is simply written yet very thought provoking. I would recommend this book for an adult audience.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|I thought the story was weak, basing it the evil corporation.  It didnt tie off scene at the beginning with the rest of the story.  But the effects were good
B000007VCM|5.0|After this album I would recommend skipping the next 3 albums, they are boring as hell, really mainstream and unmemorable, but this album is great!
B000KIPD5E|1.0|usually Behringer is a good and trusted product, but not this device.  It stopped working after 2 months of normal use.  By normal, i mean that I plugged my Martin Guitar into \\"In 1\\" and \\"out A\\" to my sound board. I used the factory PSU-SB adapter as well.  The device just stopped working.  Nothing out of the ordinary occurred.  There is power through the PSU-SB adapter, but nothing lights up on the device.<br />Furthermore, I submitted a claim under the warranty online to Behringer a few weeks ago, but have heard nothing.  I cannot find any contact numbers to contact the company directly.  It seems that they really don't want to back up their products.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000KIPD5E Behringer AB100 Instrument/Amplifier Selector]]
B004ZY0VHY|5.0|Excellent book.  I saw the movie first and knew that there were so many missing things so I ordered the book right away.  I was right, the book goes into all the details that you just do not see in the movie.  This is an excellent read.  A very dark subject about human nature.  I highly recommend it.  It really does raise the question \\"nature or nurture?\\"

0393976041|5.0|The Bennet household is in a bit of a financial bind. They have five unmarried daughters with almost no dowry, and the estate is to be inherited by a mysterious cousin that no one's met yet. But things get exciting when a rich bachelor moves to town and brings is even richer bachelor friend. Every young lady in the area is ready to throw themselves at these men. Except, of course, for Elizabeth Bennet. She instantly decides that the rich bachelor is perfect for her sister, Jane, and his richer friend is the most detestable man on the planet. Thus starts one of the best-loved romances in Western literature. And, like most everyone else, I loved this story. Even on the nth reading of it.<br /><br />Since there's not much else I can say in a mini-review of the story that hasn't been said over and over, I'll discuss the supplementary material in the Norton Critical Edition. There wasn't a LOT of supplementary information in the book, but it was generally of good quality. It started with a biography of Austen, punctuated with letters written by the author. This part would be helpful to someone who isn't familiar with Austen's life, but wouldn't be particularly new to anyone who's read a biography of her. Additionally, there were several critical analyses of Pride and Prejudice, both contemporary and modern. I enjoyed most of these--though I admit I got bored with the Freudian one and moved on to the next. The piece I found most surprising was the interview with Colin Firth. I really didn't think that this interview belonged in a critical edition of P&P and wasn't expecting much from it. But I was very wrong. Colin Firth had a strong understanding of Darcy's character (of course! how could I doubt? It IS his job!). It was fascinating to read his thoughts about how he incorporated his understanding of Darcy's motivations in the most powerful scenes (such as the first ball, the drawing room discussion when Lizzy was at Netherfield, the dance at Netherfield, and the proposal). It gave me a completely new impression of Darcy's character and made me want to watch the whole miniseries again.<br /><br />I found the excerpt by Marilyn Butler Jane Austen and the War of Ideas: Pride and Prejudice, quite helpful...I feel encouraged to read Butler's entire book (after I finish re-reading the rest of Austen's novels). In this excerpt, Butler shows how Darcy and Elizabeth have elements of both pride and prejudice in their personalities. I had always thought about Darcy being proud and Elizabeth being prejudiced...but now I see that it is not that simple. Darcy was proud of his lineage and wealth, and he was prejudiced against people who had less wealth and less sophistication than himself. Elizabeth was prejudiced against Darcy because of his initial bad impression, but she was too proud to allow for the possibility that she might be mistaken in her first impressions.).

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Given the loyal \\"cult\\" following that this series so readily generated, the programming geniuses at FOX must be wondering if maybe they should cut back on the 3-martini lunches.  Don't they do audience followups any more?  Do they just use a dartboard to determine what airs when and for how long?  I'd rant some more, but others have said it better.  Fun series.  Fun fun fun.  Clever and fun.  And the movie was a great followup.  When are we gonna see Serenity II?  Please, Joss, may we have some more?
B0038M2AZA|5.0|I've loaned this DVD to countless friends, some with kids and some without.  All, without exception, have loved this film.  And I got the most wonderful feedback... This is one of those well-crafted docudramas that opens hearts without a hint of sentimentality.  It's an ambassadorial movie for the neuro-atypical.  Beautifully acted.  If you think you don't know anyone within the autism spectrum, watch this film and you'll realize that you do.  Temple (and her mother, too, come to think about it) is one of my heroes, and she'll be one of yours, too.  This is NOT a chick-flick or a sappy girl-makes-good story.  If you're the kind of person who appreciates taking a walk in another's shoes, I promise you'll connect with it.  Danes won a well-deserved Emmy for this.
0375507256|4.0|Read it people. It starts off slow (to me at least, I'm a pretty slow person), but it's very good. Can't wait to see the movie.
B00009P1O2|5.0|Great DVD. A must-own for every Queen fan. I'm slightly ashamed to admit I did not already own it. Production quality, especially sound, is great, just ask my neighbors...
1423140605|5.0|This book arrived quickly and is an amazing read! No problems with shipping and arrived in good condition. Amazing addition to my collection of the Heroes of Olympus series.
1469984202|3.0|I finished reading this book within 5 days of getting it. I have waited another week for it all to sink in. While I heard lots of praise for this book and I can appreciate an author who self published and became successful I don't think the book deserves such high accolades. To me I would consider this a freshman work of literature.<br /><br />Possible spoilers (I'm not telling exactly what happens in the story but I am describing parts of it on a literary level)<br /><br />Characters:<br />While their are a handful of characters in this book none of them struck me as stand out. We have one character that's description reminds me of the bartender from The boondock saints (gerard parks) (doc from fraggle rock) as an electronics geek. The rest of them really didn't give me a strong enough identity to say I could see this person or that person in that role or even identify with them. Maybe it is because of who becomes the central character later on that ruins it for me. Considering Sci-Fi is generaly a male dominated genre I think the focus of the main character later on may draw in that crowd but alienates that crowd later on as the reader may not be able to identify with certain emotions or reasoning.<br /><br />Story itself:<br />It's not something orignal in my opinion. We have a civilization living in a silo cut off from the outside world. Everyone has jobs to do. But yet something strange is going on. Reality is not what it appears to be. To me this is not a new idea. If I were to compare it to something previously done it is the baseline story of the movie The Matrix only in a silo minus the advanced AI taking over everything. The concept at it's core is the same an imposed order/world upon people that know no better and are ignorant to it.<br /><br />The actual plot:<br />It never seems like the actual reason for everything is spelled out. It is danced around and played with but it becomes a because someone made it this way with no further explanation really. No explanation how the one group of people came to power out of all others. so to me this has holes in it.<br /><br />Overall I believe it was OK, I don't hate it but I am certainly not overly impressed or enthusiastic about it. I may recommend it to someone who has never read the Sci Fi genre especially a female but otherwise I probably would not.

B003K15IF8|5.0|And this guy never won a pulitzer for this book because...........????????<br /><br />This is by far the best book I have read since I read Olive Kittridge by Elizabeth Stroud a couple of years ago and Lets Pretend This Never Happened by Jenny Lawson<br /><br />The simplicity regarding the tone of the book and the characters is amazing.  Its not exactly this heart thubbing, gotta turn the page kinda book.  It is a book though of integrity and heartfelt mindfulness regarding choices and their consequences and gracefullness of acceptance.  It sounds horribly like your basic Life Time or Hallmark movie or a tired lliterary cliche but its not.  The book and the characters are sad and dignified at the same time.<br /><br />If you have to make a decision between a couple of lattes at Starbucks or buying and reading this book - buy the book.  It will be wroth your while.  And yes, when people ask you what you are reading and your reply is &#34;Stoner&#34; you will get the raised eyebrows with the assumption you are reading something about drugs but here is your chance to grab a teachable moment and get another person to read this lovely, lovely book.
B0000AM6IY|5.0|G C G#, B C Bb... Just a little musical introduction, an overture if you will.<br /><br />Everybody that considers themselves a fan of Broadway Musicals has a favorite. Mine is West Side Story. I never saw it on Broadway, but I have seen many productions of it. I have even played in the pit band for some of those productions. Seldom, if ever is a film version of a Broadway musical as good as the stage production. This film is no exception. It is better!<br /><br />This Amazon package is a no frills deal. Basically just a copy of the one-sheet on the cover and the DVD. But that's all you need. Everything else is on the DVD. Once the opening eight bars have played and you hear your first finger snap, you are there, in the neighborhood, down the block, on the street.<br /><br />When the DVD arrived, two days earlier than Amazon had predicted, I was chomping at the bit because I would finally have a copy of this show that I could jump around in and replay things without ruining the media. After having sat through the DVD a few times since it arrived, I have found that I do not jump around or replay only sections of it. But I do use pause a lot so that I can compose myself now and then. For example, it takes me a few pauses to make it through \\"A Boy Like That.\\"<br /><br />I don't care if you are a Shark, a Jet, a cop or soda jerk. I don't care if you love it for the music, the dance or just the beautiful people in the cast, you are going to love this simple presentation of what I consider one of the finest pieces of American art ever created. And, while \\"I have no mind, I'm the village idiot,\\" I know I am right about that.
B008PALI5S|4.0|While this is not the last word on Mahler 8, it provides some unique thrills.  I will gladly exchange the softest pianissimos for the fullness, warmth and richness of the choral sound.  Although most of the choristers are young, they achieve a very fine blend.  I would cavil, though, at their German pronunciation, which seems mushy and pasted-on (compare Solti's German-speaking choruses).  A counter-example to hand is the solo tenor, who copes as well as anyone with his fiendishly high part, putting the words across with flair and accuracy.  The soloists overall are just under the top rank, with the &#34;Gretchen&#34; a standout, her tone silver coated with velvet.  While I am not a member of the Dudamel &#34;cult&#34;, I do find that most of his interpretations sound newly-minted.  He gets from his conjoined orchestras the same committed and beautiful playing as on his recent &#34;Eroica&#34;.  Dudamel often captures the true Mahler sound.  Part One ends with an enormous rush of elation, and he brings Part Two to a satisfying conclusion.  There are places which could have relaxed more, but on the whole the Solti-like fast tempos help hold the work together. Although the organ is barely audible, the sound is otherwise quite good, and the camera work is fine.  There is an inoffensive &#34;behind the scenes&#34; documentary included.  This DVD should give much pleasure.
B006T3RM08|4.0|I was hesitant about purchasing this product, after reading some of the reviews below.  Boy, am I glad I didn't listen to the negatives.<br /><br />I had ZERO problems installing my iMac keyboard and Apple Bluetooth Trackpad.  They fit just how they are \\"supposed\\" to fit, and everything is working perfectly.  In fact, I am typing this review from it now.<br /><br />No trackpad issues either.  I don't use the \\"push to click\\" trackpad feature too much, as I prefer the \\"tap to click\\" function, but even so, the click is working fine.<br /><br />Neat product, and it does what I want and needed it to do.<br /><br />If you have a need for something like this, I would recommend it.  Just take your time, and be careful when inserting the keyboard and trackpad.  Make sure they are fully inserted, and that they \\"click\\" into place.<br /><br />Unlike a previous review, there was absolutely NO Dremmel required!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This has to be the absolute BEST action movie EVER made. I am presently having a surround system installed and cannot wait to watch it again. I was fortunate to have seen it in IMAX 3D the first time but owning it will be at least a monthly watch! Came in the mail quickly as promised.
1451695195|2.0|I must echo a couple of the other negative reviews of this book.  I won't be too critical of the title, because I'm going to assume that was foisted on him by the publisher, a common practice in order to sell books -- make the title as intriguing as possible.  Of course, I knew it wouldn't be \\"proof\\", but I didn't really find the book that interesting.  As another reviewer wrote, most of the book was about his and his family's journey through his illness.  There's not a lot about his near-death-experience.  And that is what is so disappointing about this book.
B008KRJWEK|5.0|I love this game it is so fun I am addicted to it I wish the roadkill wouldn't jump on your car its so no fair when they jump on your car I also wish they would make it more apocalyptic looking its so boring looking besides that I love it
B005LAIHSG|1.0|This showed up when I searched for DVDs. The package says DVD and Blue Ray, but all that I got was the Blue Ray. I do not have a Blue Ray player so it was just a waste of money and I will never do that again.
B00607EWYC|3.0|I saw Paul Harding at a book talk/book signing at my college last month.  I had not yet read Harding's novel, Tinkers. Harding, however, was a fantastic speaker and had a great personality- I was instantly ready to jump into the text.  Interestingly, when I did buy it on my Kindle (for 5 bucks!) I was disappointed because I soon realized that the segments which he read were basically the only engaging parts of the novel for me.  The writing style-though full of vivid imagery-helps readers zone-out at times.  I am interested in reading his next novel, Enon, after its release in 2013.<br /><br />Brian, senior English major, Virginia liberal arts college

B008RJ6TTC|5.0|This set of Columbo is wonderful I was really surprised at the Quality of the episodes we have viewed.  Could not be happier and look forward to completing the entire series.  We have seen all before but can never get enough of this outstanding program.  I was going to order the individual seasons on DVD since the VHS we had was getting old and most had commercials.  I was willing to wait for this truly complete package and am convinced I made the right decision.<br /><br />If you are a Columbo Fan this is a Must Have.  As I said the quality is outstanding!<br /><br />We have been long time fans of Columbo and had most episodes on VHS from The Original Showing. We now have a complete set of this Great Show.<br /><br />Thanks to Amazon for this Treasure.

B002S0OBN2|5.0|ALW has done it again!  Another great musical and follow-up to Phantom.  I wasn't sure I was going to like the songs at first but the more I listened to them the more I liked them especially the title song.  Every time I hear it the goosebumps and tears come.  I wish \\"Love Never Dies\\" would come to the United States.

B007KZY1YY|2.0|I loved reading the first book of the trilogy but the second it seems like there's nothing else to add to the story, only a few details, but not enticing or long lasting one's.<br />I am only in the middle of it and up to now It didn't happen any major event in the book.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I already had watched all the Walking Dead seasons on Dish Network, but they took amc off there network so i had to order it from amozon. Dish has got the station back now, but if they never put it back on i would have kept buying them .<br />Walking Dead is a great show that has a good story line and great suspence,that keeps you on your toes. I just love the show, and it leaves me anxous for the next epasoide.Walking Dead season 3 is awesome !!!!!!! Thank you for having a way for me to watch it when i could'nt.
B007SZ0E1K|1.0|I place my order October 27, 2012 and received an email telling me to expect the shipment 10/31/2012. I have been trying to find shipping info since Monday am. 10/29/2012. Keep saying package was being packaged to be shipped. Spoke with Preethi, via chat. He or she was very helpful. Found that the two items had not been shipped but were going out late today, 10/30/2012 so they would not arrive even with my Prime membership on 10/31/2012 as their site states or as they stated in their email of 10/27/2012 to confirm my purchase.<br /><br />This Intel CPU would have been great as my last one was. Great CPU fast, can over clock without a great amount of heat. My standard case fans keep up well with my old system. The motherboard quit so I, in this order bought a motherboard and new CPU as I saw some possible problems under the CPU as I was taking the system apart. I was so pleased by the Intel Core i5-3570K Quad-Core Processor that I am staying with it..<br /><br />Great products. Amazon this time not so great !!!!

1451650728|5.0|WARNING: MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS. AND BY \\"MAY\\" I MEAN \\"DOES.\\"<br /><br />PROLOGUE:<br />I have reviewed any number of Trek books in the last year. Most of what we've seen from the Typhon Pact series has been hit or miss, with the notable exceptions of \\"Plagues of Night\\" and \\"Raise the Dawn\\" which are quite possibly two of my favorite Trek books. This is definitely in the \\"exceptional\\" category. And I will say that the Cold Equations books are going to shatter the TNG world as we know it. David Mack was charged with the responsibility of shaking the world to pieces several years ago with Destiny, and so he has been given that same honor once more.<br /><br />This is the beginning end of Star Trek: The Next Generation.<br /><br />-------------------------------<br /><br />*ALL* THE CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT!<br /><br />The book is divided into three parts, the first and last of which take place in the \\"standard\\" timeline, or in early 2384, while the second part covers a wide swath of almost two decades. Because I picked this up at Barnes and Noble a few days ago (God bless them for shelving them early), I won't go into too much detail. Much of the story focuses around Geordi, Worf, and Jasminder Choudhury. We get tons upon tons of character development for these characters. We also see a fair deal more of the Picard family, the ongoing struggles of raising a child on a starship (and on the flagship, no less). From what I can tell, this trilogy is going to be as heartbreaking as \\"Destiny,\\" and as character-focused as the \\"A Time to...\\" books. How these will be combined is anyone's guess, but I'm already feeling the gut-wrenching pull of time until Silent Weapons comes out in a month. SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!<br /><br />On top of the story and the characters, the sheer WRITING of this is astounding. Whenever I write, I try to hold David Mack as an example. Whenever a character enters the room, he makes you feel their present. Whenever he describes a food, I feel like I can taste it. There are such tiny details in every paragraph that drip with minutiae, emotion, and perfection. Mack draws you into his writing and makes you feel as though you are actually there in the room. There have actually been times when I am able to close my eyes, and I could swear on my life that I had seen that episode before, despite the fact that it was only ever a book.<br /><br />-----------------------------------<br /><br />TO OBTAIN, SOMETHING OF EQUAL VALUE MUST BE LOST. THAT IS THE FIRST RULE OF EQUIVALENT EXCHANGE:<br /><br />Oh, by the way, this is where the spoilers are.<br /><br />Spoilers! Stop reading...<br /><br />Why are you still reading?!<br /><br />Okay, fine. You know what? Go ahead. Read. I don't care.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, this book still gets 5 stars for a host of reasons, but there ARE a few things that irritate me. As a lifelong Trek fan, nitpicking the finer points of literature and media is kind of a hobby. First off, let's start with Data. Or B4. Or Soong. Or whatever the frak you want to call him. I give up... The entire book wreaks of \\"OMG! Data's coming back!\\" just as \\"The Eternal Tide\\" did with Janeway. Again, though, I don't care. It is incredibly obvious to anyone who reads the first hundred pages that we are going to see Data again. And guess what? You're right! Sort of. It's... complicated. We'll see more of the awkward-but-good-to-be-back-ness that we'll undoubtedly see with Voyager and Co. in the coming years.<br /><br />And now onto Tasha Yar 2.0. In Q&A, Q says to Picard something along the lines of \\"Jean-Luc, you go through more security chiefs than Kathy does hairstyles.\\" I don't remember the exact quote, and the book is with a friend, so I can't look it up, but we do see a very unfortunate death that was just... awful. As Worf says, it was without honor. It was just pure evil. Why do the editors and authors feel the need to kill off the Enterprise's security personnel with absolutely no sense of heroism? She deserved more than that. This alone almost bumped it down to a 4/5, but I'm more grown than that and can see the forest and not just the trees.<br /><br />-------------------<br /><br />OVERALL:<br /><br />This is it, people. I feel like I know the overall gist of what's going to happen: Picard is going to retire, Data is going to take over the Enterprise, and Romulus is going to kerplode in what is possibly the worst explanation for a supernova ever. Really? It hit a planet and that made the shockwave go to warp? THAT'S your excuse, JJ? Anyway... that's another review for another time.<br /><br />The focus is now off interspecies relationships with the Pact, now focusing more on the individual characters and crews.<br /><br />Persistence of Memory is the first part of what is going to be a very emotional series. By the end of it, we are all going to hate and love David Mack even more.<br /><br />And the sky's the limit.
B009YDAUJ0|5.0|So, an entire episode without the main group... does it work? Yes! Let's face it, Rick's group isn't the only one out there and we're introduced to the citizens of Woodbury through Michonne and Andrea's perspective. This episode is not quite as fast-paced as the previous two this season. It certainly does a good job of setting up what we can expect from Woodbury though. The Governor makes his first appearance and we get a glimpse of the craziness he hides beneath a charismatic exterior. Michonne continues to prove that she doesn't carry that katana just for show. Andrea's naivete allows the story to unfold and shows us how manipulative the Governor can be. We also learn a little bit about zombie behavior when placed on a restrictive diet. Plus we see an old character return!

B002PCHGOY|5.0|The Polar Express(released Oct/04)stars the voice talents of Tom Hanks,taking on a myriad of roles from train conductor to Santa himself.<br />The film is about a young boy in Grand Rapids,Michigan,who is just on the cusp of growing out of his belief in Santa and Christmas.One Christmas eve,while lying restlessly in his bed,a huge old multi-car train pulls up in front of his house.He walks out into the snowy night and up to the locomotive,just as a conductor farther back yells \\"all aboard\\".He is at first reluctant to get on the train but decides,as it pulls away,to take a chance.What happens from there leads him and a train car of other children(about a dozen in all),on an adventure that will change their lives forever.It is a journey of self discovery and realization and the true meaning of Christmas.<br />The train ride takes up a good portion of the film when we finally arrive at Santa's village,about 50 minutes into the film.This is a village like no other you have seen before.It is more like an old town and it is filled to the brim with elves and their elaborate working areas.The young boy makes close friends with another girl and a younger boy and together they end up in the town square just before midnight and are witnesses to a pageantry like no other you will have seen.The boy finally comes to recapture his belief in Christmas,and given that Christmas's very first gift by the man himself.All good things of course must come to an end and off they return home,but none ever the same again.<br />There are so many neat moments/people in this picture,such as the conductor,the ghost who rides the top of the train,the engineer and fireman,the roller coaster ride just before Flattop tunnel,the skidding of the train over the frozen lake,Santa's village,the precarious placing of Santa's bag onto his sleigh,the pageantry before his departure,and so much more.It is all a fantastical and beautifully animated Christmas film that will warm your hearts on a cold winter night.<br />This DVD comes in a light metal container in which is the DVD in a regular case.It is in a w/s format.<br />This is a film for children of all ages.It is a modern classic,and you will NOT hear me saying that too often.Highly recommended.t.<br />This DVD comes in a light metal container in which is the DVD in a regular case.It is in a w/s format.<br />This is a film for children of all ages.It is a modern classic,and you will NOT hear me saying that too often.Highly recommended.
B007V65R54|3.0|Chapters are very interesting (hurricanes, climate, diseases). But, I think the author does not mention \\"bayes theory\\" enough for the reader. Ok, there are some pages about his \\"reasoning\\", but I have felt \\"what is the point he likes to emphisize?\\".<br /><br />In this kind of books, my favorite one is \\"Fooled by randomness\\", by Nassim Taleb.

B008EZVNFE|5.0|After insisting that my friend open her ears to the sounds of Ms. La Havas, she agreed that this is a case of mistaken identity. I am Lianne. From the song subject, down to the quirky style.<br />Her music is soulful, playful, and FULL of emotion. But not it a weepy, poor me way. Her feelings come across in her voice, which can be deep and rich or light and airy. She makes you think you are running around in London falling in love. Not the same as falling in love in Paris, that's too cinematic.<br />In the same way that she whisks you away, she stares in your face with songs like Everything, Everything. If it were a movie one lover would confront the other and declare with all certainty \\"There's nothing to say, you're eyes said it all...\\" and the other would just sit there agreeing by their silence.<br /><br />How often do we get to hear a great voice, real lyrics, and music that inspires a mischievous smile? That up to something grin belongs to none other than Lianne La Havas... and that would be me.
B005QUQP76|4.0|This is one of THE most solid and stable computer peripherals I've ever purchased. And it's not just the aluminum chassis that makes this mouse solid, but the tactile feel as well - the buttons and the scrollwheel are the best I've used. It has a great weight to it (adjustable I might add) and glides effortlessly over every surface I've tried it on.<br /><br />My only qualm at the moment is some minor issues with the software and the programability of the buttons. Other than that, however, this is a most excellent gaming mouse.
B002Q8Z8KG|5.0|My wife and I loved the show, it was hilarious and pretty clean! However, the first time we tried to watch it the server wouldn't connect, so we waited a few days and then the video image was grainy on full screen. The image quality improved when the pop-out was used but then the sound was lagging the video for the entire episode. We'll be going elsewhere to watch our instant shows/movies.
0316228532|1.0|To sum up, I read the Harry Potter series before deciding to buy this book. If JK Rowling had published this book before the HP series and I had read it first, nothing would have convinced me to purchase and read the HP series subsequently because I would have been quite convinced that it would be horrible.<br /><br />  A lot of reviewers say that this book is meant for adults as compared to the HP series which is meant for the young adult market etc. If that is true, then I would feel very sorry for those who make the transition into reading \\"adult\\" fare. A bit of foul language and a setting of doom and gloom is hardly something which immediately qualifies a book as one meant for \\"adults\\" and excuses a boring, insipid book. The Harry Potter series whether it was meant for adults or kids were vibrant books filled with tongue in cheek humor and excitement. The Causal Vacancy on the other hand is a load of trash which wouldn't have merited a place on any bookshelf if the name of J.K.Rowling was not associated with it.

0062127241|3.0|Townshend's foray into rock-and-roll nostalgia will satisfy any hardcore Who fan that owns a dozen versions of My Generation.  But it isn't particularly good literature or art. It is a clichéd and rambling narrative of awkward eroticism, adolescent angst, self loathing and false modesty. If Pete's goal was to expose his soul to the world, then perhaps he succeeded.  But there is such a thing as \\"too much information\\", especially when applied to the superfluous or disingenuous. The art in biography is knowing when and where to cut the fat. Simply put, this book could have used a good editor.<br /><br />Why was I expecting more?  Was it because I believed the hype, spread thick over the years, that Townshend is rock's elder statesman?  No, I never bought into that.  Being \\"inscrutable and vague\\" doesn't make one a thinker; being engaged and insightful does. I've never found Pete to be terribly insightful.<br /><br />I was expecting more because Townshend has always been one of the rare superstars that seems fully immersed in the artistic process. Art matters to him.  Unfortunately, his love for the craft simply doesn't appear in the pages of this book. Furthermore, even as a standard rock biography, it is a dull and choppy read.  Nowhere near the quality of Fletcher's biography of Keith Moon.<br /><br />But, perhaps the fault lies with me.  I was looking to be reassured that the art of my youth was somehow special.  Certainly more meaningful and relevant than today's pop status of Snooky, Green Day, or Twilight. But Pete's book is a reminder that artists are simply children, possessing a child's view of the world. Groupie sex, whimsical drug use, and petty jealousies comprise the passions that drive Pete to create his art. To expect him to \\"be above all that\\" is simply naive.<br /><br />There's an old expression that all heroes become bores, eventually. For me, this book simply hastened the process.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|After reading reviews about force closing I was aprehensive about downloading. This has been one of my favorite games in such a long time. By no means is it easy, but its self explanatory. I like the fact that its not the same repeating map over and over, Im not sure what the value of other charecters is if any but its a blast and I cant put it down. I also enjoy challenging my FB friends and it updats live in the game so you see their live score all the time.

B002U5HKZ6|5.0|This book was recommended to me by some friends, and I had to call and say &#34;thank you&#34; after I finished it because I enjoyed it so much.  It is a long read and tells a long, wonderful story with beautifully written characters.  I like lots of books but a truly good one is one that makes me laugh out loud, smile as I read it, or sob over some parts.  This one did all three.  I would especially recommend it to someone who likes to travel.

B009GQ57ES|5.0|I love all the songs on this album. They cover such a wide variety of topics and exhibit much more thought than any mainstream effort. Macklemore has been making quality music for a while and it is about time he got the attention he deserves. The album most definitely does not disappoint. His brutal honesty about his own life, thoughts, and struggles really strike a chord. No pretenses here, just good good music delivered with skill.<br /><br />Just make sure you realize there is an [Explicit] version. This threw me at first, since many albums sell the explicit by default and label the censored version as [clean].

Recorded in a reverberant acoustic (just listen to K 459 & K 595), it is all very pleasant, thoughtful and somewhat dainty on occasions. I cannot think of a single interpretation here that expanded my knowledge - it's Via Media all the way. A great Mozart interpreter will reach out and grab one by the maracas; Schiff is far too polite to do so.  For instance, check out K 449, one of Mozart's greatest creations; it's always a litmus test in my eyes. Here, it's so mild-mannered, it might as well be Clark Kent at the keyboard.

0553386794|4.0|This book tells a very big story, with many major characters. Each chapter is told from the point of view of a particular character, and the chapters cycle through each of the major characters (in whatever order is needed to advance the story). The whole story is epic in nature, with a lot happening on a grand scale. Each chapter ends with a hook to get you to continue reading - very much like a soap opera. If you are like me, you will find yourself absorbed in this novel.<br /><br />The author is very good at conveying scenery, and a great ability with battle scenes. The only detraction for me is the limited growth of the characters - some of the major characters are one-dimensional. Their actions are driven by their sense of honor or out of duty to a king/queen. That's not to say that the characters are completely simple, it's just that most don't deviate much from their main purpose. However, each chapter does give you a good glimpse of what each character is thinking, so maybe I'd say that most characters are one-and-a-half dimensional. To me, this is the only problem with the book, aside from the fact that I don't want to continue reading this series (I'm simply okay with how everything worked out in this book, loose ends and all, and I don't have the energy to continue the story).<br /><br />The story...<br /><br />The book centers around the family of Ned Stark, who live in a fictional north known as Winterfell. The entire landscape of interest in the book is completely fictional, but there is a map of the relevant places in the front of the book. The time period would seem to be in the middle ages, but that's not exact since the novel tries to exist in a reality different from earth, or at least a fantasy rendering of King Arthur. Also, the winters and the summers can last for any duration of time, even lifetimes.<br /><br />Within this landscape, many characters are introduced and the novel has chapters devoted to the point of view of each of the major characters. In Winterfell, you have Ned Stark being proclaimed \\"hand of the king\\" who has the duty of protecting the king and kingdom from both enemies and the king himself. It turns out that there is a great deal of treachery involved in the king's world, and Ned unhappily tries to deal with it all, and protect his king (seemingly the only one of the king's many men who actually cares for the king's and kingdom's well-being).<br /><br />Ned's wife Catelyn gets several chapters to her point of view, as well as his children Sansa, Arya, Bran, Robb, and his bastard son Jon.<br /><br />The novel is not just told in the eyes of the Stark family. For example, a brother/sister duo who hail from a previous monarchy are presented and their story is told in detail. In fact, this story concludes with huge implications for the sequels.<br /><br />Of great help is a map of the whole region in the front of the book, and an appendix at the back that lists all of the houses of interest and their genealogies.<br /><br />...<br /><br />The writing, as mentioned above, is pretty good and there were plenty of times when I read longer into the night than expected.<br /><br />I give this book 4 stars for its ambition and storytelling - very good indeed. I subtract a star for the less than multi-dimensional characters, and the fact that I really don't want to read another book in the series (I just think that I'm not a series reader, although I did one series only to be duped into thinking I read all the books in that one series, and there were still more books to be read). As far as I know, there are four books in this series, each around 1000 pages, and I'm too slow of a reader to go through them all - but I would if I felt more compelled to do so.<br /><br />Personally, I was satisfied with the ending of this book, even though several characters have unfinished business. And the final chapters end with surprises that the reader didn't see coming, but nonetheless are completely consistentwith the book - that is, they are not just surprises to keep things interesting, but they are well-thought out, and certainly reasonable in the context of this book.<br /><br />I liked the 2 or so months I spent with this book, but I am glad to be moving on to other books.with the book - that is, they are not just surprises to keep things interesting, but they are well-thought out, and certainly reasonable in the context of this book.<br /><br />I liked the 2 or so months I spent with this book, but I am glad to be moving on to other books.

B0095T3H2U|4.0|The movie was what I had expected it, especially with the lead actor being Jason Segal.  It was a very entertaining and funny movie, I would recommend watching it!
B003Q6D2B4|3.0|Robert Schwentke's \\"Red\\" has what can only be called a dream cast--Bruce Willis, Helen Mirren, Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, Ernest Borgnine, Brian Cox, Richard Dreyfuss, Mary-Louise Parker, Karl Urban and James Remar. I just wish the script gave them better things to do. The idea of retired CIA operatives forced back into action is fun, if not exactly fresh. But though it's great fun to see Helen Mirren brandishing an AK-47 with at least as much aplomb as Sly Stallone, the script is awful. The story is made up of spare parts from other comic-action capers, and doesn't make sense half the time. The editing is so bad that I had to double-check that the director wasn't Michael Bay. It's only because I love all these actors that I give \\"Red\\" three stars; without them, I would give it two at the most. (But without them, I would never have bothered to see this movie.)<br /><br />(NOTE: Brian Cox starred in another, much better film also titled \\"Red.\\" It's a thriller about a grizzled Vietnam vet who takes revenge against the teenage punks who killed his dog. That's the movie named \\"Red\\" that you should see.)

1451695195|4.0|I bought this book after reading an excerpt online. It was well written and compelling, but I felt as if there wasn't quite enough material for a full book, even one as slim as this, so there were places where it seemed padded, as if the author (or his editor) was looking for ways to make it longer. In particular, I felt this way about the chapter, late in the book, where he went into how \\"scientific\\" the notion of consciousness is.<br /><br />I've seen the 20/20 and Nightline segments on Dr. Alexander, and I think you can get most of the gist of his experience from that, though the book goes into more detail about his medical condition and certainly his background and his near-death experience as well.<br /><br />Still, it's a good addition to the literature on life after death if you're interested in the subject and a fast read.

B00127RAJY|4.0|I felt like I was in better shape after moving through each level of the DVD.  Level 2 was definetly the hardest.  Probably because it was a big jump from level 1.  BUT despite how much the DVD made me sweat I did not lose any weight.  I think that if you are in ok shape when you start this you shouldn't expect to lose 20 lbs in 30 days.  I feel more in shape but 20 minutes a day was enough to get me sweaty and out of breath, but not burn as many calories as I would running for 20 minutes...I'll try doing one level after the other and see if I get results.

0316228532|5.0|I loved this book! I actually read aloud several sections of the book to co-workers because the writing was so good. Every word was perfect and it was a joy to read. Now with that said, about 100 pages in I thought I would need to draw out family trees to keep all of the characters straight both as to who they were and how they fit into the larger story. As I continued reading, I figured it all out and actually thought that if I were a newcomer to Pagford that is exactly how I would have felt anyway.<br /><br />I thought the fact that the smallest storylines continued throughout -- the computer in the stream causing injury comes to mind -- was excellent and brought some humor to the more tension filled sections of the book. The characters are so well developed, and even though I could easily identify many of the characteristics in people I know, they did not come across as canned or cardboard like.<br /><br />With all of that said, if you cannot stomach foul language or are looking for an adult version of Harry Potter then you probably won't enjoy this book. If you can look past that, you will not be disappointed!

B000QCS8TW|4.0|I've never read much of this genre (aside from The Hobbit, and that was years ago), but I picked up this book on the recommendation of a friend (and the rave reviews of the HBO series didn't hurt either). I'm about 30 pages away from finishing this book and am looking forward to the second in the series! Martin is a great writer--the flow, syntax, and dialogue make for smooth reading and the world he has created feels \\"real\\". While others find the jumping of POVs to be distracting, I enjoyed the way Martin used it to keep the reader interested. Want to find out more about a particular event from a certain character? Read 100 more pages. The character development is decent, although it might be better without the POV-jumping. For a non-studious read though, I think it's sufficient. As a reader who doesn't venture into the world of fantasy much, this is a book that isn't overly saturated with a world of magic and mythical creatures--that made it a better read for me, personally. I recommend this book for regular readers, but not for those who read only occasionally. With each chapter being related by a different character, it could be hard to keep up with the plot if the book is only picked up once a week.<br /><br />Just a side note--there have been a lot of bad reviews for the Kindle version of this book. Editing issues seem to have been fixed, as my version was fine!
B007N8RULO|4.0|Great way to kill time! Love this game. It is easy to set up.but can be very challenging<br />Thanks for making it available. So much easier to see than on my phone
030758836X|3.0|.....if they are also characters in a Gillian Flynn novel.  That is the pattern I see after reading all three of her novels.   This book kept me interested through the end, and as a mystery &#34;how is it going to end?&#34; it was a gripping page turner for the most part.  However, though well written, the story is slightly too clever for its own good, and the ending feels anticlimactic and unsettled.  The premise and structure are interesting, the two main characters well-developed though sometimes falling into cliche'd types  (jaded privileged hipsters).  The two protagonists are, as many reviewers have pointed out, fairly unlikeable.  Though characters do not necessarily have to be likable for a novel to work, it would have helped in this case in my opinion.  Mild Spoiler Alert:  The book has a lot of twists, and part of the fun of the novel is trying to predict which way it will twist next.  It does get you thinking about leads the police should have taken in the investigation (it seems like they missed a couple things they could have checked, but was fairly well done).  The bitterness and acrimony between Nick and Amy is well-drawn.  Anyone who has been in a contentious long-term relationship will find some identification with the feelings of the two main characters (but hopefully will not go to the same lengths!).  Anyway, worth reading due to good writing and structure, but it doesn't leave you with a sense of closure for the characters and the story.

B009CVELHG|5.0|I bought \\"Grand Hotel\\" for the sole purpose of being an ardent Joan Crawford fan.<br /><br /> Winner of the 1932 Academy-Award for Best Picture the movie is a who's who of 1930's cinema including Crawford, Greta Garbo, Lionel Barrymore, Wallace Beery and so many others. The plot centers on a variety of colorful characters taking residence in a huge and beautiful hotel in Berlin, the problems the face and the ultimate outcome of their lives.<br /><br /> \\"Grand Hotel\\" has been selected as one of those rare films to be preserved by the National Film Registry for preserving and is still highly regarded as one of the greatest movies of all-time.<br /><br /> The film makes its debut on Blu Ray on January 8th, 2012 and is in widescreen format, contains all the special features that were on the DVD release including footage of the Hollywood premiere, a wonderful and informatibe documentary on the making of \\"Grand Hotel\\" called \\"Checking Out: Grand Hotel\\" and trailers.<br /><br /> Commenting many years later Joan Crawford had only wonderful things to say about the film (it was the only movie in her whole career to ever win the Oscar for Best Picture), but she stated she was heart sick that she didn't have any scenes with Garbo (her idol). According to Joan on the set one day Greta Garbo went up to Crawford, grabbed her by the face and said, \\"You have such a lovely face my daarling...it is too bad we have no scenes together\\" in her beautiful accent. Joan stated, \\"If there ever was a time I could have been a lesbian it was at that moment!\\".

B009GEBBNQ|5.0|We loved this movie so much, we watched it two days in a row.  There is some really great dialogue and of course the special effects are spectacular.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Easy to load and fun to use. The tiles are large enough to use on horizontal and vertical view. It is also easy to track your score and change levels.
B009KHBDUU|4.0|A funny movie that is almost over the top comical. A good scary comedy if you like that kind of movie.
B008602KQI|5.0|I really enjoy the HD quality of my Kindle Fire. As the streaming quality is not quite stabilized yet, I like to download / buy my favorite films when it's worth it. Hunger Games is definitely one of those films that I'd like to view over and over. I'm amazed at the relevance and quality of the selection that the Kindle Fire offers. The films are new and ecclectic, differ from the Netflix offerings and I appreciate their innovation of also opting films still in cinemas available for home viewing.<br /><br />Hunger Games is a film that is full of heart, defiance against Big Brother, and full of surprising turns. It is one of the most innovative film adaptations from a book that treads that line of major motion picture with eye catching CGI, but also keeps good characters and actors challenged.<br /><br />Also, I am addicted to the X-Ray layer while watching. I appreciate the seamless way of referencing the work directly without having to open another browser or stop my film. It's a great way to use a tablet, the touch screen, as well as allow control over when it comes on when I want it.<br /><br />The cost of renting a film is a bit costly, when in comparison with a subscription... so I'm taking advantage of my Prime membership that comes with the Kindle Fire. Maybe Amazon can bring the cost down once more folks buy these!
B005P3NPXG|5.0|As soon as I opened it up and put it in the Bose, we were hooked.<br />\\"EVERY\\" song is fabulous.  We play it every day.  Wow...Seal...
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game is awsome its totally one of my favorites and you get it the game will be your favorite game too
B0086700CM|5.0|temple run is super fun and really simple its even none of the best game i've ever played I just couldn't put it down
B0095R76EW|1.0|I tried watching this through the Amazon Instant Video app on my TiVo, but the movie never downloaded. I can't find the rental in my recent transactions either. I'd like to watch what I paid for.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|Going into this movie, I wanted to love it.  I truly did.  I was excited when the credits began, and as the movie progressed, the excitement waned.  I know a lot of people hated this movie, and conversely, a lot of people loved it.  I'm in the \\"meh\\" category.  It had so much promise, but it left it all in the trailers.<br />I don't care that it wasn't a direct prequel to Alien.  I don't care that it left the ending wide open for a sequel.  I do care that the story and characters were never fleshed out to the point where I was invested in what happened to them.<br />There were several points where the movie showed flashes of brilliance, only to then to fall back into the convoluted mess that it was.<br /><br />Watching this movie is like going on a blind date.  You're glad you experienced it, but you're more glad that it's over, and you can just move on.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|How can the developers ignore the fact that Kindle Fire users can't connect with their facebook accounts?  I won't waste my time playing as a guest when I have spent too much time leveling up on the computer already.  Also, having played it at all, I don't appreciate how limited the mobile version is.  I would like my daily spins and friend lists, and the ability to send and recieve gifts...just saying.<br /><br />UPDATE<br /><br />I really appreciate the fact that the developers took the time to fix all of my issues.
B006OAB3ME|4.0|McCartney is brilliant and a true muscian.  At our house, Sunday dinner is in the dining room with the good china and music.  A better selection than this would be difficult to imagine.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This is the first time I have bothered to review an app. I got this as faotd but it is worth the full five dollars. It is fun and just the right amount of challenging with high replay value.
B008J34466|3.0|Mistakenly ordered the one with bad language.  Love Pink, but prefer the songs without curse words as played on radio.  I'll have to do a better job of reading all of the fine print from now on!
1936608898|5.0|I have been a long time follower of Dallas & Melissa Hartwig.  I was introduced to their whole30 program two years ago.  I've lost 80lb, reversed insulin resistance and my bad cholesterol went down 99points... I'm way less tired and less depressed than I used to be too! I love this book, I love this way of life, I love the Hartwig's.  This should be required reading for everyone!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I absolutely love pinterest. The ideas are great and it is a savvy time killer.I recommend it to anyone. 5 stars.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|This was an amazing story.  I couldn't figure it out.  Every time I thought I knew what was going to happen it turned out to be something else.  The ending blew me away.  I never even imagined it would end that way.  Some of the scenes did seem to go on a bit longer than I would have liked.  Perhaps there could have been a bit more about some of the other people in the town, but overall it was a great story.  I ended up getting some other books by the same author.
030758836X|3.0|This is a cleverly written book, she's indeed a Good Writer; but I did not like but one character in it, I felt like I'd been slimed, actually; Slimed and Had.<br />I'd prefer to spend my time w/ Elmore Leonard, or Richard Ford.
B009KHBDUU|2.0|We were hoping for a little bit more substance or laughs or drama or horror or suspense or just about anything from this lackluster movie. Michelle Pfeiffer wasn't on screen long enough and the ending was so open ended with little closure or satisfaction. A real disappointment.
0765365278|5.0|The question I have to ask myself, every time I pick up a Brandon Sanderson book, is why did I have to discover this author so soon in his writing career? This book was amazing on so many levels: The character depth, the story line, the different time element, the magic, and the fighting was absurdly engrossing!  There is simply not a whole lot of new fantasy coming out these days that is at this level of writing, and having discovered Brandon Sanderson as early as I did leaves hurting for this kind of story telling from every book; sadly, it's hard to find....<br /><br />As a note, I have this in audio book, and I have to give a lot of praise to the narration as well. Kate Reading and Michael Kramer are the greatest duo to ever hit the world of audio books.  The only flaw is that Brandon Sanderson did not release all of the books in this series at the same time...... Yeah, that is impossible, but this is that great of a book!
B005K17RU0|5.0|I check it each morning to see what I should wear before setting out. Great, reliable forecasts, and the radar shows me how far away the bad weather is. Do I have time to cut the grass before it rains? Now I know.
B008673ZAQ|3.0|Like some other reviewers have said, this gave me whiplash. Gideon is downright psycho in this book - beyond possesive and in my opinion becomes the bad guy. With the last book, I was at least rooting for him. The book is just unrealistic with her rich lifestyle but down-to-earth attitude. Nobody has a perfect life like this. The end of the book takes this ridiculous, hard turn to a very surprising event in the book - the book ends with something more unrealistic happening to said event. I know it's a book, but c'mon, I have to feel as though some of these things may happen.<br /><br />Gideon Cross is annoying. Eva Trammel is clingy and should've gotten with Brett ;)
B00932A2MC|3.0|Good graphics, but overl, overally made.  The one thing that saves this from being lousy is the use of the battleship Missouri, towards the end.  That part was great.
0547995660|5.0|One of the best books I read as a kid. One of those you'll never forget....keeps you thinking about it.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|this movie is not a fast pase movie its like reading a good book. the movie is funny, profound, insightful, and sad. but its one of thoses movies where you see a bit of yourself in each one of the carectures. plus the inda culture you will find vary inturesting. =)
0439023491|5.0|Excellent 2nd book in Hunger Games Series. Almost as good as first book. Looking forward to more from this author.
B001S86J0I|4.0|this movie is so funny. if you are or ever where a star trek fan and your looking for agreat laugh this is the movie to see. but even if your not a fan you would still get a good laugh.
0439023521|5.0|Didn't think I'd like this one from reading the synopsis, but I ended up loving it. Fast-paced and exciting. A page turner for sure.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I've been listening/watching ThePianoGuys for quite a while and was excited to get their first CD through Sony Masterworks. They are so enjoyable to watch -- their passion for their music is so evident -- that that is the only thing I miss when I listen to the CD. I think they should have a DVD product with all of their music videos on it.
0439023513|4.0|Not as good as the first two books in the series, but still good. I was sad to finish this series because it was so good.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Although I was definitely a latecomer in terms of reading this highly regarded novel, I still found it to be exhilarating and an overall, fun and easy read.  I definitely would have appreciated a bit more detail in terms of the plot and character development, but the way it was written is suitable to a larger audience.  I would definitely recommend this novel for anyone who enjoys a good adventure series.
0345531965|5.0|Good book. Interesting story which kept my attention. Loved the family dynamics in this one. Grisham has a way with words.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|All I have to say is WOW! Christian Grey will capture your heart and leave you asking why when you come back to reality!
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|Adam Lambert is definitely a favorite of mine.  This cd is as good as it gets, with a mixture of different songs and beats that are really a joy to listen to.  This has to be cranked up high to fully appreciate it!  Adam has quite the range and he really mixes up his songs so that no two songs are alike.  A must buy!
B00846REIS|5.0|I rate books I have read on whether or not I can put it down. I don't read often so if I can put it down, it won't be finished. Like Fifty Shades I read it within day's. This book was instantly captivating. I never lost interest.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Enjoyed the suspense this book brought to the series. This book could have had a better ending, but it's worth reading all the way to the last page. Enjoyed this book and the series very much. Learned how to sync Amazon Kindle to the Apple Iphone 5 so I can read anywhere...just download the kindle app, and it automatically sync's to the last page read, perfect.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This is a great mixture of romance and difficulty! Christian will continue to capture your heart. I highly recommend reading!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I was hooked as soon as the video clip played and I turned around and got my boyfriend hooked too. this is most brain stimulating game ive played in a long time.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Again, a great book! Ending was a bit too fairy tale making it unrealistic. You were able to believe in them until the end, but I highly recommend the series!
B001DJ7PR8|5.0|Normally I'm not a big Woody Allen fan but this one is amazingly wonderful! I knew nothing about Barcelona, Goudi or Catalonia and am so fascinated by all of this now. The story is wonderful and perfectly cast, the setting is gorgeous. It tackles the subject of regret with a passionate heartbreaking perspective but never directly. Ironically and maybe on purpose, the narration is terrible and too fast but somehow it works. I found it creatively inspirational!
B003NTSBUG|5.0|This is not a horror or a slasher movie.  It is an edge of your seat suspenseful psychological thriller.  Characters are very well evolved and DiCaprio is excellent in this part. The ending is the twist and the surprise that you won't expect.
B007KZY1YY|4.0|Great book, easy read, husband loved it lol. To all you ladies out there looking for time out this book is a great way to do that
B003O86FMW|5.0|I couldn't put it down and I can't wait to read the next one!! The only downside is there is only one more of these amazing books left to enjoy.
B005WGLR04|5.0|How have I not read The Giver before now? It is a great book for children and adults alike. If you enjoy a read that paints another world so clearly that you feel like you are there, and gets you comparing it to the world you live in, then this book is for you. It is quite thought-provoking.
B0091REZMW|3.0|This game is pretty addictive on my kindle, but after the latest update it constantly crashes. I can only play for a few minutes at a time before I get too frustrated to keep playing - by then it's probably already crashed ten times and I have to force it to close and restart. And if you're looking for a true hidden object game this is not it. This is more of hidden object mixed with time management (which I happen to like).
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This season the gore is the word.  This is the 3rd season and it is getting real.  Only down side I have noticed is all the grass is cut.  Who been doing that in the midst of all these zombies?
0307895475|5.0|The game guide is very thorough and helpful. So much to do it is kind of hard to keep track of it all. Hours of play time discovered with this guide.
1594202842|4.0|This is a good read and engaging enough to get through easily and quickly.<br />It is extreme parenting and that is the point of the book, I dont think anyone should take offense, the writer freely admits for the most part she's nutty. Much of the concepts of the book, can be understood by most with an immigrant experience, though of course this book representation is much more extreme and often frustrating. That is what makes it a good read though, so i recommend. I have passed this on to others.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Catching Fire was an addicting read. I couldn't put it down.  I finished it in two days and would recommend it to all.  Just when I thought I knew how it was going to end, Suzanne Collins surprised me.
0307970299|2.0|This is the most expensive Kindle book I ever purchased. What a major disapointment. Do not see how it made the best-sellers list.  Cheryl Strade strikes me as a whining self centered nymphomanic. I am sorry her mother died, my father (who I was very close to) died at a young age too,I mourn and miss him still, but continued on and lived my life. Cheryl`s mother is on food stamps and can`t support her children, but has enough money to buy a horse??  That about says it all, and certainly explains Cheryl`s screwed up outlook and self absorbed attitude on life.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A great book that you just can't seem to put down. The descriptions are so easily vivid that you can't help but feel for katniss
B009KHDT0C|4.0|I enjoyed this show, especially the \\"60's\\" camera style, gave it a Rosemary's baby effect. I watched the original, but love Johnny Depp.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|If you liked 50 shades of Gray you will like this one more because the female main charter is a much stronger charter.
0757302661|5.0|At first I thought that this book was just written by somebody that took a silly idea about a pain free labor without drugs and tried to make money off of it. But really, there is a lot of truth to the idea. I don't believe you can take the pain away completely, but how much pain you feel during labor and oftentimes even the outcome can depend A LOT on your mindset during the whole thing. A lot of my friends swear by this book. For any woman afraid of labor, if you take this book and read it and actually use the information it gives you, you WILL have a much better birthing experience.
B005M2A4D4|4.0|I love Dr. Who in all it's regenerations. It's truly a great sci-fi genre and doesn't get stale. the twists and turns in the scripts are really great.
B008GVD6D8|5.0|I loved this book! So fast paced and energetic. Gideon's pure devotion and obsessive love for Eva makes you keep turning the pages
B001RXB4FY|5.0|I love this album and I just ordered the other two.  I am addicted to the music. My husband says I'm going to wear the CD out. Can't wait to get my order. I'm a Mom of grown children and a Grandmother!  Love it!
B0018CMJSU|5.0|Keeping it old school made this a ideal watch. Having the quality dvds with old film feel made it like watching a real movie.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|Very exciting,action packed, and kept you guessing to the end!!!<br />Didn't want to put the book down until it was finished!!! Awesome book
B009UX2YAC|5.0|When I first looked at it I thought it was a rip off of Temple Run. But when I played the game it was so much more fun than Temple Run. Im very picky about my apps I only use about 8 of my apps out of 20. And I play this app everyday in the morning before bed and in between. Well thats my opinion.
B008H6GH8I|5.0|This is a great movie, at a great price. I thought this move was better then the first animated one. Lots of actions and the story line is pretty good!
B0095R76EW|5.0|One of the funnier comedies out lately!! True to life situations and characters! Great comedic writing, and directing.  Just wish the playback would have been cleaner, the feed was off a bit...choppy & hazy at times.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|My sister told me about this book and she doesn't read too much so I had to see what all the hoopla was about.<br />Wow. It has made me laugh, smile and I can't put it down. Very well written. I am enjoying this one.
B003U6BE8I|5.0|It was a very good movie with some twists. I hope they made it longer or made a sequel of this movie.
B0012BV9FG|4.0|The dino is quite amazing unfortunately I got one that was chiped from the tail and face as if it was grabed off the shelve and banged around by kids that's why I give it 4 stars and the fact they mislead me to think I would receive a new on if I returned it but turned out it was no longer in their inventory other then that I liked very much
B0083SBJXS|5.0|This movie is the best yet from Marvel studios! I'm an old comic book reader from WAY back and this movie really does hold true to all the elements of what the comics communicated hard copy.  The humor, the drama, the action, etc...  Great casting as well.  Can't wait for the next one!
B008NW67E0|4.0|The Mumford and Sons second album is like the first is wonderful to listen to.  Unfortunately, like the first album it gives you nothing new, same, same, same.  I would have liked them to push the creative end a bit. I hope the third gives us a little more creativity.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|The booke was really good.  I am ready for the next book to come out because the ending left you haning.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|awesome game but you run out of coins fast but you can still buy more which I don't. I think you might want this game if you are constantly board.
B006YGC7KK|5.0|This is one of my favorite shows, I loved Season 2. Nikita is such an underrated show, it's so quality in every aspect,the action, the writing, the cast. I just wish more people were able to recognize their hard work. Everyone should watch this series, you won't regret it!
B007HGPBRC|5.0|This book is well worth the short investment of time if you loved Christopher Hitchens' writing and his views on the finality of death.  It shows how barbaric much of cancer treatment is on the patient.  The book also points to the bad things that well-meaning people say to cancer patients to show sympathy.  Sometimes an attempt to boost patient morale has the opposite effect.  This book is great to have on an e-reader because you can look up the mythological or philosophical reference quickly and more fully understand the point Hitchens is making.  The introduction gives the reader a full context for Hitchens thoughts.  The concluding writing is from his wife which also give the reader a more full understanding of the tragedy this cancer was for him, his family and his devoted readers.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Love love loved this book.  It's good.  You should read it because it'll make you feel things you felt when you weren't so jaded.
B005LAJ1PE|5.0|What can I say about this series other than you really don't know what to expect. When you think one thing is so its not and that is due to excellent writing obviously but hands down to the amazing cast especially Jessica Lange. This shows deserved every nomination it got and so far loving season 2 and can't wait to see if it messes with my head like season one.
B0098VYCCE|2.0|Watched about 45 minutes (rented on my Kindle Fire), wound up not finishing it.<br /><br />The special effects were great, and the camera work. Everything else, and particularly the script, sucked, to me. Some of the acting was alright, but honestly they weren't given much to go by.<br /><br />It definitely strove to be a \\"fresh\\" retelling of the story, and succeeded to some degree, but I felt like the things they added to make it more \\"unique\\" wound up just being more clich&eacute;s that were just new to Snow White, rather than genuine innovative. I felt like I was painfully aware of how much they're \\"trying\\" to be something different.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Rick Riordan is a genius! I loved this book, cannot wait for the next one. The story is captivating, this is the first book where you can see how much Percy and Annabeth have grown up since the first book. You can see how the characters have changed and how this affects their adventures. I definitely recommend this book for any reader.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Addictive and challenging, and yet soothing rather than frustrating to play. This game is very zen without being mindless or boring in the least.
B000FC1HBY|4.0|Other than periodic offensively descriptive torture or rape scenes, the book is engaging, the characters three demensional. Not for the faint hearted.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Totally enjoyable.  Well written.  The author is able to put you \\"in the picture\\" - like a voyeur.  Wonderful story!
B009CPES4I|4.0|This movie was fun! I only gave it 4 stars because there were a couple of rather slow moments.  All in all this was a great movie with a fabulous cast!  I would rent this one again.
B005LAIHE0|4.0|The latest film from the Judd Apatow-produced camp is this romantic comedy gem starring Jason Segel (who also co-wrote the film) and Emily Blunt. Taking into account that Segel also wrote the hit [[ASIN:B001CCIRLO Forgetting Sarah Marshall (Two-Disc Unrated Collector's Edition)]], one can say that he has a talent for writing romantic comedies for guys. Segel perfectly captures a man's perspective in a relationship nowadays, but also writes his female characters as well-rounded and honest, without any misogynistic overtones. Also, he can write very honest, and often dark aspects to a relationship while still making the story funny. An interesting factoid to this film is that the skeevy man who is a threat to Tom (Segel) and Violet's (Blunt) relationship is a British college professor and if you listen to Segel's commentary for \\"Sarah Marshall,\\" he says that originally Sarah's new boyfriend was not a rock star (Brand), but a British college professor. It wasn't until Russell Brand came in to audition that Segel decided to rewrite the part for Brand. In this film the professor is portrayed by the wonderful Rhys Ifans (who is Welsh in real life). All of the characters in this film are well-written, well-played -- especially by Chris Pratt (NBC's \\"Parks and Recreation\\") and Alison Brie (NBC's \\"Community\\"/AMC's \\"Mad Men\\") -- and I especially liked how the story went into a dark place, with the two characters actually separating. I think this was a very well-done comedy that both women and men would enjoy. Segel has proved once again that he has a talent not only for being funny but also for writing.
6305137293|5.0|All of John Carpenter's movies are the best. Halloween I and Halloween II are the best Halloween movies made in a long time.
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|It's been a while since I've been able to enjoy a virtual cyber-world type SciFi book. This one was fun, the writing really rolls smoothly. The story is a classic Little Guy vs. The Establishment type conflict which is predictably fun. There is an overload of 80s pop culture trivia which is an idiosyncrasy I can see some people tiring of, but I found it charming. If you're into old school video games, from the MUD and arcade days you'll probably really love this story.
B00003CXA2|5.0|Best Tom Hanks movie. Recommend it to ANYONE who loves action, war, a couple laughs, a couple cries, and yeah girls, theres some romatic parts.
B000U0O9FM|5.0|An excellent read. I was thoroughly impressed. The style is gritty and non-caring. I liked that the movie stuck close to it and they produce similar feelings of awe
B0000VCZKW|5.0|I remember when I was little I used to watch this movie ALL THE TIME. Thanks for the childhood memories!
B006XF5BTG|5.0|I had tried many different programs for many years with little success until I tried this one. All the advice in this book works. I have gained twenty pounds of muscle in the past year. Try it for yourself.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Terrific plot with more twists than you could possibly imagine. So brilliant it's scary. Would recommend it to anyone who loves a story where you can't predict the ending.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My son loves this game.  He has been working on all sorts of projects and keeps coming up with new creative ideas.
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|I downloaded this movie through my TiVo!  Thanks Amazon for having this feature on TiVo.  Great movie, entertaining all through out!  Cant wait for the sequel.
0740748475|5.0|It's a very good collection for my whole family. Son and daughter, father and mother all enjoy the best collection of Calvin and Hobbes. Laughter is always around when the pages are turned by anyone. Love it!
083205416X|5.0|Who am I to review one of the greatest literary works of all time? Could I possibly give this book anything less than the maximum rating it so richly deserves? Should I even commence? Those were just some of my private thoughts as I finally put down a copy of this book - read. This is the book which stirred the American conscience, caused political reform and brought about change when first published in 1939. This is the book which described how families were starving to death because of corruption. This is John Steinbeck at his exceptional best. For those people who never got around to reading this engaging and absorbing account of the Joad family, may I suggest you actually purchase a copy (any copy!) and finally read it.<br /><br />Today the world is either in recession or emerging from the dark grip of this latest financial catastrophe. Whilst we may live in a time when millions of families are no longer allowed to starve to death - well, not in the developed world at any rate, I earnestly believe there are lessons to be learned from this book about the rich and powerful who care not for their fellow man but only for personal gain. More importantly, those lessons are as relevant today as they were in 1939.<br /><br />Another similarity also failed to escape my notice; In this book we see how US police and other officials use their positions of authority to threaten and even blackmail the many thousands of American migrants who were simply looking for work in order to feed hungry mouths. These people had not arrived from any foreign country and were not even black - something which would have made their persecution much easier. No!, these ordinary white American folk were honest farmers who had been forcibly evicted from their homes and the land they had worked for generations. Seventy years on, here in the UK, we are besieged by TV programmes depicting our different police forces undertaking their various duties around the country. Yet more cheaply produced \\"reality\\" television! Significantly, however, I have occasionally noticed how some police officers deliberately provoke a hostile situation where none exists. Whilst not on the scale portrayed in this outstanding work, it is interesting that I should recognise that underlying attitude of arrogant superiority.<br /><br />Whilst some may find the book slow going at the start, Steinbeck quickly gathers in those loose strands until they suddenly pull together to assume a story, reveal a mental photograph and produce a relevance into which the reader becomes fully immersed. I promptly learned local words and understood the dialect in which they were spoken as the Joad story unfolded. I could hear those southern accents as hardships are endured and explained through the actions of those who lived them. This was the organised, legalised daylight robbery and exploitation of the poor by the rich who were actively supported by the law enforcement agencies. A week's work for 1,000 fruit pickers paying 50 cents an hour is advertised to 3,000 hungry people who then pass on the message. Consequently, 5,000 starving workers arrive in search of that employment. With so much competition, the rate is lowered to 30 cents - take it or leave it! It was a deliberate ploy repeated time after time. Anyone attempting to organise his fellow workers is photographed, black-listed and branded a communist. Now feed that to your children. Then the banks insist the farmers reduced the rate to 25 cents and any landowner who questions that decision is swiftly reminded of his own vulnerability as a mortgagee! In short, either you pay them 25 cents or you join them! My own immediate reaction was to recognise a similarity between then and now - specifically with those modern banking practises which preyed on the sub-prime market. Anyone who cared to consider precisely what \\"sub-prime\\" meant, knew it was a policy destined to fail. And fail it did in spectacular fashion - and yet, the fat cat bankers still draw bonuses based on \\"personal performance\\" and not on their company's overall profit or loss...<br /><br />I note from some of the comments appended to certain editions of this book, that various issues have been produced in which, apparently, Steinbeck's prose are changed to make the work an easier read.

B0094U0RJQ|4.0|Another great album. Anyone who enjoys Dylan will love this album. I was a little skeptical but was pleasantly surprised at how good it was.
1601251556|5.0|I really can't recommend this product enough. When I started playing tabletop games 4 years ago, this was one of my first purchases, because I knew I wanted a grid mat that was compatible with dry-erase markers (most aren't!). I used this product literally today, and it has not lost anything in terms of quality. Using dry erase markers, as opposed to wet erase, or (eugh) grease pencil, means being able to add to and tweak the map on the fly, destroying terrain, drawing in spell effects, and even writing in notes, because you can erase them with a simple, no-mess swipe. I love that it's double sided, where I can use the brown for outdoors and the grey for indoors or underground, or, if I know they'll be going back to the room they're in, just flipping the mat over and preserving that side for later. The material is sturdy, and absolutely feels \\"worth the money\\".<br /><br />If you're just starting to play tabletop games, absolutely buy this. Its simple, budget friendly, and as my own map's dutiful years of service have shown, durable as heck.
B000YMM3CC|4.0|As a classic, The Notebook continue many perplexing themes. While this story is one that seems only available in dreams, the attitudes and characters are really REAL. They deal with the heartache...the joy...the pressure...and the struggle with finding 'true love'.

B008VDJFFY|5.0|This was by far one of the best books I've ever read. It tore at my heart strings and made me feel every emotion imaginable. The characters are believable and you can't help but fall in love with them. Lake and Will's relationship is one you can't help but root for. The shock factors in this book are also what make it such a great read! There are so many and therefore it can never be said that the book gets boring! It's a definitely not to be missed!

B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I have long awaited this book. I simply LOVE it! The plot grows thicker! Very thick, and for once the ending is not all happiness and rainbows (not that I'm complaining). I also enjoy the fact that Rick Riordan finally incorparated Echo and Narcissuss, which wierd old me has waited for. At this point I am beginning to think Riordan can do no wrong.

0399157565|2.0|The book was OK but I got very, very tired of all the references to Kay's stuff. The brand of watch, pantry #1, pantry #2, her stove, her clothes.....OK, OK, I get it...nothing but the best for Kay. I would love to return to the first series of books where Cornwell did not feel the need to show Kay's status by describing every detail of her \\"stuff\\".<br />I also notice the pages are made of a thick paper. I kept thinking I was turning two pages. It fattens the book and makes me think it's intentional to lead the reader to think there's more to the book since it's 450 pages. It would be a good 250 pager of a good story without the added fluff.

B00756GKBA|5.0|As I started on my first adventure listening to this album, I found myself immediately drawn in by the catchy rhythm and simple lyrics of \\"Girls Gone Wild.\\"  I'm at work, and I can barely keep myself from jumping up to jam to the synthesizer & techno beat.  Then, track #2 hits, and the song \\"Gang Bang\\" literally leaves me hanging with my jaw dropped, mouth wide-open in SHOCK at the darkness, pain, anger, and hurt buried in this song.  The song is so RAW, and exposing of the human desire for revenge when wallowing in the valley of \\"hurt\\" from a broken relationship.  All this, and yet the track beats & twisted lyrics draw me in with a strange desire to JAM OUT to the tune.  Totally Crazy.  As the rest of the album spins on... my impression changes vastly from song-to-song.  This album is ALL OVER the map both musically and lyrically.<br /><br />At first listen, I didn't find myself completely amazed with the sum of the effort.  However, I was completely misled by this first impression... as the more I listen to it, the more I appreciate how Madonna has been able to evolve, even to literally transform both her style and her music space.  She has obviously been working to branch out, yet all along being true to her background in dance and theater.  As it has grown on me, I find the album a refreshing exploration of \\"new space\\" for Madonna.  Somehow, she continues to reinvent herself through her musical expression in new forms.<br /><br />AND THEN, I landed seats at Madonna's MDNA World Tour in Houston... where she performed EIGHT of these tracks live, onstage, with the most elaborate / INSANE audio-visual stage that I could ever imagine possible.  Before this experience, I wasn't really a big Madonna fan... but after seeing this in person, I am now a life-long fan club member.  AWESOME.  INSANE.  OUT-OF-THIS-WORLD.  I would have paid TWICE the ticket price to see this concert in person.  If you have a chance, please, DON'T MISS it.  She's as alive and vibrant as ever...with a much deeper set, depth of talent, and evolution into music genres as any pop artist out there, EVER.  Regardless of what the radio-heads push over the airwaves.  Madonna is still the Queen of Pop.  Hands down.<br /><br />I HIGHLY recommend the purchase!

0071752854|5.0|I have pitched to hundreds of people and have only been met with praise and interest, however, I have yet to close the big deal.  As I read Pitch Anything I found myself recounting each experience and recognizing the different frames, push/ pulls, and power plays that appeared at each event.  I am now re-evaluating my performance over the past year and, through the advice found in this book, I am preparing myself to combat these situations for future meetings.    Pitch Anything is a quick read filled with substance and real world practical advice.  Once learned you can't help but recognize the different frames that come up in everyday conversations.  By the end of the book you are aching to get out there and try the system out.    I've now begun further instruction into Oren's methodology at [...] and I recommend it to everyone that will listen.  After speaking with Oren, I can tell you that he is sincerely passionate about this topic and his advice works.    A must read!
B0096HIEE2|3.0|This movie has some very entertaining moments - both Channing Tatum and Matthew McConaughey do a good job as the eye candy they are supposed to be in this movie. I always find McConaughey - who plays the owner of a male strip club here - a little heavy-handed in his acting, but this is such a heavy-handed role and setting anyway that it mostly works. Channing Tatum brings a soulfulness to his role as the lead stripper in the show who longs for something more, both in terms of relationships and career. It's not Oscar material, but he is always great to watch on screen, and does a good job here.<br /><br />By contrast, Alex Pettyfer, who plays Channing's mentoree and new young guy in the club, falls flat. He comes across as very wooden, and we never really get a sense of what he is going through or why he gravitates to the wild life so much. Olivia Munn, who plays his sister and Channing's love interest, is similarly wooden, and I felt they both brought the film down a bit whenever they were in a scene (which was most.)<br /><br />The bigger problem is the storyline, which starts out OK, but then just kind of peters out. Channing's character has some sort of growth trajectory implied by the end, but we don't really get a clear sense of what it is. So this film has its moments, and it is not simply a superficial, eye-candy kind of movie, but it just isn't consistent enough to pull off what it is trying to do.

B009I0QTF8|5.0|I found myself just as impressed with the album as I had hoped to be, given my affinity for Flying Lotus. It seems like a bit of a departure from the style of \\"Cosmogramma\\", with tracks that are more reminiscent of his earlier works. The exception being \\"Mmmhmm\\", which would have been right at home here. There are a few singular gems like \\"See Thru To U .feat Erykah Badu\\" and my personal favorite \\"Hunger .feat Niki Randa\\", but the album flows together so well that I always find myself listening from start to finish. The featured vocals are all great and Thundercat's bass lines will turn heads. Whether you are a long time Flying Lotus fan or just getting into him, I'd highly recommend checking out \\"Until the Quiet Comes\\".

0316098329|1.0|Room, by Emma Donoghue, is a critically acclaimed novel in which there has been a lot of hype surrounding the book.  In fact, the book has received so much hype, it cannot live up to its praise and is grossly overrated.  Basically, the book was tedious and boring.<br /><br />The plot has strong similarities to the story of an Austrian woman who was held prisoner and repeatedly raped by her father for twenty-four years.  She bore her captor several children, who were also imprisoned until their rescue.  There are other similar cases as well.<br /><br />Room is the story of a young woman, \\"Ma\\", who was kidnapped by a man they refer to as \\"Old Nick,\\" and imprisoned by him for seven years. She gave birth to a son during her time in the room.  The story is told through the eyes of her son, five-year old Jack. The book begins with his fifth birthday, continues through their escape, and ends with their first weeks of freedom.<br /><br />I realize the author wanted the reader to feel the frustration of daily life in an 11 by 11 room, and she did that, over and over and over, ad nauseam.  I thought this section of the book would never end.  The telling of the daily life in the \\"room\\" was overdone.  It consumes a third of the book and fighting through this section was extremely difficult.<br /><br />And speaking of the 11 by 11 room, something just wasn't right.  In this 11 by 11 room, was a toilet, a dresser, a television, a rocking chair, a bathtub, a sink, a stove, a refrigerator, a bed, a table, chairs and a lamp.  Really?  How did all that furniture fit in an 11 by 11 room?  I know this is fiction, and some poetic license is allowed, but let's have a little sense of reality.  There is no way all that furniture could fit in such a small room.<br /><br />Another issue was that the story is told from the perspective of Jack, the five-year old boy.  The poor grammar and constant \\"baby-speak\\" of a 5 year-old made an already boring story an intolerable read.<br /><br />Jack also has repetitive references to his penis.  A five-year old aware of his penis?  Really?<br /><br />The character of Jack is inconsistent.  One minute is talking baby-talk and babble.  The next sentence he is making intelligent comments well beyond the capacity of a five-year old.<br /><br />Probably the most difficult part to overcome was the constant emphasis on breastfeeding.  Jack \\"wants it\\" over and over and over again.  After saying this more than fifty times, we get it.  Not only do we get it, we are tired of \\"it.\\"  Jack is wanting \\"it\\" every few pages.  He even prefers one side over the other.  Enough of \\"it.\\"<br /><br />I had to force myself to finish the book.  Trudging through the first 100 pages was difficult and tiresome.  The section with Jack and his mother in the room was way too long.  Then, in just two to three pages, they were rescued.  I would love to seen this section drawn out a little more.  Give us some drama in the rescue.  When the captor abandons Jack on the street and takes off, let us wonder if he is going back to the room to kill Jack's mother or move her elsewhere.  This section of the book was almost over before it started and failed to create any tension in the plot.<br /><br />Donoghue made her story extremely tiresome and boring.  A third of the book is spent inside the room.  How much action can occur in a room?  We are bored with the daily chores, such as taking a bath, eating, brushing the teeth, etc.  How terribly boring!<br /><br />The character of the captor, Old Nick, is not well drawn.  He is almost non-existent.  I would love to have known more about him and his motivation to kidnap a young woman and hold her hostage.<br /><br />Even the final part of the book when Jack is taken places in the \\"outside,\\" is boring.  Again, we are bored by his daily routine, shopping, sleeping, and eating.  Being told every single detail of even the smallest thing that Jack does in a day is excruciatingly painful.  It was a major effort to finish the novel.<br /><br />There are many holes in the plot.  The escape does not sound plausible; it is just not believable.  Old Nick would have to be an idiot to fall for such a trick.  Also, many difficulties of re-entering the world were never addressed by Donoghue.  Re-entry seemed too easy and too fast.  After just a few days, Jack, who has never been outside the room for five years appears to be adjusting and behaving normally.  He has never associated or played with other children before in his life, yet adjusts to this social deprivation in just days.  This is not realistic.  Also, the mother's suicide attempt comes out of nowhere.  There were no clues to let the reader know it was coming.<br /><br />The only enjoyable part was the book's ending.  I did like the ending and the closure it provided.  Other than that, this was a boring and terrible book.  Don't waste your time with it.inish the novel.<br /><br />There are many holes in the plot.

B004W2UBYW|5.0|The Life of renowned CEO of Apple Computer, who was subsequently fired and returned a few years later with the wisdom to make Apple to most valued company in the world, Steve Jobs truly was an interesting character. Inspirational, chaotic at times, cool, obsessive, and dedicated; some of the adjectives that best describe the life of this man. Some hated him, for he demanded perfection; but those that stuck around and worked with Jobs created simplicity out of complexity. Beautiful products that simply work.<br /><br />Walter Issaacson's biography of the life and times of Steve Jobs was excellently written and filled with detail. It couldn't have been an easy task to write about Jobs, but Isaacson did an excellent job and I highly recommend this read to anyone interested in Apple, technology, art, and music. It's an easy read, nothing too complicated and it flows from chapter to chapter. It is well researched and well written, and I'm certain you'll enjoy it as much as I have.

B0043VDIAG|5.0|I was lucky enough to win this paperback from a giveaway run by @BtweentheSheets on Twitter.<br /><br />Straight away I was intrigued by Katie - there were hints of trouble in her past and I was keen to find out exactly what that trouble was. An overwhelming feeling of sadness surrounded Katie and I quickly felt protective towards her.  She was leading a simple new life with only the basic essentials that she needed, this made me feel that something pretty bad had happened previously to make her live in that way.<br /><br />Alex also seemed very sad although the reason for that was explained quite early on in the story.  The scenes with him and his children were lovely to read, there were some real `awwwwww' moments which made him a very likeable character in my eyes.<br /><br />I was relieved when Katie began to open up about her history and the reasons why she was in Southport, although I found some of it difficult to read I felt that this information made me understand her character much better.<br /><br />Katie's new friend Jo was interesting, I felt glad that she was there for Katie but I couldn't really figure out her place in the story, it wasn't until quite near the end that it all became clear.<br /><br />Kevin had some serious issues and the author did an amazing job making me believe his craziness, he was a character who I pictured very easily thanks to the writing and by the end I really feared his appearances.<br /><br />The whole story was written beautifully, some of it had a very calming effect on me and other more manic moments really got my heart pounding.  I particularly enjoyed reading the letters - the first caused tears to stream down my face and the second gave me goosebumps as something strange was revealed.<br /><br />A fantastic read filled with real issues and a touching romance.

B006LSZECO|5.0|I loved this book!  The story was suspenseful and the characters interesting.  Lots of twists and turns to keep the reader guessing.  The perfect marriage is no longer quite so perfect and suspicions are raised when the wife goes missing.  The husband is not as distraught as he could be and before long he becomes the prime suspect.  Its best not to give more of the plot away, best to read and be surprised by what happens yourself!

But it wasn't one of the greatest. Child keeps returning to these Zombie midwestern landscapes. He should let Reacher go urban again. Even the southern military base had more action this out in the middle of nowhere story, as revealing as it was about nuclear waste.

B007URVZJ6|4.0|This brief work is clear and professional. It inspires confidence in the user and answers many questions concisely.

B00979CS50|5.0|This is an excellent Neil Young album, which is a relief to be able to say because I didn't think much of Americana, his last one. This album, like Americana, features Crazy Horse but is a completely different piece of work and it's terrific - in places I think it comes close to his best, which makes it something really special.<br /><br />The overall sound and feel is vintage Neil Young. There are the hauntingly melancholy tunes, the thoughtful, quirky lyrics and the great chord sequences which made albums like Harvest and After The Goldrush so great, combined with the controlled, distortion-driven power of the brilliant Rust Never Sleeps. (Am I showing my age here?) This album is also a reminder of what a great band Crazy Horse are. The sound is terrific, there is some great guitar work and they are tight and gutsy so even Born In Ontario, the only slightly weak song on the album, still sounds really good.<br /><br />Neil Young is often meditating on experience and aging here, but he still sounds young and fresh and still has more power and guts than a lot of artists half his age. Several of the tracks are very long; Driftin' Back lasts nearly half an hour and other tracks are over 15 minutes. This, of course, is typical Neil Young - refusing to bow to convention and doing whatever makes musical sense to him at the time. He has always done this and it can be dreadful (it sometimes has been in the past) but nearly all the time here it's great. The huge Ramada Inn is a masterpiece in my view, and more conventional shorter tracks like Twisted Road may well end up in the list of Neil Young Classics.<br /><br />There is little self-indulgence and a huge amount of real musical substance. Driftin' Back could perhaps do with a little trimming, but it's still a really good track. The last half of Walk Like A Giant will probably get the skip-to-next treatment from me, but its first eight minutes or so are quite brilliant.<br /><br />You have to hand it to the man - he doesn't mess about and within six months of releasing the mediocre Americana he has come up with a real cracker which I think will stand among his finest albums.

B007IGG0P8|4.0|[Amazon Verified Purchase] I first purchase of this album was a 8 track and album in 1971.Presently I am replacing my albums with cds.There is one major advantage of cds,No snap crackle pop.Remastered albums are sometimes like hearing the album for the first time.I have been collecting music for 48 years and it really does not get any better than a cd. In my opinion the original studio recording is always better than a Greatest Hits album.Another advantage to cds is the addition of bonus tracks that was not on the original release.I have had good luck finding hard to find cds at Amazon.com.I give them an A+ on service,and delivery.

B007TK77QE|3.0|I wanted to read this out of curiosity initially and subsequently because of the very harsh reviews it was getting, and so I approached it with ambivalance not knowing if I was reading to spite the critics or to join them. The results are fairly anticlimactic, I enjoyed reading it - it kept my attention, but that was about it. The only other thing was that it kept reminding me of Irvine Welsh books, nowhere near ANY of their violence, foul language or drugs but just the storyline of 'The Fields' and its people I guess. Overall I say its worth a read regardless of who wrote it, and perhaps I would feel more strongly either way if it wasn't JK, who knows! The price of mega-fame I guess!

B004JN1D2I|5.0|As a whole, this set was amazing to me. Martin takes daring chances with the characters and allows them to truly develop into people in book four that are virtually unrecognizable from what you would expect of them from just the first book. The times are savage and no matter how much you root for a particular character, there is no telling whether they will survive or not. The fact that every character seems to be expendable in Martin's eyes only adds to the drama once the action is underway.<br /><br />The stories in the books are complex and I really felt like I had taken an overall satisfying journey by the end of book four.<br /><br />With the exception of the beginning of book four, A Feast For Crows, the entire series was a page turner. A Feast For Crows eventually picked up and drew me back in, but the first five chapters tried my patience to the point I almost put the series down for good. It's because of those chapters I'd take half a star off of an otherwise 5 star rating. I'm glad I muscled through it, though and finished it.<br /><br />As for the formatting, I thought it was fine. There is a table of contents for each individual book, a master table of contents to navigate between the four books, one book at a time. There are maps of the kingdoms in each book that can be enlarged and panned to focus on a particular part of the geography. I use the Kindle on the iPad if that makes a difference, I don't know.<br /><br />I also noticed, that now this version isn't available in the US now, so I'm a little confused as to what changes the title is going through. I bought it in the US from Amazon in May, 2012, but can't remember the price, so I can't really comment on how much I paid. I can say, though, that I have no regrets for having got it, whatever I paid.

B00009NHC5|3.0|Little dates as much as a once-groundbreaking genre piece, and Wait Until Dark is no exception. Audrey Hepburn's `world champion blind lady' finds herself letting an unlikely number of total strangers into her apartment, all searching for a doll stuffed with heroin, though that's not the story they tell her as they try to trick her into giving it to them. See, husband Effrem Zimbalist Jr was persuaded by the courier (now dead and hanging in Hepburn's wardrobe) to hold onto it at the airport, and if you think that's an unlikely plot development, you ain't heard nothin' yet. Now a very nasty Alan Arkin, channelling Lenny Bruce, wants it back, coercing smalltime conmen Richard Crenna and his ex-cop partner Jack Weston into staging a little drama to convince her that it's her hubby who killed the girl. The plot is absurdly convoluted, the suspension of disbelief occasionally stretched to the limits as characters behave in increasingly absurd ways simply to advance the plot until it's just Audrey and one very, very bad man with a can of gasoline and a box of matches in the dark<br /><br />With a plot this unlikely, everything's down to the execution, and thankfully the film is well-cast enough and, a rarity for his post-Bond films, directed strongly enough by Terence Young for the oft-imitated and now predictable plot developments and shocks to still work. Mostly restricted to a single set (it began life as a play by Frederic Knott, the author of Dial M For Murder) there's an imaginative use of total darkness at the end, and Henry Mancini's score, alternating melody with off-key notes, is effective. It's so full of plot holes you won't buy the story for a second, but if you can put your brain on hold for a couple of hours it still delivers enough entertainment to be worth a look.<br /><br />Warners' DVD is a good widescreen transfer with two trailers and a vintage making of featurette.
B00979CS50|5.0|Neil Young--despite being, inarguably, one of the greatest and most influential artists in rock's long history--has been pretty hit or miss over the past couple decades, choosing to follow his every crazy whim while still periodically demonstrating, even after all these years, both his undeniable gift for songwriting and storytelling, and the potential to one day create yet one more timeless classic.<br /><br />Now that potential has come to full fruition, possibly triggered by the penning of his recent autobiography, 'Waging Heavy Peace,' with memories of the glory days reinvigorating him and, through osmosis, Crazy Horse as well. It's probably a bit too early to say definitively, but I think it could be argued that 'Psychedelic Pill' is Neil's best studio effort since 1990's near-perfect 'Ragged Glory,' also with Crazy Horse. It definitely helps here to be a fan of the band's patented sloppy-yet-sublime noodling jams, as they're in such abundance throughout these two discs I could picture even The Grateful Dead going, \\"guys, that's a bit much don't you think?\\" But for anyone who's into their more drawn-out songs (like yours truly), this album proves, in case anyone forgot, just who the world's greatest garage band is. Still.<br /><br />The perfect evidence comes right out of the gate with \\"Driftin' Back,\\" a positively epic track that's among the band's best, and at nearly half an hour in length, is perfect for the fan who thought the guitar solo in \\"Cortez the Killer\\" was about 20 minutes too short. The lyrics--concerning the growing commercialization of music and art, and the \\"failure\\" of the 60's counterculture movement to induce change (with such classic, comedic Neil gems as \\"gonna get me a hip-hop haircut\\")--are secondary to the quasi-improvisational, marathon jams that find Young loosely but expertly weaving his jagged guitar solos all around the other instruments, to the point that it's nearly impossible to not just drift away into a hypnotized state of blissed-out euphoria.<br /><br />Another standout is the excellent, 16-minute \\"Walk Like A Giant,\\" which echoes \\"Driftin' Back\\"s theme of the failed promises of the Love Generation, with some of Young's best, most moving lyrics in recent memory: \\"Me and my friends, we were gonna save the world. Then the weather changed and the white got stained...and it breaks my heart.\\" The fuzzed-out, squalling guitars dominate the song--which showcases some great backing vocals and musical interplay from the rest of the band--until it degenerates into a clangor of noise for four straight minutes, reflecting, in a way, the shattered dreams Young sings about here.<br /><br />While the longer tracks on 'Psychedelic Pill' will most likely get all the pub, shorter numbers such as \\"Twisted Road\\"--a heartfelt tribute to Bob Dylan, Roy Orbison, and the Grateful Dead--show that Young hasn't lost the ability to write a great, simple pop tune. The 60's-ish garage-psych of the title track nods to Neil Young and Crazy Horse's 1969 classic, \\"Cinnamon Girl,\\" and to great effect, with swirling guitars that drift from one speaker to the other, resulting in a hallucinatory, tripped-out listening experience made for headphones. The catchy three-chord groove of \\"Born in Ontario\\" is actually pretty uplifting, and it's hard to keep from smiling and bobbing your head to its infectious, accordion-laced chorus.<br /><br />The only subpar note the album strikes, imo, is the slightly underwhelming \\"For the Love of Man,\\" a leftover song from the 80's that, while not a stinker by any means, just seems too subdued and out of place on an otherwise visceral album, though the lyrics concerning Neil's cerebral palsy-stricken son are touchingly poignant and fit well with the album's theme of catharsis. It just would have fit better on a more personal solo release from Neil, I think. Nit-picky, I know, but it's hard to find any real flaws on the album, so that'll have to do as far as criticisms are concerned.<br /><br/>With a runtime of nearly 90 minutes, one would think that the album's long, meandering jams would get old after a while, but that couldn't be further from the truth. 'Psychedelic Pill' shows signs that Neil Young could possibly be entering a renaissance period, hopefully one that mirrors Bob Dylan's current fifteen-year resurgence. This is an album that I believe stands above anything he's done in over 20 years, and one that can even sit comfortably next to (or just below in a couple cases) his 60's and 70's classics, with or without Crazy Horse, a remarkable feat for an artist in the midst of his sixth decade making music.<br /><br />Through all the peaks and valleys of his illustrious career, Neil Young has proven he's still capable of surprising the listener with a powerful, moving batch of songs about loss, broken dreams, and redemption, and with some insanely prodigious jamming to boot, thanks to the near-psychic connection between he and the band. Here's hoping there's more where that came from. But I'm just glad he's still out there, plugging away as usual.

0525478817|4.0|I read \\"Looking for Alaska\\", another novel by author John Green\\", years ago, and it wasn't until recently, around the time of the release of \\"The Fault in Our Stars\\" that I discovered the video channel on Youtube ran by him and his brother Hank.  Their videos convinced me to read this book, and while it is definitely heartbreaking at points, and a thrilling read that's incredibly difficult to put down, I couldn't help but read certain situations and feel disconnected.  I don't think it's a fault of the skill of the author, or the story itself, it may just have been me personally.  I was also disappointed with the ending of the book, as it seemed quite abrupt (although, while typing this, I can't help but wonder if this was intentionally, to fit along with a key part of the novel).<br /><br />While not my favorite novel by Green (I recommend you read \\"Paper Towns\\", or the aforementioned \\"Looking for Alaska\\" and you may see what I mean), this is a quality novel nonetheless.  It is young adult fiction that doesn't talk down to the reader- almost to the point of being a tad bit pretentious. (However, in my opinion a tiny bit of pretention never hurt anyone!).  Regardless of technical genre- I recommend this for anyone young or old.<br /><br />**(Does contain a bit of tragedy that may not be emotionally suitable for the youngest group of YA readers, but that's up to parents to decide!).

I had nowhere near the experience that the author Dr. Alexander did, but have had an experience or two that if discussed openly... being that I'm just an ordinary everyday layman... without the impressive resume' of the author which includes:\\" graduating from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with a major in chemistry and earning an M.D. at Duke University Medical School, had eleven years of medical school and residency training at Duke as well as Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard, completed a fellowship in cerebrovascular neurosurgery in Newcastle-Upon-Tyne in the United Kingdom, spent fifteen years on the faculty of Harvard Medical School , as an associate professor of surgery, with a specialization in neurosurgery\\"... if I had shared with the world my spiritual experiences I would most likely have been lambasted. That is why I am so happy that Dr. Alexander wrote this book and shared his experiences.<br /><br />Though  it's a short book with a limited description of the beauty of a heavenly experience... I'm sure no matter how much of this experience was shared it would seem too short. If more people were given an even playing field of credence in sharing their Near-Death-Experiences (NDE) then it wouldn't matter that people such as myself are mere laymen.<br /><br />The author's story describes in depth his sudden onset of meningitis and E. coli which led to his brain shutting down and being in a coma for seven days. A very touching part of the story is Eben's experience as an adopted child and the intermingling throughout the story of his extremely emotional attempts to be reunited with his birth family. Perhaps the most honest hard-hitting points made in the book are the times Dr. Alexander admits that prior to his NDE experience he would have been at the front of the line of the naysayers who \\"HAVE INSISTED AGAIN AND AGAIN THAT SCIENCE AND SPIRITUALITY CANNOT COEXIST.\\" In fact at the end of the book in Appendix B entitled \\"Neuroscientific Hypotheses I Considered to Explain My Experience\\"... he states: \\"In reviewing my recollections with several other neurosurgeons and scientists, I entertained several hypotheses that might explain my memories.

B003WMA7BU|1.0|I agree with the other one-stars that the characters lack any sort of depth and the story itself is very difficult to follow... but I'd also like to add on that the book, to me, reads very condescendingly.

This is one of those times where the movie really is better than the book.

B005LW5J9O|5.0|When a single book wins both the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award, it's well worthwhile taking a close look. Reading Stephen Greenblatt's The Swerve makes clear what all the fuss is about.<br /><br />More than two thousand years ago, some five decades before the year we give the number 1, an extraordinary Roman philosopher-poet named Lucretius wrote a 7,400-line masterpiece named De rerum natura (On the Nature of Things). Lucretius was an ardent follower of the 4th-Century Greek philosopher Epicurus, and his poem is an extraordinary expression of Epicurean philosophy on life, love, sex, the pursuit of happiness, and the nature of the universe. Epicurus was one of the central figures in the Axial Age (roughly 600 to 200 BCE), which gave the world Buddha, Confucius, Socrates, Plato, and other seminal thinkers across the grand sweep of Asia and Europe.<br /><br />It was Epicurus who laid the foundation for science and the scientific method by his insistence that nothing should be believed unless it could be established through direct observation and logical deduction. Using this logic, he undermined the basis of all the world's fear-based religions, asserting that the purpose of life was to seek pleasure and the absence of pain. As Greenblatt puts it, \\"Jesus wept, but there were no verses that described him laughing or smiling, let alone pursuing pleasure.\\" Epicurus, and later Lucretius, maintained, in Greenblatt's words, that \\"there is no end or purpose to existence, only ceaseless creation and destruction, governed entirely by chance\\" -- the random collision of atoms falling freely in the universal void. \\"Humans are not unique,\\" Epicurus contended. \\"We are made of the same stuff that everything else is made of\\" -- the human soul as well as the human body, both of which perish with death. \\"There is no afterlife\\" and \\"All organized religions are superstitious delusions.\\"<br /><br />Predictably, Epicurus and De rerum natura were suppressed and forgotten during Europe's thousand-year slumber from the triumph of Christianity in the 4th Century CE until the first glimmers of the Renaissance in 14th-Century Italy. It was then, with the emergence of humanism and its obsession with recovering the brilliance of the classical past, that Epicureanism gradually re-entered the realm of intellectual discourse. As Epicurus' 300 works had been lost irreparably but for fragments, it was the re-discovery of Lucretius' long poem in a monastic library in Germany that helped lay the foundation for the modern world.<br /><br />On one level, The Swerve is a work of cultural history, an attempt to unravel the sources of the revolutionary thinking that characterized the Renaissance. It's also a biography, of sorts, of a remarkable man named Poggio Bracciolini, an adopted son of Florence born in humble circumstances in a nearby village late in the 14th Century. Poggio was a book-hunter, one of the original humanists who sought answers to life's mysteries in the Greek and Roman classics, rejecting the dogmatic and intolerant views of the Church. Ironically, though never a priest, Poggio made his way in the world and amassed great wealth as apostolic secretary to a succession of eight Popes, serving at the right hand of some of the Catholic Church's most notoriously corrupt princes. At the age of 73, he finally separated himself from the Church, accepting the post of Chancellor of Florence, the city-state's titular head, and serving for five years. Poggio died shortly after retiring from the job, living to the age of 78 in an era when life expectancy in Italy was no more than about half that many years.<br /><br />It's staggering to contemplate the influence of Lucretius' poem. The themes elaborated in that extraordinary work can be found in the later writing of Sir Thomas More -- Utopia portrayed a society built on Epicurean principles, with the important exception of its insistence on the eternal life of the soul in the afterlife -- as well asin Giordano Bruno, Michel de Montaigne, and a passel of English writers, including Shakespeare, Spenser, Donne, and Bacon. And \\"Thomas Jefferson owned at least five Latin editions of On the Nature of Things, along with translations of the poem into English, Italian, and French. It was one of his favorite books, confirming his conviction that the world is nature alone and that nature consists only of matter.\\"<br /><br />\\"`I am,' Jefferson wrote to a correspondent who wanted to know his philosophy of life, `an Epicurean.'\\"in Giordano Bruno, Michel de Montaigne, and a passel of English writers, including Shakespeare, Spenser, Donne, and Bacon.

B009NQKPUW|4.0|Very interesting true to the core of a very good science-fiction story. With far superior Alien culture and the power of genetic engineering of otherworlds for a unknown purpose. There's a lot of unanswered questions in the movie is truly calling for a sequel, which I'm looking forward to seeing also if one appears. Although there is parallels in some of the scenes of the alien series it is definitely not, an addition to the alien movies. But just my opinion with another sequel it could possibly lead to an early extension of the that series, will just have to wait and see. All the acting and visual effects were top notch, and Blu-ray with the 5.1 surround is awesome, and so were all the extras enjoyed them all.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is my first time writing a book review and its because the book was just that great! Even though I have seen the movie already, reading The Hunger Games was just amazing. You just wanted to skip to the end but the middle just kept your attention. Totally reading the other two, Catching Fire and Mocking jay! I hardly read but let me just say this is something you want to read.
B009S8PEHY|4.0|I've been waiting for Rod Stewart to record a Christmas album for years. With a voice that's as warm as a cup of hot chocolate, I knew it would be terrific. Now that it's here, is it? For the most part, yes. Rod's in good voice, the arrangements are beautiful and there are a handful of special guests to keep things interesting.<br /><br />David Foster produced this album, and it sounds great. That said, many of the arrangements - which are beautiful - are extremely mellow. Where the album really shines is the more upbeat tracks, such as \\"Merry Christmas, Baby\\" with Cee-Lo Green and \\"Red-Suited Super Man.\\" These two songs allow Rod to let loose and show off his soulful side. I also liked how \\"Auld Lang Syne\\" featured bagpipes and \\"Silent Night\\" included a children's choir to liven things up.<br /><br />Overall, this is an enjoyable Christmas album that features an interesting mix of songs and special guests. If you're a Rod Stewart fan looking for a great way to kick off the holiday season, you'll be pleased with Merry Christmas, Baby.
B008GFI3QE|5.0|Excellent documentary, bring new vision related to George Martin work, this wonderful arranger that changed the way we listen to music, from Beatles, to America, to soundtracks!

B000V1Z8KK|5.0|The movie was excellent. Acting superb and the story intriguing. Plenty of action to keep your attention. Mark Wahlberg was wonderful as well as the rest of the cast.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this app!!! it is better than temple run!! I am soooooo glad it is free now!! I love all the colors and graphics!
B005LAIH2W|5.0|The Purest of Purists will quibble, but I found this movie very satisfying.<br />The acting is very good, special effects are convincing and dramatic, and the story leaves you hungering for more.<br />It is a shame that Disney failed to promote John Carter properly. That was the reason for its low Box Office performance.<br />There is still a rabid fanbase who would love to see more of Barsoom on the screen.
B0086700CM|1.0|I love the Temple Run game.  It works smoothly on the ipad.  On the Kindle Fire it is awful.  It is almost unplayable it freezes and has so many glitches.
B009JTCBLE|4.0|I have taken an interest in Joe Bonamassa since getting his album Driving Toward the Daylight earlier this year, and that led me to the \\"supergroup\\" that he is a part of - Black Country Communion - and their latest offering Afterglow.  Listening to Afterglow is like stepping into a musical time machine back into the 70's and 80's calling to mind the likes of Led Zeppelin, Aerosmith, and ZZ Top.  While Bonamassa was what drew me to BCC, it is clear to me that Glenn Hughes is the engine that makes the bad go.  His vocals are a blend of Chris Cornell and David Lee Roth, but he also handles bass duties as well - and he acquits himself quite well on both accounts.  The sound of Afterglow is various shades of blues infused hard rock.  Bonamassa has a grooving guitar lick that runs under the verse on \\"This Is Your Time\\" while \\"Cry Freedom\\" is more of a blues shuffle.  Both \\"Afterglow\\" and \\"Crawl\\" are driven blues rock songs that conjure Led Zeppelin.  However the crown jewel of Afterglow is the seven minute haunting blues lament \\"The Circle\\".  Hughes starts the song with a clear vocal delivery but he reaches his screeching intensity on the chorus \\"I'm in the middle of a dream. I just don't know what it means.  I am at war with the fear.  And I'm lost in the circle again.\\"  If you liked the hard rock sounds of the 70's and 80's, Afterglow is a must have.  I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Download this:  The Circle
B007GCY8FS|4.0|a comfortable read/after 38 yrs in a related field, I can identify with many of the situations be they actual or imagined.
B007L6VR6M|4.0|I won't reiterate much of what I see other people saying with regards to this film other than to say that I too appreciate that the movie was one of the few these days that seems to be of the story/message movie vein.  I appreciate this (not that there's anything wrong with Transformers 4 or Expenables 3 or whatever, it's not like anyone watches those expecting to be blown away with nuance and subtext) because this, unlike the plethora of films out there lately that I actually sat down and paid attention to in order to make sure I didn't miss anything.<br /><br />Insofar as the \\"type\\" of acting, production values it is pretty standard Wes Anderson film making so if you've seen The Royal Tenenbaums, The Life Aquatic etc you'll know what to expect.<br /><br />I leave four stars simply because I had expected the film to be more based around the adults (Norton, Murray, McDormand, Willis) and their looking for the two runaways as opposed to being more about the runaways (Hayward and Gilman)and their being looked for.  This is a small matter that reflects my expectations and personal preference only as both Hayward and Gilman give performances as good as that given by their adult costars.
B00122S4KS|5.0|i HAD to buy this album! best song is probably Emergency. and i said probably because i cant really pick a favorite! gotta get this album (also recommended, Paramore album: Brand New Eyes ~ best song: Brick By Boring Brick)
B009NQKXYK|1.0|This is an paragon example of a trite explication of mythology to Sci-Fi.  Some good acting, but mostly bad acting.  The narrative is poor... both completely predictable and frankly if over 11 not very engaging.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|love it.  easy to play and a hard game to put down.  the coins come faster once you get higher up in levels
B008H6GH8I|5.0|Comparing to the Resident Evil movies, the comics are definitely closer to the stories in the games, although it's still pretty different. The graphic in damnation is awesome. Honestly the last one (degeneration) had already surprised me but this easily beats it. Tyrants are great. Actually that's the correct way to put Tyrants as the final boss in anything related to Resident Evil.
B0028NSE3M|5.0|The originator, the trendsetter. Isaac Hayes was one of the greatest pioneers in music. His sound is often echoed in the music that we listen to today. Hot Buttered Soul is filled with crazy live instrumentals and Isaac's deep, sultry voice. An A+ plus album indeed!!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I've tried other remote desktop apps and none has worked better. Fast on Wi-Fi and on the go (4G Verizon)
B005LAJ16I|3.0|there are some technical details with the DVD set that should have been dealt with before release.  specifically the navigation within the individual DVDs which require that you start from the beginning of the first DVD episode and reset thE features EVERYTIME YOU TURN THEM OFF! You can't navigate between episodes within a DVD (despite the menu instructions that say you can). I've purchased a number of boxed sets before and have never experienced it.  It's a nuisance to have to fast forward the DVD every time instead of it automatically picking up episode where you previously had left oit.  Appears Amazon rushed to get product to market without ironing out the bugs.<br /><br />I've found the show itself a little disappointing as well.  maybe the hassle with the DVDs contributes to that. More ordinary than I had expected.  Acting and writing weaker than I'd expected after all the hype.  Reminds me of \\"24.\\"<br /><br />Doesn't compare with \\"Prime Suspect\\" or \\"The Wire.\\"<br /><br />This is my first negative experience with Amazon.
B009CPE424|2.0|The movie is ok but there's nothing new here. Time to move on. The dogs are ok but the human actors look bored.
B0013D8LCW|5.0|Although the 21st Century has a long way to run, Shelter is surely one of the best gay-themed films thus far. It takes us well beyond the AIDS and drag-queen films of the 90s and into the realm of real people coping with life. Considering that it was shot in just 3 weeks, and in December, with str8 actors, it's a sweet love story. The music and settings are also great. My only criticism is that the sound is weak in places--but that makes it good for a second viewing.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I loved this book.  I had a really hard time putting this book down. I can hardly wait for the next one.
B005HSL626|4.0|I like it just for some reason when ever I go to the main menu there is a white rectangle why!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book! Could not put it down! Great story and writing also loved the next 2 books. It's an awesome introduction to the story.
B004NS710C|5.0|This movie can keep you on the edge of your seat, one of the best train movies I have seen
B000UZQI0Q|4.0|Although I didn't think the second book was as good as the first, it was still very good.  It kept my attention and definitely expanded the development of the characters.  As with the first, the majority of the action occurred near the end of the book which led me to wanting to start the next book as soon as possible.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I would give this book 6 stars if I could. The way the author presents his story and style of prose is like something I have never read before. A great pieces of historical fiction and the ability of the mind and soul to remain true to oneself in the worst of times.I look forward to reading other book from this author.
1451675046|5.0|Love this game.  I wish I knew what I was doing to earn bonus points and I don't understand the whole chicken yard, but I love playing it, and I love all the hearts and love the birds send me when I visit the yard and buy them something new with my points.  For not knowing any of the rules of the game - I'm surprised that I really can't stop playing it.
B000YDG5X4|4.0|It looks great and is well priced. Very light so I am wondering how durable it really is. The top of the boot fits well under my jeans
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|The beginning is very captivating with all the details, but towards the middle of the book it does get pretty slow. But once you get over that it has an amazing finish.
B009YDAUJ0|3.0|I don't know what to say other than I am still enjoying TWD. I bought season 1 & 2 and love the progression of the characters (even though we lost a few along the way). In this episode we follow Andrea's POV and see that she \\"gets rescued\\". She meets up with Merle again inside a walled up city patrolled by armed gaurds and ruled by a man called \\"Governor\\". This might not be the best season but its a change from at every turn they are killing zombies. Ok, we get it, its the Z-pocalypse. It's been a while now so there has  to be a point things start to \\"heal\\". I think this season we will see that, also the Governor keeps heads in jars and looks at them from time to time (haha!).
B0063GORYU|5.0|The Spider Solitare game is great - really enjoy my Kindle Fire and take it with me whenever I have to wait for anything - WONDERFUL!!!!
B009NH6JRE|5.0|After viewing the second season on blu ray and watching each episode back to back iv'e changed my opinion of the second season. Still so so far the weakest season but season three so far started off running(well, staggering if your'e a zombie) and hasn't looked back. With the intro of the Governor making things more intense and a little more eerie and Ricks group running into zombies and other problems left and right this season(3rd) is def. off the walls awesome and addicting.  Can't wait to see more! And if you haven't seen or started season three your'e in for a treat!
B009YSSDGC|3.0|I was really enjoying this episode until it was time for the \\"Big Reveal\\" -- when the real killer walked up.  Understand: those with a knack for details knew that it was about time for 3XK to show back up, but really, doing it with a long scene full of little more than exposition?  Not even the most narcissistic of characters will explain themselves that neatly and thoroughly.  After that, the episode simply became a chase story.<br /><br />I got the impression that the writers were pressed for time and this was the only way to end the situation without running over.  That's a shame, as the story was complex enough to support making it the Season 5 two-parter.  3XK is also one of only two recurring themes not yet resolved in the series, so it could be justified as the two-parter.<br /><br />I'm glad I saw this, but due to the poor pacing and the writers' decision to take the easy way out of the box they created, the episode leaves me unsatisfied.  Newsflash, writers: this is a show ABOUT A WRITER.  You can't get away with some of the sloppiness that you see elsewhere.
1423140605|5.0|this is a great book, like the rest of the Percy Jackson/Heroes of Olympus books.  It has a cliff hanger ending,(literally) and it is funny.  You learn some interesting things about the characters as well in this one.
B003TH834G|5.0|This episode has it all!  Flirty banter with a bit of physical humor and true sweetness, meta references and geek culture shout-outs galore, some great scenes between Big Castle & Little Castle, a couple things that make you laugh out loud, awesome music, sharp dialogue, and underneath it all, a murder mystery that could break your heart.  What more can you ask?<br /><br />The intent of \\"Castle\\" is to be lighthearted about a subject that is gritty, difficult and often very depressing: murder.  And while watching the show requires a healthy suspension of disbelief, particularly if you know anything about law enforcement protocols, it never becomes so implausible as to be unbelievable.  In this Halloween-themed episode, there are vampires, werewolves and even space cowboys everywhere.  Yet the solution to the murder mystery isn't related to any of them but instead to a tragic family secret.<br /><br />We get to experience a romp through the vampire subculture (with a very light commentary about those who disapprove of such thing), combined with high school Halloween antics both right and wrong (including a beautiful Castle-as-a-grownup moment), and culminating in an adult-themed Halloween party complete with a practical joke that's remarkably clean for a show that airs after 9:00.  Yet there are moments of true sweetness and caring everywhere, and as we watch the murder victim's family crumble it's clear that there are no winners.<br /><br />If I had to pick one episode to show someone to introduce them to Castle, this would be the one.
1451662432|4.0|I was a teenager during the 1980's, meaning I was just the target audience for Mr. Schwarzenegger's movies and I'm not afraid to admit that I loved them then, and I still do.  Conan, The Terminator, The Running Man, Twins, Total Recall, T2, and True Lies are all movies I think still hold up.  Though I never saw myself in the Schwarzenegger mold--I'm too weak & nerdy for that--I had a certain admiration for the type of discipline it takes to turn yourself into the type of physical specimen that he represents.  So I was interested to see what Schwarzenegger had to say about himself.  It is pretty much what I expected.<br /><br />Mr. Schwarzenegger gives us the big picture of his life.  He starts out with his growing up in Austria in the years after the Second World War.  He hints at the strict discipline of his father and his blooming interest in bodybuilding as a teenager.  He describes a stint in the Austrian military and how bodybuilding allowed him to leave the service and, eventually, travel to America.  He talks of his growing success in bodybuilding and his transition to the movies.  He writes of his introduction to Maria Shriver, his marriage, and how he ultimately lands in the governor's office in California.  Then, he closes with the aftermath of his time in office including the scandal of having a son by his housekeeper.<br /><br />Of course, anyone expecting any introspection or self-analysis is going to be disappointed, though why anyone would expect such a thing from Mr. Schwarzenegger is odd.  Over the course of his career, he's never shown himself to be any kind of reflective person.  He is the type of driven personality who always looks forward and only looks back to smile at his successes.  His autobiography is part and parcel to that personality.  It is all sequence of events and drive towards the next achievement.  There is no serious analysis of missteps or true mea culpas.<br /><br />Let's face it, when somebody achieves to the level of Mr. Schwarzenegger it takes a relentlessness that leaves a lot of bodies behind; however, it is a little much to expect him to admit it.  We get hints of it with the way he talks about beating some of his bodybuilding opponents and his initial encounters with people in the movie business like Dino de Laurentis.  There are even small hints of his womanizing though he must leave most of this out, but is it really a surprise that he cheated on Maria?  I suspect there is much we don't know.<br /><br />In any case, Mr. Schwarzenegger is not going to be the one to tell us.  Still, there is a lot about him that I learned through this book.  In particular, I was interested in his process of self-education in America and I learned much more about his surprising business acumen.  What becomes clear, though, as you read this is that a lot of Mr. Schwarzenegger's success can be attributed to working harder (and playing harder) than anyone around him.  As he himself says, it's all about the \\"reps\\".  There's something to that.rzenegger it takes a relentlessness that leaves a lot of bodies behind; however, it is a little much to expect him to admit it.

B009GJBEF6|5.0|This is one of the greatest bond movie I have watched. The chemistry between Michelle Yeoh and Pierce Brosnan added a nice touch of the great plot and great action. The other woman in love with Mr. Bond was very touching. She was truly in love with Bond, even though the wife of the bad guy. I liked that detail. It made this movie more appealing, more human.<br /><br />I love the martial skills of Michelle Yeoh. And Brosnan is the perfect bond--cool, elegant, sweet to women, tough to bad guys. Pierce Brosnan was at his best in this movie.<br /><br />Just a last remark, even though the run away scene was supposed to be in Vietnam, all the signs and writing seen was Chinese. Make it take place in China or Taiwan or another Chinese speaking country if you can't film in Vietnam or don't want to. A little tiny research effort would have been great.
B009S8PEHY|5.0|Rod's scratchy, throaty voice lends itself surprisingly well to Christmas music. The additions of Trombone Shorty (A MUST SEE IN PERSON!), Michael Buble, Chris Botti, Mary J. Blige, Cee-Lo Green, Dave Koz and Ella Fitzgerald (virtually) are true gifts for this holiday season. Be glad Rod has young children once again, because it drove him to release a Christmas CD. Thanks Rod and Happy Holidays!
B004XUMPFQ|5.0|Perfect, from the dialog, character development, story lines, casting, music, special effects, every episode is perfect.  If you love Sci-Fi, westerns, women of mystery, men of action, stories of love, laughter, terror, and battle. If you have the heart of a lion and but the soul of a poet, you will love this series. This series had it all. And you will savoir every episode until the final film \\"Serenity.\\"<br /><br />Perfect.
0307474259|5.0|This book literally changed my life and probably saved it too.  When I first read this book, I weighed over 300 pounds.  In the nine months since, I have already lost 90 pounds and well on my way to my goal weight.  The book doesn't present a diet, it presents a new way to look at food and how it interacts with your biochemistry to make you fat.  The book is well researched and has plenty of science to back up what amounts to simple biology: people no longer eat the way 1,000,000 years of evolution has conditioned them to.  Do yourself a favor and read the book.

B008K5T5AI|5.0|The Hydrogen Sonata deserves six stars for the caniving, scheming, sarcastic and superior intelligence portrayed in the dialogue. Banks is a master at weaving a story filled with a dark and ironic humor, all embroiled in a great &#34;Culture&#34; novel. If only Iain Banks wrote more SciFi, he's so bloody good at it!
B000FC146C|3.0|I love classic book and romance even more but I found this to be a tough one. Partly because I am not from Australia so many of the words were foreign to me. I found that tone frustrating and I had a hard time visualizing characters. The whole love saga with Cardinal Ralph just irritated me. I understand forbidden love but I couldn't stand the way he taunted her feelings.<br /><br />There was a lot of death and sadness which made for a realistic and meaningful read but the worst part of it all the the ending!!<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT<br />The last part of the book I found to be a travesty. The death of Meggi's so was confusing and just unnecessary. Drowning? Really?! The writing before, during, and after that was sketchy. I had to re read the section over and over again because I felt like I was missing something.<br /><br />Basically, if you have a lot of extra time on your hands than go for it but other than that...you're not missing much.

B009IEXKXI|5.0|The Martian is a wonderfully exciting and descriptive book.<br /><br />The main character, Astronaut Mark Watney, thought dead by his crewmates is abandoned on the surface of Mars during a violent storm. Watney, was merely injured and is able to treat himself and rally to survive through his own inventiveness and human spirit.<br /><br />This is a story of survival unlike any other as Watney extends his food supply to over a year until a rescue can be planned and launched.<br /><br />At first I was dismayed as the author fails to portray Watney as despondent over his circumstances but then came to realize that astronauts are the type of people who look at setbacks as a challenge to be overcome...<br /><br />The best line from the book in my opinion:  \\"In space, no one can hear you scream like a little girl!\\"<br /><br />Told from the point of view of the main character, the story is told with compassion and humor in what could otherwise be a very dark novel.<br /><br />Read it now!

I also appreciate the insight into the vision and hard work that was labored in making such works of art as his garments.  I am somewhat of a seamstress/artist and I am aware of the passion and talent that is involved in creating a beautiful garment.  The artistry displayed in those beautiful jackets and costumes that you made for Michael was nothing less that genius.  I truly believe that you and Dennis were placed in Michael's path to be divine extensions of his spiritual creative mission here on earth. I will cherish this book as I do the memory of MJ.

030758836X|5.0|Gillian Flynn's best seller depicts a marriage gone terribly wrong that ignites on its fifth anniversary (July 5, 2012) from a simmering, sinister set of dire circumstances into a criminal investigation.  Diabolical schemes of revenge and spousal annihilation explode this private nightmare into a national feeding frenzy by the media.  The pages turn and the suspense mounts.  A great read!

The story of Gideon and Eva really unfolds in this book. It isn't just about the sex. You really learn so much about both characters in this book and it has you pulling for them throughout the story. Owe and did I mention their is a thrilling mystery in this book as well. The book is a thrill ride complete with Mystery, Drama, Action and Hot Erotica! My wife found me reading the second book and she started to read the first book. By the end of a week she had finished both books. We are both eagerly awaiting the third book in this series.<br /><br />Jack
B0054SMID0|5.0|I enjoyed the plot twists and overall it was very entertaining.  Great cast and well done.  I don't practice law, but even I thought there were times where it required some suspension of disbelief about the way the legal system works.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|Blue ray edition with extras (deleted scenes)is excellent. Photography & special effects were especially well done. Some cut scenes  will probably be restored in a Directors cut. I like the speed at which the dvd arrives and Amazon's customer service.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book is fanominal! I recomend this book to everyone who likes to read. This book is a thriller and an action book all in one.
0062127241|4.0|Who I Am is Pete Townshend's comprehensive memoir commencing with his earliest childhood memories through including a reference to The Who's appearance at the 2012 Summer Olympics.  I consider him to be one of our time's most important musicians and so was hoping for insight as well as entertainment.  Who I Am delivers on entertainment.  Pete is a very engaging writer, and the 500 pages pass quickly.  The detail contained about all facets of his life is astonishing.  He's completely open and honest, sometimes brutally so, about his life and himself.  We get a full accounting of his sex life, his alcohol and drug life, and his lifelong lust for big material payouts, especially recording studios, mansions and yachts.  Some of this gets repetitious but it's his memoir and if he wanted to be exhaustive in these areas, so be it.<br /><br />My disappointment is the relatively short shrift paid to the music.  His songs have had a fundamental impact on my life and I had long awaited how he feels about his own creations.  There are amusing anecdotes about lesser songs, but a great deal of his portfolio is either mentioned in passing or not mentioned at all.  And, as others have mentioned, his treatment of his fellow Who members feels somewhat superficial and glossed over.<br /><br />This is a fine, entertaining memoir; I certainly recommend it, but feel some disappointment it wasn't even better.

B003WUYP56|4.0|Dr. Smolin's characterization of the state of physics is a worthwhile contribution to the public dialog on the status of scientific endeavor.  As with everything else in the world, the power of money has more to do with scientific progress than anything else.  I am glad that Dr. Smolin has made the effort to set down the issues.  The fact that 97% of the content of the universe is unexplained must give any thinking person pause.  Clearly this represents an unprecedented opportunity. To take advantage will require a fresh approach.  \\"The Trouble With Physics\\" presents a perspective on where we are, how we got here, and where a new approach might originate.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Great books! Easy read, perfect for the 12-18 year old readers, but I still enjoyed them. Can't wait to watch the movie and see how it compares to the first book.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This app is loads of fun, especially if you like puzzles.  It never barfs or has any glitches!  I love it.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book was very easy to read, informative and exciting.  Really enjoyed hearing the true story from someone who was actually at the capture.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|The Book explained and tied in other aspects from the other two novels. I am still reading it but look forward to the conclusion.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|good movie. i was very disappointed that stan lee didn't appear until the vewwwwy end.  a lot of witty back and forth. but when jon favreau and joss whesdon are involved, the end product is ngood, funny and nunique.  love the bickering amongst the egoes.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator is awesome and so easy to use. I would certainly recommend this calculator to anyone thinking about it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|For starters, I rely on reviews for most things I buy anywhere so I HAD to write one for this trilogy.  I was NOT a reader before I read these books and I could not put them down.  I read all 3 books in 8 days.  It is my favorite set of books as I have found a new love of reading and I credit E.L. James for this so THANK YOU!  I am a lover of a good love story and the story is FANTASTIC.  I don't care that it's not well edited or the vocabulary is at times redundant....the literary critics can boast all that BUT you will love the story and the characters in this book!!!!  I cannot say enough good things about these books but I can tell you that I have reread them for the third time now as I am reading along with the classical CD!  Whole new experience.  I played the violin for 8 years and love classical music.  I liked that the author included music in the books as I am also a music lover and it brought a lot of my favorite things all together. Thank you E.L. James for writing these books and I look forward to anything else she writes!  You won't be disappointed with these books so get the trilogy!!  I could barely wait to get the second and third books as I did the e-books but then bought the hard copy because I just had to have them!!!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|addicting fun edifying cool adrenalren rush I cant put this game down at all is most addicting game I have eve. played.
B0083EW97W|5.0|I do enjoy listening to this CD.  I like the music and the words.  What more could one ask for!
B00555X8OA|5.0|If you care if you are thinking correctly or if those you listen to are speaking with errorless  judgement, please consider reading this book.  Since everyone of us thinks and responds to our surroundings continuously without ever stopping it behoves us to understand how our thoughts operate and to understand the likelihood of falicies occuring in anyone's thoughts. And this is irregardless of how confident we are about what we think. The reasearch studies provided make this reading interesting, satisfying, and enjoyable, not to mention very instructive as to how we can personally benefit with a new understanding of how good or errorful thoughts (including our own) might really be.
030758836X|4.0|Very fun book- great page-turner.  Loved following the characters even though I wasn't crazy about either of the main characters!  Many twists & turns.

1594744769|4.0|Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children<br />Ransom Riggs<br />Hardcover: 352 pages<br />eBook: 361 pages (Portrait view)<br />Publisher: Quirk Books<br />Publication Date: June 7, 2011<br />eISBN: 978-1-59474-513-3<br />ISBN-13: 978-1-59474-476-1<br />Cover Photograph: Courtesy of Yefim Tovbis<br /><br />  Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children...<br />  Home for Peculiar Children...<br />  Peculiar Children...<br />  The title suggests to me that its pages have to be filled with all things gothic, dark, melancholy, and, for lack of a better word, peculiar. The cover image of a girl floating six inches off the ground grabbed my attention adding an air of mystery and implying that something profound and extraordinary was about to happen. All I had to do was open the book to find out what made these particular children so different. So, I wasted no time in doing just that and found myself wholly fascinated and entertained by the story. Ransom Riggs has created a world of imagination filled with mystery, time loops, magic, monsters, and yes, some very uncommon \\"children.\\" Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is an exceptional novel and I found myself entranced by Riggs's voice and captivated by the notion that something ominous was about to happen every time I turned a page. It's a remarkable story that blends a murder mystery, a quest motif, and a coming-of-age tale with the supernatural to create a masterful piece of lasting fantasy. The story is intelligent and engrossing and filled with old sepia-toned photographs that depict unfamiliar and titillating characters situated in not-quite-natural poses or evocative scenes. My curiosity became piqued the moment I saw them. The photos were strange but somehow made sense. They begged examination. They filled gaps. They complimented the story. And they helped to explain that \\"peculiar spirits\\" still walk the Earth.<br /><br />  Jacob, a 16 year old American, has listened to his grandfather's tall-tales for years but attributes the chilling stories of cunning monsters and strange characters to his grandfather's unusual experience as a World War II orphan. (After losing his family to the Nazis Grandpa Abe was shipped off to England where he found himself a ward of Miss Peregrine on the tiny island of Cairnholm off the coast of Wales.) One day Jacob receives a panicked, confused call from his grandfather and rushing off to find out what's happened he discovers his grandfather bleeding and dying in the woods behind his home. His last words, \\"September 3rd, 1940.... Emerson... Find the bird in the loop...\\" are a mystery to Jacob but as his grandfather's life fades away his flashlight reveals the hideous face of a monster lurking in the woods. Jacob realizes that his grandfather's stories were not fabrications after all and he knows that his world will never be the same. When he finds a letter written to his grandfather by Miss Peregrine Jacob knows he must find out who, or what, killed him and why. Using the excuse that visiting the island would ease the trauma Jacob convinces his psychiatrist and his family to let him visit the \\"Home\\" where his grandfather spent his childhood. Once in Wales, with his dad in tow as chaperone, Jacob stumbles upon a group of very unusual children. He learns that his grandfather's stories were more truth than fantasy and that he is not as common as he once thought. The world he lived in was never at all what it seemed. Miss Peregrine and the children, hidden in a time loop for the better part of sixty years, are being hunted by monsters and it falls on Jacob's shoulders to protect them at all cost.<br /><br />  Recommended for time travel buffs, psychological horror fans, murder mystery aficionados, fantasy lovers, Young Adult fans, or anyone looking for an interesting or \\"peculiar\\" read. Also recommended for fans of Theodore Sturgeon's More Than Human or Zena Henderson's \\"People\\" stories.<br /><br />4 ½ out of 5 stars<br /><br />The Alternative<br />Southeast Wisconsin<br /><br />A word (or three) about the peculiar photographs -<br /><br />  Ransom Riggs came up with the idea for Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children after stumbling upon a number of \\"found\\" vintage photographs. Mixed throughout the book are many of these unusual, sometimes spectral, sepia-toned images. Hoax, \\"Spirit\\", and fake photographs were mass-distributed around the turn of the last century as a means to gain popularity or make money and have been around almost as long as the art of photography. That so many of them survive is a testament to those who collect and preserve them. The images presented in the novel are suggestive of a bizarre nature or contain an illusion-like oddity or uncommon scene and as I continued to read I looked forward to seeing more of them. There was something compelling and altogether eerie about every image and I wanted to meet the characters shown in them and hear their individual stories. Riggs integrated the unrelated images into the novel perfectly fitting them together like the pieces of a puzzle. A woman in period clothes holding a parasol became Miss Peregrine, an old subway tunnel became the entry to a time loop, and so on. As the story unfolded in his imagination Riggs started searching for similar photos. He went to swap meets and flea markets and was allowed access to photographic collections to search for more \\"peculiar\\" images to help propel the story forward. The afterward contains a listing of all the images used and the collections they're from. In an interview, Riggs told fans that he's compiled a huge backlog of additional images for a sequel. I, for one, can't wait to see what the next installment brings us.ative<br />Southeast Wisconsin<br /><br />A word (or three) about the peculiar photographs -<br /><br />  Ransom Riggs came up with the idea for Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children after stumbling upon a number of \\"found\\" vintage photographs.

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This was a free game. I really love it.  It is amazingly addictive.  I can't stop playing it. And my daughter hates it becsuse it's her game.
B0007LXPBI|4.0|great movie to enjoy with family and it arrived quickly with no problem.  never have any problems with this distributor.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It's a great game but when you try to purchase coins or anything in the store the screen blacks out.
B00628RVV0|5.0|The movie did a very good job of showing the emotion, thoughts and attitudes in the Holocaust situation.  The ending is very gripping and heart wrenching.
B008673ZAQ|3.0|This is the second book in the crossfire series and I was looking so forward to this book - not to have any spoilers - but it was disappointing to say the least-  some important loose ends from the first book were just brushed over and rushed, I don't know where she will go from here, for the 3rd book - I didn't really feel there was a whole lot of loose ends left - I would have given this book another star, but felt the price was too much - I bought a kindle to get away from the high price of books and then this one comes out a lot higher than most kindle books - I really contemplated not getting it.. but since the author doesn't allow it to be loaned then I had to break down and buy it, but my feelings are the first book was much better and usually on sequels they get better and better...
034580404X|5.0|They came as promised and I couldnt wait to start reading them. They were so worth the wait and money. Great books and a very good read .
B001GCUNYO|5.0|Awesome movie.  Liam Neeson does a great job in the action scenes.  This movie keeps you tied in till the last and hoping for a second one, which they made.
B0083Z614S|5.0|This book is a classic.  It describes a magical connection between children and the natural world.  It is easy to read.  Highly recommended.
B0091REZMW|4.0|this is a good free game although sometimes a little confusing. I would recommend it to friends of mine. good luck.
B00913DPW2|1.0|Maybe I should'be given more time but games really shouldn't annoy people so fast. If it had been fun or any reward after the first minute then maybe I would've but no, I gave up and decided to post a review, which I never do. I feel compelled to knock the Developers fake reviews down because I'm reading that people have to resort to printing out walk throughs yet STILL give up because its just not fun. Make games FUN! Is it that hard really?
0756666937|5.0|If you're a fan of his previous books then you'll treasure this one as well.  It arrived in pristine shrink-wrapped condition and I've purchased a second copy as a collectible.  Legos are immortal.  The images just come to life-I spent an entire day mesmerized with Lego creations. This book is suitable for any age group.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book that's all I can say! Can hardly wait to read the next one. If its anything like this one it will be stunning.
B00932H7FW|5.0|This is even better than 24.  The best TV show that I have seen.  Not to be missed. It really holds your attention and keeps you thinking.
B009H7SCMA|5.0|I like this book. It's great as adult novels go, and it ranks up there in the comedy category, too. You will read about some sexy interplay involving cricket matches and of course the indefatigable cricket balls, which result in much punning humor. A must for those who like comedy and adult humor in books.
B0098460O4|5.0|Jonathan and Charlotte's \\"Together\\" cd is going to take the world by storm!  Jonathan's rich tenor voice is accompanied beautifully by Charlotte's pure soprano. These two 17 year old teenagers have a deep, caring, friendship and love of music. Their voices evoke strong emotions in the listener which brings many to tears. \\"Together\\" is truly AMAZING!
B0098VYCCE|2.0|I rented this video with great anticipation; but, even the beautiful Charlise Theron couldn't save the Movie.  Kristen Stewart was her same one-dimentional actor who spent most of the movie with her mouth hanging open (just like she did in the Twilight Saga movies) and next to no emotion registering on her face.  I really wanted to like this movie, and I really wanted to see Kristen Stewart in a different arena than vampires and werewolves, but she just didn't deliver.
1401937519|5.0|This book really open a path to me to understand what really mean to walk in this world. Anita had an amaizing experience, which in agree to her own word, it is to \\"hard\\" to explain with world. SO as she i tried to meditate about her experience and take into my life the goodness to be alive and being love!

B004XUMPFQ|5.0|When I first heard about Firefly, and it being a sci-fi space western.. thing, I was skeptical to say the least. After watching a few episodes though, I instantly got hooked and Firefly remains one of my favorite television shows of all time - despite it's brief time with us. I like the fact that they eventually came out with a movie to appease the fans but I can't help but wonder what future seasons may have brought us.<br /><br />If you're a diehard sci-fan addict, like myself, check it out. You won't be disappointed!
B003VWU2WA|1.0|The product looked great, worked great, for about an hour. Then the knob that you turn fell off. I can see glue residue inside of the knob but I cannot believe it just fell off. Extremely upset. I am going to try and super glue it on today. Hopefully it works...<br /><br />Also all of the problems that I have read seem like easy fixes: 1) the program has to stay open in order for it to work. 2) the program has to be programmed to your PowerMate. 3) You can set this button to do any kind of function with a range of motions you just have to tweek that and your sensitivity settings.<br /><br />If the button had not fallen apart it would have gotten a 5* rating...
B00992CF6W|1.0|this game does not want to download on to my kindle and I have paid twice for this game!!!!!what can I do??
B000059T1E|5.0|John Barleycorn Must Die is by far Traffic's best album. They were hitting on all cylinders from the start. Glad, Freedom Rider and Empty Pages cannot be separated in my mind. It is perhaps the greatest opening of any album. Steve Winwood was like Dr. John, Eric Clapton and some black blues singer all rolled into one.<br /><br />Many past and current bands have tried to replicate the pastoral vibe of the title track with varying degrees of success. I think Paul Weller's Wild Wood (1993) album come the closest.<br /><br />Get the version that has 11 (8 studio and 3 live) tracks.<br /><br />[DW]
B005LAIHYU|4.0|I didn't know what to expect from such a movie.  When I grew up we were taught about Abraham Lincoln in such a way as to believe he was the epitome of the most honest and strong leader we ever had in some of the most difficult times our country has ever endured.  The twist in this movie still portrays Abe in a similar light but also one in which he is one of the few humans who knows about vampires and one of the even fewer who is a vampire hunter/slayer.<br /><br />The twist in the civil war is that it is not just a battle to free the slaves but to free them from the vampires who rule the south.  If the South wins we become a nation ruled by vampires and if the North wins we become a nation ruled by humans.  The special effects are good and the acting is not bad.  My wife is reading the book and she told me that the movie moves at the speed of light when compared to the book and it breezes over a lot of the issues.  The action sequences just took over the storyline and the movie to make it as exciting as possible.<br /><br />They have rewritten history to make an entertaining movie.  We both enjoyed the movie and we give it 4 stars.
B00846REIS|4.0|I found that since this book was so similar to 50 Shades the first half of the book was a little hard to get through, but once you pushed through, it did get better.  I also thought that the \\"intimate\\" scenes were a little more realistic.  I was also a victim of child abuse and I felt a better connection with the main characters then probably some readers who have no experience with that at all.  Overall it was a good book, but I liked the 2nd book in the series better.
B00913DPW2|4.0|Game play:<br />In this game you are getting clues and looking for various objects and tools that will help you to rid the house of ghosts.  You collect tools and they are added to your collection.  If you win you can close the portal that allows the ghosts to enter the house.  Sometimes you need to solve a puzzle to move on in the game.  Some items are well hidden and hard to find.  You also have to figure out how and when to use the tool to your advantage to progress through the game.<br /><br />You can collect moths and they are added to your inventory on the left of the screen.  Taping the hint button uses one of your moths as payment and if you are still having difficulty there is a walkthrough link to the web which will help you to solve the problem.  I used several moths as I played the game.<br /><br />Many of the screens in the game are quite dark and turning up the brightness of the screen can help you to find objects.  Just don't forget that you did turn it up as it consumes your battery faster.  Collect puzzle pieces in each room you enter. The game is tedious and you are trying to find very small details.<br /><br />I found several items like a safe and a locked box with a mechanism but I had no idea of how to I open them.  Even the clues are ambiguous and such clues like listen for the click that you can't hear were not very helpful.  There was one room that contained a coin on the floor that I could not pick up multiple times.  When I went back to the room I was able to pick it up on the first try.<br /><br />Home page:<br />* Play game<br />* Game options - set music and FX volume, skip puzzle button, how to play and information with credits and link to their web site<br />* More games takes you to Amazon and allows you to purchase their games<br /><br />What I like:<br />The graphics are very good and the sound effect and music are mysterious and well done.  I like these types of games as they make you think and work at winning or achieving the final goal.  This one is challenging and interesting to play but frustrating at the same time.<br /><br />I had to stop myself from playing just to write this review.  It opened and played well on my Kindle Fire without any issues.<br /><br />What I don't like:<br />You cannot pan and zoom in the rooms which make finding some small items difficult.<br /><br />I found three links to the web so turn off your WIFI if you let your kids play the game.  I also found numerous fake reviews and out of 100 reviews when I started at least 20 of them were fake and some written by the app developers themselves.<br /><br />The game contains several permissions that are borderline dangerous.  They can either be used for benign purposes or to link your device ID and to track your phone calls.<br /><br />Summary:<br />While the game is intense and fun to try to find objects the lack of a pan and zoom feature makes the game more difficult to play.  It does give you the feature of continuing a game in progress which is good but if someone else plays the game you will lose your progress history if they start over.  The graphics are very good but dark so turn up your brightness of your screen.<br /><br />It can be difficult to pick up items at some times and you may have to go back later to try it.  I don't know why but that seemed to work.  The clues are just another piece of the puzzle which is fine but you had better remember them as you search the house for inventory items.  This game is very time consuming and not a quick five minutes of playing style of game.  You will have to like this type of challenging game and have a lot of patience and determination.<br /><br />The game graphics are 5 stars and the game play is between a 4 and a 5 star but difficulty is pretty high.  I don't like all of the self-reviews of the game.  The permissions can be risky so you have to make the choice of whether you want to keep the game or not.  I am on a Kindle Fire so my risk is lower as I do no banking, contact lists or call anyone on the tablet but if you have a smart phone you have to make a choice.<br /><br />I rate the game as a 4 star game.<br /><br />Size: This game is a massive 76.01 MB which makes it one of the largest games I own.  It consumes a lot of memory.<br /><br />Permissions:<br />* Network communication - full internet access<br />* Kindle calls - read network state and identity<br />* Network communication - vie network state<br />* Hardware controls - control vibratorng, contact lists or call anyone on the tablet but if you have a smart phone you have to make a choice.<br /><br />I rate the game as a 4 star game.<br /><br />Size: This game is a massive 76.01 MB which makes it one of the largest games I own.

B007SGM084|1.0|The Trilogy book was never downloaded to me kindle, The fifty shades darker book 2 was downloaded. which I did not order book two.<br /><br />Thank you
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it id very good. I like it a lot. great time waster. I like how u have to get a score to get points.
B007SGM084|4.0|It kinda reads like a movie script. Weird editing led me to believe that it was either missing pieces, was a movie script that couldn't be made or someone was trying to be innovative. Not too smutty that it's unacceptable. However, if I were to watch this in a movie I would be called a perv for watching x rated stuff. I find it amusing that those very people are so quick to read and enjoy these books. That being said I did like it and I'm not trying to knock it. It's editing worked and all 3 of the books were a quick read. Very entertaining. My wife and I both read it and we recommend that you do too.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Entertaining, but didn't like as much as books 1 & 2.<br />Ending was blah, expected better from this author. Done
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This is a set of books I would recommend to adults who are comfortable with sexuality. The storyline is flows from the first book to the last and makes them an easy read.
0316228532|1.0|J. K. Rowling is such an accomplished author but in my opinion \\"Casual\\" did not live up to her previous efforts. I struggled the whole way through and in fact had to put it down and read something else for a while. For me, the characters never came alive like in her Harry Potter series and they never had the persona's that would keep me reading.<br /><br />None of her previous wit, wisdom, team building and charm came through in \\"Casual\\". I just felt like J.K. was trying to hard to be to over the top and sophisticated with this writing. Therefore, I would only give it one star. I'm sure there are many who might disagree but I surely would not want to buy another novel of this type and struggle through that reading as well.<br /><br />David
B009CPJHY4|1.0|Was really disappointed as the trailer made it look so good, I wouldn't recommend.  I watch alot of movies and this just didn't gel.
B0018PH3L0|5.0|This is the best western I have ever seen and I am still feeling the dust and sweat of the cattle drive.I have just read the book by Larry McMurtry and the mini series screenplay is almost word for word.Jones and Duvall are superb<br />and the supporting cast excellentThis is the third time I have watched this film (twice before on TV).Great!
B002SRQ214|5.0|This is a must have for a low budget gamer! also the price is great for the average person, i personally love this item~!!~
B00881VLCE|4.0|The best puzzle app I've found. Love the difficulty levels; love that you can choose to have pieces come out properly oriented or do it yourself. I had trouble with lost puzzles (downloaded them but they did not show up on my menu). Uninstalled and reinstalled the app and started over. Likely won't be buying puzzles for that reason (lots of free ones available).

B009CYI9ZS|4.0|I've been waiting for a new Killers CD to come out.  I have to say, I think they must have used producers from Brandon Flowers' CD \\"Flamingo\\".  There are many songs on here that remind me of his solo CD, and only a few that may be labeled as true \\"Killers\\" music.  The last CD \\"Day and Age\\" was such a good mix of their new style and old - it was a wonderful work.  The theme scattered amongst many of the songs of the \\"Battle Born\\" CD is almost apologetic lyrics to whom???  \\"Flesh and Bone\\" is a good opening tune, \\"Miss Atomic Bomb\\" has a catchy rhythm, Track 5 \\"A Matter of Time\\", I believe is the closest sound that matches any from their \\"Sam's Town\\" cd.  \\"Runaways\\" is similar to the solo track \\"Crossfire\\", but if you're listening on a good quality sound system, the music is a good pop/rock/techno mix.  The more I listen, the better I like it.  Gotta roll with the changes I guess.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|Like the other 2 books, this is also difficult to put down. Once you've picked it up you have to read it to the end.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Great Movie, fun to watch with the whole family. Excellent combo pack. It comes with Digital Copy which I think it's better than the Ultraviolet combo that some studios offer.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Great movie.  The movie had everything a comic fan could want in a story about the Avengers.  It was also a lot more funny than I would have guessed.  The Hulk really stole the show.  \\"We have a Hulk\\"  Great line.
B007IX383I|4.0|Old Prog Lover here is new to Anathema. After reading other reviews I decided to check them out as it appears they have gone through a bit of a transition over the last few years, moving away from post metal to more of a crossover prog sound, not unlike Mostly Autumn and The Reasoning (the comparisons deserve mention due to Anathema's female vocalist Lee Douglas)<br /><br />Well, as profanity is frowned upon at Amazon I can only state that after my first listen I thought: \\"What the ---- did I just hear?! After I picked my jaw up off of the floor and listened to \\"Weather Systems\\" a second time, I realized that not only had my ears NOT deceived me, but my initial impression was correct. This work totally and completely blew me away! The music on WS virtually soars. What struck me right off was the superb vocals of Vincent Cavanaugh and Lee Douglas. Man! Can they sing! Their vocals bring an intensity to the music on Weather Systems that sent chills down my spine.  TIP: Listen to it LOUD!<br /><br />Props have to go to a reviewer (AccessDenied?)who mentioned it plays best if considered as one continuous piece of music. I down loaded it and took out all the pauses between tracks. It plays like a contemporary symphony with movements and crescendos. A stunning piece of work. Put this in the same category as Sylvan's masterpiece \\"Posthumous Silence\\" and Dream Theater's \\"Metropolis Part 2\\" where the work may be played as a whole yet still have the individual songs stand easily on their own. Like the two above mentioned works, WS moves between quieter moments, will bring in strings for a bit more of a symphonic sound yet still not be afraid to thrash out a bit to lend a harder edge to the music. Example: \\"The Storm Before The Calm\\" is a powerfull cacophony of sound that while sounding a bit discordant at first has powerful layers of instumentation that convey the power of a storm. Again, I cannot say enough about the voices of Cavanaugh and Douglas. I usually tend to write off vocals as so many times they must take a back seat in progressive music, either because the vocalist is weak or the emphasis is on the music. Not with Anathema. These two MAKE you sit up and take notice!<br /><br />If I have to say anything negative I would have to admit that at times the lyrics are a bit simple and repetitive but do get enhanced by the powerful vocal performance. And the final song, \\"Internal Landscapes\\" is a bit slow to get started with the \\"near death experience\\" spoken word dialogue at the beginning, but manages to build to end the work on a solid ending crescendo.<br /><br />I have been encouraged by other reviews to check out the previous release \\"We're Here Because We're Here\\", and samples I have heard so far are encouraging. For those of you who enjoy the sound of Anathema with the female vocals you may wish to check out an almost unknown group \\"Filtered By The Sky\\"[[ASIN:B00CX7UQPW Filtered By the Sky]]Where powerful electric guitar is juxtaposed with chello as lead instruments.<br /><br />I don't think \\"Weather Systems\\" is going to be a \\"one off\\" for Anathema. This may well prove to be their direction for the future. If so, I'm all in! Not quite a 5 but a solid 4 1/2 stars.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game it has pretty good graphics but it can jack up your kindle fire but still I absolutely. love tthis game
B0094OLFUW|4.0|I bought both albums together and put them on shuffle play so it sounds like one continuess album. Throughly enjoying!!!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This is the second time I have read this book!  In fact I have read all of Garth Stein's books and hopefully he is working on another.  I highly recommend this to anyone, doesn't matter if you aren't into dogs or racing (Of course, I'm into both so I couldn't go wrong).
B007UPNA6Y|4.0|No explanation of his survival in Nebraska but he fights on in his inimitable style. Plenty of suspense and back on the road before the law catches on. Continuing the saga.
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|This is an incredible album, my absolute favortie of all time! It's a masterpiece! I am obsessed with this album. the songs have a mysterious mood . absolutely amazing.
B009G8GRX6|4.0|This album is great; I love the music, which still retains the musicality and soaring vocals from Matt Bellamy that have consistently made Muse wonderful.
0061900656|5.0|This book was good for explaining baby. When my 21 month old was going to be a big brother I was a little nervous of how he would do with a baby. I often would read a shortened &#34;mommy version&#34; to him. the pictures are sweet and easy to explain. I think this book would be good for older toddlers too. Now my oldest is 3 he still picks this book to read and helps him understand how being a big brother is special.
B008YZXYY2|1.0|Other than \\"Absolute Zero\\", this is just generic radio music.  Very boring CD, breaks no new ground, sounds like leftovers from something from 10 years ago.  Corey needs to quit wasting his time with this garbage and get back to putting out a new Slipknot CD.<br /><br />By the way, it's obvious the band or the record company is coming out here and putting out a short 5-star ratings every day with the same short drivel text.
B0085PFG1U|5.0|I tried different graphing calculators for kindle fire and this is the best one I found. $5 is good pricing for it. It's easy to use and looks great. Glad I found this.
B009VB97EY|2.0|If you saw Showgirls and liked that movie, you'd probably like this one as well.  Unfortunately, I thought this movie was terrible.  The actors in this movie have WAY too much talent to be in such a bad film.
B008WCP2PG|1.0|Badly done movie. How did they make a male stripper movie boring? It's like The Last Airbender meets the awkward scenes in Twilight...and then of course the only good things in this film were the dancing scenes. BAD movie. Regret buying it.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|As usual the great quest continues...Can't get enough of these demi-gods....Only wish I didn't have to wait another whole year for the installment!
B00931JMRE|5.0|BEST ZZ TOP IN 25 YEARS. La Futura<br />BRINGS ME BACK TO THE GOOD OLD DAYS WITH THE THAT LITTLE OL BAND FROM TEXES
B006LSZECO|3.0|I was totally into this book until about 90% into it.  I was so disappointed with the ending that I just stared at the page.  I wonder why the author wrote such an interesting story and then didn't bother to come up with a well written ending.  Planning a sequel maybe?
B0054JZC6E|4.0|ive downlanded this app to all my devices and have my friends atticted too! now we are in competetion to see who beats it first!
B007MB5OCE|5.0|If the title makes you smile, the story will make you laugh out loud.  What a great storyline.  The author was masterful at weaving Allan's past into the present.  Will not disappoint. Didn't want the story to end, but the ending was as perfect as the beginning.
B0091QSNEE|5.0|I have three kids ages 6, 4 and 2.  They all enjoy playing this app.  You can seat the animals and then prepare what they want to eat. Really easy for kids to use but interesting enough to keep them occupied.  I even had fun trying it.  Its sometimes hard to seat the animals and then select the meal to prepare. You have to tap on it several times to get it to work. Other than that definately worth the money. They play it all the time.
B009329ZF2|5.0|I laughed. I whooped, hollered & cheered. I don't think I had as much fun with a movie since the first Starwars movie. Thoroughly entertaining.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Very Interesting and intriguing book.  I call it a book but I read it on my e-Pad.  The author does a fine job drawing you into the emotional instability of the leading girl with all her innocence who is drawn to a shady (pun) character who uses her for his own deprivations. Sexual excitement flowing into complete explicit abandonment.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I love these headphones. I purchased a pair for my daughter and I accidently broke them. I purchased another set for her and a set for me. I purchased this set as a back up since I am having a hard time finding them. They are so light and don't budge when I work out.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The trilogy was a great read. The sex is just part of what drives 'fify shades'. The psychological side of the story is what makes it an awesome read. I could not put the books down and now that I am done with them I still continue to wonder what the characters are doing and are they making it! It hooks the reader for sure!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game it is very fun. there are so many fun games to play. overall I love it.:)
B006LSZECO|5.0|Good book to bread.  Kept me guessing.  was different than Iexpected for sure.  Can't wait to read more from author.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|My three year old daughter loves this and it helps us all<br /> tune out our noisy apartment complex and sleep.
B008ACC9CM|5.0|Amazing!!  You will fall in love with Jonathan and Charlotte!  I cannot tell you how much I have enjoyed their journey from their start on BGT this year.  I listen to their CD every single day and never tire of it. Their music is beautiful, Charlotte sings like a bird and Jonathan with his strong voice sends shivers down your spine.  You will love this CD!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|a beautiful way to audio stream the lords word. definately check this out.  the variety of plans and programs it offers is staggering.
B0084IHVGG|4.0|The Aristocats is a pretty darn good Disney movie.  It is funny and has some good songs.  Reminds me of 101 Dalmations a little bit.  Great fun for all ages.
030758836X|4.0|First of all, I would like to say that I didn't much care for the ending, either. That being said, that doesn't mean that it wasn't a good book just because you didn't like the ending. The writing was wonderful and the plot was very creative. Even though I didn't like the ending, it was nice to read a book that wasn't predictable. I don't believe it is fair to rate a book \\"one star\\" just because you didn't like the way it ended.
0385535147|5.0|While there are some aspects that might stretch the imagination just a bit, isn't that the idea?  It's a story -  a thorougly enjoyable, engrossing, can't-put-it-down story.  I actually considered limiting myself to a few chapters a day to try and make it last, but failed, and as always, the end came too soon.<br /><br />This is Grisham doing what he does best.
1401322786|3.0|This came right on time. As for the book it was not the best of the Mitch Albom books that is for sure. I was rather disappointed in it. May give it another read down the road but compared to the rest of his books I'd have to put this one at the bottom. This however will not stop me from reading any future books of Mitch Albom, I liked it enough.
B004JMSIRC|5.0|IT WAS FUN TO WATCH AND ROBERT DOWNEY WAS THE PERFECT FOR THE ROLE OF TONY STARK AKA IRON MAN.
B00499K9E0|5.0|There are lots of Sherlocks.  This is the best ..... great cinematography, script, casting, direction, and easy to relate to.
B0095R6OBS|5.0|My daughter absolutely loved this movie when she was young. I reminded her of it, then bought it here so she could watch it again. Her response after watching it, at the age of 21 - \\"And now I know why I loved it so much!\\" It is a very cute spoof of the Frankenstein story.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|I love Tina Fey and her humor. This is just a refreshing read to sit back and enjoy.  It was fun to hear some back stage stories from her shows.
B008PCVGKI|5.0|Ben Goldacre presents us an astonishing non fictitious view of the dangers bad science incurs and the people behind it.A must read for everyone. Try Bad Science too, excellent reading!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I really liked the writing style of this novel as it went back and forth with each character's view of the situation.  It was very intriging and I wasn't sure where it was headed and it kept me coming back for more.  But I was so disappointed at the ending.  I guess I like things wrapped up in a neat package at the end.  This would be a good book for a book club as there would be lots to discuss at the end.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|Saw this movie in the theater and wanted it to complete my Alien collection by Ridley Scott. Blu-ray sound is great on a surround sound system
0062068423|2.0|If you can get through the first half of the book, the last half is much better.  I suggest you jot down the names of people and places while reading the first half as they do not show up again for awhile and by the time they do the difficult and similar names may leave you confused.  After reading this book, I have absolutely no desire to ever visit Norway.  I did learn some history of Norway during WWII leaving me with a distaste for the people of Norway.  The plot was somewhat clever in the end, but so it is in many other mysteries without all the difficult names and poor translation (kerb for curb, etc)(sentences without verbs that you can read over twenty times and make no sense)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is awesome!!!! I can only play games for no more then half an hour but I find myself playing this one for close to 2 hours. I love how there are new missions everytime you finish one and the daily challenges are great. the more I play it,  the better I get and thst makes me want to play it even more!
B004UID2LC|1.0|App -Killed or crashed my kindle fire. This app sucks. I would suggest not to download this stupid app. Thank you for your time!!!
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Steve Jobs was a maniac and a really smart man! The bio is detailed and lets you in on the so many different facets of a man who made history and will remain a source of inspiration for entrepreneurs for generations to come!<br />It tells you that the biggest lesson of it all is to stay with your gut! When you feel strongly about something, go all out and take a stand, defy the odds. Surround yourself with smart people that are going to help you grow. People who are not just thinking about getting themselves ahead of everybody else, but people who care for the product, the company.<br />Dare to envision and  keep working till you get there!
B008JH5CVS|3.0|Just not outstanding on any particular point. Effects were up to snuff. Mix of acting quality. A little brutal. Kind of weak plot.
B005LAIGWS|4.0|At least they caught the spirit of the Ghost Rider. Nicolas on the edge of a nervous breakdown just didn't do it with the movie. And having the rider save the son of statan, a street smart but overall good kid was not a plot that worked. I'd rather have the Rider go after Damien, a cute but evil son of satan. Overall, not one of the better Marvel movies. Loved the computer generated animation, not the script.
B007UXSPK2|4.0|Pretty good. I can't quite put my finger on it but this one had a slightly different feel. Not so twisty a plot line perhaps. solid action and effects as always. The actor who played the lead in the new Borne movie was in this too and clearly the hand-to-hand action abilities are a trend. Worth seeing definitely.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I LOVE CHRISTIAN GREY! I RECOMEND THESE BOOKS TO ALL MY FRIEND AND ALMOST ALL MY FRIENDS HAVE READ THEM AND LOVED THEM. I LOVE HOW CHRISTIAN LOVES ANA. EVERY WOMAN WOULD LOVE TO HAVE THAT THEMSELVES. I HOPE SHE DOES WRITE A FOURTH BOOK AND THE MOVIES ARE EXACTLY LIKE THE BOOKS.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|Will not allow me to connect with facebook.  I can play as a guest but I'm at level 90 on facebook really din' want to have to start all over.  Getting the same message as the other reviewers below.  Please help us get connected so we can enjoy bingo blitz. Love the game on facebook but got to rate this liw because it does not work properly.
0439023491|5.0|INCREDIBLE. I have never felt so attached to a character before. I was completely emotionally involved. They are easy reads so I finshed all three in a few days. WOW! Everyone should read them! I'm reading the 2nd & 3rd books again before the films come out. =)
1250007305|2.0|Are you afraid of the internet? Are you afraid of Muslims? Do you think they're all wealthy, lust driven, oversexed patriarchs? Are you afraid they want to kill all Americans for amorphous reasons like that they just hate America (for no discernible reason other than that Americans have an apparently benign but substantial international influence)? If so, THIS IS THE BOOK FOR YOU!<br /><br />If you can stomach that nonsense it's a reasonably well-done thriller.
B0071BGOJC|5.0|I read Fall of Giants the first in this trilogy and it was very good, this bookis even better. I look forward to the third book.
B006C1DH92|5.0|Very fun to slice all the fruits and it is also fun to earn the different \\"weapons\\".<br />Way better than the regular fruit ninja
