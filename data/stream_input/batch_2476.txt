B006VFLIYK|5.0|Baldacci's newest hero is really an anti-hero.  I would seem difficult to turn a cold blooded killer into a hero, but Baldacci does just that.  The interact between Robie, his teen age side kick, and the Super FBI agent is a tale well told.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|Fits like a glove.  Seems to be quite durable after several months of use.  My only minor complaint is that the notch used to prop the Kindle up for movie watching isn't quite deep enough and the device is easily displaced.  Not a deal breaker if you are careful not to bump it while watching a movie.<br /><br />Overall, very pleased with this cover.
B005LAJ17M|5.0|WOW!  intriguing series..... can't wait for second season!!  I liked the acting and story lines. Conflicting characters and subplots keep up my interest to see what is next.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|Love these two performers singing together. Easy listening with a great selection of songs to listen to while on a road trip.
B005HEVBGG|4.0|I am an original Trekkie, and I enjoy anything that is related to Star Trek.  Watching this series on my Kindle is so much easier than setting up a DVD player.
B00BB8SKPW|3.0|It's a decent piece on functional alchoholism in our society. I don't know how accurate it is, but it all seemed pretty realistic. It shows how good Washington is that he could carry something like this.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a great book to use on any kindle, you can look up the scripture chapters very quickly. I use it for my Sunday school lessons, less flipping thru pages, and I can sit any place to do it. I would highly recommend this bible. It is free also.
B00688628M|5.0|Really outstanding acting, especially Damien Lewis. A history lesson on the sacrafices average guys made for their families, their country, and the world.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is far from being a \\"typical cancer book.\\" The characters are witty and 3-dimensional. You are just as likely to smile than you are to cry during reading this book.
B000G1ALRK|5.0|This CD is fantastic.  He is one talented singer...can't wait for more CDs...you'll feel the same I'm sure  Love this guy
B005J0VPNC|3.0|Ok I LOVE this app.  Only problem so far is that after recording a video. ...  I send it to friends via e mail....  they can't open them to see what they are... : (  says they need a WebM player?  Will downloading that work. U hate to tell them to download this just for my video...  any other fix within the app available...  PLEASE HELP ME DEVELOPER!  Will give it 5 stars when this is &quot;fixed?&quot;
B000OZ0NXA|2.0|While the book was likeable enough overall, there are all sorts of little incongruities that really should have been dealt with better by an author that is supposed to be writing a mystery.<br /><br />An example, that is not really a spoiler.<br /><br />The protagonist takes note of something, which bothers him, and others in the novel have taken notice of it and commented on it as well.  The something in question is described as \\"handwritten serial numbers in a printed rectangle\\", but what catches people's attention is that they are LONG handwritten serial numbers.<br /><br />We find out later on that, due to circumstances that will become obvious later, that these serial numbers would always, without fail, have to be either five digits long, or six digits long.  No other length would be possible.<br /><br />A six-digit number being handwritten is not something that I (or anyone I know of) would describe as a \\"long handwritten serial number\\"... let alone have the fact that it's a whopping six digits maximum be treated as so odd that I would both notice it and comment on it.  It's necessary for a plot point, but it completely DOES NOT WORK.<br /><br />As serial numbers go, it's hard to imagine something much shorter than 5 or 6 digits being workable unless the item in question was a collectible or limited-edition, and the item in this case is the exact opposite.  I'd call six digits rather on the short side, actually, given the item.<br /><br />It's deus ex machina for the story and revelation to proceed, but it clearly was not well thought-out.
B000FA5TTW|3.0|wen i started getting near the end of the book i was less interested in it. but at the begining i felt like i was actually there.
B008PE9GSA|5.0|It was worth the wait.  From the lead song &#34;I GOTSTA GET PAID&#34; right on through &#34;HAVE A LITTLE MERCY&#34;, the tres hombres are all over it.  A must buy for any ZZ Top fan and a must hear before joining the guys on tour this summer.
B005S9EK5Y|3.0|I've been a BIG fan of the musical since the late 1980's. Ever since then I was wondering whether it would ever be made into a film. Now it has happened I have to say I'm really disappointed with the final result. For those who like the film and have not seen the stage musical, please do yourself a favour and go see it in its true original form!<br /><br />The concept of whispering/talking songs live throughout the film was mis-conceived and does not capture the spirit of the LIVE show. During the live shows I would have goosepimples nearly every 10 mins. During the film I had goosepimples twice....once at the open credits/ ship scene and then Empty Chairs at Empty Tables.<br /><br />My most disappointing part of the film was the casting of the Thenardiers. Cohen especially was awful in his role and one of the showstoppers of the musical \\"Master of the House\\" was poorly sung/acted and badly edited!<br /><br />Another part I really disliked was the final scene. On stage the ghosts of those that died, return in a mist to sing the finale of Do you hear the people sing with Valjean and Fantine. Spinetingling stuff. In the film we return to the barricade to see everyone appearing to mime to a limp finale of  \\"Do you hear the people sing\\".<br /><br />\\"To-morrow comes!!\\" never sounded so bland!<br /><br />It's still gets 3 stars, as...well..it's Les Mis!  and for the perfomance of Anne Hathaway.<br /><br />If you can't get to to see it live then the film will have to do...but if you have the choice...Go see it LIVE!!
B000PAAH3K|5.0|Maybe one of the most important books of the zillennium, to understand the power of snap judgement vs careful rationale could have saved us from a few wars, if not all of them. The conclusion tears apart the glory of the modern information society, incidentally it also proves that Bluffdale is a Doomdale.
B006M4F67A|4.0|Nice game! Have other mahjong games that give rewards as you go.<br />One has fireworks at end if you win the game. Like those better.
B00B2DSIAI|4.0|The movie is good with all of the classic video game characters I remember growing up with. Would have preferred it be a little shorter since it feels like it goes a little long but enjoyed the ride none the less.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Got this for my wife and she loved it. Not particularly something I was interested in but the movie itself was pretty good.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|It is such a good movie that I keep rewatching it on my Xbox through the amazon app. It is hard not to enjoy the characters because the actors were perfect.
006220629X|4.0|Bottom line, if you have read Carlos Luis Zafon's work in the past, you will probably like this book. It's one of three books in a trilogy that the author claims have no ordained sequence; you can read them in any order. I still recommend reading them in order, so if you haven't read Zafon and want to, I strongly suggest you start with his best work by far, Shadow of the Wind. The Angel's Game succeeds that, and then you have this particular book, The Prisoner of Heaven.<br /><br />While I believe I have Shadow a 9/10, I would give this book the same grade I gave The Angel's Game.<br /><br />Zafon is a talented writer, and I suppose I should give major props to the translator, since I believe Spanish was the original language of these novels. He somehow manages to generate intrigue and anxiety out of seemingly mundane circumstances. And of course, I love how literature is actually a character in his books.<br /><br />7/10.
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|I love stories that capture me from the beginning. This story did it. Although I knew of some of the 'revelations' well before they were revealed I still wanted to read how it unfolded. Downloading the next book now!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|My son loves this game.  He cant get enough of it.  I would highly recommend to anyone who loves angry bird or star wars.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|This book really helped me become more comfortable, confident and a lot less anxious. How? By tuning me into why I am uncomfortable, diffident and anxious.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|I was looking for the excitement advertised by the upcoming movie and was disappointed by the slow pace of this book. A few of the stories were very good, but I would have liked a longer storyline.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is reaaly fun. There is a survival world for adventures and fun times. And there's also creative to test your limits in building things. BEST GAME EVER!
B0063GORYU|4.0|Good basic card app. A little hard to read the numbers on the cards at times; otherwise, worked smoothly and quickly.
B000M3452Y|4.0|Not as strong as the excellent This Is Happening. But more consistently good than the eponymous debut. The final track seems wildly out of place.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|At first, I was only going to give this story 2 or 3 stars because it was hard to read due to the heavy use of Irish slang and long-winded narrative.  But me being stubborn & loving to read, I stayed with it and  toward the last chapters, could not put it down.  The characters of Jamie, Rose & Paddy are beautifully humble.  I was shocked by the torture & abuse of orphans by the Catholic church in Ireland  and learning that these disgusting events continued until the late 90s.
B006M4F67A|5.0|Brilliant game but very addictive find I can't put it down. Would recommend to anyone who enjoys mahjong games.good sound effects too.
B007Z58RLC|5.0|I love the journey of Siddhartha through his life. As he transforms so does the reader. it really made me want to study more into Bhudism. I reccomend this book to any and all, I want to say a myriad of things but alas, spoilers. I cannot betray Herr Hesse.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|DANCE OF DEATH is another AMAZING album from the legendary Metal band IRON MAIDEN(Maybe the greatest one.....)...The return of Bruce on BRAVE NEW WORLD bring MAIDEN back, and i think these 2 are great AMAZING modern albums from this old METAL icon!!!!

B009X01C64|4.0|This case has a nice leather look and seems fairly well-made.  However, at around $35, it was a bit pricey compared to a case I got for my Nook HD+ (around $10), which I like just as well.
0307346617|5.0|The author keeps you at the edge of your seat and makes it real hard to set the book down.  A real adventure book told in an eye witness manner.
B00AB7HESI|3.0|I love the innovation in this game, but the keyboard takes FOREVER to come up, and it frustrates me and my kids. Aside from that, I like how it uses mind power and creativity to get through the levels.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|May 16, 2013 1:02 PM  Downton Abbey<br />I Just watched the 3rd Ep of the Second season<br /> and I could hardly keep up, so much had take place<br /> and it was only 53 minutes! I always take notes because<br /> they always go back and forth between the characters and so it gets<br />very difficult to recall something, then another great<br /> scene is playing while I'm scribbling!  So I replay the scenes over and over.<br /> I also noticed many characters whisper, so I have to replay many pertinent scenes.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|I love being able to flip through different magazine sources to read different things. I use this app every day. consider setting up you own account to choose which magazine to read about.
B0030B621W|5.0|This really is a must see. Very interesting storyline. I thought that the trailer was going to be a complete spoiler for the movie but it turns out there is much more to the plot than the trailer lets on. Great acting, writing, and directing. One of those movies that just makes you want to watch more movies. The writers of this script should write science fiction novels or stories.
B008UTV6S8|5.0|Really excited at vreceiving this DVD.  It was not available in Australia and as a huge fan was greatful to able to pick up this copy.
B004UID2LC|4.0|I have only used it a small amount of time.  I like what I've seen so far. It's similar to the game that came on my desktop computer.
0525952926|1.0|I can not believe this was written by Ken.  I gave the first book 5 stars.  This book is such crap in comparison, it should be given negative 5 stars.  The story is filled with shallow uninteresting characters.  Amazing how someone (not Ken)working with the history of this time was capable of making this reader pull for Hitler to kill off all these dull characters.  Really disappointing.  I would avoid this book even when it hits the dollar bin shortly.
B006Q1SQCQ|5.0|I like it because make easy to learn I don't like ME because I wish I had this book 30 years ago
0385349947|5.0|There was a lot of press surrounding this book that made me leery at first, but when I picked it up I found myself agreeing with Sheryl Sandberg's viewpoint. This book is not only a personal account but a rallying cry to women everywhere to bring up the subjects that set us apart from men and that are viewed as a cop-out by many employers and bosses. But issues like raising children and having babies are important to address and Sandberg makes the point that we have to begin somewhere.<br /><br />Although the book raises an important issue it's a very entertaining read, as she is a good story teller. I identified with many of her experiences, and know other women will too no matter what their financial status. She not only touches on the work environment but also on the personal front - making our partner our real partner to support us in our professional career. I whole-heartedly agree, it's an important step in being able to build a career, especially if one has children.<br /><br />This book is highly recommended for both women and men, and I know several male friends who read it and have remarked that it gave them new perspective on women in the workplace. The audio version is very pleasant to listen too as well, although it's not narrated by Sheryl Sandberg.
B0067LY4WG|5.0|This album is as poignant and meaningful as any of Mr. Cohen's earlier albums.  I don't think he's ever made a bad one.
B00BJS7104|5.0|The movie portrays slavery in a satirical manner while demonstrating its impact on different individuals.  Tarantino is doing history a favor by letting us see it with power but not rubbing our noses in it.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This was one of the best games I played in a long time. The ROOM kept inattention until I beat it. GET THIS GAME!
B00B97SNJI|5.0|Great CD from newish band. You can hear the Jackson Browne influence in the style and lyrics of the song (not to mention the lead singer's vocal quality). This is a songwriter's band - meaningful and introspective lyrics that SAY something. I expect a long career from Dawes.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I like the relaxing way the game flows and it is relaxing to feed and watch the rare fish while growing rare plants. The only thing that I would like more is to be able to collect pearls more quickly.
0525478817|5.0|I loved this book, it blew me away. It was not your typical Walk to Remember type cancer book. The book wasn't even about cancer, or death, or living even. It was a story about two kids and their place in this world.<br />The story line was a little cliche and predictable, but he made it work. He threw in plenty of intelligent humor, heart-wrenching moments, and philosophical conversations.<br />The characters were strong and interesting. They were highly intellectual, sometimes unrealistically so, but it added depth to their character and made it easier to become attached to them. Their words and their thoughts were thought-provoking. Though I feel he emphasized the two main characters too much and every other character fell by the wayside as a sort of \\"filler\\" character.<br />Overall I really enjoyed this book. It was a book that was entertaining, easy to read, but required you to think and inspired you to action. What that action is, I'm not sure yet, but I want to do something. This was awesome book, and I would recommend it to everyone.
B00C7TAF3Y|3.0|This game is in one word for me described as strange......and I didn't care much for the incorporation of alchemy (would have been great without that) overall, it was a good puzzle and quite challenging at times.
B00BKEMX28|5.0|For the most part, Heavily crafted Electronica with wonderful vocals that compliment, and often counterpoint, their rich musical styling. They're also not afraid to blend instrumentation, as in my favourite track 'Ice Age', but very compelling all around. I have numerous 'favourites' from this set - and I can't wait to hear more from them in the future! The extended set of bonus tracks was also a real plus.
B008CLI4N4|2.0|If debauchery, hedonism, cruelty, and torture are your thing, you will like the Game of Thrones.  This supposed \\"Fantasy World\\" appears to be from the mind of a teenage boy who gets no female attention.  Women are objectified and men are animals, while honor is practically non-existent.  Instead of dragons, battle, and plights of the common, the story focus is on elites as the crisscross thru multiple story lines, approx 6 to 8.  It reminds me of an afternoon soap opera put in the middle ages with no TV censorship.  I would give this a 3 out of 10. As comparison I would give 'Lord of the Rings' a 9.  There is a reason it is 'M' for mature, it is vile, violent, and disparaging to most good, I found little redemption in it.  Since I related very little with any character, viewing this series had a voyeuristic quality.  I was not entertained as I watched, but more fascinated that so many like this series...I would recommend \\"Tudors\\" the Showtime series if you like kings and romance with mature scenes and mild debauchery.

076790592X|4.0|Tuesdays With Morrie<br /><br /> Mitch Albom, known earlier in his career for his autobiographical work of sports legends and teams, took a very inspirational move forward with his groundbreaking memoir about life and death, Tuesdays with Morrie. This novel set the groundwork for Mitch Albom's many successful books that followed. Those include other New York Times Bestsellers, The Five People You Meet in Heaven, For One More Day, and Have a Little Faith. All of these novels weave themes of inspiration and hope into the words and aim to find a higher calling and change lives. His books also delve into religion and philosophy, and what those things mean to people of all different backgrounds. He writes in a matter of fact manner, all the while delivering moving stories about human nature and life.<br /> Tuesdays With Morrie was an extremely moving novel that chronicled the time that Mitch Albom spent with his 78-year old sociology professor, Morrie Schwartz. Albom visits Morrie on Tuesdays, where the two discuss life and death, and a multitude of other themes. These themes include love, happiness, emotion, values and many others. All of these topics of discussion between the two men lead to a reassuring theme that love amongst people means the most. Morrie quotes his favorite poet, W.H. Auden, saying, \\"love each other or perish\\". Albom is a man wrapped up in his material life and career until he meets with Morrie.  Morrie sums up what Albom needs quite poignantly  by saying, \\"... If you're trying to show off for people at the top, forget it. They will look down on you anyhow. And if you're trying to show off for the bottom, forget it. They will only envy you. Status will get you nowhere. Only an open heart will allow you to float equally between everyone.\\" (p.127) Through his talks with Morrie, and the many lessons that Morrie has to give, Albom realizes that what he is after is not the main goal in life; rather it is living a meaningful life and following your dreams.<br /> Albom lays this novel out in a very intriguing way, in which he intertwines old memories of his college classes with Morrie as his professor, with the present day lessons that he receives from Morrie. The novel came together well, with short chapters chronicling each meeting between the two. It is a very quick read, but by no means does it leave you wanting more. It is a very fulfilling book, that I believe is made all the better by its use of short chapters and succinct stories. A particularly moving theme that is woven throughout the book is that we need each other. Morrie puts it best, \\"In the beginning of life, when we are infants, we need others to survive, right? And at the end of life, when you get like me, you need others to survive right? ... But here's the secret: in between, we need others as well.\\" (p.157) We need to show one another love and compassion throughout our lives, and in today's day and age, I believe that this is an extremely important theme that everyone should take away from this book. While, yes, this novel does tread close to cliché, it does not go over the edge with sentimental and emotional themes. It weaves humor into all of the difficult and moving topics they discuss, which allows for an easier read of the novel.<br /> All in all, this is a very easy to read novel, that took me two days read, while also giving the reader many lessons about life and death. It is a novel that not all will love, but one that many will find a small slice of advice or hope that can make one understand death and the things that really matter in life a bit better, and can be there to help some through a tough time in life. It is a great novel that I will hold near to my heart, and hopefully you will too.

B00AN0KBJC|4.0|Its great when you see a book come to life and get to enjoy the comparison of your own imagination to the directors and writers of a show.  They have done a great job with converting the lengthy series of books to a show that will keep you intrigued and watching can't wait to keep watching the rest of this production.
0374214913|5.0|I read this from cover to end with relish. I was looking for a book that I could truly enjoy and this book did the trick. If you want a book that makes you feel very glad you love books, this is the book for you. I was getting bogged down in heavy literature, even though I love the classics, and this book brought back the joy of a good read. I know many others have long paragraphs of detailed critique, but I say just read this book and ENJOY!
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|really bad cheap humor; not even funny while intoxicated; this might appeal to 14-18 yr old guys; otherwise, pretty unintelligent stuff

B008220DGE|4.0|PT Anderson is known for his great characters and the actors that portray them.  This film is no different.  I could probably watch Philip Seymour Hoffman speak at an insurance seminar - he's that good.  And Joaquin Phoenix & Amy Adams - they're among my favorites as well.  The cast is among the strongest features of this film.  I think the main thing to stress here is - you either know you're a PT Anderson fan or you're not.  Knowing that in advance will dictate a lot of how much you accept & follow this story.  His style of following the lives of flawed and often unlikeable characters (made likeable) is a staple.  The story itself seems meandering (of course).  Freddie Quell (Phoenix) struggles with living in the world around him after WWII, his desolate journey thus far dominated by mundane daily life, alcohol, violence.  In a chance encounter Freddie finds a mentor (Hoffman) which gives his life more focus & purpose, which is often less than perfect for Freddie.  I can say the story can seem slow or even pointless to those not accustomed to Anderson's style.  On the other hand, much like Freddie Quell's journey this movie takes you through the life of an interesting person - not necessarily a likeable person.  Keep that in mind.  Otherwise this movie has many unexpected turns & enthralling scenes, a definite must watch for PT fans.

Deem game not worth even zero cost due to odd reliance on tap, tap, tap - to do anything since swipe, tilt, etc. never worked.  Seriously, 50 taps to 'apply' a piece of gauze to a wound. (SMH) Yeah, can't believe I waited that long to bail, either.<br /><br />Your playtime is worthy of more than this sad excuse of a game.

193700788X|2.0|From the very first book I have always thought she would end up with that person, so it wasn't much of a surprise to me. The book felt very rushed to tie up all of the loose ends and show she had finally became okay with herself/has lots of loved ones. It was also quite short. I do feel the author ran out of ideas a few books back but due to the popularity of the series kept it going; to me, the quality went down a great deal. With that said, I am a fan of the series. I just with she would have made the final book longer so it didnt seem so rushed to tie up the loose ends.

B009IEXKXI|5.0|I enjoyed the heck out of this story.  I even shared it with my wife who is not into sifi at all and she was laughing out loud every few mins.
B007EECSFA|5.0|One of the best I've read in a long time.  Morton is a master at weaving character and plot.  Excellent read.
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|The Hunger Games trilogy proved much more readable than I expected it to be. Collins creates an unusual dynamic with her female lead and love interest, giving both of them strengths and aspects of themselves that prove useful in different situations. Katniss is refreshingly competent for a teen fiction heroine, and the hero proves to be the more sensitive and idealistic of the two. Recommended for young adults looking for an accessible story without all the gore or painful consequences of battle glossed over with glory and wish-fulfillment, but adults looking for heavier fare may prefer to look elsewhere.
B002ZG976U|4.0|i did like the movie, and two powerhouse talents kept it &#34;real&#34;.<br />The story was predictable (relationship-wise), but, the musical numbers  were well sung and well danced.  It's a chick flick, all the way.<br />If you like either singer, it is good entertainment
B0052AC8C6|5.0|Great movie for adults and kids. Would recommend to anyone. Animation is top notch. My son wants to watch over and over.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I really enjoy this game. It is fun and addictive. You should purchase this game. This is one of my favorites.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Awesome movie! Can't wait for the next to come out! I was so happy to find it at such a good price.
B0067R0APK|5.0|I love this app...<br />I started with the free version, and found it to be very useful, so I decided to try this paid version and I love this one also. I use both versions every day and appreciate the value of each one. I think both of these apps are very valuable and worth the time and money invested.
B000SEGMAU|5.0|Very good read with a great message.  I have been loving Mitch Albom's work. Easy to read and very enjoyable
B00B6QXN56|5.0|I first hear him on our public broadcasting station.  Loved his music so bought the album.  Then again with his acoustic performance in Vienna.  I like this album even more.  Every song is good.  Some albums  might have one or two songs that one really likes.  On this album every song is good.  My favorite is Dust Bowl.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|even my husband and i thought this was clever and engaging!  a nice surprise for the parents in the family!
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I liked this book.  I did not see the movie so I can not compare the two.  It was well written.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I have always been a fan of Grisham.  However, this was not one of my favorites.  The plot got very  lenghty and  slightly confusing but the author clarifies the plot at the end.
B008476HBM|5.0|What a classic.  I love this book.  No matter how many times I read it I still think it is great.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|I'm glad SOMEONE said SOMETHING about food! The documentary gave more than enough evidence and advice for the people of America and we can all do ourselves (and children) a favor by making some changes. As they said, we are in control of the food market based on our decisions about which foods we consume and where we get those.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|great tool I use it all the time when a calculator is needed. like the way it functions and the way you can change to other calculator types
B0077EBWVI|1.0|Kevin Bacon is incomparable to this modern day no-namer. Don't bother with this one. Watch the original instead! It's so much better!
B0012HEB32|5.0|This is a great show I would recommend it to anyone... I watched every episode.<br />Great show it has better grafics than the movie.. The robots don't look fake
B0061PEAUY|4.0|This is better than the last few Reichs books.  It was not as break-neck fast, and actually gave you time to get into the plot.  However, it is getting just a wee bit old that every single book winds up with the heroine in a life-or-death struggle that she somehow miraculously gets out of.  She needs to find another way to climax her stories.
B000FC146C|5.0|Read this book many years ago - thought I would refresh my memory - enjoyed it much more this time around!  Beautifully written!
0743437497|5.0|I have read this book at least four times; I bought this one for my daughter; in my opinion, it is King's best.
B003WE9TU8|5.0|I read this book on recommendation for a friend and got addicted very quickly. I love zombie stories and I think this is the first one I've come across that takes place post-apocalypse -that the human race has survived!<br />It feels so real in the way it was written, a few times I had to check myself to remember that it was a work of fiction!<br />Love everything about it.
0679745203|5.0|After watching the film, I decided to read the book and it explained so much that eluded me in the movie.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants a really good read!
B007SGM084|5.0|It has been a long time since I have read a book that I couldn't put down, let alone three!  I want more!
B009NPA3MS|3.0|I really wanted to love this album, but I don't.  I'm hoping it will grow on me.  I can't even pinpoint why I don't love it, because I loved the stuff he did on Idol. I love the song &#34;Home&#34; .  Maybe it doesn't translate as well to recorded music as live performance, or maybe it's just me.  After awhile it all starts to sound the same.
B005723JSQ|5.0|I loved this book! It was a LOL read! I highly recommend this to anyone who needs a pick me up!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|this bundle is perfect for marvel lovers, it is perfect to play anywhere where you don't have access to a bluray or even an airplane in your iPad
B00BLSJI80|5.0|This album is everything I was expecting. It has a mixture of uptempo songs and heartbreaking ballads in different genres. Her voice is better than ever. This album proves that Demi Lovato is a consistent artist and will have a long career. Impossible to pick a favorite song, they are all amazing.<br />Buy this album you won't regret it. I promise
B000005RQT|5.0|I have been a Purple fan for many years but had never heard this whole album. Happy to add it to my collection.
B000HEWEEY|5.0|This movie took me back to a time in my heart where life was simple. Extras are great to look at and think of the way it was back then.
B000N3ST3Y|5.0|really like this collection of Genesis songs, they have been around a long time but are still great to listen to.
0062059963|5.0|This book was amazing. Perfect balance, and that's what I love to see in books. Little bit of suspension, little bit of romance with a dose of jealousy. It was just perfect! I can't image a better 2nd to this trilogy
B000005RRP|5.0|Deep Purple Mark II in their prime. I have been a DP fan for a long time but had never heard this album. For fans of DP in the early 70s this one is a must.
B0087ZG7PW|5.0|This is such as classic, completely worth the purchase just to watch one time. If you've never seen it, buy it. But warning, you've gotta be into the old classics and not super picky on graphics, remember the time period in which it was made.
B000SQJ2JG|2.0|for someone who really likes Burn and Stormbringer by Deep Purple, I found this album a big disappointment. Couldn't get into any of the songs.
030759565X|4.0|Overall I liked reading the book and the recipe collection.  I liked the prose and found many things I'd like to try in the salad, main dishes and cake sections.  The book is a little heavy on desserts.  I'd prefer all the ingredients be on the same page though and that is a drawback, flipping back and forth.  We really enjoyed the turkey meatballs and accompanying salad, though I prepared it warm.  I also tried the meat loaves but the massive cleanup afterwards of all the pots etc. required and lack of improvement on other meat loaf dishes makes this one I won't repeat. 3 1/2 stars
B003ZJUIGO|5.0|most of my favourites and videos I hadn't seen before.I prefer some of the songs live but it is good to hear the original versions too.
B001ANSSDC|1.0|I heard so much about this movie that I'd thought I would read the book first - it was boring and disappointing. Not worth the money.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|I did not like the silly language used .Also the crazy time frame of events...way too fast. I will read the third book. I am impressed that this subject matter has opened to allow women to explore .
B001UV4XIS|5.0|Cant go wrong with any Harry Potter movie and I needed to replace one that had gotten scratched,great price too
B007TBZ63Y|3.0|For some reason pages are missing and to replace them the page before is copied onto that page.<br />I will rate 5 stars once fixed
B00821OX98|5.0|I really enjoyed watching this series. It's amazing. It has a great cast and a great story line. You should enjoy it.
B00006FM77|5.0|Had the album...decided it was time to upgrade! It's Chicago at their origins. The reason after 40 years I still go to see them in concert
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This book was nothing like the movie. It, however, was a great, easy read. Not recommended for kids at all.
B00007E8O5|3.0|Jerry is talented, no doubt.  He just seems to have more enthusiasm for when he is with A.& C.  The first album was fine, the second did not pack much punch.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Chris Kyle began life as a typical Texas ranch hand; from student to cowboy, to one of the best examples of US Navy SEAL committment. Nearly sacrificing his civilian family, for the fraternal family bond of brother SEALS, he portrayed everything that American youth should identify with.  After rebounding from life long scars of combat and sacrifice for his comrades & to his country, exemplifies the courage, duty, and honor (which fighting men such as he and others in unform) to which all Americans owe a homage and priceless debit. Kyle's tragic death, (after returning to a productive civilian life), must be remembered for this man's love of God, Family, and Country.  His legacy is an example to which all of his peers should observe and attempt to follow.<br />God took him home. Absolutely no question about that.
B001EBV0NU|5.0|Jack Nicholson and the rest of the cast and crew should do another one.  Nice seeing the Landmark hotel come down in Vegas.  Howard Hughes might have liked it but toward the end it was kinda of a dump.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|I bought this after having seen the movie Searching For Sugarman.  Wonderful album.  Having lived thru the sixties and seventies, I can't believe this album didn't hit it big in the US.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Even after the second time reading this book I.m in love with this story. Thank you Colleen for giving a beautiful story to me and also for introducing me to a band I haven.t heard of and have grown to love!
B001BKVWYG|5.0|I bought this after having seen the movie Searching For Sugarman.  Wonderful album.  Having lived thru the sixties and seventies, I can't believe this album didn't hit it big in the US.
B008B1BL4E|5.0|The author presents a wide ranging and well balanced look into the relationships between key power brokers in the last two or so decades before the war. It is easy to read and well organized.
B0025VLEM0|5.0|This is an essential buy for any Blu-ray collection, Simon Peg and crew are brilliant in their comedic performance, just the right amount of every kind of humor. I've watched this movie maybe 20+ times and it Never fails to entertain. Great for anyone who has even a vague sense of humor. Not for your grandmother, or your small children however.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|2013-05-16
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|A witty, intelligent movie with surprise elements. I laughed out loud more than a few times, which was unexpected. I could watch this multiple times easily. Loved all the characters - especially the Sandman (pay attention to him). Good story. Great graphics
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I appreciate that the author, who is a neurosurgeon, stays with the facts instead of letting his emotions get carried away with him. The book has a rather abrupt ending, and I never felt a connection to the author. I recommend this book if you are interested in the afterlife.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|Nicely told tall tale with a female lead. Good for young girls - especially those that don't quite fit in as they should. Enjoyable
0736092269|5.0|Fabulous books with clear succinct explanatiions, fabulous anatomical renderings, and great tips. I feel like this along with the Workout Book should be mandatory reading for the person embarking on a training program and for those enthusiasts who want to know more about weight training for strength and better health.Should be spiral bound so you can use it easier at the gym.
B006M4F67A|5.0|Plays well. One of the better mahjong games I've played. Sound on/off option is in the pause menu options. Took me a couple of games to find that.
1450400957|5.0|Fabulous books with clear succinct explanatiions, fabulous anatomical renderings, and great tips. I feel like this along with the Strength Training Book should be mandatory reading for the person embarking on a training program and for those enthusiasts who want to know more about weight training for strength and better health. Should be spiral bound so you can use it easier at the gym.
B00AMH3RBA|5.0|Grandkids saw at theater and wanted to watch at home also. Very entertaining for all ages. Family oriented, cute, and funny.
B00936A0RU|5.0|received this when it was supposed to arrive. my wife and I both enjoyed it a lot. would definatly recommend it to see
B006M4F67A|2.0|LFour Rivers I can't even play.it's right over the start word. on  all there aren't any directions.<br />Can you e-mail me directions for all  these games  ?
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Wow! what a finish to a great trilogy. Kept me totally engaged till the final word! These books are definately worth the purchase price.
B006M4F67A|5.0|Got this app free because it was app of the day. I haven't tried the paid versions so I can't compare but with this one being free and good, I probably won't pay for another. Really like it.  Nice relaxing time killer and somewhat addicting!
B00AYHKIZ6|3.0|I really wanted to like this album, I've been a bowie fan since 1972, he was always on the cutting edge, some of his works took a few auditions before they snapped into the groove. But this one is just harsh, ragged, maybe that's the point, but I'm just not feeling it. I liked the latter half of the album, plus \\"I'd Rather Be High\\". It's good but it's not as great as the hype would have one believe following it's release.
B00COHAUD4|5.0|I found I couldn't stop myself from contemplating this story for days after watching it. The ending was surprising and wondrous. I felt like I did when I was introduced to a new Disney classic cartoon as a young child. It was a unique and fun experience constructed for a mature viewers.
B003XMUFGQ|2.0|I started collecting Clapton's works in 1970. I have everything (reasonably available) that Clapton has ever done, including some pretty obscure stuff (four different versions of White Boy Blues). I've lived through all his ups and downs. I bought the recording because, well, I wanted to at least sample all his works. Quite honestly, I'll probably never listen to this again. As others have said, while I don't like it, I don't hate it either, it's just so inexplicably lame, considering the source.<br /><br />You really could have skipped this release, Eric.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Darn game. Was hooked the very first time I played it. My husband keeps hoping I'll tire of it soon. No chance
B006M4F67A|5.0|After I caught on how to play, it kept my interest for a loooong time!  Great game!!<br />Thanks for the free app!!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I enjoy keeping in touch with family (all those grandkid pictures) and reuniting with friends from high school etc. The only downside is I spend too much time one it.
B008M721MS|3.0|i am not technical but i like the concept, just need a little help and then i'll figure it out and enjoy the app, it is cool to have on a kindle
B006M4F67A|4.0|This is a good game - makes you work for some of the pieces. Had fun. Enjoy the games. There are enough combinations to keep you busy.
B00AJMQSP0|5.0|Since the early 90's, I had forgotten about Helloween and then I saw this CD at the local BB and figured I would see what they sounded like now.  This album is awesome!  Highlights for me include Nabataea, Waiting for the Thunder, Straight Out of Hell, Church Breaks Down, and Live Now. Now I am catching up on their other releases from the past 20 years and those are good also!
B0073V7YTY|5.0|It helped test the noise level of my new generator. Very easy to use and understand, I would recommend this product.
0375851569|5.0|These are some of Dr. Seuss' best books. My grandson loves to be read to and we read them over and over.  Will be getting more sets soon.
0345529057|5.0|I started reading this series several years ago before it became popular and I had to wait for each new book to come out and in the meantime, I would lose from memory some of the important details. Now, with the books altogether I just go directly from reading one to the next and that is much better in my mind. It gives important continuity and therefore more pleasure in the reading of it.
B006M4F67A|5.0|There is a lot of concentration in this game. I enjoy seeing how fast I can clear the tiles.I would highly recommend this game.
034580404X|5.0|Living the fantasy through this author has been a delight! Great read! This trilogy is very popular among my age group an it really meets the expectations of my generation! Thanks EL for the fun read and fantasy come true way of writing!
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|it is a fun game to play. a lot of searching.I didn't think I would like it but you can have fun and waste time doing so
B000VOC90Y|5.0|I got this for school and so far I love it.  Lots of room and very durable. Handle has metal cord in it to reinforce and quality of Swiss Gear never fails me.  Only odd thing is there is a headphone port that actually is just sewed on but not going anywhere but i dont use those anyways. All my luggage and bags are Swiss Gear and there really is a reason why.
B008FLYM50|5.0|wow what a girl, she can sign and she will put you in your place with the lyrics. just can get enough
B006LSZECO|4.0|I couldn't put this down but....wow. what a sick and twisted story! I actually gasped at part two, none of this went the way I thought it would. Good read. Just bizarre!
B00AO2P3GA|3.0|make it free please i want it but i dont want to ask my parents cause they do a lot for me. if you can than do it free for like only 2 days on like july 2-3 please please please and then ill rate it 5 and my dad will send it to get it higher up cause hes an app director
B009UX2YAC|1.0|This game is awesome I never could imagine a better game!!!  I am so good at it!<br />Love this game!
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Great movie lots of action and spins in the plot.  A great adventure comic movie we really enjoyed a ton.
B00338QENI|5.0|It is so amazing that this woman's cells, her human body, still lives after the rest of her died in 1951.  I suppose it didn't die so much as it was taken over, smothered by her cancer cells.  Many times we think of cancerous cells as strangers invading our bodies when they are our cells just acting differently, greedy perhaps.<br />At first I thought the author was going off subject to prolong the book, but then I came to realize that the entire story had to include all sides and angles to be complete. It was a very complicated situation full of misunderstandings and assumptions.  The author did a fine job.
B001OGWY1W|5.0|Great movie lots of action and spins in the plot.  A great adventure comic movie we really enjoyed a ton.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|This reading gives you an incredible inside into North Koreans' lives under the suppressing regime that has controlled them for too long.  I can only pray that something or some force may help them soon and not soon enough.
B000IDEORY|5.0|How can you NOT love this movie with Patrick Swayze ... and Jennifer Grey before her plastic surgery.  Its a great classic film and I love it.
B007REV4YI|5.0|no this is a real good bond but to much hype but still a great movie and one big cliff hanger I like Daniel craig hes a good bond
B00BSBT8M6|3.0|I thought this movie was so so.... the scenery was gorgeous and the special effects but I just couldn't get with the story... it wasn't an Oscar nomination film to me.
B004IOVGW0|5.0|poignant.  real life. timeless.  will watch again......and again. genuine, sweet.  thanks.  Kim Novak was very young and played with incredible believability.  William Holden...well, one of my favorites since I was a kid and have followed him through the years...I always see something new I may have missed before on previous viewings..  I never get tired of it.
B005MMY5RK|3.0|Beauty is in the eye of the beholder I've never seen what people thought was so remarkable about CItizen Kane.... It's a classic but I don't think it's a great one.
B005K17RU0|1.0|The application hung on a loading screen while trying to get the local weather information.  It never actually worked for me.
B007GE2H3G|3.0|I got this for my grandkids and I never watched it.... they seemed to like it so I guess it's an okay movie.
0553801473|3.0|Would have read this avidly if it had been in an appendix or book of more stories from the world of ice and fire. Too distracted by wanting to know how the main story ends. Am losing faith that GRRM knows where he's going with this, and even starting to question the writing in the first 3 books. Will still read the rest of the series.
B00BJS7LHC|5.0|Awesome movie, Tarantino at his finest. Not for those with a weak stomach, or those who are easily offended for that matter.
B000V6U80A|5.0|I needed a cd to breathe,stretch and relax.  This cd accomplished that. Beautiful composition, beautiful instruments.Just the right tempo for what I am trying to do.
B00COHIFQS|2.0|Disappointing scary movie.  I don't know why I get my hopes up for scary movies when they're all garbage nowadays. CGI was impressive, but the whole movie seemed very trite.
193700788X|2.0|I just wanted to rate the Book and forewarn all future readers. I didn't read any of the reviews once the book was released, as I like to form my own opinions, as I am sure most of you do... but I am left with, what the H did I just read? The whole book was like nothing Sookie related, she was a different person, character, was in another world. I agree with many of the reviews previously posted and it is sad for me to see I am not the only unsatisfied customer! I was expecting an Eric er epic finale and it was anything but. I'll miss you Sookie and all of your old adventures!!!
B009ME47H2|4.0|I've used it once so far, and it turned out well. It comes in handy when going to meetings or on conference calls.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|I absolutely loved this book!! I became kind of obsessed with the characters after I finshed reading it, lol.  I highly recommend this book.  I enjoyed it from start to finish and was sad when it ended.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|Has quickly become a favorite of mine, and I plan on keeping this in my collection for quite some time. I'd definitely recommend it to fans on the series and newcomers alike. Perfect play and go game.
B002TLSSXO|5.0|Very nice set! I love how they all elevate and don't touch the counter top.  Really creative idea, all of my friends want them now.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|takes too much time..but enjoy the conveience of checking in on my granddaughter and great granddaughter. & other relatives not close by..
B001ENS0BI|5.0|This series gave me chills and made me cry at the end. I wish they would have continued the series.
B0045HCJFS|5.0|I have always enjoyed this movie. The plot is relevant today and the acting is excellent on many levels. One of those movies that hold up. I mentioned to my daughter that it had been on TV and she said, &#34;It is one of my favorites.&#34; I went to Amazon the next day and bought it for her.
B0040I09RM|5.0|My and my wife just start watching and we can't  stop. We're beginning the 4th season already.<br />Really good And next seasons get better.<br />Recommend 100%.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I can only add my recommendation of this production. Everything from the music to the cinematograthy is quite simply stunning. All the performances are excellent. I love period dramas and think I must have watch most of them in my time but none of them can compare with North and South.<br /><br />I love the story, but I think the main reason I personally love so much is down to the character of John Thornton himself who, for me, is simply the most wonderful period drama hero of all time, both in the series and the book. For me he definitely beats Darcy hands down. OK he isn't perfect, but I like that. He is however passionate, honest, kind, loyal and hard-working. Who wouldn't want to be loved by a man like that, and his steadfast love for Margaret is just wonderful and heart-warming.<br /><br />I can't imagine any one else playing the role except for Richard Armitage, who is simply sublime.  He is an incredible actor and conveys a lot in his expressions. He conveys his love, angst, passion and sadness through his face and eyes so well in so many scenes. In the \\"Look back at me\\" scene, you can literally see the hope dying in his eyes as the camera stays fixed on his face as she leaves. It is quite incredible. And the expression of tender love on his face at the train station at the end, when Margaret is explaining her \\"business proposition\\" had me literally melting.<br /><br />I would also like to add my appreciation of the extras on the DVD such as the deleted scenes including the extended proposal scene. Also the interviews and the wonderful commentaries on episode 1 and 4 which are very interesting and informative.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I found it easy to use and was a lot like having the actual cards in place.  I do not like to give lengthy descriptions for such an easy game and prefer not to make reviews that require a long description for such an easy task.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Could not stop reading this book. It grabs and holds your interest from the start. I highly recommend it. Good read.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is great fun for horse lovers. It's fun, teaches responsibility, and can be played with or without adding friends to your horse farm. This option is great for parents who don't want their children adding friends and communicating online.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Wreck it Ralph is a great movie with and awesome concept. Whoever thought of it is a genius!!  I recommend this movie to everyone, not just children!
B00632HWOG|5.0|The yahoo app allows you to navigate your email with ease. The slider tab that allows you to view all of your folders provides a clean look allowing you to fill confident about the location of certain emails.
B008602KQI|4.0|I didn't read any of the books, yet.  I wanted to keep an open mind.  I can't say that the premise is an original concept.  I've seen a few B movies that feature reality TV while people kill each other.  I don't remember the names of all the movies, but one is called a A Cabin in the Woods.  Also, this reminded me a little of Hostel.  I appreciate that this movie gets you to think.  What is going on in our world currently that mimics this?  Wars, disposable disenfranchised people, etc..<br /><br />What makes this a good movie?  SPOILER ALERT:<br />This movie portrays going against what is expected, in a good way.  Katniss crosses many lines.<br />People skills and life skills examples - it's who you know (you have to make friends with sponsors).<br />Feminine empowerment - Katniss got an 11/12, either the highest score, or one of the highest scores.<br />Dignity - Katniss didn't actually kill people.  She let nature take it's course.  She cut down the wasp hive.  At the end she killed someone being ravaged by dogs to put him out of his misery.<br />Survival skills (camouflage technique).<br />Love and camaraderie.  Doing the right thing.  Katniss protected Rue and Rue protected Katniss.<br /><br />This movie touches you on a heart level - that's what makes it good, decent, and wholesome.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Racing against a timer to match all the symbols and obliterate the cube as you go.  It doesn't get more addicting than this.  I love it.
1451620829|5.0|I love this biography for Kiss drummer Peter Criss.  Lots of tell all memories for Kiss fans.  If you are interested in Kiss or are a Kiss fan you love this biography.
B0007MWZEK|3.0|It may be a decent product, but I really wanted the Shark swivel sweeper which I love. Though I can make no real recommendation I can simply say don't settle if you want another brand.
B00BR0SGN0|5.0|\\"NOW What\\" is a nearly perfect 5 star album. The songs are such a joy to listen to that I start the album and cannot believe how quickly the time flies. The musicianship, creativity, and production are excellent. Ezrin did a great job. The lyrics are compelling; at times funny, witty, humorous, emotional, outraged, ominous, or hopeful. This is a rich and complex collection of songs that soars or quickly changes direction. As I listen, I find myself asking, \\"Where did that sound come from?\\" Airey and Morse, in particular, are excellent. Gillan's vocals are strong in mid-ranges but sound a little strained at times. Glover and Paice are rock solid. There are times the bass guitar comes through loud and clear. This is an album that exudes teamwork.<br /><br />\\"A Simple Song\\" quickly invites and draws the listener in and progresses into \\"Weirdestan\\" and \\"Out of Hand\\". These songs set the stage for the second half of the album as they express notions about time, a vision of a better world, and chaos. \\"Hell to Pay\\" and \\"Bodyline\\", though good songs, do not follow the narrative of the first several songs. But, \\"Bodyline\\" is growing on me. Next up, \\"Above and Beyond\\" is a great song that pays homage to the spirit of Jon Lord. Gillan's lyrics and vocals are especially powerful here (\\"Souls having touched are forever entwined\\"). \\"Blood from a Stone\\" is brilliant and features the \\"Riders on the Storm\\" sound, haunting lyrics, and moody tone, and \\"Uncommon Man\\" is a song of great fanfare and triumph. Placed here it seems a rallying point. \\"Apres Vous\\" is a humorous story about a woman at a concert, and the music is absolutely phenomenal. Airey takes this song in directions that seem unworldly (this reminds me of his solo work \\"A Light in the Sky\\"). The logical conclusion of the album is \\"All the Time in the World\\" which is contemplative and reflective and which Gillan sings to great effect. But, \\"NOW What\\" rocks to a close with the fun and quirky \\"Vincent Price\\". The bonus trackseems more of an encore number to me.<br /><br />This album is Deep Purple's finest work in many years. Though different from \\"In Rock\\", \\"Machine Head\\", \\"Burn\\", and \\"Perfect Strangers\\" it stands with and compares well to them.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|This was a beautiful story of the unconditional love and devotion of a dog.  It's a good wholesome family oriented movie similar to &#34;Second Hand Lions&#34; or &#34;Marley and Me&#34;.  We really loved it and we let one of our church ladies borrow it so she could watch it too.
B009NG1Q96|4.0|I've really enjoyed the first and second book.  I thought this one was a little bit more predictable, but I enjoyed it nonetheless.  I'm really looking forward to the final book in the trilogy!
B004UC4HCG|5.0|it works great i'm very happy at the speed it has and the cost that it was and how quick I got it
B0061PEAUY|4.0|At times a little too descriptive, but this was an excellent book. I really enjoyed following the changes in perspective as the leads were followed.
B00008G7UF|5.0|Great plot for a chick flick. Anything Kevin Kline does is excellent. Meg Ryan is always a good. I watch this quite often
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is so awesome you could build any thing you want and it's worth the money and there's this button that say's creative and if you click it it turns to survival
B00992CF6W|3.0|I do love this app to death so much but I'm not sure that you can play multiplayer because if it is supposed to work it doesn't work on my kindle.But again I LOVE THIS GAME!!!
B004OFWLO0|5.0|So the legend says.<br />He was the first to do so much, and now a lot is part of the standard repertoire.<br />Every blues and rock musician owes him so much.<br />So listen to the original-it's like tasting single malt whiskey after drinking other whiskeys.
B005TVYVI2|3.0|The Tempo Trainer Pro works well for individual with good hearing; however, for someone with moderate hearing impairment the sound produced by device is inaudible once water enters the ear canal.  Thus the device is of no value for pacing my swimming stroke.  Since the volume cannot be adjusted, anyone with even moderate hearing loss should not be surprised if the device does not work for them.
B000QGEB12|5.0|I'm not going to verify this, but I believe Stephen Chow created and acted in this film and it is incredible in its humor, its action, and its engaging story.<br />I've been hot and cold on foreign titles all my life, and I can sum up my Eastern influences thusly: Akira Kurosawa samurai pictures, Wong Kar Wai films like Chun King Express, and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. And now this movie.<br />Recommended by a friend and I thought this might be just a guys movie but my wife watched it and said it's about as generally entertaining as a movie can get, because if its comedy, romance, drama and action.<br />Wong Kar Wai meets Harold and Kumar? Crouching Tiger, Mr. Bean? Anyway, give it a shot, if you like comedy and you can appreciate Kung Fu themes, you'll like it. Note: not for kids, as it approaches very intense, though stylized, violence.
B000OJFV4C|5.0|The Tudor series was probably one of the finest programs ever offered on TV. I have purchased and watched the entire series at least three times and am again enjoying it in my Kindle Fire.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Once again, I am astounded by John Grisham's ability to furnish us, the readers of his story's, with rhetorical insight into what I consider a most vivid imagination, twisting and turning what seem to be impossible, into a interesting story that leads one to wonder how much can be truth and how much must be fiction. I cannot even imagine the research that must go into finding the idiosyncrasies that he brings forth, and always with a surprising ending..
B007IK44CK|5.0|The movie was too unbeliverable and action was so scarely however Tom did best action.<br />Easy to watching movies and unlimited streming..Best

B00AREIAI8|5.0|Really fun to play... you should try it... if you like horses it's the game for you to play. Suggested for 9-13

B0067EKYS6|4.0|Baz Luhrmann's \\"The Great Gatsby\\" is the third film version of F. Scott Fitzgerald's 1925 immortal novel. Faithful to the book, mostly a remake of David Merrick's excellent 1974 movie, \\"The Great Gatsby\\" deposits a 1920's love story into the CG twenty-first century. And does it well. Very well. Nick Carraway is a failed 1920's bond salesman. Nick enters a sanitarium to treat his anxiety and alcohol abuse. The doctor recommends that Nick write. Write stories. Nick and his typewriter pound out a novel about Nick's friend, a mysterious, handsome millionaire who wore pink suits, and sometimes stared down at Nick from his mansion windows. But mostly, Jay Gatsby looked across the sound, from West Egg, to the beautiful home of Daisy Buchanan, his one-time lover. Gatsby must find a way to get Daisy back, because if he doesn't, his bags of money, and all-night jazz parties won't matter. And neither will his life....Director Baz Luhrmann shot most of \\"Gatsby\\" in his native Australia; dazzling special effects, rock music, and plain-old magic remind you of Luhrmann's excellent \\"Moulin Rouge(2001)\\" and the very good \\"Australia(2008)\\". Leonardo DiCaprio delivers a strong, romantic  Gatsby; he does say \\"old sport\\" too much. And if you're a little tired, or not paying attention, you might just think you're watching the last Gatsby, Robert Redford. An old, sad love story in a mind-bending modern new format is actually very fine. Very fine. \\"Gatsby picked out the green light at the end of Daisy's dock. He did not know that his dream was already behind him. Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter---tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther....And one fine morning---So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past\\".
B003QTSMXE|4.0|It was recommended by a family member.  I really like Pixar so, why not.  It was so cute, the personality that came across really made you root for Wall-E.  I would recommend this for anyone who wants to sit and enjoy a movie with the entire family, without the worry of something disgusting popping up.
B00BQPEIT2|4.0|I'm reviewing this game for my grandchildren ages 8 and 13 who both loveTemple Run.  I don't play it, don't have fast enough reflexes, but both have reached scores of above one million.
B008M721MS|1.0|To be honest, the fact that this app constantly crashes and drops calls makes me disappointed that Amazon nor Microsoft will work on fixing this. Thanks for nothing. &hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;
1400063515|4.0|The Black Swan provides an alternative look at life through the aspect of improbable actions that take place.  Think of it as allowing us to diviate from the normal straight line thinking that pervades society.<br /><br />Timely<br /><br />Well written<br /><br />Enjoyable
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Thought it was very good...well written and gripping. The author did a very good job with the characters...worth the price.
B00992CF6W|5.0|its so fun I play it all the time I never stop plyaing this game I think every mincrafter will love itb
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Good game. A bit unforgiving st times, or my Kindle doesn't respond properly. Sometimes jumps when I try to turn.
B006M4F67A|4.0|This a fun game, although addicting. One thing I don't like is every once in a while it hangs up and you have to force a stop. This  puts you back on your home page and you have to start all over again.
B000HF0IIC|4.0|Its a funny thing nostalgia, it almost and in some cases has the image ability to warp the memories. I remember watching as a kid and thinking it was the best movie ever for the simple reason that it was just silly but cool as the cartoon Batman The Animated Series.<br /><br />After watching it as an adult, aged 24, i can see why it is not referred as much as the three Nolan films or even the ones which came before. It doesn't treat the material with the serious it probably deserves.<br /><br />But heres the thing, that's okay. It never was trying to be. This movie has more in commom with Adam West's<br />batman, the cheese o my gosh the cheese, and pulls a similar, though not as satisfying a result due to the expectations of a theatrical release, balance of the highly referred animated series.<br /><br />Balance here is the key. I cant get my younger siblings to care about the Nolan films, they are young kids. But they totally get this batman and i can see why. Just because it was made to rub that it's we hardcore comic fans have doesn't mean it fails as a film, it just means that it wasn't a film for us. And that's okay.
0307594165|4.0|Though I will read anything by Toni Morrison, I expected more of a saga than this - this is a slim volume, although a good story told well
1457514508|5.0|I was intrigued by the book's title and then drawn in by the book itself.  I read many books but this one thoroughly held my interest.  The characters are well drawn,interesting and quirky. The plot, with it's twists and turns, comes to a surprising conclusion. I loaned the book to a friend who read it from cover to cover in a matter of hours and she pronounced it \\"riveting\\".  I certainly agree with her assessment! I have this book in both paperback and kindle and highly recommend it for a very entertaining afternoon.  My only complaint is that cairn terriers are many colors but not white!
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|This comes with the special edition disc which includes quite a few making of featurettes including the video blog that was originally online for diehard fans. This movie is the first in the 3 movies that will be releasing for the book as a whole. Excellent start, can't wait for the second one. The ensemble cast makes the movie but the glorious sets and of course the original story don't hurt either.
B00CL68NOG|1.0|Surprisingly, this is not what I expected from Barbara Streisand. It was so slow I didn't even finish watching it. Boring, that's all I can say.
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|Entertaining romantic movie with a bit of mystery.  It keeps you guessing as to why Katie (Hough) is on the run.  About 3/4 of the way through the movie, you finally find out and then the suspense begins.  It has an interesting and unexpected twist at the end.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|This film has received some not inaccurate hate for silly decisions made by characters and possible plot holes, that said the special effects are great and the film attempts to entertain via a quickly paced sci-fi horror story and thought provoking concepts.  If you are able to suspend your disbelief and not question the film's logic too hard, it takes you on an enjoyable ride, but if you can't accept that a scientist would do stupid things, you may need to look elsewhere.  For my part, I enjoy'ed the film for what it is, and hope to see a sequel.
B00COHAUD4|2.0|The preview looked questionable but I purchased anyway.  Do yourself the favor and spend the $4.00 of a latte instead !

B00BQPEIT2|5.0|Great visuals and a lot of fun.  Would highly recommend this kindle application, I like Temple Run 2 but like this one even better.
B007REV4T8|5.0|It's not that i don't like movies, it's that usually after watching once or twice i'm good and don't want to watch again. The Bond movies are just different. The production quality is top notch, the story as intense the 10th viewing as it was when i saw it in the theater.<br /><br />Keep releasing more Bond with Daniel Craig and i WILL keep showing up!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is the most AWESOME GAME EVER!!!!!  It is my favorite game !!!  It has animals and plants.  You can connect with others in  the game. It has animals that will hurt you and kill you, but it's entertaining  and when you die you revive. It is awesome and most people love it. I like I bet  you will LOVE it.
B00AZL3PBK|3.0|I have no review as my grandaughter is the one who ordered it.  She enjoys it very much and takes over my Kindle every time<br />she visits
193700788X|1.0|i could not be more disappointed...why did ms. harris make these choices for such beloved characters?...we beg for a re-write!!!!....please don't allow this book to end the series...it doesn't even read like it was written by ms. harris...i have read the reviews and i agree with most of them.....
B00992CF6W|4.0|it takes a bit of time to get used to the touch controls for this game on a tablet; there are also no overlays on the right side of the screen for actions and people don't immediately know that long-press right corner is &#34;dig&#34; and that swiping the screen rotates your camera. If the developer provided some sort of instructions either in the game listing or the game itself it would go leaps and bounds towards making this game easier to start.<br /><br />Still, once you get past the slightly awkward control placement it is indeed Minecraft :)
B002WY65W4|4.0|Disappointed because it was one of the DVD cases and not a blu ray case but other than that it arrived right on time and this movie is awesome so I still got it on blu ray. Just doesn't look good lined up with my other movies.

B001JRB16U|5.0|Arrived very quickly and in perfect condition. I don't really know what else to say other than that I'm just trying to be nice and leave a positive review because it's nearly impossible to get rated on amazon.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Set in Ireland, this book portrays the loneliness of two individuals who connect through extraordinary circumstances.  Through disturbing and sometimes horrifying childhood experiences, they learn to overcome their personal demons.  Well-written and thought-provoking.

B008CLI4N4|5.0|Amazon was awesome. My package was delivered to the wrong address and Amazon sent me out a new copy that I received in 24 hours.<br /><br />This series has kept very close to the novel, which is rare. I got both of the first two seasons and can't wait for the third and fourth to complete my collection.
B00BOX0K0M|5.0|This polarizer is for the GoPro Hero3 series. It will not fit the Hero2 series cases. Unlike other filter designs that fit between the camera lens and the case, the Polar Pro clips securely over the lens on the standard acrylic GoPro case. Orientation is not an issue since it only fits 2 ways and both are correct. It comes with a little drawstring carrying bag to protect it when not in use. Functionally it works very well, doing what polarizers do.<br /><br />It seems to be pretty durable, too. When the camera is mounted on a DJI Phantom quadrotor, it hangs down below the quad and can be susceptible to damage from rough landings. Mine has taken several faceplants and the polarizer has never been knocked off or even scratched.<br /><br />If I had a complaint it would be that the camera's curved lens reflects bright sunlight onto the back of the filter at certain angles, and that reflection can cause some glare. Otherwise, it seems like a very good solution.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Excellent story, beautiful costumes, wonderful acting, quality filming!<br />VERY entertaining!<br />Addictive! Can't wait to see the next season!<br />It's a masterpiece!
B00932AA5G|4.0|watch it<br />it has a really great plot that keeps making you guess till the end.<br />I love watching movies like this because all the actors were new to me, so I didn't have any guess base on the actors previous movies.<br />It's hard to explain, but you'll get me after you watch it.<br />enjoy :)
B007OWRBJK|5.0|I bet I am the only person I know who knows how Pete Townshend broke his hand, do you? HA, read the book. Such a smart man he is,brilliant.Pete was first to shed tears when Mr. Keith Moon tragically died. If you want to learn how to juggle amped up band-mates ,hotel managers ,women ,producers ,recording engineers ,groupies,the police,and even guitars!,and wives read this piece of art.

B008Q09K2U|2.0|Good plot, however the John Corey character is becoming too smart, sarcastic and silly. The ending seemed rushed and abrupt, overall big fan of deMille however failed to deliver the goods here.

1250012570|4.0|What a powerful written love story! Eleanor & Park tells the love story between two teenagers who are discovering first love at the same time dealing with family & school. Every time Eleanor went home I was on edge because of her unfortunate family life. I read the times she was with Park and his family with happiness and I read the times she was with her family with dread. This beautiful novel is worth taking the time to read.
B003M70O5O|5.0|I can't wait until the new season starts in September/October. Have watched all seasons in the last month and I can't tell you how much I love this show.
B005TBWN0K|1.0|This app seems really great it, it allows me to annotate and take pictures and add web pages to my notes, but anytime I try to use a blank Skitch note, it closes and doesn't save my drawings. I would rate it higher if it didn't shut down every time.
B0091W4PRC|5.0|A real &#34;feel good&#34; movie.  Everyone did a great job representing the real people and was respectful of the story!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is not difficult because it has many levels. Choose yours and have fun! Helps the little ones really think outside the box. They really feel a sense of accomplishment when they solve the puzzle. Easy to recommend this one!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is delightfully fun to play. Easy to learn. Totally gratifying. Just love it.<br />You'll enjoy it to. Bravo.. the horses movements are so life like you almost forget it's a game. .
B0086700CM|5.0|This is one of the most played games on my KindleHD. I should probably get a screen protector to keep my screen from wearing out from all the &#34;finger swhishes this game requires. It's an entertaining game enjoyed by many... who are always trying to outdo the others. Easily recommended.
B008YRVW0I|3.0|This game is fun for young kids not much for adults. But my granddaughter likes it a lot. The game part is fun for me. also once you get to a certain point you have to pay more to continue playing. i dont know bout other people but i hate that. Well that's all I can say.
B00BOUL9DM|5.0|This is one of the most challenging games I've played in a long time. It really makes you think. Love It.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|It was Slow to start but after I started reading it drew you in. I would recommend it.  Good romantic comedy.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is so fun. It keeps your mind busy and it constantly changes from day to day so you never know what will happen.

B006MW3UZW|5.0|At our house, we love to escape into the world of Downton Abbey. This may sound funny, but when dealing with real-life pressures of our own, we find that it's much easier to deal with the problems that arise at Downton. But we watch it for more than that--it really is escapist, we get wrapped up in the stories intertwined throughout a marvelously written, acted, and produced series.
B0053TMP24|4.0|I thought this book was very good. There were some slow spots, but all in all it had a good storyline that will leave you wanting more.
B006M4F67A|4.0|This game provides stars to rate how well you did upon completion of the puzzle, up to 3 stars.  There are plenty of puzzle layouts to choose from, to prevent boredom.  I dislike that you cannot double tap a tile for the game to choose a match as some other games do.  Also, if you stop while playing, you have to start over the next time you want to play the same layout; the game is not saved as it is in other offerings of Mahjong.  I do like that if you touch an unavailable tile, the available tiles light up for easy visibility.  The color differential goes away when you touch an available tile.
B005LAII80|5.0|Bought it used and worked perfect disc had no scratches or case wasn't broken at all. 3d was legit a great buy !!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Like most other reviews, the only complaint i have is i wish it had gone on longer. I must admit i used almost every clue, but only because i am very impatient. I thought overall the difficulty level was good, i never got stuck on one thing for too long. Cant wait for the next!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The graphics are good and they added so many more obstacles like mines and zip lines. I would recommend this game to everyone.
B008JEJN8O|5.0|I bought these on a recommendation from the Crocs website/catalog and am I glad I did.  They are the most comfortable Crocs clog to date, way better than the first beach clogs on the market years ago when Crocs first started.  The cushioning is excellent so much so they could be used for light athletic use.  I had first picked the black pair with charcoal outsole in size 10 and they were a bit big and so I returned them to Amazon for free (!!).  This convinced me that I really take a size 9 for most Crocs shoes and I own quite a few pair (some say I should by stock in the co.).  The smaller size 9 fits excellent.  The color scheme is great however they are not very business-like.  Luckily, the green outsole is not that very neon green and these work great for casual/weekend outdoor use.  Highly recommend.

B007BVOEPI|5.0|Addictive show to watch. If you can tolerate the nudity and gory nature it is definitely worth watching. Great casting.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is a great series. Make sure that you start with the first season to fully understand the character development.
B005COO1X6|5.0|Mile 81 is an amazing Kindle single. The story interconnections are well done, vintage Stephen King. As always, Stephen King has delivered a great read. Worth a look....
B008JC9ZYS|1.0|I had a huge deception about this product. Can't write a review about it as I couldn't watch it.<br />The blu-ray disc simply doesn't play, I tried it in several devices and there's nothing on it, it starts and keeps hang in Title 5 with 00:00.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|I had great expectations. This is a broad bush stroke canvas both in scope and time sequence. The actors preform there craft with skill and engagement. But I was left with<br />just nothing for my viewing effort. Take clips from various films over the years, \\"The Matrix\\", \\"Mutiny on the Bounty\\", \\"The Crying Game\\", \\"Swiss Family Robinson\\"; mix with some film noir and BBC production, stir rigorously. Add some stagecraft, but leave out a solid plotline and you have a version of this film. I found myself asking: \\"What's the point?\\". Oh, I get the \\"everything is connected\\" theme but that was understood from the start. Clearly, there are scenes which are interesting and amusing; the effects and graphics are fun, but this isn't worth nearly three hours of time.
B00632HWOG|5.0|My samsung s3 works great with app. Hasn't locked up or caused any performance issues that I know of. Would recommend
0061353248|5.0|The author is wise and connected with the real world and with the unpredictability and vulnerability of the human being. The experiments done are well based and it collects and brings a very reasonable overview about the behaviour of the men, their social reference, relativeness, pondered honesty, the tricks created by ads when their behaviour is known, their procrastination, the power of free products and word, etc... I do recommend this book for those people who believe the human is most of times rational and the economics theory is the best way to describe the commerce. Maybe you are going to realise your mistaken thought.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Very easy to use. Several different levels to try and master.  Love playing this game. Very addicting to play. Will recommend this to my friends.
B003UESJJC|5.0|Movie is amazing, if you haven't seen it, go see it. I haven't had time to watch the Redux or heart of darkness yet, but I am sure they will be great.<br /><br />Packaging is great, comes with a booklet. If you love Apocalypse now, this is the set to get.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I have always been a fan of Jessica Lange. She absolutely kills it as the sadistic head nun of Briarcliff Manor. A very talented troupe of actors that make this show worthwhile.
B0036EH3XE|5.0|I love that I have this show to watch again & again! This is a perfect DVD set of one of the best shows in the history of t.v.!
B00000099Y|5.0|I'm usually very verbose, but this album...maybe I just have an emotional connection to it. It's my favorite album. Ever. And that's saying a lot. It's complex but strangely catchy, the lyrics are insightful and epic, the playing is pure awesome, and Maynard is at the top of his game vocally speaking here.<br />I find it hard to believe that anyone could be hearing this for the first time, but if you are, buy it.<br />I remember playing this in the car for my father when it first came out. My father who taught me to love the Beatles and CCR, and who doesn't much like modern music. He was bowled over by it and took me to a few Tool shows.
B00005N6KG|5.0|These headphones are great.  The sound quality is excellent and for me these work better than the earbuds that are popular now.  I have bought at least 5 of these and would buy more.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|I'm so happy to finally be able to play this on my non-kindle android tablet. I hope more dash games make it.
1452105111|5.0|Fun; multiple uses; bright and colorful; I will be using it for a shower and then as a gift to the mother-to-be
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app is awesome. It used to be 6.99$ but now it is 3.99$. That's even better! It's not like xbox or PC but it is still fun. People should get it now because a new update is coming out soon with online multiplayer. AWESOME!!!!!
B004UJAOLM|4.0|Very attention grabbing. Keeps you wanting to read more! A more elevated reading level is recommended. I thought it was a pretty great novel.
0446530573|4.0|Got this for my sweetheart and she has really enjoyed reading the book! Book was in excellent condition with cover.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|If you haven't seen this show, start with Season 1.  No summary could possibly bring you up to speed or help you to appreciate the character development better. That being said, this season rachets up the tension at the firm with the return of an off-screen character at the firm making his appearance (David Constable plays the guy you love to hate) and shaking things up.  The romance between certain characters is stronger and the interplay between the main characters Mike (Patrick J Adams) and Harvey (Gabriel Macht) is at its finest.<br /><br />I'm not one to spoil things, but here's a few items to note. When I first started watching this show, I couldn't have imagined that a legal drama that barely ever sees the inside of a courtroom, would be so exciting and interesting.  In fact, it's one of my favorite shows because the dialogue is so well written and even supporting characters are fleshed out.  This is also probably the best show or part for Gina Torres (as Jessica) and Rick Hoffman (as Louis Litt).  They play their parts so well that you can sway from liking them one week to hating them the next.  They are such fully developed characters that the show would be lost without them.<br /><br />That being said, Gabriel Macht has been the break-out actor of the show and makes you feel like your watching a younger Al Pacino meets Michael Douglas.  His mentoring and big brother role to Patrick J Adams's character is a wonderful complement to his bravado and egotistically nature as a lawyer.  He's like an anti-hero at times and then he reminds you that he has a hidden compassion the next.<br /><br />This show is a pleasure to watch and I eagerly await season 3.
B00C7KXUOE|5.0|This show is everything a Silence of the Lambs/Hannibal Lecter fan could hope for. You see Hannibal before he was known as a cannibalistic serial killer, and are able to glimpse into the life he lived as a renowned psychiatrist. Spot-on acting, intelligent writing, beautiful cinematography and music. I can't recommend this show highly enough.
B0025VLELQ|4.0|The Blu-ray version does a good job of cleaning up the print.  Though not a big budget movie, the computer and special FX were fairly groundbreaking for that time period.  The story is a well-worn tale of an everyday boy (reluctant to his calling) chosen to save the day.  But the execution is an original one.  You could almost compare it to an early version of the Green Lantern movie that just came out.  In this case, the hero doesn't have super powers, but does possess skills in another area - video games.<br /><br />The movie has a good deal of humor and a nice light adventure feel.  A good popcorn movie with nothing to deep to analyze, but still plenty of fun.  There are so unintended humorous sequences because the &#34;bad guys&#34; are laughably one-dimensional, but in a good B-movie way.<br /><br />Not the best sci-fi adventure of its time, but more enjoyable than the original Tron and a great supporting cast.  Don't want to spoil anything.  If you grew up in or enjoy 80's nostalgia, this will be a great return trip.
B00AYM6JFO|5.0|Willie just keeps getting better with time. I guess to sum it up Willie is timeless. Buy this one for some smooth music Willie's way.
0307887448|5.0|Ready Player One is a book that I couldn't stop reading. Like a video game that can hold your attention for hours on end you just have to keep going. When you have to sleep and save your place you can only dream about returning to the vivid world that the book creates to learn the rest of what happens to Parzival and his friends. From beginning to end this book is engaging, laugh out loud funny and moving in all of the ways that you want a book to be. Now that I've left the world of the Oasis by finishing the book, however, I find that I really want to go back. Well written and a nostalgic romp through the classic times that many of us quite enjoyed. Pick up this book today...you won't regret it!
B00B23O96A|5.0|Clapton could perform &#34;Old McDonald Had A Farm&#34; and make it sound good. One of his best works to date.
0670026557|4.0|Great book. Very interesting and good reading. Lots of facts and examples. Good to know good guys don't have to finish last. Very inspiring
B0047Y17P2|4.0|A twist ending that I did not see coming makes this another thought provoking good read. All our old friends are here .
B001O96JC4|5.0|Timeless, eerie and haunting. A masterful production that never gets old. Turn off the lights and watch it in the dark.
B00004Z4SD|3.0|A little too slow moving. On the sad side. But, if you're in the mood to kick back and watch a movie based on a true story then this will fit.
B00AKKTDJY|4.0|even thou it drains my battery, i cant stop playing it, the game is really entertaining when you need to wait in lines.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|A great book by a great hero. Very intense and realistic. It is well written and gives you the feeling that you are right there in the action.
B007V5CF5K|5.0|When are you going to make more games like these.  I really enjoy playing with my Grandsons. Its fun to watch them when they find a new item or room...
B006WXHJTO|5.0|This was the least favorite of the series, but still a great film.<br />The DVD is included and the Bluray. You also get the digital film version for iTunes.<br />My go-to &#34;pick me up&#34; series.<br />The film is amazing, the inclusion of both the DVD/Rated and Unrated and the digital copy is a great value!<br />Pick it up and enjoy.
B009UAO1ZG|5.0|I am probably one of a very small number of current readers who is old enough to remember quite clearly many of the events described in this superior book.  I applaud Lynne Olson for both the concientious accuracy of her research and her gifted writing skills.  She portrays this important episode of modern American history with shrewd insights and page-turning suspense.  In these portraits, Anne Morrow Lindbergh shines forth as being as vibrant and intense an individual as FDR and &#34;The Lone Eagle.&#34;  THOSE ANGRY DAYS is a first class achievement, every step of the way.<br /><br />Bernard Z. Friedlander, Madison, WI
B006WXHJVC|5.0|My go-to &#34;pick me up&#34; series.<br />The film is amazing, the inclusion of both the DVD/Rated and Unrated and the digital copy is a great value!<br />Pick it up and enjoy.
B006M4F67A|4.0|Very challenging and a lot of fun!! Graphics are great and exciting. Highly recommend to Mahjong lovers of all levels.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|What's not to love. Some people can only talk about the sex, but its a great love story. I really looked forward to Book 3 and I absolutely loved the ending.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I dearly love this calculator because I don't have to redo any of my calculations.<br />I have had other programs that do not meet with my specifications.
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|heard it on the radio and was jamming out in my car, when i heard the radio say it was daft punk, instabuy.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app. Having it on my phone and Kindle allows me to always have the Bible on hand no matter where I'm at. Love the devotions and different versions of the Bible.
B00BR0SGN0|5.0|Got to admit I really like the Morse era of these guys a lot better than the earlier stuff. The two distinct styles compliment each other quite well. Steve's guitar playing is real good here. And the band still has chops. It's fresh and new enough to be interesting but still enough old school sound to recognize. A really well engineered / sounding CD too. Way to go!
B009AMANBA|3.0|As everyone well knows by now, this is a well acted, well directed, and well made film. My only beef is that as a Civil war buff, I was hoping for more of the War action itself and perhaps Lincoln interacting with his Generals and such instead of spending the whole of the film on the Emancipation proclamation and the behind scences drama, [ I believe Tommy Lee Jones deserved more accalades then he got for his role ]. Hopefully Speilberg will do a second part with more of the Soldiers story from the Civil war and the families affected by it all.
B00BSWMITK|4.0|Been following Joe since his first album. Seen him many times live. Love his work. After a few listens through this one is well produced and engineered. Music is \\"familiar\\". Maybe I was hoping for something a bit fresher and newer sounding. But it is after all some great playing by one of the worlds greatest guitarists. So it ain't all too bad! If you like him even a little. Buy it.
B0076DELIG|5.0|As good as patterson...will read more of his books. Kept my interest all the way to the finish. Worth the read
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I LOVE Downton Abbey.  We have been recording our regular television shows so we can stream this through Prime.  I will be so sad when we are all caught up through Season 4.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Actually, it hasn't worked for me yet. I've tried but so far nothing.<br />Sorry!!! Will give it another go however.<br />I did try this again and it works very well. I was very pleased with the results and followed someone's advice to make sure it is plugged in if you plan on using overnight.It can be draining on battery. However, it perfect for travel etc or backup at home.
B00CRS88IO|5.0|This is a cool book, and an interesting look into the life of Ian Fleming. A must have for all Bond fans.
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|Awesome collection that includes the original version of the series and remastered effects.  It also plays in its originally filmed aspect ratio.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|The author uses verbage that is not typical. And the story is well written.  The main characters stories are interwoven and create a suspenseful vibe...
B003ITZBVI|4.0|DC Animated movies are hit or miss this is a hit.  They can't seem to make a decent Superman animated movie but they Batman ones are spot on (except Gotham Knights).  I can attest to how good this is because my wife watched it with me and stayed awake for the entire movie.
B000L212HC|5.0|The Prestige has two of the greatest actors alive, along with the greatest director of our time as well.  The story will leave you speechless.  It will leave you questioning everything you have thought you knew about this movie.  The story is amazingly written in style.  The actors play their roles very well.  And the mystery will shock you at the very end.
B000062X90|5.0|This may be an old album but it still stands the test of time. Great guitar work and vocals. Crank it up and enjoy.
B005S9ELY4|4.0|This is perhaps the greatest cop movie I have ever watched!  It has a great villain!  Great heroes!  And a great storyline!<br /><br />This movie is highly recommendable.
B00BQH9SY0|5.0|Probably one of the more original bands to come out in a long time! 100% worth buying their music! They are killer live too...
B004AKCMD4|5.0|This movie is perhaps the greatest cartoon of all time.  The filmmakers have maxed out with this one.<br /><br />I do recommend families to watch this with their kids, it will have you staring at the amazing graphics till the end.  And the characters are funny and serious too.<br /><br />Please buy this!
B008FQ1O1K|5.0|A beautifully written book with a timeless message!  I couldn't put it down from the moment I picked it up....
B003HARV4S|5.0|Nothing can be put into words about how great this movie is.  Norton plays an amazing character that makes you widen your eyes at the type of tricks he portrays in this movie.  And the love story will leave you in tears by the end.<br /><br />Highly recommendable!
B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|My criticism is not of the game itself. It's probably a nice pasttime--IF you can download it and install it. Kindle doesn't tell you how big the file is, nor do they make it easy to determine how much space you have left on your drive. They just let you buy it, then SURPRISE! you don't have room to load and play it. Really, folks? Really? Is that the best you can do?
0553593544|4.0|Jason Bourne is perhaps the greatest spy story ever told.  It beats the movie and beats the mind of readers.  You will not be disappointed by this.<br /><br />The villains are awesome and the story is EPIC!!!<br /><br />I love Marie and Bourne's relationship.  I love the love story between the two.  It has great development.<br /><br />Robert Ludlum delivers an amazing story!
B000PMFTDQ|5.0|If you want to have an experience how a sadness comes from the inner body resonance like, then buy it. The best \\"Beim Schlafengehen\\".
B005LHOKFS|5.0|Have never been steered wrong by the advice in Trip Advisor. Nice to have it on the phone.  Easy to use and can show you places close to your current location.
1451697686|3.0|I like Bea Johnson, I do. I read about her family a few years ago in Sunset and was intrigued and eager to read her book. I spent 3/4 of the book loving some of the ideas and agreeing with her on some of her philosophies. The only thing I didn't like was the last few chapters seemed too partisan, like proposing a \\"pay as you throw tax\\" and advising people to not have too many biological children, even advising readers to contact planned parenthood about contraceptive information. Too much politicking for me. I think everyone can make small changes that would have an overall big impact if we were all just a little more conscientious of our actions. Unfortunately, my library didn't have this book so I bought it from Amazon and it came in a cardboard box and wrapped in plastic (which I did recycle).
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This is a fantastic read! Not macabre like a lot of King books. I could tell even before I read the afterword that a lot of research went into this book. I know it can't be easy to mix history with fiction, but King has done a great job. I even recommended this book to my Mom who doesn't like &#34;icky&#34; books.
0062014102|4.0|Not much more than a collection of anicdotal evidence about what may make us tick....but well written and thought provoking.
B000VR824S|5.0|Hey Sam Graham you really don't get it saying \\"Steve Winwood lacks fire (mostly due to the lackluster nature of their Blind Faith-era material\\" Your review is so lackluster and just wrong. I live in Chicago and 1000's of people here LOVED Steve Winwood performance. He was one of the best guitar player of the night. Less is more o.k. It's not how many notes you play its when you don't play. He is the real deal. IT WAS GREAT TO SEE  Eric and Steve back together after 30 years!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|It is the easiest place for me to get instant local reports 24 hours a day, no waiting for the local TV scheduled reports.
B00A3XWAU2|5.0|I love this album, & so will all the fans of 70's style blues rock!! Great musicians, stellar lyrics, & Chris Ousey is vocalist that send chills down you spine with his voice!! The credentials of the band member is way beyond mind blowing & best of all they can deliver the goods!!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is a pretty fun game. It is much better then Temple Run. You get to have different characters and settings. Although, everything is A LOT of coins.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|The author expresses herself and explains her experience clearly. One of the few books that I have read about near death experience that makes me feel like I am part of the tapestry of the Universe.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Lots of fun and exciting on the countdown. I am a new kindle owner and this is my first game.
B005HGZV6U|5.0|Having been a Daft Punk fan for years, I absolutely loved this purchase. The quality of the audio is great, picture is on par for its era of SD production. Also, the extras are really a treat.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|You can make a book, diary, journal, or just use it as a notepad. You can also choose what the cover looks like from a variety of choices.<br />  Another thing th at you can do is if somewear in your journal journalistic wan to to show a picture or document that's on your device,you can attach I  to your page. It won't show up on the page, but on the page that you attached it to Will have a paper clip slipped into the top right corner of the page. When you tap it, it will then show the attached file.
0763644765|4.0|It's a pretty cute book.  Our toddler likes it & smiles whenever we read it.  It's nice & simple with simple words so our small child can understand.
B00957T6X6|5.0|This is far and away the best book I've read in years. My husband and I devoured the thousands of pages of this series and cannot wait for the next installment. George R.R. Martin is a phenomenal story teller. This book is extremely violent and sexually explicit but never gratuitous. It is beautifully written. I had to stop reading at one point and step back just to appreciate the perfection of the chapter I had just read. This is a book to read again and again if one lives long enough to reach the conclusion. C'mon, George. Finish it!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I LOVE THE TWISTED MIRROR WOLD IT&quot;S ALSO CREEPY. The opposite realm is totaly awesome. Everything is so twisted and wrong.
B00571F26Y|2.0|While I don't doubt the author's results with his patients, I think he jumps to a lot of unfounded conclusions.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|This is a great free app. However when your 5 plays run out you have to wait 7 minutes or buy more plays which can be annoying.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|The writing is not of the highest caliber, but the characters are well drawn. The heroine, Lou, is exasperatingly stupid, because she grossly misreads so many situations and spoken words by the other characters.  I wanted to shake her and say what the heck are you thinking?  How can you feel guilty and incapable about that?  Also the characters' names are hard to get straight in the beginning, as they have full names, short names and whatever.
B006M4F67A|5.0|I thoroughly enjoy this one as it has more choices then previous ones I've purchased!! Can become addicting to say the least.
B005UG542S|5.0|This movie was pretty true to the book; it was suspenseful and contained fantastic scenery; the visual effects were stunning.
B007L5GDGW|3.0|I'm having a rough time with this one. I am either to nervous or it's to sensitive. I'll keep working on it, but not my favorite.
B008QTVNUI|4.0|Certainly entertaining, often unpredictable, and ultimately i do recommended Homeland. But i wouldnt call it mind-blowing, and the acting feels a little iffy in parts.
B00BDSRISA|4.0|This is actually the first time I've heard this band. I think I may have seen some of their earlier stuff in my local record store, but maybe didn't pay much attention so this is my starting point here. I really like this! It has a lot of 80's influences. I hear Prince style drums and 80's Bowie and The Cars style keyboards, and at the same time is pretty unique and cool! It's really catchy and has some really great sounding harmonies.<br />This is one of those albums I can listen to over and over.<br />I'm seeing reviews that seem to be upset fans that this is not like their last album. Again I don't have a reference point, but this is a really cool album!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This series is so good! Make sure you read them in order. Took me only 3 days to read them! Enjoy!
0062059963|3.0|Alright, I'll be totally honest. I read this book in 3 hours while my parents left me stranded in a two stories B&N, and I couldn't afford to pile anymore books. After The Selection, I was really iffy on this book. I liked the first one, but I was really conflicted about the characters. This was more of the same.<br /><br />To quote an internet meme, things escalate quickly when The Elite gets started. As far as I can tell, this escalation comes about strictly to create tension between Maxon and America, since she seems to be leaning pretty heavily towards him instead of Aspen.  The character that instigates this tension is forcibly introduced in the first chapter, and there seems to be no basis for anything that happens besides it moving the love triangle along (and eventually making it a love quadrangle).  This was a frustrating starting point that basically continued throughout the rest of the novel.<br /><br />I love the character of America, I really do. When she's on her own, she is a fiercely independent woman who fights for what she thinks is right and has real considerations for the consequences of her actions. As far as I can tell, the things that keep screwing up her character are Maxon and Aspen. When her decisions involve either of them, she becomes a simpering, indecisive Mary Sue who's emotional reactions are the most poignant when she expresses jealousy. When she's alone, she has serious debates about the two of them and makes up her mind which one to choose multiple times. But then she gets back together with the other one and her mind gets scrambled by their maleness.<br /><br />At this point, I don't like either Maxon or Aspen. Aspen, for most of this book, was once again a background character. I have a hard time remembering why she cares about him, simply because none of his qualities are ever given a chance to shine, negative or positive. Maxon, on the other hand, I can't keep straight. The attempt to give his character more depth in this novel just made him seem completely bipolar. One minute he cares, one minute he doesn't (or does he?).  He's so wishy-washy I want to wring him out like a dish towel. I liked him the best after The Selection, but I've pulled away from that a lot now.<br /><br />And his character wasn't the only one that turned bipolar, either. There were several major players who seem to have woken up at random moments with no idea of who they were previously for the sake of the plot.<br /><br />Except, that is, America's maids. Can I get a whole book just with them, please?<br /><br />There's also the fact that I still understand nothing about the rebels everyone keeps talking about. This book also reminded me there's supposed to be some kind of a war going on with New Asia as well. America herself blows off any attempt at getting any information about any of these conflicts, so we can't learn anything through her. Anything outside the walls of the palace is shakily world built at best, and it leaves me feeling like the wars going on outside the palace and the attacks by the rebels really aren't important or dangerous at all.<br /><br />I am really just so torn about this book. On the one hand, America without Maxon or Aspen around is a great character, the kind I want as a best friend. Every time I get annoyed with the rest of the novel, I get a scene with her and it just makes everything better. But then Maxon or Aspen show up and she becomes this different person that just annoys me, and I just want to smack her. Every time she talks about how she loves them both equally I just want to hit my head on the desk, especially because at times she seems so sure about making a decision, but then backtracks on it just as fast. The characterization in these novels just keeps throwing me off, and that makes me really upset. Can these rebels that I still know nothing about just off Maxon and Aspen and leave America to lead the country on her own?

B00BG08FKK|5.0|I had borrowed a CD of this musical and am happy to have my own now.  I haven't listened to it clear through yet but so far so good.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|I like the concept of this game, all the puzzles were cool and I cannot wait for the next chapter!!!<br />The only thing I can complain about is the game was too short.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|The book opens a little slow but soon sucks you in. Enjoyable reading. Loved the twists and turns. Expertly written as usual.
B000SEHJGQ|4.0|A truly gritty semi-autobiographical work, this details aspects of Bukowski's childhood as he first moved from Germany (his country of birth: 1920) to Los Angeles and struggled through `The Great Depression' with no sense of family and a desire, simply to escape most all humanity.<br /><br />Harrowing is the level of cruelty enacted upon the primary character, Henry Chinaski and his psychological crippling afterward. Here's a character that, if he were pushed any further, exhibited sociopathic potential (he was deemed, in real life, unfit for military service post-psychological exam)... it strikes me as bizarre that his fan-base is, while cultish, still vast... certainly not someone to epitomize, nor make a hero, but certainly someone who can espouse some cold, hard truths about the darker side of human nature and their empathic deficiencies.<br /><br />My first read of anything done by Bukowski (I'll avoid the poetry, thanks) and apparently the best place to start, as it lends itself to chronicling his youth semi-realistically (but probably closer to reality than I suspect). It comes recommended if you don't mind reading about a coming-of-age through what feels like near persistent depravity and violence. We will see that even Chinaski has a heart (Bulldog v. kitten, 1236)... only it isn't open so broadly to welcome humanity - `it doesn't pay to trust another human being' (2086).<br /><br />We bear witness to Chinaski's views of growing up dirt poor during `The Great Depression'; Roosevelt, Hoover, the creation of the FBI as a reaction to Dillinger and the 1930's Chicago organized crime lords. Also detailed are: his father's complete humiliation in front of his family at an orange grove (136), his parents deceptive nature, particularly his father's driving to his `invisible job', but collectively - his parents imagined themselves above their lot in life (319). Through all of the experiences, Chinaski's truisms stand: `Not only did the grown-ups get mean, the kids got mean and even the animals got mean.' (1225) `At 25 most people were finished.'

B003LQ3YXU|5.0|At first I thought it wasn't all that. I watched a couple episodes, thought it was okay, but I couldn't stop watching it.<br />I usually don't get hooked on shows the way I did.<br /><br />Now I am a Whovian. How did this happen.
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|I will preface this by stating - this is quite different than what you've seen in the movie. I, like probably most, have seen the movie many times and had still refrained from reading the work by L. Frank Baum.<br /><br />Am I sorry I waited so long (I'm 28), and it seems almost a sin to have done so, for I am of the natural disposition that the book IS ALWAYS better than the movie. So goes my general experience and as such was the case here with this classic children's fairy tale. Which, of its own merits has received much praise as well as occasional flak, and only a good story can conjure both.<br /><br />Originally published today... 113 years ago (5.17.1900)... we encounter all the familiar characters: Dorothy, Toto, The Scarecrow, The Tin Woodsman and the Cowardly Lion.<br /><br />As is familiar to most, Dorothy is taken from Uncle Henry and Aunt Em by a cyclone which drops her off in the Land of Oz, a great (usually referred to as `terrible') and secretive wizard. In efforts to get herself back to Kansas, Dorothy must find Oz in the City of Emeralds which is located along the yellow brick road. She first encounters the Scarecrow whom needs some brains; then the tin woodsman, who, caught in a rainstorm rusted into position and being made completely of tin (as the wicked witch had cursed his axe to slowly dismember him until he had no flesh parts... yeah, that wasn't in the movie, huh?) had seized and been stationary for a year, he needs a heart.<br /><br />Between these two we enter a neat little philosophical debate:<br />Woodsman: `But once I had brains, and a heart also; so, having tried them both, I should much rather have a heart' (321).<br />Scarecrow: `I shall ask for brains instead of a heart; for a fool would not know what to do with a heart if he had one.' (349). To which the Tin Woodsman retorts: `I shall take the heart, for brains do not make one happy, and happiness is the best thing in the world.' (350).<br />Woodsman: `You people with hearts, have something to guide you, and need never do wrong; but I have no heart, and so I must be very careful.' (411).<br /><br />For the head or heart?<br /><br />Once the troupe is all together, we encounter many quick little adventures through the land of Oz, many that were not, nor could be, chronicled in the movie due to their graphic nature. Field mice rescuing the sleeping (drugged) lion from a poppy field (586). The Tin Woodsman killing 40 wolves (844); the Scarecrow killing 40 crows (`and twisted it's neck until it died.' (855).<br /><br />The characters eventually meet Oz. While inside the Emerald City it is imperative that they wear goggles, which are latched securely in place to prevent them from coming off (SPOILER: they give a green tint to everything...). Once here the characters are granted an audience by Oz, and their subsequent mission is: to kill the Wicked Witch of The West.<br /><br />She does her best to destroy the characters, nearly succeeding with the Tin Woodsman and the Scarecrow, but in attempting to steal Dorothy's silver shoes (those which once belonged to the Wicked Witch of the East) Dorothy gets angry and douses her with a bucket of water. `I'm melting!'<br /><br />Dorothy uses the Golden Cap to summon the Winged Monkeys, who relay their back-story (and one can empathize with them) while transporting the group back to the land of Oz, to once again visit the wizard and claim the rewards promised them: Kansas, brains, a heart and some courage. And that's where they discover the `humbug' behind the curtain.<br /><br />We also discover, if it hadn't already been picked up, that each character (except Dorothy) is already in full possession of the thing they desire - the Scarecrow is actually quite the strategist, the Tin Woodsman is incredibly kind and wishes to harm nothing nor nobody, and the lion is quite brave.<br /><br />After Oz unintentionally leaves without Dorothy see again feels abandoned, her only recourse is to visit the Good Witch of the South (Glenda). The troupe, after a few more story building adventures, make it to the South. Here Dorothy learns the power of her enchanted shoes and is thus able to return to Kansas, while each of the other member's travel to their respected dominions of rule.<br /><br />Still fantastic. 113 years post-facto.f the South (Glenda).

B00COGXX7A|2.0|the acting was not that good didn't hold interest..I think she should stick to dancing in my opinion  the end
B00CP2Z5TC|5.0|Different from the old stuff....but good. At first I was a little disappointed and it took me a few listens to appreciate it but now I really like it.
1476734941|5.0|PBS recently aired 3 programs about British Dr. Michael Mosley work. All 3 are exceptional documentaries about health, fitness and diet. As a lifelong dieter, I was very interested in what he calls the Fast Diet. The gist of the program is alternate day fasting. I chose to 'fast' 2 days a week. Actually, the fast days allow 500 calories for women and 600 calories for men. The fast days are not consecutive, so I fast Monday and Thursday. The rest of the week I eat whatever I want, within reason. But that can include a piece of birthday cake!<br /><br /> I lost 7 lbs. the first week. The thing is, I needn't give up all my favorite foods just try and eat sensibly the other 5 days of the week. I have eventually failed at every diet I've tried. So far, so good..I have lost 20 lbs in almost a month.<br />This is not your typical dieter's program..there's nothing to buy, other than the book itself or simply watch the PBS program. The diet is sensibly described and the science behind it is fascinating.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|This book is not predictable.  While Robe as a assassin for the American government is always an interesting character, this story is made more intriguing because it includes a street-smart 14-year-old.  And finally a little female companionship for Robie.  But there is great action and a thoughtful plot.
B009DJB8I2|5.0|Perfect super high quality soundtrack, very sharp and crisp, so many of them that it required 3 discs for them all! To top it off, a forth disc contains high quality audio of the soundtrack from the first game, including Jonathan Coulton's personal dub of 'Still Alive'

B000KUD2G4|5.0|I originally bought this to get rid of some hum i was getting when using my POD Pro in my 6505 effects loop. When i tried it initially for that, it killed my tone badly. I think the line level signal from the effects send was not ideal. Keep reading please as it turns out this is a great product....<br /><br />Fast forward 3-4 months later. I'm using a two amp set up with an A/B splitter - 1 side is my Dual Rec, the other side is my POD into a rocktron power amp - they are separate rigs into 2 separate cabs and i use an A/B switcher to switch back and forth between the amps (Loopmaster A/B is awesome, no bleed!). So of course i was getting hum/buzzing from the dual rec whenever the pod was also on next to it. I still had this Behringer box lying around - it took me a week or two to even give it another try - i had written it off as junk - finally I decided to put it between the A/B switch and the pod guitar input. It 100% killed the Dual Rec hum! And NO tone suck on the pod or the dual rec!! So for guitar --> this box --> amp (or pod in my case) chain it does not suck tone and works like a charm for ground loops caused by two amps running in stereo. In my case, i put it in front of the amp that was CAUSING the ground loop (my pod) rather than the amp that i was HEARING the buzz from (the dual rec) and it killed the hum on the dual rec - again no tone suck on either amp. I velcroed it to the side of my pedal board and she'll stay there as long as i run a two amp set up. Great product! I was about to buy the Hum-x plug for $70 before giving this one last shot - glad i did, $70 saved!
B0016Q2D5M|5.0|This is a great movie that is educational and exciting. I highly recommend it for all ages. Also good for teachers to show during geology units.
B00CDSVZHY|3.0|I have been a Tarantino fan for a while. As with many directors, not all of their films are hits. This is the case with Django Unchained. It's not a bad film with poor acting; on the contrary, it is a descent film with good acting all around. However, I thought the story would be better. It got somewhat ridiculous at times with over-the-top gun fights that took me out of the movie at times.<br /><br />So, if you want to kill a couple of hours and don't care either way if what you're watching is a top-caliber film, then you'll enjoy this one. After all, it's &#34;okay&#34;.
B00BMCLCG6|5.0|This is a good album. They are good at keeping their music current but touching on classic Bon Jovi sound.
B001EN71CW|5.0|As other reviewers have said, this is the best science fiction TV show ever. I get a twinge in my chest every time I think about it.<br />The characters were interesting, fun, charming, dynamic and had incredible chemistry. The story was plausible, rendered with depth and layers and has so many places to go. I just cannot believe that it was cancelled. still. cannot. believe. I still want more, and I'm ready to pay for it!
B000VNMMR0|5.0|Although this is not nearly as awesome as the first one, or the third, it is pretty good. It is hard to go wrong with John McClane!
B0049J3RBC|4.0|So I watch movies purely for entertainment (as opposed to some high brow reviewers) and this one delivers.  It's a bit predictable but, come on, it's a kids movie.  That said, adults will enjoy it too.  It's funny, well paced and generally delivers through out the film.
B00CL68NOG|4.0|I thought this movie may be very predictable but I enjoy both of the lead actors so much so I thought I'd give it a viewing. It was funny and charming. I hope Barbra doesn't go into retirement too soon!
B00B5JVXYC|4.0|This is my favorite way to kill time when I have to wait anywhere and just to relax in the evenings. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />The only complaints I have are that you have to pay per pack after the first few, and that the puzzles feel repetitive sometimes, but for me it was worth the money and I didn't mind the occasional deja vu.
B005OYF57A|5.0|You know when I was reading the name yes even the name. Started a new mystery. Why was shurlock homes named shurlock homes!!! And I think I found out the answer!

B001J6NZGU|5.0|Yea so it is not the best movie in the world but it is cure and made me giggle so I love it!!!!!
B00CDFWJIG|4.0|good movie with a very slow start. I didn't read the book but the movie was very good.I would rent before I decide to purchase the movie. The fantasy, science fiction, gothic  romance just might not do it for those who are true hard core science fiction fans
B009YQJ322|5.0|Karl Urban is fine fine fine, you never see his face but damn he has a hott voice. Also, the movie came in great awesome condition, thankyou.
B00B9JDBSO|5.0|Shaking The Habitual is one of those albums i will never forget about. There is absolutely nothing like it and i for one love every track on this album. A stand out track for me though is most definitely \\"Stay out Here\\" because of how creepy the song itself is and how at the same time, so easy to dance to. Tracks range from dance beats, industrial, drone, to experimental which adds a ton of variety to this whole project.<br />  I will admit though, this album is most definitely not for everyone, but if you want to hear something out of this world and completely insane, check this beast out.
B00BGIC2J2|4.0|Enjoyed this movie, it was a total Paul Rudd movie and it was odd but fun.  I'd recommend it for a light comedy.
B001QL5MAA|1.0|The author takes his time introducing his world and his characters, and in a way he succeeds in creating an interesting backdrop for the story you hope will start to take shape as the book progresses. This, unfortunately never happens. The characters remain flat and uninteresting to the point where I just don't care what happens to them. Any opportunity to create some form of interest is squandered again and again as the author seems unable to care for or understand the characters he is using in his attempt at telling a story. For a long time the reader is simply told that the stakes are high, but is not let in on why. It could have been interesting if done right, but it just feels like you're left out as the author almost childishly tries to draw out the suspense with his stick figure characters. You're left thinking that the final revelation better be worth it. I can't tell you if it is. I didn't care enough to finish the book.
B00BEOYPCK|5.0|While I was already a Kurt Vile fan, this album really impressed me. I can't think of an album in recent history that I have listened to more frequency than this one, it has been on constant rotation at our house. Chill, spacey, but somehow more upbeat than previous KV albums. Gorgeous music. Enjoy!

B001DJLCRC|5.0|I was not a fan when it first started, but ever since I started streaming it on Netflix I could not stop watching it and it has hooked me ever since.  This was truly an amazing way to start things off with some brilliant performances by the two lead actors.  I have always been a fan of Vince Gilligan's work on the X-files too so this was like watching more of that.  Can't wait for the 5th season finale!
B00CATSONE|5.0|I really loved the book.  in svhool<br /><br />I really enjoyed the book.  In school ,<br /><br />, we are taught of Edison's genius, where Tesla received little more than a footnote.  VERY enlightening, a truly great read.
0812415027|5.0|One of the best books ever.  It is witty, charming, sad and happy.  I rank this book at the top.
B00CRWJ7VC|4.0|This is a movie that will require your full attention. It has several interlaced narratives that tell a story that spans centuries. The cast is extraordinary!
1878424319|5.0|Give it as a gift to a friend and the can't stop talking about it.  Awesome book to share with a friend.
000728487X|4.0|This is a good read. Goldacre demolishes bad scientific reporting, the 'natural therapies' industry, and how scientific illiteracy is actually promoted within educational institutions.  This book will appeal especially to readers in the U.K. as many of Goldacre's examples - and his excoriating assessment of Gillian McKeith - may not be familiar to those in other countries.  The only discordant note Goldacre strikes is towards the end of the book, where he launches into a rather bizarre and unnecessary invective against \\"liberal arts graduates\\".  One wonders whether he was bitten as a child.
0061128562|5.0|this set is so cute...it is hard to tell from the picture but it is a mini version. It has the same story but just a mini sized book and CD set!
0920668372|5.0|A friend introduced me to this wonderful book 27 years ago when our oldest son was 4 years old.  I introduced it to his pre-school teacher who introduced it to the entire pre-school faculty and staff.  As part of the Mother's Day program that year, my son's teacher had all the children and mothers sit around her while she read this story aloud to all of us.  The director passed by and asked why all the mothers were crying.  When she saw what the teacher was reading &#34;Love You Forever&#34;, she said, &#34;Of course.&#34; :-)  It is a story about a mother who loves her son, no matter the challenging stages that he goes through as he matures.  It shows how that love doesn't end, but continues after the mother is gone and now the grown-up son continues the bond of love with his own baby daughter.  I have bought this book for all of our children, nieces, nephews and friends children when they had their own babies.  It is a very special book.

B0013KTGAG|1.0|After reading some reviews I was looking forward to seeing this. I love good sci-fi movies but I wouldn't consider this \\"good\\". Don't waste your money.
B00BHU9BV6|1.0|I love Keira Knightly. However, I was very disappointed in watching this movie. This did not do Keira any justice.<br /><br />The movie was set in a small set - seemed smaller than my home. It would have been more powerful if they actually made real sets or set it in a real home/mansion/ dance hall, etc. Please be careful in watching this. Wait until it is on Prime Instant Videos. Save your money.
B000SEKNUK|4.0|I enjoyed this book.  Same principles as Power of Now, Chopra etc, but presented in a way that makes it easy to apply 3 months from now.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I read this book because of a recommendation from a member of my book club. I enjoyed Ms. Flynn's clever organization of plot, construction of thoughts and sentences, and wonderfully descriptive writing, as in the reporter \\"mosquitoing\\" around him. But I found no character that I liked and wanted to root for: Amy was heartless and psycho, and Nick was wimpy and untrue to his marriage vows. However, these aspects provided lively and thoughtful discussion for my bookclub!

B001ANSSDC|5.0|It was a moving story about the mental health problems some unfortunate encounter. The book makes aware of the  difficulties they encounter.

B009MYARIK|4.0|Fun but somewhat predictable, this book follows the stories of two sisters who are successful career women on the outside and huge emotional messes on the inside.  It's worth a read if you like her novels but if this is your first then try her Shopaholic series instead.
B007SGM084|5.0|I held off but finally caved and bought The Fifty Shades trilogy!  Glad that I did.  Captivating, couldn't put it down.  Am now to reading the next series.  She is a very well &#34;researched&#34; writer!
B00AYJCEVK|5.0|Darlene Zscheck never fails to amaze me. The vocals and arrangements of these songs are stellar. I am thrilled with it.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I was engaged. Although the main character, through most of this story, was not anything I would call loveable, the author was able to keep me engaged in her tale. She did this through the interelated stories of the many supporting characters that drift through the main characters life. They seemed to me to be continually trying to nourish what seemed an unredeemable spirit. Yet, as unredeemable as she seemed she had one element as if a small seed of redeemability. That was her love of the language of flowers. This juxtaposition of personal ugliness and aesthetic appreciation had the ability of breeding hope in this story that seems to be leading to sadness and hopelessness.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|This was just an order for batteries, but I had a very good experience.  The batteries were a quality brand, very inexpensive, and delivered in a very reasonable time.  There was no postage applied to my purchase and I would definitely use this distributor for future purchases.

B009JZTOG8|3.0|I have to say I was kind of disappointed in season two of Once Upon a Time. I felt like some episodes were really good, but a lot of them lacked what I was initially drawn to in the prior season. My hope is season three will be better, otherwise I may quit watching.
B008OOYALE|1.0|It looks good but is awful. It takes forever to evolve dragons, and to do that, you need food. But food is so expensive. EVERYTHING is expensive. You will run out of money before you know it. If you are looking for a good, less expensive dragon app, look for dragonvale. You will be happy I said this.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I liked this book because the characters were developed so I cared about them and wanted to know what happened to them.  It surprised me in that I didn't expect to be caught up in the book so completely, but I really got into the characters and their lives.  This was a nice story about people who didn't have the best of lives but made the most of what they did have.  Yet, they felt incomplete and happily had that resolved at the end of book.
1609611543|5.0|This is a GREAT book.  I started total wheat removal 4 weeks ago after finishing the book.  I have lost 9# but that is just a bonus.  The real reward it decreased  pain and abundant energy.<br /><br />My suggested reading for anyone who seriously wants to feel younger.  I'm 62 and feel 25 (I'm working hard as if I was 25, also.).  This should be required reading. I'm eating healthier and happier than I have in years.  Probably the best part for &#34;dieters&#34; is the total loss of cravings.  I now eat because I have to, not because I am particularly hungry.  Good quality, healthy food tastes wonderful.  I'm enjoying vegetables, meat and nuts like never before.  AND I NEVER FEEL DEPRIVED OR HUNGRY.<br /><br />I have friends who are &#34;sort of&#34; losing the wheat. And it is not really working for them.  Go 100% for 1 month, or forget it.

B00005JKN9|5.0|Maybe if you look at \\"Gangs of New York\\" simply as history you will lose patience with it, but if you are into Scorsese's aesthetic then you will love it. Daniel Day-Lewis is astonishing and hilarious here (there are a couple of shocking moments of violence, but nothing too extreme--I thought \\"Goodfellas\\" was way more violent than this), and I think that his fabricated Bill the Butcher character is one of the classics of modern cinema. If you can imagine a petulant combination of Groucho Marx and Wild Bill Hickok speaking a New York American accent and having an absurdly graceful talent with throwing sharp knives, then you can imagine Day-Lewis's thoroughly authentic and inspired character. DeCaprio might be miscast here (as the Amazon reviewer mentions) but I for one think he is pretty damn good. \\"Gangs of New York\\" is a revenge story and there is some roughhousing here, but I enjoyed it over all, and I think Scorsese is having a field day here, so to speak. This is definitely an American film in every sense, and I liked it a lot. The period detail is great really, and although Scorsese employs some dubious CGI shots along the way, I still like his love letter to old New York. There are so many cinematic references in Scorsese's movies that watching them can be like a textbook reading if you really know your cinema history, but \\"Gangs of New York\\" is so full of enthusiasm, action, nasty dialogue (from the Butcher, who else?) and graceful cinematography that its pure cinematic scope allows one to sink into its atmosphere with ease. Another Scorsese classic.

B00AEBBAEU|5.0|This film contains Daniel Day-Lewis at his most frightening and his most moving. Rarely do we see real actors in movies anymore, but here is one, and boy is he on his game in this classic! P. T. Anderson's script wisely avoids trying to be too entertaining, as the atmosphere and scope of the movie more than make up for its more internal journey. If you love Day-Lewis then I have to say that, for my money, this is his best performance ever, doing one better than \\"My Left Foot\\" and far surpassing the subtlety of his \\"Lincoln.\\" The history of oil drilling in itself is a fascinating subject, and what a subject for a film that it is. After years of suffering through idiotic sequels, arty films that are more farty than arty, comedies that think humor is about being grotesque, and dramas that drag their feet to the guillotine, this is one film that more than makes up for the lack of Interesting Cinema that we've been experiencing. There is no need for me to rehash the plot, the characters, etc. Just watch it. If Plainview isn't one of the most striking misanthropic characters in film history, then I've missed something. Scarier than Bill the Butcher, more driven than Newland Archer, and more interior than Lincoln, Plainview is a representation of one character's suffering and hatred that builds to an almost unthinkable confrontation. Truly unique among the files of modern American cinema.

B00012FXAE|2.0|First off, I must say that 20th century Fox has done a wonderful job on these DVDs. This is the way to put together extras for a film. I've never felt cheated with these special editions. The picture is widescreen, the aspect ratio is correct, the sound (and the sound design) is powerful on the disc. The DVD box, too, is collectible.<br />On the negative side, this movie is probably the worst that I've seen in ages. The original &#34;Alien&#34; was a horror film of the highest shock caliber, not much of a story but certainly an inventive and memorable freak-show. This deplorable film by James Cameron misinterprets the original story's intentions by turning the franchise into an action series of the most simple-minded caliber (essentially, this is a dumb monster movie with far too much footage of Bill Paxton screaming like a woman and those horrible monster faces--whereas the original didn't show the monster much at all). The sound design in the original was very horror-themed and creepy, but here it's all slam-bang and no scares. I just think a sequel to the original was unnecessary (despite the cynicism required in today's world), but if they had to do it, why reduce such potential to the predictable formula of a silly action movie?<br />The extras are quite revealing if one is paying attention, and apparently illustrate that Cameron is a psycho. The extra on composer James Horner nearly had me crying, as the Cameron/Anne Hurd team apparently treat their talent with as much contempt as the story's subject matter. And I thought the &#34;Halloween&#34; sequels (other than 3) were cynical--boy, nothing like this!<br />Overall, I did not enjoy this film, but again the DVD presentation (and the extras) is fine. But if you like the original &#34;Alien&#34; film, I would strongly suggest you use caution before buying into Cameron's intellectual hijacking of a potentially great series (too bad).
B001LA3LYU|5.0|I've been listening to Jeff Beck since the 1960's, back when the Yardbirds contended with the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, and The Who for the top of the charts alongside Jan and Dean and the Beach Boys. Most of them are still around, legends all; but Jeff Beck has evolved his style, melding elements of the Blues, Rock, and Jazz into a truly unique expression that boggles the mind. Add the drumming power and precision of Vinnie Colaiuta and the phenomenal bass guitar of the Aussie prodigy Tal Wilkenfeld, blend in the smooth keys of Jason Rebello and you have a band that brings joy to the music. The audio mix in this album is superb, and Jeff shows off what remains an evolving set of skills on his Strat with songs most of us will recognize. BRILLIANT!
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|A great achievement in art direction, with visual details creating convincing shifts though time. There is a lot of grey area explored in this story. Thoughtful and optimistic.

0671015206|5.0|This book has some very sound advice. Always live within your means and focus some time and energy to plan for your future. Save and invest wisely! I sat down and read this book in just a couple of sittings. Well worth the money. Once you have finished, pass it on to someone else. They will thank you!
B00571F26Y|5.0|This book is beyond excellent!  I listened to the audio version, and then purchased the kindle version for my daughter, who is allergic to wheat.  My daughter-in-law also has Celiac disease, so wheat is a big issue in our families.  I could relate to the &#34;wheat is my crack&#34; comment, being &#34;addicted&#34; to bread. I stopped eating bread several years ago and lost about 75 lbs.  The whole lesson in where wheat originally came from and how it has evolved was so interesting, and made a huge impact on my food choices now.  I think Dr. Davis hit the nail on the head with this book. It should be a &#34;must read&#34; for anyone with diabetes, and for everyone who just wants to feel better by some simple food choices, instead of a pharmacy.

B001JAFYFG|4.0|This is a difficult Film fo me to review fairly,as I have some fond memories of taking a lovely girl to see it in the theatre,on a motorcycle as a young man.<br />The movie itself,is a very good-natured science fiction cautionary tale which is enjoyable & thought-provoking,about a dystopian future world.Life for the people,who live in a protected domed city,is filled with pleasure & they want for little.One little problem; they are not allowed to live past 30.Most just accept this arrangement as normal.The story revolves around some,who are not so happily disposed towards the situation.<br />The characters are involving & memorable & you become involved with their predicament.Of particular note are \\"Old Man\\",a young Farrah Fawcett as the technical assistant in the \\"New You\\" shop,& an achingly attractive Jenny Agutter as Jessica 6.<br />The special effects are slightly dated,but feel organic & add to the fun.<br />I owned this on DVD & the Blu-Ray is a definite improvement,but the scene-to-scene quality varies as to clarity,color saturation & grain.I think most of this is due to an incompletely restored source.Still,the flaws are not sufficient to be very distracting.<br />The sound,is very good,with a couple of noticeable instances of dialog murkiness.The surrounds are used very sparingly.<br />All in all this is a fun,uplifting & charming little film & short of a full-on frame by frame restoration,the best it will ever look & sound.<br />Very recommended for Sci-Fi & apocalypse movie lovers.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Love this game I get to draw and Hess pictures of other people  and free great game I would suggest it
B005LAJ1H2|5.0|My favorite character in this show is Michael Kenneth Williams as Albert \\"Chalky\\" White, who was also my favorite actor in WIRED, where he played the gay guy who made a living stealing from drug dealers.  When Michael Kenneth Williams is on-screen I'm having a great time.  There is an extended sequence of \\"Chalky\\" in jail that is awesome.<br /><br />I checked out Season Two from the local library, and got a surprise.  I'm going to be watching all the other seasons.<br /><br />I was surprised to see Bugsy Siegel cut out of all the meetings where decision making happened; even to the point of sending him away so he wouldn't be present and offend the other people in the meet.

B004J4WLB4|4.0|The kind of book you think about for days afterward. The insight I received in view of foster children was unexpected. The struggle of finding trust and feeling loved as children is something we take for granted. It's an eye opening book to make you more tolerant of kids who may be acting out in a negative way, and not just foster children. I highly recommend this book.
B005NKGEP2|5.0|This International Intrigue novel is really hard to review without spoilers.  So this will be short.<br /><br />Kate & Dexter love each other deeply, but each has a Gi-Normous secret kept from the other.  Another couple becomes &#34;involved.&#34;  The twists, turns, loops, etc., that they experience are gripping reading.  Their love and commitment are tested.  Shocking ending!<br /><br />Highest recommendation for the genre.

1439153663|4.0|A well-written book; however, for me, it was very upsetting.  Being fiction - quite a story, filled with so much that touches your heart.  I'm sure most people would call it a good book, and I know that it is, but I can't personally use that word because there was so much cruelty and depravity.  Yes there was a lot of love in it, too - and a lot to warm your heart, but, for me,  the extreme cruelty is what stays with me.  Called historical fiction, I would have liked to have read a lot more &#34;history.&#34;
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|this game is a lot better to play with friends than random people. who try to cheat and just write out the word or whatever to get points. wheres the fun in that??
B00BESFWBY|3.0|A lot of &#34;based on a true story&#34; movies are very very good, but this one not so much.  Mostly to do with marginal acting by the main character and the often hard to follow story.  2cents worth.

B000QCS8TW|5.0|Very enjoyable and well written book.I had a hard time putting it down. I was already a fan of the TV show, but I can safely say I liked the book even more. If you're looking for a story with clearly defined good and evil and a plot that wraps up nicely at the end, this isn't it. However, if you're looking for a story with a multitude of intricate story lines and character arcs, then I would highly recommend this.

B007EECSFA|5.0|Although I read many books, I usually don't write book reviews.  I had to write one for this book to relay that this is a must-read book!  Kate Morton switches between characters and brings the reader into each person's story.  As the perspective would change from one character to another, I found myself disappointed at first with each change in not being able to continue reading from the perspective I had been reading...only to find myself wanting to continue more with the next character.  The story is woven in great detail over many years.  It is a book you will continue to think about even when the book is finished. In fact, I'm thinking of reading it again.  Now that I know how it ends, I'm sure I'll see many more details upon the second reading that I may not have noticed the first time.
B0079XNWQA|5.0|Expresses the many faces of love... passionate, tender, honest and much more. Jason's music starts and ends my day with beauty, joy, and inspiration.
B00BN3ECTS|5.0|This Movie Safe Haven from the book by Nicholas Sparks is a winner.  I loved this movie. It has a storyline that keeps your interest.  A love story as well as mystery and suspense.

Have seen it  in the theaters, ordered this DVD at Amazon and will continue to enjoy this selection on screen as I did the book I also ordered at Amazon.

B0036S4C6G|5.0|Great read, while it wasn't the best book i read, it is now one of my favorites. It was the feel of the movies traffic and crash. Where the book plays out in multiple characters lives and towards the end how their lives interjoin. Really enjoyed the narration by Roxanne Ortega, her style of reading was fun and engaging. She brought and depth and profile to each character that you might not experienced on your own. I will definitely read this book again & again.

B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I've read the books 8 times (now on my 9th).  Last year I read The Hobbit to my son and he fell in love too.  Tolkien is such a brilliant storyteller!  The movies are wonderful, but they don't mirror the original story--lots of liberties taken so as to condense the storyline.  I so very much wish they'd made it into a longer series of movies instead (several for each book), because there's so much of the story that wasn't told which IS relevant to the storyline, and it would've kept people coming back for many years.  But perhaps someday someone will do that!

0345529057|5.0|This series is awesome. I have paperbacks and the kindle version of each book, but as the books fell apart after being read through by 3 people, I wanted replacements to sit on my book shelf. This book package does not include the most recent (as of summer '13) book &#34;A Dance with Dragons&#34;. Also, the books are squeezed into the case tightly, and the case is pretty weak so it tore at one corner when I tried pull a book out. Still not worth complaining about though.

B003ITZBVI|5.0|I am not a die hard Batman fan of the comics (the reason being that DC has no idea how to keep themselves organized without the word 'Crisis' involved). That said, this animated feature is based on the pages of the original Batman comicbook, notably \\"A Death In The Family\\" (1988), and the original \\"Under the Red Hood\\". As an adaptation from the comics, I cannot criticize how far it strays from the source material or how well it stays true to form. This artwork seen here is gorgeous, and almost sets a new standard for what a cartoon should look like. The coloring on Nightwing, the shade on Bruce, and realism of nighttime Gotham's background.<br /><br />What this does for a causal fan myself is entertain me using one of the different portrayals of the titular character. Death and Life are addressed, as are different philosophies in the wake of underworld crime and terrorism. Batman faces his greatest challenge in the film: to fight a long lost friend that he has practically embedded the best use of gadgets, combat, and recognizable resources to.<br /><br />On a side note: while the Joker is the main attraction for any Batfreak or Batfreak pending, the crimelord BlackMask is not a very well known villain and this Blue Ray provides the perfect opportunity to get to know who he is, in an attempt to explore frequently unseen sides to the Batman Rouge's gallery. In the future that Batman takes a break from the classic villains, what you see here may or may not spike your interest.<br /><br />Now for the voice acting: as a fan who grew up with Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamills portray of Batman and the Joker throughout the 90's and afterward, I can proudly declare that the audience is put in very good hands when they listen to these different actors. John DiMaggio's Joker is something to celebrate as Hamill himself retired the role, and the Batman will always have a Joker. For those of you who want a more direct understanding, go to youtube and type in \\"Don't give The Joker a Glass of water\\" or think 'Evil Bender' from Futurama. It's the perfect advertising tool to whether or not you will be drawn to this film.<br /><br />As someone who is very selective of stories, Under the Red Hood inspired me to start collecting DC animations for the very first time  :Dlass of water\\" or think 'Evil Bender' from Futurama.

B003U53GK8|5.0|I watched most of the series years ago when it was first aired. I found the show much more enjoyable this time. The lack of commercials is nice, but it is the ability to watch several episodes each week that really makes a difference. It was just so much easier to follow this way.
B007A2O3FO|4.0|This film has a unique story line and is really very well done.  It's fun to see a lot of our favorite British actors featured here.

B001FOR5XU|4.0|Many notable horror authors rank Richard Matheson's I Am Legend  as one of their top ten horror novels of all time. However, if you crave a lot of bloodletting in your horror stories like Jack Ketchum's Off Season or Jack Kilborn's Afraid, this tale may disappoint since Robert Neville is  the only human on earth the vampires can tap for blood.<br /><br />Many consider this book the forerunner and  inspiration for George Romero's Night of the Living Dead, the currently popular The Walking Dead, and all the other such zombie tales where hordes of the undead attack the living in a world gone mad.<br /><br />Unlike some other horror stories where the degree of excessive acts of depravity seem almost cartoonish like the relentless pain and suffering inflicted on Wile E. Coyote by the Road Runner, Matheson keeps his story completely somber, dark, and as serious as a heart attack throughout. If there is anything about it that bothered me as I turned the pages, it was the stark absence of a sense of humor commonly found in the works of some other horror writers like Stephen King, who seem to find a degree of levity in the story no matter how much blood is splattering. This book reminds me of H. P. Lovecraft in its morbidity.<br /><br />The story opens with Robert Neville,  the last real man on earth, living in a world where a mysterious virus has not only killed all other human life, but it has caused the dead to reanimate with the sole intent of drinking the blood of the living. Neville has survived unscathed because he was once bitten by a vampire bat while traveling in Central America. Neville tries desperately to cope with the loneliness and horror of the current times, but he continually sinks in and out of depression, drunkenness,  and thoughts of suicide after his wife and daughter succumbed to the disease, and he had to deal with their journey into the world of the undead.<br /><br />Neville is a lonely soul who longs for the company of another human being in his personal fortress besieged by vampires who thirst for his blood nightly. Neville has to pump up the volume when the sun goes down to drown out the incessant cries of the blood suckers, led by his former friend and neighbor, who keep calling his name all through the night for him to give up and let them drink the last true blood on earth. It makes you wonder what they will do at night once Neville is out of the picture.<br /><br />During the day, Neville travels about the remains of a desolate Los Angeles sightseeing, searching for supplies and equipment to restock his shelves, but mostly, to find dormant monsters while they sleep and drive a stake through their hearts. Afterward, he is faced with the unpleasant task of carting the smelly double-dead corpses across town to a huge crater where he dumps and burns them.<br /><br />Rather than rehashing the familiar vampire legends found in Bram Stoker's Dracula, Matheson adds a more scientific spin on vampirism. In his novel, his protagonist researches and analyzes everything he can find about the black death of the middle-ages and the similarities to the current plague. He also conducts experiments with blood samples of the living dead, and tries to understand how and why garlic, crosses, sunlight, holy water, and stakes through the heart affect them.<br /><br />After the beginning of the book has demoralized the reader in a hopeless world where the last human is on a collision course to oblivion in one grisly form or another, Matheson finally lifts the reader's spirit with Neville finding and, after exhibiting the patience of Job, befriending an old dog. The encounter is only a brief flicker of light at the end of a very dark tunnel, but it at least presents the possibility that things can improve no matter how black the world around him becomes. Afterward, his spirit and ours is lifted again when Neville discovers a woman basking in the midday sun who, consequently, must not be a vampire. His undying hope that he couldactually have a lasting relationship with another human like himself catapults him from the doldrums of depression to contemplating the possible renewal of the human race with a serum created from his own and possibly the woman's non-contaminated blood.<br /><br />Richard Matheson is a giant in the annals of horror in print, on TV, and on the big screen, This is his most notable work.

Otherwise its a really good series the first book was very well done had me gripping to my kindle for dear life and the second was just as amazing. I would defiantly read this series again and recommend it to everyone
B004EPZ00M|5.0|Johnny English is back....in spades!  This one will not disappoint fans of the earlier version.  Watched it with husband and teenage grandson and they laughed until they cried.  Rowan Martin once again displays why he is master of the subtle...and not so subtle physical comedy.  While I really missed the added comedy that Ben Miller supplied as sidekick in the first one the twists and turns with the Oriental cleaning lady were priceless!  I am hoping that he will do another one I can add to my collection.

B000W967UQ|5.0|I will unapologetically confess that I love Terry Pratchett's sense of humor!  I shared this book with my book club...with nothing deeper in mind than &#34;he makes me laugh&#34;.  I love that Death gets all the &#34;good lines&#34;.  If you appreciate a British sense of humor, you should give this book a try.

B0042TV4IW|5.0|It is such a treat to watch Lark Rise to Candleford.  I enjoy it so much, I plan to watch all 4 seasons!
B005HSG3TC|4.0|The case is great.  Does everything as advertised.  I have a Zagg shield on my Kindle, and the soft inner lining of the screen flap leaves an irremovable &#34;stain&#34; on the shield.  Very annoying when there is a perfectly clear line down the middle of the screen where the cover does not touch, and on the sides there is a dark area from the lining.<br /><br />Great case, just be aware of this issue.
B00CKOYVG8|4.0|It's a great addition to Birds .. but I do not have (nor want) a Facebook account so I'm disappointed that one is required to continue on ... since I am not competitive with others.<br /><br />So I will continue with the Practice Round until I run out of games to play.
0812993845|3.0|While I don't think that even the most loyal Sophie Kinsella fans would argue that Wedding Night is her best book to date. it does deliver most of what we have come to expect from an SK book. It is a light undemanding but entertaining page turner that made me laugh out loud in many places and had me rooting for Fliss and Lottie to get happy endings to their pretty preposterous but fun storylines. I'd highly recommend it to Kinsella fans and anyone else who enjoys a good, funny romance.
B0063IH60K|5.0|once you start you can't quit. It's a great way to pass the time. I recomend this app to everyone.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|a flight hanger for sure not sure I wanted to fly commercial after seeing this movie but Denzel is great and it is a good very good great movie
B009R659L8|5.0|As usual, Mary HIggins Clark writes a super book that couldn't be put down with a surprise ending.  I really liked iet.
B006VFLIYK|1.0|I've tried, but after 7 chapters, I give up.  The book reads like it was written by a 10th grader in an English composition class - and not a good student either!  If you like LOTS of short sentences that begin with \\"He\\", you're going to love this book.  Now we have another John Puller-type character; he just works for another (nameless) government agency and he travels all over the world killing people.  I didn't think it was possible to write a more preposterous book than \\"Zero Day\\", but after 7 chapters, I'm convinced that Baldacci has done it.  Well I'm not going to waste any more time with this dud and I'm not going to waste any more money on Baldacci books either.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I use It on the kindle what the the don't let you do multiplayer that is so stupid I am serious problem I am sad please make that you don't use jail break. Kindles don't gave that please or will be:(
B000HWZ4A2|5.0|Wow!  I was ten years old when the movie came out.  My interest in Rand was spurred when I read this at my daughter and son in laws home in Tucson.  I simply could not put it down.  Rand's characterizations are key to the story.  If you cannot absorb them you loose sight of being who you are, not letting the petty overwhelm you, there is undefined evil and malice.  Powerful.  And yes she is about letting the market rule.  Thank goodness.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|The game is really fun and addictive to play, but it freezes up from time to time and you have to log out and then back in to get it to work again.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Works excellent on my Kindle. The sound effects are a bit annoying but at least you can turn them off. Overall I love this game.
B00CCZ4BFQ|4.0|I wasn't sure quite what to expect with this album, but I'm glad I bought it.  Tom's mix of genres serves him well on this album.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I wanted a calculator to check on my fabrics and other things. This is marvelous. It is just what i wanted.
B00COHAUD4|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. I expected stupid plotless shock filled bloody mess. Not so much. Had a plot and story that made sense. Was surprising enough and predictable enough.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I play this game all the time it is very addictive. It catches your attention and makes it hard to put down.
B0040I09RM|5.0|I've been watching for the last few seasons, but realized I had never watched the first season so I gave it a watch.
B00B9EQS98|4.0|Just plain cute and seeing the monsters in a different way than in the movies I loved watching when I was a kid was a real hoot.

B0083H6AQA|5.0|Great story and seeing Robert Pattinson naked makes it even better. Costumes were beautiful and the setting of being in Paris (old time Paris ) was fantastic.
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|I enjoy all of his books. I forget which ones I've read but read a lot of them twice. good story line
B0071XO8RA|2.0|jumps around a bunch... lost interest at some parts but it wasn't terrible. It could have been much better, in my opinion.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|loving every minute of this series - great way to learn about history and culture in G. Britain.  Makes you appreciate what life<br />was like for some people at the beginning of the 20th C.  Such great acting as well.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|really good storyline and very interesting. It also gets you thinking about the bigger picture of life and (for me) about spirituality in a new way.
B00985E3UG|5.0|An informative look into the tactics used by the food industry to sell their products and keep us hooked on their brand.  Many of the major snack and soft drink companies are discussed regarding their marketing schemes to out maneuver the competition.
0743244249|4.0|To be honest i only read this because i wanted to read it before the movie came, and I found myself liking in some strange sort of way, I was interesting reading and makes me with i could find more like this. I like to have a few odd stories to keep my reading juices flowing.
B00AFROVQC|3.0|the story seems a mixture of harry potter merlin and several other fantasy stories.and not very original in its theme
B008CLI3TE|5.0|Cant wait to see the show every weekend and now i have the chance to watch it every time i wanted with high quality, excellent sound and extras.
B008AK8FHM|1.0|It's not a Christian view of heaven. If you believe in Christ this book is not for you. Heaven is just a 'loving' place for all. This will help sell the book to agnostics and atheists and increase the market share.
B00520R146|5.0|My son loves Toy Story 3.  My wife and I like the story too.  It's an amazing story.  It's a good story for young kids.
B000003N89|5.0|Diana shows what a master she is at her craft. A wondeful tribute to Nat and a great collection of music to add to ones collection. I never get tired of listening to it. The musicianship of all the artists in this cd is marvelous. Deserves far more than 5 stars.
B003DZX3SA|5.0|My twin kids love this story.  They ask us to show them this DVD all the time.  For me, as an adult, it's a typical Disney story.
B005UG53NS|5.0|Who doesn't love Harry Potter?!  Well, I am sure there a ton of ppl.  But, this was awesome and I am very happy I got to see it finally.  Would recommend!
0896898288|5.0|This is an amazing book I would suggest for any quilter out there. 111 different vintage quilt blocks, with full instructions on making each one along with a CD that contains all the patterns needed. The book includes very old letters for each of the blocks so you get a very good peek into history as well. LOVE it.
B00395ZYVS|5.0|Profoundly moving story of family, love, and resilience.  The writer captures the complexities of Life and relationships in their full beauty.
B00CP2Z5TC|4.0|Aside from Diane Young and Unbelievers, this album significantly has a slower average bpm than either of the previous albums.<br /><br />I am a fan of Vampire Weekend. And they have retained their unique style and feel.<br />The album definitely feels like the closing of the &#34;trilogy&#34;
B0096HK46S|3.0|I  have read many reviews on this movie giving it raves.  I thought it was just an interesting B movie.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Not my usual choice in viewing, (violence and gore) but this series is spell binding.  Bold, intense, explicit.  Characters are larger than life.
B0041KKYCY|5.0|A little hard to watch and not for young adults. It was good and it will go in my stack of other b movies i love
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Really like this app. Very colorful and educational. Helps you to learn what kinds of fish and plants are in the ocean.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|Naomi Watts was powerful in this film. The direction of the kids was heart wrenching. The effects were awesome in the true sense of the word. Ewan McGregor was great, as he always is,  when he was on screen. I felt It was Naomi's movie though. With that being said, the eldest son should deserve high credits. He added a lot to the film's impact. I was glad the film narrowed its focus on the family instead of involving too many extraneous characters.
B004SIPA4G|5.0|Saw this great film on sale and since I was given a blue ray player for christmas, I just had to add to my collection.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|This show brings to life the comic that grabs the attention of comic nerds and normal geeks alike. While not staying complete true to the comic(due to transition issues) the show is able to grasp and wrestle with intense human emotion in the moment of crisis. It also portrays how quickly the human mind can be conditioned and even warped to barbaric life styles. The actors/actress play their role as if the persona was an innate part of who they really are.<br /><br />Even if your not a fan of blood and gore the everyday events play out for everyone to love. Season 3 is chalk full of story instead of blunt (walker) gore. You can watch as these people struggle to live while also struggling to retain the humanity and love for people they once had.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|It's free so i give it 3 stars.  It is kind of slow, but once again... it was free, so i can't complain to much about it.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|This third Season of the Downton Abbey series is as high quality as the former two seasons.  Looking forward to Season 4.
B00CP2Z5TC|5.0|While this is different than their last two albums, I thoroughly  enjoyed  it. A much more grown up sounding album.
0446572985|2.0|As an avid reader, I had a really hard time getting into \\"The Innocent.\\"  Usually, with Baldacci's books, I have a hard time putting the books down long enough to come back to the real world; that wasn't the case here, unfortunately.  For a long time, David Baldacci has been one of my favorite authors.  \\"Absolute Power,\\" \\"Last Man Standing,\\" \\"The Winner,\\" and \\"Wish You Well\\" are still a few of my favorite books.  His well-constructed stories and characters have always mesmerized me, and each time I re-read them, I find a new facet to admire.<br /><br />\\"The Innocent,\\" however, was a bit of a disappointment.  The story was somewhat predictable, the characters were pretty flat, and there was just... nothing to really draw me in.  There were no real stunning revelations, which just made the adventure something of a drag.  Even the links between events were something of a stretch to believe with any plausibility.  Overall, I'm just disappointed by one of my favorite authors seeming to just phone it in.<br /><br />Part of the problem came from the choppy sentences; the fluidity I've come to expect from Baldacci was gone.  Instead, Baldacci seemed to have given up. He just wrote very short sentences.  And some were just fragments.  Not real sentences.  It made it very difficult to get into the story.  Because it felt disruptive.  See what I did there?  I might have understood if this had been a stylistic choice, but there are points in the story later where sentences are almost normal, so the inconsistency bothered me.<br /><br />Bottom line: if you're looking for an adventure with a heartwarming ending and many layers of depth (like earlier Baldacci), you'll finish this disappointed.  On the other hand, if you want an adventure with thrills and not much thinking or twisting, then this may be for you.
1400032717|5.0|This was a great book.  I liked the insight it gives into people who live with autism.  I think that this  book should be available for students to read in schools.
B0000A2I1B|1.0|disappointed overall. had a few drinks and went looking around - wow!!  i need this!!  oh well, wrong again.  don't bother.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|works great, charges my wife's S4 and daughters iPhone 5 at the same time and in no time!. they love it!
B005S9EK5Y|2.0|I was wondering how they would make a film musical of Les Miserables. I thought the movie was okay, but it lacks the emotional depth, drama, and suspense of a traditional film. I think the audience had to have a good understanding of the original story in order to really understand the movie. Otherwise, it's just some former convict being chased by a french policeman, along the way he gains a child to take care of, she grows up, he saves her groom, the policeman and convict die, the end.<br /><br />I think musical is an interesting vehicle for a story that has been interpreted many times over the years. However, I prefer the traditional story. I understand the characters weren't supposed to sing very well (in keeping with their characters) but this means there isn't any amazing music in the movie.<br /><br />Anne Hathaway played Fantine superbly, and sang well. I liked Helen Bonham Carter and Sasha Cohen as the innkeepers. The child who plays Cosette is rather ethereal and haunting, but only appeared briefly. Amanda Seyfried and Russell Crowe sing terribly!<br /><br />The musical stripped the story down to a simple storyline...the full breadth of the story was taken away! The Paris Rebellion part was ridiculous. As the film went on, it just got more drawn out, tedious, boring, and the singing started to get wearing to listen to.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|Love the series on TV.  After watching the show and talking to others, I decided to order the comic book.  Both the series and the comics are well done.
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|I really loved the first three Lord of the Ring movies, so I was looking forward to the Hobbit. Once again, this film, though not as good as the other three movies, was entertaining, adventurous, and a wonderful revisit to Middle Earth. The scenery and imagery throughout the movie was just as beautiful and awe-inspiring as the other movies.<br /><br />We revisited familiar characters such as Gandalf, Salomon, and Golem, and returned to familiar places such as the Shire and Moria. I think the plot in this film did not have the same depth as the Lord of the Ring movie, but nevertheless, I enjoyed it.<br /><br />I haven't read \\"The Hobbit\\" yet, so I can't compare the film to the book. But I understand there is no way the film could capture all the rich detail and side plots of the book - and this was already an almost 3 hour movie!<br /><br />I'm excited for the one after this!!
B0061PEAUY|4.0|I have been a fan of Kathy Reich's since her first book. I am not a fast reader except when I read her books. I am always sorry when I get to the last chapter that it is done. I just have to wait till August for the next adventure in forensics.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This is such a fast read. I could not put the book down, the story is very interesting and written with a good style. It gives a great perspective how parents can be blind when it comes to their children. It reminds us also that building life on a lie or illusion can back fire pretty badly later when we don't expect it... Loved the book and we had a great discussion in our book club. Would recommend it especially if you are looking for a book club selection.
B000JMKRKC|5.0|Fresh plot, held my interest all of the way through, loved the extra bit at the end!  Will look for more from this Author!
B00867GHS8|5.0|If you already love Finding Nemo, then you will absolutely adore watching it in 3D! This combo pack has everything to watch it from the DVD to BlueRay to 3D. Definitely worth buying.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|I am in love with this movie. Actually, ALL Nick Sparks books/movies. And North Carolina looks absolutely beautiful.. Must watch..
0770437419|5.0|This isn't a just a zombie SAW-like story, but how a world through different culture lens and infrastructure/climate respond to a viral epidemic.<br /><br />With the world becoming more connected because of technology and ease of transportation, the ease of transportation can facilitate the spread of disease on a global unprecedented level.  But little has been considered how to use our growing technology to solve global disease outbreaks in a macro sense.How to pay attention to what happens in Hong Kong and make changes at SFO right away to respond to it.  It makes sense that currently government officials dub viral/outbreak police training scenarios with 'Zombie' references.<br /><br />I can't read it at night, I did three times and each time I had a Zombie nightmare.<br /><br />City planners, Architects, Engineers, Designers, and other problem solvers will have fun reading this book.  It's a narrative chess game that you kind of start at the solution and you just enjoy the path to it.<br /><br />Top five reads for this year. :D
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game is quite challenging.. it's super fun as well.. it took me about a week to figure it all out. I am looking forward to part 2.
B008OOYALE|4.0|The game is pretty solid, the challenge  an  dragon breeding is fun as well as watching your dragons evolve. However this isnt a game to pass time because there isnt enough to do, everything  takes too long unless you use gold to speed up all the tasks. This game is almost like a slower real time Farmville, except you're growing dragons
B00AB7HESI|5.0|Love this app. So many levels, and so much fun. If you get bored... you can create your own world! This game is lots of fun and I'm sure you'll like it.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Easy to access and manage messages.  Clarity of photos and videos is also vivid.  I also really enjoy the size of the screen on my kindle.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|I was really enjoying this game until I reached the level that opens up Dino World. Almost all of my animals and all of my plants, flowers, statues are all gone. I had just bought 2 T Rex also.... There are no animals or Fun Buildings in my Dino World, but my goals of feeding and collecting have almost been reached... I keep waiting for my stuff to return, but I'm about ready to UNINSTALL!!
B00BZOFUI2|5.0|I'm 59 years old, and I have to admit it's really awesome to see a band I grew up with release something as outstanding as this album. I was very surprised to say the least. I thought it would be good, but I certainly didn't expect such a brilliant recording. It makes me feel really gratified to know that us old rockers can still put out new music that means something. Rock On Deep Purple!
B003TH2LYY|3.0|I like this series as it is smply fun to watch.  I know it is similar to so many other series today, however the chemistry in this show makes a difference.  If you just want to enjoy an hour of entertainment without too much drama or overdone real-world violence, this show might just be for you.
B0046MVVOW|5.0|I like here music so I had to get this dual cd package so I could listen to both of them.
193700788X|5.0|This book goes back to the original well thought out books in the series.  I loved tht you are left with questions at the end.  Nothing is fully wrapped up in a neat package.  Every character has a future to wonder about in the series.  I don't want to know what happens next, I just like the idea you are left to think about the possibilities.
B00AB7HESI|4.0|i have played the game before i loved it i bought it just to came to a notice that i dont own the game but i just bought it WTF.
0345803485|1.0|Erotica doesn't have to be so dreadfully written.  The main character flushes more times than a toilet.  Sometimes the story feels interminable, and the numerous terrible cliches in it make me want to retch.  Get it from the library.  Don't buy it!
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|It's an awesome game. Many clothes and jetpack. Really awesome game. Who would not want to play  jetpack joyride . Me I would
0307948110|1.0|The Fear Index is the worst book I can remember finishing, and I've been a devoted reader since the late 1950's. I finished it only because someone very special gave it to me, had heard it was good, and really wanted me to enjoy it. So I tried. It started out grim and depressing, and just gradually got worse; although I expected it to improve at some point, it stubbornly did not. The story line, never plausible, became increasingly hard to believe. The ending, such as it was, was ridiculous, and in no way edifying. The dialogue was flat. The cast of characters ranged from tolerable at one end of the spectrum (the wife) to totally despicable at the other; not one was sympathetic. The alleged redeeming trait was that it explains hedge funds; but the explanation was trivial and lasted one page: not helpful.<br />Save your money, save your time; get out, as they say, while you still can. I don't write many reviews, but I felt the need to ventilate about this book. There was literally nothing about it that I liked; not one good scene, not one memorable sentence. I gave it one star only because zero-stars was not an option.
B008OOYALE|4.0|Just started playing a week ago. Enjoying playing the game. I like the idea that you can breed the baby's. I feel the. Gold n apples are hard to come by.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Wakes me up every time, on time great app 5 stars for sure.  If you need an alarm clock this is the one, and its FREE!!!
B00AFEXRME|3.0|This story isn't anything special, although Denzel Washington does do an exceptional acting job.  I would just wait for it to show up on HBO instead of spending the money to own \\"Flight\\".  It is worth watching on a rainy day when you have nothing else to do.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|This may be long, but if you are seriously considering this mouse, you should read it.<br /><br />So, I am new to PC gaming. My whole life, I have been a console gamer, and came across a slick powerful gaming PC for a deal, so I tried it out. I got Skyrim and realized, I need a better mouse. I was using a Logitech wireless one, and it was good, but for gaming, not so much.<br /><br />I began to research these gaming mouses and realize that these bay boys are expensive. $90 for a mouse that is faster with some programmable buttons? There had to be something cheaper! I won't lie, those Razer mice are nice and work great. About 4 of my friends have one each, and I tested each one. But I wasn't wanting to dish out $90 bucks - $120 bucks.<br /><br />I began searching Amazon and came across this mouse. The whole internet had incredible reviews for this thing. A few negatives here and there, but 98% were positive. Well, more like SUPER positive.<br /><br />BEST PART: THE MOUSE IS/WAS ONLY $40 BUCKS! So I got it, and it came in the mail promptly. I plugged it in and it installed right away. The box doesn't come with a CD or anything(may bother some, but most companies nowadays don't have CD's in their hardware), but it does have the link to the drivers, and just a few more clicks and the program is installing.<br /><br />The program is incredible. It is nicely organized, and all the settings can be changed within a few clicks. You can change the color, the DPI (I don't know what it stands for, but the higher the number, the faster. Most normal mice are 1500-2000, and this bad boy goes up to 8000. It isn't practical, but you have a LOT of flexibility with sensitivity). The best part though, is the programmable buttons. Like I said, I played Skyrim, and using the keyboard to open the menu or change weapons or whatever can be strange. This mouse has 9 buttons that you can program. That is plenty to customize for this game. I pretty much only use the keyboard now to move my character. Everything else is a click away. Plus, the buttons on the mouse are nicely placed, and you don't feel awkward pressing certain buttons.<br /><br />The program has a nice update screen and you can change scroll speed, double click speed and other small things like that.<br />Another cool thing is that this mouse comes with these little weights that can be installed (more like easily inserted) in the mouse. It can help add a bit of a resistance, or an &#34;Anker&#34; if I must say. I haven't kept them in yet, since the mouse is perfect out of the box, but Anker was kind enough to have them for your personal preference.<br /><br />The scroll wheel is one of the best I have seen. I do web design and am at a computer a lot, and this scroll wheel is amazingly comfortable and is very finger-friendly. The mouse itself is a nice larger size, and is ergonomically shaped, and ust feels incredible, even after hours of work or play. It glides across my mousepad, and my desk, and is just phenomenal.<br /><br />I have zero cons, but here are a couple of things that you may not like.<br />-Mouse can be large to those with small hands. Even then, the buttons and programmable buttons are nicely placed, so one could easily adapt or be perfect right away.<br />-No Install CD. Some people prefer to have the CD, since their PC may not have internet or super slow internet. (Don't fret, because the install software (6.5 mb) is quite small. And it is easy to find on the website.<br /><br />Great mouse. Great company. Amazon is awesome too. This mouse is only $40 bucks. It is easily comparable and even sometimes better than the $80+ mice. If you don't believe me, then just google for reviews. The internet is nothing but positive about this product. Thanks<br /><br />-Luke
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|I have never owned a Rod Stewart recording before, but decided I was way overdue.  He's new songs have great lyrics and lots of meaning.  He sounds as good as ever and a new freshness to his music.  Makes for smooth listening while in the car.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|I loved both the book and the movie.  There are some differences in the story but you should enjoy both for the quality works they are.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|I saw this at the movies and couldn't wait for it to come out on a DVD.  I loved it the second and third time, and Ben Affleck and the entire cast is amazing.  A film that you should own and you will enjoy it many times over.
B000I9VOO4|5.0|Reading the book with my 9th grade English class.  It's interesting to discuss the differences of the book and the movie.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I can find nothing to say except Bravo on this DVD.  I have watched it many times already and love it more each time it is viewed.  The cast, music, story is very special.  I have shared it with many of my friends and they spoke highly about it as well.  This DVD isn't for young children, but your teen would enjoy the love story of old France.  You will not be sorry to add this to your collection.
B0042XA2U4|3.0|I saw the movie before I read the book, and I decided you have to make the choice of which you would rather do. Read the book first or see the movie but not both. I did not enjoy the book as much as the movie.
B000Y5JFNE|5.0|I was so excited to find Willow available on Blu-ray!  It was one of my favorite movies as a kid!  Arrived quickly and in perfect shape!
B009AMANBA|5.0|This country lawyer was familiar -- and likewise as comfortable at pinacles of power as he was home with his children: my father.<br />Same drawn out down-home stories -- smiling to make a relevant point -- perfectly timed to drown out his enemies in surrounding guffaws.<br />Day-Lewis remained so drawn into this president's introspective core, I couldn't recognize him at all (my favorite actor now for years) -- even in his interview within this movie's Special Features.<br />Nonetheless, I watched, riveted thru several partial airings of this gracefully-formed film: its libretto scintillating. Why do these men of yore enjoy such grand vocabularies?<br />My overall take: what a rare and generous gift Danial Day-Lewis proffered here. Time-travel back to two of the most pivital hinges of American history. And now part of our grandchildren's inheritance.
B00AB7HESI|4.0|funny and original puzzle game. A knight needs to save a fair maiden? Nevermind a horse, give him a jetpack!
B00005JKMQ|5.0|Will Smith does an amazing job of re-creating Ali's unique character.  The voice sounds just like Ali.  In my opinion, Ali is a true hero and stood up for his beliefs when it was not popular to do so.  He suffered greatly for it.
B004CLYKLI|1.0|Before taking Chua too seriously, consider that she is a race huckster, a control freak, a virulent stage mother. The only surprise is that one or both of her daughters wasn't a teen suicide.<br /><br />As to why Chua published a memoir in which she  paints herself as an ethnic Mommie Dearest, two answers suggest themselves. First, sensationalism equals sales. Second--well, I leave it to mental health experts to decipher.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|Love the movie, love the deleted scenes, everything.<br />Glad I bought it, I watch it everyday , anytime, anywhere, just love it.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|My sixth grader heard this book as a read aloud and said it was great.  A great book for middle school aged kids!
B007N5YIUS|5.0|Great fun!  I downloaded to my phone and my new Kindle Fire.  Don't have alot of time to play, but do enjoy the game.  It's the only game I do play when I have time.  Fun!
B006M4F67A|5.0|a good choice of mahjong games.  Many are deeply stacked rather than spread out and makes it a bit more challenging
B004SIIBGU|4.0|My ebay only smaller, on my phone!  What more could you ask for?  Alittle different then online, but same old stuff.  I've managed to check on my watch list and not miss my auctions.
B00BQ1DBUS|3.0|I've only  recently received this, maybe it will grow on me.  I would have preferred a mix of slower songs as well.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Actual Rating: 3 1/2 Stars<br />A very fun and addicting game to play. The controls/concept are very simple to manage. Of course it does take a little skill to prevent from losing those elusive prizes and puzzle pieces. The reason for the 3 1/2 out of 5 star rating is that the coins available don't last long (unless you are lucky) and the game likes to promote the purchase of more coins or prizes (IAP) to keep the game going. Yes, there is also advertising that takes some some of the screen space, however this is a Free version and that is to be expected. Overall its a great game to play every once in a while to get your mind off of things.
B00B8WXG9G|4.0|I'm really enjoying Paul and friends on this one; I especially like his duet with Dolly Parton.  Good to hear from Paul again.
B00A757EFW|3.0|Another great remake of the classic Pac-Man game, however its a little lite on the trial. Controls are decent (little tricky at times), graphics are nicely done, and the sound is, well... 80's. However you only get to play around for a couple levels and then it wants you to pay for the full version. Still a good way to waste time for a little while.
B00CFQN12Q|1.0|sorry die hard fans<br />i am one too, But..............it is time to hang it up, the last movie is really really disappointing.....script story line is so weak....all it is really is over the top shooting and vehicle crashes.......<br />Hate it when they go one too many sequels......<br />love you Bruce,  but i feel this last one has finished it for you.....stick with expendables mate..cheers
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|The only reason I gave this game 4 stars was because it needed to be a bit longer. The notes seemed kind of pointless, but other than that the puzzles were cool and the graphics were great quality. Hoping for a longer story next time!
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|fun to play while riding in the car and on the beach.it keeps the kids occupied.nice clean fun for everyone.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|There is a great selection of sounds to choose from. This app has really helped relax me and it's wonderful for troubled sleepers.
B0011EU0NG|5.0|A classic story. One of Dick Van Dyke's classic roles. My kids really enjoyed this and were singing the songs for several days afterward.
B004W1GCQO|4.0|I thought this was quite enjoyable.  The actors are believable and the house is beautiful.  I wish there were more than only three episodes though - what's up with that?
0316174483|5.0|This is a great book for simple drawing projects.  It would be a wonderful book to pull out on a rainy day.  You can use the drawing suggestions in the book or expand on the drawing or improvise your own ideas.  It offers great creative ideas that are fun and easy.
B0081336FO|5.0|Great second season to a incredible show. Now all I need is six more words and I am done done.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Great challenge at the highest difficulty with plenty of things to unlock and change the play style. Definitely worth the very reasonable price.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Great show, one of the best Sherlocks of all time. Watch it you will enjoy it I promise.... two more words
B00AKKTDJY|4.0|Love this series.  All of the games are fun, keeps your mind sharp and your reflexes up to par. Would recommend.
B0071BGOJC|5.0|Winter of the World is appaling on many levels. It smoothly moves us from end of WWI through mid-twienties and raise of fascism as reaction to spreading communism. It shows WWII not from perspective of soldiers, politicians or heores, but from the view of regular people, who had to live and survive in times of terror and fear. Perfectly developing plot moves between countries and time periods, without losing the story.<br />It's not light reading, definetely not cheering reading, but a book worth spending time for. Great masterpiece of wonderful author.<br />Can't wait to read end of the story.
B00CL6HGIK|3.0|Broken City did not capture me on many levels.  Odd, because the cast was stellar.<br /><br />I don't blame the actors, I blame the writer(s) & director.  It bored me and I never thought I would say that about a Mark Wahlberg movie.<br /><br />That's right, I was bored.  I wish I could pinpoint the specifics for you but it was just a train wreck from beginning to end.<br /><br />I wanted to love it and I just couldn't.<br /><br />Sorry Mark.  We were all sold a bill of goods that didn't deliver BUT I'll be back and I'm sure you'll be terrific in the next film and the next after that.<br /><br />They can't all be fantastic and Broken City proves that point in spades!
B009IEXKXI|4.0|I liked it but found it a bit slow in places. It is something different from the ordinary sort of story, a change from what you may read ordinarily.
B000ID37RM|5.0|Many people have read the book by Lee as a reading assignment, and know the story. It is more than half a century from the time this movie was screened. Still a great masterpiece and worthy of watching. It is great for the younger generation to see and learn from it and to get some idea of the greatness of performance of movie starts at the time when there was no special effects and advanced cinematography.
B00CP2Z5TC|5.0|I love the album! I was a little skeptical at first, because Modern Vampires is a break away from the usual mold of VW's poppy sound. But after a few listens I realized that this album might be better than the last one.
B00A32CKKI|4.0|This is an old black and white movie, but a long lasting master piece based on a great novel. The novel and the movie look at the struggle of so many people with poverty and desperation in the after-mass of the great depression. It shows how civility and humanity endures and how our kindness and compassion for each other stands above all the events and problems..
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|My husband has become obbessed with this! It is an instant classic that I am sure we will watch over and over!
0765325950|5.0|As I wipe a few tears from my eyes, I wonder how in the world do I review the final book in a series that took over 4 million words and nearly 12,000 pages to complete the tale (wikipedia). In this saga of good vs. evil, you expect some characters you've grown to love while following this series for years will play their part in the Pattern and die. I tried to not think about that as I read A Memory of Light and just allowed the story to unfold as Jordan intended it to be told, albeit through another writer, Sanderson.<br /><br />This was a (mostly) satisfying conclusion to the series in that it tied up loose threads from the myriad of storylines. I wanted more though, that's where the mostly comes in! I suppose though, that one of the first rules of Being a Master Story Teller (tm) is to leave your audience wanting just a little bit more and in that, Jordan greatly succeeded. He created a world where we really began to care about the characters, to think about them while away from the created world. If you've never read a Wheel of Time book, this is NOT the place to begin. Do not pass Go, Do not collect $200. Start with The Eye of The World, originally published in 1990, and read the series in order, all 4 million+ words. It's a rich tapestry, intricately woven to pull you in. The characters are fantastic, and watching them develop throughout the series is truly a treat. Even if you don't want to actually read the series but are kind of interested, you might consider listening to the audiobooks. The voice actors truly deliver amazing performances (a man and woman read respective parts).<br /><br />It took me quite a while to read this final installment for a few reasons: finishing grad school, wanting to savor the last book and some parts just kind of drag in the middle. I know the author is setting the stage, but I really didn't need to read for the hundredth time about the forces of good being overrun by Trollocs. I get it. The Shadow has nearly inexhaustible forces to block in our heroes so someone can come in and save the day.<br /><br />Rand's fight with the Dark One was very different from what I expected, though I'm not sure how else it could have gone with a spirit entity.<br /><br />Criticisms aside, this really was a fantastic conclusion to the series. It was full of hair-raising moments, chilling moments, awwww moments, gasp-out-loud moments, dread-inducing moments, stomach-dropping moments, eyes-bug out-of your-head moments, LOL moments and teary moments. It's quite a wild ride and you won't regret sticking with the series to its completion.<br /><br />Since I don't want to give spoilers, there's really not much more I can say except for if you like epic fantasy series and choose to make the time to read long ones, you will be the richer for having read this one. There's quite a lot of plot a child will not be able to grasp (we'll leave out the sheer size of the series for that consideration), but older teens and adults who enjoy fantasy will likely relish diving into this series. Highly recommend.<br /><br />Sensuality: It's the end of the world, people, there's nothing in this one that I remember.<br /><br />Rating: 5 starsces to block in our heroes so someone can come in and save the day.<br /><br />Rand's fight with the Dark One was very different from what I expected, though I'm not sure how else it could have gone with a spirit entity.<br /><br />Criticisms aside, this really was a fantastic conclusion to the series.

B008TRUDAS|5.0|wonderful book and the second book was the cherry on top ...some of the plot was predictable but very inventive dialogue..and believable relationship interactions..loved the poetry and the references to the avett brothers music ...now I am addicted to them ...will be recommending your books and their music to my family.
B003VWU2WA|4.0|Button works great in my photo booth to start session. looks good as well.<br />cons: the cord is a little short.
B009NY43NY|2.0|It answered lingering questions but was really convoluted. And it felt like things were done as an afterthought. I had hoped for more.
B007QDNKQA|4.0|Shooter was a good watch, formulaic action movie but still enjoyable. Mark got his revenge in the new Hollywood FX way
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|A fun point and click that proved entertaining and challenging. If you like puzzles, this is a good find. It also reminded me of Myst.
B002R25THI|5.0|I Love this film. It had me drawn in from the beginning.. Audrey is the best there ever was! The suspense was excellent!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Was a little concerned that I'd be looking at yet another screen for long periods of time.  Currently on book #3 and not one concern or regret for making the change from bound books.  Plus, the convenience of instant access to choice reading material is an absolute bonus!
B00102F5WK|5.0|This movie is very good, it keeps you on the rdge of your seat.<br />I felt that it is something that could happen in the US an has happen in other countries.
B0078ZTWP4|4.0|Lantern arrived on time and well packaged, exactly as described, though in person it seems small -- probably because I'm used to a typical propane camp lantern.  It was a struggle to get the battery cover closed, as other reviewers  stated,  This sounds like a simple thing and it should be -- but it is not with this unit.  It would definitely present a challenge in low light at a camp site.  I had plenty of light and a counter top work surface and I probably struggled with it for 10 minutes to get that base cover twisted over the three batteries just right so it went into place and was secure.  Once powered up, all went well.  We used it on a night of camping and it performed well.  The only complaint, also echoed by other reviewers, is the little green blinking LED -- bothersome in the tent until we stuffed it under a sleeping bag cover.  The output could probably stand to be a little brighter when providing campsite lighting -- 300 lumens is adequate, but just barely -- consider getting two.  Illumination inside the tent was more than adequate - even on the low setting.  Overall, good value and performance for the price.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|Great action not a great story line but still liked it for the action. Not a keeper one time watch and go kind of thing
B007SYWFRM|1.0|Mine will no longer open. Been two day's. Liked it when it worked.  Kids like it too.however hard to play when it won't open
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I downloaded the game for my son and he loves it. I just love the movies.<br />finally going to watch over the weekend!<br />Thank you
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|I watch the show on TV but love being able to re watch before the next season.... Jan 5 2014! Keep Downton coming!
B000F4RHB6|5.0|Huey Lewis & The News is one the most recognizable sounds from the 80's and 90's and this cavalcade of hits takes you back to every memory from that era!~  A must have!
B007ZM9I1I|5.0|This version is absolutely the best! The blend of South Park and Monopoly is perfect. I especially like that it wasn't created by an off-brand company, but actually a Monopoly product.
B00A4YZWN2|2.0|As others have said, there is absolutely no resolution. I agree that you can leave some things up to interpretation but this story has no resolution to the plot, so basically doesn't have an ending.<br />You follow these two romantic relationships that Lena has and the author uses just a line to two to say what her choice is so I find it a bit tough to swallow considering how changeable the characters were in the rest of the story, not to mention no resolution to the Coral complication.  Even the uprising is really only starting at the end.<br />It feels like the author spent two and a half books working to the climax and two pages 'resolving' everything which is sloppy writing if you ask me.<br />I found having Hana as a narrator intriguing and interesting but, again, when we leave her she is  nowhere - she has made a choice but there is nothing else.  I wish the author had been brave enough (or whatever) to pick an ending for the characters she spent so long building up... you just end up feeling like she didn't know what to do and instead of writing an ending she gave up.  Endings never please everybody and some characters always lose out when there is a love triangle but to just leave the story hanging is not the solution.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I loved this book so much! I read it on my Kindle while camping and could not put it down!<br />I work at a high volume store that sells everything, including books. Whenever I strike up a conversation about new books I always recommend this one. If you liked &#34;Water for Elephants&#34; I think you will really like this. I know this will be one of the books I pick up and re-read every year.
B008Y212PI|5.0|This game has won my heart over. I have bought a few and finish it then replay it. never gets old :) Great game!!
0765318741|5.0|I bought 2 copies, 1 to read for me and another to donate to the college's library.  I needed this book for an English class. After reading it, I donated the other book when I was done with that test.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I read the book, I saw it on the History Channel and I had to get my own personal copy.  This is a must see movie on one of our most important founding fathers.
B002NZK5TG|5.0|This is a GREAT movie to watch!  I LOVE this movie and ALL of the songs in it!!!  The whole cast does an awesome job!!!
B001OKGX92|5.0|The all time best car chase movie and the one all others try to emulate, including &#34;the French Connection.&#34; However, the movie is much more with great performances turned in by a brooding and quietly strong Steve McQueen, a sensual Jacqueline Bisset in her prime and a sinister Robert Vaughn who set a new movie standard for ambitious and ruthless politicians from this movie forward. A true classic of the cop genre that excellently captured sixties San Fran. You will thoroughly enjoy the action, story and drama of this film.
B000R8YC1S|5.0|This is one AWESOME movie from the 80's!!! David Bowie, not only stars but sings and wrote the songs for this film!!!  This edition makes it better with a few extra things not seen before!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved this book so much. The story line is VERY well thought out and it keeps you on the edge of you seat! The entire series was amazing. The only disappointment was that its over.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|I'm glad that I didn't spend too much on this one, because it's only 40 minutes.  I thought this was a full length movie.  Neil Patrick Harris entertains in this &#34;Horrible&#34; blog.  A great show!!!
B000002JNJ|5.0|This is a killer CD- I highly reccomend it if you LOVE metal, and not one bad song on the entire CD!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|As stated by many previous reviewers the graphics, sound and play are top rate and a challenge for even the most experienced solvers. All that and entertaining too!
B00065MDRW|5.0|Great CD. The CD notes are very detailed about the history of the group. This CD master is one every collector should have.
B0083B3KOQ|2.0|Bought it yesterday. Tried 2 wma files. Uploaded, converted then wrote back a file that was 2-3K. Not what I expected for a very basic wma to mp3 converter. Looks like a waste of 2.99. Save your money and do them on your PC before loading them to the Kindle, then you won't need this app.
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|Cloud Atlas the movie is ok...<br />the book is excellent and I highly recommend reading it.<br />If you read the book I think the movie makes more sense, but the movie is a pale imitation of the book.<br />to be fair I think that the book would be very difficult for anyone to convert into a movie that is less than 8hrs long.<br />The book develops 1/2 a story at a time. Starting with the earliest story and moving forward in time.  Then when you reach the last story you read the other 1/2 of the other stories going back in time.  The movie jumps all over the place, the editing and pacing really suck.<br />If your a fan of the book you'll probably be disappointed.  If you never read the book you'll be lost.
B00915G6YE|4.0|I have watched Dexter since season one, and consider it one of my favorite television shows. However, since production of Blu-ray DVD's, there appears to be a lack of availability for digital copies to back up in the iTunes library. I guess Showtime plans to keep Dexter available online forever, so we can continue to watch old episodes as we wish via their Web portal.<br /><br />I would still like to have a back up version of the series with the back up of all my other favorite films and television shows in my iTunes library. Since Ultraviolet arrived on the scene, I have to be even more selective about the DVD combination packs I purchase for everything.<br /><br />Please consider those of us customers who keep a library collection of our favorites for quick and easy retrieval without having to jump through security hoops by logging into a site to watch the great ones. And Dexter definitely qualifies as a \\"great one\\".
B00CP2Z5TC|5.0|Another great release from V. W. A bit more grownup and thoughtful, I'm really enjoying listening. It will be my summertime favorite for sure.
1577314808|5.0|A guide to enhanced living and peace of mind. Easy to understand, with built in pauses allowing the concepts to sink in. Points are repeated in various ways so that everything becomes clear and meaningful.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|LOVE DOWNTON ABBEY done very well,characters are fabulous,can not wait to see the next installment!!5 stars, love period pieces, also love Prime
B005DJGMQE|4.0|Not a fast paced movie, but still very entertaining.  Love James McAvoy & Robin Wright was very good as well.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|good game
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is amazing and beware it is very addictive. However it kind of is a cheap knock off of temple run but it's still fun.
B004GYY714|5.0|good game
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is by far, the best app game that I have ever played. The graphics and puzzles were astounding and very fun to work through. I can't wait for the next installment of &quot;The Room&quot;!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|good app
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|After following Katnis for the past 2 books in which she is made out to be rather mature for her age, this book lets the entire story down by reducing her to a simpering, whiney little child.<br /><br />The story-line is then also deminished to scattered and incoherent thoughts and events, as though watching unsynchronised re-runs of a 50's soap opera.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|i enjoy
B009RH9FR6|5.0|This case is everything I hoped it would be.  It can be viewed in several rotating positions, it turns off and on by opening and closing the case. The soft  leather feels great and I like the elastic closure band.  Thank you Amazon for a great product.
B00CL68QVQ|2.0|I cannot believe everyone &#34;raved&#34; about this movie.  It was slow, odd, misleading, and just plain &#34;strange&#34; - not to mention mostly disinteresting.  I only gave it two starts (instead of one, or zero) because I will admit the actors gave it their all - Jennifer Lawrence was outstanding, and Bradley Cooper was excellent - but - good grief - it's a pitiful story line, a goofy, ponderous concept, and a terrible, nauseating attempt to weave a lot of tragedy into comedy into romance.  Too much packaging into not enough gift, as my Uncle would say - whew.  It was a struggle to watch, overall - skip it.
B0029EDMEG|4.0|Night Passage is an entertaining bumpy ride the the life of an interesting character.  I look forward to watching  more episode.  Goo acting and location
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|A great 'smart' game. Puzzles within puzzles. The look and operation of the levels is extraordinary. Only of demo length yet it kept me busy for hours.
B007QDNKQA|1.0|Amazon is horrible for video streaming!  There's never any sound!  I had to watch this on Netflix.  Netflix always works.
B00AAQRNQ8|2.0|This review is for the anker 8000 dpi mouse. First I would like to start by saying the weights are a very nice addition for a very cheap mouse. Next thing is, there isn't *really* 9 programmable buttons. There is 6 not including left click right click and middle mouse. The overall buttons are nice, a little loose for me. The software is pretty bad for the mouse. They force you to chose from a select list of pre-made macros. They do have a macro creator, but the system is pretty bad. They don't let you use left click for the macro, making a-click on league impossible to macro.
B000LPQ6DE|4.0|Why keep checking it out of the library? Just get it. Then you can watch the deliciously complicated Rochester and the beautifully strong and vulnerable plain Jane as often as you want!
B009H5IS1W|5.0|Criminal Minds is the most complex, intense, well-written, and well-acted series on TV.  Outstanding actors and plots worthy of thought.  Love it!  I hope it never goes off the air.<br /><br />Another great benefit to Amazon Prime videos:  I have a DVR, but DVR's will only record at the scheduled time.  If there is a change in the schedule or a football game runs over, you get a partial recording: half the previous show, half the show you wanted to watch.  Drives me crazy.  With Season Pass, I can relax and just check in on my account to watch the program at my convenience.  And, NEWSFLASH, I can watch it on other devices as well.
1451695195|4.0|I would have liked more details about his NDE experience and  how he managed to obtain so much information about his family members' behavior while he was in a coma.  I agreed with his conclusions about the role played by the NDE which convinced him of the existence of God and the role  of unconditional love in human relationships.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I have always been a fan of Sherlock Holmes.  The combination of super gifted with super flawed just makes a great hero.  In this series, I feel like I'm watching original Arthur Conan Doyle plots with a modern update.  Also love the introduction of a female Watson; lots of complex issues for a wider audience.  Lucy Lu is great to watch.  My husband, a man of 75 years, was reluctant to watch the American version, but really enjoyed all of the British versions of Sherlock Holmes.  He watched 4 episodes the first night and finished all the available episodes the first week.  Very unusual for him.  He has also told me several times how much he enjoys the show.

The Plots are constantly twisting and  so many unexpected events unwind in each episode, this is definately a series to watch!
B0065GC0BA|5.0|Characters move in a believable way, this plot sheds light on the question how you can really live in an intriguing way.
B00AFROVQC|3.0|I like the story line but I found the repetitive use of descriptive words a pain, but I wanted to see where it went. There was also an overuse of detail in the battle/fight passages, boring..
B003Y74AZ2|3.0|It has a little too much flexibility for me.  It accumulates dust/lint in it easily, but it gets the job done.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Was wondering where the new season would lead and if it would all come to an end after a very short beginning, but I should have had faith. The creators lead me on a journey from the first season giving the fairy tale characters depth of character that truly makes me love, sometimes hate, but totally understand many of the motivations and fearful desperation of the various characters. After seeing beneath the surface of the fairy tales, I was totally hooked! (no pun intended) I am so glad that I am seeing these characters in a way that is new because I never really made the time to think beyond the surface of what was written about them. The new series continues to deliver in a way that delights and exhilarates me.
B009R659L8|5.0|This was good reading right from the start.  I enjoyed it very much.  I am looking forward to Mrs. Clark's next book.  The characters blended perfectly.
B005LAIIGC|3.0|This movie is a great animation movie but the history is not very strong. ut childrent would love it because of the quality of the animation.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I ordered the Face Book App.for my Kindle. However when I went to use it my e-mail address wasn't recognized. So am unable to use it.<br />DMT
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I'm a LOTR fan so this is just the cherry of the cake. Can wait for the other 2 movies. I really love it.
B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|A nice upgrade from the previous game. I like the inclusion of more main heros. The upgraded power ups are nice as well. Brilliant idea to have a multiplayer option.
B0097PW7H8|3.0|Liked the old one fine, but this one is fine. Was supposed to be free replacement but ended up being charged for it. My budget will recover.
0743289692|5.0|This memoir reveals tremendous insight into muslim life in Ethioipia other African and Arab countries.  If you can't tolerate<br />brutality, misogny and backward thinking don't even try to read this book.
0670014893|5.0|An addictive read - with a depth and level of social/moral commentary that makes one marvel how Mr. Cornwell is so well informed about the disintegration of Western culture while living in his namesake Duchy albeit with an 'a'. At the age of 81 he still writes a gripping and topical story with laser sharp insight while his prose remains impeccable. How many books do you stop to turn back to re-read the previous page just for the sheer delight of the wordsmithing? His best book since the Night Manager and one of the best books I've read in a long time.
B0091REZMW|5.0|once you play it a couple of times it is fun to play. here's to everyone who likes these type of games.
B005SAV9SO|3.0|This movie was definately good for a few laughs and overall it was entertaining but i would not consider it a great movie.  I wonder if it could have had the same impact if they toned down the obsenities?  I enjoyed the film but would consider it a great movie.  If you are a fan of Cameron Díaz, she will not dissapoint you.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|The story is compelling. It is interesting and informative, easy to read, holds your interest.  Every American should read it.
B00932AA5G|5.0|Starts as office headhunting and becomes the real thing. The \\"hero\\" goes thru multiple indignities , being lucky and resourceful to survive. A couple of nice twists. Really fun and engaging movie .
B00008OP0H|5.0|Are you kidding me.  This is one of the best movies ever made about the war and how it affected those in it.
B0089XH38M|3.0|I have installed this app on my Galaxy Note II and to date have one issue with the app... I get notified that updates are available (a good thing for an AntiVirus program) and when I go through all of the steps to allow the update I am presented with a message at the end that the installation of my update failed because there is another package with the same name already installed... I am not sure if my signatures have been updated or not at this point... Ideas?
B0070DOHQS|5.0|This remote desktop works really well on my TF101.  I have only used this and the free splashtop but this works a lot better; it is much easier to use.  I would recommend this for anyone looking for a remote desktop app.

B000093BDX|5.0|If you enjoy the sounds of popular music from the1960's, you would find this compilation of some of the Beach Boys most notable<br />hits to be delightful listening over and over again.  There are 30 cuts reprising some of the most outstanding songs of the group<br />with more than enough memorable ones to carry the collection.  The choices selected, such as Good Vibrations, California Girl,<br />I Get Around, and others should satisfy all but the very most complete collector, and certainly the casual fan.  It's nostalgic music for sure that will appeal most to the generation growing up in their time and the music kind of an envoy of music of their era.  The quality of the rereleased material of excellent remastering audio quality and the CD comes with an extensive booklet of notes that<br />should satisfy the most curious collector as to details of the label origin and dates of the original recordings.  While some of the cuts may not be instantly recognizable to the casual listener, some of their most notable compositions are.  Who could not enjoy once again relaxing and listening to a reprise of a performance, in surfer harmony, of California Girl.  It's a good collection!
B0074QGGK6|5.0|I'm an artist and keep artwork and photos I've clipped from magazines or wherever that I love to look at for inspiration and sometimes I copy, but not exactly. In fact I feel so guilty I always make drastic changes and usually everything turns out good, maybe better than the one I was stealing from. But I would still worry that someone would look at it and say, 'Hmmm - that looks a little like....&#34; At that point I'd break out in a cold sweat. I'm glad I read this book because it gives me permission to do what I've been doing all along, and I feel sure others are doing it too, maybe even stealing from me!
B006RJTEIC|2.0|Logans Run may have been considered good in it's day the 70's, but by todays standards it was hokey at best.
0525953728|5.0|Hats off to the author for such an informative account of, not just the UBL raid, but what being an actively deployed Seal for over 10yrs was like. Naturally I powered the book down in one sitting the same as others here have done. Its a good read. Theres a lot of nonsense in some reviews about politics being involved. It wasnt, and theres barely a trace of opinion on the matter in the book. The overview is of someone who was inspired from an early age to make an active difference in the military realm and who years later was selected and served as a Seal. They operate in general under Big Boy rules, meaning there isnt a lot of supervision hanging over them unless its needed. The inter-team dynamics keeps everyone sharp and accountable for themselves, big time.<br />Anyway its a good book, from a great soldier, and a job very well done.<br />Thanks guys!
B00CKJTVHW|5.0|This series is not for the weak stomached ! Love the twists and turns. Haven't missed a single episode. This series is funny, dark and dramatic. Best show out there.
B00004SCX6|5.0|glad i got a new copy.shipping was fast and condition was as described.Played good,clear audio and i am satisfied with my purchase.
B009UZBLSG|5.0|perfect work on my nexus 4,i love it,Connect mobile devices to any big screen,Supports Full HD and 3D at 1080p
B0039208QM|5.0|It is a good quality Blu-Ray disk. It arrived on time. The sound and picture quality are good. It's a must for Batman fans.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It has got to be one of my top favorites, next to Harry Potter and The Mortal Instruments. Collins is a genius!
B00004ZEQX|3.0|This movie has some great moments.  I think I just didn't like that little kid, Bob.  I liked the movie alright aside from him but in my opinion, it just wasn't as good as some other Fulci classics like Zombie, City of the Living Dead and The Beyond.  Fulci's movies are generally slow and build but this one seemed to have less big moments than others.  It felt like his story telling had grown quite a bit here but there was less Fulci gore.
B00CP2Z5TC|5.0|I've been listening to this over and over again for over a week, and every time I love it more. Each song has its own distinct character, yet they fit together like a puzzle.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I was looking for something new and different, and Cubistry is all that and much more.  This is a fun game that I can enjoy for a few minutes waiting in line or at the Dr's Office, or for hours at a time if necessary.  There are so many different shapes/cubes that it does not get boring, plus you play against your previous times, numbers of moves or longest string of matches.  I also like to try the other games (minute challenge and attack mode).  This is a very addictive game, as it seem so fun to try to get faster and better each time.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|These books are the best. I haven't read a book in two years due to having a baby. no time. well after seeing the movie the hunger games and speaking with my mother about the book I knew I had to read it. seeing since my amazing boyfriend had just gotten me a kindle what I perfect timing!!! great books! read
B008UTV6S8|5.0|This guy is a national treasure, he is one of the best songwriters in history, and he always fills his stage with some of the best musicians that you can find...this DVD is just a complete treat, if you are a musician, it is absolutely inspiring to see a group that have so refined their craft on their instruments, and as multi-instrumentalists as well...Paul is still bringing it as a performer and leader, this DVD is superb!
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I feel like I spend way too much time on this, still totally worth it. I want co op like on the computer though
0544002318|5.0|Scott is an inspiration to me. He has something good to offer and the book is also gripping and at times funny.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This app is really fun and cool I play it every day after school all me and my friends play it it's awesome
B00A6CT012|5.0|I'm completely inspired by this family. I've been following the blog for over two years and love the impact it's had on my life. The book is just another source of motivation and inspiration.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|Great game. My mom and I really love seeing the cute animals. We reccommend this game for all girls! Really really cute
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love having the Bible on my Kindle and on my smartphone.  I also love the Bible reading plans that you have access to using this app.  I have used some of the 21 day and 3 day reading plans, and my favorite is reading the whole Bible in a year plans.  This keeps me reading the Bible everyday.  I also love the fact I can download a copy of the Bible versions onto my device so if I am without cell or wireless service, I can still use the app and read the Bible.
B00005O3VC|1.0|how this movie got A high rating on some site, is beyond me, SAVE YOUR MONEY, DON'T BUY IT<br />it was the dumbest movie I've ever seen, there were TWO discs, I ended up stopping the player and ejecting disc one
B00992CF6W|1.0|this so much money but survivalcraft is less and way better than this game so get survivalcraft Ps. survivalcraft has everything .
B00AFEXRME|3.0|I wouldn't want to be on any airlines that has A DRUNK pilot, he flew drunk, and stoned, (cocaine)  that is why he crashed, he ends up going to prison for 5-6 years for involuntary manslaughter as 6 people died in the crash
B006M7JCC2|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading Anita's story!  Articulated well and spiritually uplifting.  Since reading Anita's story I have had a shift in my thoughts with regards to &#34;seizing the day&#34; and finding &#34;happiness&#34; within each hour of my day.  Thoroughly recommend the book due to Anita's end result and her non-denominational views in leading a happy fulfilling life.<br /><br />Harriet Redmond
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Really enjoying this game, keeping focused is the key have not seen Any game like it...try it you will like it also..
B006BGZJJ4|3.0|Hello, I ordered this for my new Kindle not realising that a usb is already included on purchasing a Kindle.  Do I  post it back & pay more postage that what I would receive in a refund?<br /><br />Harriet Redmond
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Enjoying keeping in touch with family/friends with this great app...who would have guessed a non tech person. Like me would like this...
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Really nice to see a product out perform expectations. Feedly is easy to use, seamless to set up (imports all your Google Reader settings), and a nice platform to read. Recommend highly! Well done!
B00BSHVSQ4|4.0|I just finished watching this and it is an awesome, intimate and revealing document on the phenomenon known as The Eagles!! I have been a fan since day one and own every Eagles album on first-issue vinyl, as well as all the CDs. In one part of the biopic they say that people everywhere did something in their lives to an Eagles song, and remember it! That is very true and brings home the fact that there is one glaring omission from this movie . . . \\"BEST OF MY LOVE.\\" I cannot believe that this song was never played, referenced or even mentioned during this over three hour documentary. Wow!! The song that was one of the biggest impacts on my own life, and I am sure that of many, many people. Hard for me to believe, and the one disappointment in this adventure. I would have given it five stars had it not been for this unbelievable omission!<br /><br />I am a professional writer and publisher: [[ASIN:0963549936 S.O.S. ~ Songs Of Sobriety ~ A Personal Journey Of Recovery]]
B004W1GCQO|5.0|I was addicted after the first episode. Fantastic series! Can't wait for season 2! I hope that the series never ends
B00AO7M5OS|5.0|Although some songs did not meet my taste expectation I felt that as a whole it was like listening to them for the first time all over again. If you are a genesis fan dive in you shouldn't be disappointed if you listen with an open mind. Hackett's style was truly missed after &#34;wind and Wuthering&#34; leaving the next phase of the band to discover their more commercial sound which turned me off from the band. The vocals are what sets the pattern for listening to &#34;new music&#34; due to the absence of Peter Gabriel and the freshness of guest performers like John Wetton, who gave new life to some old stuff. I liked it enough to buy the second offering, Genesis Revisited II and enjoyed it even more than the first. If you are a Prog Head and a Genesis fan, buy this music, you won't regret it.
B005HZN082|5.0|Best set of cards ive ever owned<br /><br />Little brother spilled apple juice all over then simly rinsed it of dried it and tge look brand new again<br /><br />Another plus is the case they come in looks good while protecting your cards<br /><br />Worth every penny we use tgen every fri night for poker night<br /><br />5stars hands down
B000HEWEDK|5.0|Excellent Product and Seller. A+++++. Great CD movie. Way ahead of it's time. Can watch over and over. Would highly recomend it for hi fi fans.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|Ever since the previous version of this game by another company started to freeze my computer each time I played, I've been waiting for this! This game runs smoothly and is very entertaining. You get to leave neighbors generous tips and gifts that I actually use (Food).<br /><br />***Please Note: this is an ONLINE game. If you do not have wireless access, you won't be able to play. I won't mark the review down for that because that is what I expected I was getting when I downloaded it in the first place.****<br /><br />I would give this game five stars if: dishes that were the same weren't served on separate counters. This drives me absolutely nuts!!! They should automatically collect on the same counter, or we should have an option of which counter to serve a dish on. As it stands, I have to put empty counters in storage until I need them so that I don't accidentally serve the same dish on two or three different counters!<br /><br />Also, it would earn five stars if some of the items weren't SO EXPENSIVE! In order to have enough in-game coin to decorate, cook, expand, etc. a player has to reach a pretty high level (I'm 13, so at least higher than THAT) to start being able to save substantial amounts. The dishes don't earn enough for how long they take to cook.<br /><br />****PARENTS****: Set up Parental Controls because the Money for Gems Exchange can be done with the press of a button, and you don't want to find out about it $100 later!!!****
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is the best show ever!!!  It's about more than the zombies.  It's about humans coming together to fight for life and survival!
B000FS9FC6|5.0|I have wanted to see this movie since it was in theaters and I just kept procrastinating and procrastinating for I dont even know why, even after I received it I still waited... and I am SO glad I did.  It was WELL WORTH the wait, I cried nearly five times and I love this movie... I bought it used and I was a little bit nervous about that, but it arrived a day early, the price could not be beat and the only difference from brand spanking new was that the cellophane was not on it, from what I could tell it was mint condition... BEST BUY I've made in a while!!!! 5 out of 5 stars A+ whatever gets the point across that I am 100% satisfied, GREAT PRODUCT, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is one of their favorite games. With two kindle fires in the house, they play side by side as if they are competing sins one another. The love it!
B0044DEAUA|5.0|Item arrived in two weeks instead of indicated 30 days and I was overjoyed! It was a birthday present for 5-18, just in time. I bought it for my granddaughter to be safe in her first car. This will allow her to be hands-free and the packaging indicates it will be effective and professional. Price was also competitive and attractive.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|This game is pretty good. Stopping those missiles using the way they do it nice. It's even cool with the new features added recently.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|An amazing read! This book brings feelings out of you that you never knew you had. Heartwarming, touching, sometimes funny, I couldn't stay away fro. This book.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love it I have it for computer and ive been waiting for this and if u buy mc skin stealer u can change your skin again ITS THE BEST
B004MC8CA2|5.0|the lord has really blessed by getting this app because if I don't have my real Bible with me to share with others I can just use this and teach them about the word of God thank you so much. also I recamind this for all people its free just get it you change your life to Christ.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|What a beautiful story, I really enjoyed the take on young people having cancer. Very envious of their positive attitudes.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|It's been too long since I plays a game as captivating or stimulating as this. PLEASE MAKE MORE GAMES LIKE THIS!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Yet Another Weather App - YAWA. Though the weather channel is popular in TV Land, in Android Land there are so many programs. On a regular Android (non Kindle) Google Now is awesome. I have never had a need for third party weather apps. When needed I used AccuWeather. For some reason, the user experience of this app was not up to what I had expected so I uninstalled it. Try at least 3-4 apps and pick one which suits you. For everyone, their own!
B008OOYALE|5.0|The game is fun I like seeing what happens when you breed<br />Seeing what happens is cool<br />Can't wait to expand and keep breeding
B009ZFPQOQ|5.0|I heard Facebook may be buying Waze. It is a cool social app with crowdsourced information. For example, if someone sees a cops on the road, (the passenger) can update the waze map and it will be pashed to all people in the vicinity! This is only an example. It can be used for determining traffic jams quickly.<br /><br />The app has come a long way since its inception. I still have a offline GPS service like Navigon as it is the only savior when you are in backcountry which does not ATT. But Waze is very useful in cities like Los Angeles or San Francisco
B00AS1Q93S|1.0|I have been an avid fan of the Jack Reacher books and I was hopeful that this movie would at least come close to the book.  It did not!  The alterations in the plot were ridiculous and not worthy of the  strong character of Jack Reacher.  Hollywood just had to put in a car chase that lent nothing to the plot and was never in the book. Cruise did his best with a miserable script and the lady lawyer was a dismal and disappointing potrayal of the one in the book. The books are too good for the destuction that Hollywood heaps on this plot!
B00785P2QC|5.0|Better than the sim city line of town-building simulations.  Never ending scenarios and surprises. It is the one and only game I am hooked on.
B0028R3NCU|5.0|This reader reads fast and small size allows me to take any of these on my travels.  I got a good deal on some 32gig micro sd cards, so for a few bucks I can use them as thumb drives.  i have put them on a keychain and they are pretty durable.
0525478817|1.0|I'm sure I'll upset some people who rave about this book and I really wanted to like it after all the wonderful things I heard.  Fact is, I thought it was terrible.<br /><br />A lot of people seem to have had issues with the way \\"Hazel\\" and \\"Augustus\\" spoke, to which I certainly agree- NO teenager speaks like that.  BUT, let's just say that there are some out that that do (I certainly don't want to assume if there are a small handful of teens that speak like this) It wasn't the dialogue of the character's so much that annoyed me, it was the characters themselves.  They were completely underdeveloped and sadly I could care less about what happened to them.  I HATE reading books with underdeveloped characters and that's exactly what this book is.  It's very badly written and I'm shocked that it's gotten such rave reviews.<br /><br />Sorry but it's the truth.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|This show has kept heavy sexual content, scenes and language out. The actors are extremely believable and show true life characteristics. Great show, so far! Makes me think and observe things more clearly as does both Holmes and Watson. Moriarty being a woman...very cool twist.
0374533571|2.0|I have to agree with my fellow 1 & 2 starred reviewers about this book.  I saw the movie- loved it- then downloaded the book to read- didn't love it.<br /><br />I understand Pat has had a breakdown and a lot is going on around him and I wanted to feel sorry for him (as I did watching Bradley Cooper play him on screen) but Pat Peoples written in the pages of novel, I don't really feel sorry for.  He's annoying, and talks like a child.  The fact that he kept saying \\"The bad place\\" and \\"apart-time\\" was just so utterly annoying.  The book isn't written very well.  Also Tiffany's character really isn't too developed in the novel.  The actors portrayed the story 10 times better on screen than that of those in the book.<br /><br />An extreme rarity that the movie was MUCH BETTER than the book.
B00A757EFW|4.0|Fun little version of the classic. Price was rigjht. Good to play waiting for the bus. Easy quick download install. Would recommend it if you like Pacman.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I played this game and its awesome. Good thing it is free. I also reccomend other gameloft games.Get this game.
B00BRBIA6C|5.0|Agnetha's voice just keeps getting better.  Nice selection of brand new material.  I really like that she kept the style and subject matter she is known for.
B009949RKC|3.0|This movie was meant to be scary but ended up being really funny. I don't find it scary at all.
0143118706|5.0|Everyone should read this book. It's delightful...genuinely Liz Gilbert. I can't wait to read her next book when it comes out.
B002R2B6NE|5.0|&#34;Wait Until Dark&#34; has a riveting plot and is excellently cast. The only negative I can remember is one of the murders, done with a car, was too violent for my taste.  Audrey Hepburn was outstanding in this role. I love how she evens the odds with the bad guys. It's an &#34;on the edge of your seat&#34; sort of story.  Well done!
B00275EHJG|5.0|This has made our set of the 3 movies and we all love it.  We're expecting Toy Story 4 at some point.
B0000640VO|5.0|Yet this one is a true treasure. The soundtrack is great (even I don't like french music). The acting is wonderful. You will get into the characters, being the silent observer. The story is just flawless. If you're a sucker for love (not the cheesy crap Hollywood feeds us) and just believe in the power of coincidence and a global plan for everything that occurs on earth. GET IT.
B00005JKCH|4.0|Its great because it's the first one with Tobey Maguire, but with the new Spider-Man movie out I can see this becoming a relic in our home.
B009POCG5Y|5.0|This movie is great. I purchased it as a gift and couldn't be happier. The quality was up to par.
0694003611|5.0|We read this book to our children from being born and they still like it.  A classic for your childrens book collection.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|This well-researched and well-written book examines the challenges women face in the workplace as they strive to rise through the ranks in their organizations.  And instead of being a depressing screed against the \\"man \\" it actually offers some very helpful strategies and insights to help women succeed in the workplace.  Long overdue. Kudos to Ms. Sandberg!
B0091REZMW|5.0|have to say that I love this game. been a long time since I was addicted to a game but I absolutely loge this
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This game is awesome I can't get enough of it I play all the time but I can't fly very well yet but I will play until I am to anyone who reads this get this game it is awesome
B00656C6KK|3.0|Too bad Doris Day has retired from singing.  All her fans miss her greatly. Wish she would come back to sing some more.  This album was nice but is of older recordings she did a long time ago.  Songs are nice but this is just a big tease.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game is addictive but it gets hard  around level 2 and it takes a while to understand whats going on and what u have to do but it's an ok game
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|I like historical films and this is one of my favorites, like the british accent. Like to learn about how things have changed for women the last century. Awesome.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I am not a great fan of John Grisham but I couldn't put this book down. It's a great, light fun red!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I enjoy this Solitaire the best. It has just the right balance of ads and play time. You can choose to skip the ads but I find some of them are actually interesting.
B008HFWF3U|4.0|I liked Pat Metheny's &#34;The Orchesttrion Project&#34; but, it's all so familiar. It did not overwelm me in the way that many of his previous releases have.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|After Kennedy is saved, history was changed.  I didn't like the path Stephen King took with the change...history wasn't just changed but geology and geography too. Not sure Kennedy living would set off earthquakes etc.  Love the very very end of the book just not the section describing the new future when JFK living had.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Iron Man really translates well into this Kindle game. I have not been able to put it down! I would recommend to all my friends.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is the best game ever you can build. anything. you fight zombies skeletons creepers and spiders ( you should get it on your PC or xbox 360)
B000W00Y0Y|4.0|Nice compilation and well restored/re-mastered set. Gets grainy a little bit especially when focus is on dark areas. So basically the blacks & dark tones are not all that 'pleasing' to look at. Excellent sound quality - even on my simple inbuilt flatscreen TV stereo output. Wonder how it would sound like on surround sound. Oh well!
B0089LOG02|5.0|The Orphan Train was a reality in U.S. History from around the time of the Civil War until into the 20th century.  Although this is a novel, the author provides historical information that serves to educate the reader in an entertaining way.  As someone with an ancestor who as a child rode the Orphan Train, I found this story fascinating.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|True Story.  It will make you laugh, but will touch your heart, too.  If you love sports, you will love it.  Even if you do not love sports, you will love it.  Real life...great acting.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|I love this series! can't wait for season 8 to become available and looking forward to season 9 ~ totally awesome!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I had another calculator app, but I really like this one! Large format is super easy to navigate for these \\"old\\" eyes!
B00AFROVQC|5.0|Grabbed attention quickly. A clean read for any age. Very adventurous. A few grammatical errors, but very entertaining. Ready for next one.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|It was stupendous. Changed my life. My favorites: absolutely the most beautiful dancer in the world, as good or better than Barishnikov: Sergei Polunin's 20 seconds of leaps and twirls at the beginning! Stunning. Ramin Karimloo, stunning. Wendy Ferguson, stunning. For the twisty workings of Carlotta's little mind: watch Ferguson's face. The tiny pink dancers, adorable. The orchestra's crashing sounds and the pyrotechnics: stunning. Webber's music, no matter what the hateful critics say, for us romantics and drama queens -- genius. Like another more glorious soul possessing your own soul. Nothing to dislike or even be a moment disappointed in. Can't believe I never saw it before. And this was on NPR: hardly a live production, although I think the camera effects sometimes beat out being part of an enormous crowd.

B000FCK65W|5.0|I read this book fifty years ago, at least!  Like Francie my goal was to read all the books in the library starting with the A's.  The book made me laugh and cry then, and made me laugh and cry today.  It's an ageless story, a great reread, a classic!
B0061PEAUY|5.0|This story with Temperance as the main character is so much better than the TV shows.  She portrays a very knowledge anthropologist and interacts well with the other character.  A touch of romance adds another aspect to readers interested.  I would like to read other books by Kathy Reichs that involve Temperance.
1616550414|4.0|this book was very informative . lots of great info on game timelines , stories, character development etc. my only problem was the layout . felt like they rushed it out , besides the cover there really wasn't many cool images felt like they don't have artist records but used google image search
0345803493|4.0|I was curious to see what happened after finishing the first book.  I wasn't sure what the series was about when I started reading it so I was curious to see how it progressed.

B002V6RB1C|5.0|I enjoy this movie, and watch it every couple years, I guess.  Always reminds me of an old college housemate whose favorite song was Plastic Jesus.
B00BGIBVP8|2.0|This was not at all what i was expecting. The last thing i want to try to make fun of are doctor visits. there were too many references to health issues. I thought this would have been a much funnier movie......it was kind of sad really, the writers made it seem as though after you turn 40 you have little else than declining health. I did not enjoy this one at all and i blame the writers.
B001QWB1HW|4.0|I liked Keen sandles in the past when they were wider.  I wore 9.5 Newport and they fit me great.  The new product is narrower so the people at the Keen Garage in Portland, OR suggested I go to size 10.5.  They were too long as I continually hit my toe going up stairs.  I tried the 10.5 and the length is better but the width is too narrow.  I'm trying to stretch the width but not having much luck.  In the old 9.5 I could wear either barefoot or with socks.  With the new 10.0 I cannot get them on witness socks.

B005S9ELVC|4.0|&#34;The Gangster Squad&#34; based on a TRUE story (the &#34;Hat Squad&#34;--see &#34; Mullholland Falls&#34; which also featured Nick Nolte, then as the leader of the group) taking place in post WWII Los Angeles when the Gangster/Racketeer Mickey Cohen climbed to the top of the heap in the early 50's.  Corruption was not new to City Leaders, Policemen and Union men however to step outside the law to FIGHT it was.....enter Sgt John O'Mara (Josh Brolin)--former decorated war veteran, hardened by his years in the war and a no-nonsense ethic he applies to his detective position with the LAPD; Sgt Jerry Wooters (Ryan Gosling) content with getting along to insure a pension in 20 years, undergoing a slow realization that in order to enforce the law sometimes one must BREAK the law; Giovanni Ribisi (excellently cast) as the techno-geek officer who improvises listening devices to tap into Cohen's secret plans ; Michael Pena as a rookie cop eager to join up and be part of this team; and Robert Patrick the elder lawman who still holsters an old 6 shooter but with deadly accuracy (obviously not a fan of LAPD's snub .38 service weapon)  We now have the ingredients of Superhero Crime Fighters without the necessity of Miranandizing suspects or calling for the paddy wagon to arrest lawbreakers!  Just as violent and physically abusive as Cohen (darkly and visciously portrayed by Sean Penn) our ensemble of Cops fight ruthlessly to eradicate the grasp of Mickey Cohen and his henchmen in the most bold and intrusive means available.  Add to the mix a young, sultry siren (Emma Stone) who, as Cohen's  Moll-doll, secretly falls for the ever romantic rogue and member of O'Mara's Hat Squad, Jerry, and you have the classic Hollywood Love Triangle, acted  with complete believability and vulnerability......Moral ambiguity, blazing tommyguns, knives, barefisted brawling are interspersed with a lively 40's soundtrack, lavish niteclubs, colorful suits, gowns and locales that capture the milieu ofLos Angeles in the late 40's......an absolute visual spectacle from start to finish (and props to Nick Nolte as the legendary Bill Parker who sanctioned the formulation of the Gangster Squad)  I found this endeavor to be sexy, violent and satisfying (appeasing the inner vigilante within ALL OF US)...
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Really fun and challenging!  It makes me think, which helps my to make more connections in my brain--good thing to do.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Rented this movie for my girlfriend's birthday since she really wanted to see it.  She's a big fan of Glee and Smash so it seemed like a natural fit for her.  I'll admit I never would've watched this movie on my own but it was really fun with good music.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|Kind of addictive, but doesn't really make a lot of sense.  Can be challenging, bit not sure what good it is suppose to do me.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I hate to say this but I'm almost glad that it was Sanderson and not Jordan that finished WoT. Jordan kept the characters a bit too safe and immune to death. Sanderson brings the Shadow and the results are gruesome. No boring Aes Sedai political passive aggressive snooze fest here. Just light vs darkness until the bitter end...an end that was worth the wait.

B00CHIMG6Y|3.0|This movie,  based on a true story, has some profound moments; the family told a story of a miracle when they all survived the tsunami.
B003JH8LPW|5.0|Exciting story that really gets intense and difficult to put down.  The ending leaves the reader &#34;hanging&#34; and waiting for answers.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Based on a true story, Argo managed to be both entertaining and educational.  It is a riveting story.  While I understand the Canadian frustration with the portrayal of the drama in mostly American terms, another movie could be made giving the sacrifices and help that the Canadians provided.  There are always more that one story of things that happen.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|This show is a drama yet lots of humour. Exceptionally done show. I look forward to every episode. Very addicting...

B0042U94UQ|5.0|Good movie that doesn't have all that inappropriate adult humor in it but still funny. Kids love it...especially the ending:)
B0061PEAUY|4.0|I am a fan of Kathy Reichs' books and its TV counterpart Bones but I've noticed that lately there seems to be a lot of information relating to sub-plots that seem to detract from the main story line. At times this additional, &#34;nice to know&#34; information just seems to be filler and I personally skipped through it to continue on with the story.
0810989956|5.0|This was a gift for my grandaughter who loves to read.  She loved it, and read it cover to cover a few times... so if she loved it, I did too :-)

B003XE3G9M|5.0|I'm very happy wearing these Crocs, they are true to my size6W and fit perfect.<br />They are lite weight as I am on my feet all day at work. My feet aren't sore at the<br />end of the day.<br />I have ordered these Crocs in the past and these have a better back strap and are<br />very durable.<br />These are my favorite shoe to wear.<br />It was so easy ordering and shipping was fast. I would definitely order these again!
B006MW3V6U|4.0|What great period show.  The ladies and gents are standouts, the servants ladies and gents themselves.  the sets and scenery fascinating.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|This offered me exactly what i was looking for. the ability to rotate to horizontal or vertical and use the stand feature either way is great! Love the idea of the strap to hold it closed when not in use!
B00CATSONE|5.0|Oh the things that I have learned! I had no idea that Tesla did so much and got so little credit. This book was very inspirational and a quick read. I find that many times when I am reading an inspirational book they are too long and I am not able to digest all of the points. This book was good all the way through and left me feeling inspired to change the world. Highly recommend!
B00AKKTDJY|4.0|The pop-up ad for diner dash that you cant turn off is made more irritating by the fact that it isn't even made for my non kindle tablet.......otherwise the game would earn 5 stars.

B0086449YA|5.0|Mark continues to write and play his unique style of music. He and Larry Carlton are perhaps two of the greatest guitar masters alive today.
B005MMYPIE|4.0|I got into this band late. (Actually picking up \\"The Nexus\\" BEFORE this release) This album contains many gems, and their genre bending sound (something that put me off at first) is the focal point of this band. 3 distinct vocalists, pop sensibilities combined with stacatto, rapid fire guitar riffs with a touch of techno, could have been a recipe for disaster, but somehow this band manages to makes all these elements works seemlessly. The two bonus tracks here are great, not \\"throwaway\\" tracks like they sometimes tend to be, and its worth picking up the deluxe edition for these tunes. *Keep in mind when buying the deluxe dvd version: The dvd is NOT NTSC format, so unless you have an all-region dvd player, you may only be able to view this on your computer.
B00CL0J99K|2.0|Iron Man 3 was completely underwhelming.<br /><br />I guess the writers wanted to have more of Tony Stark outside the box, as it were, but it was too much of it. This resulted in much less spectacle than I was expecting.<br /><br />To have him challenge the Mandarin without having any defense systems in place? Completely silly. We create our own demons? Looking back at the last film, the Avengers, this doesn't make any sense. Spoiler alert: destroying his toys at the end? Completely naïve. Is the world now free of other threats?<br /><br />There was one cool idea: the flying Iron Man parts. This gave us one really touch scene when he uses this capability to protect Pepper.<br /><br />But the middle third of the movie just seemed tedious and drawn out. There was a lot of action at the end, but it was all happening so fast that it was hard to appreciate what was going on, what with multiple iron men flying about.<br /><br />A disaster. Rental only!
B00CAJP0ZO|5.0|Great lyrics, great beats, great ballz o' fie! Chilly Willy beez da hotness. For an upgrade in style, class, & swag, purchase this album. For a downgrade to the projects , see  Lil Weezy.
B008JFUO4U|3.0|It's based on a comic. In this case, that's a bug, not a feature. The silliness of the plot shows this.<br /><br />It's interesting to start with. The moon has been destroyed by Scavengers, who forced humanity to nuke the earth to bits. Some humans are left on earth to guard the conversion of seawater into energy to enable migration to Titan. Scavs attack these installations from time to time.<br /><br />Or so we are told.<br /><br />Now, this crucial operation is left to a scattering of humans with extremely limited defense resources - and throughout the movie you ask yourself, why? Doesn't make sense, even when you find out what's really going on.<br /><br />You already guessed the true nature of the Scavs. The mystery of what really happened is also compelling. But the story - even its big twist - unfolds sloooooowwwwwly. There are scenes which should have been edited out for time. In one egregious example, a proposal scene is described ... THEN THEY SHOW IT TO YOU just in case you missed it. Things just take too long to happen. But the worst is yet to come.<br /><br />The ending is, basically, (SPOILER ALERT) ... Independence Day, only infinitely stupider. Yes,that's right. The aliens who destroyed THE MOON are too clueless to stop one man with a nuke ... An advanced, predatory alien species with the capabilities of interstellar travel and moon-rending allows an already suspect quisling of a defeated race into their inner sanctum with nary a TSA patdown ... Why not just trot the writer onto the screen and pie-face him for not having any believable ideas on how to end it all?. (SPOILER ENDS)<br /><br />It's a shame. Morgan Freeman looks a goof in his round shades. The first plan to nuke the alien ship doesn't make sense (why escort the bomb out? Don't you just program and release it?). And with their resources, surely the aliens could have come up with a better defense plan involving, oh, I don't know, lots of armed, automated machines?<br /><br />Great CGI, great landscapes of catastrophic devastation, some nice futuristic home design. But ultimately idiotic.<br /><br />Update: Stupidity abounds. Searching for a downed probe is better done on a motorbike instead of a cool copter? Why? Recovery and repairs are routinely done with woefully inadequate defenses. Why? And on it goes.<br /><br />Speaking of the end, an earth with no moon is basically unfit for life due to many, many parameters, but let's not even go there.<br /><br />I liked their pug-faced, endearing killer drone design, the copter and their nice house, but that doesn't tip the scales enough.t landscapes of catastrophic devastation, some nice futuristic home design.

It is beautiful....it is sad......you want to arrive at the end and then.....when you reached the end, you are exhausted and sad that it is over.....<br />A great book.

B007RCJNDE|5.0|Like the sad passing of Robert Jordan himself ... So comes sadly the end of this wonderful series of books.<br /><br />The cycle is complete but yet so many questions feel unanswered ... In some ways as an ending the events of the climax feel rushed and somewhat jumbled ... But so in truth are all epic battles and this book is certainly that.<br /><br />Thanks to Brandon for this final remembrance ... I believe Robert Jordan would be proud
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|The first thing I do when I pick up a book is to see what kind of writing takes place--even more important than the story is the writing. Also, I do not like, as a rule, first person books; I prefer a narrator completely removed from the characters so I can get an \\"unbiased\\" view of them. And then if it's a good story as well, I feel I have been rewarded. This book is gold to me because not only did it meet my top criteria, it told a story not remotely close to anything I've read before. I never knew what was coming next,  I was always surprised, the story was unique, refreshing, and not one that could have entered my own imagination to write. There's wisdom in this book. I have already recommended it to other avid readers. It will remain on my top 10 best loved books for years to come.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|GREAT, but I half to keep going back to level # 1 instead of moving forward. I play it often too.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|This game is so much fun, it's difficult at first, but one you get into it it's amazing! It's not hard to progress in the game with out buying specials and it seems like a fir game
0345803485|5.0|This is so much better than I was led to expect. As I started to read it with an open mind, I was pleasantly surprised, but as I went on I was deeply astonished -- it was really good. Not soft-core porn -- a story of redemptive love.<br /><br />I was expecting one of the torrid embarrassments usually known as \\"romance novels\\", many of which are little better than porn. This is not like that.<br /><br />This was intriguing, touching, even moving. Yes, there was some cutesiness at first, and one has to suspend one's disbelief -- but I managed to do that with one hand. Once you're well into the book, though, the reasons for certain things become readily apparent, and the story draws you in.<br /><br />At heart, it's about the central drama of human life -- how can we release, heal, banish the pain of the past, and move towards happiness in the present, and future?<br /><br />Do we dare to face the demons of our past, or do we sacrifice present joy on the altar of past pain?
B008QYT7DI|5.0|The part I liked was when he made all those friends and the part I disliked was when he had to leave the flower
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I hadn't heard of this at all, but my daughter and I wanted to watch something.  We chose this kind of at random, watched the trailer and went for it.  It was GREAT!  MUCH better than I ever thought it would be!  We ended up watching it 2 or 3 times during our 48-hour rental and I'm still thinking about getting it on DVD or something.  It has great music and some laugh-out-loud funny parts, too.  Perfect!
B005Y423ZC|5.0|bought it for my wife and she went nuts especially after I told her how little I paid for it.
B00BESM14U|3.0|This was a very well done and emotional movie, but I would NOT recommend it to anyone who might have depression issues as this has a very depressing ending mood.  The acting was excellent and the characters interesting, but I had to watch something happy after we watched this!
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|this game is addictive and has good grafics I am not usually the type of person who would play hide n seek kind of games but this on actually kept my interests
B00BRBIA6C|5.0|Agnetha's voice still sounds beautiful here and the songs are great.  This is definitely adult contemporary so, except for one danceable song , don't expect Abba's sound but just beautifully crafted and sung songs by a singer that has been away far too long. Infinitely better than My Coloring Book and just really great music.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|My wife and I are addicted to this show and have watched all three seasons. Very interesting to get a view of pre WW I, War, and post War affects on the British hierarchy.
0380730405|5.0|Great Gothic romance/mystery.  Our local book club discussed this book and we all gave it 5's.  Loved it - twists and turns great
B007VTUYWW|4.0|This movie had a lot of action in it without bloody violence.  It had its villian that you wanted to see lose and the heroine who believed in doing the right thing for the right reasons.  It was clean without vulgar language and sex.<br /><br />Lots of action kept me wondering what was going to happen next.  Robots popped up with wild high-tech technology.
0898159156|5.0|This is the best book to use as a jumping off point if you want to start growing carnivorous plants or if you just have a general interest. It is easy to read, written for the beginner, yet it has lots of information and great anecdotes for the experienced CP growers to walk away knowing more than they did previously. I have reread it multiple times and use it as a reference book for my garden of killers. I had the delight to have been introduced by Peter himself into the world of CP's at his shop in Sebastapol(California Carnivores). It was a true wonderland and I purchased a couple plants and was hooked from there. He was such a nice guy, engaging, enthusiastic and funny, a great teacher, which shows in his writing. About a decade later, he is still an icon for the CP community and when he has something to say, everybody should listen. I have already pre-ordered his revised edition of \\"Savage Garden\\" from his website (http://www.californiacarnivores.com/), and can't wait to see the information and pictures of all the new species that have been discovered. I find it extremely difficult to explain completely how great this book is, You're just going to have to trust me and all these other reviews and go get it for yourself...

B009IH0ICG|5.0|Charcoal starter. Tried the large one in store & it seemed big, awkward, clumsy & potentially dangerous.  Got the smaller on sight unseen & couldn't be happier.  2 pieces of crumpled newspaper started plenty of charcoal quickly.  Smaller size is easy to control & store.
B0000000KW|5.0|I thought I had heard every Ringo album but this one slipped by me. If you like music from the Traveling Wheelbury's, Jeff Lynne, Tom Petty era then you'll like this. It has a dash of Beatle type harmonies through out the album. Basically what you'd expect from a Ringo Starr album.
B009HUB40Y|5.0|I love games like this just wish kindle fire had candy crush.<br /><br />But this game is really cool to play..
B00BQI4AU6|5.0|I met Tom Keifer on the show Extreme Makeover back in 2003. He was working on THIS album back then. Tom is a master song writer. He knows the same tricks Elton John and all the big guns use....don't let his glam rock phase fool you. His voice is more mellow now. And it seems this album has a lot of genres happening like: rock, country, blues, ballad, and pop music. My only complaint is he's using some weird &#34;pitch-correct&#34; effect on his voice on a few tracks.....and Tom's voice would be awesome enough in it's natural from for me. The album has 14-tracks which vary from good to great. All in all it's an album to be listened to again and again.

B0042RJWTC|3.0|Some parts were good, some extraneous parts could have been edited out and land on the cutting room floor. I really should have been titled &#34;Henry VIII.&#34; It did not fully portray the Tudor line. It ignored the reign of Mary and Elizabeth.

B001AX60KU|5.0|Great CD I remember watching the 1968 Comeback Special on TV it was a wonderful to listen and watch this
B009NY43NY|4.0|I think the reviews weren't so great because we've all gotten used to how the other books were filled with so much drama.  This was meant to be the last book so genuinely it was going to be more quiet, tie up loose ends.  It was good.  It was a quick read.  Not the greatest book in the series but it was good.
B0091WET4G|4.0|After seeing this movie 20 yrs ago, seeing it now allows me to enjoy it at an older age and I enjoyed it.  Not having Barbra S around much any more, I can really appreciate her singing and acting now.  And KK, oh, my.<br /><br />It's about love, and boundaries, determination.  But ultimately love is the answer.

Good pace; good plot; good ending.
B008602KQI|3.0|An interesting movie but i dont know if i will continue to watch the series. This was my first time seeing it
B00BESM14U|4.0|My kid was dying to see this.  We rented it and I was completely taken aback (shocked) with the amount of drinking, alcohol and 'relations'.  I didn't think it was appropriate for a 13 year old - unless you're ready for them to start taking beer from your fridge, thinking drugs are something 'everyone' does and getting intimiate is something you do every time you are influenced by one or the other.  To be honest, the rating does state for 'some drug and sexual references' but I think the 'some' in their world just doesn't line up with my moons.  Honestly, I'd prefer this to be rated around 16.............. but maybe I'm nieve.

1933633867|5.0|Graeber's book is absurdly ambitious, but even its divergences and a few overlong chapters can be forgiven in the wake of its importance. No doubt if it isn't already being taught it will become required reading in the same way Howard Zinn's 'A People's History' has. A crucial investigation into a concept and its ugly history that looms larger and larger in everyday life.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|This movie turned out to be far different than we expected. Don't want to give anything away so I'll just reiterate, great movie
B000A0GP4K|5.0|Anyone wanting a closer look into Dylan's rise to fame and emergence from cherub-faced folksinger to demented Rimbaud-as-rocker is advised to check out Scorcese's film. Rare performance footage and candid moments from Dylan combine with commentary from his friends, rivals, and contemporaries. The man still astonishes but it is sometimes easy to forget how rich his legacy is. Scorcese reminds us.
0887307280|5.0|I read this book 7 years ago and I lost my original copy. Now (2013) I am considering re-opening a business I had to read it one more time to get my bearings. By no means is it a technical book but it quite pragmatic and straight-foward about understanding the reasons for opening a business.
B001ANSS5K|3.0|it is a good read, keeps you engaged but not sure what the message is,... rather odd for young people
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Fantastic show. Positively addicting. We watch it for hours at a time! Every episode leaves you dying to know what happens next.
B00BUADSMQ|1.0|I'm am a DIE HARD die hard fan, but was sorely disappointed with this film. Bruce Willis was barely there as John McClane. He totally phoned in a performance here. They broke the mold with the first one, and made a good attempt at bring back the magic with the Die Hard with a Vengeance, but the rest of the movies are flat out terrible.<br /><br />I just prey Hollywood doesn't make it worse, by trying to reboot the franchise with Will Smiths son as John McClane.
B001HN6918|5.0|It was all that I expected it to be. This was my second lost my first one  DVD I had to have it back.
B0070DOHQS|5.0|this is one of the best apps that I have used to run the computer from my phone or tablet
B000002L61|5.0|I like all the DIO albums... but this is perhaps the most memorable of all ... Truly one of the best ... Among the favorite songs is We Rock, powerful album start ... Last in Line, the title theme is memorable and sticky... another of my favorites is I speed at night, fast and powerful ... another of my favorites is Mystery ... The others are very good ... highly recommended album that any fan of hard rock and heavy metal should be.
0374275637|5.0|Well, what I really mean is it gives you insight and practical ramifications of the various cognitive biases we all have as humans. Understanding these things is what give unscrupulous marketers and the like the power to manipulate our reactions, choices, and behaviors. Really eye opening. Well-written, witty, some personal vignettes. A fantastic and engaging popular press psychology book. Stimulating and thought provoking.
B007NVIB5U|5.0|A quirky dramatic comedy following a group of gay men, their friends and family through triumphs and tribulations. The only complaint is that to the American ear working class English can be difficult to comprehend.
B009UWYFFK|5.0|A sweet storyline, a bit light but filled with heart and laughs in equal measure. Well made, with a number of technical innovations in the CGI means a computer animated film that has a genuine visual style and one that suits the story. Belly laughs and very clever lines keep the whole family smiling.
B0080BFWE0|5.0|One of the best movies that you will want to see again and again. The video was top notch. Everything arrived on time<br />nothing broken. I am a happy customer.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|I give this 5 stars for being a sci-fi book that is both simple and meaningful. I recommend this to readers who enjoy games such as EVE Online.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Wish I had found this along time ago. The product I bought for my Kindle just didn't work well. Saw what my daughter and granddaughter had and ordered it that day. It got here in 3 days and I'm very happy with it.
B0094K1MH2|4.0|Good for kids too.  I won't rate any more movies if I have to use 16 words or more.  That's just idiotic, when I can say what I need to say in 4 words or less.
B004XDYJRU|2.0|Like many others I cannot install the latest app update. It's been broken for months now. Please get this fixed!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|For people who love horses like my self its good allows you to feed them and take care of them .just wish they allowed you to pick your enitial horse. otherwise great game
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I just finished reading this series for the second time and once again, I couldn't stop reading it. The characters have depth and the story (in my opinion) is even better than 50 Shades. I can't wait for the continuation of Gideon and Eva's story.
B00633W614|4.0|Having read the first and second book, i can't wait for the third book to be made available. Looking forward to it.
B005K17RU0|4.0|That it is possible to look at weather forecasts for just about any spot on the globe is amazing. The fact that they are also updated frequently makes them more reliable, especially tot local weather.
1451675046|3.0|After reading 'The Blind Watchmaker' and 'Climbing Mount Improbable' among most of Professor Dawkins' other books, I had expected a bit more of an advanced science tome.  Nevertheless this is the PERFECT book for those without an MS in a natural science field so I plan to share it as it does do an excellent job of explaining many of the basic natural principles behind the way much of the world we experience works.
B0094K1WZE|4.0|I am NOT a Tom Cruise fan (I can't stand him), but this was a pretty good movie. If you like action movies, you will like this one.
B005VPRGB0|5.0|He loved it so much we couldn't get his attention until it was finished!  It came on time and complete.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Great graphics, only wish there were more options in progress other than spending money to advance. Progress should also be a bit more timely.
B00CH87HF4|1.0|The beginning of the game is fun and easy and plays a lot like League of Legends, however that quickly ends and you have to use up all of your diamonds when you progress through the game on potions or better armour and weapons.  Even after spending the money on these things they quickly become useless as the game is heavily balanced in favor of the creatures trying to kill you.
1936719010|5.0|Would you like a simple, direct book writing coach in the form of a book? Do the Work is the book. I read The War of Art and loved it so much that I ordered this book and Turning Pro. All three of them are excellent.<br /><br />In Do the Work, Pressfield walks you through the process of writing a book with the trust that all books are already written, we just need to show up to write. If you question this, check out the book and sit down to write! More than half of the battle is doing the work; this book provides the motivation and support to put talk (or thought) into action. Thank you, Steven!
B00499NHLC|5.0|My husband watched this series when it was on tv, but I wasn't interested. He asked if I'd like to try it one night when we were looking for something to watch and I ended up LOVING it. So creative. The actors are fantastic and the story lines are fun and keep you guessing and intrigued.
B007B5EDEG|4.0|Compulsive reading but poorly edited and some of the writing is sloppy and poorly executed. However will definitely read the final books.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I always enjoy John Grisham's novels & this is no exception.  Excellent plot with interesting turns & surprises along the way.
B007C7UZIG|1.0|Don't get me wrong, I love Steam but this app just isn't what I had hoped for.  I might recommend it to others but maybe not.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|A wonderfully well written, well acted and beautifully shot show that absolutely deserves another season and more praise than it currently has.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I love this game so much it is so fun and just try it and believe me it's the best game ever
B002VX0A40|5.0|I bought this for my son at birth and he still plays with it at nearly 2 years old! Worth the money!
B008XG1X18|4.0|Please update the Kindle app so it's the same as the other apps. I want the tagging feature on my Kindle like I have on my phone.
B002DJZJT8|5.0|this movie is one of my favorite movies i watch it on my cumputer and least once a week. i highly reccomend it. very interesting plot. you cant miss the ending. watch it when you get a chance.
B003Y3IGH4|5.0|It is nice style and nice color, comfortable, anyway, which is right what I expected. I love it very much. while, it is first buy here for this brand, so, the size is a bit small.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game is so much fun to play and very additive! Have to get used to playing on the large screen on my Kindle.
B007REV4T8|5.0|I normally love the Bond franchise and this is one of the reasons that I do. A terrific story line - wonderfully written - terrifically acted and action packed. Phew.<br /><br />You have to see it.
B003PJ6UHA|3.0|Informative book regarding biomecenyrism, but sort of strange how the author included personal stories. Overall pretty good, but not great.
1439127700|5.0|wonderful stories and background information on a previously silent and unreported group of advisors. The section on Harry Truman and the rehabilitation of Hoover is particularly information when FDR - an unjustifiably revered man - discredits him - much as Obama has tried to do to GW Bush. Eisenhower is presented in an equally unemotional manner as the callous hard nosed individual he truly was in his &#34;after me you are first&#34; approach to life. You will love it if you like history.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love this game! It's a great way to pass the time if you're on a long drive with kids and everything.
1609611543|5.0|Well this will open you eyes some. You have to read it to understand some of the reasons for the change of the bodies around the world. Very informative and provocative.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|I like everything about this game except that it won't let you climb to the top of the Oscorp building. Other than that it is the best game  I have ever played.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Totally fun and addictive! Perfect for when the kids (or me) need a distraction. But beware it's much more addictive than it might appear! Ruth
B003YL4L0W|4.0|At times a little slow as each character has a chapter, it had less flow to the story than I prefer however I enjoyed meeting each one from their current place, in very imperfect lives. The best parts were the areas that brought out the messages of acceptance of others even if we disagree with choices the characters made. It was a challenge to not fall into a place of judgement and remain true to the theme of love thy neighbor. It did leave me wanting to know how Lucy's life played out.
160309007X|1.0|I am, or rather I was, a huge fan of Alan Moore's work. Until I read League of Extraordinary Gentlemen Volume III: Century 2009 and realized that Moore has gone off the deep end. The deep respect for his source material obvious in Moore's ingenious melding of classic works of fiction that was the hallmark of the first two volumes is gone. League 2009 is Moore taking a big fat dump on all of modern society and modern fiction. As a member of modern society and a fan of modern fiction, I can't help but feel that the entire book is a middle finger directed at me and everyone else with the audacity to be younger than Moore. He has become a curmudgeon, a doddering old coot perched on his rocking chair, cradling his shotgun and muttering about them damn comic book publishers what kilt his dog and took his leg.<br /><br />Reading League 2009 is an experience very much like watching the movie adaptation of Volume I starring Sean Connery, in that both works are much further removed from Volume I than Volumes I and II are from the works that inspired them. Moore has gone from creating a satire/pastiche of 19th century fiction to creating a shoddy parody of his own work. Thus far, I have intentionally not discussed the content of League 2009 because it's barely woth discussing, but I suppose I should give it a once over. Everything is terrible, Orlando has to out on some 3D glasses so (s)he can get bitched at by Prospero, and then Orlando, Mina and Allan fail to save the world from Harry Potter's eyeball-covered lightning-shooting genitals. No, I am not making this up. If you're wondering if it's really as bad as that hasty summary makes it sound, well, trust me, it is.
B00B69UQEO|1.0|It's really hard to complain about Depeche Mode. The band has been around for over 30 years and released a bunch of great albums for the first 17 years of its existence, and some OK releases in the next few years. However, the quality of material released in the last few years makes me think that it might be time to call it a day.<br /><br />The album, to say it blatantly, makes me cringe. The minimal production might suite one song in the album, but to have all 13 songs like that is simply boring. The lyrics became ridiculous, the melody doesn't exist, Dave's Gahan's voice sounds horrible, and everything is so slow...The only song worth paying attention to is \\"Angel\\", but even this song will score poorly compared to older material, and even the lead single, \\"Heaven\\" is an awful song that (rightfully) received no attention.<br /><br />DM fans should not feel bad, though. The band released many great albums that still sound fresh today. Listen to those, and forget about Delta Machine.
B006M4F67A|5.0|Great game. Easy to see and time flys. Great for bus, train and airplane time while traveling. I would definitely recommend this game, especially while sitting in doctors offices.
B000URDCC6|3.0|Fabulous movie....pretty old copy of the dvd (which I bought 2nd hand)...doesn't play perfectly,  Some skipping and jumping.  That said, it has been hard to find a copy (surprisingly!) so I kept it.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|The graphics are great...it's a fun game for any age. It's a nice change of pace from other games whereas the game play is more relaxing...you build your reef and attract new fish...
B0054LJGWS|4.0|I haven't read a lot of Neil Gaiman, but this was both very odd and really good.  Very cool concept.
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|It really is.  I'm the type of person when it comes to adaptations, I do everything the opposite way around.  Meaning, I watch the movie then read the book, if it warrants a read.  I did this for Life of Pi and I am in the process of doing it now for this movie. On that note, it's nothing like the first 100 pages of the book thus far.  Sorry to the purists out there but it's no where near being the same to the book thus far......<br /><br />I used another service to watch this film and I watched it twice in a 24 hour time period.  The most important thing to communicate to everyone reading this, especially if you are reading this before buying/renting is simple: do not expect to watch a linear film.  It really is all over the place, but at the same time it's not.  The filmmakers created a storytelling experience that has not been done or done effectively in film making.  We are talking about 6 stories told through out time and space in 3 hours that spans about 1000 years. Think about that for a moment.<br /><br />The best thing to do with this type of film is to rent it first, watch it and probably watch it again if it suits your fancy and come to your own conclusion.  The reason why people pan on this movie is because (this will sound a bit harsh) they do not have the aptitude for these kinds of films or more importantly subject material.  Another part of that is personal ignorance/arrogance.<br /><br />The movie in my opinion is quite a bit spiritual in nature.  It takes a Buddhist path because it invokes a lot of reincarnation and karma themes.  There is a timeline somewhere on the internet that gives a pretty good idea the scope of this film and different kinds of characters each actor had to face.  Some good, some bad, some in between, each character's ideology and time period plays a part in the next phase or reincarnation later in the characters timeline.  Each reincarnation, is determined by past does and don'ts that shaped their future.  This is a very basic tenant of Buddhism.  The hardcore religious types will find lots of fault with this movie, so if you are a die hard Christian or Scientologist, just stop reading now and move a long.<br /><br />There are parts in this film that are graphic in nature as one reviewer mentioned that caused them to turn it off. LOL!  The same kind of person that probably ran out of Exorcist.  The movie is rated 'R' so that means adult themes.  There is blood, nudity, murder, death, sex, etc.  So if the kids want to watch, well they will probably stop watching about 20 minutes in once they get thoroughly lost and will leave the room.<br /><br />I liked the way the film was told, the actors and actresses performances must be commended and applauded for the numerous changes their characters faced.  Granted they did not act out each part like a theater production but that's the bonus to film.  You still need to embody each character, in their specific time period, and their specific situation.  Really an arduous process, that said it would be curious as to how an actor like Daniel Day-Lewis would have fared since he has stated he gets into character from the beginning to the end of filming.  Talk about multiple personality disorder. Yikes!<br /><br />The only real problem I personally had with this film is the timeline of some of the ages of the characters didn't seem to be quite accurate. Most notably Hugo Weaving's characters.  I think that can be blamed on the art department (makeup) for that failure.  There were also times in the movie where I would think I was watching another film like the Matrix.  For those of you who watched it, how many of you said \\"Mr. Anderson\\"?  Come on, you know you did. I'll even go as far as saying that some of the Matrix props and CGI were lifted and put in this film.<br /><br />Well, I'm off to finish the book.
B00CL68BK2|4.0|I thought there was great acting, and interesting characters.  And I thought it was a realistic portrayal of someone with a mental illness.
1600108512|5.0|I remember watching the movie whe  I was a child, My daughter loves it now as well, the book is a great print! the artwork is fantastic and she loves reading it! She bought it to school for show and tell and her teacher was impressed as she forgot about this story as well! Its a must have and a classic!
B00358ESI4|5.0|This is a great tribute to families and soldiers and how both fronts at home and on the battlefield have heroes.
B00886XQO0|5.0|hade these for 6 months now and still great 5.1 baby deff get these if u are a american in america
B00BQXWH2O|5.0|Armin is consistent in delivering quality Trance and Progressive EDM tracks. This album will not disappoint, no matter what style of dance you jam to.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This is a fun and addictive game that is full of surprises. It is defiantly an awesome and beast game. I will always have fun!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Lol love it I can't get enough of it and I can't stop playing and can't wait for the update
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is easy enough for my young son to play yet still addictive enough that I want to play as well...
B004EBT5CU|4.0|I have been listening to a lot of Coldplay and I wanted to contrast the music slightly while keeping high-quality music in my collection.  I purchased Adele's albums and they fit the bill.  They are fun to listen to and have a lot of character and depth in the music.  It is very enjoyable.
B0035JGYZS|5.0|I seen this in the theater when it came out and loved it then. After spending a few months of watching Next Generation in sequence and the motion pictures in between, I finished with Star Trek Nemesis. A superb finish to this version of the franchise. Generally when you go back and watch a sci-fi movie from 11 years in the past, you see poor CGI and can tell it wouldn't belong in today's movie offerings. In this case Star Trek Nemesis fits right in, great cinematic work and fits right in with today's good movie releases.<br /><br />In this final movie episode the Enterprise is ordered to Romulas where they learn of plans to attack earth and Picard comes face to face with a cloned version of himself names Shinzon. They later find Shinzon has a weapon capable of wiping out civilization on a planet such as earth. Story line moves nicely with plenty of action sequences and enough dialogue to balance everything out.<br /><br />Definitely one of the best movies in this entire franchise!
B0018QOIXU|5.0|I have been listening to a lot of Coldplay and I wanted to contrast the music slightly while keeping high-quality music in my collection.  I purchased Adele's albums and they fit the bill.  They are fun to listen to and have a lot of character and depth in the music.  It is very enjoyable.
B00008S7KC|5.0|In my opinion the best music DVD ever, I have a big collection of music DVDs and this is the best. If you are a fan of Pink Floyd or the 60s and 70s movement this is a must have. Great interviews and great versions of every song. A young pre-dark side Floyd at their best. Careful with that axe Eugene is amazing on this DVD!
B0053YGYO4|5.0|This is my second time purchasing this album.  I loaned my first copy to a friend and she listens to it every day now.  I had forgotten who I had given it to, so I purchased another copy.  Months have passed and this friend finally came up to me and said that she was listening to it all the time!  Well, I'm glad to have found who I gave it to.  This is a good gift for oneself or for a friend.
630542828X|5.0|I teach high school chemistry, and I use this film to show the importance of community involvement with water quality issues
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|I haven't even played the game, but the kids love it.  The action and sounds of the game keep the kiddos busy.
B009CF3MEK|5.0|very interesting movie to watch just because of the Circa... it resets you with the knowledge of what the first movie was about...  enjoyed rewatching it
0156030306|5.0|I love this book. I read it in 5th grade  and I was talking to a friend at work, so I went to<br />Amazon to find it. To my surprise I could get it. I am enjoying every moment of the book. I am so glad that it was available because I was so impressed with the book form the 5th grade on. Thank you for having it available.
1603420398|5.0|I have had my eyes on this book for the longest time!!! The wide choice of crochet tiles, their shapes an colors are such an inspiration. The patterns are very well written, as well as the diagrams. What a great buy!
B008JGSM6G|3.0|I thought  this would be a snap but  the further I  go in the levels the harder the puzzle. Thanks
B00BHU9BV6|3.0|I love Keira Knightley, so any film of hers i try and watch. Basic affair type of movie but she does a good job (like always) and the ending surprised me a little. Never read the book, but other reviews said the book was better. Im a movie geek though. =]
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Amazing. I could not stop reading. Though I wish there was more to the ending. But I loved it. I truly recommend it.
B009329Y30|3.0|not my favorite movie. good story though, zach efron isnt my favorite actor in the whole world but he did a good job trying to play a grown man
B003SHUMRI|4.0|great dancing, good chemistry between the characters, and hard to find clean language (maybe there's a few words in there) and no sex so tweens can watch. Thoroughly enjoyed fun flick! If you love dancing you'll like this movie.
B00B1E6FF8|3.0|The action in this movie is good. The torture in the movie is interesting (as in, would this stuff actually work, did we actually do these kind of things to these bad guys? Makes you think a bit.). The raid was pretty cool. I am very glad I watched this movie since I had been wanting to for a long time but I wish I had just rented it. I will probably never watch it again.<br /><br />This being said, I am an action movie fan. I like the mindless violent movies like the new Rambo, the Expendables movies, etc. I do also like the epic war movies set in the past or more recent times (Gladiator, Braveheart, Saving Private Ryan, etc.) and those can be slower at times but always kept my interest. If you seem to have tastes like mine, you should rent this one before buying.
B0055QYKQO|4.0|I purchased this bored to use with a fx processor but I had to use another processor to update bios before I could use the one I wanted even tho the ad said it was FX ready :(
B005ETKNJ0|5.0|Yet another book in the series. What's not to like about it ------- dragons, fighting, intrigue, love. My kind of book!
B00BVYKWJI|5.0|Very entertaining with lots of twists, turns, and surprises in addition to getting a history lesson that is entertaining as well.
B005H9B2CE|4.0|Thor was better than I anticipated... Can't wait for the next Thor movie to come out in theaters summer 2013'.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Excellent - highly entertaining! If you want action, suspense, romance and a lot of surprises this is a great pick -thorougly enjoyable.!
B009I2UH2W|1.0|Out of the box the charger did not work, I tried it on two different phones and the only thing that happened was a smell of something burning up inside the unit.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I HAVE GOT ALOT OF RECIPES FROM THIS. I LEARN ALOT ABOUT DIFFERENT EXCERISE AND IT IS VERY INTERESTING BECAUSE OF ALL THE STUFF THAT GETS POSTED.
B003I87O2I|5.0|can't say enough about this cd great tunes really rocks a couple of new sounds that are hard to find but they've been around for 30 yrs still going strong
B004J4XGN6|4.0|this book explains simple but powerful lean concepts applied to startups<br /><br />startups not only in new businesses but also in new developments of established businesses<br /><br />being lean form the beginning can really make the difference
B001UTW7QU|4.0|If we don't take our characters or what they do too seriously, this is great viewing. All the investment that a series such as &#34;The Closer&#34; offers to help us appreciate the challenges law enforcement has do do the right thing-- is wiped out in following Fringe.  But Fringe is the graphic novel version of serious crime fighting.  Meant to &#34;open up our minds&#34; to the possibilities.  And consistent with other aa Abrams products, the bad guys are always the ones responsible to the people. And the plot consistently introduces new twists that make it impossible for this simple mind to piece together a serious storyline.  So I sit back and enjoy what comes.
B005HWAOCA|5.0|Cream defined powerful, complex music performed by people who dedicated their lives to music. This shows up in their songs and this DVD captures that sound and awesome visual clarity. In this concert they are not young boys trying show off by jumping around but seasoned musicians who have already made their mark on society and many different cultures over the years.<br />I was so pleased to see how clear it is and how full the sound is.<br />Well worth the money.
0896600009|4.0|Love the drawings. Plenty of them. Reproduction/colors are grainy. Would appreciate an index of topics (I. E. holiday themes) and the pages in which to find them
B000W1YYEK|5.0|This is the one album everyone should own - simply defined a generation<br />First two songs are worth the price of the entire album
B009RH9HDS|4.0|I really like this case. Its thick and durable you can tell its good quality. THe color is bright, and I love the swivel function. When you turn the case to stand up the other way which I like to do when reading in bed, it has three or four different heights to choose from so you can angle the Kindle the way you want it. Its a little thick but its because of the cushion protecting your Kindle, which will be great for me when we travel!!
