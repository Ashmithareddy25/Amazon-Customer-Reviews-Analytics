0743454537|3.0|Borrowed from my casual girls' group where two of the women stated that they had read it but didn't like the ending. In spite of their warnings, the summary on the back of the book was highly intriguing to me. The story takes us into a family where one daughter is suffering from leukemia and a second one has been conceived to serve as a medical donor to her. Tired of donating countless platelets, bone marrow and blood, the final straw is when Anna is asked to donate a kidney. Taking her situation into her own hands, Anna, at age 13 decides to sue her parents for the rights to her own body. This potentially controversial topic is told from multiple points of view and we hear from all five family members and those involved in the legal battle. Sounds intriguing, doesn't it? <br /> <br />Here's the rub. One expects the book to unravel with great drama all the details and eye opening lessons about life, but it falls sadly short. This is a light novel; more of what I would call a \\"beach read\\". The characters and their problems overlap and entwine but wrap up in an entirely too-neat package. I understand now why others were disappointed in the ending. Where Picoult could have taken us on a hard-hitting and thought-provoking journey, instead she chose a different route, and in my opinion, one far less satisfying.  <br />

B0002WYS6S|5.0|If you haven't seen this phenomenol concert yet, BUY IT NOW! This is an amazing concert that I have watched time and time again. Dream Theater plays plenty of songs off of Train of Thought on here, but there are some classics like \\"Pull Me Under\\" also included. The 5-minute improvisation in the middle of \\"Beyond This Life\\" is an amazing section of the concert that I have rewound countless times. Amazing, amazing, amazing. There are so many good moments in this concert.    The \\"behind the scenes\\" DVD is also a good watch. You gain insight to the band that you wouldn't have gotten from just listening to their music.
B00092ZL80|5.0|Saw this concert twice last summer and when viewing this DVD it was like being there a third time. Would not miss an opportunity to have this DVD for anything in the world. R. & L. McGaver
6304479689|5.0|This is a great video of Elvis. Critics at the time who said he looked overweight in the film was somewhat of an exaggeration on their part. Although he isn't as thin as he was in previous years, he was still in great shape and he certainly fitted into his jumpsuits pretty well in 1972. See how sharp and lean he looked in his blue jumpsuit during his performance of See See Rider! But he is sad at times and looks hurt and adds this pretty well to his music which makes a viewer and listener admire his openness and feel for his pain. One scene that still breaks my heart is when he is in the limo and is talking and tries to be lively and attentive but then drifts off, stares outside the window, and puts his hand near his face as he suddenly looks very sad and enters some deep, penetrating thoughts. What a powerful moment to witness!    Elvis on Tour has a great version of See See Rider (probably Elvis' best version) and it is lively and Elvis' voice is full of power and intensity as he sings this version with great energy, arrogance and fervor. He shows just as much attitude and energy in the next number, the fan favorite Polk Salad Annie. The studio sessions are a must see as Elvis pours out his heart in gospel tunes and in the emotionally scarred song called Separate Ways which should have been a number one hit if he had the right people packaging and promoting his music back then.     He performed some of the concert songs in Elvis on Tour on stage in past years such as Proud Mary, Bridge Over Troubled Water, Big Hunk O' Love and Lawdy Miss Clawdy, but he is singing them with more power, emotion and freshness in Elvis on Tour. They seem to have a different feel to them as each song shows Elvis singing in a very emotional and dramatic way. He certainly was real and not some artificial star who promoted a fake product. This video shows Elvis and his music and how he expressed himself through song.     I love every song Elvis sang in this video because they show a different side of him each time and each performance is vocally and musically impressive. He shows he can sing anything and he challenges himself to hit notes and sing different styles that made him a truly unique legend. He makes you want to sing and have fun as well and to sing with feeling!      The band is soulful, rocking, and funky and the background singers are at their best especially during Sweet, Sweet Spirit. This band has to rank as one of the best rock and rhythm bands of all-time. Being on stage with them must have been very powerful for Elvis to experience as is evident in Elvis on Tour. He loves his band and his singers and this shows in some of the off-stage footage. He does not act superior to them, but shows he is a human being who loves being around people and enjoys having a good time even though he is personally going through hell.     The entire video is packed with incredible power and emotion. Elvis' hair is somewhat long and messy and not styled in some of the concert footage as it was before each show as can be seen in the footage of him as he is preparing to go on stage (the fans were becoming more obsessive and out of control at that time and some tried pulling his hair out so they could have a personal momento of him!) He is not tanned as he liked to be and as he would be in his Aloha special several months later and during the concerts Elvis is mostly flooded with intense spotlights and constant camera flashes (which he loved for drama purposes) so you don't get a true look at how great looking he was. He clearly is not wearing televison make-up. But who cares. He looks absolutely handsome and even substandard video technology used to film Elvis on Tour still shows Elvis as the best looking guy ever!     Although this review had mentioned the fact that Elvis looks sad and hurt, it should be noted that too much is spent analyzing Elvis' personal life when people should focus on his great music instead as some reviewers have pointed out. Somestories of his life have been blown way out of proportion especially by \\"friends\\" who betrayed him so it is a waste of time to focus on Elvis' personal life and problems when it is the music that matters and should be talked about and the music is what really matters in Elvis on Tour.       It would be great if they could come out with a big DVD edition, however. Complete concerts were filmed for Elvis on Tour so there are several hours of unseen footage that can be included on a future DVD edition of Elvis on Tour including the complete Gospel segment and the powerful version of American Trilogy that was included in the terrible This is Elvis movie released after his death. Unfortunately, Elvis Presley Enterprises does not own any of the rights to Elvis on Tour and the people who do refuse to comply to requests to release Elvis on Tour and its unreleased material on DVD. Therefore, it would be beneficial for fans and even non-fans to buy this rare video of Elvis in his prime and show the powers that be that there is a strong market for this great concert documentary that proves that Elvis was and still is the greatest singer and performer ever!
0226264211|5.0|Very satisfied with the delivery and conditions of the book.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|We bought the album based on hearing only one track on the radio(\\"I don't want to be\\").  It was definitely a great buy!  Gavin DeGraw is one of the most talented musicians to come along in the last few years.  His lyrics are real and meaningful - he performs them straight from the heart.  The melodies are fresh and unique, he's got a fantastic original sound.  We are fans for life!!!!
B00003CX8Y|5.0|This is surely a timeless classic animated movie that everyone in your family is to enjoy. the movie does being with a nice entry belle singing a song reflecting how she feels about the fact that she is different from the people in her town. the town sees her as this beauty,  but that's all they see her as. They do not see the fact that she is an intellegent woman with an imaginative mind and has dreams. well she dreams of far away places and her dream partly comes true when father gets lost in the woods and finds a castle where a beast lives. her father gets imprisoned she wants to take his place so the beast lets her trade places with him. She thought her life was over. But it really just opened up a new beginning, ,magical and musical and lovely. An enchanted castle with friendly talking objects that sing and dance and give ya a laugh. from candlelight sticks to clocks and singing cupboards. as belle spent more time at the castle she learnt to like the placee especially the beast who was nothing but a creature with a bad temper but her presence and her kindness in the castle has changed him alot. When the  beast released her to return to her father who was searchign for her in the woods, it was a little sad.. But the best thing is she came back to him..loved him beast or not. <br />
B0006A9FMI|5.0|I give the movie a 5-star rating. It has it weaknesses, the end being one of them. Oshii seems to have given up on humanity and also on storylines. He as a Message though. For some viewers that  may be ok, for others not. But if you will, this is Oshii's \\"Stalker\\" with the setting of \\"Blade Runner\\". Reviews can be found a-plenty right here and on the net, e.g. the animenewsnetwork.com. About the DVD then: The one I got from Amazon (July 2005) is the \\"bungled\\" version. Personally I can live with that. Others still have to enrol into the DreamWorks DVD exchange program, as described Douglas' review. Only people living in the US and Canada may apply! One can read: If \\"v4\\" is printed on the package spine, you already have English Language subtitles.\\" So there.
B00000634J|5.0|With or without The Beatles, John Lennon was always a musical genius. While none of his albums never reached the same level of success that any Beatles albums met with (though \\"Imagine\\",<br /><br />\\"Walls & Bridges\\" and \\"Double Fantasy\\" all went to number one\\"), Lennon's solo music is still excellent.<br /><br />\\"Lennon Legend\\" is a 20 track collection that contains pretty much all the Lennon you can want, incuding \\"Imagine\\", \\"Instant Karma (We All Shine On)\\", \\"Whatever Gets You Through The Night\\", \\"#9 Dream\\" and \\"(Just Like) Starting Over\\", all of which sound better than ever, thanks to a superb remastering job. You also got a few underrated gems, like \\"Mother\\", \\"Jealous Guy\\", \\"Borrowed Time\\" and \\"Working Class Hero\\". And this collection does not ignore the woefully underrated 1975 covers album \\"Rock & Roll\\", represented by his great cover of \\"Stand By Me\\".<br /><br />The booklet isn't much, just some useless track information and some average photos. But forget the packaging and enjoy the pure magic of the music of John Lennon.
B0007M22TI|5.0|This group of women were truly great and I hope they will do more performances together.  Their voices and talents blended very well and provided a beautiful performance and CD that will be cherished forever.
B0009I7NNA|4.0|Well....I trusted all of these reviews...bought it, and was slightly dissapointed. I liked AS because of their unique metal sound. But this album is a bit more on the punk side..... <br /> <br />Dont get me wrong...OUTSTANDING musicians these people are!! Never heard anything like 'em...and will ALWYAS be a fan! \\"Waking the Fallen\\" Kicks SO MUCH ASS though!!!
B0006399FS|1.0|Horrible album. U2 used to dominate the music industry during the 80s tthrough the early 90s. Today, U2 has outsourced their great music and talent to Coldplay. Coldplay is now the next new U2. A lot of the old U2 fans left U2 and head for Coldplay. We are now living the era of Coldplay. Rise up for Chris Martin, fall down for Bono.
B000067CPX|5.0|That's about all I can say: I was never impressed with what I heard on the radio early on in this band's mainstream career. I never had any interest in  Blood Sugar Sex Magik when thsi band first broke through into the hard rock/Metal spotlight. I heard that they had essentially killed themselves after One Hot Minute and didn't particularly care. I heard that they had been almost reborn when they went through rehab, cleaned up, and put out the triumphant Califorication and regarded it with minro interest, and soon forgot about it. <br /> <br />But then, two years ago, someone played me  By the Way.  <br /> <br />I am now a Red Hot Chili Peppers fan for life. I'm sold. All I can tell you is that this is one of the most fantastic CDs I own.
0385512104|5.0|I read this book a few months ago and although it could be seen (superficially), as a 'light read', I think that the characterisation seems to have been done with such painstaking accuracy that it begs the question as to how the author obtained such insight. Other reviews have mentioned Mark Haddon's involvement with young people who have what is termed 'special needs', so perhaps that answers the question. <br /> <br />The Curious Incident was not primarily a 'mystery story', and having read it, I can not see that it was intended to be. There was sufficient mystery (and no, I did not 'get' the denoument in advance, nor make the connections that everyone else claims they made), to carry the book along. The story seems, first and foremost, to have been a vehicle for advancing the viewpoint of a supposedly 'disordered' mind, though a mind that was in fact rather more logical and far freer of the 'grown up' mind games and and other pointless by-play that we take for granted in the 'adult' world. <br /> <br />As a case-study of a 'disordered' or 'impaired' mind, it seems that the story casts illumination on the character flaws and weaknesses of the normal-minded individuals who were I suppose, rendered somewhat flat and un-life-like, which again, is not suprising, given the perspective through which they were rendered. <br /> <br />The central protagonist had a certain candour and innocence that soon gets crushed out of the individual, unless they get crushed first. <br /> <br />I do not think the 'social aporia' is unique to those with Autism, nor do I think is the sense of 'detatchment'; I have a certain amount of it myself. <br /> <br />Perhaps one thing this book has done is to point up not just the differences of perspective, but also the fact that there are surprising points of commonality between the normal and the autistic.
0060512806|5.0|At first it was tough to know what time period I was in when reading this book, but once I got a handle on who was who during the different time periods it was like watching a very exciting, vivid movie. I heartily recommend this one for the adventure quantity and quality.
0553296981|5.0|I have no doubts in saying that the book is by far the most moving and saddest true story I have ever read. The life of a young girl through her diary, her deepest secrets , the way she potrays what they are going through in her innocence is just a reminder of how terrible their (The Jews) suffering was and we cannot even begin to imagine to what low levels humans can go to cause another human pain.<br /><br />the paper quality of the book is not satisfactory, i expected better because you want such book to last you forever not look worn away within a month.
B000002BPS|5.0|This album was my first Offspring album... i thought it was pretty recent and then i found out it was made in 1997!!! Amzazing becuz it sounds so modern!!!! I love all the songs (literally) it was worth my money!<br />Key features:<BR>* Lyrics<BR>* Hilarious Disclamour<BR>* Useful Intermition (calms u down then prepares u for more BAM BAM BAM)
B00005NOOH|5.0|This is one of the best documentaries ever done on WWII; it might be the one (the first one to watch really).  All the five star ratings you read are correct and there is not much more I can add to support the absolute quality work that Thames TV did with this.  I watched almost the entire series during the 70s but missed certain ones because it was on late Sunday afternoon and growing up in Southern California at 12-14 years old I tended to be outside riding bikes our playing baseball.  I am glad I got the series and have been able to see the whole thing in its entirety.  Even after several viewings it is REALLY hard to wrap ones mind around 55 million people killed (total) during the events of the war.  We still have not learned all the lessons. <br /> <br />OK, let me say something that I have not heard and you might find useful.  I recommend the re-issued DVD \\"Why We Fight\\" set that Frank Capra produced for the Army Signal Corps around 1943-44 and then compare notes to the \\"World At War\\" series.  VERY interesting and you see why Capra was so highly regarded as a filmmaker, he had it NAILED down and my parents VERY much remember those films as teens during the war (they felt motivated to defend the US when seeing these).   Ah, now take \\"Triumph of the Will\\" and see how Leni Reifenstall used her skills to motivate the German people, amazingly skillful and eerie.  Folks, there is some education going on there and if you have kids get them to watch the three together and talk to them about people, war, and why we all need to get along in the world (and get the **** out of IRAQ).  <br /> <br />Last thing, I have to take GREAT issue with the one review talking about the `World At War Series' being \\"anglofied.\\"   What the ****!?    <br />A. British documentary and there is lots of the US there, not to worry (the BBC Rocks DUDE!). <br />B. The US lost around 300,000 men compared to, for instance, 20 million Russians, maybe the Russians should be upset about the series(?), they were more responsible for winning that war more than anyone.  Yes, communists, but if it were not for them we might be speaking German right now.   As the Nazis said about the Red Army \\"they fight like DEVILS!\\" We would have too if the Nazis had landed in New Jersey and started slaughtering civilians like they did in the Russian coutryside.   Chicago or Toronto would have been the next Stalingrad with the way the weather gets...think about it from the other side folks.   <br />C. The US entered the war on Dec. 7th 1941 well after Japan invaded Manchuria in the early 1930s and Hitler had invaded Poland in September of 1939.   The war had been going on for a while and Britain was about to get wiped off the map.   The US did not even fight on our own land (just the Pearl Harbor attack)!    <br />D. Not to diminish what US did during the war (in fighting) but the greatest contribution we made (clearly) was the unbelievable level of manufacturing and technology we supplied to the free world.  We should be very proud but please let the British (and many Europeans) have their due on this one.  They deserve it...watch, learn, and enjoy the series with this all in mind     <br />
B0000844I8|1.0|you need the sub-titles in anything except Spanish   <br /> <br />I would have NEVER thought that something I buy in the USA would ONLY have Spanish sub-titles. You know, this is America-the language is English.I only speak and read English. It's kind of stupid-the damn audio isn't in Spanish, why wouldn't they have the sub-titles in English for people who have a hearing problem? Discrimination I tell ya. <br /> <br />I've been trying to find a way to contact someone at [...] which is the address on the dvd, but it keeps throwing me to Lion's Gate and there is no way to email them that I can see. <br /> <br />I just never thought I would have to stand in Louisiana, USA and pick up a dvd and make SURE it had sub-titles in English    <br /> <br />DUH <br />
B0007INZXO|5.0|I liked the previous two coldplay albums; and as emotionally charged as they were - i found them a little too sad at times. X & Y is a whole new direction for the band. It's new age; modern and most certainly the best album i've bought this year. I found every second song to be upbeat, faster and more energy charged; with every song in between like a come down or break. I really have nothing more to say than this is truly an amazing album; i have no favourite song as i love virtually all of them. Tracks 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 i found to be particularly fantastic. This album suits all occasions and can be listened to in car, home or ipod. Buy this album today if you liked their old stuff but wanted something abit more modern and upbeat.  <br /> <br />Cheers
0694526088|5.0|Jim Collins effort is truly thought provoking.  In step-by-step fashion he walks you through the key steps the good companies took to become great.<br /><br />His findings are based on mountains of data and thousands of interviews, yet he breaks it down into bitesize pieces and explains each important element in the G2G process.  Then at the end of the CD program he explains the entire process in three simple categories.<br /><br />I found his revelation of the Hedgehog Concept the most useful:  What can you be the best at?  What drives your economic engine?  And what are you passionate about?  This simple concept helped me straighten the path of my business out and let me know what I need to get rid of.<br /><br />If your business has plateaued and you are wondering what you can do to take it to the next level, this program is for you.
B00082ZS5W|5.0|I have always enjoyed Dido's music and have both her albums. So when the opportunity came to see her live in concert recently I jumped at the chance.  Her first song was Stoned, same as this DVD so I guess I must have seen her late in the same tour, and I can honestly say I have never heard a better bass in all my life.  It simply hammered you where you stood.  So I was very interested to see if the impressive percussions would translate into the DVD.  I can honestly say my 5.1 sound system is the limiting factor in the reproduction, but comes as close as I'm likely to get reproducing the same bass beat, Awesome.  If you want to appreciate this DVD make sure you have a loud high quality system. <br /> <br />I enjoyed most of the songs just as mush as at the concert, although in my concert the bongo playing came during the song Sand in My Shoes, and this extended version was a delight. <br /> <br />The only downside on the music front would be the Audio CD which does not contain the extended versions of the songs during the concert. I'm a big fan of extended versions.  On the flip side,  how good was it to get a CD thrown in for free!  I paid more for my CD Life for Rent when it came out than I did for this DVD. <br /> <br />You'll have to make up your own mind if you like Dido in concert between songs,  she doesn't talk much, doesn't interact with the audience and doesn't appear to have much to say.  But I loved it live and I'm a bigger fan for seeing this DVD. The shy British reserved manner works for me and I'll be queuing to see her again live if ever the opportunity arises.
0140177396|4.0|A great read from start to finish. I loked the characters and there emotion from the start to the shocking ending. This book has everything in it romance,suspense,drama,humor. The book is written great and it deals greatly with the depression. It shows how real friends act and how they deal with the emotion they went through.
B0009KA7BS|1.0|Really dumb Keanu Reeves film that has him fighting the underworld and dying of lung cancer at the same time. Keanu Reeves is Keanu Reeves, don't expect much emotion from him or for that matter much acting ability either. Rachel Weisz on the other hand does deliver the goods with her very good performance but she's literally alone in the good acting department while she is surrounded by actors who are more in tuned with Keanu's style of acting. This movie rip off a movie called \\"The Prophecy\\" and it does it so blatantly that it even steals its climax.  <br /> <br />I suggest you rent that movie instead.  <br />
B00005JNBQ|5.0|Napoleon Dynamite is a unique, quirky, and funny study of characters in a small rural town in Idaho. There's the main character Napolean who exists in the strange world of a geeky misfit, his aimless older brother who spends all day in internet chat rooms, and his Uncle Rico who who basically lives in a van down by the river and wishes he could go back and replay his high school football games. And of course there's Napolean's best friend Pedro whose expectations are unrealistic sometimes.<br /><br />This movie does not conform to any Hollywood template, and some people will see the humor in it while other won't, in the same way some think Woody Allen is hilarious and others can't stand him. The plot, which is really just a week (or so) in the life of Napolean Dynamite, isn't the point as much as the characters and their relationships and conflicts with each other.<br /><br />If you get a kick out of movies like \\"The Big Lebowski,\\" \\"Raising Arizona,\\" \\"Best in Show,\\" or \\"Waiting for Guffman,\\" this movie is probably a good choice for you.
B0007P3582|1.0|50 cent is the most garbage rapper ever period, he has no poetic jesture, no lyrical content. after destroying ja rules career he comes out wif songs like lil bit and candy shop is real sad. i dont noe why 50 cent even went at nas. hes not even on his, level nas will kill him just like he killed jayz. if you really listen to rap and ur not no fake p*ssy u would not buy this garabge album.  not one song in this album is classic it has a couple of catchy songs.    2pac is the best rapper to pick up the mic, a legend in his own rhymes. buy his album and dont even consider this trash album trust me.
B00008IAMD|5.0|I'm writing this on first hearing, with tears in eyes. This is the second most moving piece of work I've ever heard by a man facing death, just behind Mozart's Requiem. This is the best work he ever did, shaky voice and all. Some of the song choices may seem peculiar at first, but in context they encapsulate his life and his reconciliation with death.  <br /> <br />Any of about 8 tracks could stand alone as a compelling reason to get this CD. Just go out and buy it, and listen.
B00004W510|5.0|I wasn't born in this country. Although I've lived here most of my life, there are still times when I feel like an outsider, as when someone tries to tell me that American football is a better game than soccer. Whenever I get hit with such an absurdity, there's always one route through which I can reconnect with this country, and start to understand it. <br /> <br />The Band's self-titled second album encapsules everything you need to know about America. No one has ever described the American psyche more perfectly. No roots or Americana act of the past decade comes close to approaching its cohesiveness or down home feel. It's undoubtedly the best non-British rock album ever made; it may be the best one by anyone other than the Beatles. Few records have ever worked on so many levels - musically, lyrically, and most importantly, the ambience. <br /> <br />Quick history lesson: By the time the Band released their first album in 1968, they had spent many years as a backup act, most notably for Ronnie Hawkins and Bob Dylan. All that time on the road gave them an almost telepathic ability to interact, and though they were a rock band, they integrated American music in all of its forms, from Dixieland to folk. With three lead vocalists, and the ability to play a multitude of instruments, they had an arsenal of weapons from which to choose. They were four-fifths Canadian, a fact which makes their ability to nail American culture so perfectly even more amazing.  <br /> <br />Although not a concept album, the songs that guitarist Robbie Robertson wrote for 1969's \\"The Band\\" seem to take place mostly in the American South and West, sometime between the Civil War and the Great Depression - the time of Pax Americana, when the nation was struggling to find its identity. The characters in the songs - retired sailors sitting on their front porch, defeated Confederate soldiers, farm workers, petty thieves - all seem to be part of events over which they have no control. If this is history, it's history told by those who lived through it, not by those who made the decisions. <br /> <br />The best-known song here, \\"The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down,\\" illustrates the point. The song is told in the voice of a Confederate soldier involved in a little-known, but historically accurate, action. A series of riveting images, it conveys as much in three-and-a-half minutes as Ken Burns' entire PBS mini-series. Significantly, it's sung by Levon Helm, the Band's only American member, and a Southerner to boot. <br /> <br />If \\"Dixie\\" is the heart of \\"The Band\\", the last two songs take the album to another level. \\"The Unfaithful Servant\\" may be the saddest song I've ever heard. Intentionally ambiguous, (the time, place, and exact offense are never specified), it's the story of a once-trusted servant dismissed from his job. Rick Danko enunciates each lyric as if his life depends on it, wringing emotion from every line. Garth Hudson's saxophone solo is appropriately mournful, and Robertson picks his strings like a buzzard attacking a carcass. <br /> <br />\\"King Harvest (Has Surely Come)\\" closes the record, Richard Manuel's vocal relating tales of desperate farmers trapped in the Great Depression. It's full of stunning images (\\"I'm glad to pay those union dues - just don't judge me by my shoes\\"), and when Hudson's organ illustrates the line \\"Listen to the rice when the wind blows 'cross the water,\\" you honestly hear it. The song ends with one of Robertson's most expressive electric guitar solos, a masterpiece of restraint that suddenly explodes. <br /> <br />\\"The Band\\" may have more packed into it than most history theses, but it's hardly bland. There's a playful sexuality running through many of the songs that somehow comes across as naive, not lewd. Consciously or not, the back cover photo makes the Band look like they're from 1929, not 1969. The record is that timeless. <br />
B00097A5HW|5.0|Like all her albums, FO vol. 1 is a keeper!!! Although you must hear it a couple of times before getting into it. It is awesome from the first guitar riffs to the last reggeaton beats!!
B000002G7E|5.0|All the reviews here, stating that this is an abombination, a assault on one's ears, blah blah blah. I guess you could say so, but only in the same way extremely delicious spicy food is an assault on the tastebuds. <br /> <br />I guess I am one of the very few who has listened to this cd in its entiretly, many times over (I just bought it earlier this week).  Maybe it can be fairly described as an assault on the ears, but it's also a good release. <br /> <br />Truth be told, sometimes I skip the second song because once you hear the story once or twice the suspicion is taken out. The other songs, I like. A lot. I like the entire album actually. It's drunken madness, but in the best possible way. <br /> <br />I'm having trouble really describing this album. At first the sounds are grating, but you get used to it, and start to like it. I liked this album the first time I heard it even.  <br /> <br />I guess the only thing I can really describe it as is the musical equivalent of a shot of vodka in the morning, but that doesnt quite say all there is to say.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Wow. According to reports, Green Day was working on an album called \\"Cigarettes and Valentines\\". And the label was ready to drop them because it sucked, and sounded exactly like all thier other albums. There is no doubt in my mind that had that album been released, It would have been Green Day's last. A few decent singles, and lots of filler. However, by the Grace of God, We have this album instead. With Warning, a good album, but nowhere near \\"Dookie\\" or \\"Nimrod\\", Everyone could sense it. Green Day was just about done... But by the grace of god, we have this album instead. Undeniably the first Essential album of the new millenium, This is a masterpiece in Every sense of the word. Tre and Mike outdo themselves, as usual, and Billy Joe is still struggling with those power chords. Keep at it billy, You'll get them one day! It's too bad, really, that this album had to sell out so much. Now we have 8 year olds going \\"donwannabeanamericanidiotI'M A PUNK!!\\" *thats the weakest song on the album, by the way. But at least we have it. While Green Day might seem like the least likely choice to create a \\"rock opera\\", they pull it off amazingly. The Story of Jesus/Jimmy, Whatshername, and the world they live in is a Fast, Brilliant, Unstoppable, and Undeniably ALIVE album. Green Day has grown up, instead of growing out and growing bored.  <br />1. American Idiot 5/10. Kinda sucks, honestly. <br />2. Jesus of Suburbia... 10/10. Flat out amazing. The \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" for Our generation. <br />3. Holiday 8/10. Good, **** Bush. Overplayed, but still good. Some poor writing in the bridge though. <br />4. Boulevard of Broken Dreams 4/10. Good, WAY WAY WAY overplayed. Tied with \\"american idiot\\" for the weakest song. <br />5. We are the waiting. 8/10. Nice little filler, Crucial to the story. predicts the coming of... ST JIMMY! <br />6. St. Jimmy 9/10. Good old school Green Day song. Fast, relentless, Fits the personality of jimmy very well. <br />7. Give me novicaine. 10/10. Personal favorite of mine, Very, Very well done. Leads nicely right into... <br />8. She's a rebel. 9/10. I like it. <br />9. Extraordinary girl. 7/10. I dig the drums at the beginning, but I always skip it. I dont know why, Cause Its a pretty good song. <br />10. Letterbomb. 10/10. Complex, Story driven song. A letter from Whatshername to Jimmy/Jesus. Kinda reminds me of \\"86\\" off \\"insomniac.\\" <br />11. Wake me up when september ends. 9/10. Good song, Overplayed, but good. Much better than the disasterous \\"boulevard of broken dreams.\\" <br />12. Homecoming. 10/10. Jesus of suburbia's counterpart. Story driven, Nice touch with the church bells, Drags on a little at the end. <br />13. Whatshername. 10/10. Awesome, touching song.  <br /> <br />WELL DONE GREEN DAY!!! <br /> <br />This album is more addicting than crack. Every listen, you just want to go back and hear it again. Two last things. I like the fact that on \\"Jesus of suburbia\\", They use the little bells, and he's all immature. Than, later on \\"homecoming\\" When he's grown up (a little bit) They use the church bells. Rad. And then theres the use of \\"HEY\\" all over this album. Its pretty swell, but... yeah. **** all the \\"dont bash bush\\" \\"sellout\\" \\"repetative\\" \\"mtv crowd (true, i admit it, but come on...\\" people. This is a great album. Can't wait to see them on Sept. 19! Except Jimmy eat world opens. Bahhh, Jimmy eat world sucks. Bad. All Emo sucks bad. Except MCR. And weezer. down with emo!  <br /> <br />Well, Thats about it. Tied with Dookie for the greatest green day album.  <br /> <br />Stay out of the daylight! <br /> <br />Isaac. <br /> <br /> <br />Ps... I KNOW ITS MAINSTREAM, THAT DOESNT MEAN IT CANT BE GOOD! IT USUALLY DOES, BUT NOT IN THIS CASE. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /><br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />**** MTV, AND RADIO. EXCEPT 89.3 JAZZ RADIO IN DENVER. AND THE CURRENT IN MINNESOTA. THEY'RE RAD.
B000929AJQ|4.0|Although the presence of NIN has lurked since the early nineties, most songs from the first albums sounded too industrial for me, many of the songs redundant and repetitive. Songs like \\"Terrible Lie\\", \\"Head Like a Hole\\" are some examples of this. When Downward Spiral came out, I thought the name was ironic since the title seemed to be autobiographical of the band's status at the time. Other then a few of the singles off the album, most of the other songs never really had the same intensity and didn't stand out. Years after that record was released, Reznor now puts out With Teeth which redeems and makes me yearn to listen to the older material with a new mindset. In what I would call the \\"White Pony\\" of Reznor's releases, this album has enough electronic and ambient songs as it does pummeling full band tunes. Although the majority of the lyrics seem childish or forced at times, the redundancy here is lost amid weaving lush beats and an intricate amount of textures. The opener \\"All the Love in the World\\" starts off as classic NIN sound, and kicks into an piano jam that would make the Elton John in every one of us happy. Then the album kicks into \\"you know what you are\\", the first to showcase the ever-talented Dave Grohl on drums. Double-kicking as a backbone, this song makes one satified at hearing NIN at their greatest. The best selling point of this album is the variety it withholds. Some songs sound bouncy and (god forbid) happy, others sound like a sonic force is encompassing you in every which way. It's also good to hear Trent singing more. I recommend this album to anyone, regardless if you're that into NIN in the first place.
B0002IVN9W|2.0|everybody who has reviewed this album ever has said \\"oh my god how awesome is this album,\\" when they're only saying that because everybody else says its great. this is by no means a great album and the arcade fire is definitely not rock music. if you want great rock music in today's world go to bloc party and spoon. if you want an album and band that is extremely trumped by those two bands then take a look at funeral. everyone says how the arcade fire is so masterful with their ability to perform eclectic rock at its finest. they limit themselves on the instruments because they're just not good musicians. the only salvagable songs from this wreck album are \\"rebellion (lies)\\" and the second \\"neighborhood\\" song. a truly waste of $13.
B0007YMUZW|5.0|You never know what you're going to get from Mr. Adams.  He has not really settled on a style or genre, and most of his releases are some mix of rock, punk, country, pop and folk. This double cd fits nicely in between \\"Heartbreaker\\" and \\"Gold,\\" meaning it's more of a country-rock record. The band, The Cardinals, are more than fine-the guitars are layered and wrapped around the vocals, and lots of subtle percussion, piano, and pedal steel make this cd a real joy to listen to.  Some serious thought was put into the  production, and it sounds sort of tossed off and polished at the same time.  The Cardinals as a group wrote the lyrics and while they have Ryan's stamp, they are not quite as personal as songs he has written in the past.  \\"Magnolia Mountain\\" sounds influenced by the Grateful Dead, The Band, as well as the old time music sound of \\"Oh, Brother, Where Art Thou\\" and Gillian Welch.  It's one of my favorites, and I find it an inspired choice to open Disc 1 with.  Other favorites are \\"When Will You Come Back Home\\" \\"How Do You Keep Love Alive\\" \\"Cherry Lane\\" and the rollicking country vibe on \\"Let It Ride.\\" The song \\"Cherry Lane\\" starts off with Ryan's best country crooning, then the music and vocals are hushed, and they bring it all back by gradually bringing the music and vocals louder and louder until the song ends up as a rock song.  Just outstanding!  I must, however, add that \\"Cherry Lane\\" has two curse words, totally unnecessary, which prevent me from blasting it out my car window all over town. There are 18 songs in all, and they are all worth listening to.  In fact, this is the kind of cd that the more you listen, the more you find to like.  I recommend this cd to anyone who likes music and lyrics that are well-written, that is played well, with vocals that adapt to the needs of the song. One more thing-Ryan's vocals have really improved from his earlier recordings, and this record is the proof.   Highly recommended!
B00008J4P5|5.0|the white stripes 4th album elephant, in my mind, set a precedent to which rock bands have to reach for me to say they are truly great. elephant is the greatest white stripes album (yes, better than white blood cells) as every song on the album is a cant-miss great song. jacks tremendous guitar playing in this album really distinguishes hisself as the premier guitar-player in todays bands. jack is definitely comparable with the immortal jimmy page at the same age. this is a remarkably breathtaking album that will definitely change your opinion on rock albums afterward. if you think im overblowing this album, then go out and buy the album and youll find i was right. a definite buy.
B00005JLEU|5.0|There was certainly a hype around 'Spirited Away', the way there is about a lot of anim; you're supposed to think it's superior because it's not American. I don't agree with that -- 'Shrek', 'A Bug's Life' and 'Toy Story' are all masterpieces, to name but three fairly recent US offerings. <br /> <br />But here the hype is justified. I saw 'Spirited Away' at the cinema, but have to say I enjoyed it more on DVD. This kind of (basically hand-drawn, though computer-enhanced) animation needs sharpness of focus that you rarely get with film projection and I found myself enjoying the images and noticing detail much more at home. <br /> <br />Miyazaki and co. strike very good balances here -- imagination is strong, often grotesque, but never so bizarre that it becomes just a 'trip'; there is morality, but it never veers into the didactic or sentimental; there is awe and humour, the sublime and the terrifying and the comical. <br /> <br />Above all, there is simply beautiful drawing and colouring, and character animation that's both minutely observed and economical. I particularly like the range of complexity: from the Haku-dragon's elaborate, undulating curves, right down to the soot-creatures, which are like telephone doodles come to life. The computer enhancement adds stunning backgrounds and transparency effects to create some striking images. <br /> <br />Finally, it's nice to have both language versions. I tend to be a subtitle-snob; I walked out at the start of a screening of the English-language version (it had been billed as in Japanese) and haven't seen it yet, but will give it a go. To me the original voices are even more important in animation, because they're the main 'real' element, but I guess it's a matter of taste and the English version has been widely approved. And I have to admit to watching the dub of 'Princess Mononoke' one day when I wasn't feeling well enough to follow subtitles, and it was excellent.
0975991477|5.0|I'm lucky being in the Bay Area. I was introduced to Dr. Lipton's work at a delightful lecture he gave at a chiropractic college. He really fired up the crowd and had a multimedia presentation that gleamed information from what originally seemed like disparate sources and then demonstrated that there a unifying theme. His book peppers personal \\"eureka\\" moments with a laymans explanation for his theories. The theories unfortunately won't be accepted as fact for probably half a century. I highly recommend this book.
B000002H70|4.0|There are musical and lyrical connections between this and 'Pornography' (for example, anyone who remembered Smith singing 'I will never be clean again' in 'The Figurehead' would have raised an eyebrow at 'You make me feel like I am clean again' in 'Lovesong'). Although 'Disintegration' is far more listenable, the two albums do represent The Cure's career peaks; you can certainly ignore everything that came after them and most of what was in between (ahem). <br /> <br />Nearly all the tracks build slowly through sweetly intertwining lines, providing a welcome distraction from Smith's monotonous 'singing'. In fact if the album had been recorded without his vocals, just with a lyric sheet to read while listening to the instrumental versions, I'd have given it four and a half stars (if Amazon allowed half-stars). As it is, the old whiner manages to mar yet another good record. Oh well, at least the lyrics are worth hearing -- dark, of course, but in this case even darker than you think. <br /> <br />The final half star deducted because it's just too much for one sitting, and as it seems to be some sort of emotional concept album it really needs to be heard in one go. The original vinyl version was a couple of tracks shorter -- 'Last Dance' and 'Homesick' were cut, I think -- and better for it.
B00003CX5P|5.0|THIS DVD IS THE BEST THAT I HAVE BOUGHT SO FAR. THE DVD EXTRAS ARE THE COOLEST THAT I HAVE SEEN . THE MOVIE IS HIGH QUALITY. AND I WISH PEOPEL WOULD QUIT PICKING AT JAKE LLOYD FOR HIS ACTING HES ONLY A LIL BOY. THE MOVIE WAS GOOD AND ITS WELL WORTH THE BUY
B0002PZVHK|5.0|I bought 'On Land' this afternoon and have been playing it constantly -- it's been round about six or seven times already. The first time, it sounded utterly familiar, like music I'd heard a long time ago and forgotten. Every time since, it sounds different and new. I already had 'Music for Airports' and 'Plateaux of Mirror' (with Harold Budd), but 'On Land' has convinced me that Eno is, without exaggeration or qualification, a great artist. Even his liner notes are intelligent without being pretentious, a rare achievement for a musician! <br /> <br />Although very superficially similar, it doesn't take long to realize that Eno's ambient works are a world away from the lazy, sonically unadventurous tinklings of countless 'New Age' pieces (many of which were probably inspired by Eno, unfortunately). In 'On Land' every sound is meticulously placed, every treatment thoughtful and, needless to say, beautifully produced. Moving away from the idea of 'performable' music towards pure studio recordings allows a degree of control -- crucially, control of tonal contour and spatial organisation -- that makes these tracks more like aural sculptures than music. That's probably why they sound so different on different systems, in different rooms, at different angles from the sound source etc. <br /> <br />If that makes it sound like an academic exercise, be aware that this is also a very emotional record -- although the emotions communicated are usually obscure, ineffable, almost impalpable. Whereas some of Eno's other ambient works are explicitly NOT to be listened to directly, I can't help feeling that 'On Land' demands more focused attention. It will certainly repay; after just a few hours, it already feels like one of my favourite records.
B000002UAR|4.0|Let me start by saying this is not the best Beatle album,that title belongs to Abbey Road with the White album a close second. Nonetheless,this is an essential album,due to the fact it contains some of the best songs the group ever recorded. Eleanor Rigby and Tomorrow never knows are timeless,worth the price of the disc alone. Several other tracks,such as Taxman,aren't far behind in quality. The main problem with this album is that it's the only Beatle album I've heard that has more than one really poor track. \\"And your bird can sing\\" is garbage,just listen to the lyrics,and the main riff is laughable. Doctor Robert is a silly,trying to be cool drug reference track. Harrison's \\"I want to tell you\\" is average at best. Therefore,the album doesn't flow,it's one all time style best ever song followed by some weaknut half-ass track. If you're a newbie to the Beatles,this isn't a bad place to start,as it gives you taste of the old style and it also goes full strength into the Beatles new direction that Rubber Soul only hints at. What you get from this album mostly depends on what you're looking for in your Beatles album. If you want strong single songs to knock you out,you'll get all you want on this one. If you're looking for an Beatles album \\"experience\\",a flowing work of art,look to the later albums,especially Sgt. Pepper. Your mileage will vary,but any Beatle album is worth the asking price and then some.
B0006L16N8|1.0|WILL SOMEBODY PLEASE TELL ME WHY PEOPLE THINK THIS ALBUM RULES? I've heard all the hype about this album since March! ENOUGH ALREADY!! I admit I've listened to some of there older material and its ok but its nothing to write home about. Is it b/c they attract superstars, b/c one of them is married to one of them? What is it? What makes this cd worth my 13 or 14 dollars, instead of me going to the used cd store and getting it for 6 or 7? Now so that you all can't diss me for not trying it I listened to some of there new stuff and saw the video and didn't really hear anything that was just a music masterpeice to my ears. If somebody can explain to me something that makes this band great that I haven't already heard from tabolds, TV,and Magizines and your answer is actually reasonable then I will actually go out and buy the cd. But until then I think there just for old people and OLD PEOPLE ONLY!!! If thats the case then you old people need to realize that you can't rock hard enough anymore and Coldplay doesn't rock either!! I think this is only a repeat of 70's soft rock so if you want music like that then you gotta check out the Eagles or The Doors and James Taylor! COLDPLAY SUCKS ENOUGH HYPE ABOUT AN OVERRATED BAND AND ALBUM!!!
B0009HLDFU|4.0|This is the fifth album release from this front line grunge-rock group spinning out of West Coast USA. And this edition of the album is done a tad differently to what we have known of the Foo Fighters previously. This is a double CD dual disc effort that gives two sides in ample servings to all fans of the Foo Fighters.<br /><br />Disc 1 is the Foo Fighters we know and came to love with bone jarring guitar riffs and deep seated throaty vocal hooks. The first song 'In Your Honor' plays regularly on our rock station here in Sydney (Triple M)and it's a great song that starts off slowly and picks up tempo and ends on a high note. One cannot be impressed by the playmanship of the guitars. Then the third song 'Best Of You' is another hit of this album with great lyrics for romance in this contemporary world. The seventh song 'Free Me' is also destined to become one of the Foo Fighters just because of the deep drumming execution. My rating for Disc 1 is 4.5/5.<br /><br />Disc 2 is the quieter version of Foo Fighters using acoustic guitar and bass and little samples of the drums. The lyrics are sung quitely and this shows the Foo Fighters can step down from throbbing rock themes to a more quiet acoustically systematic sound. The songs 'Still', 'Miracle' are destined to play on some teenage movie sooner or later. 'Cold Day In The Sun' exemplifies the best from this CD. My rating for Disc 2 is 4/5.
B0007YBMA6|5.0|Normally I don't write reviews, but I just finished watching the KOREAN release of King Kong and I was so impressed with the quality of the picture, that I just had to let everyone interested, know about it. <br />  <br />There are so many imports of this movie being sold here that it gets confusing, I was lucky enough to receive the Korean version as a gift, and was very impressed with the quality of the image and sound. It's unbelievably crisp! It's so much fun to watch one of the greatest old time movies, specially if it has been cleaned and restored to this kind of quality. To top it off the Korean version comes with a 23 minute tell all documentary called \\"The Making Of\\", and previously unreleased restored footage is included in this version. <br />  <br />They don't make movies like this anymore, all break through special effects put a side, what a great plot! A horror movie and a love story all rolled into one. But I'm not going to waste time talking about the movie itself, I'm sure everyone is familiar with it, I just want to let everyone know that they will not be disappointed with the Korean Import it's OUTSTANDING! <br />
B0009NSE1K|5.0|I'd never heard of Clutch till I read a review of this album in a guitar mag. It got 5 stars and a plea to buy it. I try not to rely too much on reviews but you gotta to a certain extent. <br /> <br />Normally, it takes me a few listens of a CD to tell whether I'm going to like it or not. I fell in love with this straight off. It just felt so right. <br /> <br />And it does 'feel'. I can't help but swing, swirl and move. Sometimes it gets a bit heavy and you might wonder where it's all going, but wait a few bars and all is resolved perfectly; a groove follows and you're back stomping your foot and shaking your head. <br /> <br />I played this CD and nothing else for a whole week. In the house and the car. It felt like I was in some secret club (probably the Circus Maximus); among an enlightened, lucky few. <br /> <br />Search the web and you may find interviews with Neil Fallon. It will reassure that it's all genuine as is he. First time I've ever trusted a man with a beard.  <br /> <br />I'd just like to thank the group for letting me hear this. And those lyrics...
B0000AYJXR|3.0|\\"Space Jam\\" was the first feature-length film with the Looney Tunes characters...or was it a kid's-eye view of the Michael Jordan-era NBA? This mid-'90s release, made when computer animation was new, still seems more than a bit dated. That said, it's a modestly amusing live-action/animated movie, revolving around Jordan's two-year baseball \\"sabbatical\\" and his adventures with the \\"Tune Squad\\", the world's most unusual basketball team. More a marketing-based pastiche than a story, \\"Space Jam\\" has some good sequences (Mr. Swackhammer, a green-slime, cigar-chomping carny boss, and his mini-monster employees; a clever golf bit with Jordan, Larry Bird, and Bill Murray in his \\"Caddyshack\\" garb; Bugs and Daffy sneaking into MJ's house) and some bad ones (Patrick Ewing and Charles Barkley losing their power, the toons at practice). As for the basketball game between the Tunes and the no-longer-mini \\"Mon-stars\\", it shows some imagination, especially with Hubie and Bertie the mice as P.A. announcers and the final-play sequence involving Murray as a walk-on. I suppose this looked like a slam dunk on release, given how huge Jordan was in the '90s and a time when classic Looney Tunes weren't too easy to find. The animation isn't too slick and some of the jokes are flat, but \\"Space Jam\\" is still watchable- a lay-up, if you will. Some of the extras, however, are great, notably the four newer Looney Tunes on Disc 2. An aging Chuck Jones gamely reprises his classic \\"One Froggy Evening\\" storyline on \\"Another Froggy Evening\\"; the Roman \\"Saladus Caesar\\" bit is good. The others, created by Greg Ford, come very close to the originals in humor and timing, especially \\"Night Of The Living Duck\\"- see Daffy croon in an all-monster nightclub, dubbed by, of all people, the late Mel Torme! There's also an extended \\"Bugs and Daffy's Video Stars\\"- overlong, badly mixed at times, but still a collection of old-school (and very old-school) Warner musical clips going back to the '20s. Overall,if you're a Looney Tunes completist or old Jordan fan, you'll probably like this a little. But I'd go with the \\"Back In Action\\" movie, which at least is more original and genuinely funny in spots. Of course, the fabulous  <br />\\"Golden Collection\\" sets are the greatest...that's all, folks!
B000060P79|5.0|This is one of the best cd's i have ever bought besides american idiot this is tottaly worth buying.
0887307280|3.0|This book gives you the basics you need to run your own small business.  Im not sure the author's frequent interations with the female character, who has \\"done all the wrong\\" things in her business is effective, but it beats just listing strategies needed to be successful.  I bought this book since it was recommended reading by the folks who sell Quiznos franchises, but it can be used by any small business venture.
630469654X|5.0|I rented this at Blockbusters and have watched it 4 times.  Another love story in medieval times.  The photography, in my opinion, is stunning. Especially watch for the hawk flying across the lake.  An evil bishop casts a spell on Isabeau and Navarre because he cannot have Isabeau. What a sore loser!!  She turns into a hawk at daylight and he turns into a wolf at sunset.   <br /> <br />What a kick to see a very young Matthew Broderick and a gorgeous Michelle Phieffer.  Rutger Hauer is so good also, but turn down that awful music!! What were they thinking? <br /> <br />An outcast monk befriends (reluctantly)the lovers and it is one tight scene after another.  The ending is on the edge of your seat adventure.  But dont worry, love finds a way!!!!!
B0009KA7BS|1.0|Down right boring Keanu Reeves vehicle is an insult to your senses. The movie is shot way too dark in certain scenes of the film and the special effects are tepid at the very best. Keanu Reeves gives his all but regardless of his efforts, he's not right for the role. His performance borders on way too dark to unintentionally funny plus he looks bored with what is going on. You're supposed to believe in his character but you end up just annoyed with him and that not good if you're trying to buy the story of the film. The story itself is very shaky and it makes no sense in some parts of the film. Angles and demons can't cross over into this world but yet there are half-breeds all around the city and the angle Gabriel is walking around like nothing is happing.  Makes no sense but that's some of the inconstancies this movie has and it has too many of them. The only good thing of merit that the movie has to offer is the performance of Rachel Weisz, who manages to give a complex, strong and moving performance that gives you a brief pause and makes you wonder on how this movie could have been much better off if they just centered it around her character alone, with out all the hoopla and special effects that it has now.  That would have worked much better and been much more effective than the overblown special effects movie that it is now and probably would have been much scarier to boot.  I would have rather paid to see that then this film right here.
B0000508U6|5.0|Having discovered Colplay \\"backwards,\\" listening to their more recent stuff, I finally went out and purchased their debut album.  <br /> <br />I won't go into a \\"song by song\\" narrative, I'll just say that a band hasn't affected me on a personal level like this, since 4 guys named John, Paul, George and Ringo.  I am not speaking of talent, or creative energy--the Fab Four have no equal. Just sheer emotional drive. Merely a personal observation. <br /> <br />There is hardly a weak song on this album. (Even Sgt. Pepper's had a bad song or two!).  <br /> <br />I'm sold on Chris Martin. I just don't tire of listening to his fantastic voice.
B000002HFU|5.0|Just bought this album today. This album is definately a great album, a VERY grimey album. If you like the grimey style that Method Man brought on his Tical album, you will love this album, if you like ODB's style that is.

B00005JNNZ|5.0|A basketball coach who considers his players students first and athletes second?  Go figure!  This movie is based on the real-life man who stands up to parents, patrons, and a tough school board to insist that his players make above average grades and stay out of trouble in order to play on his team.  Coach Carter inherita a losing team with a bad attitude and very little work ethic.  He insists on high standards for his players and despite some protests, he gets them.  Samuel Jackson is the perfect actor to play the part of the uncompromising coach who goes to war against a system which, as he says, guarantees the failure of his players.  He looks beyond the immediate won-lost record to insure that his players will be winners in life.  This is an inspiring movie about a man with the right priorities who knows what kids really need--discipline, goals, and a true mentor.
1593974256|4.0|This final installment in the \\"Jihad saga\\" is certainly anything but light teading....and in some ways is more of a horror novel than a sci-fi novel.<br /><br />It is also filled with surprises.....some of which seem  like logical developments....and some that perhaps should have been more carefully explained.<br /><br />There are so many loose ends in  this novel,  it leaves me wondering  \\"Is this really the final  Dune prequel?\\"
B00000342V|5.0|A soundtrack in the truest sense of the word, the songs on Curtis Mayfield's \\"Superfly\\" form a narrative for this 1972 blaxploitation film. \\"Shaft\\" may have gotten credit from the Academy for Isaac Hayes score, which is brilliant in its own right, but \\"Superfly\\" blows \\"Shaft\\" out of the water. The album speaks to the perils of dope-dealing, the lure of fast-money in the inner-city, and why it's not cool to be a junkie. The songs feature driving basslines, wah-wah guitar and of course Mayfield's amazing falsetto. A better album you will not find. If your a fan of 70's soul music as I am I wonder why you don't own this already. It's a socially conscious album but not preachy, is wholly original and is completely funky. When listening to this you'll feel like your cruising through the mean streets of Harlem in a '72 Caddy Deville with your gangsta' lean. What's amazing is how true the album sounds some 30 years later. The inner-cities still have the same problems that Curtis was talking about. An album way ahead of it's time it sounds better with every listening. A true classic.
B0009KA7BS|5.0|THis is my first exposure to \\"Hellblazer\\" and I genuinely like it.  I realize the film may not compare to the comic book, but I am judging the film alone.  As far as I am concerned, the film was one of the sleepers of the year.   <br /> <br />John Constantine (Keanu Reeves) is an exorcist.  His death from lung cancer is getting closer and closer to his soul and John's guaranteed a \\"Go to Hell and Do not Pass Go\\" card when he dies because he attempted suicide when he was very young--and actually died for a short time.   <br /> <br />Angela (Rachel Weisz) is a cop who can pick a serial killer out of a crowd and shoot them.  She sees things, though she denies it. When her twin sister died of suicide in a mental hospital, She believes some other evil forces were at play because her sister would never have done something like that.   <br /> <br />Angela learns about Constantine from a priest and goes seeking him for help.  Though a cop, she doesn't know about the daily struggle Constantine goes through to keep the balance between Good-and-Evil and the infestation of half-demons in the world.  <br /> <br />Demon activity is increasing in LA and it's harder to kick those bad boys back to Hell.  Turns out, a homeless man named Francisco has discovered the Spear of Destiny in a remote Mexican church and is under the Devil's instructions to bring the spear to LA.  If Francisco makes it, Hell's going to win the balance.  As he gets closer to LA, things get even more dangerous.  Constantine and Angela have to team up to fight the forces of evil.   <br /> <br />This is one rare instance where I liked the book, the movie, and the DVD.  I am going to check out the original works this film came from--because if I enjoyed the pale copy, I think I will seriously love the original.  <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />
B000002WPI|5.0|Before hip-hop turned to hip-pop (most of todays rap music and most of the stuff u see on BET & MTV) hip-hop was something special.  It was about tearing up the beat with Bangin lyrics that when you heard them you would say \\"damn dude did you just hear that?\\"  Im 19 years old now and I still love this cd.  It came out when i was in 2nd grade.  I remember first seeing the videos for \\"Method Man\\" and mos def \\"CREAM\\"...after that I was hooked.  I still can't believe how Wu-Tang has sooo many amazing MC's in there group.  Its amazing because there are hardly any good MC's on tv today and this group has soo many.  <br /> <br />Anyways on with the cd.  This is one of the best hip-hop cd's ever.  The whole album is full of hott lyrics that put almost all rappers today to shame.   <br />1. Bring da Ruckus 5/5- great opening track with hott verses...Ghost, Rae, INS, & GZA all tear it up <br />2. Shame on a nigga 5/5- great song with ODB, Meth, and Raekwon <br />3. Clan in da Front 5/5- GZA only track...GZA kills his second verse <br />4. Wu-Tang:7th Chamber 5/5- Most Wu-Tang members are on this song except U-God and Masta Killa I belive.  Bangin. <br />5. Can it be all so Simple 5/5- Raekwon & Ghostface Killah's first duet togther...Classic <br />6. Da Mystery of Chess Boxin 5/5...U-God's first verse on here, INS, Raekwon, Ghostface, and Masta Killa's only verse on the Cd and it is mad hott...Classic <br />7. Wu-Tang Clan aint nuttin ta f'wit 5/5..Classic Wu with RZA, Method Man, and Inspectah Deck <br />8. C.R.E.A.M 5/5- the song that really got me into Wu...the lyrics are amazing from Raekwon and Inspectah Deck(INS)...classic <br />9. Method Man 5/5- the intro is funny...classic song with only Meth and he rips the track with his flow <br />10. Protect Ya Neck- the first Wu-Tang single ever to be released featuring every member except Masta Killa...classic <br />11. Tearz (after Laughter) 4/5- my least favorite song on here because of the chorus but RZA and Ghost spit nastyverses that have real life meaning too them <br />12. Wu-Tang:7th Chamber part 2 5/5- same as track 4 but with a different beat. <br /> <br />Overall this is one of the best rap albums ever.  WU-TANG FOREVER <br />
B00005JNSK|5.0|Now this is the quirky weirdness of Tim Burton at his best. Wash The Planet of the Apes out of your mind before you watch this, and think rather of Edward Scissorhands or Big Fish. As usual, since this film is a remake of a film that is considered classic, it generated much controversy. Why remake a classic? As the filmmakers said, they weren't remaking Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, they were making another adaptation of Roald Dahl's children's novel, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. I consider both films classics. Depp's Wonka is much weirder and less benevolent than Gene Wilder's Wonka, but they both bring Dahl's eccentric character to life in different, but legitimate, ways. The visual world is as odd and fantastic as ever in a Tim Burton film, especially Wonka's factory. One thing I was wondering about was exactly how Burton was going to introduce Wonka. In the original, there is this terrific build-up to the \\"reveal\\" of Willy Wonka, where Gene Wilder comes limping out with a cane and his head down, then suddenly rolls into a back flip. I thought, \\"How will Burton do it? Can he beat that?\\" Well, he beat it, and the introduction of Wonka to the kids as they approach the factory is perhaps the best moment of the whole film.  <br /> <br />
0385486804|4.0|Krakauer's now famous rendering of Chris McCandless's' story goes to the heart of an unusual situation; unusual but not actually unique.  McCandless's' story is age-old, and even in recent decades, proves but another example of the wilderness imperative sought out by young men (normally) in an effort to discover what lies beneath the social and cultural influences that dictate so much of our lives.  Likewise, the impulse toward asocial behavior has marked a number of the best writers, including, among McCandless's' favorites, Tolstoy and London.  But when asocial attitudes become antisocial behavior, close perhaps even to paranoia in their complexity, and the wish to escape society becomes an impulse toward exclusion, the results, if we hear of them, are generally tragic. This indeed, may be Krakauer's professed attraction to McCandless's' story: that inner animal that seeks models it cannot itself follow into the heart of such darkness.  But there have been many others, who have gone unnoticed in all the talk of McCandless's' idealism and/or navet.  <br /> If you are young enough not to remember the \\"back to Nature\\" movement of the Sixties and Seventies, it would be good to dig around and find some appropriate examples of \\"living off the land\\" that actually worked.  California communes, rural Indian ashrams, and an array of individual loners headed into the wildernesses of both Alaska and Canada during those two decades, proved that living apart from one's society was not only possible but, at times, Edenic.  It might be of use, to that same young crowd, to look into other books, like John McPhee's Coming into the Country, which deals with survivors in the Alaskan territory, and because of it's date of composition, necessarily touches on that same \\"back to Nature\\" movement.  Krakauer does a good and thorough job of exploring the impulse in McCandless, and in others, to find a new human start outside the dictates of a culture-bound society.  Yet, in the end, Chrisfound himself turning back to the knowledge of survival in his readings, even as most have.  <br /> This is perhaps the most unusual aspect of this saga of a present-day wilderness sojourner.  What some have called McCandless' arrogance and ignorance about the Alaskan wilderness may be simply a misreading of the complexity of the world which lies at the heart of contemporary education and society.  Bred to a life of casual survival, the view of what it means to be up against the odds has little meaning.  Survival starts with adequate knowledge; it is not something you can easily train yourself with in situ. The chance that McCandless poisoned himself, after reading about eatable seeds and then perhaps mis-identifying them, only goes to show how trial and error can often be a short experiment, unless there are others there to learn by your mistakes.  And there are many others who had actually come before.  Robinson Crusoe was lucky enough to have fresh seafood, and some plentiful supplies of tropical coconuts, without which, he too might have ended up dead after a chancy dinner. McCandless's heroism therefore must be tempered with his lack of understanding, not of the exact knowledge to survive, but of his need of that knowledge.  This is something that may well define the problem with contemporary heroes generally.  <br /> The mistakes we make are generally smoothed over by others in the culture in which we live.  Parents, bosses, school instructors, are guides to how to survive in a complex environment.  Nature is no different, and demands instruction as well.  Chris's experiment, or experiments, for Alaska was not his first attempt to \\"go it alone,\\" show the dangers of a popular culture understanding on something as dangerous as wilderness survival.  It does not mean that what McCandless did was stupid, only perhaps premature.  If he'd walked another hundred miles into the woods, chances are he would have come across any number of Sixties' refugees who are stillout there doing it correctly.
B000A88F22|5.0|As many other people mentioned, reality shows are becoming more and more fake, due to scripts and planned storylines.  This show is refresingly real and shows how down to earth Britney Spears really is!  The season finale contains exclusive footage of the Spears-Federline wedding which you won't see anywhere else!  I seriously recommend you pre-order/buy this DVD from Amazon at this great low price, if not only for the DVD, but for the bonus CD too which includes her new single \\"Someday (I Will Understand)\\" and the theme for the show, \\"Chaotic\\" !
B000002I4S|5.0|In listening to Coltrane's Giant Steps, it gave me all the reason as to why I listen to jazz. Both smooth and traditional.  In reveiwing the album, this album is one-of-a-kind.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants to start off in jazz or has little knowledge of Coltrane.  My favorite tracks are 1, 3, 5, 6, and 7. I especially enjoyed Naima, and Mr. P.C. which is a upbeat jazz track.
B0000069NM|5.0|What this should really read is John Scofield with Medeski-Martin-Wood. What the perfect combo. John Scofield, one of the greatest modern stars of the guitar. And MMW, one of the hottest combo's to come out of the 1990's.  <br /> <br />This is pure funk and groove. A great listen from start to finish. You know, there are a lot of guest appearences from time to time, but this is the ultimate.  <br /> <br />From the opening track, A Go Go, you are sure this is going to be a soulful album. Billy Martin's funky drum intro and Chris Wood's acoustic bass trills start the mood of the album. Cool, groovin' and John Medeski's and John Scofield's soulful sounds.  <br /> <br />This ain't a straight ahead release. This is funk and groove. The Sco-man and MMW should record more albums together. In fact, it would be awesome if he actually joined the band. It would be nice to have Sco's flavor in MMW. Maybe they'll have to change the name to Scofield-Medeski-Martin-Wood. I don't think this is going to happen, but maybe more albums together wouldn't be so far-fectched.  <br /> <br />This disk is from 1998, and I just discovered it this year. I'm sure this is going to be a classic 50 years from now. All, I know is that I'm gonna keep spinning this more and more. <br /> <br />Excellent! <br />5 Stars <br /> <br />
B00070Q7VO|5.0|Since his self-titled debut sold millions around the globe a few years back, Buble has continued to surge ahead in the music world. Take a listen to this cd which is, in my humble opinion, the premier cd of the year of the adult contemporary category. <br /> <br />It's Time is a collection of tunes with one fantastic thing in common - Buble takes them and makes them his own. The exception is the tender ballad Buble wrote about coming Home and it in itself will become a standard for future generations to sing and love. <br /> <br />If I sound convinced that Buble IS as good as his cd and concert sales indicate, just give this a listen and hear the man's gift to all of us. Buble is HOT!
B0006SSOHC|1.0|I gotta say, when I went to see this movie, I was expecting something different. From the ads, I figured it was going to be a hardcore psychological thriller with a hearty dose of the old ultraviolence to keep things moving along. <br /> <br />I was pleasantly surprised to discover that Saw is actually not a thinly veiled takeoff of \\"Se7en\\" at all! Rather, it's a tongue-in-cheek parody of the genre. Or at least, I think it was. I wasn't too certain after a while--that's how closely they walk the line with this movie.  <br /> <br />After the initial genre confusion wore off, I found it a very enjoyable film indeed. Ask the guy two seats ahead of us, who kept turning around to tell me off for laughing. <br /> <br />Don't be turned away by the promises of sadism and gore--they're in this film, in spades, but they aren't the focus of the movie itself. Yes, it's bloody and overblown. But it's more than that--it's a total laff riot. From the Insane Black Cop to the Adorable Little Girl In Peril, this movie has it all. It's a veritable cornucopia of cheesy cliche and saw-it-coming-a-mile-away plot twists.  <br /> <br />Imagine \\"Se7en\\" put to slamming metal music, filmed in some guy's semi-finished basement with a dirty 80 watt bulb to light the room, and you have Saw. <br /> <br />Cary Elwes plays an extremely convincing role as a self-mutilating albino grub-man with tiny pretty eyes. The Adorable Little Girl In Peril debuts with authenticity and passion, but you'll find the scenes stolen again and again by that lovable scamp, Mr. Dead Guy On The Bathroom Floor.  <br /> <br />I think the author of the original script is in this movie as well, but I didn't see much of him because I spent a good 2/3 of the movie balled up on the sticky theatre floor, giggling helplessly while an usher nudged me angrily with the tip of his shoe. <br /> <br />Bottom line:  <br /> <br />Come for the chilling look into the psyche of a serial killer. Stay for the wacky dismemberment sequence.  <br /> <br />Saw: you'll never look at your poo-filled toilet the same way again!
B00005O3VC|5.0|My eldest brother introduced me to the world of Monty Python last year, and of course I found it amazingly, brilliantly funny! He recently bought me the full box set of all Monty Python movies, and in my opinion, \\"The Holy Grail,\\" is the funniest Monty Python ever...<br /><br />Everything is well thought out and executed in true Python style. From the coconuts and the swallows to the witch burnings and killer bunny, this movie has it all: absurdity, humour, erm...tragedy? Ok not that really, but anyway. The storyline is simplistic but of course there are massive deviations from the actual story thanks to the British Police and various French K-nighits that constantly impede King Arthur's noble quest to find the Holy Grail. The whole Python group deliver a dynamite performance filled with fall-over-laughing skits and absurd situations, whether it's the difficulty of building a castle in a swamp or using a Trojan Rabbit to infiltrate the French Fortress.<br /><br />The extras on the DVD include old movie posters and drawings for Nostalgic fans, an extra short on the use of coconuts (which I found incredibly useful for training swallows), Various sing-a-longs icluding a Lego Knight Version of the \\"Camelot\\" song and trailers from various films. All in all, this DVD has the most extra material on it for Python fans, so much so that it's on a whole other DVD. That's right, 2 DVDs! What more could you ask for?<br /><br />If you love political and social satire, any Monty Python will have you laughing your head off. But if you like it in a Medieval setting, then \\"Monty Python and the Holy Grail,\\" will be your cup of tea delivered by a European Swallow (African Swallows are larger but are non-migratory). Anyway, this movie kicks buttocks! 10/10 for the world's silliest men around!
B00005QDW5|4.0|To start out, I am a huge pink floyd fan...that is with the exception of the syd barrett years.I can apperciate his ideas,but to be honest, I find his lyrics lazy,his music boring,his voice annoying,and songs just plain dumb.I really wish that his works were excluded from this cd.But, none the less, he was still the founding father of floyd. <br />That aside, I first bought this album before i had any other floyd.I was mostly just looking for the hits(Brick in the Wall,Money,Time, etc.) but started to really get into the songs.When I began to buy the albums, though, i realized that fans were missing out on the concepts and stories the amazing albums gave us.Pink Floyd never wrote songs that were meant to be singles.They wrote songs that were meant to be just one part in the body of the album.One thing that really got me was that the version of Echoes on Meddle was 23 minutes long but cut down to only 16 minutes for this album and all of Shine on you crazy diamond should have been 25 minutes but cut down to 17. <br />Now that I've gotten out all my beefs with the album, it is time to talk about the pros.The producers do a decent job making the songs flow together, as they would on a regular album.Also, all the hits were present, including those of gilmour, which are often forgotten.Oh, and by the way Gilmour's works are some of floyds best.The Barrett songs could have been taken off to add more of the Waters and Gilmour songs.  If you are a real Barrett fan, check out Relics. <br />The album is great and has to be listened to from beginning to end.It sends you into the crazy world of Pink Floyd, and at the end of High Hopes, one of the most psycedelic songs, Bike follows bringing you back to reality.Speaking of Bike, it is a funny song, but in my opinion, one of the worst songs ever written and ruins the whole moment of the album. <br />If you have only heard the hits, then definitly get this album.
B00003CX95|5.0|This movie has so many dynamics and subsequent complications that it will leave you filling very satisfied.  While it is based off of true events, you need to keep in mind that it is rather one-sided and rather anti-British.  Nonetheless, a very compelling movie that  includes war, romance, politics, honor, and loyalty.  A must see!
1881273156|4.0|I am really looking forward to reading this book! A very close friend recommended it very highly. Just the title alone captured my attention. I've learned a lot in life, but this is definitely new territory for even me! Being able to communicate to the one you love, and understanding their responses is critical to making the relationship work.
B00000DOYH|5.0|Most people credit Led Zeppelin's fourth album, Zosa, as being their masterpiece, but I disagree. Yes, it may have the innovative and excellent \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" on it, but overall the album isn't as good as Led Zeppelin 3 or Physical Graffiti, their sixth studio recording. <br /> <br />Physical Graffiti, in my opinion, is consistently better than any of the other Zeppelin albums I have heard so far. Its two discs feature so many great tracks that it is hard to name them all. Suffice to say, there are obviously some that are better than others, but all of them are good. <br /> <br />Highlights of the album include \\"Kashmir\\", the orchestrated hard rock classic, \\"Custard Pie\\", which is very catchy and has some clever metaphors in the lyrics, \\"In My Time of Dying\\", which sounds like the title of a Beatles song or something but is most definetely bluesy Zeppelin, \\"In the Light\\", which sounds like Led Zep's tribute to Pink Floyd, \\"Bon-Yr-Aur\\", a two minute instrumental that showcases Jimmy Page's excellence with an acoustic guitar, and \\"Ten Years Gone\\", a lamentful ballad of regret.  <br /> <br />The whole album just seems more collaborative than other records of their's, and though Led Zep has always been known for doing whatever the hell they want, Physical Graffiti seems even more experimental than their other efforts. Their goof-around, light side is showcased in \\"Down by the Seaside\\", their taste for the east and for orchestration in \\"Kashmir\\", John Paul Jones' keyboard/organ skills in \\"In the Light\\", and plenty of other offbeat sounding songs. <br /> <br />Physical Graffiti also features some of Led Zeppelin's longest songs, including \\"In My Time of Dying\\", an eleven minute death cry with Beatlesesque lyrics and excellent Page guitarwork. <br /> <br />Along with Robert Plant being in top form, sounding more emotional than usual, the musicians all excel at what they do. Jimmy Page is of course brilliant at guitarism, but on Physical Graffiti he just shows how good he can be, by throwing excellent solos into almost every song. John Paul Jones' liking for orchestration, keyboards, and organs is given a chance to shine, and John Bonham is just masterful, his drumming never falters. Plant's lyrics are a lot better on Zeppelin's sixth than on their previous efforts as well, providing for a more enjoyable listen.  <br /> <br />Overall this album is just a great piece of art and has been quite underrated by rock critics. The best piece of graffiti that will ever exist is a Led Zeppelin album. Well then.
B0007YBMA6|5.0|Wowsome Movie, Crystal Clear quality of Image and Sound!!! It blew me away!!! <br />I just saw this Korean Edition of King Kong and I looooooved it!!! I remember seeing the old version, years ago, but in no way had the impact it had this <br />time. What a beautiful story and watching it with that Crystal Clear quality of sound and image makes all the difference in the world!!! Plus this Korean DVD version includes previously unreleased scenes and a documentary \\"the Making Of\\" that as a Big Movie Fan I always enjoy and have a ball watching!!! I have to give this one a 5 stars. No Doubt about it!!! My advise: Get it and watch it. You WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED. That is a promise. This movie rocks!!!
B000053V7Q|5.0|The \\"That's The Way It Is\\" Special Edition DVD shows Elvis' creative talent and solid work ethic as well as his magnetic personality which was a balance of unusual humor and seriousness. His charisma is special and something that the people around him were clearly drawn to judging by the way they looked at him and interacted with him both on and off stage. The DVD also shows how great looking Elvis truly was. His looks are just too hard to explain! He was a great looking guy who could sing and charm even the birds right out of the trees with his voice!    <br /> <br />The DVD shows Elvis' versatility as a musician in that he could sing and perform to all kinds of music including blues, soul, country, rock and soft or power ballads. But it proves that even though his voice had matured and he was singing and performing better than he ever had, that this was a beginning of a strange period (1970-1977) when he was robbed of more top ten hits despite the great recordings he had created during that time. The DVD proves how he did an excellent job in organizing his TCB band (with the help of Charlie Hodge) because they can clearly play anything Elvis wanted them to. Many of the TCB band members were some of the top studio musicians during the mid to late 1960's before Elvis hired them to form his TCB band after the '68 comeback special, especially for his Las Vegas comeback in July of 1969. His legendary lead guitarist, James Burton, would later become a member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  <br /> <br />One special feature of the DVD is when Elvis brings his own interpretation to songs made popular by other people such as You Don't Have to Say You Love Me and Mary in the Morning.  <br /> <br />Elvis also shows that he was a fan of some of the Beatles music as he does a great job with Get Back which is accompanied with his hit from the early 60's, Little Sister (several months earlier he had performed the Beatles Yesterday on stage which was included on his \\"Elvis onStage: February 1970\\" album and later he would record in studio the Beatles popular song Hey Jude).  <br /> <br />The moves he conducted throughout TTWII are unbelievable. His experience with karate (he was an 8th, some even claim a 9th, degree Black belt at the time of his death) certainly payed off as he incorporated some karate influenced moves into his show and the fans loved it! He makes the hip-shaking Elvis of the 1950's look simple compared to Elvis 1970. He prowls the stage like a tiger in a jungle whenever he walks and he energizes the stage with wild moves whenever he is interpreting a song as he attacks each song with an intensity and emotion that came from the depth of his soul. <br /> <br />One feature of the DVD that is special is the part at the end that shows Elvis mingling with people backstage, especially celebrities, including older ones such as Sammy Davis Jr., and Cary Grant, who are drawn to Elvis and curious about him proving that in a roomful of celebrities, it is Elvis who forever rules!   <br /> <br />My only criticisms of the DVD is that it should have contained some of the material from the original film. For example, most fans were very upset that Sweet Caroline was not included in the DVD version. This has long been a favorite among Elvis fanatics because of the way Elvis sang and moved to this classic Neil Diamond hit. Also, the DVD is only 95 minutes long which is no excuse for this type of DVD especially knowing that there are several hours of concert footage in the vaults, including complete concerts. In comparison, the '68 Comeback Special Deluxe Edition has over 7 hours of material! Therefore, it seems that the fans were ripped off in that regard. Maybe a deluxe edition of TTWII should be produced that includes more concert and studio footage especially showing two different versions of the same song? For example, Just Pretend was on the original TTWII album, but it is performed slightly different by Elvis and his band on the DVDversion. It would be great if they had filmed a performance of the album version and included it on a future DVD release along with the current version on the Special Edition DVD! Furthermore, only a couple of moments in the DVD (coarse language, jokes) should have been edited out as they are not entirely appropriate for the general audience which Elvis was always publicly sensitive to. Why exclude Sweet Caroline and other music for material that is not of any entertainment value for music fans? However, seeing him clown around with his circle of friends (some would later betray him) is interesting to see for some fans since it is of historical importance. Elvis always had a childish streak that sometimes went overboard especially around his male friends as the DVD proves. At least he had some religious people in his circle at that time who reminded him of his religious roots although this part of Elvis' roots are never seen in the DVD (that would not happen until the documentary \\"Elvis on Tour\\" came out a couple of years later and when the He Touched Me video/Cd came out a few years ago). <br /> <br />Still, this is a DVD that has a ridiculously low retail price and is worth buying whether you are an Elvis fan or not because this is about history and about one man who redefined popular music and became a legend. It is mostly about Elvis and his music and how he would want us to remember him.
B000060P79|5.0|This CD is really good. It has all the spunkiness that a good rock/pop CD should have. No doubt my favorite band. A must have in the CD world. Ya'd have to have a whole ALL the way through ya'll little head if ya didn't like this CD. Need I say more?
B00079FUI6|1.0|I tried watching this show, it's boring and not funny at all.  It seems like it's just a hyped up primetime soap opera.  Plus it's sad that adultery is supposed to be funny.
B000077VPU|4.0|Damn Marketing: As in almost everything released, the companys always leave something out, deliberately, so they can release later a \\"new expanded special edition\\".   DVD`s should be an improvement in every sense on what VHS editions were lacking.   What I have said, it applies mostly on Soundtracks, because they often leave out the songs that are the ones that people were looking for, or include different versions. Concert releases: you know they were performed, and simply not included, or poor editing, video and/ or audio. DVD`s, movies & music: not improving video/ audio, leaving out stuff, sometimes even more than the VHS editions,etc., well you get my point.
068987474X|2.0|This is a super-slick book-biz hustle aimed at the eternal wallflower at the dance of life.  Written by Greg Behrendt (your eternal big brother) and (love's labors always lost) Liz Tuccillo of TV's Sex and the City,\\" \\"he's just not that into you\\" is just the sort of book that Miss Lonely Hearts can curl up with on a Saturday night with a tub of chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream (ah, I wish I could) instead of the usual Harlequin romance.  I mean YOU are worth it!<br /><br />This sort of pandering by Greg and Liz to the unlucky-in-love who find Sex and the City the highlight of their wretched (but ever hopeful) lives is nothing short of Huckster Street smarmy with a purpose--the purpose being to separate YOU (who deserve love and happiness) from your hard-earned money, which is deserved by Greg and Liz because they are just so darn clever and pander so shrewdly to the susceptible reader--which makes me think that before working on Sex and the City they wrote TV commercials for diet foods or hair shampoo, or whatever the commercial is that insists, \\"YOU are worth it!\\"<br /><br />The deeper problem with this book is that the women who \\"write\\" the letters to Greg are not real women but ideas of women from Greg's imagination.  Sure they were based on people he knows and he probably even quoted a line or two from some of them verbatim, but they are not real people.  And their equally fictional men are all very much alike in that they have only a phony sensitivity for women and really only care primarily about their own desires and fulfillment--and note that they, too, are products of Greg's mind.  Some men will tell you the truth about how they feel.<br /><br />A second problem is that his facile answers of what to do (usually, dump the loser) are too simplistic and don't allow for the compromises that characterize all human relationships, especially those that lead to successful marriages.  No one is perfect, and people really do need to be forgiven, and they need a chance to grow.  Most of the (fictional) women in the book are in their twenties and thirties, a time of real social and emotional growth by both men and women, and so it is not always wise to give up on a relationship.  People do get to the point where they are not likely to change much, but usually that takes place later in life.  I am not, repeat NOT, excusing some of the behavior of the men described by Greg's \\"women.\\"  There is never any excuse for abuse or neglect.  I am only saying that if a guy misses a call or forgets your birthday, yes, he is not Wonderful in All Things, but remember few of us are.<br /><br />As for Liz Tuccillo, who writes the \\"Why this is hard\\" rebuttals to Greg's pronouncements, I think she too needs to understand that love is a two-way street, a case of give and take.  She's had trouble holding onto the kind of male she finds attractive.  She's 41, still single, still dating, and it could be said, still looking for Mr Goodshaft, whom she finds all the time.<br /><br />You want to know why?  Because she's masochistic?  Maybe.  Because she's possibly neurotic and married to her work?  Maybe.  Whatever the reason, she needs to develop a realistic appreciation of actual men, not just those she imagines are alpha males.  Maybe she needs to find some short, balding guy that still lives with his mother and make him happy.  Maybe she needs to be kind to omega males, and keep searching through the all too depressing heap of omega males until she finds one that isn't half bad.  Omega males need love too.  And it could be said that \\"not half bad\\" is appropriate if you're 41-years-old, never been married and have a \\"been-dumped\\" rap sheet as long as the closing credits to a Hollywood epic, and especially if you are the type of person who thinks just because you are successful at work, you are a great catch.<br /><br />Greg's point seems to be that most guys are jerks and Liz's experience seems to proves it.

(And by the way, these stereotypes are not necessarily the ideals that we should be looking for in mates.

0375507256|4.0|I bought Cloud Atlas based on the intriguing reviews that called the novel a \\"puzzle book\\" with stories that stopped without warning at a crucial narrative point, followed by a completely different story with different characters written in a different style.  In this sense I was not disappointed.  I was amazed at how Mitchell could switch genres at the drop of a hat going from a nineteenth-century first person narrative to a quick-paced mystery story to fascinating science-fiction and back again.  However, if the novel was just about the author's ability to integrate what at first appear to be unrelated narratives, then Cloud Atlas would at best be a postmodern gimmick and Mitchell is well aware of this.  In one of several instances of self-referential humor, one of the novel's protagonists, a composer, writes a piece of music that mimics the style of the novel.  He wonders, \\"Revolutionary or gimmicky?\\"  In another story, a book editor notes that he hates \\"flashbacks, foreshadowings, and tricksy devices.\\"  Thankfully, Mitchell does much more than use tricksy devices.  Each of the stories is good enough to read and enjoy on its own although in the second half of the novel, it becomes clearer how the stories are related.   <br /> <br />The one problem I had with Mitchell's writing style was in the final (chronologically-speaking) story set in a post-apocalyptic future on the islands of Hawaii in which the story is told in an extreme Southern U.S. accent with more apostrophes than you can shake a stick at.  It was quite difficult to read at times.  Nevertheless, the actual story was compelling.   <br /> <br />This is one of the best novels I have read in a long time.  Not only does it entertain, but it makes you think.  Each narrative comments on the differences between the haves and the have-nots in society.  The concluding statements at the end of the novel are particularly well-written.   <br />

The only beef I have with this blessed tome is that it is prehaps a little too concise.  While it dishes out its wisdom in highly digestable packets, I found myself, more than once, checking the index for crumbs that were not there.  Overall, though, at its price, you cannot ask for a better value.
B0001NBMBC|1.0|I Thought rap was bad, this nu metal genre is even worse, slipknot along with 98% percent of the nu metal scene is what's everything wrong with music these days (ever since that braindead shotgun drug addict kurt nobrain ruined rock), this cd is a waste of my time and everybody else time.    this album is a nilhilistic, insulting, mean-spirited, disgusting and reprehensible geek show.    and one person said that Slipknut is better than kiss, how can you even compare those losers to a great band that sold 80 million copies and made better music and have better makeup than these losers  that's like comparing that godawful tony yayo to wyclef jean.    This is by far the worst genre of the decade, it's worse than paper.    Even 80's hair metal beats this anyday of the week.    Thank God I'm a independent voter.
B00000DHR0|5.0|Celine Dion has one of the most beautiful and lovely singing voices ever recorded.  On this Christmas album her gift truly shines brightly.  None of the traditional Christmas carols are jazzed up (which is one of my pet peeves with many Christmas albums released today), and all of them are sang very sweetly.  Celine's rendition of \\"O Holy Night\\" is not only the best treatment I've ever heard of that song (which is also my favorite Christmas song) but also quite possibly the most inspiring musical sound I've ever heard from a human voice.   <br /> <br />This is a great Christmas album and a worthy addition to any Christmas music collection.

0451457994|4.0|2001 is a much different work of science fiction than any other of its time or since.  There are no ray guns or aliens in it, no spectacular space battles or things more associated with Star Wars or Star Trek, where science fiction is concerned.  All the action in this book is a showdown between a human, astronaut David Bowman, and the life-like computer, HAL.  It almost seems as if, throughout the whole book, the most human character ends up being HAL himself, witnessed by his last words as Bowman tries frantically to disconnect him.  So the other characters were a bit static in a way, like Heywood Floyd for instance, but I can live with that.<br /><br />His premise of the development of mankind is fascinating to say the least--that we were \\"enhanced\\" by an alien species and owe our early survival to them.  This is truly a unique and groundbreaking work of science fiction, much better than anything anyone else could have written.  But I take off one star for the lack of \\"humanness\\" in some of the characters.<br /><br />2001 may not have arrived exactly as Clarke planned, but maybe 2050 will be as he described in this book? It makes one wonder, if only the Apollo program were not stopped short...

Not as much action or dinosaurs. Actually i cant say I enjoyed this one. With all the impossible stunts done, I mean at least they keep it partly realistic in the 1 and 3 but this one you Knew what was going to happen. Unless your a complete dumbass.

B0009KA7BS|1.0|Flat Keanu Reeves vanity project that lacks a lot brain and allot of showmanship with a story that makes no sense and a leading man who can't act the role he's playing. Rachel Weisz and Peter Stormare are about the only actors in the film who give great performances and that's really because they are over qualified to be in a movie of this type. Weisz gives too much heart and soul to her role and Stormare gives a sadistic edge that is way too fierce to be in a movie like this. Both of them are head and shoulders over Keanu Reeves in the acting department and both of them literally blow him out of this film. <br /> <br />See it for their performances only because it's the only good you are going to get out of this bad movie.  <br /> <br />
B00028HBKM|1.0|Mel Gibson took all the money he made from the movie, and instead of using it for charitable purposes, and making use of the money in some method that was in the spirit of Jesus, he instead took the money to buy a private island; one to be used only by himself and his friends.  After such controversy over the film, I was surprised that there was no Christian continuum, and that the cardinal sin of greed was instead rewarded.   Another poor moral lesson:   his father, who has written books  praising the virtues of Anti-Semitism and debunking the Holocaust, Mel Gibson  went on record saying that he loves his father and all that he stands for (even Arnold Schwartzenegger, whose father was a Nazi, made amends for this in the past by speaking out against bias, prejudice and hate, saying that what his Nazi father did and said was something that is anti-Jesus).   <br />I was further disappointed that the lessons of the Bible and of Jesus  apparently don't  apply in Gibson's case, who abuses his body with alcoholism,drugs and chain smoking, and excessive cheating on his wife (he has gone on record with this).   <br />Maybe Mel Gibson is not a man of God at all.  <br />
B000001Y5J|5.0|Although I am a fairly new Nine inch nails fan, this record immediately grabbed me.  An angry, heavy, short and complex effort from NIN is exactly what this is.  When one opens this little EP of Trent's they are greeted to a rather unusual packaging as well as 99 tracks.      1. Pinion 3/5: an Intro that is so-so, it could have built up to a real song, but its alright as far as Intro's go.    2. Wish 10/10: Awesome, Sweet, Excellent and Kickass can all be used to describe this song.    3. Last 10/10: equally as sweet as the last track, this one sounds a bit like closer in terms of lyrics, its awesome.    4. Help me I am in hell 5/10: This is really the only flaw on the album, an Instrumental on an EP, that is neither grabbing nor boring but as it is only 1:56, it only serves as the buildup to the next song, and comes across to the listener as unnecessary and disappointing.  A song like this doesn't belong on an EP.    5. Happiness in Slavery 10/10: almost forgives the last track, I just love the middle part of the song.  The live version from the Woodstock 94 concert is cool as they added a solo and Trent demolished a keyboard.    6. Gave Up 10/10 yet another hard hitting track, which is very much like tracks 2 and 3 yet it stands on its own.    98. Physical (you're so) 8/10: a cool Adam Ant cover that outdoes the original but it is weaker in comparison to everything else here.    99. Suck 10/10 an awesome Pigface cover that outdoes the original.      This album makes a great companion to the Downward Spiral, filled with anger, excitement and complex and detailed musicianship brought to us by Trent Reznor.  Even though there is an intro and a unnecessary instrumental, the other songs are just so good that I can't help but give this a 5/5.  Broken is definitely a must have for any NIN fan, whether you are new or old.  Hoped this helped.
B000001E7T|3.0|PJ Harvey is a talented singer-songwriter.  She expresses a kind of feral angst.  Her lyrics are seeped in metaphorical archetypes.  Every emotion she expresses is underscored by a kind of grandiose and primal psychology.  \\"Down by the Water\\" is like a perverse fairy tale that warns about female vulnerability.  The lyrics are nuanced but they're not so far out as to be inaccessible.  Her voice is powerful and versatile- ably spanning a wide range of emotions.  But the bad part is that her music is too simplistic.  The songs frequently only use two or three chords.  And because there's not a jazzy sense of improvisation or risk, the effect is stifling.  \\"Send His Love To Me\\" is emblematic of the record as a whole.  It's got a great hook.  It's filled with palpable anguish.  And yet the simplistic structure bogs down the songs, resulting in a dull redunancy with  nothing left to tickle the senses.  There's a lot that's good about this CD- and about PJ Harvey in general- but the musical immaturity prevents it from achieving greatness.

B00005JNSK|4.0|Being a fan of Johnny Depp, and the original movie, i decided to check this movie out. The movie was great visually, and very funny with all of Wonka's one line quotes, but for some reason it just felt a little long and boring. It is still better than the original, but at times you felt like you wanted to leave before it ended. <br /> <br />Barely coming off with a masterpiece performance in Pirates of the Caribbean, i thought Deep would never top that, but he was great here, however falling a little short.
B0007OCG4W|4.0|CLOSER is not a great movie and I'm not sure it makes you think about Life in ways that make up for its lack of greatness. But it is quite a watchable movie, if only for the brilliant star power of its four main and only characters: Jude Law, Natalie Portman, Julie Roberts and Clive Owen. Owen, being the least well-known of the four, nevertheless manages to deliver the strongest performance, or has the best lines, in Mike Nichols' adaptation of Patrick Marber's play. But my favorite is Natalie Portman as Alice. She is beautiful and  sensational in this film, representing  - if I may speculate - Innocent Love. Her character is there to show how we can tragically screw up Innocent or True Love. And who hasn't? The other three characters in the story are busy hurting each other and essentially form a love triangle with Anna (Roberts) as the confused, sought-after prize. While Alice is the most innocent of the four she delivers the hardest and most honest blow at the end. She is really the only character to admire of the lot. I have been a devoted fan of Natalie Portman ever since BEAUTIFUL GIRLS and she doesn't disappont in  CLOSER. Basically a downer film, CLOSER nevertheless has some fine performances and the script is sound. The problem is that one is left questioning why four near-middle-aged, attractive, successful people willingly engage in such screwed-up, hurtful, juvenile relationships. One wonders if such a script got made into a movie due to Hollywood Myopia. That would explain in general why box office receipts have been falling off: Hollywood produces way too many movies like CLOSER which seemed targeted for a certain group of intellectual elite who think it chic to get depressed while being entertained; yet these kind of movies are artistically representative of the lives of only a fraction of ticket-buyers and are likely based on the writer's dysfunctional friends and relatives. Most of us in America, thank you, are basically happy types and don't want to be confronted with depressing subject matter when we go to the movies for a good time.o be confronted with depressing subject matter when we go to the movies for a good time.

B000002BE9|5.0|I'm sure a lot of people like Tidal for the beautiful and sophisticated melodies, the jazz-influenced hooks, the sensuous vocals, or any number of the album's other merits. But what makes Tidal truly exceptional, in my opinion, is how thoroughly Fiona presents the realities of a depressed personality type.  The songs mostly deal with love and unrequited desire (nothing new there) but in the subtext of the lyrics is the coded language of fear, self-hatred, and the desperate sensuality that depression alternately taints and accentuates.  On Tidal, Fiona writes songs as if no one would ever listen to them- as if the album is a musical diary.  The fact that she is a musical genius writing solely to satisfy her artistic desires enables the songs to be as beautiful as they are, and their power comes from how un-self-conscious and oblivious Fiona appears to be to the expectations and demands of the outside world.  Tidal is a glimpse into a lonely and isolated spirit, untainted by music industry pizzazz or pop posturing.  The fact that it communicates and connects with so many people is beautiful with relation to its original purpose.      If it seems like I'm reading a bit much into the album, it's probably because I am.  And that, in fact, is its greatness: that it is good and complex enough to enable the listener to read into it.  I'm sure others have differing opinions on what the album means to them, but I think we can all agree that the bulk of the album, songs like, \\"Slow Like Honey\\" \\"Never Is A Promise\\" \\"The Child Is Gone\\" \\"Shadowboxer\\" are enduring compositions, giving plenty for the listener to chew on.

I read that Bono's father died shortly before this concert and during the transition from \\"All I want is you\\" to \\"Where the Streets have no Names\\" Bono pours out his grief in a way that nearly brings me to tears each time I watch it.

B000929AJQ|5.0|I believe that many Nine Inch Nails fans have a problem with comparing new NIN releases with too many of their previous releases. It is key to be able to look at each release as a completely new work, totally unrelated to anything previous. That is what we must do here with With Teeth. If Trent Reznor was to follow in the footsteps of The Downward Spiral or The Fragile, he would have no where to go musically and Nine Inch Nails would surely die. He must do something new as an artist and that is what Trent Reznor does here in With Teeth. <br /> <br />As for the actual album: <br />It is an excellent collection of songs. The piano scattered across the heavy guitar riffs give the album a definite uniqueness and it helps fill the void that would be left otherwise.  <br /> <br />Standout tracks are: \\"All the Love in the World\\", \\"Every Day is Exactly the Same\\", \\"Only\\", \\"Sunspots\\" and \\"Right Where it Belongs\\".
B000A2G9AS|4.0|Apparently the third time was the charm -- little-known Brit-rock band Muse's third album was the one to break out in the US. \\"Absolution\\" is definitely a dark little gem -- the songs focus on deterioration and lost love, set against classical-sounding rock.<br /><br />\\"And pull us through/And this is the end/This is the end of the world.\\" An ominous piano crashes into \\"Apocalypse,\\" which is only one of several songs with a deathly edge, such as the epic \\"Time is Running Out\\" or the soaring \\"Butterflies and Hurricanes\\" (\\"Fights and battles have begun/Revenge will surely come/Your hard times are ahead...\\"). Even the most intimate song is the thoughts of a dying atheist, afraid of what is -- and isn't -- after death.<br /><br />But Muse is also focusing on love. Dead loves, lost loves, and the idea of loves that can't or won't last out. The delicate, bittersweet \\"Sing for Absolution\\" is perhaps the purest example of this -- a love song for a woman who is apparently dead. Other songs focus on the mix of love and hate, and the feeling of love crumbling away.<br /><br />That focus of death and love -- or both together -- is what makes \\"Absolution\\" so compelling. Muse is often written off as a Radiohead clone, but their sound is more complex, and their focus is darker. A riff here and there echoes of Radiohead, and Matt Bellamy's voice echoes that of Thom Yorke. But that's about all.<br /><br />There's nothing spacey or eerie about Muse's brand of rock. Instead, they opt for a soaring, rich sound, with orchestral melodies. It's obvious that Bellamy has studied not just rock, but classical as well -- he integrates the epic quality of classical music into a melody written for guitar, bass, piano and drums. At times the sound is so massive -- not loud, but massive -- that it sounds like the speakers are going to explode.<br /><br />With music like that, one would think that Bellamy's voice would get lost in the mix. Surprisingly he doesn't -- he's no Jose Carreras, but his voice has gained new maturity, able to be a standard rock voice one moment, and then a pure choral vocalist the next. He brings across the heartbreak and anguish in the songs with startling purity, as if he means every word.<br /><br />In fact, those songs are the one weak spot -- they aren't as big or as rich as the music, which makes them sound a bit tepid. They're not bad. But they simply don't measure up to the musical genius. So ignore the words, and just listen to Bellamy and the music.<br /><br />The orchestral wall-of-sound has been Muse's trademark, and they are in fine form in their third album.

B00029NMRM|2.0|Thanks to falsified dental records supplied by his former neighbor Nicholas Oz Oseransky, retired hitman Jimmy The Tulip Tudeski now spends his days compulsively cleaning his house and perfecting his culinary skills with his wife, Jill, a purported assassin who has yet to pull off a clean hit. Suddenly, an uninvited and unwelcome connection to their past unexpectedly shows up on Jimmy and Jill's doorstep: it's Oz, and he's begging them to help him rescue his wife from the Hungarian mob. To complicate matters even further, the men, who are out to get Oz, are led by Lazlo Gogolak, a childhood rival of Jimmy's and another notorious hitman. Oz, Jimmy and Jill will have to go the whole nine yards--and then some--to manage the mounting Mafioso mayhem.<br /><br />There isn't much about this film to enjoy. I was hoping it would be a lot funnier than it was, but I just didn't laugh at anything except Kevin Pollack's character who was hard to understand most of the time. I had no problem with the cast, I enjoyed all of their performances. Especially Kevin Pollack and Natasha Henstridge who really made the film at least somewhat watchable. If only Bruce Willis could have had more funny lines, or Matthew Perry been a little funnier, or if Amanda Peet...wait there's nothing wrong with her. Anyway, I can only recommend this to someone who likes the cast but not necessarily the story, otherwise, this movie gets a 5 out of 10 because they did try...to some degree.

0375507256|2.0|This Book is well-written but has a terrible theme: that in every human society, slavery is inevitable. In all sections except the second one (Belgium), there is a clear master/subservient dynamic, especially clear in the first and last sections, which are about slavery as we think of it in America. I fell in love with the first few pages about the Chatham Islands/Moriori, which I remember from a Jared Diamond book, and has always intrigued me. But as the book proceeds the mood gets darker, sadder and finally extremely depressing. <br /> <br />I would have liked this book a lot more if it weren't for the horrible middle section about Hawaii after the downfall of civilization. The invented dialogue was bad enough, but the message at the end about slavery being inevitable unless you are warlike or powerful is (hopefully) very wrong. After I finished this book, I was depressed for several days, an unusual feeling for me. A book shouldn't make you doubt the future of the human race, with all its talk about suicide and slavery.  <br /> <br />On a side note, the \\"Prescients\\" in the Hawaii section are never explained enough, are they aliens? (they have invisible ships) But their interest in trade makes them seem human. <br /> <br />My favorite parts were the first halves of Adam Ewing and Robert Frobisher. Its all downhill from there, although until \\"An Orison from Sonmi 51\\" the tone is still normal. That latter section is sad because that seems to be the direction we are heading in, a future of corporation-ocracy,  with neo-liberal economics or authoritarianism in many countries of the world today. <br /> <br />I rarely ever read an entire book I don't like, but the fact that I completed all of Cloud Atlas shows that it is not the style or structure of the book thats a problem, but its message of hopelessness. <br />

That's why, when I saw that the trilogy was going to come to DVD I had to get them.  After I got the set and watched the movies, I was..... Well let's just say, \\"George, did you have to mess with a masterpiece?\\". <br /> <br />George Lucus is a great movie maker, but why change so many parts of the original.  In ROTJ, the ending was changed.  I don't think changing Anakin to a different actor was needed.  And what's up with the music?  Expect to see a lot of new CGI. <br /> <br />I guess I could go on and on, but I won't.  Let's just pray that nothing else get's changed 10 years from now.
0066620996|3.0|The best part of the book is that it is based on an empirical study looking at comparisons with companies that did not make the leap. As with most business books, it is light on real implementable action items. <br /> <br />Collins has a bad habit of going off on tangents or unnecessary detail rather than sticking to the crux of his point. He repeats the same points over and over beyond the necessity for emphasis. There's a huge amount of padding to get it to exactly 300 pages. A good editor would have cut the padding and set out its solid content in a crisp manner. <br /> <br />Other than that, it is written in clear, understandable language and avoids cheap clichs and pop sound bites. <br />
0743454537|4.0|This was the first time I had read a book by Jodi Picoult and I have to say that I was not at all disappointed. I thought the story line was brilliant.  The only thing that frustrated me a little bit when reading this book was that the first person character changed every chapter and almost like a soap opera you are left hanging for a couple of chapters until that character comes back again. However, that was also arguably part of the charm of the story....it allowed you to identify much better with each of the characters.  I'm sure that's something a lot of people loved about the way this book was written. It's just a matter of taste. I went on to read \\"Vanishing Acts\\" (which had the same first person switch up) and one of the earlier books called \\"Plain Truth\\" which didn't and was ultimately my favorite of the three.  I would recommend this book to anyone and also suggest some of her other books as well.
B00004Y6NP|5.0|I was at a concert last night in Berkley, CA and at the Greek<br /><br />Theater, Mark Knopfler played all 4 of these classics, So Far<br /><br />Away, Money for Nothing, Walk of Life, & Brothers in Arms. Other<br /><br />than that, he played Telegraph Road. Very good. Anyway, this is<br /><br />a good album! Maybe a little not as good as either Making Movies,<br /><br />or Love over Gold. All these songs are pretty good!! I think the<br /><br />Money for Nothing on here I think is done really well and I like<br /><br />to repeat it over N' over again. Sometimes 3 when even better.<br /><br />Also, check out Your Last Trick, Why Worry, Ride Across the River, The Mans Too Strong, and One World.
B0006L16N8|5.0|Coldplay never ceases to impress me! My music tastes require a lot of melody with haunting sharps and a depressed voice, I love the sound of sad or slow songs because they give me something to love about my own life, when I think about how much theirs must suck. <br /> <br />However, just because Coldplay writes many depressingly romantic songs doesn't mean that below the melancholy notes, there's no optimism! The song \\"Swallowed in the Sea\\" can have some optimistic romance feeling to it. <br /> <br />Coldplay has made some beautiful songs for people to sing along to, whether in the car or shower or listening to Chris Martin belt out tunes in the auditorium. Either way, Coldplay has seriously done it again with this work of art.
B0000TLA9G|5.0|Check it out, it's Sweet Child O' Mine here reviewing Guns N'<br /><br />Roses Greatest Hits to let you know that this is a great album<br /><br />and this is a classic!! Best songs, Welcome to the Jungle, Sweet<br /><br />Child, Paradise City, Knockin' on Heaven's Door, Civil War,<br /><br />You Could Be Mine, November Rain, & Live and Let Die. How come<br /><br />they never played Civil War on the radio?
B000005QH3|5.0|Well done -- a classic in its day.  The simple plot allows the film to focus on the intensity of the determination shown by the driver to outfox the cops. It says so much with so little and that is its strength. It is better than Smokey & The Bandit, which is not bad in itself.
B000002OX7|4.0|This CD has a few great songs. Why isn't it considered hard rock?<br /><br />Check out classics like Baba O Riley, Bargain, and Won't Get Fooled Again.
0321200683|5.0|This book could really be titled \\"Everything You Wanted to Know About Message-Based EAI, But Were Afraid To Ask\\". It's a very comprehensive book, which goes beyond mere patterns to introduce the reader to a wide range of topics in the world of messaging. It forms a strong and useful counterpart to the many more general books on architecture patterns, for example Martin Fowler's \\"Enterprise Architecture Patterns\\" in the same series. <br /> <br />The book is very accessible, written and illustrated clearly and assuming very little initial knowledge. However it will also provide value to the experienced messaging developer, formalising his or her knowledge and suggesting new ways of using messaging to solve different problems. I particularly like the way that Hohpe and Woolfe lay out each pattern using language and visual styles to naturally delimit the sections of the pattern, rather than using lots of sub-headings. This increases the readability significantly. <br /> <br />Several books on patterns talk about a \\"pattern language\\", the idea of describing a complete design in terms of named patterns for the architectural form of each component. However this is one of the first books I have read which really adopt this idea - the authors have created a new visual language, which they first use to describe basic patterns in terms of basic message constructs, and then describe more complex patterns and solutions using the icons for the intermediate patterns. Best of all you can download a Visio stencil from the website and start using and extending the pattern language yourself. <br /> <br />The book is remarkably technology-agnostic, providing many examples in both .NET and Java forms, and with a fair sprinkling of other technologies, for example using proprietary EAI tools such as Tibco. I have certainly seen and used some of these patterns in older file-based integration schemes, and I suspect many of them work for Web Services too. As such the book has a much better claim to be a true \\"patterns\\" book than one wedded solely to a single technology base.  <br /> <br />Each group of pattern descriptions is followed by a detailed \\"practical example\\" section which shows how one or more messaging technologies can implement the preceding patterns to solve real problems. There aren't any real \\"antipatterns\\" in the book, but the book is realistic about when a given technology or pattern should not be used, which is just as valuable. <br /> <br />If I have a complaint it's a minor one, that the book is too long. Including the multiple introductions, it runs to over 700 pages. Dipping in and out my read through has taken many months. Like many patterns books, in an attempt to keep each description self-contained you find by half-way through that some basic things are being repeated regularly. A more \\"normalised\\" structure might have been better. Also, although most of the book is very readable, a couple of chapters by \\"guest\\" authors, including the final one on Web Service standards, take a more academic tone. <br /> <br />That said, this is an excellent book, which can be read from cover to cover, or stands as a general-purpose reference, and I strongly recommend it.
B0002OERI0|1.0|this item sucks SO BAD!! Why do people like this CD, this CD never won a lot of god damn awards. The only good song is Boulevard of Broken Dreams!! People, stop buying this thing so<br /><br />much!! Mabye in the next 10 years, it wont be popular anymore.
B00005JO8T|5.0|The bond between siblings is often stronger than the bond between parents and their children. For much of our lives, we look at our parents as \\"the enemy\\": we love them, to be sure, but it is a love that is flavored with adoration and repulsion at the same time.<br />But it is with our brothers and sisters that we can ultimately form a comradeship, a we-against-the-world bond-a bond that is never broken, though interrupted surely, for our whole lives.<br />Director Susanne Bier resurrects the ancient biblical story of Cain and Abel and sets it in Denmark and Afghanistan in her film \\"Brothers,\\" which tells the story of Michael (Ulrich Thomsen, so good in \\"The Celebration\\") and Jannik (Nikolaj Lie Kaas)...two brothers who are as different from one another as night is from day.<br />Michael is an army officer, married to Sarah (a luminous Connie Nielsen) with two beautiful daughters. Jannik, at the beginning of the film, has just been released from prison and is none to happy to see his father awaiting him  for dinner at Michael's home...from which he promptly exits brimming with anger when his father says something to the effect: why can't you be more like Michael?<br />Michael is the perfect son, Jannik is the black sheep. Michael is dutiful, respectful, has never gotten into trouble. Jannik drinks too much, associates with the \\"wrong\\" people and has been in jail for bank robbery.<br />Then Michael is sent to Afghanistan, is presumed dead from an explosion and everyone's world is toppled.<br />Bier makes some interesting and dramatic points about what we humans are capable of in times of life-threatening danger and great need. Do we step up to the plate or do we cower from responsibility?<br />Bier and her cinematographer Morton Soberg carefully and thoughtfully arrange the mise en scene so that the intimacy between the characters is palpable. The first scenes alone between a wary, suspicious Jannik and a chilly-towards him, Sarah are gorgeously and thoughtfully framed so as to accentuate the huge emotional chasm that exists between these two people: they both loved Michael and yet they can't initially verbalize, much less physically show how they feel. They are frozen with despair and stricken by regret.<br />\\"Brothers\\" is personal, hyper- emotional but never mawkish. The acting is of the highest order. Don't come to \\"Brothers\\" expecting easy answers and pat resolutions. You won't find them. What you will find is a beautifully realized and executed story about human beings caught in the silky web of living in the contemporary world: a world tainted with war and deceptions both personal and global.uge emotional chasm that exists between these two people: they both loved Michael and yet they can't initially verbalize, much less physically show how they feel.

B0006399FS|5.0|U2 once again show that they are on form.  Without doubt one of the stand out bands from 1980-2005 and counting.  With HTDAAB, they add another set of great music to an already legendary legacy. <br /> <br />GG NO RE.
0345350499|5.0|An interesting take on the Arthurian Legend from a feminine perspective. The interesting things about books and movies about the Arthurian theme is that there are always different perspectives , and different characterization.<br />This book centers on Morgaine , Arthur's dark and bewitching half-sister. Unlike many versions , she is given a sympathetic portrayal here. She is determined to preserve the legacy of Avalon and it's pagan religion , against the growing  Christian faith.<br />The other main character is Gwenwyfar , Arthur's pious and beautiful bride, torn between her devotion to the Christian faith , and her love of Lancelet.<br />A lot of internal dialogue , but the world of Avalon is truly brought alive here.<br />Bursts of passion and conflict animate the novel , as we read about the dashing Lancelet , the ambitious and striking Morgause, the Knights of Arthur , the Druid Taliesnin and the deformed bard, Kevin.
034544678X|5.0|I have read a lot of books about dogs, this one has been one of the best. It explains the behavior of dogs and why curtain human ideas don't work, and what does in a language that easy to understand and how to train dogs  and why it works.<br /><br /> I really love this book and I intend to make it the advice book I use with my dogs.
0786890754|2.0|I was not impressed by this book at all. The characters were all immature and VERY unrealistic, with corny dialogue and narration. It was mostly just irritating to read. I did not find the funny parts funny or the emotional/sensitive parts moving. The concept of the notes from the deceased husband seems an interesting idea, but the plot just seemed to drudge along.
B0006L16N8|2.0|The appearance of Brian Eno seals it: we're listening to  Coldplay as U2 Jr. on this album, and man... it's a crying shame. I thought PARACHUTES was a pretty decent album, and thoroughly enjoyed A RUSH OF BLOOD TO THE HEAD (despite the fact that, at its greatest moments, the latter cribs directly from The Chills' criminally-overlooked masterpiece, 1990's SUBMARINE BELLS); however, if you close your eyes, and allow the stadium-sized vocals and the processed-guitar army of X&Y to overtake you, you can almost see Bono and Edge manifest themselves in your mind. I'd suggest that Mr. Martin and Co. go back to The Chills. We've got way too much U2 in the world as it is.
B000002G6J|5.0|Far too short as far as I'm concerned.  After the final song, I wanted more.  I repeated it over and over again the day it arrived.  Since then, it has not left my car stereo CD player and something even more monumental would have to replace it.  \\"Mojave\\" is my new most favorite instrumental song of all time.  Prior to that, Bach's Fugue in E topped my list.  Simply put, the most interesting CD I own.
B0006L16N8|4.0|X & Y is not a follow-up album to Coldplay's brilliant RUSH OF BLOOD TO THE HEAD, it is a separate piece of art that must be approached as its own entity. It is a colorful pallet of music that covers an entire spectrum of sound, and while there is no definitive theme running through Coldplay's latest album, it is clear they have reached a mastery of their talents. In their third attempt, they present to the world slow-burning ballads that reconstruct your soul like \\"Fix You\\" and \\"What If,\\" and equally rock out with jams like \\"Talk,\\" \\"White Shadows,\\" (which is amazing live) and \\"Speed of Sound,\\" a more commercially friendly song. But choosing one song over another would do the album an injustice. From beginning to end, Coldplay delivers. Again.
0783116934|5.0|This movie was never hyped up or promoted very well.   In fact, I bought my copy from a \\"dump bin\\" several years back. <br /> <br />Do not be mislead.  This is a true sleeper with fine performances from Donald Sutherland and Stephan Rea.   Based on a true story of a serial killer in Russia. <br /> <br />Even at it's bargain price, it has a permanent place in my collection of crime movie favorites.
B0000004WM|1.0|With this album Sam's career tumbled, which is understandable, because basically all songs are weak. You can get into the Full Force song \\"Hurt me\\", but already the lyrics aren't convincing. \\"Another night\\" or \\"Spirit of America\\" are rather boring songs stressing on hits like Madonna's \\"Justify my love\\" and American enthusiasm. Not convincing
B000068TPN|5.0|I am late to review this, just having become aware of Amazon.com. <br />Previous reviewers have mostly at this time, said it all. <br />But Mel Gibson has done it again with another great movie.  This one covers what previous movies on Viet Nam have not.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|This is probably by far the best musical I have ever seen!!  Everything in the movie is very well done, as in the acting, the music, the fantastic singing, the whole production . . . I highly recommend this movie to anyone who has not seen it. My friend did not really want to see this movie, because she thought that she would not like it. Yet one day she decided to watch it at my house and it turned out that she thought it was a great movie! My friend is not a fan of musicals, yet she was really pleased after she saw this film. I have not spoken with hardly one person who has not enjoyed this film. So, if you have not seen this movie I recommend that you rent it before you buy-just in case if you are one of the few who do not enjoy the movie. Hopefully, you will not be disappointed, I sure was not!!!
B00006CXSS|5.0|This one is another must for the person who is building a library of films on WWII.  It must not be missed.   When it came out I paid full price for the first editions, not once, but three times as I bought it for both of my sons for Christmas that year. <br />The actors were relatively unknown at that time and this helped you to actually focus on the series and not look to the actor to \\"carry the day\\".  I truly cannot recommend this series enough.
B0009MDPYW|1.0|Unimaginative thriller that pits Keanu Reeves on a mission from god in order for him to get entrance to heaven in order to escape from the clutches of eternal damnation. The story is not written too well, going back and forth between inconstant ideology to just flat out bad pulp dialog. It even does an about face and contradicts what was set up earlier in order to set up a lousy climax that makes everything into a bad and tasteless joke. Keanu Reeves is just wrong for the role and his delivery of his lines are criminally bad. His performance is with out a doubt his worse and he does not hold any credibility with his character. Rachel Weisz does give a great and giving performance that does hold your interest in the movie but other than her performance, the movie does not hold well in it's narrative and Weisz is basically holding the audience interest by herself while the movie keeps fumbling away towards to pathetic end with one clich after another. Peter Stormare is good as well in his small role as the devil but he's not really in the movie at all and his performance is a lot more interesting than Keanu Reeves himself. I hold much respect for the effort made by Rachel Weisz and Peter Stormare but other than their great performance, there is nothing here to see. <br />
B00003CXE7|5.0|I have watched this movie dozens of time since buying it.  It is one of the best in the \\"swords & sandals\\" genre.  Of the many brought out in the 50's & 60's, only Ben Hur remains a true classic in my point of view. <br /> <br />The actors are all very good and the late Oliver Reed and Richard Harris left a last legecy with their performances in this one.
B0006399FS|5.0|Just another great album from possibly the greatest music band ever.  Also just press the no button below cos u know u want to.  Do it....yes do it......do it! <br /> <br />Great work from U2 once more!
B00012QM8G|5.0|Classic film at it's finest.  Needs to be in every library of good WWII films. <br /> <br />While it is in black and white, this will not reduce your enjoyment of this film.   In truth?    I don't know if I could have stood watching it in color.
0060926317|5.0|Whether the story is false or true, backwards or forwards, aboriginal like or not, is irrelevant. In fact the author clearly states that the tribe she was with was rare within the aboriginal nation. In fact, I really don't care what nation or race she was with. To me, that was not the most important message. <br />I liked this book because as the book suggests, I believe that humans do have the capability to be present, spiritually confident, healthy, conscious, happy and productive. I can't agree more that our societies have fallen to being more left brain minded, crowded, destructive, judgmental and selfish. I hope this book inspires readers to be more conscientious and respectful about the world we live in.  <br />Personally, I think the writing was a little too simplistic. But because it is simplistic the beneift is, I can lend it to my younger friends and friends that are just begining to learn English.
B00005JK8K|5.0|This is perhaps the only movie so far that has any envolvement showing the parts that Native Americans have played in any of our wars.   Yet the fact remains that Native American men have taken part in every one of our wars.   Even the War Memorials in Washington, DC portray African Americans, Latin Americans as well as Americans of European descent.   Why, I ask are Native Americans so neglected.  For heaven's sake!   These people are Orignal Americans.  This is their country too, and many have died in all of our wars for it.  It has come to my attention that Clint Eastwood is in process of making a war movie about Iwo Jima and that Adam Beach is in it.   I can't wait to see something new in the way of a war movie showing envolvement with our wonderful native peoples
B0002Z0EYK|2.0|I enjoy historical features of any kind and am not really particular about abosolute details, after all, a movie is entertainment.  THIS movie, however, had nothing that appealed to me.  I definitely agree with the other reviewers that the movie lacks chemistry and the characters are flat.  I'll add that the dialogue is predictable, full of cliche and lacks believability, so much so that I have currently paused the movie to read reviews to determine whether to waste the next hour watching the rest of it and return it to my rental store.  I enjoy Brad Pitt in most movies, this was an insult to his ability as an actor. He looks good, though.  \\"Helen\\" is a disgrace of bad acting.  The battles were okay, but overdone, the diagolue overdone, the sappy-ness overdone \\"please don't fight...please...\\".  By the way, I'll second the question, why does Brad Pitt have a British accent?
B0009KA7BS|5.0|I had no idea what to expect going into this film (just watched it on DVD a few minutes ago).  I had heard some negativity from fans of the comic (I've never read the comic myself); and it certainly had the potential to be a flop.  But I absolutely loved it!  The plot was interesting, the acting was good, the effects were great -- and there was not a boring moment.  What could have been a hack, predictable plot was always surprising and interesting.  Hats off to the writers and director -- with all the crap horror/thriller that gets on the big screen, this was a welcome change.
6305882592|5.0|Central message of the movie is that, just like there are a lot of ways to find GOD, there are a lot of ways to find love, and until you \\"find yourself,\\" you have a lot less love to give to the world.  One must find one's own song in life to have this experience be as meaningful as possible.   <br /> <br />
1594200106|5.0|Loved this book.  I can sometimes chew through 3 books a week and have never written a response- This one was worth the time.
B000006IUQ|5.0|Baldwin and Hopkins are masterful actors in this film.  This film's suspense is top notch, and Hopkins' performance proves to me that he is in Olivier's class as one of the top five actors of all time, hands down.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|My exposure to Michael came courtesy of the Regis & Kelly Ripa show the other morning. What I saw and heard made me want to see and hear more of this handsome young crooner. He struck me as a nice young man with a beautiful voice. The way he and Reg & Kelly interacted was fun, and the duet he did with Reg just solidified my view of his talent which is amazing. <br />Now that I have this cd in constant play on my machine I am so happy!  <br />Quando, Quando is magnificent, Home is magnificent, Try a Little Tenderness is magnificent and the list goes on and on. <br />A must have as far as I'm concerned.  <br />And thank you Regis for letting me know about your secret! <br />
0767803434|5.0|What happens when the leader of the free world gets hijacked on his own airplane? A damn fine movie!<br /><br />I like it when the good guys win. I like it when the bad guys get their @$$'s kicked in a big way. I like it when people do the right things for the right reasons and the results are good. I guess I'm old fashioned that way. That is what this film is like.<br /><br />Harrison Ford plays the president. He is not just any US president; he is a former war hero and he means what he says. He stands up for what is right. While returning from a state visit to Russia, his plane gets hijacked by terrorists. The secret service manages to get the president to an escape pod and get the pod launched. When it is recovered, the president is not on board. He is still on Air Force One with the bad guys and his family and staff. He's hacked off and goes about taking care of business. For him, that means taking care of his people.<br /><br />The bad guys are as bad and vicious as they can be. The good guys are scared but, mostly, they are honorable and try to do the right thing. I wish real life was like that.<br /><br />The film is filled with twists and turns. It is also filled with unexpected \\"cliffhanger\\" moments. To relieve the tension, it also has some great light moments.<br /><br />Watch this one when you have time to sit through the whole thing. You won't want to stop for anything.
B0001HAISG|5.0|This admirable adaption of J. M. Barrie's classic tale of the boy-who-would-never-grow-up is an instant success. For once, it's a children's movie, that's not just a children's movie. It's actually believeable due to the emotional impact and universality of the theme (who didn't think about growing up when they were a kid?). The would-be love that blossoms, and fades, on screen between Peter and Wendy is nothing short of magical, and the actors who portray the story are all excellent. Like I said, this film can draw anyone into it's realm of magic and appeal because of it's theme's universality. It's all up to the viewer though, to accept it (echoing the common \\"I do believe in fairies\\" moments in Peter Pan-like productions), it is about adults remembering they were children once too, and it is for kids because it is a children's story. And one that hardly any child can't help but be swept up in. Aside from the emotional pull of this film, which is unexpected, with this version you can actually tell immense effort was put into every detail of the film's creation. The sets and effects are literally jaw-dropping, the art-direction and cinematography exquisite. One of the highlights is seeing the first-ever believable \\"flying sequences\\" in the film. And the hopping about the London sky scene is just as amazing as when Peter and Wendy and her brothers first fly into Neverland, wonderfully designed and executed in it's structure and scope. Captain Hook and the pirates are not comical (thank goodness!) and the film captures the ominous side of the villains as well as the youthful spirit of the story. All of these emotions and themes are vibrantly enhanced by James Newton Howard's magical (as usual) score. All in all, this film is absolutely wonderful, so much so, that I found myself (very surprisingly) scoffing the other Pan productions I had seen (including the Disney film, which seems lax and half-hearted in effort in comparison). The acting, direction, design, look, sound, and effect of the film is complete. One of the best movies I've ever seen, and it took me completely by surprise!
B000001Y5X|1.0|first i must say, i luv manson and his work, except this album. i dont kno wut reznor found good in this. antichrist superstar and thereafter is what i luv so much about manson. and this is too awfully dark it really  gets to repetitive. i heard sumthin bout sum charles manson clip or sumthin in this cd. i dont really reccomend this at all. heck, ur better of with greenday than this 1.
B0007OASII|3.0|I am a true Kamelot fan,    This release isn't that good, not anyway near being their best.     Maybe they had a tight dead line, or made this album under pressure.   It isn't magical, the melodies sounds like something they      attached together randomly, the lyrics lack spark in many tracks, it is very well produced, but not well writen.    And don't get me wrong, there are a few great songs here    (very few) but if you are in mood for some lovely original     GENUINE mlodic power metal by this PRODIGIOUS band, this isn't the album to purchase.       IF you want a taste of the TRUE CAPTIVATING KAMELOT, try       Karma, or Epica or The Fourth Legacy,     these are their true great exalted creations, filled with   fast and lovely tunes      and truly enchanting.     songs like \\"Shadow Of Uther\\", \\"Forever\\", \\"Descent Of The Archangel\\", \\"Karma\\", \\"Kingdom come\\", \\"Sailormans Hymn\\", \\"The Fourth Legacy\\", \\"Feast For The Vain\\", \\"Farewell\\", are only a slight shred of what made this band #1, and there isn't anything as good in The Black Halo.
B000002H2H|5.0|Ride the Lightning is definetly one of Metallica's best albums.  It's definately better thought out than KILL 'EM ALL (not that I have a problem with it or anything). I don't think it is better than Puppets, but I think it deserves more credit that it is now receiving. This is how the album breaks down: <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 1. FIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE: It starts off with a slow, acoustic     <br />    riff, but don't let that fool you, because it turnes into a   <br />    fast heavy metal riff. I think that this's the best track on  <br />    the album, but it's a close call 'cause there are other great <br />    songs like FADE TO BLACK and CREEPING DEATH. I give it ***** <br />    stars. <br /> <br />2. RIDE THE LIGHTNING: I like this song for many different <br />   reasons. One, because it has a great riff. Two, because it <br />   goes from fast to slow to fast to slow (it is very catchy). <br />   Three, because the lyrics to this song are very well written <br />   and very catchy. And four, because it has an awesome solo <br />   somewhere in the middle. I give this song ***** stars. <br /> <br />3. FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS: Cool song but not much to talk about <br />  here. Although, the riff is pretty sweet. I give **** stars. <br /> <br />4. FADE TO BLACK: I love this song so much. Fade to Black is the <br />   ballad of this album, and a hell good one too. The lyrics are  <br />   pretty good, but it's the guitar riffs that are really <br />   amazing. The closing solo is one of the best I've ever heard. <br />   I give this song ***** Stars. <br /> <br />5. TRAPPED UNDER ICE: Nothin' much to say about this song. The <br />   guitar work is average, same with the riffs. What really gets  <br />   me is the lyrics. It talks about dying while your, well, <br />   trapped under ice. All in all, it's an alright song and <br />   deserves **** stars. <br /> <br />6. ESCAPE: Uh, this is, in my opinion, the weakest song on the <br />   album. I have tried numerous times to like it, but it just <br />   doesn't catch my attention like other songs. But hey, anything <br />   is better than that damn St. Anger crap, so i'll give it *** <br />   stars. <br /> <br />7. CREEPING DEATH: Ah, now this is a song worthy of recognition. <br />   This is where true metal is at its best. This song has the <br />   freakin' coolest riff ever! The lyrics and the vocals by James <br />   are exellent, Lars shows what he's made of by dishing out some <br />   pretty neat drumwork, and Cliff, as always, is superb on bass. <br />   This song is definatley worthy of five stars. ***** stars. <br /> <br />8. THE CALL OF KTULU: This instrumental is definately one of the <br />   best instrumentals METALLICA dishes out. The guitar sounds <br />   pretty cool in the begining, but gets better as the song  <br />   progresses. Lars does a good job on the drums in my opinion. <br />   My two favorite instrumentals are Call of KTULU, and Orion, on <br />   the Puppets album. This instrumental desrves ***** stars. <br /> <br /> <br /> If you have not yet been introduced to the world of METALLICA, then I don't really recommend this album to you. I would recommend MASTER OF PUPPETS or KILL 'EM ALL. But if you have already been exposed to the radiation of Metallica, then this album would be perfect for you. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0009A1AS2|4.0|Where does one DT fanatic start with this one...well, lets get to it.  All the songs leading up the CD's high point (Octavarium) have the best elements of DT from 'Awake' to 'Train of Thought'.  This CD is not overly 'heavy' like the last one, nor is it some prog rock epic thing like 'SFAM' or 'Six Degrees', but I think it is what DT has been meaning to make for a long time.  Critics have pounded or ignored them because they can sound 'derivative' at times in their music.  I say, what the heck, but the bottom line is whether you just like the music or not...welcome, Octavarium, with 8 songs that truly run you round the gamut of what DT can do.  Yep, that 'U2' sounding song is yes, a lot like U2, and is a great DT song nonetheless - kind of nice to hear something more commercial once in a while from them.  However, on the other side of their more 'heavy' songs, I was kind of underwhelmed - I KNOW how well these guys can 'jam' on the heavy, instrumental side, and there was very little of that evident here (check out the Budokan DVD if you have any doubts).   <br /> <br />So, my 4 stars are for the overall effort from my favorite band...the moments of brilliance far outweigh the moments of 'eh', but I guess this one just left me wanting more on some tracks that just seemed to leave me 'flat'.  This is NOT to say that I have 'given up' on DT like some other fans have implied...NO WAY.  They are gods in my book.  However, I have been here before in the days when I thought Jethro Tull could DO NO WRONG...and just check out their catalog of music lately.  Yep, not bad, but heck, time to move on.  I just hope that 'Octavarium' is not the 'Crest of a Knave' for DT...I am confident that it isn't, but let the next surprise be one with a more muscular yet less predictable opus.  I KNOW that DT is capable, so your fan-for-life is here and will wait as long as you want - just don't pull as many compromises for the FM-radio-Friendly jerk-offs (as MUCH as I want to hear you more onthe radio).  And on the tunes that you obviously are not worried about that, hey, you have done a lot better... <br /> <br />The Critic stands back (momentarily)...I am sure that JP and MP are cursing this whole review, but heck, I had to get my 2 cents in.  The bottom line is that this is the BEST DT CD since SFAM, no doubt, but there are moments that could have been truly 'honed' better to make this one the DT apex...Either way, this is one to soak up and enjoy.
B0000C23DO|5.0|The Grateful Dead has so many different facets to their music, I'd say this collection is a good beginner but far from complete. As said above, it's mostly radio friendly \\"song\\" selections and is missing some of their more musically interesting material but don't worry. Start here and just dig a little more into their other music releases to find their other gems.<br /><br />What A Long Strange Trip It's Been: The Best Of The Grateful Dead would probably be better if you just want a more varied selection of material from the band on 2 CDs.<br /><br />Some of my favorite albums:<br /><br />Anthem of the Sun (Live/Studio album)<br /><br />American Beauty (studio)<br /><br />Dead Set (Live)<br /><br />Hundred Year Haul (Live, 04-26-1972)<br /><br />Live Dead (Live)<br /><br />From the Vault Two & One (both Live)<br /><br />Workingman's Dead (studio)<br /><br />Grateful Dead (1st album release)<br /><br />Blues for Allah (studio)<br /><br />---<br /><br />My favorite era is middle 60's -> early 70's Dead but I think they have good music throughout their 30 year run with Jerry Garcia. I did see a surprise 45 min. set with Govt. Mule at The Warfield in San Francisco last year and the present Dead line-up still rocks. Even more then the last few years of Jerry in the band, early 90's.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|There is a chasm between my father and I that films don't help close...case in point...Field of dreams...end of the movie, Costner playing catch with his dad...I\\"m weeping. I call my dad and ask him if he wants to go to a baseball game...he says \\"  Well, why?  It's on Sports Channel\\".  And the when he saw the movie he said \\"  I liked it...except for the end.  How could the guy play catch with his dad.  It didn't make sense\\".<br /><br />This movie is not about a father like my father, but one that is fantastical rather than realistic and I am certain he would never get this movie.  I however believe that anyone who has felt that lack of understanding their parents will get this movie.<br /><br />I have actually avoided this movie because several of my friends didn't like it.  I don't understand it.  I think it is one of my favorite Tim Burton films...and maybe in some ways, it is the one that got away....<br /><br />I loved this movie...Ewen McGregor, Albert Finney, Jessica Lange, Crudup, and host of others...Bonham Carter, Buscemi...it is an amazing cast.  And the combination of sentimentality and stylization is perfect for Burton, who is one of our most sylistic directors.  The storytelling is incredible...fantastic, funny, awe inspiring.  This is a unique, unsung gem.<br /><br />It may not bridge the gap between all fathers and sons...but it certainly is a story well told.
B000088E6P|4.0|this is a great but 50 cent just swears alot so the clean version sucks cuz the eriting takes out a few words that arent even swears. So if u are looking for a good album get this but  just not the clean version. I by accidentaly got the clean version :( LOL anyways trust me
B0006L16N8|4.0|The kid that wrote anyone who likes coldplay is deppressive dosent know what he's talking about. coldplay is not for deppressed people, it is for people who enjoy moving, emotional music. once he hits puberty he might expand his music intrests beyond ludacris and other rappers. dont get me wrong i like rap, just when im in the mood for it. when im in a hyped up mood i put on some B.G. and p.troy but when im  trying to refelct on things and get into a chilled mood i listen to coldplay. not many songs have moved me the way clocks and the scientist have. so just because your not mature enough to enjoy coldplay dont go bashing them and calling them gay. <br /> <br />Anyway this album doesnt really has as much an effect on me as rush of blood did. if i wasnt a big fan of them i probably wouldnt have bought it. i wish they would have altered speed of sound a little to make it sound not so much like clocks. most of the songs would be at least a 6/10 or above. i was just hoping there would be an outstanding single that i couldnt get enough of like there was on rush.

6305508550|4.0|Relevant topic, great natural acting, funny, this movie has it all, almost.  My big problem is with the soundtrack.  The low-class rap garbage does not match the screen action or the themes in anyway, and only cheapens the film.
B0000CFW87|5.0|I absolutely adore this album ! Josh's voice is unbelievable and the songs are amazing with such heartfelt emotion. I also give him major props for singing in 4 different languages ! What other american singer would ever try to sing in a foreign language, let alone 3 foreign languages ? <br />I listened to this CD throughout my whole pregnancy and now my son loves it too and will stop fussing the minute I put the CD on. Pretty cool, huh :-)
0060763280|4.0|Many build you a reason for why, then show how \\"theirs\\" is the answer.No plain \\"theories\\" here, T.Harv Eker works words with actual identifable situations and solutions, including  many of his own personal faubles.If that was not enough, he  is giving away passes to one of his venues of learning and changing, (on a limited time of course).I only bought this after hearing two people who had just come from one of those huge seminars.I agree with him, where was this info when going to school? I mean, come on,do I use the public school teaching of the War of 1812 everyday?NOT. Enjoy Read it over and over,and change and grow..
B0006IIPIK|5.0|This movie is an artistic triumph. The DVD Special Features explain in detail the tremendous amount of time (over two years) and skill it took to create this unique vision of the \\"future past\\". More than any movie in recent memory, it recaptures the plot, appearance, and zany fun of 1930's science fiction serials, Hollywood \\"buddy\\" movies, science fiction pulp magazine covers, and art deco in general. Some of the background scenes are  reminiscent of paintings by Maxfield Parrish, particularly in the Shangri La sequences.     Some reviewers have criticized the acting and plot, holding them to modern standards and thereby missing the whole point...other than the technology employed, this is not intended to be a \\"modern\\" movie. Taken in its proper context as a loving recreation of the \\"golden age\\" of cinema and science fiction, the acting, plot, and dialog are exactly as they should be, and the advanced form of CGI utilized creates images that could previously have been left only to the imagination.  It is unfortunate that this project may not be fully appreciated, simply because the vast majority of movie audiences are simply too young to have any memory or emotional connection to the images and concepts that are recreated so beautifully here.     Although it may not look like anything you have ever seen before, give it a chance....relax and enjoy the ride. I think you are in for a very original, exhiliarating, and entertaining experience.
0385338686|2.0|I was quite smitten with the Shopaholic series; I didn't stumble across them until Shopaholic Gets Married and then I read the entire series in a week.   <br /> <br />The Undomestic Goddess left me bewildered.  Samantha's sudden jump from the city to the country was quite harsh and not very well coordinated.  It wasn't even believable.   <br /> <br />The book has a solid back bone but unfortunately the muscles holding it all together were weak.  Key points that could have and should have been expounded on were left open leaving the reader to go back and reread wondering what she had missed.   <br /> <br />Lastly, why wouldn't the author have shared bits of the love note that was given to Samantha?  It's Chic-Lit!  I was so disappointed!  It is like leaving out the key ingredients in a recipe. <br /> <br />If you can read this book and not get caught up in the details you will be fine. <br /> <br />
0807261785|5.0|We purchased this to listen to in the car on a recent road trip, and even though we already have the printed book and the movie, the kids were so focused on the story that they never argued or whined once! In that sense, the audiobook paid for itself several times over right there! Tim Curry is magnificent as always, presenting each character with a distinctive voice and personality, and gave a new level of entertainment to a story we were already familiar with. I recommend this audiobook highly.
0679409920|4.0|This is an uncomplicated tale of cold war espionage told with elegant simplicity by Greene.  It follows the fortunes of Maurice Castle, a British ex-diplomat working in the African section of the foreign office.  When a leak is traced to within Castle's small team, his past is drawn into focus and his ordered life comes into contact with sinister players.  Greene, who is economical in his storytelling keeps the cast of characters tight.  Although the book is clearly dated, its simplicity allows it to remain compelling to a contemporary audience.  The plot is simplistic, and this isn't one of Greene's better known novels however this is a great example of good storytelling.  Thematically, the novel concerns the nature of loyalty and the presence of wrongdoing on both sides of the cold war equation.  This is in some ways more interesting now more than thirty years on, as the sins of the cold war era become increasingly well understood.
B00064MW6K|1.0|The screenplay ultimately sinks this film. While the Catwoman mythology had promise, it never really takes off, and so we're still left wondering why Patience Phillips (played by Halle Berry) actually earns the title of Catwoman in the first place.  It might have been best to make Patience Phillips more psychologically complex--i.e. have the Catwoman transformation affect her in a supernatural, but also disturbing way (as what happened to Selina Kyle in the Batman Returns film). Alas, viewers are treated to cardboard villainry, and lifeless supporting characters. Too bad for Halle.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I have seen the \\"Phantom Of the Opera\\" twice on stage. I love the music, but found that the stage productions were missing something. I couldn't figure out what it was until I saw the movie. Gerald Butler was fantastic as the Phantom and Emma Rossum had the most incredible voice I have ever heard. The two character's meshed perfectly and the sexual tension between them was unbelieveable. At times I felt like an intruder. Hooray to Joel Schumacher for directing this movie so perfectly. The first time I saw the Phantom I slept through the first act and my husband slept through the second. This movie gets it's right. You won't want to miss a minute of it.
B0009IOR6Q|1.0|I got this movie for my birthday this year since I am a huge Johnny Depp fan (love him in 21 Jump Street, Pirates of the Carribbean, Nightmare on Elm Street-even though he died!, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory...etc) so my friend and I sat down to watch this movie and we were absolutely confused within the first thirty minutes. It made zero sense, the characters were very over the top, that girl turned into a greaser (or whatever they called them) WAYYYY to fast for someone like her, I mean I know that it's supposed to probably be just some cool and funny pointless movie but all in all, it's right up there with Napoleon Dynamite for me...lame. <br /> <br />The only reasons I gave it 1 star is because A. Johnny Depp is in it. B. They don't give you a choice lower than one and C. JOHNNY DEPP IS IN IT! <br /> <br />But overall...not one of Johnny's best and definitely not one I recommend.
B0006L16N8|1.0|Any world where the likes of Chris Martin and his completely average band Coldplay is considered genius is a world I CANNOT and WILL NOT be a part of.  The abject ordinariness is weighing me down and I must be free.  It is about time I made my return to which I came.....I am of the stars.
B0000013GT|5.0|Don't get me wrong, the other original four albums were straight up amazing. But ATLiens, OutKast's sophomore album, might be my favorite. A change in style leaves back their teenage ideas and the bluesy, jazzy beats and brings a more soulful, thoughtful, mature tone. The whole album really works as a straight beginning to end listen, because the songs can relate to one another. The production by Organized Noize is just phenomenal. I just love their style here, with the space-age beats and the whole comic book thing.<br /><br />It starts with an intro by Joi, Big Gipp's wife, that sets the pace for the album. \\"2 Dope Boyz in a Cadillac\\" is so good, Andre bashing sucker MCs over a piano and eerie singing. \\"ATLiens\\" is one of OutKast's best songs, with an awesome chorus, great music, top notch rapping (\\"Cooler than a polar bear's toenails\\"). After another smooth track, \\"Wheelz of Steel\\", the album moves into a phase of reflection and contemplation in which the songs \\"Babylon\\", \\"Decatur Psalm\\" and \\"Mainstream\\" featuring Big Gipp (my favorites on the album) and \\"Elevators\\", the most popular song of the album, are included. I like \\"Jazzy Belle\\" too, a good slow song with smart rhymes. The masterpiece finishes with a song called \\"13th Floor (Growing Old)\\" which starts out with piano and a speech by Big Rube and gives way to a smooth beat. The whole album is so good I can't put it into words.<br /><br />OutKast abandoned some of their player image from Southerplayalisticadillacmuzik on this album, but it's so good. The album is amazing lyrically and musically, and I recommend it to all because it is among the best of all time.
B000002ADT|5.0|I was exaggerating a tiny bit when I called this the \\"Best Album Ever\\", but it's the best album in the jazz world (though Coltrane's Blue Train comes close). One listen to So What proved that Miles was, besides being an innovater and great trumpet player, skilled with a melody. Freddy Freeloader does nothing but confirm that, as does the beautiful Blue In Green. At 11:35, All Blues is by far the longest track on Kind of Blue and showcases the group's enormous talent. (then again, any band with Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Bill Evans and Cannonball Adderly would be extremely talented). Last up is Flamenco Sketches, which is another fine song... if you can hear a note of it, that is. I don't mind quiet music (with the exception of soft-rock, which simply lacks substance), but Flamenco Sketches is very tough to hear. Still, it has a nice melody.<br />And to the \\"MTV Supporter\\"... Finulanu is tired of babysitting people who don't know diddly about music! (so tired, in fact, that he's referring to himself in the third person, which normally drives him up the wall). Jessica Simpson is an obnoxious parody of herself who plays pop, and 50 Cent is a rapper. Oh, one more thing... no matter what the Gangsta Rap culture may lead you to believe, being shot does NOT make you a good musician.<br />Anyway, if you like jazz, buy this! (Hell, if you like any type of music, buy this) and Milestones, also by Miles Davis. Miles made me a jazz fan, and he could very well do the same to you.
B0009KA7BS|1.0|Forgettable horror thriller that has Keanu Reeves remaking his matrix role for an even less talented director and an even worse screenplay. Keanu's performance is a worthy effort but is not very good and he's more distracting than compelling in his role. His costar Rachel Weisz does much, much more than he does in the acting department and almost redeems the entire movie with her stellar performance but she's literally the only actor who tries to be better than the horrible script that they had to work with. A script that lacks not only common sense but a sense of purpose as well. The direction is shoddy with really bad camera work in all directions and the special effects don't hold much significance.  <br /> <br />Other than a worthy and game effort on Rachel Weisz's part. The movie is not worthy of her talent or your time.  <br />
B00005B58Y|5.0|Milestones should be part of anyone's jazz collection. You'll get some of the best music money can buy here. The title track is my favorite, great catchy melody and Trane's solo. Straight No Chaser is another winner, again with a catchy melody. Two Bass Hit is also good, though I, as a bassist, wish it had two basses. Billy Boy is pretty much a seven-minute piano solo, but by a great pianist. Doctor Jackle is really fast and catchy, and Sid's Ahead is a really long song with a good solo by Miles. The alternate takes are okay, but I listen to the regulars more.<br /><br />You want Miles at his best? Buy this, Kind of Blue and 'Round About Midnight.
B0009NCQJ6|4.0|I discovered Bond when I was in Atlantic City last year and they happened to be playing near my in-laws' place.  I had read about them in a local paper and wanted to check out the music. About 10 minutes into the show, I was hooked!  Their music is fantastic and they have tremendous stage presence.  <br /> <br />This CD, Explosive, is a great representation of their hits and has a few new tracks.  In addition, the DVD side is a fabulous bonus!   <br /> <br />Please keep making your beautiful music and entertaining us with your shows!
B00063MBU8|1.0|I've had the misfortune to hear the music on this CD from a friend's cousin...good god.  They are about as punk rock as George Bush.  Overproduced, soulless, corporate garbage.   <br /> <br />Real punk is The Exploited, GBH, Crass, Misfits, Ramones, Rudimentary Peni, Conflict, Varukers, Leftover Crack, Circle Jerks, Black Flag, UK Subs, Discharge, Bad Religion, Casualties, Negative Approach, Doom, etc.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I admit I never cared much for the shows I found out Joss Whedon created. I never watch buffy, any of that other stuff. But the very first time I watched Firefly I knew it was unique and amazing. I was kind of disappointed that the man who created such a brilliant show as Firefly also created Buffy.  <br /> <br />If you don't like his other stuff, Firefly is definately a major improvement over all the rest. You won't regret the purchase.
B00005JNDZ|1.0|As other reviewers have noted, this time around the film makers have made Bridget SO inept and inane that she's just not funny. The focus is on her incredibly bad mismatch with Mark Darcy and after the second or third break-up you wish they'd just end it and get it over with. We really needed much more of Hugh Grant's Daniel Cleaver for it seems he's the only one who really seems to like Bridget this time around. But when the film takes a preposterously unrealisticturn into a Thai prison it moves from unfunny to decidedly unpleasant.

B000000H3W|5.0|1989's \\"Beneath the Remains\\" may have broken this Brazilian quartet through to the mainstream, but \\"Arise\\" was equally as important, influential, and great. And this 1991 album may (more-or-less) pick up where Sepultura left off two years ago, but Max's vocals on here are less death metal-ish than they were on \\"Beneath the Remains.\\"<br /><br />\\"Arise\\" is a true thrash metal masterpiece and it is also considered by most people (me included) to be Sepultura's last \\"pure thrash\\" disc. It is a complete tour de force for lead guitarist Andreas Kisser; his fingers must be worn down to the bone by the time he's done playing any one of these songs.<br /><br />Even though \\"Arise\\" is \\"all killer, no filler,\\" I will give a description of my favorite tracks, in case you're new to the band. The title track has blindingly fast guitar work and pounding drums, and \\"Dead Embryonic Cells\\" is the popular (and controversially named) lead single which has fiery, chugging riffs and thumping drums. \\"Desperate Cry\\" has many different parts to it, including several tempo changes and an acoustic intro. After the \\"Tarzan-esque\\" intro, \\"Altered State\\" turns to heavy churning, cascading, almost grinding riffs. A nice, long guitar solo is included, here, as well. \\"Under Siege\\" is mid-paced, with chug and churn guitars and an acoustic intro, but the next two tracks (\\"Meaningless Movements\\" and \\"Infected Voice\\") are straight-up, full speed ahead thrashers. Finally, \\"Orgasmatron\\" is a catchy Motorhead cover, and a nice homage to a Sepultura influence.<br /><br />Max, Andreas, Igor, and Paulo Jr. would later make albums that were much more experimental and a lot less heavy than this album, but \\"Arise\\" is the sound of Sepultura at their pinnacle; here's where their thrash shines brightest. Like most Sep releases, \\"Arise\\" is a masterpiece and essential listening for all metalheads.
B00004T9UF|1.0|I just dont understand why people would be supporting this crap. Thanks for ruining rap Feminem, before you we had great minds like Tupac, but now we have hobos and wifebeaters like 50 Cent and Lil Jon. See the difference? Thought you would. This is nothing more than MTV promoted crap for preteens and wiggers who want to seem cool. Vanilla Ice was bad enough, but at least he used a good beat (Under Pressure) (it was stolen, but it was still better than that gay Real Slim Shady beat). Feminem will be forgotten in a few years, and so will this poprap that him, Jay-Z, and P. Diddy created. NWA and Public Enemy stood for something, this stands for nothing besides the glorification of making money without earning it. I mean, who wants to listen to a scrawny wigger complain about his mother, wife, and life in general over and over again? Only people trying to seem cool! If Feminem is really the idol of todays youth, then I'd hate to see the world twenty years down the road...God! Eazy E must be spinning in his grave!    Rest in peace Eazy E.    Burn in hell Feminem!    Update: 7/27/05...  I had to say something to that idiot who posted a review above mine. Apparently I dont have a right to my own opinion, thats odd, because I took US history and I blatantly remember one of my rights being FREEDOM OF SPEECH. Now, I dont know if this guy is familiar with the US Constitution, but I'm guessing he lives in this country (judging by his numerous mispellings and all). I think all that guy is is a 17 year old wigger, so I really shouldn't right more, he's probably too stupid to comprehend what I'm writing. Oh, and if Amazon doesn't post this update I'll be really, really pissed...
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|If you like metal or rock you should fall in love with this CD. It isn't their heaviest album, but it is well worth the buy. I suggest you pick it up NOW if you hav'nt yet. I am a big Hardcore, Metalcore lover, and just because this isn't really that heavy, it still belongs right next to my In Flames and Slipknot albums. This is by far the best album I have picked up in 2005, and I have bought alot of CDs this year. <br />    -Metalheads Rule-
B000002N3J|5.0|I'm not a Madonna fan. Most of her movies suck (except the ones where she plays sidekick to someone else, like A League of Their Own or Desperately Seeking Susan), her dance music makes me wretch, and her tendency towards following fads annoys the bejebus out of me.<br /><br />But when she performs soft mellow songs, like the ones collected on this album from many of her past albums and soundtrack contributions, she's great.<br /><br />That's why this is the ONLY Madonna album I will not only ever own, but publically admit to owning.<br /><br />Well, OK  there are a few songs on Ray of light, which came after this album that I liked, but I don't own that album, I just illegally downloaded those few songs off Napster. (Just kidding RIAA!)
B0002IVN9W|5.0|This is not a rock album.  Go elsewhere.  This is a band that would be akin to Broken Social Scene on steroids, considering how many people and instruments weave into this tapestry.   <br /> <br />It is one of my favorites of the past year or so and I have listened to it many many times.  The instruments are fresh, and the styles of music?  Impressive.  You will hear anything from pop overtones, to late era disco, and even mo-town--sometimes within the same song.  I love the changes and variability. The lead singer and cofounder, states that he feels he is making pop music.  I disagree.  It is likeable, but so much fresher, complex, and different from what is out there now.     <br /> <br />If you have been hearing about good things coming out of Canada--it's true.  This is one of those things. Also check out Broken Social Scene, and the Stills.
B0009HLDFU|4.0|To start off this incoherant rant I'm about to go on about the Foo Fighters fifth record \\"In Your Honor\\", I'm going to tell you that this is a copy protected C.D. Now I've seen some people complain about this, about how they purchased it and it wouldn't play in certain devices or C.D. players. Well, at the top of this very page it says the record is copy protected. On the front of the case there is an easy to read sticker that says \\"this disc(s) is copy protected.\\" And here is your third(or four hundredth) comment on it. This disc is copy protected. So, if you procede and buy it and are still upset that it won't play in your iPod, well then, too bad. <br />All right. Ahem. To the topic at hand. The Foo Fighters fifth L.P., \\"In Your Honor\\" comes on the heels of the successful finicially but musically weak \\"In Your Honor\\", a record that found the Foo tired and forcing out songs that sounded like Queens of the Stone Age covering Cheap Trick. The record had a few good singles, but as a whole was probably the weakest Foo record to date, the only one that I wouldn't recomend to other peeps. <br />Well, I'm very happy to report that \\"In YOur Honor\\" is, for lack of a better phrase, a return to form. Spread over two discs, which the sticker accuratly tells you has one loud, the other not so loud, \\"In Your Honor\\" could have been, should have been, an overindulgant affair instead is probably the tightiest Foo record. By seperating the two extremes of the Foo sounds, they actually make two of their most consistant records to date. And they're both availble in one package! <br />Disc one, which I'm gonna call LOUD for time purposes, sounds like Queens of the Stone Age covering Cheap Trick(sort of) only this time it doesn't feel forced. So in other words, it sounds like a slightly heavier version \\"There Is Nothing Left to Lose\\", and it showcases some of the Foo's best songs. \\"In Your Honor\\" is the perfect track to open the disc. It sets the tone and pace perfectly. A melodic, loud arena rock song written by one of the best in modern music at doing so(while on the subject, I hereby ask that people quit bringing up Nirvana and Kurt Cobain. I think it's safe to say that over the past decade Grohl has written more than his share of good songs, and far more then he should need to for people to quit saying \\"he ai'nt as good as Cobain\\" or whatever nonesense people conjure up.) The record keeps up the pace over the next seven songs, with melodic hard rock tracks like \\"DOA\\", \\"Hell\\", and \\"No Way Back\\", to more low key but no less good tracks like the lead off single \\"Best of You\\" or \\"The Last Song\\". The last few songs on the disc are slower, less overdrive driven, but they never feel forced or put upon. They set the feel for the second disc. <br />Disc two, hereby called QUIET for time purposes, is the true shift, but not as radical a one as people might think. Anyone has ever heard an acoustic take of a Foo song understands that Foo songs sound just as good acoustically as they do electric. The songs are pretty breezy, light and pretty void of overproduction. Hell, they even team up with Norah Jones on the excellent \\"Virgina Moon\\", and it doesn't sound out of place at all. This is not an insult. The record is calming, ecspecially in the wake of LOUD. The songs are strong, and it's kind of cool to hear Taylor Hawkins sing lead on a Foo track. <br />What keeps the two discs moving out of overindulgant territory is that Grohl, Hawkins, bassist extraordinare Nate Mendel and guitarist Chris Shifflet have written their strongest set of songs since 1997's \\"The Colour and the Shape\\"(though 1999's \\"There Is Nothing Left to Lose\\" was more than stellar). The group sounds as tight as they ever have, and the hooks are as strong as they ever have been. There isn't a weak moment on the whole record, even if not every song in great. <br />And lest you worry, \\"In Your Honor\\" isn't really all that long. Each disc runs about forty minutes long, and unlike many other two disc sets, you don't have to listen to both discs back yo back. There is no overriding theme, and each disc is so different that it may actually be best not to listen to both back to back. <br />Phew. So there ya go. The new Foo record ranks as one of their best thus far and is an excellent addition to their catalog. If you're a fan of the Foo and were dissapointed by \\"One by One\\", all is cool. They're good again.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|I can't wax poetic about how wonderfully artistically and technically this film is - but as a layperson I can tell that it is so.  While I have to admit that there's a definite common thread to Miyazaki's movies' themes, this is yet another one of his works that has effortlessly blown me away.<br /><br />Casual Film Buff's Verdict: Breathtaking, with a degree of depth often lacking in America's popular cinema
B00097DX3U|4.0|A great runnerup to the debut album. Powerful, smooth, sand-paperish, and laden with riffs. The current face of rock is devoid of riff-arrangements and licks which one can hear in this album.  <br />Traces of Pearl Jam and Whitesnake are audible if one listens closely.  <br />I have a feeling that this is their second-last album.
B000000OAN|5.0|To your hardcore Queen fan this album will have been played so many times the songs have ultimately lost their original impact.  But every fan will agree, musically this is their finest. <br /> <br />  From start to finish your attention is never diverted, never broken from the flawless musical exellence of 4 special people who did indeed set out to produce \\"...our Sergent Pepper album\\".  Freddie's Death on Two Legs/Lazing On A Sunday Afternoon/Seaside Rendezous/Love of My Life and Bohemion Rhapsody provide the album's sence of excitment and twist from the norm, then again...name a Queen album where Freddie doen't do that!  Brian May provides us with the hard rocking power riffs that'll have any fan thrashing a tennis racket air guitar style with enough experimentation to set queen apart from bands such as Led Zep and The Who etc.  John Deacon's shameless ability to write songs of the most beautiful caliber is present on this album as once again he provides queen with the down to earth touch of class album fillers which are as good, if not better musically, than the albums highlights.  And last but not least Roger Taylor's frowning ultimate rock god style song splashes the album with a much needed norm to tame the apocolyptic combination of all 4 members. <br /> <br />This album should be in everyone's collection, even half-arsed Queen fans who posses only greatest hits. <br /> <br />They went on to do bigger and better things as the album's went by...but never have they done something so perfectly and flawlessly constructed as 'A Night At The Opera'. <br /> <br />It has perfection written all over it...and the sleeve design's pretty sweet too!
B0000214F0|4.0|This film is worth seeing once to see what all the controversy was about.  When I finished it, I was struck by how the excellent historical narrative was bound together with explicit sex scenes, so I had to research the making of the film.  It seems the \\"real actors\\" who played the main roles would only do R-rated scenes, so a bunch of porn actors were hired as filler, and you can see the delination.  Sometimes you'll have McDowell, O'Toole, Mirren and the other \\"serious actors\\" doing an excellent scene, while in the background there is some completely unrelated and distracting hardcore sex going on.  The main storyline was broken up with sex scene interludes, and I found myself wishing they would get back to the story.<br /><br />My husband is a history buff, so we just used the sex scenes to discuss the action in the rest of the film, and for him to give me history lessons on how well the story of Caligula relates to the historical record.  As it turns out, the \\"serious acting\\" part is a great movie, one of the best and most cinematically riveting history movies I've seen.<br /><br />I think anyone looking for pornography is going to be disappointed by the history part, and people wanting to see a movie about real life that is stranger than fiction are going to be disappointed that it keeps getting broken up with graphic sex scenes.  Watch this movie once to see for yourself.<br /><br />I liked the history part enough that we checked out the BBC series \\"I, Claudius\\" next, but the acting in that is wooden and very slow.  It doesn't compare to the terrific acting in Caligula.
B00005B4GU|1.0|Look, I could probably type up a \\"smart\\" review here, full of big words describing my disdain for this record, complex sentances and deep down thoughts and all that other stuff, but it's not my style and I don't think this record warrents that much thought.<br /><br />Radiohead's \\"Amnesiac\\" is crap crappity crap crap crap. It is one unpleasant, forty five minute keyboard hum accented by a couple of \\"Smiths-esque\\"(I know the Smiths, and this ai'nt what they sound like)guitar lines and Thom \\"I Never Found A Song Lyric I Didn't Like To Mumble\\" Yorke, well, mubmling over the top of it all about, uhm, sad stuff. It's garbage. It's a record whose sole intention is to make the people who like it feel cool and hip, and the people who don't like it feel stupid.<br /><br />Well I'm not stupid, or at least not THAT stupid. Some people will have you believe that just because a record is quote-unquote dense and should be listened to on headphones that makes it good. Sure, sometimes, like Radiohead's \\"OK COmputer\\" or even, to a lesser extent, the pretty good \\"Kid A\\". That is, when there's something there. Here? Nothing. Just a bunch of people fiddling with keyboards.<br /><br />I used to dig Radiohead(\\"The Bends\\" up until \\"Kid A\\", so the arguement that I just don't get it doesn't cut it friends) but after this record I approach everything they release with more caution then I do then pretty much any other band. If you had even a slight ability to hear and think then I believe that you too will despise this piece of garbage.<br /><br />On the goodside, I like the line \\"I'm a reasonable man get off my case.\\" Cool line that one.
B0001XAS1M|4.0|The song \\"Bat out of Hell\\" is the reason I am able to listen to songs that are over 3 or 4 minutes long. I grabbed this album out of my Dad's tapes (come on, it said hell on the cover, it had to be good) when I was 11 or so. I didn't quite expect what I got, but in the end I fell in love with this album. <br /> <br />I'm not much of a fan of Meatloaf's later work, though it still carries an epic feel with it, but this album really showcases his energy. Whether it is a blistering rock song or a ballad, raging youth is captured in this album. The music is 70's epic without falling into the pitfalls of prog rock (Emerson, Lake and Palmer, Yes, etc.). Not that Meatloaf's music is prog, it is definitely straightforward rocking rock music.  <br /> <br />There is no better song in the world to sing than \\"Dashboard\\", so buy this album just so you don't look like a fool at karaoke when you don't know the words. And yes, you need to know both the male and female vocals for that song. It's a must. So, pick up this album and listen to it late one summer night. Yeah, this album is definitely perfect for a cool summer evening when you can recall the wonderful terrors of a youth gone by.
B00005O5CM|5.0|This movie is a great blonde and pink comedy for everyone with a pink soul. The movie contains a great laugh out loud comedy with a big sense of fashion! Robert Luketic sure know a pink, blonde fashion when he sees one! This movie can prove blondes are truely not dumb, nut it sure does prove the we have a sense in fashion thank's to Reese Witherspoon! It's a great comedy! And that's all I have to say!
0671799320|5.0|Daniel Yergin's readily understood book belies his background.  After all, he heads Cambridge Energy Research Associates, a think tank that sells \\"guidances\\" for $5000 per copy.  Unlike the audience for those reports, this book has a feel that appeals to anyone who wants to read narrative history.  He mixes several elements in his book.  First, there are a series of personality profiles around famous oil personalities.  They go back as far as Standard Oil and the Rockefeller family.  There are also some interesting dramas -- oil rushes in Western Pennsyvania, the Six Days War in the Middle East, the last days of World War II.<br /><br />This book changed my understanding of what oil means to warfare.  Oil is speed.  That makes the difference in the oceans and in the deserts.  Winston Churchill saw this in the years prior to WWI when he sought funding for more naval research into oil powered ships.  That paid off for England handsomely in both WWI and II.  Rommel and the German effort may have failed for the absence of oil.  Yergin describes the efforts of the Germans to develop synthetic oil and the inability to continue their blitzkrieg strategy without oil.  Same thing for the Japanese.  One of my favorite parts was reading about the efforts by the Japanese to make oil from tree extracts in lieu of petroleum.<br /><br />This book won the Pulitzer Prize in the early 90s.  It stops just prior to the First Gulf War.  The photographs inserted between the text add a lot to the book as well.
B000002MY3|3.0|Alanis Morissette has been singing for a long time this album is the highlight in her career. However, an overrated album in my opinion. Don't be fooled by the sales (28 million copies sold, the only album that beated it is Shania Twains 'Come on over'). Some of the sales might be spectaculair, some of the songs certainly are not.   The opener, 'All I really want' is a moderate track on the album but it does not show what the album is truly like. 'You oughta know' is close to being the best track on the album, but it is beaten by 'Ironic' in my opinion. However, 'You oughta know' shows more what the album is like, while 'Ironic' stands alone. 'Perfect' and 'Right through you' are lyrically interesting(well, their message is) but they are nothing special; nothing to dragg about. 'Right through you' even gets annoying because it is hard to find the tune. 'Hand in my pocket' is my album favorite but her voice almost seems cheap, like anyone could fake it, although that's an illussion of course. 'Forgiven' has a powerfull message but the music is sometimes painfull to listen to. 'You learn' has it's moments but sometimes you want to turn it off. Her voice is good but it is not capable of doing everything it wants, or everything that this album requires it to do.   'Head over feet' is one of the 2 tracks that bring piece in Alanis voice. Finally a break from some of the songs before. When the tune is great, this song does have the cheeziest lyrics on the album but it's still very good. 'Mary Jane' takes full profits of 'Head over feet'. In 'Head over feet' Alanis voice seemed in place but this one is just painfull to hear sometimes. 'Ironic' is the best song on the album and the reason I bought this album. Don't know whether to thank this song or be angry at it but it's just a very good track. As I said before, this song stands alone. Nothing on this album quite matches it, unfortunatly. 'Not the doctor' is a nice follow up after 'Ironic' and the track that is most Ironic-a-like. This track is very calm Alanis voice is in balance.     Overal this album is overrated to me as I said before. This album doesn't quite do the trick with me and if you are going to buy it because of 'Ironic' you are going to make a big mistake. The same mistake I made. However, you will make an even bigger mistake if you never heard anything from her and you wanna follow the other 28 million album buyers. Alanis voice is raw and I doubt the fact you will like it if you never heard it. And another piece of advice, take it if you want; do not buy this album if you want backgroundmusic. Or music when cleaning the house. You will have to force yourself to turn it off and you will have wasted your money. Buy this album if you have a lot of money left or recieved a lot of money and you want to just buy some albums to check them out, or when you like artists that have something to say even when the artists voice doesn't always make it succesfully through one or more of the album's songs.     The last and final thing I will say about this album is that titles like 'The best album ever' and 'The best debut album ever', 'The best female album ever' simply don't suit this album in my opinion ---    Rick - 2005
B000000OQY|5.0|This really is a great CD. I would put it ahead of all of their other records but Appetite. The acoustic songs are amazing and Axl sings like only he can. Slash's solos are eloquent and melodic, while the rest of the band plays a smooth, fat rythm. It's a great album.
B0008KLVG4|5.0|When Steven Spielberg finished making the smash hit action film DUEL, he began venturing to make another film, scarier, more exciting, and, as well, a money maker. Recently, there was a book written by Peter Benchley called JAWS. Somebody handed it to him, Spielberg read it, and he was interested in making a movie out of it. And that's what he did.<BR>     JAWS: The Movie is simply amazing. Scary, exciting, and overall, enjoyable. If those of you like seeing the monster every five seconds, go look at Godzilla, but this rocks. So what if you see the shark for only about half an hour of the movie? (The movie's two hours long.) This movie absolutely R-O-C-K-S. If you have a movie collection BUY THIS SHOW. IF YOU MISS OUT ON IT, SOMEBODY WILL GET YOU.
B0007Y08QA|1.0|The Machinist is a retarded rip off of Flight Club and American Pshyco. The movie was boring up until the unexciting climax. Christian Bale shouldnt have wasted his time with this film or losing the weight for it. He is LUCKY he isnt type casted yet into making these types of films because this movie sucked so bad nobody is going to like it.
1932100385|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book because the statements were backed up with specific studies.  He explained in detail how the misinformation regarding animal protein products has been perpetuated by the dairy and meat industries.  We have been led to believe that these foods are good for us, when actually they cause many of the diseases that plague Americans.  If readers take this information to heart and act on it, it can be lifesaving, making huge improvements in a person's health.  <br /> <br />
B000004286|5.0|This soundtrack instantly made me a fan of James Horner.  He starts with a powerfull love theme and interwines it into most of the music throughout the movie.  None of the music felt overdone or stiff and gave a deep, personal view into the main character.  THe main title is one of my favorites due to its mystery and subtle flow in melody.  Another great piece is the secret wedding becuase its the peak of the most beautifull and powerfull song in the movie.  This piece is used in earlier tracks, such as gift of a thistle and wallace courts murron, but definitely is at its best in a full and dramatic orchestra piece taht is secret wedding.  This piece allows the listener to understand the depth of love wallace feels for murron as well as the sense of desperation and anger he feels when they are torn apart.   <br /> <br />My favorite piece in the film is definitely For the Love of a Princess becuase it covers a crucial moment in the movie as well as has a lyrical quality that alot of the pieces don't.  It uses part of the wedding song but leads into the theme for the princess who has wallace's child.  This piece alone is wonderfully done and when put to the movie it's very moving.  I love the use of the harp in all of the love themes including this one becuase it gives the music the historic base needed to support a film like Braveheart. <br /> <br />\\"'Freedom'\\" is probably the most recognizable piece in the score, if any of them are really recognizable.  It certainly fit the scene of death and victory very well and can bring the audience to tears by itself.   <br /> <br />All in all, this cd is very enjoyable but is definitely better if you are a fan of the movie.
B000063S6Z|4.0|I've been listening to several CDs I've borrowed from a friend at work. One of them is Moby's 18. Moby is I guess one of the big electronic music artists these days. This type of music is not necessarily my default music style, but I decided to give it a shot.<br /><br />Surprisingly, I liked listening to the album, and found I'd actually heard several of the tracks before. \\" We Are All Made of Stars\\" and \\"Extreme Ways\\" are pretty good stand-out tracks off of the album, but there are other good ones as well. On the whole, the music is sombre, introspective, thoughtful...not necessarily big dance tracks. Pretty good, well worth the occasional listen.
B000002H97|1.0|For me Metallica was great till Master of Puppets. Just great. Not the best or a reference. \\"Ride the Lightning\\" is their best record. \\"The Black Album\\" was only the start of this past metal band as one of most famous pop bands! Pop music, pop clips, pop look. Well, to bad to be true! Today they are more in another pop variation called... numetal. Well, let's cry from the true age (80's), time of the true underground, and remember the rare exception that still practice the old stuff. If you're into pop and disco, buy it, if your into metal FORGET IT (what I've done)!!!
B0006L16N8|3.0|This one has a few more rockin' songs than \\"Rush\\" or \\"Parachutes\\"; still it reeks of typical navel-gazing self importance. <br />My main problem with Coldplay is that all of their albums sound the same. You could play it in any order and it would make no difference.  All the songs are perfectly servicable and good, but I hear no actual innovation or even a real joy to their sound. The lyrics aren't melodramatic enough to catch my attention.  <br />The constant comparisons to U2 are completely unfounded. U2 sounds alive and brash, not middle of the road <br />I guess I like this album and I can really respect the artistic integrity of Coldplay, but I hope next time they can show us something really different
B00007BH5C|5.0|This soundtrack is magnificent and fits the LORT epic scale perfectly.  The Rohan theme inspires the views of grand mountain peaks and serene fields as well as a deep sense of duty and pain that the rulers of the city must cope with.  Whenever Sam and Frodo appeared, the sweet melody from the Shire was there to comfort and remind us that the purpose for the journey was to save all that was good.  Evenstar is quite possibly the saddest piece in all of the LOTR soundtracks, as it is used to tell the painfull story of Arwen's lost love and the sacrifice of eternal pain that she is willing to bear. The vocals in this soundtrack are absolutely stunning and are the single reason I'm such a fan of LOTR music.  Howard Shore did a wonderful job capturing the spirit of the story within each moment of the movie.  Every scene required his pieces to show the audience what was being experienced on screen.  A beautiful yet dark example of soundtracks at their best.
B00018D44U|3.0|Another CD I've had on loan recently is Norah Jones' Feels Like Home, her second effort. I have to say, I find her voice nice enough, but the music on the CD hasn't been particularly gripping. The single \\"Sunrise\\" is the only track I recognize, and it's stuck with me, but that could just as easily be because it's the first track on the disc. I hate to say it, but I think other folks will make a more lasting impact, unles NJ learns to put more of her soul into the songs, and the recording...this just lacked emotional impact.
B0002SA51O|1.0|Parents Beware! Although Stargate SG-1 is advertised as \\"NR\\" or \\"Not Rated\\", in fact, Episode One is rated - rated R for a scene of nudity. We purchased Seasons 1-7 for our family viewing and were shocked to find this out the hard way. We got no further then the first episode so we don't know if any other episodes are rated.
B00080ZHFK|2.0|I have been wanting to see this film since this past Christmas, 2004.  I finally saw it last night and was very disappointed.  I cannot believe this movie got nominated in the \\"Best Picture\\" category at the Academy Awards.  I can understand why \\"Million Dollar Baby\\" won, and I haven't even seen THAT movie. <br /> <br />I found this film, as a whole, weird.  Some of the soundtrack music was annoying, and reminded me of some of the music from \\"Bugsy,\\" Warren Beatty's early 1990s film.  It was just eery, strange, or downright annoying. <br /> <br />Leonardo DiCaprio is a fine actor, but he doesn't look anything like Howard Hughes.  Not that it really matters.  In my opinion, this film is a turkey.  I wish I could say I liked it, but I did not like it at all. <br />
B00006IR5S|5.0|This soundtrack is beautiful and wonderful to listen to whether you've watched the movie or not.  Every song has a mood of its own and will absolutely sweep you off your feet! <br /> <br />This cd is a great addition to any soundtrack collection not only becuase of the brilliant John Williams but becuase of the essence of the pieces.  Most songs can stand alone especially Fawkes the Phoenix.  It's also fascinating to listen for the themes from the first movie that are sometimes not so subtlely incorporated into the music.  The character themes are also very believable and worth listening to especially if you didn't pay too close attention to the movie. <br /> <br />Another thing I've noticed about this soundtrack is that, unlike many others I own, this one is very easy to listen to all the way through without being bombarded with random battle themes and overdone effect songs.  Really a great cd for anyone!
B00008PC2O|2.0|I bought this specifically for the HD disc 2 in wmv. <br /> <br />What they don't tell you is even though it is in wmv format, you can only play it in the oh so craptacular interactual dvd player software that you must install. <br /> <br />wmv and you can't play it in windows media player. Go figure. <br /> <br />Classic case of piracy paranoia infringing on the consumer's right to play his purchase using the player of his choice. <br /> <br />BOO
0689842449|3.0|I think this book is fine, but not for the preschool crowd.  I would use it with older children -- elementary age -- to discuss the life cycle of an annual, the role of the seasons, and the challenges of reproduction which must be overcome by all plants.  The Tiny Seed introduces us to many of the hazards faced by seeds and seedlings as they attempt to grow (from falling in water and drowning, being eaten by birds or mice, being overshadowed by large weeds, being stepped on by children, and more) and shows how the ideal environment is a necessity.  It covers the role of sunshine and rain, how the seed swells and bursts open, how the plant develops as it grows, and how it produces and disperses its seeds to carry on the next generation.  It's not a book for small children, though, since its mostly non-fiction tone is dry, the phrases are stilted, and it doesn't read aloud well.  I find it difficult to \\"cheer on\\" the tiny seed; where others see him as a hero facing difficult odds, I think the book is too grimly determined to be educational and becomes boring for the youngest child.  If you want a book to introduce a unit on seed dispersal, this is the one.  If you want to talk with your three year old about the cycle of the seasons, you'd be better off with the Spring/Summer/Autumn/Winter collection by Gerda Muller.
B0000AMJED|1.0|I don't really even need to write anything about this movie because the word \\"Horrible\\" describes it. I mean, you haven't seen bad movies until you've seen this. None of the lame jokes are funny, you know what's going to happen before watching it, the chases are stupid because you already know who's going to win and the movie is SO HORRID THAT THEY HAVE TO SHOW YOU AWESOME CARS. Think about it, after you see the cars, you'll be like, oh, those cars are awesome and therefore you forget about the movie. The plot is so awfu and predictable and the acting is awful. It's cheesy and is probably one of the worse movies ever. Enough said. I wouldn't even get payed to own this or see it again and if I ever see a copy again, I'll probably set it on fire.
038551123X|5.0|I was very wary of reading this book because I just didn't see how Jeff Lindsay could make a serial killer sympathetic; I wasn't interested in a main character who was unappealing, not to mention evil.  Well, no worries on that front.  Dexter Morgan is not someone you'd want to be friends with, yet I found myself feeling an incredible amount of compassion towards this 'monster.'  There are many more extensive reviews, so if you want details they're easy to find. I'll just say -- 'Dexter' is well worth a couple hours of your time.   <br /> <br />I've read that this line of books is being developed for a series on 'Showtime' so it looks as though I might have to subscribe.  I really  hope James Marsters  will be looked at  for the part (he used to play Spike on 'Buffy.')  The whole time I was reading this book, he is the person I kept picturing in my head as Dex.  He's one of the few actors around who I know could make us appreciate Dexter Morgan as both a monster and a tragically damaged human being.
B0009I7O7U|5.0|John Legend had to be good because it would seem downright idiotic to have a stage name with the word Legend in it. His album is truly one of those albums that you start with track one and listen straight to the end. Then because you felt so good you do it all over again. My favorite tracks are the whole CD. You litterally can't pick one track above the all. His vocal talent is phenomenal and he is a wonderful escape from all the other cookie-cut R&B that's out right now. Oh, if you love this album try your best to find his live album Solo Sessions Live at the Knitting Factory.
B0009KA7BS|4.0|Not that Reeves is a great actor...never was, probably never will be...but he does get parts in movies that I dont mind owning...if i'm gonna buy a dvd its gonna be something that I dont watch once every year or so. <br /> <br />But what I really cant believe is that no catholic groups have been screaming bloody murder about the inverted cross shaped shotgun on the cover...I dont remember if the movie poster had the same thing.
B00082IJ08|4.0|2D, Noodle, Murdoc, and Russel are back, and (according to their press release), several of them have gone insane, all of them have discovered dark pasts, and their Essex studio has been infested with zombies.  The only question I have is this: If their studio is haunted, how'd they persuade the choir and string sections to show up for recording, not to mention the string of celebrities and fellow artists who have cameos on the album?    As has been mentioned by many, 'Demon Days' is much darker than the previous Gorillaz album.  It's also much more sparse, lacking some of the sheer groove of the last album, as well as a lot of the instrumentation styles.  This is a much more hip-hop inspired album, with rap influences (and rappers) showing up much more frequently than the varying styles of the last outing (which even included Cuban singer Ibrahim Ferrer).  Much of this can be attributed to the change of producers between albums, from Dan 'the Automator' Nakamura to Danger Mouse.    Danger Mouse does a fair job on the whole, getting the songs through several difficult transitions between incongruous sections.  The problems appear when you compare Mouse's work to Nakamura's; 'Demon Days' seems to be simultaneously sparse and cluttered, with a thinner sound but many more instruments.  The songs would be bleak enough with Nakamura's excellent production; with Danger Mouse's there are some serious issues.    The music itself has its clear ups and downs.  It's immediately obvious which songs will make good singles and which should have been left on the cutting room floor.  The former, such as \\"Dirty Harry\\", \\"DARE\\" and the already-released \\"Feel Good, Inc.\\" are good, if not quite as fresh as last time's.  'DARE' is also an obvious stand-out, with its eclectic mix of 80's dance pop and tribal wails, and 'Dirty Harry' sounds like a definitive club opener, despite an overextended rap bridge.    Then there are the low points; 'White Light', which is a boring rehash of the song placed directly before it ('All Alone'), 'Every Planet We Reach is Dead', which drowns out Ike Turner's good piano work with lots of obnoxious noise, and especially 'Fire Coming Out of the Monkey's Head', Dennis Hopper's spoken word contribution.  'Monkey's Head' is a fairy-tale/parable which is simply poorly written as well as a terrible attempt at a metaphor.  Hopper's performance doesn't help much either.    The best song on the album is actually two: 'Don't Get Lost in Heaven' and 'Demon Days' are practically the same track, as one fades into the other.  'Don't Get Lost in Heaven' is a bouncy-sounding track with a Beach Boys rhythm, slightly distorted piano and guitar and jarringly discordant lyrics.  The album's title track, however, is far superior to anything else there, flawlessly combining a beautiful melancholic string arrangement, reggae influences, a gospel choir and (for perhaps the first time in Gorillaz history) meaningful lyrics.  One wishes the rest of the album were consistent with this final tune.
B0009KA7BS|1.0|Super stupid Keanu Reeves monster movie that is so bad, I'm waiting for it to come on Mystery Science Theater 3000. Keanu is at his worse with this film and it shows on his face that even he thinks the movie is bad. Out of the entire cast, Only Rachel Weisz(Runaway Jury) and Peter Stourmar(Bad Boys 2) give credible performances that are way better than the movie itself. Rachel Weisz does more with her part than the screenwriters and the director did with making the movie and gives the film an unnecessary great performance that a way better movie could have used instead and Peter Stourmar gives class and dignity to an underwritten role that is only in the movie for about five minutes.     See it for Rachel Weisz and Peter Stourmar ONLY, because the rest of the film is really bad.
1577311523|5.0|There is a lot of wisdom int his book that showed me so much about myself, how I view what happens in my life, and how to set about to change what goes on in my mind so that what goes on in my life doesn't get to me like it used to.  <br /> <br />I learned a lot about watching my thoughts, and how the ever changing circumstances that go on around me do not have to have a negative impact on my emotional system. I can view things in a new perspective, and then, I can see things more clearly which will only bring me more inner peace.  <br /> <br />I have to give a big credit to the author for showing me how to stay in the now, and how to remove the clutter in my mind, so that I can be free of the emotional baggage in my life.  <br /> <br />I learned a lot from reading and taking in what I learned, which is why I say this is a MUST READ book.  <br />
6305320802|4.0|I've enjoyed this classic Rodgers and Hammerstein musical film since I first saw it at the Coronet Theatre in San Francisco back in 1956. It was the first film in Todd AO which was 70mm film projected on a big, wide, curved screen, sort of like Cinerama but only using one camera and one projector. The film ran at 30 frames per second instead of the normal 24 frames per second for a steadier, higher resolution picture. It was simultaneously shot in 35mm CinemaScope for showing in regular theaters. This DVD is from the larger film gauge negative, considered the better version, but Fox has apparently crammed the whole 145 minute movie plus a trailer onto a single layered DVD disk which means a relatively low bit rate and digital artifacts. It's also a letterboxed rather than a (superior) anamorphic release.My Laserdisc, made from the same transfer actually looks better than the DVD. The good news is Fox is working on a greatly improved Special Edition for probable release in late 2005 with special features on the film and the Todd AO process. With the superb work Fox has been doing on it's DVDs recently, I would think the new DVD would be well worth the wait. If you can't wait, the current release is still pretty good, especially compared to the horrible prior pan and scan VHS tape releases. It's definitely a great musical and I'm still in love with Shirley Jones (the perfect Laurie) just as I was back in 1956!

0743487478|5.0|I loved this book for multiple reasons.  Kohn supports his ideas by referring to a rich and diverse scientific literature.  Beautifully written, the book is accessible and honors the reader by assuming intelligence.  Kohn doesn't offer annoying how-tos but a framework for thinking about our goals and objectives in rearing children.  I particularly enjoyed his articulation of the parenting aim to help children pay attention to the needs (and happiness) of others and not just focus solely on the child's happiness.  Kohn's reasoning is not moralistic but humanistic: the ability to read others' cues and pay attention to the needs and happiness of others promotes harmonious relationships (the pathway to true happiness).
B0001I55SS|2.0|I was really young when I first saw The Black Hole. As I remembered I loved the film. Well, being 31 years old now and watching again many years later, I'd have to say that this film is really bad. Poor quality, bad acting and V.I.N.CENT is so damned annoying you want to take that tin can and a roll of duct tape and wrap him up in it so you don't have to hear his really bad one liners. <br /> <br />And Maximillian, you gotta be afraid of his paper shredder hands. So damned comical.  <br /> <br />When I was young, I thought that the visual effect of the black hole looked cool. But even way back when the movie was made the theory of the black hole is that it could not be seen. Well, it's bright as day in this movie. But I suppose the had to display it movie purposes. <br /> <br />The special effects in this movie were obviously some sort of bad after thought because there was no detail to them whatsoever. The laser blasts are aweful and the robots move stiffly if they come across anything that isn't a flat surface they'd topple over. <br /> <br />Anyways, poor film, poor acting, poor special effects and really not worth your time. <br /> <br />
B0007M22TI|5.0|I saw this program on PBS and thought it was magnificant.  The <br />DVD was just as good as the program that I had seen.  I'm sure <br />that I will spend many hours playing the DVD.  Even if I'm not <br />watching, the music is wonderful to listen to while you are doing <br />other things. I cannot imagine anyone who loves music not <br />enjoying these talented women.  It was well worth the purchase.
B0002KPIQY|5.0|As a movie fan who has seen thousands of them since 1954, I only need to say one thing about this movie. In it, Angelina Jolie gives the best performance I've ever seen by a woman on screen. I can't think of a better reason to watch a movie. The specific details of the movie end up being irrelevant. What will stay with you is the impressions left by Carangi, as brought to life, and death, by Jolie. That is why I return to this movie every year or so - to see an actress inhabit a role in ways that words cannot describe, and which has yet to be equalled in my experience.
B000089CJI|3.0|I got this album about 2 summers ago when it first came out after hearing \\"Such Great Heights\\" and after having it for a solid 2 years, I can say that this is at best just average. It's not horrible, nor is it excellent, just so-so.     It is however very creative and mellow. The overall tone of the album is somewhat ambient with fuzzy little electronics and soft vocals. It's just that some songs just aren't very grabbing, and another thing, the lyrics are a little cheesy in some songs, and the singing is dreadful.    Key tracks: \\"The District Sleeps Alone Tonight\\"/\\"Such Great Heights\\"/\\"Sleeping In\\"/\\"We Will Become Silhouettes/\\"This Place is a Prison\\"/\\"Brand New Colony\\"/\\"Natural Anthem\\"
B00005ATQF|5.0|Nearly everyone was impressed with the brilliant theater of the first half, starring a sadistic institutional drill sergeant.  However many did not like the ensuing unfocused & surreal Vietnam episode. The visual & verbal images I will retain forever are mostly from the first half.  However Kubrick couldn't just end with the assassination of the sergeant - the film's scope would have been too narrow & it would have seemed unsatisfactory. We had to wind down in a sick & crazy war in Vietnam.  This front-loaded film worked for me in its entirety.
B00005JNJT|5.0|Where to start? This is so good and blast cool a movie! Ra's Al Ghul and Scarecrow are #s 2 and 10 in my top 10 favorite Bat-foes, but more than that, Christian Bale is the second best Batman next to Micheal Keaton! The scariness was at a perfect level, all the fight scenes were made like a rich cake, there were so many good and memorable lines, and I just gotta say it! Batman Begins rules the world of DC comics! Except for Batman and Batman Returns, of course. And so, I've done my review. See Batman Begins. You WON'T regret it.
B0002B55WA|3.0|The \\"digitally remastered\\" (audio, I presume) DVD is sorely in need of visual and colorization upgrade also after 30+ years; what little artistic merit the film has to offer the die-hard Beatles fan or the merely curious is now fading into time and obscurity.
B00006690G|5.0|This album is one of the best I've ever had! Here's my rating for all of the songs. By the way, Eminem is my favorite rapper, too.  <br /> <br />1. Curtains Up 1/10 Just a stupid introduction. Pleah. <br /> <br />2. White America 9/10 Funny and catchy lyrics, and a terrific tune. <br /> <br />3. Buisness 8/10 Thought up well, and a great joke on Batman.  <br /> <br />4. Cleanin' Out My Closet 7/10 A powerful song full of rage. Yow. <br /> <br />5. Square Dance 5/10 Not a bad song, but not one of my favorites. <br /> <br />6. The Kiss 6/10 Pretty good for a skit, but a mite too short. <br /> <br />7. Soldier 7/10 A great, merciless song with nasty rhymes. <br /> <br />8. Say Goodbye Hollywood 5/10 A warped view of Eminem's life. <br /> <br />9. Drips 4/10 The lyrics are good, but the tune needs changing. <br /> <br />10. Without Me 10/10 My favorite song on the album. Just perfect. <br /> <br />11. Paul 6/10 Not bad, but needs a little bit of improvment <br /> <br />12. Sing For The Moment 9/10 A song showing what Em's got to go through in his life in a way only he can tell. Lots of swears. <br /> <br />13. Superman 8/10 A cool song showing Eminem's scorn for women. <br /> <br />14. Halie's Song 9/10 A sweet song, an ode to his daughter that also shows Eminem's true, caring, and good person side. <br /> <br />15. Steve Berman 3/10 I can't even remember this dumb skit. <br /> <br />16. When The Music Stops 10/10 An awesome song. Nuff Said. <br /> <br />17. Say What You Say 10/10 Em and Dre mock their past and gang. <br /> <br />18. Till I Collapse 10/10 A song in which Em shows his feelings. <br /> <br />19. My Dad's Gone Crazy 2/10 An insult to Em and his daughter. <br /> <br />20. Curtains Close 3/10 A bad ending to an excellent album. Puh. <br /> <br />Overall it is a wonderful CD, and the second best Eminem album next to the well-known Encore. I recommend it to all Eminem fans.
B0007Y08IS|5.0|Team America - World Police (Uncensored and Unrated Special Collector's Edition)~ Trey Parker is a splendid movie and a brilliant work of satire. It attacks the smug attitude of Hollywood, Broadway, and with songs like \\"I am so ronery\\" and the pearl harbor song which totally slammed the movied and the acting ability of Ben Affleck. The movie pulls no punshes and offends both democrats and republicans equally and is quite explicit both in terms of crude language and sexually with the sex scene with the puppets. Trey Parker and Matt Stone are brilliant and this piece of work is right up their with Swift when it comes to biting satire and is one of the best movies in the last decade. I loved it and I will see it again.
0790730960|5.0|God, this movie's a classic. Once again Micheal Keaton is a great Batman, and Catwoman, played by Michelle Pheffier, is a gorgeous and fiesty woman, especially in costume. Penguin, of course, is a villain who is everything a villain should be, and he has a funny way of fighting and talking, too. Max Schrek I think is okay, but he was real weak when the big test came. Anyway, this is the best of the good Batman sequels, and I think all who like comic book related movies should see it whenever they can. And as many times as they want.
078401213X|5.0|Pi is a beautiful movie about the mind, and what can happen if you try to hard. The lead character practically blows his own mind trying to figure the stock market. If math is your thing you have to see this movie. If knowledge is your thing, you also have to see this movie.
0790731002|4.0|This is a good movie. I liked it. It was cool yet funny. Here's how it goes, as from beginning to end, from the opening to end credits. <br /> <br />Batman(Val Kilmer)is looking for a villain by the name of Two Face (Tommy Lee Jones)He's terrorizing Gotham, and Batman tries to stop him. This is the beginning of the movie, so naturally Two Face gets away. Soon, we move to a scientist named Edward Nigma(Jim Carrey)He is smart, but also crazy. Soon, he is fired. But he won't take this at all. He kills his boss, and becomes a tricky, question asking villain called the Riddler. Soon, he and Two Face meet each other. They team up, because they both want Batman. Meanwhile, Bruce Wayne has found himself a lady(played by Nicole Kidman)and they are in love. Soon, Two Face and Riddler get to a circus, where among the performers are a boy named Dick Grayson and his family, who do this for fun and for a job. Two Face kills Grayson's family, and what's worse, Bruce Wayne has no time to turn into Batman to stop him and Riddler from escaping. Now, Dick is on his own, very angry and rambunctious. He wants revenge on Two Face, and soon meets up with Batman. He wants to join him, but Bats doesn't because he doesn't want Dick to throw his life away. Soon, however, Batman does team up with Dick, who calls himself Robin. They find Two Face and Riddler holding the same lady Bruce Wayne fell in love with captive, hoping for the Batman to come. They get their wish. A fight ensues, and for a moment, it seems that the villains have won for once. But Batman makes a comeback, and he rescues his lady as well as Robin, who had been captured during the battle despite fighting very well. As for the bad guys, Two Face is tricked, and he falls into the river, and he dies as we see the last of his hand sink into the water. Riddler, on the other hand, is taken into custody, but he does not seem to care due to the fact he is insane and thinks on top of that that \\"he's Batman.\\" Batman kisses his love, and the movie ends. Now, here are all the pros and cons of this Bat film. <br /> <br />Pros: <br /> <br />The fight scenes are great <br /> <br />There are a lot of memorable quotes, funny and cool <br /> <br />Nicole Kidman is SO SEXXXXXXXXXYYYYYYY!! ROOOOOWWWWR! <br /> <br />There is much emotion, feeling, will and determination  <br /> <br />Cons: <br /> <br />It's not nearly as dark/full of evil as Batman, Returns, & Begins <br /> <br />Two Face is a bit out of control, jumping about and being funny rather than scary, not to mention sweet rather than menacing <br /> <br />Riddler, albeit insane in the comics, is WAY over the top here <br /> <br />Robin is somewhat, if not VERY, annoying  <br /> <br />Anyway, this film is not as good as Batman 1, 2, or 5, but it still is a worthwhile movie which you should see if you like the DC comic book character known as either Bruce Wayne or Batman.
B0009KA7BS|1.0|Questionable adaptation of the comic book Hellblazer has of all the people Keanu Reeves playing the role of supernatural misfit John Constantine who is trying to save the world from a conspiracy to bring fourth the son of Satan, who is trying to enter the earth. The huge problem that this film has is of course Keanu Reeves, who is miscast to the point of the film becoming a joke and the screenplay is way too incoherent to understand most of the things that are happening in the film. The lackluster dialog seem more like a USA cable film that a real movie that was releases in the theaters and the special effects don't hold any ground what so ever and they get repetitive after a while, losing most of it's attended impact along the way.  Some of the other actors in the film don't even seem to care about their performances with the excerption of Rachel Weisz, whose game and way too good for this type of film performance does more for the film than it should have. She actually makes you care and understand her character and makes her a real three dimensional person who you would have liked know more about and follow instead of the tissue paper dimensional character of John Constantine and his fellow lackeys. Another actor who does way more than he should have is Djimon Hounsou and he does not have enough screen time to make a better impact as well as Peter Stormare, who great interpretation of the King of Darkness is just in the movie for about four minutes. <br /> <br />IF you want to see it, see it for the game performance of Rachel Weisz, Djimon Hounsou and Peter Stormare because other than their performances, there is really nothing here to see. <br /> <br />
B0000BWVCM|5.0|This movie was superb! It is even better than the first, I must admit, and the fights were as cool as they come. I was especially happy to be introduced to new characters, like Pyro, Iceman, Lady Deathstrike, and Colossus. These guys are some of my favorites. And  don't forget that there was plenty of blood and some sex in this film, perfect for anyone who wants a mature and good movie. I do wonder if X3 will top it. Whether it does or not, I'll own this hit blockbuster until I'm in my grave! And I'm only nearly 18. Period.
B000002JS8|5.0|Great Cd one of my favorite ac/dc cd's.Lets start with the tracks: <br />          1.Highway to Hell- Great song 5/5 <br />          2.Girls Got Rhythm- Great to tap your foot to 5/5 <br />          3.Walk all over you- Nice Chourus 4/5 <br />          4.Touch to Much- Amazing 5/5 <br />          5.Beating around the Bush-great rapid fire song 4/5 <br />          6.Shot down in Flames-Good guitar solo 3/5 <br />          7.Get it Hot- Worst on Cd, Skip it 1/5 <br />          8.If you want blood ( youve got it)- Fantastic riff   <br />            5/5 <br />          9.Love Hungry Man- good bass, bad song 2/5 <br />         10.Night Prowler- Good album closer 5/5 <br /> <br /> Pros- Bon's voice sounds great,Angus Young at his best,nice blues touch to it. <br /> <br /> Cons- Loe hungry man and Get it Hot <br /> <br />Great for ac/dc fans, go out and buy it right now! <br />I give it a 5/5 <br /> <br />
B00005JLXE|5.0|This, is like, one of the best movies I've ever seen! It absolutely kicks butt! My order for character liking is as follows: Bullseye, the coolest and nastiest Daredevil villain ever with an amazing way of using anything as a weapon, Daredevil, the blind hero who is the  protagonist of this movie, Kingpin, the big boss man of all crime who looks really fat but is actually solid muscle and very strong, and Elektra, who is one of the hottest babes I've ever seen, and for someone who wasn't treated right as a fighter left quite a mark on the movie. Oh, there's Ben Urich. He's pathetic and the worst of all characters in the whole movie. Whatever, other than him, this movie is solid gold. It got a lot of respect, but not as much as it deserves. All who are interested in any or all of these characters should see this movie. Oh, and remember \\"That's the C-Train!\\"? Classic.
B00005O3VC|4.0|I loved this movie the first time I saw it.It was possibly one of the funniest movies I've ever seen.The only letdown was the ending ..........what a stupid ending. The special features were all garbage. I recommend getting the VHS copy of this. Still a very good movie though.
B00005JKWJ|4.0|This is a film I loved watching. Very well acted and designed, and the vampires rocked. Blade himself did a lot of funny and intense stuff, too. I thought the vampiress he became friends with was hot.  Oh, and the final fight with Reaper(who is my # 3 favorite Blade villain next to Deacon Frost and Dracula)was as good as they're gonna get. The only thing that could have made this movie better is  if it had the scariness and pumped vigor of the first one. Other than that, it is splendid, and I think any Blade fan should see it.
B000A88EV4|5.0|Can't believe it's finally out on DVD! One of my favorite films of the 90s.  <br /> <br />Special features include: <br /> <br />* commentary track featuring Leigh and actors David Thewlis and Katrin Cartlidge <br /> <br />* introduction from Neil LaBute <br /> <br />* episode from the BBC programme \\"The Conversation\\"  <br /> <br />* trailer
B00005JKCH|5.0|This is among the greatest movies I've ever seen in my life, and I have seen quite a few! Spider-Man is my second favorite comic book character of all time topped only by Tigra, the Were-Woman. Since she is female, that means Spider-Man is my favorite male comic book character. It was wonderful having the Green Goblin in this movie. He is my # 1 favorite Spidey villain. For good reason. His wondrous performance in this movie rocked my world like never before. The acting was perfect, and so was the special effects and the stunts. Oh, and Mary Jane was just as beautiful as she should have been. Go Spidey! Go Goblin! Go MJ! Oh, and Harry Osborn was pretty funny, in a loose sense of course. Aunt May was absolutely hilarious. Anyway, this movie is as good as they get with the exception of Spidey 2. It's worth every penny.
B0002KPHXS|4.0|The film \\"Intermezzo\\" is old. I purchased it and watched it again after almost 45 years.  The music and story are as good as I remember from teenage years.  The most impressive part of the film is the beautiful music (Intermezzo) around which the story is built.  If you don't mind the limitations of 1939 film making, you will enjoy this.
0790729652|5.0|This is as good as Batman films come. The others were great, but this one was spectacular. Joker was in this movie. He is my # 1 favorite Bat-villain of all time, just as Green Goblin is my # 1 favorite Spidey-foe. Oh yeah, back to Batman! Micheal Keaton was a cool actor, as was Jack Nicholson. This film was both action packed and funny. The part where the lady threw water in Joker's face? Don't even get me started on how good that was. And boy, this movie really lives up to the expectations of the comic. Get my drift?
B00005JNSK|5.0|Took my 6 and a half year old boy to see this film this afternoon, he thought it was the tops and well worth postponing a trip to the beach even though he may not have understood everything (the story was a bit unstitched at times)and he loaths chocolate. I thought it was great, I'm an excessive consumer of CGI and any other special effets and love well composed pictures of any sort so it was a treat. <br />Wonka is a bit of a non-event, a sort of sterilised Pirate of the Caribbean - Jackson mix-up, though the pop-music and dancing are done very succesfully by the incredible Oolah-lupahs (or whatever they are called). <br />As soon as it's available, I will buy it on DVD to ensure my 19 month old son will get the opportunity to see it (he was sound asleep through most of the show today)along with the Wizard of Oz, James and the Giant Peach and the Polar Express (promised for November I believe). We have recommended the film to my not easy to movie-please wife so the boys and a few of their mates will probably get another look at it in the coming days. <br />So, see it, you can always go to the beach another day (or afterwards if you go to the matinee). <br />Michael & Howard (6 1/2)
0780624890|5.0|What a film, what a film, what a film! It is stellar and amazing. And boy, Deacon Frost and Blade both really know how to fight! I think there was a lot of funniness and intense action and battle in this movie, and I think it should be in the top 10 comic book films of all time. If it is, good. I thought Karen was cute, too. And Quinn was funny, while Mercury was vicious and brave. End of story.
B000002G60|5.0|This was Suzanne Vega's second album produced by Mitchell Froom. There is a great variation in moods and styles and Froom obviously has a great skill of giving  Vega's songs inventive arrangements without ruining them with over-production.<br /><br />This album is a natural follow-up the very experimental album \\"99.9 F\\" which had a lot of odd sounds and rhythms. You find quite a lot of the same things here, but the overall impression is that of a softer and more refined album.<br /><br />What make Suzanne Vega's albums so good is the songs and her soft voice; what makes her albums great is the  perfectionism in which the songs are arranged and produced. Both elements are present on this album, which may very well turn out to be her most satisfying and enduring.<br /><br />A handful of these songs would have fitted nicely into \\"99.9 F\\";  \\"Birthday\\", \\"Stockings\\", \\"Casual Match\\", \\"No Cheap Thrill\\" and \\"Lolita\\" . Among them my favourites are \\"Stockings\\", with great sensual lyrics, \\"No Cheap Thrill\\" and the almost heavy \\"Birthday\\".<br /><br />On other tracks a more refined touch is apparent. \\"Caramel\\" is a latin-inspired great tune with a tasteful hornarrangement. \\"My favourite Plum\\" is another memorable song with a beautiful string arrangement. \\"World Before Columbus\\" are \\"Honeymoon Suite\\" two acoustic songs with Vega playing the guitar. I particularly like the thought-provoking lyrics of \\"Honeymoon Suite\\".<br /><br />\\"Headshots\\" is another favourite.<br /><br />Least appealing are the jazzy track \\"Tombstone\\" and the riff-based \\"Casual Match\\" and \\"Lolita\\"
B00003CX8J|5.0|Well, this is an awesome movie. Many of my favorite characters are in it, like Wolverine and Magneto, my two favorite characters in the X-Men universe, and it is greatly well done and made quite good too. Oh, and you should have seen the fight scenes and humorous moments. They were out of this world all the way to Uranus! Okay, nuff said! Buy this movie and enjoy, fellow X-Men lovers!
B0001NBMBC|1.0|Slipknot is horrible poser music and their way too mainstream anyways...Slipknot's  \\"vol 3: (the subliminal verses)\\" is  not only gay but boring and sounds worse then listining to a rap song. I think all rap music & nu-metal is al the same garbage... Don't waste your money on bullsh*t like this but insted? Listing to some good guttural  deathmetal !
0930289234|5.0|By any standard, not merely by the standard of comics, WATCHMEN is a masterpiece.  Although for decades many individuals had been taking comics seriously, Alan Moore managed in a single blow to explode every assumption anyone had made about the potential of the genre.  In the world of the novel, it would have been as if the most ambitious novel ever written had been TREASURE ISLAND and the next thing to appear had been WAR AND PEACE.  Moore created a tale whose ambition outstripped anything that had ever before appeared in the world of the comic, and he executed it, with the brilliant assistance of illustrator Dave Gibbons and colorist John Higgins, with a brilliance and virtuosity hitherto unknown.  With WATCHMEN, the graphic novel had come of age, and many believe that even to this day it remains unsurpassed.<br /><br />They say the devil is in the details, and what makes WATCHMENT brilliant is as much the details as the main elements.  There are sections of the novel where Moore will be juggling several strands of the story at once, some crucial to the tale as a whole, others symbolic embellishment, and yet there is nary a moment when everything is less than perfect.  Even if one has read a host of other graphic novels, there are numerous points in this book where one has to just halt and say to oneself, \\"Comics just aren't supposed to be this good.\\"<br /><br />Essentially, WATCHMEN is about a plot to socially reengineer a better society.  That this is the story is only gradually revealed.  In fact, the book is nearly complete when the plot fully emerges.  Along the way we are introduced to a completely new and exceedingly compelling group of super heroes.  There is Rorschach, a singularly dedicated crime fighter whose mask hides an almost comically ugly visage.  There is Nite Owl, the second person to sport that identity, and the super intelligent Ozymandias.  Then there is The Comedian, who is less a funny guy as someone who realizes that the whole shebang is one big joke.  Above all, there is the blue-bodied Dr. Manhattan, the only one of the bunch with genuine super powers, but powers so excessive to make Superman seem a wimp, since he has the capacity by sheer willpower alter the physical reality around him (in a fight between the Man of Steel and Manhattan, the latter need only will everything to change to kryptonite), someone in fact more godlike than anything.<br /><br />The novel is also extraordinary for the entire world Moore imagines.  Because with Dr. Manhattan's help he was able to bring about victory in Vietnam, Richard Nixon repealed the amendment preventing anyone serving as present for more than two terms, and has continued to serve as president well into the 1980s.  With Dr. Manhattan tilting the balance of power sharply towards the United States, for whom he serves, the Soviets have had to acquiesce in all foreign policy matters.  But when he disappears, the Russians begin driving through Afghanistan and into Pakistan (an area of the world still very much in the news).  Nuclear war threatens.  No description I can make of the novel can do justice to its richness and complexity.  But this at least, I hope, gives some hint of the way that WATCHMEN strives for a narrative richness previously not seen in the comic genre.<br /><br />My one complaint with the book is in the ending.  I find it as unsatisfying as the ending of one of the greatest Sci-fi novels ever written, THE HUMANOIDS.  But while one might quibble with the desirability of the end, one can't argue that this isn't a brilliantly conceived and executed work of art.  It truly and legitimately stands as one of the great artistic achievements of recent decades.<br /><br />There have been over the years frequent attempts to bring WATCHMEN to the silver screen.  I personally think this would be a dreadful mistake.  There is simply too much content in the novel for a 120-minute or even 180-minute film to do justice to it.  Director and erstwhile cartoonist for Monty Python Terry Gilliam once indicated that he would love to do it as a twelve-part mini-series, and I think that would be absolutely perfect.  One of the things that makes WATCHMEN so brilliant is the rich detail contained within it--such as the brilliant pirate comic contained with the novel as a whole--and I think that cutting all that detail out, which a feature film would necessitate, would be a tragic mistake.  A twelve-part mini-series on, say, HBO, would result in around 660 minutes in contrast with the at-most 180 minutes of a film.<br /><br />The degree to which WATCHMEN has come to be perceived as one of the pinnacles of the graphic novel can be seen in an episode from the first season of THE O.C.  Seth, the comic/alt music geek on the show (whose taste in both areas are, by the way, tres cool, cognizant of Frank Miller, Alan Moore, The Shins, and Modest Mouse) tries to educate his later-to-be-girlfriend Summer on the modern comic, and suggests that she start with WATCHMEN, THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS, and the Sandman series.  And when he creates a Starter-Set for contemporary culture, he includes WATCHMEN along with an album by the Shins and Michael Chabon's THE AMAZING ADVENTURES OF KAVALIER AND CLAY.  You know, I think he gets it right.nist for Monty Python Terry Gilliam once indicated that he would love to do it as a twelve-part mini-series, and I think that would be absolutely perfect.

One which offers the movie GANDHI the utmost respect and one which it is rightfully due.<br /><br />I am continually forced to cringe at the most pathetic efforts which contain voices which all sound the same, translations which offer no measure of intellectual respect for a work of art such as this.<br /><br />I am pleased to recommend this to any Spanish speaker unconditionally.<br /><br />ESPA&Ntilde;OL:<br /><br />Despues de haber visto esta pelicula en su lengua original en el 1982, siempre he querido compartir esta pelicula con mis mayores que no poseen la sofisticacion suficiente en el ingles para apreciar los puntos finos de esta pelicula.<br /><br />Tambien despues de haber de tener que sufrir con una multitud de ediciones deplorables de traducciones en espa&ntilde;ol de otras peliculas originalmente en la lengua inglesa, debo comentar que esta es probablemente la edicion mas fina en mi memoria de una obra semejante.

B00005JNSK|3.0|In the last two weeks, I have seen three different versions of CHARLIE & THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY; the two feature films and one youth play.  All three are based on the popular book and all three put their own spin on the clever tale.  The new version reunites long-time work pals Tim Burton and Johnny Depp.  The previews would make you believe that the 2005 remake is way overdone with computer imagery and overacting.  However, in some cases, the opposite is true.  The new computerized graphics are not overly distracting and feed the chocolate frenzy well.  It's Johnny Depp that, surprisingly, seems low-key for a character that has been presented in a much more bizarre way than when Gene Wilder filled Wonka's hat.  His reactions often don't feel like they are in direct response to the events that are taking place.  Many times, I felt like I was watching the dress rehearsal, as opposed to the final film.  That said, the movie leaves you with primarily the same feeling that you get if you were to just throw the 1971 version into your DVD player.  Both have elements that are amusing, and they both have elements that are odd.  The only real difference is that the 2005 version tries to stick closer to the original book, but then breaks free whenever it becomes too much of a shadow of the previous film.  You won't be disappointed by the new version, but chances are, you won't be overwhelmed either.  If I were to pick one as better than the other, I think I would have to go for Gene Wilder's more carefree presentation over Johnny's cynical approach.
B0009KA7BS|4.0|Okay,    There are clearly a large number of Keanue anti-fans out there. That said, I actually liked this movie. Not as much as the first Matrix, but more than the second & third!    The storyline and the effects were good, and the supporting actors/actresses were great -- notably, Weisz, Gabriel, and Lucifer. I thought the final conflict involving Reeves, Weisz, Gabriel & Lucifer was top-notch. The resolution was also very creative. I agree there were a few \\"rough edges,\\" but if you can suppress your inner-critic for a couple of hours, you can enjoy this film.
B00018TI5E|5.0|Like many others, I'm a big fan of Mr. Frusciante's work with the Chili Peppers, from Mother's Milk to By The Way.  His contributions to all of the Chili Peppers' albums is magnanimous--from his highly melodic guitar work to his incredible backing vocals and everything in between.  It goes without saying that the Peppers got lucky when they discovered Frusciante.<br /><br />Like the aforementioned reviewer, I had the albums \\"To Record for Water for Only Ten Days,\\" this album, and \\"The Will to Death.\\"  I casually listened to the previous two, and listened to \\"The Will to Death\\" here on Amazon, and decided to get the album.  It is a very impressive album musically.  Then I went back and really listened to \\"Shadows,\\" and found myself blown away by the mad-art mastery of John Frusciante.  After reading one of the previous reviews that blasted this album for Frusicante's use of samples, loops, various vocal effects, and interesting Line 6 Guitar effects such as an arpeggiator, I had to respond.  There are many groups that use such effects uselessly and wastefully, but every modulation/synth effect that John uses on this album, every instrument has a distinct purpose--it all fits.  To me, this album is so poignantly experiemental that I would like to consider it a modern-day \\"Pet Sounds.\\"  I really believe that Frusciante has the mad-art mastermind of a Brian Wilson (minus the intricate vocal harmony composing).  To me, it goes without saying that this is Frusicante's best solo album ever.  Lyrically, he expresses some of the deepest emotional experiences ever, and musically, the album is a wall of potently beautiful music.  One can only postulate what kind of artistic electrochemical neurosynaptic charges go through the brilliant cerebral muscle of John Frusciante.  I also recommend a listen through of \\"The Will to Death.\\"
B000002KON|5.0|This is a gem that cannot be readily found in your neighborhood record shop, if you can find any Kinks albums at all, you'll probably come across \\"Come Dancing\\" or \\"Village Green\\" or maybe \\"Something Else\\"; but \\"Arthur\\" is something you have to work for, and it pays off more than half the other albums out there by The Kinks or Stones, Beatles etc., etc.. Released around the same time as \\"Tommy\\", \\"Arthur\\" is one heck of a study on the types of characters that inhabit Ray Davies' world, but aside from the pop crafting and endearing thoughts, The whole band swings, rocks and rolls, pops and knocks yur socks off. Dave Davies especially shines here. After \\"Something Else\\" and \\"Village Green..\\", we had come to know Dave as a player in the George Harrison vein: Rocking, but also deft and melodic, with more emphasis on the latter. On \\"Arthur\\", Dave comes with full force: He solos! He plucks! He stops on a dime, keeps time, and is in his prime! It becomes more of a clinic for Dave, and shows signs of the hard edge that The Kinks would incorporate with \\"Lola V. Powerman...\\". Buy this album, please.
B00005JNJT|5.0|I saw this movie and all I can say is that it rocked out loud this is what Batman should have looked like the fist time Batman came out back in 1989. I have seen all the Batman films and I like most of them but this out is the best one yet the movie is dark and has that comic book feel to it and it made Batman cool agin.The movie has a lot of Action and heart to it but thge story falls short and the villains are not ALL that but still it's one of the beast films of 2005 and I can't wait of it to come out on DVD.So if you're a comic book fan or a batman fan or just someone looking for a good movie then GO SEE THIS MOVIE  you will not be desapointed trust me.
B0008GNJZY|5.0|This is a very inspiring movie with a great message. It is very realistic and good for most audiences. I would definitely recommend it.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|michael buble has a seemless way of taking great hits and making them better in a very good jazzy way. his debut album was awesome and its time is even better. a definite buy if you like michael buble and jazz. the only problem i have is that i wish buble would write more of his own music. his one self-written song \\"home\\" is awesome so i hope hell do more of that on his next album.
B000002UA0|5.0|This is the first Pink Floyd, and this release in particular is what seperates the regular fan from the \\"die hard\\" fan. I've heard almost equal doses of praise and criticism for the Syd Barrett era, and I just let it be what it is, Pink Floyd, as they sounded in 1967. There was such a flurry of creativity from Barrett, but he just fizzled out, went into semi-retirement, then disappeared completely. I hope, as one person thinking of another, he's feeling better now. I won't harp on his problems; He has had enough to last a lifetime, without more people to beat up on him.<br /><br />The record is dated, yes, when listening, you don't hear state-of-the-art, but you do hear what sold people on them in the first place. Barrett's songs straddle a fence, they are either charming, childlike poems set to music, nice little \\"songs,\\" or deep, intense experiments in sound and word pictures. Even though \\"Interstellar Overdrive\\" is a group composition, this is a good example of this point, it's an extended jam, two uninterrupted performances played entirely independent from each other, with the beginning and ending cut out of one, and the remaining segment overdubbed onto the the other complete performance. So you hear the band playing coherently, then it becomes all disjointed, goes all over the place, and comes back to the opening theme, with that crash landing of an ending, which segues into Barrett's funny little song, \\"The Gnome.\\" Two completely different sides of what the band was about, but played with equal conviction.<br /><br />Roger Waters Was credited with co-writing two compositions, along with one of his own, and in an interview Nick Mason gave a TV journalist (This interview is included on the VHS tape \\"The Dark Side\\"), they all concede that it isn't a great song, but he of course went on to become a terrific songwriter. \\"Take Up Thy Stethoscope And Walk\\" is fast and choppy, naive lyrics, somewhat off-key singing, and very ameteurish. But does have a  high degree of energy, and it fits the premise of the Floyd's debut.<br /><br />From the first stirrings of \\"Astronomy Domine\\" to the last jumble of sounds on \\"Bike,\\" it is good, entertaining music; just remember, it's very old music, but a good document to its time.t fits the premise of the Floyd's debut.

B000088E6D|5.0|michael buble is one of the best singers i have ever heard. period. to those haters of the buble out there i will say this: michael buble is a better singer than frank sinatra. i know i may have a lot of eneimies out there but the truth hurts. that truth is that he is a better singer. this is a great collection of covers of awesome songs when they were originally made and buble makes them his own way and surprisingly better. a definite buy.
B000003S09|5.0|This piece of history is truly like a meteor; it appears out of nowhere, burns brightly, causes people to notice, then is gone. In many ways, there was only one real King Crimson  line-up; this one. The shame is, it burned out so quickly, but this is a brilliant record from a truly meteoric band. The first thing to get the consumer's attention is the cover; Godber's painting is one of the most horrific images to ever grace a record's front cover. The cartoonish quality is all that keeps someone from screaming at the sight of it.<br /><br />The first impression one gets when listening to this is, \\"What IS this?\\" The insane fury of \\"21st Century Schizoid Man\\" is almost unrivaled, the furious percussion, the free-form jazz in the middle (subtitled \\"Mirrors\\"), the tight, Zappa-like part that breaks this roller-coaster ride up, and that heavily distorted voice, which sounds technically awful, is just right in this case. With ugly images of death and torture in the lyrics, a \\"normal\\" voice would've been anti-climactic.The ending is about as close to an in-the-studio explosion as I've ever heard. Now stop, and catch your breath.<br /><br />This leads to \\"I Talk To The Wind,\\" soft, poetic, a nice breather after the opening work-out. A nice touch is Greg Lake's double-tracked vocal, he sings perfect overdubbed two-part harmony with himself, about being alone; the only thing to hear one's words, the wind, carries them away, and even it doesn't hear.<br /><br />\\"Epitaph\\" is my personal favorite on this disc. The mellotron is the instrument par excellence on this piece. The morbid imagery in the lyrics conjure up large tombstones, morning fog, life's meaning, if it has one, and fear of the unknown. The instrumental, titled \\"March For No Reason\\", is slow, somber, plodding, and downright chilling. By the time you get to the ending segment, the subtitle \\"Tomorrow And Tomorrow\\" starts to make sense, the last line of the refrain repeating into infinity, as the music keeps getting heavier and deeper, tympani accentuating the truly Gothic sound, swirling around the room, until you are transported to another dimension.<br /><br />After a few moments of silence, the opening bars of \\"Moonchild (The Dream)\\" part the air, ever so gently, a delicate beauty hanging ghost-like, suspended as the moon in the night sky. The absence of a bass on this song, I think, makes the sound more complete, it hovers in the air as intended, where a solid bottom end in the sound, would anchor it, ruining the effect. Interesting is the effect of Greg Lake's cupping his hands around his mouth to make that hollow sound that gives the vocal that special touch I feel is needed here. Part Two of \\"Moonchild\\" is called \\"The Illusion,\\" a long rambling bit of improv, that is widely criticized for being \\"too long.\\" When you consider that the band was running short of usable material during the recording process, and use a little imagination while listening, this part becomes just right. It is reminiscent of the moon's journey through the sky, in the dead of night, quiet, slowly progressing toward the first ray of morning sunlight. No, it's not too long, it's just right.<br /><br />This set ends with the title track, \\"In The Court Of The Crimson King.\\" This is the real hit from this collection, the lyrics telling of Medieval days, the King's Court, but with a supernatural element, frightening images conjured up with references to the \\"Fire Witch,\\" and the like. The first instrumental is subtitled \\"Return Of The Fire Witch,\\" a delicate passage featuring a light solo on flute, and you'll see that this is a showpiece for Ian McDonald. \\"Dance Of The Puppets\\" is a sparse flutelike arrangement played on keyboard, but McDonald plays organ, piano, mellotron, flute, and clarinet, as well as anything else I may have missed, along with Fripp's guitars, Giles' drums and percussion, and Lake's bass, as well as Lake and Giles singing two-part harmony throughout. I should mention here, that eventhough Pete Sinfield doesn't play any instruments, his lyrics earned him a place in the ranks of the band. The false ending is an interesting touch, someone not knowing any better would reach for the \\"off\\" button, but wait; \\"Dance Of The Puppets\\" teases you into knowing it isn't over, and then the Coda comes in, loud, heavy, a Grand Finale, and then \\"Whoosh!\\"; It's over. Just like that.<br /><br />And, with that, you have just experienced one of rock's greatest moments, to the tune of forty-some odd minutes of a band that shortly after, broke up for good. Sure, Robert Fripp released many King Crimson records, but only one with the original line-up.nstruments, his lyrics earned him a place in the ranks of the band.

B0000AQVCL|4.0|jet sounds like a finely tuned 70s band that has taken pieces from some of the greatest rock bands ever and put them together. AC/DC is one of the most kick-a$$ bands ever and people should love it if theres a new band that sounds like new AC/DC music. i dont understand how critics (otherwise known as idiots) can blast this album for being too much like these great bands. every band out there has done it, even the critics' darlings such as radiohead and the arcade fire. screw the critics, this is a very good cd and a definite buy.
B00005PJ8O|3.0|\\"Patton\\" although fun to watch because of his portrayal by George C. Scott just does not have the look or feel on World War 2.  First I will mention something about Scott's portrayal of Patton; he is too fat and his voice too deep for the real Patton.  If someone ever has the opportunity to listen to a recording of George S. Patton's voice you'll be struck about how effeminate it sounds.  Of course Scott's waste line also does no justice to the tall and trim Patton but that can be overlooked.  What is hard to overlook is that the film looks too much like the Spanish army on maneuvers than a World War II battle.<br /><br />Then there are the numerous historical inaccuracies in the film.  The most notable one is where Patton greets Montgomery in Messina.  Didn't happen!  Well I could go on.  For accuracy I would place \\"Tora, Tora , Tora\\" above Patton.  For fun I'd chose \\"Patton.\\"  But do not use this film as a source for a Master's Thesis.
B00097A5I6|4.0|\\"dont believe the truth\\" is not part of oasis' downward spiral, it is the album that puts them back on the radar as one of the greatest rock bands in the world. with this album it feels like oasis was never on a very long hiatus to the world of music. lyla and let there be love are definitely the two best songs on the album but all of the songs are very good. a definite buy if you are an oasis fan. 4.5 stars.
B000002RXS|5.0|While I am not myself a devout Maria Callas fan, I do enjoy some roles which she uniquely interpreted and dramatically brought to life in a way that no one in her time was doing. She raised the bar high for all subsequent sopranos after the 60's(offically the decade she could not really sing with the bravura that made her famous). No opera lover can avoid hearing about her in any record store or opera house. She is the subject of discussion by the most hardcore opera connoisseurs. I genuinely enjoy Callas in following role: Norma (her absolute best and the role she sung the most number of times making her the owner of the role really) Medea (an intensely passionate Greek-fire role that she called upon her ancestry to interpet) La Sonnambula's Amina (beautifully moving role) and Tosca (brilliantly dramatic and passionate. As Carmen, however, she is only so-so. I think that this recording should not be anyone's first Carmen. This is a Carmen of an acquired taste, and moreover, a Carmen enjoyed strictly by Callas afficionados. I don't mean to put Callas down, as an artist she had integrity and commitment despite her perfectionism and diva antics. Her French diction is slurred and not elegant or even effectively dramatic. She is singing the French a la Italian opera, she struggles in the last word \\"fear\\" in her confrontation with Don Jose at the end of the last act - \\"I was warned you'd come here, I was even told to fear for my life but I'm brave and I am not afraid...she has an odd tremble at the word fear. The Habanera is not suited for her voice, neither is the Segudilla or her erotic dance and song for Don Jose -\\"Je vais danser en votre honeur\\". As Carmen, she comes off as too mature, too controlled and even too conservative. Carmen is young, wild, liberal, rebellious, defiant, dramatic. An older woman could never interpret Carmen as well as a younger one. Callas should have deigned to sing the role on stage early in her career and recorded it while she was still inher prime. Even if Carmen is out of a soprano's repertoire, Callas should have showed off her versatility by singing it anyways like so many sopranos did after her - Leontyne Price sang Carmen, Beverly Sills even sang Carmen in the 50's when she was still an obscure singer, and most recently soprano Angela Gheorghiu sung Carmen. My favorite Carmen on record and stage - Grace Bumbry. She's the best. <br /> <br />Callas fans will enjoy her in a role that was even too rare for her, and a role she loathed. It's interesting to notice how even a role she wouldn't do on stage (she called it vulgar) she sounds brilliant and very into the part. She is an older Carmen in this recording made in the 60's. Tenor Nicolai Gedda is doing a terrific job as Don Jose. He plays the role well, coloring his normally lyric voice to suit the darker character full of jealousy and possession of Carmen. They sound great together and there is tension between them right from the start. This was Callas' last recording, and again that makes this recording valuable. The next time Callas sung was in a series of farewell concerts, including one terrible one in Japan, and then she was gone forever. But her legacy lives on in dozens of recordings, especially under EMI, with whom she had an extensive contract.
0790733226|5.0|This film is a thought-provoking mixture of science and spirituality from the brilliant mind of the late Carl Sagan. Even more amazing is that it remains so engaging without the typical bug-eyed monsters that populate science fiction. <br /> <br />The \\"human reaction\\" to the series of unfolding extraordinary events is vividly portrayed, and is so reflective of our modern world. A blitz of media here, a special committee there, a glory seeker, a powerful manipulator, and even a terrorist all appear in this picture - it has them all. <br /> <br />The script is very well done, and one of my favorite lines points out how humans are not only capable of beautiful dreams, but also of horrible nightmares as well.  <br /> <br />The film mentions that the bottom line is that we do not live in a world that is fair, but for this picture the bottom line is that it - including the performance of the wonderful cast - is an extremely fine piece of work from top to bottom.
B0000004V2|5.0|maybe this album was the most influential album of the 90's decade, and maybe the first real alternative rock album, this album takes the best of all times music and mixed in a few fantastic songs...from the Past of Beatles to The Smiths, From the future of The Pixies to Radiohead... <br /> <br />BYE BYE BADMAN
B000819PKC|5.0|It seems like Jamiroquai makes its progression in groups of 2. Just as Emergency and Return were in the acid vein and Travelling and Synkronized are funky dance/discoteque, this album reminds me a lot of Funk Odyssey, listen to the first 3 opening tracks of each and you'll see the similarity in feel. But just because it's similar to the last album doesn't mean that its a rehash. This album is excellent, as if we've come to expect anything less from J.K., and for me the most instantly addictive. A lot of the musical texturing in this album reflects some of the things he may have been experimenting with in Odyssey. Some of the bass lines are excellent too, at a first listen I thought that perhaps the rumors of Stuart coming and doing some work with Jay again were true, but as to who's bass lines they are, I'm not sure. <br />     It's also nice to have some slow grooving tunes from Jay again. Talulah is a great great funky 16th note ballad. If you've picked up the Late Nite Tales album that Jay compiled you can completly here the influences on this album as well, I'd recommend it to anyone who is looking for some of the fantastic roots to Jamiroquai's music. <br />     After the 4 year wait I'd have to say this album does not dissapoint and I'm looking forward to what new things we'll hear in the future of Jamiroquai.

B0009KA7BS|3.0|I didn't get what I was expecting.  The special effects are pretty good but that was about it.  Just taken as an action movie its so so, but if you expected anything more out of it...don't.  I guess I set my sights too high with the likes of the Exorcist and the Prophecy....this one doesn't even come close.  It was a gift to me and my gift to you is to get for 99 cent rental or wait to buy it for under 10 bucks.
0783117523|5.0|This is a review of the unrated DVD edition of *Gia*, an HBO television movie originally aired in 1998. It stars Angelina Jolie as Gia Marie Carangi. Mercedes Ruehl is Kathleen Carangi, Gia's mother. Eric Michael Cole plays T.J., Gia's sometimes boyfriend. Elizabeth Mitchell is Linda, Gia's girl lover. Fay Dunaway is Wilhemina Cooper, Gia's manager at the Wilhemina Modeling Agency. Michael Christofer directs. Two years after *Gia*, he would direct Ms Jolie and Antonio Banderas in *Original Sin.*  <br /> <br />*Gia* the movie is far from perfect. But \\"Gia\\" the character played by Angelina Jolie is one of the very best dramatic performances ever put to film. The emotional nakedness that Ms Jolie displays reminds me of young Timothy Hutton in *Ordindary People* (1980), a most moving role that won the Oscar for this new face in Hollywood. Many filmgoers agree that if *Gia* had been made for cinema, Ms Jolie would have likewise won an Oscar. She won a Golden Globe, her second.  <br /> <br />About *Gia* the film, it doesn't try hard enough to show us what actually happened to Gia Marie Carangi. Perhaps that's because many of the people who knew Carangi and worked with her are still alive; maybe some of them have objections to a real biopic. I don't know. What I do know is that the HBO *Gia* is more of a fictionalized impression of \\"America's first supermodel\\" than a true presentation of the facts of her life. All the \\"talking heads\\" who speak about Gia as if they knew her personally are actors who did not know her at all. Mercedes Ruehl as Kathleen Carangi has the most to tell us; but the real mother of Gia Marie Carangi denounced the film as a misrepresentation of her daughter.  <br /> <br />I'll give one example of misrepresentation. In the HBO film, the character Linda plays a major role in Gia's life. But there was no Linda at all. In fact there was, as the film shows, a makeup girl who was photographed with Gia on an indoor set with a chain link fence as a prop. Butthough some said she was sexually involved with Gia, that girl herself denied it. Apart from what Gia did or did not have going with the makeup girl, she did have a lesbian girlfriend. But like Gia, this girlfriend was addicted to heroin. So the Linda played by Elizabeth Mitchell who is drugfree and who so tenderly helps Gia get clean is an invention of the scriptwriters.  <br /> <br />An individual who maintains an Internet website dedicated to the real Gia Marie Carangi declares that Gia's journal (the one Ms Jolie sometimes speaks offscreen from, with the verse that begins: \\"Life and death, energy and peace...\\") is a fiction. Those words are not, this invididual insists, written by Gia Marie Carangi. For my part as a reviewer of the DVD, all I can say, once more, is that I don't know. But there is no denying that the filmscript as a biography is highly questionable.  <br /> <br />Stylistically the film is a little dull. But I suppose that's normal for a TV movie. The cinematography shifts between color and black-and-white without rhyme nor reason. Either the real Gia was ambidexterous, or there's a major continuity blooper. We see the young Gia, played by Mila Kunis, starting her journal. She writes with her right hand. Later, when noted southpaw Angelina Jolie plays the adult Gia, she carves her name into a desktop with a knife held in her left hand. And with her left hand she signs out on her methadone treatment.  <br /> <br />I could go on and on picking the movie apart AS A MOVIE. Finally I'd end up giving *Gia* a rating of 3 stars at best...if it wasn't for what Angelina Jolie did with her role. When she is on screen, she mesmerizes the camera. It's not just her beauty. It's certainly not her sex scene with Elizabeth Mitchell accompanied by the drone of a female singer on the soundtrack. (Corny!) It's three things: 1) the acting; 2) the acting; 3) the acting.  <br /> <br />I love movies. I love the history of movies. I love the great stars of movies. And ofall I love about movies, I love \\"sleepers\\" or \\"B-film classics\\" the most. These are low budget films starring actors who were not top names, yet somehow what the camera captured is sheer magic. Example? Reaching way back, Jacques Toureau's 1947 film noir *Out of the Past* starring Robert Mitchum. It's a midnight cheapie. I could pick it apart piece by piece. But if you just shut up and WATCH what the camera saw the actors do, *Out of the Past* transports you out of this world. And despite its technical flaws, so does *Gia*--because of the magic of Angelina Jolie.  <br /> <br />In *Gia* there are about a half-dozen scenes performed by Ms Jolie that are so intense, I find them hard to watch unless I've emotionally prepared myself. I can't say positively that one stands out over the others. But if I were to pick a scene that I'm positive would transport any person who sat down to see *Gia* for the first time, I'd pick the last meeting between Gia and Linda, when Ms Jolie says to Elizabeth Mitchell, \\"You were the one...the only one.\\" A scene like that--that's why movies were invented!  <br /> <br />*Gia* is not a documentary. It is hardly even a biopic. Angelina Jolie doesn't show us exactly what Gia Marie Carangi did at 6 PM on December 4th 1981. And then what she did at 3 AM on July 30, 1985. She shows us that Gia was blessed with an extraordinary gift, something exciting, brilliant, entrancing. Sometimes it's called star power. That gift is why Gia rose overnight out of nowhere to the top of the fashion model scene. Ms Jolie is able to show us that gift because she has it herself. It's in that sense that, yes, Angelina Jolie IS Gia, as the DVD boxcover proclaims.  <br /> <br />Gia didn't know how to handle her gift. Like the old story of Icarus, she rose on swift wings up to the sun only to have those wings destroyed by solar fire. As fast as she rose, she plummeted back to earth. *Gia* tells a frankly tragic story. But the closing scene--Gia walking away from the deathbed cloaked in folds of white, as if passing on to that next life she told T.J. about, the life in which God has a big plan for her--this scene represents the undying hope that makes a human being human.  <br /> <br />
B0007GAERG|4.0|After Mariah reportedly suffered through a grueling depression, she finally got back on her feet to produce a magnificently crafted album full of deep and meaningful songs. Her effortlessly beautiful voice shines throughout the course of these beautiful 14 tracks. From the hit We Belong Together,the hip It's Like That, to the smooth Circles, Mariah's finest hour is displayed. Her talent gorgeously soars in every other single song, none of the tracks included are empty filler like most of what is included in hit CDs nowadays. This CD is highly recommended to Mariah fans and casual music lovers alike.
B00006RJHG|5.0|I don't understand why there are any negative reviews of this awesome movie..It's apparent to me that the negative reviewers are used to the gore/hack/slasher movies that have been so prevalent in recent decades.. <br /> <br /> <br />This movie leaves more to the imagination then others...It was one of the first of it's kind too...It is truly terrifying to watch..And even moreso,if your alone at night...It totally gives me chills thinking about the callers creepy voice.And how he changes from an adult to a child...I've never seen another movie that comes close to the atmosphere that this film creates,without the use of graphic mutilation..Sure..I love those as well..But I'm a fan of well made movies all around...This one is sure to please...
B00005T5YK|5.0|I'm really fond of good pop and rock music, especially the oldies goldies and I think this album is worth every penny. The surround mixing is perfect and the atmosphere is superb. <br /> <br />This album is for all those who liked the music and the atmosphere of films like Almost Famous. And those who like guitars. And those who feel the urge to escape from today's crap music world and travel back in time a bit.
B0006284JQ|1.0|Britney Spears has got to be the worlds most overrated singer ever.  Her vocals are average and nothing special or \\"ear catching.\\" Her songs are just your average overproduced bubblegum poppers with her voice being computerized and other effects.  And come on, for crying out loud, with lyrics like \\"Outrageous, my shopping spree, my sex drive..., it shows that the vaults are getting a little dry.
B0000046X0|5.0|I first heard this album while Chick Corea was being interviewed on a New York Jazz Station named WRVR which has been long gone. I was very young and it changed my views of jazz right away. I mean i loved Jazz as a child but it hit me when I heard this. None of my rock idols can match this. They were ripping into space with this album. Wow its nice saying album again. This was part of the new fusion music which was musical yet complicated. <br />If you were not open minded this was not your music. But it was the beginning of a strong voice in music. It was powerful and very inventive. More so than even many of the fusion music being played today. It was not watered down by any means. A few continnue it today which is  very supported. This is a great album and a signiture style that represented the culture of its time.
0385338686|5.0|This book was great and lived up to my expectations.  I have been waiting all summer for it to come out and was worried it would not be as good as her previous books, but it was just as good, if not better!  The story was wonderful and I think this would make a great movie.  I can not understand any other reviewer who say it was to light and unrealistic.  Kinsella is the queen of light hearted romantic comedies. I found myself laughing out loud throughout the story.  And the raspberry scene made the purchase of the book well worth the cost!  I am only sadden to know that I will probably have to wait another year for the next Kinsella book. <br /> <br />Anyone who loved her other books, loves Chicklit or is looking for a good romantic comedy should buy this book! It was very enjoyable and I totally loved it!
B000060P79|1.0|This has got to be the worst attempt at musicianship I have ever seen! All these (...) do is whine about how their life is \\"such a nightmare\\" and how \\"god must hate them\\". They just write whiny songs like these so pre-teens and little kids can feel sorry for them and hopefully buy their CDs. This CD is not pop-punk or pop-rock it is just straight up commerialized POP for all the woe-is-me hottopic posuers.

B0000CDL93|5.0|JFK is a overwelming film based on two books \\"On the trail of the Assassins\\" & \\"Crossfire\\". The assassination seems to have been a huge plot. Dallas Police Officers, CIA, FBI, Jack Ruby amongst others were all militantly oppossed to Kennedy's policies and were all working together like a grapevine to get rid of him. Officer J.D. Tippit was killed to draw attention away from Dealey Plaza because a number of men had been arrested there, including The 3 Tramps who were really CIA Agents David Lemar Christ, Howard Hunt & Frank Sturgis. It seems that Lee Harvey Oswald was a mere spectater in Dealey Plaza. There have also been rumours over the years of a Montreal connection to the J.F.K Assassination.
0316172324|4.0|Blink is about rapid cognition, about the kind of thinking that happens in a blink of an eye. Making a decision within the first two seconds of looking-the glance that knows and interprets the fact in an instant.  Gladwell emphasizes the first two seconds, because in that instant conclusions that we reach are really powerful and really important and, occasionally, really good.  Unlike intuition, what goes on in the first two seconds is perfectly rational; it's just thinking that moves a little faster and operates a little more mysteriously than the kind of deliberate, conscious decision-making that we usually associate with thinking. <br /> <br /> <br />Drawing on cutting-edge neuroscience and psychology, he shows how the difference between good decision-making and bad has nothing to do with how much information we can process quickly, but on the few particular details on which we focus.  Gladwell reveals how we can become better decision makers--in our homes, our offices, and in everyday life. The result is a book that is surprising and transforming. Never again will you think about thinking the same way. <br /> <br /> <br />Gladwell, campaigns for snap judgments and mind reading with a gift for translating research into splendid storytelling. Building his case with scenes from a marriage, heart attack triage, speed dating, choking on the golf course, selling cars, and military maneuvers, he persuades readers to think small and focus on the meaning of \\"thin slices\\" of behavior. The key is to rely on our \\"adaptive unconscious\\"--a 24/7 mental valet--that provides us with instant and sophisticated information to warn of danger, read a stranger, or react to a new idea.  <br /> <br /> <br />The book is well rounded as it presents the limitations with rapid deductions. There are obvious caveats about leaping to conclusions as: marketers can manipulate our first impressions, high arousal moments make us \\"mind blind,\\" focusing on the wrong cue leaves us vulnerable to \\"theWarren Harding Effect\\" (i.e., voting for a handsome but hapless president). Then in explaining the Pepsi challenge he elaborates how people can be attracted to Pepsi (which is sweeter than coke) in taste tests. However if the entire drink is taken Coke is markedly more attractive to the same group. In a provocative chapter that exposes the \\"dark side of blink,\\" he illuminates the failure of rapid cognition in the tragic stakeout and murder of Amadou Diallo in the Bronx. He underlines studies about autism, facial reading and cardio uptick to urge training that enhances high-stakes decision-making. <br />
B00003CXRP|4.0|This is a film for which I have very mixed feelings. I didn't care much for it when it first came out but through DVD have surely learned to appreciate it. <br />The plane crash is truly amazing and terrifying, the island scenes great and the escape from the island / rescue will simply leave you drained. My biggest problem has to do with the long scenes between Tom Hanks and Helen Hunt at the return of the movie, they're just frustrating as closure for the characters couldn't ever exist. To top this we get a touching but long an unncesary monologue well over 2 hours into the movie. <br />Still, a great an unique experience which somehow I find myself repeating on a regular basis.
B00025ETIW|5.0|Finally some fresh blood in the music industry! Gerard Way haunts this album! It's dark and demanding of the listener. I haven't heard anything else like it in a very long time. Once you hear it you're addicted to the sound. Rock on MCR!!!
B00006J3WH|5.0|Loved this episode. It was....what's the word I used? Oh yeah...AWESOME!!! <br /> <br />Best episode in the series. One of the best in episodic television, period.  <br /> <br />The songs moved you, meant something (the lyrics were substantive, emotion-filled, were in-synch with both the characters and what the characters were going through at the time...and rhymed to boot!) and were well paced, crafted and executed. The actors really put their all into it and did an EXCELLENT job. From giles and amber benson's great vocal performances to Sarah M.G.'s dancing at the end. It was just...great. Vocally- Amber Benson stole the show...too bad mr. whedon repaid her by killing off her character a few episodes later!!!!!!!(thank you joss...NOT!!!) Giles can REALLY sing as well..I mean..he puts it down. Everyone does a great job and j.w. really put in work with his lyric authorship.  <br /> <br />BTVS pulled off quite a coup with this one! <br /> <br />
B0007OCG4W|3.0|Not since Little Black Book has there been a movie where I dont like any character. Closer is a strong movie, will harsh, sexual words, and great performances from everyone. There is a little bit of  confusion, but it's hard to completly like a movie when there's no characters you can relate to.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Wonderfully entertaining!  I went with my 30 year-old niece and her 11 year old daughter, and we all loved it!  This show appeals to all, and certainly gives a new humorous perspective to the Wizard of OZ!  I recommend it to anyone.  The two female leads are incredibly talented and make watching the show pure joy!
B0007M22TI|5.0|I loved the show and have purchased both the CD and the DVD, In the interviews Lisa Kelly mentioned she has made a CD, Can anyone tell me where I can find it? I have searched all over.
B0002SROT0|5.0|Elliott's X/O release may very well be my favortie record of all time (read my review) and I've been buying records since 1968.  From a Basement on the Hill is rougher, not as polished and that's not necessarily a bad thing.  I also find it a bit uneven compared to X/O.  The opening track Coast to Coast tells us right away that we are listening to an Elliott release that is going to rock - well in some places.  One or two tunes is a tad morose but that's what the man was about at times.  Then there is a tune (can't recall it off the top of my head) that echos the blistering and tension-filled guitar work of King Crimson's \\"Red.\\"  If you already love Elliott, you will love this. If you haven't heard Elliott, start with X/O so that you can see what all the fuss is about and then go to the other releases.  Oh, and fans of The Shins will love Basement.<br /><br />Postscript a few months on:  After many listens I decided that this CD, while great musically, is just too darn depressing.  This was one angry, bitter guy.  I decided to part with it.  Life's too short to expose oneself to too much of this sort of thing.  He's too bitter here, too bitter. WARNING:  NOT FOR PERSON'S SUFFERING FROM DEPRESSION.<br /><br />Nick Hornby, in his book \\"High Fidelity\\", poses the question:  \\"Does one listen to depressing music because one is depressed or is one depressed because one keeps listening to depressing music?\\"  I found this question (and my subsequent answer) life changing.  I recommend anyone infatuated with Elliott Smith  - who really was a great artist - step back, read Hornby's book, and then take stock of your life.  And yes, the movie by the same name starring John Cusack and Jack Black was loosely based on this book but the real message from the book was totally lost in the \\"love story\\".

0385504209|5.0|Forget the hype, will the suspension of your disbelief and enjoy this terrific page-turner. Without spoiling the plot or surprises it's about a Symbiologist (Robert Langdon) who is in France to meet the curator of The Louvre Art Museum. But the meeting never takes place and there follows in the next few hundred pages an incredible eye-opening journey of discovery. Langdon and a Cryptologist (Sophie Neveau) are on a chase to solve a puzzle left for them by the curator. They don't know who the good guys/ bad guys are, they don't know what's on the other end of the puzzle and there are twists and turns all the way through. It reminds me of The Thirty- Nine Steps by John Buchan where you have an ordinary guy (okay, not ordinary but non-cop/ non-crook) just minding his own business and then suddenly caught up in international intrigue and murder and having to stay ahead of both the good guys and the bad because he doesn't know who's on his side. The beginning, ending, and the ride in between are fantastic. The controversial aspects of the book concern Paganism and Catholicism and I'm sure there are many facts but also fallacies - This is fiction. It's nearly six hundred pages long and I read it in a weekend.
B00005JKJA|5.0|I saw \\"Mulholland Drive\\" back in 2001 twice, and saw it for a third time only recently. Surprisingly, I was still able to enjoy it to the extent that I did when watching it for the first time, unlike many other movies. <br /> <br />A woman is involved in a car accident, and doesn't remember who she is. There is a conspiracy to get a particular lead actress into a movie. A man nearly gets a heart attack from seeing a `monster' behind the alley of a restaurant. An aspiring actress arrives to make her mark in the film industry. A clumsy hit man kills three people in the office. A director finds his wife in bed with the pool man. Even though these people are not connected to each other in any way in the beginning, they somehow get connected through a blue box.  <br /> <br />Doesn't make any sense? Don't worry! People are still trying to pick their brains on solving each and every detail of the movie However, the more you look into it, the more sense it makes. David Lynch did an AMAZING job in directing this movie. He maintains a suspenseful atmosphere throughout the movie, without having to add any loud bangs and noises. I admit, I haven't seen any of his previous works, but after watching this, I am going to make sure that I do. Naomi Watts did a terrific job in her role as well. Laura Harring was adequate, but didn't portray much emotion. The rest of the cast did well, and made the film more interesting. <br /> <br />All in all, this is a movie which you want to watch over and over, either because you like it so much, or you want to understand it better, or both. <br /> <br />Silencio.
B0006L16N8|1.0|this is not art; this is product....mediocre generic product, at that.  The other day I heard \\"Speed of Sound\\" while at the grocery store.  It seemed fitting there among aisles upon aisles upon aisles of product to be consumed and, then, shat out the next day.
B00005JKG7|5.0|Being a fan of the `Halloween' series, I decided to watch this movie. Released in 1980, `The Fog' is one of one of the better horror movies that has that 80s classic horror style to it. <br /> <br />The story starts off with Mr. Machen (played by John Houseman), an old fisherman who is telling a ghost story to some children. He tells the story about the `Elizabeth Dane', a ship that was carrying some people and suddenly lost control at sea because of the fog on April 21st, 1880. It is now 100 years later, and the residents of Antonio Bay are putting on a celebration to cheer their forefathers on building a prosperous town. However, the victims of the Dane seek revenge for their betrayal 100 years back and rise from the fog to do it. Some of the people who find out that something's wrong in the air are: (1) Stevie Wayne (Adrienne Barbeau) - owner and DJ of 1340 KAB radio station, and (2) Nick (played by Tom Atkins) and Elizabeth (Jamie Lee Curtis), 2 people who are in town and are witnessed to a lot of strange happenings. 3) Father Malone (played by Hal Holbrook), who is the only one knows the reason and history behind the fog. The story mainly revolves around these people, and their chances of survival (like any horror movie). <br /> <br />John Carpenter (famous for his work in horror movies such as `The Halloween' series) does a terrific job once again in creating a frightening horror movie. Even though there are some missing aspects in the movie (for example, we don't know much about Jamie Lee Curtis's character), this film maintains a creepy atmosphere throughout. The make up for the zombie like creatures and the lighting for this movie is fantastic! Carpenter should also be credited for the eerie music that he has composed for this movie (somewhat similar to the music in `Halloween' but good nevertheless). Adrienne Barbeau, Jamis Lee Curtis and Tom Atkins did a great job on their roles, especially Adrienne as Stevie Wayne.  <br /> <br />There are a lot of special features added to this DVD such as an original documentary and a new one of the movie, various outtakes on it, galleries etc. for fans to enjoy. This is a great movie to watch on a rainy day with the lights out! <br />
B00005Q4CS|5.0|Let me start off by imploring you to get this version, the director's cut, if (hopefully when) you choose to get this movie.  The rated version leaves out a few minutes of the end, and since the director's cut is cheaper anyways, it should be a no-brainer. <br /> <br />The story follows Harry Goldfarb, his girlfriend, Marion, his best friend, Tyrone, and his mother, Sarah.  Harry abuses drugs with Tyrone and Marion while neglecting his relationship with his mother, only visiting her to steal and pawn her TV for drug money.  Eventually Harry and Tyrone explore the prospect of dealing heroin to get rich, and it works.  At first.  Meanwhile, Harry's mother finds out she's going to be on TV and grows ecstatic.  What program she's going to be on is never made clear to her, but she's determined to lose enough weight to fit into her favorite red dress and impress her friends on the show.  To make this happen, she turns to diet pills.  Problem is, they turn out to be amphetamines. <br /> <br />Obviously there is no viable happy ending to any of these scenarios.  The characters have dug themselves into holes too deep to get out of and are left without the power to dig themselves out.  It's by how likeable they become throughout the film that makes the finale so incredibly moving.  This is most due to rock-solid performances from the cast.  Jared Leto plays Harry wonderfully and creates good chemistry with the rest of the cast.  Marlon Wayans takes a turn for the dramatic as Tyrone, Harry's closest confidant, and knocks the ball out of the park.  Jennifer Connelly is also noteworthy as Marion, the talented artist that just got lost along the way, but Ellen Burstyn is mesmerizing as Sarah Goldfarb.  Every note she hits as the doomed widow is perfection.  I'm now certain that she only lost the Oscar to Julia Roberts because of Julia's star power. <br /> <br />The direction and cinematography are, as already mentioned by countless others, solid, but the best thing about the entire film is Clint Mansell's score and how well it accentuates the entire mood and atmosphere.  It's often very effective in amplifying the emotion of any given scene and giving the film a world of its own which is what makes the whole experience a triumph.
B0000067L2|5.0|I think that Cream really raised  the musical bar to infinite heights with this mesmerising album. I rate this as their fnest work, as the power trio took music to a new plateau, which, in my opinion is what great bands such as Cream succeed in doing. Clapton's wailing, bluesy guitar work is superb here, especially on Sunshine of Your Love and Tales of Brave Ulysses. Jack Bruce proves why he is probably the greatest bassist that rock has ever seen, while also demonstrating a wonderful vocal talent as well. Ginger Baker plays the drums masterfully as well with double kicks galore. This is the band that paved the way for wannabes like Led Zeppelin to follow but never quite reach the infinitely high musical plateau reached  by the power trio during the two short years in which they forever changed music.
B0000584V3|5.0|there's so much to say about this album. it's like a work of art.pure talent, from everyone in the band
B00000GAIW|1.0|This album was played by the high school deejay through the speakers in my school cafeteria virtually every day, and I could not stand it then, just as I cannot stand it now. Why this group is so highly regarded is baffling to me. I think Ian Anderson's singing and fluting have an inexplicable, innately irritating quality that makes my skin crawl when I hear it. I think the best way to attain any Jethro Tull CD is to simply not attain one, just as the best way to hear Jethro Tull is to not listen to them.
B000002C2E|1.0|This album is like an old man's version of Love Gone Wrong.  I found the arrangements on this album so bad that I couldn't even listen to the words. <br /> <br />Dylan should have gone back to his roots and listened to the blues artists from the Mississippi Delta that influenced his original pre Vietnam Greenwich styles. <br /> <br />This is an atrocoious attempt at doing blues without a blues harp.  At least I couldn't discern one or a saxaphone.  It sounded like the guiter playing was stuck in the same cord the whole album, a listless put me to sleep melody.  I discerened an ocassional attempt to bring out some blues chords from the piano but way to weak. <br /> <br />I have been a Dylan fan for 40 years and this is one album that deserves to gather dust.  If I want blues I will stay with Muddy Waters, B.B. King, Jimmy Weatherspoon, Bo Diddley Little Walker, John Mayall and CCR.   <br /> <br />This album showed his age and in may opinion would make for background music at the Saturday night bridge fest in a Nursing Home. <br /> <br />Yuk
B000002OX7|5.0|This album represents The Who at their very best. A stunningly superb album, Who's Next is a compilation of songs originally intended for a film project called \\"Life House\\" that eventually went by the wayside. This album represents Pete Townshend at his most brilliantly creative peak, and the band as a whole demonstrates the vast musical talent that each member had individually. It is also blatantly indicative of the wonderful musical chemistry the group had together as well. There is not a single track on the album that could be categorized as \\"throw away\\" either, and when I first heard it, I mistook it for a greatest hits album and was astonished when I found out that it was an album of studio songs intended initially as a soundtrack. This amazing album also proved, in my opinion, that The Who were so much more talented than many other overrated bands of their time like Pink Floyd and Jethro Tull. And neither Roger Waters (an insipid bore, in my opinion) nor the nauseating Ian Anderson could hold a candle to the sheer musical brilliance of Pete Townshend. \\"Who's Next\\" is the pure essence of musical genius.

B000002AGE|4.0|Miles Davis started fusion with his Bitches Brew album. Weather Report helped push it along and make it popular among popular radio and jazz fans alike. <br /> <br />Weather Report hosted some talented musicians in its day. Wayne Shorter and Joe Zawinul lead this group and said hello and goodbye to some of the most innovative musicians in the history of jazz. Many who are featured here.  <br /> <br />Of course, Jaco Pastorious is one of the best bass players the world has ever seen. And Manolo Badrena was pretty successful around this time. <br /> <br />Even with the top notch musicians, however, I wasn't really hip to the music on this cut. I first heard Birdland, then ran out and bought Heavy Weather. (I still have yet to purchase any more WE albums) I loved Birdland, but I wasn't thrilled with the music. Jaco's composition displays impressive talent, but the song seems to go nowhere. And then those pop elevator ballads...  <br /> <br />Weather Report was not a polished band. The band consisted of great solos, and rarely, catchy melodies. I don't know why people call this their best album. I still pop it in, and every now and then, a song I hadn't dug would begin to grab me, but for the most part, I'm going to have to say, this recording was nothing of a masterpiece.

B0009S2TCU|4.0|This is a really fun idea - package six horror movies into a box that looks like a six-pack for beer, complete with a \\"died on\\" date and a creed about \\"serving premium horror since 1989\\".  Anchor Bay has always released some great cult horror hits with plenty of extras, and here you get six for the price of three.  In this set the theme is \\"the devil\\", and he's certainly mentioned a lot in all of these films.  From antichrists to fraternity initiations, the devil appears everywhere including a gym class.  The bulk of these films are foreign, so a lot of dubbing going on, and not tons of recognizable stars in most of them (save for Linda Blair in HELL NIGHT).  None of them are horror classics by definition, though quite a few of them are solid and of interest.  TO THE DEVIL... A DAUGHTER was a swan song for Hammer Studios, THE ANTICHRIST is a pretty neat EXORCIST rip-off with some trippy scenes seen here for the first time uncut, FEAR NO EVIL brings armageddon to high school, CURSE OF THE DEVIL is interesting evil against evil, HELL NIGHT is typical slasher fare, and THE CHURCH was originally called DEMONS 3 and has a script by horror master Argento (SUSPIRIA).  All in all, it's a fun collection in a witty box at a nice price.  6 movies, 6 discs loaded with extras, and 6 reasons to give the devil his due.  Please drink responsibly.
B000268QB2|5.0|After listening to this album once I was unimpressed. Dodgy intros, coupled with a feeling each song, somehow sounded excactly the same. But stick with it my friends, because after a second or third run through it suddenly becomes the best thing you've heard all year. Some of the intros are still bit lame but it's well worth listening to each song at least 60 seconds before moving on to the next.
0140120416|5.0|This book is essential for learning Russian in a Russian-speaking country. I've had several (4-5) private Russian tutors and they all teach in the same rigid Soviet-style method using some ancient Soviet-era textbook. This generally includes learning 1-2 simple grammar items per lesson and then doing written and oral grammar drills over and over. You'll never be functional like this, plus it takes forever. You have to speed up the process by showing them you are a quick learner. You can accomplish that with this book, supplementing with words and phrases you pick up in everyday life. <br /> <br />I find that the best thing to do is learn the grammar yourself using the book and then find a tutor (this is the hard part!) who is flexible enough to sit and try to have conversations with you using the grammar you have learned from this book and who can teach you extra non-book things that you need in order to function in your day-to-day life.
6305537321|4.0|I have to admit that after I first saw this film...I didn't not like it at all! But of course I had no idea what this movie was about and had alot of very different expectations. After seeing other Audrey Hepburn movies (like \\"My Fair Lady\\" and \\"Funny Face\\") I expected a character that was sweet and naive. I was very surprised...but after I saw it again I really enjoyed the film. Holly Golightly is a girl who dates men for money. While Paul Varjak is a writer who is currently down on his luck and somewhat is in the same line of business that Holly is. Audrey Hepburn broke out of her usual character role and was faboulous in this movie. Even though this movie wasn't exactly like the novel (from what I heard) this movie was definitely probably shocking for the 1960's. And even though it has its faults (Mickey Rooney's role) it is a movie every girl should see!
B000A88F22|5.0|I totally love this thing. I live in Europe and this DVD will not probably be released here but I will order it anyway. I loved all episodes, she's so fun and down to earth. There's no glamorous, preparing and etc like in Newlyweds. All are real and raw and that's what life is. The last episode impressed me the most. There's footages when she's gettin' married and everything from the wedding. I was like crying because it was very emotional. Y'all gotta get it.<br /><br />Plus there's a bonus Audio CD featuring the new hit \\"Someday (I Will Understand\\" and the theme song \\"Chaotic\\". I'm soo excited and I can't wait to get it! Make sure you get it too! It's really worth your money!
B00005JNSK|5.0|There are only 2 movies that I  want to see in the theater this year: Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. I am a huge Johnny Depp fan, so when I saw he was going to do this movie, I had to see it. Johnny Depp is a comic genius. This is a fun movie and it may become one of my favorites over time. What you need to remember about this version is that it is not a remake of the 1971 version, but more a recreation of the book. It is much darker than the '71 version and Depp as Willy is much creepier than Wilder's intrepretation of Willy. However, when you get over the initial shock of Depp's Willy (his clothes, actions, voice, and make-up are a bit unnerving at first), the movie is thourghly enjoyable. The '71 version of the movie is too light, colorful, sugary, and too much a musical. This newer version has darker tones and although it has some songs, it doesn' have the feel of a musical like the first one did.  <br /> <br />The message I got out of the movie is that family is important. Charlie and his family are just barely making ends meet, however, the whole family is there. With their family they really don't need anything else. Charlie is offered to inherit Willy's chocolate factory---but at what price? Charlie aslo helps Willy to reestablish ties with his father. In the end, Charlie and his family helps Willy to find something that he lost long ago.  <br /> <br />I read several reviews about Charlie and the Chocolate Factory before I saw the movie. Many of them commented on parallels between Depp's Willy Wonka and Michael Jackson. Watching this movie, I can see all the parallels drawn between the two. My bit of advice about whether to see this movie in the theater or wait for the DVD is this: if you are completely enthuastic about this movie, go see it in the theater (great visual effects). If you are not sure about seeing it or not or if there's any doubt, wait for it to come out on DVD.
B0009MDPYM|3.0|That is the way to describe Constantine starring Keanu Reeves.  the basic premis for the movie is that John Constantine has been kicked out of Heaven because he was a suicide and he was revived after two minutes of being dead.  Since his revival, Constantine has been fighting demons and sending them back to Hell and he is fearfull of being sent back to hell with all of the angry demons he has sent back.  In walks Rachael Weisz playing both parts of twins trying to figure out why one of the twins committed suicide.  Of course the rest of the movie is demons trying to kill Constatine to keep him from finding out the truth. <br /> <br />The movie is short on story and long on special effects.  the special effects are cool to watch and the film does well on this alone, but the special effects can't carry this epic and starts to fail miserably after a short while.  Constantine is silly and eye candy only, but it is a nice way to pass some time.  Nothing special here unless you are a Reeves fan and then you will like for that alone.  This movie is along the lines of \\"End of Days\\" and \\"STigmata\\", but not done as well.
076790592X|5.0|This short but insightful story is a joy to read and a good reminder to us to relish every moment we are here on this planet as we are here to both enjoy and learn.  Every day there are new lessons to learn and Mitch Albom brings this message to us in a heartfelt personal experience in his own life.  I would also recommend reading two other books--one that speaks of the life and death drama and the lessons learned from a family perspective (Vita's Will:  Real Life Lessons about Life, Death & Moving on).  And the other deals with the aftermath of tragedy and how you can be happy no matter what happens in life (The Goddess of Happiness:  A Down-to-Earth Guide for Heavenly Balance and Bliss)
B0000TB01Y|5.0|This is such a spectacular show. Sometimes I think words just can't describe it's magnitude. A few weeks ago, I sang several songs from the show (\\"Popular,\\" \\"Defying Gravity,\\" and \\"For Good\\") and I must say that this show, and the music have the power to bring people together. I don't know if you can say that about many Broadway shows.  <br /> <br />As the song \\"For Good\\" displays... <br /> <br />\\"Who can say if I've been changed for the better, but because I knew you, I have been changed for good!\\"  <br /> <br />Incredible CD, you won't be dissapointed.
B00005JNJT|5.0|Comparing this Batman film to the previous 4 intiated by Tim Burton in '89 would be like comparing Gotham Apples to Metropolis Oranges. But...the darkness Burton opened with in his first film, is surpassed here by this extended origin tale. Although, no obvious influence comes from Frank Miller graphic novel storyline Batman: Year One, this is still a superior comicbook movie, which says alot since Spiderman (1 & 2) upped the bar for the genre.<br /><br />Bale is really believable as the driven, haunted Bruce Wayne, Caine is really believable and fun as Alfred, Morgan Freeman is believable and shrewd as Fox, Gary Oldman is believable in any role, his Pre-commish Gordan is no exception, not to mention the first time Gordan look like the comic character. Everything, including the chaotic climax rings believable, nothing seems overly impossible, in this very grounded vision of Gotham.<br /><br />My only complaint is the editing of the fight sequences is so intense that it is difficult to follow the action and often just plain confusing. Congrats', to all who decided for Batman NOT to end up with a girlfriend in the end. Overall, a great beginning, I look foward to more.
B00000I14Z|5.0|One of the best jazz albums. Better Get It In Yer Soul really Gets in Yer Soul. Goodbye Pork Pie Hat is a mournful tribute to Lester Young with a great title. Listen to the sax solo - in a part, it sounds liike the saxophonist is crying. Boogie Stop Shuffle is an interesting stop-start twelve-bar blues tune with a really catchy melody. Self Portrait in Three Colors is an OK ballad. Open Letter to Duke is a very interesting number. It starts as an uptempo track, then slows down about two minutes in, only to pick up after another two minutes of going slow. And it's a tribute to the original jazz genius Duke Ellington. Bird Calls is a bebop Parker tribute complete with opening and closing sax lines that actually sound like bird calls. Fables of Faubus is a slap at the Governor of Arkansas who refused to intergrate schools. It just oozes bitternessbut is a great song. Pussy Cat Dues is a relaxed, medium bluesy tune. Jelly Roll is the fourth (!) tribute piece to another composer. Three outtakes are featured here: Pedal Point Blues, GG Train and Girl of My Dreams. These three pieces are okay, the best being Pedal Point Blues, but I listen to the originals more.
B0002IU988|5.0|I bought this album on a whim as I heard one song I liked and read a review that there is some great guitar work.  Bottom line is that the \\"new\\" creed definately kicks butt on this album.  Tremotti tears is up and has great tunes.  A must have album.
B00005JNJT|5.0|I loved Batman Begins. It's definitely the best Batman film released hands down. Remember Batman and Robin, the self-parody that completely marred the series? Well, this Batman has more than salvaged the enigmatic hero's image on the big screen. Batman is here to stay and I can't wait for the sequel ;-)<br /><br />Move over Michael Keaton, Christian Bale is flying through :-) Bale's portrayal of Batman is my favorite so far with Keaton's close second. Val Kilmer's was OK and George Clooney's right out sucked ass chunks. I mean, really!<br /><br />Michael Caine, Liam Neeson and Gary Oldman are, as always, superb. Katie Holmes is good but does account for much of the cheese in the film. All in all, performances are solid and you do feel for the characters, which is very important to me.<br /><br />The movie covers so many story lines from the childhood times to the rebellion times to the rising times of Batman with great fluidity. The plot is very plausible and the special effects are outstanding.<br /><br />Batman Begins tackles the subject of justice and it's relationship to revenge and vengeance. It's almost a critical commentary on the state of affairs of our world today.<br /><br />If only we had a Batman!
B0006L16N8|5.0|Like the previous two Coldplay albums, this one takes sometime getting into. But when you, its amazing. In terms of the composition the album sounds a lot like Rush of Blood to the Head, but I think the tracks are a lot more layered and the lyrics are deeper on this album. <br /> <br />I cannot find a bad song on the album, though the song I skip most now is Speed of Sound, but only cause it gets so much airplay. <br /> <br />My favourite songs are Square One, White Shadows, Fix You, A Message and Twisted Logic. But the song that really blows me apart is Til' Kingdom Come. Its a really slow song but the lyrics are so beautiful it sends shivers down my spine everytime I listen to it. <br /> <br />This album is a great buy and Coldplay seem to be getting back to the simplistic beauty of Parachutes.
1400095913|5.0|As a Miami native, I loved this book - the dark self deprecating humor, the familiar locations, the typical Miami-ish characters, and the disturbing \\"he needed killing\\" mentality. Can't wait to read the next installment.
B000001FRY|5.0|A lot of people will try to tell you that The Joshua Tree or Achtung baby is their best, but I think this is. Like Kiss and Van Halen's first album, this is one of the greatest debuts of all time. Looking at other people's reviews, I guess I'm not the only person that thinks that. Every song on here is just amazing.  <br /> <br />This album is a mostly up-beat concept album about a boy's life. If you compare it to other concept albums like Pink Floyd's The Wall, well.... it kind of falls flat, but it's the music that makes this cd so great. The Edge is one of the greatest guitar players of all time, and Bono's voice is stunning. My favorites are I Will Follow, Twilight, Into The Heart, and A Day Without Me. <br /> <br />I think even a non U2 fan would actually like this. You should definetely try it. I also recommend War.
0385513755|3.0|It has long been my contention that fiction writers have two main components: writing skills and story-telling skills.  The best fiction writers are good at both.  In my opinion, F. Scott Fitzgerald is a prime example of someone who writes beautifully but isn't that great at storytelling, while J.K. Rowling comes to mind as a master storyteller whose writing skills are occasionally lacking.  Then you have someone like Stephen King who is equally good at both.  (And yes, I'm sure that many of you will vote this review as unhelpful just because of those opinions, but that's your prerogative.)<br /><br />At any rate, Dan Brown is someone who knows how to tell a good story.  However, he writes at less than a seventh grade level.  His writing style reminds me of that email circulated a few years back with examples of the world's worst metaphors, containing sentences like, \\"The bullet hurtled from the gun like a small metal object released under enormous pressure from a slim chamber.\\"  They are laughable, but the horrific thing is that Dan Brown has actually made millions of dollars with ACTUAL METAPHORS that are even worse.  From page 196 of this volume: \\"Standing beside the [conveyor] belt, they felt like weary travelers at baggage claim awaiting a mysterious piece of luggage whose contents were unknown.\\"  Well, ya don't say!  Considering that this is EXACTLY WHAT THEY WERE DOING, waiting on a package with unknown contents, the best one can say for Brown is that at least he changed his \\"metaphor\\" so that it took place in an airport.  Pathetic.  My junior high English teacher would never have let a student get away with such writing.<br /><br />The story IS an interesting one, and I'm sure everyone here knows all about it by now.  I think that if Christian groups hadn't kicked up such a fuss about the story, this book would have died a slow death years ago.  But they can always be counted upon to boost the bottom line of movies and books that no one would have given much thought to otherwise, so now Brown can join Martin Scorcese and Mel Gibson in thanking his lucky stars for them, and the fat sums of money they've brought to his door.  As for me, I quickly grew annoyed with Brown's R.L. Stine-ish habit of cutting off chapters after less than a page -- sometimes after less than a PARAGRAPH -- just to keep people in suspense a little longer for the next underwhelming revelation.<br /><br />This version of the book is very well put together.  The pages are far better quality than your average hardcover; very glossy and heavy; harder to tear.  The pictures are in full, rich color, and it's not just the paintings and buildings, but people mentioned, and many of the symbols.  Sometimes the layout is annoying; because instead of repeating a picture or referencing it in a footnote, they force readers to flip backwards and forwards at times, looking for the image to go along with the text.  The editors could have done a tighter job syncing them up properly.<br /><br />This book is a fun read, and obviously the movie is upon us, which will bring even more of the mentioned paintings, buildings, and history to life.  If only for the reason that people will learn about these things, I am happy it's happening.  As for Brown, I'm sure we'll get another witless book from him at some point, since rich writers never seem to be able to just retire at the top of their game and instead keep kicking around the same dead horse/character to see how much more cash they can milk from it (see Thomas Harris), and I'm equally as sure that I'll wind up reading it at some point, if only because I always seem to disappoint myself this way.  It's likely too much to hope that he'll have learned to write any better by then, but since we don't seem to care about his amateur-hour writing skills, it won't be any skin off his nose, or money out of his pocket either way.  So let's just keep our fingers crossed that the story will still be at least moderately interesting.
B0009MWEN0|5.0|Starship Trooper enthralled me by its non-stop action littered with special effects and engrossing adventure where courage and determination play an essential role.  The story lines are simples, if not common, but it is an action movie and it is whitin the action packed and thrilling suspence that life display its greatest emotion.  A must see!
1400032717|5.0|Having been a middle school teacher for 29 years and then   <br />a librarian for the last 6 years of my career, I find that the  <br />most memorable books, the ones that truly stay with me, are  <br />those written about young people who have \\"special needs.\\"  I <br />probably couldn't tell you what Grisham's last book was about, <br />or Evanovich's or Sanford's, but I can remember almost every <br />detail in \\"Loser\\" by Jerry Spinelli, \\"Extremely Loud and  <br />Incredibly Close\\" by Jonathan Saffron Foer, and \\"Holes\\" by <br />Louis Sachar.   <br />   While I read \\"Curious Incident\\" over a year ago, I can  <br />still recall 15-year-old Christopher's plight.  A young boy <br />with autism bases his day on how many cars of a certain <br />color he sees on his bus ride to school.  He is freaked out by <br />people touching him and has a father who tries to be understand- <br />ing of his needs, difficult they may be.  I was awestruck at the <br />quest he undertook and could feel so deeply his fears.   <br />   I look at the author, Mark Haddon, and wonder how he could <br />have written such a touching, knowledgeable novel without having <br />maybe walked in Christopher's shoes. I so loved this book and <br />read it in one sitting.  It opened up am understanding of autism, as we never had autistic children at my school.
B00080ZG10|4.0|A nice approach to a very complex person and subject.  Could have been done in a shorter time, and I found the juxtaposition of the time line to detract from the historical validity of the film.  I am not sorry that I purchased it, however.
B000654YRY|5.0|This is the very best DVD ever. Period. Solid Rock is done really<br /><br />well, and it is one of my favorite DS songs ever! Period. Very<br /><br />great work. This dvd is recommended for any rock fan!
B00000J2PH|5.0|This album has become not so much the \\"must have\\" CD in any collection as the \\"if you don't have it why not?\\".<br /><br /> It is a beautiful work and is brim full of many of Kings most notable and recognisable works. It has grown to become more than an album for melochony and self reflective moments, undoubtedly it's original intention, now it suits any ocassion and is more likely to induce group singing than solitary reflection.<br /><br /> Quite possibly the most noteworthy work by any living female artist, it's position in todays chart is testament to that.<br /><br /> If by any chance you have never heard any it, though frankly only new born children could really make the claim if they were able, then a most delicious and humbling treat awaits you and doubtless King will become a best friend to you very soon as she already is to countless millions. Listening is like wearing a favourite pair of jim jams, sitting in front of a roaring fire on a cold winters day, having had a delicious hot soak in the tub and eating a yummy winter warmer with a glass of best Chablis; a life affirming moment or three.
B000001DTM|5.0|Probably the finest album of the 1990s.  Achtung Baby boasts timeless music that will fit in with the centuries to come. <br /> <br />Only one thing to say to the review and reviewer below this: <br /> <br />GG NO RE
B00005QZ82|5.0|One of my very very favorite romantic comedys.Have watched it many times. Meg Ryan and Kevin Kline were a delight to see together. Enjoyed the soundtrack a lot and shooting on local in France really enhanced the film.Beside the light comedy I felt another message came thru,How real Love can manifest itself...
B0006L16N8|5.0|Probably the number one music album of 2005.  Coldplay show once more that they want to be remembered as musical greats.  While not quite at the level of U2 (they will be required to release at least 2 or 3 more great albums before even comparisons could be drawn to Bono's group) they are certainly taking the beginning of the 21st century by storm. <br /> <br />Those who enjoyed the previous 2 albums by this group should be well at home with this new release - there is plenty of new material all in the style that only Coldplay could create.  While there isn't a potentially life-changing song like \\"The Scientist\\" on this album (\\"Fix You\\" comes close) the overall material is outstanding. <br /> <br />A must have album for any Coldplay fan, or anyone who appreciates good music of this kind.
B0002IQHZM|3.0|I can't agree that this is the \\"Donovan done it right\\" CD,or a magnificent return to form,...or even the comments about Donovan's  \\"crystalline voice\\" seem a bit off to me. <br /> <br />#1 This is a pretty good album,and it's not too embarrassing in content.....for a better modern album buy \\"Sutras\\"! <br /> <br />#2 Why do older re-appearing artists feel the need to sing of \\"stepping off of this mortal coil\\"(so to speak),...or worse they feel the need to get all \\"sexy\\"(?) with some song's content?  \\"Yin My Yang\\" is pretty palid,and the \\"groaner\\" of a track here. While \\"Do Not Go Gentle\\" is a bit out of kilter sounding,not to mention a bit tired sounding too.....not \\"horrible\\" but a bit sad. <br /> <br />#3 I bought this with a few of the new UK re-issues of \\"classic period\\" Donovan titles(Mellow Yellow,and Sunshine Superman),and his \\"crystalline voice\\" is not shining here on BEAT CAFE.  He's got a bit of an \\"age-warble\\" and the potentially beautiful track SHAMBHALA is marred by Donovan's out of key voice!  This is a sin that never would have passed by a younger Donovan! <br /> <br />All in all, SUTRAS is the revitalized Donovan album to get,or just scoff up a few of those re-issued classic CDs.  Mellow Yellow,Sunshine Superman,and Donovan Live(the 1960's LP with the egg/bird drawing cover)have enough of that crystalline voice and beat-jazz stylings to keep you happy for days! <br /> <br />Get this album last. It's not all bad ,but it's not killer,either. <br />
B0002OERI0|3.0|2 great songs.  Some uneccesary swearing.  That's about it. <br /> <br />GG NO RE.
B000020617|5.0|\\"There Is Nothing Left to Lose\\" by Foo Fighters can be described as a very good mix of song styles.  Songs such as \\"Learn to Fly\\" and \\"Aurora\\" seem to be very radio-friendly and even a more \\"easy listening\\" type of Foo Fighters rock.  \\"Breakout\\" and \\"Stacked Actors\\" are seemingly more rock oriented, more of what you would expect from the Foos.  A very solid album, with very catchy and melodic songs that are basically good for any age group.  There really is not a weak track on the album, which makes it even better; just pop it in and listen to it all the way through.  Foo fans, and all rock fans, I strongly recommend this album for you.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|Celtic music has a certain uniqueness and elegance that is unparalleled.  The singers in this album live up to the standards and expectations that have come to be. <br /> <br />Beautiful voices, beautiful music, beautiful album.
B0009HLDFU|5.0|\\"In Your Honor\\" can, in all honesty, be called the Foo Fighters greatest release to date; spanning two completely different spectrums in a two-disk, twenty song epic album, which is worth every penny of the price.    Disk one is exactly what you would expect from the Foo Fighters from their previous releases.  Songs with great lyrics, and even greater guitar riffs and percussion, which have made this band so well known and so successful in the music they make.  Strong, energetic and emotional songs like \\"Best Of You\\" and \\"Free Me\\" are very infectious, and never boring, which makes the first disk a classic Foo Fighters release.  This half of the album shows why the Foos have stuck with this style of music; it is very enjoyable music to listen to, and they are very good at writing it and playing it.    Disk two expands the musical horizons of the band by extreme leaps and bounds.  These songs are so far on the opposite side of the normal Foo Fighters spectrum that you may think it would not work out for them.  This half of the album, however, truly shows the musical talent that this band possesses.  The first three songs on disk two (\\"Still\\", \\"What If I Do?\\", and \\"Miracle\\") could be considered some of the greatest works this band has produced; even though they do not fit in the same category with the songs they have written and played on their previous albums.  All in all, the second disk of the album is a magnificent step forward for the band.    Will the Foos abandon their trade-mark style of music?  Hopefully not.  But will they use the new found success in creating softer, acoustic music to their repertoire?  Hopefully yes.  Fans of the Foos, and those of you who enjoy catchy rock songs and well-written, easy-listening acoustic/softer rock songs, you should definitely look into buying this one.  A near instant classic, and even, dare we say, \\"masterpiece\\", from the Foo Fighters.    This is more of a personal statement, and I know those of you who put your CDs intoiPod and the like are disappointed that you can't with this CD, but I'm sure that some people out there do not care for the dozens of reviews that only say \\"I can't put the songs in my iPod and iTunes\\".  Some of the people might rather read what others might think of the MUSIC, not the \\"copy-protection.\\"  I feel its such a shame to see such great music with such a low rating due to the excessive number of \\"reviews\\" about the copy-protection.  One such review is enough.
B00007BHOE|5.0|This is by far the best DVD in my entire collection. Well worth the money. It's even better because I recently had the chance to see them in concert. The DVD doesn't do them justice, but it is still amazing! I can't wait to see the DVD for the Subliminal Verses Tour! Hopefully that will be sometime in the not-too-distant future!
0385335482|4.0|Reading this McFiction is ecapism at it's PUREST! - She's living in MAJOR debt and the rich smart dude totally falls for her and she gets a TV job.  Nevermind that she makes a complete idiot of herself about a jazillion times throughout the book, she should've shredded her credit cards a lot sooner.  I'm starting to think that Kinsella has a talent for writing narratives about really dumb heroines who don't know when to stop being clueless.  It would almost be funnier if she wrote about a SMART heroine with bad luck who manages to overcome a bunch of BS that is thrown at her. . . . hmmmm.  I still want to read her sequels though . . . the plot twists are really good.  Let the hilarity ensue.
B0007Z4S4C|1.0|....I won't have to ever spend my money on another Plant album in the future.  Oh, Robert, what have you done with yourself?  From the meandering days of the Honeydrippers, to finding your soul with Principles of Moments, to the rocket vocals on Manic Nirvana, but then.....the crash and burn album Dreamland and the cleaning out the shelves for a few dollars on Timbuktu, it comes full circle to the Mighty Rearranger.  Dreamland was surely a cure for insomnia, and Timbuktu was an unnecessary walk down memory lane, what the heck is this album?  Are you truly reaching for 'Higher Ground' if you don't dance with the woman who brought ya to the dance?  I don't get it, you are a rocker true and true, but you continue to release these albums that show little soul or musical talent.  Let's hear some rockin riffs, not this pseudo new-age stuff that leaves the majority of your fans wondering if they are holding a 'fools gold' type of album.  You phoned in this performance, and I'm happy to say that my Robert Plant collection is complete.  I have all the albums, and after this '3rd strike', you're out.
0385338082|5.0|I feel so guilty for liking this book, but c'mon - she gets plastered on an airplane flight and blabs all her x-rated secrets to the hot dude next to her who turns out to be her new boss - CLASSIC!  The ending seemed a bit anti-climactic, but it's all worth it for the funny intro, plus the American PR dude is named Jack and he's actually smart. - awesome.
B00005JM8V|5.0|'Shoah' is one program in a million.       It's not for the faint-of-heart.  Although there are no grisly images, the pictures invoked by the words contained from the testimonies herein are far more material than photographs can ever do justice to.    There's no easy way to sum up 'Shoah'; it's simply a life-changing documentary.
B000002UA7|3.0|I first bought this album on vinyl, later again on cassette, and finally on CD - It was my introduction to this artist's very distinctive music, and the selection of tracks, given the original LP format and time frame of covered work, is a worthy assortment - There's not much I will attempt to add to what others have written here about her music and these songs, EXCEPT:<br /><br />The sound on this CD is among the worst analog-to-digital mastering jobs I've ever heard, definitely the worst I've heard on a major label release - The cassette sounded better on my Walkman than this CD does on my home stereo - It's straight LP master tape to digital transfers like this that gave CDs such a bad rap when they were first introduced onto the market - Any amateur home recordist knows that audio needs to be very expressly mastered, in terms of EQ & dynamics/compression especially, for the medium on which it is to be listened to (excuse my clumsy syntax) - The art and science of remastering has dramatically improved in the past 15+ years since CDs became the predominant medium and the subsequent reissue of thousands of classic recordings - It is long overdue for this album to be rereleased in an expanded and remastered edition, along with Kate's other albums for that matter - With an artist of Kate Bush's reputation and broad appeal, I can't think of what they're waiting for - If Capitol Records did such a phenomenal job with remastering all those classic 50s/60s lounge records for the Ultra-Lounge series (which I highly recommend), then they ought to be able to do as good or better with this music - It certainly deserves better than what we're getting here...
B000002IHD|5.0|I am now thoroughly convinced that Otis is not just the greatest early loss of life in pop music. Otis is the man, hands down the greatest soul singer of all time, just the perfect combination of grit and vocal ballet. Everything he does is funky, bluesy, and groovy. Most of all, his music is generous. You can hear him just pour out his heart into every note. There will never, ever be another Otis Redding. Get this CD with 'Immortal' and 'Dock of the Bay.' You will have enough soul music to last a lifetime.
630463949X|5.0|I saw this video to much years ago, but I could not buy it. <br />Fleetwood Mac is the best band of music contemporary adult and pop. I like Stevie Nicks, Lindsay Buckingham and Christie McVie (in that order) <br />Thanks.
B000002IH5|5.0|I stayed away from this CD for years simply because 'Dock of the Bay' was so overexposed. Recently, I gave this one a chance and it exceeded my expectations. I still think 'Immortal Otis' is the essential Otis Redding album. However, this one will blow you away too. He just has a way of owning a song and making it completely his. Otis has covered a few songs and they all take on new meaning, like 'Respect.'- just totally Otis. People have tried to take on Otis, as cover material, but his style is simply too unique, too much soul for any mere mortal.
B00000K0DT|2.0|Great screenwriter, great actors and great dialogue. Even Baldwin did an impressive job in this movie. But it was so boring, I couldn't keep my eyelids open. Very, very, very boring movie. I can't even emphasize it enough how boring it was! Yes, the ending was really cool, but the rest of the movie had me falling asleep. I'd rather see a very entertaining movie with a stinky ending, than a boring movie with a cool ending, any day. A cult movie is a movie with a very high repeatability factor. I wouldn't watch this twice. Maybe just to see the Jaguar at the end, love that car.
B000819PKC|5.0|pop this in your cd player and you will be shaking your arse all over the place in no time. the bass lines are especially outstanding.
B0001MDPV8|5.0|It is great. It  has a classic song on it. But this album is short and I am really dissapointed because it is a classic and I thought it was going to be better. I did not give this album a 4 because it is a classic in the hip hop world.But if you are from New York you can enjoy the album more than other people around this country. But on the Disc 2 there are 2 unreleased songs that are great.

0385512058|5.0|Ferrazzi's book provides valuable insight for people of all professions, not just those whose business is business.  All careers involve a social element, and Ferrazzi puts forth useful suggestions on how to make meaningful relationships  with the people you encounter.  Ferrazzi's advice for maintaining existing relationships and creating new ones cultivates necessary interpersonal skills. <br /> <br />The heart of Ferrazzi's method is the belief that business relationships are not about getting the most from people, but rather doing the most for them.  This warmer form of networking fosters mutually beneficial freindships that extend beyond the professional realm. <br /> <br />My biggest criticism of this book is the abundance of name-dropping, but that's to be expected from such an extroverted author who owes his success to many people.  Other than that, Ferrazzi's book is a worthwhile read.
B0006284JQ|2.0|A greatest hits is typical of a band or artist who has been around 10 or so years and has released numerous albums to pick from. Britney Spears in her seven years in the music business has released four albums. After \\"Oops...\\", her sound changed to a more techno dance-pop, electronic sound, with sexually pumped up lyrics. She didn't chart as high or sell as many copies. Then she makes headlines for her odd behavior and love life. She then notices that she is not the top draw anymore. So she decides to take a \\"break\\", but before that, she will release a Greatest Hits collection containing three new songs, one of them a cover of a much overrated 80's hit, the other two generic dance songs. People are used to Britney flaunting her sexual energy, it's not new or shocking anymore.     Greatest Hits is Britneys last attempt to strike oil in the music business, but people are realizing the fluff and excess that is \\"her music\\", and the well is running dry. In the terms of what is hot in music today, Britney is another flash in the pan has been, and her music isn't legendary and never is going to be. A few of her songs might get airtime on variety hit radio, but that's about it now.     The album itself? It is a mismatch of styles. The album is  poorly ordered, and switches from teenage bubblegum and adult dance-pop quickly back and forth. You also realize one thing from listening to this album: the hits were bigger than they should have been. The image quickly took over the talent. And with the career in jeopardy and the image tainted, Britney thought one more stab with old hits and new hits could give her some money while she \\"takes some time off.\\" Britneys music career is in trouble, no doubt, and \\"Greatest Hits\\" is not going to help her cause.
B00003CX96|5.0|When a friend of mine came home from indiana University in the late 70's and told me he'd been an extra in a movie filmed on campus...well, I just had to see it just to see the 1/2 second scene my friend is in. But something else happened----and I get that feeling everytime this movie is on TV. This simple, somewhat low budget film hits my top 10 classic films of all time. The characters are us---we can identify with them. And although as one person wrote, then ending is expected--it still gives you a great feeling when the \\"cutters\\" win. So--buy it if you haven't seen it. You'll watch it again.
B00007GZQZ|3.0|I love this movie, but in the DVD version there are some scenes that are missing. The entire sequence where they spend there first night in the house and actually break the step is totally left out! Also the scene with the trees falling is cut short. Those were the two I noticed but there may be more. Why do studios do this? It is a total letdown to fans.
B0009ML238|5.0|Yes It does have elements of Symphony X and Dream Theater, but it has what Symphony X and Dream Theater to a lesser extent lacks are the powerful and emotional choruses. The guitarist is great (he's no Romeo or Petrucci, but nobody is) and i think the singer is absolutely excelent. This album has the emotion and the talent which I think gives it its own sound.
B0007QJ1MK|2.0|There are about 3 standout tracks on this album; MEDICATION, EVERYBODY KNOWS YOU'RE INSANE, LITTLE SISTER. So far I've forced myself to listen to the full album six times to round out my initial dissapointment. There is no punk/garage rock vibe on any of these songs. I guess Nick took that over to his own project Mondo    Generator. Lanegan doing lead vocals on one song? No chilling morose numbers here. So because of the fact two of the three core members/songwriters of this group has parted ways with the other  there is a noticeable lacking. There aren't any dramatic methamphetamine fueled freakouts (Oliveri) nor is there any delicate sadness (Lanegan.) No HANGING TREE, ...MILLIONAIRE, IN THE FADE, TENSION HEAD, etc. Homme is my least favorite vocalist of the three (even though Oliveri's screaming can be a bit annoying at times.) Everything is so drab here the unusual big/warm/fuzzy/middle-eastern/Sabbath tone of Josh's guitar sounds more tame than ever. There are some cool solos cranked out but the synergy of the band is not here on this album. It's more like a solo project and often those are much less interesting than a member's band offering. I might have given this a 3 star had I not paid the extra $$$ for the deluxe edition with the dvd. Boy, was I a sucker. No live footage?! That's what made the bonus dvd of SONGS FOR THE DEAF. Here's to a Oliveri, Lanegan, and Homme reunion.
B00005K9QP|5.0|Rumor has it that when Eric Clapton set up his Marshall JTM combo to do this session, the engineer put the mike in it's usual close up position. Clapton moved it some distance away, plugged in his late 50's Les Paul and turned the amp up all the way. Whe he hit that first gliss in \\"All Your Love\\", the whole concept of how electric blues guitar was played, changed in an instant. Drenched with sustain and grit, Clapton powered through the material with unheard of intensity, bringing a unique interpetation of his influences which at that time seemed to be primarily Buddy Guy, Otis Rush, and of course Freddie King. <br /> <br />I will agree with those who feel Mayall's vocals are not up to the level of rest of the playing on this album. But they are certainly passable, and do nothing to detract from Clapton's virtuosity. Listen to his snarling bends on the opening track, his relaxed fluidity on Hideaway, and the smoldering intensity he displays on the albums slow blues, \\"Double Crossing Time\\" and \\"Have You Heard\\". <br /> <br />This album is an absolute must for any electric blues fan.
B000002G7E|5.0|I first bought \\"White Light/White Heat\\" along with \\"The Velvet Underground and Nico\\" when I caught a television special that featured them among many other late sixties acts.  While their debut is by far the more easier album to take in, it was tough for me to get into this one at first.  But there came that one day where I just popped it in the Cd player and spaced out to what is the most trippy mixture of folk music, 60's R&B, and fusion jazz that anyone will ever hear.  The album for the first half is pretty laid back for the most part.  The song \\"Here She Comes Now\\" might not seem like much at first but its the last peaceful moment on the album leading up to the distorted assault that makes up \\"I Heard Her Call My Name\\" and the 17+ minute, \\"Sister Ray\\".  Some may knock those two tracks but I say they make the album what it is.  It is grunge and punk before either really existed.  I can't imagine would it would have been like to hear this when it was new because even today, its sounds ahead of it's time.
B00005JNSK|4.0|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is a fantasy film based on the popular children's novel written by Roald Dahl. This movie stars Johnny Depp in the lead role, joined by a cast that includes some old and new names in Hollywood.<br /><br />What I enjoyed most about this movie was the visual effects. The scene with the squirrels checking the nuts; the scene with the young girl transforming into a blueberry; etc. are creative and fun. In addition to the visuals, there is plenty of music to keep viewers entertained, with a full soundtrack of songs written by Danny Elfman.<br /><br />Depp is great as the eccentric yet friendly Willy Wonka, and he exhibits a certain degree of charm that makes his character intriguing. The kids are also very good, and each one of the five children (the ones who win the right to tour the factory) has his/her own unique personality that is brought to his/her respective roles. The older people in the movie are ok, but not necessarily anything spectacular. Depp and the five children command most of the screen throughout the film, so you don't really notice the older people very much.<br /><br />This film is similar to the plot taken by the novel it is based on, but there are a few changes, like one would expect. One change that I didn't particularly care for was the subplot where Mr. Wonka has flashbacks to his childhood and later tries to patch up his relationship with his dad. I think the film would have been better if this was left out.<br /><br />Most people will think of this as an immature movie, but I liked it more and more as I watched. The fast pace, the cast, the music, and, most importantly, the visual effects make this a movie for everyone to see.
B0009K7ROI|5.0|This is the best that I've heard \\"The Father of British Bues\\" sound in years. It seems that he is at his best when he has something to say, and say it he does. I've been a Mayall fan since 1967 so we mustn't forget that he was part of the social protests of that era. The Bluesbreakers are fabulous as always and fill out the tunes quite nicely. I had a chance to attend a club show just prior to the release of the CD. The show was fantastic! Afterwards I was fortunate to chat with John. Filled with  vim, vigor and vip, Mayall's energy seemed endless. It's this energy on \\"Road Dogs\\" that makes it a must for the Mayall fan.
B0000640SA|5.0|You remember that SNL skit where Tom Hanks can't seem to remember anything for more than a few moments?  Well that is essentially what this movie is about.  Leonard (don't call him Lenny) is in search of the man that raped and murdered his wife.  It was during this attack that Leonard was injured and has since not been able to make any new memories. <br /> <br />Since Leonard can't form any new memories he has to rely on a system to direct his investigation.  His system includes polaroids, notes, and freaky tattooes.  All of these are to remind him of what he is doing.  He even has to remind himself to hate. <br /> <br />If you are looking for a suspenseful movie where you are forced to watch every minute of the movie then this is for you.  The movie actually works itself back from the present.  It is as if you are watching the end first.  As details are \\"relived\\" you get to see just how twisted this movie and the people in it can be.   <br /> <br />I usually know exactly what is going to happen in a movie by the first ten minutes.  I did not see the ending (beginning) of this one coming.  So if you are in for a very surprising and twisted ending (beginning) then this is the movie for you.
B0001LJC2K|4.0|I first discovered Muse by seeing their eery \\"Stockholm Syndrome video. After hearing a live performance of \\"Sing for Absolution\\" I was convinced and bought the album. I must say, that this is one of the best albums of 2003. Muse is definitely one of the most underappreciatted bands in the United States.
B00000I0XW|4.0|Sarah Brightman is generally at her best when she sings songs written by Andrew Lloyd Webber. This release of her singing Webber's songs isn't without flaws but more of the fault lies with the material with what she does with it. This isn't meant as a slur against Webber's work either. Artists all have their share of hits and misses and Webber is no exception. Brightman covers some of his best work here but (unfortunately) she covers some of the rest too.<br /><br />The first four songs on the disc are lovely to the point where they stand with the best material from any genre. \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\" is (by now) rightly one of the more familiar pieces of music in existence. Even twenty years in the hands of a media that's tried to wear it hasn't stifled its freshness. Brightman follows it with lovely deliveries of \\"Unexpected Song\\" and \\"Chanson D'Enfance\\". the former allows her to soar to the very top of her register without straining or becoming shrill while the latter draws the best from her delicious mid-range. This is like the feel of fine silk gliding across skin. Her partner on \\"All I Ask of You\\" (this time around) is Cliff Richard. His voice is a bit flat alongside hers at times (like a pancake involved in a duet with a souffl&eacute;) but in the end the song wins the day. These two harmonize exceptionally well on some beautiful passages of music. It's impossible not to be touched by it.<br /><br />Many of the other pieces included adhere to the same high standard. \\"Another Suitcase in Another Hall\\" is perfectly suited to Brightman's voice. She caresses some of the passages like a lover and penetrates others like a heated crystal lance shearing through butter. This is as close as music ever comes to combining pure sexuality with a sense of naive innocence.  \\"Memory\\", in either of its forms is a lovely piece. The English version is performed here and Brightman gives it the loving touch it deserves. Her duet with Sir John Gielgud (he talks-she sings), Gus: The Theatre Cat, is a wonderful character piece delivered with all the warmth and affection due both the material and the talents of the performers involved. Gielgud became a legend during his lifetime and this shows why. The musical passages (particularly the verses in the middle of the song) serve as a reminder of how well Sarah Brightman handles theatrical pieces. This number could well be a gesture of respect to each other as much as their rendition is to the song.<br /><br />\\"Tell Me On a Sunday\\" is a ravishingly beautiful song and Brightman's voice is up to the task of doing it justice. The vocal acrobatics required force her voice to its limits at times but she's always in complete control of her voice. Webber's production is \\"extra-lush\\" on this one but never to the point of drowning the music (or her). The set closes with three of his most beautiful pieces. \\"Pie Jesu\\" gets a gentle treatment that's filled with reverence for both the material and the subject matter. \\"Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again\\" is one of her \\"signature songs\\". This song and \\"The Music of the Night\\" will always (not unjustly) be associated with her. She always \\"owned the former and while Michael Crawford may have been the first to sing the latter she now pulls emotional depth from this song that he and others can only dream of finding. Nothing more can be said.<br /><br />There are weak points on the disc. \\"Don't Cry for Me Argentina\\" has some strong passages but never feels concise. The duet with (Jos&eacute;) Carreras is a disappointment. As a rule this man's work is something to be cherished but his singing on \\"Amigos Para Siempre\\" sounds forced. It's as if he was trying for an effect that he didn't believe in himself. \\"Love Changes Everything\\" which would be good if it had another line or two of music in it. As things stand the same verses are sung repeatedly with extra layers of instrumentation added for variety.  \\"Anything But Lonely\\" is a beautiful song but it's over produced (imagine swimming in a vat of maple syrup) to the point of wallowing in its own orchestration. At times Brightman has to bellow to be heard. \\"Macavity: the Mystery Cat is a jazzy little number that improves with repeated listening. The arrangement (which hearkens to the big band era) packs a good punch but Sarah's performance falls short. This material needs a crooner willing to \\"belt it out\\". She succeeds at times but there are moments when the material demands a more gutsy roar than she's willing (or perhaps able) to give.<br /><br />This set is a good value though. The recorded sound is excellent. The weaker material on the disc is by no means bad. The strongest material included is excellent. Eight of the numbers are so good they're phenomenal. Even at her weakest moment Brightman still sounds pretty good. At her best (which is on almost all of the set) she's virtually untouchable. The marriage between her and Webber may have been less perfect but their musical match-up is a different matter.<br /><br />That one was made in heaven.ine swimming in a vat of maple syrup) to the point of wallowing in its own orchestration.

B00028HBKC|4.0|The story is quite famous. And its message about sacrifice and love is most definitely memorable. James Caviezel (Jesus) does a good job. Though in retrospect, he didn't have much of a script to work with. Much of the movie is about the actual torturing and executing of Christ. So he basically screams and wails a lot as he is sliced, stabbed, whipped, and crucified. But there are some early dialogues that are good. He plays the emotion of the Christ (a disturbed mind knowing of his betrayal and imminent capture, the angry defiance in the high courts, the psychological pain of humiliation and public torture, the sorrow of feeling forsaken by peers and God himself, the forgiving and proud resurrection ect.). He doesn't play the script of Christ, he plays the affect of Christ; and does it quite well. Maria Morgenstern is a convincing Virgin Mary. And I think as far as acting goes, her and Monica Belllucci (Magdalene) steal the show by virtue of lengthier scripts reveling the innards of their talents. I was quite impressed with character of the Virgin. Morgenstern very convincingly portrayed Mary's story. A movie about Mary has yet to be made; but if it is done, I think it has serious potential at the box office. At the end of the film a lot of people were crying; and I think that the reason for this, other than spirituality or all that suffering shown in the movie, is that Morgenstein painted a picture of Mary that is a little different and very effective. In essence it starts off as an insane worrying of the news of her son's arrest; then the affect progresses to the intensence tearful sorrow and shock when her and Magdelene are watching the various brutal beatings and execution, getting sprayed by his blood, flinching on every fall of the hammer, to the silent and very angry confrontation with the Head Jewish Priest/Rabbi after the Crucifixion. The actors on the Roman side (Pilate) were also convincing. The partier king Herrod was an amusing twist (most likely the only funny part in the movie). If you are a Christian, the movie may draw tears. If you are a Jew, you might get pissed off. Or you might feel sad that someone had to suffer so much for what we sometimes take for granted in America, freedom of speech. If neither, you may like the movie for its costumes, scenery, and special effects (gore). The scenes showing the mind-bending sorrow and horror of Mary were quite sad. The costumes were great. And the special effects were bordering Oscar worthiness. I have never watched a more convincing and lengthy torture scene. It looked very real! The act of crucifixion looked real too. There are a lot ways of looking at a figure like Christ; and this is one such way. Though if you really want to know him, I suggest picking up a bible or speaking to a Christian. There are of course some shortfalls to the movie. Basically, the Character of Jesus is only defined in the most rudimentary sense. And the movie makes Jews look like utter monsters. Despite the visual accomplishments of the special effects crew, I highly doubt that any man could have withstood that kind of torture and still made it to the cross. My medical knowledge is telling me that there would be no way...it would have ended with blood loss and hypovolemic shock. So there could be an issue of accuracy as well. I don't think the Jews were that brutal. And Gibson is treading somewhat dangerous ground with his reputation. But it is a predictable thing; directors often opt for a more sellable and sensational story than a less sensational accurate recreation (there are many examples of this). So at times you see the sappy chess game tactics Hollywood uses to suck money out of people. And at times it kind is does make itself a little obvious. This excessive beating is likely just be a ploy by Gibson to sucker Christians into crying and shelling out cash for the tickets, books, pay per views, Premium services, and DVD's. And that is somewhat repugnant. But hey, it wouldn't be thefirst time Hollywood did that. So, I can cut Gibson a little slack by virtue of the nature of his business and his being new to directing. Though from the response of the public, I guess some others felt otherwise.
B0002IQJUK|5.0|I absolutely love Gavin and all of the songs are great!  I can't wait for his next album!
B00005UW9T|5.0|Okay, so some people criticize this movie by saying it is not an accurate adaptation of the political and historical events going on at that time. Well, how exactly DO you intend to incorperate the (rather grim) history into a children's movie? <BR>And that is exactly what it is: a movie for CHILDREN. It's supposed to be FUN, not teach you history. If you want to see a portrait for the political struggles in Russia at that time - go read a book about it! <BR>Yes, the movie's characters are portrayed as black and white - the Romanovs are good, Rasputin is bad. Has it ever been different in Disney movies (yes, I do realize this is not a Disney movie)? Yes, maybe Lenin would've made a more logical bad guy, but Lenin didn't have magic powers (as far as that goes, Rasputin is the way more interesting character). Why yes, maybe they should have portrayed the hardships of revolution and the two years that the Romanov family had been held captive. Why YES, maybe they should have made Alexei a sickly boy and the whole thing utterly hopeless. It would have been more realistic and appealing to all you fine members of the politically aware adults. But no seven-year-old (as I was at the time I watched this movie) would be particularly interested in that kind of story.<BR>As to my personal opinion, I love this movie. The songs (&quot;Once Upon a December&quot; is beautiful), the characters, the dialogue, the graphics, the mood, everything is just stunning. Sometimes it gets a little mushy, I suppose, as in the starting scene - but those parts are easy to overlook when viewing the wonderful whole.
B00005JN0T|5.0|I thought this was a great movie, and for any Will Smith Fan, it is a must see!  Very inventive idea, action packed, and will keep you at the edge of your seat!
B000002U82|5.0|Dark Side of the Moon is one of the few albums I have vivid memories of when I first heard it.  I can still feel the first bass hits when Breathe started to play, it's a momentous feeling.  I have still yet to hear music that flows with such finesse in the current music industry.   <br /> <br />    Dark Side is commonly looked at as the best album Pink Floyd ever released, I disagree but it is definitely one of their best.  As with almost all Floyd albums they are best enjoyed listening all the way through and not skipping.
B00005JNSK|3.0|Tim Burton is original and creative, there's no denying. Johnny Depp is daring and talented, no doubt. So, putting the two together would seem like a reasonable idea. And to start off with, it usually is. I felt that Willie Wonka was similar to Edward Scissorhands in that the first twenty minutes are wonderful, and you're sure you're gonna love it, and then suddenlly, as if they sensed your unwanted approval, the infamous duo reels off into a land all their own, generating laughs from some and bewildered head shakes from many more. I think this film could have been much better if Burton had stuck with the mood of the beggining and if Depp had been given a bit more amusing dialogue/action. But Depp's fiesty, almost sinister, portrayal did amuse in several moments and Burton's larger-than-live, colorful directing is fun to watch. I also liked how they slyly implied their other collaborations(when Depp is cutting the tape with scissors in the air, the skulls on the candy, etc.) If weird isn't your flavor, avoid. If a touch of the bizzare makes you grin, go for it. All in all I think Burton's Chocolate is an aquired taste.
B000000P17|1.0|The stertorous sounds in the album reflect the band's agonizing last moments. At its very centre, the theme, as we find out if unlucky enough to purchase this lemon, is simply Rose's last temper tantrum driven by an overblown ego and the belief that he is the band. Gone are Slash's spirit and the band's pretence of staying together. No good.
B000002HJD|5.0|This is really good and interesting. I think of the word \\"primal\\" everytime I listen to this. It is mostly about death, birth and sometimes what takes place in-between. The music is real good. It sets the precise mood for each of Jim's poems. It's eerie, like the whole band is in one room cutting a track together but that wasn't the case. You can't compare this to the Doors recordings because the music is different. The bandmates did Jim Morrison right on this recording. Don't try to make sense of the poetry though. I suppose it's just a menagerie of phrases which Jim had collected which sometimes amounts to word salads. He doesn't stay on a topic for long. But he had a talent for imagery for sure. Some of it is reference to philosophy. Sometimes he confronts the gods with wishes or rhetorical questions. The excerpt where Jim describes his early death experience is interesting. They weave some Doors song passages together to help Jim's storytelling along which works perfectly. This recording will haunt you every time you pick it up. I still can't figure out what a \\"bait-headed mongrel\\" is. Some of the phrases are really clever and insightful: \\"the hitchhiker... leveled his thumb in the calm calculus of reason.\\" Which is what every hitchhiker actually does if you think about it: he has to reason what he may or may not encounter before he enters the highway. And I never thought someone could compare a handshake with a sexual organ but Jim Morrison found a way. This is the reissue which has \\"Bird of Prey\\" which I really don't like. It's like he's fixated on this little nursery ryhme melody which only contains a few words. I don't know if you get to know Jim any better after listening to this recording. He still remains a mystery to me. This is worth the listen and it opens with the the sober statement: \\"Awake\\".
B000067J1Q|5.0|This is a timeless tale of a novice nun named Maria (Julie Andrews) who is sent to be a governess for the seven von Trapp children. Their father, the autocratic widowed Captain von Trapp (Christopher Plummer), is big on authority and discipline; he uses whistles to call them, has them line up by age, wear uniforms, etc. But the arrival of the freewheeling Maria changes all of that. She introduces spirit, fun, and best of all music back into the house. The true tearjerker is when the Captain joins his children in singing the title song to the Baroness (Eleanor Parker). She not only captures the hearts of his seven children, but ends up capturing the captain's heart as well. The attraction is immediate, but it's not until later in the movie that the attraction is realized with the breathtaking 'Laendler'. That does not, however, mean it's not present. Try the scene where Maria and the Captain are yelling at each other- can you say sexual tension? The impending Anschluss adds an element of danger to the story, and the acerbic Baroness keeps the story from being too sugary. <br /> <br />I am a definite devotee of this film. Christopher Plummer makes a dashing Captain, Richard Haydn is an irreverent Max Dettweiler, and Eleanor Parker gives another splendid performance as the Baroness.  <br />But it's Julie Andrews who steals the show. She *is* Maria, wholly and completely. With her breathtaking voice and superb acting skills, she takes this glorious film to a whole new dimension. This film is without a doubt the best musical ever made.
B0001ADB8C|5.0|Before beginning to tell all the adventages of this wonderful box, I will say my only complaint about it: It's sad that it only covers the \\"Dark Horse Years\\" while the other albums are so expensive, rare and in such bad quality... Otherwise, it lacks some important tracks that could have been added as bonus, but anyway, the importanti s that this box is a Must Have. <br /> <br />George Harrison was a man of taste, and the visual quality of the box surely respects his last words. Trust me, buy it 'cause even if you don't like the music, it will make a beautiful decoration... Just take a look at the booklet with transparent sheets and interesting texts and photos, or the interface of the dvd... incredible! <br /> <br />But Enought said about the apparence, let's talk about the music. Every song here is a masterpeice. Some might say that \\"Somewhere In England\\" and \\"Gone Troppo\\" are his career's low points but in my mind, they are wonderful because of the feeling george puts in his music, you can feel what he was feeling while recording the songs on those albums, it could be playful in \\"33 & 1/3\\" or falling in love in \\"George Harrison\\". It could also be inspired and nostalgic like in \\"Cloud nine\\" or simply on vacation in \\"Gone Troppo\\". I think people don't like \\"Somewhere In England\\" because we can't really find a tone for the album, but it's a good album although. <br /> <br />Trust me, buy it, you'll be on cloud nine!
1400032717|4.0|An intelligent and engrossing book, which starts out as a mystery but ends up as an exploration of the mind and abilities of an autistic youngster. Unexpectedly, the mystery is solved well before the end of the book, and I found the transition to be a bit jarring.  Previous to this, the protagonist's insights and point of view added depth and resonance to the search for the perpetrator.  Once the mystery was solved, however, the book's focus became entirely the problems of autism, which required that this depiction be accurate.  Since I'm not entirely certain that it is, I found the latter part of the book to be a bit weaker and just a bit of a letdown.

These views provide insights into the lives and personalities of the subjects.<br /><br />This short book is an enjoyable read. It provides interesting details without boring the reader with heavy psychological analysis. Try it! You'll like it!
B0009I7NNA|5.0|Well I just took the time to read a couple reviews about this album. I read one and some guy totally dissed the band with their new sound. This cd is great, but it is not their best. I've got all 3 of A7X's albums and each one is spectacular. Yes, it may not have the big screams and the dark lyrics, but just think of it as another side to a band. Each band has got 2 sides. I admit M. Shadows whines a lot while singing, and they did make some pathetic songs but it's still a very enjoyable album. S. Gates has some perfect guitar solos and The Rev played with some extremely heavy beats. They've got a very weird choice of backround music too like in sidewinder, the wicked end, and strength of the world. It's still really good. I can't wait to see them live.
B00008OLYN|4.0|I want to start off by saying that anyone just starting to listen to Opeth would be well off to hear a few tracks off of this cd then a few tracks off of Damnation, MAYH, Still Life or one of their other heavy cds.  This cd by far does not represent Opeth's typical style(except in a more complex way then I'm going to go into). <br /> <br />This is an entirely acoustic cd, which is a first in Opeth's discography.  It is a wonderfully built cd of haunting melodies and shows their mastery of their instruments and the lyrical process. <br /> <br />I prefer the more heavy, dark, and malign sounding Opeth, but this cd makes a great break inbetween the metal.
0689835604|5.0|My 14 month old loves this book, which we just bought her.  She knows a lot of body parts, and this is a really cute way to reinforce them.  She calls the book \\"bubbles\\", which she yells when she sees the little boy in the bathtub.  We have a lot of books, and this is one of her favorites.
B00008DDXC|2.0|Okay, here I go again.  I know daring to say Harry Potter isn't the greatest thing ever means a lot of people are gonna get mad.  Fine.  I just hope someone listens to my point before deciding I'm wrong.  BECAUSE I DO HAVE A POINT. <br /> <br />I'm not a Potter fan, admittedly.  Just read my review of The Sorcerer's Stone for all my previously stated Potter complaints.  But for this film, I have a whole new gripe. <br /> <br />IT'S THE SAME EXACT STORY AS THE FIRST BOOK!  How do I know?  Because I read The Sorcerer's Stone, but I didn't see the movie.  And I watched the Chamber of Secrets, but didn't read the book.  And as I watched Chamber, I realized just how identical these two novels are. <br /> <br />Here's a short list: <br />* There's a secret room in the school where a magical artifact is kept. <br />* Inside that room is a mythological monster. <br />* Harry is almost killed in a Quidditch match, but Hermoine's magic saves him. <br />* Voldemort is trying to recreate himself. <br />* Harry ventures into the Dark Forest looking for answers and is almost killed by a supernatural creature. <br /> <br />There's more similarities, and once you start looking you'll spot them.  I know stories by the same writer with the same characters in the same setting are going to be similar, but this is just lazy. <br /> <br />What else?  Oh yeah, it's just not believable.  I'm not talking about the magic and monsters.  I like magic and monsters.  But there are logic problems when it comes to the school itself.  For instance, Harry seems to be the only one capable of saving the school.  What about all those older, more experienced wizards that run the school?  How the heck did this school survive so long if no one but a trio of students are capable of defending it? <br /> <br />And quidditch is just silly and ridiculously dangerous.  I know we muggles play sports that can end up getting you hurt, but there's a world of difference between running and jumping and tackling eachother and rocketing through the sky on a broomstick chasing after some little ball.  They don't even have any padding for crying out loud, and there's no mention of any kind of safety spell in place to break a long fall.  It seems like realistically there'd be casualties and serious injuries. <br /> <br />Realism in fantasy is tricky. The world created doesn't have to be realistic, but it must make sense.  And Harry's world is whatever Rowling wants it to be at any moment.  There's no true consistency, nor much logic.  Things just happen because they're cool scenes or neat ideas. <br /> <br />And the endings are always weak and contrived.  In Stone, Harry just touches the villain and destroys him?  That's it?  Because Harry's parents loved him?  So are we to assume the every other innocent victim killed by Voldemort was actually disliked by his/her parents?  While not all parents love their children (sad, but true), I'd like to think they're the exception, not the rule.  Apparently, wizard parents must not generally care for their kids. <br /> <br />In Chamber, just when Harry is cornered, here comes the phoenix to blind the basilisk and give Harry a magic sword?  What?  Are you kidding me?  Rowling writes her hero into a corner, and then just writes him out of it.  That's absurd.  What suspense is there when something like this can happen?  And don't tell me the phoenix was foreshadowed.  Just because you see something in advance, doesn't mean it's a clue.  If I pass a guy on the street that doesn't mean I assume he's going to push me out of the way of a runaway train later. <br /> <br />FINAL COMPLAINT:  I can't believe people actually like Harry.  Correction:  He's likable.  Blandly likable like Mickey Mouse.  Again, fans will argue.  But I challenge anyone to give Harry a noticeable character trait beyond GOOD, NICE, and PERSISTENT.  For crying out loud, he doesn't even seem to enjoy the magical world he lives in. <br /> <br />Oh, forget it.  But I shall continue to tilt at this windmill on occasion.  Not because it's bad, but because it is NOT GREAT.  So if you want to give me a negative vote, go ahead, but I'd like to point out I gave it 2 stars when it only deserved 1.  Because I'm nice like that.
6305949980|4.0|The Nightmare Before Christmas is truly a wonderful film... Incredible stop-motion animation, oustanding production design and great musical numbers. The film itself easily deserves 5 stars, and the DVD has great extras including a very interesting commentary track and two of Tim Burton's early short films.<br /><br />Just be warned, however, that this Special Edition DVD features a non-anamorphic DVD transfer. Those of you with regular 4x3 TVs won't be affected by this but if you have a widescreen TV, the quality drops significantly. The sound is top-notch and the colours are vibrant, but with regards to the video quality, I just hope that Buena Vista will give this film the anamorphic DVD treatment it deserves someday.
0790729350|5.0|I enjoyed this because, as a 49 year old person, I remember those times, but not always clearly. It's nice to have a record of my heroes as young people. As a time, we'll surely not pass that way again. It's an awesome record, a great document. Very glad to own it.
B0006L16N8|4.0|Those who are complaining about too much similar material - you are wrong. Except the starting of 'Speed of Sound', very little else is. Infact, most songs are much better than their old counterparts. The previous two albums were very innovative no doubt, but I had to keep skipping while playing some of those, whereas, the whole X&Y is good to listen to. The songs are more mature, more energized, and more thoughtful. My picks, \\"Fix You\\", \\"Square One\\", and \\"Swallowed by the Sea\\". And go blame the media for the media hype, not the artists.
B00009W0U4|5.0|This movie is very twisted, its not anything like the norm but it was very good!
B00030590I|2.0|A warrior known only as Nameless (Jet Li) presents himself to the King of Qin (Daoming Chen), who is engaged in the forceful unification of the separate lands that will one day constitute China.  Nameless claims to have slain the three master assassins (Tony Leung, Maggie Cheung, and Donnie Yen) that have dedicated themselves to destroying the King, and the king allows Nameless to come within 100 paces of the throne to relate his adventure.  When he has finished, the king has his own interpretation of events, which throws doubt on all we have heard.  Both versions are presented in flashback. <br /> <br />This film has an interesting structure and a good basic story, but ultimately emerges as an overblown homage to a tyrant.  All of the main characters are presented as beings who exist on a rarefied plane where every act and thought is fraught with nuance and philosophical implication.  This includes the King of Qin, who is not simply a conquering despot, but a selfless philosopher-king who just happens to command an enormous army and doesn't flinch at slaughtering his opponents, even when they offer no resistance, such as the passive students of a calligraphy school.  The strong jingoistic slant is perhaps not surprising, given that this is the most expensive film in Chinese history; I suppose that government cooperation does not come without strings attached. <br /> <br />In addition to the above objections, the film is just plain overblown.  I loved \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.\\"  It featured incredible wirework and beautiful cinematography as well, but it was all in service of a compelling story and a convincing romance.  Director Zhang Yimou spares no effort to outdo Ang Lee's film by straining to make every single frame beautiful with a capital B.  Everything is color-coordinated, wind-blown, perfectly lighted, and slo mo.  He seems to have forgotten that a fight scene should also be exciting. <br />
B00005JKGZ|3.0|I watched this movie all the way thru for the first time on TCM. I then put it on my list of must-have dvds. Well, I bought it and watched it beginning to end. Am I the only one who thinks the character of Tootie is slightly hysterical (re, the crying jag that precedes her beheading the snowpeople)? Kind of weird. Maybe I think this because she was playing a brat and was doing a good job of being really irritating, as brats will. Anyway, Judy Garland is terrific....as is Mary Astor, one of the greatest actresses ever; too underappreciated generally.
B00005JNDZ|3.0|Did anyone notice the similarities between Brokedown Palace with Claire Danes to Bridget's time in Thailand?  I found the wonderbra scene particularly inane and it seemed to downplay the seriousness of the imprisoned women's condition while Bridget unrealistically skips out of prison like a Catholic schoolgirl.  It just tried too hard to be humorous in the wrong places and didn't capitalize on what could have been genuinely funny.  It seemed to be one of those sequels that plays off of the funny moments from the first movie instead of creating new humor.  Also, while Daniel Cleaver was a likeable cad in the first movie, he comes off as a genuine fool in the second.  Bridget was adorable in the first movie, but just plain dumpy in this one - I couldn't figure out what Mark saw in her.  Like another reviewer said, she failed as an \\"everywoman.\\"  I could identify with her in the first movie, but if I could identify with her in this one, I would be embarrassed to admit it.  Further, Rebecca was unrecognizable (from her book character) and what kind of horrible friend is Shaza? <br /> <br />That being said, this movie wasn't unwatchable as far as entertainment value goes.  Mark Darcy was still great though the fight scene was silly and forced.  Renee Zellweger and Hugh Grant were tolerable.  Renee seemed to be a bit more of a poseur and not as \\"real\\" as her original Bridget character, but she wasn't terrible.  I would recommend this to anyone who is not a Bridget fanatic and who liked the first movie.  I am a big fan of the first movie and book, and so found this movie disappointing.
B0007N1AI6|5.0|With the last two Judas Priest albums with Ripper, I felt that the albums' problems were that the songwriting wasn't as good as it was, and for some reason they sounded really cheesy to me.  Ripper Owens, however, is a stunning vocalist who went on to replace Matt Barlow of Iced Earth and did a tremendous job there.  Still, I wondered if Priest were ever going to reform again, the way it should be.  Iron Maiden had a successful resurrection with the return of Adrian Smith and Bruce Dickinson and had two very decent albums.  However, with the latest Priest offering with Halford back, I'd have to say that I am more STUNNED than I thought I would be!  While Maiden---dare I say this, a Maiden die-hard---had a really good latest album, Priest has an instant classic in the form of \\"Angel of Retribution.\\"<br /><br />The album perfectly kicks off with Judas is Rising, which is basically saying that Priest is back!  It's an awesome rocker; it slightly reminds me of Halford's \\"Crucible\\" album.  It's followed by Deal with the Devil, which is something that sounds like it could've come off the \\"Jugulator\\" album with Ripper on vocals.  Makes me wonder what they would sound like with Halford on the mic?  Anyways, the third track is the most played on the radio from here, Revolution.  People have complained about it, but I say why carp?  It's an excellent cut, with a catchy chorus and classic guitar leads.  It greatly reminds me of their \\"Hell Bent for Leather\\" album, in particular the song Take On the World.  Worth Fighting For, the fourth track, reminds me of their album \\"Point of Entry\\" but with a more modern vibe to it.  Another standout track, and one of the catchiest choruses I've ever heard.  Demonizer follows it and it, too, sounds like it could've come off \\"Jugulator.\\"  It has a very hard-edged sound to it, and it rocks your socks off.  Wheels of Fire, while modern sounding, has a definite \\"Turbo\\" vibe to it.  Also excellent!  Angel is the ballad following, and what do you know, it ALSO kicks axe!  Halford's vocals are especially good here, and it's no surprise that it sounds like something from \\"Sin After Sin\\" or \\"Sad Wings of Destiny.\\"  Hellrider is a supercharged rocker, GREATLY resembling the \\"Painkiller\\" album.  This is probably my favorite track from the album (hard to say, though).  Eulogy is a short, dark ballad ala \\"Sin After Sin\\" which leads into the 13-minute epic Lochness, a long, dark track which resembles \\"Sad Wings of Destiny.\\"<br /><br />All in all, this is the album we've been waiting for from the Metal Gods.  This is certainly up there with some of the classics.  This album has its own sound but does remind us with similarities to the previous albums, and that's not a bad thing!  All is well in the Metal world, for the PRIEST IS BACK!you know, it ALSO kicks axe!

B0007M22TI|5.0|What a delight it has been to watch and listen to this live concert again and again. These five women and David Downes, who arranged and directed the program, bring an exciting new touch to many old favorites and introduces a few new ones. David has created wonderful new harmonies to accent the extensive voice talents of the individual performers. Recorded live in Dublin, the energy and emotion of the music continues to please anew with each additional viewing.  <br /> <br />The production values of this recording are also excellent. The sound and lighting manage to accent the beauty of the setting, the performers, and the music. I couldn't help thinking that we will be seeing and hearing more from Mr. Downes and I hope that we will also have more to come from this ensamble of performers. The special features include interviews with the six principles and is a MUST SEE for anyone who views this DVD.
B0006A9FMI|1.0|Its a great movie but with the lack of a dub I say you might as well just get the animanga. You'll get the same feel, and a better presentation of the movie. WE NEED A SPECIAL EDITION MANGA IS GONNA DO AN ENGLISH AUDIO TRACK IN THE U.K. we should get one here. Every other ghost in the shell merchandise in the U.S. has the english audio tracks, movie series and both games! dreamworks doesn't care for fans... I want a special edition with charactor BIOS and other things I want to know what was on the 5 disc set released in Japan! we got the shaft over here. Thanks for nothing... <br />
1565115147|1.0|This was a reading assignment for my sophomore in high school.  I purchased the CD to assist with the reading.  The CD when following along with the book is great.  However, there are many chapters skipped and there is not a listing to find out what is being skipped - you have to search the book and CD to attempt to match it up at some point.  It was used only from the beginning of the book and then up to Chapter Two - the time was being wasted trying to figure out where they were going.
B000000OQF|5.0|this is my favorite album ever. i had heard the singles from this cd so i bought the greatest hits cd then a friend bought this. my parents dont like parental advisery cds so i bought it from walmart. it was supposed to be edited but only the inside flap was the cd is uncut and pure. this is the greatest cd ever
B00003CXIP|5.0|Stand by me I have to say is one of my favorite movies of all time,it's one of those movies that I could watch over and over, and it's still so good to me. It's just a really good movie about four friends who truly care about eachother, and the experiances they go through on there journey. I loved the actors, the story line, the setting, just everything about it I loved. This movie is funny, and also sad. It will touch some people out there, and I deffinitely reccomend it to anyone who wants so see a real, good movie. Rent or buy it, you will like it.
B0006L16N8|5.0|I love this CD!  It is just so mellow and I can't stop listening to it!  This is my first Coldplay CD.  I am going to run out and get all their old CDs now.
B000002MUW|3.0|I've enjoyed listening to Madonna's music, just because when she brings out something new it's always fun to hear. With bedtime stories it was deffinitely different from other stuff she's done in the past. The music is pretty much all r&b, and with two songs that are more new age. I think it was neat how she had babyface sing with her on a couple songs. My favorite songs are \\"Forbbiden love,\\" and bedtime story. Overall it's a good c.d. Probably should listen to it first before buying it.
0316096199|5.0|This book was picked by my book club to read.  I was upset when it was picked b/c I never planned to read this book.  I had read Sebold's book The Lovely Bones and really loved the book.  When I went to search out other books by her I found Lucky.  When I read what it was about I decided I would not ever read it b/c I was sure it would be totally depressing.  Well ended up I had to read it b/c they picked it for book club.  I ended up not being able to put this book down.  It really is a GREAT book.  I am so glad I ended up reading it.
B00008S2VG|1.0|I can't belive I rated this a 1, because I usually really like Madonna's music. When I bought this c.d. and listened to the songs, I could only listen for about a minute, and skipped over to the next song thinking maybe there would be a better one, but there wasn't. The only song, that's catchy is \\"Die another Day,\\" but that's it, the rest of the songs are really not good. There not really anything you could enjoy, it's just almost annoying in a way. I think some tecno is okay, but the way Madonna did this c.d. just wasn't her best. Overall I don't reccomend buying this c.d., listen to it first.

B0006L5RT2|4.0|I discovered James Blunt a few days ago during my morning commute.  A DJ at WPLJ in New York had just returned from a trip to Europe and couldn't stop raving about the single \\"You're Beautiful.\\"  Coincidentally, Blunt happened to be in New York at the time and - even though his record hadn't been officially released in America yet - invited him onto the program to perform a set.  On the strength of that performance, I went out and purchased the import album. <br /> <br />Blunt - who has a colorful past in the Royal Armed Forces - may be a great, emerging singer-songwriter.  His debut album is mature and tuneful, with deftly written lyrics.  It is unusual to have a pop-song make reference to Dorian Grey nowadays, but Blunt pulls it off.  Now, I am hearing \\"You're Beautiful\\" on mainstream American stations, so I can only assume his popularity will continue to rise. <br />
B00003CX9E|1.0|I have tried to watch this film twice and I simply cannot get throught the whole thing all at once, though I have seen it all. For the life of me I cannot figure out what makes this movie so good, why so many people like it, and why it was voted the best movie of all time by AFI. When people talk about \\"Citizen Kane\\" They talk about how \\"brilliant\\" the filming and direction were for the time. Well that may be but to me a good movie is more than just filming and directing. I'm not sure who came first but Alfred Hitchcock filmed in the same style. The only difference is that Hitchcock's movies were interesting and entertaining! I think that's something Well's forgot about. This movie is boring and completely unentertaining. The \\"brilliant\\" film work and direction keeps you interested for about a half hour and then you're just saying to yourself \\"what the hell am I watching\\"? <br /> <br />I would put this near the top of the worst movies of all time list not the best. I agree with a previous review that AFI should have to refund the money to all the people they got to suffer through this horrible waste of film.
B000068IEU|5.0|Wes Craven's deeply unsettling zero-budget gut-churner retains its immense power and ability to shatter the viewer's nerves over thirty years after its debut. Seeing the girls get humiliated, abused, carved up and molested by a gang of drooling psycho-geeks was extremely hard to watch. The revenge sequences are also disturbing, if only because they depict just how vicious \\"respectable\\" people can be if they're properly provoked. Along with Straw Dogs and A Clockwork Orange, this is one of THE key films of the seventies that informed everyone that the love generation was ending.
B0008KLVDM|4.0|The sound for this Terminator 2 was great, probably the best sound qaulity from a PSP movie I have heard so far.  Just for that alone, this movie is worth owning.  In addition, the picture qaulity was very good and I only noticed a little pixilation during darned parts of the film.  A great PSP movie for your collection.
6304907648|4.0|If you are interested in serial killers and FBI profiling, this is a must for you.  If you're not, watch it so you can learn how fascinating this study of the sociopathic mind really is.  Sigourney Weaver sheds her \\"Ripley\\" persona as the target of \\"copycat\\" killers due to her expertise in their behavior. After an attempt is made on her life, she becomes agoraphobic although willing to assist the police in locating the killer. <br />Holly Hunter is effective as the detective who is determined to draw her out and put an end to the brutal killings that are following the modus operandi of infamous killers - Ted Bundy, Jeffrey Dahmer, and Albert deSalvo (the Boston Strangler),
B0009XRZ9M|4.0|My wife took our son, who was just 3 years old at the time to see this.  We thought since he loves trains that he would like this movie.  We were wrong.  He didn't like it--he LOVED it so much he wanted to see it again. <br /> <br />When I first saw the preview for this movie on the DVD for Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, I thought that this was a live-action movie because it looked so realistic.  I then took a closer look at it and saw (to my amazement) that it was animated.   <br /> <br />From an adult's point of view, it is a breathtaking piece of work.  It is so well done that you don't think of it as an animated children's movie.  This movie really will become a classic for the whole family to enjoy in the future.  We highly recommend it even for those of you who don't have children and are young at heart.
B00005JLWN|5.0|\\"Equilibrium\\" is a visually and psychologically stunning film that nearly puts \\"the Matrix\\" (which came out around the same time) to shame.  Alas, due to a low-brow marketing campaign (no doubt stemming from lack of studio faith in the movie), Equilibrium is a sadly under-appreciated work.   <br /> <br />Equilibrium can be enjoyed on two completely independent levels, as either a fascinating, dystopian look at the future, or as an exquisite piece of action par-excellence.  And it is this duality which allows the film to transcend both the standard sci-fi and action movie fare.  Equilibrium combines the very best of both genres, whilst avoiding many of the stereotypes and pitfalls of either. <br /> <br />Even the laziest viewers who are most unwilling to work their brains will thoroughly enjoy this movie at its \\"basest level\\", due to two words:  \\"Gun Kata\\".  Quite simply, Gun Kata is mesmerising and unbelievable.  I cannot describe it to you in words; you have to see it for yourself.  I don't know how the budget of this movie compares to the Matrix, but the special effects of this film compare favourably, and in some ways put Neo to shame.  According to the film, super law-enforcers known as \\"clerics\\" have perfected a deadly, nearly invincible art of combat called \\"Gun Kata\\", which essentially does for guns what martial arts did for other more traditional weapons such as swords.  Think of these clerics as Jedi-enforcers, but for an evil \\"Empire\\".   <br /> <br />By using statistical analysis of likely bullet trajectories, combined with full integration of the gun as a martial arts weapon, a gun kata master is able to take down dozens of armed opponents unscathed whilst seeming to not move from his original standing spot.  Onscreen, gun kata will unavoidably earn comparison with bullet time from the Matrix.  However, gun kata is presented in real-time, and that is its strength; it is far faster, more furious, and visceral than bullet-time could ever hope to be.  Prepare to be amazed.      <br /> <br />Viewers with a bit more brain fluid to spare can ponder on the film's intriguing sci-fi premise and taut, well-paced plot.  After the Third World War, most of civilisation was apparently destroyed, and the surviving government decided that humanity could not possibly survive a fourth.  It was determined that emotion is the root of all evil and war.  Thus, to eliminate war, humanity must eliminate emotion; by sacrificing the \\"good\\" emotions of love and euphoria, we gain peace and order because we have also eliminated hate, anger, and intolerance along with them.  This starts to sound like a perverted version of the teachings of the Jedi Council from Star Wars.  The citizens of this city state of \\"Libria\\" are thus forced to take an emotion-suppressing drug called Prozium.   All works of art, literature, etc. (including the Mona Lisa, incinerated in the opening scene of the movie) which could potentially encite emotion are judiciously destroyed, and all \\"sense-offenders\\", those who either traffick these illicit items, or refuse to take their medicine, are hunted down by the clerics and \\"processed\\" (executed).   <br /> <br />Enter a pre-Batman Christian Bale, who portrays the top-ranking cleric of this police-state, whose Prozium capsule breaks one morning, and decides to skip a dose.  This of course changes his life, and determines the plot for the rest of the film.  Bale is perfect in this role, starting out as an (understandably) wooden \\"tin man\\" who slowly regains his \\"heart\\" through the course of the movie.  Emily Watson, Bale's \\"obligatory\\" love interest, is likewise a strong addition to the cast.  Their love story is done in a very subtle and undercut way, one that furthers both the plot and character development, which is more than I can say for most movies these days.  Bale's partner is played by Taye Diggs, who is brilliant in this film, if for no other reason than his enigmatic, Cheshire-cat grin which makes you wonder how much he knows, and what he's up to.  Diggs' arrogance grows throughout the film, until he too, like Bale's character, becomes \\"feeling\\", but with very different results.  Character development is exceedingly strong in this film, and all of it is exceedingly delicious to watch.   <br /> <br />The world of \\"Equilibrium\\" is one filled with hypocrisy, lies, and dirtiness.  However, like most dystopian scifi films, there is also hope behind the grime.  In the end, the human spirit triumphs, and that is what gives this movie its heart and appeal.  That and Gun Kata.
0385513755|3.0|I must admit that seeing ABC News do an expose on the purported facts behind \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" captured my interest to the point where I had to get this book at all costs. And then I actually read it and I was disappointed.<br /><br />As fascinating as Mr. Brown's Research is, and as alluring as each chapter-end cliffhanger is, the book, as a novel, has a few flaws. I'm not going to discuss whether Mr. Brown's research is accurate or not. That's a debatable topic left to scholars. My review deals strictly with \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" as a novel form. The one major gripe I had was the Police Official's motivation for pursuit. In the natural world of police investigations, such behavior, is just plain silly, and not taken seriously at all.<br /><br />The book did not pursue the route I thought it would. Imagine this: what starts out as a murder investigation soon leads into the hunt for one of the most sought after relics in human history. The discovery of this relic could possibly mean big money and/or power for its discover. So, you would expect countries, spies, agents, to use whatever means possible to grab this relic. Maybe a war ensues. Sounds exciting, right? Alas, ... ho hum, nothing that exciting happens.<br /><br />After everything is said and done, the book is simply a 1- to 2- day Scavenger Hunt with some action and interesting facts thrown in to fatten up the book. Chapter cliffhangers are nice. But as a whole, the book lacks the keys necessary to be labeled 'great'
B00005Q4CS|5.0|I never read anything about Requiem for a Dream except for an off-hand comment by a reviewer about another movie, \\"At least it's not as relentlessly depressing as Requiem for a Dream.\\"  That's when I realized that no, Requiem for a Dream has nothing to do with What Dreams May Come.  In fact, the two are polar opposites.<br /><br />With a completely fresh perspective (once I realized that Robin Williams was not going to pop up at any moment and crack a joke), I was able to drink in the awful, heady concoction that is Requiem for a Dream.  And it's a testament to Darren Aronofsky that I walked away satisfied and even inspired by what ultimately is a tale of self-destruction.<br /><br />The movie begins with Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto) having an argument with his mother Sara (Ellen Burstyn) over a television set.  It seems Sara is having a nervous breakdown and has decided to chain her television set to the wall to protect it \\"against robbers.\\"  Then, terrified of Harry, she locks herself in a closet. The two argue through the door...until we realize that the person Sara's really afraid of, who really would steal the television, is Harry himself.  You see, Harry's a junkie.<br /><br />In a routine that's so rote as to become familiar to everyone in the neighborhood, Harry rolls the television set to a pawn shop, who in turn gives him money for it.  And then Sara goes back to pay for it.  The exchange is a pittance (20 bucks), but it's all a lot of work to keep the illusion that Sara is not funding Harry's drug habit.<br /><br />Requiem for a Dream is all about these kinds of illusions.  Behind it all lurks the very real danger of addiction; to people, to things, to routines, to hope.  The movie is truly a sad commentary over what happens when people lose hope.  It is the death of the American dream.<br /><br />From there, the movie branches into two different plots, following Sara and Harry's lives. Overweight, with her husband long dead and her only son stealing from her, Sara is a desperate, lonely woman.  When she receives a phone call that she will appear on a television show (an infomercial that plays incessantly, nattering on about \\"Juice\\"), she struggles to fit into a red dress.  It's the same dress she wore once before, when her husband was alive, during happier times.  Fitting into the dress becomes an obsession, as she shifts from dieting to medication. The doctor doles out four kinds of drugs: three of them uppers and one a downer to make her sleep.<br /><br />Harry, on the other hand, has dreams of his own.  With his buddy Tyrone C. Love (Marlon Wayans) and the love of his life, Marion Silver (Jennifer Connelly), they hope to stop dealing drugs by \\"one last score.\\"  Harry plans to open a boutique with Marion and live happily ever after. But all of them are addicted to cocaine and they come up with all sorts of excuses to snort it.<br /><br />What's different about this movie from say, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, is the ever-present Aronofsky.  There's no shot he won't attempt, no horrible act he won't film, no technique he won't try.  We watch Sara on speed, as she cleans her entire apartment from top to bottom.  We are continuously assaulted by the RIP-SNORT-AHH rush of the drug trip, which hits the viewer like a rabbit punch to the head. We are with Sara during her bad trips and with Marion during her good trips.  Dreams and hallucinations start to blend together, and always the soundtrack reminds us that this is a nightmare, not a comedy.  These people are real.  They're you're neighbors, your friends, your family...and they need your help.<br /><br />But they never get it.  Nobody has any safety net.  Not Sara or Harry; not Tyrone who lost his mother when he was six; not Marion who sees a psychiatrist that lies to her parents about her treatment.  These people have all been forgotten by friends and family.  They grasp out in vain for dreams that are largely meaningless, struggle to achieve goals without any clear purpose, and ultimately fall, fall, fall...to their deaths, into insanity, or prison.<br /><br />Every actor in this movie is at the top of their game.  Leto does an admirable job as a bleary-eyed dreamer who keeps hoping to make a mythical \\"big score\\" that will save him from all the rot and ruin.  Connelly's uses her angelic looks to full effect, such that her it's gut-wrenching to watch her beauty (and her innocence) used and abused.  Wayans shows surprising range as a wayward soul who just wants to embrace his mother one more time.  But the real star of the show is Burstyn, who displays amazing range as a mother and an old woman, going slowly mad in the humdrum repetition of her life.  Her role is extremely convincing; enough to bring back some unpleasant memories of my own grandmother's mental decay.<br /><br />Drug-trip movies rarely work well unless...well, unless you're on drugs.  They tend to replicate the experience in such a fashion that if you're not high, the movie is confusing or just plain irritating.  Trainspotting created the canvas for a movie like Requiem for a Dream.  Aronofsky takes it to a whole new level of dread, using sound as much as sight to reinforce the highs and lows of addiction.<br /><br />Requiem for a Dream is not a movie for the faint of heart.  But it is not exploitive or judgemental.  Hubert Selby Jr. isn't just writing about people who are chained to their addictions, he's mourning them.  With Aronofsky's deft touch, a grim book truly rises to the level of a requiem, filled lights and sound that follow its poor subjects to their grim conclusions.

1400032717|5.0|The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time is remarkable in several ways. First, the \\"detective\\" is an autistic teenager. His autism leaves him unable to decipher people's emotions, which is usually a pretty important tool for fictional detectives. But he is more logical than Sherlock Holmes and he has exceptional observational skills. So when he decides to find out who killed his neighbor's dog, you can be certain he will crack the case.<br /><br />The mystery is not really the strength of this story. How Christopher, the autistic detective, perseveres to find the answers to his questions, and then how he breaks out of his claustrophobic world is the payoff for the reader.<br /><br />I can't say how accurately Mark Haddon has portrayed the hero of this story. Probably no one who isn't autistic can say. But how he paints Christopher's mother really struck me. While I can't imagine being autistic, I can imagine being the mother of an autistic child. Haddon shows Christopher's mother as unprepared and ultimately incapable of caring for Christopher. Without doubt she loves him, but finds his lack of emotional response and seemingly random bouts of screaming and other anti-social behavior too much to cope with. It is unusual to read an account of a mother who has failed her children that doesn't also demonize her. Haddon resists and creates a realistic human being who, like her son, has limits she tries to transcend.<br /><br />As a mystery, the Curious Incident is okay, but as a story of people trying, successfully and unsuccessfully, to overcome their limits, it succeeds spectacularly.
006019250X|5.0|One reviewer (in trying to explain away a bad review) mentions that on no page does the boy cry.  But, alas, how would he find the treasure had he not cried?  In the end, you will be left imagining what happened to Santiago. <br /> <br />This is a book for everyone. I am a woman and true, there are few women in the book, but, had women been portrayed differently, the book would come across as unrealistic in the time and place for which it was written. <br /> <br />I think we spend too much time analyzing literature, rather than simply reading it for the enjoyment.
B0009MDPYW|2.0|This is bad. Really. Perhaps it is one of those movies which can only be fully understood or enjoyed if familiar with the comic that originated it. It does not even have the redeeming quality of being a decent action film. Guilty of the worst capital sin of the kingdom of entertainment: boring, boring and boring. For that alone, it will burn in cinematic hell.
B0000074BS|3.0|This is Talk Talk's third album.  It was originally released in 1986.  It is 45 minutes long.  The sound on the original CD was a bit muted.  I don't know if this was intentional; I never heard the LP.  There is now a remastered version that might have a better dynamic range (I haven't heard it either). <br /> <br />Every Talk Talk album was significantly different than the next.  Colour of Spring is one of those spacy, atmospheric albums of the mid eighties, similar to the type of music the Cure was doing. <br /> <br />Life Is What You Make It is a fantastic track and may make this CD worth buying.  The rest of the CD is in a similar vain but a little more subdued.   <br /> <br />The CD starts out fairly well and the first half is pretty good, with multi-layered textures.   <br /> <br />I think that the CD slows down in the second half and gets boring.  At points the music just drones on.  Mark Hollis has a unique, but whiney kind of vocal style.  It works great in some songs and really sets up the mood of the album.  But, there is only so much of it I can take, and it starts to drone on by the end of the CD. <br /> <br />Also, during the last half of the CD, the music is more muted.  Maybe with better sound quality, the last half of the CD might be more interesting, especially if there were an improvement in the dynamic range.  The remastered version might make this album more enjoyable.
B0007TKNIS|5.0|Absolutely love it!!  It is a great rendition of a beautiful love story!
B0009F2C34|5.0|Honestly, there's nothing I can add after those first two excellent reviews posted above. All I'll say is that the deluxe edition packaging finally gives this masterpiece the treatment it deserves. A must have for any fine rock library.

B0007Y08PQ|2.0|When Paramount released the Director's Edition of \\"Star Trek: The Motion Picture,\\" they showed an interest in giving fans a truly special and well crafted DVD.  However, since II, they've gotten chintzier with each release.  Now, Insurrection is packaged in a completely asinine case that literally has the two discs touching one another!  It's bad enough that, editorially speaking, the Trek DVDs have gotten weaker with each release, but can't they at least continue to ship them in packages that promote the physical protection of the discs inside?
B000002H3E|5.0|I can remember when this first came out and, thinking about the lukewarm reception it got back then, am disappointed that Dokken never got the respect they so deserved (while watching \\"hair bands\\" such as Whitesnake and Poison, among many others, headline at stadiums, with their videos in constant rotation on MTV - back when it actually played music videos all day long and not for an hour or two a day).<br /><br />This is definitely Dokken's best album, a rarity in that one can just push play and enjoy it from beginning to end.<br /><br />Even as a pre-teen, I had an intense crush on Don Dokken (those eyes!) but I also appreciated his voice (and here's yet another vote for the way he wailed on \\"Slippin' Away\\").  It's true that not many male vocalists in the 80's could match him.<br /><br />This is a great introduction to the music of Dokken - and a good primer for other 80's metal bands.
B00005MEW1|1.0|Everyone who writes about the lousy music on the DVD is way off base and missing the point.  This DVD isn't even the REAL Noseratu!!  In true Cleopatra (\\"producers\\" of this DVD) form, they changed the whole movie.  They changed all the subtitles and words on the screen to make the movie more appealing to Cleopatra's own fans.  They even made up their own credits and everything.  The vampire in this movie is Count Orlock, but Cleopatra went in and decided to rename him Dracula.  How can anyone gripe about the music, when a bigger travesty has been done.  Who cares about the music when they changed the whole film !!  I don't mean to sound pretentious just because I know the original movie, but I just want to warn people that if you want to see Nosferatu, then do not not not go anywhere near this re-creation.  I feel so ripped off.
B0009KA7BS|1.0|Somethings Just aren't Worth reviewing ...This is one of Them ! <br />Run from this feature ! I couldn't even finish watching it and I love Demon movies ! If U thought \\"Lost Souls\\" was bad it is a revalation compared to this !
0723284075|5.0|This item is Excellent for a child learning about the world. Beatrix Potter's stories are the best way for anyone to learn reading. The best of all is that an adult enjoys this item by feeling like a child again and learning life in the same way. As a retired college teacherI definitely recommend this \\"Presentation Box 1-23 The World of Peter Rabbit\\" to EVERYONE who wants to be educated.
B0000025ZF|3.0|I had just about discovered and become addicted to Pink Floyd in 1984 at the same time this solo album came out.  So naturally, I loved it (hell, Roger Waters could have released a record of him reciting a recipe and I would have loved THAT, too) and the provocative album cover.  I was 16!  Who wouldn't enjoy a blonde piece of ass standing on the highway? <br /> <br />Twenty years later, the album does not hold up as well.  Except for the title track and \\"Every Stranger's Eyes\\", it offers little in terms of music, lyrics and concept.  Although a bit more \\"campy\\", \\"Radio K.A.O.S.\\" faired better with me three years later.
B000000WHX|5.0|This is the first and the best album of Massive Attack. This album broke new ground with its never-heard-before trip-hop beats and set aside (as one of the reviewers said before) the English rap, it is flawless without a misstep. <br /> <br />What I really like about this album is that all the songs are completely different. There are no fillers here, every song is a world unto itself, with its moods, beats, beeps, different and very talented singers and rappers. <br /> <br />Then - it contains my all time favorite song: \\"Unfinished Sympathy\\" . This was the best single released by any artist - ever. I also liked the video, it really captured the mood of the song. Other standout tracks are: \\"Safe From Harm\\", \\"Five Man Army\\" and \\"Daydreaming\\". <br /> <br />There aren't any overlong or boring songs, the album clocks at only 45 minutes. However, these 45 minutes had an infulence quite beyond the band's imagination, I believe. They created a new sound, a new style and not many artists can say that. Kudos to the participants, this is really breathtaking stuff, even after almost 15 years.
B000002GQE|4.0|What began in 1967 as a project to record the Moody Blues' version of Dvorak's \\"New World Symphony\\" with an orchestra to demonstrate the then new Deramic wall-to-wall sound became one of the Moodies most successful albums.  DAYS OF FUTURE PASSED peaked at No. 3 and stayed on the charts for 102 weeks. And while \\"Tuesday Afternoon\\" stalled at No. 24, the anthemic \\"Nights in White Satin\\" went to No. 2 five years after the album was initially released.<br /><br />This was the first album to feature new members Justin Hayward (who composed the album's two singles) and John Lodge, replacing original members Denny Laine and Clint Warwick.  With the classic lineup in place, the Moodies released the first of seven spectacular albums featuring their trademark lush harmonies, majestic orchestral elements, and mystical lyrics (often punctuated by drummer Graeme Edge's poetry linking the songs).<br /><br />While the rock press has generally been unkind to the Moodies (and year after year they are unjustly overlooked for inclusion into the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame), their music has held up well. If you already own one of the countless Moody Blues anthologies, this 1997 remastered edition is the place to begin expanding your collection. [Running time - 41:39]  VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
B00005JNJT|5.0|For years, the batman series has been somewhat of a mockery to the comic book.  Even Tim Burton flopped the first Batman by having errors like having Harvey Dent be a black man when in the comics he was white.   <br /> <br />Despite Burton's best efforts and Shumacher's dismal attempt and utter demise of a comic book legend, Warner Bros.  finally made the Batman that EVERY comic book and Batman fanatic have been waiting for:  Batman Begins. <br /> <br />Batman Begins stars Christian Bale as a clumsy and yet scared Bruce Wayne/Batman.  Bale plays a man driven to the edge, just like the villians of Gotham; however, unlike the villians of Gotham where they are selfish and only think of revenge, Wayne or Batman uses selflessness and justice.  In Batman Begins, we see Wayne struggle with selflessness and selfishness.   <br /> <br />Of course a lot of mishaps are in this movie, but keep in mind this movie is in NO WAY connected to the previous movies [Batman, Returns, Forever, & Robin].  Warner Bros. has decided to redo the whole series dedicated and devoted to the comic books.  THANK GOD! <br /> <br />The Scarecrow is frieghtning and downright loony as he is cunning and malovent; however, the real villian is Ra's Al Guhl who I believe makes the other Gotham villians look weak and irrelevent.  In fact, Guhl gives Batman a run for his money. <br /> <br />The characters are great, the acting is great, and the plot is on the money, and there may be a sequel in the works.  Send in the clowns!(hint hint) <br /> <br />Thumbs Up!
006441034X|5.0|the first time i heard of \\"Howl's Moving Castle\\" was when i went to  go see it at the movies with some friends. i LOVED the movie. but in the credits it said \\"based on a book\\" so i bought the book. WOW. it's like getting a whole new story. this book has so much to offer readers young and old alike. it's fun and full of whimsical adventure. i highly reccomend this book.
6304779607|1.0|As if ROCKY IV wasn't horrible enough! <br /> <br />If Sylvester Stallone was so desperate to play an action cop again, I would have preferred a sequel to NIGHTHAWKS, a great New York City cop movie!
1573223026|2.0|I feel the same way as the others who were disappointed.  I felt no sympathy for the characters, did not like them and sort of wished they did jump!  I waited for the characters to start being perhaps nicer but they never did.  They were the most unlikeable, self-centered, obnoxious characters and the plot went nowhere for me.  It is too bad because I loved \\"About a boy\\".
B000002GQG|4.0|The biggest difference in the follow-up to DAYS OF FUTURE PASSED, is that IN SEARCH OF THE LOST CHORD is performed entirely by the group.  There is no orchestral backing this time out.  However, the band incorporates the use of the Mellotron to replace the orchestra.  In addition, band members experimented with new instruments.  Among them Justin Hayward plays the sitar, Ray Thomas plays the oboe, and John Lodge plays the cello.<br /><br />Commercially, the album was a bit of a disappointment, peaking at No. 23; and the singles \\"Ride My See-Saw\\" (a terrific rocker by John Lodge) and \\"Voices in the Sky\\" (a lush ballad by Justin Hayward) fail to chart.  [However, the album did go gold.] In spite of the lack of huge commercial success, this is a worthy successor to DAYS OF FUTURE PASSED. In fact, it contains several classic tracks in addition to the singles mentioned above, including Ray Thomas's \\"Legend of a Mind\\" with the \\"Timothy Leary's dead\\" lyric, as well as two Mike Pinder tracks, \\"The Best Way To Travel\\" and \\"Om.\\"<br /><br />Also new to this album is the use of Tony Clark as the producer (and would also produce their next five albums). With IN SEARCH OF THE LOST CHORD, the Moodies solidified the sound that would come to be their trade mark through the rest of their career:  lush harmonies, cosmic lyrics and orchestral elements.

B000002WPI|5.0|This is my first Wu-Tang album. I knew them for a long time i don't exactly remeber how though. I just a 14 year old right now and when i was watching mtv jams i saw the CREAM video 2 times. So i made a list to my friend and he gave me all the songs with cream on it and i forgot about and on the same day i did not know how many times i played i just killed it to death. This whole album is a classic i like all the tracks but the most i like is cream, shame on a nigga, can it be all so simple, method man, and bring da ruckus, man i like this whole album and its up their in my opinion with nas's first and jay's, to a tribe called quest and de la soul, to tupac and biggie. This is one of my favorite rap albums everq and now going to collect more cd's to my collection that i'm starting and going to add more of wu's cd's in there.

B000002UB3|5.0|This is one incredibly well-done masterpiece! I have loved it for years and years and can't get enough of it. <br />The melodies, musical ability, the harmonies, voice qualities - it all adds up to one great album. <br /> <br />Songs like \\"Here Comes the Sun\\", \\"Come Together\\", \\"Oh Darling\\" and the medley of \\"Golden Slumbers\\", \\"Carry that Weight\\" and The End\\" are but a few songs that help showcase the incredible talents of the Fab Four from England. <br /> <br />It is not an album like \\"With The Beatles\\" or anything similar to the early and even partially mid 60s song material scope The Beatles busted into the world (that is special in its own way), but it shows the guys had grown up, ready to try something new and it is incredible to me how much their music has matured when ABBEY ROAD was finished. <br /> <br />It might not be an album that hits you first time listening, maybe it is not meant to. But give it time, relax, enjoy and it'll hit you just as it hit me when I was still a teenager. <br />
B0001UL7RY|5.0|I enjoy Avril Lavigne's music, but I do agree that she might not be REAL punk or rock or whatever.  In fact a lot of her songs sound like pop songs with just some punkish rock stuffed in.  But I really don't care cause' it just doesn't matter if she's rock, punk, pop, country, imo, heavy metal, classical, blues, jazz or whatever.  It just matters if you like the music or not, so all of you metal heads who think you're such an expert on these things need to just shut-up and realize it just doesn't matter if she's REAL punk or just over publicized and just don't listen to it if you don't like it.  In my opinion the songs are catchy and fun to listen to. <br /> <br />I still am not saying that Avril's voice is that wonderful either though.  To me it sounds boyish and worn out and rusty.  She also hits a lot of bad sounding notes when she sings and it makes you wince, but the songs themselves make up for it.  As I said they are catchy plus they are simple but well thought out.   <br /> <br />Under My Skin is more mature then Let Go and the songs are enjoyable.  My favorites were  <br />Forgotten   8.5/10 <br />Freak Out   9.5/10 <br />Slipped Away7.5/10 <br />Take Me Away10/10 <br />He Wasn't   10/10 <br />My Happy Ending10/10 <br />Who Knows   11/10 <br />Nobody's Home8.5/10 <br />and <br />Together     9/10 <br /> <br />             The rest of the songs didn't really get to me like these did, but other people favored them more.  I hope you'll get this great CD!
B0009KA7BS|3.0|I've been reading _Hellblazer_ since the beginning.  In fact, I've been a fan of John Constantine since Alan Moore created him in _Swamp Thing._  So I viewed the prospect of a Hellblazer movie with trepidation.  The more I heard about it, the more disgusted I got with the Hollywoodization of one of my favourite characters.  I didn't see the movie in the theatre, but I rented the DVD on the first day it came out--because I knew I'd do it sometime and wanted to get it over with.  And you know, this movie isn't nearly as bad as it could have been.<br /><br />John Constantine (Keanu Reeves) was born with the power to see beyond this mortal coil (something that's never really explained in the book, so here they make something up).  He lives his life as a kind of roving, last-chance exorcist, getting rid of otherworldly nasties that have broken the rules that allow them to manifest on this plane.  He has his allies--a priest who hears voices and a nerdy supply agent (kind of a metaphysical \\"Q\\"), but mostly he's a loner.  Unfortunately for him, he's diagnosed with terminal lung cancer in the beginning of the movie (this idea is losely based on Garth Ennis' \\"Dangerous Habits\\" storyline).  But something big is coming and he hopes that getting involved in whatever it is will end up in his spending eternity in Heaven, rather than the other place (to which it seems sure he's bound).<br /><br />Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz) is a police detective with a psychic punch of her own. Her sister has recently met her end in an apparent suicide.  Because they're devout Catholics, to whom suicide is a mortal sin, Angela is invested in believing Isabel didn't actually take her own life.  Trying to prove it leads her to Constantine.  As an unlikely team, they try to figure out what's making the boundaries between Earth and Hell so thin and to stop it before it's too late.<br /><br />_Hellblazer_ fans watching this movie should do what I did:  repeat to yourself, \\"It's not MY John Constantine;  it's another bloke with the same name.\\"  This should help you get past the obvious problems with the character (like he's a dark-haired American instead of a blond Englishman--at least they axed the \\"Constantine-mobile\\") and allow you to enjoy what's enjoyable about the flick.  And there is quite a bit to enjoy.  The plot is pretty good;  in fact, it makes a fair stab at being many-layered.  As in many metaphysical horror type flicks, a large suspension of disbelief is required.  You just gotta accept that such-and-such an artifact calls up demons because some guy says so.  _Constantine_ the movie didn't exactly make this easy.  There was a lot of over-the-top stuff going on that didn't adhere to any internal logic.  But  if the pill was hard to swallow, at least swallowing was possible.<br /><br />The performances were also pretty good.  Keanu Reeves was pretty much Keanu Reeves (and as such, never my first choice for J.C.;  I would have liked to have seen James Marsters or whasisname from \\"Trainspotting.\\")  But his standard character fit into the script well enough.  Rachel Weisz was also in a fairly standard lady-cop role.  It was the minor characters who really hooked me.  Tilda Swinton as Gabriel was an interesting casting choice, trying for the androgyny of angels (but not quite making it;  Swinton's voice was too high-pitched).  Lucifer, Papa Midnite and John's several sidemen also turned in good work.  The only one I didn't like was Chas, whose role had devolved into a wisecracking boy-hostage type.<br /><br />What I didn't like about this movie was pretty much what I had expected:  _Hellblazer_, though chock full of various dismemberments and disfigurements, is essentially a book of psychological horror.  John Constantine is not an action hero.  Therefore, Hollywood's insistence on making him one--complete with a dragon breath flamethrower for demon fighting (please!)--did not sit well with me.  So the movie had a jerky feel as it battled between havinga coherent and interesting plot and simply blowing up zombies.<br /><br />_Constantine's_ main fault is that it tries to do too many things at once.  There's too much melodrama and silly widgets for people looking for a thinking thriller.  For those to whom blowing up zombies is reason enough, there's too much plot getting in the way.  As a movie, it tries to straddle a line between genres and ends up shaking a lot.  Still, there were satisying moments I would consider renting it worth the money.<br /><br />Just remember, It's not the real John Constantine.  It's the Other One.en having a coherent and interesting plot and simply blowing up zombies. <br /> <br />_Constantine's_ main fault is that it tries to do too many things at once.

Still, there were satisying moments I would consider renting it worth the money. <br /> <br />Just remember, It's not the real John Constantine.  It's the Other One.
B00005LC1H|5.0|Along with The Thin Blue Line, Yes Minister & Yes Prime Minister, this show is at the very pinnacle of British TV Comedy serials. John Cleese is the star of the show of course (when is he not), but Andrew Sachs as Manuel comes a very close second. The rest of the cast too is brilliant, and the script is pure magic. Every episode was a gem, and the second season was every bit as good as the first (rare in such shows). My only regret about this serial, is that there was such a small number of episodes (maybe John Cleese may read this review & come out with the third season). <br />
B0006284JQ|4.0|Well, here's all the britt hits for the fans! I'm not a big b.s. fan but to all y'all who r this is good.
006072448X|5.0|I started this last night and spent all day today on the couch finishing it.  It's an amazing novel.  While there isn't any character that's actually likeable, all are understandable, and I found myself empathizing with the emotions if not with the actions. There are no easy answers here -- while both parents seem to have contributed to the tragedy in different ways, the fact that I can think that from a distance underscores the fact that human relations are difficult and that parenting is never easy.  One of my private terrors has always been birthing a child and then not liking him/her -- now I know how it must feel.
B000006045|5.0|Wow, this in one of those cd's you can listen all day long and never get bored. Perfect cd to listen in your room  with  the lights off,couple of candles  and with your beloved ( hehe na,just kidding) <br /> <br />It's very , very  close to the effects that ENIGMA can produce, although they're totally different styles. <br /> <br />Totally recommended ! ( much more if you're in a mountain ,beach ,forest etc...)  <br /> <br />
0312995423|3.0|Like all pop authors, you get one hit so you think it is an endorsement to begin writing mediocre books to fill your book quota with your publisher.  This has definitely has that pattern.  The book rambles on with a lot of twists and turns, but in the end, fairly predictable.  It is like Dan Brown has found a winning formula and that is all he knows how to write about.  I finished the book and was left wanting more.  It is a good beach read, but if you are expecting any real depth and character building, look elsewhere.
B0006SSOHC|4.0|It's a really freaky movie! It's all about what all you'd do to spare your life. It's really good though. You should see it. I'm looking foward to Saw 2
B0009SS00A|3.0|Last night I couldn't sleep because of a cold and wound up reading the whole book in one sitting. <br /> <br />It was kind of fun and I enjoyed it more than \\"Da Vinci Code\\" - mainly because there were fewer really easy codes for the geniuses to spend chapters puzzling over while the reader got them immediatly.  Still, a room full of techno-geniuses who don't know what isotopes are is a little far-fetched. <br /> <br />It requires significant suspension of disbelief, and it probably helps to be over-tired and feverish, but I think it would make a good airplane/beach novel.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|I recently purchased the celtic women cd and dvd. both are excellent. I plan to order more to give as Christmas gifts. These angelic voices are well matched with beauty of heart that shines through the eyes of these ladies. The passion of all five artist is oh so apparent on the dvd. One has no idea how much more beautiful the music is until you watch the dvd. Lisa, Chloe, Orla, Meav, and Mairead are more entertaining than all the other concerts I have attended in person including celine dion. Mairead is a wonderful violinist and a consumate entertainer, one can see the heart of this muscian through her eyes as she plays especially in \\"the lagan love\\". All the vocalist are exceptional, the orgistration -- music and vocal are beyond compare. I can not say enough about this dvd/cd set. My only sadness is that \\"somewhere\\" and \\"Jesus,joy of mans desiring\\" (which are the most beautiful arrangements of the two songs that I have ever heard. \\"somewhere\\" has been my absolute favorute song since I was in high school some 25 years ago. This arrangement in my opinion embarrasses the original score from west side story!!!  Great job ladies!!! David Downes is the composer to the best music I have heard in ages. I hope to catch a celtic women concert if they ever come 5-8 hours of my home in Arkansas.
0590353403|5.0|JK Rowling started her famous series with this fantastic book on the Harry Potter character. Become a Harry Potter expert and read all six books in the series. For even more HP info, I also recommend the new ULTIMATE UNOFFICIAL HALF-BLOOD PRINCE BOOK 6 TRIVIA BOOK by author Daniel Lawrence to gain even more insights and clues about the entire series. Great books.
6305291446|5.0|Great movie. I really enjoyed it. You'll like this even if you haven't seen any of the previous Halloween's.
6305511055|5.0|This review is for the 1999 widescreen release by Paramount. <br />  <br />The story involves a man named Joe Turner (Robert Redford) who works in a New York brownstone building that poses as a private literature society when in fact its an undercover operation for the CIA.  His job is decoding possible enemy secrets found in publications printed anywhere in the world.  Turner runs an errand by leaving through the back of the building, and minutes later the office is raided by assassins and the 8 or so remaining employees are all killed.  Turner returns to his office and finds his fellow employees dead and contacts his superiors at the CIA Headquarters.  He begins to realize that things are not adding up and goes into hiding.  As the film moves on, he essentially kidnaps a woman (played by Faye Dunaway) and with her help, they devote their time together figuring out what has really happened. <br />  <br />The movie is filled with twists and turns.  Since Turner is an avid reader and has vast knowledge of intellegence operations, he does a magnificent job protecting himself as well as uncovering information about his advocaries.  There is one unforgettable scene where Turner meets a professional assassin (Max Von Sydow) and the contract killer describes his work and with a straight face he mentions that he finds his job rather peaceful.  This is definitely one of the best thrillers from the '70s.   <br />  <br />The DVD picture quality is nearly perfect with occasional tiny spots of film wear, but it is nothing to be overly bothered with.  The sound is superb. <br />  <br /> <br />Movie: A <br /> <br />DVD Quality: A-
B00006EXL5|1.0|This CD SUCKED!!! Oh my god..I love MCR, but..wow! The music, and lyrics in this was alright, but  the singing, SUCKED! Don't get it! It's a waste of MONEY!! Trust me, I know, I bought it!!
B0002OERI0|1.0|What happened to greendays oldschool songs? This is a complete disgrace to greenday and all true Greenday fans HATE this album!
B00005JM4Z|5.0|I Really liked this movie. So yeah you can tell the jumps and crap is fake but hey it's GOOD!
B00005JNSK|1.0|In general, I am fond of works by Tim Burton and Johnny Depp, and I had high hopes for this remake.  Unfortunately I was very disappointed by this film.  Some of my complaints: <br /> <br />1.  There was little to no character development for the children.  They were all presented very one dimensionally, and I felt nothing for them, positive or negative.  They simply existed. <br /> <br />2.  I felt that the portrayal of Willy Wonka was at best bizarre.  In Dahl's book, he is portrayed as eccentric searching for a child, a \\"soul mate\\", to take over his factory.  In this film version he is demented and psychologically damaged by a sad childhood, picking a child pretty much at random to take over his empire. <br /> <br />3.  The rejection of Charlie's family at the end is not in keeping with the character of Willy Wonka (as he was originally conceived) and was excessively corny. <br /> <br />4.  Heavy-metal disco-dancing oompa-loompas are ridiculous.  I'm assuming they are supposed to appeal to today's children, but my daughter thought they were pretty stupid, and I agreed. <br /> <br />In short, if you're thinking about spending your hard earned money on going to this film with your children, take them miniature golfing or something instead.
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|\\"mer de noms\\" was just an amazing debut. a perfect circle came out and made believers out of a lot of people. maynard insisted this wasn't a side project and he proved it. 3 years after the debut was released perfect circle came out with the follow up. I made sure i picked it up the day it came out just because i knew it would be an incredible experience just as the 1st album was.  <br /> <br />the opening single, \\"weak and powerless\\", didn't impress me too  (at first) much but still this album did sound a lot different than the 1st to me. than i realized that a perfect circle doesn't really stick to one particuler sound but they are so diverse and out-there that you are not suprised to hear anything. still they took us on one hell of a ride. <br /> <br />tracks- <br /> <br />1. The Package - 2/5 <br />i didn't really dig this song. i mean. its ok. its maybe too longer than it should be but yah. <br /> <br />2. Weak And Powerless - 5/5 <br />powerful 1st single. had to digest it though but i ended up loving it.  <br /> <br />3. The Noose - 5/5 <br />beautiful song. mjk's vocals are just perfect on this song. <br /> <br />4. Blue - 3.75/5 <br />ehhh...not the biggest fan of this song. i think its their 3rd single off this album. luv the chorus. <br /> <br />5. Vanishing - 3/5 <br />different song here. great vocals. nothing too great. <br /> <br />6. A Stranger - 5/5 <br />prob my favorite song off this album. <br /> <br />7. The Outsider - 5/5 <br />what a great song.  apc played this on like jay leno and rocked out. luv the message of this song. <br /> <br />8. Crimes - 4/5 <br />creepy song. grreat stuff <br /> <br />9. The Nurse Who Loved Me - 5/5 <br />this song will straight up haunt you. <br /> <br />10. Pet - 5/5 <br />heaviest song by apc. will kick your ass. <br /> <br />11. Lullaby - 5/5 <br />beautiful kinda outro to \\"pet\\". awesome. <br /> <br />12. Gravity - 5/5 <br />a perfect circle close out their 2nd album with an awesome song. <br /> <br />bottom line -  <br />overall. music wise a 5-star album. but i think its just an inch from being the perfect 5-stars. but APC don't disapoint their fans with this album. sure didnt disapoint me. just made me wanting more. <br />
B0001AVZA8|5.0|As a guy I traditionally avoid some of these more romantic movies at all costs.  However after seeing a few previews I must admit I was interested.  I'm very glad I gave this movie a shot.  At times it was predictable and probably could have been finished off a little quicker, but it was still enjoyable.  Jack Nicholson is hilarious and Diane Keaton matches him move for move while unfolding the story of two people who learn from each other that you can be older and still very alive.  This is a cute movie that you will want to watch more than once.
B00005RHGK|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this movie!! If you are into horror movies you should watch this!
0142401668|5.0|In summary, the story \\"Stormbreaker\\" is about a fourteen year old named Alex who lost all of his family members except his uncle, Ian Rider, who took care of him and then was killed in a \\"car accident\\". Alex thought his uncle was a banker, but he couldn't believe that he was killed in a car accident. Then the bullet holes that he saw in Ian's car confirmed his suspicious. After being told by his uncle `s bosses that Ian Rider was not a banker but a spy of MI6, Britain's top intelligence agency, and that he had been killed in an operation, Alex accepted an invitation to join the MI6 so he could complete his uncle's mission and find his killer,  Yassen Gregorovish, who was asked to kill Ian by Herod Sayle, a rich man and native of Egypt who owned a computer factory in England and had invented the Stormbreaker, a powerful computer which he had promised to distribute to all schools in England. But before starting this operation, Alex was first successfully trained, in fourteen days, by the MI6 and then he was sent to Mr. Sayle's factory under the name of Felix Lester, a young man of Alex's age, who had won a competition and who should be the first teenage to try out the Stormbreaker. Once at Mr.Sayle's factory, Alex directly started to do investigations and noticed that the Stormbreakers' donation to schools by Sayle was not a generous act, but an act which could kill almost all English scholars, and which could therefore cause the decline of England. Because of his patriotism, Alex decided to stop Sayle's plans. Noticing that Alex knew about his plans and that he was trying to stop his operation, Sayle left his  factory to go to where he could meet the prime minister and accomplish his goal. Sayle then asked his guard, Mr. Grin, to kill Alex. But after Grin's incapacity to kill Alex, Alex ordered Grin to fly him to where Sayle and the prime minister were waiting to start the Stormbreaker. Once there, Alex interrupted the situation and Sayle disappeared. Two days laterAlex found himself in physical contact with Yassen Gregorovich, his uncle's killer, who immediately killed Herod Sayle and asked Alex to go back to school. <br />       I think \\"Stormbreaker\\" is a very good book. In addition to the story itself, I really like the way in which the author, Anthony Horowitz, wrote this book. He is a very good author. When writing he cites many details which make you feel like the story is not fiction. He puts you in the mind of the main character. The only thing that I didn't appreciate when reading this story was the author's repetition of some paragraphs. For example the author repeated, more than three times, that before his death, Ian Rider had taught Alex Rider how to drive a car. <br />     This book is very emotional. And the only thing that I would recommend to those of you who want to read \\"Stormbreaker\\" is to keep reading even if, at the beginning, this story seems to be too dangerous (scary). It will turn better near the end, and you will like it. When reading, you have to be a little patient. This book will also be very interesting for someone who wants to learn how to work in a secret intelligence agency.    <br />
B000002U82|5.0|All the bands you listed are the product of the great bands like Floyd, Zepplin, The Who and so on. Too bad you are a kid and will never understand the absolute brilliance of 70's classic rock that paved the way for the (mediocre) bands of today. Pink Floyd will long be rememberd far longer than the bands you listed, dark side of the moon is, and always will be a classic.
0780624890|5.0|This movie is just outstanding. There is no better vampire movie that i know of. The special features on here aren't that good though.
B00006879E|1.0|My woman the other night and I were talking about God. I was talking about all the bad things in the world. She said \\"your God is quite mean\\". She then asked why I thought God was so mean. I said it was because he let a bunch of buttplugs like this become rich and famous.  <br />She understood me after that. <br />Thanks
B0006L16N8|1.0|#1 cd???? It's a horrible CD! I'm ashamed for it to be in my reviewed section!! It's so unlike coldplay.
B0000009TT|5.0|this is a damn great c.d. get it dont wait  buy it now and you will be happy happy joy joy  for this is the zappa we know and love
B000059Z8J|4.0|The movie was simply great, and I can't think of another word, it's just great. The origin of superman was told in such a way that even if somebody never knew who superman was(that's not likely) would believe he existed by the time they finish this movie. The cast was great, the acting is great(most of credits go for Reeves as Kent), the directing is great, the screenplay is great, everything is great. <br /> <br />The only thing that bugs is that how the hell could superman make earth go opposite direction to go back time to save the day! It seems nobody had a problem with that?! Or am I just nitpicking? <br /> <br />Anyway, This is a must have movie and if you don't believe me, rent it first and see for yourself, not a chance in the world you would regret buying this dvd.
B0000009TK|5.0|this was zappas last tour so it has some really good song selections this is for the zappa fan that loves all his music not just the overnite sensation era stuff i say buy this all of the tracks sound great and it is worth every penny spent
B0009KA7BS|4.0|Dreadfully flawed and with a muddled story line, \\"Constantine\\" is nevertheless worth watching, for its occasional profound and intense beauty, and its visions of hell and its denizens, which anyone who believes that forces of evil exist and influence our world will find fascinating. Loosely based on characters from the Hellblazer comics, the script is very interesting in parts, but the audio is abysmal. The dialog sounds as if it is coming from an underwater tunnel, and I had to watch the film with subtitles. Also, this is a film that begs to be seen several times, to make some sense of the muddle.<br /><br />The cast is excellent, and I have always been partial to Keanu Reeves, who as John Constantine, a man dying of lung cancer, who can see, and has walked beyond this dimension, is very good in his own peculiar way. I can't imagine anyone else of his generation playing the part. As he says of the cat in the film, he's \\"half in, half out,\\" and Reeves also has that quality, of being in the world, but not quite of it. Rachel Weisz, who teamed with Reeves in the far less interesting 1996 \\"Chain Reaction,\\" is both Angela, a Los Angeles detective, and her twin sister Isabel. She looks gorgeous, and gives a sensitive, lovely performance. Others in the cast that stand out are Tilda Swinton as Gabriel, and Shia LaBeouf, as Chas, Constantine's eager apprentice.<br /><br />This is the feature directorial debut of Francis Lawrence, who has previously done music videos, and he certainly has an eye for bizarre imagery. The cinematography by Philippe Rousselot is terrific, and much of what is worthwhile in this film is due to him. It is hard to rate this film, as it is, like the battle of good and evil in the story, a mixture of opposites. Total running time is 121 minutes, it is rated R for \\"violence and demonic images,\\" but is comparatively mild in language and has no in-between the sheets action. The DVD extra is 18 minutes of deleted scenes.
B0002Y4TZG|5.0|this is the greatest record ever made the dvd is nice and the bonus disc are ok it sounds like my band trying to play the clash but london calling is the shiznit as far as late 70's punk goes there is not a bad song on here and more than a few that should have been singles if the record company would have know how to market this band  this is one of those if i was stranded on a desert island and could only take 10 cd's this would be my first choice
0385335482|5.0|I love listening to Becky and her insane rationale for purchases.  She makes me feel better about all of my stupid purchases.  This book is loads of fun.  I was laughing outloud and not even realizing it.  Its easy to connect with Becky and her self-inflicted \\"struggles.\\"  I could not put this book down, I was riveted by her wackiness. <br /> <br />Buy this book, its a fun read, nothing too serious of course.  You will not regret this purchase!
B0006A9FKA|5.0|Shaun of the dead was the best movie i saw last year and for good reason.    The Plot-Shaun(simon pegg) is a slacker, he's lazy, uninspired, and again a slacker(you know something like you, yeah you who's reading this, hehehe i keed i keed) who has a failing relationship with his girlfriend.He also has a buddy named ED who he plays video games with and mixes records and listens to techno music with .But then weird things start to happen in London. News flashes across screens, people acting very wild, un-controlled, rabid, vile, demented. And you know what???Shaun doesn't notice a damn thing, it's take a zombie girl to be in his backyard who gets hit by a shovel for him to realize whats going on.  Shaun then has a dilemma at hand, does he stay home and play video games with ED or does he become a man, grab his crickit paddle and go across town and try to rescue his parents and friends from the zombie infested city?He chooses choice B and the fun begins.     Now i know what you're thinking........ your thinking i am such a great reviewer yeah i know, oh okay i know what you're thinking about this movie, that this is just another zombie spoof film..well partner your wrong, dead wrong now go in the corner you have a 5 minute timeout.Go i am serious!!!!!!!  okay well this is a smart comedy, some jokes you're gonna miss because some part of the comedy happens in the backround.  What is so good about this movie is this movie turns from a light hearted comedy to a full fledged horror film towards the end and you actually feel suspense and horror from a movie you thought was going to be a dumb spoof.  Yes my friend you must see this movie, it's an actual good movie from the U.K not just tasteless humour like ALI G.  (watch now the hatemail flow to my email account from U.K people).    The Negatives-yes even a great film like this has some negatives. Since this movie is british some phrases and dialouge can be rather hard to understand. But dont't worry it only occurs a few times during the movie, your film experience will not be ruined.    Pros  +Good humour  +great characters(except the stiff that looks like a grown harry potter)  +When the horror is on! the horror is on!  +yummmm internal organs fly everywhere, always a plus!    Cons  -hard to understand dialouge at times    Conclusion  I suggest you see this movie because THE OPINIONATED ONE SAID SO!!!!!!!!!!!plus it's really good.    4.5 STARS ROUNDED UP TO 5!    The Opinionated One Has Spoken  (YOUR AD HERE:EMAIL ME FOR DETAILS)
B0009S4IHY|5.0|Story goes- A down on his luck man (Stephen Chow) is trying to make a name for himself by coming off as a bad-ass gangster and goes to an apartment complex to try and muscle the tennants out of thier money, while he fails at every attempt, miserably might I add. What he doesn't know is that they are actually kung fu masters hidding thier identities, and when the real gang shows up to do the same, he sees this as an opportunity to proove himself, while he's caught in the middle. <br />   <br /> This movie, who is written and directed by Stephen Chow, is pretty much a live-action cartoon, but it takes the action very seriously. The action scenes were handled by renowned martial artist Yuen Wo Ping best known for his work  on the Matrix trilogy, so you know it's full of imagination, as well as some killer special effects. All the characters are hilarious too, especially the guy who, for some reason has his ass hanging out of his pants through-out the whole movie. As well as the man with the shaking man-boobs. <br /> <br />  I haven't laughed this hard in quite a while. Stephen Chow(Shaolin Soccer + God of Cookery) is bar none the funniest man working in movies today. This movie made me go and back track to find every Chow movie I could lay my hands on. This is by far his best work to date. His movies keep getting better and better, I can't wait to see what he'll come up with next. But until then I would highly recommend this movie to any fan of action-comedies, you will not be dissapointed. So I hope you'll have as much fun as I did watching this movie. <br /> <br />
0316776963|4.0|I actually listened to this book on tape/MP3 and have to say that I did thoroughly enjoy it.  It was something I would not have normally read, but I figured it was time to read something that was not in my \\"norm\\".  I didn't realize that the author was gay until the 2nd or 3rd chapter.  That did challenge my pursuit of completing the book, but I realized that I'd be quite prejudiced if I quit listening for that reason alone.  For me, the book gave me a better perspective on a lifestyle that has been labeled as \\"just not right\\".  Although I don't personally agree with that lifestyle, that doesn't mean I shun it by any means.  The book really just described a man who has daily challenges just like any other person.  Only difference is sexual preference.  I found the work extremely funny in some parts.  I really have to recommend this work to anyone who has never taken the time out to learn about a different person.  I think we should all do that honestly.  Else, how can we truly tout that we appreciate diversity and practice tolerance?  We can all stand to step out of our box and learn a little more.
B000002U9Y|4.0|The Floyd was a mess at this point. David Gilmour was just hired by three of the members of the band, Syd Barrett was all but history, their direction was nada, the future was uncertain, and eventually, Barrett was fired, behind his back by the other three, at that.<br /><br />\\"Saucerful\\" is a patchwork that is surprisingly good, looking at what was going on. The opening track, \\"Let There Be More Light,\\" has Wright and Gilmour singing alternately on an early Waters composition, apparently about a visit from a mystical alien being, and his effect on people.<br /><br />Rick Wright's \\"Remember A Day\\" is a left-over from the \\"Piper\\" sessions, a nice song about remembering youth, and wanting to be that young again.<br /><br />\\"Set The Controls For The Heart Of The Sun,\\" an early Roger Waters song, along with \\"Let There Be More Light,\\" shows the degree of maturity he had achieved in his songwriting since \\"Take Up Thy Stethoscope And Walk.\\" This song is quiet and moody, tension in the lyrics, the silence in the night while waiting for something to happen, even it is just a sunrise, something bigger than what this life has to offer, \\"the heart of the sun.\\"<br /><br />\\"Corporal Clegg\\" is one of Waters' first barbs at the war that cost him his father. Corporal Clegg is apparently some old drunk who only gets any recognition in his dreams, the song is loud, sloppy, and the mood is summed up perfectly by the solos being performed on a kazoo.<br /><br />The Title track was the last they recorded in these sessions, and David Gilmour has gone on record saying that while they were recording this, he was thinking \\"This has nothing to do with music.\\" And ironically, it's a track that he has grown fond of afterward. It's largely a tuneless experiment, with unconventional use of regular instruments, like putting a sensitive microphone really close to the edge of a large crash cymbal, and stroking and tapping the cymbal with soft mallets, to get those soft tones in the beginning of it, plucking the wires inside a piano, speeding up tape-loops of their own voices, hitting random notes on an organ, lots of these things, layer after layer, until you have a creshendo of noise, and let the bottom fall out. The second section is a tape-loop of a drum fill, played indefinitely, while the guys just bash on their instruments; running a microphone stand up and down the strings of a guitar turned up really loud with various effects boxes, slamming piano keys with fists and open hands, backward tapes of cymbal crashes, and lots of miscellaneous sounds, fading into the third section, just a deep, ominous rumble, with eerie, droning organ chords as a lead-in to the finale; at last, a melody. A slow chord progression repeats itself a few times, each time, adding something, until you have these angelic voices singing along with the organ and mellotron. It was originally considered filler, but they developed it into a completely different creation that they played on stage for years after.<br /><br />\\"See Saw\\" is another Wright number, sad lyrics about siblings drifing apart as they get older, the dreamlike imagery of the music is pleasant, with these grotesque \\"things\\" , for lack of a better word, after each refrain, to offset it, I've never fully understood why they are in there, but I like them, anyway.<br /><br />The closing number, \\"Jugband Blues\\" is a farewell from Syd Barrett, the lyrics betray his knowledge that his days in the band were numbered. Lines like \\"I must oblige to you for making it clear, that I'm not here,\\" say that he knew they couldn't take him anymore, but he's grateful for their indulgence anyway.

B0009KA7BS|1.0|This movie is so bad. Not in the funny way. In the unwatchable way. I love comic book movies. I love Exorcism movies. This movie was worse than Exorcist: the Beginning. Worse than League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. Worse than The Matrix Revolutions. Bad bad bad bad bad movie. Bad acting, bad editing, bad directing, bad script. Waste not your time. You've been warned.
0887307280|3.0|I have very mixed feelings about this book.  The first part, which discussed the 3 personality types, was spot on.  However, it is the second half of the book that disturbs me.  His thesis is that the system runs the business and the people run the system.  While the theory sounds good, I'd say the implementation is a quick way to turn your company into a souless corporate machine.    Maybe I'm just bitter.  Maybe it's cause I just bailed out on a job, read this, and then found out that this book was their guiding philosophy.  Maybe it's cause I read Fast Food Nation first. I dunno.  Whatever the case, I think this book, in the non-critical hands, is a quick path to creating a souless empire.  Just another best-buy or ticketmaster, or any other company that has distilled it's essance into a bunch of scripts and guides.    That said, I do think this book is a \\"must read\\" if only to contast other business books you've read.   I dont think it's the holy grail of business, but it has very good advise.  Hence, three stars.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|For those of you that are familiar with Joss Whedon's style of writing and character creation, then Firefly will be a pleasant continuation of that tradition.  For those of you new to the Whedonverse, be prepared for some great times.  Though Firefly was cancelled after only 11 episodes, the characters and seeds for future stories grew almost instantly. <br /> <br />From the first episode you get a sense of the universe these characters reside in.  A future not so different from our present, where finding work, friendship and betrayal are an everyday task.  A brilliant fusion of science fiction and western (these guys ride horses more than one time during the show AND use pistols instead of lasers or phazers or lasers or fazers or whatever), Firefly and the forthcoming film, Serenity, are not to be missed.   <br /> <br />Hey, it's only 13 episodes or so.  What have you got to lose?
B00000J2SO|5.0|'Down To Earth' is one of those classic, ultra well-crafted hard rock albums that come along once in a while.  This one is just as incredible as Rainbow's previous 'Long Live Rock & Roll', but differs in style a bit.  I put it in the same awe-inspiring league as '2112', 'Blizzard Of Ozz', 'Back In Black', or 'Appetite For Destruction'!  Behold the maestro Ritchie Blackmore on guitar with the soulful and powerful Graham Bonnett on vocals playing with the veterans Cozy Powell (R.I.P.), Roger Glover, and hard rock keyboard god Don Airey!  The songwriting and performances here are top-notch, with mind-bending bluesy hard rock guitar work by Blackmore, peppered with just the right amount of tasteful and technical guitar solos that send chills up your spine, they're so heartfelt.  The world is also introduced to the powerful vocal prowess of Graham Bonnett here, and we are all the richer for it!  Don't miss this one... it's THAT great!
B0006L16N8|1.0|While I'm not a fan, I gave this album one star because my little sister likes it.  She's nine yrs. old and she also likes the music by Ashlee Simpson and Lindsey Lohan.  Since Coldplay's lyrics are written from the perspective from a 12 year old, they're just her speed.
B00022M518|5.0|Brian Eno's first album after being forced out of Roxy Music is a landmark, not only in his career but in music history. 'Here Comes the Warm Jets' is basically a Roxy Music album without Bryan Ferry (since everyone else from the band contributes in one way or another). If you like Roxy Music at all, this is essential. Guitar legend Robert Fripp makes a few appearances on the album, as well as many other underground artists. This album was released while glam-rock was at its peak. Eno would release one more glam album before abandoning it for ambient music, but not before releasing some of the best music of the decade. 'Here Comes' is as good or better than any Roxy Music album (except probably 'For Your Pleasure') and the best place to start if you've never heard any Eno. Pick up 'For Your Plaesure' and 'Here Come' then move slowly into his ambient releases.  <br />
B0000029GA|4.0|I have sumthin 2 say about nas.  he seem confused.  In some songs u hear him dissin 2Pac, than in other songs u hear him praisin 2Pac.  Nas also disses Mobb Deep in some songs, but he also does songs with Mobb Deep.  Most confused man in hip-hop. <br /> <br />Diddy is also a little confused.  He and his record label had major beef wit pac, but of the recent years i have heard diddy talk positive things of pac.   <br /> <br />Honestly i think they both have fake personalities. <br /> <br />**This review has nuthin 2 do with the album, i just had to get that off my chest.
B0006L16N8|5.0|This entire album is the essence of individual growth and of equally individual sense of time passing. Every single tune, regardless of lyrics-inspiration or tune-borrowing, is a powerful reminder to all twenty-somethings, thirty-somethings, or forty-somethings, that there is a little bit of us that needs to be brought forth to the ones that will carry our torch on. This is the one album for us to remember and for our next generation to learn from.
B00080ZG10|5.0|DiCaprio is awesome in this movie. I have never been a big fan, but DiCaprio's acting in this film is great. Probably his best ever. From what I remember reading about Hughes as a kid, the movie portrays Hughes in a similar light. Some transitions in time are fairly quick, so some adjustments have to be made, but the personality of Hughes really shines through. One of the better biography films.
B0000DZ3EA|2.0|<br /> I was thinking about picking this one up - until I read it is another record company rip-off. <br /> <br /> Like Forty Licks, the label issues radio edit versions of some songs. <br />  <br /> I would rather see these companies include one or two less songs on these compilations, so fans can get the full length tracks. <br /> <br /> Here is a great artist who doesn't need edited versions on packages like this one. <br /> <br /> Watch the record companies wait 2 or 3 years and then come out with 'New & Improved' Greatest Hits collections with unedited songs from your favorite artists.
B00062ZE3U|5.0|Well, I'm writing as a Londoner reading your reviews of this CD. Firstly, it's really interesting and refreshing to see that so many of you say Memories is your favourite track.  <br /> <br />As for those of you who have said Within Temptation are \\"untalented\\", just stop, think for a minute and listen to the album again. Yes, no one is denying that there are many commercially orientated tracks on this album, but just listen to the melodies of every single song...those songs were all written by the band themselves. A song like \\"Jillian\\" which surpasses any other song in the world ever(!) cannot possibly be labelled as \\"bland\\", \\"boring\\" or \\"poppy\\". It has a very accessible sound, but that is because it is just so damn good! In fact, I've used this song to introduce many of my friends to WT. In my opinion, it is the band's best song, and sums them up.  <br /> <br />For the \\"Mother Earth\\" album, WT created their melodies purely with a keyboard. The choral elements were produced by recording a 5 piece choir and duplicating the voices to mimic a larger choir. Although the sound is passable, it certainly isn't perfect. Don't get me wrong, Mother Earth is one of my favourite albums, but sound quality-wise, it lacks the production. WT realised this, which is why they employed the talents of an 80 piece orchestra AND 80 piece choir for the album. You'll find no keyboard violins here, so please refrain from accusing the band of this. <br /> <br />Mother Earth didn't have the professional feel of TSF. WT have demonstrated with this album that they are talented, comfortable and exceptional, and I for one cannot wait for their next offering.
B000000OTY|5.0|<br /> If you try only one Peter Gabriel release.  <br /> <br /> Get this one ! <br /> <br /> The tracks are expanded in concert presentations, versus the studio versions. <br /> <br /> While I like the originals, these tracks just blow them away. <br /> <br /> One of my top 5 desert island live recordings. <br /> <br /> Great sound, great playing/vocals. <br /> <br /> A WINNER !!!
B0007Y08IS|5.0|Ha ha ha just kidding,this movie is a pure classic.I think its the best movie of all time.................involving puppets.  Every scene is funny as hell. This one is fulled with puppets getting blown up, getting ate by sharks, Etc. Trey Parker and Matt Stone (the writers for south park) did a great job on this script. they also put there voices for alot of the charecters. This is just a classic and even if you have seen it in the theaters, you should pick up the dvd  anyway. just to see it 500 times over again
1400032717|2.0|I read this book because it recieved so many good reviews, and was very disappointed.  I thought the plot was dry, I didn't care about any of the characters, and there was absolutely no suspense.  Unless you want to understand how a autistic person thinks I would not recommend this book.
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|I first heard of Nightwish on the CD \\"The Celtic Circle, vol.1\\" which had their beautiful song \\"Sleeping Sun.\\"  I looked into the band, thinking that they were a Celtic-pop group.  How wrong (and pleasantly surprised) I was!  I grew up listening to opera, and I must say, I've been waiting a long time to hear something that can correctly synthesize rock and opera.  Here it is!  This album is powerful: the word EPIC comes to mind.  \\"Dark Chest of Wonders\\" is a thunderous beginning, and the album doesn't let go.  \\"Wish I had an Angel\\" is a great song of anger and betrayal, with the dark twist of unfulfilled desires.  \\"Nemo\\" is a hauntingly beautiful piece about longing for an unfound love.  Other highlights include \\"Creek Mary's Blood,\\" perhaps one of the most moving songs I've heard, about the Navajo Trail of Tears.  \\"Ghost Love Score\\" pulls out all the stops with a full-on orchestra and chorus, that rips right at the heart.  Tarja's voice is incredible, and more than makes up for Marko Hietela's grating male vocals.  Tuomas' lyric and songwriting skills are unparalleled: he truly knows how to write music which is in turn haunting, crashing, epic, and gothicly romantic.
B0006L16N8|5.0|I notice that many reviewers who have praised (or bashed) this album by Coldplay have said that the album doesn't show any growth and that Coldplay's music hasn't yet been dynamic enough. And very much so, many of you are right. But that's where many lose the point. At the end, this album is truly excellent, and i believe that Coldplay's flaws shouldn't overlook the fact that they are one of the most talented, innovative, and intelligent artists out there. How many popular artists out there sing and perform like Coldplay does? How many of them out there actually take their time to create an album that isn't rushed, but actually thought out? I mean really, i think at the end you should take the album for what it is. Sure, it's not extremely different from Rush of Blood to the Head, and yes, some songs do sound similar to other songs that made them very popular and well-known, and no, they aren't trying to be like U2 or Radiohead. I think by far that this is one of the best records of the year, and we shouldn't really overlook these guys for just very small flaws. I feel that in time they will expand their musical horizons and do something different, but for now, just enjoy the music for what it is!
B00000J7JO|3.0|I am very angry at the engineering.  This is by far my favorite album by RHCP, I love the music, but the engineering sounds like the range has been compressed a few dozen times.  You can't turn the music up without hearing the voice clipping, the cymbals buzzing, or the guitar's clean distortion turning into nasty muddy sounds.  The clipping in the voice is worst on the intro to Otherside.   <br /> <br />My last hope is that some day this will be remastered with less compression, until then, I advise you don't buy this album.
0385336810|3.0|I absolutely adore the new genre of chick lit and have an impressive collection of Jane Green to boot. But Sophie Kinsella's heroine, Emma Corrigan, failed to impress me or lure me into empathy in anyway. If you like Jane Green's books and her ability to tap into your emotional subconscious, you won't be impressed by Kinsella either.  <br />At first, Emma comes off as a stereotypical Bridget Jones character - flighty, clumsy, a professional loser, but (as always) extremely endearing. She's with her \\"gorgeous\\" boyfriend for his looks, and everyone keeps telling them how \\"perfect they are together\\" but you can't ever really quite figure out WHY a \\"perfect AND gorgeous\\" guy would be so in love with HER, a lowly marketing assistant who doesn't get much respect on the homefront either. So Kinsella leaves it up to you to figure her out, giving no physical or self-imposed description of her heroine at all, and really leaving the reader a bit unsatisfied and confused. At the end of the book, I STILL didn't understand Emma, nor did I understand why she was so special to deserve the requisite happy ending, and that's why I gave this book only 3 stars. I can already tell I'll forget about this story and this character soon. If you want entertaining chick lit that's also thought provoking, try Jane Green's books. They are much better.
B0009K7QZ8|5.0|COMPARISON <br />So ye there's a big debate with people comparing the OC season two with season one and in my humble opinion; this is mistake number one. They do not need to be compared.Seaon two is different to season one in so many ways that it ended up disappointing loads of fans. Season one was all about the producers making sure they had a show. We all loved that there was a brand new issue/story line explored in each one hour-long episode. It gave the OC a thrill that no other TV show does and hooked us straight way. But you had to realise that it couldn't go on like that forever, they were simply going to run out of story lines. That made this season completely different, more time was spent developing the characters and less on cheap thrills. Also, season 1 was always described as the 'fish out of water' story and by the last episode, even though ironically our fish Ryan leaves, the story is complete. This makes the focus of the plot of season 2 entirely different as well. So don't get me wrong; I adored season 1 and continue to adore it on DVD. The two are equally good as each other and some people were just reluctant to accept the necessary changes. I am completely obsessed with the OC and season one wil probably always be my favourite season just because it's the first and it is just really really juicy (don't critisize the word choice it explains what i mean well). Season 2 is by no means as juicy but i highly recommend it because it is equally if not more witty, sharp, poignant, funny, entertaining and the music is equally as amazing as the first box set. so as long as you don't expect quite as many cheap thrills; this box set will not dissapoint. It is a more mature and edgier show and i guarantee it made me cry loads more than i did in season one (please respect that this is saying something). Also, I seem to be the only person to notice that season two has 3 less episodes than seaaon 1 but i promise you the extras on these DVDs make up for it. The extras on the season one box-set seemed a bit of an afterthought whereas in this box-set they are great. I see absolutely no reason why not to bu these DVDs if you have any interest at all in the show; you can watch them over and over again and feel like you're seeing something new every time.
B00005JMAH|5.0|There were many changes to the Harry Potter franchise for the third film in the series, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, and they didn't just involve the story and the characters.  Alfonso Cuaron replaced Chris Columbus as director, and he brought with him a much darker tone to the films.  While every Harry Potter book has been dark, the level of darkness increases with each subsequent novel, so it only makes sense.  However, Cuaron overhauled the entire look of the film in order to make it scarier and darker.  Gone are the brilliant golden shades from the first two films.  In this one, an icy silver tone is used throughout the movie (even the Warner Bros. logo and the title are a cold silver as opposed to the bright gold used in Sorceror's Stone and Chamber of Secrets).  It is very rare to see a clear blue sky in this movie; a lot of scenes take place at night or during a very cloudy/rainy day.  Even the quidditch match occurs during a nasty rain storm. <br />In Harry Potter's (Daniel Radcliffe) third year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, the state of the wizarding world is in a panic.  A man named Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) has escaped from Azkaban Wizards' Prison, which, like Alcatraz, was viewed to be impossible to escape from.  Now Black is on the loose, and it is widely believed that he is going to seek out and kill Harry Potter.  Black was in Azkaban because of his loyalties to the Dark Lord Voldemort, and speculation is that he sees Harry standing in the way of Voldemort's return. <br />Making matters worse for Harry is that the Dementors, which are the guards at Azkaban, have been stationed at Hogwarts to \\"keep it safe\\".  Dementors are very nasty creatures (which were probably once in the service of Voldemort) that feed on happy thoughts, leaving people temporarily paralyzed with unhappy memories.  Since Harry has had more than his fair share of unhappy memories (his parents' deaths is at the top of the list), the Dementors cause himto pass out. <br />This year, two new teachers are appointed.  Rubeus Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) takes over the Care of Magical Creatures position while newcomer Remus J. Lupin (David Thewlis) becomes the new Defense Against Dark Arts professor.  Also, Michael Gambon replaces the late Richard Harris as Headmaster Dumbledore and does a great job with the role.  Harry, Ron (Rupert Grint), and Hermione (Emma Watson) begin to take elective classes such as Care of Magical Creatures and Divination, which is taught by the kooky Professor Trelawny (Emma Thomas, who does a great job hamming up the role).  But as the children have fun in school, newspaper articles keep reporting that Black is getting closer and closer to Hogwarts. <br />Even though MOST people know the ending before seeing this film because they have read the book (which I really reccomend), I am still not going to give it away.  I will say that the climax is amazing.  There are great twists, and in a sense, a double ending which, while hard to explain, makes perfect sense and is great to see. <br />The special effects in this film are great, much improved over the first two films.  Buckbeak the hippogriff (a sort of cross between a horse and an eagle) looks beautiful and much more realistic than Fluffy in Sorceror's Stone or the basilisk in Chamber of Secrets.  The quidditch match also looks better in this movie, but then again, it's very short, and pretty much the only thing we see is Harry going after the snitch. <br />Ironically, while Prisoner of Azkaban is the longest of the first three books, it's the shortest of the first three movies.  While some of the cuts that they made were necessary and made sense, I was surprised at a few of the things that they left out.  Mainly, I couldn't figure out why they didn't explain HOW Sirius escaped from Azkaban, or why they didn't reveal the identities of Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs, the creators of the Marauder's Map.  While the movie was very strong, thesetwo details would have made things clearer to the audience as well as to Harry and his friends. <br />The first two Harry Potter films were good, but I didn't find them to be anything special (unlike the books, which I love).  This one, however, was amazing.  Hopefully, the next film, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, will be as good or better.
0385510438|3.0|Make no mistake, Grisham has a smooth, almost machine-like capcacity to move a story along. He has an ear for dialog and an eye for funny anecdotes, or at least humorous, colorful slants on southern life as most outsiders have come to know the \\"Bible belt\\".    In \\"Juror\\", Grisham uses almost every stereotype and prototypical hero he can find, from the black family of PhDs to the boozy journalist, gun-totin' lawyers, simple-mided janitor, corrupt sheriff, eccentric old folks, gorgeous widow, family of moonshiners and monsters, and the mournful sister of the deceased. There are elements of many of Grisham's previous books, especially \\"A time to kill,\\" and some of the characters are pretty worn out from overuse.    Our narrator, Willie, the entrepreneurial college drop out who is able to manage, write and edit a disaster of a paper into a smart newspaper, stumbles into the proverbial gold mine, taking a $50,000 bankruptcy purchase into a $1.5 million sale nine years later. Along the way, Willie (hit with a southern version of his name at introduction, it really sticks) takes on powerful forces, beds the sister of the widow, learns how to dress like Tom Wolfe, refurnishes a rambling old house in a five-year project, and builds a newspaper that everyone wants to read, only to sell out in the end.    Underlying all of this is his relationship with the black matron, mother of all those PhDs and one runaway son, through the turbulence of the 1970s in southern America. Willie gets to be a redneck in training, a master of integration, and the tree-hugging war protestor, embraced and admired by the entire community. The last third of the book winds down with a transparent subterfuge by Grisham, who lets the surface suspect take all of the heat while an even casual reader can figure out who really is behind the murders of the jurors.    It all is a little too trite, too sweet, too stereotyped to make the experience worthwhile or memorable. Like cotton candy, it is sweet withoutthe substance, satisfying one base craving for a story while yielding little real satisfaction.
B000002UAR|5.0|The Beatle's masterpiece of \\"Revolver\\" has commonly been declared the best album of all time along with Pink Floyd's \\"Dark Side of the Moon,\\" the Beach Boys' \\"Pet Sounds,\\" and The Beatle's later album, \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Heart's Club Band.\\" \\"Revolver\\" didn't achieve it's greatness by producing mega hits. The biggest hit on the album is Paul McCartney's \\"Got To Get You Into My Life.\\" This album is great because of it inovation. <br />  <br />George Harrison experiments with Indian instruments in \\"Love You To,\\" while John Lennon discovers backwards tracks in songs like \\"I'm Only Sleeping\\" and \\"Tomorrow Never Knows.\\" The lyrics find inovation from the Beatle's now far more drug influenced lives.  <br /> <br />The album kicks off with Harrison's angry \\"Taxman.\\" Though Harrison is credited with the songwriting, lyrics, and solo, McCartney's cash register bass line is the backbone of the song.  <br /> <br />The highpoints of the album are \\"Taxman,\\" \\"I'm Only Sleeping,\\" \\"She Said She Said,\\" and \\"Got To Get You Into My Life.\\" McCartney  continues to take on the role of writing the Beatles' main love songs like \\"Here, There, and Everywhere,\\" \\"For No One,\\" and of course, \\"Got To Get You Into My Life.\\" <br /> <br />John Lennon finishes up \\"I'm Only Sleeping\\" and the album with \\"Tomorrow Never Knows.\\" This is by far the most experimental song on \\"Revolver.\\" It features a single chord, drug influenced lyrics, screaming sea gulls, and constant backwards tracks.  <br /> <br />By \\"Rubber Soul\\" the Beatles decided to stop just recording their hits and make a work of art. \\"Revolver\\" is the result of that.

B000002HNR|5.0|This is a awesome Doors CD. It has many great songs such as Alabama Song, Backdoor Man, When the Musics over, Five To One, Soul Kitchen, and many many more. Robby Krieger is amazing in this CD with extended solo's that are amazing. Ray has many great talents and shows them in songs like Soul Kitchen and When the Musics over. Jims voice is pretty good and says pretty much all the right lyrics. Except in When the Musics over, but I dont mind it. And John as usual is on beat. So I think if you are a true Dooors fan or just like the ma little, this is the right CD for you
B00097A5I6|4.0|I wasnt blown away at first, but this alblum really has some gold. It doesnt quiet rise above Standing on the shoulders of giants, but better than Heathen Chemistry. I really enjoy tracks 1,5,7,8 and 11. Apparently, they wrote a few songs with Jem?
0452281881|5.0|I think that I have read this book at least half a dozen times and it gets hearty laughs, from way down in the belly every time.  Beaumont's characters and plots are utterly despicable, making it all the harder to put down!  This is one of those novels that is hard to share by retelling bits to others - they have to read it for themselves.  It is by far the funniest book I have read in a long time - so originally written and presented.  Get one for everyone you know and spread the laughs!
B00005O5UA|5.0|I have been a Quuen fan since their debut in 1973...have seen them 8 times from 1974-78.....and have all their albums on CD....even have a rare bootleg of their Hammersmith Christmas concert 1975....So I am very familiar with everything they've done to date....Live and in the studio.<br /><br />This album is incredible....I really liked Innuendo....but this last effort really shows a band that had it all together...Freddie poured his very heart and soul into each and every song, every note, every nuance....Brian, John and Roger played with superb effort....The first time I listened, I was awestruck....No other Queen album has ever impressed me like that..right off the bat...NONE!  and I am a major fan......Dont be confused...this is NOT some \\"Jimi Hendrix after-the-fact\\" effort of tapes that were dug up and the guys got together and filled in the background instruments to his voice and playing....these are honest to goodness recorded band efforts that would have been the next Queen album after Innuendo....and they are NOT outtakes or back shelf tunes that were scrapped....Each song is a winner.....If Freddie were alive today...am sure he'd be very pleased the guys decided to release this album....<br /><br />The last track is a short instrumental by Brian....very distant, haunting and eerie....almost like the sound of death and then the journey to heaven.<br /><br />Just as they said earlier in their career....<br /><br />WE ARE THE CHAMPIONS!!!!!  and this album proves it!!!!<br /><br />Get it now...and love it like you remember Queen always sounded at their best...
B00000JG41|4.0|Mr Bungle are, as you should know, Mike Patton's first and probably best band. The first self titled album was a sheer genius mix of chaotic funk, clunky ska and complete insanity, an absolute must for Patton fans. A few years later along came Disco Volante. The world promptly shat its self upon hearing the devastating soundscapes Patton and crew had unleashed upon it. An album for hardned ears. Where to go after this brilliant attempt at being as anti listener friendly as possible? So we come to California, the last Bungle album and the most accesible. This album mixes self titled era style songs such as \\"The Air Conditioned Nightmare\\" with some far more relaxed, Scott Walker style affairs such as \\"Sweet Charity\\" and \\"Pink Cigarette\\" There are some very wierd and interesting songs on this album, with several surprises for people expecting traditional Bungle madness. Get it if you're a fan but don't expect your brain to be mangled quite as much as by the other two albums

B0009K7QZ8|5.0|With the Drama and Excitement it has been a very good season. With all the strange things that happen to the people that live in the orange county. There has been very tense moments shown in this and is full to the brim with the latest gossip that goes around. Also the music is sooo cool. I even have the Soundtrack. This is the Greatest show alive and nothing can top this.  Remember this is a 15 so no going breaking the age barrier.  Just Joking!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0375707972|3.0|This is a very strange story about a strange love affair.  Michael Berg was only fifteen when a woman twice his age, Hanna Schmitz, initiates him into an early adulthood.  In a small town of postwar Germany, she takes him into her house and he becomes her lover.  Suddenly, she disappears and the poor boy is frustrated as she searches far and wide for her, asking neighbors if they know where she has gone.  He is heartbroken.    But life goes on and he become a law student and eventually finds her again in an unexpected place in court on trial for war crimes.  As he observes the trial as a learning experience, with a type of pleasure and feeling of retribution, he watched as she was unjustly treated, slandered and attacked verbally.  He is bitter to be reminded how she had used him and thought about the birthmark on her shoulder.    We all have secrets and events we'd like to keep hidden, forgotten in the past.  After a while, one's past has a tendency to surface to our shame; it is not always a happy remembrance, one we cannot face again.  All families have skeletons in the closet which are best left unexposed and kept hidden.  Hidden from those we love who may judge us harshly.  If we've endured trauma or emotional pain, it is twice as bad when the memory resurfaces.    He learns in court that she had been a young guard in a concentration camp. I can identify with Hanna as she was falsely accused time after time.  She faced down the trial judge as I did the Mayor.    They were able to cast reasonable doubt about her conduct at the camps and how she had used the young, delicate girls as \\"readers\\" because they were too weak to do the hard labor on the building site.  A church had caught on fire by the bombing and many POWs died as a result.  Hanna was supposed to have a key, but so did the other guards, but none fit the front door.    This is a dramatic and sad war story and a bittersweet story of forbidden love.  Mr. Schlink has also written FLIGHTS OF LOVE and SELF'S PUNISHMENT.  Not a book I shall soon forget.
B00005JNSK|4.0|When I went to see this movie I had no idea what to expect.  Most re-makes that I've seen have not been very good, so I was a bit nervous.  But this one I was quite satisfied with. <br />This version of the story can stand on its own, because Tim Burton did not attempt to simply \\"copy\\" the original.  He mostly stuck to the book, with a few changes.  Johnny Depp had me laughing hysterically throughout the movie.  Sure, he may seem to be over-acting at points, but that's part of what makes it funny.  My first reaction to seeing pictures of him was like many others: it's Michael Jackson.  But you forget all about that in the movie.  I could almost picture Paul Rubens (Pee-Wee Herman) playing Willy Wonka; at some parts I was almost expecting Johnny Depp to let out a Pee-Wee Herman laugh.  I really enjoyed how we got sort of a side-story of Mr. Wonka's childhood through a series of flashbacks.  And while I won't give details about the ending, it is slightly different from the way the original film and the book end.  So, while we all mostly know what is going to happen throughout the film, we don't know exactly what the people (mostly Willy Wonka) are going to say, making the movie not-so-predictable. <br />There were a few things that I didn't like, of course.  First, while many of the CGI effects were great, some felt like they were incomplete, or not detailed enough.  But maybe Tim Burton wanted them to seem a bit cartoonish.  Second, some parts of the movie feel sort of rushed.  Like finding the Golden Tickets.  We see Charlie and his family watching the news about Augustus Gloop finding the first ticket, then right away, we see Veruca, so it's like the tickets are all found right away.  This also happens while the people are in the factory; they enter the chocolate room, and before you know it, they're on the boat, then on to the inventing room, and so on.  So the kids keep disappearing so fast that we hardly get to know them. <br />I really didn't mind the Oompa Loompa songs as much as some people.  The first one reminds me just a little bit of \\"Lavida-Loca\\".  The main thing I didn't like about them is that you can hardly understand what is being said, making them not-so-memorable. <br />The original film with Gene Wilder will always be my favorite, but this one was very enjoyable as well.  I know some people feel that a re-make just wasn't necessary and don't see why it was made, but think, when you were young, didn't you ever watch a movie and imagine making that movie yourself?  Because that is what Tim Burton has done.  I just can't wait for this movie to come out on DVD.
B00008J2DQ|5.0|I never really understand why people review music or albums. I think music is just music. Also until you make your own album I don't think your opinon should be held as that noteworthy. Although its important that you have one, music is once again just music. I think this is a good album of course I have never written my own album. But I am a writer and I get alot of people reviewing my work.
B000005JAK|3.0|After an inevitable bail from \\"the check's in the mail\\" SST, the Huskers signed with Warner's Bros. (before this TIME, AOL mega-media-conglomerate we have now). At the time they had an album in the can which could have been released on Warner's if the Huskers wanted. Warner's really wanted it. Flip You Wig was an improvement over the Husker great New Day Rising. It was high energy and even had some \\"singles\\" they could maybe get into college music bins.  <br /> <br />But being the perennial nice guys they are, the Huskers felt they owed SST one last album. It was released with so-so push and hardly any marketing and little exposure... the kind of stuff the Huskers were trying to get away from by going to a big lable. I mean what musician wouldn't want their fans in Sweetwater, VA to be able to buy their records? <br /> <br />So Warner's had to wait and got \\"Candy Apple Grey\\" instead, a good album no doubt, but no \\"Wig\\" either. It's uneven in parts and just not their best work. The Mould/Hart division was noticeable on \\"Wig\\", but the songs seemed like separate jewel settings; individual but part of a whole. On \\"Candy Apple\\" the songs seem to have walls around them, except for the back to back Mould songs in the middle. Somehow they got away with this on \\"Warehouse\\" but it doesn't work here. Still, it was Husker Du. Back then you knew they'd have another album out in a few days.
0743454537|4.0|I loved this book. The writing style and unique prose drove the amazing and creative plot home. Anna, a thirteen-year-old girl, was created solely for the purpose of helping her seventeen-year-old older sister Kate survive. Kate is a victim of leukemia, and hers is a rare case. So Anna was conceived as a blood-marrow match. And so, for the past thirteen years, Anna has given Kate everything that she needs to survive: from cord blood to marrow all to the way to the approaching surgery for one of Anna's kidneys. <br /> <br />Here's the snag. Anna doesn't want to give up her kidney. It's a surgery that could kill both of them in the process, and Kate might not even survive the relapse of her cancer. So Anna hires a lawyer, Campbell Alexander, who has some old history with another legal officer working on the case... <br /> <br />The story line is so conbined that you'd think that Jodi Piccoult wouldn't keep it straight. Not true. All the elements fit together like puzzle pieces. This book has romance and family troubles, court law and fire fighting. <br /> <br />But then Piccoult throws in an ending that's all wrong. No one should be prepared for it. True, it's a beautifully written ending, but there are other endings that would have worked SO MUCH BETTER! It was a great book with a crappy ending.
B00006ZCFH|4.0|Erykah Badu seems to be one of those lightening rod artists - people either love her music or hate it.  I'm in the \\"love camp\\" myself and applaud her effort to change and re-invent her sound. It gets boring to hear an artist stay in the same small box and basically sing the same songs or type of songs over & over.<br /><br />I recently had the pleasure of seeing Badu live for the first time @ The Sugar Water Festival and she was on fire!  Although she only performed 5 songs, she tore it up (especially when she performed \\"Danger\\").<br /><br />When I initially bought this disc in 2003, it was definitely a way to feed my music jones and kept me interested in Badu and now, I eagerly await her next full length album.<br /><br />My personal faves off this disc are:  Danger, I Want You, Back In The Day & Love of My Life Worldwide.<br /><br />I agree with a previous poster who suggests buying the disc at Target or Best Buy if you can get it for a lower price or buying it used - true fans won't be disappointed after adding WWU to their collection!
B00005QXXO|5.0|1) OK well the sound here is not exactly like you get from the studio.  DUH! There is no possible way to reproduce the sound of a live concert like this on your home stereo unless your stereo is IN the venue and your stereo IS the sound system. But they did a pretty good job. Not great but good. <br /> <br />2) What Radiohead aims for in a live setting is DIFFERENT than what they would aim for on a studio recording. A studio recording can have a zillion layers of misc. sounds. Here they have to use emulators or synths or tapes so they don't have as many choices. And Radiohead IS a more studio oriented band. However they are ARTISTS so what you hear here is artistic and very interesting.  <br /> <br />But it's cool. It's a nice CD. Well worth hearing. I'm too jaded to say I'm a diehard Radiohead fan. But they are a great rock band at times. This kind of stuff can't last long so get it while it lasts.
B000002HMH|5.0|The direction Metallica went on Load shows EXACTLY what they stood for since the beginning. Going with their instinct, doing what THEY felt they felt necessary to express themselves, regardless of what backlash some people may give. This album brought Metallica on a level above the entire genre of metal. They showed that unlike most metal bands, they can write beautiful, melodic music, and try new things. In fact, this album may be more metal than most, due to its heavy blues influence. After all, blues was one of the biggest influences on the formation of heavy metal. Now onto the album itself. <br /> <br />Load has a great variety of styles. You have powerful, up-tempo rockers like 'Wasting My Hate' 'Ain't My Bitch' and 'Cure'. A soft rocker with an intense bridge/outro in 'Hero Of The Day', and one of the biggest surprises of the album, the country-esque tune 'Mama Said'. Which is an absolutely beautiful tribute from James to his deceased mother, and anybody with a heart should be able to appreciate. Yet the highlights of Load in my opinion, are the epic rock classics 'Bleeding Me' and 'Outlaw Torn'. The lyrics, the solos, the riffs, the beats, everything about these songs is perfect and brilliant. Metal or not, these songs will go down in history as pieces of amazing artwork. <br /> <br />In summation, although the average metalhead will tell you they only like 'old Metallica', the MUSIC fan will be able to appreciate Load for what it is. Just because it isn't metal, doesn't mean it isn't good. Metallica took a daring risk that most metal bands would be scared to death of taking in their careers. And it pays off, as the music on this album comes from the heart, and shines with brilliance that only Metallica has been able to deliver.
B0008KLVG4|5.0|JAWS was a great movie. I thought it was cool how people got attacked by \\"JAWS\\". It was kind of scary which was cool. I think Jaws was just plain AWESOME! Now, I need to see Jaws 2!
B0009KA7BS|5.0|I actually looked at the dvd on amazon first to see what everyone was saying and the negative reviews can really color your judgement of something.  I put off seeing it for a while but I just did and I was riveted.  Usually when I watch a movie at home I am always doing something or paying attention to something else but this movie really held my rapt attention.  Since I don't read comics my judgement wasn't colored by that.  The performances were good and there was even comedy.  So if you want to watch a good action/horror flick then you should really see Constantine.
0553260111|1.0|I gave this book 3 chances. I first tried to read it 10+ years ago but gave up because I could not follow the plot. Then I watched the movie 2 months ago and thought of giving the book another chance. I have to force myself to finish the book this time because I do not want to waste my money. <br /> <br />I lost count of how many times the phase \\"Delta is for Caine and Caine is for Delta\\" were being repeated unnecessarily. In fact, I get irritated when I see this pointless repetition. <br /> <br />I still cannot understand the plot to write anything good about this book.
B0009KA7BS|5.0|The Film Constantine, directed by Francis Lawrence, written by Kevin Brodbin and staring Keanu Reeves has only been out a short while and already has garnered enough acclaim to rank itself as a modern classic. The exciting, action loaded film follows the continuing saga of dark soul John Constantine, demon hunter. Punished by God to wonder the streets of Earth, for an attempted suicide, he now must 'earn' his way back into the grace of the almighty. To do this, he must hunt down and 'excorcise' every sort of demonic beast that plague's mankind. Aiding him are a host of penitent souls who have sinned and wish to redeem themselves. To make matters worse, is the Archangel Gabriel who wants to step up the 'final' conflict and match powers with Lucifer himself. Caught in-between their cosmic battle is Constantine, who must atone for his sin with self-sacrifice and brute power over the army of the dammed. Extremely good film and exciting from beginning to end. ****
B0009A1AS2|5.0|Just a brief summary of the album in two words - it rocks!  I was pleasantly surprised.  Not that I don't always expect 'some type of excellence' from DT, but this album could arguably be their best.  This comes from someone who listened to Awake once a week for 10 years.   <br /> <br />This album definitely has some SMPTe, Spock's Beard, Kansas, S. Vai and U2 influences in it.  It is really dynamic, and kind of 'scattered' (no concept album here), but it is awesome.  If you like prog rock, definitely check this one out.  It will make a fitting edition to your collection. <br /> <br />The chord progressions are pretty cool.  A lot of nice minor pentatonic/harmonic minor combinations in both rhythms and chord progressions.  No straight blues riffs on this album. <br /> <br />This is arguably their best album.  I liked on track #1 where they did a 'throwback' to one of the songs on Train of Thought.  Considering all - this is probably closer to 'Images and Words' than anything they have put out (what a great album!), but it stands alone as its own work.  James LaBrie gives one of his best performances.  All 5 guys are great as usual. <br /> <br />Don't just take my word for it.  If you like prog rock, do yourself a favor and pick up a copy of this album.  I promise you won't regret it.
B00097DX3U|4.0|My ex ladyfriend absolutely loved and adored this band. Having never listened to this band before meeting her, I was harangued (willingly) to listen to this group. I have already reviewed Audioslave's first album and it made me take notice of this alternative rock band out of the US. 'Out Of Exile' is the album's name but many fans and rock listener's see this album as Audioslave Mark 2. It was released in early May 2005 to a expecting fanbase and it didn't disappoint. The songs 'Out Of Exile', 'Be Yourself' are truly exceptional and by far the best tracks on this 12 track album. 'Be Yourself' is at the moment recieving much radio time and the song deserves it. For the message in this song is just for people to not hide behind make believe and lies and just 'be yourself'.<br /><br />The first 6 songs are truly the best part of the album and the last part of the album starts to fade out in creativity and lyrical magic. Hence only four stars. But in saying that, this album is a must buy for any fan of Audioslave. Forget Nirvana...this band is much better.
B00005JMCW|5.0|This is one of the most entertaining comedies I have seen in a long time.  I started smiling from the start up tune \\"Happy Together\\" by the Turtles and didn't stop until long after Simple Plan finished their version at the end.<br /><br />Jamie Lee Curtis is absolutely brilliant as Tess Coleman, a harried psychiatrist with two children, about to remarry after the death of her husband.  Lindsay Lohan plays her daughter Anna, a rebellious teenager who can't see eye to eye with her mother.<br /><br />Comparing the Lindsay Lohan of this movie with the wafer thin girl she has become, it should be noted that she looked so much prettier, happier and healthier then, that I wish she'd look back at this movie and go out and eat something.<br /><br />You already know that this is a \\"switch\\" movie, and thanks to Lucille Soong as an interfering old woman, the switch is done with the crisp snap of a fortune cookie.  Both Curtis and Lohan handle the change in their characters admirably, and soon both Tess and Anna get a first hand understanding of each other's rather complicated lives.<br /><br />Mark Harmon has a supporting role as Tess' fianc&eacute; Ryan, and Chad Michael Murray plays Anna's love interest Jake, but this movie is all about the female leads as they get a new perspective, earn each other's respect and generally change each other, while at the same time delivering the laughs.<br /><br />Tess and Anna switch<br /><br />Fortune cookie lets them be<br /><br />\\"Happy Together\\"<br /><br />Amanda Richards, July 25, 2005
0962477060|1.0|I bought this under the impression that it would delve into theory, and give me more than patterns that any musically inclined person could discover on their own.   <br /> <br />  Perhaps this would be useful to a beginning guitarist, but if you've played for more than a few months, taken some lessons, or have internet access, this is decidedly not worth the money.
B0009XNUK0|5.0|Whoa!!!!! Where did this come from? Without any hype or media attention, Sony has just released \\"The Essential Michael Jackson\\" (37 tracks, 157 min.), perhaps the ultimate Michael Jackson compilation.<br /><br />CD 1 (20 tracks, 79 min.) cover the period up to and including the \\"Thriller\\" album, starting with the best known Jackson 5 singles such as \\"ABC\\" and \\"I Want You Back\\", then shifting to the Jacksons. It would have been better to include \\"State of Shock\\" or \\"Lovely One\\" instead of \\"Enjoy Yourself\\". CD1 finishes off with 7 of the 9 \\"Thriller\\" album tracks (the other 2 being \\"Baby Be Mine\\" and \\"The Lady in My Life\\"; it's still hard to believe how successfull that album really was, and how many hits were relased from it, in the days when \\"radio tracks\\" meant actual vinyl single releases). This was of course Michael at his absolute best, now 23 years ago.<br /><br />CD2 (17 tracks, 78 min.) compiles 8 tracks from \\"Bad\\" and 7 from \\"Dangerous\\", and finishes off with \\"You Are Not Alone\\" from HIStory and \\"You Rock My World\\" from Invincible. In other words: only 2 tunes from the post-1992 era, and rightfully so, even though the HIStory and Invincible albums are not nearly as bad or mediocre as many would like you to believe. The only track that arguably should be on here (but, at 78 min. already, at the expense of what other track then?) is \\"Scream\\", the No. 1 duet with sister Janet.<br /><br />In the end, this \\"essential\\" compilation is better than any other compilation available (HIStory Vol. 1; Number Ones, etc.) as it covers both the Jackson 5/Jacksons era and his solo output. It's very strange to me that this was released without any hype or advertizing campaign, but the main thing is that it's out and available. Hihgly recommended!
B00005NGAL|4.0|I enjoyed the DVD.  It was great fun.
B0007P3582|2.0|Massacre feels like a commercial rehash of the excellent Get Rich or Die Tryin'. Not any memorable songs on this album and the lyrics are brain-dead. The beats are rotten for the most part. There are a few stand-out songs, but looking at the album compared to 50's previous album and even other G-Unit albums this is a huge step backward.  <br />Reccomended songs: I'm Supposed to Die Tonight, Gunz come Out, My Toy Soldiers (feat Tony Yayo), Hate it or Love It Remix
0764110284|5.0|If you are serious about learning the English language as a non-native learner, you'll enjoy this book. It covers the subject thoroughly, with a more practical approach than others. I think this book is the best because you learn phrasal verbs in contest, as they are used everyday. An academic approach can be misleading, and useless, for the non-native learner. The approach is very user-friendly, and intuitive. Very good for intermediate and advanced learners.
B000084T18|5.0|This album is filled with great beats and flow. Much better than the brain-dead \\"The Massacre\\". This album is amazing. There are some rotten tracks such as \\"Poor Lil Rich\\", \\"Gotta Make it To Heaven\\", and \\"Blood Hound\\". Other than those the album is great. It's too bad \\"The Massacre\\" could not have been at least half as good as this.  <br />Recomend songs: Don't Push Me, U not like me(best song on the album), Heat.
B00005AXEL|2.0|I was hoping with all the hype surrounding TISLs release that we were in for a special treat. Come to find.....it was not what I was hoping for. I do not totally dislike this album.....but it does not hold up to past Stevie Nicks Material. I have been a fan of Stevie since Buckingham Nicks, so this was not easy for me to admit....but I have to be honest.
B0007OY2MG|4.0|These movies are great. I wish I could have a great relationship with my mother as Rory has with hers. They are like best friends and I think it is great to be like that with your loved ones.
B000002L9B|5.0|Do not buy or watch the movie. (it sucks) But buy the soundtrack to this brillant album. I remember listening to \\"Kiss\\" in eariler in  Febuary 1986 and was amazed by how funky the song was (no bass lines and ascoustic guitar)  and thought \\"he's going back to his old skol sound\\" But when the album was released at first I \\"hated\\" it. But it grew on me the more I listened to it,( I spent the whole summer listening to this brillant album) as a whole with Prince albums it grew on me. it is a true band effort from the Revolution and Prince allowing this gifted band a hand in his creativity.  <br /> <br />The ace in Prince's hole was Wendy and Lisa, their pop creativity on this is album cannot be overstated. both ARE from families who are arrangers, these songs have a beautiful guality especially the ballads.But the musicanship is top -notch from all the members of this incerdible band. (who knows what they could have done in music had they stayed together)the album is so French influenced in spirt (maybe not musically) the songs take you to Paris and you don't want to leave. <br /> <br />listening to the album made me want to expand my musical pallete from the opening Pet Sounds -like \\"Christopher Tracy's Parade to the Joni Mitchell -like \\"Sometimes It Snows in April that closes it,Prince introduces these diverse sounds but never leaves his purple funk behind nor his gifts for pop songcraft.From the torch song \\"Under the Cherry Moon\\" to the brillant pop of \\"Mountians\\" with it's  Sly Stone - like funky ending to the French shuffle \\"Do you Lie\\" and the three Prince and the Revolution classics \\"KISS\\", 'Girls and Boys\\"  and \\"You Need Another Lover\\" This is a musical genius in his Prime along with the tightest band I have heared in the last 20 years.  This album MADE me want to listen to more diverse sounds and groups and it's one of my desert island faves. <br /> <br /> <br />
B00092ZMDY|5.0|I purchased this disk after viewing the television special.  This is twice as good as the tv show!!!  The eagles remain one of the icons in the music industry.  They are not only easy on the ears, but they are talented beyond description.  The commentary section gives some great insight ito the band.  Buy it .. you'll love it!!!! <br /> <br />Favorite song (hard to pick one) - No More Cloudy Days
B0002XVQNU|2.0|This movie may be better with the added footage, but that does not make Ben Afleck a better superhero.  I'm not a Ben Afleck hater, but the choreographed fights are a pain to watch.  There could have been many other actors to play the role of DD much better.  I suppose they just wanted a big name to sell tickets, but that's where they flopped.  Jennifer Garner does well along with the others for a movie that is only so-so anyway, but I just didn't enjoy watching Afleck pretend that he knows some kind of martial arts with his limited flexability.  This is why there will not be a sequal.

B000002BYD|5.0|Yield (1998.), the Pearl Jam's fifth studio album<br /><br />The Pearl Jam are without doubt, in my opinion, the greatest band of the 1990's. From their immortal debut album 'Ten', the greatest selling Seattle album ever, and onwards, the Pearl Jam have consitently produced awesome music very rarely dropping below the highest possible level of greatness. By the end of the 1990's, the Pearl Jam were practically the only band remaining from the grunge explosion nearly ten years earlier, in most part due to their own altering style and ability to 'break' from the grunge mold and diversify their sound. 'Yield', the Pearl Jam's fifth studio album, released in 1998 is the band's final outing for the 90's (NOT their final album!!!) and it is one hell of a good one!<br /><br />When I listen to any of the Pearl Jam's releases after 'Ten', I have to be realistic. 'Ten' is just phenominal, a perfect flawless album which I believe is almost impossible to top, however, in my opinion, 'Yield' is not far away in greatness, and thats saying an awful lot! After a very masterful and experimental 'No Code', 'Yield' is a return by the band to a more hard rocking sound, with grungy hints of 'Ten' or 'Vs.'. The album was rightfully critically acclaimed at the time of its release by many critics BUT however, it has never sold as many as you would have expected it to (about 4-5 million worldwide, which is NOT many for an album is amazing as this!). However, you've gotta remember that this is the Pearl Jam, the band that withdrew from the spotlight in the mid-1990's and are an underground band at heart who focus on making great music, not the profits that come from it. As I've said above, 'Yield' is much more rock based than 'No Code' however, it doesn't stop any experimental moments from the band including a 1 minute untitled drum showcase and some unusual moments in the song 'Push Me, Pull Me'. Afterall, every Pearl Jam album has a little bit of wierdness and that's what in some ways makes their albums so unique. The 'Yield' album also marked the first time that the band had made music videos since the song 'Jeremy'. This was more part of a record contractual obligation than anything (remember the Pearl Jam just don't DO music videos, its not part of their style!) however, the anime-styled video of 'Do The Evolution' is a pretty interesting watch.<br /><br />The album itself begins with the blistering 'Brain of J', a great hard rocking song. Vedder's howling vocals are back straight away with this song. The song has a deep thundercracking ending which is really cool, and it then runs perfectly into 'Faithful', a song with an awesome starting riff and some great bass playing from Jeff Ament. 'No Way' is a much more mellow sounding track and one of my personal favourites on the album, some of the guitar work is captivating in parts. 'Given To Fly' is one of the more well known tracks off the album, itself being a radio staple, Eddie Vedder sings this one with real emotion. Next up is 'Wishlist' were Eddie Vedder sings about wishing to be a weird variety of things from neutron bombs to Christmas trees! Its a great song, to be followed by 'Pilate', a thoughtful starting song which has a real rocking chorus. 'Do The Evolution' has to be the most powerful song on the album. Aside from being an aggressive, howling song, some of the words are almost prophetic with a number of the lines relating very much to the troubles in the world now (you'll see when you listen to it). Following this is a minute long untitled song which is kind of some experimental drum work from Jack Irons. Some people have criticised this song but I think it breaks the album up well. 'MFC' follows this which is another short and sweet hard rocker. 'Low Light' is a great slower song, with more passionate singing from Vedder and a killer guitar solo from Mike McCready towards the end of the track. Another slower track, 'In Hiding' is also excellent, featuring some catchy rhythms and moregreat lyrics. 'Push Me, Pull Me, is the most experimental track on the album. It has a weird start which sounds like a washing machine in operation! The song is kind of reminiscent to 'I'm Open' from 'No Code' with Vedder doing voice overs in parts, except this track is much more racier. If the album couln't get much better then we have the closing track, 'All Those Yesterdays'. A slow, almost lullaby-like song with an almost hypnotic nature to it (its another example of the Pearl Jam doing exceptional closing songs). Also there is a hidden track, which is an interesting Spanish/Latin American song with some clever guitar work and heavy drumming.<br /><br />'Yield' is a masterpiece. The Pearl Jam have done some exceptional stuff during their time but this is up there near the top. Every song is great and it is almost impossible to pick a favourite because they're all so good! If there was any doubt as to the Pearl Jam's greatness, they dispelled it with this album and its has ultimately confirmed them with the greats. 'Yield' is a must buy ... next time your in the record shop, just look for the album with the road sign on the front and get it, you'll have no regrets obtaining this classic!Pull Me, is the most experimental track on the album.

B000059Z8J|5.0|I bet you, \\"Superman: The Movie\\" was as exciting and excellent back then the same way \\"Spider-Man\\" is with today's audiences. I liked the credit effects at the beginning and end (as you may have noticed; it sure seemed pretty difficult to make the end credits that way!), and...and...just watch this movie and you'll find out the rest! <br /> <br />Finding the movie, especially on a constantly-used DVD, can be quite difficult - being a two sided DVD, unlike most others, this one doesn't say which side's the movie side and which side's the bonus features side. It just says \\"Superman: The Movie: Extended Edition\\" on both the inner rim labels. <br /> <br />Finally, while the picture quality is quite satisfying, the audio - claiming it's Dolby 5.1, actually sounded more like mono to me! (I listened to this through my headphones, BTW) <br /> <br />Definately the ultimate of all the two-siders!
B0007XT87G|2.0|I bought this cd because every time i came here to Amazon.com and looked at shredding, prog-rock/metal i would get a Porcupine Tree recommendation. Well, prog-heads, this isnt prog. Far from it. <br /> <br /> There are very few guitar solos, not much riffing (there is a bit, tho) songs sound like angst-radio oriented hard rock, almost nu-metal, but not metal. No prog here, some slightly off/wierd bits to be sure, but that doesnt make it prog. To be fair, the album is well produced, musicianship is good though there is no shredding. I didnt care for the lame songwriting, could almost pass for Staind or some such lousy band, just somewhat different. <br /> <br />Fans of shredding bands like Dream Theater, Symphony X, Spiral Architect, etc should stay away from crap like this.

This is a funny story about (very cute) twins who meet after being seperated, switch places and try to get their parents back together. heartwarming, a winner all the way!
B000002J1Y|5.0|I find i enjoy the LPs(Japanese then US) more than the Cds, the tempo just seems hurried on the Cds,the recent Japanese HDCD release sounds completely different to me,with much more information than its LP counterparts or previous CDs.NextI like the original 3CD release it's better than the later 2CD release.
B000067J1Q|3.0|This movie is okay, but don't ask any teens to watch it. I have to admit, it is a rather charming musical. Older people (I say that with the highest amount of respect)will probably enjoy along with young kids and Julie Andrews fans.
B0009A40ES|5.0|Its that simple, there are people who will watch it and love every joke at the 80's over indulgance. They will love the way a man is dedicated to appearing perfect. The way he \\"needs\\" to fit in, and the many dark humorous twists as he falls down his own inner hole.  <br />Others will see this as a silly movie, and wont understand why you want to see it over and over again. Its dark, its a little gory, but i laugh at every violent scene in the movie.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|This movie is excellent for the holidays or anytime (it's july and I just got done watching it!!)Will Rarrell is hilarious and this movie is appropriate for kids, but parents will love it too!! IMO, this is one if the best movies of all time.
B00004RJ74|3.0|The first half of this movie is very Quinten Tarantino, the dialogue and the way everything is paced reminds me of his other movies alot.  The second half drops a little in quality and the dialogue that is Tarantino becomes average TV movie talk.  Harvey Keitel would have been alot better without his Texas accent, but he was still good.  Tarantino's character was interesting and not what I would have expected, but I wish that they would've spent more time on him once he turned into a vampire.  George Clooney's character, Seth, was exactly like every other character I've seen him play.  Clooney is probably one of the least versatile actors I know of.  As this is a Robert Rodriguez film it wouldn't be complete without his leading lady, Salma Hayek.  This film contains a scene featuring her for not long enough, but it's definately a high point in the movie for any male.  As this is a vampire movie, and it is sold as a vampire movie, one of the things preventing me from classifying it as \\"Very Good\\" is the fact that vampires really don't have a big part in it at all.  Sure, they have a long stretch (featuring Tom Savini acting, which is great) but the film doesn't have the feel of a vampire movie's sense of dread.  It may be funny at times, but the vampires aren't used enough throughout the story as a threat.  The police are played up as more of an enemy as the vampires, and that to me is sad.  Another thing is that this movie is about 1 hr. 40 minutes or so, yet it feels like a movie drags on forever.  Anyway, it's still an entertaining film and I recommend it to anyone interested, but I cannot in anyway guarantee that you will enjoy it. <br /> <br />NOTE: <br /> <br />This film is for no one under 13 years old.
B000066C1N|4.0|I bought this CD a while ago and still enjoy it!! Bryan Adams is a good singer and the songs are really meaningful. however; he is the only singer for all the songs, so some may get a little bored with it. I liked it and it's a fun cd to listen to
B00006LPER|5.0|Elfriede Jelinek was occupied e.g. with Condoleezza Rice. The present American Foreign Minister in her Denver-childhood was pushed by her parents exactly the same way into the role of a classical Pianist, as Elfriede Jelinek in Vienna had to experience this sort of oppression at her own body. In her novel \\"The Piano Player\\" the winner of the Nobel-prize (Literature) brings up for discussion in a satirical, sarcastic, cynical, yes shameless way, which sort of soul-destructive dominance mothers in their four domestic walls can unfold, if they are out-pushed from the public job-career-life (still generally the superiority is the male preference). The mother of Elfiede Jelinek after 1945 led negotiations on reparation payments at Austria with Russia - until male persons (leaving the prisoner-of-war-camps, returned, recovered) pushed away female persons from political functions and other jobs. Jelinek converts those experiences in her novel, filled up with certain autobiographic patterns, and there are parallels to the American Condoleezza Rice (by the way \\"Condi\\" learned Russian to be able to participate effectively at disarmament negotiations between the USA and the Soviet Union ). A stylish seeker of word-using Elfriede Jelinek chose the form of the ice-cold satire, maybe the best way, to reach the necessary distance against things, which have hurt a person very deeply. Franz Kafka by the way wrote probably less based in depression and despair than acting out of a control room of a tremendously biting Jewish humor: The ability to understand this sort of language-use was lost nearly completely after the extinction of the Jewish culture under the Nazi rule in the German-speaking countries . Jelinek therefore assumes, she is understood really correctly neither by the enthusiastic praising price lenders nor by rageful-hateful raving province journalists. Perhaps by Condoleezza Rice, if she had enough time to analyse such novels - and movie-scripts. Madeleine Albright, the Prague fled Rice- and Colin Powell-predecessor in the minister-office of foreign affairs, she is friendly with Condoleezza Rice; the two women noticed the structural comparability of their trauma: Albright, threatened with death by the Nazis and later on bored by the communists, Rice, colored, threatened by the race hatred in the Ku-klux-klan-environment of the 1960-years in the US Southern States. Elfriede Jelinek felt threatened by her prevail-addicted mother. The education-atmosphere at home had been formed by the typical middle-class-aim, to climb up the social ledder, in order to \\"make things better\\". Mother Jelinek (and the Rice-parents) focused the education-energy on the only child (a procession not divided, because there are existing no brothers and sisters). Condoleezza Rice became not a pianist (the at-first-wish of her parents and herself) but a Foreign Minister with energy-loaded rage on woman-despising Islamic states, unmarried and equally irreconcilably bitingly as the Austrian writer. Jelinek already for a long time didn't practice on her costly Steinway piano, but she became a language-composing Nobel-prize-winner - vulnerable, fighting against a disputable group of austrian politicians, but retired, fearfully withdrawn living, nevertheless relatively consolidated by a husband and by her special sort of biting humor. Condoleezza Rice, sometimes nicknamed as the US-American \\"war princess\\" or \\"Terminatrix\\", maybe the world shoud hope, that a little bit more of austrian humor and ability to see things ironically will find a way into Condi's strategy. Based on such comparisons and knowledge backgrounds about curriculi vitae, opposing the education-atmospheres of these women, you maybe understand the \\"Piano Player\\" in a more sophisticated way ...Prague fled Rice- and Colin Powell-predecessor in the minister-office of foreign affairs, she is friendly with Condoleezza Rice; the two women noticed the structural comparability of their trauma: Albright, threatened with death by the Nazis and later on bored by the communists, Rice, colored, threatened by the race hatred in the Ku-klux-klan-environment of the 1960-years in the US Southern States.

B00000JLWW|5.0|I've  seen this movie at least dozen times and every time, I still cry!! I've always been interested in the sinking of titanic and this movie was absolutlely amazing!! Kate Winlset was so incredible, she is definately my fave actress and a star to watch. if by some sad twist of fate you haven't seen this movie yet, buy it now, no one doesn't not like it!!!
B000002J1O|5.0|I just wrote up a few things about the Lamb and thought about saying a few words about Selling England.  It is hard for me to imagine a more satisfying listening of progressive rock music that this remastered recording.  Most rock music from this period sounds so dull now but not this one.  There is a freshness of sound that hits one right in the face, such as Gabriel's vocal variety and tone, Hackett's wonderful guitar licks that add just the right atmosphere, Banks' almost symphonic keyboard excursions and background ambience, Rutherford's exquisite bass playing, and Collins' precise and melodic drumming.  They had it together in composition and performance for this release.   If you like Selling England, don't miss out on the Lamb which is equalling enthralling.  I am right now listening to Captain Beefheart (after 20 years!) and I think he's marvelous.  When I listened to Yes, ELP, Pink Floyd, Rush, Led Zepplin, Black Sabbath, and other bands lately, I couldn't help thinking how boring that all sounds compared to early Genesis.  I think the next logical step for those who truly love music, like me, is to explore modern  classical music: Steve Reich, Cage, Sir Maxwell Davies, Stravinsky, Messaien, Schoenberg, Berg, etc. since there is so little coming out these days in rock music which is truly great.
B000000WHX|4.0|It's a downright shame that truly alternative music like Massive Attack was never accepted within the United States' oxymoronic mainstream Alternative music movement. It's a shame a musician or singer had to be a flannel-clad, unwashed drug addict to be heard in the 90's (you know who I mean, Nirvana).  <br /> <br />Blue Lines is a breath of fresh air even for today's era, but especially for the era from which it came from. And we all needed a breath of fresh air from those stinkin', heroin-shootin' Grungees. Blue Lines has a weird, ominous, yet soulful vibe to it. The low bass beats give songs like \\"Safe From Harm\\" and \\"Unfinished Symphony\\" a mysterious feel, and the female vocals make it funky. \\"Safe\\" has the creepiest b/w music video to go along with it.
B00005BJ9W|5.0|Rio is my all time favorite album. I actually had 3 vinyl copies of Rio because the grooves wore out. I thought that this CD was actually very good. I especially liked the packaging. As far as the music, I think that Duran Duran achieved perfection with this album. I love every track on it. If you do not like new wave music this is not the album for you. All of the instruments blend to make some of the best songs ever recorded. No, there is nothing life changing about this album, but when I am down there is nothing like listening to Rio to make me feel happy again.
068987474X|5.0|I loved this book!  It takes the personal hurt out of being rejected.  I am no longer upset if a guy doesn't call me or ask me out.  It is easy to look at the situation as...he's just not that into me instead of why, o, why isn't he calling me.  This book makes being single a little easier for the average woman.  I think that every women single or taken should read this book because we all deserve a man that is into us!

B0007TKNKG|5.0|Forget Rocky. Forget Rambo. Forget Marion Cobretti. What really put Stallone on the map in my opinion is \\"Over the Top.\\" This movie is a true inspiration. <br /> <br />I sometimes wonder if this movie was based on a true story. IT'S JUST THAT GOOD. I remember when I was a kid watching this movie. Every time I watched this movie, I wished Stallone was MY dad. I still do. He would not only be the coolest and best-looking dad ever, but he would also be rich. (The only drawback being that he would have named me something like \\"Sage Moonblood\\" or \\"Seargeoh\\" instead of just \\"Clint\\", but that would still be cool. I wouldn't have to make up a name for when I play Dungeons and Dragons - I could just use my real name instead.) <br /> <br />In this movie, the cool truck-driving dad teaches his young snot-nosed brat kid how to be a REAL man through arm-wrestling. Plus, it features a giant semi driving through the front of a house. Could anything be cooler than that? I don't think so. I mean, what else could anybody want in a movie anyway? <br /> <br />I thought it was really neat how Stallone, a.k.a. Hawke, turned his hat around when he was really about to lay the arm-wrestling smack down. And the slow-motion arm wrestling scenes were really intense! I've probably watched this movie about 16 times so far, and each time I have found myself wondering if Hawke is really going to win. (Of course he does, but it makes the movie more exciting to watch over and over again if you pretend that you don't know!) <br /> <br />Lots of times after I watched this movie, I would challenge my friends in school to a great Arm-Wrestling Duel. I would make sure that I wore my hat that day. I would challenge the big kid who made fun of me for having a wadded-up paper towel in my underwear (a little personal problem of mine), and would get ready to kick some... I would wait until he had my arm almost all the way down, and then I would turn my hat around backwards. Unfortunately, that never seemed towork for me like it did in the movie. I always got beat anyway (and then they'd give me a wedgie just for good measure).  <br /> <br />So that was disappointing, but I never lost my faith that one day the hat trick would work for me. I just chalked it up to Stallone not being on my team - not \\"having my back\\", so to speak. So even today so many years later, I try to solve my disputes through a good friendly arm-wrestling match. It's a great way to make friends, and it helps you to solve problems with your boss and the wife, too. I give Sylvester Stallone credit for teaching us this Peace Through Arm-Wrestling technique. In fact, it's more than a technique. It's a way of life. <br /> <br />Stallone, you're my Hero. You've put me OVER THE TOP!!!

0156027321|5.0|Religion and zookeeping are the two themes that wind through this story of a young Indian boy who ponders religion and employs his knowledge of zookeeping to co-exist with a tiger on a lifeboat. <br /> <br />The story is engaging, there's a nice twist toward the end of the story, and at the very end the author adds something you rarely see in a novel - discussion questions!  While their mere presence was a bit odd, these questions shed valuable light on the story's message, expose the author's sly humor, and have kept me thinking on the story a week after finishing the book.  I'd actually like to re-read the story with an eye toward the issues raised by the discussion questions, especially the similarity between zookeeping and religion and our role as animals in the world religion's grand zoo! <br /> <br />Well worth reading!
B0002M3V0C|5.0|The best freaking song on this album is \\"RAGDOLL\\" and it stinks that they did not include it on the standard version. This means that a lot of people who purchased the regular version will not be exposed to it plus it is also not included in the sheet music for the album. The only song I wanted the music for was \\"Ragdoll\\", and it is not in the book! C'mon! That's real music, you can't figure it out by ear!<br /><br />Buy this album for \\"RAGDOLL\\" alone. I purchased it for \\"This Love\\" and \\"Harder to Breathe\\", and now those aren't even my favorite songs on the album! They have won me over and if they stick with that fresh, funk-blues jive, I will be a fan forever.
0671034065|5.0|This book is hilarious!  Suspense, sexy, funny--tried to read it at work during our slow times, and actually laughed out loud, more than once.  People were looking at me like I was nuts!  We passed it around the office, each time--same results--laughing out loud.  We could not put it down til we finished it.  Loved it so much--I'm going to buy it for myself and read it again.  I loved it!  Written very well, would make an awesome movie, but I'm afraid the book (like always) would be far better.  If you like to laugh and like suspense, and just an all around quick, good read---THIS IS IT!
B0002OERI0|5.0|American Idiot has revived my hope for the future of rock music and for the future of what many have said to be the greatest american rock band ever, GREEN DAY!!! These guys rock, you can't deny it, unless you're some jerk who is too stubborn to open up your ears (I know theres a lot of you out there). And listen up, I'm sick of everyone saying \\"HEY! I'm a Green Day Fan!!\\" If your favorite Green Day songs are Good Riddance and Boulevard of Broken Dreams then you are NOT a true Green Day fan, you are a POSER!! (you know who you are) And you're definitely NOT a TRUE Green Day fan if you jumped on the Green Day bandwagon this year when American Idiot came out. If you like songs such as Geek Stink Breath, Basket Case, 2,000 Light Years Away, Hitchin A Ride, and Walking Contradiction then congratulations, you're a TRUE GD fan! Also, if you are Republican or support George W. Bush and you like Green Day, then you are obviously not listening to the words of American Idiot and Holiday because they SLAM Bush!! So all you Green Day Fans/Republicans need to get away from Green Day cause they are telling you how much Bush sucks with their lyrics! They HATE Bush!! Especially Billie Joe! (its the truth) American Idiot is MAXIMUM Green Day at their finest with a mix classic tone and innovation that shows how much this band has really matured. So if you support Bush, dont put your filthy hands on this masterpiece cause you're just another stupid sheep that follows the herd. After all, thats how he got re-elected!! BUY THIS ALBUM IMMEDIATELY
B00025ETIW|5.0|I first heard about My Chemical Romance when a friend was buying their CD for her friend's birthday, and I didn't think twice. Months later I saw the CD on sale at FYE and listened to it. Man Gerard Way just can SING out those emotions, not to mention catchy music too. These guys are like the best male emo band in the world. They put crap like Simple Plan to shame. All of the songs are catchy and have great melodies. I can't help but feel Gerard's emotions as he wails over these amazing punk melodies. This CD is a must for any punk/emo fan and any fan of good music. These guys prove that there is hope for music.
B000002G8L|3.0|There must be something special about the Budokan arena in Tokyo. Numerous live albums have been cut there, and while Clapton didn't go with the flow and call his \\"Eric Clapton live at the Budokan\\", he did go to Japan in late 1979 and recorded this live album at the Budokan in December of that year. <br /> <br />\\"Just One Night\\" includes a couple of songs from \\"Backless\\", the album Clapton was touring behind at the time, and a few songs from his guitar hero-period as well. Fans who prefer Clapton's laid-back pop-rock albums should enjoy this album, but those who like him better when he is playing the blues may be disappointed. He does venture in to the blues idiom on several occations, though, and while a dull and lethargic \\"Early In The Morning\\" is worse than no \\"Early In The Morning\\" at all, Clapton's renditions of songs like \\"Worried Life Blues\\" and \\"Double Trouble\\" feature a lot of great guitar playing. \\"Ramblin' On My Mind\\", too, retains the smouldering fire of his earliest recordings, and it is almost impossible to screw up \\"Blues Power\\" and \\"Cocaine\\". <br /> <br />It's a shame that Clapton usually sang the blues in such a subdued and almost detached fashion at this point in his career; later releases prove that he could do much better. But fans of \\"70s Clapton\\" should be thrilled by these fine live versions of \\"Lay Down Sally\\", the pop ballad \\"Wonderful Tonight\\", and Danny Flowers' country-boogie \\"Tulsa Time\\". <br />In general, though, \\"Just One Night\\" is neither as bluesy nor as rocking as one might have hoped for. A bit more groove and a few more crunchy riffs would have been a welcome addition, but it's still a good live album, good enough for some 3 1/2 stars.
B0000C8AW5|4.0|This, strangely, is Bob Dylan's only studio album with The Band backing him, and it really shows what a versatile combo they were.    \\"Planet Waves\\" doesn't contain too many genuine classics, but the sublime \\"Forever Young\\" certainly is one. The jury is still out concerning the status of the swinging \\"Going, Going, Gone\\".  And the opener, \\"One A Night Like This\\", is a fine little gem as well, a really catchy piece of...well, I was going to say country & western, but it's as much folk as it is country, actually, and most of this album is equally hard to pin down stylistically.    Other highlights include the tender ballad \\"Hazel\\", the groovy \\"You Angel You\\" (excellent lead guitar by Robbie Robertson), and the blues-rocker \\"Tough Mama\\". And the Band is terrific all the way through, evne though \\"Planet Waves\\" is less hard rock than most of their collaborations with Dylan (\\"Live 1966\\" comes to mind).   \\"Waves\\" offers a mixture of slow rock, country, folk and R&B, not unlike 1970's relaxed and intimate \\"New Morning\\". It is not really one of Dylan's major albums (some of these songs are a little bit unfocused), but it is a good, enjoyable record in its own right, and a too-rare chance to listen to Bob Dylan working with his greatest ever backing band.
B00005JNJT|3.0|Batman Begins is adifferent than the rest. The begining focuses on emotion and psychology. It's not as dark as Burton's Gotham City and there's a little too much drag before it gets into the good stuff. Once there the movie goes along well and is exciting.
B00005JKDR|5.0|\\"Monsters, Inc.\\"? You want me to talk about \\"Monsters, Inc.\\"? All right, we will. \\"Monsters, Inc.\\", Pixar's fantastic and wacky comedy (its fourth movie), is one of the funniest movies ever made, animated or live-action. It's got elements of the Marx Bros., Mel Brooks, Chaplin and Looney Tunes. It has some of the goofiest-looking characters ever- no two monsters are alike. It has some of the best voice work ever, from big names like John Goodman and Billy Crystal to tiny, 3-year-old (at the time) Mary Gibbs. It has a most original story line, some snazzy designs, a warm kid-friendly message that's refreshing rather than gooey, and guaranteed laugh-out-loud gags that even leave this sober-sided writer rolling on the floor. <br />       The \\"Monsters, Inc.\\" story is well-known, but on the off-chance you've never seen it (for shame!), here it is: Welcome to Monstropolis, the only city in the world where humans are poisonous. Most of its inhabitants work at Monsters, Inc., the giant corporation that produces the city's energy by means of clean \\"scream power\\": the reaction by frightened kids hidden behind electronic doors! A team of \\"scarers\\", assisted by their door operators, create the screams, and if you have so much as a baby bootie on your body, it's time for the CDA (Child Detection Agency) to roar into the plant with a full shutdown by its headless yellow robots. James P. (Sulley) Sullivan, a huge blue furry creature, is the star of the scare floor, with help from his motormouthed green eyeball partner, Mike Wazowski. These are the characters voiced by Goodman and Crystal, respectively, and two of the greatest animated characters ever created.  <br />        All you-know-what breaks loose after a stray after-hours door is opened and a very cute little girl, who has maybe a five-word vocabulary, sneaks into the MI plant. The sequence where Sulley barges into a sushi bar (run by octopi) and the kid pops out of a bag is one of the funniest things you'll eversee- it's a \\"Kid-Tastrophe\\", as a hysterical Muppet-ish TV announcer says. <br />Soon, Sulley and Mike discover that \\"Boo\\", as they nickname the girl, is really a friend, and that people are not poisonous. For the rest, you'll have to watch it, and I'm one who could watch this every night. <br />       If you own just one Pixar DVD, \\"Monsters, Inc.\\" is the one to get, not just because the movie itself is fantastic, but so is the bonus disc. Team Pixar has a great time showing off all their computer, animation and voice tricks with everything from storyboards to early sketches (Sulley was originally dubbed  <br />\\"James P. Johnson\\" and was orange). There are foreign-language clips (watch one five-minute sequence dubbed into everything from Polish to Portuguese- Lisboan and Brazilian), musical portions (Randy Newman's playful Dixieland-ish score and his theme song, sung in character by Crystal and Goodman, won him a long-awaited Oscar), even guest appearances by Sulley and Mike on everything from the ABC Monday Night Football opening to something called \\"Ponkickies\\" (an animated Japanese kiddie breakfast TV show). More than any other Pixar DVD package, the extras are a great show in themselves, satisfying everyone from the tiny tots to the grown-up animation geeks. For that matter, so does the movie.  <br />       I don't know anyone who doesn't love \\"Monsters, Inc.\\", and when you're done with it, you, too, will want your very own one-eyed green Mike to hang out with and do your errands. You'll also have a carload of catchwords (\\"Put-That-Thing-Right-Back-Where-It-Came-From-Or-So-Help-Me!...The Musical!\\") in your head and a great understanding of how, and why, Pixar truly brought animation into the new millennium. Best of all, this movie really is fun for all from three to 93. \\"Monsters, Inc.\\": it's a scream!
B00005JNSK|5.0|From the trailers, I wasn't sure what to expect before seeing this film. I fondly remembered Gene Wilder in the 1971 classic, but since then have read the book by Roald Dahl. The current Burton/Depp version is so much like the book, I was totally impressed. As a matter of fact, much of the dialogue is straight from the book. When I first saw Depp as Wonka, I wasn't sure what to make of his portrayal, but after  2 minutes, I found myself laughing out loud along with the rest of the audience. His interpretation will become a classic on its own merits as did Gene Wilder's.  I am so glad it wasn't simply a Gene Wilder imitation. As for criticisms about not enough character development for the children, again, read the book. We know what these kids are like before they get to the factory, and frankly, couldn't wait for Wonka to work his \\"magic\\" in getting rid of them. The visuals and story flowed so well. Yes, the ending is different than the book, but I felt it worked. Charlie, who seems to not have anything, actually has more than Wonka, who seems to have everything. Very clever! As for the visuals, they're absolutely amazing. Also, the Oompa Loompas were much better than the weird looking ones from the 1971 version. I've heard little 7 year old children saying they loved this movie, as well as senior citizens. It definitely has something for everyone and I found it a \\"sweet treat.\\"
B0006A9FKA|3.0|THAT A SPOOF OF A SPOOF DOESN'T WORK. the reason for that is the comedy becomes too obvious and familiar. george romero's original \\"night of the living dead\\" movies are filled with comedy and satire. in the 1990's peter jackson made a gore soaked comedy, homage/parody of romero's movies called \\"dead alive\\". it was okay, not great. \\"shaun of the dead\\" is yet another comedy, homage/parody of romero's movies. it's more talkie, wittier and less gory than \\"dead alive\\". they are about equally funny. unfortunately  comedy/parodies of \\"night of the living dead\\" are by now (40 years later) almost totally played out and way too obvious. more serious and original new takes on this same material like \\"28 days later\\" and the \\"dawn of the dead\\" remake are much better and are highly recommened  instead of \\"shaun of the dead\\" (or \\"dead alive\\" for that matter). i'm adding 1 star for the very effective comedy before the zombies show up.
B000001FN1|5.0|This is one of those rare examples of the beauty & the beast being one & the same! This is what Metal can sound like when great musicians play great songs behind the greatest voice of its kind - a raw, energetic masterpiece, with bare-bones polish that's never too much.<br /><br />These are all great metal songs, with Doro Pesch at the height of her talents. \\"Kiss of Death\\" is her BEST VOCAL EVER (maybe tied with \\"Save My Soul\\" from Force Majeure), but all the songs are raised to a different level with her incredible abilities. She was always the strength of Warlock, but this album in particular showed the world that women really can rock. Every alterna-rock girl out there today owes her existence to the undisputed Queen of Metal!<br /><br />If you've never heard of Warlock or Doro, this would be a great introduction. But be warned - you 'll want to get \\"Doro\\", \\"Love Me In Black\\", & \\"Fight\\" as well - because one Doro is never enough! If you love Doro like I love Doro, but you don't have this yet, all I can say is.....WHY?
B00005JMAH|3.0|If you're looking for a great match to the third book of the Harry Potter series, this movie may just make you angry.  If you realize, however, that the book is much to long to include everything in a reasonable movie and just try to look at them as two different stories altogether, then you will probably enjoy it.  There was a new director for this movie, and he felt things like Hogwarts grounds needed to be changed.  It's a completely different feel than the first two movies, which I found to be quite irksome.  Other than that though I really enjoyed it, and I don't regret my purchase at all.
1881273156|5.0|I feel Mr. Chapman was truly inspired. I have tested his theory and found it to work like a charm. The real trick is finding where the person you love fits in the five languages. A must read by any person who truly wants to touch another with the language of sincere love. Because this theory is easier said than done I have read this book four times over the past two years. I now have it on audio so I can easily refresh my ambition to show love to those I care about.
B0000029GA|5.0|Everyones favorite, for a good reason. Nas' storytellin. If this were only an Acapella I would still cop it! Production is real raw, and the lyrics are the \\"razor blade under the tongue\\" style. A+
B000654Z2I|5.0|I discovered Can just over a year ago. Tago Mago was the first album I purcahsed and it blew me away..literally. This album along with their other works, completely changed my perception about music. Jaki is quite possibly one of the best drummers of all time. His 'hammerhead' drumming in Halleluhwah is something out of this world. Even though this is Suzuki's first effort with the band(Mooney left and went back to America after having a breakdown during one their shows), they seem like a very tight unit. His weird vocal exercises complement the band's cosmic explorations. If you enjoy bands with courage to experiment and push the boundaries of music ( successfully), then this CD along with Ege Bamyasi, Monster Movie, Future Days and the rest of their works should definitely be in your collection.
B0000024K1|5.0|Highly influential in a lyrical standpoint. Very moving in a musical spot. Chuck D's voice commands your attention every time he raps. One that every fan of music should own!!! A MUST!!! A++
B0009W5JS2|1.0|I would have given this movie at least -5 stars if the scale was available. After paying the typical rental fee from my local video store, I feel the money would have been better spent renting something else. After reading that Vin Diesel and the original director left after seeing the script, my respect for them both went up tremendously. Everyone has principals and after seeing this Left Wing Hit piece I can almost forgive Vin Diesel for his role in the Pacifier. <br /> <br />    The movie started out with some serious promise, but QUICKLY goes down hill. From the Al Gore Clone as President to the Left Wing Stick Man of a disgruntled General of Southern descent who attempts a Coup De'Tat because his budget is being cut, bases closed, and troop levels lowered. All in the name of feeding the poor, leveling the Social playing field, making nice with our enemies, trying to reach out to those who would see us dead. The movie has RACIST overtones scattered through out it's entirety. From the typical portrayal of the Sergeant backing the Bad General who carries a lighter with BAMA on it. This Movie is just the Fantasy wishes of the Left Wing Girlie Boys who know nothing of Honor, Duty or Country.  <br /> <br />     I totally recommend that you avoid this movie, unless you are the typical disgruntled Democrat voter from the 04 Presidential election cycle and need a trip to EXTREME FANTASY to lift your FAILED Ideological spirits. This movie is a waste of good film.
B000002WPI|5.0|One of the BEST Hip hop LP's ever recorded! Never will you hear a group of artists make such an impact ever again. This is comparible to \\"ILLMATIC\\", \\"WORD...Life\\", & \\"READY TO DIE\\". Rugged lyrics, neck braking beats, & all around great material. Do yourself a HUGE favor and buy it now!
B000022TSH|5.0|After \\"The Godfather\\", I'd have to rank \\"Chinatown\\" as the second best film of the 1970's.  This is a masterpiece of acting(Nicholson and Dunaway brought their \\"A\\" game); writing(Robert Towne makes one forget how bad his \\"Shampoo\\" was); and, Polanski never made a better picture in his life.   <br /> <br />If you see no other film from the 70's, make sure you see \\"Chinatown\\".  You won't be disappointed.
B000059T1E|5.0|When people mention Traffic they always talk about the low spark record. This record is actually better! On this one they shed the trendy 60 hippy sound of their previous 2 lps. While the first two Traffic lps are great, here they get back to thier roots. The record is a mix of Jazz, Folk, and r&b, Which is what Winwood does best. I have been listening to this record for 20 years and it still sounds fresh to me. This reissue adds 2 more good songs from the sessions. This is a band that changed alot. They did not really  sound the same for very long. I only wish they make more records this good!
B0007QJ1MK|5.0|Even with former bassist and all-around lunatic Nick Olivieri banished to rock'n'roll Siberia, Queens of the Stone Age remain a band with a habit of overindulging to excess (musically, at least).   <br /> <br />Regardless, with Lullabies to Paralyze, Queens of the Stone Age cement their status as the best hard rock band of their time, occupying a throne formerly held by Led Zeppelin (70's), Metallica (80's), and Alice in Chains (early 90's).  The first eight songs here lay waste to any hard rock or heavy metal music of the past decade.  On tracks like \\"Little Sister\\" and \\"Everybody Knows That You're Insane\\", you can practically hear Josh Homme bludgeoning smaller, more pathetic artists to death with his guitar.  Perhaps \\"Burn the Witch\\" refers to Hilary Duff.  That's at least how I like to picture it. <br /> <br />The second half of \\"Lullabies\\" drops in quality a bit.  \\"Someone's in the Wolf\\" and \\"Skin on Skin\\" both drone on long past their welcome.  And \\"You've Got a Killer Scene There, Man\\" goes nowhere.  But that hardly softens the impact of tunes like \\"I Never Came,\\" which is perhaps the best rock song of the new millenium, if not the ballsiest. <br /> <br />After all, in this century, hip hop has taken over as the primary outlet for unabashed manliness.  Rock has been relegated mainly to the sniveling wimps who are still pining for their 8th grade girlfriends.  Queens of the Stone Age have no patience for that.  They will rock your face off, steal your girlfriend, and then nail your mom for good measure.  And we need more bands to be like that.  In fact, we need ALL bands to be like that.  Until then, there won't be a better album this year, or in near future.
B000063DI8|4.0|This album is a very solid record. <br />Its just....a continuing change in their career. <br />If anyone listens to all of the albums straight in order (excluding  live albums and greatest hits) you finish up Powerslave (one of their heaviest albums) and you hit Somehwere In Time...you sit there and look at your cd player and say \\"what the heck?? this sucks!\\" But if you listen to it any other time you realize how awesome and incredible it is. <br />This album, like a lot of Maiden albums, just flows very differently from ones that came before, and after. <br />Its a very wonderful album, just give it a chance. <br /> <br />Oh...and...on the enhanced version of the album, the cover art is changed, yes, but I think the actual disc's art is the original album cover. (with the fat man with the lantern being strangled)
B00005BJ2O|4.0|This cd is one of the most fun to listen to I've ever had!  I've had people stop and ask what I'm listening to and they've acutally recognized it as being the Moulin Rouge soundtrack.  I especially loved the elephant love medley becuase it makes me laugh every time.  The opening and closing are great even if they aren't like they were in the movie.  The sad diamonds song is beautiful and I can't hear it enough.  As for Come What May and Your Song, they're very sweet and well-sung.  This cd is, like my title says, so much fun and I definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys an occasional romantic song or some upbeat disco style pieces.
B0001MDP3G|1.0|This is one of the most boring films I've seen in a while! It's very stupid too. I can't believe it was nominated for an academy award. I mean really, COME ON!
B0009ML238|5.0|Just to tell some of you just how good this CD is, here is the scoop. I heard a song by them on an internet radio station from Munich Germany 2 weeks ago, got on-line and found a place to download the whole CD for $1.00, listened to it over & over, then realized just how much I loved it, then I went back on-line and acutally purchased the CD because I felt the band deserves my money, not $1.00.  That is how good this CD is.
B00007ELEL|5.0|Definitely in my top 5 comedies along with; \\"Spinal Tap\\", \\"Vacation\\",\\"Caddyshack\\", and \\"Young Frankenstien\\". I am a big Coen brothers fan though there are movies of theirs I don't like; \\"Barton Fink\\", \\"Oh Brother Where Art Thou\\". I think this is their best film. It is visually stunning at moments, brilliantly directed, and absolutly funny in a smart way. Jeff Bridges and John Goodman give some of the best performances of their careers playing two of the most memorable characters I've seen on film. Their chemistry is very natural, like that of two brothers. The writing is spectacular! There's really nothing bad or wrong about this film. I own it, I've seen it many times, and it never gets old. Even if you're not a Coen brothers fan, see this movie. Unless you have a problem with the F word. I believe this movie broke the record for the amount of times it was said.
B0002VKZL6|5.0|I must admit that it sounded different when I frist listened to it. Recording technique seemed a little different, Mark Knopfler is a little forward. But, he is great, just perfect for this type of recording. Couldn't be any better. You listen to it and you put the CD aside, but after a while you want to listen to it again. You miss the tunes and the notes left in your ear is not as good as listening to it again. If you are a Mark Knopfler fan, if you like \\"Golden Heart\\", if you listen to \\"Sailing to Philadelphia\\" then, it is highly possible that you are going to like this too.  The first two tracks are so good that you listen over and over again. In the following tracks, I think, the lyrics get a little important but still very relaxing and enjoying.
B000002J09|5.0|BEST ALBUM EVER BY 10 LIGHT YEARS! NUFF SAID!!! LED ZEP U R GR8
B0000A02TZ|5.0|This movie is everything I hate about modern comedies. It is stupid and relies entirely on the more primitive aspects of our sense of humor. But it works. <br /> <br />There is one reason that the modern comedies that follow in its footsteps always fail. They lack the invention that John Landis showed in his debut film. When the comedy appeared here, it was new, something entirely original. The shock of these outlandish images inspires laughter, and rightly so. <br /> <br />\\"It was new then, so what? I've seen these jokes a thousand times before in its ripoffs. It's not new anymore, the novelty is lost.\\" <br /> <br />Wrong! This film seems as fresh today as it ever did before. Landis makes films with the energy no one else can provide(fine, early Mel Brooks too). The actors provide grace to their performances. The characters know they're being childish, but they just love it so much. Belushi's Bluto isn't even a character. He's an event! <br /> <br />Moreover the film has an underlying intelligent charm about itself. The motto of Faber College, \\"Knowledge is good!\\" is a paraphrase of every single motto of every single school in the country. The Deltas are mischievous and cruel, but so are the ones punishing them. One thing that seperates the Deltas from their oppressors: the Deltas are honest about their transgressions by being out in the open about it, the Dean and the Omegas are hypocrits. The film achieves brilliancewhen it exposes the hypocrisy. \\"If you mention extortion again, I'll have your legs broken.\\" <br /> <br />It's a stupid movie with balls enough to reach for greatness. Donald Sutherland's allusion to Milton's Paradise Lost is a perfect example of how the film justifies its blatant hedonism. The Deltas rule in Hell while the Omega's serve in Heaven. <br /> <br />The movie is smart, not only in its over the top stupidity and clever satire (I'm quite aware that's paradoxical). It also knows just how to generate a laugh, which is more than I can say for most comedies. When Boone enters his girlfriend's house and hears movement in the back, it's understood that she's been cheating on him. He storms out. In any lesser film Neidermeyer or another Omega would've turned out the transgressor, giving the film greater meaning. Donald Sutherland was the last person we expected to see emerge from the bedroom. That's what slapstick is all about: surprizes. <br /> <br />Modern slapstick seems to heed the orders of the Dean, \\"No more fun of any kind!\\" The protagonists are too typical. The villains, to villainous. The cattle, raped. Animal House is over the top brilliance that works, but it also set the convention that ruined its followers. But as Satan always said, \\"Better to rule in Hell [college spoof films], than serve in Heaven [respectable drama].\\"
B00005JNEI|1.0|What goal? To get Bush voted out of office of course. After only about 15 minutes of the constant little conspiracies thrown in one after the other I started laughing and then began to wonder why this film was considered so provocative by so many people. All Moore did was show Bush doing something like playing golf, while making small remarks like, \\"Isn't it about time you got to work George?\\" Apparently GWB spent his first 8 months on the golf course?? Yes it is that silly. He remarked that it looked like GWB was going to be a lame duck president, lame duck after only after 8 months, are we kidding? Especially, after the huge division Gore created when he demanded a re-count after he lost the election. A re-count in only a select few democrat counties. I guess what they really meant was \\"Let every democrat vote count and count and count and count!\\" One more thing, which is worse a president that spends his time playing golf, or one who spends his time getting BJ's in the oval office, no wonder we had the first world trade center bombings, Oklahoma city bombing, Waco, Ruby Ridge, the pull out in Somalia, the massacre in Rwanda, the attack on the Cole, the US embassy attacks in Africa, held to the same standards, Clinton looks pretty pathetic.     I also thought it was really funny that Moore actually believes the entire world was somehow influenced by FOX NEWS when announcing GWB president. Fox was not even considered much competition back in 2000, so why would any news network base their coverage on what Fox had reported? Especially since they are considered a really conservative slanted station, right? Does this make any sense? I guess everyone at CNN and MSNBC sit around and watch FOX news to determine what facts to report. If this were true they all should be removed from the air.     Moore would also show columns from a newspaper written by some liberal and then stress that they are indeed fact. Almost all the people I saw interviewed had a book bashing Bush orwas some other flaming liberal fanatic.     What was the point of showing Bush and others in the administration getting ready for the camera with make-up artists, etc., etc. Are we to believe the every single democrat went on air after 9-11 looking like they did when they woke up in the morning. He also tried to insinuate that the footage was on sept. 11 right after the attacks. He did this by showing the date sept. 10 then immediately after showing the edited for liberals Sept. 11 footage (to liberals 9-11 was apparently just a few papers flying in the air, dust and some really upset people.) the film jumps right to members of the Bush administration getting ready for the camera, while the credits roll. How could they be so vain after what just happened?    His constant attempt to make Bush look like an evil money grubbing, Saudi loving, oil corrupted, moron backfired and I found myself impressed by Bush even more than I already had been. This movie was just too much hype and it became a broken record really, really fast. Moore claims he loves this country, if he expressed this type of love to his wife would they still be married? Can you imagine if he made a movie about his wife by constantly bashing her and telling her how terrible she is and how messed up she is, and then giving no solution to the apparent problem? What Moore should of done instead was just filmed himself in front of the white house holding a sign that read \\"I hate George W. Bush and America so much I can't stand it!\\" He then could of simply went to the airport bought a plane ticket and left for France never to return.

B0008ISM40|2.0|This album is a full six-pack, but it just doesn't have that plastic thingy that holds it all together. Nine Inch Nails A.K.A. Trent Reznor's sound has always had a very experimental feel to it. He is one of a very few people that can consistently take a collection of unrelated, ambiguous sounds and arrange them together in a way that not only makes sense, but speak to a wide range of people. It is what has made him very imitated, but ultimately, uncopyable (for lack of a better word). But with this album he sounds more like the copy than an original. The vocals of most of the songs are disjointed from the music. Listening to the lyrics I am constantly reminded of Vegas lounge music. The drums and guitars riffs are excellent, the timing of samples well thought, but still needing something to link them together. Perhaps more overlying melody, maybe a bit more background noise? I don't know (if I was that good I would be writing music instead of reviewing it). I will say one thing, the album sounds much better in 5.1 than stereo. NIN has always centered around its stage presence (if you have never seen them play live you are missing out). Maybe I'll appreciate this album more once I see them on tour, but right now, I am underwhelmed.
6305181772|5.0|...and I've seen a lot of them.<br /><br />What is so great about this film - beyond the acting - is how complex and multi-layered the story is.  You have to see it multiple times to get everything, such as Cruise's realization while looking in the Gideon Bible from Palmer House in Chicago, and you (or at least I) never get tired of seeing it again.  This is because the story is so dense with detail and so perfectly executed.  Thru it all, Cruise pulls it off as a totally believable actor, on a par with Sean Connery in the early Bond films.  (For anyone with a taste for the authentic, their enjoyment of Bond simply could not tolerate the corniness of Roger Moore - that is the level of Cruise's performance in this one.)<br /><br />Warmly recommended for connoissuer's of the action genre.  You can hardly do better than this one, with the exceoption of the early Bond or Matt Damon in Bourne.
B0000CDJPQ|1.0|Nothing that uses FW400 responds to being plugged into this device, whether is it bus powered or not. <br /> <br />Bloody useless
B00023B1LC|5.0|This has got to be one of the best action films I have ever seen.  Not only does Matt Damon with his superb acting make you believe in the reality of what happens onscreen, but the story is complex and darkly fun.<br /><br />I think what distinguishes this series is how realistic Damon makes it seem.  THere are no techie fixes or superhuman feats, just disciplined improvisation by the ultimate assasin.  Then there is his personal crisis, worked out in amnesia and his desire to start a new life, perhaps with a woman that he is endangering.  Finally, there are the shenanigans of the CIA, with its covert program gone awry and the brutal power maneuvers of the flacks trying to save the situation and their careers.  Very fun and interesting, with a nice space for the viewer's imagination to take hold.<br /><br />Recommended with enthusiasm.
B000AARKOO|5.0|For those of you unsure wether Orlando bloom manages to look like he's a good actor. Lay all doubts aside. The man is magnificent!<br /><br />Yeah, we never got to see the true acting possibilites, Bloom always playing second rate roles, never a primary actor. But he really can hold scenes well by the strength of his acting. And this movie proves it.<br /><br />Kingdom of heaven is a wonderfully done movie by Ridley Scott (Gladiator) the history is pretty much accurate, and jerusalim is breathtaking...and huge. Some of the fighting scenes look like they could have been a cut off from LOTR, but then so did Troy. Not to say they wheren't awesome, but the part where Orlando leads his small band of horsemen into Saladin's army is a definate throwback to the scene in Return of the King, where Viggio leads his party into the circuling orcs at the gate into mordor...but I regress.<br /><br />Bloom comes back looking like he did in the Pirates of the Caribbean, a little more mature and handsome, but long hair and scruffy look just the same. Alan Rickman (Hitchiker,Dragonheart)is here also, as the crusader bent on following god and the king. His scenes aren't long, but what he does have shines.<br /><br />However, don't go looking to watch this movie as being light entertanment. For those who have watched Gladiator this is pretty much the same. Lots of head slashing, blood and neck cutting. Doesn't get much realistic then this. Besides, its enough just keeping up with the history portrayed in this movie to keep you focused. Otherwise you'll miss alot.<br /><br />Truly enjoyable, a real feast for the history buff and those that love good movies

1400032717|5.0|Mark Haddon's achievement in THE CURIOUS INCIDENT OF THE DOG IN THE NIGHT-TIME is the embodiment of what we learned back in school, that a novel's mission should be to entertain and to instruct.  In this enthralling novel, told from first-person point of view of a 15-year-old autistic boy from a working-class neighborhood in England, Haddon lays out the world of that disorder, from how the mind works to its effect on the community.   <br /> <br />CURIOUS INCIDENT begins as a detective novel.  The very logical, mathematically gifted and unironic mind of Christopher Boone wants to find out who killed his neighbor's poodle with a pitch fork.  Christopher has a code of rules by which he lives and he holds others, his way of dealing with the outside world from which he is otherwise disassociated.  Employing the methodology of his hero, Sherlock Holmes, he carefully negotiates his fragile rules of communication and begins canvassing the neighborhood.  His father, a hard-working single parent, wants him to stop.  Christopher can't withhold his curiosity.  Before long, his adventure moves from detecting into a suspenseful coming of age story. <br /> <br />In a book featuring a first-person narrative of an autistic person who is unable to understand the emotions and behavior of the people around him, Haddon spectacularly conveys the father's love and heartbreak, and the outside world's response to Christopher.  The book is by turns comic and touching.  I highly recommend it for the beauty of the narrative, the original way in which it is articulated on the page and a greater understanding of autism.

B00005JKHN|5.0|In 1987, as a wide-eyed 6-year-old, I saw SLEEPING BEAUTY during it's cinema re-release.  It was probably the first time I ever went to the movies.  The experience definitely stayed with me and fired my love of Disney movies which had begun when I was a toddler with ALICE IN WONDERLAND and MARY POPPINS on video.  Now so many years later I have relished collecting and revisiting all the Disney classics on DVD, and the 2-disc edition of SLEEPING BEAUTY is something really special.  Six years in the making, the movie made history for being the first animated feature shot in 70mm and was the 2nd highest-grossing film of the 1960s' (second only to BEN-HUR).<br /><br />The story is well-known: Beautiful Princess Aurora is cursed as a baby by the cruel Maleficent.  On her 16th birthday she'll die from pricking her finger on a spindle.  Good fairy Merryweather remedies the curse by changing death to sleep, and the awakening of Aurora by the kiss of true love.  However, to ensure that Aurora does not meet this fate at all, the fairies Flora, Fauna and Merryweather take the infant deep into the forest, where they pose as three spinsters and rename the child Briar Rose.  On her 16th birthday the girl will be quietly smuggled back to the palace with Maleficent none-the-wiser.  However things take an unexpected turn when Briar Rose falls in love with a handsome Prince, and the princess is ultimately discovered despite the best efforts of the fairies'.<br /><br />The production design by Eyvind Earl takes it's cue from medieval tapestries and paintings.  The score, freely-adapted from Tchaikovsky's ballet, is lush with \\"Once Upon a Dream\\" and \\"I Wonder\\" the main standouts.  Mary Costa, later one of the leading opera singers of the 60s' and 70s', performs the role of Aurora/Briar Rose and does a fantastic job.  The character of Prince Phillip (voiced by Bill Shirley) is the first prince in a Disney fairytale that takes an active role in the story.  The prince-roles in SNOW WHITE and CINDERELLA are quite static and uninteresting.  Eleanor Audley (who also memorably voiced CINDERELLA's icy stepmother Lady Tremaine) works her magic again with Maleficent, still one of Disney's strongest villains.  Verna Felton, Vera Vague and Barbara Luddy play Flora, Fauna and Merryweather.  Disney fans will remember Felton from CINDERELLA (the Fairy Godmother), ALICE IN WONDERLAND (the Queen of Hearts) and LADY AND THE TRAMP (Aunt Sarah).  Barbara Luddy's voice you'll also remember as that of Lady in LADY AND THE TRAMP.<br /><br />Disney has done a terrific job in restoring SLEEPING BEAUTY for this 2-disc Special Edition.  The film is presented in its  Technirama 70mm proportions with 5.1 sound mix (as well as an optional DTS mix).  The colours are strong and vibrant with the use of High Definition Video employed to clean up every frame of animation.  Some great extras are included, featuring a 'Making Of' segment with Mary Costa and Eyvind Earl both extensively interviewed.  There's also a recreation of the original Disneyland 'Sleeping Beauty Walk-Through attraction' which features early concept art by Earl.  The lovely Disney cinema featurette THE PETER TCHAIKOVSKY STORY is also included along with a cute set-top adventure game 'Rescue Aurora', plus lots more.e quite static and uninteresting.

B000000WCA|1.0|Look, it's like this: if you want to spend $1.29 on a Spice Girls CD, I'm not going to stop you. There are other and better things that I can buy for $1.29 instead of a Spice Girls CD, like 2 bags of potato chips and a Twinkie. When the Spice Girls first came out,  I had just started getting into Erykah Badu and Old School R&B.  I liked the Spice Girls, but I knew better than to go out and buy their CD. I KNEW better.  They were pretty girls who couldn't sing or dance and who weren't going to be around for long anyway, so I didn't care about their stupid squables. All $tyle and no substance. For the life of me, I couldn't understand why Mel B. was named \\"Scary Spice.\\" It was said she was given the name because she had a pierced tongue, but I doubt it. The only Black girl in the group-who was the best looking one and could sing a little- is called \\"Scary Spice.\\" Go figure.  Anyway, \\"Spice\\" is pretty weak and I only enjoy \\"Wannabe\\" and \\"Say You'll Be There.\\" It was atrocious how they sampled from Bootsy Collins for their wack song \\"If You Can't Dance.\\" Well, that's all I have to say about that. PEACE!
B00007E8O5|5.0|Wonderful compilation, worth every cent.  Glad I didn't waste money on the 1-disc set, because the extra songs are wonderful.  This CD set tells a painful, soulful, and beautiful story that can only be written by someone who's lived it.  The songwriting is the best stuff JC has ever written, even including the AIC stuff.  Although I believe it was written before Layne Staley's death, there is so much on the discs that seems to be a premonition of that event. <br /> <br />There's something for everyone, from hard rocking \\"Bargain Basement, Howard Hughes\\" to soulfully slow \\"Solitude\\" to even a couple country/western songs \\"Gone\\" and \\"31/32\\".  If you liked AIC, especially for their veracity and variety, you will LOVE this 2-disc set.  I know I do. <br /> <br />How he'll top this, though, I can only wonder.
B00000255F|5.0|An excellent album by Bruce, one of the best in rock history. My favorites are Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out, Jungleland (pure epic there), Thunder Road, Born to Run and Backstreets. Everything else is good, but nothing matches the quality of those five. If you want a true epic, listen to the 9:33 mini-suite Jungleland. Great song, one of the best ever written. Another lengthy semi-epic is the underrated Backstreets. It takes a bit of getting used to (especially the ending), but is truly amazing. Thunder Road is one of the best ballads out there, Tenth Avenue Freeze- Out is a fast-paced sax-driven song, and Born to Run is just an explosion of sound and emotion.<br />And one last comment to the \\"Bruce is a terrorist\\" person, please try to keep your reviews about the music. If he's not playing politically-oriented music, why comment on Bruce's and your political difference? It's diversity that makes America work, and you are very much setting yourself up in the image of the terrorists you so fear and hate by being so intolerant of another's varying political point of view. And you have the nerve to post it multiple times...I'll be reporting you to Amazon.com now.
B0002OERI0|5.0|That was my reaction after I heard this CD for the first time.  Yes, it does deserve its &#34;Parental Advisory&#34;, but don't let that stop you from buying this.  This is a wonderful rock opera that you MUST listen to all the way through - don't base your like or dislike of this album just by the singles.  Borrow this album - either from a friend or from the library - and listen with open ears and mind.  Even if you're not a fan of Green Day or not a big fan (like I am), you'll either like them or like them even more, as I did.  Someday this album will be on lists of the best albums ever made.  On the two nine minute long songs, the transitions between the five mini songs are amazing. You'll have to listen to hear what I mean - it's difficult to describe.  Favorite songs:  &#34;Boulevard of Broken Dreams&#34; - Yes , it's overplayed on the radio but with good reason - it's awesome!  This is my favorite song, I have it on repeat a lot!  &#34;Are We the Waiting&#34; - Other reviewers say that the chorus for this song is repetitive, but I say it's so catchy, you'll want to sing along!  &#34;Wake Me Up when September Ends&#34; - A beautiful ballad, this is the latest single.  &#34;Whatsername&#34;  - A great closing song which has the best and last lyric on the whole CD, &#34;Forgetting you, but not the time&#34;.  Edited to add:  I just recently listened to this and it's still timeless.  It's hard to believe that it was released 12 1/2 years ago.
B00004XONN|5.0|Ahhhh, effortless techno.  There's nothing quite like it.  <br /> <br />Drawing influences from Apex Twin, Bjork, and other masters of the dreamy ethereal techno album, Radiohead has created their own little weird hybrid masterpiece.  With drowned-out vocals, interesting time signatures and a soothing melodies, \\"Kid A\\" is the perfect headphone companion for the insomniac in all of us.  <br /> <br />Perhaps Thom Yorke just needs a hug?  Some of the more depressing moments of the album, such as the title track and the album flagship \\"How to Disappear Completely\\" point to an answer of \\"yes.\\"  Not only does Radiohead's lead singer need a hug, but the rest of the band as well.  These are not happy/uplifting dance tracks; these are desolate musical statements meant to depress the soul.  And I wouldn't want \\"Kid A\\" any other way.  <br /> <br />Perhaps \\"Kid A's\\" melancholy is meant to be the antithesis of the band's early efforts, \\"The Bends\\" with its emotional texture and \\"OK Computer\\" with its nearly-nonsensical energetic guitar-meets-android music.  Or, perhaps \\"Kid A\\" is merely the next step in the band's evolution; \\"OK Computer\\" was pretty heavy on the electronic without ever being blatantly techno.  Luckily, I am reviewing \\"Kid A\\" in hindsight; eventually Radiohead returned to their previous sound with 2004's \\"Hail to the Theif.\\"  <br /> <br />But \\"Kid A\\" is more than a side project.  It's the band's techno masterpiece, and perhaps their most solid and engaging triumph.  <br /> <br />That's not to say there aren't any missteps; things get perhaps a bit too depressing on \\"Treefingers,\\" a vocal-free instrumental with little range or emotion.  The heavy-guitar based \\"National Anthem\\" is another sore spot, but mostly because of its placement on the album (though I can't really think of a spot where it wouldn't be out of place).  <br /> <br />The greatest moments are when the concept and the production come together in focused, immediate bursts; such is the track \\"Idioteque,\\" and thump-thump-thumping little dance number located on the disk's later half that spices things up while staying true to the album's main aesthetics.  The title track and \\"Optimistic\\" are also focused, beautiful pieces of music.  <br />This album is ultimately listenable through-and-through, and best of all, it's relistenable too!  This will be one of those albums that you end up putting on at the end of a long night - because you know that it's the best album that you have.  <br /> <br />Recommended CDs if you liked this album: Bjork's \\"Homogenic,\\" anything from the Apex Twin catalogue, or Future Sound of London's \\"Dead Cities.\\"
B00003CX8Y|5.0|Beauty and the Beast is the story of Belle, a girl living in a small French village who dreams of adventure. She is considered strange in her town because she is always reading, and sees the handsomest man in town, Gaston, not as a dreamy potential fiance, but as the rude, conceited man he really is. Belle's father stumbles upon the enchanted castle of the Beast, which will remain under a spell until the Beast, formerly a handsome prince, learns to love, which must happen by his twenty-first birthday. Belle comes to rescue her father, and agrees to take his place as the Beast's prisoner. Although the Beast seems harsh and bad-tempered at first, Belle and the Beast learn to love each other, to the displeasure of Gaston, who finds out about Belle's friendship with the Beast, and had planned on marrying Belle himself. <br />This is an amazing movie, definitely my favorite of all of the Disney movies, and it could be my all-time favorite movie, too. The characters are so lively and full of personality. The Beast's servants, who have been turned into objects under the spell, add a lot to the movie. The musical numbers are fantastic - the humorous \\"Gaston,\\" the flashy \\"Be Our Guest,\\" and, of course, the breathtakingly beautiful ballroom scene, where Belle and the Beast dance to \\"Beauty and the Beast.\\" This is a great movie for people of any age, and a must-see for people who have enjoyed other Disney movies.
0060751967|4.0|Though he has been a vampire for several centuries, Roman Draganesti, CEO chemist of Romatech Industries, hates being God's abomination in spite of doing great things for humanity and his species like inventing synthetic blood and blood cuisines.  However, his success has made it a safer world for vampires, but a splinter group the Malcontents believe that biting humans is the only way to dine for a superior species.  Roman tests a new device, but his fang falls out.  He must get it replanted tonight or his vampiric healing prowess will close the gap permanently.<br /><br />Dentist Shanna Whelan works night at a clinic though she fears blood since someone killed her friend in front of her.  Roman arrives holding a wolf's tooth, but she refuses to place an animal's fang in his mouth.  However, he rescues her from Russians and vampire Ivan Petrovsky, who want her dead since her testimony incarcerated one of them. Instead of gratitude she knees him in his testicles, which hurts severely.  Still he takes her with him; soon they fall in love, but relationships between vampires and mortals have lifespan issues although Ivan plans to bite both of them out of existence.<br /><br />Mindful of MaryJanice Davidson's works, the key to this satirical supernatural romance is that the species vampire comes across as genuine within a modern age context.  The lead couple is a likable star-crossed duo while the strong support cast augments the belief that vampires live.  Though the climax seems rushed and the large vampire population contains many lacking discipline making it impossible to accept that most humans remain unaware they exist, sub-genre readers will enjoy this biting tale and look forward to an upcoming sequel.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner
B00005JNBQ|5.0|Watching ND is like watching eggs fry on a hot Idaho pavement in mid-summer:It's not something you see every day but when you see it actually happening it's hard to take your eyes off it and you find it somehow amazing. This is exactly how I felt watching this quarky masterpiece. Don't look for a plot or deeper meanings in ND. This film is about its characters, dialog and production/set design.    I think reviewers are wrong to think of Napoleon as a typical nerd; his nerdness is to such an extreme that it kind of comes full circle and puts him in the cool part of the meter (i.e. something so cold it feels hot). Witness the Jamiroquai dance scene at the end of the film: the students finally see the \\"cool kid\\" in Napoleon that was just waiting for an opportunity to show he was a guy with skills (personally, I think his dance moves are much better than anything anyone could ever do with nunchucks or a bow staff!)    Pedro is admittedly walking through life on half a pulse, but the friendship between him and ND reveals there is much more to his lifeless exterior. And Uncle Rico and the assorted other characters are just brilliant paint on this colorful canvass of life, love and tater tots.
B0000296SI|5.0|I remember hearing this music while watching an indoor track meet back in 2000. I heard \\"Wendy Clear\\" and thought it was good. In the outdoor track season I had bought the CD and learned to like \\"Adam's Song\\" and \\"All the Small Things.\\" The first time I ever DJed, although I'm not a DJ was at a dinner/dance that spring and I played 4 Blink 182 songs from this album and dedicated each one to someone who was present and who helped to get me into this album. Wonderful alternative rock album, and great without explitives.
B00005A8GY|5.0|It is too bad if you expect 5.1 or 7.1 surround from this SACD.  The remastering engineer is too honest to reprocess this to 5.1 or multichannel that during the time or recording was not available.    SACD Stereo is meant for stereophiles or audiophiles with equipment carefully chosen to bring out the best in recorded stereo music for two channels only...and never for 5.1 channels unless you have a DSP which will remove the essence of the recording anyway.  And I have to emphasize the quality of the playback system since SACD has higher frequency data not possible to be included in the CD. If your system can only playback the audible frequencies then you are missing a lot of information particularly imaging (depth and width) and ambiance.    In short, the SACD version blows away the CD version only if you have the right equipment.  I could hear the increased in depth of the soundstage and clarity of the instruments...My comparison is based on a remastered CD played on a very good CD player, versus this SACD played on a midrange SACD/DVD-A player.  The CD player costs 3 times as much as the SACD player but still the SACD wins hands down.    So before you write reviews for or against this SACD make sure that you have listened to it using the right equipment...

B00004Y6NW|4.0|I love this song, Down to the Waterline, and it is one of my<br /><br />favorite DS songs!! I play it 3 times in a row! Others great would be Six Blade Knife, the single, Sultans of Swing, and Lions.
B0000696ID|5.0|I watched E.T. when i was a kid, many many times. I hadn';t seen it in YEARS, and it was on tbs i think it was, the other day and i watched it and totally forgot what a tearjerker it is. I found myself crying at the parts when ET was sick and abducted by those idiot goverment agents a**holes, that made me so mad. Maybe thats why we havent seen any aliens because maybe they saw ET and thought to hell with it lol, but anyway. I don't agree with the others who say this movie is good but not as fanastic as it's been hyped up to be. It's a woderful movie very touching with fanastic acting from such young children. And ET the alien is so adorable and funy at times, and his senisitvy and good heart and his ability to love makes you more angry when those agents with guns dont care about anything but fame, and to be the first to study an alien. It's just like that movie splash when the mermaid is thrown into a tank after being kidnapped and humiliated. Our species can be so cruel and diabolical. No wonder many species are becoming extinct it's our careless polluted world who think we're so superior and above everything else. Whatever happened to respecting living things? ET is an example of how ignorant people are, but the end definately makes up for the fact that we had to watch the bad parts when ET was in the hands of the government agents who illegally found out by the way that the alein was there by illegally listening with a scanner and invading privacy of the people. And what was up with the cops and every agent chasing the kids with guns? Geez i'm surprised they didnt shoot the kids on their bikes or run them over and kill everyone just to selfishness and cruelly get their hands on poor ET to continue the sadistic study and probably were gonna tortue him and study his anatomy by giving him an atopsy while he was alive. Anyway, dont even get me started on animal testing too. But it is a movie, but probably these government people would act the same way in real life ifan alien came to earth. But besides all the chaos ET is a moving story, and there were alot of funny parts including the frog scene and when ET drank beer lol.
B00004Y6NU|5.0|I love this CD! This CD is my favorite! I like every of these songs and they're all great! This is one of the greatest CDs ever made!!<br /><br />1. TELEGRAPH ROAD 10/10 Great work!<br /><br />2. PRIVATE INVESTIGATIONS 10/10 One of my favorites!<br /><br />3. INDUSTRIAL DISEASE 10/10 A song you can play overnover again.<br /><br />4. LOVE OVER GOLD 10/10 Great guitar!<br /><br />5. IT NEVER RAINS 10/10 Absolutely the best song on the album!
B00005Y1UX|5.0|It's a cliche but also true. It's just like two best friends saying \\"we can sleep together and still be best friends and not ruin the friendship\\" It's naive. And this movie is more complicated than that, and it's about a wealthy businessman (Robert Redford) who makes an INDECENT PROPOSAL to a young poor couple (Woody Harrelson and Demi Moore) and it's an offer of one million dollars for one night with David's (Harrelson) wife (Moore) It's amazing what rich people do with their money, and even more so it's amazing what poor people will do for money. In this case, the couple believes they have it all figured out, no feelings, no mind no heart just her body, just sex, for the money they need for their future that could last a lifetime. And the saddest part is when David actually wakes up, and realized he made a terrible mistake and runs all over the hotel looking for her, and then off she goes in a helicopter with Mr. Wonderful. Right then and there you know what's going to happen later on. Bitter feelings, jealousy, guilt, and hating her for doing it when it's himself who he hates more for actually letting her do it. No man should ever sell his wife, for one night, for one minute it just isn't right even for all the money in the world if you love her, never let someone try to steal her for cash. It's sleezy no matter how you look at it. Demi Moore is absolutely gorgeous in this film. And there was excellent acting by her and woody, and this is a very romantic movie. A little sad here and there but a nice message about what money can do. They say money has power over people, it's evil, and greed will always get you the short end of the stick no matter what. And even doing the wrong thing for the right reason doesnt mean it will turn out ok.
B00004Y6NV|5.0|This is probably my 5th or 6th Dire Straits album! I compare two<br /><br />songs to see which one is better, Sweet Child O' Mine by Guns N'<br /><br />Roses, or Heavy Fuel by Dire Straits. Heavy Fuel is definately the best song on the CD, great guitars and vocals and a track you can repeat. I like The Bug also because it is got some fast drums, and great guitars and vocals. Also, check out Calling Elvis the opener. Calling Elvis is a really cool song! Then My<br /><br />Parties will make you laugh because the lyrics are made great and the whole song is just rocks!! Then you got Planet of New Orleans which with the greatest rock ending epic. On Every Street is a must have for every rock fan!! Guarantee it!!
B00005JNBQ|5.0|One innovation of the comedy genre was \\"slapstick,\\" such as the movie \\"Spaceballs.\\" I believe this is a step in a new direction: \\"Mannerism comedy.\\" There are no punch lines. No laughtrack. No yelling and flailing of the arms while flying through the air. No... I believe this movie will be universally funny to the general crowd, but to those more intuitive and those who can relate to the experiences of Napoleon Dynamite, you WILL laugh until your gut hurts. I already knew what kind of comedy this was before I saw it, just by seeing the previews. My brother saw it before me, and as I bought the DVD he said, \\"Now, you won't REALLY be laughing ALL throughout.\\" Wrong! This sort of independant film makes seeing a PORTRAYAL of a mannerism we all know about fun and funny to watch, and especially so if it is done accurately. As well, knowing that Jon Heder is just a normal guy in real life makes his portrayal of a geek hysterically funny. Right from the start, it shows him waiting for the bus- just standing there with his mouth hanging open, seemingly only half-aware of the goings-on of the world around him. Right then I almost blew the pop I was drinking out through my nose. To those who get it, this is poundingly-funny stuff. To the average viewer it may be only funny in parts, and to intellectuals who know no abstract appreciation of movies it may be nothing at all... But I'm sure most will get it...
B000002O1Q|5.0|This is a true jewel in our family of runners and I would like to thank our oldest brother Tom for the introduction to what quickly became known as \\"the mother of all running tapes.\\" I cannot possibly tell you how many times I have heard the phrase \\"who has my Streets of Fire tape\\" growing up in our house. This tape is full of inspiration as well as nostalgia. When your on your last mile of your run, and track number 6 kicks on(Tonight is What it Means to be Young) you know you can make it home, and you can make it home fast. <br />Thank you Streets of Fire, All 7 of us love you!!!!!!!
B00004W52U|5.0|I wish this band was still around.  Op Ivy was amazing, and this is a great CD.  \\"The Crowd\\" is one of my all time favorite songs.
B000929AJQ|4.0|I've recently started listening to NIN and am instantly obsessed. He has so much talent it is amazing, vocally,lyrically,instrumentally. I recommend this album for any NIN fan or if you have never heard NIN even.
B0009I7NNA|3.0|A7X is musically one of the best bands around right now, and this really shows through on this album.  There are two things about City of Evil that bother me.  First is the vocals.  No, I'm not mad that Matt can't/won't scream anymore.  When he actually sang on WTF he sounded awesome, and when I heard that he would be singing on this album, I expected him to sing like on WTF and was actually excited about that.  However, he seems to be channeling Axl Rose, which is not good.  A lot of it also sounds like Velvet Revolver.  Second, the lyrics in many places are really cheesy, and sometimes I actually feel embarrassed for Matt that he is singing such silliness.  I still like A7X, will continue to go to their shows, and will buy their next album.  I just hope that they get over this phase of trying to revive the 1980s, and that Matt (who has a lot of talent) will find his own singing style instead of copying has-beens from 20 years ago.
B0007DAZW8|4.0|When Daft Punk released their first single, Da Funk, it was also repetitive and a great tune.  This is their style and they haven't changed anything up. Either you like it or your hate it...but admit it, eventually there is that one or two songs you grow to love.  TECHNOLOGIC is an awesome song.

B00003CXCT|5.0|In its original theatrical release, George Lucas' iconic \\"Star Wars\\" (1977) made a big impact that continues to reverberate. That movie was followed by the cliffhanger sequel \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\" (1980), and the third film in the series was \\"Return of the Jedi\\" (1983). After tinkering with the three movies a little, Lucas released new theatrical versions in 1997. Now, tweaked versions of the 1997 films have been released as a four-disc DVD set under the collective title \\"Star Wars Trilogy,\\" marking the first time any version of these three films has been available on DVD.<br /><br />The 1977 movie commonly known originally as simply \\"Star Wars\\" has been retitled \\"Star Wars IV: A New Hope,\\" and \\"Star Wars V\\" and \\"Star Wars VI\\" have been incorporated into the titles of \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\" and \\"Return of the Jedi,\\" respectively. The retitling came about in connection with a trio of prequel films that began being released theatrically in 1999, and the numbering scheme indicates where each movie fits into the epic story's chronology.<br /><br />I've always found all three films in the Star Wars Trilogy to be great, and they form a unified whole. I wouldn't characterize them as science fiction I would describe them as pulpy space fantasy action adventure movies. They are set in some distant galaxy during a civil war, and we side with freedom-fighter rebels who are battling the evil Galactic Empire. I would say the \\"Trilogy\\" is an elaborate coming-of-age tale where we follow the maturation of an idealistic farm boy named Luke Skywalker.<br /><br />On his adventures, Luke teams up with daredevil smuggler Han Solo and plucky young Princess Leia, But Lucas has packed the \\"Trilogy\\" with a host of quirky characters, including a pair of delightful androids called C-3PO and R2-D2. And I think the movies' chief villain, Darth Vader is one of the most memorable in all of cinema.<br /><br />I've always found it intriguing that some inhabitants of the galaxy embrace the belief that there exists a mystical energy called the Force. There are certain beings called Jedi who seemingly derive special powers from the Force and use them to bring about good. To me, Alec Guinness gives an unforgettable performance as Obi-Wan Kenobi, a wise old Jedi who mentors Luke. Young Skywalker also receives training from another Jedi, the diminutive Yoda. But the Force is not automatically a source of good: it has a corrupting Dark Side that can result in evil.<br /><br />Each movie in the Trilogy is contained on its own single sided disc, and as far as I am concerned, the three feature films all look and sound terrific: the colors are vivid, the picture is sharp, and the sound is clean. The DVDs provide feature-length audio commentary tracks for all three movies. George Lucas, actress Carrie Fisher, sound designer Ben Burtt, and visual effects expert Dennis Muren are heard on all three tracks, and these four commentators are joined by a fifth, director Irvin Kershner, on \\"The Empire Strikes Back.\\" I found all three commentary tracks worthwhile, and I particularly enjoyed listening to Lucas and Kershner.

0375703764|4.0|There are times when House of Leaves gets a little trying, near the end particularly. However, the sheer creativeness and weirdness of this book is worth all the effort. This is not an easy book to read and requires an open mind and the ability to follow more than one plotline. There are also extensive almsot psychotic ramblings and research passages that can be confusing and boring. BUT, there is no doubt in my mind that I will forever remember House of Leaves. The exciting scenes of Navidson and his family and the misadventures with Truant are all worth the read.<br /><br />It is also pretty creepy. Not scary, as some have said, but just eerie and creepy. The best part is being left alone to draw your own conclusions on the what the dark void that consumes Navidson, Zampano and Truant is exactly. The images and feelings of coldness are conveyed very well and stuck with me.<br /><br />This book is not for everyone, in fact, it's not for most people. But if you think you might be one of the few who can appreciate this for what it is, then read away.
0451527046|2.0|Let's face it: this is a children's novel. It's designed for children to read and think they're reading an adult novel without realizing that that's what they're supposed to think. <br /> <br />The problem is, the language and the way they talk may make it hard for children to get through. Basically, Treasure Island has lost its target audience. <br /> <br />However, it is still a cute adventure romp that has inspired many of its kind (with or without Johnny Depp). Read it as a classic, not anything else.

B0007Y08IS|5.0|(This review was written in front of a live studio audience.)    Have you ever been in the awkward situation of having to explain a joke to someone, at a party or some such? Whether it's because they're too stupid to follow a Neanderthalically simple premise or just too drunk, blatant, hit-you-in-the-face satire fails to make an impression because you aren't literally hitting them in the face yet. I say yet, because this situation is infuriating if you've ever been in it. Your two options: endure the painful cries of \\"I don't get it\\" and \\"why is that funny\\" and \\"look at me, I'm a lamp,\\" or actually explain and simultaneously ruin the joke for them.    You know, it's frankly amazing to me the sheer number of people who honestly don't \\"get\\" this movie. Just saying so makes part of my brain do a double take at myself, wondering if I'm just a \\"feelm\\" snob or if everyone else is just an idiot.    Then I come to my senses. Everyone else is just an idiot.    Let's see, what are the main complaints about Team America: World Police surfacing like raw sewage in the tank that is Amazon?    1.) \\"The satire isn't \\"deep\\" enough, or completely nonexistent.\\" Why? Because it isn't rendered in Swiftian prose style and swaps some subtlety for the occassional PENIS joke? Well, whatever. If it existed (which would be hilarious), I'd recommend the Team America novelization for you more \\"literate\\" bitchers.    Perhaps the junior novelization.    2.) \\"The LANGUAGE ruins it!\\" No it doesn't. You're just uptight.    3.) \\"This is not a movie your kids should watch! I was fooled by the presence of puppets on the cover which my mind equated with harmless children's fare because I'm an uninformed idiot on par with the very people this movie is making fun of some of the time. Oh also, the title had 'America' in it so I thought it would be edutational for my children. Shame on Matt Stone and Trey Parker for being so deceptive!\\" Honestly, are you just living under a rock with a computer hooked up tothe internet? Good lord.    4.) \\"The puppet sex scarred me for life and this movie should have been rated XXX.\\" It was strange and nonsensical and lighter than the softest softcore porn. Given that puppets possess no genitals, which seem to be the deciding factor when it comes to rating film based on sexual content (the degree to which they are shown), any perceived pornography in the infamous puppet sex scene was filled in by your already-corrupted mind or that of your teenager who \\"shouldn't be watching this movie in the first place.\\" So yes, you/they are no longer innocent and have not been for quite some time. Also, you're a freak for enjoying it enough to call it porn instead of a F*CKING JOKE.    5.) \\"The 'plot' is insipidly boring, predictable, and almost nonexistent! I turned it off after 30 minutes of fast forwarding at 300x on my DVR!\\" Apparently, one can't get away with making boring, predictable crap if they are not Jerry Bruckheimer or Michael Bay and doing it in complete seriousness.    6.) \\"This movie is part of a vast right- (or left-) wing conspiracy and should be crucified and burned as the free speech-masquerading propaganda it really is, and anyone reading this can rest assured that should I bully my way into becoming president/dictator of this great nation I will do just that to anything I disagree with!\\" Gee, I'm sorry you're a delusional reactionary fool with no sense of humor, who, for whatever reason, is renting or buying comedies with clear political substance. Did you just pass out before the \\"big explanation\\" at the end? Moreover, if you stayed awake, did you NEED that explanation but fail to understand it regardless? Actors and anti-Bush campaigners are not portrayed as \\"pro-terrorist\\" by this movie by anyone but you and your worrying brain. They're simply portrayed as ignorant p*ssies who don't know any better.    To summarize, why do people hate this movie? They didn't get the joke.    And they never will.    \\"I reserve my right to hate you, not because of your skin color or culture, but because you are an idiot.\\" -- Mike Hutchison
0689878451|5.0|This is a great book, with some fantastic and adorable illustrations. The story of two male penguins coming together to form a family, raising an egg and everything, is timely. The subject is not approached from a pushy standpoint, and there is no preachy soapbox anywhere. It just illustrates the warmth that a family can create.
B000002O96|5.0|I first heard this record when a friend checked it our from the library many years ago-about 1974. I thought it was a lot of fun then (I recorded it to a reel to reel tape that has all but worn out) and I find it just as appealing today. I'm glad to see it reissued on a cd. If you want to hear Muddy, the Wolf, and Bo Diddly playing around with the music, talking the talk, and having fun together, then this is a must have album. It's three greats playing around like they were sitting in a living room with a couple of beers and having fun.
B0007OCG4W|5.0|I liked this film very much.<br /><br />The screenplay (adapted by the author of the original stageplay) is very well written. The story revolves around four people (you know who) who meet pretty much by chance (how modern...) and keep falling in and out of love with each other. Sounds simple? It is not. They cheat, they hurt, they lie, they cry... all between four people.<br /><br />But to me, the most interesting thing about this screenplay is the way the passing of the time is shown. It is hard to explain... we follow small moments of each couple's life and... suddenly there are jumps forward where big chunks of story left unseen suddenly became past. Clever, simple and intelligent. Frankly I haven't seen a script like this in years.<br /><br />Now the actors... oh, the actors... you can't get any better. Roberts, Law, Portman and Owen are simply top. Enough said?<br /><br />Some people (in other reviews) seemed to feel bothered by the cruel/explicit language in this film (may I remind you this is rated R). According to them, people do not talk like this. Maybe not. But people tend to forget that this film is written like a game and a puzzle. Many times, the screenplay engages in word playing (something that comes from the original source of this material: the stage). In a way, the film kept some of the word puzzles (which is not how people talk). Strange: nobody complains when Shakespeare does that... (laughs)<br /><br />On the other side, the screenplay clearly exaggerates some explicitness because in this operation lies many of the feelings we would not see had they done otherwise. The explicitness here may not be real... but the feelings are. And those dialogues shine because they go higher than reality.<br /><br />So maybe 50% of the dialogues may be too explicit or may be different from the way people talk... so what? in this film I think it is clearly justified... because other more subtler things than reality are at play. In fact, there is a lot of reality here that is put aside for (let's call it) poetic reasons... so the story can get to a certain point... so this character can end up this way... (think about the role coincidence plays here... think about all the things that would and could never happen in real life...) You really have to understand in order to enjoy.<br /><br />You don't really get this movie if you don't understand why the writer did what he did. And to me, the whole text is beautiful.<br /><br />A gem.ot of reality here that is put aside for (let's call it) poetic reasons... so the story can get to a certain point... so this character can end up this way...

0316172324|1.0|The author feeds you some entertaining anecdotes about everyting from the fraud archelogical findings to cops in extreme circumstances to marketing research. Unfortunately, the point of the book is a very primitive one: sometimes we are right in our snap judgements and sometimes we are wrong. He even comes up with the a catchy new term: \\"thin slicing\\". In my opinon however, the only place where you can't go wrong with thin slicing is a deli. So, go spend your money on a nice sandwich and skip this book. If you must read it - get it from a library.
0780619951|3.0|Overall the movie was ok, But i were expecting it 2 be a little bit more scary than that. I wanted 2 see this altimate monster that he was trying 2 create, that i thought was surly just around the bend in the movie, & the big finish with everyone trying 2 kill this altimate monster, never came about. I thought marlon brando & val kilmer did there part in the movie, It just that the writers didn't do theirs.
B00005A46T|4.0|I like this cd a lot, but i can see why some people hate it or say it isnt music. These guys i can say from experiance have an uncomparble live show, nothing rocks like it, i saw then with the likes of Unearth, Killswitch.engage. What people have to realize is that you cant keep on comparing them to like pantera or metallica or any other old metal band because they simply are not pantera or metallica they are slipknot. and for everyone who says Joey is an alright drummer...... get your head checked, He is one of the fastest drummers in metal history, and just because slipknot has two other percussionists does not mean you can take away from the talent that joey does have. If you want to hear Joey, listen to the murderdolls, his other band that are not like slipknot at all. Also check out his solo from the DVD Disasterpieces you can download it from anywhere so check it out and see if you still think he is bad.
B00004XOWM|1.0|Back in 2000 I made my brother buy me this album and ever since I have regretted making him get it for me.Limp bizkit is a good instrumental band but their weak link is FRED DURST.If they took him out and replaced him some guy who won a reality show kind of like the INXS show they could get a more talented singer,better song writer and overall a more respectable person and human being.The only thing I got out of this album was the crystal casing for another album.If any band or even one man you can find for hurting nu metal is here,The songs are dumb and sound like a retarded person wrote but i believe amentally challenged person could have written a better song song than him, in fact I have met people with dissabilities that could write a song that could chastize them in public.I hope that after this some stations he in California could stop playing their songs and play way better nu metal fans than these has beens.
B000002KCC|5.0|This is an album unique in the annals of classic rock.  It has even more of a documentary feel than most live albums. Although it isn't quite so, it sounds like Young and his band just turned on the microphone, and ran through the songs--probably while drunk and stoned.  On none of Young's other albums is his singing so out of tune. This is not the disk you'd turn to to hear his guitar soar or crunch. But this is one of his best albums because it has one of his strongest sets of songs, and everything that's wrong with this record sounds right because the songs are so concise, brilliant and emotionally powerful.<br /><br />For those of us who were following Young's career since the beginning, this album seemed to be in keeping with some other \\"bummer\\" records he was putting out during a bleak period in the mid-70s. It was fascinating, but difficult--maybe the most difficult. It came out with a lot of PR around it, with Young explaining in interviews his intentions, and the impact of the deaths of two associates.<br /><br />But the fact is, the context isn't really necessary, and despite its initial difficulty, you'll find the songs will stick in your mind as much or more than Young's very best.  I love \\"World on a String,\\" \\"Lookout Joe,\\" \\"Albuquerque,\\" and \\"Roll Another Number.\\" The two bookended versions of \\"Tonight's the Night\\" mark the album's territory--the land of death--with fierce, rolling chords that sound like thunder. \\"New Mama\\" on a different album would've been a joyful little folk song--here it sounds like a desperate reach for a lifeline. And the version of \\"Come on Baby Let's Go Downtown,\\" which features one of the dead friends who was part of Crazy Horse, is like a big snapshot on an easel at a funeral--a rememberance of happy times, but with dark overtones--the song is a merry tale of meeting your drug dealer. Young might not be in good voice, but he is at the top of his songwriting game, and his raggedness here is right for the material.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|I really enjoyed the It's Time cd and reading Dell's review just echoed our own sentiments. Great job on this nice cd Michael and good job on a relavent review Dell.
B00008S2VG|3.0|While she was known for the whole Kabbalah thing for awhile, it is more full-bloomed on her latest album, \\"American Life\\", than anything else. Those who cannot stand that kind of message may be turned off from the album, and I could totally understand why someone would hate this album, but personally I don't mind. Heck, I don't even agree with her spiritually! I will agree that it is not her best. Neither was \\"Music\\". That one was okay but a disappointing direction after the magnificent \\"Ray of Light\\" which I still think is her best studio album. It was a great mix of electronica and showed everything done with a good balance on the album. <br /> <br />\\"American Life\\", if you can swallow her messages, is okay. The lyrics didn't really insult my intellegence. In fact, there are some points that I really do like. I like the title track quite a bit, a stab at how media has a lot to expect out of people. The rap is something that turns people off but personally I don't find it that embarassing. It's kind of fun, actually. Then, while not a great song, \\"Hollywood\\" is still kind of an enjoyable song, yet another song about how the media is. It's not really one that you'll be playing over and over again but it's decent. \\"Love Profusion\\" is easily the greatest blend of folk and techno. Personally I wouldn't mind if she kept on playing guitar on her albums. I think it shows an honest side of her growth even if it's not a message that everyone can swallow. It is one that I tend to repeat quite often. Also there is by far my favorite moment here, \\"Die Another Day\\", which is classic Madonna. It's the closest to electro-clash her songs have gotten and shows some new ground broken in Madonna's songs. These four songs are the \\"better\\" from \\"American Life\\" <br /> <br />There of course is a lot of problems with \\"Life\\". For instance, I can't get over how much vocoder is used on some of these songs, notably \\"Nobody Knows Me\\". The message is a bit pretentious and I realize she wanted to make it personally but that effect is hard for me to stomach for a whole song. The choir and stuff on \\"Nothing Fails\\" is just kind of awkward for me; I don't know what it is really. Then there is \\"Mother and Father\\" which you don't want to listen to if you did not like \\"American Life\\"'s rap, because this one has more of it and is worse. Either way, there are many things not to like about \\"Life\\" and I thought I'd warn that to those who may not like the message. <br /> <br />The rest is in between. Not her greatest moment at all, but I think she does have some relevance even after this record. I kind of am interested in what's next even though it may not be perfect. But hey, maybe it won't be on too many albums that she does this. Besides she had a lot of really worthy output in the previous years. If you're fine with everything Madonna's doing and like what you're expecting than I say go ahead and buy it anyway, but this one with precautions.
B0006L16N8|5.0|With its latest release, \\"X&Y,\\" Coldplay has certified itself as a reliable hitmaker and has cemented its relationship with record buyers, who purchase their albums by the truckload. Fortunately, the quality of the music proves that the hype surrounding the release much deserved.<br /><br />  Although the raw intimacy of their stellar debut \\"Parachutes\\" is all but a distant memory, the decidedly more mainstream sound of \\"X&Y\\" does nothing to detract from the band's dependably high-caliber lyrics.<br /><br />  Whether it is on sentimental schmaltz like \\"Swallowed In the Sea\\" or on pensive tracks such as \\"What If,\\" lead singer Chris Martin infuses the songs with the right passion to bring them to life. The best example is perhaps \\"Talk,\\" a definite highlight.<br /><br />  \\"You could take a picture of something you see/In the future where will I be/You could climb a ladder up to the sun/Or write a song nobody had sung/Or do something that's never been done.\\"<br /><br />  Elsewhere, the aggressive rock of \\"White Shadows\\" ruminates over the feeling of what it is to come of age, while the namesake track conjures a more optimistic atmosphere. So titled to reflect the differing set of chromosomes in men and women, the content of the song alludes to the union of the two genders, reasoning that it is best to complacently let the mystery of life take effect.<br /><br />  Although it does not quite mirror the grandeur of past smash smashes such as \\"Clocks\\" or \\"The Scientist,\\" \\"Speed of Sound\\" is nonetheless an excellent lead-single and the most radio-ready selection on the disc. \\"Square One,\\" which contemplates the moment of conception, and the bittersweet \\"The Hardest Part\\" are also ultra-catchy choices for subsequent singles.<br /><br />  The disc concludes with \\"Twisted Logic,\\" leaving listeners with a thought-provoking piece of wisdom.<br /><br />  \\"Hundreds of years in the future/There could be computers looking for life on Earth/So don't fight for the wrong side/Say what you feel like/Say how you feel.\\"<br /><br />  Ultimately, \\"X&Y\\" is another top-notch release from Coldplay that finds the band doing what it does best, while nonetheless broadening its horizons and effectually taking its listeners on a ride with many twists and turns.<br /><br />  The initial pressing of the album contains a hidden song, \\"Til' Kingdom Come,\\" while \\"Proof\\" and \\"Things I Don't Understand,\\" tracks that did not make the final cut of \\"X&Y,\\" are available on the \\"Speed of Sound\\" import single.side/Say what you feel like/Say how you feel.\\"                Ultimately, \\"X&Y\\" is another top-notch release from Coldplay that finds the band doing what it does best, while nonetheless broadening its horizons and effectually taking its listeners on a ride with many twists and turns.

B000000WJZ|5.0|I think the funniest thing is that when you look at the negative reviews for this album, none of them are on target unless they talk about their already-big hatred for Corgan/The Pumpkins. Also, I saw a review that said this was just \\"power chords\\". That has to be the most off-target assessment for the album, EVER. Because being a guitar player myself, sometimes it's hard for me to catch on to Billy Corgan's guitar playing. There is quite a bit of depth here musically and lyrically. Many \\"emo\\" bands wish that they could make a record like this: Full of emotion and musical proficiency. I honestly don't think I could find a thing on this album that isn't enjoyable.    The perfect way to start an album? \\"Cherub Rock\\". Intro is drumroll and then some octave-like guitar playing (this was hard for me because I didn't know what I was being told to do when I read a tablature for the album) and it totally does rock. Even before that distortion turns it into a wall of sound it is an anthem. One that is a great middle finger to the indie scene of the time.   \\"Quiet\\" starts out with some cool guitar sliding and then gets more rockin', a great song with a nice timing and is one of the most simple on the album. However, it's fun to listen to and you can hear the angst in Corgan's vocals.  Then it gets to one of the best songs made ever: \\"Today\\". Even after all that time it gets played on the radio it is an amazing song. The intro is one of my favorite intro riffs ever, and while simple is fun to play on guitar. Other than that it is somewhat ironic that he wrote this as his alternative solution to suicide. It's quite the melodic song and became a hit for a good reason. On top of the fact that the music video was so good (I'll get to that on another review). Then it follows into \\"Hummer\\" with one of the coolest intros I've heard in a song; its static intro is what makes the song, as well as the melody it gets into. One of the more challenging songs on the record.  Then comes in to\\"Rocket\\" which pretty much stands out because of the guitar solo and the cool Boss Octave effect. Its chorus is short yet notable. Then comes into \\"Disarm\\", a peacefully song with cello and chimes which shows a great sentimental side of the Pumpkins. It is another one that became a classic. When you think about it, Billy's melody is similar to that on Pink Floyd's \\"Wish You Were Here\\".  Next we get to a relatively soft song that picks up, and was partially penned by James Iha. Wall of sound this is as there was like fourteen guitar tracks in this and it also has Mike Mills of R.E.M. fame on piano in the beginning. Such a heartbreaking song to listen to but also very good. One of the longer songs on \\"Dream\\", yet also one that will connect with a lot of listners. Basically, \\"Geek U.S.A.\\" is the song that represents the album the best. It's kind of like a three-part track; one part just rocks, then the bridge changes up the pace a little bit but is interesting, and then the melody starts to sound familiar with the rest of the album. Then it gets into one of the greatest guitar solos of the '90s, with a great delivery on everything from Corgan and Chamberlin (the drummer, for those who didn't know). Then you get into another one that has music partially written by James Iha, this time in \\"Mayonaise\\", which has some of Billy's greatest lyrics possibly ever. Everything about it is a good-structured song and is repeat worth listenings. Then it goes on to a more quiet side with \\"Spaceboy\\" which also has that orchestral instrumentation.  The album isn't through with ideas just there. \\"Silverf**k\\" has an almost funk-like delivery in the verses but is really a rawking song in its chorus. It's really interesting; perhaps more than the rest of the record. Almost nine minutes but it won't be too hard for you to get into, either. Then it kind of gets happier in its last two songs: \\"Sweet, Sweet\\" and \\"Luna\\". The former is very simple and short, while the latter is similar in instruementation to \\"Disarm\\" (but more happy as stated before), another song full of emotion and everything in a track that is supposed to be good. I don't think I'd need to tell you that it's great for you to know it; even just listening to the samples will make you think of why this record connects with as many people as it does. I don't find it the least bit overrated.    After listening to the record you will find out that complaining about Corgan's ego is just stupid because his music more than makes up for that (although I am admittedly a biased fan and didn't think his quotes I've read were overtly so). Besides, what matters more is what you get. It's one of those cases where the album sales actually reflect the quality of the album. Nixing out the grunge influence of \\"Gish\\" and further expanding on wall-of-sound guitar delivery and a good mix between the heavy and soft is what you will get on \\"Siamese Dream\\". Your record collection is not complete without it. Also, listen to \\"Gish\\" and \\"Siamese Dream\\" because I guarantee you that you won't mind Corgan's vocals. They sound real on-key and melodic here. Not as much of a band effort as other efforts but still worth listening to.
B0007GAERG|5.0|The Emancipation Of Mimi is Mariah Carey's second album for Island Def Jam after 2002's Charmbracelet. With radio-friendly tracks like \\"Through The Rain\\", \\"Boy (I Need You)\\" and \\"Bringin' On The Heartbreak\\", this album failed to secure a major comeback for this chanteuse extraordinaire. Nevertheless, with The Emancipation Of Mimi, she manages to once again stamp her mark in the ever challenging music industry. No one can ever deny the fact that she is one the world's most talented and best-selling artiste of all time. <br /> <br />The first single of the album, \\"It's Like That\\" featured the likes of Jermaine Dupri and Fatman Scoop. Great and wonderful track although it did not create a massive ripple in the charts as compared to its successor, \\"We Belong Together\\". This song is Mariah's 16 #1 single in the US, trailing only The Beatles and Elvis Presley. With already 8 weeks at the top of the Billboard Hot 100 with this single, Mariah looks set to break The Beatles' record of 80 weeks atop the chart. The third single, already debuting at #66 on the Hot 100, \\"Shake It Off\\" will undoubtedly make it through all the radio stations' playlists all over the world. <br /> <br />With gems like \\"Say Somethin'\\" featuring Snoop Dogg, \\"Mine Again\\", \\"One & Only\\", \\"Circles\\", \\"To The Floor\\", \\"Get Your Number\\", just to name a few, be prepared to see Mariah dominates next year's Grammy Awards. Album, Record and Song Of The Year is within her grasp as well as wins for vocal performances, songwritings and album for fields as diverse as pop, R & B and rap/sung collaborations. Print this review and keep it for comparisons when the Grammy nominees are announced this coming December. All hail the Queen...the one and only, the valedictorian of the first class of divas, the multi-talented, million-selling Mariah Carey.
B000000OQY|4.0|By the late 1980's,after Guns 'n Roses had released their debut album,1987's APPETITE FOR DESTRUCTION,they had already become one of the most succsful bands that were around at the time. And after making an album that would later go on to be praised as not only the best metal record of the late 80's,but also as one of the best rock albums ever made,in 1988,Guns 'n Roses released their sophomore album,which was entitled G&R LIES. How did the album meausure up? Read on for my review of this:    This album,while it is the weakest album Guns 'n Roses ever released,is still pretty good. When G&R band members Axl Rose,Duff McKagen,Izzy Stradlin,Slash,and Steven Adler were getting ready for this album,they decided to make it an eight song record. The first four songs off of it are live performances of four songs--two G&R originals called RECKLESS LIFE and MOVE TO THE CITY,and two cover songs--a cover of Aerosmith's MAMA KIN and a cover of a song called NICE BOYS(I can't remember who did that song). Those four songs had actually originally appeared on LIVE LIKE A SUICIDE,a four song live EP that Guns 'n Roses had releasd in 1986, a year before APPETITE FOR DESTRUCTION had come out.The original live songs were pretty good,and their cover of MAMA KIN,while it is not as good as the original version,was a pretty good cover,and Guns 'n Roses did a good job at making it sound like Guns 'n Roses,kind of like how Warrant's cover version of Queen's WE WILL ROCK YOU sounded like--well,of course,Warrant!    And then,there were the four studio songs off of this record. These songs were very different than the songs on APPETITE FOR DESTRUCTION,but they were still pretty good. They were also songs that were on all accoustics. The first one of those songs was PATIENCE,an accoustic ballad that,while it was slow,was a really nice song. Here they also did an accoustic remake of YOU'RE CRAZY,one of their songs off of APPETITE FOR DESTRUCTION-I like the original one better,but the accoustic version sounds really good also,and the idea of performing it on accoustic guitar was a really cool idea. And then,there is USED TO LOVE HER--which is a funny country/rock song about murdering your wife and burying her in your backyard because she complained too much,and then up next is ONE IN A MILLION--that is my favorite song out of the original G&R songs on this record. That track is also on accoustics(as well as electrics),and a piano is on it also--the music sounds really nice,and this song(along with USED TO LOVE HER)caused a controversy--and why is that? Because there are racial slurs in this song--but really,this song isn't racist--it is actually a really nice ballad that has some good and deep lyrics to it.    Overall,a good sophomore album from Guns 'n Roses. Shortly after this album was released in November 1988,because of both USED TO LOVE HER and ONE IN A MILLION,Guns 'n Roses became a center of controversy--and even though that eventually died out(sort of)it was sad when drugs,alcohol,and big egos led to The Gunners eventually calling it quits in 1996. Give this album a listen--it may not be APPETITE FOR DESTRUCTION,USE YOUR ILLUSION I,or USE YOUR ILLUSION II,but it still is a pretty good album--it might even be better than you expected it would be!
B0009MDPYW|1.0|Terrible written fright film that has possible the worse performance of the last few years by Keanu Reeves, who literally weighs the film down with his bad acting and bad presence in this film. I would love to meet the casting agent with though that Keanu Reeves of all people would have been great in this movie. The dialog is so bad in this film that you really are taken a back at the sheer stupidity of it and the story does not hold any weight as for as common sense goes. Keanu's interpretation of the character goes into overload after the first half-hour and the rest of the movie follows his lead into absurdity. The special effects are poorly done for a movie of this size and the cinematography is just horrible in some parts of the film. Of the supporting cast, only Rachel Weisz(Confidence, Runaway Jury) and Peter Stormare(Birth,Fargo) come out of this movie with passing grades and that's because they are both able to transcend the horrible script with very good performances that is better than the whole entire film. Weisz gives a strong and compelling performance with her character and that in itself a huge compliment considering the fact that the script does not do her performance any justice and Peter Stormare dominates the last ten minutes of the film with a perfect performance that should have been a lead instead of a cameo.  <br /> <br /> <br />Other than their performances, the movie just does not cut it and that's because of the lame writing and the miscasting of Keanu Reeves.  <br /> <br /> <br />
B0009I7NNA|5.0|So, basically I signed up just to review this.  All these people complaining. I saw someone to say if you're looking for a good metalcore record, keep looking.  While \\"good metalcore\\" is one hell of an oxymoron, that person's right.  Avenged Sevenfold are not metalcore.  They are pure metal and have always said as much.  There's no bad song on this record.  They're going to take over, because besides Velvet Revolver, they're the only band out right now with a really good rock album. It'll be funny when all the stupid metalcore loving kids get over that stupid trend and once again like Avenged Sevenfold when it's \\"cool\\" to like them. Having been a fan since Sounding The Seventh Trumpet, I can say I'm not going anywhere.  Best songs on the album?  Probably Trashed&Scattered, Strength Of the World, MIA, Betrayed (Dimebag Darrell tribute), and Blinded In Chains.  The whole album is awesome,and if you don't like it. Well, I don't know WHY.  BY THE WAY: I'm seeing a lot of Shadows CAN'T scream, not true. He CAN scream. He learned a way to scream after getting his surgery that won't hurt his vocal chords. He doesn't WANT to scream.
B000000P17|3.0|This is GNR's last and worst album. Don't let that stop you from listening to it though, it is still an alright album. Duff McKagen sings around half the tracks on this album which is wierd because without Axle's unique voice it doesn't sound 100% like GNR. There was a lot of conflict in the band, especially at this time, which is probably one of the reasons why they didn't write any new songs in their last couple years and just did covers. The majority of the hard songs on this album are very punk influenced. This album also contains quite a few F-words (Buick MacKane and I Don't Care About You). I was surprised after listening to it that it was not Parental Advisery. If you are just getting into GNR then pass this one up and get Appetite for Destruction or one of the Use Your Illusion albums. Save this one for last if you are a GNR fan. If you don't REALLY like GNR then i recommend just passing this up. This album contains no essential songs by the band.
B0009A1AS2|4.0|It looks like Atlantic is in the mix now ... recall what happened to Rush ... whether you like it or not, Rush became focused on \\"songs\\" and \\"producing\\" after Atlantic got in the mix ... less \\"Cygnus\\" and more \\"Closer to the Heart\\"... <br /> <br />IMHO, DT is proof that prog-rock is alive and well ... I pray that for every gorgeous and sweet \\"I walk beside you\\" there is an equally beautiful and ravenous \\"Octavarium\\" ... <br /> <br />Either way, buy the disc!!!

B000002HRE|5.0|I've been a fan since the Kill Em All days and i like the fact that they have re-invented themselves over the years. Fuel is the perfect combination of heavy and catchy. I could listen to that song for days on end! The Memory Remains is my 2nd fave on the disc. If your not one of those morons who thinks if Metallica does'nt play 100 miles per hour they suck then you'll dig this record.
1400031087|4.0|I found this book to be very interesting.  Parts of it were offensive and a bit uncomfortable to read, BUT it only made me want to read it and get through the experience with James.  It made me want to see what was going to happen next and how everything would play out.  This book was very good, there is something for everyone to learn from it.  This book teaches about many things, control, addiction, love, strength, and much more.  I finished the book in 4 days, I did not want to put it down.  I can not wait to read MFL, I hope it will be just as good.
B00012QM8G|5.0|Steven Spielberg's film achievements stand unreachably tall in Hollywood, and \\"Schindler's List\\" is his masterpiece.<br /><br />Oskar Schindler was not, by many measurements, a \\"good\\" man. He was a womanizer and failed several marriages. He was a german war profiteer during World War II, and failed several businesses after the war. He also took steps of bravery and personal sacrifice to preserve the lives of over 1,100 Polish Jews. At the end of the film a graphic tells us that today there are fewer than 4,000 Jews in Poland, but that there are 6,000 descendants of those saved by Oskar Schindler's actions.<br /><br />Liam Neeson also gives the performance of his career as Schindler. He is comfortable cajoling and cavorting with the Nazi's. He is initially only a businessman, and doesn't hesitate to bribe Nazi officials to get preferential business arrangements.<br /><br />Ben Kingsley shines in a performance reminiscent in some ways of his luminescent portrayal of Gandhi. He portrays Itzhak Stern, an accountant Schindler hires to do all the work of Schindler's businesses while Schindler himself is glad-handing the Nazi's and \\"adding some panache\\" to the business. The central relationship of the film is between Schindler and Stern as the situation becomes increasingly grim for the Jews and Schindler realizes that he can use the same techniques that he has developed as a businessman to create \\"safe\\" jobs for the Jews.  As long as the Jews are working in Schindler's factory they are spared extermination.  At one point the German's are in danger of losing the ground where Schindler's factory sits and they are ordered to \\"liquidate\\" the camp again.  Schindler uses all his war profits to \\"buy\\" the Jews from Goeth, then to relocate them to another factory where they will make artillery ammunition on machines that Schindler has miscalibrated.  Schindler expends his entire fortune to save the Jews in an ammunition factory that never produced a shell that could be fired.<br /><br />Ralph Fiennes steps out onto a limb portraying the terrible Amon Goeth, who rapes and murders and forgives himself as the camp commander over the Jews. To accomplish his goals Schindler befriends even Goeth, and in one memorable scene Oskar appeals to Goeth's vanity to have him stop being so trigger-happy murdering the Jewish prisoners.<br /><br />We see horrors more terrible than any horror film. The Jews are initially all herded into the Krakow ghetto, then it is decided that the ghetto is to be emptied - Nazi soldiers stroll through the streets murdering Jews in cold blood. Later a trainload of Jewish women are mistakenly routed to Auschwitz. Their terror is palpable as they see the smoke billowing from the chimneys over the ovens. They are then stripped and herded into the showers where they have heard the whispers of the \\"special treatment\\" that the Jews are receiving. The terror of that scene is beyond any fictional machete-wielding movie madman.<br /><br />Spielberg is a master of visual storytelling, and he made a brilliant decision to shoot in black and white, but to use color in just a few shots for a few specific items. In one key scene candle flames burn their brilliant orange and in another mesmerizing use of color Spielberg highlights the red coat of a little girl who is walking through the carnage of the liquidation of Krakow. When we see the red coat again an hour later, our eyes are drawn to it, and we know it's meaning.<br /><br />Spielberg attaches faces to the Holocaust. The ending is one of the most powerful ever seen as the actual survivors are paired with the actors portraying them in the movie. They line up to file past Oskar Schindler's grave and we feel the impact of Schindler's actions.<br /><br />He has not \\"saved the world\\", but he has saved many, many lives.onto a limb portraying the terrible Amon Goeth, who rapes and murders and forgives himself as the camp commander over the Jews.

B0007P3582|1.0|I don't even know where to start but this guy is the biggest thief in the history of man. People have given their life earned money to this scum of society who talks about get rich or die trying and massacres. What happened to \\"go to college and get rich\\", or \\"buy a business and get rich\\"? The last time I heard, the richest man on this planet created the Pentium processor in which we have the wonderful gift of writing these thoughts and letting the world know how we truly feel. Now I can understand why a fan would be mad after paying $13.99 plus tax for this garbage and getting nothing out of this other then the fact 50 has taught very important and material of true Zen wisdom including the necessity of acquiring and using an automatic assault rifle when others not of your tribe attempt to sell drugs in your territory without cutting you in on the profits and then stand outside your grandmothers home while the \\"neighborhood homies\\" return for vengeance by firing 9 deadly shots into your chest and jaw.       No thank you, I like not having holes in my jaw and going to college to get a degree so I can \\"not\\" wear a bullet proof vest when going out in public and not having to walk with 5o police officers when taking my girlfriend out to dinner.
B0002IU988|5.0|The addition of Myles Kennedy put this band over the top. He's got a fresh new voice that harmonizes incredibly with the music. The real credit for this album however should go to Mark Tremonti. Saying he did A fantastic job of writing lyrics and melodies is a severe understatement. It's a fantastic debut album and I'm looking forward to their next release.
B00007DTI6|5.0|This is an incredible cd... even for those who do not speak portuguese, their style of music is incredible! I have seen them live and they are an incredible show to watch.
0060977493|5.0|This is the very FIRST book I've read twice!  I refer to the prose as \\"eye candy.\\"  You can just eat up every sentence!  The characters are dynamic and beautiful. I love how it is written from the perspective of a little girl and jumps periodically to her adulthood.  The story is amazing and takes you places you couldn't imagine!  You end the book feeling a new appreciation for life and love.  It isn't a book for everyone and isn't a very light read.  But from the first page, I was hooked!
B0008ISM40|4.0|NIN is still rocking, but now the songs lack of that ''raw'' essence that appeared even in ''the fragile'' cds.<br /><br />''Downard...'' is the masterpiece to measure all the other Reznor works and this last album Trent kinda went into a friendly spot: the songs are almost ''catchy'', almost like ''industrial pop''.<br /><br />Tracks like: ''all_the_love_in_the_world'', ''only'', ''the_hand_that_feeds'' are the most comercial songs that NIN realesed in this cd. ''you_know_what_you_are'' is the ''in your face song'' of the cd. The others tracks to me lack of personality but still are good. An theres always the softy song in the end of the disc: ''right_where_it_belongs'' (a ''Hurt'' wannabe song).<br /><br />Oh... you must buy the DUAL DISC... you won't regret it!!!<br /><br />the menus are great, the halo list is a nice touch and the video of ''the_hand_that_feeds'' is cool...<br /><br />have a nice day...
B0000399WC|3.0|The pluses here are the music score and cinematography are excellent.  The minus here is that this film just meanders.  The establishing sequences showing the abuses and horrible conditions in the French penal colony border on overkill.  Papillon's escape from the prison isn't very thrilling.  What elevates this film is Steve McQueen's work in the title role.  McQueen captures the essence of a determined man who may or may not have been wrongfully accused of murder in his efforts to escape an unjust imprisonment.  McQueen is such a solid presence here that the sheer power of his performance overcomes the ridiculous old-age make-up he has to wear in the film's latter sequences.  Dustin Hoffman is on hand here as a counterfeitor and Papillon's best friend.  He's not bad but this isn't one of Hoffman's more memorable roles.
0783226837|5.0|This is a great movie that is one of the best that I have seen. When you watch it you might like it depending on your taste of movies. Enough said.
B00004XPPB|3.0|I'm going to be upfront here. A lot of the reviews on this page paint the movie in a positive light, and deservedly so. If you haven't read the book, then this movie is quite good. There's a decent plot, and the producers have stuck to the original story to some extent. Al Pacino & Johnny Depp both shine in their respective roles. <br /> <br />Where I distinguish my review is on the basis of me having read the book. I do agree that my qualms with the movie are probably a common issue, where viewers are disappointed with the extent to which the movie does not represent the book. However, one has to remind oneself that this is a true story, and I felt a few things were lacking in the movie (warning plot spoilers may be ahead). <br /> <br />- When I first saw the movie (without reading the book i.e, I saw the movie twice), it gave me the impression that it wasn't that difficult after all for Donnie to break into the mould and forge a friendship with Lefty. In fact, a similar view has been expressed by another reviewer. The reality is totally different. It took months and months if not a year, for Donny to be trusted by different street guys, and finally gaining enough respect and a reputation in order to break the ice with Lefty. <br /> <br />- Most painful, Joe Pistone was never conflicted in his role as Donnie Brasco. I wish Hollywood didn't add this element in for drama purposes. For those who've seen the movie, it's evident that towards the end, Joe expresses mixed feelings towards his role as an FBI agent and almost seems reluctant to leave the Mafia and return to his normal life. <br /> <br />- In real life, Joseph D. Pistone didn't change his values, attitudes and focus throughout his six year 'tenure' with the mafia. He was proud of what he achieved, and proud of being an FBI agent. True, he felt some remorse for decieving Lefty, but Pistone expressed the view that he was doing his job, just as Lefty and Sonny were doing theirs. <br /> <br />- Last but not least, I felt the movie was a bit too rushed in certain aspects. An example would be the first comment made about the misleading impression that Donnie broke into the Mafia quite quickly. On deeper introspection, it seems there could have been greater character development with regards to Lefty and Sonny. <br /> <br />Still, this is a well-directed and interesting movie, if quite misleading in quite a few aspects. I must say, those who are not familiar with mafia jargon and street talk will find it quite hard to follow! To sum up; A lot more could have been acheived with such a great book. Therefore, it's a solid movie, but not up there with the classics.
B00009W0U4|4.0|This movie actually made me sob.  I didn't know going in the movie was being told backwards so I admit to being a bit confused...very vertigo(ish)in the opening fifteen minutes, but after catching on I was able to follow. <br /> <br />Be warned...the scene where Monica Bellucci is raped is just horrible.  I was unable to stomach a lot of it...then to see her beat afterwards was just...God it was awful. <br /> <br />This is probably one of the most tragic movie's I've ever watched.  I was literally in tears at the end. <br /> <br />I won't lie...this is NOT a feel good movie.  This isn't even a movie you'll probably ever want to watch after one viewing...that's if you can even get through it the first time, but it is an incredibly brave story staring an incredibly brave actress. <br /> <br />I was stunned by the sheer force of the imagery and brutality.  It's foreign...and I know a lot of people shy away from the sometimes avant garde camera work in this movies...and it is a bit dizzying sometimes, but there are scenes that are just haunting. <br /> <br />The interaction between Marcus and Alex as they play together after sex were so tender and beautiful.   <br /> <br />This is a movie made up of contradictions;  Unmatched beauty and Undeniable violence. <br /> <br />Not for the squeamish.
B0000931OG|4.0|I'm not the Blur fan that values the thrashier songs best; when I first heard \\"Tender\\" I thought \\"this is the pinnacle of Blur's songwriting abilities\\".  Think Tank most assuredly suffers from a lack of Graham Coxon.  There's no getting around that.  And I don't appreciate what I think of as throwaway songs like Crazy Beat and We've Got a File on You.  The mind's resistance to this as a Blur album is palpable on first and second listen.  But after you've passed the stages of grief and finally hit acceptance, the placid texture of Caravan will wash over you.  The gloriously unfaded Blur melodics of Ambulance will pierce your soul.  The ironic sincerity of Brothers and Sisters will have you smiling.  And perhaps the best Blur song in several years, Gene by Gene, will mutter its casual and quirky way past your guard as you realize the simple genius of its structure (bedsprings!?).  While you're holding your breath waiting for the promised return of Graham, this will keep you from passing out.
B000957O82|5.0|First off, this movie is just great.  My wife and I watched this for the second time last night (first was in the theater) and we had forgotten how great this movie really was.  The chemestry between all the charactors is perfect.  Will and Kevin have real presence together, but the scene stealer is always Kevin James.  He just has a way of making you laugh at EVERYTHING.  He's the reason 'King of Queens' is one of my favorite shows (next to 'Yes, Dear')  Anyways, 'Hitch' revolves around Alex 'Hitch' Hitchens (Smith) who is a dating consultant for men who want to sweep the woman of their dreams off their feet.  His next job is poor Albert (James) who is in love with Alegra Cole, some rich high society sociallite, kinda like a soffisticated Paris Hilton.  So he enlists Hitch to help him get the girl.  And it works.  Now the real story here lies with Hitch falling in love with Sarah (Mendez) who is a gossip collumist who believes that the 'Date Doctor' is just an urban myth.  The problem with Hitch is that his own medicine doesn't seem to work on him and he just seems to screw everything up with the girl.  The great thing about this movie is that no matter who your watching your going to be laughing.  The movie as a whole is just really entertaining and very well put together.  Will Smith is always a good actor, very funny and he has that charm that makes you watch him.  But, as good as Smith is here he lacks that 'everyman' quality that makes Kevin the highlight of the film.  Watch this movie with that special someone, it's the perfect date movie and is a movie you can recommend to pretty much EVERYONE.

B00009V7T2|5.0|I never heard of Mars Volta untill a few months ago I heard a song on the internet called roulette dares. I immediatly fell in love with that song. I could not get it out of my head. So then I finally got the this album. The album is great, the singer has a really nice voice and the guitar riffs are awesome. The album is worth getting just for the song roulette dares. Just listen to few of the tracks especially roulette dares and you will like it.
B0009IW88A|3.0|I really like the haunting, broken-heart feeling of this film score. It has a passionate and insistent melody, but it is delivered in a quiet and subdued way, like a wild beast pacing its cage. This score reminds me a lot of the similarly subdued tension that underpinned Ennio Morricone's score for Mike Nichols' 1994 film, \\"Wolf\\", starring Jack Nicholson and Michelle Pfeiffer.    The score does have a couple of tracks in the middle (\\"Artibeus\\" and \\"Tadarida\\"), focused on the Scarecrow character, which I find disturbing and frightening, so I always have to skip past them. But other than that, it's a really good score. While the thematic melody is not especially memorable after the fact, it is cohesive and sounds very compelling while it's being played.
B000002H1T|5.0|Beaches, convertibles, MTV showing real videos. Think Andy Warhol flash-cutting grainy images to \\"Hello Again.\\" Watch Ric Ocasek walk on water during \\"Magic.\\" Think of cruising to \\"You Might Think.\\" And remain in awe of the late Ben Orr's best vocal since the debut, on the groundbreaking smash ballad, \\"Drive.\\"<br /><br />That's what makes The Cars' final great album, \\"Heartbeat City,\\" their most consistent album since that perfect first disc. It marked a creative highwater level in the band's evolution, mixing in the best of their Buddy Holly pop with their \\"Panorama\\" darkness. It also moved away from their Roy Thomas Baker sterile sheen to \\"Mutt\\" Lange's polished pop glow (he who made Def Leppard both shattering and melodic) and fed it to the masses as fantastic cotton candy summer tunes. Place this record next to Bruce Springsteen's \\"[[ASIN:B0000025UW Born in the U.S.A.]],\\" Huey Lewis' \\"[[ASIN:B00000JCFP Sports]],\\" ZZ Top's \\"[[ASIN:B000002KYR Eliminator]],\\" Van Halen's \\"[[ASIN:B00004Y6O3 1984]]\\" and Billy Idol's \\"[[ASIN:B00000JCFW Rebel Yell]],\\" and you had the party records that stuck in your memory for that year.<br /><br />\\"Heartbeat City\\" still holds fast to its best moments. It gave The Cars' their biggest seller to that date, and their highest charting single. But it also gave them one of the most haunting songs in their canon, with the mysterious title track. Vaguely hinting at what almost sounds like a drug addiction, the enigmatic Jacki has \\"happy days we count on thumbs.\\" The domicile of \\"Heartbeat City\\" is both an alluring and distant place, and Ocasek mutters \\"it's my life\\" as the song fades away. Oddly enough, that song bids goodbye to The Car's last decent album; I am sure there aren't too many folks with ecstatic summer memories of \\"Door To Door.\\"<br /><br />Which also begs the question; this was a major seller from a band that had consistent platinum plus successes. Why are their no remastered Cars albums other than the debut? An album this great really deserves better than the old, flat original CD transfer. An upgrade is due, and soon, please!han the old, flat original CD transfer. An upgrade is due, and soon, please!
B000002NIW|5.0|Even though Deftones hate the \\"nu-metal\\" label, they, alongside Korn, practically invented/popularized the genre. Deftones actually formed in the 1980's, but their debut, 1995's \\"Adrenaline,\\" drew many-a-Korn comparison. 1997's \\"Around the Fur\\" also helped to pave nu-metal's path (since it came before most nu-metal bands), but their sophomore album definitely helped them step out of their contemporary's shadow. The main difference here is the vocal styles and an addition of melody. The hip-hop influence is all but gone from the vocals, and Chino gets to show off his proper singing voice, carrying songs like \\"Be Quiet and Drive (Far Away)\\" and making them tuneful. He also does this for tracks 2, 3, and 4.<br /><br />But, by no means did the Deftones ditch their roots on this album; most of \\"Around the Fur\\" is still plenty heavy. Steph Carpenter is one of the most overlooked axemen in hard rock today and he lays down some really bad-ass guitar work, here. His riffs plow ahead, drive the beats, crunch, and straight up groove on most of these songs. But Steph isn't overly dominating, he gives way to the vocals, letting Chino control the song tempos and volume.<br /><br />\\"My Own Summer\\" is \\"Around the Fur\\"'s first single. I've heard hardly any Deftones songs on the radio (where I live), except this one. The Deftones haven't had much luck with any singles, but \\"My Own Summer\\" set records for radio play. A surging, almost grinding riff, runs throughout and the verses have restrained vocals (there are whispers at times), but the choruses jump in volume. Chino really lets loose and yells \\"Shove it, shove it, shove it!\\" (meaning he wants to shove the sun aside.) This song would make a great soundtrack for the last day of school.<br />\\"Mascara\\" isn't musically great, but it's a nice, slow, romantic song. (Romantic in a sad and disturbing way, but romantic nonetheless.) \\"Mascara\\" brings down the album's pace a bit, after two heavy songs. I think this song's lyrics are about an abusive relationship.<br />\\"Rickets\\" has verses which are churning riffs with whispering, but the beginning and chorus of this song has good, strong, heavy riffs and fast drumming. This song was probably written when Chino was in a bad mood and he just needed to vent some anger and say how much he hates it when you tell him what to do.<br />\\"Be Quiet and Drive (Far Away)\\" has always been a personal favorite. The music in this song goes very well with, and almost echoes the lyrics and vocals. There are some good riffs here, and Chino's proper, melodic singing carries the song's tune well. The bridge is the best part of the song; it has some trippy guitar work with a few half-second pauses and a very little bit of guitar feedback. This song would be a good one to play in the car because, lyrically, it's about getting in your car and driving anywhere-as long as it's far away.<br />\\"Lotion\\" is the heaviest track on the album. Chino really spews his guts and his heart out. The riffs churn heavily, but the yells are even heavier. The main line in this song is \\"I feel sick\\" or \\"feel sickened!\\" I believe him when he says this, because he sure sounds like it.<br />\\"Headup\\" is and my second favorite song on this C.D.. And it features Max Cavalera (of Sepultura fame), so you know this song is going to be very heavy-almost hardcore. The guitars and drums hit very hard, but the main highlight is again the vocals. The beginning is a cool breakdown, the middle has Max and Chino trading off straining their vocal chords, and there is even a nice shout-along in the chorus. The lyrics (like \\"I never got to say goodbye to my boy!\\") lead me to believe Max is upset about the death of his stepson, here. I also believe that Max got the name for his new band, Soulfly, from this song's lyrics.<br /><br />Even though they do melody well and had more success when they added melody, I believe the Deftones were meant to play hard rock/alt metal, and heaviness is what comes naturally to them.\\"Adrenaline,\\" their first album, was very heavy, but, as evidenced by their third album, 2000's \\"White Pony,\\" Chino Moreno and Co. would add melody to their music. Thus, the Deftones' second release, \\"Around the Fur,\\" is sort of a transitional phase for them; it's heavy, yet also somewhat melodic. But even if I'm wrong about the Deftones being a heavy band at heart, I don't think you can deny that \\"Around the Fur\\" is a very good, near great album, and a great inclusion in any hard rock or metal collection. And if you're not a fan of \\"Adrenaline\\" or \\"White Pony,\\" check this album out, anyways.y, but, as evidenced by their third album, 2000's \\"White Pony,\\" Chino Moreno and Co. would add melody to their music.

B0008ISM40|3.0|I was very excited with the new release, and when the album came out I was the first one to pick it up.  The first few listens I really enjoyed what I heard, unfortunately the more I listened to the album the less I enjoyed it.  Maybe I was expecting another Fragile, who knows.  All in all, I regret to say that this was a weak album.
B0007O38F8|1.0|Can aftermath disappoint me anymore? First Eminem drops his worst album ever, by far. Then i get hyped for 50's new release, and he follows by putting out his worst album ever. Get Rich or Die Tryin was a good CD, and power of the dollar was arguably better, but this CD is one of the worst ever put out. Aftermath is all about getting money from the public. G-Unit is about as bad as it gets, and the only ryhmes worth listening to, were the ones i already heard on \\"Get Rich\\". Not to mention Jada squashes the beef he started almost with one line \\"now this is a true fact, since when did it become cool to get shot and not shoot back?\\" I sure as hell dont know, but the publics enfatuation with his bullet wounds are over, and so is the hype behind 50.
B0006A9FMI|1.0|This movie looks amazing.  Great CGI animation and backgrounds.  I only wish I could watch the movie instead of reading the subtitles.

B000002UB3|5.0|Although released before LET IT BE, ABBEY ROAD was the last recorded work of the most important band in rock and roll.  By 1969, The Beatles were on the way out the door, though of course the world didn't know it yet.  Judging by this album, you'd be hard pressed to come to the conclusion that this band was about to break apart, although perhaps \\"The End\\" should have been a clear indicator.  Still, its sentiments, although very hippy in attitude, declares, for all the growing pains and difficult times that America and the UK were going through in the 1960s, showed that people hoped for better times and that love would win over hate. <br /> <br />Early in 1969, the band had recorded the disastrous LET IT BE sessions.  Ultimately, the band left those sessions in the can, shelving the project because of the sheer tension and bad blood.  So when Paul McCartney called George Martin, saying they had another project they wanted to do, naturally it took Martin by surprise.  Martin was rather hurt he had not been asked to produce the LET IT BE sessions, but quickly acquiesced to the band's request.  Luckily for us all, the band put their tensions aside for now and began working on this wholly remarkable LP. <br /> <br />ABBEY ROAD, along with SGT PEPPER, is the most tightly produced, concise record The Beatles ever recorded.  Whether crafting guitar-heavy rock (\\"I Want You,\\" \\"The End,\\" \\"Come Together,\\") devising some of popular music's most esqusite harmonies (\\"Because\\"), doing 1950s send ups (albeit with a late 1960s feel) (\\"Oh Darling\\"), or writing Frank Sinatra's all-time favorite Lennon-McCartney song (\\"Something,\\" which of course is Harrison's baby), ABBEY ROAD pushed the limits and expanded the boundaries of what rock music could do.  The last half of the record, dominated by that suite of half-finished song ideas that Lennon and McCartney had around, shows remarkable ingenuity and a wonderful sense of fun and experimentation. Even Ringo Starr managed to write a song.George Harrison contributed some major music, including the enormous Beatles hit \\"Something,\\" the first for a Harrison song, and the heart wrenching \\"Here Comes the Sun.\\"  Not bad for a band who was having difficulty remaining on speaking terms with each other. <br /> <br />(To those unfamiliar with the Frank Sinatra story, Frank as once asked what his favorite Lennon-McCartney song was.  He said it was \\"Something.\\"  Lennon tells a similar story where he once was serenaded by an adoring musician at a restaurant, dedicating his song specifically to Lennon.  The song turned out to be, of all songs, \\"Yesterday.\\"  Lennon took it in stride, signing his the guy's guitar, saying the guy couldn't really be singing the lyrics to \\"I Am the Walrus\\" for dinner music now, could he?) <br /> <br />ABBEY ROAD's closest spiritual sibling in The Beatles' canon, of course, is SGT PEPPER.  While the other records are undeniably remarkable, both ABBEY ROAD and SGT PEPPER are pure miracles of the recording studio, especially given the state of technology in the late 1960s when these were recorded.  Everything about the production of both LPs is rigidly controlled, with bright, sweeping musical textures and wonderful playing.  Both, more than any other Beatles albums, have a cohesive, instantly engaging sonic identity that unites all the material into a compulsively listenable package.   Both albums totally changed the perception of what rock and roll was limited by, rewriting the rules by which pop music was judged by, though SGT PEPPER perhaps more so simply because of its earlier position in The Beatles' discography.  All the components of great music are here: fantastic song-writing, killer performances, virtuoso playing, remarkable production, gorgeous melodies, endlessly inventive arrangements and production values, and stellar, impeccable music.   <br /> <br />Ultimately, ABBEY ROAD becomes a beautiful swan song to the most remarkable band in popular music.  ABBEY ROAD, like all of The Beatles' best work, shows four musicians at the peak of their powers crafting some of the most remarkable music ever set down on record.  ABBEY ROAD is an immensely accessible, pop-oriented LP that shows that not only was rock and roll alive, it was a vital, vibrant art form that would have tremendous influence on our international cultures.   <br /> <br />And its kick-butt rock and roll to boot.
B0009HLDFU|3.0|(3 3/4 stars) To tell the trut, I only bought this album because it looked interesting, which it is.  The 2 cd concept could've gone up in flames, but it works.  \\"Best of You\\" and \\"In your Honor\\" are the best tracks. They will get stuck in your head. For those of you worried about the copy protection, it wasn't a problem for me.  I use itunes and an ipod on an apple powerbook and it worked just like any other cd would.  This cd is definetly worth a look if you want something interesting.
B000002JK4|3.0|The Principle of Moments saw Robert Plant's solo career on its ascent in the early 80s.  What I like about this album is that Plant's vocals are polished and well produced.  Despite the strange titles - Big Log; Horizontal Departure; Stranger There...and Thru with the Two Step each showcase Plant's vocals post-Zep at his peak.  And on a few tracks, he actually manages to recapture his Zep feel - hitting the high notes (reminiscent of his Zep days) - something he didn't quite do after this album.  Plant's vocal range gets a good workout in this outing -Wreckless Love has a great Zep like ending where Plant lets it out.<br /><br />That would be my recommendation to check this album out.  Apart from that, the instrumentation is somewhat sparse and weaker than his first album - perhaps why the vocals stand out more.  This makes the album hard to rate for me -  I would say 3 and a half stars. Two defining Plant tracks are here: In the Mood and Big Log.  Not sure if he realised it, but Plant's solo strengths were really in singing ballads and softer songs.<br /><br />Get this if you only own Plant's later albums!
B0007TKNL0|5.0|The first time around I got a splitting headache from all that singing (the only musical I'd ever bothered to watch up until then was Grease).  The second time I frowned whenever I listened to Butler hit a high note (kind of like when Carlotta's belting out that song and everybody cringes, yeah like that.) I cringed when he growled, when he screams \\"deep as HELL!\\" oi, I cringed.  The 3rd time I saw it alone without any distractions; I even put on a pair of headphones. I Began to develop a soft spot for the story.  By the time I had to return it I didn't want to.  It grew on me.  The music just stays right in there, until you find yourself humming absentmindedly to it.  Visually, it is exquisite.  The costumes, the set designs (one would think the Phantom and \\"The Haunting's\\" Hugh Crane might have been compadres or something because the O.G.'s lair displays alot of gothic, mid-century decor that resembles that of Hill Houses's).   <br />As for the casting, Minnie Driver's Carlotta acts more like a spoiled little brat than a Diva.  She's great! I'm not complaining, but I'm dissapointed that they had to dub her voice.  Emmy Rossum's Christine is rather young, and naive. <br />Her voice is lovely! she's a lovely Christine but her acting seems to be off-key at times.  Patrick Wilson's Raoul is romantic.  His voice is charming, but the acting as well seems to be off-key very often.  I'd expect these characters to be passionately portrayed, it's not just about the voice. Finally, Gerard Butler's phantom may have dissapointed me with the singing (sometimes), but his acting is superb. He's dark, passionate and seductive. But he's also demented.  Great performance.  The voice isn't quite on par with Michael Crawford's but it works like a charm with most of the women that make up 95% of the audience so...no comment about the looks.  Let's face it, no matter how much his voice strains, he's still great eyecandy, and the women love him. <br /> <br />I was a skeptic (still am), but this film grew on me because of the intense story plot, the music, and Gerard Butler. <br /> <br />One of those 3 usually become major attracting elements with first time viewers.  I recommend it, but you're free to like or dislike it.  I learned to appreciate it despite it's many flaws. <br /> <br /> <br />
B000002B1M|4.0|Nasir Jones' follow up LP to the already classic \\"illmatic\\" was widely succesful. A near classic.    1) Intro - 9/10  2) The message - 10/10 - Nice NY state of mind sample *CLASSIC*  3) Street dreams - 8/10 Not really feeling this one, loved the line \\"I thought Jordans and a gold chain was living it up.\\" Truly street dreams.  4) I Gave You Power - 10/10. JUST WOW... Nas tells a story through the point of view of a gun. This inspired Tupac to make \\"Me and my girlfriend\\"  5) Watch Dem Ninjas - 8/10 -It's alright.   6) Take it Blood - 10/10 Classic  7) Nas is coming - 7/10 - Produced by Dre. The conversation between God's son and dre about squashing the east coast west coast beef gets annoying after a few listens. It takes up over   a minute before the song begins.  8) Affirmative Action - 10/10  9) Set up - 9/10  10) Black girl lost - 10/10 This song was directed towards Carmen (nas's ex who had an affair with Jay-Z)  11) Suspect - 8/10  12) Shootouts - 10/10 *HOT BEAT, HOT LYRICS*  13) Live Ninja Rap - 10/10  14) If I rule the world - 10/10 The best song on the album, lauryn hill on the hook.
B000002N2N|5.0|Please,Please,Please. Remaster,Remaster,Remaster. <br />If any album deserves it, it's this one. The great one from the great ones.
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|I would definitely recommend buying this album.  However, there are few things you shoulkd know first. <br />In this album Serj is not leading as strongly as before.  This makes you miss his lovely and smart tunes sometimes.  Politically, this album's songs have a good point.  Being sarcastic about what happens in the world today , yet , telling every one what exactly is wrong with us is just what people are pleased to hear. <br /> <br />The bad things about Mezmerize is that it gets you lost sometimes in the middle of a thought.  Maybe the fact that Serj is not always there helps that.. but in conclusion, the songs are just not as KILLING as the ones in Toxicity- the album made me  become a SOAD fan. Only this time I enjoyed listening to them for MOST of the time and not all. <br /> <br />Line bottom is: Buy this album, but don't expect another Toxicity.
0385512058|4.0|Once you begin reading this book you will be captivated by the super easy principles outlined in each short chapter.  Unfortunately about three-fourths of the way through things seem to bog down a little.  As you near the end it seems like the author is trying to convince you he knows a vast number of people by referring to his large database and vast contact sheets.  I am sure he is super connected, but the ideas seem to become redundant as the book winds down.  Overall, though, I have to say that it is a good book and a good read.  I have already been referring it to my associates and partners.
B0002Z1EG2|4.0|Most greatest hits collections go in chronological order from oldest to newest. It's different how Shania's Greatest hits disc starts with those from her newest CD (UP!) and go backwards in her career to the Woman in Me days, and then wrapping up with the previously unreleased songs. This is a great CD to listen to out on my boat on a sunny day. I'm mostly a really big fan of the upbeat songs like \\"You Win My Love\\", \\"That Don't Impress Me Much\\", \\"Who's Bed Have Your Boots Been Under\\" and \\"Up\\", but no one sings a ballad quite like Shania, especially \\"Forever and Always\\" and \\"From This Moment\\". There's definitely not a weak song in the bunch, I like both versions of \\"Party for Two\\", it makes me wanna dance and sing. Excellent collection for sure
0670033375|5.0|I love this book.  It's amazing how Diamond could make the plant life, etc., of 900 A.D. seem interesting, but he does repeatedly.  I can hardly put it down--literally.   <br /> <br />His treatment of the Anasazis, Vikings, and especially the Rwandans is some of the best reading I've enjoyed. <br /> <br />In my opinion, it's every bit as good as Guns, Germs & Steel and The Third Chimpanzee.
0385335482|5.0|Oh what a tangled web we weave when once we practice to spend, spend, spend! Yes, Becky has a shopping addiction and yes, she is a bit naive at times, but she is so sweet and always has the best intentions. You can't help but love her. And you'll love all the other characters in the story as well, especially dreamy Luke. I read this book in two days, and I will definitely be reading it again. I've already read the next installment and can't wait to read the third and fourth!
B000002WYT|5.0|This album is great it just has a few songs that don't live up to any of dmb's past works.

B00005PJ6M|3.0|Funny, Original, and non-heinus components come together to create Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey. <br /> <br />It's a little slow for my liking, but the \\"eternities\\" more than make up for any slow parts. A fun movie to rent, but I wouldn't buy it unless you've seen it before. Good for a lot of good laughs when you've got nothing to do.
B00092ZMDY|4.0|This is a really strong concert presentation.  The inclusion of solo material is nice since they don't tour so often individually anymore.  Joe Walsh's tunes add a bit of rock 'n' roll that balances things nicely.  The new tunes are strong, and Glenn's is the best I've heard from him in many years.  Other reviewers note that the \\"new guy\\" (Steuart Smith) is \\"almost as good as Don Felder,\\" but frankly he's much, much better.  The band can finally do justice to both the later, rocking material and the earlier, Bernie Leadon stuff.  Smith is fantastic and his solos are a real highlight.   <br /> <br />
B00001SIES|5.0|What a great Cd. first of all those thom yorke and radiohead comparisons are so silly. yeah matt bellamy does sound like thom yorkes clone at time and yes they hired the same producer radiohead had on the bends with john leckie, but its mainly because muse ADMITS that radioheads albums did something for guitar music that one can't help but be influenced by. ok there thats enough of that argument thank you. unlike their next two albums, this one is just a less serious affair. this album is not so thematically inclined like absolution and origin. i dont like those as much as showbiz because this is just the perfect soundtrack to teenage agression from a teenager(matt bellamy) exiting teenagerdom. i find his songwriting needs a lot of helo here, but there are moments where he really outdoes himself. the music is extraodrinadry with songs like muscle museum and sunburn really kicking ass. what a great record from start to finish, with only one down point and that is falling down, which really sucks...but this album is fun and interesting. uno is such a fun salsa rocker and filip is utterly danceable. cave is a great song as well. showbiz has very simple guitar riffs and some soloing that would leaving you breathless and even the straight ahead songs like escape are really quite good. in short, if you're put off by the radiohead comparision, well you're an idiot. wouldn't we want more great music that sounds as amazing as radiohead anyway? well i have to say this album is a great one and full of big hooks and catchy melodies. its no suprise that this would be the album which launched the muse dynasty. long live matt bellamy and err ok...
B00006WKSZ|3.0|I just recently purchased this album and much too my disappointment Polar Nights was not on the playlist. I have been a huge Scorpion Fan for the past 30 years but talk about being letdown. Polar Nights is truly a classic song that featured Uli Jon Roth's great writing and gutiar skills. It is very hard to listen to this CD based on the fact that Polar Nights is missing on this CD. Thank God for vinyl, I had to crank up the old turntable to get my fix of Polar Nights tonight......... <br /> <br />HS
B00005JNSK|5.0|If you're anything like me, you grew up on the 1971 movie Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory, starring Gene Wilder. And, like me, you may have been more than a little skeptical when you first heard rumors about a remake starring Johnny Depp. But when I heard that Tim Burton-the man responsible for many magical, whimsical films (most recently, Big Fish)-was going to be directing, my negative thoughts blew out the window. I knew I could trust him with this one.     And boy, was I right. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is, hands-down, one of the best movies I've seen all year. The original story by Roald Dahl is well-known to children and adults alike: A mysterious candy-maker named Willy Wonka announces that he's re-opening his chocolate factory after being closed for many, many years. But he's not opening the factory to the general public-only to a few select people. These people will be chosen by a contest-five golden tickets are hidden inside Wonka bars and shipped to different parts of the world. The five \\"golden ticket\\" winners and their guests are allowed into the factory for one day.     The first four tickets are found by nasty, greedy, and generally unlikable children. But the fifth ticket is found by a sweet boy from a poor family named Charlie, and it's his story that we follow throughout the movie.     I really enjoyed this version, and I actually prefer it to the 1971 version. Tim Burton was undoubtedly the perfect choice for director, and this adaptation turned out to be much truer to the original novel. The \\"look\\" that Burton gives his locations and characters is so consistent with the book that many of the characters actually look like they just stepped out of the pages of a Roald Dahl novel.     Johnny Depp is hilarious as the peculiar candy maker Willy Wonka, and all of the children turn out outstanding performances-especially young Freddie Highmore, who plays Charlie. The plot moves quickly, peppered with high-energy, show-stopping numbers with the Oompa-Loompas. And Danny Elfman's musical score complements the movie brilliantly. There was a tiring subplot involving Willy Wonka's father that I could have done without, but other than that, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory gets two thumbs way, way up.
B0007Y08IS|1.0|I bought this DVD thinking it was a satire of action movies with the potentially hilarious gimmick of using marionettes. The first part was actually done very well and was funny in parts, especially the way-over-the-top sex scene. But it became more and more clear that the pretext of comedy was really a front for election year right-wing propaganda.  <br /> <br />The essence of comedy is exaggerating the truth. But this fraudulent comedy exaggerates lies. That's the difference between free speech and propaganda. This is propaganda. <br /> <br />In particular, individual film stars and directors who campaigned against Bush were dishonestly characterized, and basically lied about. These jerks were portraying anti-Bush campaigners as pro-terrorist and pro-North Korea. This is simply trying to put over a lie, masquerading as satire. NO Bush supporters were even mentioned, no less lampooned. I hope all of the misrepresented people are suing these lying writers' butts off. This is like something that PRAVDA or TASS would have produced during the Soviet era. I popped and trashed the DVD even before it was over. I WANT MY MONEY BACK.  <br /> <br />If you feel patriotic toward the USA, DON'T feed this kind of lying political poison, passed off as comedy, by buying this DVD.
B000001E8P|5.0|this album is something that i must say is amazing. its full of intersting noises and thoughts on life. yes common people has to be the greatest working class anthem ever. jarvis cocker writes tales of british life throught the eyes of a jaded being who wants to hope so much. theres a lot to love here disco 2000 is a catchy as hell affair and of course common people will leave you rollicking. jarvis affected the squeeky sunth pop noises when he was doing earlier albums and it all comes to a head here where everything seems unique. i like this record...you better like it
B00005JNJT|4.0|Like &#34;Spiderman 2,&#34; &#34;Batman Begins&#34; goes into the psyche of the protagonist. If you want immediate action, or a simple &#34;go take out the bad guys&#34; movie, you won't be happy with this one.<br /><br />I love a good vs. evil movie, the kind where the good guy learns of a caper, chases down the bad guy, hits him around a few times when the bad guy tries to get away. &#34;Batman Begins&#34; is not about chasing bad guys. It is about Bruce Wayne, and why and how he became the Caped Crusader.<br /><br />If outlined, it might come across like other super hero movies. The strength of the movie is how it reaches into the details, and how the story is told.<br /><br />Fans of Batman in the comics, and followers of the movie series know the origin story. Bruce's parents are killed when he is a child, and he determines to bring justice through training and by using his parents' vast fortune to provide him the tools he needs. The story is the same.<br /><br />Why tell an old story again? Because all we have ever have been given was an outline -- we want more. The years between Bruce's parent's death and when he first wore the cape in Gotham City have always been a mystery.<br /><br />How did he train? What fueled his intensity? How did he get the uniform? Why bats? How did he get the bat cave? If he is just a human, why don't bullets kill him? All of these questions and more are answered in a satisfying way, and hopefully will inspire deeper super hero movies.<br /><br />Parts of the plot are confusing, like the Scare Crow's persona. Kids might not make the connection psychologically. Younger kids might have trouble with the drug-induced hallucinogenic episodes meant to scare the victims. If they can handle the old &#34;Willie Wonka&#34; movie, this should be OK.<br /><br />It doesn't get a perfect grade only because I had trouble believing that this very human Bruce Wayne could adapt as quickly as he did to the special machinery and vehicles, and learn to fight in the mountains so adeptly in what seemed just a few months. The difference between Batman and Superman has always been the humanity of Wayne. Occasionally, the movie stretched this a step too far. Ignore a few of those scenes, and you'll enjoy &#34;Batman Begins.&#34;<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />AmericanSpeechwriter.come difference between Batman and Superman has always been the humanity of Wayne.

0425152251|2.0|Sophie's World seens a great book for those who understand nothing about philosophy. There are many mistakes in it. E.g.: <br />Jostein Gaarder shows Hume as a radical sceptic. But, in truth, Hume is an empiricist that do a sceptical inquiry to determine the frontiers of human's knowledge.  <br />And it's much tendentious. What can I say about a book that pretend to show the History of Philosophy and has a lot of pages talking about Jesus Christ and only one paragraph about Nietzsche, the greatest christianism critic? <br />
B000A88F22|5.0|I think that Chaotic is a reality show to the truest form.  It's not staged like other reality shows, it's just Britney and Kevin being very candid with each other and that's what makes it so enjoyable because you see them for how they really are.  Before this show I really didn't think much of their relationship, I thought he was a loser, but after seeing this show and the genuine love they actually have for each other it's evident to see that he's not just some guy looking for free money, he really cares about her and loves her and I think that's great.  While people may try and bring them down I have great respect and admiration for the two of them to just do what they want and not care what people say.  Also, the video \\"Someday I Will Understand\\" in the finale of the show is probably one of the best videos Britney has ever done, it's very grown up and is a great step in the right direction for Britney to move from being a simple teen star to being a strong woman in the business.
B00082IJ08|5.0|Whoever wrote the review with the title \\"BEEN DONE BEFORE\\" on June, the 23rd, should definetly be either flogged to death or at least forced to justify himself. To say that the Gorillaz produced a rip off of The Dark Side of the Moon (which I love dearly) is an insult to the Gorillaz and Pink Floyd alike. The albums bear no resemblance whatsoever. The Dark Side of the Moon has no bass-percussion-driven tracks at all and has no modern hip-hop elements (note early 70's production label on Dark Side of the Moon). The only resemblance is in the mood, and I can find no justification to call something a cheap rip-off based on mood. That would be like filing a lawsuit against someone because they felt the same way about... I don't know... GOVERNMENT as you! <br /> <br />But, enough of the bashing; Gorillaz is awesome, to lay it blandly. Like what so many bands go for, this album is an experience, and takes you on a smooth journey through several feelings and moods. It zooms deftly in and out of the highs and lows. If a truly inspiring and thoughtful experience is what you look for in an album, then look no further than this CD. <br /> <br />If you need me to say more to convince you to buy this album, you, my friends, are a tough audience indeed. <br /> <br />By the way, I highly reccomend (not to say every track isn't great in its own way, of course) Feel Good Inc. and DARE.
B000002GQH|5.0|At least that's what Justin Hayward says in the new liner notes that they could have just as easily titled their 1969 album. \\"That's what the music meant to us. We wanted to collect religious and psychedelic influences onto an album and turn them into a pathway of enlightenment.\\"<br /><br />That might be asking a lot of any album, but ON THE THRESHOLD OF A DREAM continues the magical blend of the Moodies glorious harmonies and grandiose themes. Gone, however, are the eastern influences of the previous album.  You'll find no sitars or tablas on this album.<br /><br />The album topped the UK chart for two weeks and peaked at No. 20 in the U.S. where it would stay on the charts for a whopping 136 weeks. The single \\"Never Comes the Day,\\" however, would barely crack the Hot 100 where it stalled at No. 91. But the Moodies were an album band, and this is perhaps their best.  There is not a weak track on the album, which culminates with the majestic Mike Pinder medley \\"Have You Heard (Part 1)\\"/\\"The Voyage\\"/\\"Have You Heard (Part 2).\\"<br /><br />My only disappointment with this remastered edition is that it does not include a replica of the original 12-page booklet of lyrics and liner notes included in the 1969 vinyl pressings of this album. The CD booklet does, however, replicate the photos from the original gatefold album jacket.  Any of the Moodies seven albums beginning with DAYS OF FUTURE PASSED are worth owning, but this one is essential for the serious fan.  [Running Time - 37:06] VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
0385338686|4.0|Samantha Sweeting is a workaholic and that's an understatement! She is on the verge of going partner but a debacle occurs and things swift for her career. She finds herself in the countryside working as a housekeeper and she can only make toast and coffee! The characters are well defined and there are several funny passages but overall, it's a cookie-cutter story of a career girl turned domestic. I liked it but was a wee disappointed it wasn't as good as her last two books. Pick it up for a fun beach read though.
B0000025DV|5.0|It can not be overstated how big ELO were in the 70's & \\"A New worlds Record, Out of the Blue & Discovery\\" did it for them. In my opinion \\"Out of the Blue is there greatest. I cannot explain the Joy, this album gives me everytime I here it. I bought the LP back in 1977 & in 2004 had not heard the album for about 22 years. I thought the CD version would sound tired & dated but No!!. This Album sounds even fresher that it did originally. The use of those amazing Analog keyboard and Synth sounds are priceless.  Why can't bands record albums like this,these days with every song a classic, no fillers here.
B00000J2SO|5.0|This is what i consider to be Rainbow's finest album, and one of Ritchie Blackmore's best preformances in his career, and yes that includes his work with Deep Purple. People need to stop ripping on this album and REALLY give it a listen, there were a lot of harsh reviews for 'Down To Earth', either people were complaining about Bonnett's voice or didn't like the AOR style rock sound of the album. <br /> <br />It is not easy when one of your most important band members leaves the fold, it often will spell doom for the band unless they are willing to change and move on in a new direction musically. When Ronnie James Dio left to hook up with Iommi and Co, it would have been impossible for Rainbow to countiue on with what it had done in the past without Dio (i.e. fantasy/D&D style metal), so i don't know why every one got all upset over the pop-metal style of 'Down To Earth', Blackmore already had intentions of making Rainbow into more of a mainstream hard rock act anyway. Bonnett was the perfect choice to be the next vocalist, Rainbow had a new sound now and this album was a breath of fresh air. Graham Bonnett has to be the most underrated voice in rock, despite his inability to write serious lyrics (this would be a problem for Bonnett in future bands like MSG), he has got a powerful, soulful voice unlike anyone else i have heard from. It might be considered blasphemy to some, but i feel that THIS was the best Rainbow line-up because of the addition of Bonnett's lungs and Don Airely, who does some amazing keyboard work on songs like \\"Eyes of the World\\" and \\"Lost in Hollywood\\". <br /> <br />Too bad this was the only output from this lineup, while Joe Lynn Turner was good, but he was nothing compared to Graham Bonnett. Besides, this is still a hard rock album with a slight pop edge as opposed to the next album ('Difficult To Cure') which was a pop album with a slight hard rock edge. People need to calm down on this album and give credit where it is due.  <br /> <br />ALLNIGHT LONG    9/10 <br />EYES OF THE WORLD 10/10 <br />NO TIME TO LOSE   8/10 <br />MAKIN LOVE        9/10 <br />SINCE YOU BEEN GONE 9/10 <br />LOVES NO FREIND    7/10 <br />DANGER ZONE        8/10 <br />LOST IN JOLLYWOOD  10/10 <br /> <br />This is one of the most underrated hard rock albums ever put out, \\"Since You Been Gone\\" might have been the hit single here, but there are a lot of buried gems on this album, infact the only real filler i can think of would be \\"Loves No Freind\\". Glover's Production is pretty good as well. As much as i love Dio and anything Dio related, i gotta list this as the pinnacle of Rainbow's career...sorry Ronnie.     <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0007CNXUU|5.0|I saw all of the candidates for the Oscar, and still feel that Johnny Depp and Finding Neverland should have won in the Best Actor and Best Film categories.  Depp is probably the most talented and versatile actor in the world today, and the movie was terrific -- a wonderful addition to his brilliant portfolio.  He is in a class by himself.
B00016ZQZW|5.0|This album was a wonderful final tribute to one of the best singers of all time Mr. Freddie Mercury with a 20 minute instrumental and a hidden track at the end.  A great album better than Jazz or the News of the World albums. <br /> <br />I'll miss you you Freddie. The King is dead long live the \\"Queen\\". <br /> <br /> <br />
B0001AVZA8|1.0|What does it take to be a good bad movie?  Lot's of talented people getting together and making every mistake and bad choice possible.    By that criteria \\"Something's Gotta Give\\" is the first movie I've seen in a long time that could give \\"Showgirls\\" a run for its money for best bad movie.  All the elements are here - lots of talent (Nicholson, Keaton, Peet), a boringly predictable plot, and some of the most excrutiating writing I have heard in a major motion picture.  Nicholson is barely acting at all, while Keaton is trying to act, but failing - miserably.  When the best performance in your movie is given by Keanu Reeves, you know something spectactuarly bad has occurred.    My advice - rent this movie, get a bunch of your friends together, get rip-roaring drunk, and a good time will be had by all.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|Just to let you all know first off that the reason that the Vocals are different on this A7X album is the fact that M.Shadows had to have throat surgery to get vocal chords removed due to the fact that the screaming on the first big album (Sounding The Seventh Trumpet) put sores on his throat but yeah this album though the lyrics are greatly changed is still an awsome album he sounds alot diffrent in concert singing these songs than he does on the album he is awsome. This band is the best metal hardcore band around now besides Metallica of course A7X is awsome and I dont care what anyone says the best song on the album is Betrayed I give it a 10/10 individual song ratings are as followed. <br /> <br />1. Beast and The Harlot (8/10) <br />2. Burn It Down (6/10) <br />3. Blinded In Chains (7/10) <br />4. Bat Country (9/10) <br />5. Trashed and Scattered (8/10) <br />6. Seize The Day (7/10) <br />7. Sidewinder (8/10) <br />8. The Wicked End (8/10) <br />9. Strength Of The World (9/10) <br />10. Betrayed (10/10) <br />11. M.I.A. (8/10) <br /> <br />The Guitar riffs are still awsome Zachy Vengence and Sinister Gates keep up the great work there Johnny Christ on the bass still awsome but what I want to know what happened to The Rev. on this album drums arent nearly as strong as they are on Waken The Fallen which is there best album by far but yeah that is not the point this album is not as bad as some of these people have been saying it is it is still the same old Avenged Sevenfold strong and hard all the way to the end.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|I think that now days it is very hard to find something you would like, especially when it comes to music. There are so many artists and genres to choose from, it sometimes, becomes difficult to satisfy your ear. However, if you are into t.A.T.u., satisfaction is all the way. When I heard that two sexy \\"lesbian\\" girls imported from Russia where trying to conquer the U.S. I became intrigued on how good and different their music would sound, and up to this date they have kept my ears satisfied.    Their first album, \\"200 km/h In The Wrong Lane\\", gathers 11 songs, all with different sounds, lyrics, meanings, and even languages. The album has 3 powerful singles, \\"All The Things She Said\\", \\"Not Gonna Get Us\\", and a cover from \\"The Smiths\\" - \\"How Soon Is Now?\\". The first two are very different, but powerful in both their catchy lyrics and rhythms. \\"All The Things She Said\\" is t.A.T.u.'s biggest hit to date, and how can it not be, it tells the story of two girls, both being madly in love with each other, but driven crazy due to peoples looks, thoughts and actions. This song is probably one of the biggest highlights of the record, and a worth buying the album for. \\"Not Gonna Get Us\\" and \\"How Soon Is Now?\\" manage to be great singles.  \\"Not Gonna Get Us\\" with that catchy \\"they're not gonna get us\\" and \\"How Soon Is Now?\\"  being a great cover.     Then we have the never released singles \\"Show Me Love\\" and \\"30 Minutes\\". Both were thought to be released as singles, but never made it. In my opinion these two would have been great singles. \\"Show Me Love\\" with the catchy chorus and the Extended Edition for those who love the song and \\"30 Minutes\\", that lovely ballad that we all love. The songs that follow, \\"Clowns (Can you See Me Now?)\\", \\"Malchik Gay\\", \\"Stars\\" and the Russian version of both \\"All The Things She Said\\" and \\"Not Gonna Get Us\\" make the album get to a level where you find a little bit of everything: the dark lyrics of Clowns, the Euro/Pop/Dance sexy sound of Malchik Gay,and the Russian/English combination of Stars. For the finishing touch we have the irresistible \\"Ya Soshle S Uma\\" and \\"Nas Ne Dagoniat\\" both sang on the girl's native language.    These girls are making me crave for more; it is simply a guilty pleasure. Even the \\"lesbian\\" gimmick does not matter any more, just that these sexy girls with powerful voices from a far away country, bring great music to our ears. Believe me, once you're into them there is no turning back.
B000084T18|1.0|This is music for little kids who like to be told what's cool by MTV and other crappy corporate conglomerates. This is just another fad that will disappear just like that other fad Ja Fool. You want real rap that actually enligtens? Check out, Talib Kweli, del, techn9ne, The Roots, Mad Skillz etc. Todays mainstream rap music sucks badly. Go back to the roots of rap and you'll see that back then rap was infinitely better. Cypress Hill, Rakim, Ice Cube, Dr Dre, NWA, Public Enemy, De La Soul, The Pharcyde, Pac, B.I.G, Beastie Boys, Run-DMC, etc. You get my drift.
B0007Z4S4C|5.0|I can't get enough of this album.  Plant finally connects to his Zeppelin roots with a new flair, unapologetic hard core blues with some world influences that transcends time.  On some level I almost think this is what Zeppelin could have sounded like today.  The addition of Strange Sensation roots in Massive Attack and Portishead makes this a near perfect collaboration, and approachable for those who bought with disappointment some of his previous forays.  Tracks 4, 10 and the bonus track at the end should be played over and over, and LOUD.  Very much worth the purchase.

B00005JLWN|5.0|Why was this movie so universally loathed among critics?  (Well, not quite-Roger Ebert once again shows he has taste.)  Equilibrium is every bit The Matrix's equal when it comes to action, and it packs an even greater emotional punch than that much-lauded film.  Christian Bale plays John Preston, a cleric of the new order of mankind-an oppressive dictatorship that, by mandate of \\"The Father\\", forces citizens to take emotion-killing drugs.  Violators, or \\"sense offenders\\", are punished by death, so it's hard to blame the zombie legions for taking their medicine every day.  At first glance, Preston appears to be a villain, but little by little he comes to rediscover what it is to experience emotion.  This leads him to seriously question his loyalties.  Rather than lazily run on autopilot, the movie is unpredictable, subtle, and tense. It is full of delightfully clever little touches; Bale's Mona Lisa smile was too perfect, as was the little boy telling his sister not to play with her cereal-you'll see what I mean.  Equilibrium is a movie that separates the jaded critics from those who still know what a classic feels like.  Batman Begins was good, but this in my opinion is Christian Bale's finest hour.
B0002NRQTS|3.0|Try to imagine RUSH taking a five year break between the \\"Hold Your Fire\\" and \\"Roll The Bones\\" albums and offering their fans a collection of their favorite elevator music... <br /> <br />That's what the \\"Presto\\" album feels like.  I mean, it's RUSH, so it's not bad music, but this is definately their weakest album in their entire career.  There's not one song here you'll want to crank up or drive faster to (Okay, that's what I like to do to their music).

B00005OWEG|4.0|APOCOLYPSE NOW is a monumental war film, spectacularly filmed by Francis Ford Coppola, in any version. <br /> <br />However, when this \\"redone\\" version was released in 2001, all it really did was provide me with the opportunity to see this film on screen for the first time, as I was too young to see it in 1979. <br />With the exception of THE ABYSS and RETURN OF THE JEDI, alternate and special editions of movies have never sat right with me.; like colorizing black and white movies.  As a film purist, I believe there's usually a reason film are made the way they are the first time around. <br />The footage that's been restored here only serves to make the film much longer, and before you know it, you're watching the \\"Heaven's Gate\\" version of a film you already loved. <br /> <br />It's APOCOLYPSE NOW!  It's always great!  Own it on DVD, but buy the original 1979 version!
0735619670|5.0|I haven't read all too many books on general programming professional development, yet I can confidently say that every serious developer needs this book. <br /> <br />There might be a tiny percentage of developers out there who could read the entire book and say they were already familiar with all the best practices within, but you're not one of them.  Even if you're familiar with most of them, it's good to have them all in one book (some will serve as confirmation of something you've merely suspected to be good practice). <br /> <br />The bibliography is massive; including every work of note in the field.  The references to such good works are sprinkled evenly throughout each chapter.  This makes for a distillation of nearly 50 years of the best works in the field! <br /> <br />As the book says, the dedicated professional will continually build his/her craft, but I'd bet if you read only this book and consistently follow it's suggestions, you'll have a stellar career. <br /> <br />The focus is on actual code construction, but it touches on every aspect of software engineering including psychology/behavior. <br /> <br />Buy w/o hesitation.
0783231032|4.0|This was Spielberg's one time shot at comedy, and you have to give him credit for trying. <br /> <br />1941 is not the funniest film ever made, but it's loud, wild and zany, which makes it a lot of fun to watch.  The opening parody on his own JAWS with Christine Blakely is especially original. <br />What made this film work at the time (1979), I think, was its cast of stars, who were all fresh off of some very popular work at the time, including films like ANIMAL HOUSE, JAWS 2, SUPERMAN, and TV shows like SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE, EIGHT IS ENOUGH and BOSOM BUDDIES. <br /> <br />I loved this movie, even though it bombed.  If nothing else, Spielberg decided to learn from his mistake and not try comedy again.

B00012L786|5.0|That's what the pickpocket Skip asks the cops when they tell him \\"the commies are mixed up in it.\\" \\"It\\" is finding out who's running the Red spy ring trying to get the microfilm with a \\"secret process\\" that Skip lifted from Candy's purse on the subway.<br /><br />The best thing about Pickup on South Street is that it doesn't wave the flag at us. It leaves out the McCarthy Era anticommunist propaganda and sticks to the story. Instead of a larger-than-life FBI man, the hero is a petty criminal. We're not even sure that Skip isn't planning to sell the microfilm to the Reds for twenty-five grand. For writer-director Sam Fuller, the communist spies don't need any more demonizing than the snitch Joey's \\"I just don't like them.\\"<br /><br />But Joey and Skip and Candy don't like cops or feds any more than they like commies. An FBI agent, staking out Skip's place on the waterfront (the sign above Skip's door says he's \\"BAIT\\"), steps out of the shadows to order the New York cops let Skip go so he can lead them to the boss of the spy ring. This government agent is just as creepy the communist mastermind, who of course smokes with an effete cigarette holder.<br /><br />Richard Widmark's portrayal of Skip is right on the edge between his early psycho killer roles and the authority figures he played (Army drill instructor in Take the High Ground, Navy doctor in Panic in the Streets, nuclear sub commander in The Bedford Incident, cop in Madigan.)<br /><br />The way Skip strokes Candy's face (after he's almost broken her jaw with his fist, not knowing who she was when he caught her waiting for him in his hideout in the dark) is one of the most erotic scenes in any fifties movie. (This is just after Jean Peters as Candy asks him, \\"How many times you been caught with your hand where it don't belong?\\")<br /><br />The dialogue in a lot of film noir, especially the movies with bigger stars, is a bad imitation of Raymond Chandler, who's bad enough himself sometimes. (I can barely stand to listen to Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck \\"banter\\" in Double Indemnity - - Chandler co-wrote the script.) But Sam Fuller's dialogue in Pickup on South Street, while stylized, sounds like things human beings would really say.<br /><br />Skip finally fights it out with a communist agent in a subway station under an Army poster that tells us to \\"FIGHT!\\" too (the Korean War is still going on). But in this movie, it doesn't seem like propaganda, it's just what would naturally be there at that time.<br /><br />For a movie where the bad guys are communists, capitalism and American society don't come off so great. One character, who's only trying to scrape enough money together for a decent funeral for when she dies from \\"movie disease,\\" tells a man with a gun that her life is so hard he'd be doing her a favor if he shot her in the head.<br /><br />Skip the pickpocket and Candy (who, the movie hints, has been worse things than an unwitting courier) are at the bottom of the barrel not because of any failings of their own, but because of the bad hand they got dealt. That goes against the individualist free-enterprise philosophy of most Hollywood movies.<br /><br />Thomas Doherty points out in his book Cold War, Cool Medium: Television, McCarthyism, and American Culture that the blacklisters were always more interested in WHO was on the screen (writers or actors with left-wing ties) rather than WHAT was on the screen (the actual messages of the movies).<br /><br />But, as usual in Hollywood, Americanism triumphs in the end.

B0000028RR|5.0|I'm still reeling from reading the words of a particular reviewer who believes the average record buyer is much better off listening to \\"Taproot, Linkin Park, or Limp Bizkit.\\" I'd really like to think that such a ridiculous opinion isn't even worth considering or responding to, but seriously, what the EFF are you thinking?? You don't have to agree with everything the band said, hell, you don't have to agree with ANY of it, but you should be glad that they were one of the few bands in the 90's to have an opinion on something. This isn't artsy music, its meant to bang your head, shake your ass, and move your mind, and it does all of that with a fury.
0425188809|5.0|It's a dangerous and lonely world out there, especially if you have no one on which to rely for companionship and love. You have to seize opportunities and take risks it seems, to be able to find your way to effectively cope through this life on planet earth, and this great story provides a way for us to understand that on several very personal levels and to expand our perception of what being \\"sentient\\" means. It also gives us a contemporary and thought-provoking glimpse at the potential and dangers of producing chimeras (mixing cells of different organisms) through biological research.   <br />  <br />In Watchers, you get to explore the exhilaration when loving souls come together through three main characters: a man, a woman, and a very special dog. They all have had something very important that's been missing in their lives, and through some harrowing and action-packed synchronistic circumstances they bond and begin their newfound lives. But there is something in their future that can unsettle and unhinge their newly formed family roots and possibly destroy them - something unpredictable and evil - and they must look within themselves and to each other to face the challenge. <br /> <br />Along the way, readers will see some elements of international espionage, organized crime, biological warfare, and domestic terrorism, knitted into a tightly-bound, exciting, and ultimately, a family story. <br /> <br />I find myself still thinking about the characters and what they endured in Watchers; how they opened their minds and hearts to forge a better understanding of one another. And I also keep pondering the possibilities and consequences of making animals more human-like. This story gives us just a glimpse of what may turn out to be a great many more unexpected results.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|As Simon Cowell said, \\"Avril Lavigne is the updated version of Britany Spears.\\" And he's right. Teen girls are imperfect, and swaying emotions. (Most) Teen girls are clever and dont go around flaunting the statement \\"I'm not that innocent.\\"(At least not in my world) We are deep and different. This music reflects that. Sometimes we are tough, sometimes we scream out for help. I, unlike a previous reviewer, believe that people are not one sided. You can be tough and vunerable at the same time. I believe that this album is a perfect remedy for a teen girl who is feeling angry at the world. So if you hate Spears, Ashlee/Jessica Simpson, and Jesse McCartney, you will probably love this album.
0743243315|3.0|This lengthy and ambitious first novel explores, with indifferent success, the lives of Bangladeshi immigrants to London and the growth in independence and modification of culture of a young Bangladeshi woman.<br /><br />The heroine of the book is Nazneen who at the age of 20 enters an arranged marriage with Chanu, age 40, a Banladeshi struggling to establish himself in London.  Chanu is striving for a promotion, is proud of his attempts to secure education, and is portrayed at the outset of the book as rather vain and foolish.  Bangladeshi society and traditional Islamic practices are patriarchal by western lights, and much is made of this throughout the book.  Nanzeen and Chanu have a son, who dies as an infant, and two daughters Shahana and Bibi.  Mid-way in the book, with her growth in independence and awareness of her physical and emotional needs, Nanzeen takes a lover, a young man and would-be Islamic radical named Karim.  Nanzeen has a beautiful younger sister, Hasina, who remains in Bangladesh, and writes many letters to her sister in a broken English about the course of her life and its hardships.<br /><br />The book gives a portrait of life of the Bangladeshi immigrant community in London.  I had no prior knowledge of this community.  It describes how the immigrants lived in cramped living conditions in the poorer sections of town with up to ten people per room trying to support themselves in a culture utterly foreign to most of them.  Some of the people work at assimilation while others try to retain their religious and Bangladeshi identity.  Drugs and violence come to plague the community and, of course, the open sexual mores of modern London prove irresistable to many.  The community is shown as divided in its response to the terrorism that has come to dominate world news in recent years.<br /><br />There are a host of well-drawn secondary characters in this novel, including the loan-shark, Mrs. Islam, Nanzeen's lover, named Karim, a friend of Chanu named Dr. Azad, and Razia, a friend of Nanzeen.  These characters give weight and texture to the novel and partly succeed in bringing it to life.<br /><br />The book focuses on Nanzeen's development, and the parallel development of Hasina, as it involves Nanzeen's husband, her lover, and, ultimately her independence.  It also centers upon Chanu's and Nanzeen's differing desires in terms of returning to Bangladesh.<br /><br />I was intrigued by the excellence of the 100-some discussions by my fellow Amazon reviewers and by the wide divergence of considered responses to this book.  Reading the reviews helped me focus upon my own response to the book.  Many reviewers found this novel an outstanding first attempt to describe the immigrant experience of the Bangladeshis and the personal growth of the heroine.  Other readers found the novel vastly overpraised, difficult, and trite.  There is something to be said for both views, but on the whole I agree with the latter opinion.  I was happy to have it reinforced by a substantial group of fellow reviewers.<br /><br />The book does portray eloquently the difficulties of the Bangladeshi immigrant community and provokes reflection on how many individuals, in immigrating to a new land, respond to the various choices of assimilation on the one hand and remaining deeply attached to one's initial identity on the other hand.  Some of the characters in this book are convincingly drawn.  But these are largely the secondary characters, such as Mrs. Islam and Dr. Azad, and also, surprisingly enough, Chanu, Nanzeen's husband.<br /><br />The problems with this book far outweigh its virtues. To begin with, I found it far too long, too slow, and, in many places, dull.  It was an unrelieved chore to finish this book.  The long sections of letters to Nazneen from her sister Hasina break up the story are difficult to read and detract much more than they add.<br /><br />Equally important, the character on whom Ms. Ali lavishes most of her attention, Nazneen, is trite and unconvincing.  I don't think we need another long novel to inform the reader that traditional Islamic society is patriarchal.  At times, both at the beginning and at the end of the story, the book does little more than that.  Portions of the Nanzeen's development show more depth, as Nanzeen learns of her sexuality and also stands up to Mrs. Islam.  But the main theme of the book is predictable and boring and has been done many times in many other contexts.<br /><br />While Nazneen's development shows predictable stereotyping, the author, possibly in spite of herself does a better job with Chanu who for all his faults is a complexly drawn human being deserving of compassion and, perhaps, of a better fate.<br /><br />Thus, in spite of some good moments, I cannot recommend this book due to its length and structure and due to its stereotyped plot line and heroine.  I found it worthwhile to review the comments of my fellow reviewers and to offer my own comments here.<br /><br />Robin Friedmananother long novel to inform the reader that traditional Islamic society is patriarchal.

0743454537|4.0|Overall the style of this book, the storyline, and the plot were outstanding and I'd give them a 5+.  Everyone has been slamming the ending, but I think the ending gives us a lesson that life is unexpected, and out of the blue anything can happen.  Why I gave the book 4 stars is because of the language.  A charming book uses swear words and obscenities to portray the story.  I did not think this is appropriate and I believe authors nowdays need to realize this kind of language does not need to be in their work.  I would have put the book down had it not been for the captivating plot.  I am very offended that such a fluent writer would find it necessary to use this kind of talk in such a beautiful story.  Swear words are used when a better word cannot be thought of and that's the impression this book left on me.  I finished it a week ago and it still irritates me.
B0000009OP|5.0|...what we have here is \\"a little VERY LATE night music\\".<br /><br />This is the CD you put in when the smoke already hangs thick in the air over a felt table and you're breaking the seal over your second bottle of Black Label Jack while playing poker/shooting pool with only your friends of more nefarious (and infinitely more enjoyable) means.<br /><br />Less was never more than when the lights dimmed and the impossibly dark Mark Sandman slung a three (later two)-string bass over his shoulder and led a drummer and saxophonist and a conspicuously absent guitarist into the consciousness of all who dared to believe that a mutated jazz trio could rock as hard as any guitar-slinging grunge band of the era yet still retain the degree of untouchable hipster cool that acts like the Ben Folds Five could only begin to imagine for themselves.<br /><br />Mark Sandman was the Bill Hicks of music; an antiestablishment innovator whose very existence challenged one's beliefs and dared the listener to question all that had previously been assumed as writ; that he died well before his time is all the more tragic, but there is no denying the genius of the artist and the power with which that genius comes across in this, one of the finest albums of the decade.<br /><br />At just over 37 minutes in length (including two sub-two minute instrumentals which serve as intro and closing pieces), this CD seems to parallele Sandman's life; amazingly achieved and far too short.  With tunes ranging from the semi-ambient (\\"In Spite Of Me\\", \\"I'm Free Now\\", \\"Let's Take  Trip Together\\") to the raging aggressive (\\"Buena\\", \\"Thursday\\", \\"Mary Won't You Call My name\\") to all shades of night in-between (\\"All Wrong\\", \\"Candy\\", \\"Sheila\\"), there really isn't a weak link to be found.  While the CD itself runs short, the songs are at the perfect length; most clock in at 3-3.5 minutes so that you are able to sufficiently groove with them before they become tiresome and repititious.  This is songwriting craftsmanship and musical innovation at its highest form, definitely a must-have for any musical collection and the best direction I can recommend for anyone who wants to add a little \\"something different, something cool\\" to their listening enjoyment.craftsmanship and musical innovation at its highest form, definitely a must-have for any musical collection and the best direction I can recommend for anyone who wants to add a little \\"something different, something cool\\" to their listening enjoyment.
1563899426|5.0|For someone who learned to read with a tattered volume of the unexpurgated Grimm's Fairy Tales (in German!), Bill WIllingham's series FABLES (now compiled into a total of six volumes) came as something of a revelation.<br /><br />Thing is, I'm not really a great fan of comics or 'graphic novels'. They are an acquired taste, I think, and I guess I never had a chance to acquire it. Thus may change now. I still don't think I'm ready for much of the genre/medium, but FABLES is in a different class. The 'graphic' aspect is almost movie-like. The pictures and panels are like story-boards with speech bubbles and story-captions and elucidations-supporting a narrative that's at the same time profoundly affectionate and reverent of its antecedents, as it is quirky, twisted and satirical.<br /><br />The very first pages with 'Bigby Wolf' had me laughing out loud.<br /><br />[Sidebar:<br />For those who don't get it: 'Big B Wolf'... We on the same page now?<br />For those who did get it without trouble: believe you me, there ARE those who DON'T get it without explanation, and when you explain it, it's like \\"duh, and so? why are you laughing?\\"]<br /><br />I read the whole thing grinning like a demented chicken; then started from the beginning again; then went and ordered the remaining volumes. For someone who doesn't read 'comics' that's saying something.<br /><br />FABLES has taken fairy tales (all of them, from all periods and places, including our own, modern movie mythologies) into the 21st century, with great affection for their spirit, mix-and-match with abandon and a breezy disrespect for political correctness.<br /><br />The first volume, LEGENDS IN EXILE, introduces the main characters, and some smaller ones that gain prominence in later volumes, in the context of a detective story that could have been lifted from a Raymond Chandler or Mickey Spillane novel. Bigby, the detective and sheriff, is grim and cool and waiting to explode, but a romantic at heart. Snow White, one of Prince Charming's former wives, is a cynical, edgy deputy mayor who hides her vulnerability behind a tough exterior. There's sex and violence, blood and intrigue, laughs and cries, and characters that, outrageous as they may be, grow on you and won't leave you alone.<br /><br />It's story-telling at its best. That I found it in a 'comic'... I'm still reeling from the surprise.<br /><br />Till Noever, owlglass.com, Author: KEAEN, CONTINUITY SLIP, SELADIENNAedgy deputy mayor who hides her vulnerability behind a tough exterior.

0930289234|5.0|Scanning the reviews it became aparent that people either love the Watchmen by Alan Moore, or they hate it. The common thread found in the negative reviews was that they had heard alot about it and decided to give it a look, expecting it to blow their minds away. This mindset will only work against any possible enjoyment which may be gleaned from this work, since it is in the small details that make the Watchmen such a fascinating deconstruction of the medium (sequential art) and it's typical subject matter (super hereo's). None of these 'loser' superheroes are superhuman save for one (a god-like character whom is disinterested in human affairs), but deeply flawed human beings that need to dress up in a costume as much as someone \\"needs a beer,\\" or coffee, or a smoke. This is a character based/driven narrative with numerous threads that seem only losely conected until the final panel. It is highly political in the undertow of it's narrative flow, but is concerned less with what political figures and events are depicted and more with the themes revolving around them; less an attempt at prophecy and more of a what if? Much of this is accomplished with the layout and art, which isn't flashy or visceral like fellow comic books. Dave Gibbons acheives much more by stripping it down to the basics describing tone not through line work but through choice of color palette achieving  a subtlty not unlike a Kubrick film. The people that wrote positive reviews, seem to get this in varying degrees, my sugestion is to read this book more as a study then as pure candy flossed entertainment. You still may not love it, but at least you'll have an understanding for why it is so respected.
B0006399FS|5.0|U2 has overcome the critics once more by storming onto the charts with their newest album \\"How To Dismantle an Atomic Bomb.\\" Original lyrics; inventive songs; great overall quality.
B0001NBMBC|3.0|what happened to the slipknot we all knew and loved...seriously this cd is way way too mainstream, this is nothing more than a another case of the industry making a good band change good musik for profit. they werent about money at first it was all about the maggots!! the true maggots who loved them since MKFR not these kids that listen to kelly clarkson and then listen to \\"duality\\" and think that theyre goths or punks or whatever... the chaotic melodies dont make it to this album...its too f#$kin' soft!!!!!!!!
B0006L16N8|3.0|Ok, let me clear som things up. Coldplay is NOT U2. They are not even close to U2's level. U2 has tried all different types of music, the anger of 'War' the beauty of 'Joshua Tree' and then tearing it all down and rebuilding a new sound with 'Achtung Baby'. Coldplay has done none of that.  <br /> <br />Coldplay is NOT Radiohead either. I must say, Radiohead is one of my favorite bands of all time. What makes Coldplay different from them is thier sound. Chris's voice just doesnt match the haunting, colorful voice of Thom Yorke. Also, Radiohead tends to \\"rock\\" a lot more than Coldplay. Honestly, go listen to 'Just' or '2+2=5' by Radiohead and then switch to a Coldplay CD. You will know what I'm talking about. <br /> <br />But what Coldplay is, is a band with a distintive sound. Coldplay does make good music, I cannot deny that. On this CD, 'White Shadows', 'Speed of Sound', 'X&Y', and \\"Fix You' are the highlights.  <br /> <br />Coldplay is a very good band that stands out among the rap and other things that are permeating our culture these days. But what makes them just average is the fact that they wont evole out of the first sound they created. I mean, U2 followed up the success of 'Joshua Tree' with 'Achtung Baby', and Radiohead followed up 'OK Computer' with 'Kid A'. These albums changed the band's sound and how they were viewed, but they helped the band to evole into something even greater. I fear that if Coldplay keeps the same sound in its next CD, people may lose interest in them. And that would mean the loss of a great up-and-coming band.
B0006L5RT2|5.0|A talented musician who has produced a brilliant debut CD. Highly recommended
B00005JNJT|5.0|I generally think movies are far too overpriced so I generally wait for DVD, but I'm glad I didn't wait on this one.  This film is what the \\"Batman\\" series has been waiting for: a good solid foundation on which all of the crazies and the politics are based. <br /> <br />I've never really truly understood the plight of Bruce Wayne. Poor rich baby.  However, this film not only goes way back to show exactly what happened with his parents, but also chooses not to neglect the road he had to travel to become the caped crusader.  I thought the screenplay, the script, was excellent because it told the story as a novel would, fleshing out necessary characters and giving the audience their motivation as well.  I thought it was great to see where Comissioner Gordon started out and how Gotham became the center of all corruption. <br /> <br />I thought the movie did two things really well: get to the heart of the problem in Gotham through the hero/villain that Liam Neeson played with such expertise (he was trained well in Star Wars) AND cast Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne.  Finally a guy who can pull off the drama and the action and still maintain a somewhat \\"upper crust\\" feel that is so necessary to this character. <br /> <br />If the casting in this movie(minus Katie Holmes who was enthusiastically average as the do-gooder-slash-supposed-love-interest) had been present throughout all of the sadly misguided versions of Batman movies over the years, the sum would be classic.  As it is, they do make up for the horror of Chris O'Donnell and Alicia Silverstone as Robin and Batgirl.  And that's bringing us back a long, long way. <br /> <br />Kudos on this one.  I'm definitely buying it on DVD.
B0009HLDFU|5.0|I love this album. I'm not a usual Foo Fighters fan but I do love this album a lot. I think you will too.
B000002JSN|5.0|\\"Phyiscal Graffiti\\" is, in my mind, the mightiest album Led Zeppelin ever produced. I'll admit I prefer hard rock over pop, but I did enjoy the folkiness of \\"Led Zeppelin III.\\" But \\"Physical Graffiti\\" reigns supreme above them all, even \\"IV.\\" <br />Firstly, this is worth buying just to hear the thundering riff of \\"Kashmir.\\" It's a sick riff, and parts of the song have a unique, Middle Eastern sound. Jimmy Page may be the greatest guitarist ever, and he really shows his talent on this album. The album ain't all hard rock, either. \\"Down By The Seaside\\" has a nice airy feel to it, and the acoustic \\"Bron-Yr-Aur\\" is quite soothing. \\"Boogie With Stu\\" has a catchy beat, and \\"Wanton Song\\" has a crazy, off-the-wall riff to boot. John Bonham's drumming is never better, and Plant's shrill vocals do not do Page's guitarwork justice. All their contributions are perfectly balanced on every track; the only one that didn't turn my head was \\"Black Country Woman.\\" <br />Definitely check out \\"Physical Graffiti.\\" Of course, if you're already a Zeppelin fan, you know just how great this album is. Zeppelin gave us 14 out of 15 tracks that I consider excellent, and that's certainly no easy feat.

0156027321|5.0|This book is thoroughly enjoyable.  It's a witty story encompassing religions, philosophy, survival, instinct, and best of all, a truly vivid imagination.  The story is full of spectacular imagery that pulls the reader into the boat with Pi and the tiger.  This is a book I will read over and over.
B0009A1AS2|3.0|Octavarium isn't a bad album (3.5 stars to be exact), but just ponder for a bit what could be.  This band is long overdue for a lineup change.  Portnoy has DT by the jugular and needs to be cut loose if this band is ever going to be worth paying any attention to again.  Offer the job to Virgil Donati, Mark Zonder, Craig Okraska, Flo Mounier or anyone else that won't strong arm the outfit.  Next, say goodbye to Rudess.  Something that has always kept DT's head above the water is their constant turnover on the keys every other album.  Yep, Rudess is amazing as is Portnoy, but both these guys have done nothing but leave DT dry and stale (on the last two albums that is).  Rudess should have been replaced after 6DOIT.  Finally, say bye to James!!  DT's music doesn't fit James voice anymore, and in my humble opinion, James has lost what talent he used to have.  Yeah, maybe in the studio he is able to pull it off, but performing live is another story.  If Dream Theater really wants to progress and fans really want something fresh, they'll call for Jame's resignation and replacement with none other than Devin Townsend!  That's right, beautiful clean and death vocals, and dare I say. . . Dream Theater's second guitar player!  Don't worry; he can do a Geddy Lee thing on the keys.  Now there is a DT lineup . . . as a quartette: Petrucci, Myung, Donati and Townsend.  Yep, Devin would certainly keep the rest of the guys from peeing sitting down (as they are now). The only other guy I'd consider as a replacement for LaBrie would be King Diamond; a collaboration to behold!  I know, to all you neutered Dream Theater fans (don't cry, I'm one too) this is sacrilegious, but see, you start thinking of ideas like this once you get beyond Dream Theater and start realizing there are other Progressive Metal bands out there just as good if not better.  The reason most of you don't realize this is because you're afraid, afraid to actually open your ears and expose yourself to other bands that could possibly dethrone your precious deified prog gods.  Oh, how dare I speak this way . . . after all, I am a fan.  I own every album and side project release as well as the Majesty demos and the cover projects, but if you want something new and original, something actually worth your time and money, go check out Redemption's The Fullness of Time, Into Eternity's Buried in Oblivion, Ark's Burn the Sun, Extol's Synergy, Andromeda's II=I, Zero Hour's The Towers of Avarice or any album by Symphony X.  It is going to be great to see Megadeth and Symphony X on the Gigantour!!!!  Oh yeah, Dream Theater too!
B0006MT314|5.0|This is my first time reviewing a cd! Anyways, One Tree HIll has been my favourite show for a while now; and a big reason for that is because the music is really good and fits so well with the scenes. The show always showcases the talents of new / unknowns, such as Gavin deGraw and Tyler Hilton. Over the 2 yrs I think I've downloaded 20 or 30 songs from one tree hill! If you like the music on the show, you will DEFNINITELY enjoy the cd! I especially recommend &quot;When the stars go blue&quot;, and if you like the Jimmy eat world, Tyler Hilton, Gavin deGraw, you should check out their CD's too! Go out and buy this cd! If u luv one tree hill, u won't regret it!
B000001EPB|5.0|This CD surpassed my expectations.  The music and energy is far superior to other versions of The Dance.  Michael Flately's influence is surely responsible for this amazing, dynamic form of entertainment.
B000002UAR|5.0|most of the reviews of people who diss the Beatles are usually written by kids? Yes, people. KIDS who were raised on sh*tty music of this decade, the '00s, or whatever you call it and wouldn't know a good song from their own misguided asses. I would have to call the '00s the most lackluster decade in music history so far. I can't decide which is worse: monotonous electro-pop, wannabe grunge bands, wannabe metal bands, Avril Lavigne, and awful \\"emo\\" music in which stupid suburban adolescents bitch about how \\"miserable\\" their lives are, when halfway around the world, kids of the same age are being tortured, shot and blown up by total strangers.  <br /> <br />Sorry for going on a tangent. If only pop albums today were like Revolver, I truthfully can say that our country would be in far better shape, politically and spiritually. The Beatles were simply the finest rock band of all time. Maybe the Beatles weren't the most technically accomplished group of all time and maybe they weren't perfect. But they were one of the finest, most prolific songwriters and singers of all time. All you misguided so-called \\"classical music expert\\" snobs need to drop your tunnel vision, pull your heads out of you-know-where and realize that GREAT music doesn't NEED to be nearly as intricate as Mozart, Beethoven or Brahms. In fact, it could only have TWO OR THREE CHORDS and be great. OH NO! BLASPHEMY!  <br /> <br />Get used to it, people. The Beatles will never be equaled.
1573223026|2.0|I'm a big Hornby fan and have up until this point liked everything that he's written. If you haven't read Fever Pitch, you should give it a go. Having said that, Nick has never disappointed as much as he's done with A Long Way Down. The book starts slow and as much as I hoped would get better, it didn't. Not only do you not feel any empathy for the characters (with the exception of Maureen), you're basically sick of them by the end of the book. The author must of been on a holiday or facing a deadline when he wrote this one. How this got published is beyond me. A long way down, will only bring you a long way down!
B0001HLVS2|5.0|This movie is pitch perfect in depicting a ship in the British Navy during the Napoleonic wars.  It is an exciting blend of action, acting, design, music, and pinpoint depictions of very complex characters. <br /> <br />Even though most of the movie involves one ship chasing another halfway around the world, the movie never felt slow.  Every scene offered something compelling whether it was the interactions between Aubrey and the doctor, the subplot of the Jonah who is bringing bad luck to Lucky Jack's ship, how the crew responds to the death of a popular seaman, or realizing just how young the midshipmen (junior offices) were when they first went to sea.  The fact that these young boys were expected to lead grown men in battle was simply amazing.   <br /> <br />I also loved how the movie highlights just how rare this kind seafaring was and how awestruck the crew could be at sights such as the Galapagos Islands.  The West was on the cusp of great discoveries and visits like the Surprise's to the islands symbolizes the rapid gains that would soon be made.  The doctor's excitement and then let down about being allowed to explore the islands is one of the most poignant aspects of the movie. <br /> <br />And then of course there are the battle scenes.  Any kind of warfare is awful and early 19th century naval warfare was particularly brutal with body parts being blown off by cannon fire, wood splinters skewering men, and musket fire raking the decks.  The Surprise is lucky to have a real doctor....most ships were stuck with barely educated saw bones who could do more harm than good.  The movie doesn't shy away from the violence of the times or the certain brutal joy that the men seemed to take on in combat.  Truly a different era. <br /> <br />I highly recommend all aspects of this movie.  It's simply a great piece of movie making.
B0001YRVN4|5.0|I like that they made this into a DVD cause they fixed the color and everything. And the special DVD that has the making of episode 4, 5, and 6 and a preview for ROTS! And it also has a X-box demo for Battle Front I (one of the BEST SW games). And at the end of ROTJ when the Ewoks and everyone on the good side are having the party thing... When you see the ghosts of Obi-Wan and Yoda.. the Anakin ghost is Heyden Christensen! And there are shots of people at Naboo, Coruscant, Tatooine and Cloud City having partys too! So if your a SW fan, I'd suggest getting this soon!
B0007OCG56|2.0|Aside from the misleading trailers that pitched this film as a comedy, this movie never finds its voice.  Is it a wise and knowing comedy?  A drama about culture clashes and the crazy things Anglos get hung up over?  I'm not sure.  The characters give us no clue.  Adam Sandler looks lost as the perfect dad/celebrity chef.  His motives are never really clear.  I think Tea Leoni is a great actress but her performance here is one note and manic.  The maid character Flor is so perfect and wise it feels like a stereotype.  There is wackiness here and there is drama but the characters are drawn so broadly and the plot is so meandering that it's hard to care.
B000002B35|5.0|<br /> Seems there is a group of fans that must have Roger Waters perform for a show to rate.  <br /> While he is an integral part of history...life goes on. <br /> <br /> Here we get 2 CD's full of Pink Floyd favourites. <br /> <br /> I enjoy having a complete Dark Side Of The Moon show included. <br />Unless there is an original show released somday, this has better sound then the boots out there. <br /> <br /> If you like Pink Floyd (The Later Years), you should enjoy this set. <br /> <br /> Face it, Guy Pratt sounds better on bass anyway. <br /> <br /> Sure, you miss the gloomyman on vocals somewhat. <br />But this set is a good listen.   <br />  <br /> If you must have Waters , then be sure and check the original band (Is There Anybody Out There?). That is outstanding & better then The Wall, studio release.  <br /> <br /> But for a live release with various albums covered. This is the best available.
B00003CXUM|5.0|this is the best non-action movie to come out of hong kong, hands down.  watching it with just the music/sound effects track and subtitles is a very enjoyable experience,  the music is wonderful. tony and maggie (from \\"hero\\") are wonderful.  if you love chinese movies, don't pass this up.
006054094X|5.0|Initially loaned a copy by a friend, I was blown away by the content.  I had no idea of these voyages.  I have given copies to several friends who are equally blown away.

B00005JKL8|5.0|I have seen this movie immediatelly after release and this comment even wouldn't be necessary if I haven't read (by chance) so-called \\"movie-commentary\\" from so-called Mr \\"Flick\\" (or whatever is his real name). Since I AM from former SFR Yugoslavia (not \\"kingdom\\", as put Mr \\"Flick\\") and was witness of horrible things, I will tell honestly my impressions about this movie. Also I will tell honestly to readers of this comment that this is NOT my real name, and I won't pretend to be as Mr \\"Flick\\": BADLY CAMOUFLAGED SERBIAN CHETNIK! <br /> <br /> <br />So...No one movie can be a 100% reality, OK? It is true for ANY movie, as well as for this one. What is important in ANY movie is:  A MESSAGE ! <br /> <br />Message of this movie is clear and artistically perfectly made, no matter if some CHETNIKS (and their allies - in former Yugoslavia, or in USA) would like to hear or see it (this message or this movie, doesn't matter). Because this movie is about battle against evil of FASCISM, no matter who represent it (in this movie is pictured serbian side of fascism 1992-1995, that commited far more attrocities in former Yugoslavia, but there were also other sides as well...) <br /> <br />Dear readers: do NOT listen to people like Mr \\"Flick\\"! <br />  <br />GO AND SEE ONE OF THE BEST WAR MOVIES EVER MADE, that is not about war spectacle, but is grounded on the REAL people in the REAL times. In one sentence: one small story that tells a lot (to those who \\"listen\\" with their hearts, not only eyes...)  <br /> <br />Artistically, professionally and technically perfect, this is a tough movie for watch, about tough times in one destroyed country, with powerfull message: EVIL cannot pass, no matter how big and powerfull can be at the moment...  <br /> <br /> <br />Finally: this movie IS NOT INTENDED TO BE WATCHED, and commented also, BY CHETNIKS (and other russofills, or serbian-orthodox chauvinists and nazi-fascists) as well as - if you have bad nerves...  <br />
B0002A2WDQ|5.0|Crossroads have long held a special significance in occult lore. They are places where there's no North or South, no East or West. They are stillpoints in the fabric of time where \\"things happen.\\" Things usually associated with the darkside of the spiritual spectrum. In otherwords, places to encounter the Devil.<br /><br />Just such a crossroads happens to be the ultimate destination of Eugene Martone (Ralph Macchio) a young and gifted classical guitarist attending the Julliard School of the Arts. Though classically trained, Eugene is obsessed with the music of the legendary bluesman Robert Johnson. He is also quite familiar with the superstitious beliefs associated with the engimatic Johnson. Some say he sold his soul to the Devil at some unspecified Mississippi crossroads in return for musical talent. Eugene dismisses such tales as nothing more than urban legend. However one tale he doesn't dismiss is the belief that Robert Johnson had one more song that was never recorded. Eugene is determined to find that lost song.<br /><br />In hopes of locating it Eugene enlists the help of Willie Brown (Joe Seneca), an old blues musician and probably the last living friend of Robert Johnson. Willie, now confined to a convalescent home in New York, promises to lead Eugene to the missing song if he helps him escape from the home and accompanies him back to Mississippi. Sneaking away at the first opportunity they spend the few dollars they have between them for tickets on a southbound bus. Thus the adventure begins.<br /><br />As they walk and hitchhike their way across the rural southern landscape, Willie begins to teach Eugene the essentials that must be experienced firsthand by anyone aspiring to be a true bluesman, such as; the hardships of life on the road and the loss of first love (love interest played by Jami Gertz). However the most important lesson turns out to be one Eugene would have never suspected. It's the truth concerning the crossroads. The story of Robert Johnson selling his soul to the Devil at the crossroads turns out to be fact, not fiction. It also turns out to be true for poor old Willie Brown.<br /><br />The real reason for Willie's desire to return to Mississippi is to attempt to win back his soul before it's too late. A feat that can only be accomplished with the help of Eugene and his guitar. Now Eugene must defeat the Devil's chosen guitarist Jack Butler (Steve Vai) in a musical challenge, or Willie and Eugene's souls will be lost forever.<br /><br />This is one of those movies you can watch over and over again. Ralph Macchio gives a strong performance but the real stars are Joe Seneca and Steve Vai. The final competition between Macchio and Vai still gives me goosebumps everytime I watch it!the Devil at the crossroads turns out to be fact, not fiction.

B0000009S3|5.0|This has got to be one of the greatest albums of all time. I say that without a flicker of doubt. There is nothing to find fault with on this album. Nothing at all. Everything is top notch from the musicianship down to all the little nuances that you are still noticing even after the 16 years of listening to it that I have had. It seems unfair and disrespectful to refer to the tracks as \\"songs\\", these are compositions of the highest order. Peaches En Regalia and Son of Mr. Green Genes have to be two of my favorite songs ever and the rest of the album is not far behind. Anyone who has even a slight interest in jazz/fusion and rock music should get this album as fast as they possibly can.
B00006AW2J|5.0|\\"Beggar's Banquet\\" is one of the string of 4 fantastic albums (Beggar's Banquet, Let It Bleed, Sticky Fingers, Exile On Main Street) the Stones put together in the late 60's and early 70's. <br />Starting with the classic \\"Sympathy For The Devil\\", there's not one bad track on this CD. <br />An essential album for any Stones or R&R fan.
B0007GAERG|5.0|Definately Mariah's best effort. She keeps the vocal gymnastics in check and lets the purety of her voice and the heartfelt lyrics do the talking! Not one Weak Track on this amazing CD. A great mix of heartfelt pop ballads (We Belong together), Great dance tracks (Shake it off.... It's like that), to gospel tinged beauties (Fly like a bird..... MIne again). A lot of talk about this being a \\"comeback\\" album, it's more like the rebirth of a terrific artist!!!!! Long may MIMI rule the charts!!!!!!
B00006AW2G|5.0|\\"Let It Bleed\\" is among the best of the Rolling Stones albums and that makes it one of the best R&R albums ever.  <br />The Stones had a string of fantastic albums (Beggar's Banquet, Let It Bleed, Sticky Fingers and Exile On Main Street) but I think this is the best of the lot and that's saying something! <br />This album is a classic that belongs in every R&R fan's collection.
B000001EAQ|5.0|Pop don't leave any middle ground, with their music inspiring intense emotions whatever they may be.  <br /> <br />The Whole album recalls the band's shoegazing sensibilities, underpinned by a stunning drifting guitar lines, which picks out the light and shaded tones of Bono's hauting vocals. The third track Mofo, is one of those strange paradoxical songs that make you feel like crying and smiling at the same time.  <br /> <br />Do You Feel Loved shows a hypnotic, eclipsing guitar line intro and intense vocal delivery once again, which explodes after 2 minutes into a drum-beat fuelled cry of despair, a  minute mid-piece and one of the most tension-filled moments on the album, pending an all out release for the curtain-closing minutes. <br /> <br />The final track on the 'A' side is Staring At The Sun, an obvious highlight for many, and one which will probably quench the thirst of most Acthung Baby fans, and is probably the nearest gets to following any kind of a pattern.  <br /> <br />The 'B' side is the darker one. On Gone, the machine drum with the delicate, icy piano beats magnify the ascending emotions and lamenting cathartic crescendos that emerge from. <br /> <br />On Please, an envelope of electronica sadness opens up after a minute of wavering programming and drums, to reveal an escalating melody instrumental gaining speed and movement, thrusting the listener headlong through a catalogue of emotions and back again.  <br /> <br />Wake Up Dead Man is a headache of sorrow and a furrowed brow of torment. <br /> <br />Pop is pregnant with obscurity, injected with minor chords and unrestrained electronica. Experimental yet elegant, and heavy but soft. This is the last U2 masterpiece, and most important, the last time U2 created something refreshingly dynamic, the perfect mix of paralysis and fluidity that makes for a remarkable album.
B00020HEL6|3.0|Wonderful young singer with a great voice.  Have enjoyed her acting and only recently discovered her singing ability.  It is interesting the type of music she sings for a young person.  Excellent CD.
B0006399FS|1.0|\\"Ladies and gentlemen...it's U2!!!! Just great music and songs, as only they can do\\"... <br /> <br />This is their biggest artistic step back ever, yes, even worse than Rattle & Hum. <br /> <br />U2 haven't changed they overly commercial style since 2000 and they have ended up in the same place as Rolling Stone, Kiss, AC/DC, etc.  <br /> <br />This CD has all the ingredients and cliches that you may expect from U2...except for the shining music, lyrics and production. Bono is completely tired in his singing abilities, broken and cracked vocals. His lyrics are completely cliche, dated and over used again and again. Stupid and childish 3 minute iPod commercials as Vertigo, hit and miss \\"Rock\\" numbers borrowed from Rattle & Hum era as All Because Of You, pseudo \\"emotional\\" rotten ballads as Sometimes You Can't Make It and A Man And A Woman, etc. <br /> <br />The Edge is just a shadow of what he used to be, as well Adam and Larry. It's clear they're more worried in trying to act like \\"the biggest band in the world\\" than trying to write and find new musical horizons. <br /> <br />Absolutely no substance neither new direction, just playing it as safe as they can. Shameful. \\"U2 Rocks\\"...may say some blindfolded fans, but if \\"Rocks\\" means selling out, writing the same kind of songs heared all these years, making stupid unforgivable iPod commercials, singing s***, pretending to fight for human rights while they just want to promote the new album at every event they perform using the same clothes and touring in the same way, even with almost the same stage used on Elevation Tour... yes, so they \\"Rock\\" more than ever. <br /> <br />Their performance at Live 8 was horrible, unforgivable, weak. Nowhere near Live Aid 1985. That's the perfect example of the U2's free falling. <br /> <br />U2 should have ended with Pop, their last great music achievement. <br /> <br />...Takes A Second To Say Goodbye...
B00005JMAH|1.0|Talk about a major let-down.  I love the Harry Potter books and I enjoyed the first two movies, but the visual style of Prisoner of Azkaban is just wrong.  It is the same visually as the Lemony Snicket movie, and while it may work for that franchise, it doesn't work for Potter.  There are other ways to make a \\"darker\\" movie, but using that horrible visual style (I don't know if it has a name) isn't the way to do it.  There was a bad balance between indoor and outdoor scenes (too much outdoors).<br /><br />As has been mentioned previously, the new Dumbledore isn't nearly the force that he is on the pages and in the first two films.  I understand the actor who portrayed him has passed away, but the new one is lacking in general bearing.<br /><br />Too many CRUCIAL details were left out of the movie.  I was waiting for someone to mention to Harry that his father and two of his friends deliberately turned themselves into Animagi to support/contain their werewolf friend (Lupin).  No one mentions that his father turned into a stag when he transformed and that's why Harry's Patronus is a stag.  The moviegoer is left in the dark on this fairly juicy piece of info.<br /><br />The McGonagall and Snape characters were a couple of the few high points of the movie.<br /><br />Again, the visual style of the movie just looked cheap, and that coupled with a swiss cheese plot was just too much to overcome.
B0009K7QZ8|5.0|Many people seem to have been disappointed with Season Two of THE O.C., but I can't count myself among them. The show definitely had a more adult feel, even in the teen story lines, and the overall mood was definitely more somber. Whether this is an improvement or a decline will largely depend on one's personal preferences. As a whole, I found Season Two consistently held my attention and always left me concerned about the fate of the major characters.<br /><br />Personally, I liked one thing about Season Two a lot, and that is the way they slowed down the developments in relationships. How many times did Ryan and Marisa break up and get back together in Season One? Too many times for me to find it believable. How many times did they break up in Season Two? None. How many times did they get back together? Once. I personally found that far more satisfying than the relational seesaw of Season One. The road to true love for Seth and Summer was a tad bumpier, but I liked the patience they displayed in developing even that more mercurial plot line.<br /><br />As with Season One, the story arcs involving the adults were as interesting or perhaps more interesting than those for the teens. Sandy Cohen just might be my favorite character on television these days, with the exception of several on LOST. What I love about him is his absolute dedication to living by a moral code, and sticking to that code even when it complicates other relationships. When an old flame returns to town, he helps her even though it hurts his marriage by making Kirsten jealous. But despite the fact that he knows Kirsten is jealous, he sticks with doing what he knows is right. Television has had in its history few believable moral characters. Most do-gooders seems cardboard at best, but Sandy Cohen is seems more like flesh and blood. But it is a tough year for Kirsten, simultaneously bothered by Sandy's helping his ex-girlfriend and smitten by the new editor hired to help with her company's new magazine. The twin pressures of what she senses as betrayal by Sandy (even if she is wrong) and the temptation represented by her coworker drive her to drink more and more heavily, resulting in her being sent at the end of the season to a treatment center for alcoholism.<br /><br />As much as I love most things on THE O.C., there have been some things I have had a hard time stomaching each year. In Season One it was the cardboardish Luke Ward and the absolutely horrific Oliver, and the unlikable Caleb Nichol in both. Also hard to take in Season Two was Alex Kelly, who managed to be--briefly--a bad girlfriend to Seth and a jealous lesbian girlfriend for Marisa. The problem is that her character never managed to become anything more than two-dimensional, and was perhaps even less interesting with Marisa than she had been with Seth. I also have not enjoyed Julie Cooper-Nichol in either season. She brings a DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES element to the show that I don't find especially welcome, and always seems to be the one recurring character of the show that is more a cardboard cartoon than well-conceived individual. She did become a bit more interesting towards the end, especially in the final episode where she pulls back from poisoning Caleb, who is intending to divorce her, only to find him at the bottom of the swimming pool after suffering a heart attack.<br /><br />The character with the toughest season was, by far, Marisa. After Ryan returns, her hopes of getting back together with him are squashed when he discovers that she is in the final throes of a fling with a gardener. She then struggles with alcohol and a up-and-down lesbian relationship before reuniting with Ryan before an attempted rape by Ryan's brother and her killing him in the finale while he is apparently beating Ryan to death. Ah, the very stuff of high class soap opera.<br /><br />What keeps THE O.C. from drifting down into the same depths as other soap operas is the overall sharpness of the writing, the vividly conceived and executed characters, and the show's unwillingness to sink into pathos. In fact, from beginning to end the show toys more with self-irony than pathos.<br /><br />Having avoided a sophomore slump, I hope that the show continues on to an excellent third season. In one way, a show like this is much harder to keep going than a show like LOST or BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER. Those shows were able to structure their narrative around a host of stories. THE O.C., like THE GILMORE GIRLS and similar shows, depends on conflicts between characters. Here's hoping they can keep it going a third season.ting, the vividly conceived and executed characters, and the show's unwillingness to sink into pathos.

0440242576|4.0|Recently, I read John Grisham's book is Skipping Christmas. I like this book. A friend of mine told me that John Grisham is very good for legal writing. He wrote some legal books that were very good. Unfortunately, I have not found time to enjoy his these books yet, but I will find time to read them. I am sure I will like them.<br /><br />Skipping Christmas is a good book and  I loved it. The story was so funny. This is a book that shows the American traditional family and American Christmas. The most important characters in the book are Luther and Nora. They are so different from another. For example, Luther is very persuasive that he agrees to let Nora go to the cruise even though she felt that they should celebrate and get into the spirit of Christmas.<br /><br />In the book, I can see a lot of things that happened in the small town. Luther and Nora went to a nice Italian restaurant - Angelo's. They enjoyed traditional Italian food.  Most American's like Italian places.<br /><br />The Christmas parade was launched every year from Veteran's park, in midtown. With floats and fire trucks and marching bands, it never changed. John Grisham is such a good writer that when I read these parts I can image these scenes. That makes me recall my childhood, I always went to see the Christmas parade.<br /><br />The main point in the book is that a family plans to skip Christmas because their daughter will not be home with them, and it won't be the same since they always celebrate it together. That's too bad. But I like this book because it is funny and describes each personality very clear, that made readers able to picture every character and background in this holiday season.<br /><br />Overall, it has a carefree plot. I also like the ending of the book, because the reasonable plots and a relatively happy ending. So I would like to see the movie sometime. I am sure that it will be so much fun.
0689878451|4.0|Peter Parnell, And Tango Makes Three (Simon and Schuster Young Readers, 2005)<br /><br />This kids' book is the kind of thing we need far more of in this world; the (true, mind you) story of two penguins who met and fell in love. Not so abnormal, one is likely to think, except that these two penguins both happened to be male, and they're in the Central Park Zoo. (One has nightmares of the right-wingers challenging the book blaming Harvey Fierstein for the penguins being gay.) Because they seemed somewhat morose that the other penguin couples were having kids, their handler gave them an egg from a couple who were likely to not take care of it, and boom, \\"Tango Has Two Daddies\\" was born. Yep, it's true-- such things do happen in other species of animal, thus hamstringing the \\"unnatural\\" argument espoused by the brainless sheep. (One wonders when there will be a kids' book about gay sheep. One is long overdue. The sheep's names could be Fred and Phelps.)<br /><br />Deserves to be on the bookshelves of the kids of any right-thinking parent.

0553801511|4.0|Robin Hobb, Golden Fool (Bantam, 2003)<br /><br />Robin Hobb's first three trilogies weaved a wonderful spell, set in a world full of strife, political malice, and the kinds of wonders little found in our quotidian existence. Now I grant you, most fantasy novels do this, but Hobb has a particularly deft touch with such things; now that I've finished the eighth book in the series (for, though published as three separate trilogies, these books are actually one massive nine-volume series spanning close to four thousand pages), I'm starting to anticipate a greater sorrow than usual at leaving such a wonderful, richly-detailed world.<br /><br />Fitz, the Fool, and Price Dutiful have returned from their task (as set before them in Fool's Errand), and now everyone's got to balance Dutiful's betrothal to a Narcheska of the Outislands, about which Dutiful himself isn't all that thrilled, with all the day-to-day basics of running a castle. Of course, a number of monkeywrenches are thrown into the works at the worst possible junctures, as well, all of which are left for the reader to uncover while picking through the complex, tangled threads of the tale. (One wonders how Hobb wraps all this up in just six and a half hundred pages.)<br /><br />The major point of criticism to be had with the book (as with its predecessor, and the series' first trilogy) is that Fitz, and many of those around him, would probably not get into nearly as much mischief if everyone would learn to talk to one another instead of trying to keep secrets or deciding that things just aren't important enough to say. Still, as artificial a plot point as that often is (and as much as the fabric wears thin enough in places that it becomes obvious), this is still a cracking good read, as are all the rest in the series, and quite highly recommended here at Goat Central.
B0006IIPIK|2.0|I give this thumbs down, because it's uninspiring in every way but one. <br /> <br />As a technical achievement, Sky Captain is everything the producers hoped for, I'm sure. What was it exactly they were trying to achieve? Using computer animation, they've produced what looks like an old black-and-white vaseline-on-the-lens live-action Saturday afternoon popcorn flick made in the 1940s, subsequently given a bad colorization job by Ted Turner. Yes, the color, such as it is, is truly horrid. Old movies never looked like this -- so I really don't know why the visual designers made the color choices they did. Mainly, the film is black and white and gray and a kind of sickly washed-out orange. Bleah. <br /> <br />The scale of production, with flying aircraft carriers, secret islands full of fantastic creatures, Shangri-La, gigantic retro-style space rockets, six-story robots marching down the streets of New York City wreaking havoc, is as large as one can imagine. And all this is generated in the computer. The actors were on a soundstage, surrounded by backgrounds and foregrounds covered in blue -- the blue parts being later removed by color separation and replaced with buildings, sky, military control centers, caves, or whatever the scene required. The integration between live and animated is virtually seemless -- probably the best that has ever been achieved. <br /> <br />As a viewer, I found the story and characters two-dimensional, and frankly I was continually distracted by the visual style of the film. This two-dimensionality might have been better served, at much less expense, with conventional animation, perhaps in the art deco style of the Batman animated TV series and their subsequent straight-to-video motion pictures (Mask of the Phantasm, Batman and Mr. Freeze, The Batman-Superman Movie) -- I might have enjoyed that kind of film a bit more, if only through lowered expectations. <br /> <br />The story itself is a blend of Buck Rogers and early 1950's sci-fi with a dash of James Bond. The dialogue is tolerable as a vehicle to move the story forward, but tries too hard to be clever. Or maybe, when you think about it, it doesn't try hard enouh. So much of the writing in old movies was rather poor -- today we only remember the good stuff, but most of it was pretty bad -- and I see no reason to emulate that cheesiness in a movie produced in 2004. <br /> <br />I can't fault the actors for falling flat. Given the lines they had to read, and the fact they had no visual cues from their surroundings to work with, their failure is excusable. Any movie that ends with the line, \\"Lens cap,\\" obviously has serious problems with the script.   <br /> <br />The average Adam Sandler movie will move me more than this film did, and that ain't sayin' much. Like a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury (in this case beautifully animated sound and fury), signifying nothing, this film is a failure, but a spectacular failure. But yeah, they did save the world, and Sky Captain gets the girl. But you already knew that's how it would end.
0790731002|5.0|Forget about what everone elese said this film ROCKED it's not dark like the fist two but it rocked okey so some stuff is stupid like Batman's new ''Super Suit'' but trust me you can ignoir that but this movie has aciton that keeps you at the ege of you're seat the story is solid and not corney and Val Kilmer is GREAT as Batman but he sucks at playing Bruce Wyne but you know and Jim Carey as The Riddler is soooooo FUNNY I mean he makes you lagh even as a VILLAIN. And Tommy Lee Jones is good at playing Two-Face and gives nice one liners but I hated Robin he sucks enyway take it from me Batman Forever is worth the time
B0007GAERG|5.0|This album is amazing. I only harboured an interest in Mariah a couple of months ago, before this album. At first, the only songs of hers that I liked were Heartbreaker, Crybaby and Breakdown but this album really changed my mind. It's urban, different from her earlier work and it's perfect.

006072448X|5.0|it's one of the most thought-provoking, well-written, risky, provocative and haunting things i've read in years. others have ably described it so i won't say more: just wanted to contribute my five stars to the mix.
B0009KA7BS|3.0|Now I hate to be one of those people that whines about how the movie was not as good as the book, or in this case, the comic book, but I'm going to have to.  It's especially frustrating as we just saw Frank Miller's Sin City come out not long after and stay very faithful, even down to the gritty two-color look.  I don't have a problem with Keanu Reeves but he simply was not the right guy to play a chain-smoking, run-down, sardonic Englishman that Constantine is supposed to be.  I think someone like Gary Oldman would have been a great choice to play Constantine.<br /><br />Keanu does the chain smoking but he looks like a guy who just started smoking yesterday, rather than the wizened, look of someone who actually HAD been chain smoking for years...add to that he does about the WORST fake coughing I've ever heard in my life.  The average ten year-old kid can fake a cough better to get out of school than Keanu does in this film.<br /><br />I don't mind the CGI and I think the director Francis lawrence did a pretty good job of NOT getting carried away with too many visual effects.  But how does a guy who never directed a feature film before get the reins to a film with this large a budget anyway?  While he resisted going overboard with the CGI he couldn't resist in turning what was a pure, very dark horror comic into a Van Helsing meets the Devil action flick.  There's more action in the average episode of \\"This Old House\\" than there is in an issue of Hellblazer.  Hellblazer is NOT an action hero...he's not a hero period.  Not even a good guy really and ultimately that's what Lawrence had him become...a pretty boy demon hunter.<br /><br />I won't delve too much into the script although I'd love to know why the Spear of Destiny was buried in the Mexican desert.  The film does have a pretty good supporting cast with Rachel Weisz as the cop/psychic object of the devil's search, and Peter Stromare as the devil himself in yet another oddball role he seems born to play.<br /><br />With all that said I'm still going to give it a slightly positive review.  I thought the story was pretty well-written although I think the plot was perhaps a bit too grand.  The affects were good, particularly those scenes in the wind-blasted desolation of hell.  Overall its hit or miss but there's more good than bad.ll going to give it a slightly positive review.

0385338686|5.0|This being her latest book, Sophie Kinsella, does not withhold any of the 'magic' that is in all her books with each main character - from Becky to Emma to Samantha. This book is an entertaining and flabergasting story of a girl who is so stressed out with daily life as a lawyer that finding time to relax is impossible. Throughout the story we find out how this workaholic makes it to relaxation through, shall we say, less than normal methods! This book is a worthwhile expense!!!
B0009KA7BS|4.0|I think most people that saw this movie had certain expectations.  If you were a hardcore fan of Hellblazer, the comic series the film was based upon, you were likely unable to get over the relocation to Los Angeles, an American John Constantine, and well, Keanu.  If you thought this was a horror flick, you weren't happy either.  Why anyone would think this was a horror film, I don't know, but apparently that was not an uncommon belief. <br /> <br />As an thinking-man's action film, Constantine hits pretty close to the mark.  It's got good action.  It demands some thought from the audience.  If you let it, you will be asking questions of yourself and your faith (perhaps that's why some people disliked it so much?). And as much as I hate to say it, even Keanu does a pretty good turn here.  He's no Lawrence Olivier (sp?), but he doesn't distract from the action. <br /> <br />This isn't The Matrix in Hell.  The character is different.  The plot is different.  Can we let that rest? <br /> <br />All in all, a pretty good movie.  It may not achieve greatness (like Bladerunner for example), but it's far from Battlefield Earth.
B0000256VK|5.0|I used to try to get into these guys in the 70's, but it always seemed to me that there was always this perpetual conflict as to what they were wanting to define themselves as musically. Most people who were fans of Roxy Music, that I knew personally, had odd tastes to begin with--outer fringe music so-to-speak. Who would've thought this infinite masterpiece [AVALON] would have emerged? Not too far into the eighties a girl who worked at an independent record store (when there used to be such a thing) used to inform me of stuff she thought was currently interesting to her. One visit shortly after Avalon's release she strongly urged me to check it out. At first I rejected the notion. Roxy Music? Nah, not my thing. But she assured me that it wasn't like their old stuff. I had a couple extra bucks and, if anything, decided to take a chance on her opinion. I've made plenty of mistakes in life, but this ain't one of 'em! This piece of work is like the Mona Lisa. In it's some 23 years of existence, I have never tired from it, it always captivates my mood, and I have only ever received gratitude from those I've introduced it to. Bottom Line: If this is missing from your collection, your collection is incomplete.

0553103547|5.0|You will not find a better series in this genre, bar none.<br /><br />It's a tad slow getting started, but if you'll stick with it, throw aside previous prejudices about the genre, you will find an absolute perfect gem.<br /><br />This series will shatter all plot preconcetions you may have gotten, and it may unsettle you. This is much more like real life than Campbell's Hero; this is what may well have happened at that time and it isn't pretty.<br /><br />This is an adult series, and it may well be the best I've ever read. Main characters kick the bucket; regularly, the seemingly dominate characters maybe aren't...<br /><br />This is a brutal example of real life, and I can't compliment or recommend GRRM any more highly.<br /><br />You miss the boat is you don't read this series.

B000002MP2|5.0|With all due respect, Green Day are not a punk rock band so dont get that idea. However, they are still a great pop/rock band, or at least they were before American Idiot, which i find to be too close to the pop border as opposed to Dookie, which while being catchy, still contained some cool guitar riffs and basslines. As for the drums, they sound cool, but Tre basically uses the same beat for every song with a couple different fills. While not my idea of the greatest display of musicianship, Dookie is a great quick, enjoyable album. Most of the songs have a catchy hook, while having some good guitar riffs. My biggest problem with the album is that after a while, all the songs sound the same and you get relatively bored. Still, its a good cd to play for a party or something because its not too heavy, while not too poppy either. Standout tracks for me are Burnout, Having a Blast, Chump, Welcome to Paradise, Pulling Teeth, and When I Come Around. Longview is terribly boring, Basket Case im just plain sick of. (\\"Do you have the time, to listen to me whine?\\") havent we all heard that one too many times? Anyway, bottom line is its a good pickup because it showcases Green Day when they were a bit heavier, many notches above American idiot in my opinion, at least in the music, lyrically maybe American Idiot is superior, as Dookie contains more college humor lyrics while Idiot tackles politics and other more mature subjects. You get the point.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|Were do you start with system of a down...you cannot describe their music, there a band in their own genre...but this cd is their best cd next \\"toxicity.\\" The songs have such meaning with their words that you have to think about what serj says sometimes to get the song.

B00000F14B|5.0|This musical still delights and charms us ... more than 40 years after it was made.  It earns our applause the old fashion way - with good solid song and dance entertainment.<br /><br />Robert Preston shines as Professor Harold Hill.  There have been ... in the history of movie-making ... and few &#34;matches made in heaven&#34; ... with an actor or actress being cast for a particular part.  Julie Andrews as Mary Poppins, for example, is a perfect match of actress and part ... as if she were born to play that particular role.  Edmund Gwenn as Santa Claus (in &#34;The Miracle on 34th Street&#34;) is another one ... as is Gene Wilder as Willie Wonka, Margaret Hamilton as the Wicked Witch of the West, and Basil Rathbone as Sherlock Holmes.  But the best match of all is, in my opinion, Robert Preston as Professor Harold Hill.  Here he plays an unscrupulous con man who sets out to deceive the entire population (about 2,400) of River City, Iowa ... and he charms his way into their hearts (and pocketbooks) and manages to stay one step ahead of the authorities.<br /><br />Along the way, he (Prof. Hill) touches the lives of a spinster-to-be (Shirley Jones as Marian the Librarian) and her extremely shy little brother Winthrop (played by a very young and adorable Ronnie Howard) and, to his surprise, he finds himself in the unfamiliar territory of a good-doer.

0671027387|3.0|I've read all four of Dan Brown's books, this one after \\"Da Vinci Code\\" and \\"Angels & Demons.\\"<br /><br />By this point I was so familiar with his make-the-villain-someone-who-seems-totally-trustworthy-but-is-not-the-main-love-interest trick that I spotted the bad guy within a chapter or two of meeting them. All the red herring scenes-where he (the author) tries to incriminate some other character-were embarrassingly clumsy and extremely unconvincing.<br /><br />I was excited by the astrobiology angle because that's my academic field, but Brown definitely got his bugs and microbes all mixed-up. Don't read this book hoping to pick up neat scientific facts, they are largely wrong.<br /><br />And the politics are just absurdly anachronistic in a post-9/11 world. All these things, coupled with the fact that character development has never been Brown's strong suit, make \\"Deception Point\\" a pretty weak read if you're hoping for another \\"Da Vinci Code.\\"<br /><br />Still, it's mostly enjoyable (even exciting at times) if you're looking for something fast-paced to power through on a flight. It's a movie-type drama/thriller/action/suspense guilty pleasure, just not too intellectually stimulating.
0385338686|5.0|I'm a big fan of the Shopaholic series, and was slightly disappointed by Can You Keep a Secret? I loved this book, however. <br /> <br />Part of the reason may be because I was a lawyer too, in the past, and Kinsella really hits the nail on the head with her description of how awful being a lawyer is.  <br /> <br />Samantha Sweeting is a whip-smart attorney at London's most prestigious firm...until she makes an egregious mistake that loses the firm 50 million pounds. The firm's insurers cover the cost, but one of the partners advises her to stay away while they decide Samantha's fate. She's fired. <br /> <br />Samantha absconds on the train to the English countryside and knocks on the door of a large house, looking for water and aspirin. The lady of the house assumes that Samantha was sent by a housekeeping agency she had called, and the comedy of errors begins. <br /> <br />Like Kinsella's other books, there is a lot of humor (and a little panic) arising from misunderstandings and miscommunications. And deliberate deceptions. Samantha becomes friends with Nathaniel, the gardener, and entrusts him with her secret...that she can't cook or clean. With some domestic training under her belt, she's happy as a housekeeper...until she learns something startling. <br /> <br />I thoroughly enjoyed this fun, yet meaningful book and would recommend it to anyone who enjoyed Kinsella's other novels.
B000002HMH|3.0|Unlike most Metallica listeners, I heard them when their first album came out and loved everything they did up until and including And Justice For All.  Which I thought was brilliant if lacking sonically. The so called black album killed the band for me. By slowing down the tempos, and going for a more commercial sound they may have appealed to more people but by then I'd discovered Sepultura, Slayer and more extreme bands like Morbid Angel. I considered Metallica to be sellouts. They stopped doing what I thought metal should do and seemed to be betraying themselves, their roots and their fans. So bye bye Metallica. With Load the band finished the transformation from a metal to a commercial hard rock band. The rot had truly set in. But that said, Load isn't a bad album.  It has some decent and heavy hard rock tunes that groove at times.  Its a bit bluesier, looking back to the '70s while emmulating the grunge sound of the '90s and it's a lot more entertaining than the \\"Black\\" album: see the previous sentence concerning groove. But if like me you loved older Metallica you may not like this. In fact you may hate it because of the departure from Metallica's signature sound. Under a different name I would like this album more and give it a higher rating, but it's Metallica so I gotta judge it by past accomplishments.
0316172324|1.0|I bought this book all excited because various critics raved about it. I also love insights into human behavior. Was I ever disappointed? Mr Gladwell starts off well,his stories reporting seemingly unusual events are interesting and well written, his analysis highly flawed and his agenda pretty evident. I would suggest that Mr Gladwell stick to books telling amusing anecdotes , and leave the analysis of these anecdotes to psychologists because he doesn't have a clue. His conclusions on speed dating and the car salesman is stretching the truth so far that its quite amazing that a publisher would bother publishing this as anything other than fiction.
B000002L7Y|4.0|I was in my teens when this album came out, and now that I'm in my 30's, it brings back such strong memories of the 80's (they weren't all bad).  The heavy synth vibe of the up-tempo songs, like \\"The Sun Always Shines on TV\\" and \\"Take on Me\\", is great to dance to (even if you are alone in the bathroom with only your blow dryer as a prop), and the slower songs like \\"Hunting High and Low\\" remind me of those aches of first love.  \\"Living a Boy's Adventure Tale\\" shows the breadth of Morten Harkett's vocal abilities and evokes the pathos of boys becoming men and falling deeply in love with no escape in sight.  While some of the lyrics sometimes veer towards the silly, I wouldn't hold them against this very strong debut album.  Definitely a must-own for 80's lovers.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|dreamy voice that will capture your heart whether the song is fast or slow, just fantastic.
B00005KHEU|4.0|This album has gotten a lot of flak for not living up to the standards ELO set in its heyday, but it's not all bad.  It offers us some strong songs like \\"Shine a Little Love\\" and \\"Confusion\\", and of course the timeless \\"Don't Bring Me Down\\".  Songs that others deemed lacking in strength should really be up for grabs under the headline \\"Personal Preference\\", since I didn't think \\"Last Train to London\\" was such a shabby song.  Sure, if you consider yourself an ELO afficionato, you may not think this lives up to their standards, but I still think they did okay with this one.
B00006399Z|3.0|I remember being a precocious 18 year old, and being almost nearly as interested in the liner notes to albums as to the music therein.  I learned a great deal about just about various 'artists,' and, in truth, sometimes I should've just stopped after the liner notes.  I shan't elaborate on which albums I learned to avoid at all costs (OK, one example: even \\"Rolling Stone\\" agreed with me on the first three hideous albums by one band that had a most undeserved reputation as being \\"cool.\\")  But, sadly, \\"Canteen\\" is one of these \\"liner note-perferential\\" things.  I mean, I remember almost drooling when I read the liner notes (in its original \\"icarnation,\\" merely the back cover), and seeing that they could, indeed, perform as a live unit with the addition of Family/Blind Faith's bassist Ric Gretch, \\"Layla's\\" drummer, Jim Gordon, AND I was most ecstatic to see Dave Mason back within Traffic's ranks.  However, upon hearing \\"Canteen\\" for the first time, I vividly remember thing, \\"hey, man, that engineer should left de ganja alone for this gig.\\"  Regardless, \\"Canteen\\" includes vintage Traffic chestnuts, \\"Medicated Goo,\\" \\"40000 Headmen, \\" and \\"Dr. Mr. Fantasy.\\"  It also included (and these were the highlights of the set, in all honesty) material from Mason's first solo album, \\"Alone Together,\\" \\"Sad And Deep As You,\\" and a very great performance of his \\"Shouldn't Have Took More Than You Gave.\\" (Although Mason never was able to give his songs good titles...) Indeed, that latter one was the sole reason I purchased this cd, some 24 years after disdaining it the first time.  That...MIGHT have had something to do with me being in a \\"similar state of mind\\" as the engineer, plus much was made of \\"Canteen\\" being \\"remastered.\\"  Didn't do much good: Winwood's vocals are almost inaudible, and the triple percussion just about dominates the entire set.  Regardless, \\"Welcome To The Canteen\\" is a cd that I envision sharing with my grandchildren some day - AFTER, of course, having them listen to the \\"Smiling Phases\\" double-cd set and the aforementioned \\"Alone Together.\\"to the \\"Smiling Phases\\" double-cd set and the aforementioned \\"Alone Together.\\"
B0000C1733|5.0|What can I say about the Red Hot Chili Peppers.  They are my second favorite band ever, right behind another great band (Teen Spirit!!! Anyone).  This CD must be reviewed in three parts, as a music CD, as a collection, and compared to the artist's other work. <br /> <br />First, as a musis CD, this one rocks.  It's absolutely amazing.  As a music CD I give it 10 stars.  5 is as high as they'll let me go.  I can't complain when i can pop in one CD and hear Under The Bridge, Soul To Squeeze, Californication, Suck My Kiss, By he Way, My Friends, and Fortune Faded. <br /> <br />Second, as a collection, this Cd is inadequate.  It's missing something.  That something happens to be their older music.  I would love to hear how the chili peppers matured over 20 years on one CD.  But since that's impossible I'll take this after playing What Hit!?.  This part gets 3.5 stars. <br /> <br />Third, compared to the artist's other work I have to admit, I'm in,love.  I haven't hear a bad song from RHCP.  The lyrics are amazing.  Under The Bridge is almost heavenly, Californication is tell all, Scar Tissue is cleansing, Otherside points the finger, and Suck My Kiss is sex crazed.  When comparing it to the other works it stands next to any CD the've releasaed.  The new songs are amaxing.  Fortune Faded is the classic late 90's RHCP you love and Save The Population is a wonderful track to end with.  It closes the album much like Road Trippin closed Californication.  If you look at my other Peppers album you'll see my review of each song.I'll only review FF and STP here.  This part gets 4 stars. <br /> <br />15. Fortune Faded 9.5/10 - The Peppers remain on top owth this one.  \\"They say in chess you have to kill the queen and then you've made it.\\" is wizardry with a pen. <br /> <br />16. Save The Population 9/10 - Most people don;t consider this equal to Fortune Faded but I love it just the same.  It's methodic. <br /> <br />Check this out as a CD.  if you don't want to buy it then download the songs not found on their other CD's.  You owe yourself justice to do so.
B00000JGOJ|5.0|*Playing By Heart* (1998) is the movie that first drew my attention to that extraordinary actress, Angelina Jolie.  Before this, the only Jolie film I had seen was *The Bone Collector*.  My focus then was on Denzel's role and the suspenseful story.  I assumed Ms Jolie (about whom I knew nothing) was just one more young actress fresh off that Hollywood conveyor belt supplying beautiful new co-stars for the A-list male leads in top-budget productions. Later I watched her in *Playing By Heart.*  It was an experience that I'd never had before watching any actress.  Her role as Joan transcends acting.  Let me put it this way: watching her, I forgot I was watching an act. For example, as Ms Jolie speaks her \\"dancing about architecture\\" lines to the camera, it's Joan seated across the table, talking to me as a good friend. <br /> <br />In my review of *Gia* I said Ms Jolie's performance is one of the very best ever put to film.  That's a fact.  But whenever I watch *Gia* I never forget that I'm watching a splendid piece of acting by an amazing talent.  *Playing By Heart* s, to me, a date.  A date with a beautiful, eccentric, highly-strung, fast-talking, sympathetic young lady named Joan.  That's why this is my personal number-one favorite Jolie movie.  Not that I'm saying that for objective reasons *Playing By Heart* is better than *Gia*, *Girl Interrupted*, or any other great Jolie film you may name.  It's just that this is one movie that made me a fan. <br /> <br />Like Gina in *Love is All There Is* or Lanie in *Life or Something Like It*, Joan is one of those very special Jolie characters that you are going to see in one movie and one movie only.  I like her the best because it seems to me that Angelina really lets us in and shows us the whole person.  There's nothing hidden about Joan.  She's all right there.  It's easy to get to know her, and once you do, you feel you've known her a long time.  She's innocent,  spontaneous, goodhearted, and as fiery as her red hair.Plus Joan dresses funny.  Tight gold-lame' pants, mauve bra peeking out of her blouse...on a movie date?  What a weird chick.  Joan of *Playing By Heart* is the 180-degree opposite of Claire of *Playing God.*  Claire is cool, elegant, watchful, calculating, a sophisticated cypher.  (Don't get me wrong--I think Claire's great!  Angelina Jolie's range of characterizations is just amazing!) <br /> <br />Emotionally, Joan's incredibly needy.  There's a bit too much frantic female energy surging around inside her.  She's so intense in her yearning to be loved that she drives men away.  The result?  Loneliness.  Lately she's had to resort to charmingly desperate little tricks to try to get close to guys she's attracted to.  If you've seen *Playing By Heart* you know one trick she pulled, pretending that her car was stolen. This was to force her date-who-was-not-a-date Keenan (Ryan Phillipe) to walk her to her apartment, where she hoped one thing would lead to another.  \\"It didn't work out,\\" she later sighed, on the phone to her sister. <br /> <br />Though I can't prove it, I believe earlier on she pulled another trick just to meet Keenan the first time.  Years ago I knew a girl who did a similar thing to get a guy's attention and sympathy and to let him know she was available.  It's the trick of pretending you just broke up with a rotten boyfriend.  A girl who'll play a farce like that is hoping it'll make her seem more interesting than the unvarnished truth: she hasn't had a boyfriend for a long time. <br /> <br />When we first meet Joan, she's this 20-something club-cat cutie talking on the pay phone in an L.A. danceteria called the Mayan.  Joan's in the loud process of breaking up with \\"someone\\" she calls Harry.  There's this good-looking but very reserved guy in a queue that's lined up next to the phone area.  That's Keenan, the one with the blue-dyed hair.  Keenan can't help but overhear Joan.  She very distinctly reminds \\"Harry\\" they've been together four months...\\"UNTIL YOU CHEATED ON ME WITH THAT SKANK FROM BLOOMINGDALE!\\"  At this point \\"Harry\\" apparently hangs up on Joan--just when the moving queue puts Keenan directly next to her. Joan turns and asks Keenan if she can borrow a quarter.  He fishes in his pocket and finds one for her.  Joan shoves the quarter into the slot, punches the keypad, gets \\"Harry\\" back on the line, and starts arguing with him about how to divide the stuff in the apartment they've been sharing.  Shortly \\"Harry\\" hangs up again.  Keenan gives her another quarter, his last.  Joan's lucky on this call and quickly achieves closure.  After hanging up she turns to tell to Keenan that the least she can do after taking his last quarter is to get him to buy her a drink.  Next we see them at a table together. <br /> <br />Joan's meeting with Keenan seems entirely accidental.  But in fact Joan has had her eye on him for some time.  As they talk over her martini and his Coke, she lets it slip she's seen him around in clubs like the Mayan, where she's noticed he's always dancing alone.  Hmmmm...the reality of this \\"Harry\\" character becomes even more doubtful when Joan tells Keenan that she and Harry were together for five months.  Keenan reminds her that on the phone she'd said four months.  stonished, she smiles and marvels, \\"You were paying attention!\\" \\"The whole club was paying attention,\\" Keenan dryly responds. She insists it was five months, then quickly moves on. <br /> <br />I don't believe in Harry.  I think Joan was calling her apartment from the pay phone, but in fact there was no Harry nor anybody else to pick up.  The whole show was an act to lure Keenan in.  After all, Joan is an actress.  Moreover she later tells her brother-in-law Hugh (Dennis Quaid) that she's twice done the improvisational acting exercises that he is shown doing in *Playing By Heart.*  We watch Hugh going into bars on different evenings to strike up conversations with complete strangers.  He is supposed to make up a story abouthimself on the spot and get the person he's speaking with to believe it.  As Hugh does this over ten evenings, he's being observed by a woman who is his improv monitor.  So, again: actress Joan has gone through these same exercises two times.  Which means she is very practiced in meeting people she doesn't know and getting them to believe things about her that aren't true. That's why I don't believe in Harry. <br /> <br />*Playing By Heart* is a filmic narrative of five apparently different stories that turn out to be one big story.  So, since there are four other movies-within-the-movie, Jolie's interplay with Phillipe is unfortunately limited.  Many who've seen *Playing By Heart* wish that the whole movie was only about Joan and Keenan.  Many agree that Jolie's performance outshines all the other actors.  And what actors!  Sean Connery, Gena Rowland, Ellen Burstyn, Dennis Quaid, Madeline Stowe, Gillian Anderson, Jon Stewart...  <br /> <br />Well, like I said, I don't think of Jolie's performance as a performance.  I'm just glad I met Joan.  Who by the way, is nicknamed Jo-jo by her Dad.  Jo-jolie played her way right into my heart.   <br /> <br />
B00000J7JO|5.0|Two of my favorite Red Hot Chili Peppers lines are \\"Dream Of Californication,\\" and \\"Complication of a Mastermind.\\"  Both lyrics are found on this CD.  This CD is EXPLOSIVE.  It's woth having for the first seven.  That being said here are the songs. <br /> <br />1. Around The World 10/10 - GREAT way to start a CD.  The feeling and emotion gets me.  Aaaaaahhhhh! <br /> <br />2. Parallel Universe 9.5/10 - Gets inside your head.  The solo is good and the chorus is AMAZING. <br /> <br />3. Scar Tissue 8/10 - TOUCHING.  The lyrics are second best to Californication.  It paints a beautiful picture. <br /> <br />4. Otherside - 10/10 - Beautiful ATTRACTIVE.  It's like a short masterpiece.  It's a mix between the hard rock and soft rock found on the CD.  Can't get better. <br /> <br />5. Get On Top 8/10 - HYPNOTIC.  Great, gets you back into the hard rock you found on the opening track.  All heavy rockers should hear. <br /> <br />6. Californication 10+/10 - It's, simply put, a MASTERPIECE.  The lyrics are amazing and the music is hypnotic. (Favorite on album) <br /> <br />7. Easily - 10/10 - What a good song.  Easily could be the best on the CD.  WONDERFUL. <br /> <br />8. Porcelain - 7/10 - It's a good song but a little SOFT for me.  It's nice to alternate with Easily and the next song.  I like the structure. <br /> <br />9. Emit Remmus 8.5/10 - I love the theme.  Beautiful.  it's a good listen.  It does justice to being called FREAKY. <br /> <br />10. I Like Dirt 7/10 - Another good song but it doesn't stack up to the other gems on the CD.  GOOD <br /> <br />11. This Velvet Glove 9/10 - I can't skip this anymore after I gave it a real good listen.  LOVELY. <br /> <br />12. Savior 10/10 - It's almost melodramatic.  But I like the over done style.  CATCHY.  Always a good listen. <br /> <br />13.Purple Stain 8/10 - I can listen to this more than Porcelain and I like dirt nut it's not a gem either.  It keeps emotionally GROUNDED and let's you enjoy future Chili Peppers releases. <br /> <br />14. Right On Time 9/10 - ROCKIN'.  This is what makes this album so special.  This keeps the rock songs on a good count. <br /> <br />15. Road Trippin 10+/10 - The last song on the album.  I think they reached PERFECTION.  It's the perfect way to close out the CD. <br /> <br />Now, let me disect this CD.  The heavy rock songs are very catchy (Around The World, Get On Top, Emit Remmus, Right On Time).  They'll have you singing along.  The ballads are beautiful (Scar Tissue, Californication, Porcelain, Road Trippin) and all but one are masterpieces.  The basic rock songs (Parallel Universe, , Otherside, Easiliy, I Like Dirt, This Velvet Glove, Savior, Purple Stain) are great.  All are good to listen to.
B00080ZG10|2.0|<br />I really really really really (emphasis on the really) wanted to like this movie! Hell, I've always been a fan of Scorsese, but this film just doesn't have the dangerous edgy flair that some of his earlier films have been known for: Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Last Temptation, etc....  <br /> <br />This film is just not daring enough in exposing the true identity of Howard Hughes. Add that to the fact that DiCaprio does not have the presense that such a role commands and you have a long boring biopic that does not measure to all the hype generated by having received an Oscar nomination for best picture. <br /> <br />The best scenes of this movie by far are the ones in which Cate Blanchett (playing Katharine Hepburn) appears and the phenomenal crash towards the end of the movie. Blanchett brought so much to the role it was hypnotizing watching her perform on screen.  <br /> <br />Gwen Stefani, Jude Law and Kate Beckinsdale do their appropriate jobs as Jean Harlow, Errol Flynn and Ava Gardner respectively but nothing worth bragging about.  <br /> <br />I have no problem complimenting the film on its visual aspects; its very convincing decor, costume design and set pieces all seem to have been put together effortlessly and the world takes on a life of its own. The glitz and glamour circa 1920's-40's is very well represented; unfortunately, as I've stated a couple of paragraphs earlier, the person (DiCaprio's Hughes) we're supposed to be experiencing this through is merely a fly on the wall himself. I bet you Andy Kaufman's impersonation of Howard Hughes would've had more depth to it! \\"Hello....I'm Howard Hughes.\\"  <br /> <br />Bottom line: Great actors such as DeNiro are so far between these days, you could count them on one hand. If an actor's expression appears as being constipated (example: Brad Pitt in TROY), it's time to figure out how to raise the dead so the oldies can teach these kids how it's done! Seriously though, if you have to watch this movie, only do it if you've watched Scorsese's early films. Only then, will you be able to truthfully distinguish Scorsese's best with this piece of Hollywood rubbish.     <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  <br /> <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />
B00005KARK|5.0|I FOUND THE MOVIE EXCELLENT. IT TOOK ME BACK TO THE TIME WHEN YOU COULD PLACE YOUR CHILD IN FRONT OF THE TV, AND NOT WORRY ABOUT NAKED BODIES, OR A FOUL MOUTH POPPING UP ON THE SCREEN. <br />THAT IS THE SORT OF MOVIE I AM LOOKING FOR MY KIDS AND MY SELF.
B0009XNUK0|4.0|...But not so because of it's lack of completion. As in the past Greatest Hits compilations by Michael and The Jacksons, there has always been filler...but no thriller, hits with pits! So this compilation IS the best so far!! Pictures included are his best photos showing off a talented singer/songwriter and not the everchanging cosmetic mess. The quality of the mastering is far superior than previous compilations including that of the earlier hits from Motown...like I Want You Back, ABC and Got To Be There. The track information is informative and I don't recall another compilation that has such details.<br /><br />  But the reason for the 1 less star is that it did not complete the Essential and added 2 songs that were not Essential for this type of CD. Granted he has had more #1 hits and more top 40 hits than most!! Over 4 decades here, from 1970 - 2000!<br /><br />But where is the # 1 Essential I'll Be There or Dancing Machine?<br /><br />They could have left out Dangerous which never charted and Leave Me Alone which is an essential, but not a hit as well. The video was a bigger hit!<br /><br />  OK now what's next?  Maybe Volume 2 Essential ...and!
B0007YMUZW|5.0|I have never really listened to Ryan Adams much, only the most popular tunes in his impressively long catalogue.  Driving across Newfoundland recently, my brother put it on and I fell instantly in love.  At times the lyrics can be a bit wonky, but the pure lack of pretention, commitment to melody, and observance of feel and mood make this a staggeringly beautiful collection of songs about love lost.  Highlights include the country-rock &quot;Let it Ride&quot;, the one-two punch of &quot;Blossom&quot; and &quot;Life is Beautiful,&quot; and the heartbreaking ballads &quot;Meadowlake Street&quot; and  &quot;How Do You Keep Love Alive.&quot;  (Also take note of the phenomenal conclusion to &quot;Cherry Lane&quot;.)  Every song on these two albums is precious and should not be done without.  I strongly recommend it (if you could not tell already.)
0553573403|3.0|I know so many people who rave about this series that I got the first three and settled down to read with high expectations. But I'm floundering half-way through the first book. Yes, the characters are well-done (I especially like Jon Snow and Daenaerys), the setting is fascinating (I love snow and mountains and the desert), the writing is excellent - but oh my lord, I am longing for a break from the unending betrayals and backstabbing and anger and lying and violence. It's not that I mind the things of the shadow, far from it - but the shadows show up much better when they're contrasted with light. Martin keeps us groping in the dark all the time, and it's exhausting! Tolkien knew enough to give us the occasional respite from the danger and evil by letting us rest for a chapter in the Shire or Rivendell. There's no sanctuary here - or if there is, I haven't gotten to it yet. Please tell me there's something good coming if I keep reading.

B0002858YS|5.0|A great album!  I feel the same way about \\"Fuss\\" as I did about the Cars' first album, or the first one from the Police.  I saw the video of \\"Mr. Brightside\\" and thought \\"Wow, these guys don't sound like everybody else!\\"<br /><br />After I bought the album, I was thrilled to find out that:  not only do they not sound like everybody else - they sound that way ON PURPOSE!  And on EVERY SONG!  What you hear is what they are.  If you like \\"Mr. Brightside\\", you're going to like everything on this CD.  There is no filler.<br /><br />I can't wait for the next one!
B0009HLDFU|1.0|The Foo Fighters are one of the few bands I think worth the hassle of buying the physical CD to get better sound than that available on the iTunes Music Store. According to the Foo Fighters' official web site, this disc is protected with Microsoft DRM and is not compatible with iTunes. This is unacceptable behavior on the part of the record label (RCA). <br /> <br />Despite the claim on the official Foo Fighters site that the DRM is not intended to abridge fair use rights, the disc is broken, and the record company is treating loyal fans like thieves. As much as I'd love to have these tunes, I can't support crippleware. This will be the first (and hopefully the only) Foo Fighters CD missing from my collection. RCA has a choice -- DRM or me.
B00080ZG10|5.0|The Aviator is undoubtebly one of the best films of the year 2004, thanks to its spectacular cast, splendid story, and immensely detailed sets and wonderful special effects. Director Martin Scorsese brings the glamorous world of the early to mid 20th century to life with a slew of vibrant colors and galant costumes that reflect the era very closely. Leonardo DiCaprio gives a magnificent performance as the tormented airplane mogul Howard Hughes, with Cate Blanchett and Kate Beckinsale are marvelous in their supporting roles as world-renowned actresses Katharine Hepburn and Ava Gardner, respectively. A must-see film gets the special edition treatment by Warner Bros. which includes a number of featurettes, documenaries, a deleted scene, a feature commentary, plus more. This Oscar-winning film is an essential piece of fine movie-making that deserves a place on any film lover's collection. Overall, an amazing spectacle.
B00005GKVS|5.0|The title says best of, and without a doubt delivers. I have the Japanese import that I bought in Germany in 1999 at a substantial discount but was happy to shell out the dough simply because it really is a good collection. My only complaints are that some of my favorites were omitted (Flight of Icarus, Killers, Ides of March, Murders in The Rue Morgue, The Prisoner, 22 Acacia Avenue for starters)and some less than classics made the cut. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that the Japanese like different songs, or perhaps the label is trying to increase sales of albums that didn't do so well. My money says a little of both. If you are starting your Maiden collection I would not reccomend this as a starting point, simply because of the price. There are other decent compilations that can be had for much cheaper. I wouldn't say this is a must have for the diehard fan, simply because there are no new tunes. If you have everything that Maiden has put out (good luck with that) but don't have the Japan release, then you've already quit reading and bought it already. I'm happy with it, but again I bought it much cheaper. If it's out there used, I would reccomend getting it that way.
B00005JLWN|5.0|Equilibrium effectivly tells one of those rare stories that force us out of the glamor created by our world of fluff culture.  I'm talking about the 1984's and Schindler's Lists of the entertainment world.  It makes you reconsider what your willing to give up in exchange for civil order. Would you give up love?  How about Hate?  It also pushes the envelope for best/most original action scenes in recent history.  Watch this movie if you can, let yourself get into it, and come to a better understanding of both yourself and whats' important to you.
B00005MP58|5.0|Cudos, Sandpoint!!!! We read your \\"detailed\\" description of the DVD version vs. the VHS version, and were we glad to hear about \\"all\\" of your comments!<br /><br />I need the \\"closed captioning, and if the color was as \\"bluish\\" as you describe...it would DEFINITELY take away from the \\"romantic\\" period that Jane Austen was trying to portray.<br /><br />We're buying more and more DVD's...but until they come out with an \\"Extra-Special\\" Edition, siting ALL the things you mentioned...I guess we'll just watch the old VHS (smile.)<br /><br />Thank you for a VERY honest commentary NOT just on the series itself, \\"but\\" on the DVD vs. the VHS.<br /><br />Very Obligingly Yours,<br /><br />Diana Lynn Beder.
B000002KB8|5.0|Some may argue that Sabbath did not invent heavy metal, only took it a step further in the heavy direction. Well, that's not true at all. Deep Purple and Led Zeppelin may have had about two albums each out before Sabbath got theirs out their but neither Purple or Zep were heavy metal, they were about a step behind being about the hardest \\"rock\\" you could get. Sabbath definitely was heavier than both and patented the sound and more importantly the \\"style\\" of heavy metal which was more apparent on Paranoid and Master of reality but started right here. I am not trying to take any thunder away from Deep Purple or Led Zeppelin though as Purple was good and Led Zeppelin being one of the greatest bands of all time.(2nd to Sabbath in my opinion) <br /> <br />Now the album review! <br /> <br />Black Sabbath-4.5- Here it is, the song that started Heavy Metal baby! It's pretty simplistic but the main riff is so dark and scary sounding that it's great. The second half picks up and has a great solo. <br /> <br />The Wizard-4- Great blues tinged song with Ozzy playing harmonica. Geezer and Bill as always prove that their the best rhythm section ever.(Geezer is among the best bassists ever only competition being Steve Harris of Iron Maiden for the top spot and Bill Ward has only John Bonham of Zeppelin and maybe Keith Moon of the Who as competition as the best Drummer in metal/rock) <br /> <br />Wasp/Behind the Wall of sleep/bassically/NIB-5- One of the best sabbath compositions ever. Geat drumming, bass(especially the solo and NIB) and guitar <br /> <br />Wicked World-4- good song with a cool solo but probably my least favorite track on this album only because the other ones are better not because it's a bad song. <br /> <br />Bit of Finger/Sleeping Village/Warning-5- Maybe not one of the best Sabbath \\"songs\\" but still earns five stars because this compostion contains Tony Iommi solo for like ten minutes throughout. Some amazing stuff I may add! Not to mention everything else isgreat as well.
B000056VIY|1.0|<br />\\"Please be advised that in this week's Jennifer Lopez Top 40 Spin Increase of 236 we bought 63 spins at a cost of $3,600.\\" <br /> <br />See above: The internal memos from Sony Music, revealed today in the New York state attorney general's investigation of payola at the company, will be mind blowing to those who are not so jaded to think records are played on the radio because they're good.  <br /> <br />Now we know. And memos from both Sony's Columbia and Epic Records senior vice presidents of promotions circa 2002-2003 - whose names are redacted in the reports but are well known in the industry - spell out who to pay and what to pay them in order to get the company's records on the air. <br /> <br />From Epic, home of J-Lo, a memo from Nov. 12, 2002, a \\"rate\\" card that shows radio stations in the Top 23 markets will receive $1000, Markets 23-100 get $800, lower markets $500. \\"If a record receives less than 75 spins at any given radio station, we will not pay the full rate,\\" the memo to DJs states. \\"We look forward to breaking many records together in the future.\\" <br /> <br />Take Jennifer Lopez's awful record, \\"Get Right,\\" with its shrill horn and lifted rap. It's now clear that was a \\"bought\\" sensation when it was released last winter. So, too, were her previous \\"hits\\" \\"I'm Glad\\" and \\"I'm Real,\\" according to the memos. All were obtained by Sony laying out dough and incentives. It's no surprise. There isn't a person alive who could hum any of those \\"songs\\" now. Not even J-Lo herself. <br />
B0009KA7BS|1.0|This is the fault of the person in charge, not Keanu Reeves. The movie from day one was plague with problems concerning the people behind the scenes, who wanted to make kids film and the director, who really did not know what he was doing.  Keanu tried is best with a script that was being change almost every day and I think he did well. I will admit that this is not his best performance and I would also agree with the majority of the reviews written that Rachel Weisz gave the best performance in the entire movie (she is that good). If you want to put fault somewhere, put it on the producers and the director, they were the ones who messed up the movie for their own gain. Keanu did his best with what he had and he really did not have much help from the people in charge.
B000004CYT|5.0|This Hogwood boxed set is very good to great as far as performance and interpretation is concerned. Sometimes sound quality can be my chief reason for buying a cd, and this has the best sound that I've found for the Beethoven symphonies. It has a very vivid fat sound quality. The sound quality in a lot of sets sounds very diffuse, kind of like listening to your stereo system without the equalizer on.<br />Not that the interpretation and performance are subpar, because they are far from that. This is period performance at it's absolute best. Hogwood shows that he knows what he's doing in conducting his superb Academy of Ancient Music.<br />This boxed set only sells for about $15.13, so I definitely wouldn't want to pass this superb bargain up!!!
B00000099Y|5.0|This dark, hostile, and mysterious album in my opinion, deserves nothing less than five stars.  This album from start to finish is what a Tool album is all about.  It contains weird fillers, dark tracks, and incredible talent. <br />If you are already a fan of Tool and do not own this epic material I recommend it.
B000077VOY|5.0|I had this vague recollection of a show I watched as a child ... underwater, marionette puppets, submarine, mermaid ... that's all I could remember.  Browsing at a used book store I found several Gerry Anderson DVD sets ... then I saw Stingray!  (...).  Or at least that's what I was thinking.  Sure enough it was the show I remembered from my childhood.  I was thrilled.  Then my son, age 8, started watching too.  He ended up watching ALL the episodes over a couple of days then wondered if there were any toys.  An online auction search uncovered Stingray toys and we are happily awaiting the arrival of our very own Stingray ship from London, England. P.S. My computer desktop now displays many stills from the series (courtesy of [...]
B00007G1ZM|5.0|Warner has done a wonderful job of restoring this magnificent melodrama, and whatever you think of Crawford, she was rarely given such a marvellous opportunity nor surrounded by so many great talents. Chief among these is director Michael Curtiz who proves yet again why he was one of the great directors of the era. His trade mark roving camera style which made Rick's cafe in CASABLANCA seem a real place that one wants to revisit over and over again, here creates an almost voyeurs view of events in 1940s LA, especially at Monty Berrigan's Beach House, a superb stylised set by the unsung genius of Hollywood Art Directors - Anton Grot. Add to all this, Steiner's magnificent score, Ernest Hallers deep focus photography and a witty, laconic script by Ranad MacDougall which offers so many memorable lines, and you have a defining example of Holywood's most glamorous noir style. Ann Blyth was nominated as Best Supporting Actress and should have won for her stomach-churning daughter-from-hell - and why she never got better parts afterwards is a mystery. Jack Carson is surprisingly effective as the oily Wally Fay [Carson was another wasted actor in Hollywood, rarely getting good roles), Eve Arden is sublime [she has so many great lines;e.g. as Jack Carson eyes her legs she says 'Leave SOMEthing on me!] and Zachary Scott is perfectly cast as the rich, slimy Monty Berrigan. Maybe it does water down the novel but it is so richly entertaining, who cares? Crawford seized this role (after arch-rival Bette Davis turned it down) and gives a superlative performance that is quintessential Crawford.  <br /> <br />The DVD is nicely done. Warner had the original nitrate camera negative for this film, and the digital frame-by-frame picture restoration is outstanding. The sound track has also been cleaned up, and is a treat for the ear! Buy it NOW before it gets discontinued, and see what style is all about.
B00080ZG1A|2.0|...several important classics in the moviehistory, but it's even hard for me to give this movie 2 stars. Only because of good acting, and some visual \\"events\\" of the production I give it 2 stars. I hated \\"Gangs of New York\\", but this was bad.  <br /> <br />Personally I didn't find it the least bit of interesting, but the problem (the main problem) that made it even worse; \\"The Aviator\\" would never end! Watching it with some friends that thought it was ok, well, I had to finnish it. <br /> <br />I will never, never watch this movie again! Never!
B00005JO9J|5.0|Having been a fan of Scrubs (before it got so repetitive), I was very excited to finally see a somewhat serious medical show coming out.  I am absolutely NOT a fan of ER.  Grey's isn't showy like that, it's more about showing the relationships and dynamics of all of the characters and how they form and mold and bend and break.  It really pulls you in and leaves you begging for more.<br /><br />If the first season finale doesn't leave you totally stunned (unless you kind of saw it coming all along...) then you better check to make sure you still have a pulse...
B0006GAI6O|5.0|I am a typical chic-flick woman and love the Sway video at the end of the DVD (It is what made me buy it vs. just rent it).  I watch dance movies over & over again and this will become a classic for me.
B0006GAOCW|4.0|Well, as much as I dislike Katie Holmes and her squeaky voice, I got this to fill the girlie movie requirement of a rental night marathon.  Forest Whitaker does have a touch with female-skewed movies.  The movie was rather cute, actually.  Although I wish Katie's ribs weren't showing while she was wearing the blue bikini in the beginning - why oh why can't actresses these days have a little meat on them? -  she played the role with charm.  And there was certainly good chemistry between her and Marc Blucas (who I had no complaints about on viewing him sans sweatshirt).  The whole thing had feel of a modern fairy tale - which was obviously intended and not a bad thing.  Feel-good, enjoyable escapist fare.  And we all need a getaway sometimes.

B0002OERI0|5.0|I don't listen to music much anymore.  Since I hit my 30's it has more and more sounded like noise than music.  (and yes, I know it's because I'm getting old so shut the hell up)  Anyway, of course I had heard 'Boulevard of Broken Dreams'.  You'd have to be raised in a closet to miss that one.  What really caught me was hearing 'Holiday' by chance on the radio.  It was such an incredible song that it really stuck in my head.  So I got the CD and I have fallen in love with nearly every song on it.<br /><br />I've read some of the reviews here.  Most people love it, a few Greenday bashers don't miss a chance to spew some crap as well.  I've read that the chords are too simple, the drumming is too simple, the lyrics aren't ground breaking, etc..  All I can say to that is, WHO CARES? This music is damn catchy and you just want to listen to it over and over again.  I don't listen to music to critique its fundamentals.  I listen to it to see if I enjoy listening to it and to see if I want to listen to it again!  And with this album I can't stop listening to it.<br /><br />Whether or not they are musical geniuses is up to those that worry about those things to decide upon.  All I can tell you is that I am enjoying it incredibly and it is an addictive album.
0446310786|5.0|To Kill a Mockingbird is deep, and it touches on sensitive themes many authors write about; but none are nearly as effective in execution as Lee. An edition to do this book justice is the current trade paperback edition, the one by HarperCollins. The particular edition is printed on creamy, acid-free paper and has a wonderful illustrated cover that would make any library proud. Enjoy this fantastic read!
0393317552|3.0|The central logical contradiction in Guns, Germs, and Steel is that Diamond makes environmental differences between the continents seem so compelling that it's hard to believe that humans would not become somewhat genetically adapted to their homelands through natural selection. <br /> <br />Most of his readers must have assumed that natural selection can't work fast enough to diversify humans. But Diamond knows that's not true, as his own lactose tolerance illustration demonstrated. <br /> <br />This mutation didn't begin to spread until people started milking animals sometime in the last 13,000 years. However, by now 98 percent of Swedes are lactose tolerant as adults versus two percent of Thais. <br /> <br />This example of human biodiversity is hardly trivial: evolving the ability to digest milk has had a sizable economic and cultural impact on, say, the Swiss. <br /> <br />Self-defeatingly, Diamond began Guns, Germs, and Steel by making a eugenic argument that New Guineans are smarter than whites because \\"natural selection promoting genes for intelligence has probably been far more ruthless in New Guinea than in more densely populated, politically complex societies...\\" <br /> <br />Of course, the virtually tautological reality is actually that while New Guineans are, on average, no doubt better at Stone Age life than you or I would be, people whose ancestors have survived for many generations in \\"densely populated, politically complex societies\\" tend to be better at functioning in \\"densely populated, politically complex societies\\" -- i.e., the modern world. <br /> <br />Diamond lectures but almost never debates. I've only heard of one time when he allowed himself to be dragged into a public discussion with a well-informed opponent (an NPR call-in show with his critic Victor Davis Hanson). <br /> <br />I talked to Diamond once after he gave a speech. We were chatting nicely until I asked him a tough question along the lines outlined above: Wouldn't different agricultural environments select for different hereditary traits in different locales? <br /> <br />I mentioned how James Q. Wilson's \\"The Marriage Problem\\" has a couple of chapters on how tropical agriculture in West Africa affects family structures. Since women can often raise enough food to feed their kids by themselves, men don't invest as much in their individual children. So wouldn't the kind of man with the most surviving children be different in a tropical agricultural environment, where he doesn't need to work too much to support them, than in a temperate agricultural environment, where he does? <br /> <br />Now, Diamond has spent a lot of time birdwatching in New Guinea, which is similar to Africa. So he knows all about what tropical agriculture selects for. But he had no intention of touching that tar-baby with a ten-foot pole. To get away from me and my question, he grabbed his papers and literally dog-trotted at about 5 mph out of the auditorium! <br /> <br />Diamond can run, but he won't be able to hide from the facts forever. I hear there are now several scientific papers in the publication pipeline about racial differences in genes that affect cognition and personality, each comparable in importance to the recent blockbuster paper on the genetic roots of high Ashkenazi Jewish IQ.  <br /> <br />In summary, while there is much good material in GG&S (although it's boringly presented), the political correctness that made Diamond into a media superstar saps the book of usefulness. His more courageous earlier book, \\"The Third Chimpanzee,\\" is, while outdated in places, much more fun and thought-provoking.
B000002MJR|5.0|This is one of my favorite rock CDs but there should have been<br /><br />more on the CD. Solid Rock I love is not on here, why? Anyway,<br /><br />here's how the songs are on the CD!<br /><br />1. CALLING ELVIS - Nice vocals and guitar riffs!<br /><br />2. WALK OF LIFE - Better rock than studio!<br /><br />3. HEAVY FUEL - The best on the album! Really hard rocking.<br /><br />4. ROMEO AND JULIET - Best on CD! Way better than Alchemy or MM.<br /><br />5. PRIVATE INVESTIGATIONS - Heavy metal at its best!!<br /><br />6. YOUR LATEST TRICK - Who cares about the bongos?<br /><br />7. ON EVERY STREET - boring! Listen to the other veresion!<br /><br />8. YOU AND YOUR FRIEND - boring!<br /><br />9. MONEY FOR NOTHING - Great version of the song! Better on BIA.<br /><br />10. BROTHERS IN ARMS - Great guitar riffs.<br /><br />I easily get tired of this CD after listening to 5 tracks!<br /><br />If you want a good cd, pick this one or Love over Gold.
B000819PKC|5.0|I'm just a fan and an owner of every Jamiroquai album - and not one with so much knowledge (or interest) about the band's evolution and so on.  But I can tell you I thoroughly enjoy this group and if for no other reason this album deserves the five star rating based simply on how it seperates itself from others in every way. <br /> <br />I almost knocked a star off based simply on how bad Black Devil Car is.  And had I not had the ability to delete it entirely from my playlist (but sadly not from my memory) I would have. Reminds me of the equally awful Black Velveteen by Lenny Kravitz (which somehow made it to his greatest hits album). <br /> <br />Having said that, I love Dynamite and while I do long for more of the horns that litter ROTSC, the things I appreciate about Jamiroquai are evident.  Starchild, Give Hate a Chance, Seven Days in Sunny June and Time Won't Wait are clear favorites. <br /> <br />Smooth band, smooth album (minus the nails-on-a-chalkboard Black Devil Car).
B00000DGUY|5.0|This maybe my favorite compilation out by any band!! But theres<br /><br />only 2 reasons why you shoudn't buy this CD, it's got editing,<br /><br />and it is missing too many songs. Down To The Waterline (My favorite), Six Blade Knife, Lions, Where Do You Think You're Going, Skateaway, Expresso Love, Hand in Hand, Solid Rock, Les<br /><br />Boys, Telegraph Road, Industrial Disease, Love over Gold studio,<br /><br />It Never Rains, Your Latest Trick studio, Why Worry, Ride Across<br /><br />the River, The Mans Too Strong, One World, When It Comes To You,<br /><br />Fade to Black, The Bug, You and Your Friend, My Parties, & Planet of New Orleans are all missing. But it's got most of my<br /><br />favorites. My favorites would be Tunnel of Love, Private Investigations, So Far Away, Money for Nothing, & Heavy Fuel.<br /><br />Buy the whole CD, it's got some really good songs on it and I<br /><br />like every song on it!
B0009MDPYM|5.0|I have to say, I thought it was going to be the same old same old exorcist movie....yeah, the begining of the movie didn't help much.  I was like, \\"Oh, there they go again with the girl in the bed...\\" (except without the head spinning thing).  Couldn't it have been a desk or at LEAST the Liberty Bell that sh was tied to?  At least THAT would have been original. Well, I was wrong...right after the bed thing, anyway.  Yes, I know, many ppl don't seem to care for Keanu Reeves, but I must say, this is one of his best work.  With it's special effects, and engaging story plot, it wasn't hard for me to really emmerse myself in this movie.  Gaven (singer from Bush) took me out of the story JUST for a second, ONLY because I didn't know he was going to be in this movie, and was thinking, \\"Gwen must be proud.\\"  Anyway, it wasn't long before I was sucked back into the movie again.  Being a non religious person, I have to admit, it really did make me wonder about existence.  So, those of you who are looking for something interesting to watch, see this.

0316172324|2.0|Blink is a shifting, slippery, difficult book. This is rather a strange thing to say about the book as a general statement because it's written in very, very plain language, is aimed clearly at a mass (though literate) audience, and is a very brisk read in a very svelte book. Many readers will describe it as eminently \\"readable.\\"  <br /> <br />Yet, we have a problem. Blink lacks a kind of focus. Good, academic non-fiction will have a point, or a statement of purpose, or a principle to prove. It will have something to say. Guns, Germs, and Steel by Jared Diamond is an excellent example of this. The Mind's Sky by Timothy Ferris is another.  <br /> <br />Blink really does not. It is a book that has a very interesting subject and has some very interesting things to say about that subject but lacks the academic courage to declare anything about the subject that might be ultimately useful to the reader or testable by a researcher (this despite many anecdotal stories regarding researchers delving in to this topic).  <br /> <br />The subject at hand is snap-judgments--or, as the book has it, \\"the power of thinking without thinking.\\" It is the instinctive sense that our conscious mind makes decisions based upon innumerable and subtle details our subconscious is picking up or, in some cases, where certain training and expertise makes the perceiver unusually sensitive to subtle details others might miss. These conscious decisions come to us instantaneously, overwhelmingly, and ineffably. The author describes this as \\"thin-slicing.\\" These details coalesce within the subconscious ways that enable the conscious mind to make a very quick, often very accurate decision. The opening section of the book lively describes the process with the story of an art museum acquiring a statue (kouros) and how they went about trying to verify its authenticity. It's an interesting topic that will grab the attention of everyone from the curious dilettante in psychology to the hard-nosed salesman inthe business world.  <br /> <br />But Blink then lapses in to a pattern that ultimately leads nowhere. It first  <br /> <br />Tells us how very, very accurate \\"thin-slicing\\" can be, then  <br />How experts can use thin-slicing to make even better, cooler decisions, then  <br />How awfully misleading thin-slicing can be--particularly in inexpert hands--along with a discussion of prejudice, then finally  <br />A summation of how people should find a balance between accurate and inaccurate thin-slicing.  <br />   <br />What is lacking in this book is any kind of scientific rigor. It is replete with stories--many of them amusing--and very interesting concepts. But there are no control groups, laboratory experiments, testable circumstances, or even corollaries speculating on the use or mis-use of thin-slicing. There is nothing ultimately useful about the book. The best that can be said about it, in the end, is that we now have a label and a term for what would customarily be regarded as first impressions.  <br /> <br />There is a worse and ancillary effect of this book as well. People who read it cover-to-cover will find it wanting due to a lack of rigor. To them, it will at best provide some interesting casual conversation topics. But for the business community--a group of readers notorious for reading bullet points instead of paragraphs, executive summaries instead of full reports, and opening chapters instead of entire books--they will take this book, read the first few sections learning how exciting and accurate thin-slicing can be. Then, they will begin to apply that knowledge to the business world far out of proportion for what is wise to do. You see, they will never make it to the more cautionary sections at the end. If Blink becomes a popular business book, it will wreak incalculable damage on the business community as it teaches the struggling middle-manager new terms by which poor decision-making based upon first impressions are made.  <br /> <br />That is a scary thing. <br /> <br />READ MORE AT INCHOATUS.COM
0440213525|4.0|This seems to be one of the better Grisham books. A young boy and his brother witness the suicide of a man wanted by the mob. Now they know where the body is and with the younger brother in hospital with shock, the older one is left manouvering around the authorities who want to wrestle the details from him and the criminals who want to silence him. He is helped by an honest lawyer Reggie Love. <br /> <br />It's not profound literature but is definitely a good read.
0393317552|5.0|Speculative fiction audiences--particularly those involving fantasy--are concerned with world-building. Inevitably, this pinpoints the rise and status of civilizations. By speculative fiction we can really include any speculative-minded person who indulges in historical fiction or even historical non-fiction in dramatic form where the mind is freed to imagine possibilities, realities, and the curious interplay of chance and fate.  <br />How exciting it is to read a non-fiction book that addresses exactly this idea of chance and fate as it relates to the most important of all terrestrial questions, viz.: why do civilizations rise and what determines their advance?  <br />Jared Diamond is a thoroughly engaging author--a crucial component when dealing with history--and in this Pulitzer prize-winning book, he manages to infect us with his interest in everything: geology, climate, group psychology, farming, animal husbandry... every facet of a civilization that can affect its rise is addressed.  <br />The original premise of the book was one with racial overtones: why did predominately white Europeans come to such an industrial advantage that they came to economically dominate the globe? Why is it that \\"red\\" American Indians, \\"black\\" Africans, or \\"yellow\\" Asians come to such a state as to be largely subdued by \\"white\\" Europe?  <br />The answer, as Diamond goes about proving, is everything but racial. And that answer--replete with all those interconnected facets of geology, geography and biology--is so much more tremendously exciting and instructive.  <br />It turns out that advanced civilization is much more fragile than the notional abundancy of Gaia-theory would have us believe. Domesticable, nutritious grains are not common. Domesticable animals are not common. Open lines of latitude as transmission points of information turn out to be extremely important where open lines of longitude are not terribly useful. That information--composed of technical knowledge, economictrade, and biological germs--become in turn very important in allowing the rise of cities and their ability to cope or cooperate with competition.  <br />Most intellectually curious people ponder the rise of civilization. To them, reading Guns is like seeing a great lot of puzzle pieces come together with audible clicks. The resulting portrait of civil evolution is compelling and rewarding by itself.  <br />As satisfying as this book is for the intellectually curious, there is a very peculiar appeal to those imaginatively curious people who imagine alternative lines of history or the future expansion of humanity in to space.

0141439475|5.0|Unfortunately, the idea of what Frankenstein is about has been heartily ruined by it being adopted by the schlock film industry in the 20th century. This, the real thing, is much more amazing than any movie. When the book was published, it was also somewhat of a milestone in the history of women's writing as Shelley used a male pseudonym but when the novel became extremely popular, the truth came out and many realised that, hey, women CAN write just as well as men! The writing is at times difficult but not overly so.<br /><br />What I remember most from reading it is a deep sense of philosophical despair that the book conveys. Unlike most film versions, the book is based on the idea of the suffering creation and works like Milton's Paradise Lost. The creature is created and then abandonned to fate, unable to be a part of society due to its physical ugliness. Eventually, it becomes a fiend after a heap of misfortunes and psychological torture. In what I think is some of the best horror writing ever, Shelley brilliantly describes the psychological mindgames between Frankenstein and the monster. However, mixed in with the evil caused and suffered is a sense of solidarity - the monster is inflicted with a profound pain and is a philosopher as much as a murderer.<br /><br />The book also deals with movements like Romanticism and the Scientific Revolution and their relationship. Thus, Frankenstein's scientific obsessions are portrayed as unhealthy in terms of not being accompanied by a sense of emotional context.<br /><br />There is an absolute heap of other symbolism in the book but even from the basic text, there are so many ideas and emotions being presented to the reader that this deserves to be hailed as one of the great world classics.
B00000I9P0|5.0|Soundtracks of the 80's always jammed when it came to cool lyrics, hot rhythms, and songls that were only developed and recorded for the films they represented. Cobra is no different. Its cool streamlined, synthesizer riffs, to the solid vocals of its artists, make this one cool album to jam or drive to. I even enjoy working out to this as well!! Rock On!!

B00003CY0V|2.0|Well, if you want to see Hale Berry (...), watch this! It's a brief and pointless scene. If you want to see John Travolta drive a frickin' sweet car, watch this! If you want to see some cool and memorable visuals and scenes, watch this!  But besides that, this movie was bad. The movie was just plain weird, confusing and...weird! But, the director was smart, show Hale Berry (...) and you'll get some men to go see it and maybe even buy it! Oh, and what's that? Add an awesome car that I want to buy even though I can't, well that's cool. By the way, the car is a Tuscan and it's sweet. But, if you want to check out that car, buy Project Gotham Racing 1 or 2 and you can drive it or buy it if you're RICH! Oh, and if you want to chexk out Hale Berry, I think that Monster's Ball shows some stuff but I never saw it! So, just stay away from this movie!
0805076476|5.0|As we approach ten years since the original publication of Fight Club, we can look back and say that it is THE novel of the nineties.  The nineties were a decade when Americans (and most of the Western world) sat as comfortably as any group of people in the history of the world.  Major international conflict seemed gone with the end of the Cold War, crime at home was on a marked decline, and the stock market and economy were soaring.    Amidst all that comfort, Americans were able to look at themselves, at their place in it all.  All they found was emptiness.      Fight Club shows that emptiness taking form, where people without purpose band together like a cult, and go on a massive rampage of destruction and mayhem.     \\"We are the middle children of history, raised by television to believe that someday we'll be millionaires and movie stars and rock stars, but we won't.\\"
B00005JKED|2.0|I expected this movie to be brilliant but it was anything but that. I prefer Tears of the Sun a lot more than this Antoine Fuqua movie. Actually, the movie deserves 0 stars in my opinion but Denzel Washington's brilliant performance made me change it. The 2 and 1/2 stars are all thanks to his performance and not this terrible movie. The movie is all about drugs and violence and corruption with plenty of cuss words to go along. You see, I had such high expectations for it and then I realized that this movie was a smart decision to make. Pay one of the best actors ever to carry the load and everyone will forget about the awful movie that talks about the same thing over and over again. Sure, I recommend this movie to everyone to see Denzel Washington's extraordinary performance but the movie is like Denzel's performance, only without the extra. It's a very ordinary movie about drugs, profanity, sex, and violence and all of the rest of stuff that America is into. Well this is what's in every movie and I've grown sick of it. Antoine Fuqua's plan worked, I'm recommending this movie to everyone, not because of the terrible movie but because of Denzel Washington's jaw dropping and amazing performance. But, one more thing, if you want to see an excellent performance by Denzel and an excellent movie, watch the hurricane!  <br />Here are 3 great performances by Denzel and 3 great movies: <br />1. The Hurricane <br />2. Philadelphia <br />3. John Q
B00063MBU8|5.0|It's a good album, and I might be biased but I adore this band [even saw them live]. They have catchy songs and aren't trying to be anything other than what they are. They might not be the big names like 'The Ramones' but it doesn't mean they don't try. You'll either love them or hate them, and that's just fine. Before you buy a CD sample the music and see if you like them.
B00000JLWW|2.0|This movie is fairly descent but is definitely not worth best picture or the other millions of awards that it won. Oh, and the fact that a movie this lousy is the one that won the most money ever (over 1 billion dollars) is pathetic. If you look at the top grossing movies of all time and see stuff like this and home alone, well. Everyone loves this movie so much and thanks to girls who went to see it 10 times at the movie theathers, there you have it, over 1 billion dollars. Oh, and by the way, I had trouble sitting through one viewing, and I haven't seen it since 1997 at the theathers. Leonardo DeCaprio is a terrible actor, let's face it and Kate Winslet is nothing special. So, the wish that I had would have been that they would have rated it R for nudity, but no, they rated it PG-13 so everyone can see it. The movie isn't that bad, but it's so overated. Braveheart, the green mile, the shawnshank redemption, the hurricane, and movies like that should have won this amount of movie, and not a movie like this. On top of it, it's totally holywood and all the girls are like: \\"Leonardo Decaprio's so hot!\\" And then when he dies, they cry. And they're crying because h dies but they don't care about the other hundreds of people that died. Just him. And the portrait thing was stupid. On top of it, if you read a book about the actual event, you'll note how over 800 men died while slightly over 100 women and children died. Why? Becausr the men gave up the lifeboats for the women and children. But to make it holywood, the man have to be total a**** and try to steal the lifeboats from the women. Which rarely happen. So James Cameron doesn't care, he just wants to make money. And everyone in this movie is sad for Leonardo Decprio and no one else probably. It's pathetic that a movie like this won best picture. Watch As Good As It Gets and L.A Confidential! They're a lot better!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0060555661|5.0|I used to read many books about technical analysis on stock market, but they could not give clear view on the market.

0393317552|5.0|Certain folks are offended by this book.  They say that Diamond's insightful explorations about geography, flora, fauna, and history deny the simple cultural superiority of European culture.  Some folks even insist that it's superior genetics that led to superior culture.  Part of the fun of this book is watching people's reaction to it.  To think, I'd thought racism wasn't in vogue this century!<br /><br />But genetics and culture are not the focus of this book. Whatever role they might play, Diamond simply doesn't get into it.  So, extrapolating from some people's reactions, if you're going to get defensive about being white and from the dominant culture on the planet, this isn't the book for you.  But if you're not likely to get offended by someone pointing out that some areas might have been better for developing civilizations in ways you wouldn't expect, then pick up a copy and give it a read.  Fans of Sid Meier's computer game Civilization will recognize and appreciate how the effects of continent shape (to name one factor) play a surprisingly large role in history.<br /><br />BTW the book is vastly superior to the NPR series.  I think the series must be intended for a young audience.  Diamond's arguments don't lend themselves well to a simplified television format.
B0009A1AS2|1.0|Wow what a disappointment. This is dream theater? No, it cant be. Because dream theater writes great epic songs. but talk about toning it down. Im all for changing sounds between albums and trying to stay fresh and original. hell, DT could release a techno album, and i'd dig it... IF THE SONGS WERE GOOD! theres not one memorable song on this album.  <br /> <br />pretucci's solos are dull and go nowhere. same can be said about myung's bass. its practically non existant. and dont even get me started of portnoy's retarded metronome rhythms. *yawn* the only compliment i can give this album is that rudess really shines through with his keyboard lines. but even that can't save this garbage <br /> <br />I can understand the idea they had behind toning it down on this album, making it more simple and easy to follow. the songs have sensible time lengths and they do follow a set structure (versus just going off on a tangent like every other DT song), BUT I DONT SEE HOW THEY CAN OVERLOOK THE MOST BASIC ASPECT OF A SONG - MAKING IT GOOD <br /> <br />I bet this was never said in the studio:  <br />\\"hey, does everyone like where this song is going? is this even good? will people remember these tracks? would people be inspired to learn these songs? will people want to come see us play these songs live?\\" <br /> <br />so yeah, give me an excuse as to why this album should get any credibility and i'll tell you you're just bullsh*tting yourself. <br />This is an album for the band and not the fans? they wanted it to be the way it was?  <br /> <br />I've got one in a half words for you: St. Anger <br />
0312323859|5.0|Usually follow up books that come out so quickly after a popular first installment are not that good. This is a definite exception! I read SOMETHING BLUE in two days.

B000957O82|4.0|Found the movie light hearted and entertaining but with a message that is true in the real world. Will Smith plays this role well and the movie has just the right amount of humour without making it too corny. Romantics should enjoy this film.
1400043662|5.0|Reading Murakami is a bit like going into therapy. The images and dreams can seem familiar and identifiable to others, but they are also full of personal meaning. Each book tightens the web of associations and memories for Murakami readers; as result they end up talking about other books in order to understand the novel at hand. (This is true with other writers as well, of course, but Murakami intentionally ventures into the dark psychological realm.) I loved this novel, and found it a very satisfying extension and refinement of his work, particularly Hard-Boiled Wonderland, Wind-Up Bird, and Dance, Dance, Dance. I particularly enjoyed the ending, the writer's usual area of weakness. But the book doesn't depend on the ending -- anywhere you enter, there are mental puzzles and verbal delights galore.  <br /> <br />I dreamt more than usual while reading this book. Murakami sends me deep into myself, where I examine those feelings and forces that churn and charge forward, driving me to express my true self and to take control of my own life. As with some of the other books, I had the feeling that I was becoming more fully myself while I followed the developing situation. Much of the novel exists between two worlds, which resonated deeply with me because of the death of my mother six months ago and my heightened awareness of her lingering presence. I swam everyday when I was reading \\"Kafka on the Shore,\\" and being in water was an ideal medium for coming to terms with Kafka's progress through the labyrinth of familial obligation, anger, and self-knowledge. I read Tony Kushner's \\"A Dybbuk\\" while floating in the pool one afternoon -- a play in which a \\"living soul\\" inhabits the body of his beloved. The rabbi entrusted with her exorcism fails and love triumphs in a very uneasy world: it felt like I was reading a gloss on \\"Kafka.\\" I had just finished a surf novel, \\"Tijuana Straits,\\" before I started this one, and I kept hearing echoes from that work (by Kem Nunn) echoed as well as sections of Richard Linklatter's first film, \\"Slacker.\\" This is the process many go through reading Murakami -- all sorts of elements come to more vivid life and stick to the psychological fly-paper.  <br /> <br />Like most Murakami novels, this felt improvised, as if he weren't sure where he was headed, but the prose was more polished and the story more buffed than the early novels. It seemed more like \\"East of the Sun\\" or the short stories, which is just fine by me. The national amnesia about the horrors of World War II was not explored as deeply as in Wind-Up Bird, but it was suggested enough to lead the reader to reconsider in light of current events in China and Japan. Among other things, Murakami is working things out in real time -- our time; as concerned as he is with the eternal, he is also writing quickly enough to let the present flicker through his words.  <br /> <br />There are surprises, recollections, jokes, and profundities aplenty. This seems an excellent introduction to the world of Haruki Murakami as well as a step forward into the unknown that is his particular turf.
B000002KFJ|5.0|I may start this review of sabotage by saying something somewhat conroversial. I know that their styles where different but am I the only one who thinks Sabbath blows Zeppelin completely and utterly out of the water on all fonts and especially as far as Sabbath's first 6 albums are concerned. <br /> <br />One reviewer was right in stating how Sabotage is the culmination and the fusing together of everything that made Sabbath the best metal/rock band ever. What an album. <br /> <br />It was years since I heard it, but not too long ago I picked it off the shelf and... Bam!!! I truly think the world has never heard anything quite like this again. Ozzy's in top form, with an anger and irony he has never been able to achieve again. Iommi shows us why he's the greatest metal guitarist of all time and Bill Ward's playing here reinforces my view that he is better than Bonham(RIP). But for me the star of Sabotage has to be Geezer Butler. Since the first time I heard this album I was awed by his playing on here (check out the bass playing on Symptom of the Universe and The Writ). <br /> <br />Hole in the Sky- excellent opener. Brilliant rock song. What a riff. <br />Dont Start too Late- Short instrumental but great in setting the mood for <br />Symptom of the Universe- WOW!! This is what its all about. <br />Megalomania- The best song on here and possibly Sabbath's finest moment. Symptom and Megalomania illustrate my point in that I feel Sabbath were better than Zeppelin.  <br />The Thrill of it All- good rock song. nothing special though. <br />Supertzar- Interesting. <br />Am I Going Insane?- it grows on you. <br />The Writ- For me, The last real great track by the original Sabbath. What a way to finish off a masterpiece. Amazing lyrics by the way. <br /> <br />Sabbath's fortunes (or lack thereof) after Sabotage are well documented but this work stands as a real and deserving testament to the greatest rock band of them all. It was the first Sabbath record I ever heard and instantly made me into a fan. I would suggest however to begin with paranoid or master of reality if you are a beginner so once you hear this you'll appreciate it even more as you will know where the band was coming from when they made this masterpiece- dare I say the best album of the 70s?

0790749815|3.0|I've watched Hitchcock's Rope, Rear Window, Psycho and Vertigo. Honestly, North by Northwest is perhaps the least bright among all. It doesn't have the suspense of Psycho, camera-work of Vertigo, smart setup as Rear Window and witty banter as Rope. In fact, with the blockbuster movie like that, I'm surprised at the slow moving storyline, even the explosion of the airplane was not thrilling.    I'm not going to give a summary of the movie since others have done it aptly, but there are flaws in the movies which they fail to point out; the most obvious one is that the movie did not once attempt to explain why the thugs think that Cary Grant is an FBI agent. Sure, it was a case of mistaken identity, but why him in particular?     Also, there were some parts, which are unneccessary at all, and would not suffer if they were edited out; all the better they should be edited out because it would only slow the pace of the over-2-hour movie. Such scenes, I can easily think of, are the scenes with Cary Grant waiting in the open fields, as if he was cruising.    Hitchcock seems to want to play with the Oedipal relationship between Cary Grant's character and his mother but this doesn't seem to work out. The relationship has only slight undertones of Oedipal, yet it offers no insight to Grant's character development and it doesn't carry through the movie. The mother disappears 1/3 through the movie, as if there wasn't such a character at all. The Oedipal relationship is, in another words, quite useless to the development of the plot.    Not Hitchcock's finest.

B0002Z0EYK|3.0|I watched the movie \\"Troy\\" at home, because somehow I totally managed to miss it in the theaters. And taking that into consideration, perhaps I didn't get to see all the special affects as if I would in a theater. I must say that this movie did not leave me with any sort of amazement after viewing it.  <br /> <br />And of course America's playboy star Brad Pitt, is shown naked numerousely in the movie. Suprised? Not me. <br /> <br />Truthfully, to say that this movie was great, would be awully close to a lie. This movie by every means does follow the story of Homer, Iliad, but it doesn't have a 'spark' to it when one can really say it was astonishing. <br /> <br />It was a good movie, I give it that, but to see Orlando Bloom acting like an innocent, naive little virgin just didn't evoke that awing in me. In absolutely no part of the movie did he act manly, and I bet that if you put a wig on him, he'd be undistinguishable from a woman. <br /> <br />On the other hand, I like the way Brad Pitt always acts so casually towards everything in every movie he does. It has become his image. I definetly am not at all impressed by Brad Pitt, like all those women fans of his are, after all, we must remember that he does not write the lines he says, so all these intelligent words that come out of his mouth are not actually his. Also, his hair in the movie does not suit him. <br /> <br />One more thing, I hate the way Paris's father cries all the time, it looks more like he's having a heart attack. <br /> <br />The acual camera work, and I must say I like most of the camera work in other action movies, was done poorly in some parts. Especially the parts where they 'zoom in'. Also the way the camera captures the color of the background looked a bit old. <br /> <br />This movie was an 'ok' to me.   <br /> <br />If you like heroism and action, you should see it, just for your own opinion.  <br /> <br />Anyways, thanks for your time, <br /> <br />mirage <br />
B0009R1T7M|4.0|Wow!  Stunning work across the board.  The first 12 songs could easily have sufficed for a great album, but luckily Sufjan Stevens pushed on.  The result is a 23 song work of grace and poignancy that one can listen to time and again. Listening to Sufjan Stevens makes it a little bit easier to deal with the loss of Elliott Smith.  Both are great crafters of song.
B000A88F22|5.0|This show is so great because it's not scripted, like \\"The Simple Life\\" or \\"The Newlyweds.\\" I think Mrs.Spears is very fun and the critics just don't like her because she's successful. This DVD will include a bonus CD which I love because it's going to include the songs Chaotic (the theme song) and Someday (I Will Understand) (her new single).

B0009YA37W|5.0|This is a phenomenal CD, which I would definitely recommned to al those who grew up during the 1980's post-punk era.  The Editors combine the raw angular guitars of early Echo and the Bunnymen and Psychedelic Furs, the goth doom-and-gloom voices and sounds of Joy Division (and present-day bands like Interpol) and some of the pop sounds of U2 and Tears for Fears.  This is the best debut album of 2005, by far.

I don't go through that \\"trasformation\\" so many of you people who heard it at my age... in fact I only liked mabye 4 songs on the whole cd! Of course Something I noticed immeadiately is the fact that its SO complex for a pop album at that time...and yet It still seems incredibly simple. Of course I was intrigued by it and so I listen to it a bit more and soon I absolutley fell in love with it...BUT I do not think that this is the greatest cd of all time. That title would belong to ether pink floyd or the beatles....but this would be 3rd EASILY... <br /> <br />I can now say that I am one of the many people who wish that brian wilson realesed smile back in 1967...
0375507256|5.0|I didn't enjoy Cloud Atlas quite as much as I did Mitchell's first novel, Ghostwritten, but it still confirms Mitchell on my list of I'll Read Anything They Write authors. The man is a prose virtuoso, and he knows it. One of his narrators is a young prodigy of a composer working, in 1931, on a piece called Cloud Atlas Sextet. He describes it as a \\"sextet for overlapping soloists\\": \\"In the first set, each solo is interrupted by its successor: in the second, each interruption is recontinued, in order. Revolutionary or gimmicky? Shan't know until it's finished.\\" And that's precisely the structure of the novel, which features six narrators, each from a different time ranging from the early nineteenth century to a far distant post-apocalyptic future, whose chapters proceed in chronological order, each interrupting the last, for the first half of the book, and then unfold in the opposite direction in the second. In the end, the conceit is more gimmicky than revolutionary, but the writing is incredible. Mitchell is a narrative chameleon; it's impossible for me to imagine how a single person contains the capacity for so many voices, so many literary worlds. He's not really a great storyteller-the narratives themselves aren't all that compelling-but he has a striking genius for creating storytellers.
B00003CXD0|5.0|The story of a \\"difficult\\" actor finding success by dressing as a woman is turned into one of the all-time great film comedies. Dustin Hoffman's performance in the lead role is quite simply stunning and Jessica Lange has just the right touch of aloofness as a soap actor and love interest. Aside from the hilarious comedy it is also a film of great humanity and warmth. The \\"It might be you\\" segment about half way through - masterfully sung by Stephen Bishop - is one of the greatest moments in cinema. Definitely a must see.
B0009KA7BS|1.0|Lamebrain horror film that not only rips off a much better film out there (The prophecy) but also lacks the thrills that movie had in spades. Keanu Reeves is still his same self here, which means that he gives another boring acting turn. His fellow co-stars do far more in their parts with Rachel Weisz being the stand out, giving a great performance that has resonance and guts. Djimon Hounsou is good as well but he's barley in the film and Peter Stormare give a great cameo that really should have been a bigger role. Weisz, Hounsou and Stormare give far more acting weight to this lame brain horror movie than it deserved and for that, they are worthy of the praise (Especially Weisz, who does lift this movie above the mediocre garbage it's really is.) but regardless of their worthy acting turns, the movie is plague by a script that really does not make any sense and a director who does not know how to direct a movie. <br />
B00005K9LM|5.0|What can I say? Defenders Of the Faith is the greatest album recorded ever. Judas Priest is the greatest metalk band ever, and this is their opus.
B0009NSE1K|4.0|Well here we go. A new CD from the greatest band around. First let me say I'm giving this a 4 on the Clutch scale. On the regular scale it would be a 5.  <br /> <br />I'll start by comparing this CD to it's predecessor \\"Blast Tyrant\\". Personally I don't think this one is as good, But then again \\"Blast Tyrant\\" might be Clutch's best and I'm sure they weren't trying to recreate it. \\"Robot Hive\\" has a much more bluesy sound and feel to it. Where as \\"Blast Tyrant\\" was more heavy and groovier.   <br /> <br />\\"Robot HIve\\" opens very strong with \\"The Incomperable Mr. Flannery\\" This is an instant Clutch classic, one of the best songs on the album, and probably the closest thing to \\"Blast Tyrant\\". Next is \\"Burning Beard\\", one of the heavier songs. \\"Gullah\\" is kind of a blues/groove song about Noah's ark, another one of my favorites. Then you have the single \\"Mice & Gods\\". this is the most \\"mainstream\\" sounding song on the album. but still quite good. \\"Pulaski Skyway\\", I really like the way this song starts out but it seema to lose steam once the vocals begin. Next is \\"Never be Moved\\". This is my favorite song on the record! Excellint use of the organ on this song and they mixed it very well with the guitar and drums. \\"10001110101\\" This is a good song but I found myself liking it a whole lot more after seeing them perform it live. Now you come to my least favorite part of the album \\"Small Upsetters\\", an instrumental that is OK but it's no \\"Wysisywig\\", \\"Cicus Maximus\\", which a lot of people seem to really like but I'd say it's my least favorite. And then \\"Tripping the Alarm\\", Which I don't even know why this is a song. It seems to simply be the end of \\"Cicus Maximus\\" to me. <br /> <br />Now We get back into the good stuff with \\"10,000 Witnesses\\" which again has a good groove to it. \\"Land of Pleasant Living\\" is the only \\"ballad\\" type song, it's good! The album ends with the 2 covers, \\"Gravel Road\\" & \\"Who's Been Talking\\". These are also 2 of my favorite songs on the album. I didnot know they were covers when I first heard them. They are old blues songs, I haven't heard the origionals but Clutch makes them sound very good and still VERY bluesy. \\"Gravel Road\\" was also one of the highlights at the live show. Niel plays the guitar on it and it's pretty amazing! <br /> <br />Like most Clutch, this record took me a couple of listens to really get a feel for it and really like it. I think this is a very strong release for them and will get them some much deserved critical acclaim. I also noticed That there were a whole lot more people at the live show this year as opposed to last. So the secret might finally be getting out about this band. GO SEE CLUTCH LIVE IF YOU GET THE CHANCE!

B000069AUI|3.0|So take a big chunk of Pink Floyd from the \\"Wish You Were Here\\" era, add in a good amount of Oasis, stir in some Collective Soul, sprinkle with XTC, the Beatles and even Simon and Garfunkle, mix together, and you end up with A Rush of Blood to the Head. When I first heard the title track I thought it must be from a Pink Floyd work I'd missed. This is a perfectly pleasant album to listen to but there is very little originality to be found here.
B000002UAU|3.0|For me the mark of a great song is its ability to stand up to any interpretation, arrangement or production.  Perhaps that's why there have been so many covers of \\"Yesterday\\".  The songs on \\"Pepper\\" do not meet that standard.  Many people feel this album is a pinnacle for the Beatles.  While that may be with respect to their innovation in the studio, without the dazzling production many of the songs do not hold up.  Proof of this can be seen on Elton John's cover version of \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\\".  In the pop combo arrangement it loses all effect.  Lennon's witty, arcane lyrics are propped up by the equally arty arrangement.  This album is a step down from the previous \\"Revolver\\" where production didn't overshadow the strong songwriting.  Here production is a crutch for some of the weakest songs the group ever wrote.
B0009MDPYW|1.0|Really bad thriller that makes Keanu's last two-matrix movies look like masterpiece compared to this film. Keanu is miscast to the point of hurting the film and his performance as John Constantine should be considered a criminal act. I agree with everyone who have seen this film that Rachel Weisz does do wonders for this horrible film with her amazing performance but she is by herself in the good acting department and does not get a real actor to play with int'l the end where Peter Stormare shows up as the king of darkness himself but with only four minutes of screen time, he does not make an enough presence to give Weisz the support she needs to save this film. <br /> <br />See the film in order to witness a great actress who's trying desperately to save this film but other than her grant effort to give the audience something to watch, she's let down (as well as the viewer) by a badly written script and a leading man who can't act.  <br />
B00005JLET|3.0|I have to admit this movie was very creative and interesting and the picture was really nice. <br /> <br />However, I think the movie was boring and could have been made a lot more interesting. Definately not a fan. I guess this is just my opinion and I respect the rest of yours. Maybe its just the way this guy works with his anime.
B00005K9QP|5.0|I've been listening to this album for nearly 40 years now and it still sounds just as good.  For many of us who heard Clapton live with the Bluesbreakers in 1965-6, this album will always be his greatest work - and the thing I always remember is that when me and my mates first heard it we were disappointed!  Clapton was even more inspirational playing around the London clubs like the Marquee and the Flamingo.  Despite Clapton's well-known efforts to play loud in the studio etc. the recorded sound rarely captures the fluidity and incandescent intensity of Clapton's playing at that time.  Nevertheless, Have You Heard and Stepping Out are still blues guitar to die for and the best attempt available to capture the musical experience of a lifetime.  Elderly anorak hippies like myself will argue enjoyably for ever about the relative merits of Clapton and Hendrix - but for me, this album shows why we were daft enough to go around writing 'Clapton is God' all over the place!  No serious blues fan could possibly be without it.
0783241569|4.0|I do agree with the reviews that say this is boring. It is boring in a way, but its value should come from the fact that its not totally fabricated and changed for the viewers' sake, but was rather bold of it to stand its ground and be the way it is. <br /> <br />Many of the so called non-boring more exciting films are really fabricated and exaggerated with extras that really bring it far away from what we should know as reality. This film, to me, was more reflecting over the boundaries of reality. Many other films add a bunch of stuff in order to draw viewers into it and give them settings and plots of occurences that flies far from what real life is about, something that doesn't happen as well in real life. <br /> <br />There are people that like fictional and then there are those that like non-fiction. It depends on how you view it, either you like a movie that has a bunch of totally exaggerated and made up stuff or the real life deal as this movie is. <br /> <br />Still, however, I thought this movie was a little boring, but interesting still to watch. As always, many things that can be done to make it more interesting, but I guess it is the way it is.  <br /> <br />Nice day to all. This movie will either make you put on your night cap and bring out your little teddy bear or make you say \\"hmm...\\"
B0009KA7BS|3.0|Constantine marks the feature film debut of music video director Francis Lawrence who, judging by the look of this movie, would like to follow in the footsteps of David Fincher. For his first time out, Lawrence takes on the daunting task of adapting the excellent comic book, Hellblazer. Its main character, John Constantine first appeared in the pages of Swamp Thing, during an illustrious run by Alan Moore. Eventually, Constantine got his own series with the launch of DC Comics' Vertigo line. Jamie Delano was the primary writer and fleshed out the character's backstory, his friends (like Chas the cabbie) and family. These stories typified late `80s comic book horror and provided a bridge between Moore and the next creative heavyweight to tackle the character, Garth Ennis. His run on Hellblazer is where the movie gets most of its material from. Constantine is a chain-smoking, hard-drinking guy suffering from terminal lung cancer. He becomes embroiled in a complex war between Heaven and Hell with humanity caught in the middle.<br /><br />Fans of the comic book are probably not going to like this movie. Constantine is supposed to be world-weary, a sarcastic drunk and womanizer but Reeves doesn't quite pull it off. He presents a more sanitized version of the comic book character and even that feels forced. Another major betrayal of the character is having him wield a gun (a cool-looking crucifix shotgun), something that the Constantine of the comic would never do. Reeves is unable sell the character convincingly and is miscast in this role. Guy Pearce or Clive Owen would have been a much better choice to play Constantine.<br /><br />Despite the miscasting of Reeves and Weisz in the two main roles, Lawrence's take on Constantine is actually quite entertaining, even more so if you haven't read the comic book. However, fans of the series will have problems with the major liberties the filmmakers have taken with the characters - especially Constantine and Chas. Like most comic book adaptations, this film only sprinkles certain elements from the source material, just enough to vaguely resemble it while watering it down for mainstream consumption. It's a shame because in the right hands, Constantine could have been this year's Hellboy instead it's closer to the flawed, missed opportunity of The Punisher.<br /><br />On the first DVD there is an audio commentary by Francis Lawrence, producer Akiva Goldsman and screenwriters Kevin Brodbin and Frank Cappello. Lawrence does his best to keep on topic and actually comment on what we are watching while Goldsman does his best to come off as very annoying and unfunny.<br /><br />Also included is a music video for the song \\"Passive\\" by A Perfect Circle. It's pretty standard stuff with the band playing through distorted visuals with lots of clips from the movie.<br /><br />There is also the teaser and theatrical trailer.<br /><br />The catch phrase of the extras on second DVD is how everyone wanted to \\"stay true to the spirit \\"of the comic book. Everyone involved makes a point of defending the changes made from comic to film. \\"Conjuring Constantine\\" traces the character's origins from The Swamp Thing to Hellblazer. Not surprisingly, Alan Moore and Garth Ennis are not interviewed as I'm sure they'd have a few things to say about the liberal changes made.<br /><br />\\"The Production from Hell\\" features Lawrence talking about the pressures of making his first feature film.<br /><br />\\"Imagining the Underworld\\" takes a look at the film's version of Hell. Lawrence wanted it to resemble Los Angeles' highway after a nuclear bomb test explosion. Several other special effects set pieces are examined and shown how they were put together.<br /><br />\\"Constantine Cosmology\\" examines the role mythology plays in the movie and how it compares to the heroic journey according to the writings of Joseph Campbell.<br /><br />\\"Foresight: The Power of Pre-Visualization\\" shows how certain scenes were mapped out in terms ofpoint-of-view, angles, and camera moves via computer animation with an optional audio commentary by Lawrence.<br /><br />Finally, there are four deleted scenes with optional commentary by Lawrence. He talks about why they were cut, usually for reasons of pacing. A character from the comic book, Ellie the demon, was cut from the film and her scene is included.<br /><br />A nice touch with this deluxe edition is the inclusion of a mini-comic book that includes stories by Delano and Ennis.pped out in terms of point-of-view, angles, and camera moves via computer animation with an optional audio commentary by Lawrence. <br /> <br />Finally, there are four deleted scenes with optional commentary by Lawrence.

0767817478|5.0|I loved this movie so much, I watched it about 8-9 times (had nothing to do) and rented it about 3 times and watched it in the threatre once. Why are so many people complaining about this so much? How much acting do you want? Are you looking for an actor that acts like a know it all and does everything right? I mean the movie has action from beginning to end and oh what a fantastic, dramatic, and exciting ending. I even cried when Godzilla died, I even told my gf and yes even though she wants to have nothing to do with me now, fact still stands that people should die and make way for a new more superior species on this planet.  <br /> <br />This movie was great, I thought the actors were pretty well suited to this movie, you don't need really famous actors to make a good movie, I'm getting fad up with seeing actors like Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise etc on the tv anyways. Its nice having a nervous, clumsy, nerdy, dorky sorta guy as the main character, its sort of refreshing and renewing. <br /> <br />Anyhow, Godzilla, I think, is a mutated iguana. Why? Well, it looks like an iguana in many ways and in the beginning, during the nuke testings, you see iguanas running around, therefore giving it an assumption that it was one of the iguana eggs that mutated. However, of course this thing is far from the truth and there are many things that shows that its not exactly an iguana. Iguanas don't eat meat by the way, nor do they lay so many eggs, nor do they run on their hind legs, nor do they like to burrow so much, and many other things. <br /> <br />I guess as it shows, in the end, it is your opinion that counts and not others. I've watched movies that I liked that many others say are bad and I've watched movies that I hate that many others say was great. <br /> <br />I love this movie and who cares what the rest of you think. Its the 21st century, don't expect the old godzilla to succeed any further than it has already. I'm tired of seeing Japanese folks run for their lives and screaming in horror, I think its time to give the Americans and its great nation a chance to do it now.
B00002E23E|5.0|I'm as big a fan of Led Zeppelin as there is.  I live for Jimmy Page's 25+ minute long solos, and John Bonham's pounding drums, and Robert Plant's ear ringing vocals.  If you're a similar Led Zeppelin fan, this legendary DVD is an absolute essential for your collection. <br /> <br /> It combines the band's fascination with fantasy and folklore and their incredible onstage talent and poise.  It also shows glimpses into real life, unedited, unstaged scenarios from the lives of the band members. <br /> <br /> I bought the other live Led Zeppelin DVD, \\"How The West Was Won\\" (an I strongly, strongly recommend that as well for any true Led Zeppelin fan.  John Bonham's amazing 10 minute long improvised drum solo during \\"Moby Dick\\" in this DVD (The Song Remains The Same) is astonishing.  Not only is what he does an amazing physical feat, but an incredible, ingenious musical feat as well.  Jimmy Page gives one of his best performances I have ever seen in his 26 minute long version of Dazed And Confused, playing with the legendary violin bow. <br /> <br />The songs performed on this DVD are: <br />1.  Bron-Yr-Aur (studio version) --- 2:06 <br />2.  Rock And Roll --- 4:02 <br />3.  Celebration Day --- 3:49 <br />4.  The Song Remains The Same --- 5:53 <br />5.  The Rain Song --- 8:25 <br />6.

0790729377|5.0|There are so many superlatives in this movie, it is difficult where to begin. This was one of the first Tennesse William's plays to be cast to screen and was an instant success. Marlon Brando was born in Nebraska, the state that brought Montmogory Clift. At 23, he brought Stanley Kowalsky to screen and transformed it. He was educated at Libertyville High School in Illinois and then sent to Shattuck Military Academy. There he was expelled for indiscipline - that had been his plan. He went to the dramatic workshop of the New School for Social Research in New York in 1943, and studied with Stella Adler, yet he never filled the role of a determined, dedicated actor. On the contrary he boasted of the chanciness of his career, his laziness, and a deep indifference to acting as art or vocation. But he got parts in I Remember Mama (1944), and Truckline Cafe and Candida in 1946. He was amazingly beautiful - there is no other way of saying it, or denying its vital thrust in what happened. He had huge eyes, a wide, deep brow, an angel's mouth, with the upper lip crested. And he could speak, softly, like breathing, so the mouth scarcely moved. But he was as male as a wild animal, hunky, husky, sensual, and incoherent or rhapsodic, depending on which style worked best with the young woman of the moment. Irene Selznick, the producer of A Streetcar Named Desire, had thought of John Garfield or even Burt Lancaster for Stanley. But she had seen Brando in Ben Hecht's A Flag Is Born in 1946 and had been \\"galvanised by his power... however risky, he was bound to be interesting.\\" Elia Kazan, the director, wanted Brando because he knew the actor's radiance would keep Stanley from being just a villain, the trampler upon Blanche Dubois's fragile bloom.<br /><br />It was left to the playwright, Tennessee Williams, to decide. Brando went to see Williams, who was living on Cape Cod. When he got there, both the electricity and the plumbing were out. The actor repaired them both, and then did a reading, with Tennessee taking the other parts. It was 10 minutes before they called Kazan and Ms Selznick and told them yes. Williams wrote to his agent, Audrey Wood: \\"It had not occurred to me before what an excellent value would come through casting a very young actor in the part. It humanises the character of Stanley in that it becomes the brutality or callousness of youth rather than a vicious older man. I don't want to focus guilt or blame particularly on any one character but to have it a tragedy of misunderstanding and insensitivity to others. A new value came out of Brando's reading which was by far the best reading I have ever heard. He seemed to have already created a dimensional character, of the sort that the war has produced among young veterans.\\"<br /><br />There was a latent sense in which Blanche was a male surrogate, the spirit of refinement and gentility, confronted by a far more brutal and modern male force. Kazan was a director of the new breed that needed to find himself in the work. So he identified with Brando's Stanley and a crude upstart vitality reducing the pretentious lady to his own level. The play surpassed its text in production, and in some profound way 1947 was ready for every fantasy that was appealed to.<br /><br />As Kazan saw it, Brando had changed the play - audiences like Stanley more or as much as Blanche (it was only later that Streetcar became a play about Blanche). A kind of rutting force was let loose, a feeling of native American force. Brando was seen on stage half-naked (he had a flawless torso then), discarding a sweaty T-shirt, alive, urgent, unruly and golden. People of both sexes fell for him at the same moment as a classical male persona had been explored or layered, and only Brando could have held the human beast and the brooding angel in balance. It began to be possible for the American hero to be beautiful and not just handsome.<br /><br />There are so many sections about the movie that show the brute force and mean side of him compared to Blanche. Every time he is tampered with by his wife or Blanche, the way he retaliates is ruthless. Though it may not be as realistic in the present day world with women having more power, even women appreciated him and his acting style. The younger generation may not understand the movie, which is sad, as it is not about political correctness but the reality of those times and how petty people can be. Though that form of racism does not exist anymore, calling people \\"Polacks\\", it hurt people a lot. It was the introduction of Brando to the screen with a bang. He was one of the few, who despite quite a few failures could stick on and reinvent himself in different roles later in life. As Jack Nicholson said, \\"Now that he is gone, we can all aspire to go up one step in the acting ladder.\\" It was unfortunate that he did not get his oscar for his role in this movie and it went to Humphrey Bogart in the African Queen. That movie comes nowhere close to this in class and is close to being forgotten. Though Brando won two richly deserved oscars, this movie was one of his crowning achievements.<br /><br />There are so many dialogs in this movie that have been repeated in other movies that it speaks for itself as something that trascends time. Though the transfer is not great, this is one of the great american classics and should be cherished. Kudos to all the actors, director Elia Kazan, Tennessee Williams for the screenplay and the overall production. I hope that they release a 2 disc version of this classic.force and mean side of him compared to Blanche. Every time he is tampered with by his wife or Blanche, the way he retaliates is ruthless.

B00003CXZ4|5.0|This totally unique film is as tough to watch as it is rewarding.<br /><br />See it for yourself, there is nothing like it!
B00012QM9K|4.0|Steven Spielberg has made many good movies but badly wanted a great movie to his credit. The Holocaust is a topic that has its unique and riveting moments. While many movies have tried to capture it, few have come close to reality due to multiple reasons, the brutality, how much to show, collective guilt concept etc. The book written by Thomas Keneally was outstanding and must be read by anyone interested in this topic, it is fiction based on truth and gripping. The movie is beautiful in many ways, it captures some of the harshness and terror of the times but it failes to show who Oscar Schindler was. The book shows how he was as a person right from his childhood to his late life. He had a father who was not faithful to his mother and was resentful of that, but everyone in his family except him knew of how much he was exactly what he hated, a mean, petty, womanizing person.  <br /> <br />There are parts in the book that are more brutal than the movie. I do not think that Spielberg did a good job of understanding the story. There is a part where the Nazi surround the oldest synagogue in Krakow, get the Jews to spit on the scroll. All the orthodox people accept the order but one person who was not religious says to himself, \\"I have not been true to my religion, but I will not do this.\\" and refuses to follow the order. The Nazis gun him down and all the others too and burn down the synagogue. Instead of this scene, the movie had one of someone escaping with a chicken and a kid pointing to a dead person and saying \\"Him\\", which was silly.  <br /> <br />When Schindler failed in his farm in South America, he tried to live in Germany but was hated there and was called a \\"Jew kisser.\\" However, he was treated like a benevolent father in Israel. Whenever he went to Israel he ate at a Romanian restaurant of one of his children who made sure that he did not drink too much. When he died, he was buried in the protestant cemetary in Jerusalem, which is a joke as he was one of the least religious people. While the book brought out both the Holocaust and the human part of Oscar Schindler, the movie did a shoddy job of it. When I first saw the movie, I loved it. However, after I read the book my enthusiasm for the movie diminished substantially. I would still say that the movie is very good as it brought to light a person who would have been unknown to me but would recommend all to read the book. It is one of the best books written in the last twenty years in the literary sense. The movie is well acted and photographed, but not well scripted. The story could have been put together better. There was too much polarization - all Germans are bad, all others are good. While being Jewish myself, I recently saw a documentary of two Czeck Jews who escaped from a concentration camp and told that one of the SS guards told that he hated his job so much that he would rather be transfered to a job in Eastern Europe, which would mean certain death. I understand that this is a movie and it requires a degree of fictionization, but parts of it are historically incorrect and could offend people. Despite this deficiencies, it is a start for great movies such as \\"Life is Beautiful\\" and \\"Pianist\\". However, I do not think that it deserves the rank in AFI top 20 that it got.
B000021Y77|5.0|I don't think I have ever watched a movie move as fast as this one--couldn't believe it when it was over.  It's exciting, innovative, visually perfect, and accompanied by terrific music.  The characters are appealing and interesting.  There was never a slow moment nor a wasted frame.  \\"Run Lola Run\\" is as good as it gets.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|I am so tired of people saying that this amazing record sounds anything like Radiohead. Why must everyone incessantly pick at every artist and compare them to someone else? To me this is a true masterpiece and there is NOTHING like it.<br /><br />Best song of all...Butterflies and Hurricanes. This cd is really amazing and every music lover should hear it.
0440180295|5.0|_Slaughterhouse Five_ is so many things: witty, profoundly sad, moving, humourous, an accusation, a confession, an act of contrition.  The story revolves around Billy Pilgrim, no one special in any particular way, as he bounces around in time: from his experiences in Dresden during World War II to his wedding day, to his kidnapping by the Tralfamadorians and back again.  Through his experiences we learn much about what it is to be human and a little about time. I absolutely loved this book.<br /><br />It is deceptively easy read, but don't be fooled: still waters run deep, as Vonnegut shares a profound insight: \\"Ignore the awful times and concentrate on the good ones.\\"  Highly recommended.
B0002Z0EYK|4.0|and this is only because it is, for the most part, historicaly inaccurate.  Besides the obvious lack of pure historical science, the film is brilliant.  Brad Pitt's protrayal of Achilles (or Akhileus) is right-on, reminiscient of the cocky, god-like Achilles in Homer's \\"The Illiad\\".  The battle scenes contain  good mixture of heroes fighting one another while also depicting the common foot soldier and their conflicts.  Accompanying the battle scene is a great score, thanks to musical producer James Horner.  The emotional aim of the directors', if not evoked by the scenes angles and lighting, etc., definitely is brought on by the music.  Fortunately for viewers, the music is actually just music - the main theme, as revealed in the end credits, actually have lyrics performed by Josh Groban in them.  I'm sure even fans of Mr. Groban would not want to hear his yodeling while watching Trojans and Achaens slaugher each other en masse.  Besides Brad Pitt, the protrayals of the other actors and actresses are commendable, notably Eric Bana.  The movie is also aptly named because it IS NOT central to Achilles, althought it may seem so.  I highly reccommend this movie to everyone, from historical war-junkies to students that are lazy and would like to skip out on reading \\"The Illiad\\".  For those in the latter category, remember it is not historically accurate and the involvment of the Ancient Greco polytheism is downplayed in order for more action to satiate modern day viewers.
B0007M22TI|5.0|When I saw on PBS this video I was petrified and could'nt wait to start searching for the DVD . I found it at a very good price here at Amazon .I order one and the following week I ordered a second one for a friend. <br />  The quality of the production is A plus.An excellent audio recording to analize. The group's performance is unbelievable .This is a DVD to keep for lifetime.
B000007T1M|5.0|system of a down has to be one of the most original and genius bands EVER. Not only do they have awesome talents at singer, guitar, and drums, but their lyrics pack a punch. Their first album was their best album in my opinion, with a lot more heavy metal. <br />The standout songs are the first three: Suite-pee, know, and sugar along with peephole and darts. AWESOME ALBUM!  Daron is CRAZY at guitar...Serj is a CRAZIER vocalist...and john and shavo keep up with the two frontman quite well. 95/100
B000002L7Y|5.0|If your the type of person who has either been involved in the realm of fantastic music since the 80's or more current times, it may seem a bit odd that an album like this has had such a mainstay throughout time. This, by no means should defer you from getting aquainted with the like of A-Ha. Although there is a slight pre-judgement when it comes to A-ha and their talent, one listen to to this album will bring a refreshed train of thought when it comes to the material that this album contains.  To say that this debut is underrated is somewhat of an understatement. A-ha enjoyed huge popularity and exposure on the strength of this debut, but they were never able to put forth a true \\"Fallow Up\\" record. While they did stay in the public eye of both Europe and America for several more years, they suffered a bit from the label of being a one-hit wonder or a one album band. It is true that A-ha were never able to recapture that uplifting spirit of this debut, but it stands very well on its own as one of the most artistic and well crafted albums of the 80's.   I would compare some of the tracks on here to Depeche Mode. The synth arrangements are top knoch with complexity and great musical textures, the lyrics are always a highlight on each track, and the overall feeling that one is left with once the album is finished is that of discovery and joy. This album is a must for all fans of the European electric force that absolutely dominated the entire decade of the 80's. You won't be dissapointed, trust me!
B0008KLW7W|5.0|All I remembered about J.K. Rowling's novel \\"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\\" when I watched the movie was who Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) was in the Harry Potter world. Of course, it is hard not to remember that given the climax of the fifth book. But it is actually the fourth book that comes to mind because that was the novel where Rowling warned that things start to got significantly darker for our hero and it is clear that director Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n has already sent the series off in that direction. Part of the look is visual, with Michael Seresin's cinematography given the old Hogwarts a new look, but there is also the fact that this is the shortest Harry Potter movie to date although each novel has been longer than its predecessors. Screenwriter Steve Kloves has streamlined the story so that the focus is on Harry dealing with the truth about how his parents were betrayed by a friend and sent to their deaths.<br /><br />There are not too many series were the main characters are children played by actors who are growing up as well (the norm is to just forget about the kids in the sequels, like they did in the \\"Jurassic Park\\" series), which also us a sense of how things look different. On the way back to his third year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) learns that Black has escaped from the infamous wizard's prison at Azkaban and that the vile Dementors, the scariest things we have seen to date, who guard the prison are now watching the gates of the school because Harry is his target. The \\"why\\" is even worse for Harry than the idea that there is once again somebody out there trying to kill him.<br /><br />Of course there is a new teacher of Defense Against the Dark Arts, Professor Lupin (David Thewlis), who appears to like Harry; but you never can trust anybody in that particular post. The kids are also taking Divinations, which introduces them to Professor Sybil Trelawney (scene stealing Emma Thompson) and their friend Rubeus Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) will actually be teaching the Care of Magical Creatures class. Those two are in on the primary action this time around, which leaves precious little time for Profesor McGonagall (Maggie Smith) to do anything, although as always we treasure every moment with Professor Snape (Alan Rickamn slowly milking the role of a lifetime for everything it is worth).<br /><br />The best part of \\"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\\" is that in the climax (or should I say climaxes) right by Harry's side is Hermione Granger (Emma Watson), making sure there is one person who is up to speed on what is happening (at least as much as is possible given the massive plot complications in this one). Harry might have the raw talent, but Hermione has the smarts and this time she has ample opportunity to use them. There is no reason at this point to consider replacing any of the actors in the cast, young or old, except for the cold hard reality that has Michael Gambon now playing Albus Dumbledore. If it is all fixed, don't break it.<br /><br />But above all this one comes back to Rowlings, her story, and her characters. Learning magic is not easy and Harry still does not really understand that he is going to be a great wizard, mainly because he is too busy being angry at the world (and he will get a lot angrier in the next couple of movies). This is a story about second chances and not just for Harry (think about it). \\"Prisoner of Azkaban\\" is the least interesting of the three films, and the five books for that matter, in terms of the larger story, especially since what is being set up here is rally being done so Rowling can take it away. But if there is one thing that Cuar&oacute;n convinces us with this film, it is that this is not a kid's story anymore, even if that was how Chris Columbus played it in the first two movies.<br /><br />Where the franchise needs to be careful is that this film has reduced both Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) to comic relief caricatures. Ron, who was so brave at the end of the first film, now gets to shake for fear at the drop of a hat so that we can laugh at him. The film suggests that Ron and Hermione are fated to pair up, but if he keeps acting like this she will have nothing to do with him. Meanwhile, Malfoy acts like a bully without doing anything particularly mean. At this point the difference between Malfoy and his henchboys Crabbe and Goyle is that Draco speaks, but then he usually ends up whining and running away. Yes, replacing a slap with a punch is an interesting upgrade from the book, but then the book sets it up as a small moment of satisfaction against Malfoy's war against Harry; the film treats it more as an element to be played out by the numbers. \\"Prisoner of Azkaban\\" ups the ante on the Harry Potter series, and all of the characters need to put all of their chips on the table from here on in.oy (Tom Felton) to comic relief caricatures.

B00001W9G0|5.0|This is the most amazing movie I have ever seen.  There are so many quotes from this movie that anyone who has ever really been in love, and had it fall apart, can relate to.  I loved the way that Kate didn't give up on Hubble until she had absolutely no choice.  I always wonder, when I watch this movie, what ever happened to their daughter, Rachael?  Was the hospital the only time Hubble ever saw her?  Who did Kate marry?  Did she love him?  Did she wipe the hair from HIS brow? <br /> <br />Loved it, loved it, loved it.  Watch it!
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|This is one of my favorite non-punk CDs.  The best part is Matt's voice.  When he screams it's great, when he actually sings it's great.  He just has an excellent voice on this CD.  \\"Unholy Confessions\\" is a great song.  The screams . . . God how I miss them!  Probably the best song is \\"I Won't See You Tonight (Part 1)\\" in which Matt sings the whole time.  I wish he would have sung like that on \\"City of Evil\\" instead of turning into a disturbing conglomeration of Axl Rose, Mike Patton, and that dude from Velvet Revolver.  Matt's singing voice on WTF, not the screaming now but the actual singing, is incredible.  If you are new to A7X and checked out \\"City of Evil\\" and didn't like it, try \\"Waking the Fallen.\\"  This is a really, really, really good CD.

B00002Z88D|4.0|I've listened to Metallica here and there, but never purchased one of their CDs. I wanted some Metallica to load on my iPod, but since the band decided to protest downloading music from iTunes - I bought this CD. I love classical music. Mixing the stellar guitar rips with the orchestral is chilling. If considering buying a Metallica CD - this is one and the only one to add to your music collection.
B0007CNXUK|5.0|This is a beautiful film.  It is extremely well done and is a wonderful fantasy dedicated to the idea that what we wish life could be can be so if we only believe hard enough.  It is about the writing of Peter Pan by James Matthew Barrie.  We all know that world of make believe and magic this parable has for us as it has had for audiences and readers for more than 100 years.<br /><br />The movie says that its telling of this story is inspired by true events.  Yes, but with great liberties.  It is itself a fantasy of how the story \\"should\\" have been.  I won't bother telling you all the liberties taken with the way life actually was because you can simply search the web for Barrie's full name and find all the biographical detail you want, but like all facts it might destroy some of the beautiful wishing the movie inspires.  So, be careful what it is you want to know.<br /><br />The actors do a splendid job.  While I usually have mixed emotions about Johnny Depp, he is masterful in this performance.  Kate Winslet as the comsumptive Sylvia Llewelyn Davies makes the movie by being the foundation for Barrie's relationship with her boys, the true love of Barrie, however chaste, and the vehicle for the tragedy that makes the ending so poignant and strengthening the argument for making reality through belief.  Julie Christie plays Sylvia's mother who dislikes Barrie and does a great job as the  bucket of cold water on all this make believe stuff.  And Dustin Hoffman brings just the right touch as the good natured impresario who backs Barrie's plays without really understanding what Barrie is really about.<br /><br />So, this is a fable about Barrie and one you might prefer to believe to the reality of the man and the lives of those involved.  Yet, I think you can have both.  What is given us here is something worth experiencing and remembering.  However, it is only the story of the author of Peter Pan in the broad strokes.  Somehow, doesn't making a fantasy about the life of a person who could imagine Neverland seem perfectly appropriate?  Yes, but remembering what it was he really did and how things really happened is also important.<br /><br />But see this film.  It is very well done.ife of a person who could imagine Neverland seem perfectly appropriate?

B000002U6E|5.0|I have followed the Enigma project for a long time, and haven't found myself disappointed with a single release thus far. (That is, considering I am reviewing an older album.) 'The Cross of Changes,' the second chapter in the Enigma project, offers philosophical insight into Micheal Crtu's personal beliefs, in the form of an 'enigmatic' symphony of soft composition and chanson. While each album seems to hold it's own unique interpretation of life, I believe the purpose of this album is to inspire love, peace and wholeness within its listeners. <br /> <br />The lyrical value of 'The Cross of Changes' seems to surpass that of its instrumental quality, which is, at times, rather poor in comparison to some of Micheal's other works. However, the lyrics are reassuring and inspiring, none-the-less, and make the entire experience worthwhile. <br /> <br />Buyers who are curious about Enigma probably shouldn't start with this album, as it seems to be one of those things you appreciate only after hearing some of the latter releases. (In my case, at least.) The first album I purchased was 'Love, Sensuality, Devotion' (the greatest hits album) -- a good start, considering you will get a fair idea of what Enigma is all about. <br /> <br />By the way, I am curious about track number 2 -- everytime I listen to it, I faintly hear Sandra chanting \\"open your heart, and push the limits...\\" in the background, though it could just be my imagination. It's strange that I mention that, because 'Push the Limits' was released after this album.
B00005JNSK|3.0|This film also proves a point about the story: Charlie may be the lead, but Willy steals the show.  I think that is part of the reason the first film was good, but not as honest, or curious.  That film was like a foregone conclusion, it seemed to be a more straight to the screen feel, without the director's creative interpretation, although the title change was a slight one.  One thing that I know a lot of people will harp on is the fact that Johnny Depp was bizarre and Willy Wonka isn't bizarre.  First of all, before I saw the movie I saw the ads and I immediately felt that he was channeling Michael Jackson, well, Roger Ebert seems to agree with me, so we'll just have to find out from Johnny who his stereotype is.  Whatever the case may be, the entrapments are there within the Willy Wonka character.  If you take his character and then compile the things that he has created and what he has done with the whole golden ticket thing, etc, the man is clearly deranged.  Yes, what he created was fantastic and whimisical, but what man would do it?  Could you even dream of telling me that he wasn't a little bit disturbed? The novel hid this little detail from us by capturing the story through the eyes of a humble child who saw the world guilessly and viewed Willy's factory with wonder.  What people are really complaining about is the fact that the film doesn't really take the perspective of a child, the film is more like an overview of aspects of the entire story with another plotline written in to fit a postmodern interpretation of the film.  The film isn't delightful like the book or other movie.  That's not to say the film doesn't have its charms.  I really enjoyed certain aspects of Wonka's character, the fact that he not only had the whimsy of a child, but the temperament as well.  These things fit together for very funny situations.  Augustus was also very funny, and although he was one dimensional, he was a solid character, his gluttony just washed away any room for personality.  It's a shame that he's the first to go.  One thing that I feel Burton gets perfect is the creation of Charlie's family scenes.  They are heartwarming and real, and still funny at times while being viewed through the strange lens of Tim Burton.  I never really cared for the other kids that much, but the girl who was the perfectionist had some really interesting moments with her mother, in some ways her mother could have a movie of her own, she was just so morbid.  Veruca and Mike were both disappointing, in my opinion.  The only thing between the two of them that caught my eye was Stevie's violence against Charlie's wonderland, it was quite scary.  His dad had one of the best performances in this film.  Yes, the oompa loompas were quite annoying towards the end, but at the beginning they were quite refreshing.  One thing about the reason this film isn't a great adaptation is that postmodernism has it's faults as well as weaknesses.  At different times in the film you think back and realize that the film feels like a bunch of afterthoughts instead of a true story that has a clear throughline, and then you really think about it and it's true.  As I said, I found some of them to be funny and entertaining, but it left me cold as well.  Burton must watch his taste for revisionism because he's already made two remakes and neither really standup as stories on film, or as successors, but they do add perspectives. Is it really that interesting to view aspects of a story under a microscope and then creatively guess what the underlying meaning was, writing a script of those ideas, and then make a movie of it.  In my estimation, no, but it does spark conversation and I still hold to the fact Willy Wonka is demented.  Think about it: What would Willy do if all of the kids failed?  Who would he choose then?  It seems as if he's just as irresponsible as a child.  I did enjoy seeing him as a kid with that ridiculously deforming contraption on his head for his teeth andthe morbidly tender moment between him and his father.  All in all, it was worth the money, but not classic.
B0001XWV12|4.0|For anyone who loved the inane teen comedies ROAD TRIP or AMERICAN PIE here comes EUROTRIP, a movie that succeeds in actually insulting a large portion of Europe, but gets you so lost in its sense of fun that you can overlook its lack of diplomatic tact.<br />Graduating from high school Scott seems to have it all, at least he has an incredible looking girlfriend (played in a cameo by SMALLVILLE's Kristin Kreuk). But there he is getting dumped by said girlfriend on the day of graduation and (adding insult to injury) finding out through the lyrics of a rock song (shades of BOYS AND GIRLS here) that she has been cheating on him.<br />Retreating home bruised from this encounter with reality Scott relates his woes to his German penpal - a guy we are told is named Mike.<br />The response comes back flirtatious and spurred on by his best friends homophobic comments Scott insults his transatlantic friend. Its only when he realizes (thanks to his younger brother who seems to know better German than he does) that Mike is actually Mieke and a girl (and girl in the hot shape of Jessica Boehrs at that) that Scott resolves that he must win her at all costs.<br />So there he goes with friend in tow to Europe. Stopping first in London they come into contact and in an unlikely turn of events befriend a group of English soccer hooligans (led by the always fun to watch Vince Vaughn). Making their way across the continent (in a manner which would have made the Griswolds proud) they team up with their vacationing High School friends (which include BUFFY's Michelle Trachtenberg) before Scott can finally confess his true feelings to Mieke.<br />If comedies are rated by how much you actually laugh then EUROTRIP certainly scored with me. Perhaps I was in just a funny mood, but I found moments of the movie to be side splittingly funny. The movie takes some getting started, but once it hits Europe and we are into definite culture clash territory (ala CROCODILE DUNDEE and WHAT A GIRL WANTS) then the laughs come thick and fast.hick and fast.
B000000WG4|5.0|I'll get the bad stuff over with first.  It all occurs in Part 2 as Part 1 is flawless.  Part 2 does fine up to the point of the Scottish march which has the unsurprising ability to put people like myself to sleep.  It's just so boring and dry.  Then comes the infamous \\"Caveman\\" section.  It's not bad but the grunting could have been left out and we would have been left with a fairly decent piece of rock music.  The rest up until approx. 2mins before the end is simply some of the most beautiful and inspiring music you'll ever hear.  It could have left it at that and had a wonderful finish to a remarkable piece of music.  But no, Mike Oldfield decided to ruin it by playing Sailor's Hornpipe, a piece of music so out of place with Tubular Bells it may as well have come from Mars.  It's a terrible ending which is why i always stop it before it comes on.  So there are two really bad bits and one not so bad bit.  The good bits are everything else.  Part 1 is probably the greatest single piece of rock music ever composed.  I know not many will agree with me, fair enough.  Nobody I know (apart from my father) can sit through this 25min masterpiece.  If I'm to single out the standout piece in Part 1 it's when the basses kick at approx. 17mins 20secs.  Play it through a decent hi-fi and I swear you'll never hear bass like it.  That continues until 19mins 47secs when we hear the MC, Viv Stanshall annonce Grand Piano.  And so on until the music reaches the title instrument of the piece.  Apparently, Mike Oldfield got the idea for the title of Tubular Bells when he heard the title being announced dramatically by Viv.  It's a suitable climax to a brilliant piece of music.  I usually put it on when I want to listen to something without having to concentrate on lyrics or when I just want to chill out.  I was surprised by all the negative reviews but I know this is not for everyone.  Can't say much about the album technically except the bass towards the end of part 1 tends to get distorted and fuzzy if played through a hi-fi with heavy bass.  It's not half as bad as the bass in Tubular Bells 2003 which sounds like it was played by a robot.  Avoid the 2003 version if you like the original as it is.  Highly recommended

B0000TAPLA|5.0|Delta Goodrem, a 20 year old songstress from Australia was signed to Sony at the age of 15. It wasn't until 2001 that her first single \\"I don't care\\" was released.Not a major hit, Delta then went onto the Australian soap, \\"Neighbours\\". This is where her talents were really shown and led a path to her debut release of \\"Born to try\\". This was launched on Neighbours and went to number 1 on the ARIA charts and muti platinum. After the success of Born to try, Delta released her second single, \\"Lost without you\\" another great ballad which really showed off Delta's showcase of unique talent. This also went to number 1 on the ARIA charts and multi platinum. After this, Delta's debut Album \\"Innocent Eyes\\" was released which instantly went to Number 1 on the Album ARIA charts.  <br />Innocent Eyes showcases a talent which is beyond incredible. Songs such as \\"Lost Without You\\", \\"Butterfly\\" and \\"Not me, Not I\\" are highlights of the album to name a few.  <br />This album is well worth listening to, but be warned, once you listen, you will want to buy it. Delta has a charm of drawing you to love her catchy songs. <br />I would give the album 10 out of 10- an excellent buy
B0007Z4S4C|5.0|It's so nice to hear that magical voice again after all these years. I'm glad he did this album before he gets to old and loses that awesome sound.
B00005JNTX|5.0|This is the best graphic novel based movie that i have ever seen. the acting is great and it is extremely accurate to the books and is an all around great movie. i highly reccomend this movie to fans of the books, action fans and fans of crime movies. a plus is that it is action packed and has great acting. a negative is that its mainly for more mature audiences and not for kids. great movie.
B00004S6GL|5.0|I'll admit that I got into Elliott's work after he had died. All of the posthumous critical adulation heaped onto him was, I thought for a while, mere typicality on the part of the hipoisie. I liked some of his work early on, but never really \\"got into\\" it until this record, which shimmers with the genius the pop culture pundits spoke of and wrote about. <br />For some reason, the thing that never really got me into Elliott's music was the way he approached his vocals on his records, but alas, I grew older and more cultured. As a musician, myself, I once played (and listened to) a steady diet of generic post-grunge and hard rock, but after diversifying my tastes and discovering the charms of this record, I envy that voice--it's the sympathetic, flawed voice of a true human being who wrote about the people and places he knew. Some of the material on \\"Figure 8\\" might take a bit to grow on some folks, but it's well worth the time one invests. Smith's songwriting does recall Nick Drake, to whom he is often compared, but his vocal melodies and guitar playing remind me a lot of Big Star-era Alex Chilton (just check out the beautifully fingerpicked \\"Somebody I Used To Know\\").  <br />The more I read about Elliott, the more I see writers slagging off his later output, crying \\"sellout,\\" and while recordings like \\"Figure 8\\" aren't as stripped down, intimate as some would say the earlier records are, one must realize that with a bigger budget and better facilities of a major record label, artists can make the records that they dream of making, and I truly believe that some of the later Dreamworks albums, especially this one, were getting closer to realizing Smith's dream of a perfect record, but then again, all of his records are truly beautiful. <br />Most every song on this record could be a radio-worthy track, with \\"Son of Sam,\\" \\"Happiness\\" and \\"Junk Bond Trader\\" being a mere few of the standouts. <br />The arrangements are lush, yes, but after listening to this album, you can almost picture Elliott sitting in a park or a bus stop, with guitar in hand singing \\"Somebody I Used To Know.\\"
B0002YLC24|5.0|I was captivated with every moment of this film.  I loved it so much that when I saw it for the first time in the theatre, I went back to see it again a few nights later.  I love films about conversation but this one will go down as my all time favorite.  The acceleration of both their lives was perfect, believable and exactly how I would have imagined them, that many years later.  The missed meeting at the train was handled as perfectly as it could be.  The way the film handled integrating the previous story into the present made this film a complete package (but of course I went back immediately and viewed my DVD of Before Sunrise).<br /><br />I bought this film as soon as it was released to DVD.  It is such a feelgood film for me...a beacon of hope, a quiet love poem, a spark of light in a dark world.<br /><br />It is so real it almost makes one feel voyeuristic watching it.  Which is part of the unfolding surprise.<br /><br />And that ending.  There will never be an ending to a movie that will compare to this one.  I was left smiling for days...remembering.<br /><br />Thank you for this beautiful film.
B00005YW4H|1.0|Norah Jones has the least distinctive voice in recent history.  In this offering she quavers her way tenuously through several forgettable songs, unimaginatively arranged.  Her pedestrian adult-contemporary is not quite bad enough to be enjoyed ironically, and not nearly good enough to be enjoyed at face value.  Appearing soon in the cut-out bin at your local Sam Goody.  If you enjoy this CD, you may want to consider one or more of the following: Air Supply Greatest Hits, The Best of Bread, or anything by Yanni.
B000092ZYX|4.0|After recording such masterpieces such as \\"The Bends\\", \\"OK Computer\\", and \\"Kid A\\", I was kind of wondering if Radiohead would \\"do it again\\". While that didn't happen either of the future times, this record does sometimes get played by me and is a competent album. It borrows from elements of other albums but to be made into the songs that they become. It's sometimes seen as the sequel to \\"OK\\" but keep in mind that that one is a much better album. It doesn't mean you won't enjoy this album, although I didn't find it perfect at all.    The highpoints are the very good though. \\"2 + 2 = 5\\" starts out in classic Radiohead fashion with its verses, it gets kind of in a dark melody, but then he finally speaks up, with the \\"you have not been paying attention!\\" part, and it just keeps getting better from there. I also love the bridge part. It could have been longer but is fine how it is. \\"Sail to the Moon\\" is a really melodious song, which is kind of a laid back Radiohead song. Then there's \\"Where I End and You Begin\\" which U2 have been afraid to make in the decade, but that's okay because Radiohead seem more expert at mixing electronica and rock, complete with a cool guitar solo even if it sounds more like \\"Achtung Baby\\" than Radiohead. But Thom's vocals is where the track differs from that. \\"There, There\\" is classic Radiohead, partially from genious instrumentation of Johnny Greenwood. \\"I Will\\" is a great track which is mostly vocal-based. I usually don't like those type of songs, but it was well done here, kind of like a simple lullaby or something. Nice, clean guitar. Then there's the great mix of electroclash and rock on the classic \\"Myxamotosis\\" which pretty much makes this record worth owning alone. His voice isn't as whiny here as on other tracks. Plenty of others are worth listening to even if not a description.    Then, there's still a downside. For one thing, the tracklisting seems a bit off. To me, sandwiching \\"Backdrifts\\" between \\"Sail to the Moon\\" and \\"Go to Sleep\\" makes the thing sound really haphazardous. In addition, some of these songs should have been left as b-sides. There is the directionless \\"Sit Down. Stand Up\\" which also doesn't make any sense. I've tried getting into it, but unsuccesfully. Then there's \\"We Suck Young Blood\\" which Thom's voice really annoys me on. Usually I don't mind his voice but this time the vocals are so discombobulated it could be nails on a chalkboard. I will admit that the piano solo is really cool though.    Overall, I think if you are a big Radiohead fan then you should check this out. It is not as consistent as other albums, but isn't as much of a throwback as you'd expect. It is probably darker than those albums although at some points more melodic. I can't tell you that it's perfect but there's enough quality on here to enjoy it in the sum of its parts.
1932100385|5.0|This is a very comprehensive and yet easy to read book on the relationship between diet and health.  Presents the arguements and counter-arguements but will not be readily accepted by the big industry lobby groups.  It thoroughly cuts through attempts by industry to confuse people into complacency.
B0006399FS|1.0|Ok, its U2 with nothing else to offer.  U2 has always had its own distinctive sound without straying much EVER!  The redundancy is insipid, lifeless, and makes me want to never hear Bono's voice again.  Edge's giutar work is also just the same old stuff.   its just so pathetic to see any band wallow in the successes of the past without moving forward and offering anything new to the people.  Don't buy this.  you've already heard it
B000084T18|4.0|On \\"Get Rich or Die Tryin'\\" 50 was a new fledgling rapper with a new major label, and he had something to prove. He showed everybody who he was, a tough rapper from Queens, and he actually had something to say. His only beef here was with Ja Rule, and that was actually pretty entertaining, especially since now 50 makes a beef with every rapper he lays eyes on. He gets some good production and guest appearances from Eminem, Nate Dogg, and the G Unit family. I hope 50 can be remembered for this album rather than for the Massacre, which is terrible, and whatever else he makes from this point on.<br /><br />Pretty much all the tracks here are good to listen to. He really sounds tough here, not all worried about women and his star status like he would be later. \\"What Up Gangsta\\" is good, good chants at the end and all. \\"Patiently Waiting\\" with Eminem is memorable, crazy production, good lyrics by both parties. \\"Many Men\\" was a hit, 50 telling all about his gunshots, why he's here, the whole bit. Everybody's heard \\"In Da Club\\", not much I can say there. \\"Blood Hound\\" is the infamous Ja Rule diss, pretty funny, but he went crazy dissing everybody later. \\"21 Questions\\" was the love song with Nate Dogg, pretty good, but there would be way too much of this on the Massacre. The bonus tracks are all good too, \\"Wanksta\\" being the original single, spawning a new term to the masses, \\"Gotta Make it to Heaven\\", \\"Don't Push Me\\" and \\"Nobody Likes Me\\", a funny song.<br /><br />This actually was a really good album, and I liked it a lot when it first came out. If it sounds like I have a hard time saying it, it's true, because I can't stand what he's done to the hip hop world since its release. Now he's concerned only with women, the pop star lifestyle, and beefing with every rapper he can find, which makes me pretty mad, especially because Nas, Fat Joe, and Jada are all tougher and better than him and have been around longer. He's got nothing left to prove now. 50 did a good job here and would not be able to duplicate it ever again.e and would not be able to duplicate it ever again.
B000001GXF|5.0|I bought the CD primarily to replace an old DATM tape. This performance is breathtaking. It has just the right barely-in-control feeling that the fast movements need, but never loses a note. The slow movement is poignant and heart-rending. <br /> <br />I've only listened to the Trout once, but it also seems near-perfect.
B000002LOM|1.0|I love Morrissey and The Smiths but this is the worst album Morrissey has ever released and quite \\"frankly\\" the worst album ever.  The lyrics are terrible and the song arrangements are even worse.  If it wans't for \\"There Is a Place in Hell...\\" there would not be a redeemable song on this disc.  Quite simply, this is the worst thing Morrissey has ever produced.  He can only hope it goes out of print and every copy of the disc is lost as well as all of the masters of the songs are lost except for the aforementioned.  Terrible.  Burn it in a bonfire--don't buy it.  If anyone disagrees with this assessment of the album they are neither a Morrissey fan nor a person of minmal intelligence.  If they try to defend this work then you might want to throw them in the fire as well.  This thing resigns me to a Neanderthalish \\"ugh.\\"  Thank God he produced some brilliant albums after this or I would have begun to think there was place reserved in hell for him.
B0000DDAU9|5.0|Remission is absolutely an amazing album. I've owned the album since it's release (along with lifesblood and leviathan), and It's definately one of my favourite albums. <BR>One thing: I grow incredibly tired of people calling mastodon &quot;metalcore&quot; and mixing them with the likes of the MTV screamo bands. They have far too much talent and songwriting ability to be even used in the same sentence. So just ignore all comparisons to this trend. <BR>Now, the reason I give remission a 5, is because there's barely anything to compare it to! especially in the wake of the backwards mullet explosion. I could definately go into a long list of subgenres to try to define them (most likely something around doom/stoner/death/grind/southern/.....)  but in reality, the only thing i can compare this album to, is Lifesblood, and Leviathan.<BR>I myself am a musician, so I definately value the many talents found in this band. the first thing that stands out is of course, Brann Dailor's drumming. I absolutely love how he doesn't stick to cliched patterns (ie; the punk/thrash &quot;um pa&quot; or the death metal/grindcore blast and double kick) his love for jazz is very  obvious. Next is the guitar work. Absolutely crushing, but very unique, and unpredictable. Bill and Brent definately know how to work the classic two guitarist lineup, and even work in some very southern rock influenced &quot;licks&quot;.<BR>All in all, Remission is my favourite Mastodon album, followed extremely closely by Leviathan.

B00005JKG7|4.0|I think the people who saw 'The Fog' are divided into two groups. The first group is the group who expected a movie similar to 'Halloween' and looked for the elements, never found them and were disappointed. <br /> <br />Then there's the second group, the group who gave the movie a shot because of the excellent cast and were roped in by the creepy  storyline, great effects and general atmosphere of the movie. Sure, there are elements that make the movie seem dated (the clothes, hairstyles, and automobiles) but that's only on the surface. 'The Fog' has endured the test of time because it's a solid horror movie with a very creative slant to it - THE FOG!
B000021YQV|4.0|This may say 4 stars but really its a 4 1/2. Its a real good album and it gets you pumped up for somethings.

Buy this with Mezmerize and solve 3/4 of the puzzle and expect for Hpnotize to be the complete part of the puzzle.
B00005QW5X|4.0|A very good movie from an even better stage show. Challenges all your hetero perceptions of what gender is, and what's attractive. Hedwig is not initially painted as a very likable character, although you might sympathize with her circumstances. But by the end, you grow to like and admire her, and even cheer for her courage. And  oddly enough, she becomes a more attractive woman as the movie progresses. Interesting, stylish direction from star/writer John Cameron Mitchell and brilliant 80s era songs from Stephen Trask, which echo Bowie and Iggy closely. This one bears repeated viewings, as the many depths and convolutions in the story and lyrics emerge slowly.  <br /> <br />WARNING: DO NOT watch with 5-channel sound. The mix is totally botched. The band sounds like they're in another room. Stick with the original stereo mix. It rocks. And make sure to watch the documentary on the making of the play and the movie.  You'll learn a lot about what's beneath the story.
B0000A0DRY|5.0|(note..this review pertains to the original 12\\" LP, not the remastered CD) <br /> <br />   When I picked up a slightly worn, vinyl copy of Jefferson Airplane's 1967 masterpiece Surrealistic Pillow, I simply thought I was adding a classic rock staple to my little collection. What I ended up getting was what I am here to declare as the ultimate summer record. <br /> I was  moderately familiar with Jefferson Airplane through my Janis Joplin phase. During the `Haight-Ashbury movement' of the sixties, up and comers like Janis, Country Joe and the Fish, the Grateful Dead and Airplane were considered neighbors by today's standards. As a group, these bands brought the hippie mindset to middle America, beginning firstly with Jefferson Airplane and the success of singles like \\"Somebody to Love\\" and \\"White Rabbit\\".  <br />  I really didn't know much else about the Airplane beyond the tidbits I just shared with you. If you find yourself in the same spot, I highly suggest listening to this entire album, for it will trigger a curiosity within like no other. <br /> When I listened to this album for the first time, I did it in probably the best way there possibly could have been. I listened to it whilst doing absolutely nothing on a lazy summer afternoon. After track one, \\"She Has Funny Cars\\", came the roaring, two minute and fifty-four second pile driver that is \\"Somebody to Love\\". The person I was with during this amazing listening session immediately recognized it and seemed to share my opinion that this was a great record. <br />  And so it was. <br /> <br />1.  She Has Funny Cars- - This fantastic album opener is something you would expect to cue up at the beginning of one of those `flashback to the sixties' scenes in a film; a camera panning slowly through the doors of a San Francisco club. The vocal stylings of Marty at first seem a bit bland, but once the wonderful Grace Slick begins to echo, you know that what you are hearing is a unique and innovative sound. <br /> <br />2.  Somebody to Love- - Clearly the biggest hit from the album. The fiery Miss Slick brings the passion to this classic song.  Her voice is truly a classic in itself, somehow making a sexy, maniacal growl a beautiful sound at the same time. <br /> <br />3.  My Best Friend- - This song in particular is what really brings the memories, past and present, of summer in all of it's light, fluffy glory. It really resounds the style of the time, with sounds resembling the Byrds, who were also a popular group during the period.  A simple little ditty, with great harmonizing and musicianship. <br /> <br />4.  Today- - A slow, heat-stricken ballad. The song-writing talents of the Airplane are displayed brilliantly  here. <br /> <br />5.  Comin' Back to Me- - Another ballad, more beautiful than the last. Grace Slick shows the extent of her talents here by adding the recorder as an accompaniment to the guitar slowly being picked. Excellente. <br /> <br />6.  3/5 of a Mile in 10 Seconds- - Despite the cumbersome nature of it's title, \\"3/5 of a Mile\\" flows quite well. Truly a group effort. <br /> <br />7.  D.C.B.A.-25 - - Not one of my favorites. A bit muddled, but still a good contribution to the album's sound as a whole. <br /> <br />8.  How Do You Feel- - Ah. Visions of hippies run through the mind...A cool song which I'm sure a lot of people didn't mind getting high to . \\"Look into her eyes/ She's coming away/\\" . Perfect song for the overall `laid-back' vibe of the record. <br /> <br />9.  Embryonic Journey- - A short little instrumental clocking in at a minute and fifty-one seconds. To me, it seems as though it exists to prepare the listener for the harshness of \\"White Rabbit\\", which follows.  <br /> <br />10.  White Rabbit- - The classic stoner anthem still rings out loudly and proudly to this day. Never had hippie culture been displayed so bluntly to the rest of the world. A truly eerie song (I recall hearing it for the first time a few years ago and being dumbfounded. \\"Didshe just say `you've just had some kind of mushroom'? Holy god.\\") that is an enjoyable and stimulating time from beginning to end. <br /> <br />11.  Plastic Fantastic Lover- - In my opinion, this little rocker, though a good song, wasn't the best closing piece the album could have had. The true, hippie-vibrant sound seemed to fade after \\"How Do You Feel\\", and took a darker turn with \\"White Rabbit\\" . This song is still quite a winner though, and doesn't take away from the record's ambiance and `time-machine' affect on today's listeners. <br /> <br />Overall: This album is summertime perfection. It's perfect for all occasions, whether you be speeding down a deserted highway, or are being a happy, sluggish couch-potato with the ones you care about most.  <br />  The leadership of Grace and Marty truly give Surrealistic Pillow it's timeless sound and ability to transport you to a `cooler' time. This album is, without question, a masterpiece, and I hope to God I am able to find another copy of this, for fear that my record will be worn out by the end of the summer. <br /> <br />-Candace, 16, Seattle
B00005BL2A|1.0|Like many other reviewers, I just thought this album was one big bore. I fail to see how they could give this album such a name that suggests happy, bouncy tunes ala \\"Just Can't Get Enough.\\" Picture \\"Question of Lust\\"- type songs filling an entire album and you will be bored stiff if you're not asleep by the end. Too many downbeat slow songs on one album and you've got a good cure for insomnia. Their recent music has proven they can still produce good tunes (Violator is my all-time favorite, and Songs of Faith and Devotion was pretty good) but this was a real \\"miss.\\" While I hope it's not the death of Depeche it certainly sounds like something reminiscent of a funeral dirge. One star, however, for the nice photo of the band. They haven't changed a whole lot<br /><br />If you must have this album, do yourself a favor and check it out from the library or borrow from a friend first before investing the money.
B0007TKNIS|2.0|I went into this movie really wanting to like it.  I saw the play in Toronto when I was 15 (12 years ago) and I really loved it.  It was the first big play I had ever been to, and I was obsessed with the soundtrack for a year.  I haven't seen the play again since so I would hardly consider myself a \\"phanatic,\\" though I have always enjoyed the music (I have the Canadian cast recording with Colm Wilkinson) and wouldn't mind catching it again.  When I heard about the movie coming out, I was thrilled.  However, upon seeing it (we finished watching it about an hour ago), I have to say I was very disappointed with the results.  <br /> <br /> I thought the acting was fine and even though I don't think Gerry Butler was a phenomenal singer, I liked his passion and craziness.  I always cry at the end (I used to never listen to the final few songs on the soundtrack or else I would break down!) and I felt the tragedy of his character was worth the cry.  I've never really liked the character of Raoul (?) but I thought the actor who played him did a fine job.  Emmy Rossum was great--I won't pretend to know a lot about classical or opera singing, but I think she sounded wonderful.  I didn't realize how young she was, either--what an achievement! <br /> <br />My biggest complaints are with the production.  After watching the first 15 minutes, I turned to my husband and said, \\"this is kinda terrible, isn't it?\\"  I mean, the camera work was extremely boring and made it seem like it was a low budget TV movie.    The whole thing just seemed awkward and contrived.  It was like they simply canned the play and put it on a movie set.  There was no innovation, no creativity put into it whatsover.  Since when can you take a play, a musical especially, and just make it into a movie?  They are two completely different experiences so I would expect there would be some tweaking to make it enjoyable in the other medium.  I'm sure there are many people who are happy because of the music and the beautiful sets, but there still needs to be a fulfilling plot!  And more than just a rehash of the play!  There needs to be feeling, and this just left me cold.  I could've taken or left it after watching it for 20 minutes.  I just didn't get excited about it, it seemed so hollow, and I'm not usually a movie snob or anything.  Like I said, I cried at the end, but I always do (even when just listening to the old soundtrack) and I'm always a sucker for the misunderstood guy.  I guess I just expected more from this big Hollywood production that has been in the works for years.
B0002YLC24|5.0|a great follow up to Linklater's \\"Before Sunrise\\" and i would recommend both to anyone!
B000001FNL|4.0|Here is a Bee Gees album where they got their now-famous falsetto voices in the first place. <br />Listen to the tracks in particular 'Nights On Broadway' and Fanny (Be Tender With My Love)' and you'll know why. <br />Want more?, Listen to the albums Children Of The World, Spirits Having Flown and the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack. <br />
B000002UJQ|5.0|Facts about me:<br /><br />- I don't like 'musical trends' - \\"emo\\", as it's called, is a full-blown subgenre of rock music; I just don't listen to much commercial stuff<br /><br />- I don't like Radiohead's political posturing, the band's 'collective worldview', or the strange and elitest direction their music has moved in since global media decided they were the post-postmodern successors to the Beatles<br /><br />Having said that, this record is great. It rocks and it aches. It just wrestles you into its futuristically bleak automated world and keeps you there for its duration.<br /><br />The opening track is so busy that the listener feels like he has just arrived in a far-off land, and can't quite assimilate all the unfamiliar activity that's taking place around him - but that the business is so immersive as to force him to make sense of his new surroundings and get comfortable quickly. The last track simulates the awakening from a dream - one that seems so real, that is so ageless as to have constructed a complete universe as its backdrop, one from which departure actually makes the dreamer sad, as though he's left an entire lifetime behind.... every song in between will become a memory for the listener - one that he will attach the events in his life to so that (like all great music)whenever he hears these songs again, he will instantly be connected to something collective and universal, and unsettlingly personal still.<br /><br />Just buy it. Buy two, because I've worn out two copies of this, and I need another one now.
015626224X|4.0|Surprisingly, I hadn't read any of Orwell's books before. Instead of starting with '1984', I decided on this one. <br /> <br />Orwell paints a stark and totally realistic portrait of the life of a vagrant in Paris and London. He captures the mannerisms and desperation of men who want a better lot in life, but cannot get it because society has turned its back on them. I almost felt like I was there with Orwell as he stayed in lodging houses, worked menial jobs, and plotted his next move to get some food and shelter. That is probably the highest compliment an author can get. <br /> <br />My only quibble with the book is that the London portion of the book was significantly less entertaining than the Paris portion. Towards the end of the book, Orwell slips into a lot oof preaching about how to improve the lives of tramps, and this drags down the flow of the novel a bit. Plus, he doesn't seem to run into the same sorts of wild and crazy characters that he did in Paris. Perhaps it is because of less diversity in London, but it still dragged a bit.  <br /> <br />That being said, this is a great book, and can still shed light on the plight of the impoverished today.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|I for one think this DVD is AB-FAB. One problem that I seemed to have with this DVD was that when I played in on my computer DVD with Windows Media Player 9 & 10 the sound would waver in and out like someone was slightly playing with the controls. This was annoying and I took back my first DVD purchase copy thinking that I had something to do with the disc. Nope the second one did it too. The reason why I choose to view movies on the computer is because I have a nice sound system hooked up to it, plus the 17\\" monitor screen is larger than our regular 13\\" TV. The DVD plays fine in a regular DVD player. <br />   This week out of necessity I stumbled across the term \\"CoDec\\" for computers that essentially is the computer's ability to decode the coded information on digital media, DVD and music files. It's a little confusing at first but after a while I learned that a good amount of people don't like the way Windows Media Player works. So I disabled that player and downloaded \\"K-Lite Mega Codec Pack\\". There's two media players that come with it and now the sound problem is fixed! It turned out to be a codec problem. Another movie that did this was \\"School of Rock\\". <br />   If you've ever had a problem with a movie's sound then it may pay off to look into getting a better media player and codec pack. <br /> <br />Cheers, <br />Chris B. in Iowa
B00070Q7VO|5.0|Like his self titled first cd, this one is pure listening pleasure. <br />Again it is a cd filled with his warm and velvet tones and incredibly rich orhestration and arrangements.
B000002AHM|5.0|Firstly, if your preference is the smooth-sweet jazz, new age guitar music, this album is definitely not for you. Now, if you like a wider range style of guitar playing or have ever laid your hands on a guitar, take a bow, tip your hat and pay your all due respect to what has been accomplished here. <br /> <br />Step aside Legends of the guitar. This album is, by far, the mecca of all guitar albums and has yet to be surpassed by any other. On this one special night in 1980 in San Francisco, God brought together a trio of born-to-be heavyweight guitarists and let them loose on a stage to play for the world to hear. Thank you God. <br /> <br />Secondly, don't miss the point of this album though. It wasn't meant to be a passionate soulful showing. Not that these guys can't play it, but it was meant to be lots of fun showing and playing off of one another's riffs. This has to be the \\"GREATEST JAM SESSION\\" ever recorded. After all it's a live album. It's supposed be fun. What it does though is leaves listeners wondering how it's even humanly possible to play that cleanly and blazingly quick for that length of time, nevermind, 3 guys at once.  <br /> <br />Lastly, if this album doesn't capture you and take your breath away, then all I can say is, I don't know what will.
B00004VVNB|4.0|Whenever I watch \\"Logan's Run\\", I feel a touch of angst, much as I do when I see \\"Marooned\\"...both films won Oscars for their special effects, and both films would be overshadowed immediately by the vastly superior FX work of \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\", and \\"Star Wars\\". In the case of \\"Logan's Run\\", the nearly 'quaint' minature work is patently artificial, and combined with the 70s hairdos, and 'mall' environment, gives the film a 'retro' feel; fortunately, the story and performances are so terrific that the film is still very entertaining, and has achieved 'cult' status, today.<br /><br />The premise is intriguing; in the 23rd century, civilization has retreated into a computer-controlled, multi-domed city, sealed off from the outside world. Given an impersonal, if hedonistic paradise to live in, there is only one drawback; residents must sacrifice themselves on their 30th birthday, in a quasi-religious ceremony known as Carousel, where, they believe, they might be 'renewed'. A few attempt to escape death, searching for the legendary 'Sanctuary'; the task of executing these 'runners' falls to the 'Sandmen', an elite force of policemen armed with explosive pistols.<br /><br />It's a great life to be a 'Sandman', which friends Logan 5 and Francis 7 (Michael York and Richard Jordan) enjoy to the self-indulgent hilt...until Logan meets Jessica 6 (Jenny Agutter), a beautiful girl wearing the ankh symbolizing an affiliation to the 'runners', who isn't impressed by Logan's nearly 'rock star' status.<br /><br />Logan is secretly assigned by the city computer to find the elusive 'Sanctuary' of the 'runners', and 'aged' to 30, thus giving him an excuse to join them...and making him a 'Sandman' target. The tale then becomes a 'cat-and-mouse' chase, as Logan recruits Jessica's aid, and the pair search for Sanctuary, relentlessly pursued by Francis. Logan discovers that the few runners not dispatched by the 'Sandmen' are executed and frozen by a rather clunky robot, Box (the voice of Roscoe Lee Browne)...after defeating him (rather easily), Logan and Jessica (followed by Francis) break free to the outside world, a wild, untamed wilderness leading to a nearly deserted Washington, D.C., where they meet their first 'old man' (Peter Ustinov), a hermit living alone with a large array of cats. The couple, their relationship deepening to love, must face Francis, and return to the city to expose the fraud that everyone is living under...<br /><br />Casting is EVERYTHING in a movie like this, and the \\"Logan's Run\\" ensemble is terrific. York, a youthful 34, combines innocence and determination as Logan, and Agutter, 23, is all wide-eyed idealism as Jessica, looking very comfortable being barely dressed through much of the picture. Even better is Jordan, who, at 37, is as convincing a younger man as York, in a far more demanding role. While Farrah Fawcett, 29, in a small role, is more flash than talent, Michael Anderson Jr., 32, is wonderfully menacing as a plastic surgeon. Ustinov, 55, steals the picture, cranky and cantankerous, yet lovable. While one might quibble that a man who could memorize T.S. Elliot should understand the words in the Capitol better, he provides an element of reality and a character audiences can relate to.<br /><br />Jerry Goldsmith's remarkable score is certainly a plus, combining traditional and synthetic music, seamlessly.<br /><br />\\"Logan's Run\\" may not be as flashy or 'cutting edge' as \\"Star Wars\\", but it is far sexier (with a healthy dose of nudity), more complex, and definitely worth a spot in your film library!.after defeating him (rather easily), Logan and Jessica (followed by Francis) break free to the outside world, a wild, untamed wilderness leading to a nearly deserted Washington, D.C., where they meet their first 'old man' (Peter Ustinov), a hermit living alone with a large array of cats.

B00005JNBQ|1.0|They gave Napeleon Dynamite 1 1/2 stars and that about all it deserves. While some people who like wasting their precious time may enjoy it, there's a name for those people, we call them idiots. Napoleon Dynamite is a complete waste of time and has defined the phrase, \\"Is it over yet?\\" It's a drag about nothing and I'm still waiting for it to start. I advise you to never even consider seeing this movie.

B000002UAO|5.0|The Beatles were pure COOL and for them it seemed to come so easy.  <br />Rubber Soul! What a work of Art! Starts with DRIVE MY CAR. The <br />song is so hip it freaks me out. But then you find out thats true with so many of their songs. Norwegian Wood, bella, and Pauls bass is delightful. YOU WONT SEE ME, grabs you immediately. <br />NOWHERE MAN, if your in the right mood, can make you cry. IN MY LIFE , a poetic pleasure! <br />The Beatles music touched you emotionally. That was one of the many reasons that they were the cream of the crop. If you worship at the altar of MUSIC you must have this. Nuff said! <br /> (Youngsters), their`s a good reason this music holds up to the test of time with so many people. Cause its friggen great music! <br /> I was a young testosterone driven Male who loved the dynamic WHO, Led Zeppelin, Hendrix, etc. still do.  But don`t refuse yourself this GEM. Listen to the words, the stories. Open yourself <br />up.....PEACE @ LOVE
0060934913|4.0|Who would of thought a few years ago that, in America, chefs would become as popular as rock stars? Thanks to Food Network, Iron Chef, Hells Kitchen and, of course, Bourdain's book, it's hard not to escape this latest fad.  Anthony Bourdain was one of the first to ride this craze with his book \\"Kitchen Confidential\\". In it Bourdain paints himself as a sort of Lou Reed and Keith Richards love child who cooks and despite being a massive \\"f@*! up\\", secures his fame as the head chef at a popular New York restaurant. Bourdain starts with his youth and his love for French food. He works from the ground floor up, in little local restaurants and then with an education at the C.I.A. in New York (the culinary school, not the spy agency).  <br /> <br />After graduation Bourdain chases the all mighty dollar from one needy restaurant to the next. He also chases the dragon and while other chefs around rise to the top like perfect souffls...Bourdain sinks slowly to the bottom and almost ends up super sizing orders. The book is more than his rise and fall and eventual rise, it's also about how restaurants work, and how good food is prepared as well the kitchen culture that can so defined an establishment. <br /> <br />Bourdain is not a great writer, but he is a good one. Some of the chapters seem a bit jumbled and even a tad long, but the book does come together. Bourdain is selling us his world and it's a world that's fascinating to behold.
B00079FUI6|5.0|This show was fanatasic and I think any woman will enjoy the suspense, drama, and subtle humor. The main storyline is about 4 friends and we follow them through their lives. But their lives aren't hum-drum and but no means normal, you'll have to see for yourself!! I don't recommend this show for children, there is some language, violence and quite a few 'adult scenes', if you know what I mean. The seaon starts of with a bang. Literally, Mary Alice, the story's naracter kills herself.
5550155184|4.0|\\"The Da Vinci Code\\" is a multi-layered novel laced with amazing historical and fictional puzzles.  The fast paced tale blends several of histories critical discoveries and controversial conspiracies into a great story with a couple improbable revelations.<br /><br />Robert Langdon, also in \\"[[ASIN:1416524797 Angels & Demons]]\\" by the same author, leads a cast of interesting characters through religious codes spanning millennia of history.  Since the novel is based on credible icons and traditions including current events, the suspense pulls the reader into a web of realistic mystery.  Those intrigued by conspiracy on a religious level will find the research fascinating and thorough.<br /><br />As with about every film-based novel, I would suggest at least not watching the movie prior to reading the book if not forgoing the movie thereby leaving the story entirely to the imagination.<br /><br />Overall the novel is outstanding (borderline between 4 and 5 stars) for any fan of the pseudo-realistic literary genre.  However those of a highly inflexible religious background or intolerant attitude towards religion might want to avoid the selection.<br /><br />Thank you.
B000055Y0X|5.0|...It is not very noticeable, but near the end of the film as Dr. Stanglove battles with his unruly arm while trying to suggest a possible remedy to the apocalyptic plight of the world, it can be seen that \\"Mr. Ambassador\\" starts cracking up in the background.  This occurs about the time when the arm starts propelling Strangelove's wheelchair in aimless directions.  There are many knee slapping moments aside from this one, in which Peter Seller's and the rest of the cast really shine.            I do take issue with some of the other reviewers comments about the darkness of the humor.  To a large extent, I found  the humor was mostly situational, not unlike the legendary TV series Seinfield.  One moment in particular in which this is illustrated is when British officer Mandrake, having information that may well avoid a nuclear holocaust, has to argue with a dimwitted soldier over the shooting of a lock off a pop machine for the necessary change to call the President of the United States.  After losing patents, and berating the office with insults, the officer tells Mandrake, \\"OK, I'll shoot the lock off, but so help me, if you don't get the president of the united states on the line, your going to have to answer to the Coca-Cola Company.\\"  As if in the throws of nuclear a potential nuclear war such a reality is of any importance.                          Admittedly the movie is about nuclear winter and therefore inherently dark, but I would argue that the topic is explored in the most pleasant way possible.
B00005GL0Q|5.0|I must admit that I Love the Beatles. They had the best bass & rythym guitar players in Rockdom. This shows up without question <br />in Revolver & Rubber Soul. The songs grab you because their so dam seductively good. Complex, simple & beautiful. Eric Clapton sez John was one of the best rythym guitar players. John & Paul`s rythym section was the creative force of so many great songs that we know and Love. In rock music no one went where they went... Louis Armstrong took jazz in a different direction. Haydn took classical music to a new direction, Mozart took it to greater heights. In Rock the Beatles Ruled from 1963-70. Their influence undeniable. They ruled because they were so damn good! That should be easy to understand. Please don`t argue over which is <br />their best album-CD, cause so many were excellent!.... Micheal Stipe of R.E.M and Kurt Cobain both loved the Beatles. They hung together, Kurt would lamet how Nirvaner was undeserving of all the worshipping from their music devotees. The Beatles deserved that kind of love not Nirvaner. THATS what Kurt said!...I love the Stones ,Hendrix, The Who, Byrds, Kinks, Beach Boys,Love, Doors, Led, Tull,Procol Harum, Eagles, Fleetwood Mac,Pink Floyd, <br />Dylan,Berry, Holly,Marley,Cars,U2,The Band,Lovin Spoonful and on and on. ..But those Beatles were different. Genuine Genius.... The class is beginning students of the Gift of this Music. Get Revolver and your journey will began. <br />

I've been a long time Celtic /Irish music fan and have a pretty good size collection of most of the \\"biggies\\" in the field....it's time for them all to move over. This is the best CD in my collection. It has moved me like few things have ever done before. I've already purchased my tickets for the Ladies San Diego concert appearance...just wish I could make time fly by a little bit quicker. Trust me...buy the CD...you'll be soooo glad you did !!! <br />                        Tucson Tim
B00007AJF8|5.0|Watching a film written by Charlie Kaufman is to understand what it's like to be a cinephile.  I mean, for somebody to dedicate so much of their life to the observation of others (if only for a couple of hours), there has to be a certain sense of self loathing, a desire to be somebody else, to get outside one's own head.  I certainly know that this is the case with me, and probably the reason why I've spent more time watching, reading, writing and now making films about the lives of others, rather than just living my own. <br /> <br />But what happens when life and art begin to merge, so much so that they become indecipherable from one another?  That's the subject of the first film collaboration between Kaufman and director Spike Jonze (whose real name is Adam Spiegel).  If you haven't seen the movie yet, this all must sound terribly pretentious.  Trust me, it isn't.  It's actually a hilarious film, and one that's not nearly as \\"arty\\" as it's reputation would have you believe. <br /> <br />The protagonist of the movie is Craig Schwartz (John Cusack in his best performance to date), thou I use the term protagonist very loosely.  He's actually quite creepy, in the mold of a Rupert Pubkin, but seems oblivious of this fact, which is what makes him such a tragic figure in the end.  Struggling to secure work as a puppeteer, he eventually relents to his wife's gentle suggestion that he look for work outside the field of puppetry.  In one particularly funny scene, he goes to her for comfort after being slugged by a man who took offense at his sexual suggestive puppet show (a forerunner to Team America: World Police), and she says to him, \\"Oh, Craig.  Not again.\\"  Anybody who's ever experience professional rejection will immediately understand where his character is coming from. <br /> <br />Eventually, he settles on a job as a filing clerk and develops a crush on his verbally abusive co-worker, Maxine.  And though she shows little or no interest in him and is hardly the cultural beauty you'd expect to find in such a role, we understand his attraction immediately.  Much of this can be attributed to Catherine Keener, who emotes such a casual coolness that it becomes difficult to separate her from the character, a fact which has dogged her to this day (at least in my mind).  In fact, she's so desirable that even Craig's sexually-confused wife, Lotte, joins in on the Maxine obsession.  This after Craig shows her a portal into the mind of John Malkovich.  The two begin to date, but only when Lotte's inside the Malkovich vessel.  Craig, watching his wife carry on an illicit affair with the object of his affection, stews, and after a couple of encounters, which last only fifteen minutes (an obvious homage to Andy Warhols' theory on fame), he intercedes, tying up his wife and taking her place inside Malkovich's head. <br /> <br />Got it?  No?  Good.  Now you'll just have to see the movie.  Because trust me, there's no review that could do proper justice to the genius that is Being John Malkovich.  It's a film that reflects our ever-growing fascination with celebrity, even one as arbitrary as Malkovich himself.  That's not to say he isn't a fascinating character, he is, just that he's one I have a hard time imagining the readers of People magazine or Us Weekly identifying with.  Or as Bob Shaye, the head of New Line Cinema, put it, \\"Being John Malkovich?  Why can't it be Tom Cruise?\\"  But to those of us living in the fly-over states, out of the glare of New York and L.A., we understand that it doesn't really matter, we'll attach ourselves to any celebrity, no matter how small.  This is a point proven by the fact that my local newspaper recently ran a cover story on a former resident (who lived two counties over, no less!) simply because he had a brief cameo in the recent Michael Bay picture, The Island.  For better or worse, this is what our country has become, and this film is a near-flawess comment on that.
B000063V8T|5.0|Nominated for 58 Emmys, including one for Outstanding Drama Series, Star Trek: The Next Generation fulfilled all the potential and promise anticipated of a long-awaited successor to the original 1960s series - Star Trek. Created by a former L.A. police officer, Gene Roddenberry, the Star Trek TV series morphed into a franchise famous for the unprecedented fanatical devotion of its audience. Lasting only three seasons during its original network run, Star Trek struck gold with its syndicated reruns, launching a number of motion pictures featuring the original cast as well as novels, comic books, collectibles, and reams of Star Trek-related memorabilia. Star Trek: The Next Generation (1987) became the first TV series to follow on the heels of the original, and its success would spark the creation of three additional series - Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (1993), Star Trek: Voyager (1995), and Star Trek: Enterprise (2001). But The Next Generation remained the most popular spin-off. Despite new characters and new episodes, the mission remained the same as before - \\"to boldly go where no man has gone before...\\" And to continue the rich tradition of the Star Trek name - a mission Star Trek: The Next Generation accomplishes with relative ease... <br /> <br />Star Trek: The Next Generation takes place in the 24th Century, almost one-hundred years after Captain Kirk's crew set out to explore strange new worlds. Capt. Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart - I Claudius) commands the USS Enterprise-D and its diverse crew of humans, cyborgs, and varying life forms. Accompanying him on his voyage is an entirely new cast of passengers and crew including Commander William T. Riker (Jonathan Frakes - North & South), Lt. Commander Data (Brent Spiner), Lt. Commander Geordi La Forge (LeVar Burton), Lt. Tasha Yar (Denise Crosby), Lt. Worf (Michael Dorn), Dr. Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden), and her son Ensign Wesley Crusher (Wil Wheaton)... Together, they struggle against numerous obstacles tocarry out the mission of the USS Enterprise: \\"To explore strange new worlds... To seek out new life; new civilizations... To boldly go where no one has gone before!\\" This pioneering attitude, coupled with imaginative and brilliantly-produced alien worlds, provides Star Trek with its unique allure and special place within American pop culture - especially those episodes from the original series, widely regarded as the most popular of the Star Trek franchise... <br /> <br />The Star Trek: The Next Generation (Season 5) DVD features a number of exciting episodes including the season premiere \\"Redemption\\" in which Capt. Picard postulates that the Romulans are behind the recent outbreak of civil war within the Klingon Empire, and he must persuade the Federation to intervene before the war annihilates the Klingon Empire and cripples their ally... Other notable episodes from Season 5 include \\"A Matter of Time\\" in which a man who claims to be from the future visits the USS Enterprise, and \\"The First Duty\\" in which the performance of an outlawed and dangerous maneuver by Starfleet Academy cadets leads to a scandal, with Wesley caught in the middle... <br /> <br />Below is a list of episodes included on the Star Trek: The Next Generation (Season 5) DVD: <br /> <br />Episode 101 (Redemption) <br />Episode 102 (Darmok) <br />Episode 103 (Ensign Ro) <br />Episode 104 (Silicon Avatar) <br />Episode 105 (Disaster) <br />Episode 106 (The Game)  <br />Episode 107 (Unification: Part 1) <br />Episode 108 (Unification: Part 2)  <br />Episode 109 (A Matter of Time)  <br />Episode 110 (New Ground) <br />Episode 111 (Hero Worship) <br />Episode 112 (Violations) <br />Episode 113 (The Masterpiece Society) <br />Episode 114 (Conundrum) <br />Episode 115 (Power Play) <br />Episode 116 (Ethics) <br />Episode 117 (The Outcast) <br />Episode 118 (Cause and Effect) <br />Episode 119 (The First Duty) <br />Episode 120 (Cost of Living) <br />Episode 121 (The Perfect Mate) <br />Episode 122 (Imaginary Friend) <br />Episode 123 (I, Borg) <br />Episode 124 (The Next Phase) <br />Episode 125 (The Inner Light) <br />Episode 126 (Time's Arrow) <br /> <br />The DVD Report

0141301120|4.0|I first read this book in the second grade and, as a fan of both space travel and Dahl's other books, I loved it.  Looking back over nearly 20 years, I'm struck by one of the story's minor characters--specifically, the President of the United States.  The book's POTUS is an incompetent, immature boob controlled by his Vice President, who he addresses as \\"Nanny.\\" <br /> <br />Obviously, this bookis a work of fiction, and a scenario like the one I just described couldn't possibly happen in real life--or could it? ;-) <br /> <br />It's for this reason that I don't foresee a movie version of this book--which could potentially boast some awesome special effects--being made before 2009.
B00014NE62|5.0|There is excellent chemistry among the cast members.  Hugh Grant actually gives a riveting performance as a closeted upper-class homosexual, and he does so without the slightest ounce of cuteness (a quality that always annoyed me in his American film appearances).  James Wilby more than holds his own as the title character, and his unpolished good looks makes him a sympathetic and identifiable figure.  Rupert Graves, on the other hand, almost steals the entire movie.  It would have been easy to cast him as the typical lower-class bloke with one-sided motives, but this film gives his character so much depth that you cheer for him almost as much as the title character.  The settings are excellent, and they really reflect the inner conflicts within each character's psyche.  I like this film more than other gay-themed films because it showed a longing for intimacy, rather than a need for sexual immediacy.  While the film can be criticized for including some male nudity, it was actually captured tastefully, and treated as a natural (rather than strictly erotic) occurrence.  I recommend this film to those who are new to the gay-themed film genre, as it shows not only a different chapter in gay world history, but also how the genre itself has evolved.
B0001CCXZW|5.0|Nominated for 1 Emmy and 1 Golden Globe in its first five seasons, Gilmore Girls has experienced much greater success among TV viewers than among industry critics. In fact, the show is the first script supported by the Family Friendly Forum's script development fund to go on and become a regular television series. Part of an initiative between The WB Network - maker of such hits as Dawson's Creek (1998), Felicity (1998), Angel (1999), and Smallville (2001) - and fellow industry executives, this push for more family-oriented programming resulted in a series showcasing a unique mother-daughter bond and the various people they encounter on their life voyage of discovery. Set in the fictional town of Stars Hollow, Connecticut, Gilmore Girls utilizes many of the same sets as the hit series The Dukes Of Hazzard (1979) - another successful Warner Brothers production from years past... <br /> <br />Gilmore Girls is set in a small idyllic community in Connecticut filled with a wide range of diverse characters and eccentric personalities. Against this backdrop, Lorelai Gilmore (Lauren Graham) attempts to raise her daughter and best friend, Rory Gilmore (Alexis Bledel), to carve out a better life for herself. Having made a number of youthful mistakes, Lorelai made the decision to raise her daughter by herself at a young age (the same age as Rory when the series begins), and she's bound and determined to make sure that Rory makes better decisions for herself. As Rory prepares to go off to college, she displays many of the same likes and dislikes as her mother - especially when it comes to the opposite sex, and that's what worries Lorelai the most... A borderline soap opera, Gilmore Girls is more of a serial drama that focuses on the love, friendship, and shared growth of a mother and daughter as they live out their dreams in modern day America... <br /> <br />The Gilmore Girls (Season 1) DVD features a number of touching episodes including the series premiere in which Rory is accepted to a very prestigious prep school named Chilton. But Lorelai struggles to come up with the tuition money necessary to send her, so she contacts her estranged parents for a loan. They agree to provide Rory with the tuition if Lorelai will agree to have a family dinner with them every Friday. Meanwhile, Rory has developed a crush on a recent transfer student, making her apprehensive about attending Chilton. When Lorelai finds out that a boy is the source of Rory's uncertainty, the two get in a fight with Lorelai fearing that Rory will follow in her own path of bad decisions. However, after the family dinner with Lorelai's parents, Rory realizes the sacrifice her mother has made in asking for the loan, and the two make up... Other notable episodes from Season 1 include \\"Forgiveness and Stuff\\" in which a feuding Rory and Lorelai settle their differences just in time for Christmas, and \\"The Third Lorelai\\" in which Emily opposes her mother-in-law's offer to set up a trust fund for Rory because she's afraid it will mean an end to her contact with her granddaughter... <br /> <br />Below is a list of episodes included on the Gilmore Girls (Season 1) DVD: <br /> <br />Episode 1 (Pilot)  <br />Episode 2 (The Lorelais' First Day at Chilton)  <br />Episode 3 (Kill Me Now)  <br />Episode 4 (The Deer Hunters)  <br />Episode 5 (Cinnamon's Wake)  <br />Episode 6 (Rory's Birthday Parties)  <br />Episode 7 (Kiss and Tell)  <br />Episode 8 (Love and War and Snow)  <br />Episode 9 (Rory's Dance)  <br />Episode 10 (Forgiveness and Stuff)  <br />Episode 11 (Paris is Burning)  <br />Episode 12 (Double Date)  <br />Episode 13 (Concert Interruptus)  <br />Episode 14 (That Damn Donna Reed)  <br />Episode 15 (Christopher Returns)  <br />Episode 16 (Star-Crossed Lovers and Other Strangers)  <br />Episode 17 (The Breakup, Part 2)  <br />Episode 18 (The Third Lorelai)  <br />Episode 19 (Emily in Wonderland)  <br />Episode 20 (P.S. I Lo...)  <br />Episode 21 (Love, Daisies, and Troubadours)  <br /> <br />The DVD Report
B0009RCPY8|4.0|Well, this isn't packed with special features, but it's sure worth more than two stars. After all, what do you expect for a double-feature (each film is in its own thin-pak case) plus episodes of the cartoon (which it will be great to reminisce while watching, by the way) and a scrapbook at such a low price?<br /><br />The real treat that home theater enthusiasts and most people with eyes will appreciate is that the transfers have been remastered and are marvelous-looking. That alone makes this a good companion to the old discs (KEEP THE OLD RELEASES because the video commentary from the first Ghostbusters DVD isn't on this new one and the neither are theatrical trailers). e-mail me for a link to  comparison pics of the transfer upgrades! Worth an upgrade for home theater enthusiasts and fans of the cartoon (and fans of cool gimmick packaging, too, I guess!).

B0007CNXUK|5.0|Some movies are great because of their fine acting, some because of their fascinating stories, others because of their depth of character and still others because of the moods they evoke.  And then there are those rare films that seem to have it all.<br /><br />This movie has it all.<br /><br />From amazing performances, to believable and likeable characters, to a fascinating, original storyline, to laughter and tears, Finding Neverland does not disappoint on any level.<br /><br />Johnny Depp is truly amazing.  There is no other actor who can create original characters and make them multidimensional the way Depp can.  Depp's Barrie is a shy, sensitive, creative genius filled with warmth and humor. I can't imagine any other actor who could play Barrie with that kind of believability.  Pitt?  Too shallow and untested.  Cruise?  Too self-involved.  Crowe?  Too rough around the edges.  (Pay attention during the parlor scene in Sylvia's house when James relates to Sylvia the story of his mother after the death of James's brother.  He has never spoken of his unique fantasy--Neverland--to anyone before this, he tells her.  Depp's delivery is remarkable.  Watch the subtle movements in his expression.  The eyes, the shy smile.  Incredible.)<br /><br />And Kate Winslet puts in an outstanding performance as Sylvia, a woman who has her priorities in the right places.  She made me want to go home, trade my PC for Play-Doh and spend my time with my kids.<br /><br />Although I don't think Depp and Winslet are an obvious couple, and there's never anything physical between Sylvia and James, the depth of love shown by these characters is obvious and genuine. Once again, it would be hard to picture other actors in their places.<br /><br />Freddie Highmore's performance as Peter is garnering all the attention, and rightfully so, but all the boys are extraordinary.  They are so convincing that it is hard to believe these boys are from the present century.  There's not a one who doesn't represent his character as if he were in fact a Llewellyn Davies.<br /><br />The scenery and the music also evoke another, more innocent era, strengthening the mood of the film.<br /><br />Even the fringe characters--Radha Mitchell as cold Mary Barrie, Dustin Hoffman as James's dry-humored business manager, and Julie Christie as Sylvia's stern, protective mother--hit the mark.<br /><br />And director Marc Forster was robbed of an opportunity to win an Oscar, having not even been nominated.  The scenes are so original, so well-thought-through, they are Oscar worthy by far.<br /><br />Anyone who appreciates a warm story filled with rich performances will find Finding Neverland rewarding.doesn't represent his character as if he were in fact a Llewellyn Davies.   <br /> <br />The scenery and the music also evoke another, more innocent era, strengthening the mood of the film.   <br /> <br />Even the fringe characters--Radha Mitchell as cold Mary Barrie, Dustin Hoffman as James's dry-humored business manager, and Julie Christie as Sylvia's stern, protective mother--hit the mark. <br /> <br />And director Marc Forster was robbed of an opportunity to win an Oscar, having not even been nominated.

B00005JA2B|5.0|This is the bands finest hour. Leftoverture starts off with the ever popular Carry On Wayward Son. I can remember hearing this song on my cousin's turntable way back in the mid-70's ... it blew me away ... not only was the song a masterpiece, but it was (sound wise) a very clean and crisp recording. I thought the recording couldn't sound any better; I was wrong, Jeff Glixman and Jeff Magid did an outstanding job of re-mastering the entire album.<br /><br />This cd is great from start to finish, after C.O.W.S. the album continues with the soothing song The Wall, which has the best lyrics on the album, which is rock solid in that category. By the end of the song you will have thought that Kerry Livgren crawled inside your head and read your mind one day while you were pondering life. The third track, What's On My Mind, is a great rock song, Walsh sounds so passionate, singing the song with such authority. The fourth track is my favorite KANSAS song ever ... brilliant, brilliant, brilliant!!! A prog-rock song gets no better than this. A+ lyrically, Steve and Robby sound beautiful, and instrumentally the band lets it all hang out. I never get tired of hearing this one. The next track, Opus Insert, IMO is very GENESIS like in structure and sound ... great prog-rock song. Questions Of My Childhood is short in length, but it packs a powerful punch. Again, KANSAS sounds a lot like GENESIS here or vies versa. Cheyenne Anthem follows; although it is my least favorite number on the album, I still like it ... very bold track. The original release ended with the song Magnum Opus, which is the longest song time wise, at over 8 minutes, but you're definitely wanting more even after those 8+ minutes ... excellent way to end the album.<br /><br />Extras include 2 live energy filled tracks C.O.W.S. & Cheyenne Anthem.<br /><br />Awesome cd, great re-mastering job (you actually can hear a difference than in the original release).  Definitely worth the $10 asking price here at Amazon.azon. <br />

B0009Q0F5U|4.0|To start, I got this soundtrack simply because of \\"Shape of Things to Come\\" and \\"Pascagalia\\".  Those two tracks alone are worth the price.  What Bear McCreary does that is refreshing is he takes the standard TV music score and turns it from a simple music cue to feel sad or anxious or happy into an experience in itself--something to be enjoyed independently of the action on the screen.  Particularly with the pieces from \\"Kobol's Last Gleaming\\", he creates orchestral pieces that more than stand on their own as simply enjoyable works.  McCreary's music adds a richness to the show that hard to qualify; it's just...there being awesome.  Not too bombastic, techno, or new agey, it's always just right.

My guess is that the studios didn't know how to market it, and because it stars Adam Sandler, they decided to market it as a comedy, which is a huge mistake. I consider this film to be a drama with comedic elements...but if you're looking for the goofy style comedy of past Adam Sandler films, you're in for a huge disappointment. <br /> <br />It's a shame, really, because this film doesn't fit any neat category. It must be viewed with an open mind (and an open heart wouldn't hurt either). There are some unbelievable stretches that don't work...such as the marriage between Adam Sandler and Tea Leoni. Throughout the whole film, I wondered why they were even a couple. They had little in common and clashed about everything, particularly the role of parental responsibility. If I hadn't seen \\"The Family Man\\" where I actually loved Tea Leoni's performance in that film, I would not have been impressed with her here. She plays a very annoying, obsessive and eccentric mother/housewife, who acts without thinking. She's impulsive, intense, and downright irritating. Self-absorbed/self-obsessed to pay any attention to her daughter or husband. I simply couldn't figure her out and her eccentric behavior only made me empathize with Adam Sandler even more. <br /> <br />Adam Sandler does seem out of place in a film like this. As often is the case, he plays the likeable hero whom audiences love. This film is a bit of a stretch, as he plays a father, husband, and award-winning chef. The last part really strained credibility with me. Together, as a couple, Sandler and Leoni are affluent Los Angeles suburbanites who can afford a fulltime housekeeper, played wonderfully by Paz Vega. This film belongs to Paz Vega, as the POV is from her daughter and the focus sits square onher shoulders. She is an amazing find and the reason why I rate this film so high. She has an uncanny resemblance to actress Penelope Cruz and if any Hollywood moguls are reading this review, those two should play sisters in some film one day!!! <br /> <br />The clash of cultures begin when the housekeeper Flor (Paz Vega) begins to work, as she doesn't speak English and the family doesn't speak Spanish. They get by with all manner of comedic misunderstandings, until Flor decides to learn English. What surprises me with this film is that it moves in a certain direction that makes you think where it will end up, yet turns in a surprising way that is actually profound. Ultimately, this film is about boundaries. The American family are too inconsiderate of their housekeeper as they try to \\"Americanize\\" her daughter in a way the mother doesn't approve, so she has to decide how best to maintain the sense of boundary and self-respect. The other surprise of this film is Cloris Leachmann, who is a wonderful actress in her own right and she gives the best advice any mother could give a daughter (she plays the alcoholic mother of Tea Leoni's character). I would have loved to see a larger role for her in this film, but she is a joy to watch in every scene she's in. <br /> <br />The reason why I give it a perfect score of 5 stars is because of actresses Paz Vega, Cloris Leachman, and the two girls who play the daughters; along with the surprising turns this film makes; and the overall message one receives at the end of the movie. Quite profound on the clash of cultures, the nature of families, and how best to handle temptations. It is a remarkable film that should have been better advertised to find the right audience. People expecting a typical Adam Sandler comedy will naturally be disappointed, but people expecting a drama with some humor will most likely surprised, in a good way.
B00000JSJC|5.0|I've been a fan of this film for years, way before I even knew what  is was called (came across it many a late nights).<br /><br />\\"Strange Days\\" is an awesome movie, a thiller set in the not so distant future. (Well at the time it was filmed, now it's 5 years in the past.). What I love is that it's character driven, Angela Basset is amazing. She's a strong character, yet fragile at the same time.<br /><br />The soundtrack for this film is a keeper. It's totally in pace with the movie, and keeps things going.<br /><br />These characters have so much thrown at them because of a single event. It's kind of hard to ge lost in this film, but that's what makes is so good. You can feel what the characters are going through.<br /><br />Trust me, this is one hell of a movie.
B0002Y4TOM|5.0|Nominated for 1 Emmy and 1 Golden Globe in its first five seasons, Gilmore Girls has experienced much greater success among TV viewers than among industry critics. In fact, the show is the first script supported by the Family Friendly Forum's script development fund to go on and become a regular television series. Part of an initiative between The WB Network - maker of such hits as Dawson's Creek (1998), Felicity (1998), Angel (1999), and Smallville (2001) - and fellow industry executives, this push for more family-oriented programming resulted in a series showcasing a unique mother-daughter bond and the various people they encounter on their life voyage of discovery. Set in the fictional town of Stars Hollow, Connecticut, Gilmore Girls utilizes many of the same sets as the hit series The Dukes Of Hazzard (1979) - another successful Warner Brothers production from years past... <br /> <br />Gilmore Girls is set in a small idyllic community in Connecticut filled with a wide range of diverse characters and eccentric personalities. Against this backdrop, Lorelai Gilmore (Lauren Graham) attempts to raise her daughter and best friend, Rory Gilmore (Alexis Bledel), to carve out a better life for herself. Having made a number of youthful mistakes, Lorelai made the decision to raise her daughter by herself at a young age (the same age as Rory when the series begins), and she's bound and determined to make sure that Rory makes better decisions for herself. As Rory prepares to go off to college, she displays many of the same likes and dislikes as her mother - especially when it comes to the opposite sex, and that's what worries Lorelai the most... A borderline soap opera, Gilmore Girls is more of a serial drama that focuses on the love, friendship, and shared growth of a mother and daughter as they live out their dreams in modern day America... <br /> <br />The Gilmore Girls (Season 2) DVD features a number of touching episodes including the season premiere \\"Sadie, Sadie\\" inwhich Lorelai accepts Max's marriage proposal and tells everyone except her parents the good news. In the meantime, Rory brings Dean to her grandparent's house to celebrate Rory's academic success at Chilton, only to have Richard castigate Dean for his lack of ambition. Meanwhile, Emily is heartbroken when she learns of her daughter's wedding from Sookie instead of Lorelai... Other notable episodes from Season 2 include \\"The Ins and Outs of Inns\\" in which Lorelai and Sookie decide to follow their dream to buy and run an inn (but encounter complications in finding the right property), and \\"There's the Rub\\" in which Emily and Lorelai bond while taking a weekend spa... <br /> <br />Below is a list of episodes included on the Gilmore Girls (Season 2) DVD: <br /> <br />Episode 22 (Sadie, Sadie) <br />Episode 23 (Hammers and Veils) <br />Episode 24 (Red Light on the Wedding Night) <br />Episode 25 (The Road Trip to Harvard) <br />Episode 26 (Nick & Nora/Sid & Nancy) <br />Episode 27 (Presenting Lorelai Gilmore) <br />Episode 28 (Like Mother, Like Daughter) <br />Episode 29 (The Ins and Outs of Inns) <br />Episode 30 (Run Away, Little Boy) <br />Episode 31 (The Bracebridge Dinner) <br />Episode 32 (Secrets and Loans) <br />Episode 33 (Richard in Stars Hollow) <br />Episode 34 (A-Tisket, A-Tasket) <br />Episode 35 (It Should've Been Lorelai) <br />Episode 36 (Lost and Found) <br />Episode 37 (There's the Rub) <br />Episode 38 (Dead Uncles and Vegetables) <br />Episode 39 (Back in the Saddle Again) <br />Episode 40 (Teach Me Tonight) <br />Episode 41 (Help Wanted) <br />Episode 42 (Lorelai's Graduation Day) <br />Episode 43 (I Can't Get Started) <br /> <br />The DVD Report
0786890754|1.0|Last week I picked up two books from the library: Good Grief by Lolly Winston and PS, I Love You by Cecelia Ahern.  I like to read books with similar themes back to back.  I read Good Grief in about three days.  I lost my father in high school , whom I was very close to, so I have expereinced grief myself as well as watched my mother experience it.  What Winston writes is very real and true.  Two chapters into Ahern's book, I cannot stand to read anymore, it is so ill-conceived.  Apparently the Ahern didn't do any research or experience profound grief herself, or if she did, she then lacks the talent and skill to write about it.  PS I Love You is annoying and presumptuous.  If you want to read a novel and understand, empathize, or relate to someone's grief, turn to Good Grief rather than PS, I Love You.
B00079FUI6|5.0|The best thing about third-place networks is that in their desperation for a hit, they are willing to take risks that pay off for the viewers. This happened in 2000 when third-rank CBS took risks with reality shows \\"Survivor\\" and \\"Big Brother\\" along with heavily advertised \\"CSI\\". Those three shows helped CBS vault its way to the top. Interesting that not only did the other networks pass on \\"Desperate Housewives\\", but so did a few of the cable channels. Whoever at ABC greenlighted this show deserves a huge promotion, as this show represents one of the freshest, cleverest shows on TV right now. I'm glad they are releasing season 1 on DVD, as the shows are already certain to become classics. A few memorable scenes include Lynette getting into the swimming pool with her fancy dress to retrieve her rambunctious boys at a wake for neighber Mary Alice, who opened the show with a suicide; Teri Hatcher accidentally burning down her rival's house; Bree Van De Kamp insulting her husband at the dinner table by telling her friends what he does after they make love; Lynette deciding to teach her boys a lesson by leaving them stranded for a few minutes until they are taken in by a \\"mean\\" lady, and my personal favorite: watching Edie wash her car in a scene reminiscent of the car washing scene in \\"Cool Hand Luke\\". Very sexy!!! <br /> <br />The actresses are the reason to watch this show, as \\"Desperate Housewives\\" picks up where \\"Knots Landing\\" left off. Even Nicolette Sheridan of \\"Knots Landing\\" fame shows up on Wisteria Lane to play the vixen role that gets under Teri Hatcher's skin as they compete for the single stud of the hood, Mike Delfino (played by James Denton). This show plays up the mystery and twists and turns all season long, yet never straying far from the original mystery: why did Mary Alice kill herself? What secret is she hoping to take to her grave? By the season finale, everything is tied up in a brilliant, surprising way. Unlike \\"Twin Peaks\\", which stretched theoriginal mystery far beyond the patience of viewers, this show satisfies as it adds layers of nuance in between its cutting humor and satire. <br /> <br />My favorite character by far is Lynette (played by Felicity Huffman) as the former corporate climber who decides to become a full-time mother when she has five children under 8 years old (including three rambunctious boys). She is often frazzled as her husband is clueless. Season 2 is set-up nicely with a role reversal between Lynette and Tom, as Tom will take on the stay-at-home dad and we'll see if he manages any better. Every episode, Lynette shines as a person trying to make family life work, though she's in way over her head. She's smart, tough, and one gets the feeling that her husband Tom doesn't fully appreciate all she does for their family. So that is a story line I'm most interested in watching develop in season 2. <br /> <br />In the looks department, Eva Longoria is the hottest of the Desperate Housewives and she uses it to full advantage. Her husband is always suspicious of her every intention, but comes across as dumb if he isn't able to figure out that the young gardener is the one who tends more than their yard. I love the interplay between Eva's character and her husband's. They are a couple who should never have married. Both are selfish in their own right, she for material goods, he for bragging rights. Their games of one-upmanship does get intense at times, but I always end up rooting for Eva. She's a master manipulator, and it doesn't hurt that she's so easy to stare at! <br /> <br />Ultimately though, this show has been a great boon to Teri Hatcher, who I thought was the best and only reason to watch \\"Lois and Clark\\" a decade ago. She needed to find the right role and this show is it. I'm glad her career has rebounded because of this hit and I'm equally glad that someone at ABC was desperate enough to take the kind of risk most networks are afraid to take. There is no other show on the air like this one and that's a good thing. We certainly don't need anymore \\"Law and Order\\" and \\"CSI\\" spinoffs, sitcoms, cop shows, medical shows, or reality shows. A good satire about the way we live, with its undercurrents of mystery mixed with clever humor, is all too rare on TV. For those who don't get this show, well, maybe the satire is over your head. The point of the show is to poke a little fun at the way we live our lives...that constant need to keep up with the Joneses at the expense of truly knowing what our own hearts desire. That's what makes us desperate in the end.
B000063DIH|4.0|Yes it truly happened. I think that an album only deserves the top of the  charts when its perfect. Iron Maiden made some mistakes in ths cd,but  not enough to harm the final result.  It was the last work with Bruce Dickinson before Blaze Bayley's era.  I didn't like very much Bruce scratching his voice . He doesn't show his  true talent with it. He sounds better without alterations. He wanted to  seem creepy or rageful, maybe. Song commets, ratings:      Be quick or be dead -> One personal favourite song from the band. The videoclip  is one of the coolest ever done, Bruce's gestures fit with the lyrics( Don't let the  people, or bad politicians control you and you will be \\"dead\\").  David Murray's solo in 2:44 is more than awesome, one of my favourites in  whole Maiden's history. 10/10    From here to eternity -> This song has almost no value for two reasons: The satanic  lyrics: \\"Hell ain't bad a place, hell is from here to eternity\\" -> How come?  Dickinson's vocals in this is one of the worst I've ever heard.  The guitar distortions by Gers is the only interesting stuff.  The group wasted time doing a clip for it. 4/10    Afraid to shoot strangers -> The first half is in a slow pace(good). The second  contains catchy solos (mainly by Janick) and Bruce repeating \\"Afraid, afraid to shoot   strangers, afraid...\\" . The inspiration was taken from the Gulf war in the first half of 1990s   9.5/10    Fear is the Key -> Be afraid of this track. It's crap, the riffs remember  Led Zeppelin's \\"Whole Lotta love\\".  0/10    Childhood's end -> Excellent, perfect guitar harmony.  10/10    Wasting love -> One of the best ballads ever recorded by Iron. This one plays  on the radio until today. Bruce sung it brilliantly and it's a classic. 10/10    The fugitive -> I like these lines: \\"I am a fugitive, being hunted down like game\\"  We can find guitar distortions again, the chorus is fantastic.  That David solo in 3:49 has the same complexity as the one in Chains of Misery. It's crazyness, man!  To lo lo lum lo ro lum lo l ro r ru ro ro ron, notes intensity rises  and then To lo lo lum lo ro lum lo lo LAAAUM!! 10/10    Chains of misery -> Its a bit melodic like the predecessor.   Dave's solo from 2:13 to 2:45 (with some some Janick's help at the end)has no price! Goooosh!!!   I do love it! Why does the band doesn't play it live?  I'd love to watch David doing that stuff. This solo was a huge help for David Murray becoming one my guitar heroes! 9/10    The apparition -> I hate it. The melody is repetitive.   Even the \\"messy\\" guitar work in the middle doesn't save it.  Please,skip. 1/10    Judas be my guide -> A favourite. The chorus is very good(the bridge too).  The whole guitar work is attractive. The harmony solo in 1:51 is beautiful.  Another cool David solo: 2:14    I going to cipher this one. I love it! 10/10    Weekend warrior -> This track is normal,ok. I don't have many ideas about it.  8/10    Fear of the dark -> This an anthem, of course. The band plays it almost every concert. Almost every fan know it or like it.   I like Bruce's interpretation in \\"I have a constant fear that something's always NEARR\\"   Pay attention to the distortion in 4:18 by Gers. I saw in a site about ciphers and tablatures that this song is in top 10 on askings.   10/10 (People would kill me if didn't give this 10, but it deserves)    Listen to the good songs in the album and ....    UP THE IRONS!!
B000063V8S|5.0|Nominated for 58 Emmys, including one for Outstanding Drama Series, Star Trek: The Next Generation fulfilled all the potential and promise anticipated of a long-awaited successor to the original 1960s series - Star Trek. Created by a former L.A. police officer, Gene Roddenberry, the Star Trek TV series morphed into a franchise famous for the unprecedented fanatical devotion of its audience. Lasting only three seasons during its original network run, Star Trek struck gold with its syndicated reruns, launching a number of motion pictures featuring the original cast as well as novels, comic books, collectibles, and reams of Star Trek-related memorabilia. Star Trek: The Next Generation (1987) became the first TV series to follow on the heels of the original, and its success would spark the creation of three additional series - Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (1993), Star Trek: Voyager (1995), and Star Trek: Enterprise (2001). But The Next Generation remained the most popular spin-off. Despite new characters and new episodes, the mission remained the same as before - \\"to boldly go where no man has gone before...\\" And to continue the rich tradition of the Star Trek name - a mission Star Trek: The Next Generation accomplishes with relative ease... <br /> <br />Star Trek: The Next Generation takes place in the 24th Century, almost one-hundred years after Captain Kirk's crew set out to explore strange new worlds.

Together, they struggle against numerous obstacles tocarry out the mission of the USS Enterprise: \\"To explore strange new worlds... To seek out new life; new civilizations... To boldly go where no one has gone before!\\" This pioneering attitude, coupled with imaginative and brilliantly-produced alien worlds, provides Star Trek with its unique allure and special place within American pop culture - especially those episodes from the original series, widely regarded as the most popular of the Star Trek franchise... <br /> <br />The Star Trek: The Next Generation (Season 4) DVD features a number of exciting episodes including the season premiere \\"The Best of Both Worlds\\" in which Commander Riker and the crew of the Enterprise must save the Earth from a massive Borg invasion led by Capt.

0553382179|3.0|I really appreciated the methods in this book.  The website and e-mails are pretty good as well.  All of it has helped me manage a home with a busy lifestyle.  However, I don't appreciate the idea that everything I do in life has some larger meaning.  Actually, I just want to be better at keeping my house presentable.  I don't need inspirational phrases and acronyms to remind of what I'm supposedly really trying to accomplish.  I found the book to be more directed at family and a conservative christian lifestyle.  Some of us don't have children and others aren't even married.  Many of us aren't interested in hearing about God in regard to organization and cleaning.  All of that said I really do recommend the book but only if you are able to overlook those annoyances above as I was able to do.  Or better yet if that style appeals to you, you won't have to.
B0000C9JCM|5.0|I truly find this compilation of fifteen different arrangements consisting of piano, orchestra, flute, guitar, vocal, etc. to be of absolute profound quality. This is a brilliant and creative assortment and it magnifies my appreciation for the Cannon in D. The listener is provided with over an hour of exquisite, listening pleasure and it is most enjoyable. I have much admiration for the various symphonic orchestras and I also enjoy listening to the flute played by James Galway on track two, the piano duo on track three, and the shakuhachi and koto quintet on track eight. My only suggestion is that the appearance of the Cd should reflect the professional quality of the music contained therein. The animal drawings just may not appeal to some buyers.

B0009KA7BS|3.0|I'm a longtime fan of the Hellblazer comic, and I understand the agitation of purists who consider this to be a desecration of a great storyline. That being said, I didn't hate this movie.  <br /> <br />If the studio had used the foresight to properly cast this movie (Rachel Weisz was good casting, Keanu...well, suffice to say he's NOT John Constantine) and place it in London where it belongs, then this film could have been a keeper. <br /> <br />This movie is a slippery slope. If you're familiar with the story, and cant see past the 'interpretation', then you'll hate it. If you're unfamiliar with the story, you wont get it and you'll probably hate it. However, if you're open to seeing Constantine as a dark haired, black coated, exorcist for hire in Los Angeles as opposed to the blonde, khaki trench coat-wearing, brittish occultist that he really is, you'll probably enjoy it. <br /> <br />Bottom line is that they screwed this movie up by trying to Americanize it, but if you're a fan it's worth watching.
B000929AJQ|5.0|And yes, it's good. But if your expecting something harsher like Downward Spiral, or as powerful as The Fragile, you're going to be let down. With the possible exception of \\"You Know What You Are\\", Reznor seems to have lost his razor edge that scared you and yet made you want to listen to the CD even more. The lyrics aren't as powerful (except maybe \\"Right Where It Belongs\\", but that's something totally different anyways). And the synths seem to be a lot more \\"radio-friendly\\". But I have to admit, before I heard any of his other albums, I was totally in love with With Teeth. It's just that it seems that Reznor has taken a step down. <br /> <br />I'll just go with a song by song rating. <br /> <br />1) All The Love In The World - 10/10. I loved this track from the first play. Easily one of the best songs on the track. Slow build up to a crazy piano backed finish, which is simply beautiful. I still love this track. <br /> <br />2) You Know What You Are 8.5/10 - Reminiescent of Downward Spiral's completely. Lyrics are very powerful as well, and a little scary. What is it that could make him so...crazy? mad? Very nice end as well, once again it works well with the song. <br /> <br />3) The Collector 7/10 - Nothing stand out here honestly, except maybe whispering \\"every last one\\" at the end. <br /> <br />4) The Hand That Feeds 9/10 - Arg! What happened to the crazy synths? This is kinda plain in comparison... But besides that, this is a great song. Catchy as heck. When he shouts \\"Will you bite the hand that feeds you? Will you stay down on your knees?\\" you want to shout right along with him. The lyrics are kinda dissapointing compared to previous stuff, though. Nothing that makes you want to say \\"Wow, that's scary.\\" or rivet your attention. <br /> <br />5) Love Is Not Enough 7.5/10 - Lyrics are a bit more powerful here, but the melody quite honestly is a little dull.  <br /> <br />6) Every Day Is Exactly The Same 9.5/10 Oh yes. For a song that you just want to sing alongwith (and probably miss a few notes for that matter :P), this one has no equal. Melody somewhat like All The Love In  The World, slowly building up to a crazy climax. Once again, lyrics seem to be missing the razor edge that made him famous. <br /> <br />7) With Teeth ?/10 This is the oddball track. I can't decide whether to like or hate this one. The background is remarkably... strange. It's ... different then everything else. Him shouting \\"a-with-a-teeth-a\\" is, reading over the reviews, very controversial, but myself I like it. The piano intermission is nice, but it would be nice if I could actually hear what he was saying without making it blast when the synths and drums return. <br /> <br />8) Only 9/10 One of the two tracks that I immidately liked. Probably not as good a choice for single as Everyday, but man I have to admit I love that music video nonetheless. Freakin awesome. Anyways, back on topic. He decides to almost speak the lyrics up until the chorus, which is a decision he hasn't done since Pretty Hate Machine - but it was a good one. Lyrics are better here. Synths very nice and work great with the singing.  <br /> <br />9) Getting Smaller 8/10 Nothing outstanding here, but then again it's not bad work either. Lyrics are pretty good - closer to \\"razor\\" (as I deem it, anyways) but not quite there. <br /> <br />10) Sunspots 10/10 Ah yes. Sunspots. Slow build up here to a very strong end with his voice as primary instrument, but there is an almost annoying noise in the background - but I love this track nonetheless. Lyrics are also pretty dang good. <br /> <br />11) The Line Begins To Blur 7/10 Not very impressive - he's kinda overdone this by now.  (Really, it's tracks like these that make me inclined to say that WT is not as good as his previous tracks, that is, tDS and TF didn't HAVE bad tracks - or even mediocre ones) <br /> <br />12) Beside You In Time 6/10 Argh! Slow, takes a lot of time to build up and in the end you find out it was hardly worth the wait anyways.  <br /> <br />13) Right Where It Belongs 9.5/10 Very good lyrics - scary, at times. He has some great and haunting touches - like the beautiful part where everything comes clear, and the live audience near the end. <br /> <br />In conclusion, if your going to start listening to Nine Inch Nails, I reccommend Pretty Hate Machine - it's the most accessible. But if you want to get the best impression of With Teeth, listen to if before you listen to anything else NIN - once you do, you'll realize that it seems that something is missing.
B00009V8Z9|4.0|This CD is one that really grows on the listener.  Don't judge it by the cover songs such as \\"Chariot.\\"  Although I have grown to enjoy this track, it might lead one to believe that this is a bubble gum album.  In truth, you will soon discover that Gavin DeGraw is an extremely soulful talented singer and songwriter as well as a musician.  His voice often conveys the pain and longing that only a true artist can display.  He does occasionally flirt with lighthearted poppish lyrics, but all of  that is overshadowed by the passion conveyed when belting out the vocals.  Try not to pay attention to some of the reviewers here who have described his lyrics as \\"stupid.\\"  I am always leery of any written statement that shows lack of creativity by using the term \\"stupid\\" anyway.  If you enjoy an artist who pours his heart out and leaves it with you, this CD is for you.
B0007OY2MG|5.0|Nominated for 1 Emmy and 1 Golden Globe in its first five seasons, Gilmore Girls has experienced much greater success among TV viewers than among industry critics. In fact, the show is the first script supported by the Family Friendly Forum's script development fund to go on and become a regular television series. Part of an initiative between The WB Network - maker of such hits as Dawson's Creek (1998), Felicity (1998), Angel (1999), and Smallville (2001) - and fellow industry executives, this push for more family-oriented programming resulted in a series showcasing a unique mother-daughter bond and the various people they encounter on their life voyage of discovery. Set in the fictional town of Stars Hollow, Connecticut, Gilmore Girls utilizes many of the same sets as the hit series The Dukes Of Hazzard (1979) - another successful Warner Brothers production from years past... <br /> <br />Gilmore Girls is set in a small idyllic community in Connecticut filled with a wide range of diverse characters and eccentric personalities. Against this backdrop, Lorelai Gilmore (Lauren Graham) attempts to raise her daughter and best friend, Rory Gilmore (Alexis Bledel), to carve out a better life for herself. Having made a number of youthful mistakes, Lorelai made the decision to raise her daughter by herself at a young age (the same age as Rory when the series begins), and she's bound and determined to make sure that Rory makes better decisions for herself. As Rory prepares to go off to college, she displays many of the same likes and dislikes as her mother - especially when it comes to the opposite sex, and that's what worries Lorelai the most... A borderline soap opera, Gilmore Girls is more of a serial drama that focuses on the love, friendship, and shared growth of a mother and daughter as they live out their dreams in modern day America... <br /> <br />The Gilmore Girls (Season 3) DVD features a number of touching episodes including the season premiere \\"Those Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days\\" in which everyone's relationship is a source for debate. Rory and Lorelai discuss the merits of Jess versus Dean, while Lorelai's parents debate her relationship with Christopher. Meanwhile, Sookie and Jackson argue over the proper way to decorate their house... Other notable episodes from Season 3 include \\"A Deep-Fried Korean Thanksgiving\\" in which Lorelai and Rory eat four different Thanksgiving dinners (including a tofu turkey!), and \\"Happy Birthday, Baby\\" in which Lorelai's parents are ecstatic to learn of Rory's decision to attend Yale, but Emily is angry with Richard when Lorelai pays off their loan because she thinks it will mean the end of her relationship with Lorelai and Rory... <br /> <br />Below is a list of episodes included on the Gilmore Girls (Season 3) DVD: <br /> <br />Episode 44 (Those Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days) <br />Episode 45 (Haunted Leg) <br />Episode 46 (Application Anxiety) <br />Episode 47 (One's Got Class and the Other One Dyes) <br />Episode 48 (Eight O'Clock at the Oasis) <br />Episode 49 (Take the Deviled Eggs...) <br />Episode 50 (They Shoot Gilmore's, Don't They?) <br />Episode 51 (Let the Games Begin) <br />Episode 52 (A Deep-Fried Korean Thanksgiving) <br />Episode 53 (That'll Do, Pig) <br />Episode 54 (I Solemnly Swear) <br />Episode 55 (Lorelai Out of Water) <br />Episode 56 (Dear Emily and Richard) <br />Episode 57 (Swan Song) <br />Episode 58 (Face-Off) <br />Episode 59 (The Big One) <br />Episode 60 (A Tale of Poes and Fire) <br />Episode 61 (Happy Birthday, Baby) <br />Episode 62 (Keg! Max!) <br />Episode 63 (Say Goodnight, Gracie) <br />Episode 64 (Here Comes the Son) <br />Episode 65 (Those are Strings, Pinocchio) <br /> <br />The DVD Report
B000068CNX|3.0|Judging by the reviews for this DVD, a lot of people have a lot of affection for the second season of Friends.  It's easy to see why - the smoldering romance between Ross and Rachel finally (!) materialises, Joey becomes a real star with a regular spot on \\"Days of Our Lives,\\" and Tom Sellick arrives as a semi-regular as Monica's boyfriend.  The last point is important - this season has the best guest star list of any season.  Especially notable, in addition to Sellick, are Julia Roberts as an old classmate of Chandler's and Brooke Shields as a fan stalking Joey.  The other highlight of this season is the appearance of the first flashback show (The One with the Prom Video), establishing the friendship between Rachel, Monica, and Ross in high school, when Monica was a LOT heavier than she is in the present.  Monica's \\"fat suit\\" is a great prop, and worth the price of admission by itself! <br /> <br />Unfortunately, much of the season is annoying.  It is manipulative, cloying, and artificial.  No sooner have Ross and Rachel got together then they are split up by an arbitrary and stupid plotline that stretches out over several more episodes.  This is quite aside from the fact that Ross callously tosses aside his very likeable girlfriend, which makes him mean and  unlikeable.  In fact, the whole soap-opera aspect of the first half of this season soured me on the show so much in its original run that I stopped watching it for the rest of season 2 and the entirety of season 3. <br /> <br />That was my loss, of course, because once the Ross-Rachel plotline resolved itself, the shows became as enjoyable and funny as those in Season 1.  So, it's worth the effort suffering through 5 or 6 painful episodes to get to the good stuff later in the season.  As for this DVD package, it's pretty thin when compared to such DVD's as The Simpsons.  There are a few extras - a couple commentaries, a couple other featurettes, but nothing spectacular.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I'm not usually a 5-star giving kind of gal, but after watching the entire series in three nights I can't get Firefly out of my head.  The show had the great elements of all Joss Whedon shows - imagination, quirk, wit, intriguing & well-drawn characters, and unexpected storylines.  I don't like Westerns and am picky about my SciFi, but Firefly isn't pigeonholed into either category.  Give the series a few shows to hook you in and enjoy the ride. <br /> <br />Recommend for: 18 to 45 year olds that like the unexpected series; or, any fan of other Joss Whedon shows <br /> <br />Word to the Wise:  If your TV watching consist mainly of  <br />30-min sitcoms on mainstream stations, this series may not be for you. <br /> <br />My favorite TV series: Alias, Six Feet Under, 24, Sex & The City, and now Firefly

B00028HBKM|5.0|I am the Senior Pastor of Lake Almanor Community Church in Northern California. I first saw \\"The Passion of The Christ\\" movie on 1/5/04, with other pastors from around the country and Mel Gibson himself present and interviewed after the presentation. Here are some of my thoughts and his, as I detailed them to my congregation one month BEFORE the movie was even released to the public. I believe my review is even more relevant one year later...  <br /> <br />I believe this movie will bring the person and death of Jesus Christ to our world like few others have done in the past. It will reintroduce what Jesus endured to our own post-Christian country. Though embellished by Gibson in a few parts, it is a substantially more accurate account and vivid depiction of what Jesus endured during the last hours of His earthly life than most other films about Christ. It is the best film on Jesus I've ever seen, even though it focused largely on the last twelve hours of His life. It was a very descriptive and moving motion picture. Even though it was filmed in three languages of Jesus day (Aramaic, Hebrew, and Latin) with English subscripts, I was mesmerized by the power of the visual message. Do you want to know the Truth about the sufferings and crucifixion? See the film!  <br /> <br />The Passion Of The Christ is a biblical retelling of the betrayal, trials, suffering, and crucifixion of Jesus Christ, detailing the last 12 hours of His earthly life, artfully intertwining flashbacks to earlier moments in His life and ministry. The film is a project in which Gibson invested 12 years of his life and $25 million dollars of his own funds. As a director and Academy Award-Winning Actor, Gibson, who is credited with such movies as Braveheart, The Patriot, and Forever Young, explained to our pastoral audience, \\"I had to do this movie. It was a calling, I did not have a choice.\\"  <br /> <br />Nationally known Christian leaders like Billy Graham, Chuck Colson, James Dobson, and Bill Brighthave endorsed this movie as one of the most truthful and inspiring depictions of Christ's suffering and death on film to date. I agree. For this reason, it has been rated R for \\"graphic violence. In this case, rated R stands more for Realistic. Nevertheless, I strongly urge adults to preview the movie before bringing younger people to see it. I think the content is too graphic or mature for all children 12 or under.  <br /> <br />After the preview concluded, Gibson was interviewed by nationally known Christian author and award-winning journalist, Lee Strobel (\\"The Case For Christ\\"). While Strobel's questions covered a wide range of serious topics about this biblical drama, Gibson often brought the crowd of clergy to laughter with his lighthearted humor. For example, Strobel asked Gibson, \\"Why did you choose the actor Jim Caviezel to play the role of Jesus? Gibson wittingly answered, It's because he's thirty-three years old and his initials are J.C.!\\"  <br /> <br />On a more solemn note, when asked about the criticism the movie is already receiving from some Jews, Muslims, and theological liberals, Gibson replied, \\"I'm sorry if some people are offended by the truth. The film is historically true, though I did take some poetic license in a few parts. My concern in making the film was to be authentic, right down to cultural customs and practices. Other films about Jesus haven't always done that. At times they have even depicted him with blonde hair and blue eyes. My film is based upon the historical accounts of the Bible. I don't understand those people who don't believe the Bible as history. The Gospel writers were eyewitnesses. It's not only history; it's the Word of God. I didn't make this up! I also consulted with many bible scholars about the film.\\"  <br /> <br />As far as the personal reasons for producing this film, Gibson passionately confessed, \\"The film was born at a turning point in my life 12 years ago, when I was literally looking down from a 15-story window. Something wasn't right. I had all the fame and money in the world, but I had to make a choice, whether or not getting out of this frying pan was just jumping into another. At that point, I re-examined the Truth. Christ's wounds healed my wounds.\\"  <br /> <br />Speaking of movie reviews, I completed a 10-CD message series at Lake Almanor Community Church (where I pastor), answering the 9 most asked questions by Americans about Gibson's movie and Jesus, titled, \\"The Passion Of The Christ: True Or False?.\\" (1) What was Jesus' crime? (2) Who was Jesus really? (3) Why did Jesus have to suffer and die? (4) Can a person who lived 2000 years ago really free me from my past? (5) Is Jesus the only way to God? (6) Is the Bible reliable and truthful? (7) How can I follow a God I will eventually disappoint? (8) Who killed Jesus? (9) Did Jesus really rise from the dead? In my answers to these questions I give the historical, archaeological, and manuscript evidence for Jesus, who He was, what He did, and why His death has importance for your life. You can order the message series through our web page at lacconline.org or by calling the Church at 530-596-3683. (By the way, I don't make one dime on any of the sales. I made the series because I believe the average American doesn't know how much real evidence there is for Jesus. Unfortunately, most announce verdicts about Jesus without truly looking at the evidence.)  <br /> <br />Bottom line, see the movie. Then read The Book!  <br />
B000001ESJ|5.0|I don't know what to say. In all honesty, I don't. I believe that this, hands down, shows what Rush does best (along with Permanent Waves, which is another story). I don't think this is one of those flowing albums...this is one with classics on it, in my eyes anyways. <br /> <br />1. A Farewell to Kings - This song, one of their best, shows not necessarily the theme or style of the other songs on the disc, but shows the new sound they have developed since the stunning hard rock piece 2112. <br /> <br />2. Xanadu - Screw the Rime of the Ancient Mariner, we all know Coleridge wrote better, it's right here! This song is a slight reworking of his famous poem Kubla Khan, both of which mention Xanadu, Kubla Khan, the sacred river Alph, dining on honeydew, drinking the milk of paradise, etc. An epic in the grain of Yes but that does not bore. In my opinion it is their second-best epic piece. <br /> <br />3. Closer to the Heart - Where to begin...this is the only other Rush song really played on the radio besides Tom Sawyer, for good reason. It's only 2:58 long, and it shows musical and lyrical prowess over most bands. The only versions to have are this one or, my favorite, the live version from Different Stages that has the jam at the end... <br /> <br />4. Cinderella Man - The best version to be had on Different Stages, but aside from that and all those \\"pretentious\\" epics, this one rocks hard. It also includes Geddy's best lyrics, as it was penned by him. This is one to sing along to because the lyrics are, dare I say, catchy? A rocker in the truest sense that shows off Alex Lifeson's guitar. <br /> <br />5. Madrigal - A short folksy-type tune that isn't actually that bad, and it also gives you a slight breather before listening to the most intense song they ever wrote. My only dislike is that annoyingly-high synth noise from the start of the song. <br /> <br />6. Cygnus X-1 - This is an insanely disgusting amalgam of the best musical prowess that Rush ever put togetherin epic form. There aren't many breaks from the pounding bassline (probably Geddy's best) or the atmosperic-turned-growling and crunchy arpeggios on the guitar, all while Neil waits patiently, pounding  out short bursts and crashes from his kit. If any Rush song is pretentious, it's this one...some people look at it as childish, which I do partially agree with. So what? It's damn good and they give it their all, esp. Geddy, with what is his first stunning vocal performance. The climax of the piece (an what sends chills down my spine every time I hear it) is at the very end when the ship is sucked in, Geddy lets out the most bloodcurdling wail of a banshee I've ever heard, which proves they do exist. Their best epic at 10:25. <br /> <br />So, all in all, I feel I tried to do this album justice, and I hope you will too by grabbing it and listening to what you hear...if you are a fan of Rush this is their most easily accessible piece of prog they made, and also their best.
B000819PKC|5.0|I normally buy alternative music but I am an old fan of Jamiroquai and had to listen to this new CD.  Oh my gosh, this is hot!  This music is a blast and Jay Kay sounds great!  I played it for the first time while doing my run on the treadmill and it pushed me to a higher level.  This music is so much fun I did not want it to end.  Totally high energy, retro disco funk. I loved every track, even the one or two \\"slow\\" numbers which were beautiful.  If you like to dance, work out, or whatever you must get this.
B0002NRQTS|5.0|I may be slightly biased towasrds this album, as it is one of three that I grew up listening to (others being Roll the Bones and A Show of Hands). Trying to assume an umbiased stance (which is near impossible), I do feel that this album has been slighed, as many feel it is a \\"transitional\\" work, which it is, and is the first of their non-keyboard albums. <br /> <br />Some people focus on the lyrics a great deal, which is almost like judging a book by it's cover. The musical content represented here is easily some of the best the band has ever offered up. Yes, The Pass \\"is the only decent song,\\" but that's from a lyrical point of view. Just listen to Superconductor, Presto, or Scars. This is one of the musical talent showcase albums, for sure. I also consider this to be one of their few, in a sense, \\"complete\\" albums, as one song flows easily into another. It's one piece of wood with somewhat similar cuts. I highly recomment it.
B0002IVN9W|3.0|Plays great in the background, but listen close and you realize that the chocolately goodness is due mostly to savvy track sequencing; listen close, track by track, and you'll be asking yourself where all the good songs went.    In short, Arcade Fire specialize in pleasant sonic moments.  Supertramp accomplished as much.    Cool arrangements, not much else, least of all lyrics that give the listener a glimpse of anything worth contemplating.
B00008EY65|5.0|In a poopstorm of films based off of comicbook heroes, a real movie appears. Hellboy is an awesome character and this movie does the comic justice.  While the movie isn't exact to the comics, it is still great.  If you are tired of the stains that marvel is dumping out, check this out.  The only complaint I have, is that it is to short. Forget Daredevil, The Hulk, Elektra, & the ridiculous Fantastic Four.  Plus David Hyde Pierce does Abe's voice,...Niles Rocks!!!!

2913903878|5.0|This large book is a museum.  I remember a lot of this equipment from my childhood (I was an Air Force brat and was with my father in Europe during the early 1960's) and some of the World War Two equipment is still in service with today's US Army.  One example, the RL-39 on page 147 hasn't been improved upon.  The vintage canteen cup is still current issue--with a new \\"National Stock Number\\" instead of the WWII \\"Stock Number.\\"  The Browning .50 caliber heavy machine gun, despite many attempted replacements, still soldiers on in Iraq.  Most of the items pictured are now memories, though.  Mr. Enjames has assembled a fine collection between the covers of this book.<br /><br />In \\"real\\" museums, there are often glitches, errors, and substitutions in the displays.  One World War One trench scene was littered with modern 7.62mm NATO brass (adopted by the US Army in 1956, but experimentally available earlier) instead of the correct 8mm Lebel shell casings--the museum was working with limited resources and couldn't get a bucket full of the French brass for the diarama of an American doughboy in action during 1918.  Mr. Enjames appears to have used only vintage stuff in his photos.  Many of the smaller, \\"common\\" items such as the K-rations, C-rations, pamplets, hand tools, communications equipment, sewing and toilet kit contents, and chemical warfare gear won't be found in most museums.<br /><br />I will be using this book as reference when constructing minature World War Two dioramas.  If I were a re-enactor, this book would be a valuable resource.  Collectors not only can use \\"Governmetn Issue\\" to check the authenticity of a uniform item, but there's an under-exploited realm of collecting for those beginners on a tight budget--all those little items that make up \\"sets, kits, and outfits\\"--tool boxes for a tank or a jeep, medical clothing, field kitchens, field offices.  Armies frequently have to take everything they might need with them because they operate beyond the frontiers of civilization--or because war has destroyed most of the things we take for granted, but need for routine, day-to-day operations.  Ever run out of toilet paper?he frontiers of civilization--or because war has destroyed most of the things we take for granted, but need for routine, day-to-day operations.  Ever run out of toilet paper?
0156029065|5.0|This may very well be Eco's must under-rated work. It is, at first blush, simpler than his other works. It is less dense, and has a slightly more coherent storyline, albeit laced with Eco's encylopedic knowledge of history that makes any of his works a challenge.<br /><br />The brilliance in this novel lies in the fact that it recognizes itself to be a complete fabrication, laced with bits of historical fact that Eco plays with as if they were his own toybox. He tinkers with history and the events of the time masterfully, weaving them all together in a story that is at once funny, clever, and even a bit poignant.
B0007P3582|1.0|First off, why to people who don't like rap keep reviewing this album, if you don't want to share opinons or advise buyers, get lost. As no one cares about Dying Fetus, or Dead Lamb or whatever your rubbishy rock/metal/garbage/lot of indecipharable noise is called.  <br /> <br />50's first attempt at an album was weak, there's no denying that, (idon't care if it did sell a squillion records or whatever) it was still weak. However there was maybe a little tiny miniscule glimmer of hope that maybe 50 could follow it up with an acceptable album. He didn't. This album has got to be the worst i have ever heard, it is a joke at it's core, the thing could be one really long boring song about guns, with one really bad annoying beat. There really isn't a single memorable song on the whole album, the much hyped diss song aimed at most everyone is pathetic. I heard someone use the word venom to describe 50's insults, i'd say lemonade is closer to the truth. Compared to Shyne's For The Record, Jadakiss's Checkmate, Fat Joe's My 44, and undoubtably Nas's reply, it's laughable.  <br /> <br />People are always complaining that Ja Rule is the one bringing down rap music, and will i have to shake my head at offerings such as Mesmerise and Always On Time. They're a hell of a lot more enjoyable than 50's boring as sin Candy Shop or Just A Lil Bit. That guy can't tell the difference between love and sex, his songs are just promises to get the more ice in return for sex. AT least Ja showed a sensitive side. <br /> <br />Anyone who knows anything about Hip hop will remember Tupac's song When Thugs Cry, or Biggie's Suicidal Thoughts, 50 should take note, even if he is the worlds biggest scariest meaniest gangsta, he can still open up. He seems uncomfortable when he gets off of the subject of guns, and unable to talk about any emotion apart from lust and anger. <br /> <br />And before you accuse me of it, i'm not a hater, i try and find good points in every artist, and will own up to owning and enjoying all of Ja's albums, i've got some of Nelly's albums, I'm a massive Jay-Z fan, hell i even bought a Chingy album once (though i can't remember why-cos it's s**t). So i'm not sitting here saying 50's to pop for me, or i'm too deep and clever to enjoy his music. He's just very very boring.  <br /> <br />His flow is weak and cracks as though he's going through puberty. <br />His lyrics are just pathetic, could he rhyme HOOD and GOOD together any more times if he tried?? <br />Most of the beats on the album are annoying at best. <br />He has absoultly no charisma, and is probably the most easily hated person in the world, as he is a horrible person, who really makes you want to punch him in the face. <br />He has no presence, when someone like Hov is rapping you know about it, you're capitavted, by 50 you are just bored. <br />He isn't a gangsta, if i got shot 9 times would that make me a gangsta? In the words of Shyne, he keeps getting struck, but don't ever strike.  <br />Why does a feared gangsta spend 30,000 a day on a security, drive around in a bullet proff humvee and wear a bullet proof vest.  <br />Why does he feel that taking off his shirt at every single oppurtunity will make him a great rapper? <br />Why do girls like him when he is pug ugly? <br />Why do people buy his crappy clothing line which doesn't even look attractive, sticking pictures of guns and bombs on your clothes doesn't make them look good.  <br />Why do heavy metal fans keep reviwing rap albums they don't like and know they won't? (I'll do the same to a Rotting Fetus album in a minute) <br />
B0007TKNL0|4.0|It's the typical love triangle - the aggressive man of mystery with all the intelligence and tragic Gothic beauty in the world; the safe man who has a sweet deposition and a flair for the passionate sword fight and finally the woman who has a battle of lust/heat vs. true romance. Sounds like the typical Hollywood movie, doesn't it? Nevermind the easy cheap Hollywood setting, but subtract the weak love and add a beautifully suffocating feeling of possessed music, we have \\"Phantom of the Opera,\\" a noble and amazing book, play and now movie starring break-through singer/actors. Emmy Rossum (\\"Mystic River\\"), Gerard Butler (\\"Letters to Frankie\\") and Patrick Wilson (\\"The Alamo\\") star in the highly anticipated \\"Andrew Lloyd Weber's The Phantom of the Opera\\" a movie directed by Joel Schumacher and produced by Andrew Lloyd Weber with a supporting cast including Miranda Richardson (\\"The Hours\\",)and Minnie Driver (\\"Good Will Hunting\\").  <br /> <br />In the midst of amazing beauty in the backdrops and the costumes (note \\"Mask of the Red Death\\" - did the fashion designers take inspiration from the stage costume or actually did their homework?) which look astonishingly beautiful although there are some noticeable flaws that made it difficult for me to sit through.  <br /> <br />The main one to point out is the poor lip-syncing in the numbers \\"Think of Me\\" and \\"Track Down this Murderer\\" as well as through many of the numbers such as the title track were turned into little \\"music videos\\" using camera shots to (?) possibly to make or cover up the poor lip syncing issues. Some of the special scenes in the movie versus the stage play was un-needed, notably the sword fight. Call me a literature purist, but none of them had gone into a physical fight, for Leroux it was a mental struggle and vying for the love of one woman between two men.  <br /> <br />Again, Schumacher makes up for some of the poor moves and sweeps into the \\"Masquerade\\" song and dance a la \\"Rodgers and Hammerstein\\", which the dancing down the hall just screamed those two historical names when I first watched it. In that scene also, double props for the use of colour, and not only the black, white, and silver, but for Christine and Phantom who by \\"The Music of the Night\\" had been tainted by blood and therefore shades of red. Brilliant idea!  <br /> <br />All the scenes were wonderfully acted and sung. Butler, having no experience in the singing field only added to the standards that Crawford set as rather the \\"rock and roll\\" phantom with his growling voice (think \\"What raging fire shall flood the soul\\")while Rossum has the perfect voice to match the character (she has beaten out Brightman, but had generated Christine's signature poodle curly hair). It is amazing that the singing was fit for the characters. And it was surprising that Minnie Driver was all to brilliant for this role, even faking out with the opera singing voice.  <br /> <br />But another low point is showed, or perhaps with some more analysis one could figure the reasoning why Butler's makeup just looked like a bad rash. Would it be for him to have the new-age Phantom disfigurement (comparing with Lon Chaney, for example) to show yet another piece of satire in POTO? Like that society is so inept for just the tiniest detail of disfigurement to be ugly and therefore easily shunned?  <br /> <br />Another issue that is noticeable for a person who has seen POTO over and over again is the age issue. If Mme. Giry was about thirteen when she rescued the Phantom (supposedly sixteen according to Leroux), and then flash forward some years and Mme Giry is much older than the Phantom. Again, only a flaw that the \\"young-Hollywood\\" version could have only produced.  <br /> <br />Personally for this movie, I would have liked to have seen Baz Luhrmann or Rob Marshall take the helm of directing this movie, because at the end I felt a bit dry - as if this direction wasn't enough personally for me. But the look was beautiful and perhaps the only gaudy thing is made up in the settings and La Carlotta's acting and wardrobe.  <br /> <br />Like many people say of \\"Fantome de l'Opera\\" that it is a confusing book, \\"Andrew Lloyd Weber's Phantom of the Opera\\" is just as confusing when it is in black and white, as well was being Hollywood purified. All in all, looking away from the bones of the movie, \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" is another musical that we can hope to rejuvenate the forgotten genre.  <br /> <br />Now for the DVD setting: I was looking forward to getting the two disc Special Widescreen edition - instead, the extras were less than desired.  <br /> <br />The highs of the packaging are \\"Behind the Mask: The Story of Phantom of the Opera\\" - a featurette that I just adore - complete with interviews from POTO's stage orginators - Andrew Lloyd Weber, Charles Hart, Richard Stilgoe and Harold Prince to name a few - with scenes from the stage production and promo spots, showing the original cast.  <br /> <br />One thing in that featurette that nags at me is ALW's inconsideration to the play's origin to consider that \\"Don Juan Triumphant\\" was his idea to put into the play. However from reading Leroux, it was \\"...on the desk was a music book covered with red notes. I asked leave to look at it and read 'Don Juan Triumphant'...\\" (Leroux, 126).  <br /> <br />The other lows of the second disc was the dim and dumb idea of a sing a long of the crew to the title track and one deleted scene which is obvious why it was deleted - a re-lyric-ed version of Minnie Driver's \\"Learn to Be Lonely\\" as \\"No One Would Listen\\" sung by Gerard Butler. Yes, it has its good parts to have been taped, but at the same time, we had enough sympathy between Mme Giry and Christine, as well as the Phantom's self loathing, it wasn't needed for that one scene.  <br /> <br />One thing I was looking forward to seeing on the extras (or at least on the first disc) would be a cast/crew or individual commentaries on the movie. There is one thing that goes straight to my heart and that's featurettes and cast commentaries. They should make sure on its (if possible) future re-release to have some commentaries!  <br /> <br />The acceptable was the \\"3-act\\" featurette of the making of the movie.  <br /> <br />After seeing this movie, like Richard Stilgoe and Emmy Rossum, I would highly suggest planning on a pilgrimage to the Opera House in Paris!
B0001NBMBC|1.0|What i don't get it, these guys make noise, incomprehensible noise pollution, stick it in a really ugly and frightening peice of album art, slap a $10.00 charge on it and call it music. This is pathetic this isn't music, look the word music up in a dictionary, I'm sure the words Melody, Rhythem and Tune will crop up. Maybe some one should point that out to slip knot or korn, or whoever the hell I'm writing this review on. If you can't sing, why form a band. If you can't play a musical instrument, why voulenteer to be the drummer? And if you don't like metal music, why write a review, i hear you say, well I'll enlighten you. Why do metal heads keep writing reviews for rap music they clearly don't like??
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|Tim Burton's BIG FISH is a dramatic, comedy-fantasy.  It's full of amazing visions (name a Tim Burton film that didn't).  The film is funny, and sad, and moving.  It's one of Tim Burton's rare gems, like SLEEPY HOLLOW or EDWARD SCISSORHANDS.  Make sure you don't miss this one, it's an amazing film!
B0008KLVDM|5.0|The movie was right. The Price felt right so why not? The picture is so clear and crisp and so is the sound. Amazing...like Amazon.
0792164903|5.0|This is certainly one of Tim Burton's best films.  The look of the film is incredible and Johnny Depp and the whole cast is excellent.  Everything about SLEEPY HOLLOW is first rate, from the sets, cinematography, and music, to the costumes and special effects and make-up.  Tim Burton has created a brilliant, timeless, gothic fantasy masterpiece.  I still watch this movie every Halloween night.  Make sure and check this one out.
B000002J1S|5.0|The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway(1974) indicates Peter Gabriel last work with the band. Some of his best songs are on here. This would have been the best Gabriel-era album but there are too many instrumental fillers, especially on disc 2.<br /><br />Since there are 23 songs in all, I will only praise the highlights. First, THE LAMB LIES DOWM ON BROADWAY kicks off the album nicely with its magnificent piano intro. FLY ON A WINDSHIELD is one of the best instrumentals on the album. IN THE CAGE in the first epic of the album and really packs a punch. THE GRAND PARADE OF LIFELESS PACKAGING is one of the weirdest songs on the album that you have to hear for yourself to agree. BACK IN N.Y.C. is another weird one but more catchy. COUNTING OUT TIME may be the catchiest song on the album. CARPET CRAWLERS is one of the best Genesis songs that's under six minutes and this version is much better than the crappy 1999 version.THE CHAMBER OF 32 DOORS wraps up the first half of the album, it's a slower song that's overall good but does drag at times.<br /><br />Now the second half is a mixed bag; it has some great instrumental like the eerie WAITING ROOM and the mysterious SILENT SORROW IN EMPTY BOATS, but it also has some fillers like HERE COMES THE SUPPER NATURAL ANAESTHETIST and RAVINE. The best songs on this half are the majestic LAMIA and the humourous COLONY OF SLIPPERMEN. RIDING THE SCREE is another song worth mentioning and IT ends the album strongly.<br /><br />Despite the numorous amount of fillers, The Lamb is definitely essential.
B00003CXB4|5.0|Uh, yeah! The two Lion King movies(the original and Simba's Pride, of course)are the only two Disney movies I like, let alone love. This is a great DVD, and the new song \\"Morning Report\\" is hilarious to the core. And on top of that, the movie is everything it should be. It's funny, powerful, and interesting, all rolled into one. Any lion lover should have this. Here's the characters in the order of my liking, in each animal class:  <br /> <br />Lions:                      Hyenas:                 Other: <br /> <br />1. Nala                     1. Shenzi               1. Zazu <br /> <br />2. Simba                    2. Banzai                2. Pumbaa <br /> <br />3. Mufasa                   3. Nameless              3. Timon <br />                                                      <br />4. Sarabi                   4. Ed(I hate him) <br /> <br />5. Scar <br /> <br />6. Sarafina <br /> <br />7. All the other lionesses <br />(they don't have a very big role) <br /> <br />All in all, this is the best cartoon movie of all time. If I could give it ten stars, I would without any hesitation.
0060597844|5.0|I recommend this audio CD 110%, for people of all ages.  There is none better than Eric Idle, and he does supremely with this particular item.  His voice, his narration, and his actions through words really bring Roald Dahl's book to life.  It is highly enjoyable, as well as hilarious.
B0000844I8|4.0|The team of the movie been so perfect in all aspects, The story is kinda believable comparing to any other SciFi movie. Actors been selected and did their work perfectly with the director's excellent job. Audio / Video effects are stunning also. <br />As interesting as this film is, I recommend the StarGate SG-1, which I also purchase the first 7 seasons.  <br />
B0006GAOBI|4.0|I finally checked this movie out, after hearing all the hype that's it's one of the best quirky off-beat movies of the decade.  It's hard to categorize this movie.  Sci-fi?  Teen angst/coming of age?  Horror?  It has elements of everything, and there's nothing to compare it to.<br /><br />I'm not going to detail the plot, because that's been taken care of in the description and in many other reviews.  It's not an easy plot to follow, and the end is confusing.  I highly recommend that you watch this movie more than once, because it makes a lot more sense on repeated viewings.  If you really want to get into what the movie is about, check out the kind-of-cryptic website at donniedarko.com, which has a lot of background info.  In order to get into the time travel/parallel universe, you need to read some of the documents on the website.  You aren't going to figure it out just from watching the movie.  I also suggest doing a google search and seeking out some of the better fan sites, which have explanations of the different universes and how the plot works.<br /><br />Jake Gyllenhall delivers an outstanding performance in this movie.  His character is off-beat, brilliant, disturbed, and handsome.  He's an outcast at school, but so funny that he gains respect of his peers when he has intelligent outbursts railing against the hypocrisy of education.  Another not-to-miss performance is Patrick Swayze as an annoying self-love self-help guru worshipped by the teachers at Donnie's school.<br /><br />Watch this movie once to see what it is all about, and if you are at all intrigued, get ready for some repeated viewings and some research into the backstory.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|This is a movie that makes fun of retards. Produced by hipsters. Think about it. Wow. Because believe you me, MTV screenwriters are so ultra-slick and hollywood gleaming cool, that they can make such a crappy movie about pathetic mid-west retards, and people will think it's cool. That's just MTV. The humor is the crappiness, see? And you're supposed to laugh. That keeps them in the cool. Because otherwise, well, you see, then otherwise they're not cool. They'd be jerks. But far better for you to think they're cool, so the real jerk will be you, and not them. And then far worse, you can think anybody who actually says this is crap-de-la-crap is a real jerk. <br /> <br />This is a movie about people who are so pathetically nerdy that they are clearly caricatures created by those who seem them as such - yet the caricatures will win over the jocks at the end of the movie - thereby attracting a certain type of nerdy retard wannabe to think it's cool; and that's the jocks turned MTV screenwriter plan, because only somebody as truly pathetic as these characters in this story could like it.  <br /> <br />It's really a simple test they've created ...did you like it? <br /> <br />Aren't you cool? <br /> <br />Sorry, I'm not so hip. I think this is trash, and have found better stories on urinal walls.
6305313687|5.0|This is a powerful movie that deserves all the respect it has gained.  It does not present a simple tale of right vs. wrong, but rather puts you in the shoes of people to see how skinhead ideals (or any racist ideals) can take over, and become all-consuming, and shape your life forever.  It's not at all a preachy story of a changed man, rather it is an intense portrait of a family hit by race issues, and the stuggles of each family member to come to terms with reality and find their own personal belief system.<br /><br />The story is told in flashbacks--it opens with Edward Norton's skinhead character getting out of jail for killing a black man.  Slowly, we learn the backstory of how he got to be the skinhead leader he was, and what happend to him in prison to make him look at the world differently.  I had tears in my eyes during the prison flashback segments.<br /><br />The Norton character gives many eye-opening monologues on his skinhead ideals.  There's just enough truth in what he says to make him dangerous.  It's very easy to see how disaffected youth, bullied by gangs, could turn to the skinhead ideals as a safe haven.<br /><br />This is an amazing movie about racist ideals and family ties.  Check it out if you can handle the realism and want to be blown away by some powerful messages.
0972169504|5.0|When in grad school, you go through the whole spectrum of emotions. This book is about all the things you secretly think, but would never dare share with others. It's about the things you are certain that no other human experiences. Jorge Cham just writes them in the most hilarious way, helping you see that you are NOT alone. A recent study found that 95% of all graduate students feel overwhelmed. Without this book, I think they would have found 100%.
0060989157|5.0|I have read many rock star/bands autobios and bios and I must say that The Dirt is the best one I have read so far.  Some parts I had to read over again just because they were so shocking or just great stories. There is talk of a movie version of The Dirt coming out...I hope it will be as great as the book.
B0009X766Y|5.0|Who did Universal think they were kidding?  This release is WAY overdue.  A two disc, widescreen edition is MOST appropriate for this OSCAR winning Best Picture from 1973.  I can still remember Liz Taylor's elation at the Oscars when she gleefully announced \\"The Sting\\" as winner of Best Picture.<br /><br />Update:  WOW!  This 2-disk edition truely was worth the wait.  The bonus disc is NOT packed with deleted scenes and bloopers but contains great interviews with those still with us and wonderful commentary about those who are not.  A fine release for one very fine movie.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|A friend of mine used a term to describe the new SOaD album and I have to say it's the best description I have heard so far: \\"Audio Crack!\\"  And that is exactly what it is.  Addictive as hell.  I literally find myself singing a line or humming a riff every friggin' day.  (...)    I didn't really care for the album upon first listen.  \\"B.Y.O.B.\\" and \\"Question\\" (my personal favorite) stood out, but mostly everything was mediocre or lame to me (or so I thought)...then I took another hit of 'Mezmerize,' and I was instantly hooked.    My only problem with disc (and it looks like several other people's too) is Daron Malakian's choice to sing more lead vocals.  It's almost comedic to me that you have the dynamic voice of Serj Tankanian in the band and the choice is to under-utilize him.  I wish he could have put his stamp on more of the tunes.  I can't wait for the 2nd record this fall.    A great, great record.
B000A6T1KE|4.0|i have heard many people trash this movie, calling it \\"khan lite\\" and even worse things, but i wish to disagree. the major <br />differance between the two movies has to do with what was going on with each crew. in the time of \\"khan\\" there a long and uneasy <br />peace among the major powers (in part due to the organian peace treaty) and the crew of enterprise 1701, had all moved on with <br />there careers and were happy with what they were doing. that is everyone but jim kirk who had come to think the galaxy had passed him by. in fact one of the underlining currents of \\"khan\\", \\"search for spock\\", & \\"voyage home\\" was how much jim kirk could still do, could still be useful to the galaxy. <br /> <br />     in nemesis, the mood is much different. nemesis took place just 4 years after the end of the dominion war, the largest and most destuctive war to have occured since humans first went into space. the war almost brought the federation and the klingon empire to there knees, left cardassia prime looking like <br />berlin in 1945, and major federation worls like betazed recovering from invasion and occupation. in addition, after the <br />war there was the gateway crsis, the genesis wave crsis, plus many smaller actions to maintain and restore the peace. in this <br />environment even the best crew would be under great pressure. and so we come into nemesis and see that the crew is about to break up (to find out what extra pressures caused this to happen, you will have to read the 9 vol. a time to... books) <br />first is the wedding riker and troi, who will soon take command of the new luna class ship \\"uss titan\\", dr. crusher is going back to head starfleet medical, data is to become 1st officer and worf, having grown tried of being a ambassador, has his commission reinstated and is to become 2nd officer. <br />     so as you can see, the crew interaction completely diffent. <br />in addition, the release of \\"khan\\" from his prison world was a fluke, while the plot thatbrought \\"shinzon\\" to power was as cold and calulating as any romulan(or reman for that matter) plan. in addition, as to the deaths of spock and data, each was logical in it's own way. to quote spock \\"the needs of the many outweigh the few, or the one\\", and because the chareter of data <br />had gone about as far as it could in groth and still be a andriod it quite logical that data should save his crewmates, and it also logical that the chareter of data should end at this point. <br /> <br />     as to why this movie bombed at the box office and was the only \\"star trek\\" movie to ever lose money, i do not know. while it is not as good as \\"khan\\" or \\"first contact\\" it is much better than \\"final frontier\\". i hope there is a 11th movie out there soon, and i thing a mixing of \\"next generation, ds9, and voyager\\" crews would be great, such as seeing more of \\"admiral janeway\\" <br /> <br />
0345457684|5.0|I have read a lot, my whole life, pretty much anything I could get my hands on.  I average a couple or three books per week, and have always loved mysteries and thrillers.  I have never been interested in SciFi, however, having read only a couple of books (Dune, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?), and never being really interested in the genre.  Until now. <br /> <br />Morgan's writing is gritty, brutal at times, dripping with atmosphere.  Kovacs is a flawed protagonist, to say the least, but one with some semblance of a heart.  That being said, he has no compunction about killing, or hurting, or breaking the rules.  But hey, he is an Envoy, and that's what he was trained to do.  The mystery was not the greatest, but the getting there, the worlds(s) Morgan creates, are the real treat.  Noir is the perfect description, but futuristic noir.  A satisfying blend of the old and the new.  I am a convert, at least if the books are anything like this one.
B00000F169|1.0|I have nothing good to say about this film. The acting, script and production values all have much to be desired. My primary reason for purchasing this film was it's placement in the genre of Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, of which I am a fan. Unfortunately, this film has no resmblence to the Guide.
B0000035E7|5.0|I love BLEACH, it is my favorite Nirvana album. I have never-ending respect for its well-played unpolished rawness, it's ridiculously unrelenting heavy rock groove, and Kurt's full-force brilliant rock vocal chords. However, my friends hate the album. They laugh at its anger. They all say it's Nirvana's worst album.<br /><br />What I am saying is that this isn't the best easy-listening album. If you are a person who values technical style and those forms of respectability then don't go near Bleach. My reaction to the work is probably not common. I love the album because it's so rocking and entertaining, it takes me back to a past that I never had and it's one of the best albums I own. But it's also brash and reckless and loud and it is unlikely to please a fan of anything that is particularly smooth. Although one reason I love Kurt's vocals so much is that they are screaming & powerful AND yet they are not comparable to the typical scream music voice because Kurt also uses some range and has a few different voices. (I'm not saying that is more respectable, but I like it a lot better that way).<br /><br />Also if you're a fellow who doesn't respect Nirvana, it might be good for you to look at them at face value. This album shows Nirvana's raw talent for pre-emptively raw heavy rock music. This shows that before Nirvana was an awesome 'alternative' band they were the spitting image of what \\"grunge\\" was before it became popular - metal + punk = slam dancing.
0786869143|5.0|All I can say is that we got this book, and things actually DID strart going better, including getting a better job, having more positive things happen, etc. Things literally turned around. And that was within one month. I liked the exercises - very practical and doable. <br /> <br />In regard to the idea that he didn't have any objective test  for luck - Dr. W. had subjects go into rather  lengthy descriptions of what in their lives had happened to support their perception of themselves as lucky or unlucky.  By most people's standards, the unlucky people WERE having rather hard times. The lucky people were having a much easier time.  <br /> <br />It's important to remember that Dr. W. is sort of  professional skeptic - he's not into the paranormal. He got these principles out of hard-headed investigation. I learned in the lab - don't argue with the results you have gotten! He's gotten good results - try it for yourself and see!
B000003TAR|5.0|With Nirvana (in my opinion one of the greatest and most influencial bands ever known)people always go on about &quot;nevermind&quot; and yes that album is unbelievable i urge you to get that as well! along with bleach, all class. Nevermind has songs that you will all be addicted to at once...Some of the best songs Nirvana ever released like Smells like Teen Spirit, In bloom, come as you are, and Lithium. However the album is a bit old once you've heard all those too many times. <BR>In Utero on the other hand...Every song is pure class! they just show all emotions and really get to you. If you're affraid there isn't many great hits, well try songs like &quot;heart shaped box&quot; &quot;rape me&quot; and &quot;Pennyroyal tea&quot; But i can't name the songs that are amazing because every single one is, and in my opinion it is the best album by one of the best bands. <br />you won't be disapointed i'll tell you that ;-) <br />- kyle
B000002TYX|4.0|The first volume in The Beatles' \\"Anthology\\" series is without a doubt the weakest in the series, thanks to horrible sound, a lot of cheesy unneeded interviews and dense liner notes. This is still a much needed album for any Beatlemaniac like myself, but this album could have been so much more.<br /><br />Disc 1 starts off kicks off with the 1996 Top Ten hit \\"Free As A Bird\\". This was a demo John Lennon made in 1975 that in 1995, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr completed. They included it on this album and released as a single, and it went as far as number six on the Hot 100, making them the first and thus far only group to score a Top 20 hit in the 1960s', 1970s', 1980s' and 1990s' (\\"Anthology 2's\\" \\"Real Love\\" quickly followed it to number 11). This disc contains some great material, however, it is ruined by terrible sound. I know they're old recordings but they still could have worked on it a little more. The interviews are terribly bad. I was glad that the live performances were included, they were cool. But otherwise, I was let down by this disc.<br /><br />Disc Two is much better. They're a lot of great unreleased tracks, and they sound phenomenal. I thought the performance of \\"Moonlight Bay\\" was hilarious, and I loved the harder version of \\"Can't Buy Me Love\\". That rocked. This cd is excellent.<br /><br />The liner notes are really good. This cd is spotty and is recommended to die hards only.
B000003TAB|3.0|yah seriously don't get this unless you've heard all the other Nirvana albums. I was quite disapointed and understand why it's a b-side album...First of all it sounds too much like light punk for my taste, when i listen to Nirvana i want to hear some true blooded grunge. The only songs that i really love are Anuerysm(best on the album) and Aero Zeppelin...Anuerysm espeacilly because to be honest it's one of my favorite songs from Nirvana.<BR>Anyways, yes please get In Utero, Nevermind, and Bleach before this. Overall i don't think this is worth 3 stars but since it's Nirvana it get's some extra points ;-)
B00026WU3M|3.0|First of all I have to state up front I love Dylan and Lanois.  So when this first came out I didn't hesitate to buy it.  In hindsight, this is the 'warm-up' for the next collaboration they did - 'Time out of Mind'  which if you haven't bought it yet and you like Dylan, you really should get that one.  This release, I think it is safe to say, of all of his work is the most overlooked - it is at the bottom of downloads at itunes, has only 4 other reviews on Amazon, and you can't even preview the music at least on the Amazon web page that I have loaded.  But that doesn't mean it is forgettable.....I would put this in the middle of his discography.  Its not a most own, but I recommend a listen - check it out at your library if you can.  If you like 'Time out of Mind' there are 3-5 songs on this one that would go very well with that release and give you 80 minutes of really great music.  In particular my favs on this one are political world, man in the long black coat, what good am i, and shooting star.  Your mileage may vary but there are several excellent tracks on this one. 3.5 stars
0066214122|1.0|20 pages of plot crammed into 384 pages.  It's been a long downhill slide since The Andromeda Strain.  Static, dull, and full of technical inaccuracies.  The author seems much more interested in impressing us with his technical details than actually bothering to  develop characters.
0553208845|4.0|Surprisingly insightful and revealing for a book of just 152 pages. Even though the backdrop for the book is about a young Brahmin's quest for self-realization, many of us will still relate to it.<br /><br />The journey for a young Siddhartha begins with an awakening, \\"Truly, nothing in the world has occupied my thoughts as much as the Self, this riddle, that I live....and about nothing in the world do I know less than about myself, about Siddhartha.\\"<br /><br />In the end Siddhartha says, \\"Knowledge can be communicated, but not wisdom. One can find it, live it, be fortified by it, do wonders through it, but one cannot communicate it and teach it.\\"<br /><br />Like any good book it only raises questions and asks you to find your own answers. I intend to read the book again sometime in the future.<br /><br />PS: I've given it four stars only because I found the plot a bit too dramatic towards the end.
B000056BOR|3.0|This movie was made in 1962, but the whole style is basically 50s, Doris Day looks like my grandmother in it. The whole plot is kind of weird, watch it yourself, but don't expect anything great really. Just some sugarcoated 50s Hollywood romance with two aging protagonists and 1950s sexual mores. Basically the rich guy (Cary Grant, who else) meeting the country wench kind of thing. For a better movie with Grant I would recommend \\"House Boat\\", Sophia Loren is much better than Doris Day anyhow.
B00025ETIW|4.0|My friend got me this cd for my birthday one day. And I think its is such an awesome cd. I am listening while I write this atcually. <br /> <br />Personal I think this cd is one of a kind! If you don't enjoy one song off the album you most likly would like another song. Ever song sounds different but still has the edge of MCR. I am not going to rate the songs for you because we all have our own opinions. But it is a must buy. My personal fave song is the \\"ghost of you.\\" This doesn't sound like any other band. Not like most bands who all sound the same!
B000003TA4|5.0|Even after all these years i still enjoy listening to this album. Such an incredible album that defined an era in rock history. Kurt Cobain's lyrics are poetic. He had this knack for writing lyrics that were so vague yet meant so much to so many people. He was a true poet. Even though i think their third album \\"In Utero\\" is much better and more personal to the band, this is still a great album that rock fans should pick up and is essential to a rock fans collection.
0634049011|5.0|I've been playing guitar a long time and this book really helps you get an idea how the fretboard works. I recommend that you get this book  first and then MI guitar soloing by Daniel Gilbert & Beth Marlis. It will help you unlock your soloing abilities and take you to the next level. Best of luck.
B000002BMV|5.0|This special album will forever define my generation of music during high school in the early 1980's. <br /> <br />The combination of Steve Perry's voice and Neil Schon's ripping guitar not only make it an album that really, really rocks, but also creates some wonderfully-memorable ballads. <br /> <br />To this day, I still think \\"Open Arms\\" is the best power ballad ever written. <br /> <br />This August, I will see JOURNEY live for the third time.  New singer or not (and by the way, he is great), they put on an incredible show!
B000002TQV|5.0|Did BORNTOLIE \\"B\\"  (see prior review from 7/16/05) mean to post, verbatim, Rolling Stone's review of this?  Or is this a peculiar coincidence? <br /> <br />Anyhow, this is a great album.  Great, great, great.   <br /> <br />'Nice Dream' is marvelous.  Yeah.  This album encompasses all that is good about Radiohead.  I recommend this album above their others for the Radiohead newbie.  Their later stuff is heavier and more abstract and, in my opinion, more well-suited for the fan who intends to stick with Radiohead for the long term.  Just my personal opinion, so disregard it if you wish. <br /> <br />This album contains beauty, horror, soaring happiness, indifference, choking sadness, feelings of stagnation, hope, fear, and a thousand other emotions.  It will stay with you long after the last words of the last song fade out (pun intended) and you'll just have to listen to it again...and again.  Trust me.
B000002C1W|5.0|It was a triumphant return of a band we thought we wouldn't see again, with David Gilmour at the helm this time.  Beginning with the eerie instrumental \\"Signs of Life\\" right through to the ripping \\"Sorrow\\", the album defined the sound of late '80s rock without losing that classic \\"Pink Floyd\\" sound. <br /> <br />At the same time this was released, Roger Waters put out his solo \\"Radio K.A.O.S.\\", which in its own right, was a success, too.  One can't help but wonder if all four members had put their musical styles together, might we have had another \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\"? <br /> <br />By the way, this Pink Floyd album was indirectly responsible for me finally losing my virginity.  Thank you!
B00092ZMDY|5.0|This was a great concert video. Their harmonies sounded as tight as ever.  All of the guys can still hit all of the notes.  I couldn't think of any of their Eagles or solo songs that they didn't play that I would have wanted to hear.  I also liked their humor between songs.  Just grab a blanket, some munchies and lay back and enjoy.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|pancake_repairman, C.Chow and Mugwomp McGillicuddy have it all wrong.  They obviously missed the point, and felt that attacking the fans and actors of this series was a way to avoid anyone noticing that.  They apparently approached this show expecting something and upon not receiving it, lashed out in anger. <br /> <br />I'm as harsh a critic as they come, and while this short lived series isn't perfection, it needn't be.  I, like many of you here now, was lured into watching Firefly after seeing the movie trailer.  After watching the first half of the pilot on The Sci-fi channel I needed more, and quickly accuired the DVD set.  I think I made a mistake by watching the entire 14 episodes in 2 days, as my Firefly experience was sweet yet too short.  I cannot wait to see if many of the questions we all have from the show are answered in the movie. <br /> <br />As far as those 3 I mentioned before, they're just soulless reavers who can no longer appreciate something fresh and original.
B0007Y4TVU|2.0|When I first gave this CD a spin, I was not really sure of what to think. Sometimes an album grows on me after a few listens, and that just hasn't happened with Mezmerize. Lets go back in time to the 1998 self titled debut. When I first picked the CD I was blown away on the first listen. In fact it didn't leave my CD player for months. I dare even to say then that I called SOAD a metal band. RELAX..This isn't going to be one of those reviews that bashes nu metal and pop, or any other muscical format. I love all types of music, from Six Feet Under to Billy Joel. What I don't understand about some bands, is not staying true to your musical format. SOAD was obviously looking for a different direction with Mezmerize. That direction sucks. I was unimpressed with the lollypop lyrics, and music. It just doesn't work. There are maybe 3 good tracks on the CD, and the rest of it is painful on the ears. Not only has this album taking an 360 degree turn from the first album, but it falls right into the river and gets blown away like a old doggie poop does in the wind. I really encourage all those that havent heard the self titled CD to pick it up, and really listen to the difference. This CD might be good for a Sweet Sixteen birthday party, but in no way does it really rock. I dont understand the direction that the band is trying to go in, but I don't like it. I didn't like it when Metallica did it, and I really don't like SOAD following down the same path. At least Metallica came back to us with ST. Anger which I believe is the heaviest album from the Metal Gods since Kill EM ALL. Anyway, Take a whirl if you must. Fans of the first album..I really dont see you liking this. But judge for yourself.
B000002H2H|5.0|What else can i say about this album other than it's the greatest Heavy Metal Album of all time? I think the album speaks for itself. I don't need to say much. This album speaks my words. Best Heavy Metal album EVER. Enough said.
B0009MDPYW|1.0|While I liked the overall packaged for this film (The behind the scenes information, the small comic book) The movie was really bad.  Keanu Reeves did not cut it in the main role and the script was so badly written that you actually thought of better dialog in your head while you are watching it. I agree with a lot of what has been said about Rachel Weisz and her great performance but not even her great effort could have saved it from it's own bad script and it's really bad leading man. <br /> <br />My one star review goes to Rachel Weisz and the slick DVD extras but the movie gets an no stars from me . <br />
B00092ZMDY|1.0|This is a well-produced HUGE SPECTACULAR show put on by 50% of a great American band once known as The Eagles. Unfortunately their success drove the other 50% of the band away. Ever since its been a Don Henley/Glen Frey solo project with whomever to help out with the instruments. Don and Glen are great, don't get me wrong. Love them! But please don't call this outfit The Eagles. The real Eagles, the four guys who wrote and recorded virtually all of their trademark songs, were Henley and Frey and Randy Meisner and Bernie Leadon. The Eagles name was made by these four - in fact it was Bernie who came up with the name. After Bernie and Randy left the other two had every right to carry on performing the songs they wrote; they should have come up with a new band name. I just don't think it's right for other musicians to cash in on the work and the name of other people. (I will applaud Timothy B. Schmidt for paying tribute to Randy Meisner when the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Randy was really moved by that gesture and it shows what a class act Timothy is.) Anyway, there have been lots of great old bands carrying on with new people under the old name, and I have never been okay with this. Great new musicians should have their own band name and let people judge them on their owm merits. Peace!
1573223026|2.0|I've read all Hornby's other books, most of which were great (How to be good was tedious).  But this one is slow, dull and barely amusing. <br /> <br />The story seems tenuous and at no point did I actually think that any of the characters would really kill themselves, so there was no other reason to continue reading the book. <br /> <br />Some of the plot lines are so unrealistic that it's hard to take this seriously at all - what happened to Mr. Hornby?  Does he not have standards any more? <br />
6301752686|5.0|This is a wonderful little video from Walt Disney Studios. It is a compilation of 3 great classic animated shorts, that perfectly fit the theme for family Halloween viewing. First up is, \\"Pluto's Judgment Day\\", first seen in movie theatres on August 31, 1935. In this cartoon Mickey is upset with his dog Pluto for always chasing cats, this time a poor little kitten, and so Pluto knows he is \\"in the doghouse\\". He falls asleep and dreams he is taken to court in an underground cavern for crimes against felines, with cats for prosecutor, judge and jury.  It quickly becomes a nightmare as the cats torment Pluto and sentence him. He learns his lesson to say the least. Great imagery and sight gags in this short directed by Dave Hand, the short really showcases the body language personality that an animator can build into an animated character that can't speak.  Two of Walt's most famous animators worked on this, Ward Kimball and Fred Moore. There used to be a \\"Uncle Tom\\" cat character that has been edited out in recent versions.<br /><br />Originally released in theatres on Christmas Eve 1937, \\"Lonesome Ghosts\\" was directed by Burt Gillett, and Art Babbit was one of the animators. Mickey, Donald, and Goofy run a ghost exterminator shop, but don't have any business. Some tough ghosts in a haunted house decide to have some fun and prank call the ghost-hunters to come get the ghosts out of the house. Excited to finally have some work, the boys race over to battle the spooks. Slapstick comedy abounds as the boys fumble their way through the house and the ghosts constantly get the better of them. The special effects of the ghosts, created with transparent paint invented by the studio are really well done. The backgrounds in the house are very detailed. This classic short has been a favorite of fans for many years, it is a hilarious tale, one of the best cartoons ever made. . It was included as an extra on the DVD's \\"The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad\\", \\"Disney Treasure Mickey Mouse is Living Color Vol. 1\\",and \\"Mickey's House of Villains\\". Beware of the Disney PC police editors, in that some DVD versions edit out the scene where Mickey shoots at a ghost with his gun. This is pretty silly since the bullets didn't harm the ghost anyway.<br /><br />Last is my favorite on this tape, \\"Trick or Treat\\", released theatrically on October 10, 1952.  This is the only one of the 3 that is actually supposed to portray Halloween. Its Halloween night and Donald Duck's nephews have come to Trick or Treat on his doorstep in their new Halloween costumes. Instead of giving them candy, Uncle Donald plays mean-spirited tricks on them including dumping water on them and then laughs at their misfortune. A real but very nice Witch Hazel (ideally voiced by June Foray) happens to see this and decides to give the boys a hand in punishing Donald while getting the treats for the boys. The story gets hilarious as she uses her powers to straighten Donald out. This one is themed directly on Halloween it's images are everywhere in this short directed by the great Jack Hannah. Bill Justice was an animator on this, and Yale Gracy did the layouts and background. Gracey later became an Imagineer and is renown for his special effects creations at the \\"Haunted Mansion\\" in Disneyland. \\"Trick or Treat\\" is also the title for the great bouncy song in this cartoon  written by Paul Smith. It is sung by the great \\"Mellomen\\" which included the voice actor Thurl Ravenscroft.  The Mellomen also sang in Lady and the Tramp and other shows from Disney.  I promise you will be singing this all day once you hear it.  This short was also on \\"Wonderful World of Disney\\" TV show in the episode \\"All About Magic\\" on January 30, 1957 which used the Magic Mirror from Snow White as the host. It was included as an extra on the DVD's \\"The Black Cauldron\\", and \\"Mickey's House of Villains\\". One reviewer mistakenly thought that this animated short was based on a comic by the great Carl Barks, but it wasthe other way around. While the story did appear in Donald Duck #26  November 1952) as the cover story at 32 pages, it was based on the short cartoon. Barks editors at Western Publishing needed a Halloween themed cover story for the holiday and already knew of the cartoon in production at the studio, so they asked him to create the comic based on the studio storyboards and the original story written by Ralph Wright.  Bark's said he had add-lib some more scenes to the story to fill it out to 32 pages, as a comic flows differently than an animated short.  This is according to an interview from the Carl Barks Library in 1985.<br /><br />This tape is not scary, and very fun for kids and adults alike.d.

B0007GAERG|5.0|Mariah definitely put a lot of effort into this album and it sure paid off. It's an awesome album. Especially \\"Get Your Number\\". There's alot of other artists in here too.
B0009IW98O|5.0|A few years before Bob's truly \\"breakout\\" albums (BEAUTIFUL LOSER, LIVE BULLET, AND NIGHT MOVES), he toured heavily and turned out several obscure records.  In spite of being ignored by the masses, these \\"lost\\" albums formed the solid rock on which Seger's concert shows were built on.  SMOKIN' O.P.S is a great album that shows everyone these days what all the excitement was all about.<br /><br />Here Seger took mostly hits for others and put them to the Silver Bullet.  The hot whiskey buzz swings right off the bat with \\"Bo Diddley\\".  \\"Bo Diddley\\" had been a minor entry in the Rock Catalogue; but Seger's treatment breathes high octane life into the old standard.  Segar sings his butt off with energy and gusto and the solo guitarist pours fire from his steel strings.  \\"Love the One You've With\\" intertwines the spirit of James Brown into Stills' Latin flavored/California hymn to \\"free love\\" (which legend has it Stills practiced with impunity.).<br /><br />\\"If I Were a Carpenter\\" is Tim Hardin's claim to immortality and has been covered by everyone from Bobby Darin to Johnny Cash.  It is such a great song that nearly all performances and recordings are a least \\"good\\" to \\"very good\\" (Cash's version has a special place in my heart).  The temptation for someone like Seger is to turn down the energy and get all soft and sensitive.  Instead, Seger flat out rocks this old chestnut and breathes dynamic power into each verse.  Excellent.  Deserves far more exposure than it has received.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Seger did not pour his locomotive force in Leon Russel's \\"Hummin' Bird\\".  In the spirit of full disclosure, I have to admit I have always been under whelmed by the song.  It is one of those early 1970's ballads whose style was popular among a certain set of the rock/folky/weed smokin' public that I thought didn't deserve half the adulation it got.  Be that as it may, this is where Seger does try to go soft and sensitive.  Leon Russel had a sterling reputation and standing at the time and so, perhaps, Seger felt out of respect he shouldn't turn it inside out to make it his own as he had the others on this album.  But for my money it is the only clinker in the set.  It breaks the vigor and liveliness of SMOKIN' O.P.S -which is too bad since its inclusion was so unnecessary.<br /><br />This misstep aside, the album picks itself up and plows right on through to the end.  Of special note is Seger's new adaptation of his regional hit \\"Heavy Music\\".  I have the original version on an old LP of Michigan local rock bands and favorite \\"one-off\\" singles.  I have to say the original version pales in comparison to this one.  Don't bother seeking out the earlier rendition.  This \\"Heavy Music\\" is definitive.<br /><br />Seger has said at this stage of his career he didn't quite know how to make records to draw the same attention and success that the Eagles and the Doobie Brothers had.  I disagree.  Just because his records at this time were largely ignored doesn't mean they were sub-standard.  He knew how to put on a fantastic show and that same talent spilled over on to his records.  Here's hoping Seger's BACK IN '72 is also brought back in a CD edition.  It is every bit as good.standing at the time and so, perhaps, Seger felt out of respect he shouldn't turn it inside out to make it his own as he had the others on this album.

068987474X|3.0|It certainly doesn't rule them all out. There are the type that are clearly wrong, but you can't put a finger on why.  Also, she emphasizes in this and her other book (the Daily manual) that men who are interested will let nothing stop them, etcetera etcetera (including in the way of sex).  There are two problems with this, it invites into your door those men who seem confident and give off a \\"nice\\" exterior but the type that your parents and siblings don't trust, it also keeps away the more shy types that try to pursue as well as they can but have either confidence issues or are getting mixed messages.  In fact, two of the most offensive parts in the Daily manual were the statements \\"you should never call a date.\\" Bringing to my next point, sometimes the thing that is letting stop the guy is YOU. When guys who have been burned this way before run up against this, they at worst back off, or at best try to continue to see you, but they can't get past the friends stage until you start taking initiative and showing some interest that might show up on the radar. Besides, if people keep claiming that women are liberated (I still think they have a bit to go) they have the right to call a date with any man (or other woman) they please.     <br /> <br />On the other hand, I gave this book 3 stars and not two or less, as many of the excuses were as she said. She also struck the mark for normal guys under most normal situations. But she missed for shy and/or effeminate guys like me. However, I'd only give a five if she made a version for guys called She's Just Not That Into You. Guys are much more insecure about this thing, though they tend to mask it with bravado.
B00000DWG6|5.0|Whenever a musical discussion centers on live albums, \\"Live at Leeds\\" almost inevitably takes the conversational forefront. This album could well be the greatest live album  recorded by any group ever. The Who's incredible energy and musicianship are more than captured by this 1969ish performance in Leeds, England. Here, they more than prove that when they were in their prime, The Who were clearly the best live-performing band to be found anywhere. \\"Young Man Blues\\" starts off like an earthquake and The Who are in full throttle as they rock the roof off. \\"Summertime Blues\\" clearly belongs to them as well, even though Blue Cheer and several other groups have covered it as well. I'll not go on here any further; I'm exhorting you to give this CD a good listen if you haven't yet done so and I am convinced that you'll agree that what I've said here is indisputably true of the legendary Who.
068987474X|4.0|Yes, some guys may be shy, but to me that means that they lack motivation and initiative to go after something that they want.  Who wants to date that guy?   <br /> <br />When I date someone, I want a man who is excited to be with me and not afraid to show it - not someone for whom I must draw out every action and emotion.  What I got from the book is, yes, there are guys who have legitimate excuses as to why they can't do some of the things that Greg says that we are deserving of.  However, the result IS THE SAME - these guys are still acting like they are just not that into us and it is not our job to \\"waste the pretty\\" figuring out why.  Sitting around trying to figure out what is motivating a shy guy will yield the same result as sitting around trying to figure out what is motivating a creep - wasted time!  Thinking any other way means that you are buying into the dangerous \\"I'm the exception, not the rule\\" mentality has kept most of us in these dead end relationships in the first place.   <br /> <br />This book is the truth.  How do I know?  Because I had a trusted male friend sit me down and tell me some of the SAME THINGS that are written in this book a few months before I got my copy.  Why did he do this?  Because he was tired of seeing me fall victim to dead end relationships.  His advice coupled with the wisdom from Greg and Liz in this book has made me a new woman.   <br /> <br />Stop denying what you already know is true.  Read this book, heed its advice, and set yourself free to find the person of your dreams. <br />
B00006IM9Q|5.0|Without buying the whole output from Blondie this is probably the best compilation. All the \\"hits\\" such as \\"Atomic\\", \\"Denis\\", \\"The Tide Is High\\" .... etc are all on this CD as well as some of the more interesting stuff: \\"Rip Her To Shreds\\" (about whom??), \\"X Offender\\", \\"One Way Or Another\\" ...\\"when the lights are all out, i'm gonna get ya..\\" <br /> <br />This is pretty much as complete as you are going to get on one CD.

Martin Lopez's drums shine here, Martin Mendez's bass also is hearable, and Peter Lindgren's guitars more brutal yet beautiful. Towering over everything are the great vocals and amazing guitar-work from the one and only Mikael Akerfeldt.

B000002JSJ|4.0|Zeppelin recorded their 7th album in the fall of 1975 under very trying circumstances. A huge world tour had to be truncated due to the almost fatal car accident of Robert Plant while on tour hiatus on the island of Rhodes. While Plant healed, Jimmy Page booked some time at the Musicland Studios in Munich and Zeppelin recorded 'Presence', their \\"meat and potatoes\\" record if you will. Using very sparse arrangements, just guitar, bass and drums, the band delivered a no frills performance. Being a follow-up to perhaps the greatest Zep disc of all in 'Graffiti' and recorded quickly and under duress, 'Presence' couldn't help being somewhat of a let down. But come on, after a six album run of sustained brilliance they were due to come up a little short. Released in March 1976, 'Presence' did fine commercially although less than previous efforts. Does it have classics?? You bet!! \\"Achilles Last Stand\\" is perhaps Zep's last great epic and one of pure musical genius. \\"Nobody's Fault But Mine\\" would be another popular favorite, brilliant harmonica playing from Plant. I like \\"Candy Store Rock\\" while it may not suit all tastes and \\"For Your Life\\" is acceptable to the standard. Only seven tunes on \\"Presence\\" and the funkiest of album covers with a 2001 kind of motif (the original title being the \\"Obelisk\\"). 'Presence' is a must have for the education of future Zeppelin diehards but may not be for casual classic rock fans.
B0009MDPYM|5.0|I really liked this movie.  From what I'm hearing, that's probably because I didn't read the comic book (or even know there WAS a comic book).  Comic fans were pissed that they didn't cast a blond haired British guy in the title role, and many considered Keanu a bastardization of the source material.  Well, tough.  That's why it's called \\"Constantine\\" and not \\"Hellblazer.\\"  It's not meant to be a direct translation of a comic book. <br /> <br />Constantine has a \\"gift\\" to see demons walking among men.  Because of something he did early in his life, he's forever damned to go to hell.  He's concocted a plan to send demons back to hell in order to gain the good graces of heaven, but after years of trying to redeem his soul, he has tacitly acknowledged it's a lost cause.  Keanu does a good job of portraying a guy who knows he's going to hell and is now just going through the motions.  Constantine is a sorry individual - and Keanu's deadpan and morose delivery is spot on.  The movie has some of the best scenes of hell that I've ever seen and the story really works.  I was actually so into this movie that I DID go out and buy the comic books - first ones I'd bought since I was a kid.  The shot framing, lighting, and dialogue are all very film noir, which makes for something different than most other movies coming out lately.  I dug it. <br /> <br />Anyway, just thought others might like the opinion of someone who's not obsessed with the source material.  I just hated reading all those negative reviews when the movie was a heck of a lot better than what they're saying.
B0000B3B95|2.0|I grew up being a huge fan of the Hulk character.  I collected the comics and watched the TV series religiously.  I was looking forward to a movie version of the Hulk for a long time.      Giving meaning for Bruce Banner's angst was actually one of the few strong parts of the movie story.  Certainly, every super-hero type has to have some tragic past to trigger his assertiveness to run amuck, and eventually do good deeds.  The highlight for me was Nick Nolte's portrayal of Bruce Banner's father.  He seemed to add some much needed emotion and fun to the film.  That withstanding, neither of the performances by Eric Bana or Jennifer Connelly were very strong.  The relationship between the two characters was confusing at best.  It's almost as if the intent was to have the viewer focus on the \\"spectacular\\" animated Hulk and the action sequences.  Unfortunately, it wasn't enough to save the movie.    Another problem is that the movie seemed long.  Most of the characters were so uninteresting, that most people likely spent their time waiting for the Hulk to make an appearance.    I don't mind saying that I was probably more critical than most after seeing The Hulk.  Realizing that most movie-goers remembered the TV series better than the comics, I think many people were scratching their heads over the character Ang Lee tried to create.  There were combined elements from the comics, the TV show, and some that he made up for the movie Hulk.  Even with all that \\"toying\\", there really seemed to be potential for a good story...but it just fell way short.       I think most can agree with this bottom line:  The movie lacked \\"warmth\\".  Ang Lee tried to make the Hulk bigger than he should have been portrayed.  People loved the human element of Lou Ferrigno from the old series...and the longevity of the TV show is proof of that fact.  Fans wanted to see him kick some ass...but they also wanted a performance that was, for lack of a better word, \\"tangible\\".    Hopefully \\"Hulk 2\\" willbe a redeemer.

B000059Z8J|5.0|I remember going to see Superman The Movie as a kid with my dad.  He was more eager to see it than I was.  Thinking back, it's great to consider we were able to enjoy something that spanned across both our generations.  So few things do these days.    The effects, the characters, the story, and the music in Superman The Movie are all fantastic.  It's also very cool to consider that, aside from a little modernization (circa 1978), the movie stayed true to the original story.      While the special effects were amazing when first released, I'm sure that by today's standards, a lot of it seems somewhat campy.  However, the flow and storyline are so strong, most of the aged effects are easily overlooked.            Most importantly....Superman The Movie just makes you \\"feel good\\".  Despite incredible abilities, Superman was still recognized as being vulnerable to emotion.  He had to deal with growing up on an alien planet and the loss of loved ones.  It made us consider...What would we do with powers like that?  He was someone who would do the right thing at any cost.  He wanted to make the world a better place.    How can we NOT appreciate a character like that?
B000002KEV|5.0|I heard this album when I was a teenager and bought it again after I heard some of Deep Purple's music recently.  Good sound quality, good music and good memories.  I especially like 'Child in Time'.  It gives me the goose bumps everytime I listen to it.  Deep Purple was a musically gifted group who stood out with their own blend of heavy rock'n'roll in the early 70's.  I give it 5 stars.  Enjoy the music!
B00080ZG10|2.0|What in the world happened to Martin Scorsese?  Here is the creator of Wise Guys, a man considered one of the best of the 1970's Golden Age of Film, but film by film his stuff gets more over produced, less insightful, and more expensive.  I saw it coming with Gangs of New York, but somebody keep Leonardo DiCaprio away from this guy.  They are awful together and The Aviator is one big expensive, good-looking bore without a soul.    In a documentary on Neo-Realism, Italian Post War Cinema, Scorsese claims he started with storyboards as a child, a comic book look that is produced giving the director a visualization of what the film will look like.  The trouble with The Aviator, it looks like a storyboard.  The replicas and animation of Hugh's weird airplanes almost steal the show, because they are the only interesting thing to look at on screen.  Howard Hughes is never fleshed out.  At least Kinsey, a recent bio flick tried to show why Kinsey was what he was, but DiCaprio's Hugh's is some kind of freak because his mother talked about diseases while he bathed.  There's not enough there Martin.  The bulk of the film shows a very young actor with no physical resemblance to Howard Hughes talking big time business and avionics without any back-story on how he became so brilliant out of the crib?     The women in Hugh's life are trotted out one by one.  He's a cocky guy putting his hand under a cigarette flappers skirt, a rich boy lover for Kathryn Hepburn (She doesn't come off too swell in this version), and Ava Gardner (No wonder Sinatra and Artie Shaw had it easy with this chick after the money-bags geekdom of Hughes). None of these gals are fleshed out other than Hollywood publicity shrek.    Don't bother with this one.
