B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Hard to put down. Enjoyed all of it minus the end which resolved everything but was not a great message. Like an eye for an eye....
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Good movie starts out slow but pay attention to the details.  Good action and story line.  I would rent it again.
B001NHNG64|5.0|Another great Jack Teacher story. Montana militia and others<br />make the mistake of underestimating Reacher.  Read it slow to savor the fun.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I couldn't stop reading this, it hooked me for sure, many twists and turns in the plot but a bit too gory for a 5 star rating
B004GYY714|3.0|It has some good to it but I was looking for one particular station I really like and I could not get it with this free version. So I bought the other one and am pleased with it.
B0041D843M|5.0|Our delicious American diet is causing our illnesses. We are suffering a slow death because of all the chemicals in our products and foods. Your health and the health of your families is in YOUR hands.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I love listening to WBLW and it is a northern Michigan radio station. I live in south/west Michigan and this does not come in on my radio. So the only way to get it is on internet. This allows me to listen to this station on my Kindle.
B009NY43NY|2.0|I had to buy it just to finish out the series but it wasn't even worth it. The books have gone down hill since the show started. So sad to see an author cheapen their characters and writing.
B00DDZM0GQ|4.0|I download it cause it was free and play it some times. I'm not sure I'm very good at it yet though.
B00EPC2ZOI|4.0|I find that this series is strikingly similar to The Killing in that it is drawn out and slow moving with a British spin, of course.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|I've seen this movie on TV several times and totally enjoyed it. I wanted my own copy so I can watch whenever I want. This movie is based on a true story and totally amazes me that Hachi was such a loyal dog. Diffidently a 3 tissue movie.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|I don't actually use,I downloaded it for a child. Child seemed to like it. So no personal connection to it. Kid LOVES~
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Good graphics but frustrating at times getting the hard to get items  But it is good fun if bored and works well on the kindle
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I don't actually use, I downloaded it for a child. Child seemed to like it. So no personal connection to it.
0156027321|5.0|My Grandson who is 14 had 3 books to choose from for required reading for summer. It was so easy to download it on my Kindle and did not have to wait to order it from bookstore. He enjoyed this book.
B005LHOKFS|5.0|I downloaded this app during a  vacation, and used it immediately to find good restaurants. We were in line for one, when one man came out (red faced) and complaining about the food and service. I noticed the trip advisor sticker on their door, and downloaded the app. I was able to find out in 5 minutes that the restaurant had horrible reviews 1/5 stars, and read the different stories. Saved ourselves thirty minutes (waiting in line). Totally worth it. PS the next place we chose was as good as it said it would be in the trip advisor review.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I have never read a book like World War Z, and frankly, I'm a little over the deluge of zombie-themed entertainment. The family did a blind book swap so that we could try out new things, and this was the book I got in that exchange. Wow, it reads like a documentary or extended news cast. I have to say it's the most realistic work of science fiction I've ever read, including Isaac Asimov and Arthur Clarke.  The sheer knowledge of the political, military, ecological and humanitarian global arena is astounding. This is Walter Cronkite goes to Mars.  Except it takes place on what remains of human life and human spirit right here on Earth. Formatted as a series of interviews after the war, it raises questions like what would global decimation do to people's spiritual outlook? What would be the long term psychological effects of shooting friends and neighbors? How would different cultures evaluate and rank which lives to save first? And what part of humanity would we have to sacrifice to ensure the continued existence of our species?  Well done, Max Brooks, and thanks for the nightmares!
B0048WQDIE|5.0|You'll laugh, cry, be sad but Heller so eloquently talks about the absurdity of war.  He really hit the nail on the head.
1451695195|1.0|I was extremely dismayed after receiving this book, which talks about God and Heaven in its advertisements and cover but instead describes a Christ-less Deception. Thus revealing that it's Heaven without Christ is a LIE, from the Father of lies Satan.<br /><br /> The Name of Jesus or Christ - Cannot NOT EVEN BE FOUND IN THE INDEX of the book.  His journey is full of the Big Bang, and a Cosmos Entity (that except on the book's  covers  description deception - he does not even want to call God.. ) I got suspicious after scanning through the book and went - on line to find more info on this suspicious \\"Heaven\\" he was describing before reading through it, as I HAD THOUGHT IT TO BE a Christian Book - AS IT WAS DECEPTIVELY PROTRAYED.<br /><br /> I found this link [...] , where in a wierd \\"New Age\\" type interview, he got honest and talked about his Satanic beliefs of multiple re-incarnations, ANTI-Christ views of many demonic paths to his cosmic Force \\"god\\" Heaven, (Big - Bang-Bang Heaven) spinning lights in the Murky Gray Darkness - and teaching voices telling him of the deceptive, Elitist, academic substitute \\"heaven\\" tale of Spiritual Darkness he would be instructed - he should tell.<br /><br />Not the TRUE Heaven promised by God and HIS Son the LORD JESUS Christ, the only True Way to an Eternal home in Heaven with God and Jesus Christ -><br /><br /> John 14:6 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.<br /><br />This book has been presented to be sold to and deceive Christians, as it was even being sold by Christian book stores - until they became cognizant of its Satanic Spiritual Warfare Deception Campaign - and many have NOW discontinued stocking it.<br /><br />Christians  - I PTL!  that God permitted me to find out the Truth behind this \\"Latter Days\\" Satanic Deception!

B005H9B2CE|5.0|Very entertaining. Hot cast. Fun plot. Better than I expected. Now I want to see the 2nd Thor movie. Set before Avengers' timeline.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I'm only half way through the book but so far I have been really enjoying it. Wonderful story telling and I can't wait to see what happens next.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|What can I say, either you like these movies or you don't.  So sit back and relax and enjoy the film.
B00B596VB2|5.0|For all the hate that this Gundam gets from it's series it has gotten some outright awesome kits.<br />This was my second Real Grade kit (The First being the RG Gundam MKII AEUG Colors) This is a really good kit with only one flaw.<br /><br />The Good.<br /><br />1: The assembly. This was an incredibly easy build especially for something so small and detailed. The actual Gundam I assembled in under six hours. When finished it can do any number of poses and the inner frame can be very quickly accessed if you're looking to show off.<br /><br />2: The stickers. I'm not one for stickers myself since they tend to be really hard to apply, not with this kit, the majority of the stickers available are easy to peel off of the sheet and just as easy to apply to the actual suit.<br /><br />3: The weapons, this kit comes with surprisingly large amount of weapons, a Sword, a Cannon, a Rifle, two boomerangs,two different shields, and holsters or mounting spots for all of these.<br /><br />4: The articulation: I don't focus on articulation but this kit deserves a mention, everything moves with ease, nothing tries to fall off (NOT EVEN THE SKIRT ARMOR LIKE SO MANY OTHER RG KITS) and it will look cool no matter what.<br /><br />The one bad thing.<br />This is my only complaint with this kit.<br />The backpack wing connectors aren't well designed, when I built these and even when I repose these, they don't stay on the backpack they will fall right off and then you have to reassemble them. Still a small gripe in an otherwise fantastic kit.<br /><br />This should be anyone's first Real Grade it's well designed, easy to assemble and fantastic to work with. Well worth your time.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Great show, I really enjoy watching this series can't wait to see how season tow will go for Mike and Harvey
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game is so much fun to play!! Its great to meet new team mates! This game is so much fun that the time just goes so fast.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I really like this game! I deleted my Temple Run 2 after playing one game of it! It is really fun fighting battles with charcters from the movies because it makes me laugh :)
B008K9SG9K|5.0|Only knew one of Imagine Dragons hits when I bought this CD.  Now thoroughly enjoying the whole CD!  Grab a copy!
B00BH0VSM6|4.0|I have read most of the Harry Hole books The Snowman is above all my favorite, but this book filled in a lot of gaps. Jo Nesbo just gets better and better with each novel.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This alarm clock app works great.  It does exactly what I need, displays an easy to read clock with an alarm feature. I love that the alarm volume starts low and increases over time.
B007N8RULO|5.0|I have loved the computer version of this game  for years and I am so happy to be able to take with with me on my Kindle Fire.  For some reason I never tire of this game.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|Baptized a Catholic, raised by an atheist care giver, the Zealot gave me a window into the context of living during the lifetime of Jesus as a man.  The book made perfect sense out of all the questions, speculation and historical documentation.  Sadly, however, it also reminds me that not much if anything has changed, i.e., Syria.....
B009RH9J7W|4.0|I have had this case for about a month and have found no problems.  It protects my Kindle Fire and is comfortable to hold or stand for viewing videos.  I would recommend as a great case at a reasonable price.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|As a latecomer to the Downton Abbey sensation, I have found the series to be fascinating and enlightening.  Amazon Prime allows viewers to start and stop the episode at any time and pick up later.  Season 2 has given viewers more depth to the main characters.  Definitely a winner!
B008XBCJ34|5.0|This movie is by far my favorite science fiction. Love, action, drama, and some comedy. The quality of the 3D is the same as in the theater. This and Jarassic Park are my favorite 3D movies to watch at movie with the family and popcorn.
B00B22ASUM|5.0|A very heartwarming story and the bond between a man and his cat. I could not put the book down until I was finished with the whole thing.
B00CPTUN5G|5.0|This movie is awesome, my 6 and 3 year old love it. I never feel that I need to censor or preview any movies with My Little Ponies. All the films are tasteful and teach good lessons about love, friendship and compassion. This movie is a little different from most other movies MLP has but after awhile, I think all good series should be adaptable and have the ability to evolve. The music is a little different but I think it appeals to more age groups without seeming like I baby movie.
B00ACP3OOM|1.0|I got the Neptune and charged it via USB. Then I attempted to connect it to my MacBook Pro. No luck...the computer didn't even know the device was connected even though the Neptune said it was USB connected. Then I thought, maybe it just doesn't work well on Macs so I switched to one of my PCs. My Samsung doesn't recognize it. My HP doesn't recognize it. My Dell doesn't recognize it. Nothing! Not even registering that a new device is connected.<br />[[ASIN:B00ACP3OOM FINIS Neptune Underwater MP3 Player]]
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love dragon vale and can't get enough of it. I all ready have  five rare dragons by experimenting the breeding cave by breeding different hybrids together. BackFlip studios this is your best game yet !
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|I read a lot of reviews saying there was a twist in the end but that so-called 'twist' was easily predicted about halfway through the movie. I read a lot of sci fi & this movie is written using a safe & predictable storyline, although you never see the so-called alien occupants of the Tet. I'm not a fan of Tom but it didn't matter when watching it. I enjoyed the movie, tho and highly recommend that you watch it.
B0094M4R3Q|5.0|I really loved this movie. A complete stress buster and so good to watch the littel Matilda with her skillfull tricks.
B003L77GRY|5.0|She just Loves Dexter and she loves her blu-ray player so I could not go wrong and I did good too.
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|My wife doesn't even like Startrek and loved this movie....<br />Now she want's to watch all of them so be careful if your not a huge fan...<br />You might create one...
B005FISBTO|5.0|And she just Loves Dexter, and its a very nice gift to give if that's what there into, and she very much Loved it.
B00EI6E17A|5.0|I love this song It's amazing and beautiful Everybody should listen it So great . Tell the truth it's vocal sound good Really<br />Love
B00915G6WQ|5.0|I have been getting all the Dexter DVD's for my Auntie's birthday, as she just Loves them, and now looks forward to them each year, it was very fast shipping this year, thank you.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Though I don't use them continuously, I use them 2 or 3 times a day and have done so since pretty much they came out.  I sometimes forget to plug it in and leave it out for a couple of days and it has no problems with charges.  In fact with light use, it has never run out of battery.  Sounds is perfect.
B009WUBERW|2.0|I gave it 2 stars because the movie was too long, too predictable, and too corny.  I did like that it contained multiple action scenes and I liked that mature actors were in an action movie.  The supporting actors were great and somewhat funny.  However, the cliche sayings taken from the action stars previous movies were overkill and especially corny; the last scene fight was soooo unbelievable; and the love interest was awkward.  I do not plan to see Expendables 3 and think Bruce Willis is the lucky one for being booted from the project.<br /><br />I recommend watching this movie only if you do not have anything else to do.  I was disappointed.
B00A285OOW|5.0|Great book! Continues the story of the Cousins War! I would recommend it to anyone interested in the story of the York family.
B00CS7ZIHI|2.0|So i thought this album would be awsome but there were only 2 really good songs on the entire album
B001EC0OMM|5.0|With that cast you just couldn't go wrong.  I great story.  I should watch it every year, but sadly I only get to it about once a decade.
B0063GORYU|2.0|Granted this is a free application but it's an ugly build with really slow action/behavior. Worth it if you must have a freebie app, but I'm going to upgrade to a nicer app with cleaner graphics and action.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Terrific &#34;fable&#34; where the good guys don't always win.  Well written and a very fast read and a very inventive story.
B0052RE4MQ|3.0|Basically, half the book could have been deleted.  I really like the plot and the characters, but there's just too much talking and not enough doing!!
B00746O3X8|4.0|I needed a chest harness to go backpacking with my D600 + Tamron 24-70.  It’s a pretty hefty combo and I got tired of slinging it around my neck.  I looked at the CottonCarrier and couldn’t swallow their $180 price tag. I took the Opteka on a 18 mile hike with a 40lb pack.  Bottom line: it did very well for its price but it’s not designed for smaller people.  It’s hard to adjust tightly and behaves like a lower chest / stomach harness.<br />--<br /><br />FIT<br />My main issue is fit.  I’m 6’0 and wear slim cut medium shirts.  I minimized all the straps on this vest and it still sags a little.  I simply can’t get it to sit high on my chest, so with a heavy pack on, the Opteka becomes a bit of a belly vest.  It still works very well, but the fit is more tailored for large guys.  If you wear size S or are below 5’-10” I would not recommend this vest.  Additionally, if your camera weighs more than 5lbs you should try something more robust.<br /><br />CAMERA POINT CONNECTION<br />It’s made of metal, and secures pretty well with a flathead screwdriver. After a few miles on the trail I did notice some looseness, but you can easily tighten back up by hand.  Opteka provides a mini key tool and you can add a little quick release chain ring to have it at all times.  Considering that a heavy camera is hanging by a pivot point, I think any system will be prone to some loosening in a hiking environment.<br /><br />VEST SLIDE CONNECTION<br />The piece that receives the camera is made of durable plastic.  The housing seems fairly robust, but the small locking bump inside the housing showed signs of wear and tear after 18 miles on the trail.  Catastrophic failure of this piece seems unlikely.
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|Before the first of these 2 movies ive never seen, anything star and never had any interest. because of the first one and this one im now a fan. i still cant go back and watch the old series or movies because i still have new interest but i believe this movie is for fans of sci-fi and action movies. i havnt met one person that saw it and didnt like it
B007EC27QM|5.0|Like it works well no problems with it at all. Easy installation updates are seamless a no nonsense calculator. You will be satisfied.
B00C061I3K|2.0|What was Daft Punk doing that 8 years before they released this? Its not the worst album ever but compared to Discovery this is nothing and it shouldn't have taken EIGHT years to make this. Yes it sounds crisp and really high quality but there is NO soul or energy whatsoever. The only song that made me wanna dance or even feel good was get lucky and that got old very fast. In conclusion the hype for this album is WAAAAY too high and daft punk pulled a dick move by keeping their fans waiting years for this.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|I love this alarm clock and recommend it to any one that wants  basic alarm.  This app I a wonderful Choice.
B003TOMAPC|4.0|This movie was way better than I expected; it was very well written. I loved the action scenes  & now I can see #2 in theaters this weekend :-)
B008K8U13K|4.0|Much like when they released &#34;New Super Mario Bros&#34; on Wii and DS, the updated graphics and features are really cool, and I love rehashing the old games, but ultimately they should have just released classic sega-genesis-style Sonic 2 on Android.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|My wife read it on kindle and would tell me what she was reading.  I want to check his citations.  If accurate it gives a whole new perspective on Jesus the man.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Fun game but still can't figure out how to add people who are not already on my Facebook.  VERY tempting to buy tokens which adds up financially for FREE games.
0399162097|3.0|I'm giving this three stars because on one hand, I thought this was a very unique concept for a novel. On the other, I just thought the writing was rather weak. I can't believe this is the same author that wrote [[ASIN:0452286530 The Jane Austen Book Club]]. The writing is totally different in this.<br /><br />The story seems chopped up, starting in the middle and going to the beginning and end and you're supposed to be drawn in but all it does is drag out the story even more. When you set up a story this way, you'd better deliver something big, and this book does not. Readers could guess the end (I did at least) but then it drags on for 100 more pages.<br /><br />The main character is incredibly unlikable, whiny and irritating, and you just don't root for her. You can't relate to her and her voice is not believable. This book had lots of potential but did not deliver.
B008BF9ZFM|4.0|This is a nice little rhyming book for kids. Tried it on my smallest and she liked it. This is good for those parents who need something new and different to read to their little ones before they go to sleep. I recommend it :-)
0553801473|1.0|What a grandiose waste of time!<br />I have not spent time so far to write book review as I was always finding more eloquent readers having their point across with more style, precision and analysis than I believed I could. Sadly this book has left so much bad taste in my mouth to ignore it.<br />First 2 books were excellent, intense with plot holding reader to every page, 3rd book was good as well but with signs of uncontrollably widening the plot, instead of streamlining it and leading into grand closing.<br />Fourth book was an opening to a complete disaster with obvious signs of writer's intent to dilute and milk this story as long as possible, as much as possible and he absolutely proved one of his book's main themes: there is no honor or limits what one can do when \\"making coin\\" is the goal.<br />I have bought 5th book with very low expectation, only because I have invested time into reading previous 4 books I wanted to give the story and Martin yet another chance. Heaving said that the author managed to exceed my already low expectations.<br />There are several reasons I am doing this today:<br /><br />1) There are some that dared to compare Martin with Tolkien, in my view that is a sacrilege. Tolkien was writing for the love of story and Martin is writing it for the love of money in very dishonest way to his readers. So all of you that expect masterpiece of storytelling without greed to earn more money by fluffing the story, don't waste time here. Martin and his story have lost their way and are on a road of no return.<br /><br />I will not return to them knowing that there is no honor in Martin's writing or his editor's intents other than milking this story for as long as possible and for as much money as possible.<br /><br />2) As a proof how big money matters, look at a shameful review from Los Angeles Times, praising this book as a masterpiece.<br /><br />3) You will find 5 star reviews on this site as well and overall almost 3 stars rating for this kindof garbage story telling (book 5). God bless their ignorance or poor judgment, I want to make sure that one more voice of disappointed reader is recorded and not lost in this sea of really bad taste.<br /><br />So:<br />1) Martin was widening story to grandiose proportions where it is impossible to follow main characters (who ever was a main character in a book or two before has disappeared from horizon or it became marginal in the new book and newly introduced or previously marginal characters are recycled to lead the new \\"story\\")`<br />Span of time between books (unless Martin was thinking that before every book his readers need to reread his previous books) makes continuity even more difficult.<br /><br />2) Story had slowed down to a crawl like every character is bogged down into mud up to a waist deep with no way or hope to get out of it at any time soon.<br /><br />3) Story is stuffed, stuffed and again stuffed with worthless fluff, reflections to irrelevant \\"details\\" that took pages upon pages, dead end branched chapters from the main story easily forgotten with no value for the overall story and names, names, names of absolutely meaningless characters and their family trees with again pages spent on something that never added any value to the main story.<br /><br />Martin's Book 5 is a pool of brackish water, a pool of mud you would never want to return to.
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|I have enjoyed Les Mis on Broadway and in the theater.  It's a fabulous show and the deal for this item was very good.  I received the DVD, Blue Ray and a downloaded version.  Great movie to be enjoyed anywhere, at any time.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I have it but never use it because it runs slow, you can only see what others are posting, can't check out other things on fb. What a bummer!
B004JHYRP4|3.0|The book is divided into 3 parts. The book has a lot of physics theories and it gets kind of boring after a while. The end also is lacking a satisfying conclusion. Unless you are a heavy asimov fan would recommend any of the foundation books, I robot, or the end of eternity over this book.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This was a wonderful ebook that helped the building on my ebook. I will recommend to everyone who is wanting to write a eBook
B003L16FAE|5.0|i love my predator blu-ray dvd it's good movie in blu-ray I seen the movie before in blu-ray much better
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|I really liked this game at first with all of the quests and points to earn. But it is hard to earn money and I am kind of getting bored of trying to get $6000 for one of  the sharks bit I only have  $1000. So fun at first though.
B00407PNWO|5.0|I love the movie. There is also a documentary about this film which is quite detailed.<br />There is a great cast.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|My friends told me about this game and I love it. I have all of the cars and places it's so fun. You need to play.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great book. A must read for anyone and I'm not fond of reading it had been years since my last book.
B0054SMIH6|5.0|This was an incredible movie! Kept me on my toes throughout the ENTIRE thing. You won't find many entertaining ones like this!. . .
B000FC146C|5.0|I couldn't put it down.  It was so well written and so intriguing.  I'm glad I remembered this book that I never read from my youth.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Ender continued to amaze with his intelligence and insight. It was an exciting interesting read. I couldn't put it down
B009KS4XRO|1.0|Game is great until you hit higher levels. I don't expect to win everytime but the difficulty to win is ridiculous so much so I only play when I absolutely have nothing elseto do. Glad I don't and wont ever put money into this game. I don't mind putting cash into a game but this one is not worth it
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|Improve the sound of your videos!  The cord is super long, too.  Just remember to turn it off or you will bur<br />n through the batteries.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I can't watch this movie enough times.  It is one of my favorites.  Quite violent for younger children.  Probably best for children over 13 years of age
B00E5Q1LTY|3.0|I have loved Star Trek for nearly 40 years: The original series and the movies that spun off of that (well, some more than others); The Next Generation and its movies; Deep Space Nine and Voyager not so much; and I liked Enterprise. And, I loved the first movie with this cast. Loved it. However, this one? Not so much. Forced action scenes... forced (not natural) interaction among the characters... and the biggest problem is a plot/storyline that is simply too much to take. Recycled is the only way I know to put it. Relying too much on past episodes. In my opinion it is just not necessary. It's one thing to pay homage to the original, but this is just uncomfortable. I still love Star Trek and I hope that for the next installment they simply make a good movie and not try so hard to tie into the plots of the original series.

1609613937|5.0|Dr. McDougall's life changing and life saving advice on adapting a healthy vegan diet. The weight loss I am experiencing is nothing compared to how good I feel and the energy this diet provides. A must read for its simplistic and compelling explanations on how diet causes disease and can reverse it too!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have found so many great ideas on Pinterest and have recommended it to several friends.  Constantly changing so can look at it everyday.

B0033TJATW|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies with Michael in it. Classic movie and always wanted to own it on DVD.
B00C1BHQXK|5.0|Revolutionary! I've felt for a long time that my supposed ability to multi-task has been actually inefficient. This book explains why.
0345347951|5.0|i have read this story many times and i love the audio productions immensely. this novel examines religion, technology, the human condition and life kind's place in the universe. it tries to examine the implication of the question of ultimate destiny and why man exists. i get emotional when i think about the evolution of the overmind and those who are left behind. the futility in this universe of trying to improve the human condition while the human story's last chapter is being written. it is a very moving story and i recommend it without reservation. it would be a great movie or series on tv.
B005V5WBFG|1.0|I purchased a one year subscription before the free trial expired. It was a waste of money. After the day the free trial expired I opened the app to run a scan and it said the free trial had expired and wanted me to buy a subscription. I tried updating the subscription information and nothing happened. Wish there was a good anti-virus app for kindle.
B00008LKDY|5.0|After hearing Rachel Podger on Vivaldi's La Cetra I went straight to Amazon to order this SACD disk as well.  I was so impressed with the other concertos that I had to have this one as well and am I glad I got it.  The SACD sound is absolutely superb and the playing is gorgeous, perhaps even better than the other disk (but my opinion changes with whichever one I'm listening to at the time.)  Rachel Podger is fantastic with this material and my only complaint is that there is not more available.  I play both sets on my Blu-ray player (set to default to SACD when such a disk is present.)  If you like Vivaldi do yourself a favor and get both sets.

B007TG34QU|5.0|It's great that so much of Vivaldi's work is now available on CD and this SACD recording boasts terrific \\"you are there\\" sound.  I picked this up because I've always liked Vivaldi, was unfamiliar with these concertos, and was curious about the SACD format.  A winner on all accounts.  This was my introduction to Rachel Podger and all I can say is where was I?  She's terrific in these pieces and well accompanied by the Holland Baroque Society.  I was so impressed that I immediately purchased the La Stravaganza set and was equally impressed.  If you're looking for more Vivaldi than the Four Seasons (as great as those concertos are) and fantastic sound to boot then look no further.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|Very cool stuff.  Neat to think of all the great albums that were recorded in the exact same place!  Also a great history on recording technology over the past 40 years.
0152465073|5.0|The first time I read this book was in high school, and at first glance it looks like a kids book. Well, yes, it was written for kids, and is mostly found in the kids section, but don't let that fool you. This book has great meaning behind each experience the little prince has. It keeps making you think, and brings up new thoughts each time you read it. It's one of those books that is good to write your thoughts in the side areas and then let someone else do the same. Its called sharing the experience and your ideas with others, while they get to share back. PRICELESS
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|I love this dictionary.  It helps you spell the word even before you get to the spot where you were having problems spelling it.  It is great for the definitions.
B0014LX420|4.0|Its a greatest hits album and its Britney Spears, I got it because I liked a few of here tunes back in the day. We all grow up sometime so its good for what it is but not my type of music anymore.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Bingo blitz is addictive and lots of fun. Join a group and it becomes even more fun. Can be expensive if you buy lots of coins or credits.
B007U8U1V8|5.0|This is the first thing I've listened to from Jack White outside of White stripes, and its amazing love Jack White way of fitting words together. If your a fan of music you need to own this.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game and very additive. Keeps you thinking. Objects and some passwords are in some places you would never think.
B001B9BEF4|5.0|The White Stripes, are a band worth the listen, if your just discovering them or a long time fan, not a bad record ever came from them.
B001EC2J20|4.0|It still was a good movie, but I liked the original Matrix better. This had less action, and some stupid things like a 5 minute sex scene and a long speech about what we already knew. However, the plot was still interesting and fun to watch.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|This was such a awesome movie, I loved every min. of it. Not only did it connect all the other marvel movies, it also progressed the story well. Looking forward to the next installment.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This has to be one of my favorite books. I don't want to give too much away so I'll keep this short. Everyone will be able to relate to Charlie and his friends. The movie is just like the book in case anyone was wondering.
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|I love Lana Del Rey's old-fashioned, soulful voice. She is a true leader in music today in my book! Her songs evoke emotion that some other mainstream music does not. Definitely recommend this to others!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This was a love story that grabs you from the beginning.  The writing was very well done and she had a way of making even the most kinky scenes flow into the story.
B0097PW7H8|1.0|I used this for about 4 days and had to remove it.  Each night it would never allow the phone to charge to 100%.  This morning it was at 61% and 10 minutes after I unplugged it the battery dropped to 34% and about 10 more minutes later the phone shut off - dead battery.  Not sure exactly what the problem is but it had to go.
B005PK1G76|5.0|I have no kids. But searched endlessly for just the right thing I wanted to put on front seat of car, to be able to reach over and get stuff.... and when putting on breaks doesn't go flying off the seat. This was perfect and LOVE the Quality of it.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|A few hours of think time.... pretty cool :) I am looking forward to a new room when it becomes available.
B007L3BMGA|4.0|I started it out of curiosity and could not put it down afterwards. Much more than just a S&M novel... Interesting plot and very well built characters. It's a must read!
B00AES0AZI|5.0|i have read many, this one got me excited as i was able to follow it all of the time, my fave is still lightning, but this one comes close as far as edge of your seat excitment is concerned
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I loved this puzzle. I really liked that it didn't require backtracking through a million screens....just work the changing puzzle. I'm not good at puzzles, needed every single hint, and took several sessions to complete, but I never got too discouraged to continue. I am definitely ready for more like this :)
B005COO1X6|5.0|Another Stephen King gift to his &#34;constant readers&#34; ;) Pulls you in right from the beginning and keeps your attention until the end!
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|David Tennant is brilliant and so far after the first 2 episodes I am locked! Everyone definitely should see and follow along.
B0041D843M|4.0|The author does a great job of arguing the link between an animal-based diet and a variety of diseases that plague Western societies. However, more research into cultures with almost exclusively animal-based diets such as the Inuits and their propensity for diseases would have built a rock-solid case for a whole foods, plant-based diet. Even though I agree that eating a diet of whole, minimally processed foods (dare I say organic?) is a common sense approach to a healthy lifestyle, I am not totally convinced that animal-based protein is the scapegoat. I am a believer in moderation and moderate amounts of animal protein (with tons of fruit and vegetables) is ideal for a total health.
B0063IH60K|3.0|It's good just too much ad annoyance. I wish there was a way around the ads it all seems to be dating sites doing the pop ups. Just because I'm playing solitary doesn't mean I want a date for crying out loud! I'm just sayin...it is very annoying
B00AAQHP66|5.0|Read the book and had to have the dvd of the movie....had a hard time finding it locally....found it at a great price...perfect companion to the book !!
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|This is an excellent account of the history behind the times of Jesus, as well as the disciples and especially Paul's depiction of Jesus. I learned a lot from it.
B00992CF6W|2.0|my sister will get all the new updates on her android tablet but I don't get any of them on the kindle.  This makes me so very upset since I paid for this game. I would love for me to have the new updates...
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Very good read, very easy read.  kept my attention the entire book.  always a fan of Nicholas Sparks.  looking forward to the next book.
B000000XB9|5.0|Very good album and very nostalgic.<br />Loaded them on my iPOD and also in the car to enjoy as I drive for my commute.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|The book and story moved right along, however the ending left the reader up in the air and I really think the ending was anti climatic. If you choose to read it, I wonder if you would agree it should have ended about a chapter earlier when their get-away-from-it all vacation was coming to an end. I cannot say more about where I think it should have ended and not give away the ending of the book. Had it ended there, however, I think it would have been really stunning and then I would have given it a 4 star rating.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I got this for my nephew's son who is five years old and I loved the fact that the game asked for specific information as to how old the person was who was playing.  It was made age appropriate and my nephew's son loves it!  Very cute game and it's exciting and also challenging even for a five year old.
B008518MOW|5.0|i loved the movie, but did not see it in 3D on the big screen.  I had to see the 3D effects.  well worth the money.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|i really liked the game i gives you a chance to test your thinking skills and just an opportunity to have fun with a game , i like the varieties of fish you see and the coral you see , its a cool game
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Complete season three of the Downton Abbey was fantastic.  Looking forward to watching season four when it starts up again.  Hopefully season four starts soon in the USA.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|This game is very fun but there are a couple tricky ones. This is a good game for any age
B0078ZTWP4|5.0|Just what I wanted for camping.  The price is good, takes little room but puts out a good amount of light.  Glad I got it.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game, its so much fun!! My daughter even joins in for the puzzles and she's only five. I just wish the energy would last longer, it's frustrating having to wait for it to renew.
B004C3DLJ8|5.0|If you watched Toy Story 1 & 2 you must watch Toy Story 3.  It is as good as the other 2.

B000FC1MCS|5.0|I could not set this book down. I'm 19 years old and I absolutely loved it. I could feel the boys pain throughout the book. It was very clever to write from his point of view. Wonderful! Please read!
B004AQR29C|3.0|Lots of shoot em-up bang-bang action and that is why you watch this type of movie.  It stars Sylvester Stallone how could it be bad?
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I'm a sucker for teen book series in future societies like Divergent and The Hunger Games, and I'm soo excited to finish this series after reading this book!! I also can't wait until the movie comes out next year, it should be good if they stick to the book
B004ADF7RO|5.0|This was an excellent movie. Classic movie from the 80's.  Everyone in our family loved it; teens to my 8 year old...
B002G1K82Q|5.0|Watched the movie before we went to Liverpool and it was great to see all the songs that were turned into a story.  We will surely watch it over and over!!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I read this very quickly...it definitely kept my attention.  It reminded me a little of the City of Ember.  On to the Shift and Dust series.
B009G41CG2|4.0|I really like this game.  This a good way to unwind.  There is always a challenge. Anyone can play this.
0316056871|3.0|I didn't find her book very funny. It was informative, but not funny for me. I took it on vacation and left it in the hotel's library. I'm sure someone else will like it.
B00846REIS|4.0|Much like 50 shades, this book kept my attention all the way love story that has intense drama , and meaning.
0446585041|5.0|If you love Ellen, you will love her book. It's written exactly the way she is on her show or stand up. Funny throughout.

B003G4W49C|4.0|My first read in year's and I loved it. I just wish there was more to the story line. Bye
B006LSZECO|4.0|Mostly a good book...a few parts got repetitive but worth picking it up for sure! Kept my attention.  Good twists!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was amazing. It was written beautifully. The love between these two young people was something that brought tears to my eyes.
B00CATSONE|4.0|The name \\"Tesla\\" has become commonplace only because of its adoption by the famous maker of modern electric cars. This short biography highlights the contributions of Nikola Tesla to the fields of electricity, lighting, motors and much more. Tesla faced a constant uphill battle to win backing and support for his brilliant ideas. Most notably, Tesla took Edison to task, claiming that AC power was necessary to widespread distribution of electricity, rather than the DC invented by Edison. He finally got the backing to prove it, and altered the world as we know it; however Edison's name went down in history as the inventor of our electrical system. The U.S. Patent Office stripped Tesla of his radio patents and assigned them to Marconi; only after Tesla's death was this decision reversed and he was finally declared the \\"father of radio\\". However, people remember Marconi - they don't know about Tesla.<br /><br />Tesla died at 86 years old and earned over 800 patents during his lifetime, contributing vastly to the technologies of the twentieth century. In spite of this grand accomplishment, he died penniless and alone. I think there is a deeper analysis of Tesla and his relationships with others that could have been included in his biography.<br /><br />The first part of the book is a rehash and quotes of information you've probably read elsewhere. For instance, the author repeats Malcolm Gladwell's premise in \\"The Outliers\\" that at least 10,000 hours of practice in any field is necessary to achieve competence. The final part of the book is a sales pitch for the author's other book on the topic of genius, which is available for charge (not for free as this book is); so it seems that this short book exists mainly to pique interest in a book for sale - a useful marketing strategy; however I was hoping for a little more information in this book. There is probably a lot more to write about Tesla than just the list of his inventions and accomplishments.
0875428940|5.0|We have specific decks that are used so often, they need replacement every 5-6 years.  This deck is patterned off of the Rider-Waite (Coleman) deck, using the same French system of card progression (versus Italian card layout, which has some sign. differences).  The symbology while a bit different (more pagan oriented), still lines up with what the Golden Dawn standardized, with a few deviations, but if the student understands metaphysics, has studied RWSD, they will have little problem adapting to this deck.  The colors are vivid which is a huge plus over the slightly faded hues of the RWSD, tends to be (unless you've bought the new Coleman deck).  Robin Wood was an illustrator for Llewellyn Press, before she decided to 'tackle' a updated, pagan and more current deck.<br /><br />This deck delivers time after time using various layouts and with more background material to draw from (flora and fauna), helps make readings more complete.
B004UPANAI|3.0|so, now we now where Wolverine came from although the special effects were not as impressive or realistic as other x-men episodes.
B006VFLIYK|3.0|Gets a little slow near the middle.  It's ok, not great.  I need to type more words to submit this, but everything is captured in the first 11 words.
B008Y73940|4.0|Got to love a movie where you sympathize with the guy everyone hates.  Never read the book so I enjoyed the spoon-fed Hollywood version.

B0095P31L6|5.0|Our 3 yr. old grandson loves watching this movie over and over on my kindle.  I wish he could put it on his kindle too.
B00AZRP2GA|5.0|Some of the grammar wasn't perfect, but it made the book more human - loved it and can't wait to read more! Keep it coming!
B00DDXJRJG|2.0|On my Kindle Fire 8.9\\" this program runs in a screen about as big as a cell phone screen and I can barely get my fingers to accurately tap on a menu item.  Also the volume is rated 0-19 (which I like) but if you press the mechanical Kindle volume buttons on the side of the Kindle, the program is unaware of what you are doing.. It does not track with the actual volume unless you are exclusively using the program controls.  The equalizer works but again the controls are so tiny and the change in tone is very dramatic.. I need bigger controls...  I am hoping that there will be improvements coming down the road because this program has some good potential.
0393345084|4.0|The book was delivered on time and was in amazing shape for a used book.  It is a lot like reading a text book so I have to read a chapter a day.<br /><br />The subject matter is very interesting. Every republican congressman should read it.

B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I play regularly. Never pay. Some puzzles are a challenge. Some are really easy.  I have it on my phone and on my kindle fire.
B00138GY5I|5.0|What can go wrong with this purchase.  I enjoy this music so I purchased it.  It would be silly for me to rate negatively for something downloadable.

B0000E6XH3|5.0|Loved the music sequences, the characters and the story that speaks for itself thanks to the lively and vivid images.
B009WUBERW|5.0|gotta love the expendable series... total action... good acting for this type of film... amazing cast of stars... pretty decent story... a good one to put in, grab a beer, watch and enjoy...
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Such memorable characters. Great insight into what it is like to be a paraplegic. Was funny, sad ad everything in between.
B001Q4Z5Z4|1.0|The film was fine.<br />It kept cutting out on me, and I never was able to finish it out of frustration
B008M34INW|4.0|Edge of the seat all the way. In a class with Lethal Weapon and just below Road Warrior. Great atmosphere of Mexican prison &#34;La Pueblita&#34;.
0241951453|5.0|When you read a novel or short story that transports you in time, then you have something special.  This is the perfect example of that, it is an incredible book.  The company from whom I purchased the book was quick and professional.
B003PBB4ME|4.0|A handy handle for a consumer camcorder.  Even with my old Sony Handycam from the '90s it held it well.  There is a bit of flexion in the handle, but with an open plastic handle that is probably impossible to prevent without running a steel rod through it and making it way heavier.  While carrying it for shots, you'll have to compensate for the flexing by avoiding abrupt moves that may cause a wiggle in the image.
B001HM1PFO|5.0|I watched this movie for the first time my junior year of high school to learn a song we were singing that year in choir & loved it.  I can not think of a musical that has such a diverse but great soundtrack.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game is addicting and lots of fun. Each stage of the game becomes more strategically challenging. It now ranks among my favorites.
B0060CTLOI|5.0|I bought this for my daughter to tide her over till a special Disneyland trip that will let her meet her favorite character from this movie.  It's still as enjoyable to me now as it was when I was younger.
B003B02O0A|2.0|It was a one chapter book when we received it, so I guess you would need more chapters. I don't know what happen, but I would not recomment this book.
B00CWVG1Z8|3.0|I was really interested in seeing this movie but I found it hard to follow.  My 11 year old daughter on the other hand loved it.
B0049J0CTM|5.0|So great!! Always a great time! Good enough to watch over and over again! Definitely a must buy! Yay yay yay
B003VIWO8Y|5.0|Great book great for any megadeth fan.totally captures and informs you about mustaine life if you didn't know about it already.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Something to make you think. Not a run of the mill hidden object adventure and puzzle game. Great graphics also.
B009G41CG2|4.0|I enjoy playing Mahjong on my new Kindle Fire, it helps me relax, and also my brain isn't in overdrive as I play.<br /><br />And it can go where I go.
B000HX4ZF6|5.0|Movie has some sketchy scenes that should be fast forwarded through in the presence of small children... great story line and decent acting. I'm a little biased towards movies with this theme..
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Well written, well researched and simply amazing. I thought I knew about the biblical time but this book taught me more than I could imagine.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I am completely addicted to this game! I even use my boyfriends Kindle to be able to play more. I just wish you could collect every 12 hours instead of 23.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|Watched the movie with my daughter and had to close my eyes several times not to see those highly realistic and scary details. The movie is great, very touching. The actors' play is incredible, even little ones'. Highly recommend it
B009VA1FN6|4.0|The Secret Keeper is a very good read with a surprising twist at the end that made me want to immediately go back and re-read the book armed with this new information. The book is a bit slow to really get going though.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Martin's writing flows beautifully, and his descriptions of food, clothing, sex, and battle are irresistible.  I can't stop reading it!
B00E8B1P9M|4.0|Good role for the Rock, also Bruce Willis always giving his personal touch to his movies. We enjoy it !
B007AL48UK|5.0|If you love playing Mahjong than you must get this App.  It's another fun way to enjoy &amp; play Mahjong.

B00DC7N9NS|5.0|really liked this break with reality. fun adventure. nice special effects. not too spookie for the average 6yr old. no nightmares.
B000SUKPKM|5.0|Love this group! Several hits on here! A walk down memory lane! I very much recommend this group, and this Greatest Hits!
B003MOHX8S|4.0|I bought this album based on other reviews that said it was the best one 2SFH has done. If so, it is the last one I'll buy. Not because I think the music is no good; I actually enjoyed it quite a bit. It's that once I was listening to the album the second time, the selections started to sound the same. Not a lot of stylistic variety here and not much that makes one track very distinctive from another. Fine for listening once in awhile, but certainly no steady diet.
B003JSU2NU|3.0|I listen to this every now ,and then. I have the collection of books, so I wanted the music, as well.
B004KPS90E|1.0|If I could I would rate this zero stars! The storyline was awful as was the acting. Would not recommend!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|If you don't watch this show... You better!! Hooked immediately. Cannot wait for season 4. You'll be hooked for sure
B008XKSW7M|3.0|If you are looking for great cinema, this isn't it.  It is a fun movie if you are looking for a fun diversion with some chuckles.  Good for a mindless couple hours of entertaining.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|A heart-warming story.  Told in a fairly humorous style more or less throughout.  The characters were very real and the life situations easily related to.  However, not many of us have experience of quadriplegia - personal or close at hand.  I found it very insightful and it made me think much more deeply about how 'quality of life' can be interpreted.
B0076XIS4O|4.0|I enjoy bands like Ladytron, Goldfrapp, Hooverphonic and other electronic bands with hard beats and lilting female vocals.  If you like those you might like this.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Uplifting series to watch.  Such gentle wit and a good plot running through this delightful programme.  Makes me go to bed all the happier!
B00CWY76CC|2.0|I have tried and tried, do not understand this.  Getting absolutely no where. No directions.  Nothing, to guide you. Any help appreciated.
B00CO52NLI|5.0|I loved this app! the only thing is in the free version you pay more for dogs and cats than you would in the full version with everything but the reptiles which you have to pay another dollar for.
0307263118|2.0|The story of the Emperor's Clothing comes to mind when I read a book as poor as this, so lauded, so celebrated, but so dull. Banville has written some very good ficiton, but not this.  What's going on with book prizes? And same person who suggested I should read ATOMIC CITY by Sally Brean, recommended this. Oh dear. Think I'll stick to non fiction and the novel laureates and the guaranteed greats like Chekhov and Nabokov, and Saki (for the laugher)....
B0063M22QO|4.0|great game my wifes favorite plays everyday its a couple of games in one, can move up in difficulty fun
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This is a fantastic app. Anything you want to know can be found through its use.I can not think of a single factor that could be added to improve it.
B004478AS4|5.0|This book was an intriguing read filled with turmoil and hate, family and tradition. An overall great read with  powerful message: Leave not a family which gives you everything and asks for nothing more but equality in return for a group of strangers who will control over share.
B00DHSK3RM|2.0|Only gives clues to a few of the levels. Jumps from very beginning to levels 200 something to 300 something..
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I thoroughly enjoy watching this program.  Acting, directing, production are of high standards.  The story line is very complex yet easy to understand the intricacies of a changing time for aristocracy.  I enjoy the depiction of real life drama that effects all human beings.  No one really escapes the challenges of life, some just create discord for others in order to mask it in their own lives.
B005LAJ22Q|1.0|I'm clearly in the minority of opinions but I am struggling through Season 2.  The first season was exiting and fun but the second season concentrates on the characters which should enrich the show but the endless meandering of all the characters and the horrible dialogue has the opposit effect.  I just can't seem to care about any of the characters.  I think the series has been poorly cast except for the talented Scott Wilson.  I have a couple of more shows left of Season 2 and will hope for the best.
1419705849|5.0|The Diary of a Wimpy Kid series is excellent! I bought this book for my eight year old nephew for Christmas and he was so excited when he unwrapped this gift! Part of his excitement was just being able to own this book. A lot of his friends have this series and this was the newest book at the time, so he felt cool that he had it too.<br /><br />My nephew enjoyed the cover design of this book and he loved that it was a hardcover. The inside was great, and the words were simple enough to read, yet just the right amount of challenge for him. He loved the pictures, and he thought it was cool that it looked like a kid's drawing. He actually started drawing his own similar pictures with his own story. It was an all around fun experience for him.<br /><br />As a grown up, I thought this book was great. Like I said, I enjoyed how the words were simple but challenging (at least for his age). The pictures broke up the text to not make the book seem too big and intimidating. I think Author Jeff Kinney did a great job writing this book. It's definitely a great, fun read for young boys and girls of both elementary and middle school age.<br /><br />I would recommend this book, as well as the rest of the Wimpy Kid series to children looking for an interesting book. My nephew is a reluctant reader, but this book was able to peak and keep his interest.<br /><br />Happy Reading!<br />Brianna Lee Book Reviews
B000VDUWMC|5.0|This is one of the great books I've read. Quit impressive. Its explanation on why there are differences of development among countries makes sense. I also have had such question, and it's been solved after reading this book.
B00782O7NE|5.0|If you haven't seen this movie yet, you should!  It's inspiring, funny, sad and a must see!  I highly recommend it.
B008JFUO0Y|5.0|And I don't care if that's really a word or not ! All I know is the last 90 minutes was one of the best horror films in years, and I'm not even a gore fan, but wow they out did themselves. I saw the original when it first came out and loved it, the series kinda went downhill, but they often do sadly. But they have brought this film back to life, kicking n screaming and I just loved it. Minor spoiler here, so don't read a couple of lines if your worried about it ..... But ..<br />When they blew the 2nd arm off the blonde first thought through my head 'now she's 'armless'  and I gotta admit I laughed so loud I scared the crap out of my cat !<br />Not many horrors you can do that in & still love the movie.  5+ stars I'd watch it again and will be telling friends to see it !
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|If you like music and haven't seen this movie yet, what are you waiting for?  Funny, cute, inspiring and classic!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Couldn't put it down!  One of the most memorable stories I've ever read.  Buy it, you won't regret your purchase!
B00A81NFAS|5.0|This is a great movie!  You should take a chance and watch it... wonderful acting by all the actors. Great!
B004ZGI1V0|3.0|lots of action<br />interesting at the begging and a good brain twister but failed at the last half and on the ending
B003DNN0L2|5.0|Our son first saw this movie when he was 4 and we now own the soundtrack and make references to it all the time.  A must see!
B000YMM3CC|3.0|Th  movie was good not much to say. Hope there is other's that would live this. I wouldn't buy it on DVD or buleray.
1476734941|5.0|Practical advice which I feel can be easily followed by most people. I've lost 8 lbs so far and will keep going.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|This is the best cartoon I have ever watched.  And it's one of the very few things that was awesome that came out of mtv.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|insightful yet very entertaining. Clever use of humour, also educational as it gives you a birds eye view of what its like to have aspbergers. Great plot too.
B00821OX98|2.0|The show is not as interesting/plot wise. Compared to other sci-fi shows that I have seen, star trek/continuum...etc. The plot is not as interesting.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is allsome 2 modes I played it. It was allsome and there were mobs ad you can turn mobs off. This game is allsome
140006922X|5.0|If you're a Catholic - or a fallen-away Catholic - this book is an excellent source of information that answers many of the questions that have bounced around your head for years.  Is the New Testament really a &#34;comic book&#34; like you read when you were a kid, or are you really expected to believe all the unbelievable things that fill it up now that you've grown up?  Was Mary really a virgin all her life and did the family really go to Bethlehem to have their properties valued when their properties were left behind in Nazareth?  Was this man really the &#34;Son of God&#34; and nobody paid attention when he actually, physically arose from the dead and appeared before them?  Was Peter the Rock really a man strong enough to hold an entire religion together after Christ left, despite his previous weakness in front of the Roman militia?  Was John the Baptist really beheaded the way the bible tells it, even though that story sounds like a Hollywood version?<br />Get a more realistic, grown-up version of what really happened; what history really is.  Check our James the Just.  You'll be impressed.<br />What it will do to your religion, I don't know.  But at least you'll have a more realisitc understanding and be a step ahead of the Muslims, the Jews and the other religions built on dreams.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|The first book had me intrigued enough (despite the annoyingly similar 50's story line) to continue to the second in which I fell in love with the characters. I was put off on purchasing this book because of the overwhelmingly negative reviews. I needed more of Eva and Gideon, so I waited a few weeks, then made my purchase! I hurried through this book, hungry for any bit of information I could acquiesce! There was further development of their relationship and further character development of some of the side characters.<br /><br />I agree with some of the reviews in regards to the annoying whiplash of feelings and how Cary was being portrayed but it was all appropriate for the character. We get Eva is insecure and Gideon is scared--if they responded differently it wouldn't be in keeping with the core of the characters. The book was well paced and slightly unrealistic, just as being the 12 richest man in the world would yield. You need to give in to the fantasy, the desire and the well developed characters.<br /><br />I have no qualms with cross fire going into 5 books, and I think the pace of the series is appropriate. The more the series develops the more unique it comes. I would  recommend this book and series to someone looking for a good romantic read with a slightly dark undertone with love being in the center! Happy reading!
B000GJ0KOG|4.0|the movie was good , a little slow, lots of life lessons in it, turned aout a pretty good movie all in all
B000YMM3CC|5.0|I always enjoy this interesting and intriguing story line. It is refreshing and the acting is great! It's a must see
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|not quiet what i expected but still all around a good movie that i enjoyed very much, will watch it again
B003ZIXO0C|3.0|I thought that Celine Dion would appear in some scene. I've already have the cd with that songs, but it's ok.
B00005O3VC|5.0|had scene it years ago, still just as funny and stupid, still laughed at bunches of stuff, still good dry british humor
B008220BP2|5.0|This was an amazing movie, I can't stop watching it!! The soundtrack was THE BEST soundtrack I have heard to date in a movie! The acting for R was down right believable. You actually feel for him and Nicholas Hoult was great for the part! The hidden message in the movie is probably somewhat hard to understand for some people. But I got it. It was a fantastic film!
B0021L8V0M|4.0|a good movie, lots of running scenes a little slow but a surprise ending, worth what i paid for it
B005EHQGTS|5.0|Great App does what it says! Also performs very very good, and easy to use! Fast downloading as well. Love using this.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|OMG! OMG! OMG! Words don't fail me now. I have just fallen in love with a book. Like I want to marry it. No, wait! I want to rub its pages all over my body in hopes that it will permanently tattoo itself onto my skin for all to see. I was only at 60% & felt this way. After reading the other 40% I can say that if I could give this more than 5 stars I would. I'd give it 10! Five for me just doesn't cut it! Emma Chase you are brilliant!!!<br /><br />\\"She's like a Rubik's cube. So frustrating at times that you want to toss it out the goddamn window. But you don't. You can't. You're compelled to keep playing with it until you figure it out.\\" Drew Evans<br /><br />Drew Evans has convinced himself he has the flu. That is the only explanation to him not leaving his apartment for seven days with a mess, the smell & the ache he is feeling. But we all know different. He is a hot, arrogant, banker. Who seduces beautiful woman of New York with his award winning smile. Until, one night at REM changes everything. Kate Brooks is a beauty not to be reckon with. She is hired by Drew's fathers investment banking firm. The professional completion she brings to the table is pure brilliance and mind blowing. Kate turns this dashing playboys life upside down. But his over confidence threatens to ruin it all. Will be be able to untangle the web he has spun and rise to the most important challenge of his life? Can Drew find his way to love?<br /><br />\\"When she was trying on clothes for me. I swear, I felt like Richard F&$@ing Gere in Pretty Woman.\\" Drew Evans<br /><br />Only one other book has made me laugh like this one. knock Out Love by Pella Grace! I read this book since she gave it such a great review. =) Sweet Jesus! This book has everything. Hot cocky smart banker playboy Drew Evans. I love you!! You are amazing. You kept me laughing through this whole book. I really adore books like this. You had me at Humor & Braveheart! I wanted to tangle myself in your presence and own you. These two compete with the gloves off where anything goes. This is where for me I laughed so hard & waited to see what would happen next. Drew's narrative was cleverly brilliant, playfully hilarious & amazingly fabulous.  I loved the relationships in this book. My favorite besides Drew & Kate was Drew & his niece Mackenzie. How special and sweet. The things that came out of that little girls mouth LOL is was gut wrenching funny. I went to bed after reading this laying there with this huge smile on my face thinking for awhile how great it will be to write a review and recommend it to anyone. It is so worth reading. No wonder it has gotten such amazing reviews. Thanks Emma Chase for a truly fun filled book. I enjoyed every word. *Reviewer for Book Bitches Blog* [...]
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|I originally had this when I had an iPhone and now that I switched to the Galaxy S4 I happened upon this game when it was a Free App of the Day and instantly downloaded it. I love playing this game!!
B00DULWFZE|5.0|Great album. I really like that the guys had complete creative control over this. They're older, but they still know how to make a catchy love song!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Great App does what it says! Also performs very very good, and easy to use! Fast downloading as well. Love using this.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Awesome fun summer read! You'll be thinking about it when you're not reading it! Great twists and the writing is fantastic.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Love the game.super fun.That being said, I  wish that it would update to have the new tracks and vehicles. Guess I'll have to sideload the new version for that.wish amazon would keep up it would be better that way.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Both my husband and I love it. Puts us to sleep almost every night now. Love that it's free! :)
B00498YZFK|3.0|Good movie...a little disappointed with ending. I think Jennifer Lawrence did a great job...good suspense. Just needed a little more from the climax.
B00932A4XE|4.0|I enjoyed this movie. It was funny with the men's side of child care and wives. I loved the togetherness of the Dad's group.
B0047WJ12K|5.0|in the course of watching it 2-3 times, I was able to apply many aspects of the film to my life.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I thought this movie was very good despite my reservations from hearing others.  I would recommend this movie to anyone.
B007R0WHMK|5.0|Loved every second of it. It was a story told in the most brilliant way. Fairytales tend to be pretty cliché, but I think the ending of this one was unlike any of them.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|Great Movie...good follow up to the Fellowship of the Ring series.  Would recommend it highly.  On time and as advertised.  thank you
0061714372|5.0|Wow. I'm blown away at the honesty frankness and openness about his life, to say nothing of such a wild, roller coaster life story. Couldn't put it down!
B005UDD1R6|1.0|I used this app with out Internet for long time. I hen one day it requires me to use Internet to use<br />. I have downloaded New app and deleted this one as the new app doesn't require Internet to use.  And no I didn't have it linked to th drop box or anything that required internet
B002RI9ZPY|5.0|A breath stopper, I've read the trilogy more than a few times.  From start to finish not a dull moment. The real crime is the death of Stieg Larsson, Think of the books that he could have written.
B004SN77SS|1.0|I have other minimulist shoes which are great. These shoes however are very clunky and uncomfortable. I am returning them.
B00CIFK316|5.0|I never get tired of the holmes/watson adventures...mainstream tv peaked my interest at the introduction of lucy lui as watson...but i feel the oldies are the goodies (no offense lucy)
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I can confidently say that I in fact thoroughly enjoyed this book. I suggest that you buy it and experience it for yourself.
B0026772N8|5.0|I read this book in my late teens and reread a few times to my now 38yrs.  This book surprises me with a new lesson each time I complete it.  There should be one in every person's library.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|This game is creepy but fun. I love it, the background music is amazing and creepy. Love it, if you are thinking of getting it you really should
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I've always enjoyed Masterpiece Theater, my husband less so. He watched a couple of episodes of Season 1 with me, and made sure we didn't miss any of the following episodes. He thought he had Season 3 set to record, but we were watching episode 4 when we realized we had missed an episode. We refused to listen to anyone discussing the story and waited until we could watch the season on Amazon Prime. Now we can't wait until Season 4.
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|Great transposition from original series and has the feel of the same writers having a hand in this.Watch it soon!
B00CF2UORK|5.0|Shaun the Sheep is great quirky fun for all ages.  Our whole family, from our 3 year old Grandson to his 90 year old Great Grandma, laughs out loud at the antics of the sheep, sheep dog, farmer and friends.  Highly recommended for good, clean fun.
B004CFBMRY|5.0|Interesting book on running.  Easy to read and very informative. Great piece of writing. Enjoyed reading it, and was hard to stop reading.
B00EI6E0QM|5.0|I've loved Mother Monster since Poker Face and this one was right on par! :) Can't wait to hear her new album!
B005HJWWW8|2.0|I have a AKG K142HD headphone, and want to drive it better to get better sound quality. It's a 55ohm headphone, I guess it's within the driving ability of this Amp. I use iPhone5 connected with lightening ot 30pin adapter(bought in apple store) and Fiio L9 line out dock. But the sound is exactly the same, no difference!!!! So don't waste your time and money to buy such useless product. Perhaps E11 would be better, but not this one.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|Great, challenging app. It really makes you think and can be hard at times. I would recommend to anyone who likes a challenge.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|As mindless entertainment its good flick.  The story line is weak and predictable but acting is good and special effects are very good.
B009NYF612|5.0|DiPalma's homage to Hitchcock. As always, great music score enlivens this thriller. The only negative is that any actor would have difficulty carrying the film as the protagonist is passive, even in the third act. Still, a must-see.
0307887448|5.0|Video game playing, scifi loving, geeky forty-somethings who spent a good chunk of their college years in MUDs are going to LOVE this book!<br />The on the very first page there is a reference to Ghostbusters that my friends and I used (and continue to use) way too much.<br />Page 1.<br />I was hooked.<br />And it just kept getting better!  I want more, but to be honest, I don't know if you can really top this in any way.  It's so perfect just the way it is.<br /><br />The story is tight and well edited.  It seems every word needed to be there and there's no 'filler'.  There are so many books that droll on and on in places that don't really do much for the story, so this refreshing, to say the least (and it would have pleased my high school English teacher immensely).  I couldn't put it down.  I haven't read a book that I enjoyed this much since the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series, and I'll probably read it again, and maybe another time after that.  Don't get me wrong; there are a lot of really excellent books out there that I thoroughly enjoyed, but this one is the first one in a long time that I desperately wanted to share and talk about as I was actually reading it.  Some very odd text messages were sent out by me while reading this book.  Personally, I'm glad I didn't read any reviews before I read it.  Each nugget of pop culture or movie or music trivia was a such pleasant surprise that always made me say something out loud ('yes!', 'awesome!', 'no way!', 'oh that's just cool'), and the ones you figure out just before they hit you with it in the book are amazing and so, so satisfying.  Finally your inane ability to remember the oddest things at the screwiest times pays off, and it didn't even cost you an E ticket!
0920668372|5.0|This book was so precious, I wanted to share it with Mandy's nieces and nephew.<br /><br />Hoping this will be a fave for them.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|Interesting perspective on the passage of the 13th Amendment. I thought it was a bit long, and was glad that I was able to. break the viewing into a couple of sessions. Still I found the movie quite interesting and entertaining.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a simple but very functional calculator and I use it everyday, for both my business needs and personal needs.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|Kind of ironic that I get this on blue ray,<br />When I almost got it on hddvd back on the day.<br /><br />Ive seen these movies a couple times, so getting the blue Ray was<br />An easy choice. Will go into my collection next to godfather collection, star wars collection.<br /><br />I more you can stream most other movies but for me I like having a disc to pop into my player.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I really enjoy this app!  It's fast and colorful, and a quiet way to spend some spare time.  The pop-up ads bothered me at first, but I found that you just have to click home then the game button, and you've avoided the ad!  No big deal.<br />  It is a really good game, and it keeps great statistics.
B007Z9QWVK|5.0|I didn't realize when I rented this movie that it was a story within a story, and not just a biography. I really enjoyed it and wished I'd seen it sooner. Really liked all the characters/actors. Thought it was well cast.
B008DW6VOQ|5.0|Good stock portfolio tracker that works well on a Kindle Fire HD.  Stocks can be entered into the portfolio easily within the app. I did not try importing a portfolio. Very nice graphics and intuitive interface. Some data is missing for foreign securities.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I paid no attention to the Downton Abbey buzz for years. Once I started watching I had to go through all 3 seasons so I am ready when season 4 starts in January!
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|OK, it says it will work with an iDevice of your choice, but really, it's made for Android devices - Googles bread and butter.<br />When trying to activate the product from an iPhone, you'll get a splash screen saying the an iOS app will available soon for Chromecast and then it didn't do any kind of activation.  I won't say the advertising was intentionally deceptive, but its limitations on an iDevice were very muted.<br />Either way, the small number of available channels even for an Android device are small. I'll be sticking with ROKU HD UFN.
B00CFYAT6O|5.0|I love this band and they get better and better with each new release. I want to see them live.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I am enjoying the clock, alarm and pleasant sounds to wake up to. I am very glad I made the purchase.
0321934318|5.0|An excellant and entertaining guide to editing, organizing and processing for novice and experienced photographers alike.<br />I always learn something new reading a Scott Kelby publication.
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|You will need to watch this several times to catch it all. Watching it just once will leave you confused..
B00CEK9OTM|5.0|This app took a bit longer than some to load, but once it loaded I have had no problems with it at all. It is a labyrinth puzzle. The kind you tip your device to make work. while the game is simple to understand it got challenging right away. If you like a challenging game that makes you think and work at winning you will love this game.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|No other word for it!  This intelligent medical doctor is completely swept off his laurels by the supernatural event that he experienced.
B00795P4EG|5.0|I take photo's with my kindle fire all the time, but because of the way the camera is set up, I usually end up with my shoulder in the corner of the photo. With this app it was so easy to go in and literally erase that from the photo leaving nothing but what I want to see. Occasionally with more complicated back grounds, it leaves an odd looking spot on the photo, but for most of the simple backgrounds it looks very normal afterwards. I definitely recommend this app! I have had no trouble saving the photo's at all, but I did have to start over on a photo when I tried to pause the process once.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great app!  Good as a teaching tool to improve your observation skills. I love the option that allows you toselect the type of deal you want - winning,  random,  etc. If you miss a play you can replay the game and /or get help along the way with the best move Icon.
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|For me this documentatry was amazing. I got chill bumps and a knot in my throat while watching. A must see for music lovers.
B005VPRFSY|4.0|this was for my grandson, he loved it. easy to put together with little supervision.I will order again just as a surprise for him.
B005MSD6QU|5.0|Love Criminal Minds, and Season 6 is a bundle heart pounding and nerve wracking awesomeness! I would definitely recommend watching this Season - even if you've never watched the show, you'll still be hooked.
B000FC11A6|4.0|learned a lot about cryptography and how to weave past, present and future together in a book, good for WWII fans.
B00BRUYNBE|5.0|I can't believe I only recently found out about Walk Off The Earth, but since I have, I've been listening almost exclusively to their music. Still have yet to hear a single thing from them that I don't like.
0985557834|5.0|i like this book very very very  much! oh by the way did I mention that I like this Book very very much!
B008602KQI|5.0|Enjoyed the movie.  Watched when I had free time.  loved the characters and the story.  Looking forward to another movie
1476734941|5.0|Ok, I admit that I was a skeptic. But I tried a day of modified fasting as suggested in the book. It wasn't that hard! And indeed, I lost weigh 4.5 pounds the first time. All water weigh, right? No. I regained a couple of pounds, but I felt less bloated. It seems my system was flushed out. Really! The bloatedness did not return and I feel better. I've fallen off the diet more than once (more like once a week), but it is easy to get back by fasting the next day. I actually follow a modified fast about three times a week.  On non-fasting days, I eat pretty much what want, but find it easier to push back from the table. I am drinking at least 64 ounzes of fluid a day often with a tablespoon of Benefiber -- helps keep me feeling full.<br /><br />In one month, I have lost 10 pounds. And it has stayed off. All this no appreciable increase in activity (aka exercise). After 6 weeks, I am still losing 1-2 pounds/week. I feel better.  My clothes fit better.  Even my blood pressure is lower (127/73 average vs 137/81 before).  There has been one problem - irregularity. Even with the Benefiber.  But I'm learning how to deal with it.<br /><br />I highly recommend trying this diet. It is very forgiving and easy to make up for lapses in eating.  I've never had such success with a diet.
B000002LFZ|5.0|Came in great condition and the CD itself is really good. Had no problems and still have none. The bonus is I only paid a penny for this.
B001XUJNJ0|5.0|Even better than the first time I saw it many years ago.  Magnificent film!  Awesome performances by Morgan freeman ( of course) and Tim Robbins (I don't think he ever matched this again...)
B00ECUARO8|1.0|the girlfriend and i both thought this was a terrible movie--slow moving, implausible, and unengaging.  and i'm reluctant to criticize children's work product, but the kid who played neckbone did a horrible job.  how did they find a kid who was unable to play a kid convincingly on the screen?  i've been misled by the critics again.  see also &#34;silver linings playbook.&#34;
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|I learned more about the bible & the life of the writers than ever before.  It was easy reading & interesting.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|If you liked Season 1 and 2 then you will definitely love Season 3.  The guest cast members are a real treat and the storyline just keeps getting better and better.
B00C7E3EFU|5.0|love this movie the fog is spooky and chilling it is a classic with an all star cast the fog is one great movie to watch this is john carpenters best movie.
B005779X4U|5.0|This is the third in a series of Simple Human products we've purchased for the kitchen, and have been impressed with each one.  The bin is indeed smudge-proof and designed to lift the two buckets out easily.  As our recycling is co-mingled, the separation is unnecessary, but we find we place glass in the large section, and paper and small plastic containers in the other.  The separate buckets also make is easier to tote downstairs to the large, curb-side collection recycling bin.  The large foot pedal is appreciated by my petite foot as well as my partner's size 15s, and we find the &#34;silent close lid&#34; to be a very pleasant feature.  Our trash bin which is also by Simple Human, does not sport this feature and I've found the bang of the lid to be a bit distracting when used repeatedly.  Overall, we are very pleased with this product.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. Great story that hooked me from the first page.  I look forward to the next book in the series.
1568363931|3.0|The book provided good recipes and decent info. Even though many food arrangements were shown in color, I always prefer food pictures to be colorized instead of the unappetizing &#34;black and white&#34; photographs.
B00CHNKJFO|5.0|I grew up playing pinball and they have always caught my eye every time I walked past one.  Being a huge star wars nerd I downloaded this and now I can't put it down.
B0060V1WJ6|5.0|This is as manly of a chic flic as possible.  My wife wanted to watch it I was dreading it, but I was pleasantly surprised.
B00DHSK3RM|5.0|This is a great way to pass time that doesn't require a lot of focus.  Try it, you'll love it!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|just a great production, that takes you into it's world without excess. well done acting and production. a must watch
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I got this app for my nephews, so that they can have something to keep them occupied.  They absolutely love it.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Asian presents the historical Jesus in a very objective way. We see a Zealot Jewish man who was angry with the occupying Romans and the corrupt high priests in Temple. We also see that it was  gospel writers (most who never knew Jesus and wrote about him many years after his death) who turned the historical Jesus into the celestial character that has led to modern Christianity.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Even though the curse was broken in the first season, somehow this series goes on. The introduction of interesting new characters and plot lines keep it interesting.
B008HK3XU4|4.0|This is a great little cover for the price.  I like the ability to prop up my Kindle and read hands free.
B000002OAZ|4.0|Had the LP as a kid, and wanted to hear it again.  There's some nice Clapton, Phil Upchurch keeps everybody groovin' (like always), and Wolf sounds just like Wolf!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I have a Samsung 46 in mounted on the wall.  My wife likes clean no wire look.  The I have a HDMI and USB port right next to each other, so no need to plug this into the wall.  My wifi router is on the same floor on the other end of the house (30' away) The Chromecast works great on Netflix and You Tube using my phone or tablet.
B007AL48UK|5.0|everything is about the same as the regular making but the times are different but I enjoy this game is fun. the change is good and is relaxing.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Cant wait for the next book to come out in March 2014.<br /><br />This book got me back into fantasy again. I loved it and especially loved the additional drawings that were included to supplement the story!
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I think knowing the love language of your significant other opens up a whole new door to a happier relationship!
B002SSUQFG|1.0|I was unable to coordinate the time with AM/PM. Could set the date and the time. Instructions were cloudy, at best. Wasn't worth the effort. I returned it..
B0097EWK3A|4.0|This was one of the first hidden object/mystery games I'd ever played, and I was just blown away by the graphics and tiny details of the game. I like that you can &quot;organise&quot; the evidence. It was a little heavy on the back and forth between locations, but that may have been due to my inexperience of hidden object games at the time. If you're just starting out playing hidden object /mystery games, or are an old pro, you will enjoy this game! It was a little on the creepy side, so I'd recommend it for mature teens and adults. No problem installing or playing on my 1st gen Kindle Fire.

B00DUGCLY4|4.0|Great game if you are looking for something to pass the time. Addictive although not too challenging. Would recommend if you are looking for some easy thinking.
B004JHYRP4|5.0|The Gods Themselves is a worthy winner of Science Fiction's greatest annual award - the Hugo.<br /><br />An extraordinary tale of a parallel universe communicating with ours and exchanging matter to provide an apparently inexhaustible source of copious quantities of free energy, with the serious flaw of hastening the Sun's course to turn supernova.<br /><br />One drawback of this story and many of Asimov's early works is male-centric nature of it.  There are practically no women in his early stories.<br /><br />An unusual and amusing feature is that the first chapter is labelled &#34;Chapter 6&#34; as it is written as series of flashbacks.
B009CF7JDU|5.0|How can you not love this Classic 80's Hit.. It gets better every time I see it. My kids even love it!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|this game rules highly addictive fun just wish bingos and coins didn't cost so much and would like more ways to earn them
B003JUGQ38|5.0|The final full season with David Tennant is full with exceptional quality episodes where Steven Moffat delivers a classic with his 'Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead' two-parter. Catherine Tate improves as the season wears on but David Tennant is always sensational. I laughed, I cried a lot... I miss him but Love the new Doctor
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I find Hosseini's writing style easy and enjoyable but I was at times confused by his jumping around to different time eras.  Sometimes I was unaware as to which character was narrating the story.  The ending seemed as though the author wasn't sure how to bring the book to a close so he stopped abruptly.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I am addicted to this game and so is my mother. We play everyday and try to see who can get the most bingos. I highly recommend this game to everyone
B009UNGYHG|5.0|I bought this to protect my earpiece and I am glad that I did.  I am going to buy another one.  It charges the earpiece while in the case.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|My favorite movie of all time used to be, &#34;It's a Wonderful Life&#34; and I still watch it every Christmas, but Avatar surpassed the classic.<br /><br />I watched the movie in the theater in both 3D and 2D and could not wait for the DVD.  This 3 disc edition is fantastic because you can watch the extended version as well and it's worth it.<br /><br />If you love stories which become metaphors for historical events, then you will love this.  Watch the movie for fun...then watch it again and think about the Europeans coming to the continent they named America, systematically destroying a thriving culture to the point of genocide and Avatar takes on a new meaning.<br /><br />I am giving Avatar 5 stars and calling it my favorite movie of all time because not only is it action-packed, beautifully shot, acted well, perfect length for a movie and wonderful music but also because there is a very, very deep meaning to the story...one which cannot be denied or ignored by intelligent humans.  Avatar is powerful...like it or not.
B00EEXST2K|4.0|I thought this was a good film and well worth my time. Performances were great, especially from Ms Syfried and Mr Sarsgaard. This movie, at one point, doubles back and you see the VERY ugly side of what happened to Linda. If the movie piques your interest then read her book \\"Ordeal\\" to really hear the whole sordid tale. I give this 9.0 stars out of a possible 10.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Very informative and interesting. A little too advanced for me on the medical technology part which I skipped and moved onto the parts I could understand. Overall I recommend it...great opportunity to move into better health.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I like it so far it's fun and I can take it any where I was looking for  game as a time filler
B00C2FFJFM|5.0|I absolutely love this album though it might not be one of her best work it is still a great album. If you like music that is non stop dance music (EDM) then this album is for you.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Nice to have this so readily available on my Kindle,  easy to download and has different game layout  to play
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|What a great cop show!  Great balance of action and smarts with a shocking start and a compelling story line.  Michael Chiklis is brilliant bringing out as a savage, ruthless cop who still allows the audience to connect with empathy.  at times I almost understand why he does what he does.<br /><br />love the series, was sad to see it end.  To me it is similar to Southland, which is another brilliant and underrated cop drama.
B008MY9HPK|5.0|Must read book , I can relate my  life in so many ways if you are in you 40's and unsure what you really want out of life. This book can give you some understanding
B006YTTVHO|3.0|Since I consider myself only a fair conversationalist, particularly when I'm mixing with strangers, I thought this would be way more helpful by providing some tips I could use in those awkward social situations when it's difficult to make conversation.  However I found nothing new in this book.  Perhaps it is more helpful for people who rarely or never socialize or for extremely introverted shy people.  The average person already knows the things that this author includes in the book.  A disappointment, however, it was free so I'll give it 3 stars instead of 2.
B00B2JSRAS|2.0|I'm not a nay sayer...can only speak from my own experience. I tried the excersises in the book and they didn't work for me.
B00ECU2SGS|4.0|This was a very interesting and different movie.  The story and characters were believable and just plain enjoyable.  It is a story that you could easily convince others was an exciting part of your own growing up in the south.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Loved it so far. Eagerly waiting to start watching Season 2. Hoping it lives upto the high standards set by season 1
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|This is a fun way to kill time! Lots of different challenges. Nice graphics. I recommend this game. Not too frustrating, just a great game to unwind with.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|This requires a lot of brains and smarts it is very fun and addicting. I would recommend this to friends and family. This game is very fun and New to me. I just got today and I'm already on level three. This game is fun a great to help pass the time. When your bored play this game or when your upset play this game. I love love love this game.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Was a good book kept you wanting to read more. You need to start this on a weekend when you have time to read
B0043KK4N6|5.0|After watching the movie, I knew that I had to have to soundtrack.  I love all of the songs.  I have it on my i-pod and listen to it at work all the time.
0061703087|1.0|A swarm of human-created nanobots becomes self aware and is able coordinate and form more complex organisms and / or interface with already existing organisms (such as humans).  No one can deny that Crichton has a knack for engaging story telling but the premise is out to lunch here and it grew increasingly far fetched as it went on.  Unfortunate because one of the things he is known for is believability.  If you can suspend belief on this one you may enjoy it more than I.
B002ZG9774|5.0|The Blu-ray dvd is just what I wanted.  I love this movie.  It is a great musical with great songs.  The special features are a good bonus.
B006IGZWB2|4.0|The movie was extremely well done and I enjoyed it as much, if not more, than the book. Highly recommend.
B0085Z8F4A|4.0|It arrived on time. Sealed, everything in its condition. Now we like to watch the movie and critique it.  Not in a bad way but  just us People who watch these movies and go over the dialog.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|A challenging fun game.  You need to have a good eye and a steady hand.<br />It takes a bit to get through some levels.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Great Book.  The story line kept  me interested through ttill the end.  I have already recommended toseveral of my friends.
B00AALX5SI|5.0|Love Love Love Katy Perry and loved this movie a definate \\"must see\\", I laughed,sang along and cried she has been thru a lot, but above all she will do anything for her fans that she loves.  That is the true meaning of a Rockstar
B005J9ZFQG|5.0|is there a 3rd one  evil dead III  just wondering  i thought there was but can't find it anyware  thankyou
B0047Y17P2|5.0|Great book by great author! Definitely an awesome read! Always full of suspense and Michael Connelly never lets me down!
B00992CF6W|4.0|There is this weird glitch i discovered that makes an object more than it really is for example: 1 diamond =16 diamond and everything else as well. I don't like the glitches because it defeats the purpose of the game and then it starts to get boring. Just hoping that they would fix it.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game is a bunch of really awesome fun and enjoyable for many people. I rate this two thumbs up.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love this game been playing for about six months would recommend to anyone and its free.best when you connect to Facebook.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|Have enjoyed all 5 seasons so far they keep you coming back episode after episode love the characters and actors have bought many of the tshirts and other stuff
B000002L68|4.0|Researching old music is always good! Gladd I found this album for a reasonable price! Got here a little late but it made it!
B002RUA524|5.0|one of his funniest books. well written.gives an insight into how he started with the zoo & conservation.highly recommended for a good laugh.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|Has action and comedy, lots of cursing and a good amount of gore.  Not for those with an easy stomach and has some rather graphic scenes but overall a very good movie.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I'm not one to be particularly drawn to \\"cancer books\\" with their melancholy stories...But, The Fault in Our Stars is a terrific read. This book is a smooth easy read as well as it is complex and proposes many in depth observations on life, death, and love. I was attached to my kindle until I finished it.
B005544TRQ|5.0|There are not many shows worthy of 5 stars. SUITS is the exception.  An incredible cast that never disappoints. SUITS is nothing like other &#34;law firm&#34; shows.  It's much edgier...
B00CZAYNOC|1.0|I have a friend who has this cd so i thought hmm ill check it out, being a fan of their first cd, i thought i would at least give it a try. Well i wish i hadn't. Just like some good metal bands of the past, FFDP sold out. This disapoints me. Well if you're into the pop type metal well maybe give this a listen but if you are a true metal head you do not want to listen to this garbage.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|What an amazing look at the life of Jesus - &  from a perspective that is completely new to me.  I haven't finished the book yet. It's very challenging for a non-academic like me, but well worth it.  It gives a global perspective to the life of Jesus and lets the reader look at Him in a human form most of us can relate to.  A person who believes fervently and passionately and knows he can change the world. A rebel??  After 2,000 years, there HAS to be something to his teachings!<br />And thank you to Kindle!  It's great to be able to look up the words in the on line &#34;dictionary&#34; as I read it rather than stopping, finding a dictionary, etc.  Made it much easier to read and follow and learn.
B008S4FZ6E|4.0|OK, I came to this as a Duranie from the first day I heard them (Planet Earth), so I'm too engaged perhaps. Nevertheless he's a good writer with a sharp eye for the significant detail or event. And its a good memoir for the times, told through the changing fashions and twists and turns of pop music.
B008JFUO0Y|3.0|I thought that this was released in theaters with a 3d version?? Am I wrong? I have been waiting to buy it when the 3d version comes out. Also I'd like an unrated extended cut if that will be released any time soon. Does anyone have this info??
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Very entertaining follow up to Percy Jackson series.  Great job continuing the story of Camp Half Blood.  You don't have to have read Percy to follow the story.
0375869026|5.0|My daugher was assigned this for summer reading, rising 6th grader, but the whole middle school had to read it.  She really liked it.  First book she'd read which is written from several of the character's perspective.  I read it and loved it as well.  I think it should be required reading for adults as well!
B00AB7HESI|4.0|I love it its worth every penny so many things to draw all this really 99 cents for more worlds boo after you beat it you get bored am I right? I am the lion I will Roar! For my rights
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|Was an compelling story, but the connection between fantasy an reality was forced, in my opinion fantasy<br />should seem real.
0062255657|3.0|Even when he's off his game, Gaiman is still great . . . and he's off his game here.  The Epilogue mentions that the idea for this book started as an idea for a short story, and maybe Gaiman shouldn't have tried to expand it to book length -- or if he did, he should have worked harder on the ending.<br /><br />In 'Coraline' and 'Stardust' (even though they're more novellas than novels) there's a satisfactory resolution at the end.  Similarly, his longer novels, 'American Gods' and 'Anansi Boys' come to a definite resolution.<br /><br />This one just sort of tails off.  The threat to the main character is defeated, the malevolent whatever-it-is is overcome, and then . . . nothing.  The main character seems to be living a 'normal' life, but we don't hear much about it, and his ally during the book is off somewhere in limbo.  It's as if there were another three pages at end of 'American Gods' describing how Shadow went into some dead-end profession and drifted for twenty years and never did much of anything of note ever again.<br /><br />Gaiman should either have expanded this one to a longer novel and done something with the main character -- preferably something which involved how the events of the book touched/changed his life in significant ways -- or he should have cut it to a novella or long short story and omitted the stuff about the main character's dull life.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|I  was way excited when I  downloaded  this app. especially  when I  saw all  the options.  however I  quickly  realized  that the app  won't save the picture to  your  phone.  only  receiving  one star  from me. sorry.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I love this alarm because it doesn't blare at full volume like my old traditional-style alarm clock. It starts off nice and low and then increases in volume. When you create/set an alarm, the app saves it for future use. You can have your alarm repeat on specified days (i.e., wake me up at 6:45 am on mon, wed, and thurs...wake me up at 7 am on tues and fri...etc.). You can have more than one alarm set at a time. It has a snooze feature. There are features on this app that I've probably yet to discover....but I'm sure that when I do...I'll love them, because there's nothing to dislike about this app. This is it. This is THE alarm clock. Look no further....download this one!
B00821OX98|5.0|Great characters, story line and visual effects.  Can't wait to start the next episode when the prior one gets done.
B00CLD671A|5.0|Enjoying this season's developments, especially Matthew's anachronistic behavior around the management of the estate and Lord Grantham's reactions.  Love the dowager countess's character as well.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|I chose this rating because the book moved slowly. I loved how the book opened and was excited for an adult fairy tale. I was upset when the book went back in time and spent the majority of our time in his childhood. I liked the ending but also was not completely satisfied with it. Most fairytales end in the happily ever after. Sometimes I could not follow the action when the supernatural and mystical world was interacting with the real world. I would recommend this book to a fairytale fanatic and the like.
B000YJ54DU|5.0|Jack Reached does it again.  Solves the crime, gets the girl and heads out for parts unknown.  Gotta love it.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|Wasn't sure at first but the more I play the more I want to play. Interesting graphics. Love this game.  Very Addictive.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|If you like minions and constant action, this is the game for you!  Very quick moments necessary to keep your minion on the right path.
B008GXHOFW|1.0|The game looks aswsome and is probably fun to play,but at what cost? I downloaded This on my kindle,only to find out that it takes up over that majority of my kindle space! Buying this app is your decision to make,but keep in mind you'll suffer the loss of a lot of space. Hope this review helped!
1847946240|5.0|This book is well written and covers subjects that will be studied for years. It is a must read for anyone in business - understanding the dynamics of behavior and how to improve your profits. It also gives great insight into one's own personal decision making process.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|I gave this game three stars because the game itself is genius. But I was deeply disappointed in the loading speed. When I played the game on an iPod the loading speed was quick and easy,so I thought that it wold be the same on my kindle-WRONG. It just would not load. It would take about 6 minutes or so at a time,and I mean literally! I also did not like how the tutorial was set up. In some cases,while it was showing you what to do,it locked you out of your kindle,the only option would be to turn it off. Now this may vary from kindle to kindle,but I was not impressed. How the review helped!
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|well written very enjoyable book on what is know historically about Jesus and what has been manipulated by the church. It is very difficult to find an objective, sensitive and fair book on this  subject but this was all those things (and a good read!)
B009WO7NQO|4.0|I actually thoroughly enjoyed the game more than I thought I would. It has plenty of cool Star Wars characters that have cool abilities. The levels were also consistently difficult which made it enjoyable. The only problem I had was that the two bonus stages cost money to access. I do however like how they give you free powerups regularly. Overall it was an amazing game. Great for kindle fire! Hope this review helped!
0385344228|1.0|I read this book for a book club. This is the first novel that I have read by the author and I will probably give one of his other books a chance before i write him off for this one. First of all, the ending was absolutely horrible. And the deus ex machina of the father's friend was a little too convenient. The plot had promise but I would have liked to have a clearer understanding of the how's and why's of the maing incident.
B00632HWOG|5.0|For those who don't want to have to get on yahoo.com there is now a more efficient and faster way to check your emails! I love the app. Great for kindle fire. It's simply,but not too simple which is what I like especially about it. Would highly recommended this to this who lime to get it done fast.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|I find that this app is fun but has a difficult side to it as well I have been trying really hard to pass this one level
B008YU0AOE|5.0|Okay, I'd like to start by saying,this app kicks butt! It is flat out awesome. Every math problem you could encounter can be solved with this app. It is a great back to school tool. I would totally recommend it for any age!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Smart puzzle game, it will keeps you interested.  It is one I would pay for.  Keep games like this coming.
B007PJLUG2|5.0|I loved this movie. thought love Mathew Perry. Thought they did a great job. So realistic in this movie. Great job.
1781162646|5.0|How come I don't read more often?<br />I felt like I knew the people. Wished the book never ended.<br />A great read.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|I've taken this bag on a couple of jaunts, one to some rough country in Vermont, and I must say it is a bargain for the price. I do agree that a major flaw is the lack of straps to secure the equipment in the padded cubbies, but I solved that problem by purchasing some velcro strap material at a drugstore and securing them myself. All in all, a surprisingly sturdy and useful item for the price, especially when comparable brand name bags sell for so much more. I also like the fact that it is not emblazoned with logos that scream &#34;Expensive Camera! Come steal it!&#34;
B009KS4XRO|3.0|This game would be a lot of fun if it didn't cheat you out of so much, but I guess due to the fact that it's free you have to take it in stride. All in all if your a bingo player and can handle simply enjoying whatever happens then this is the game for you. I do wonder if I would've paid for it would it be better? Oh there are way too many glitches in this game.
B009NY43NY|1.0|I like to pretend that the Sookie Stackhouse series ended at book 10. In book 10, the evil is defeated, and Sookie and Eric share a tender moment at the end where they realize where their relationship stands, it is not perfect, but they love each other. The series could have ended there. If it had ended there, so many things where left untied, Sookie's HOA could have been left up to the reader's imagination, but the following three books are pure garbage. I want to preface this review by saying I'm not disappointed because Harris didn't write Sookie's HOA with Eric, but because I kind of feel like she gave up. Until book 11, Sookie was one of my favorite heroines, and this was one of my favorite series. Took a dwindle down come book 11, and the final book was just the icing on the cake to years of investment into this series. ***Sighs***<br /><br />The last few books were just executed so poorly it just made the ending so unexciting and bland, that it made me wish I stopped reading the series after book 10.  Books 11-13 wasted so much time on super mundane tasks and conversation and interaction between certain characters was seriously lacking, that I just wanted to bang my head against the wall. Why was Eric hardly in book 12? In the final book Eric publicly humiliates and divorces Sookie. She just walks away? She doesn't fight for him? He doesn't fight for her? He just lets her go? After all they have been through? The fighting? The loving? The sexiness? Ok see you, have a nice life?<br /><br />I think Harris' big final plot line was great. It was perfect actually. The whole Eric's marriage to another and the cluvial dor was the final huge plot twist that had readers agonizing on the end of the series and biting their nails. She could have gone so far, and done so much with all of this.<br /><br />The ending was unbelievable. Yikes. As much as I wanted Sookie and Eric to end up together, I never thought they would. The final plot line of the marriage contract madeit more clear to me.  Sookie said she never wanted to be a vampire, and Eric would never give up power. They loved the idea of each other more than anything. There was no HOA for them, they were just what they needed at the time, in order for their characters to grow and change. I always thought Sookie would end up with Sam or Alcide (still supes, but at least closer to mortal). As supernatural as Sookie ws, she was still more realistic and down to earth than the other characters.<br /><br /> I think the sloppiness Harris' last three books is a slap in the face and just shows us how a huge paycheck still means more than the integrity of her characters or the loyalty of her readers. She probably made a bizillion dollars off of True Blood and the series, so it probably didn't matter to her, so in that case, the series should have been wrapped up sooner.
B00CATSONE|5.0|Not much of a businessman but what an incredible mind. Very interesting how many of the scions of business in the late 1800's and early 1900's are intertwined.
B00821OX98|4.0|*  Caveat:  I've had a few glasses of wine.  Just a warning.  I won't be at my beat.  Thanks again!  \\" End of caveat<br /><br />I'm almost through with season 1, but I can confirm we have a winner.  Noah Wylie's acting is fabulous!  His character is a history prof and although I majored bachelor's in history, a second in physical archaeology and a third in geology.<br /><br />Ah, I stray from my point.  I was born in New Orleans and lived the majority of my life there.  When an actress/actor attempts a southern accent, I normally cringe.<br /><br />This post is becoming long and I shall continue.  In the interim,  if interested, check out the first few seasons on Amazon.  Love. It.

B00847KFDS|5.0|Vintage Forgerty with a nice blend of legendary singers on each song that gives these classic songs a new but yet familiar sound. An additional benefit is Fogerty discusses on the inside cover the ideas that influenced him to write each of these great hits
B000JMKTLO|4.0|I loved this author's other book &#34;Gone Girl&#34; so I was excited to read this book. It was the most disturbing, creepy and sickening book I have ever read - the darn thing gave me nightmare for days. That being said, it was enthralling, suspenseful and very well written and kept me on the edge of my seat from start to finish.
B00BWJARHO|4.0|This movie is ten times better than the book!!!! I'm kidding but it still is a pretty good movie. I'm sure I'll pay money in the theatre to watch the sequel.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|You get what you pay for, however, in this case not even the 35.00 was worth it..Cast is a horrible little dongle that will show a picture on you TV, but thats about it..It's choppy, freezes and it has a delay..It's going back to the store..
B004J4WKTW|5.0|It is a fairy tale with a 'magical' ending that I had to read twice (the ending).  It was confusing with all the characters in the beginning but as the veil was lifted it only became more intriguing.  Good vs. evil, selfishness vs. love, devotion vs. greed.  Nicely done.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Best bingo and slots ever. Only one complaint. Internet freezes alot and you tend to loss your Hinton credits but other thamln that best game ever
B00371XIJE|5.0|One of the best movies I have seen recently.<br />Never even heard of it, but I was browsing around the Amazon video library and stumbled into this.<br />A great movie that touched all of my senses.<br />Think we will be getting a dog after seeing this!
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I'm a advent Bingo player I truly love the game.  Bingo blitz is a good app but the bugs need to be worked out.  Its very stressful to be booted from the game especially when playing in the tournament where ur trying to get ur best score.  Bingo blitz not perfact but I do enjoy playing. The game.
B001AR0D4A|4.0|I enjoyed this film because Thomas Jane is awesome! Sure, the characters are a bit too stereotypical but it is what it is.  The Carmody character was a bit over the top but she needed to be, its a horror movie so characters need to be larger than life.  The effects work is hit and miss sometimes but for the most part it works where it needed to and I think the creature designs were interesting. I particularly liked the designs of the larger creatures as they tended to be most obscured and Lovecraftian and hard to define.   So people rag on about the conclusion of the film but the original author Stephen King loved it and that's all that matters! I loved the ending, it was different and what I imagine anyone would do in that situation.  Cheers! :o
B00992CF6W|5.0|One of the only games around that teaches building skills without resorting to senseless violence and gore. The block system allows quick building and staves off boredom for hours and hours. With available wi-fi groups of people can all build in the same world cooperatively. Excellent!
B001D8W7CW|4.0|Its great to see the actors when they were young and starting out.<br />I really don't have much to say, its already been said anyway.<br />The ending was apparently a complete fabrication of the Director Brian De Palma, an often imitated segment which was genius.<br /><br />So,<br />Enjoy or not!<br />If not, Carrie will come to your house! :D
B000LTAY1U|5.0|Great looking watch for a great price. I liked it so much that I purchased the black one (809) also.
B000OPPBEQ|3.0|I enjoyed the first film but it always bugged me how much the character of Neo was overblown in the grand scheme of things.<br />If all three films were planned out as a proper trilogy, I would have preferred a gradual escalation of Neo's abilities within the Matrix.<br />The ending where he flies towards the screen from the city really overplays his abilities.<br /><br />The subsequent sequels were very messy and only served to play out the elaborate set pieces. As a result, nothing following the first film felt really connected to it. Had they planned it our proper, movie 2 and 3 would have further developed Neo's abilities within the Matrix some more. Serving his storyline better than it did,<br /><br />Still, the effects of the time were interesing. I wouldn't call them revolutionary though.<br />It has been said and so I shall repeat it, the conclusion of the storyline was a complete let down, it really was.<br />Trinity's minutes-long death speech didn't help either. Neo should have snapped her neck and put her out of her miserable rambling.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B00BOXZAJ8|3.0|Full disclosure: I absolutely wanted this to be a cool film.  Reality: it fell very short.  I saw the preview and was expecting to see this one in theaters.  I didn't, so I was surprised to see it was available on DVD so quickly.  Anyway, there's almost no real story, here, and the premise is totally wasted.  There's a bit of chemistry between the leads, but not enough to matter.  If it ends up being free on Prime, go ahead and watch.  If you have to spend hard-earned dollars... think twice...
0525457585|5.0|Even better the second time around...and way better than the movie (which is excellent).  Many more details in the book, and many more adventures that continue past where the movie leaves off.  One of my all time favorites, as a child and even now as an adult.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|I can't exactly put into words why I enjoy this film, but in the end, I watch it every time it's on (premium movie channels).  Yeah, the leads are &#34;old&#34;, but they're all great actors, and the story is just a lot of fun.  I haven't seen the sequel, and I hear it's a letdown, but this SE is WELL WORTH THE $6 if you have any sort of DVD library...
B005K0HDGE|5.0|For DARS...the perfect big-ass book for a summer read. Mr. King has outdone himself. Again. See you tonight, DARlings xxxx
B00DP3IESY|4.0|Good, but expected more.<br />My friends said they really enjoyed it, so I guess their opinions left me somewhat disappointed.<br />I liked it, just expected to love it.
B00571F26Y|5.0|I know I am consuming &#34;poison&#34; if I continue to eat the GMO wheat. I have stopped eating it and am loosing weight.
B00E6Z0THE|4.0|This was a fun game but only lasted one night, wish it were longer.  The puzzles were not too difficult and not too easy.
B000026FOA|5.0|This is a great CD with a lovely sound from a bygone age. He does a superb job of kind of highlighting a given instrument in different songs. One is (obviously) the cello. Ina another song, it's an oboe. etc.
B00ECU2SGS|5.0|As advertised, truly a Mark Twain kind of story. Not a chic flick or an action movie or a European piece of art. It was a pleasure to watch something in a category of its own for a change.
B005IQZB14|4.0|From the start, it kept me interested enough to finish. I also had a few good cries.<br />A must read.
B00DHQ208Y|5.0|I only like to review music that I like. Appreciation of music is so subjective that people should experience each offering for themselves. That being said, I thoroughly enjoyed this album. It conjures up images of music from the past while being totally in the now. What can I say, listen to it and enjoy yourself.
B001QB5S3G|5.0|Great acting, interesting and unique story, unbelievable videography/scenery, and the soundtrack is one to own.  I enjoy everything about this movie, and would highly recommend it.
B00181JGI2|1.0|I feel dumber now that I have watched this.  The only way you will laugh is if you are as high as the \\"The Dude\\".  This movie sux.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|This is a good book to read to find how true meaning of life. I would recommend this book to anyone.
B0014D6PCO|5.0|Awesome movie! It has everything: great actors, story, cinematography... And the fantastic score by Hans Zimmer is the linchpin that ties it all together. The perfect movie, which then ties into the Dark Knight and Dark Knight Rises, which are both equally great! I have seen all three many times and they just never get old. Can't recommend these movies enough.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|One of the few movies based on a book(s) that are very close to the authors words. Five was the only one that really strayed for the book, but overall great.
B0063IH60K|3.0|The game isn't bad but after EVERY deal is an ad. It's too distracting. I took it off of my Kindle. Will look for something else.
B008BDZP3K|5.0|This CD brings back memories of my youth. I think this is the best of Zappa's work from the era of The Mothers of invention, Captain Beefheart and Dr John. My buddies and I used to listen to this music on vinyl back in the 60's.
0807014273|5.0|I was recommended this book by a surgeon at my hospital since I'm working on my Mater's in Psychology he felt it was a must read for me. I loved it and reading this book would change the minds and though process of so many people who do not understand prison life and what it was like to be a Nazi prisoner. Must read! Also ships in a timely matter. Thank you!
B000XUBC5E|5.0|This book was a great read-suspenseful and chock full of plot twists and turns. I'm going back and reading some of the beginning again but I loved it. Highly recommend reading it.
1582701709|5.0|Love the book and it was a good price. The world needs more positive thinking!!  I wish everyone would read this..
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|I like the cover, I feel very good and satisfied for the choice I made to buy this collection.<br /><br />I always liked the plot, the story, the effects, but mostly the fact that this idea could be in the distant future become a reality, since nowadays, computers have become an essential part of human existence, that 20 years ago We had not imagined to have.
B009I2UH2W|1.0|I ordered 4 of these (2 separate orders), thinking maybe the first 2 were defective.  They are not compatible with the Iphone 5.  They either did not work or the end piece broke off and stayed in the phone charging port upon disconnection.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Excellent game for little girls who love ponies<br />Lots to hold there interest from feeding grooming and mucking out to training and competing on your horse
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|From start to finish, the Matrix movie collection met my expectations! The anime was also mind blowing too as well.
B008Y7N7JW|2.0|If you're 12 years old, this will probably pass as riveting entertainment as you root for the young heroine.  If you're older and an experienced movie-watcher, it's more likely to be a slow couple of hours watching teenage actors try to learn their profession.  The adult roles other than Donald Sutherland's are cartoon caricatures - and Sutherland just earned a quick buck acting like the older Sutherland you come across so often now in his later years.  My recommendation:  rent something else in the futurist genre.
125000098X|4.0|I, too, like other reviewers thought a brief summary of the previous books would have been helpful....Took me a bit of time to get into it but once in I really did enjoy it. That being said I was under the impression that this would be the closure for Archer's continuing saga but unfortunately it was not. The end was so open ended....it just left me hanging. I actually did turn the page thinking there was more to read. I was def. disappointed with the story's ending as well as some unfinished story lines.
B00BGIBVP8|5.0|A co-worker suggested it and I'm glad he did.  I nearly died laughing during the scene in the hotel room.
B008M87GJK|5.0|So wonderful to actually be able to view and the coverage of the world is simply incredible. So glad there is a Kindle app for this!
B008NB0SQO|5.0|This movie is so well known it is hard to possibly say anymore, a must have for everyone's Christmas collection, even better on Blu Ray
B00BMCAM6M|5.0|Love the genres and the ability to customize the listening experience! So glad there is a Kindle app for this!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I am personally not a fan of fiction stories, however, this book was better than most. The story is a bit far fetched at times but still worth the read, and it is very easy to read at that
B00CLD65X0|5.0|I was hooked on Downton Abbey from the first season and am looking forward for more seasons to be on Kindle.
B00466HN72|4.0|Great picture on the Blu Ray, and a very good Easter movie. My child loves the movie, especially around the Easter holiday.
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|instructions need revamping. Tried several times and it just got annoying. I like something that is easy to pic up. I was able to play the game but it was very mundane.
B004SDEP38|5.0|If you are used to the M$ office suite, then you will be very happy to use this program on your portable device.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|This was recommended by a co-worker who could not stop talking about this book for months and I can certainly understand why. By reading The very first chapter I was obsessed. The characters, the tents, magic, and pure imagination of the author and the dream aspect is completely different from any book I have ever read. A must read!
B004SDSSFY|5.0|I dont' remember everything that it unlocked but I remember the one important part was being able to open up very large documents that I NEEDED to be able to view on my phone.  Yeah,. sounds nuts, but sometimes<br />phone-engineering&#34; is how it gets done...
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Quick read, great imagery and action, and a unique storyline. My first step into this genre of fiction and I was very impressed.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|The language was a bit crude for my taste but it was cool to see my kids like it the way I used to!
B00DH4BL8Q|5.0|I love the Percy Jackson series and highly recommend them.Don't like these books?I think that you had better come with me and we can go and get your brain checked!<br /><br />Percy finds out that he is the son of Posiedon and then all Hades lets loose!<br /><br />And what's life without a little romance?Percy's relationship with Annabeth justs adds that little touch to these books.<br /><br />In the final book there is an allout battle between the halfbloods and the titans.But is it all is well that ends well?<br />Read these awesome books to find out!
B00371QQ2U|5.0|I am reviewing the movie, not the various editions out there. Sometimes I wish studios would just release one version, the best they can do, and leave it at that. Of course multiple versions mean more money. Anyway...<br />As a huge fan of the space program, and someone who lived through it as an enthusiast, I applaud this film. Ron Howard was the best director that could have been chosen to do this movie, because he played it (mostly) straight.<br />Tom Hanks does not look like Jim Lovell, in fact Lovell always thought that Kevin Costner would be a better fit (and I think he would have done a great job also). But Hanks is a huge fan of the space program also. The casting is great, I do not sense a false note here anywhere. The film as a period piece is flawless.<br />The only issue I have with the movie, and it is, for most viewers, a nonexistent one, is that a few changes were made for dramatic effect. I won't go into them all because it would be boring, and most are totally harmless, but the one which Hanks and Lovell both opposed was introducing a bit of conflict between the crew members. None of that actually happened. Howard says he put it in for dramatic effect. Maybe he could have spun it a little differently, but it is not a serious issue.<br />By the way, the wedding ring in the shower actually did happen, according to Marilyn Lovell.<br />Somebody said on the anniversary of Neil Armstrong's death, that it is nice to remember when America did great things. For those of you who were not alive when the Apollo program happened, or too young to remember, this film is a great way to get an essence of what it was like live in those times. Remember Viet Nam was going on at the same time, and the country was divided, but the whole world pulled together to experience the spectacular. Hope it can happen again. Mars, anyone?
193700788X|4.0|It was nice to see all the characters coming around full circle but it did seem a bit rushed. I am still sad that the Sookie novels are over....
B00DIFARQ6|1.0|The biggest disappointment for this game/app is I thought I was going to be able to play this game.  In-app purchasing games still allow players to continue playing even without making in-app purchases to enhance their game play.  With this game, after the first 2 emergency landings (5 minutes of game play) in the United states, you earn your way to perform emergency landings in Australia.  Nice, we're moving on right?  Wrong.  Now you're done.  No more emergency landings.  They want you to rate the game just prior to telling you that in order to continue in the game you have to BUY with real money packages.  Good grief, how many packages will I have to buy if now they want money for Australian missions?  Will they want me to buy separate mission packs for Europe, Asia, South America, Pacific Islands, Santa's North Pole, and so on?<br /><br />The demo was not even long enough for me to determine if I liked or hated this app.  The very fact that this demo was incredibly short earns it a 1 star.  Was not worth the download time to realize I still know little of this app, other than the developer's lied by stating in the app's description that this is a game with in-app purchases.  It should say demo or lite version and not lure people into thinking they are going to get high reviews before they burn you by ending your game and wanting money.<br /><br />Reludo, do not insult our intelligence, please.
B002RKSZS0|4.0|Jane Austen is brilliant, witty and has such a wonderful command of the English language. Altogether a fun and clever read. As with all ms. Austens, novels just sit back and enjoy.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|Interesting background history on the group and its various members over the years.  Well done with excellent clips from their storied past.  Helped me to relive much of my past!
B005CKPQ7A|4.0|I loved Season One, was disappointed in the second and third and was was happily surprised when Season Four picked up again.  There's plenty of action, some new locales---the Drug dealer's nice spread in Mexico and a nursing home and a car wash in Albuquerque.  Jesse goes through some major changes and grows from a punk kid to a responsible adult....well as responsible as a meth maker could be said to be.  He finds a new love which helps him and shaves his head which gives him a new mean, lean look...matching that of the new Walt.  Walt is still Walt, flayling around, but he, too, is helped out in this series by the knowledge of Sklyer so we don't have the constant drain of his energy by having to lie to her.  Now he just lies to Hank and Marie but they seem so inconsequential that we don't much care. I have to say that in the final scene he looks....magnificent!  It does concern me that Walt, who is a sweet loving father never seems to think about what meth actually does to young people.  He stays in his clean lab and it's Jesse who rubs shoulders with the meth heads who are not an attractive bunch.<br /><br />I think what adds too to the entertainment value of this season are the supporting characters who are by now more well-developed.  First off is the amazing Gustavo Fring. Who could have conceived of a such a character...a  brilliant, hyper-polite, Black Chilean chicken cook/drug dealer?!  His treatment of his trusted aid with the box cutter was chilling, to say the least.  And his amazing courtesy, his super straight posture, his skill in the kitchen....what a guy!  The actor's face is quite beautiful, I think, reminding me of the mask of an Egyptian pharoah and time after time we see his expression change just imperceptibly to give a hint of what's really going on inside.  He did a brilliant job.  I liked the way the writers didn't reveal  Gus's back story until this episode.  I kept wondering what would have made such a nice-looking man so dangerous.  Thisepisode gave us the answer and also hinted at his friendship with Gale, the young chemist.  I loved his name, too...so perfectly odd.  I checked in the Albuquerque phone book and found no Fring.<br /><br />We meet the too-good-looking Ted Beneke again and he shows more of his slimey personality.  Too bad about that rug, Ted!<br /><br />Saul Goodman is hilarious and brings comic relief to each scene he appears in as well as some practical advice to our boys.  Saul's a snappy dresser, too...you gotta love him.<br /><br />The 12-step group gave another interesting change of pace.  I loved the scene in which Jesse broke into a rage at the leader who kept advising him to \\"accept\\" himself and his actions.  Yea Jesse...he remains the voice of authenticty in the show, even as he does have his own ups and downs.<br /><br />Mike is intriguing, too.  The sweet grandpop who bought balloons to his grandchild and who seems to have a warm spot in his heart for Jesse, is also capable of a lot of killing.  Did they leave him behind in Mexico?  I hope he comes back.<br /><br />All is all I think there was enough interesting human drama going on to offset the sheer violence.  That's what made this season better than the last two.  I hope it keeps up.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Oh my gosh love it . It's my most favorite kindle games. It's so fun. I love the Dragon track. This is a awesome game. I rate it five stars. Please get this app.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Jetpack joyride has ok graphics but great sound quality. It is very entertaining and I find myself enjoying many times playing this game. Could use a little bit of work on the graphics but over all its a great game . I suggest if you want something that's easy and fun, get this game!<br /><br />Nerdy Reviews
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|Plot was good and Tom Cruise delivered a flawless performance.  For those who don't like Science Fiction (like my wife), skip.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|The best bingo game in the app store, but a word of warning, this game is highly addictive! Earn coins,credits,power ups. Play slots and complete collections, trade with friends for big rewards ~
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a great calculator and would recommend this to everyone.  It's very user friendly and easy to use. I wouldn't' know what to do without it.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Please make a sequel!  I can't find another game like this where you have to put clues together.  I LIKED going back and forth between so many scenes... it made it challenging having to remember where things are and how to use them.  I love that the game isn't constantly telling me what to do or where to go next.  I like putting clues together in order to move on with the investigation.  Beautiful graphics, great voice talent, perfect music.  Please make this a series and keep them coming!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Bingo Blitz is the only bingo game I make an effort to play every day.  I would highly recommend this game.  I have tried several different games but this is the best.
B00DHSK3RM|2.0|I didn;t find this app very useful.  I can read the help files in Candy Crush, I was looking for a little more insight.  The levels help are very limited.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Very cool and original app. The new look for clocks is comforting.  Thanx<br />This will go nice with the docking clock
B000YJ54DU|2.0|I have read many of the Reacher books, but was really disappointed in the derogatory comments on the book of Revelation from Reacher and the Anglican minister. No more!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Can't wait for season 4. When it will be available to watch in Prime? Love love love this series. It's so addictive!!!
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|I like this game try it out I just stumbled over it and got hooked. And you will be too also.
B0050CQY1W|4.0|I enjoy this CD the songs are great i rate four stars.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|this is a really good game but if you guys could make it where I can get something else than revival runs in my sound that would be great.but overall all the game is pretty good
B0094M0DJS|4.0|The premise is admittedly a little thin as well as the &#34;science&#34;, but it is an enjoyable ride.  Buy This movie for the days when you just need a little something to get your mind off of life.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I am old fashioned person when reading a book.  I like to have the book in hand.  But with this kindle for android it lets you have your tablet or computer and download at a very, very low price great new releases and have them in the cloud or even storage them in your computer, without having to buy a kindle for it.
B004JK61K0|5.0|After one week trial I have found K-9 Mail app to be an excellent full featured replacement for the standard default Kindle Fire HD mail app.  Especially useful is the mass delete option.
B000JX0CDS|5.0|Great book, intriguing and exciting it is a must in every respectfull library.  Get's your attention from beginning to end
0240815807|5.0|Like many of us, I have read many books on recording and mixing and am constantly looking around for more insight and wisdom wherever I could find it.  I agree with many others here that this book hits all the right points.  There are many things I like about this book but here are the main things that stand out to me:<br /><br />- The book does a great job in helping you prioritize different aspects of mixing.  After reading the book, I came away more confident in knowing where I should spend the majority of my time (and even money) on mixing (and setups).<br />-  There is no wasted space.  Every page is filled with important information, but it is also written in a way where it is hard to miss important information.  Each chapter devotes time to a particular topic, and at the end, it cuts to the chase to summarize.  It also recommends  &#34;assignments&#34; to you which will help you absorb and understand the material.<br />-  Oftentimes, a book is filled with great info, but it is presented in a way that is dull and boring.  Not the case here!<br /><br />I recommend this book highly.  You will not find another book that has all the information you need presented in a package like this.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|just wish I didn't have to pay 1.99 for every step of downton abbey. I was hoping to get it free on Netflix
0142410705|4.0|I am a fan of John Green from his popular \\"vlogbrothers\\" youtube channel, and just recently decided to peruse his selection of books, which I'd heard were good. Not only is \\"An Abundance of Katherines\\" good, it's amazing! The story, the quirky, the lovable characters, and the wonderful way Green has woven this tale makes for a wonderful read. My only critique is the language. The words used were foul enough that I would not recommend this to my younger, teenaged sister, which is unfortunate because I believe she would have liked it otherwise. Regardless, I highly recommend this book!
B00CXVX1OQ|5.0|This game is easy to learn, entertaining for kids and adults, and the graphics are good.  Yes, it's simplistic, but sometimes you want a game that doesn't require much brain power. My kids and I are definitely enjoying it.
1439127727|4.0|I bought this book at the airport because it was on the recent NYTimes best seller list. I've been thinking lately about the fact that the President only serves four years yet the powerful within the agencies continue to build and wield power over the longer term. How does a President really understand and control this big opaque machine? How much control does a President really have? Is any one person really in charge? These issues come out in bas-relief as you read the book. Presidents work to maintain the image that they have control in order to maintain people's trust and increase their actual influence. The book also points out that much of the partisan behavior is cyclically aligned with the campaign season. Presidents rely on each other greatly to get the job done and to understand if they are \\"doing the job right\\". There is no YouTube video instructing a President on what their responsibilities are and how to lead. Recommended!
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|I got the game a while back then it wouldn't let me download it. and I deleted and now it wont let me get the app again. its bad

B00168HARG|4.0|Having recently bought the Terminator series on bluray and was interested in seeing this series despite the negative reviews. Its actually very entertaining, the special effects are movie quality and the acting is right up there with the movies.
B005USZYDU|4.0|It is good but not quite as great as many others he has written.  But, I like everything John Grisham writes.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Going into this I was sceptical about this. After playing this game I found that I should have paid attention in my high school geography class. The player must know the climate, population, and the financial data on a country you want to infect. Does the country have poor health care, whats the population density, what is the climate like? All you need to know if you want to infect each country.
B009WUAK2M|3.0|Not a bad flick....lots of action and blood...probably not a date night movie...unless you have the right girl....that is all
B00992CF6W|5.0|Having played this on the Xbox I knew what I was getting into. This is like virtual legos for adults.

B00CO9DY76|5.0|I bought this Leatherman Sidekick because I wanted a nice carabiner for my keys and also a rigid bottle opener that isn't plastic and won't break easily. I really like this product and it does great opening bottles but my one and only issue with this product is that it isn't much of a multi tool. It is a bottle opener that's basically it, would be nice if there was a little knife or something like that on the carabiner.
B00CF34B2I|1.0|you should not play this game just play wizard101 its easier to play and its better than magic just download wizard101 its only on a computer or laptop please go try it out I am fire Lvov seventh ty for and my name is josh firebreeze so go check it out cyanide everyone who read this bye
B0067Q42BY|3.0|The game is good but there are just toooooo many ads, but all and all its a really good game.
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|Very interesting with a totally unpredictable ending. Thought provoking. Keeps you guessing until the end. Watch if you like plot twists.
B000FBFN0Q|5.0|This book is super funny. Obviously you should watch the movie too, but the book is so relatable I kept laughing out loud on the T.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I chose a five star rating because this is the best book I have read in some time. I loved the weaving of the &#34;fantastic&#34; with the &#34;real.&#34; I would recommend this book to anyone who realizes that the world is much more than the mundane in front of your eyes.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I enjoy having solitaire at my fingertips when I am forced to wait at the doctor office, car dealership or anytime really.  I like playing this game on my I Pad as well.
1416563156|5.0|I was overwhelmed at the detail of this journal and actually learned some interesting facts from it.  It was absolutely perfect!
B00BCZU8WM|3.0|Ok. Maybe we're just in a rut with our longing for good music or something. This CD is far, far, from bad. But it's not great either.<br />It has good productions, beats, catchiness etc. But in terms of any sort of serious vocal/lyric prowess. This CD is not it.<br /><br />Strawberry BubbleguM? Really?
B004ADH1RI|4.0|Typical old time classic movie from the 80's featuring some of our old actors. I think this is worth watching with today's kids!
B005F2BBLK|3.0|If you're renting this movie for your kids, you're probably better off getting some other animated flick.  I thought the story was a bit drawn out and too serious for any young child to actually enjoy it.  It had elements of other animated movies like action, humor, a villain, and a moral message but not enough to really hold a kid's interest very long.  It's sort of a Western made for kids but not necessarily &#34;appropriatized&#34; for children.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Great read! Filled with information about the formation of a religion and how a man was re-framed..I'd recommend this to anyone interested in learning more about Christianity.
B005WBBYXO|5.0|I would not want my kids to read these books.  I LOVE them, but they're not for kids.  It's not even about Pullman's inherent atheism--that I can respect and understand.  It's just that the general hopelessness of the world-view in these books is depressing.  Whereas Harry Potter was written about children but enjoyed by all ages, this one is marketed to children but really so hopeless that I feel it's better handled by adults.  There was a reason the movie failed, after all.  It wasn't the acting or the effects or the promotion. ALL of that was spot-on.  It's just so much *bright and shiny* then SAD.  Maybe every life and every story don't have to have happy endings, but these particular dark materials most certainly will trouble the kids.  Just my opinion as a mom.  As a reader and a philosophical type, I recommend these books for all my SMART friends.  Anyone uninterested in the meaning of life is probably not going to like them.  Try Neil Gaiman, instead.  Much lighter.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|High quality acting and filming.  We have enjoyed all three seasons and the development of all characters and storyline.  Recommend this to others.
B000002J09|5.0|Maybe.  Sure is great music to work to!  I haven't set and listened to this album from beginning to end in about 20 years, but it's time.  This is a true classic that stands the test of time.  Long live the Hermit.

1451626657|5.0|This was purchased for an English Literature course assignment.  it's a classic.  Excellent addition to anyone's library.  A good read.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Great plot. Mr.DeMille offers rich detail but the overabundantce of detail (at times) slow down the fast-paced action and dulls the suspense..Still, the book doesn't disappoint.
B00170DEM8|5.0|How can one not enjoy this movie?  Loaded with talent - snappy music, graceful dancing - makes me want to live in the country and have a snowy, white Christmas.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Great book that told of the bond between a dog and his owner from the dog's point of view. Enzo, the dog, was amazingly philosophical yet endearing.
B008XG1X18|3.0|Even though my girlfriend downloaded it. Only reason i give it 3 stars is because she likes it. Its women sharing ideas. I try to look at that man side of it and it gave me a head ache. For men trying to get into pintrest be patient. Its not for many
B003F3NDWG|5.0|I absolutely love the show and am so glad that I purchased the first season. The discs were in perfect condition and I can't wait to get the next season!
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|It's amazing to watch these ultra-talented musicians work together.  Dave Grohl has such a great feel for the history of the music he is creating.  This purchase is a must for anyone raised on rock music!
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|I absolutely love the show and am so glad that I purchased the first season. The discs were in perfect condition and I can't wait to get the next season!
B000VDDDVO|5.0|This movie is one of the best. This collector set is a great middle of the road purchase. It exceeds casual watcher's expectations without being too expensive.
B00BHHIWQO|1.0|This game freezes so much! Not bad when you can actually open. Fun to play but extremely aggravating when it freezes!
B00AJRQLTI|4.0|The missing one star is because you need to get the full length version. This edition has 75% of the great songs you love from the movie, go ahead and pay a few extra bucks for the whole set.
B000IZ6URY|1.0|I was never able to download my purchase. I do LOVE the movie however very disappointed with my \\"Prime\\" membership...seems like I wasted $80.
B003ZA0C5U|4.0|Keep you guessing how each of the main characters are going to die, only to find out that you got it wrong again.
B00ADIT8U2|3.0|Not bad but not what I would call great.  Finished it once, so far have not felt compelled to play it again.  The story about Tesla is stretched a bit but interesting, and some places are hard to find again, since you will have to go back to some to finish the game or use something you found elsewhere.
B002CGSYNU|5.0|It's really easy to drop and lose this item, which explains so many quantities sold. Fortunately, it's cheap to replace.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|Dave Grohl at his best. Inspiring story...great documentary. I purchased related CD and it is awesome. This would be a great gift to someone who loves music and cares about music integrity.....
B0093H8HXS|5.0|I'm running Windows 7 Pro machine with this CPU, Geforce GTX 560, 4 GB of ram, and SSD. While some may consider this barebones, it zips through casual gaming (Rogue Legacy, Dirt 3) just fine without overheating. Great bang for buck.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Believe the hype; read this book.  Patrick Rothfuss is a masterful storyteller.  A wonderful book to get lost in, as is the sequel, Wise Man's Fear.
B00CL68NOG|2.0|I did not find anything hilarious about this movie.  I am still wondering why I sat through the whole movie.  I guess I thought it would eventually get better.
B003SNKBXW|5.0|I pursued this book because of the Polanski movie, which I felt had some connection to another film, A Pure Formality. This work is significantly different from the movie, and more layered, beautiful at times with its prose and delightful in its characterizations. Corso's tangled nostalgia and loneliness  are depicted with the tender bitterness of familiarity, as are the gentle humor of his friends. A worthy read.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|GREAT SERIES!  I can't wait to see how the second and third books are acted out on the big screen
0765326353|5.0|the book came on time and mostly in the advertised condition. A tiny bit of wrinkling at the top of the dust jacket when it was advertised in like new condition, but virtually like new. probably happened in shipping and not bad enough for me to return it

B009KS4XRO|5.0|Favorite game. But freezes up a lot on all 3of our kindle fires. We lose a lot of our winning credits we are old I'm very ill with stage 4 kidney disease so we haven't learner facebook etc. So we don't get complaints answeres most of time. Tried to buy coin special 3times showed I purchased but got nothing called kindkle. Said they would have charges taken off keeps telling us to update but nothing happens.
B007FG9LIE|3.0|If you grew up watching &#34;The Twilight Zone&#34;, you'll find nothing original here.  It's overrun with classic and contemporary cliches.<br /><br />No horror here.  Just a mystery at best.  One or two clever twists.  Otherwise, it was like reading a popular television series.
B00005RRG9|5.0|The best part of this film is Hayley Mills' double performance.  The rest of the cast is likewise packed with great actors: the incomparable Maureen O'Hara as the twin's mother, Brian Keith as their hapless father bent on marrying a gold-digger (Joanna Barnes), Charlie Ruggles as the easy going grandfather, Cathleen Nesbitt as the controlling/overbearing grandmother, Una Merkel as the housekeeper who never offers her opinion, and Leo G. Carroll as an easily amused reverend.  This movie is filled with memorable scenes (my favorite being the exile to an isolated cabin with the entire company of girls following the twins and whistling the march from The Bridge on the River Kwai).  A fun film, as long as you can get past the notion that two parents would be selfish enough to separate sisters as though they were property or a couple of wedding gifts to be divided after the divorce.  All that time lost, that can never be made up, would make for a wonderful grudge and/or years of therapy.
1419701533|5.0|I chose this because my son wanted it for his birthday.  after he got them, he cant put them down. he read all 5 with in 5 days...  and since then, he has read them all again more than 10 times before bed.  I have bought the other 3 books. to continue with his collection.<br /><br />If your son or daughter likes to read, and fits this age, they will LOVE these...
B0034DGPEU|4.0|I loved the story right up to the very end. I really enjoyed how the story alternated between lavinia and belle.  There were twists and turns, multiple plots going on at the same time, different levels of intrigue, I couldn't put it down right up to the end. At that point I was disappointed at how quickly the end came about.  Did Rankin really ride off into the sunset unscathed?  Couldn't we have seen more of a storyline develop with lavinia and her  brother, Cardigan?  And in the end everything fell into place so quickly.
0440245931|1.0|This book is boring and confusing. The only parts I enjoyed were the parts I remember vividly from the movie. The movie cuts this overblown dull read into a pretty fast-paced story, and also casts Denzel Washington as Grantham, a great choice in my opinion. In the book Grantham is an older white guy who fancies Darby. In the movie, Grantham is a straight arrow, decent guy played by the ever awesome Denzel. Reading the book I just couldn't picture Grantham as white. I think it's awful that in the end of the book the Grantham character winds up in a relationship with Darby. It makes sense in the context of the book but I am glad they dropped it for the movie.<br /><br />Grisham knows his stuff when it comes to lawyers and law and law school and law companies - and he should - he's a lawyer; and he knows how to write about politics and intrigue, but his style is uninspired, prosaic and confusing. Beyond the obvious key players such as Darby, Grantham, Coal, Voyles etc. - main characters I recall vividly from the movie, I was totally confused with who was who and what their purposes were. There's just too many characters in this story. And the assassins are incapable of finding and killing a 20-year-old girl but they can get everyone else? That was silly. Most of the book was about bumbling killers and then trying to find \\"Garcia\\" using a tedious process of elimination of law students that interned at the evil law company. It really dragged. The biggest annoyance - and this is another problem with Grisham's style - was they way he started many chapters and introduced a lot of characters with \\"He\\" or \\"She.\\" We meet someone for the first time and Grisham's like \\"She was sitting at her desk and watching the...\\" or \\"He sat on a park bench and watched the...\\" or whatever. And I kept wondering, well who the heck is \\"he\\" or \\"She\\"? It was annoying. I only read this book because I love the movie so much but it's the first and last Grisham novel I'll ever waste my time on. I'll stick to the movie adaptations.tick to the movie adaptations.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|As a layperson with a longstanding interest in the historical Jesus, I was somewhat skeptical of a popular press account of the subject matter. This is a meticulously researched, clearly and evenhandedly written account of what can only be surmised as the life of an anonymous peasant in the middle east two thousand years ago. The author deals with what can legitimately be stated, is careful and honest in his surmises and actually provides both new information and a fresher view of more than the myth. And it rings true, even as the total truth, by the nature of the possible search, is still elusive. For anyone that has a passion for the foundations of Christianity, this is a writing that demands to be read.
0316228532|3.0|Hard to follow all the many characters and took me 200 pages into reading before I found this book worth continuing.  The British city govt. system is not easy to comprehend to American readers.  Adult situations.
1932100660|5.0|This book was so compelling, that I took it on my vacation recently and decided to just stay in the hotel and read the book several mornings, instead of sightseeing on my vacation.  It's the first 350 page book I think I have ever read, but it was enjoyable the whole book.  I really admire this man Dr. Colin Campbell!
B00DCRE7M0|5.0|I ordered this album expecting to like it, but not love it (this is how I felt about past Labrie releases). Well I'm happy to say I was wrong. Upon 3rd or 4th listen everything began to click and I can't stop listening to this disc. Whether I'm in my car, at home, or listening to my ipod somewhere, its playing. You'll have songs like Amnesia and Undertow stuck in your head for hours, as well as all of the songs for that matter. Not a lot of progressive elements but we all have Dream Theater for that, don't we? Worth the $9.99 here on Amazon. Get it!

0553214624|2.0|One thing I learned AFTER leaving school books and English classes behind was how to really read books with a deep, subjective understanding. Too often teachers tell you to love a book simply because it has been \\"a classic\\" for centuries. But that alone is no excuse. If you love or hate it, it should be for specific reasons. You should feel no obligation to love Vanity Fair. I hated it! And these are the reasons:<br /><br />1) I hate virtually all the characters (if not all)! Aside from Dobbin and Lady Jane, everyone else is taxing to the nerves, for varying reasons (and even Dobbin can be frustrating). Either they're tedious, selfish, stupid, gullible, deceitful, scheming, arrogant, or any combination of these and worse character traits. It is impossible for me to enjoy a book when I can't stand the characters.<br />2) Thackeray's descriptions of women. I do not contend with the author on the reality that women of his description do exist, but I disagree with some of his ideas about how people, in general, feel about such women. Obviously, plotting Becky Sharp is a pestilence to anyone who gets in her path. Unfortunately, she is also nearly the only women in the book who at least THINKS. Amelia, on the other hand, is a total nitwit, who has never been taught how to think, and Thackeray seems to like it that way, since he describes her as the type of mild, innocent personality that makes men \\"want to take of her.\\" Even innocence has its limits. To be a thinking woman does not of itself make a conspiracy, and to be a thoroughly gullible woman is highly frustrating to the surrounding populace. This is why Lady Jane is as close to a sensible person as you can get in this book. The author seems to endorse the very stereotypes of women that Austen spent her time battling.<br />3) Thackeray's writing style annoys me to death. He is the king of useless tangents. He'll start off on some explanation of something that has no direct bearing on the story. He even writes an entire chapter about a party house, near the end, in which none of the characters appear, and which has no direct significance to the story at all. He could have simply devoted a few lines to the idea that some people waste their time in a futile parade of social uselessness without plaguing the readers with a full, unrelated chapter. His writing is tedious, and I was screaming, \\"Get on with it!\\" Even my librarian sister (who loves reading) couldn't get through his endless blab.<br /><br />Yet, there are still reasons to read such a work, even if it does not appeal to you personally. It is not a terrible work, though there are many better. The story, though nauseating in its presentation sometimes, is not bad. And there is some use in gathering an understanding of how ideas about women have changed since the author's time. If there is any moral to be gotten from both sides of the story it is that people who lack sense and/or ethics damage and harass the innocent people around them (i.e. the innkeeper and his family who ended up in debt and anyone who had to listen to Amelia's misguided ramblings about her husband).  There is also use in comparing Thackeray's writing style to other authors. So, there is both thematic and structural analysis to glean, even if the story does not strike a chord with you. Bottom line: I would check it out from the library and give it a try before paying for it. If you really love it, then buy it and read it again. But feel free to decide for yourself.

B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|WOW!  This is the first game to get me so involved that I lost track of time.  I looked at the clock at 10:30 pm, and the next time I looked it was 2:00 am.  It takes a lot of discipline to not play this game.  You find a piece to the puzzle and think you've solved it, when instead another piece of the puzzle is revealed and the quest to find where that piece goes begins again.  This game makes me think hard without getting frustrated.  The only negative is that there were not enough puzzles to solve.  I want more.  The hints in the game are helpful without making the game too easy.

034580709X|3.0|As a huge fan of Stieg Larsson, what's a reader to do when the Millennium Trilogy ended?  My boss suggested I move on to Jo Nesbo and \\"Redbreast\\".  Just ahead of my beach vacation I stumbled into B&N looking for where to start and found \\"The Bat\\", the first in the Harry Hole series.  A bit confused, since I wasn't sure where the series began, I purchased it and headed to the beach, partially thinking there was a reason the publisher didn't translate this one first.  They started with \\"Redbreast\\", that one's probably the blockbuster, so I resigned myself to thinking I'll be reading at least two Jo Nesbo novels before deciding if he's my next Scandinavian crime story fix.  Of course now it look's like \\"Cockroaches\\" lies between me and \\"Redbreast\\" but I'll sort that out later.<br /><br />Since Nesbo wrote \\"The Bat\\" in the mid nineties we are reading it perhaps 20 years later.  As crime stories go he was entering the genre about the same time Larsson was sitting down in the evenings to tap out \\"Dragon\\".  Optimistically, his writing talents show through even though his sophistication as a crime novelist was just beginning...that is assuming his sophistication does in fact increase through the HH series--to be determined.  In \\"The Bat\\", there really is only a single character that he develops...Detective Harry Hole.  Whereas following the first of the Larsson's series we are left with several major characters with plenty of potential life remaining.  Regardless, Harry is just good enough, bad enough, and broken enough to have had the alcoholism driven out of him, just in time to for another series of misfortunes to drive his love of drink back to the surface.<br /><br />In a crowded beach house, with distractions a plenty, it's hard to find a quiet place to read--yet Nesbo was still able to get me to turn the page.  However for me his most compelling element was not Detective Hole, rather it was his adding cultural stories pertaining to the Aborigines of Australia where between the shores of Brisbane and Sydney, the entire story takes place. Granted that's not an entire continent, only about 600 miles of shoreline, he introduces us to an urban Australia that we miss in most of the stereotypical depictions of the outback.  His snippets of Aborigine culture are conveyed through the story of the \\"Bat\\", the \\"Snake\\", and a few other tales that have been handed down in some 40,000 years of folklore.  I have to assume he has conveyed these ancient stories accurately, despite struggling with a few other facts, a bit more modern.  In particular, during critical dialogue between the two pivotal characters, Harry and Andrew (the detective of Aboriginal descent he becomes friends with) we learn we wouldn't want to learn astronomy from either of them.  Still learning something, anything, in a novel provides added value to the intrigue and the entertainment.  Of particular value to me was the legal understanding of the term Terra Nullis which basically applies to the lack of legal ownership of the land that the Aboriginal people occupied, because they did not occupy the land full-time.  In essence they continuously migrated, thus, as we in the west like to say (and apparently down under as well), possession is nine-tenths of the law, the Aborigines never had possession of anything even though they existed on the continent for more than 40,000 years.  To me that kind of means they owned the continent.  This puts an entirely new philosophical twist, and perhaps legal argument for the Heisenberg uncertainty principal but also suggests the phenomenon of fence building is a more natural reaction to uncertainty vs property ownership.  Nesbo cleverly ties this concept to his crime motive although it's not entirely that compelling.<br /><br />In the end I'm giving Nesbo 3-Stars for \\"The Bat\\".  It was good enough to finish and good enough for me to want to crack the binding on \\"Redbreast\\" in the near future.  Stay tuned.etween the shores of Brisbane and Sydney, the entire story takes place.

0064471837|5.0|I read Sabriel as a teenager from the local library and checked out the book a dozen times before buying a copy.  That copy has traveled with me into adulthood, was one of three books that went with me to Japan, and traveled with me back to America and across states.  I love reading, but I have a difficult time finishing books now-a-days because of over-used plot lines and predictable twists.  This book is one of the few books I can re-read even as an adult all the way through multiple times.  The rich, unique world that Nix creates in Sabriel and continues in the rest of the Abhorsen trilogy never fails to enthrall me into understanding its complexities.  The characters that he portrays never fail to bore, and are three dimensional beings with spirit and humor.  The character of Sabriel herself became an iconic heroine for me in childhood.  I loved the entire series and cannot wait for Nix to explore this universe more in later books.

B007XIC1GI|3.0|This book starts off really great, then fell off from there. I was never one who was into Marilyn Manson, but i thought it might be a good book, but it kind of let me down. After a while, you get tired of reading about somebody who blames everybody else for the things that they do. On a positive note, some of the backstage stories were interesting, I just wished the whole book was a bit more positive. After all this guy has made a pretty good living, and continues to make money off his book. You would think that he would be just a little happy once in a while. Bottom line, if they offer it at a discount, i would say try it, but full price is a waste. Everyone has an opinion, and that is mine.

Rock and Roll is a business, and Dave shows this side very well, from band members to managers, and promoters, its all here. If you are a fan of metal, then you should read this book.

B003K15IF8|5.0|As an older woman, I recognized in this book how difficult it was in those times, both for men and women,<br />to find a partner for marriage and life.<br />It was almost inpossible to talk about, let alone experience, emotional and or sexual  feelings.<br />The short lived love story was beautifully written, and who does not recognize the power strugle in the University top.<br />The book Stoner is a very true story about life then and now.

0399162097|4.0|Wonderfully crafted group of unique relationships from an accomplished author.<br /><br />The story exists on a unique (and somewhat daring) premise.  Yet, surprisingly, it works.  I believe in these characters and relationship, in their heartbreak.  A wonderful study of lives and they way relationships work and are chosen (and are chosen for us).<br /><br />It drew me in quite before I expected it.
B00DMM3WVM|5.0|well I love I just cant say any bad word about it that's how good this game is so yeah!!!!!!!
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|There's no way you can't love this movie. Has such hilarious comedic moments and the singing is aca-amazing!! Anna Kendrick is ver talented and Rebel Wilson has definitely made a name for herself. Great, great movie!!
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Great game<br />Gameloft did great with this one.A must have for military game lovers.I can't wait to see what they come out with next
B0053FANS6|4.0|Glad to have all three movies is one pack. I love the first two but the third is not that great. It kinda sucks since they changed the actress for Evey, too. Nonetheless, good movies for an action night!
B00CDSVZHY|4.0|Tarantino does it again. And again. His ability to mix fantasy with goth and infuse a shot of brutal reality makes this movie that much more enticing. Slavery and dark comedy bring to light the pathetic reality of America during that time. Live his movies, his choice of actors, will always be a fan!
B009KS4XRO|1.0|Loved app then started freezing in the middle of game. I bought lots of boosters and now only have over 100 xps. So can only use one a game then no boosters again. Should be able to trade boosters

B00DH1G7DS|5.0|I play this while on the T commuting to work to Boston.  It's excellent and keeps my mind active without getting boring.  The Metro newspaper strewn all over the T has some in written form but mine doesn't need any pencil and I'm not limited to only one or two puzzles like the newspaper.

B00CMQX84A|5.0|This movie is a fun in the sun, exciting, full of surprises and budding romance.  Life is a beach for surfers Brady and McKenzie.  But a rogue wave takes them to the 60s beach party, &#34;Wet Side Story.&#34; A rivalry between bikers and surfers begins.  But in a sea of surfing, singing and dancing, Brady and Mack accidentally change the story line.  The film's dreamy hero and heroine fall for them instead of each other.  You have to see this movie to see if our heroes can get the plot back on track or if they will be trapped there forever.  This Disney Channel movie is funny and has high energy musical numbers.  Teen Beach Movie makes Summer last all year.  I recommend it to preteen and teen child.
B00BEZTMQ8|4.0|First off the movie was good. Sat with the kids and we certainly did enjoy it. Nothing special about it but a good watch. Almost gave it three stars but that would not be fair because I would be basing that on the first three. What I loved about the first three movies is that you just loved the characters. Heck LoTR is one of the few movies I find myself thinking about even when I'm not watching it for the twentieth time. Sadly though that is not what you get with this movie. The truth is Martin Freeman is just not good enough to carry the torch passed to him. Not horrible he would make a decent secondary character but not the main role. Once the movie is done you think to yourself that was good and that is about it. Don't really care if you see the next one or not. From a visual standpoint top notch they really do good work. In conclusion I guess you could care less about the characters but it still is fun to watch once.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I have read and enjoyed Ken Follett's novels and short stories for over 32 years.<br /><br />This trilogy is another fine example of how Mr. Follett takes the historical record and tells it as a compelling story, in this case stories of families in the England, Germany, Russia and the USA.
B005TBWN0K|5.0|This is such an awesome app by itself, or made even better as a companion app to evernote. I use it a lot to take screen shots of web pages on my kindle fire. Your on a web page just share it with skitch, tap the snap button and your ready to mark on it, as maybe a map, or you can crop it, any number of things, then save it! It's a snap!

0753541637|4.0|I enjoyed Sheryl's personal (and researched) observations regarding the unique experience of being a female leader in a male-dominated working environment. I especially appreciated her investigation into the nuances of subtle sexism - and the way that women also play a significant role in holding themselves back. I think being conscious of these ideas is helpful in today's world. Even though the real focus of the book was on female leadership in the workplace, she also delves into the homeplace, where many men are taking on increased responsibility. Sheryl asserts that the balancing of responsibilities between men and women, both in the workplace and the home, will allow for more success for our society as a whole.
B0089LOKHG|5.0|This series is a story with heart. For me, the range of emotions felt true and ran deep. I felt enveloped by the characters and the imagery was so vivid. I wish there was more books to further read in this story only because I will miss it. I've read other comments suggesting unanswered questions and/or incomplete lifelines with no definitive ending to the story. Contrarilly, I put this story to rest with a sense of totality and find the completion is at peace.
B0047CPB42|5.0|First-rate thriller.  Very difficult subject matter, yet the author handles it expertly in my amateur view.  At the end, when the reality of the situation is revealed one looks back and realises how well exposed the characters were throughout the entirety of the novel.  I would highly recommend this book.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|City of Bones is a pretty good book as the characters (for the most part) are well developed and the story flows pretty well even if there is a lot going on. I would recommend it as long as you know what your getting into i.e. it's a fantasy book

B007STBUIW|5.0|It has been often said that what Alfred Hitchcock's &quot;Psycho&quot; did for women taking showers, Steven Spielberg's &quot;Jaws&quot; did for ocean swimming.  Spielberg was recruited, for this his 3rd film, by producers Richard Zanuck and David Brown after purchasing the rights to Peter Benchley's first novel and runaway hit of the same name.  To this day, Spielberg says it was the hardest movie he ever made.  Shot on location around Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts this is reportedly the first film primarily shot at sea.  With typical location issues already in the mix, Spielberg had an uncooperative mechanical shark to deal with.<br /><br />Arguably the first film that could be called a summer blockbuster opens with the now famous 2 note cello that still haunts the film today, but instead of a mono track we get a pristine 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio.  More on that later.  This restored blu ray version is a remarkable achievement to say the least.  It can be first appreciated in the opening sequence when a gaggle of college kids are gathered around a campfire on the beach.  One comely lass (Susan Backlinie) coaxes a drunk boy to go with her skinny-dipping.  He complies of course as they run down the beach.  He stumbles, she rips off her clothes and dives in.  When I first saw this film in the theater and in numerous subsequent versions, that scene, which includes the now famous shot from below the surface looking up toward the young woman, seems to imply she is dipping skinny.  This new Blu ray would seem to confirm it.  The transfer is that good.<br /><br />For those not familiar with the plot, Ms. Backlinie's character is but the first victim of a huge Great White shark, trolling the shoreline for a meal.  The police chief, Brody (Roy Scheider), a recruited shark specialist Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and a grizzled experienced fisherman, Quint (Robert Shaw) go looking for the big fish in a boat not quite big enough.  Between the ominous John Williams score that opens the film to the exciting conclusion, Spielberg grabs the audience and never lets us go.  It is a perfect thriller.<br /><br />As far as the blu ray transfer, it comes with a resolution of 1080p and an aspect ratio of 2.35:1.  It is quite amazing.  With input from Spielberg himself, the film has been restored to better than new as previously noted.  The colors, in particular are just spectacular.  Even the nighttime scenes carry more frightening weight.  Excellent blacks, startling blues and their various shadings.  As noted earlier the audio track is superb.  With the 7.1 mix of an original mono audio there might be issues, but the dispersion of the surrounds is conservative and not distracting.  The beach scenes should be enveloping and they are.  Williams score couldn't be more appropriately reproduced.  If you want the original mono track, it is also available.  Subtitles are in French, Spanish and English SDH.<br /><br />The special features include two length documentaries.  The first called &quot;The Shark is Still Working: The Impact and Legacy of Jaws&quot; runs 101 minutes and comes from a 2007 doc about the film and technical difficulties.  Another is &quot;The Making of Jaws&quot; and runs 123 minutes which has also been released earlier.  There is about 13 minutes of deleted scenes and outtakes, some archival info, a trailer and more.  Fans of film will want to own this packagens the film to the exciting conclusion, Spielberg grabs the audience and never lets us go.

B006KX3GXO|3.0|If you post to your own timeline it works very well BUT you can't post to a friends page.  I'm using a kindle fire, If they'd fix this problem I'd rate it 5 stars.
1475143389|5.0|I'm all about simplicity & Mike makes it simple.  A quick read that answers all of your questions.  For the beginner or experienced.  For those looking to add muscle or cut fat.

Not alot of fluff, in only 160 pages.<br />David Glazier<br />Fit Boss<br />USS Bonhomme Richard
B005J9ZE5I|5.0|Better than the original, this blu-ray is def. an update to the DVD. The special features are also good. Buy if your a fan.
B005DNPKSQ|5.0|This is how big brothers got its start!<br />It was well worth the time.<br />Jim Carrey at his best!<br />Loved it!
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I don't write reviews but I do want to say I am really enjoying this series. I bought season 1 and liked it so much I spent the big bucks and purchased season 2.  Worth the money!
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|Pretty typical for most games in the genre.  Cute graphics and animations.  Levels are doable.  Tipping the screen to get points is a good touch.
B009NY43NY|3.0|Dead Ever After ended the long series of the Sookie Stackhouse books. I want to say up front that I enjoy the series as a whole. The first ten or so books were interesting and enjoyable. Something happened to the writing after the book that ended with Sookie being tortured by the fairies. It felt like the author was done with this series at that point and put out four or five more books that could have all been wrapped up in one.<br /><br />This last installment, Dead Ever After, was very disappointing. The story felt rushed with nothing new to add to Sookie's life. It was predictable and I knew what was going to happen right from the start. As a side note, I would like to have seen Sookie end up with someone other than the person she did but that's me. I read it because I like to finish a series when I start one but I wish I had rented it from the library because the money I invested could have been put to better use elsewhere.<br /><br />It's hard to give it three stars because the book alone does not deserve it. However, I am just because it did take a little time to actually write the story no matter how dissatisfied I am with it.
B002QYNIHU|4.0|This is still a great figure especially for the price, but compared to some of S.H. Figuarts other figures this one is lacking in some areas.  The paint job is good but not great, the colors don't pop as well as on some other characters; and there are not as many color tones in the hair compared to others.  Also idk if any1 else has had this problem but there seems to be something loose inside him, when I lightly shake him I can hear something out of place but it is not currently affecting his stance or any other joints I've found at this time.
B00005Q4CS|1.0|I am not judging the film on its merit or failings as a film. That is a matter of what criteria you decide to use in making the evaluation. All I am saying is that I disliked it intensely and blame only myself for not finding out the nature of it before viewing. It is the most depressing movie I have seen in many a year, being so very typical of the 'social realist' movies of the past, only with the latitude for showing behavioral patterns once forbidden by the industry's self-censorship mechanisms. Beyond this personal response, it would be unfair to rate the movie as a movie
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Couldn't put this one down, just like the previous 3.  Although I was wondering what was going on in the other story lines, splitting them up was a great idea.
0143113100|5.0|I choose them book becasue friends recommended it, and I really liked it.  A little too many clincal trials etc. but the basic guidlines were clear.

B002N5N4M6|5.0|I bought the First, Second and Third Seasons of the Big Bang Theory.  It's one of my favorite shows...well scripted, great characters played by very capable actors who make the characters real.  The situations are not run-of-the-mill.  I can watch episodes over and over and enjoy them.
B0033H7VI6|1.0|This knife is useless, unless your going to split wood.  If you already have a big knife like a BK2 you don't need this knife.  For whacking a tre down or splitting wood, Okay, but there are better out there.  Reveiws on You Tube are bull.  Listen if you own one of these it's called a SHRADE not SHA-RADE most of you english majors call them.

B009U9S6FI|5.0|I appreciated the book being divided into two main parts....the experience and the analysis of how our minds protect ourselves in times of tragedy and unbelievable circumstances.....
B00ECU2SGS|5.0|Great story with excellent character development.  A small but powerful film.  .  Worth watching.  Good good good good good good.  I detest being told how many words I need to type
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|This Book is amazing. I really love it when dark and damaged characters are romanced by girls who seem innocent, but at the same time understand the darkness. Add that to Nalini Singh's amazing writing and there is nothing better.
B006ZCWU5K|5.0|Almost all the songs are true to the times we live in - fat cats and bankers whom the law cannot catch up to. While most people wither and die with low incomes and lower coverages!
B0052RDHTM|4.0|This book provides a very general history of World War I and life on three continents.  The storyline is engaging, the characters realistic and the settings provocative for the time and place.  I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys novels and wants to gain some knowledge of world history.
B00CTKHXFO|4.0|Metal Gear has been a favorite series for years. This collection is amazing! Highly recommend this to anybody that like espionage games and a good story
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|This movie is a bit hard to watch in places and harder to imagine going through something like this. In places it seemed a little long, but overall, it was definitely worth the rental!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great game, awesome horses, saddles, reins, bridle, stir ups, blankets, saddle pads, treats, feeds, competitions, training, an amazing game, highly recommended
B004RCUJ9E|5.0|Great game. Easy to set up and play.<br />The instructions are excellent, the game board is classic and the graphics are super. Keeps one updated on matches against the cpu and provides different levels from novice to expert.<br /><br />If you love checkers. Download this.
B00BSBT8M6|1.0|Visually, yes, this movie is beautiful.  But the script and story is lacking to say the least. Cheesy, shallow messages about religion and oneness. Just nothing here to sink your teeth into. I stopped watching it two hours into it. That's saying a lot.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|A great season that showed you a lot about both main characters and was extremely fulfilling in every episode througout.
B0042EJD8A|1.0|Please watch Fracknation, not to see the \\"other side\\" of the story, but to see an unbiased fact based documentary about hydraulic fracturing.
B006ZB3V2C|1.0|It was a free app that day but I have never even opened it, submitting a review to clear out my purchases.
B008HK3XYK|3.0|I upgraded my Kindle Fire, and with it had to buy a new case. I used to have a very similar case with the same features for my original kindle fire and I loved it, it was strong leather, stood up easily etc. This one has the same features, but is not built nearly as well. It is very flimsy and very bendable. I would look into other brands that may be more sturdy.
B00CL68NOG|3.0|I was hoping for more than this film delivered: lots of cliches, stereotypes, and predicable story arc. There were some bright spots here and there, but all in all it was a mediocre film.
B008KYOCA2|4.0|It may just be that I could not find it, but I could not figure out how to make entries that were for events that spanned multiple days. Other than that this app is extremely well  made. It's simplicity in both design and function truly make it shine. The app has a ton of customization and cute icons to add to events. I really was super impressed by the app and will be happy to upgrade it to 5 stars if I can figure out multi day entries.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I had fun going back in to scenes and seeing how well hidden things were<br />It's an interesting game, I'll probably buy this one
B003B02PF4|5.0|Lots of intrigue, this book grabbed me from the first page and I couldn't put it down. I would like to say this is one of Grisham's best stories but in my opinion all of his books have been his best.
B004T0E2S8|5.0|I play the bass and this is a good place to find tabs, if they don't have bass tabs I can almost always find guitar chords to use.
B005TBN3EU|4.0|A continuation of the crazy humor of the first movie.<br />Good if you just need a cheap laugh or two.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Like that it is a mystery, but with lots of witty banter between characters.  Looking forward to season 6 soon.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Old app was much better! Auto update has made it less available with weather as it does not have info most of time.
B00C1C123E|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie! It was the first time I watched it and it was great, the dinosaurs looked amazing. I can't wait to see the next one!
B00B23O96A|3.0|Some great songs that Eric Clapton revitalized, but then a number of not so great songs. Don't know what else to say
B003EV6DBW|5.0|I just purchased the Bluray set of Doctor Who series 5 new series. It is an excellent show and the best price I have seen to date at $19.99.<br />I just like many other Who fans pay alot for most of these shows. We sure could use the break in cost. The Blu ray transfer is good and the audio is excellent.<br />Matt Smith's first season is a rapid fire, hold on to your seat affair that ends up making you want more. It has the best of what Who fans like. Pick it up while it is at this wonderful price no telling how long it will last.
B009NX88JU|5.0|Excellent movie, loved every line, every character, every song. Cameron Crowe's best work, no 'almost' about it. Would highly recommend this flick.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|I love this book, I could read it over and over again and I love that I can have it on my phone now to read anywhere!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|As an Amazon account customer, I downloaded &#34;Kindle for Android&#34; without any hassle whatever and it works well with my Amazon ebook downloads. As I only purchased an Android Tablet three days ago it is early days to comment on other ebook formats.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|It was a very good book. IT IS SO FAR THE BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ. I really enjoyed reading this book.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed E-Squared. It's a speedy practical read and all the experiments fortified my foundation. Pam methodically demonstrates in a wonderfully humorous quick-step, that we ARE exactly what we THINK we are.<br />Bravo and Touche'
B003477DVK|3.0|My wife and I watched this movie on the basis of sketchy marketing notes as we were paging through possibilities on Roku. My Dog Skip is a 2000 film, based on the autobiographical book My Dog Skip by Willie Morris. I had not read the book, but I had the feeling the screenwriter and director tried to slavishly recreate the book on film. I've usually been disappointed if I see a movie based on a book I've enjoyed, but this time I was disappointed even without having read the book. The story failed to inspire me, as I saw it as an account of one dog owner's love for his pet. There are thousands of personal stories about enduring relationships between owners and their dogs.This is one of them. In my view, it would be a good family movie, especially for families with kids under 12. There were no deep, complicated plots, no nuanced moral messages and no scenes to keep you thinking about the movie after you've left the theater. If I were comparing it to cars, I'd describe it as a Prius of a movie because it conserves energy that might come from suspense, emotion or afterthought.
B008B1VYP0|2.0|It was a mistake on my part to get this album.  I heard the music in the examples and loved it but the explicit language  was more than I could deal with.  It clearing states that this is part of this album so it was my mistake. I now find out that I can get the music (which I still love) on a copy suited for radio. Live and learn!
B00AVPYT8I|3.0|Most of the free books don't appeal to me, however there are a few that do.  If you haven't read the classics there are quite a few available.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|it is a fun game and similar to Rise of Atlantis on MSN.  Enjoy playing it and seeing how far I can get
B005MLP8E0|5.0|Probably one of the best movie in the history. Simply perfect and highly innovative from a technical point of view. We wouldn't have the contemporary cinema without this Well's mastership.<br />Unfortunately Citizen Kane should be viewed in a movie theater. The wise use of light cannot be appreciated through a small computer screen
B00DAXYNEI|5.0|I love all of the actors in this series and the manipulating that goes on keeps me on the edge of my seat.  Cannot wait for season 2.  Excellent!  I'm guessing the &#34;real players&#34; on the Hill are none too happy with this show.  Downloading the English version immediately!
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|Love Lana. She is awesome, every song is a journey and you just have to sit back and experience it. But trust me it's worth it.
B001U3Y5XE|5.0|This game is loads of fun. It's more fun the more people you play with. I guarantee you'll have a blast, for young and old.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I absolutely love this bingo and I have a lot of bingo games! This one gets my blood boiling when the bingos count down to zero.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|Just light and melodic fun, nothing earth shattering or life changing, just good plain entertainment on the heels of the &#34;sing-off&#34; movement!
B005HV6Y5W|5.0|This film requires the viewer to work pretty hard to figure out what is going on, but the result of the effort is worth it and very moving. American cinema is going through a depraved period very similar to the 1950s. Back then, in order to compete with television, Hollywood produced numerous wide-screen, color, 3.5 hour, &#34;sword and sandal&#34; epics. They usually were not as good as films of the 1930s and 1940s. Today, cinema is exploiting CGI, special effects, and excessive Foley-art. I won't go to these &#34;roller-coaster&#34; movies. &#34;The Tree of Life&#34; uses special effects but very creatively and thoughtfully. It is an excellent example of what contemporary films can be, but typically are not! It can stand beside Spielberg's Lincoln film.
B007AL48UK|3.0|I really enjoyed playing this but was disappointed when it froze up on my Samsung Galaxy tablet twice especially when I was on my way to beating my record time.
B001C34HUS|5.0|I bought this book suspecting that it would not deliver what it promises. I was mistaken. It works; well, at least if works for me, I followed it and I came up with new ideas for a html app I'm developing for a friend. It is a short read, it is possible to finish it in a afternoon. To apply its teachings is more difficult, for you have to follow its guidelines strictly. I gave it a shot and am satisfied. I'm sure I'll read it again in the near future.
B005WUHAX8|3.0|Good waterproof case but you have to take the case off to charge the phone, also some headphone jacks won't fit with the case on
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Chromecast does everything it is advertised to do and does it well.<br /><br />Setup is easy.  Plug the dongle into a HDMI port, power it via a mini-USB which can either go to a USB port on the TV or if you don't have one it comes with a wall unit.  Anything you use to charge a phone will work nicely.<br /><br />Set the TV to the proper port, then you can do the initial setup with any device.  You'll need to download the chromecast app for phone, tablet or pc.  First time through it will see the unit and prompt you to enter your wifi information.  Once it's on your wifi network, any of your devices can see it.<br /><br />You'll need to update to the latest version of Google Play, YouTube, Netflix and any other app that comes along with support for it (HBOGo in the works).  Then you need the Chromecast extension for the Chrome browser.  From there, anytime you want to display something on the TV instead of local screen just click a small chromecast icon within the app.<br /><br />It's that simple, everything works great, quality is fine.<br /><br />There are some limitations though...<br /><br />1) There's not yet an app I'm aware of to stream local media.  I know of at least a couple of these in the works.  Anything you can view thru Chrome will of course work, but Chrome's playback of local files tends to be limited and of iffy quality.  Another work around would be a plex server and point Chrome at that.  Quality again may suffer, and at this point you're talking about something you do not want to talk your mom or granny through in terms of setup.<br /><br />2) The chrome extension is only available on desktop.  The mobile versions do not yet have it.  Again, I have to think google would be working on this one.<br /><br />3) The wifi setup currently doesn't take into account the potential need for browser based logins to many (most?) hotspots.  This puts a real damper on the idea of using it in a hotel for instance.  Note that competing devices such as Roku and AppleTV will have this same issue.  Don't expect hotels to solve it for you as they'd rather you use their PPV entertainment options.<br /><br />Despite the limitations above, this product is a no-brainer for $35 if you want to utilize your TV as a display for any of your devices.
B001EC3JME|5.0|I've had mine for over a year now and this holster is tough. As a trucker I need a flashlight on me at all times and this holster has not once dropped my light. The only bad thing about it is that it's hard to slip onto your belt and harder to take off. Unless you take your belt on to slide it on or off. That being said, once its on your belt , it is not coming off. I even sleep with it on my belt and it's still held together great.
B009PK9SB8|5.0|I've decided that GoPro is really targeted for users with much younger eyes than my own.  The small LED screens on both the camera and the remote are a challenge for me even with glasses on if I want to do significant changes to the settings of the camera on the fly.  In fact, more often than not, I connect to the unit with my phone, so I can do these things with the app.<br /><br />This combined with the desire to be able to see playback immediately and ensure I got the shot, made the Touch BacPac a no-brainer.  You can easily playback anything that you've recorded as well as quickly change the settings all without having to take the camera out of the housing.  The screen is the same size as the back of the camera obviously, and that's just enough screen size to be VERY useful.<br /><br />The bacpac is easily installed.  Take the camera out of the housing, and the bacpac plugs into the slot on the back of the camera.  Very easy, that's all you have to do, the camera will see it and use it automatically.  Although the bacpac does have it's own on/off switch so you can use the camera without the screen on sucking down precious battery life.<br /><br />The other part of the installation is you will have to replace the backdoor on your housing with one of the ones included with the bacpac.  It does include one that is waterproof, so you can still use your gopro underwater even with the bacpac, and you can touch and control the bacpac underwater as well.  Your gopro will look like it put on a bit of weight, but it'll still work just fine with all of the attachments.<br /><br />What's the downside?  Well there are two.  One is battery life.  It seems to reduce battery life by about 20-25% in my experience even if the bacpac is off.  With it on, you'll do well to see 50% of the normal record time.  The other downside is you can only have one bacpac on the camera at a time, so you can't use the battery bacpac in conjunction with the LCD.  I suspect many other Hero3 users do the same thing I do, which is tote a pocketful of spare batteries if you need to shoot all day.<br /><br />Despite the battery cost, I do recommend this highly.  It makes it is much easier to see what you're doing with your settings without having to resort to connecting the app.  And you can see what you've recorded without having to go to a computer, which is also very valuable considering gopros are generally used out in the wild.
B00942Y4IY|4.0|This movie was good back in the 90's, but the HD version is MUCH better!!  Kurt Russel is bad ass!
B009YU6FJM|5.0|Album is excellent, haven't figured out if diamond eyes is better but it has a lot of flavor to the album
0761169253|5.0|This book is small, easy to read, cute ideas! I really like it. Is great to flip through for a bit of inspiration!
B00D5YNQWM|4.0|i would have given this 5 stars if they had a feature where u can play the concert without the interview snippets in between.  that being said at least the edits are between songs not into some songs like the \\"You Gotta Move\\" dvd.  the sound, picture & performances are great. only Train Kept a Rollin is seriously truncated.<br /><br />originally i avoided this dvd because i was afraid the edits were just as intrusive as in \\"You Gotta Move\\", but they aren't & what is here is of the highest quality.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|it's great for my kids- ages 6 and 9 yrs old. they ask me to play it all the time!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a really great game. My grandson and I play it all the time, need more games like this.
B00005S6K8|5.0|what wouldnt be wrong with Sabrina such a great movie. Couldn't go wrong with getting this movie! See it amazing
B007T7MIR0|1.0|This is a surprise.  I don't recall buying this.  Hope my account hasn't been hacked or something! Will have to check this out and see if it is something my wife bought.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|So good for young ladies to read about the values of belonging to a family that works together. Life, love, sharing, and death.

B0099KJFJ4|5.0|Chung le was awesome in this film really did his thing and van damme was basically just a mentor. I really recommend this film to all martial art fans Has A lot Of Action Really Great Film.
B00CM9JKQM|4.0|Because after reading the reviews I have come to believe that a new vocalist will never outdo thier original and I say this because I saw Queenrygue in Houston Texas for the Millenium Tour 2000 just shortly before they released QE2 and when Geoff Tate was doing Operation Mindcrime in it's entirety and he did that one vocal about Sister Sarah and hit the floor as if he'd been shot the lights went out and a spotlight came on with the Queensryque logos over the stage wrapped in what looked like foil, I was totally stunned, I have never seen a performance like that because it was very awe inspiring and Mr. Tate must have maybe only been 25 or so at the time, he's had a lot of miles put on him since then but he's come out with some great material since then. I remember downtown Houston looked like it was on fire there were so many lasers there, I rode out on a bicycle and watched it from a distance of about one mile.<br /><br />And I say this even tough I have not yet heard the new album with the new vocalist.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Best book I've ever read! I've fallen in love with all the characters and I can't wait to see what happens next!
B00B1E6FF8|2.0|A great movie but in the product I received the vocal track is virtually non-existent. I'm a bit leary about ordering another copy and having the same results.
B001202LRM|5.0|You really cant go wrong with slipknot,plus their debut album is only 3.99.i mean,thats the deal of the century right there.Slipknot is creative,because they really are good at screaming and playing guitars.Corey taylor is the most real artist ive seen.It sounds like he put real emotion in this debut album and his screams are as real as it gets.All the songs are fun and they are hardcore.the language may be a turn off,but slipknot really is a very good metal band.There is not a realer band than slipknot.Many peoplemay bash them for being negative,but life is full of issues and problems.This album is so personal and anyone can relate to it.All the songs are really produced well and the vocals are great for a metal band.this cd will really get your blood pumping.it is the most real hardcore album ive heard and all the songs are amazing.I really wish corey taylor would rejoin slipknot and get back to making amazing metal.Their debut album is their best,so I would really recommend buying it on mp3,because it is only 3.99.so,why not give this album a shot?
B00BGD8CFK|4.0|Not much to say here, this case works well, is stylish and retains the slim profile of the phone.  The few cons, fit is a little lose (however, it doesn’t damage your screen cover taking it on and off which is a plus) colors of actual cases are a little darker than pictured, and the case prevents normal audio/headphone jacks from fitting smoothly but is still manageable.  Overall not a bad product although I'm not entirely convinced this will save my phone from any sort of fall...which in my mind is at least half the reason for having a case
B00A8ECU24|1.0|I have to have internet and I don't have internet and my daughter wants to play with it but she can't so I am going to delete this off my kindle
0307730700|5.0|Fearless is a great book of  an American hero that we all long to be. Our hero overcomes obstacles over and over again. He just has a spirit that won't give up. He refused to be a victim, he choose to be a over comer. We all could learn this valuable lesson in life.<br />This book does have a little graphic content to it so I would recommend it for ages 13 and up. This is a must read for ever guy ho wanted to be or do more. To live a life of adventure and integrity. Men it's time to do the right thing and lead by example.<br /><br />After reading the book I passed it along to a friend who said that it was so good he couldn't put it down.
B00C2IN76C|5.0|Wonderful movie on to me really quick was brand new! The tin case looks grate with the movie it's really nice quality
B007SGM084|3.0|Is such a person really exists, it's amazing how much can happen in a persons life in such a short amount of time. Some unexpected drama, bit disturbing also.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|My mom waited like a year before she would let me get the series because I'm to sensitive and my cousin who never, ever cries cried when Rue died in the movie. If you like this series, the Gregor series is by the same author and is a great series.
B000I9YXHY|5.0|This is always a great watch I've seen so many times a great change from today movies that leave nothing  and just old fashion fun loved the music and songs that Barbra sings such talent
B00BYM5I1O|4.0|The latest new songs by Guy Clark.  It's always worth listening to this treasure of a singer songwriter.  As usual he brings acute observations of the emotional mixes we live with.
B005544V6A|5.0|Very good series. Looking forward to more of this show. Liked the twist the lawyers make keeps you  interested keep this series going
0500516766|5.0|Todd McLellan book is a tour de force.  He has disassembled a number of the modern day gadgets that we live with and reassembled them either in a very orderly way or in a more organic way and then photographed these reassemblages.  The viewer is awed by the beauty of the photographs and intrigued by all the parts that make up these gadgets.
B00BH0VSM6|5.0|I haven't read a Jo Nesbo novel that l haven't enjoyed. After having most of them set in Norway, it was interesting having this take place in Australia. Having vacationed there it was fun to be able to visualize some of the places.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|First off, I have been a professional developer for almost 25 years. I've seen the sausage being made for so long that I am accepting of minor issues because I realize the technical challenges that exist and that seeming ruin a device/service for most people. The Chromecast is an amazing device for what it can do, what it costs, and what it will do in the future.<br />What it can do:<br />Stream web content from Netflix, YouTube, Google Play. It can also mirror a your Chrome browser. That's it. Don't expect local media files unless you have some skills and want to play around with someone else's add-on project, or want to roll one of your own. Currently the best experience will be for those with Android phones/tablets. I've used mine with a Galaxy Nexus, a 2013 Nexus 7, and an iPhone 4. All worked as advertised. I understand though that device setup is not currently possible from iOS. I didn't try this, but once setup I was able to initiate a stream using YouTube on iOS.<br />What it costs:<br />$35. For that price nothing else compares. If you want something more capabil get a Roku3. It's $99 and does a lot more (thus the ~3x price).<br />What is will do:<br />This is the cool part for me and why I keep ordering more units. Google has published an open API and is encouraging developers and content companies to develop for the device. There are already many 3rd party projects out there is extend the capabilities of the Chromecast. From Pandora support to local files streaming to desktop mirroring and more. Some may knock Google for their recent shuttering of many useful products and services (BRING BACK LATITUDE!) but they've done the right this here by making a really simple device and then publishing an API so anyone can extend it.<br /><br />I've knocked off one star not because of the device itself, but because Google hasn't done enough to explain the limitations of the Chromecast. Thus too many people are getting it and are confused about what it can/can't do.This is a Gen1 device and it should be understood that there are rough edges and features that are still being tweaked.<br />Final though - If you are a Netflix subscriber and have an Android phone this should be an automatic buy, just wait until a couple more of mine have shipped. :)
1401941893|4.0|I have read dozens of books of this type and am familiar with the Louise Hay affirmations she has<br />loosely based it on.<br />  Despite my bias, both in favor of, and in an odd way, \\"not to like it\\"....I feel it is written with charm,<br />warmth and grace.<br />  There is an approachable and accessible style.  Not too preachy or scientific.<br /><br />  I think had I found this book in my teens or twenties, I would have lapped it up with joy.<br />At 65, for me, its rather \\"old news\\"...but still good news.
B008602KQI|3.0|I thought this movie was OK as I didn't get so involved with the characters or story line that I suspended belief in the outcome - I knew how it would end all the way through.<br /><br />Some beautiful scenery and pretty good acting.<br /><br />GHH
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Love this game and the theme of course. It is very addictive and the sound effects make it even better.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|The game moves along decent without having to purchase items for cash.  I would have given another star if you could earn the gold medals based on some achievement.  As it is, those will cost you cash... which I haven't done.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|All the movies plus a ton of supplemental materials and behind the scenes. A must-have for any Matrix fan. And no w that it is on Blu-ray you can enjoy it in HD!
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Many people might object to such an exercise as stripping away the scriptural gilding of Jesus.  Many may object to such a thing being done by a Muslim, believing (incorrectly) that Muslims hate all things Christian, or that they could not possibly understand Jesus.  Many will think this book has no value whatever because it deals with matters two millennia gone.<br /><br />They will miss out on a careful composition of verifiable facts that make a solid case for a wholly-human Jesus.  Reza has presented what can be relied upon, and drawn these points together into a picture as recognizable and as relatable as any in a high school yearbook.<br /><br />At the end, sources are included for the benefit of those who wish to investigate the matter, or peer beyond it.<br /><br />An excellent read!
B00001OH7N|5.0|It's David Bowie you can't go wrong
B00CWY76CC|5.0|even more than cool its grate for your brain a bit frustrating and man it is fun to play I love this app
1451627297|5.0|Excellent Book its a page turner I read the whole book in a week . Quite different from what Stephen King writes and its Time Travel in a whole new way.. Its like Time Travel History Mystery.. He put a lot of facts in the book as well. I think whoever buys this book wont be disappointed ! Thanks Mr. King for a Great Book.....
B00CRWJ7VC|5.0|Pay attention, it may seem hard to follow. But if you do you'll love it to. Well worth the price.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|The Ocean at the End of the Lane is an engaging mix of fantasy and reality.<br />The girl may be the best role model for girls since Harry Potter's Hermoine.

B009KS4XRO|4.0|Good to play when just enjoying me time. I like that it keeps changing as you progress. Fun to beat the clock with bingo and exchange trinkets
B008QTV3X0|5.0|This is the second GREAT show we found on Amazon Instant Video that we missed when first aired (the first being &#34;Justified&#34;).  Two thousand reviews got it right...by the end of the first episode (the pilot) we were hooked and watched three more episodes in one night.  Highly recommended!
B005HED11Y|4.0|Pickture quality was great. Great to see kirk again.you can laugh and marval at the high te ck special affects
B0029LCJJS|5.0|The characters are very believable. The set is amazing. I can really sense life back in those times. So far the story actually follows history (except the end of Wolsey).

B009XIXVU6|5.0|This book has so many twists and turns you can't put down. Great character development with both the best and worst that humanity has to offer.
1416550550|5.0|It does change narrative perspectives and time frames several time throughout the book but I felt it was easy to follow along and it was a lovely story.  I really enjoyed it and I will be recommending it to my book club.

B003H6KRIE|5.0|It was a real pleasure to follow the threads of the three movies in three consecutive days - better than trying to follow it years apart in a movie house.

B00DW39B2K|1.0|Fifteen years ago, the first big-screen teaming of Robert De Niro and John Travolta might have been a genuine event. Now it's just another dubious paycheck job for a pair of aging hams that's getting a token theatrical release a month ahead of its arrival on video.<br /><br />\\"Killing Season'' provides Travolta -- with a shaved head, an Amish-style beard and a thick, dubious accent -- endless opportunities to chew the scenery as a loquacious Serbian soldier who somehow survived a mass execution by US soldiers during the Balkan ethnic wars in 1995.<br /><br />Eighteen years later, he has tracked down the grumpy leader of that death squad, played by De Niro. The latter is living a hermitic existence in an overdecorated cabin in the Appalachians and avoiding his very briefly glimpsed family.<br /><br />You would think someone who executed a bunch of Serbians would be wary of meeting one by chance in the woods, but De Niro invites Travolta to his cabin for a very tedious evening of drunken conversation and listening to Johnny Cash records.<br /><br />The next morning, De Niro -- who has foresworn guns for cameras -- agrees to join Travolta for a deer hunt, with both men carrying crossbows. It soon becomes apparent that De Niro is Travolta's actual prey.<br /><br />If you've always wanted to see Robert De Niro forced to thread a steel rod through an open wound and then strung upside down by John Travolta, this is the movie for you.<br /><br />Ditto if the idea of De Niro firing an arrow that pierces both of Travolta's cheeks and pins him to the cabin door sounds appealing.<br /><br />Not to mention De Niro waterboarding his wounded prey with heavily salted lemonade.<br /><br />Mark Steven Johnson, who directed such cinematic landmarks as \\"Ghost Rider'' and \\"Daredevil,'' moves the muddled story along at a snail's pace toward an anti-climactic ending in which God is invoked repeatedly.<br /><br />He throws in lots of scenic shots to pad things out to barely an hour and a half.<br /><br />De Niro mostly looks miserable and very tired and prattles on endlessly about forgetting the past.<br /><br />You better believe he's trying to forget the dreadful \\"Killing Season,'' which the busy actor shot at least half a dozen films ago.alf.<br /><br />De Niro mostly looks miserable and very tired and prattles on endlessly about forgetting the past.<br /><br />You better believe he's trying to forget the dreadful \\"Killing Season,'' which the busy actor shot at least half a dozen films ago.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|App does exactly as advertise so if your looking for an alarm clock, I would recommend that you download this app.
B004SIPA4G|5.0|First time I saw this movie, I didn't like or respect it much at all. I think for these types of noir, graphic-novel films, you need to be in a certain mindset. You need to think like you're watching a comic unfold, forgetting about reality for a few hours. If you do, this movie is AWESOME. Marv is a badass and was the best part of the film; the separate stories are all amazing on their own, let alone throwing them all together in a single film. I was worried that having so many stories of equal importance would prove to be a letdown by at least one of them, but that wasn't the case at all. You pretty much regret that each one has to end. Everything about the film -- cast, directing, writing, over-the-top-action, set, etc. -- are all perfect. Unlike the conventional favorites critics go nuts for -- Les Mis comes to mind, and subsequently makes me throw up -- this is a TRUE masterpiece.
B00CCX9DUG|3.0|I am usually a big fan of Philippa Gregory and this series but I found this one a little patchy. I didn't warm to the character as quickly as I did with the Red Queen and the White Queen and although the story was fascinating I didn't get a real sense of Henry V11's charaster or his mothers. They seemed a bit two dimensional. I must admit I did cry at times but I was not such a huge fan of this one. Sorry Philippa. I usually love your works.
B0043GAZYS|1.0|Definitely didn't understand the extremely high rating on Amazon. First ten minutes were funny and promising, then it took a turn -- not very funny and kinda lame. I really think if you're high this will be the best movie of all time.
145162607X|5.0|Another great book by Philippa Gregory. I enjoyed it very much and look forward to Gregory's next installment. The combination of great story interwoven with historical facts is always fascinating.
B000PC0U1W|5.0|More than thought-provoking, which you should do without movies, this film was just awesome. Hugo did an amazing job with V, as did the set and clothing designers, writers, and director. The movie was just great, period.
B0068THAGY|5.0|This is a great and touching movie. I am no great film critic, but this movie has both great action, as well as an intellectual/emotional side. The underlying, unstated thoughts behind this movie almost seem to whisper of purity of Agape love. In addition it seems like we get to see the way Spielberg and Abrams view a starting video production career.
B001FB55H6|5.0|The director's cut was too long by about 30 min -- the theatrical version was perfect -- and the cartoon breaks really take away from the flow of the movie. Not that they were stupid; they're cool on their own, but do interrupt the flow somewhat. As far as the movie itself, really awesome. I love the characters, the writing, directing, the flow, the sets and designers, stories of each character within the main story, etc. Everything was great. Action was awesome, plenty of one-liners, very fun story. The last 15 min or so on Mars could have been condensed slightly, but it doesn't detract. Great movie.

B004LWZWGK|5.0|This is probably my favorite Batman movie that was ever made.  The plot was engaging and made sense, the movie flowed well, and I enjoyed it more than the other two Nolan Batmans.  (Batmen?)  It was never just a simple &#34;Kick the bad guy in the face&#34; movie.  The morality questions guided my interest in seeing how it turned out.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|Not nearly as good as the Kite Runner.  I was dissatisfied with the ending...he didn't tie up the loose ends
B0088X7YU0|4.0|I am an inveterate Starship Troopers fan.  This movie was fun, engaging, and visually pleasing.  The ONLY thing that I did not like was that it was clear that any Trooper that wasn't named would die.  I can understand plot constraints and not wanting to overwhelm the viewer with characters, but when the main characters have names on the front of their power-suits, and the rest didn't, you could figure out that the &#34;red shirts&#34; weren't going to make it.<br /><br />I am eager to see them make more.
B000UZQI0Q|5.0|Wonderful read, loved every page!!! I love the unpredictability of this series and the love gained for all the well developed characters. Buy this book you wont regret it!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I used the other xtremeclock app before I found this one on the app store. This app looks really good and has a sleep timer that allows you to select music from your personal collection to play during the countdown which is great. Overall, this app has been extremely useful on my first gen kfire.
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|Another amazing crime drama from bbc. Can't wait til new episodes appear!! Continuously keep you on your toes and the character development during each episode is fantastic.
B009CG9CXO|3.0|Not sure what they mean by \\"with deleted scenes\\"<br />I own the 25th anniversary edition released in 2000 that has the bonus footage and deleted scenes in a bonus features menu found on most dvds<br />I assumed this digital HD version would have those scenes mixed into the movie but not only is that not the case, but the deleted scenes are nowhere to be found when I play it on my tv from Amazon instant video.<br />Basically I just got an HD version of a movie I already own

0143034901|5.0|This book left me incredibly overwhelmed and emotional in the best way possible. My review won't do it any justice, but I had to say something.<br /><br />Zafon builds this beautiful word in Barcelona. The setting is so magical, and it draws you in immediately. I admit the beginning is slow, but the story and world building is masterful and captivating. I wish I had read this book in the original Spanish. I'm sure it's beautiful. The characters are rich and thoughtful. You empathize with them, and although Daniel tells the story retrospectively, you're figuring out the mystery with him. Nothing about the story seems forced or unnatural. I couldn't stop reading once I reached the last 200 pages. By the end, I was in tears - but good tears!<br /><br />This is a book for people who love books. As a reader, you become as enraptured with Carax as Daniel is. I would recommend this book to anyone, and I can't wait to begin the sequels. Beautiful book. Wonderful and intriguing story. So worth it. Can't say enough good things about it.
B00EFNXPFK|5.0|Despite all the rants from those that think he should be doing one thing or not doing the other, this is a great album. When I actually sit down and \\"listen\\" to the lyrics perhaps I will comment on those, but like with Knopfler & Clapton, whenever Mayer brings out an album, I automatically plop down my money. I am seldom disappointed.<br /><br />Love the simplicity of Dear Marie, Call Me The Breeze - strains of JJ Cale, love the country feel of You're No One 'Til Someone Lets You Down

1892005034|5.0|I'll keep this short and simple: the more you practice/apply what the Dr. Rosenberg talks about, the better the book is.  The examples sometimes seem cheesy, but they do illustrate his points well give a sense of how his key points should work in action.  Highly recommend to everyone- whether you have a problem communicating with others or not.

1609611543|5.0|This book arrived in terrific, like new condition!  It's such an interesting, eye opening read where you'll think twice about popping empty, sugar boosting carbs into your mouth again....Scary really, and yet the author seems to make such valid points based on facts and his expertise in medicine.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|It works, but I still have to jiggle the connection to power up the Kindle device.  I appreciate the good customer service.  I received the cable as promised and the representative that assisted me was kind, efficient, and answered all of my questions.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|As with everything else Neil Gaiman has ever written, I adored this story. About 3/4 through it, I realized I was nearly done and wondered whether it was just very short or whether it was so good that I'd devoured nearly a novel in two days.  It turns out that both were true. It's very short for a novel, but was also very easy to read and difficult to set down.  I'm still not sure what, exactly, it was about. But I also very much don't like having everything spelled out for me. I, for one, hope for at least a few more stories of this strange little family with an ocean-pond at the back of their home.

0399159347|5.0|I had never read anything by this author and I saw a review in Entertainment Weekly and ordered the book. Oh, I'm glad I did.<br /><br />I won't go over what the book is about, you already know that. BUT, the husband's secret is a life-changing secret!<br /><br />The characters are very well fleshed out, you get to know everyone. The reader is taken on a journey that you will never forget. At least I won't. My husband said I even talked in my sleep about this book, that's how engrossed I was! It's an amazing book and one I won't soon (if ever) forget!
1620404869|1.0|I picked this book up on a whim, thinking it might be an interesting read.  I read it in two days - not because it was so thrilling that I couldn't put it down...oh no, it was more of to get it over with!<br />The writing style, while not completely awful, was actually very juvenile and 'goofy'.  I was under the impression that the main reader of this book would be someone of the age to appreciate Colin Firth in a wet shirt, which is not exactly the teenage aptitude for which this writing style suits.  (I later discovered that the author does write teen fiction, which explains a lot).<br /><br />The main character, Jane 'Erstwhile' Hayes- I could not sympathize or like her at all.  She is immature and wishy-washy at the best of times.  Why she should be ashamed of her love of classic literature and the telling of such in dvd form (her Pride & Prejudice dvd's that get randomly hidden around her apartment) is beyond me.  Even if she watched it an ungodly amount of times and imagined herself as Lizzie Bennet, there is no reason to think that, just by seeing it on her shelf, her friends and family would know of her obsession.<br />While I commend her for not being like the 'average' woman of this day and age (I'm one of those rare people who still believes in the whole 'sex-is-for-marriage' thing),  I find Jane to be so utterly hopeless when it comes to relationships that, should I perchance to meet her somewhere, I would like to recommend a good therapist before she even thinks of attempting to be in another relationship.  She counts among her 'past boyfriends' a sixth grader with whom she shared pixy sticks and valentines, and a oily man whom she'd seen for three weeks after he complimented her (despite her bad haircut).<br />During her stay at Pembrook Park, she seems to continuously forget that the people she is with are all actors or guests, and even though she makes up her mind to 'indulge and play along', Jane is constantly doing the exact opposite.  She says over and over that she's made up her mind, and yet, she never really does.  It's all 'oh, i'm going to dive in head-first and get this over with, but i refuse to lie about my actual age' and similar idiotic things.<br /><br />But enough of my dislike for Jane - another point I can't leave out is that the author really seems like she's trying really hard to include themes and ideas from the many books she's read.  (From what she's written, she's obviously read all of Jane Austen's work, Jane Eyre, and Great Expectations as well - all of which I have read so I know of what I speak...or type).  It was so obvious to me at the very beginning that * SPOILER ALERT* Mr. Nobely was to be Jane's 'Darcy' character, whether or not she knew it.  Seriously, the girl went with the ideal of Darcy in her mind, and yet Mr. Nobley acts as terse and rude as one would hope, yet she can't see that he is the one who she's been pining after for her ENTIRE LIFE.<br />I'm shaking my head at the density of this character.<br />Aside from that, there are so many poorly regurgitated ideas that Miss Hale has borrowed from Austen that I could practically count them on my hands; and not only does she use them fairly obviously, she actually compares certain events and people to Austen's characters and their attributes.  I understand that the 'actors' and Pembrook should indeed have these characteristics, but it goes much further than flattering imitation.<br /><br />The one redeeming part of this book, the short period of time in which I actually allowed myself to hope for a decent ending, was ruined by the terrible ending.  *SPOILER ALERT*  Turning down Mr. Nobley during his awkward proposal was pretty amazing.  It bothered me that Jane was set to jump into a 'real world' relationship with Martin despite only knowing him for a few weeks (and even then, how often did she really see him?  Not often enough to get serious with, especially when they live continents apart).  However, the fact that Jane came to herself and showed Mrs. Wattlesbrook a bit of the what-for when she had been such a douche actually felt pretty good.  And when Jane was at the airport, I was so impressed with her turning on her heel and leaving the two actors/love interests gaping behind her with the last sentiment of 'Tally Ho!' still ringing in their ears, I was really surprised and happy.  I had been completely let down with Jane throughout the entire novel, but I actually sat up straighter and let myself believe that there might be a decent ending.  Maybe Mr. Nobley would think of what he'd done and somehow make contact with Jane when she landed back in the U.S., where they would start to get to know each other online or over the phone.<br />Well.  Was I wrong.<br />Lo and behold, Mr. Nobley somehow gets himself onto the plane with ease (despite being dressed like a lunatic, to which I would think might cause some sort of delay) and plops himself into the seat next to Jane, confessing that his feelings for her are and always have been real.<br />It seemed so far-fetched to me, and so ridiculous at this point, that I had to keep myself from throwing the book against the wall.  But, I rallied and continued on to the end like a trouper because, in all seriousness, I paid $11 for this book and I was darn well going to finish it.<br /><br />In the end, I felt so much like I had just read a fairly-well written internet fan-fiction by a fanciful teenage 'mary-sue', that I felt really ripped off.<br />There was nothing more to this book than a lot of girlish fantasies that made me cringe and wonder where the characters with the eye-patches, scars, and heterochromia were. (If you haven't read fan-fiction or comics, this might go over your head, but basically, they're staple characters that young authors love to inject into their often self-starring delusional writings).<br /><br />I have never wanted to hurt an inanimate object in my life, but my honest to goodness thoughts when I finished this book were 'I want to strangle this book...I hate this book!'<br />It was such a disappointment, I really wouldn't recommend it to anyone over the age of 20.

0007350740|2.0|As a chiropractor, I'm always interested in reading books about healthcare - both traditional and &#34;alternative.&#34;  This one is a handfull.  The material in Bad Pharma regarding the unscientific basis of much of the medical system and its perverse relationship to the pharmaceutical industry is of the utmost importance to the future of our healthcare system - both from a national and personal level.  The reader is presented with an encyclopedic amount of valuable and eye-opening information which, hopefully, will lead to a more informed health care consumer.  My main problem with Mr. Goldacre's approach here is the length of the book itself.  I would have preferred an more concise explanation of the problems, and think that could have easily been done without missing the point.  But I would have to admit that his thouroughness in covering the subject matter may be rewarding for those who can get through it.
B000IZ7YK6|5.0|I'd heard of this movie as a classic Jack Nicholson film but had never actually seen it. I'm a fan of Noir films from the 50's and this is similar in tone and subject. Great acting all around. The surprise ending was also a plus.

0062255657|5.0|I have always loved Neil Gaiman's works, but this one just knocked it out of the park for me. He retains the child-like wonder of his previous works but with very adult themes. And the emotions are most definitely apparent in this novel. A terrific read by beach, plane, or commute.

B000UOGHKS|5.0|In 1992 Madonna did something rather unprecedented for a female pop superstar. She launched a multi media publishing company/custom label that she quite appropriately called Maverick. A popular label with creatively independent female artists such as M'Shell Ndegeocello and Alanis Morissette, Madonna decided to launch the venture with works of her own. In this case both musically and literately. One of the offerings was of course her infamous steel bound erotic photography/poetry book simply entitled [[ASIN:8440631170 Sex]]. While the assertion was certainly laudable,it was an important election year and the book got caught up in moral politics and was condemned accordingly by the press and heavily parodied by Saturday Night Live at the time. Never one to take criticism badly, Madonna relied on her most vital talent: her over-growing musical talent. From 1989's [[ASIN:B000002LGQ Like a Prayer]] onward Madonna had shown enormous musical growth,both as a songwriter and vocalist,as the transition of the decades occurred. With the assistance of producer/engineer Shep Pettibone Madonna fashioned this album that,for all intents and purposes,acted as a musical companion to her book. And happily its reception was deservedly a lot warmer.<br /><br />  The title song opens the album,featuring a very stripped back trip-hop/funk arrangement that,especially for such a lyrically explicit song,is built around a sample of the horn break of Kool & The Gang's very sexually implicit \\"Jungle Boogie\\"-showcasing Madonna's musical soft and hard line. \\"Fever\\" is a beautifully re-presented version of the Peggy Lee classic-done up in a cool mannered house style. \\"Bye Bye Baby\\",the hit \\"Deeper And Deeper\\", \\"Why Is It So Hard\\" and \\"Where Life Begins\\" all follow in the grooving early 90's dance/funk/chill style of the title song-either in an upbeat or downbeat way depending on what the lyrics demanded. \\"Bad Girl\\" and \\"Words\\" both showcase her newfound and more epic style of balladeering-showcasing the development of her writing and vocal range. On the intense high NRG house of \\"Thief Of Hearts\\",Madonna asserts herself quite profanely to another female interloper. \\"Rain\\" is another hit,actually the most 80's sounding of the material here as it sounded very much like a song recorded for but not included on her previous studio album. \\"In This Life\\" is a beautifully torchy piano based piece where Madonna reflects heavily on friends who had passed from AIDS-even asking us \\"have you ever watched someone die\\". One of her most poignant songs ever. \\"Did I Do It?\\" mixes some hip-hop rapping into the mix whereas \\"Secret Garden\\" might be the jazziest song Maddona has ever made with its drum and horn atmospherics.<br /><br />  Truth is Madonna has made some seriously crackerjack albums over the years,despite consistent criticism that she is more carefully crafted imagery and popular hit singles. As far as I'm concerned this has to be a candidate for the most important album she has ever recorded. In terms of subject matter and music,she established herself as a fully adult artist and someone with a very mature outlook on her own bravery. This album surely doesn't hide anything between the sheets. She psychoanalyzes eroticism all over the map on this album. Everything from performance anxiety,multiple readings on the act of sexuality itself and even the Freudian side of S&M in terms of trying to possess ones own family members. Musically the album explores a very elaborate and (and the time) quite noncommercial blend of hip-hop styled funk,chill/trance/electronica elements and a dollop of jazz as well. This is where Madonna officially went from being a consistent hitmaker to being an artist. This might've been her most neglected album too-not just for its unabashed creativity and carnal reflection but for its association with her poorly received book. Musically and lyrically both the explicit and the implicit blend together in poetic and often very unexpected ways. Upuntil now I've never heard a Madonna album quite like it. And there's a good possibility this album totally altered the focus of her musical career as well.until now I've never heard a Madonna album quite like it.

My family and I have rented it on VHS as many times as I can remember, and we have been having trouble locating a copy of it to buy ever since it's release to home video. But in the year 2007, I was walking through my local Borders Bookstore (Long before it had gone out of business)and I found the DVD and I bought it for my younger brother but I ended up watching it more then he did. I also have the soundtrack which I got as a Christmas gift in 2008. Some time in the later future, I am planning to buy my own copy of the DVD.

B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Keep an open mind and read this book.<br /><br />It is not about christianity and its ideology...it is about the man behind the ideology.  Not a profit but a brave individual who stayed the course and went much farther than the rest in defense of those who were left behind to fend for themselves.  It is absolutely astonishing how the social and political climate in the time of Jesus resembles our present day situation around the world and particularly in our country.  The haves and the have-nots and all those in between who sold their soles to be part of the haves.  Aslan has done his research as a scholar and approaches this book with intelligence and honesty.  As an atheist I must say that this book made me take notice of a man who had the conviction, belief and the conviction to go as far as sacrificing his life for the betterment of those in need.  Profit he was not but certainly a great brave man.

B00CCEHR80|4.0|I do love this particular line up of the JGB, but I did not feel that it had the edge to it that the Warfield concert had [[ASIN:B000002VM1 Jerry Garcia Band]]. Let me be honest and say that this may grow on me more as I continue to listen to it. That I will definitely do! I was glad to see the band covering \\"And It Stoned Me\\" and that quite surprised me as I'd never seen a Van song on anything that had Jerry Garcia on it...but then I haven't heard literally everything Garcia did. Garcia doing Dylan songs was nothing new to me and I always loved his long leads on songs like \\"Tangled Up In Blue\\". I won't say run out and get this because if you are a JGB fan you will have already done so! For those that think that Jerry was just associated with the Grateful Dead, however, I would encourage you to check the JGB out. You wouldn't regret it! I'd like to say one more thing and then I'll shut up. IMHO Jerry's voice was so much clearer and better in his younger days. Voices age and change though some less so than Jerry's. Even so it is not at all unpleasant to listen to!

One day, when there was nothing else on that held my interest, I gave The Big Bang Theory a second chance and I have never looked back!  It was hysterical from beginning to end and I have since become an \\"addict\\" when it comes to the show.  Each character is so well developed - from Penny, the slightly ditzy waitress at the Cheesecake Factor to Sheldon, the obsessive-compulsive genius who delivers non-stop laughter. I am so amazed at the excellent writing and there is never a dull moment.  So glad it came out on DVD - I am buying every season!

Even the peripheral characters are amazing - Laurie Metcalf gives an absolutely hysterical performance as Sheldon's Bible-thumping Mama, whereas Christien Baranski is superb as the ever-cold, ever-frigid mother of Lenonard.  And who can forget Mrs. Walowitz - who can be heard constantly yelling uncouth remarks at poor Howard, while we get to see Raj visit with his parents who are most concerned about him finding a nice Indian Girl.  There is nothing better and I can always count on this show to make me laugh non-stop!

B00BEJOMIW|5.0|I ordered the Great Gatsby original movie from 1974 on BluRay because my dad appeared briefly in a non-speaking role as a butler.  He had told me it was fun for him and that it was filmed in Newport, RI.  He passed away about 20 years ago.
B000HF6XV8|5.0|The Secret Garden in one of those movies in which many good elements come to work together and produce something fine and memorable.<br />Based on a story by Frances Hodgson Burnett (A Little Princess). There's the producer Francis Ford Coppola, who had then just directed Bram Stoker's Dracula in which the art direction was excellent, there was director Agnieszka Holland, and composer Zbignew Preisner (Trois Couleurs trilogy soundtracks),adaptation by Caroline Thompson (Edward Scissorhands), Photography by Roger Deakins (The Shawshank Redemption), and an excellent cast though perhaps no big names on it giving memorable performances: Kate Maberly, Maggie Smith, Laura Crossley, John Lynch...<br />And every part of the story shot in beautiful-to say the least-locations and settings, both indoors and outdoors, and a completely idilic garden, just watch it come alive in the spring!<br />Probably it's lessons will be more discernible for grown ups, which will be their rewards. It was one of the first of my DVD collection, and I'm waiting for a Blu-Ray version.
B005H9B44A|3.0|The best re-creation of Thor the comic book yet. The acting was decent but the action was fantastic. The director did a good job.
0765325950|1.0|Very poorly written. A lot of  characters that were built up for something glorious were swept under the rug in a one sentence death, in which case most sentences were four words deep. It was painful to read and it took me MONTHS to finish instead of hours as it has in the past.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is a great app-I love playing bingo and when I can't get to a real bingo this satisfies me.  Very exciting and highly addicting..... Thoroughly enjoy this app-never a problem games flow and I never have experienced any hiccups.with the app....
B0064NTZJO|3.0|This movie is not bad. The beginning scene is awesome how he avoids the cops. This movie shows you how quickley the crap can hit the fan.
1400106346|5.0|It is complicated to review a classic. The content itself is excellent, but over a century of popularity is better to tell you that than an Amazon review. Sticking to the quality of recording, it's Simon Vance, so it is wonderful. He has a remarkable ability to voice male and female characters without sounding stilted or fake. An excellent rendition of a timeless story.
B000M5AJQI|4.0|This is a good movie. The acting was great. Matt Damon and Leo D are really good in this. Plus the blue-ray version is great!
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|This was by far my favorite TV show. Peter Falk played Columbo Perfectly. Don't think anyone else could have came close to his performance as the bumbling sleuth. The only problem was that Season 1, Disc five did not have anything on it. Was a blank disc. Is there anyway to receive a playable Disc 5? Please let me know. Thanks, Tony Stewart.
B0042U94UQ|4.0|I bought this for my daughters but I think this has more adult humor than stuff for little kids. They did not get the humor, but I loved it.
1781164266|4.0|Love this book, the only downside is that it focuses a bit much on Dead Space 3. I would have liked more attention on previous titles.
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|The app that I have on my Kindle that checks for threats said this was a threat to my Kindle. Not many apps come up as threats but this one did so uninstalled this app.
B005N09L5C|1.0|Simply put, this movie just did not do anything for me. I understand the themes and struggles of the characters but there was nothing particularly redeeming or thought-provoking here for me.
B000AY74OG|5.0|I bought this for my daughters and this is one of their favorite movies. They watch it all all the the time. Great movie for kids.
1577312082|5.0|Listened as I drove to work every day that the Boss from Hell was there. Finally they FIRED HIM...WooHoo.<br />I think I'll just revisit the CD -- thanks for the reminder.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Awesome game can't put it down for one minute!!  Recommend it to all who live the minions and running games!!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this game, wish i could win items easier, haha. I did get locked out for three days so i lost my daily credits for three days which was 93 times three but other than that i have no problems.
B00DHKKN6Q|3.0|It's okay, but I don't like having to pull back to shoot; would prefer to just touch screen where I want to hit.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Cute, colorful, and dispicable. Keeps the eyes happy. It's even better when connected to facebook. you can compete against your friends scores and send them taunts.
B007Z9QWVK|1.0|This movie has such a good true life storyline that they totally botched, it jumps all over the place and doesn't convince you at all how they came to love each other.  I thought Madonna would make this great and it is an epic fail!!!!!!!!!!
B00821OX98|5.0|This show is cool. If you like sci-fi and action then your on the right spot. Do yourself a favor and check it out
B004XQO8JG|5.0|This is an absolute MUST HAVE for anyone who was young in the 80s.  This is stoic Stallone in one of his greatest flics. FILLED with cheesy lines and ultra-violence, as well as one of the best car chases Ive ever seen.  For $10, you and your buddies will get 10x that in laughs.  TRIVIA:  Stallone turned down the lead role in Beverly Hills Cop for THIS role. I think it worked out for the best!
0553381687|5.0|Loved it! It came just as I expected it to be delivered. I could not be more satisfied with the product.
B001O7JHVG|3.0|I bought this for my 80s action film collection.  Im a huge fan of the cheesyness and over-the-topness of 80s movies in general, but this was a little bad.  It has moments, but i was hoping for either a better movie or a worse one.  With these 2 stars, they shouldve hit this one out of the park, but they fell way short.  I was secretly hoping for more memorable awful lines, and there were many, but some were actually more embarrassing. Rent it, dont buy it- unless youre a collector- in which case the quality of the disc is superb and worth the $6-7 it cost to buy.
B00005J9PB|5.0|HAHA I love this movie and the craziness it brings, and girls heroes AWESOMENESS plus the books are fun and colorful and they did a good job bring that to the movie too
0307341577|4.0|Libby Day's mother and sisters are murdered, and her brother gets the blame.  That's not a spoiler, that's the start of the book.  Libby herself has blocked out many parts of her childhood and that night, but begins to look back into those \\"dark places\\" to reveal the truth.<br /><br />The book cleverly jumps between the day of the murders and the present day while unwinding the plot of who killed Libby's family.  The story is told from various viewpoints as well with little overlapping details, like easter eggs.<br /><br />This was definitely a page turner.  I'm a thinker and I like to figure out the mystery, so I'm very disappointed when I do early on. This book was not a disappointment at all.  It had me guessing right up to the end.  Well written, well thought out characters and details.  I've read Gillian Flynn's other books (Gone Girl and Sharp Objects) and quite liked this one as well.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|Very informative, right approach through understanding the context first. Took one start because of repeating same things again and again.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This is a lovely book about the intertwining of lives and stories, told from 1949 to the present.  Not what I expected from the author of The Kite Runner.
B004478AS4|5.0|Boy do I know this man! Fascinating character study and the story never goes out of date. RIP Mr. Achebe!
B009QW7MQS|4.0|Pierce Brosnan is a really good 007. His dry wit is convincing as a British agent. Teri Hatcher is drop dead gorgeous, and of course Judi Dench is solid in her role. I am less thrilled with the villain's actor, Jonathan Pryce; but he is THE villain in the story to dominate the world.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|a ton of characters so can be a bit confusing to follow in the beginning. you have to give a season, after the first season you get the names, characters and roles down. learn a little history and culture while being entertained. it is worth giving it a try!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|If you like futuristic Sci-Fi, you'll love this. Other reviewers reveal way too much.  Very well done, not a cheap production...
B00BP0O7QW|3.0|I love this book which is why I wanted my own copy. I don't like movie covers, but I couldn't find a different cover in any of the stores in my area. I was very happy to find it here, but when the book arrived it wasn't the cover in the picture. The movie cast is lovely, but I want legs and feet in the corner of a green background. I'm very disappointed. The only reason I ordered this was for the cover shown. But again, the story is fantastic.
B004RCUJ9E|5.0|I love to play this game it makes you use your mind. Its a game we all know and love.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I wouldn't start this book late in the evening as you might not be able to put it down.  I kept wanting to know how it was going to end.  Definitely suspenseful.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The bundle gives you the best deal and it reads well too ;) i really enjoy reading this book! And once again it was a cheap bargain!
B00A11AN6O|1.0|yes, i know it is free, but what a let down! i mean, i use a PPC mac powerbook, and i can't get a cloud app that will work with LEOPARD?!! well excuse me for not being able to afford a new mac, and not wanting to buy a windows computer and get a virus...sheesh!<br /><br />it seems there as a cloud app that would work with ppc before, but it appears i can't get it, at least from amazon.<br /><br />any advice? please write to me/reply. thanks!
B005544TRQ|5.0|I'm mostly into reality shows. I was bored on Saturday afternoon and went to the iTunes chart to see what the top shows were for the week. One was Suits. I went on the website to check on what it was about. Well, I tuned into the pilot, then the first show, second, third and the addiction began....This show is a winner. The only other drama on TV I watch is Breaking Bad. This show Is neck and neck with Breaking Bad in terms of excitement and drama. It doesn't hurt that they have good looking people on the show as well.
B000Q76K1A|4.0|this is one of my favorite trilogies, action packed, great acting and very suspenseful. i want to own the DVD package!!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Typical page turning Grisham novel. I really enjoyed it. Just when I thought I figured it all out the plot twisted. Good job!
B0094K1PW4|3.0|this movie, is not bad but its not great either. the movie is long and the plot moves slow. i probably would not rent it again.
B00881PPTO|4.0|I am extremely happy with the app. I have it on my Kindle Fire and my Samsung Galaxy S4. The app is great
B0000524E5|4.0|Arrived in good condition and fast delivery. Cool movie to watch about a young lady leaves home & moves to New York to pressure her dream as a song writer. But, she's gotta live - needs a job. She becomes a Coyote.
B000FC11A6|5.0|I hated buying it for the Kindle, since I have the softcover, but it's pretty raggedy from reading. I'm pretty sure I'm into my fifth go-round and it hasn't lost any of its charm, nor made me skip any sections. If you don't know what it's about, read it. If you do, read it again. A rare book that never bores (even the math is interesting, and I'm lucky I can add two and two), the characters are great and the plot ... well make that &#34;plots&#34; .... are amazingly interwoven sometimes with &#34;real&#34; people and events. Just go get it and settle in to start reading it.
B00BH0VSM6|5.0|My first Jo Nesbo book and I could not put it down. Interesting character that has many flaws but gets his man in the end.
B0060D08JO|5.0|Brings me back to when I was a little kid and loved the original. Mind blowing CGI and great story line.
0399159347|5.0|I am always looking for new authors to adore and it's hard for me because my taste runs eclectic. Liane Moriarty is a gem. I am now going to scout out all of her other books - I hate comparing books to other books but she reminds me ( I don't know who started writing first) but of Emily Giffin - it might be Chick lit but it is good chick lit and I don't know if I am just not a good detective or what but the \\"letter\\" when it was revealed had me picking myself off the floor. I was really surprised...I love her writing style, she's funny yet thought provoking. This book contains three different weaves of stories and they all kind of come together at some point (I have this one on my kindle so I don't know what \\"page\\") but it's really good I strongly recommend this to anyone looking for just a good book to read. Period. I will definitely be getting her other books as I noticed they've received good reviews as well and I really really liked this book.
B008602KQI|4.0|This movie is good, this movie is great. Watch this movie to see Katniss' fate.  You will like it, you will love it.....if you don't then you can shove it.
B00C28J2VQ|5.0|I am a G.I.Joe fan girl so this movie was great, especially seeing Snake-eyes and Jinx in action. Love it!
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Awesome John (Kate) Corey adventure action,compelling, fun humorous. Love Johns mind work. Glad he's one of the good guys. Hope there's more to come.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surf because you can jump over the train's and i also love tricky because she is so cool and i love Jake.By gianna verlezza.%
1476733953|5.0|This book was much better than I thought it was going to be when I checked it out at the library.  I was surprised how well made the \\"world\\" of the book was.  There was never a moment when you thought, \\"That so wouldn't have happened in real life!\\"  I can't wait to read the next installment as you get quite attached to the characters and their story is far from over even though you come to the end of the book!  Pick it up, give it a chance, and you too may be surprised just how much you enjoy this great work!
B008TRH5N6|5.0|This is about the best book I've ever read.. After reading several books on New Thought, this one completes the circuit by digging into the topic of our the wealth buried in our mind.. Get this book at once.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|The news feed goes to the blue boxes after 10 or 12 posts. You can't read comments,open pictures or links. People have been asking for this to be fixed for quite a while. I know you can do better than this.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Love this game. Very much worth the purchase.<br /><br />Has many great pre-made decks and cards and the feature that allows custom desks.
B002FE5XVK|5.0|David Byrne is electric in this classic concert video. Still one of the best. A must-have for any Talking Heads fan
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is awesome u should see the update its so awesome it's like u playing on the computer it's awesome
1452101248|5.0|I got this book based on a couple recipes of Ottolenghi's that were in Bon Appetit.  Best purchase ever.<br />My entire extended family cooks and we have a number of books that all of us own, like the Silver Palate books, Joy of Cooking, Julia Child and now this one.<br />I'd ordered one for my aunt for Christmas and my whole family joined in to keep her from buying it the week before Christmas because we'd made a dish from it and she was wild to buy it immediately.<br />Awesome books for veggies and non veggies alike.  Ottolenghi has an amazing way with veggies that successfully replaces the need for meat for even the most adamant of carnivores.
B00280LYHS|5.0|This book series is amazing!!! If u like books and I mean any kind of book, read this series now!
B009POCG2C|5.0|Just love this man and his movies.  Enjoyed the story line and the charactters as they all developed.<br />Looking forward to any future movies he will make.
B00005JKNF|5.0|I absolutely love this movie, Julian Fellowes leaves you wanted more! I also love how he made the all characters so three dimensional!. Maggie Smith's character, Kristin Scott Thompson's character and the character Mary were my favorites! The film also showed how divided the class system was in England. If you love Downton Abbey you will definitely love Gosford Park.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|I loved this movie.  We originally saw it in the theater, and loved the big screen.  Music was great.<br />The story line was interesting.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Very creative and the animation is entertaining. Recommend game to all ages. Advancement is not frustrating and the incentive rewards are progressive and easy to share with fellow gamers
B00B4FU6KE|5.0|Growing up in Norman, Oklahoma I would frequently see a baby chimpanzee dressed in baby clothes in a shopping cart at the grocery store.  Of course, I didn't understand why that family got to have a baby monkey and my family did not.  This story provided the answers behind the &#34;experiment&#34; and its consequences.  If you've ever wondered about what it would be like to have a chimpanzee sibling, this is the book for you.  Very heart-warming and heart-breaking!
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Found this book in a magical way: it was the first book I borrowed from one of Milwaukee's Little Free Libraries.  The author helped this reader easily remember visits to his own home village and thoughtfully consider... and wish... that the story took place there.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|exactly what i thought it would be. this requirement is very annoying and i will not be doing any more ratings.
B00CH87HF4|1.0|This is a great game in terms of play.  But 2 things ruined the game experience.<br /><br />1. A fatal bug that forces you to delete your characters no matter how much time you spent.<br /><br />  All skills are gone in no reason and after I contacted the customer support, I found there's no way to recover this situation except deleting the character.  They offer compensation but no way to recover the time I spent on this toon.  There should be a way to save the character information on cloud. Otherwise you are just wasting your time.<br /><br />2. Slow game update<br /><br />  As I mentioned above, there are lots of bugs in this game including unplayable ones.  But the update pace is very slow compared to other games or iOS games.  Once you hit one of unplayable ones, the only way to recover is either uninstall the game or delete your characters.  They will compensate your money if you spent but the time you spent will not be back.  So be careful, beware there are lots of bugs.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|Superb acting, charm, humor, wonderful characters, funny and touching all at once.  I LOVED this film and cannot recommend it highly enough!
B00DIJ49UW|5.0|My favorite tracks are 1 and 18...  If you like the movie you gotta get this sound track...  I hope they make Pacific Rim II
B005S9EJ14|5.0|This film has so much to recommend it - great acting, interesting characters to care about, humor, poignancy, exotic and unusual setting - joyful and satisfying!
B00AHJL7BK|5.0|I found he app well designed and easy to use. There are plenty of different puzzles and several challenging levels.
B0001CNRBG|5.0|My husband and I love this funny and touching film.  We bought this copy to give to a friend as a gift so we could share the pleasure with her..
B005GRF2UK|5.0|Of all the versions of this movie, this one with William Hurt is my favorite. It was so close to my imagination while reading the book, which is rare when your book experience matches the movie experience.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|great game! way better than temple run. a lot of variety and good increased difficulty. sometimes the game lags a little.
B00006J3WH|5.0|This was absolutely a great album. The songs were amazing; the lyrics and music and accompaniments were genius. And who knew that the entire cast could hold a tune! Brilliant, just brilliant!
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|After the initial setup, none of my device((iPhone, iPad & Mac book) at home were able to connect to the device. It worked the first day, the next time I tried it just doesn't want to connect. The only solution I found was to restart the router every time which is not feasible. The whole experience is very frustrating and I am a techie. The only consolation was that it is only $35. If you are looking for a hassle free device which just works then it is not for you. The device is in its infancy and needs a lot of improvement.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|A great and fun movie. Put together by a team that totally loves what they do, knows how to capture Middle Earth, and presents it in a great package. Peter Jackson is the man!
B003Y5USF0|3.0|I remembered it being better than it actually was.  I'm something of an inactive fan of meteorology.  I find severe weather to be endlessly intriguing, so it's only natural that I'd enjoy a movie about tornadoes.<br /><br />The problem with this movie isn't in the casting or the acting.  The main character's sixth-sense perception of storms and a storm's ability to produce tornadoes is pretty far-fetched.  I think the script puts too much effort into personifying tornadoes when it could've instead focused further on the utter chaos of tornadoes.  The movie even has a scene where they try to turn it into like a personal battle between them and tornadoes, which is a pretty silly premise.<br /><br />On the plus side... the graphical work on the tornadoes holds its own even to this day.  They certainly spared no expense on the special effects front, and there're some funny lines and situations the characters find themselves in.<br /><br />So the movie's not BAD.  It's just a bit cheesy here and there.  I want to say it finds a half-way point between mainstream and B-movie status.  I give it an average rating.
B00BWWS81S|3.0|KT Tunstall has time and time again brought out album after album of great memorable music, each album better than the last (Tiger Suit being my personal favorite) constantly evolving her style, but while also maintaining an even balance of low and high energy songs. The songs in this new album are not bad by any means, if you're a KT fan you will find something in this album worth liking, but this album is nothing in comparison to her previous work, you can't possibly convince me that any songs on this album are better or reach the same level of lets say: Miniature Disasters, Under The Weather, Suddenly I See, Black Horse and the Cherry Tree, Another Place To Fall, Beauty Of Uncertainty, Saving My Face, If Only, Glamour Puss, Difficulty, Lost, The Entertainer, shall i go on? My personal feelings on this album are \\"Meh\\" mainly because most of the songs aren't very memorable like some of the ones i just mentioned, in fact some of the better songs on this album are only included in the deluxe edition which makes me feel sorry of anybody who bought the regular edition. Overall i wouldn't really recommend this album to anyone other than serious KT fans, i adore Kt Tunstall, but this was somewhat of a disappointment for me.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I luv these mystery games! If u having tried it yet your missing out!!! There's little task that need to be achieved and it keeps you wanting more! I'm definitely going to purchase the full version so I can keep going!!
B004W2UBYW|5.0|One of those books that you look forward to reading each evening!! It is a (sometimes brutally) honest insider's look at the man who envisioned and created the technological devices we now take for granted. (Book was read, and review written, on an iPad!!)
B008FPOIT6|5.0|This book was just plain fun. An unemployed guy walks into a bookshop and gets the graveyard shift at a 24 hour bookstore. It's a mystery to him that the bookstore is able to stay in business; he asks himself: &#34;is it a bookstore or is it a lending library&#34;? He applies his marketing knowledge to inspire some interest in the bookstore and inspires a budding relationship. He's a guy with a variety of eccentric friends who provide him with inspiration and esoteric knowledge. The book juxtaposes an ancient society against a techie environment and the fun begins. I learned a bit about typography, museum cataloging, programming, Google culture, San Francisco and much more. I thought this book was not for me at first but after a couple of pages I was hooked. Give it a try - you'll enjoy it!
B004EC5IUW|5.0|I loved this series on DVD and it's even better on BluRay. Yeah the story is slightly changed/edited for the theatrical release, but the quality of the updated HD theatrical release, combined with the awesome story, is something you can't go wrong with. This series is a must for anime fans and a definite purchase for fans of this series.
B00874T02K|5.0|This app leaves you sore the first couple work outs and does wonders as a total body work out. 6 weeks just flies by.
B00992CF6W|4.0|This game is great for all ages!! Very clear pictures, keeps him entertained for some time.  Easy to install; Love!
B00028HBKC|5.0|I have not seen the video yet.  We have been trying to plan a family day.  HOWEVER, I did see the movie and that is why I ordered the video.  It is a MUST see.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|I'm a big fan of hidden object games, and Epic Adventures, Cursed On-board does not fall short in meeting my expectations. Great job G5 Development Team!
B00BSBVLF8|5.0|Exactly like being in the audience. And your able to focus on the acrobats more clearly. Would love to see more movies from them. Love the water part also. Wish I was in Vegas to see there water shows because it is one of a kind and must see.
B00D2ZF24O|4.0|It's not what I thought it would be, but I enjoyed it; and, for those who keep saying Will Smith is trying to promote his son's career, maybe this is true, but if the boy didn't have talent, all the promotions in the world wouldn't help.  I love Jaden.  He's proved himself in The Karate Kid, The Day The Earth Stood Still, and this.  It is a coming-of-age movie, where the boy is forced to survive on his own.<br /><br />And, people need to stop hating  on this kid, like some say, \\"He's spoiled\\". How do the hell do they know?  I think he's very talented and has a great future.
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|Great take on a zombie movie. Would watch again. Hubby even loved it. Better than those zombie movies that are B movie which run on the same premise. Give viewers a different perspective
B008LSAP9Y|5.0|A great classic beautifully restored. It was like watching it for the first time. give us more! ITS ALIVE ITS ALIVE
B000W8HC8I|5.0|Almost finished reading it, but what I can tell you so far is that if your read between the lines, the sales strategies and mindsets presented are really great.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I am late jumping on the Dead train but it is an incredible series!!! Love it and can't wait for more!!!
B00DIFARQ6|5.0|other then that its a great game there's only one draw back it only gives you a few times to do it before you have to buy the whole game other then that its a really good game so if you get a bigger kick out of this game then I did you might want to get ready to spend money to buy it cause it only has 3 landings to complete before you need to buy it

B002G1K82Q|5.0|Loved the music.  Transcends the time.  Was not spectacular acting but the storyline was great.  Overall would watch and recommend for others
B00AEK9BKQ|5.0|This was a difficult subject to approach but the writers did a wonderful job, as did the director. Hawkes and Hunt were fantastic.  They all treated this movie with a delicate hand and turned it into a classic.  It was very, very moving.  I recommend it heartily.
630542845X|5.0|I have always loved this movie. I am glad to have it on DVD.<br />Great cast Mary, Sean, and Jeff.
B007Q35PLI|5.0|As a fan of Dr Grandin I watched this movie with a different eye than many people. I can attest to two things, it's not entirely accurate in some of the events it portrays, but that's not a bad thing. This movie does a GREAT job (better than most) condensing some events to give the viewer an idea what she went through as an autistic girl and young adult. It seemed to me that her life was just beginning when the movie ended. When she spoke her last line, I honestly teared up.<br /><br />And, the second thing, this lady is an amazing woman and had overcome huge obstacles: real, imagined, social, prejudicial, mean-spirited and this movie will give you a taste of how she overcame the world's speed bumps. I could not recommend this movie more highly. I hope someone makes a sequel. If you have a chance to hear her speak, meet her, take a class, whatever -- run to it. You'll be richly blessed.

B003FC6WBQ|5.0|GREAT story!  Loved the diversity of the characters, ages, personalities - and yet importance in the final outcome.  This is a great message about WHAT REAL LOVE IS, WHAT REAL LOVE DOES - even when it's uncomfortable, hard, even when the other person is &#34;unlovable&#34;.  SURPRISE ending  . . . . . .

B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Mr. Aslan has done the impossible.  Through careful research and a natural gift for storytelling, he's offered us a look not only of who Jesus actually might have been, but also at the reasons why he might have been this way.  We see the world during his life, and even before his birth, for what it was:  a brutal reality of Roman rule that inspired the zeal of many messiahs and a great deal of long-simmering rage.<br /><br />Having done research for my own work and my own writing, I was impressed at how much more I learned, the different Emperors coming to light, the failings and foibles of the various High Priests exposed, and even the outrageous courage of the Sicarii, the dagger-wielding Jews who came this close to beating the Empire in the decades after Jesus' death.<br /><br />If you have a sincere interest in history and appreciate someone who can blend it all together into a great story, &#34;Zealot:  The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth&#34; is for you.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|This is very funny season.  Specially because it accomplishes a lot.  The guys are always funny and the plot keeps you entertained. besides laughing all the time

B00AFOS6P2|4.0|I first listened to Reach For The Sky waiting for one of Cave's Murder Ballad sonic assaults, and when one didn't come I was disappointed. But I didn't realize that several great songs had gone right past me. Two in particular, Jubilee Street (watch their live performance of it at Glastonbury) and Mermaids really stand out. Cave's first #1 record in Australia, well deserved.

0399159347|5.0|I read a lot of books, and I don't often suggest them to my friends. This is one book that I cannot keep a secret!<br /><br />I'll be honest- it started a little slow, for my liking, but I could sense the book was going to be amazing. How do I know? Because Liane Moriarty is one of the most sophisticated, creative, and witty writers, I have ever read. Her wording, her character development, and her wit is addictive.<br /><br />So many characters, who don't seem like they should be connected-- are connected and in the most devastatingly amazing way. I won't give away too much, about the plot, but if you're a fan of suspense, learning secrets, and of the sanctity of marriage-- you will adore this book.<br /><br />Sometimes you only THINK you know everything about your spouse, but what if you happen to find an envelope, filled with his secrets, that you weren't really meant to read? Read this novel, to find out more!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This was a wonderful read.  You could feel the different emotions each character felt.  It was a book you did not want to put down. It makes you think about life.
0345529057|5.0|I mean, really. I don't even know what else to say. The book is amazing and is a great great great story in itself. I'm not reading ahead of the show but man is the trip from another perspective awesome!
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I haven't finished watching the whole season. I cant afford to buy the rest of season 3 so we are waiting for it to come out on disc.

068484267X|1.0|Jeez, I had hoped at the end, at least, we would have had some good news about McCourt going to America and becoming a success - but no, just ended on the same depressing level the whole book expressed.
B00BI4BA4C|4.0|I'm not going to waste anyone's time by reviewing in depth (check out Mark Barry's review for the nuts and bolts) something that's already been covered.  But this 3 CD/1 DVD set, now at a lower price (much less than the 28 pounds--around $35.00 or so U.S.--Mark Barry lists in his 2012 review), is well worth purchasing if you're into stripped down, basic r'n'r/blues/r&b, played  with straightforward unadorned intensity.  The booklet has an essay by Wilko Johnson that's worthwhile reading, plus recording information, original album covers, and a number of photos of the band.  Everything has been remastered in 2012, except \\"Down By The Jetty\\", which was remastered for the Deluxe Edition in 2006.  I gave this 4 \\"stars\\", but sometimes when listening to this music, I'm thinking it's worth 5 \\"stars\\" because during this period they were a hard working band that stuck to what they did best, with no pretense to greatness or anything else.<br /><br />The band (through the years 1974-77 included in this set) consists of Lee Brilleaux-vocals/harp/slide guitar, Wilko Johnson-lead guitar/vocals, John B. Sparks-bass, and The Big Figure-drums/vocals.  Together they blast out their music with an almost unrelenting edge, honed from almost non-stop live work.<br /><br />The band's first album, \\"Down By The Jetty\\" (also in a 2 CD Deluxe Edition that's great), set the tone for everything after it.  The mono sound of that album is clean yet punchy for an authentic early mono-style sound that could leave you breathless.  Johnson's guitar was smoking hot from the start, and Brilleaux's vocals and harp work are authentically visceral, while the rhythm section lays down an unrelenting groove no matter the tempo.  But if you're looking for long (or longish) guitar solos, this isn't the band.  Johnson's solos are short, sharp and pretty much stick to the melody of the song.  His visceral riffage is from the \\"rock'n'roll\\" school of staying close to the song, rather than the later \\"rock\\" school when guitarists went off on tangents--sometimes for better, sometimes for worse.<br /><br />Included are all the band's studio and live albums from the above years, plus a disc of unreleased tracks that are far from cast-offs.  But to get a good idea of what this band was all about, listen to the live album \\"Stupidity\\".  Whoa.  Track after track of in-your-face originals and covers.  This brings to mind the live set \\"BBC Sessions 1973-1978\\"--another smokin' set with the original band and 8 tracks with replacement guitarist Gypie Mayo.  The DVD is another real plus, with some great performances from the band.<br /><br />Dr. Feelgood never caught on in the U.S., while in England they're revered as the ultimate hard playing, tough sounding working band they were.  I've been a fan since I stumbled across a couple of their albums in my favorite record store, in what used to be called the \\"import\\" section back in the vinyl album days all those years ago.  This CD set, when originally issued, was relatively expensive.  But now at this low price no one who likes tough, no-frills r'n'r/blues/r&b has an excuse to pass this by.  Nothing fancy--just great music played with raw intensity.  Check it out.<br /><br />And if you really catch the \\"Feelgood bug\\", look into \\"Singled Out U.A./Liberty A's & B's & Rarities\\", 1 disc of A sides, 1 of B sides, and a third disc of rare tracks and \\"extras\\" (including a 2000 live acoustic set for the BBC)--most of it pretty cool too--all with various incarnations of the band.  And on that note, remember that the 2 CD set \\"The Complete Stiff Recordings\\" features lone original member Lee Brilleaux with a different band--tread carefully--the description leads you to believe that it's the original band.  I also have to mention another adrenaline-pumping band and that's The Pirates, with the awesome Mick Green (who appears on Disc 3 with Johnson)  on guitar.  Check out their BBC stuff (\\"Shakin' at the Beeb BBC Sessions 1976-1978\\"), a 2 CD  set of thetrio (without Johnny Kidd) laying down some loud, fast r'n'r/rockabilly/r&b.  With titles like \\"Shakin' All Over\\", \\"Milk Cow Blues\\", \\"Put You Cat Clothes On\\", \\"Drinkin' Wine Spo-Dee-O-Dee\\", and a slew of other great songs--they don't mess around.trio (without Johnny Kidd) laying down some loud, fast r'n'r/rockabilly/r&b.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|I liked it because all the other horse games are the ones with bad graphics and if they don't have bad graphics they cost money
B00EIL7IKW|3.0|(Warning: spoilers ahead)<br /><br />In years to come-True Blood fans may look back on the scene from episode 9 where all the vampires are dancing and holding hands like a bunch of idiot as the PRECISE moment when True Blood jumped the shark.  Now I'm not saying season 6 is all bad or even terrible.  It's still True Blood so it's still entertaining.  In some ways, I even thought it was an improvement over the disappointing season 5.  The problem however seems to be two-fold:<br /><br />1) This season lacked the feel of a \\"real\\" True Blood season.  It almost felt like a \\"side season\\" or something not quite a part of the actual series but still related (sort of like Battlestar Gallactica one-offs like \\"The Plan\\" and \\"Blood and Chrome\\").  It just felt sort of empty and insignificant with no big threat or real enemy to fight.  The big-bad this season looked like it was going to be Warlow.  In the end however Warlow just came across as a chump, died like a chump and never really added much of anything to the story arch except for giving Sookie something and some ONE to do.  The governor-another possible central threat likewise seemed unimportant and added nothing to the bigger picture.  And what about Billith?  Sookie was right on the nose when she said, \\"you're not a god Bill, you're just an a** hole.\\"  So really, out of three possible threats-there wasn't really much of any threat or any kind of real substance to keep the viewer interested.<br /><br />2) This season was all over the place and I mean REALLY all over the place.  Many of the characters we know and love seemed to do completely irrational things or they just became more and more unlikeable as the season went on.  Eric was particularly nasty in the beginning, Bill was pretty much a dirt bag throughout even when he wasn't being Billith and even Alcide-who seems like one of the most morally grounded characters on the show became more and more unlikeable by the time the season ended.  Also-the story seemed to change on a whim without any true direction as to where they were taking it.  For those of you who watched this season-look back and try to describe it.  You can pretty sum it all up in a sentence or two.  \\"So yeah, the government decides to capture vampires to study and torture them then there's this Warlow guy who may or may not be a bad guy that Sookie jumps all over even though she's been giving Alcide the cold shoulder for years, oh and Bill is a god-somehow that factors into things, though I don't really see how....\\"<br /><br />Don't get me wrong.  This season was still entertaining and I still enjoyed watching it, but it just feels like if they don't start to right the ship a bit, True Blood could become the next show to fizzle out creatively and make us wish for it to end.  Please, writers-get this show back on track.  I miss the quality of the first four seasons.<br /><br />PS: Writers- please also kill off Bill.  Pretty pretty please.  His character has run its course, and he's been a  d**che bag for about three or four seasons now.

B005LAIHXQ|1.0|This film is nothing more than a rip off of aliens vs predator and the 1st x-files movie !<br />In aliens vs predator, there's an expedition led by a woman to a far off place - antartica. It's financed by a billionaire called weyland who's dying. Once there they discover that the ancient gods people worshiped are actually aliens - predators. Weyland comes face to face with one of them and it kills him.<br />Now let's look at prometheus. There's an expedition led by a woman to a far off place - another planet. It's financed by a billionaire called weyland who's dying. Once there they discover that the ancient god's people worshiped are actually aliens - the engineers. Weyland comes face with one of them and it kills him.<br />Does any of this sound familiar ?<br />In the x-files movie there's a black alien goo that takes people over and physically changes them - just like in prometheus. At the end of the x-files movie, the heroine is running across a fractured surface, trying to outrace a big alien spaceship that's coming up from the ground beneath her - just like in prometheus !<br />What's worse than all of this is that prometheus doesn't even match up with Alien itself. In that movie the space jockey/engineer is found dead in that big chair onboard the alien ship. In prometheus he's killed in a completely different location ! Also in Alien when the nostromo lands on the planet how come they don't find any of the wreckage of the prometheus that fell all over the place after it crashed into the alien ship ?<br />The fault isn't with Ridley Scott but the lousy writer's. Let's hope Ridley can do better if he ever gets around to making the Blade Runner sequel.

B001GKJ2DY|1.0|What a brilliant way to murder a whole bunch of Abba songs !<br />Have Meryl Streep run around like a geriatric childrens tv presenter throughout, whilst having Julie Walters look like a butch out-of-shape body builder on steroids. Then have Pierce Brosnan both look and sound like he's in terrible agony everytime he tries to sing !<br />What is even more absurd is how everyone talks about this turkey being 'great family entertainment', when it's all about a girl who's mother is such a whore that she had sex with a whole bunch of men around the same time and who doesn't know who her daughter's father is as a result !<br />Oh yeah, a great one for the kids this !<br />Absolutely appalling all around - it's only good quality is that it ends !<br />In the words of Marlon Brando at the end of Apocalypse Now - &#34;the horror, the horror !&#34;

B008UX8G5A|5.0|I finished reading Hillary Mantel's books and wanted to know more about Henry VIII. I read the reviews on Amazon before deciding on this book and I'm glad I did because this is a well researched, easy to read book. Alison Weir makes writing history look effortless which means she spent untold hours editing. There is nothing so wonderful as a well edited book. The sentences roll along one after another, making complete sense and reading almost like a novel instead of history. If you want to know a lot about Henry and the Tudor era, this is a fabulous book. I would recommend it to anyone -- even young adult readers -- it is that easy to access and a very interesting. Alison Weir -- you did a very good job on this. Thanks for writing it. Laurie S.
