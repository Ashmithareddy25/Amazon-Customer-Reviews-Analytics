B0091Q82L8|4.0|'Live at Hull 1970' documents The Who's performance from the night after the 'Live at Leeds' show, and as such it may be somewhat redundant for anyone who already owns the legendary Leeds set in full. The Who were not a band whose performances varied much from show to show, as can be heard on this recording. In fact, Entwistle's bass on the first four songs here are taken directly from the night before's performance--due to the fact that it wasn't captured on the original soundboard recording--evidence of the extreme similarity between the two nights.<br /><br />Still, for the hardcore Who fan, this is a high-quality, \\"warts-and-all\\" release that shows the band at the peak of their powers, with an energy and vigor that few bands at the time, or any time, could match. Keith Moon is an absolute maniac here, pummeling his drums seemingly into splinters--the periodic crackle you'll notice is Moon repeatedly hitting his overhead mic by accident. In some ways, Keith's performance here is even more impressive than on 'Leeds' (or 'Isle of Wight' from later in the year), and that alone warrants a purchase for fans of his. Townshend's peerless rhythm guitar wizardry, Entwistle's precision bass, and Daltrey's acrobatic vocals hold their own as well, refusing to be buried beneath Moon's insane bombastic clangor.<br /><br />Like 'Leeds,' 'Live at Hull' showcases the band performing 'Tommy' in it's entirety, and the rest of the concert is identical as well (with nearly identical renditions of the songs), with one exception. Rather than the (amazing) first-set encore of \\"Magic Bus,\\" the set closer here is a 15-plus minute, ultra-jammed-out version of \\"My Generation\\" that not only is more powerful than the Leeds version, imo, it's without question the best, most visceral I've heard, and yet another reason to own this set.<br /><br />'Live at Hull,' while not absolutely essential for the casual Who fan, is definitely recommended for the more serious fan--especially those of Keith Moon--and for those who only own the one-disc version of 'Leeds,' as there are enough differences between the two to warrant a purchase, although the sound quality, while still very good, is not quite on the same level as 'Leeds' or 'Isle of Wight.' Still, it's nearly two hours of one of rock's most important, most influential bands performing their rock opera masterpiece impeccably, with an energy that's rarely been topped throughout the history of rock. And that's reason enough to own this two-disc set in my book.

B0095R76EW|1.0|This has got to be one of the worst movies I have ever had the misfortune of watching.  I still can't believe I watched the entire thing.  I guess I kept hoping it would get better but......no such luck!  I would suggest saving your money and make another selection.  UGH!!

B0000D96NW|5.0|Machine Head is a true to the heart heavy metal band, no questions asked.  This is definitely their best album they've made to date.  I heard this not long after it came out.  \\"Imperium\\" being the first song of theirs I ever heard, I heard it on the \\"Headbangers Ball\\" compilation to be completely honest lol.  I have been a huge fan ever since.  This albums defines who they are musically, even though I do love their direction in \\"Unto The Locust\\".  Any metal fan that says Machine Head sucks, is not a true heavy metal fan.

0765316978|5.0|\\"The Last Colony\\" returns to John Perry and Jane Sagan, retired from the military, as they colonize a new world.<br /><br />The book is about secrets and peace.  Readers of the first two books will know that secrets abound among the Colonial Union.  However, in the first two books, the secrets were largely incidental.  Yes, they played a major role in the plot, but the protagonists were happy to live their lives without confronting the secrets, so they weren't a big part of the story.<br /><br />\\"The Last Colony\\" gives secrets a front seat.  Pretty much every major event in the book comes as the result of a secret or its revelation.  Characters debate about the ethics of keeping secrets.  Sometimes they fall on the side of keeping secrets, sometimes on the side of revealing secrets, and sometimes on the side of allowing better choices even without full information.  As a result, there is a rich discourse on honesty and its discontents.  A side effect of this is that there are tons of exciting plot twists in the book, and all of them feel natural and well integrated into the story.<br /><br />The theme of peace comes about through a larger debate on that one big secret that you learn about at the end of \\"Ghost Brigades.\\"  When a group is trying to push for peace, how can people tell that they're genuine and equitable?  Where do a person's loyalties lie: with their country or their conscience?  Is there such a thing as a just war?  What about a just enforcement mechanism for peace?  Where is the room for idealism in a harsh universe?  John Perry, as an antiwar soldier who dislikes groups that threaten humanity and who dislikes warlike and secret elements of humanity, brings these questions to the forefront.<br /><br />One thing that I liked a lot about \\"Old Man's War\\" and \\"Ghost Brigades\\" was that they felt finished after the end.  To be sure, there were lots of things to come in future books and a lot left unsaid, but the significant events of the book felt concluded.  In \\"The Last Colony,\\" there is one very salient issue that comes up a few times throughout the book that is never satisfactorily addressed.  Perry event talks with another character, and that character says that they haven't given the issue much thought, but then they don't give the issue more thought later on.  I could accept that if I felt like it would be addressed in a future book, but since \\"The Last Colony\\" finished things up, it just feels like a loose end.<br /><br />That said, the ending was superb.  The series is nicely framed, I feel good about the state of the universe, and the goodness doesn't feel like an artificial Hollywood ending..

B007R3AZNK|3.0|I'm a huge JB fan and have most of his albums. This will sadly be my last. Looking at the tracks with Audacity, they are heavily compressed. This would sound so much better if they had left in the dynamic range. I know this \\"loudness wars\\" thing is going on but I like clean and clear music. So I'll be searching for an artist that still values the quality of the music.

B0083SBJXS|5.0|This stellar action/adventure/fantasy film has it all, a solid story, colorful characters, humor, action, and a roller coaster ride of emotions.  I was transported to this world and enjoyed it.  The best characters are Iron Man and Dr. Banner.  The banter between them is deep and very entertaining. Loki is a great villain but needed more screen time.  Overall, this is a fun film!
B009JNX1CS|5.0|This is a great movie , out of all the super hero movies to date I have to say that the Avengers is top notch entertainment for all . Buy this movie you won't be disappointed .
B0087ITC9C|3.0|The funny thing about the cinematic experience sometimes is that, for all that moviegoers seem to want more \\"realism\\" on the big screen (e.g. the dark, gritty, \\"Dark Knight\\" series, a movie completely steeped in reality falls a bit short.  Why?  Because, generally speaking, we go to the cinema to ESCAPE our own realities, not get sucked up in them once again.  Thus, for all the good things that \\"Flight\\" accomplishes, it is just too \\"grounded\\" to ever real produce the kind of emotional response needed to make it truly great.<br /><br />For a basic plot summary (containing some minor spoilers), \\"Flight\\" sees pilot Whip Whitaker (Denzel Washington) perform an incredible feat of flying by landing a large commercial airliner that is literally falling apart around him.  The only problem?  Mr. Whitaker is an alcoholic who also uses cocaine to \\"rev himself back up\\" and continue flying.  When both substances are found on his toxicology report after the crash, Whip embarks on a personal journey that ultimately ends with him confronting his own personal demons.<br /><br />There are some things that this film does very well.  The direction from Robert Zemeckis is sound, Denzel turns in a great performance, and the airplane sequences are absolutely captivating.  The plot and auxiliary characters are also just good enough to make it a solid effort despite my biggest critique:<br /><br />I have never viewed a film so down-to-earth and utterly devoid of an ounce of contrived drama.  Usually that is a good thing (as so many films go the opposite route), but in this case it just makes for a flick that doesn't really arouse any deep emotions or feelings towards the on-screen proceedings.  Every step of Whip's journey is laid out for us, there are no surprises, and even the moments that could have been filled with drama are instead a bit anti-climactic because they have already been explained to us.<br /><br />Overall, then, I can't rank \\"Flight\\" as anything significantly better than average.  It is a good role for Denzel, but other than that it just fails to capture any emotion enough to be a huge success.verage.

B008MM9630|4.0|this game will definitely reel you in and keep you there. But you can only go so far before you are pushed towards needing to use your credit card for more gems. They will overprice the animals and trees and certain items to get you to buy them. they have to make money too you know. Most of us wont lean towards it, and that's fine if you don't. personally, I don't even have the money to buy gems, so after a certain amount of levels, ( I got to 26) you kind of get stuck. I give this game four stars. Good luck to you if you get this game!
0446580848|3.0|As a long-time fan of DeMille, and as a bookseller who's pointed many many people his way, I was really looking forward to The Panther.<br />My husband won the coin flip and got it first, and it took him almost a week to finish it.  Odd for a guy who reads Extremely Fast.  He didn't give me any hints after finishing it, even more odd from a guy who shares John Corey's snarky attitude.<br />I soon realized why.  This book was a slow, unrelenting homage to John Corey's mostly not-that-funny interior dialogue that DeMille inflicted on us.<br />I won't go into any great descriptions here, others have done better than i can.  I'll just say John Corey has come very close to jumping the shark for me.
0525958002|4.0|I am a Duran Duran fanatic; do remember allot of what was going on during that particular year since 1982; Have read Andy Taylors book... just now finished reading John Taylor's book.  He does talk allot about some particular situation that occurred during that time/place, but doesn't describe them in certain detail.  Although he admits to taking all kinds of drugs, what it did for him, how much he did it and with whom!  He's pretty open about certain people in his life wether he liked them or hated them. Talked allot about his women admitting to sleeping around allot, not wanting to be in a certain place during his days with Duran Duran.  On a soft side, he talked in detail about the special women in his life; his relationship with his parents and GOD!?  He does mention why Andy left Duran back in 1986, but doesn't describe why he left the group again in 2007.  Just pretty much say 'musical differences', but not in detail as to what did really happened.  Andy Taylors book only reveal about a VISA not being renewed and it had nothing to do with the band.  I like the short chapters, pictures and recommend this book if you grew up listening and knowing/appreciating DURAN DURAN members.

B008S80OU2|5.0|This will be the final chapter for BOC on Sony.  And we get the remasters for the albums from 1979-1988, they all sound tremendous on my stereo, all sound 100% better.  But the calling card is the Rarities disc, plenty of live material from the Mirrors tour, \\"Summa Cum Laude\\", an unreleased tune from the soundtrack \\"Teachers\\" and The Beatles \\"I Want You\\", live.  Best Of Broadcasts, gives us even more great live BOC from the OLD Waldorf in San Francisco in 1980 \\"Lips In The Hills\\", the 81/2 minute \\"Black Blade\\", \\"5 Guitars Golden Age Of Leather\\", \\"Wings Of Mercury\\" .  They also cover The Rolling Stones \\"It's Not Easy\\".  \\"Joan Crawford\\", from ABC's A Night On The Road (1981) and a 1986 King Biscuit Flower Hour \\"Take Me Away\\".  So every  Blue Oyster Cult fan out there get this box set!  You also get a 40 page booklet from Lenny Kaye.  At $6 a disc, this is worth every penny!<br /><br />Update:  Allen Lanier passed away August 14th,2013, 67 years old.  A great musician and a nice guy, R.I.P. Allen.

B008O69SZ0|5.0|Ian Hunter, point man for one of the greatest Rock 'n Roll circus acts ever, is reborn at the young age of 73. Reborn for me anyway. I didn't realize Hunter was still this good and prolific and relevant. I dig this so much because it rocks with insight, wisdom and humor. This is feel good music. I love every song on this album but my favorites are \\"Fatally Flawed\\" and the humorous \\"Wild Bunch\\"( the great Peckinpah western). \\"Just the Way You Look tonight\\" is the story of his feelings for life and love, really hits home for me. They're all good......The song, \\"When I'm President\\" is funny as hell and leaves no doubt while it rocks the house. I have a special affinity for \\"Ta Shunka Witco..Crazy Horse\\". The primitive man against the cruel onslaught of civilization and \\"progress\\".<br /><br />Mott the Hoople created two of the most powerful rock albums ever, Brain Capers and Mott. I still listen to these recordings, a lot, even after more than forty years later. Ian Hunter was the main reason. His solo work shortly after Mott disbanded was very good as well. Great musicians here backing up his weathered but still powerful rock voice. The Rant Band has got to be one of the best units out there right now, amazing musicians! I love to crank this up on the road...it makes me feel alive..The last song on the album, \\"Life\\" was a perfect way to end this, written by a man that's been through the wars of life and kept his humanity and sense of humor. He's still the outsider, the misfit....the rebel, the romantic and a great rock artist. The way he ends this last song says so much about his character and his life.....He's enjoyed his life, wishes the best for everyone, laugh at the stupid stuff and he Never Surrendered......<br /><br />These songs, are real rock and roll.........Good work Ian!

With this information it is then easier to translate practice experience to my real rounds of golf.

Some characters have such a short story life and yet they've made an impression on you.  It's disconcerting, and maybe purposefully so, to have characters to whom you can relate and empathize and suddenly they're gone, which really adds to the feel of the story and the ant hill-like lives.<br /><br />Hugh Howey has created a unique story with engaging characters interwoven with just enough introspection and a nice balance of suspense.<br /><br />I also appreciated the editing done well beyond the norm for Amazon.<br /><br />I am really looking forward to reading more from Mr. Howey.
B007SGM084|4.0|to be honest I started reading because it was amusing, I felt like the hype was really really silly, and the writing to be honest is really really not worth praise: that said. I was shocked that despite the fact the erotica was sub par that the story (excluding the first book) started shocking me: the author managed to take an unpredictable turn and I found myself further engrossed in the story, and I woke up a day later two books in I have to give her a hats off on that I went in for comedic gold and was ticked into enjoying the story. So as a warning if you approach this as a critic looking for an easy way to make fun of it you'll be surprised  like me I suspect. Hats off  E.L. James
B0052QXAEK|4.0|This story is familiar, and I would have thought &#34;done to death&#34;, but there are quirky parts of this retelling that are worth watching. The actors, all of them, are engaging and interesting, the pace is fast, and at times  the script is funny.  The only problem I had was believing Neil Patrick Harris as a blind tutor.  Mary-Kate Olsen steals every scene she's in, she's just that good.  This was a rental and I was pleased with the speed of uploading, the quality of the video/ audio and the playback options (so the technical side would get 5 stars ).
0451209338|4.0|This is my first Daniel Silva's book. I came to knew about Daniel Silva's books while searching for fiction books involving Mossad.<br /><br />Gabriel Allon, the protagonist, is a retired Mossad agent working as a high profile painting restorer. Ari Shamrom is Gabriel's boss. Ari convinces Gabriel to come back from retirement and help in catching a terrorist named Tariq, who is planning a terrorist attach against Israel. Gabriel assassinated Tariq's brother, a terrorist, in the past, and Tariq avenged his brothers death by bombing Gabriel's family, killing Gabriel's son and severely injuring Gabriel's wife Leah. Gabriel and Tariq wants to kill each other for personal and professional reasons.<br /><br />The book is very interesting and gives a lot of details of the internal working of Spies and details on Israel and Palestine relationship. I loved this book because of the content and the way it is written. It is a fast read and entertaining. I like Daniel Silva's book. I have already started reading another Daniel Silva's book - The Fallen Angel - and plan to read more of his books. I recommend this book and give it a 4 star. Happy reading.

B0072OFM28|1.0|I could not believe that they cast Liam McIntyre as Spartacus. The producers have lost a loyal viewer and I really wanted them to find someone to fill the first Spartacus's shoes. In my opinion, they simply looked for someone that resembled Andy Whitfield. I don't think Mcintyre was able to carry the role physically and as an actor, and I felt he was upstaged by his costars. Its unfortunate that the talent pool was so limited that this was the guy they chose. :( dont buy the season.

B0083GQ2A0|1.0|Unless you want to create a world where genetically altered wolves are attacking and killing humans, then this film might get two stars from me. I'd give it zero stars for the absurd premise and insane idea that wolves hunt and kill humans.    Note to director dude: You should at least research basic animal behavior before creating such a travesty about wolves. Inaccurate, untruthful fantasy. DIf you want to create fantasy then give the wolves some kind of super power, some genetically altered disease. It would then be somewhat believable.    For suspension of disbelief, needed for any film, this one doesn't have it. There is only one good scene in this movie and that is when the first character dies with the guidance of Liam Neeson.    This hungry pack of wolves in the Arctic are fat and plump and kill humans at their whim. In fact for some strange reason, this pack has the leisure time in the depth of winter to forgo their own survival need of searching for food, carrying for their young to marshal hundreds of wolves, it seems, to track, terrorize and kill the humans.    As improbably as that is, there is more. These wolves are the fattest, plumpest wolves on earth, meaty as if they dinned at Claim Jumper take out for lunch and dinner each day.    As fat as these improbably wolves are, there's more. They are bent on killing human, going out of their way to do it.    But, the fact is, there isn't a single confirmed death by a wolf or wolf pack ever. By rabis, yes, but never by a pack of wolves, and never in the manner depicted in this move. At most wolves might get assertive when cornered or when defending a kill. But hunting down and killing 7 humans. Uhhhh. NOOO.    Wikipedia: A wolf attack is an attack on a human by a wolf or wolves. Wild wolves are generally timid around humans. Wolves usually try to avoid contact with people, to the point of even abandoning their kills when an approaching human is detected, but there are several reported circumstances in whichwolves have been recorded to act aggressively toward humans.    Compared to other carnivorous mammals known to attack humans in general, the frequency with which wolves have been recorded to kill or prey on people is much lower, indicating that though potentially dangerous, wolves are among the least threatening for their size and predatory potential.[1]    [...]
B007G92QGO|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read, but then again, it might just be because I'm a lawyer.  The story is told incredibly well and, in the end, you sit there, a little shocked, definitely saddened and extremely conflicted ... Great book.

B0053O89WY|5.0|I have all four previous seasons so there was incentive for me to purchase this at the Amazon price.  I also enjoy the blooper reel and other additional features in this set.  I once studied physics, physicists, and other academics.  I see in the show a lot of similarities (with some exaggeration) to my personal experience.  Well done.
B00A1ZW1JC|5.0|This episode was the hardest, most emotional to watch in the walking dead series. Zombies come in droves and terrorize the group almost to near death. But the hardest thing to see was Tdog and Lori dying. Tdog sacrificed his life to save carol and if that wasnt enough Lori dies giving birth. This felt like a season finale but its ONLY episode 4 of season 3. You will shed a tear or two at the end of this episode.

B008JFUUIA|3.0|I see so many movies every month I couldn't possibly write a review for every single one. When I get around to putting pen to paper, I have to think if I have anything to say about a film and then decide which to write about. Oddly, every time I think about writing reviews for the current crop of films, I forget that I have seen \\"Pitch Perfect\\", the new film starring Anna Kendrick (\\"Twilight\\", \\"Up in the Air\\") as the newest member of an all-female college acapela club.<br /><br />I'm not sure why that is. \\"Pitch\\" is a perfectly enjoyable way to spend a few hours. A lot of it works, there are many laughs, some of the music is very good. But I think that for almost every good thing, there is an equally noticeable problem.<br /><br />Kendrick, ready to break free from brooding vampires, headlines as Beca, a brooding freshman attending Borden University. She is going to college because her dad is a professor there and insists she give it a try before heading to Los Angeles to make it big as a DJ peddling her mash-ups. She soon discovers the Borden Bellas, an all-female acapela group fighting their way back to Nationals after a disastrous performance the previous year. Beca joins the group and pushes her mash-ups; she is all about trying something new, something different.<br />The new head of the group, Aubrey (Anna Camp, TV's \\"The Good Wife\\", \\"Mad Men\\", \\"The Help\\") wants to maintain the group's traditional ways and songs. Her right hand, Chloe (Brittany Snow, \\"Hairspray (2007)\\", TV's \\"Harry's Law\\") is more on the fence, but gives in to her friend's pressure to remain tried and true.<br /><br />Because of the Bella's recent performance and graduating seniors, they have to start from scratch and bring in an entirely new team. They find a black lesbian, a promiscuous girl, a shy, demure Asian girl, a couple of less distinctive and less interesting girls and Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson, \\"Bridesmaids\\"). In other words, they find characters defined by a single characteristic, making them stereotypes. With one exception.<br /><br />Rebel Wilson is a stand-out as the self-proclaimed Fat Amy. Her jokes and funny bits zig zag back and forth between self-deprecating humor and jokes others make about her. You can tell the jokes made by others sting a little, but she is also used to them, aware of them, and has learned to recover from them very quickly. And her self-deprecating humor is a form of armor, protection from the mean-spiritedness of others.<br /><br />The Bella's rivals, an all-male acapela group, are currently number #1. They do modern stuff and never repeat a song, leading them to enjoy a lot of success. Jesse (Skylar Astin) and Benji (Ben Platt), two roommates and new students, both want to join, but Jesse is chosen. He also has eyes for Beca.<br /><br />You can probably connect many of the dots and guess many of the jokes.<br /><br />Elizabeth Banks, one of the film's producers, appears with John Michael Higgins (TV's \\"Happily Divorced\\", \\"Best in Show\\", \\"The Ugly Truth\\") as the television hosts of the Nationals. These roles are pretty much the exact role Higgins has played many times before, in \\"Best of Show\\", \\"For Your Consideration\\", usually with Jane Lynch in a film written and directed by Christopher Guest. It was a funny bit the first time, but each time it is repeated it becomes less interesting and even a little annoying. Now, it just appears tired and recycled.<br /><br />This brings me to my big complaint about \\"Perfect\\". The filmmakers seem to reach the limit of their abilities after the few good things and fill in the blanks with recycled material. The bits with Higgins and Banks stand out like a sore thumb. And because she is one of the Producers, it seems like she could've, should've said \\"this seems very familiar. How can we take this somewhere new?\\" But she didn't and it just seems so similar. There should almost be a clich&eacute; named for these characters. The snarky co-hosts. Stanley Tucci and Toby Jones even did avariation on this bit, but with more sarcasm, in \\"The Hunger Games\\". The additional level of snarkiness makes it a fitting addition to the futuristic survival tale. It makes it a little more interesting and brings a slightly different slant to the rote idea.<br /><br />Also, there seem to be a lot of missed opportunities. Beca and Jesse both go to work at the college radio station, a story idea meant to force them to spend a lot of time together, forcing them to deal with their growing attraction. But the station is run by a hunky British DJ. (Freddie Stroma, the \\"Harry Potter\\" films) who doesn't really seem to serve any purpose what so ever. He doesn't even do the most clich&eacute;d thing imaginable and cause Jesse to become jealous.<br /><br />All of the supporting characters amount to little more than stereotypes. There is so much opportunity to explore a little more of these characters that it seems a shame everything is reduced to a simple one-liner. Very often, the one-liner is repeated.<br /><br />The music is quite good. Kendrick and her female counterparts seem ready to break out of their mold at any point, held back only by Aubrey's insistence on tradition. There are a number of occasions when they aren't competing, allowing Beca more leeway and she breaks out into a modern song. But every time they go to competition, it is the same old, same old. The male group, the more polished performers, more willing and able to take chances and perform new material, seem more modern and daring. Their songs also provide a nice counterpoint to the more formal, old-fashioned arrangements of the Bellas. You know the Bellas will eventually change their routing and when they do, the performance is pretty great.<br /><br />As good as the music is, it doesn't really do anything better than a good episode of \\"Glee\\". When the television show if firing on all cylinders, the musical performances are memorable, the characters explore real emotions and real problems, and this might provide some genuinely moving moments. Granted, this seems to be happening less frequently this season, but it does happen.<br /><br />Ultimately, \\"Pitch\\" doesn't separate itself enough from a good episode of \\"Glee\\" to make it worth spending $13 for a full-price ticket. Bargain matinee, sure.tion on this bit, but with more sarcasm, in \\"The Hunger Games\\". The additional level of snarkiness makes it a fitting addition to the futuristic survival tale.

B005LAII8A|4.0|Films involving the barest mention of time travel are usually problematic. Inevitably, a bunch of arm-chair critics will begin to debate all of the ways the time-travel doesn't and can't work, no doubt worrying about their congealing breakfast burrito in the process.<br /><br />\\"Looper\\", the new film starring Joseph Gordon - Levitt as Joe, a 'Looper' who kills the mob's enemies, seems to embrace all of the possible problems and work with them making them more real in the process.<br /><br />It's 2074 and time travel has now been banned. But the mob still uses this outlawed technology to send their enemies back from the future to 2074, into the hands of the Loopers who are waiting to execute them. Joe has one standing order; as soon as the victim appears, he is to shoot them and then collect his payment, silver bars attached to the hit's back. In this way, the mob essentially erases all traces of their future enemies. And Joe is well-aware that he will one day be expected to kill himself. When this happens, he can take the gold bars attached to his older self, and try to live a few years as well as possible. But he isn't looking forward to this day.<br /><br />When Old Joe (Bruce Willis) arrives, he catches his younger self by surprise and escapes. During the intervening years, Old Joe has learned a lot about Cid, the head of the mob. Now that he has been sent back to 2074, he wants to find the younger Cid and correct a lot of bad things before they happen by killing the future mob boss. But young Cid is an orphan, living with and cared for by Sara (Emily Blunt), who will do anything to protect him. Younger Joe is unaware of all of this. He just knows he has to find his older self and avoid the hit men sent by his boss, Abe (Jeff Daniels), the local mob boss.<br /><br />Written and directed by Rian Johnson (\\"Brick\\", \\"The Brothers' Bloom\\"), \\"Looper\\" is a well-made action/ sci-fi hybrid. Both of Johnson's earlier films were good, but flawed. With \\"Looper\\", he proves the adage 'third times the charm.'<br /><br />The sci-fi elements work because they are almost downplayed. Kansas City in 2074 doesn't look a lot different from what it probably looks like now. The cars are a little different, the streets are dirtier and filled with more homeless, the guns are a little different, but with the exception of the whole 'time travel' thing, not much seems to have changed. Because Johnson downplays the elements of the 'future', the future seems more real. Because everything seems more real, our inquisitive minds spend less time thinking about the science and looking for loopholes and we just sit back and enjoy the ride.<br /><br />Johnson uses an interesting, fairly uncommon narrative technique to get us involved in the story. We spend a significant amount of time with Joe (Gordon - Levitt), getting to know everything about the routines of his life. Then, when Old Joe (Willis) shows up, we spend some time flashing back to his life and what he has learned. After we catch up, the story continues and we start to follow them both. Most films would follow both leads, alternating back and forth, dividing our time and attention. It's a nice way for us to get familiar and comfortable with each before launching into a new phase with both.<br /><br />Gordon - Levitt is very good as Joe. You get the sense he doesn't really enjoy his job, but given the state of the World, his job allows him a comfort most people don't have. So he does his job willingly and well and turns to Suzie (Piper Perabo), a stripper, for solace and companionship. And he seems to sleepwalk through his life, going from one point to another without much joy or sense of accomplishment. But his survival depends on playing a game and doing whatever possible to keep his bosses happy. And he also knows he will eventually be faced with killing himself. This leads him to face everything with a mild case of skepticism. It is a nice way to add maturity to his character and give him depth.<br /><br />And the alternative is even worse, so he does what he is good at.<br /><br />Willis' Old Joe doesn't have a lot of dialogue and spends most of the film in action. This allows us to fill in some of the blanks as we watch the flashback illustrating his later life. It also allows us to learn with his character. Yes, he has already witnessed a lot, but when he returns to 2074, he learns new information and has to contend with himself as a younger, stronger, less mature man. He has to assimilate the new information before he makes a mistake. In these moments, we watch how he reacts, we watch as he learns and we learn with him.<br /><br />The flashback illustrating Joe's life from 2074 forward is particularly interesting and adds a lot to the overall story.<br /><br />Emily Blunt plays Suzie, a woman who cares for and tries to tame a young boy named Cid. She plays the role with such earnestness, you almost forget about the sci-fi universe she inhabits, even when 'sci-fi' things are happening. She has adopted this child, she is his mother, and she won't let anything happen to him.<br /><br />Jeff Daniels plays Abe, the local crime boss sent back from the future to keep an eye on things. It is a nice a-typical performance for the actor. He appears to be the same affable guy, but beneath all of the good-nature lives a very deep level of menace and danger. Every moment he appears on screen you feel he could snap at any point. When this pattern is established, we simply wait for the moment. This anticipation creates a high level of suspense.<br /><br />Paul Dano is also good as Seth, Joe's friend and a fellow Looper. His story provides a nice illustration of what happens to 'Loopers' when their time has come and helps us realize just how desperate Joe is to avoid the same fate.<br /><br />\\"Looper\\" is surprisingly good and very entertaining.r /><br />And the alternative is even worse, so he does what he is good at.<br /><br />Willis' Old Joe doesn't have a lot of dialogue and spends most of the film in action.

B006LSZECO|4.0|This is one of the best books I have read in the past year. I am not usually into thrillers but this was a great one. I kept sneaking up to my bedroom to read it (away from my husband) as from the first page I wanted to see what was going to happen next. I certainly would have criticisms of the book but it certainly made me think. And made me think about relationships, how they start, change and deteriorate. Parts were a little unbelievable and unnecessary. But overall it is great to have a book that makes you want to go to bed at 8:30pm.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|The first book was good, but if Ana was that naive she would have been hit by a truck a long time ago. As far as the other books? Really, could any man be able to have sex that many times in 1 day and not be exhausted. I was also disappointed that when there was actually some excitement to the plot (non sexual), the problem was all tied up in a pretty bow in a chapter. Don't get me wrong. It was fun to read.
B008G12ERC|4.0|I have been a Muse fan since the Origin of Symmetry days (before it was released in the USA). As a working musician myself, much of my love for the band is due to their stunning live performance aspect... not the visual effects, but the fact that a trio could make so much music, and so well, on any stage in any country.<br />The 2nd Law is filled with tracks influenced by many (many) genres. I enjoy listening to it, and there's nothing I particularly dislike about it, but it lacks the grit and angst of former Muse releases. It merely reinforces my belief that if one gets more comfortable as one grows older, the creative energy shifts. Still, the songs are well-crafted and well-executed, and worth the listen.

B008673ZAQ|1.0|The novel was redundant, and ultimately boring due to her over the top obsession. One half of the book was obsession, sans much plot.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Safe Haven was a great story! I didn't feel like I knew how the story was going to turn out, like many of Nicholas Sparks's books. It was an easy read that kept me wanting to read more and more. Great story!

6305603847|5.0|First of, the quality of the DVD was good. No skips or anything wrong with the audio. As far as the movie itself. You have to wonder how many kinds of drugs was in their system when the movie was written. Unfortunately, the plot does resemble what society was like at that time. It's not a family time movie, that's for sure.

0547564651|4.0|In this seminal book, Paul Tough suggests that for success in life, children need not so much an early start on cognitive skills as help managing their impulses and ability to focus.  To grasp how children succeed, we must look at the parent-child relationship, which is the crucible for much of a child's developmental trajectory.  It is also important to consider how kids acquire skills when they do, and how character is formed.<br /><br />Key obstacles can be adverse events in childhood--trauma and related stress, also problems with attachment and nurturance as it mitigates a child's experience of stress.  Researchers have created an \\"adversity score\\" that accurately predicts how well a child will cope in later life.<br /><br />IQ scores have been found to predict not success in college but rather scores on standardized tests.  Indeed, IQ scores have been found to change over time. Educators working with socioeconomically disadvantaged children have found that college performance is more accurately predicted by grade point average, which reflects not simply academic skills but also self-discipline, perseverance, and the ability to delay gratification--in short, character.<br /><br />(Tough notes parenthetically that affluence negative impacts character formation: \\"for a young person to build character [he must] attempt something where there is a serious possibility of failure\\" [p. 85]).<br /><br />By studying children who persist in college and receive a degree, and comparing them with peers who dropped out earlier in their academic careers, educators have identified character traits important for success.  One list includes grit, self-control, zest, social intelligence, gratitude, optimism, and curiosity.  Youngsters need a mindset that welcomes challenge more than approbation.<br /><br />The book is full of fascinating tidbits from recent research into the learning process.  Did you know, for example, about the confirmation bias?  Asked to guess the rule underlying a string of numbers, most people will err by picking a too-restrictive rule, producing examples that fit the rule rather than searching instead for an example that breaks the rule. \\"To win the game is to guess strings of numbers that would prove your beloved hypothesis wrong--and that is something each of us is constitutionally driven to avoid\\" (p. 139).<br /><br />Other nuggets.  The number of college dropouts is on the rise in part because of undermatching of students and institutions of learning.  Also, true masters of a sport or skill are pessimists, not optimists, in assessing the likely outcome of a particular strategy (the examples given involve chess).<br /><br />This book is perhaps most valuable for the insights it affords into parenting practices.  Parents need to nurture their youngsters primarily when the children are stressed.  Kids need the opportunity to overcome failure and to learn from it.  Tough describes a number of pioneering programs now yielding positive results, including therapy that teaches parenting skills to improve wellness and attachment and to develop executive function and self-regulation in children.<br /><br />This thoughtful, readable view of human development and our flawed American approach to public education is a welcome antidote to the national preoccupation with rote learning in children at ever younger ages.ng a string of numbers, most people will err by picking a too-restrictive rule, producing examples that fit the rule rather than searching instead for an example that breaks the rule. \\"To win the game is to guess strings of numbers that would prove your beloved hypothesis wrong--and that is something each of us is constitutionally driven to avoid\\" (p. 139).<br /><br />Other nuggets.

B0087ITC9C|4.0|***This review contains spoilers, but nothing that isn't shown in the trailer. If you want to go in knowing nothing, stop reading now.***<br /><br />Denzel Washington rarely disappoints, and his role in Flight is one of his most interesting performances in years. Unlike many of his roles, this one casts doubts about whether Washington's character is a hero or a villain.<br /><br />If you haven't seen any reviews of the film, you might think that Flight is going to feature a lot of action, but the action is over once we experience the crash sequence. This is very much a drama.<br /><br />The opening scenes show Captain Whip Whitaker (Washington) in bed with a flight attendant. He's been awake all night and he's drunk and high on cocaine. That's not exactly the best preparation for work when you are going to be entrusted with the lives of everyone on board a plane. Would you be happy if you knew that your pilot was in such a state?<br /><br />Whitaker feels the need for another drink before the plane takes off, and drinks vodka without anyone noticing. When he takes his seat next to the co-pilot, Ken, his behavior appears a little odd. Whitaker orders coffee and Aspirin and takes off as though nothing is wrong. Ken's suspicions heighten when Whitaker exceeds the recommended speed while climbing to escape bad weather.<br /><br />If you remember the crash in Cast Away, you'll know that Robert Zemeckis knows how to portray such an event effectively. In Flight, the crash is even more terrifying. If you are nervous about flying, this won't help you overcome it. The plane starts to fall apart at 30,000 feet, but Whitaker remains calm, although everyone else is panicking. In  one of the best scenes in the film, he takes the aircraft into a controlled roll and flies upside down to recover from an uncontrolled dive, before landing it in a field. Six of the 102 people on board are killed.<br /><br />That all happens during the first 30 minutes of the film. Whitaker is apparently a hero, and we later learn that what he did was something that other pilots were unable to duplicate in simulated tests. So why isn't that the end of the story?<br /><br />Someone has to be blamed for the crash.<br /><br />A parallel story shows Nicole (Kelly Reilly), who is addicted to drugs. She meets Whitaker in the corridor of a hospital, when both sneak out to smoke a cigarette. Addiction is a key theme in the film and the two develop a kind of bond, recognizing similar character traits in each other.<br /><br />The remainder of the story is a character study, and shows how Whitaker deals with life after the crash. Addictions to drugs and alcohol have affected some of the most important relationships in his life. We see him struggle to face that fact and the impact of the decisions he makes.<br /><br />Whitaker isn't completely free to confront his personal demons as he is being investigated to determine whether he was at fault during the crash. We see him prepare for a hearing, which is not a trial in court, but could lead to him being found responsible for the six deaths, and ultimately result in him serving a life sentence. His preparation is aided by Charlie (Bruce Greenwood), a former pilot and colleague, and Hugh (Don Cheadle), who is a lawyer. Both give strong performances in small supporting roles. The most colorful character in the film is Whitaker's friend, Harling Mays (John Goodman). If Goodman had played The Dude in The Big Lebowski, he would have looked something like this.<br /><br />Melissa Leo does a good job as Ellen Block, who leads the investigation into Whitaker's performance. Although I would like to talk about that sequence, I have already given away more than enough details about the plot.<br /><br />Flight contains elements that make it a little hard to categorize. It's certainly not an action movie, but the crash scene will have you on the edge of your seat. It's more about addiction and what drives people to do what they do.

B006YTYIXG|4.0|Soulfly's eighth full-length record, 2012's \\"Enslaved,\\" continues on the same angry, death-metal-influenced, riff-oriented road that frontman Max Cavalera and the Gang first started down on 2005's \\"Dark Ages.\\" But this album may very darn well be the strongest Soulfly recording of the past several years (it is their best effort since 2004's \\"Prophecy\\"). This is true because \\"Enslaved\\" is a very consistent, front-to-back listen, as even the weakest tracks on here pack in plenty of positively excellent riffs. And you will also, most likely, be treated to brutal drumming and vocals, as well. And, as was the case with the above-mentioned \\"Dark Ages,\\" and 2008's \\"Conquer\\" and 2010's \\"Omen,\\" \\"Enslaved\\" is a loosely-based concept album. The occasionally political lyrics -- see \\"Intervention\\" and \\"Treachery\\" for two examples -- add a deeper meaning to the songs, and convey a strong, convincing sense of nihilism, anarchy, and Armageddon.<br /><br />The set opens with \\"Resistance,\\" a forebodingly dark instrumental intro with a martial drum beat and ominous guitar noise. This flows perfectly into \\"World Scum,\\" which aside from a mid-tempo bass and drum intro, is a chaotic blitzkrieg. Grindcore-esque vocals -- including some monstrous guest bellows from Cattle Decapitation's Travis Ryan -- and grindcore-inspired, Dying Fetus-esque blast beats trade-off with Max's signature hardcore-shout. (The tune sneaks in some anthemic, \\"Chaos A.D.\\"-era Sepultura-like gang shouts of the title phrase.) And the next song, \\"Intervention,\\" might have a slow, doomy-flavored breakdown near the end, but it, too, is a blisteringly fast track. Here, great, pounding guitar and bass riffs (which thunder through the mix) give-way to ferocious, racing tremolo picking.<br /><br />\\"Gladiator\\" is a turbo-charged thrasher with double-kick-drum-backed buzzsaw riffage. A piercing, sweeping, technical melodic guitar solo and catchy, call-and-response vocal part also crop up later on in the song. \\"Legions\\" continues this frenetic pace, backing Eighties-era thrash-esque speedster picking with deft thrash beats, and topping it all off with some unorthodox, whammy-bar-drenched soloing. \\"American Steel\\" is another acrobatic guitar workout, one featuring massively crunching, machine-gun-fast riffing, some catchy wah-wah licks, and a pretty, colorful acoustic outro. \\"Redemption Of Man By God,\\" which features guest vocals from Devildriver's Dez Fafara, is backed by big, bone-crunching licks and busy, blasting drums.<br /><br />\\"Treachery\\" is a breakneck attack that evokes old-school Sepultura, and \\"Plata O Plomo,\\" which is sung entirely in Portuguese, and offsets its grinding blasts with a couple of splashes of gorgeous flamenco guitar strumming, is another throwback to Max's old days. \\"Chains\\" is slightly more mid-tempo, but still super heavy -- it has a deep, brooding groove, gut-punching riffs, catchy staccato vocals, and a fiery, searing guitar solo. The set concludes with \\"Revengeance,\\" which is a bass-heavy/driven closer with thundering bass lines (including a grumbling mini-bass solo) that compliment the tune's rapid-fire drumming very nicely.<br /><br />\\"Enslaved\\" is easily the angriest, darkest, fastest, heaviest, and most technically-impressive Soulfly offering to date. It might not be a particularly groundbreaking affair, but it does definitely make for numerous extremely enjoyable, enthralling, and fully-satisfying listening sessions.nues this frenetic pace, backing Eighties-era thrash-esque speedster picking with deft thrash beats, and topping it all off with some unorthodox, whammy-bar-drenched soloing. \\"American Steel\\" is another acrobatic guitar workout, one featuring massively crunching, machine-gun-fast riffing, some catchy wah-wah licks, and a pretty, colorful acoustic outro. \\"Redemption Of Man By God,\\" which features guest vocals from Devildriver's Dez Fafara, is backed by big, bone-crunching licks and busy, blasting drums.<br /><br />\\"Treachery\\" is a breakneck attack that evokes old-school Sepultura, and \\"Plata O Plomo,\\" which is sung entirely in Portuguese, and offsets its grinding blasts with a couple of splashes of gorgeous flamenco guitar strumming, is another throwback to Max's old days. \\"Chains\\" is slightly more mid-tempo, but still super heavy -- it has a deep, brooding groove, gut-punching riffs, catchy staccato vocals, and a fiery, searing guitar solo.

0385535147|4.0|I always enjoy John Grisham's books for one main reason: he keeps me turning pages. Sure, there were some weaknesses in the writing but not enough to detract me from the story, which manages to keep the reader guessing to the end. The author admits in his author's note to doing no research for the novel, which is a bit disappointing--if I'm reading a legal thriller by a lawyer, I want to learn something about the law in addition to enjoying the fiction. But regardless, I enjoyed this book and will continue to read this author's works.
B003IY48PS|4.0|I love this movie. i can watch it all the time, but i wish this blu-ray had more special features. At least something.

B0061S073A|5.0|I have an inquisitive typical 4 year old boy. I have a Kindle Fire HD, and I have colorful apps. This awesome little programs lets me lock down the screen and gives him the variety he wants! I have my HD locked at the main screen so he cannot access anything if he closes it. I recommend anyone with little ones sharing their device to do the same... because some apps will shut down allowing your child to have a free for all if they turn the device off.<br /><br />What I like about the app...<br />Password Protection<br />Individualized choices<br />Ease of adding and removing apps from his \\"library\\"<br /><br />Dislikes..<br /><br />only one... occasionally he managed to get to the carousel... but the parental lock quickly kicks him back into this app.<br /><br />I have no complaints other then that... It's a good app. I trust it
B009A9ETFE|5.0|There isn't anything too special other than the 1 new single.  It's pretty much just a cd to add to your collection.  It also supports HIM since they don't have a record label anymore, this is extra money they can earn to help with the profits of the new album and touring in the next few years. Support HIM and buy this!

B00910Y1OQ|4.0|I got this app as the free app of the day and enjoyed playing through it as a gem matching game. The storyline is pretty pointless but the game adds in some interesting challenges with the shape of the boards and extra type of blocks added. My two main complaints with the game is it is very resource heavy (barely ran on my HTC Evo 4G but ran fine on my Samsung Galaxy S3) and the replay value isn't really there. After finishing the story it says you can continue and have more challenging boards than on the first playthrough, but I had gotten board enough with the game by then that I had no desire to play it any longer. Good game for a free app, but I'm glad I didn't actually pay for it.
B00003CXTG|5.0|Excellent Movie.  Iteam was packaged securely.  Item was as described.  Shipment timely.  I wouldnot have a problem recommending this movie to anyone.

B009NQKPUW|1.0|If you can get past the serious, devastating series of mistakes - defying common sense - that the crew members make every few minutes, then this isn't a horrible movie. I had trouble getting into the suspense because everyone was always doing something so incredibly stupid that it took all the fear out of the situation. \\"Oh, hey there cute little alien snake monster! Aren't you adorable with all your hissing! Who looks like a penis? YOU look like a penis, yes you do! Now, I know that I'm trapped in this crypt filled with mysteriously dead aliens with no way back to the ship in case anything happens, but you're just too cute not to pet! Oh no! Now I'm dead! Who could have possibly predicted this unforeseeable turn of events?!\\"
B0091XRRQC|5.0|I have to say that its a great movie for both adults and kids. I think the story line was done very well. It's a movie that can be watch over and over. If you can't get at least one smirk or smile out of this movie that I have to say you must have fallin alseep. I found it fun and up lifting, so if you are reading this to see if you might like it I would say by showing this much interest in it you should get and watch it.
B005G5PPGS|4.0|Amazing realistic classic. A must read book for people who need to know nothing about baseball to enjoy. Plus a true story supported to it.
B009FRD8TY|5.0|On a night like this, Kylie proves that good pop music stands the test of time, and with proper aging, much like aging wine, delivers a set that is as exciting to listen to as listening to the original versions for the very first time.  Sinfully brilliant, The Abbey Road Sessions show that classic dance floor hits can be just as good in the clubs as they can be in a smokey jazz club.  The songs are re-recorded wonderfully, with stripped down production (many of then with just her and orchestral backing), allowing the conversation of the music to flow freely.  Be sure to download a copy for yourself today!  You won't be disappointed!

B006FE83UE|5.0|Movies can entertain us, and they can sometimes make you think. Every once in a while, they can have an influence that goes beyond that. Then, there's Mockingbird.<br /><br />This is my all-time favorite movie (and novel) and the reason I went to law school. Second only to my parents, Mockingbird probably had more influence in shaping my thinking than anything else, before or since. After more than half a century, Gregory Peck's Atticus Finch still stands as a towering figure of decency, integrity and courage that we should all seek to emulate. Having first seen it at 10 years old, I don't know that anything could so encapsulate and convey the importance of empathy, as with Atticus' treatment of Tom Robinson and Boo Radley. Now more than ever, it seems we should all go back and watch it again for the first time. 'What would Atticus do?'

0425263916|5.0|Now i have my emotions in check and have picked my jaw up off the floor, Reflected In You did not disappoint! It left off exactly where Bared To You had finished, which i enjoy as i feel we don't miss anything. Don't know about you but i want as much Gideon and Eva as i can get. We got to follow their relationship through the struggles and hard patches but also the fun and loving times they shared. I have cried, sighed, screamed and so much more at my kindle whilst reading this book and trust me when i say it has all been worth it. There were many jaw dropping, sat staring at your kindle moments and for that i am grateful, i love being kept on my toes with a book and expecting the unexpected. We got to learn more of what happened to both Gideon and Eva in their past and it makes my heart break but at the same time it makes you understand them so much more and makes you fall further in love with the book and them even though by this point you're there already. I came away with so many favorite moments from Reflected In You and even now when i think of them i can still feel the exact emotion i had at the time. We got a few visitors from Eva's past, i don't want to ruin anything but prepare yourself for one person in particular and the jaw dropping, hand over mouth moments. We also get to meet both Gideon's and Eva's family a little more, which left me with a few more questions which i cannot wait to discover, especially about Gideon's. Gideon and Eva deserve their happy ending. I am going to spread the word about this series as it should be read, enjoyed and loved by all.<br /><br />\\"I love you. Still not the right word, but i know you want to hear it.\\"<br /><br />\\"Most suits made the man. Gideon did things to a three-piece suit that should've been illegal.\\"<br /><br />\\"I kicked off my shoes and pulled his hand away from the wheel so I could straddle his lap and hold him. His grip on me was excruciatingly tight, but I didn't complain. We were on an insanely busy street, with endless cars rumbling past on one side and a crush of pedestrians on the other, but neither of us cared. He was shaking violently, as if he were sobbing uncontrollably, but he made no sound and shed no tears. The sky cried for him, the rain coming down hard and angry, steaming off the ground.\\"
B0087DFIOU|4.0|In a shocking turn of events, Mel Gibson's Get the Gringo is a surprisingly great blast.  Gibson plays the unnamed \\"gringo\\" that the title implies: a con-man that pulls off a million dollar heist and makes a run for the border, only to get stopped by dirty Mexican cops and thrown in a prison where anything goes.  In the process, he ends up befriending a chain-smoking 10 year old boy (and his mother) while running afoul of nearly everyone else in the process; all of which culminates in a blood-soaked showdown.  While Get the Gringo doesn't do anything we haven't seen before enough times already, it is massively entertaining for what it is, and demonstrates that no matter his personal demons and current status as a disgraced Hollywood icon, Mel Gibson still has the acting chops to convey being a likeable scumbag hero.  Check it out.
1592220169|5.0|Picked this up at the library because I had enjoyed the Song of Ice and Fire series.  I just loved everything about the book.  It included all of the things that were great about Ice and Fire before it got bogged down with too much plot and too many characters.  The great thing about Martin's books is the vast history.  the exhausting thing about Martin's books is the vast history...like real history it is better in small doses.  Very fun read.
B0030B624E|4.0|A little scary, pretty gory and very, very funny. Woody Harrelson is hysterical, and Bill Murray makes a great cameo. I would definitely recommend.
B007LE2VDM|5.0|I got this album for a couple of the songs, but I was pleasantly surprised by the rest of it. I have listened to it multiple times. Her voice is so unique, she is easy to sing to, but more importantly, her songs are very relate-able. They get to issues deep within the heart that can speak to sadness inside.
B008KL2ITW|5.0|Once i started i had to finish! The relationship between Abby and Travis was complicated at times but you found yourself rooting for them to make it. The ending didn't disappoint and i cannot wait for Walking Disaster to come out. If only we could all find our own Travis....

It was premiered in 1903.<br />His circle of students and friends - Franz Schalk, Ferdinand Loewe and Gustav Mahler - dominated German and Austrian music in the decades leading up to World War I.<br /><br />To the generation of conductors who began their careers in the period 1890-1910, the music of Bruckner was contemporary music.<br />Six of them left us recordings of at least one Bruckner Symphony:<br /><br />- Bruno Walter (1876-1962)................Conducting debut: 1894<br />- Carl Schuricht (1880-1967)....................Debut: 1900<br />- Oskar Fried (1871-1941)..........................Debut: 1904 (began conducting late, at age 33)<br />- Hermann Abendroth (1883-1956) .................

Unfortunately, he did not live to record in the stereo era.<br /><br />Hermann Abendroth recorded five symphonies with the radio orchestras of Leipzig (4,5,8,9) and Berlin (7).<br />Recorded between 1949 and 1956. Mono<br />Abendroth was overshadowed by his exact contemporary Furtwangler, who had the advantage of the Berlin Philharmonic.<br />As successor to Furtwangler and Bruno Walter, Abendroth conducted the great Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra from 1933 to 1945.<br />After World War II, the East German authorities banished him to the less prestigious Radio Orchestra of the same city.<br />[[ASIN:B00DANOMTO ヘルマン・アーベントロート指揮 ブルックナー]]<br /><br />Carl Schuricht recorded Symphonies 3,4,5 and 7,8,9 in broadcast and in the studio, between 1938 and 1965.<br />Four were in stereo:<br />Symphony 3 (Vienna Philharmonic -1965), Symphony 7 (Hague PO -1964) [[ASIN:B0009I8EZQ The Concert Hall Recordings - Carl Schuricht]] , Symphonies 8,9 (Vienna PO -1963).<br />The three stereo Vienna Philharmonic recordings have recently been reissued in a nice EMI budget box along with his mono Beethoven cycle from Paris: [[ASIN:B008I15774 ICON Carl Schuricht]]<br /><br />Bruno Walter recorded Symphonies 4,7,8,9 and the Te Deum in broadcast and in the studio, between 1940 and 1961.<br />Symphonies 4, 7 and 9 were recorded in stereo with the Columbia Symphony - included in the new 39 CD Bruno Walter Edition: [[ASIN:B00BNZN27E Bruno Walter: The Edition]]<br /><br />Young Bruno Walter could be tough. &#34;Old&#34; Bruno Walter was warm and fuzzy. Musicians loved him.<br /><br />Otto Klemperer was not warm and fuzzy.<br /><br />I love Otto Klemperer's Bruckner, but it's not to everyone's taste.<br />He conducted with his fists and a scowl on his face, and the music sometimes sounded like it.<br />He stood an intimidating 6 feet, 6 inches tall, and had a reputation (deserved) for mental instability and irrational behavior (nowadays he would be called bi-polar).<br />His intimidating appearance was the result of surgery to remove a brain tumor, which left him partially paralyzed for the last 30 years of his life.<br />The irrational behavior was with him all his life.<br />Intentional or not, this had an effect on orchestra players.<br /><br />Following that 1924 recording, Otto Klemperer recorded Symphonies 4-9 in broadcast and in the studio, between 1934 and 1970.<br />The Te Deum was recorded by the BBC in 1961 and is on Testament: [[ASIN:B0006IY5JS Bruckner: Symphony No. 6; Te Deum]].<br /><br />EMI here offers the stereo recordings, 1960-70.<br />Symphonies 4-7 were recorded in warm Kingsway Hall stereo between 1960 and 1967, and are highly regarded by critics and public alike.<br />4, 6 and 7 have justifiably appeared in EMI's &#34;Great Recordings of the Century&#34; series.<br /><br />Clarity is guaranteed by Klemperer's old-fashioned seating arrangement - first violins to the left, second violins to the right - which was, after all, what Bruckner expected.<br />Not all violins scrunched together on the left, which is the modern preference.<br /><br />Klemperer's strings were seated in an arc: First Violins, Basses, Cellos, Violas, Second Violins.<br />You get a remarkable sense of being &#34;inside&#34; the orchestra.<br />Fun to listen to over headphones.<br /><br />Symphonies 8 and 9 were recorded in 1970: Klemperer was 85, the end was near, and the struggle shows.<br />The 8th Symphony has an enormous cut in the finale.<br />It was Klemperer's idea, and hard to justify.<br />His 8th and 9th Symphonies are clearly not standard recommendations.<br />Fascinating and quite moving, nonetheless.<br /><br />Klemperer conducted an uncut Bruckner 8th with the Cologne Radio Symphony in 1957: [[ASIN:B001VSBF6I Symphony #8]].<br />It times in at 72 minutes versus 84 minutes for the cut EMI recording.<br />72 Minutes is actually the fastest Bruckner 8th (Haas) on record.<br />Klemperer's manic-depressive pendulum had clearly swung to manic that day.<br /><br />I find comparative listening fascinating.

B009A9EPLM|5.0|John Williams has been scoring Spielberg's films for 40 years, and they have one of the most successful collaborations in filmmaking... Jaws, E.T., Indiana Jones, Jurassic Park, and most recently [[ASIN:B005LK8NSK War Horse]], to name a few.  Their history alone is a good enough for buying the \\"Lincoln\\" soundtrack, and fortunately it delivers.<br /><br />Though \\"Lincoln\\" is not among the most memorable of Williams musical work, it is still extremely moving.  One of the great things about Spielberg's use of music is that it is showy at the right moments, and is more subdued when it needs to be.  \\"Lincoln\\", a film with a lot of dialogue and is also very much focused on the President's inner turmoil, requires more subdued music.  As always, Williams provides exactly what is needed for the film.  Normally, a score this subtle and reflective would not necessarily make for good listening out of the context of the film - but the music of \\"Lincoln\\" is just so good that it works on it's own.  Therefore, I highly recommend this CD.<br /><br />* I have included some links in the comments section that might be of interest to Williams/Spielberg fans.

B008YKRRI6|5.0|I recently came across this anecdote in Richard Osborne's biography of Herbert von Karajan:<br /><br />\\"[In October 1957] Karajan was off to Japan with the Berlin Philharmonic, though not before he made a flying visit to London to hear Klemperer conduct the Eroica Symphony with the Philharmonia.<br />It was a visit which led to a famous encounter in Klemperer's dressing-room after the concert:<br />KLEMPERER: Herr von Karajan, what are you doing here?<br />KARAJAN: I have simply come to thank you and to say that I hope I shall live to conduct the Funeral March as well as you have done it.<br />Good night.\\" *<br /><br />Three Nineteenth Century conductors lived long enough to leave us with a complete cycle of Beethoven Symphonies in the new medium of Stereo (beginning in 1956).<br />I'm fudging a little: Nineteenth Century Romanticism dragged on for a few years after 1900,<br />But their formative years were in the Nineteenth Century:<br /><br />- Bruno Walter (1876-1962)..................Debut: 1894<br />- Pierre Monteux (1875-1964)...............Debut: 1895<br />- Otto Klemperer (1885-1973)...............Debut: 1905<br /><br />Their conducting styles were different from each other (and from their younger selves).<br />Nevertheless, all three had strong personalities which they effectively communicated to an orchestra.<br />I still listen to these sets with pleasure, which is more than I can say for dozens of faceless conductors who came afterward (no names!).<br /><br />[hint: for ease of navigation, read the review though to the end, then come back and click on the links.]<br /><br />Monteux's Beethoven is the most \\"modern\\" sounding of the three - with the London Symphony and Vienna Philharmonic (distributed by Universal)<br />- As he aged, his interpretations also changed less dramatically than the other two: [[ASIN:B013HFUAHC Beethoven: Nine Symphonies]]<br /><br />Young Bruno Walter could be tough. \\"Old\\" Bruno Walter with the Columbia Symphony (Sony) was warm and fuzzy.<br /> Musicians loved him.<br />Included in the new 39 CD Bruno Walter Edition: [[ASIN:B00BNZN27E Bruno Walter: the Edition]]<br /><br />Otto Klemperer was not warm and fuzzy.<br />I love Otto Klemperer's Beethoven, but it's not to everyone's taste.<br />He conducted with his fists and a scowl on his face, and the music sometimes sounded like it.<br />He wasn't really a terrible old man - his intimidating appearance was the result of surgery to remove a brain tumor, which left him partially paralyzed for the last 30 years of his life.<br />This only complicated the problems caused by his life-long bouts of mental illness (nowadays he would be called \\"bi-polar\\").<br />He could be difficult to deal with, but the Philharmonia Orchestra and the British public loved him.<br /><br />Interestingly, according to contemporary accounts, Beethoven conducted his own music with his fists and a scowl on his face.<br />- And he really was a terrible man.<br />Can this be authentic performance practice?<br /><br />Klemperer's Beethoven has been reissued several times on CD, but this new collection is the first absolutely complete edition of his EMI Beethoven Symphonies, Overtures, Grosse Fugue, and excerpts from Egmont & Prometheus.<br />The Concerti, Missa Solemnis and Fidelio are not included -

B009FBX5M0|4.0|UPDATE: I have listened to the score twice now on its own, and I have also seen the film.  The music works very well within the context of the movie, and its slightly less impressive while listening to it on its own.  But overall, \\"Skyfall\\" is one of the year's best soundtracks.<br /><br />David Arnold's music on [[ASIN:B000IOM1SW Casino Royale (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)]] and [[ASIN:B001ESYAJY Quantum of Solace]] was very impressive, but I thought it was time for a new composer to try their luck with Bond.  Furthermore, I was very excited when it was announced that Sam Mendes would direct \\"Skyfall\\" because I knew that meant that Thomas Newman would likely be scoring the film -- the two frequently work together, and Newman has written some excellent music for Mendes (particularly \\"Road to Perdition\\" and \\"Revolutionary Road\\").<br /><br />Newman's score for \\"Skyfall\\" is everything that a film score should be.  It has tracks that are very thrilling and bombastic, and others that are full of sorrow.  The music conveys the epic scope of the Bond franchise; but the tone also gives a more personal/emotional sense that the other Bond scores have not been able to achieve.  Newman works in the familiar 007 themes here and there, but some of the most memorable tracks on the album are completely original compositions.<br /><br />Please Note: This score does not include the Adele single \\"Skyfall\\" that plays during the opening credits of the film - get that track here: [[ASIN:B009KUANWG Skyfall]]<br /><br />Also: Both the CD and Amazon MP3 version of the soundtrack have 30 tracks... but a Track 31 \\"Old Dog, New Tricks\\" is available for purchase at the iTunes store.
B0041D843M|1.0|I at first was impressed with the book but as I progressed through it I began to think that everything was too good to be true. All of the diseases we were suffering in our wonderful country were due to eating meat and animal products and if we just went to a natural vegaterian diet like the Chinese we would live forever. Wow what a wonderful \\"documented\\" discovery. It reached a point where it seemed that we would not even suffer from a common cold or stubbed toe if we were to eliminate every animal material from our diets even the highly poisonous (to rats) cheese and eggs. He used the idea that he had grown up on a farm and could not at first accept any of this but he was finally forced by reason to radically change his mind. I suspect that a greater influence came from the sources of funding that provided him with his resources than the actual results of his studies. The final nail to the coffin of his great discovery was when I looked up the life expectancy of the poor debauched meat eaters of America who suffer so much (U.N. 78.2 years C.I.A. 78.37 years) compared to the enlightened Chinese who with such great health die younger than we do (U.N. 74.8 years C.I.A.73.47 years). I dumped the book and went out for a steak.

B008YKRRIQ|5.0|I first started listening to classical music when I was fifteen - in 1964.<br />My first big crush was Herbert von Karajan.<br />I think I may have been influenced by the sheer look and feel of 1960s Deutsche Gramophon LP records.<br />They were twice as thick as American records, came in extra-wide plastic-lined sleeves, and didn't snap, crackle and pop like American records.<br /><br />The infatuation with Karajan lasted about five years, until I discovered Otto Klemperer and Bruno Walter at my college record shop (what's a record shop?).<br />The American pressings were still pretty awful, but the music-making was revelatory: Walter was warm and comforting; Klemperer was imposing and majestic.<br />Still my two favorite conductors of the stereo era.<br /><br />Both men were dinosaurs: holdovers from the Nineteenth Century who lived long enough to give us stereo recordings.<br /><br />Bruno Walter made his conducting debut in 1894 and Otto Klemperer in 1905.<br />Their formative years were in the Nineteenth Century.<br /><br />Young Bruno Walter could be tough. \\"Old\\" Bruno Walter with the Columbia Symphony was warm and fuzzy.

B003N7ORNI|4.0|'Rick Riordan' is trully a great author. When I first read the 'Percy Jackson' series, I really liked it. So, obviously, I had great expectaions from this book. And 'The Kane Chronicles' does live up to expectations..... Almost!<br /><br />Firstly, I must mention, that audio recording crap was basically just a load of nonsense. He could have wrote the book without that garbage. And now that Mr Riordan says it s an audio recording, it isnt anything like one. For example, why would anyone go into such details while giving a recording, and.... well its crap anyway.<br /><br />Okay, now no comments on the writing style as it is just as good as Percy Jackson. But the story is a bit too lengthy. The chapter names have no connection with the context but the storyline is as good as ever.<br /><br />Rating: 7.7 / 10
B009G78EE2|5.0|Since the first time I heard \\"Otherside\\" I have been a devout Macklemore fan. The Heist comes to me as one of the most important (and best) hip-hop albums in a generation. Whether taking a fun-loving approach in \\"Thrift Shop\\" or a powerfully emotional stance in songs like \\"Same Love\\" and \\"Starting Over\\", this album will have an impact on you. You will dance. You will laugh. You might cry (I still do sometimes during Starting Over). Overall, I believe you will thoroughly enjoy the masterful production work from Ryan Lewis and the consistently unbelievable performances by Macklemore. These two form a potent combo and I hope they continue bringing me life-altering music until further notice.

B0096HNDXY|4.0|I confess that I'm not a particularly devoted listener of Kylie Minogue's music. I've enjoyed her songs on the radio and web, and danced to them on nights out. But her music is usually a little outside the musical genres I spend the most time listening to (rock, jazz, blues).<br /><br />That said, what piqued my curiosity about this CD - and inspired me to give it a listen - was the very intriguing concept. The Abbey Road sessions features 16 of Kylie's songs, collected throughout her long career, completely reworked, and performed with a full orchestra and Kylie's band at London's Abbey Road Studios.<br /><br />Kylie's usual high-energy pop production has been scaled down (and the songs mostly slowed down) in favor of fresh orchestral and acoustic arrangements, sometimes hushed, some with soaring highs, and many with a jazz or blues flavor. All but one of Kylie's danceable pop hits are presented as ballads here. They're still mostly pop, but it's a more adult, sophisticated variety - often sweet or romantic, and occasionally dark or seductive.<br /><br />The album's first single, is the previously-unreleased &#34;Flower.&#34; Written during the time of her breast cancer treatments, when her eventual ability to have a child was in question, &#34;Flower&#34; is a wistful, tender love letter to a hoped-for future child:<br /><br />Distant child, my flower<br />Are you blowing in the breeze?<br />Can you feel me?<br />As I breathe life into you<br />In a while my flower<br />Somewhere in a desert haze<br />I know one day you'll amaze me<br /><br />&#34;The Locomotion,&#34; written by Gerry Goffin and Carole King, was a hit for Little Eva back in 1962, 25 years before Kylie's success with it in 1987. And, 25 years later, Kylie reaches back to the 1960s for inspiration, giving the song a fun Motown-esque makeover. It's the only non-ballad on the new album, and like the original may inspire you to put on your dancing shoes.<br /><br />&#34;Love at First Sight,&#34; a little more up-tempo than some of the other songs, is given a contemporary country twist. &#34;Hand on Your Heart&#34; is country-influenced as well. &#34;I Believe in You&#34; is a sweet love song. &#34;Slow&#34; is transformed into a sultry, seductive torch song; it has the feel of being sung in a smoky jazz club. &#34;On a Night Like This&#34; morphs into a stunning big-band number.<br /><br />As was the original, Kylie's new take on &#34;Where the Wild Roses Grow,&#34; is a duet with Nick Cave. This time around, it's given a traditional folk-style acoustic arrangement, which works well to highlight the story and emotion of this dark ballad about a man who takes the life of his trusting young lover.<br /><br />The packaging for the standard edition (I haven't seen the Deluxe) contains a booklet containing glamorous photos of Kylie, and lyrics for all the songs. The design is very elegant! However, if you'd like to read the lyrics or credits, you'd better have super eyesight or have a magnifying glass handy, because the text is incredibly tiny.<br /><br />While most of the songs on this album worked quite well in their new, more laid-back tone, a little more punch and sizzle would have better suited my tastes. But if you're looking for an elegant album with a lovely pared-down, contemporary pop vibe, featuring some beautiful vocals - maybe just the thing for cozy fall nights and the holidays - this might be the one.<br /><br />The Abbey Road Sessions caps a year-long celebration of Kylie's 25 years in music, which has also included the release of a greatest hits album, a hit single, &#34;Timebomb,&#34; and a global tour.<br /><br />It took some audacity for Kylie Minogue to reinterpret her songs in so radical a manner; this is a long way from anything her fans have heard, or expected from her before. But it mostly works - the album shows her versatility, and that there are exciting possibilities for her future as a performer. It will be fascinating to see what the next 25 years bring.<br /><br />Disclosure: The record company sent me an advance review copy of this CD. Rest assured that the opinions stated in the review are honest, and are solely my own!view are honest, and are solely my own!

B008RZF1UO|4.0|I was very excited for the release of Silverthorn. It really does mark a new era in Kamelot's history with Roy Khan's departure and his replacement, Tommy Karevik, being announced earlier this year. The Kamelot lads have done much since then to offer just enough tidbits about the album to create a steady groundswell of interest from fans, both those skeptical at a Khan-less process and those supportive regardless. I admit I was very much swept up by the momentum and I love a good concept album to sink my teeth into and try to match the story with the music.<br /><br />I took some time from my initial spin of the CD to pass judgment and attempt a review. I fully recognized that I was enamored by the hype and the prospect of a new Kamelot album and I wanted to give as rational and objective review as I could. Surely that's impossible, being a self-professed Kamelot fan, but I'll do my best. Had I written my review Saturday night when I got the CD, it would have been emotional, reactionary, and completely subjective.<br /><br />I miss Roy Khan. I can't help it. It's not fair to compare Tommy to Roy, since Roy did so much lyrically and vocally to form much of Kamelot's identity, but the reality is that Tommy will be compared to Roy fair or not. Karevik does sound similar to Roy, especially in his lower ranges, a fact that has not been lost on any of the reviews that I've read. Overall, I think Tommy is a phenomenal singer technically, but some of my criticism of Silverthorn is that Tommy is too clinically perfect in his vocals. They are almost a whitewashed performance. Roy had a wonderful way of intertwining emotion into his vocal performances...as if he were a method actor channeling the emotion felt by the protagonist in each song. I hate to say it, but much of that is lost in Tommy's performance. Where Tommy shines brightest is in the areas where his delivery focuses on the emotive over the technically perfect. Veritas, My Confession, and the title track Silverthornare all excellent tracks that are made so because Tommy's emotional voice makes the listener believe the feelings that underlie what he's singing. The same can be said for the three-part opus Prodigal Son, although I realize it's not for everyone. Other strong songs include the driving Ashes to Ashes, Torn, Sacrimony, and Falling Like The Fahrenheit, but they fail to live up to the other songs because Tommy's performance, while very strong, lacks that emotional punch to fully bring it home (at least for me). The weakest track is Solitaire, which incidentally is also the name for another Kamelot song on Ghost Opera. I find it repetitive, uninteresting, and containing rather clunky lyrics. Where I'm torn the most is on the balled Song for Jolee. It's a haunting soliloquy from a brother to his deceased sister. Again, Tommy's performance is technically very good, but here more than anywhere else does the album sound like Seventh Wonder rather than Kamelot. It's also a bit too close to the kind of Broadway musical soliloquy you would expect from Lloyd Webber than a song that would fit seamlessly next to the more up-tempo metal pieces. Despite that, I found myself trying to put myself in the brother's position and feeling moved, perhaps not least of all because my own daughter is five years old and would be about the same age as the sister when she died.<br /><br />That's as good a place as any to transition into the concept. I was drawn in by the background storybook included in the limited edition set. That being said, I think it's difficult to understand some of the lyrical clues in the songs without reading the story for context. None of the lyrics, for example, reveal exactly what \\"Silverthorn\\" actually is and why it's important to the story. The book, however, places it at the center of the entire narrative. Even with the book, it's important to understand that the songs are not narrative driven, that is they are not chronologically arranged to tell a story, but rather all draw conceptually upon the story from the book. It took me a few spins to realize that as I was trying to arrange the songs into some narrative that follows the written story. There's nothing inherently wrong with that approach, many a concept album has taken that tact, but it took me some time to get used to it.<br /><br />On the whole, while I think this is a very good entry into Kamelot's canon, there are areas that make me feel this album was rushed. For example, the first single Sacrimony has both Alize Ryd (clean vocals) and Alissa White-Gluz (dirty vocals) singing with Karevik. I had assumed that Alize's lines represented the voice of the dead sister in the brother's head playing almost the \\"good angel on his shoulder\\" while Alissa's vocals represented his internal pain, self blame, and doubt, or the \\"bad angel on his shoulder.\\" I think this would have been an interesting study of internal struggle to explore moving through the songs, but it evaporates after Sacrimony with only a couple of reappearances of the dead sister later in the album. It makes me wonder if the band toyed with the idea of a \\"voices in my head\\" motif and abandoned it. If not, I'm at a bit of a loss to really understand White-Gluz's presence in Sacrimony. On its own, I really like the song, but I think it establishes expectations that are never realized in the rest of the CD for whatever reason.<br /><br />The other place I felt the band rushed to production is in the packaging. Clearly, a lot of effort went in to conceiving the concept story and the conceptual imagery on the packaging to support the story. It's quite beautiful, actually, with a kind of washed out, wintery-blue feeling throughout. And yet, there are horrible misspellings in the printed lyrics. Prodigal Son is at the most fault here with multiple uses of \\"strenght\\" instead of \\"strength,\\" \\"taken to soon\\" rather than \\"taken too soon,\\" and, my favorite,  \\"Determines everybodies fate in life\\" rather than \\"Determines everybody's fate in life.\\" I hate to be the grammar troll here, but for all the careful planning and work that went into creating a visual atmosphere in the packaging, a thorough proofreading is not too much to expect.<br /><br />From a bird's eye view, I really enjoyed Silverthorn. It's got driving metal guitars, prog moments galore that add spice, and a good mix of symphonic orchestration and church choir vocals with the guitar work. Other reviews have pointed out that the mix feels very \\"compressed,\\" and I understand where they are coming from. At times, the bass seems to be lost in the mix, but I also think this was done deliberately to play on the melancholic, frigid mood that the story would like to evoke. It doesn't distract too much for me. On the whole, this is a very good Kamelot album and a commendable debut for Tommy Karevik. Despite some of the nit-picky flaws I've pointed out, I think the work taken all together rises above those flaws to present an enjoyable listening experience that should leave Kamelot fans looking to a strong future with Tommy at the helm. I just think he needs some more time to truly get comfortable and allow that to translate into the music.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I enjoyed the book.  Good story, liked flipping between the main characters' viewpoints.  You can kind of guess where the story is going but still thought it was good and was curious how it would resolve at the end.  It really doesn't.  Very disappointing.  I can think of a dozen different endings but apparently the author couldn't (or wouldn't).  I expected an epilogue or something.
B009GX7O56|5.0|I may be biased, but I absolutely love this TV drama, so every episode is interesting and a must-see. I can't get over the chemistry of the cast and the humor they add to crime scene investigation.  I could watch this show all day long and not get bored.
B00009XITP|5.0|I just love this movie..the quality is great...i probably should have gotten 2..i watch it a few times a week..it is great on many levels..
B009RI4FRU|4.0|loved the movie...quirky, off beat. Characters are well formed and add great depth to the movie. Just adored the whole \\"FEEL\\"of the movie... the scenery, the time set in, the acting.... found amusing. Not laugh out loud funny, but amusing.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|This is a really nice box set, and a must for any Star Trek Fan!  The Bonus Disc is especially a nice feature with this set
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I love the ability to change seasons with the birds.  It is a fun challenge and who can dislike changes.  recommend this for a gift this season.
B005FMZVLQ|4.0|Good n.  .... .... .... ....... .... ... ... ... Ñ.ñ ñ..  .. ... . ...  ....  .... . . .
B0000029AP|5.0|this is a very good album! as a hard core aerosmith fan i know a lot of the bands work. i highly suggest this album to ANYONE!! every album this band has put out is amazing. but for anyone THIS album and Rocks are the ones to have, even if your not a huge fan like i am. if you like this check out more of their songs,, its just good old classic hard rock, the way it should be !
B0083P1QUM|4.0|I have been a Patricia Cornwell fan from her very frst novel and I have stuck with her thru the great ones and the ones that seemed to deviate slightly off course. I am pleased to say that I found this one has the \\"old\\" Cornwell writing style, with all of its cynicism and the fact that she is constantly questioning herself and those around her, only makes me love her style and the character, Scarpetta, even more. Her sensitivity towards herself and the way she seems to never be satisfied with the way things present themselves at face value is the the Scarpetta of days gone by. Excellent read and I would recommend it, especially to those who have been disappointed with some of her recent works.. This will change your mind. Promise!
B0001I55OC|4.0|I give this version of Timeline 3½ stars, rounded up to 4 (because you can't do 3½ here).  I read the book, then saw the movie.  The book was good, the movie felt rushed, now I know why: studio interference.  This movie was originally 136 minutes and included a prologue explaining things a bit so you wouldn't feel lost, and lord knows how many scenes were shortened and/or cut altogether to satisfy the suits who wanted a more palatable length movie.  In doing so the movie felt rushed.  So many things they could've expanded on, they could've taken their time and got it right.  But no, the suits interference ruined what could've easily been a 4 or 4½ star movie.<br /><br />So where is the 136 minute Donner cut?  -kd5-
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I loved this book! After reading Looking for Alaska, also by John Green, I couldn't resist going back for more. It was sad, yes, but also inspirational. Learning to live is hard but important and this book puts an excellent perspective on things. I would recommend it to anyone (and I frequently do).
B009RIMPIG|5.0|I love following the show and seeing where the romance between Castle and Becket is heading. I like how you still see the interaction between Castle and his daughter even with her living out on her own now.
B0007C9DR2|5.0|This is one of those books that speaks to the heart and sould of every human being, regardless of where or how you were raised. I actually had to read it for school years ago and had forgotten about it until it became necessary for me to read it again to help me with a certain situation. It is simple, yet complex at the same time. I would recommend it to anyone, student, reader, or to someone who just might want to get a glimpse into the behavior that makes up each and every person. No one walks around pondering these things out loud; however, if you do, this book has the resources tohelp anyone figure out what the reasoning and explanations for that might be. I love the definitions of love and why we don't keep secrets. Awesome..
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Always on edge, I didn't want it to end. Loved every minute of it. Great book. Had me crying,  told my friend about it.  Then she went out and bought her one.
B0036TGSIK|5.0|There's never a moment while \\"channel surfing\\" that I come across this movie and don't stop and watch until the end!  Emma Stone is just fantastic - from her facial expressions to her cute little lisp, to her overall acting ability makes this movie a must see - over and over again!<br /><br />Max Crumm - Let My People Goooooo!  Love you!
B008G8SFGO|4.0|Very much like Sonic Boom. Complete and very good album! Takes from all eras of kiss and gives the fans what they want.
B0065QUD8W|5.0|what can i say--classic stories, well-formatted, and the bottom line is that it is always an immense pleasure to read watson's accounts of sherlock's cases
B000001FKY|5.0|the most polished, consistent and high-quality album of all time, IMO. Watched the documentary (a video on the making of the album) and I couldn't believe how much time and effort Mutt Lang and crew put into creating it. I will still be listening to this when I am 80 years old and in a retirement home. LOL.
B00992CF6W|3.0|get it from 4shared it wks. just sign up and get the newest with aneroid sign and some don't wk. some do just keep trying

B0034G4P1W|5.0|This movie was a lot of fun.  There's plenty of young funnies to keep the little ones laughing but also quite a bit of adult stuff for the grownups!  SO and I enjoyed watching it!!
B008FRFN7A|5.0|This is the most use full app I have found for my phone. My children send daily pictures of my grand children.  It's a must to print Some of them not only to show around but I like to strew them over my desk to catch sight of as I work through the day.
B0091REZMW|4.0|this hidden pic is enjoyable because it is not the same stuff in the exact same place with the exact same clues each time. the shadows, scrambled words, and flashlight rounds make it interesting without being annoyingly impossible. nice enough for relaxing but still sometimes a challenge.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest collects and connects like minds. Collections and collections and people make this enjoyable. Pinning is global and local - and from it we are informaed and inspired.
B001MTENOC|5.0|Micheal Newton gives details in presenting each case that makes Journey of Souls fascinating and believable. I did not believe in life after death 6 months ago and through compelling books like this my life and outlook have been completely changed.
1401322786|1.0|I was really looking forward to reading my first book by Mitch Albom, but to my dismay, there wasn't much I liked about it.  Though it tried to be somewhat spiritual, it seemed as if it was just a half-hearted attempt to sell more books.<br /><br />I was highly disappointed.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Formulaic DeMille, which is not necessarily a bad thing, and I relate to John Corey.  Best parts of the book are the descriptions of Yemenese society and the historical relationships between the various factions in the Middle East.  Quick read and worth it.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|I really like this game. it gets a little repetitive but overall it is super addictive. I wish they had more levels.
B00A1ZW1JC|5.0|dam why all the black people dying lol But still a great show I love it Ive watched all the seasons in two weeks first started on netflix then came here
B0049VVE7Y|5.0|I enjoy watching the whole series when I want instead of having to wait a week for the next episode. This series is awesome! You can't wait for the next episode.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|the movie was pretty good and well worth the rental.  i was very pleased with the quality of the stream to the xbox 360.  I certainly rent again.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|Kay Scarpetta is back and in great form. This story has a great twist and will keep you guessing who the murderer is until the last few chapters.
B009KHDT0C|3.0|As a loyal fan of the original Dark Shadows, I was a disappointed in this remake. While keeping some characters true to the original, others and the overall plot just seemed lacking. There was some great 70s music which helped to keep the movie moving.
B009RI4FRU|4.0|Hubby and I were looking for a good \\"cuddle up on a Sunday night and relax\\" movie with some laughs. This was perfect. Good acting, the humor wasn't moronic, the young teens were perfectly cast and played.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|The second book of the series was awesome and even better than the first. I can't wait until the final book comes out. I loved how Eva and Gideon develop as a couple and as individuals. The ending was intense.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|The CD was in great shape and it sounds awesome! It took a little longer to arrive than I would have liked, but it was totally worth the wait. The price was ideal as well.
0525953728|5.0|This book gives an amazing look at the kind of person that becomes a U.S.Navy SEAL.  It also brings light to the real events that occurred on that night.  Because of the missions these men conduct, they don't get the recognition they deserve.  We all need to be thankful they're there.
B004LP3AYI|4.0|A great story almost undone by the terrible editing. Having read the print edition; the e book version was riddled by grammatical errors that did not occur in the original.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I got this game for my daughter and she loves it dearly. I recommend this game for adults and children alike.
B00992CF6W|5.0|People have been adding diamond maps epic seeds and more. I got a sneak  this peak of a update that adds moving lava pigman a alternitave nether and<br />more (Im not spoiling everything) This is a cool game that adds the feeling of minecraft PC for a simpler priceI simply ADORE the features and would love a hardcore mode!!!!!!
B004SD5GZ4|2.0|when I first downloaded it, it was great. the ability to study and underline and highlight was very nice.  then the update.  that ability is still there....but you can only do whole lines instead of individual words or partial sentences.  SUCK!  PUT IT BACK!  please....
B00785P2QC|5.0|this game is one of the best games I have on my kindle fire I love building cities like in this game
B0076DCT2G|4.0|I have been an avid fan of Nelson DeMille novels and think that his books \\"The Lions Game\\" and \\"The Lion\\" were two of the best novels I have ever read... so I was very excited to read the next adventure of ATTF agent John Corey. I love the wise-guy ex NYC cop attitude of this character, and you won't be disappointed as Correy hasn't lost any of his curmudgeoness in this novel. The story is a familiar theme to his last novels, but I felt that DeMille spent too much time \\"getting there\\" and less time on the \\"Panther\\" and his motivations. Perhaps I'm spoiled, in that the \\"Lions Game\\" was so thrilling in that you knew everything the bad guy was thinking, and what his motivations were, and this book seemed less so. I also was disappointed with the ending, I felt there could have been much more to what happened after Correy got back to New York, and it seemed DeMille just ended the story so abruptly. Its still a good read especially if you are a fan of this character, just a little anticlimatic from the last two novels. When are they going to make a movie out of the Lions Game!!!
B000RH0C8G|5.0|Wonderful writing, great characters, and intellectually interesting to boot.  Particularly entertaining if you played Strat-O-Matic baseball as a kid. My favorite player was John Mayberry, who hit well but walked a ton.  Maybe I missed my calling...
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Just when I thought Rick couldn't get any better, bam he shows all what he is made of. Leaves you wanting more. I am glad they got rid of Shane
B003O86FMW|3.0|A page turner that continues the dark saga of the Hunger Games. The ending too abrupt; clearly an effort to require purchase of the third book
B005SZAEYO|3.0|Thing is, alongside Deadwood and Breaking Bad, it's hard to compete.<br /><br />But anything with Jessica Lange in it is gonna get at least three stars from us.
B003QTSMXE|5.0|Good animation as in all of pixars films and I love the story and themes. This is a great movie for the whole family!
B007TUAHVQ|5.0|Mega Bloks has consistently satisfied with me with their support of the Halo franchise, but throughout the years of buying a set here and there, one can't help but feel the childhood stigma of Mega Bloks being inferior to Lego just hadn't worn off... At least until this set.<br /><br />Mega Bloks has really upped the ante in quality with this and their upcoming Halo 4 sets and I can say with full confidence that I am definitely glad to have the Halo franchise in their hands. This set is roughly equivalent to Lego quality for what is easily half the price for a comparable number of Lego bricks - a real bargain for the amount of effort that went into it. The attention to detail and likeness to the Halo 4 Warthog redesign is enough to excite any Halo enthusiast, and if you weren't a fan of Mega Bloks before, now is seriously a great time to turn it around.<br /><br />The Warthog itself is a great piece, and the suspension on the tires allows for some pretty dynamic shelf poses if you've got some terrain for it to be riding over. The turret swivels a full 360 degrees (though it mostly only has 90 degree swivel with a Spartan on the gun, especially if you stick a weapon on his back) horizontally and swivels a little up and down, and the back of the hog shows off the updated Halo 4 design (that we saw in the latest Forza game) with all 4 gas canisters in tow - it even goes as far as to include the ability for you to have the back swivel down for loading a spartan in, which is a great feature you don't see in the Amazon pictures.<br /><br />Both of the Spartans included are modeled off of the same Mjolnir armor that Master Chief wears in 4 and are quite well painted in a small step up from previous Spartan figures (I say small because the Spartans have always been fairly well painted). The Elite figure is also based off an entirely new sculpt, and is considerably better painted and slightly more articulated than the previous Elites - he's a real looker, and I love his sleek design. 4 weapons are included with the set: The new sticky detonator from Halo 4, an Assault Rifle (seems identical to previous molds) painted a new black color, a green Spartan Laser (unsure if this had been in previous sets), and a carbine with a slightly more lavender paint than previous ones.<br /><br />In addition to all that, the set also comes with a weapon drop pod (looks like the ones that showed up in Halo 2) that has 3 different pegs for an assortment of weapons to be placed inside (it opens and closes, but can be a little hard to get used to opening) and a piece of Forerunner technology with adjustable folds laying on a medium sized desert plate. You can't really do a lot with it for play, but it looks really nice for display and makes a good position for the Elite to defend.<br /><br />My only small complaints are that it's a little hard to fit a Spartan in the passenger seat of the Hog given the tube that \\"powers\\" the floodlight (be careful not to lose the transparent piece when you dump out the pieces), I had to use a little bit of putty to keep the turret's pole tight in how it moves, and that although it's relatively easy to build, the packages all need to be dumped out at once so you end up with a lot of pieces to sort through (some people have had problems with Mega Bloks doing this - it's a minor annoyance to me, but I figured I'd get that out there).<br /><br />Overall, it's a REALLY great set (that comes with a decent number of bonus pieces), and if we're in for this sort of quality in upcoming sets (which we certainly seem to be given the previews), both Halo and Mega Bloks fans have a lot to be looking forward to. If you've thought Mega Bloks were sorta mediocre in the past, give them another chance, I promise you will NOT be disappointed. And, hey, if you get just ONE set, why not make it this one? It's excellently priced, it's well made, and it's the Warthog, man! You don't get more iconic of Halo than having the Master Chief driving orgunning Covies down in a hog.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was fantastic. I literally couldnt keep my eyes out of the book. The details were so good i could imagine them. I was very upset when i read all three books and there was not another one . I suggest this book even to men.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|Love the author but feel like she phoned this one in, never really got going for me, I'll still buy her next one.
B009JNXK88|5.0|I love noodlecake. they helped make flow free and they make awesome 8 bit looking apps like velocospider, this game, has a ton of levels, has noodlecakes look and lets you act like a ninja as you wall jump and beat up people. this is a great game
0316228532|1.0|eewww[...]<br /><br />Couldn't get beyond page 30.... so this review will be biased against the book... Apologies... Please don't stop reading the book because of the review...<br /><br />Do you have to use expletives to prove that you are writing for adults? Can't adults have a life beyond sex, drugs, cheapness etc. Not to say that this should not be included, but there is more to life and HOPE is a part of it. Though in the end there seems to be a ray of hope, it is so lost in the steaminess of life... it is LOST!!!! (Skipped to the last couple of pages after the 30th)<br /><br />I know I am being naive, in wanting a nice, warm, intelligent book from JKR... But so be it... Jeffery Archer is a writer for adults, and he does not have to resort to crude language to make a point. I dont have anything against the crudeness of the language, but it somehow does not fit the story (in my head!!!)....<br /><br />Disappointed.... Very very Disappointed... Wish I could just wave my wand and OBLIVIATE... and also cry \\"Expecto Patronum\\"....<br /><br />ewwwwww[...]<br /><br />Thought some more about this...<br /><br />Wanted to compare this with two books - one that equals it in sleaziness and another that can compare the social situation (gangsters, rapists, drug dealers, murderers etc). Tilly Bagshawe's \\"Mistress of the Game\\" was awful in terms of sleaziness and crap and I am very deeply hurt that J K Rowling can be compared to this novel. The novel that can be compared to a similar social situation was Jeffery Archer's Prison Diaries. I have read the first one and am half way through the second. They are really nice. He does not gloss over the conditions in the prison or even in some of cases that he shares with his audience. But the grace and the tact and the finesse that goes into the book is fantastic. They are classy in the understatement and descriptions. Not using words for the sake of titillating, but used to make the story come alive.<br /><br />Finally, I had to readmy Harry Potter once again... and I cannot believe that the same person wrote this bilge...<br /><br />Please Ms. Rowling... You dont have to prove that you can do 'everything' by being cheap... please please...
B0083SBMBM|3.0|The movie of course is good. All you get in this dvd as far as extras is a short making of segment.<br />No deleted scenes. So it's best to wait for a low price to get your money's worth like say $10.
B009YDAUJ0|5.0|This rating is based on the show - not any technical difficulties. I feel that if you are going to give a review of an episode, book, etc., you should actually rate the show NOT the problems you had with streaming or downloading.  That is a totally separate issue. Yes, I get pissed off when technical problems occur, but that has nothing to do with the show itself.<br /><br />Walking Dead is wonderfully written and the characters are superbly developed. Practically every other zombie show I've watched (with the exception of I AM LEGEND and DAWN OF THE DEAD) have been ridiculously cheesy and not worth my time. TWD is in a class of its own.<br /><br />You cannot have constant zombie killing all day long in every freakin' episode. That would be boring and predictable.  You never know what to expect with this series. Like in Season 1 where the little girl was in that barn all along and she walked out. I never expected that. And in this season when Rick's wife died.  Total bombshell! This season an entire new cast of characters is being introduced and skillfully interwoven with the old cast. Brilliant writing. TWD is the BEST show on TV, hands-down. Period. I hightly recommend it.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|This book is very good.  The author makes you care about the characters.  There is warmth and humor and romance.  The only bad thing is the f-word is used way too often.  It shouldn't have been used at all.
B0053O89Z6|5.0|well as a huge fan of this series, i am sooooooo glad that season seven is NOT the finale! although it does leave you even more confused at the end.. so much that at the last episode of this season ur going to 'literally' scream \\"noooooooooo!!!!!!!! i wanna see what happens next!!!!!!!!!\\" its a great season i enjoyed every episode and cant wait to buy the next season (8) as soon as it comes out on amazon :D
B004EBZX6W|5.0|I find this to be most useful. I especially like the section that shows the wifi channels. I was having a problem with my wifi internet radio constantly loosing the signal and I changed the wifi channel to one less used per the wifi analyzer and now my radio does not loose the signal. Way to go Wifi analyzer!!
B008ADSDHQ|2.0|Nesbos books were better tha this as they went forward. Confusing and boring. Could hardly finish. I see why this book was held back from the North American market.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Like the title says, its very addicting to say the least. Jetpacks, choppers, robots, scientists, lasers and dragons....what more could anyone ask for? I finished the game in five hours...I spent FIVE hours on this game. I like the fact that once you finish the game, you can cash in your completion for a medal and start over once again...
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great sequel to The Hunger Games! Just like the first book, this one gripped me. Follow Katniss as the &#34;Girl on Fire&#34; creates a spark and fans the flames!
B005LAIGZU|5.0|THE FOLKS WE WE HAVE DOING THE DIRTY WORK AND EXPECTING NOTHING SHOULD NEVER BE TAKEN FOR GRANIT,,,,,,,,GOD BLESS THEM ALL

B007FEFLTO|5.0|he has done it again,superb,when is the 3rd book of the trilogy coming,the Welsh can sing but this one can sure write a good book
B00A1ZW1JC|5.0|Unbelievable..that's all I can say..I was shocked at what happened in this episode.. I never saw it coming.. from what I hear there's to be 7 seasons of the Walking Dead..I hope and pray there's more than just 7..this show is awesome!!! Greg Nicotero and his crew does a fantastic job with the special effect..I mean just fantastic!
B009KHDT0C|2.0|Or should Burton have delivered more?  The story line is haphazard.  The writing is uneven - rarely witty, usually mundane, occasionally just silly.  The actors are so terribly self-conscious: \\"Oh, we are cute.  Oh, we have diddle-dee-dee cutesy makeup.  Oh, we are actually getting paid for this and we'll have a nice party soon as it's over.\\"  And worst of all (since I really do think Burton is a very thoughtful film maker), the directing is purposeless.  Burton, a talented cast is a terrible thing to waste.  But so is an audience.<br /><br />Well, it's not likely Tim Burton will read this, but you might.  Save yourself the few dollars.<br /><br />Two stars because it takes place in New England, which I miss more and more as winter approaches.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|The dry humor of this writer is super. Makes me want to meet him and join in his adventures. He is an everyday James Bond. A good read.
B008M34INW|4.0|It appears that this movie didn't get any theatrical release in the US , due to Mel's recent history no doubt...And that's too bad.  But this movie was pretty awesome!  Great story. Great action. Great acting.  I've read that the production team spent a lot of time on their research of El Pueblito Prison as well, which I think really shows.  Really liked it !
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game is so awsome and adicting that im on it all the time. i get mad when my kindle dies and i cant play
B003O86FMW|5.0|I didn't want the book to end. This will keep you wanting what happens next how will it all end. Straight up awesome book. Going to start book three in 1 minute!!!
B009NPKTN6|5.0|The time- the late 1980's; the place- Los Angeles; the cast- a small town girl who dreams of becoming a singer, a small town boy who would like to be a rock star, and a rock legend who still has a thing or two to learn. A great selection of songs are used brilliantly to help tell the story of these very human characters. The highly talented cast truly shines and surprises. This movie will take you back to the 80's if you lived them, or allow you to experience that time if you were not around yet.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|Movie was pretty good. It tied in well with the original Aliens movie. The acting was kind of weak in my opinion but everyone should be used to that now a days.
B009NQKPUW|1.0|This is not a review of the DVD. I'm sure it is quite delightful, however the movie sucked. I'll give it 1 star because of special effect. Not because they were good FX, just because they had some. (FYI - you can't give 0 stars). As other reviews have noted there isn't any science in their fiction. The tie in to the Alien movie(s) is really weak. What really bugged me was when the girl that did a caesarian to extract the alien and then hops off the table and runs down the hall. I took my wife 24 hours before she could stand up. I really laughed my A_ _ off of this. I guess the script for this movie must have taken say 10 minutes to write. It is obviously totally derivative of \\"Aliens\\", with more special effects, less story. Same spaceship on dubious company business, same robot as key perpetrator of said company business, same deserted planet, same dormant aliens waiting for dumb earthlings, same plans to decimate Earth, same baseball cap to prepare for the ultimate heroic sacrifice. Big change this time is that the spaceship lands in a direct line to the buried spaceships/aliens via a conveniently built road. The actors are a very mixed bag - Noomi Rapace is hard to reconcile as the mesmeric, energetic lead in \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" - her acting in \\"Prometheus\\" is wooden to the nth degree and her facial features are reminiscent of someone post root canal - the Novocain look. And her hair? How the remaining actors were able keep a straight face throughout is a mystery. And she was ready to jump into bed with the first BBMF. Utter drivel with sub-themes of religion and immortality - oh and the master race. I've seen Tom and Jerry cartoons that have better and more logical dialog - and by that yardstick - Homer Simpson is a thoughtful genius. This movie is yet another sign of the decline of Western culture, aided and abetted by Hollywood greed. The visual effects were stunning in Blu-Ray, but the story went nowhere - pointless is one descriptive word that springs to mind; another is contrived. The Prometheus plot is what I would expect from a low budget horror movie - this one just has better special effects. Perhaps the disappointment that the movie ended before the story was over stems from a less than subtle attempt to set the stage for a sequel? If that is the case, the effective cost of this entertainment is at least double - not an acceptable proposition - a movie must stand on its own, or be marketed as a series. I could not identify with any of the characters. Perhaps it is too much of a stretch to believe that all the highly trained and carefully selected scientists and crew would act like incompetent fools - they seemed bent on their own destruction, without any rhyme or reason.
B009RI4FRU|4.0|A very weird and surrealistic look at young obsession.  Good cast and well played.  It is quite stylized, so be prepared.

B009ZQGNPQ|5.0|The much anticipated Downton Abbey Series 3 starts in Spring 1920, carrying on from the superb Christmas Special which was set over the 1919/20 holiday period.

As usual, Violet, played by Maggie Smith manages to set the scene with some rather pithy comments. Martha has no time for the stuffy English and their traditions and is not slow to voice her opinion.

However, there are new challenges for Downton in the post war period and there has to be change for the estate to survive. The interaction between the family and those that serve them `below stairs' continues to be a rich source of story lines for the script writers and is a major contribution to the success of the show.<br /><br />Downton Abbey is the most successful costume drama from British TV since Brideshead Revisited some thirty years ago - and this is quite an accolade as they produce a lot of this sort of drama in the UK. Regular viewers of Downton will have been holding their breath wondering whether Series 3 could possibly keep up the very high standards of the previous episodes. However, we need not have worried and few will be disappointed with the latest series.

B007PFD90G|1.0|I looked forward to this book, but sadly disappointed. If I had read any of the authors earlier books, I would probably not have ordered this one. I was interested in the whole situation, remembering when all the fuss came out.<br /><br />I found the author utterly obnoxious. The constant name dropping was very tiring. This is not a person I would like. One star because I did find out what went on during the years in hiding. The guards, and the wives, have my sympathy.
B004GJXQ20|5.0|Been waiting for something \\"epic\\" to read again, and this is it.  Couldn't put the book down.  Can't wait to read the rest.
B003NFM3JK|5.0|I will never forget watching this movie for the first time in 3D at the theater. My eyes roved about the screen, trying to take in every minute detail - which was near to impossible. Some effects made me gasp and others made my jaw drop. Robert Zemeckis is one of my favorite film-makers simply due to his unique camera angles and approaches to scene setup. This movie satisfied me in every way. I left the theater with my mind whirring, still blown away by the entertainment. The thing I like most about Zemeckis' version is how he chose (unlike many other film-makers who have adapted Dickens' classic tale for the movie screen) to focus on the fact that the story really is, first and foremost, a haunting! Zemeckis' take on Dickens' story leaves viewers with less doubt of that fact than there should be doubt that Marley was as dead as a doornail!
B008NW67E0|5.0|I heard this group once on a TV special and was just amazed at how excellent they are, the CD is a perfect example of a revitalization of great music from a couple of decades ago, instrumentation was exceptional.  Great talented young men.
1595822003|5.0|By this juncture in your life, I don't care who you are, you are probably, at least peripherally aware of the story of Frankenstein. This review isn't going to really address the actual literary merits of this book. It's an enduring classic and legitimizes genre-fiction. It's good is what I'm saying.<br /><br />What should attract you to this beautiful tome is the fabric cover, white ribbon book mark, quality paper, and gorgeous illustrations by the masterful Bernie Wrightson. It's also a very large book too. It's a book that deserves to be prominently displayed in your home.<br /><br />Mr. Wrightson knows how to draw a forlorn homonculus. His black and white illustrations are substantial, full of emotion, and weight.<br /><br />There's also a forward by Stephen King, soooo why don't you own this book, friend?
B004FRX0MY|3.0|I downloaded this app to replace the same app on my  Pandigital tablet. The app became corrupt for some reason. It would not allow me to stream music and insisted I log in to my account. Of course my log in attempts met with a \\"Fatal Flaw\\" message. The Amazon help files were useless. So far I've had no problems with this app but I downloaded my favorite tunes to the tablet just in case.
B0006HJEMC|5.0|Very good toy. My son likes it. He love kits, Aspeccaily Revell. This is one small but he liked it because bulkheads were already put in for him to sink. So he put coins in it, it sank. i was disapointed that it does not include paint, making the model look ugly. But it is nice
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Perfect for anytime you're feeling stressed or need to fall into a deep sleep. I recommend it for any enviornment (with headphones if necessary) because it really does work. Can't imagine a good nights sleep without this app now!

0061765236|5.0|This is one of my favorite Jodi Picoult novels.  All of the characters were easy to relate to, the plot was flawless and you felt the heart wrenching pain of each character
B0092C2X7U|3.0|This game is so repetitive its not even funny. Not worth paying for, considering all you do is touch the screen four times and move on. It should definitely be free...
B009RI4ZKC|5.0|Wes Anderson and Bill Murray as well as the rest of the usual crew does such a great job on each of their movies and this is no exception.  Excellent entertainment!  If you liked Live Aquatic you will like this one and visa versa for certain.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|I saw this film in theatres and loved it. The set designs in this picture are most definitely Oscar worthy. The extras on this product went above and beyond my expectations. The documentary (running over 3 1/2 hours), the featurettes, the 2 audio commentaries (one by Ridley Scott and the other by the writers), the deleted scenes, and the photo galery will have you entertained for hours on end. I definitely recommend this title for people who are into the sci-fi genre or who are Ridley Scott enthusiasts. Easily one of the top three must have (in my opinion) blu rays of 2012. So what are you waiting for people? Go and get yourself a copy of Ridley Scott's masterpiece Prometheus the 4-disc collector's edition and enjoy the splendor and majesty of one our greatest visionary directors at play. Are you still in your chair reading this review? Come on people buy this movie!
0743454537|5.0|I've read quite a few of Jodi Picoult's novels.  This is one of my favorites, possibly because I was 16 or 17 when I first read it and I vehemently agreed that Anna should have the rights to her body regardless of what her mother wanted.  The first time I read it, I remember thinking that Sara must have been a monster because she seemed to feel no regard at all towards Anna or Jessie.  Her entire world revolved around Kate and trying anything to make Kate better at the expense of the rest of her family.  But each time I've read it, I feel that Sara is simply desperate and trying to make the best out of a bad situation.  What mother wants to not try everything that could keep her daughter alive?  Desperate people do desperate things..that is the best way that I can sum up Sara and her actions.<br />I do like how the book is written from different perspectives to show what each person is thinking, feeling, etc - that makes them more real to me, although for some people its just unneccesary \\"fluff\\".<br /><br />I though that the premise, the actual writing, and the research that went into this book was fantastic and I do highly recommend it
B008OOYALE|5.0|Dragon story is a fun game. People think that you need gold to buy certain dragons but if you continue to a certain level then you can breed dragons. You don't have to spend a penny on gold to buy dragons if you don't want to. Although to get a 2nd nest you need 250 gold pieces.

B000FC1MM8|5.0|Being a retired Southern California police officer I always enjoy a good cop story. Being familiar with LAPD and its political, almost incestous infrarstructure, Connelly's writing is on target. Bosch is successful in spite of the obstacles he encounters in the LAPD and elsewhere in the system and that is so very believable and correct. Connelly writes a good mystery that keeps your interest and provides reading pleasure. And, that is what a good writer should do.
B008MU8ZNO|5.0|It was late one night on a weekend I first saw Killer Klowns From Outer Space in junior high towards the end of the 90s. Ever since, the movie has been one of my personal favorites. Fast forward to 2012, I was happy to hear the movie was finally coming to blu-ray.<br /><br />What we have is a movie that, perhaps with an alteration or two could have been made in the 50s. A group of aliens who appear as monstrous clowns have landed on Earth. All these years, I'm still not quite sure what the Clowns' goal is--food perhaps--as they capture people using stereotypical clown or circus devices that are weapons. The people they kill are encased in material that looks like cotton candy, but the problem is we never actually see what exactly the purpose is for.<br /><br />Enter our three main characters, Mike, Dave who is a local police officer, and Debbie who is currently dating Mike but once dated Dave. Mike and Debbie stumble across the Clown's ship in the woods and make the discovery about the aliens and them killing people. They run to Dave who initially doesn't believe the two but soon discovers the truth. The rest of the movie deals with the trio evading the aliens and trying to stop them from killing the entire town.<br /><br />Sometimes I wonder if the movie was partially done as a homage to B-movies from the 1950s. I could definitely see it, if so. That's not a bad thing of course.I thought the movie looked well done on blu-ray. I also really like the cover of the blu-ray. I actually prefer it to the original VHS or DVD covers, somehow. The Clowns' makeup was also pretty well done. Even to this day, a few of them still creep me out some. All in all, it's a movie that's meant to just sit back and enjoy watching for what it is.
B005LAIHY0|4.0|I have always been a fan of Ridley Scott.  The first \\"Alien\\" movie really scared me and I always wondered if we would ever find out any details about the aliens.  Now we have and I really hope there is a sequel in the works for \\"Prometheus\\" because there are now questions that demand answers!

B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book made me use my imagination and gave such great entertainment while my BF played on his Play Station 3. I enjoyed the book and I cannot wait to read the next one. I am dying for the film version, but the book seems too steamy for the big screen. Book one and two are definitely MUST-READS.<br /><br />P.S. This book is better written and edited than the first book.
B008QOH1NG|4.0|I am a huge Stryper fan, and can accurately assess the band's performance.  This is a good performance.  Missing some of the little things, but nothing large enough to ruin the show.  If you are a die hard fan, than don't hesitate adding this to your collection.  If you are just getting into Stryper, than I would suggest that you order the [[ASIN:B000MV8ZZ4 Stryper: Greatest Hits - Live in Puerto Rico]].  That is a five star show, this one is a four star show.
1455519006|4.0|Who would not want to meet an assassin with a conscience?  I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book because it had strong characters,  and they were rather creative of finding ways to escape trouble.  It is a page turner and the plot is excellent.  It's one of those you can't put down because you have to know \\"what happened\\" next.  David Baldacci created a rather complex story full of twists and turns.  It is not perfect, but an excellent read otherwise.  There are certain parts of the book that were a little bit \\"unrealistic\\" especially the ending.  It seemed rushed, and almost \\"too good to be true,\\"  but the author did a good job of connecting the dots.  What I appreciate the most is his writing style.  He's very descriptive that a reader can actually feel the surroundings:  Eg.  market buzzing with people, sound of a bullet or a bomb exploding.
B00633W614|4.0|Archer has done well in advancing the story of his protaginists...and follows history pretty faithfully...can't wait for the last chapter....
B007RV5JLU|3.0|The plot line was okay. Somewhat weak and grasping. Samuel Jackson was not as strong in his performance as normal. Overall, wait for this to be available on Prime. Not worth the rental money.
B0092C2X7U|1.0|Despite being the free app of the day, I would not advise getting this app. It crashed my phone and is definitely not worth even being free
B008X8QCTO|5.0|I really like Alawar's games--they're always excellent at combining the hidden object parts with more global puzzle solving and fun plots. This game was deliciously creepy and not too complex (and the hint button can always help you if you're stumped).
B002G1YPH0|5.0|This cools my 2700k so nice.  I can OC it on air to about 4.5ghz without a hiccup.  I love this thing, easy to install once you figure out the instructions.<br /><br />I used some arctic cooling paste and it runs great.  It's sort of large but as long as it works.. I'm cool with it

B009329ZF2|3.0|Well, I rented this and found it to be kind of boring in a way, the action was ok but, and its my fault, I thought this movie would be a bit better in story line :-)<br /><br />I would watch it again if I wanted a silly action movie to watch but I wouldn't purchase it.

0316228532|2.0|Whew! Managed to slog my way through that!  I wouldn't recommend this book.  The first 100 or so pages, in particular, are just interminable.  Nothing is happening except the introduction of characters - ALL of whom are boring and annoyingly dysfunctional.  Also, the author is trying way too hard to prove that she can write an adult novel.  Unfortunately, her definition of \\"adult\\" seems to be simply crude and/or profane.  Things do pick up a tiny bit after that, but, in general, the book is simply tiring, ponderous and depressing.<br /><br />The real problem is the characters.  It took me awhile, but I finally figured out what was wrong with them.  In the Harry Potter books (and yes, yes, I understand completely that they can't be compared), Rowling displayed her talent for writing a good action story.  The characters, though, were not deep or complex.  There were basically the good guys and the bad guys.  (And, of course, since HP was written for young adults, the adolescents are all smarter than the grown-ups.)  In this book, there is essentially no action.  What little plot there is, is unrealistic - in particular the whole computer hacking scenario. This is a book entirely about the \\"character\\" of the characters and, sad to say, there is no depth or complexity here either.  Every single character is one-dimensional -- he or she is simply his or her dysfunction, and it's horrid.  500 pages of unrealistic, unlikeable people who basically do....nothing.<br /><br />One other oddity that English teachers would have a field day with is how much of this story is told parenthetically - usually background stories, but generally with no reason for it to be written that way.  It got so that whenever I saw an opening parenthesis I would stop reading and look to see how far away the closing paren was.  At first it was just a paragraph or two, but later some of these parenthetical remarks ran two or more pages!<br /><br />I saw J.K. Rowling interviewed just before the book came out.  She stated that she simply did not have the time of day for, and could not speak to, anyone who did not cry at the end of this book.  To which I say, what pure, unadulterated arrogance.  If you want people to cry at the end of your book, you first have to make them care.

0307592731|3.0|There is no doubt in my mind that Cheryl Strayed is one tough cookie to have hiked a significant portion of the Pacific Coast Trail alone.  Is it really a story of redemption, though, of self-discovery, of purification of soul, of coming to terms with \\"who I am\\" through a greater understanding of one's place in the natural world?  Or is it journal-writing, describing the somewhat self-absorbed idea of \\"finding myself\\" while hiking long periods of time alone? For me, it is the latter. Strayed is not a naturalist or particularly spiritual so I found her lack of wonder and fascination with the \\"wild\\" around her a big down-side to the book. Not that she doesn't describe what she sees and hears [though often sounding like it's from a guidebook and not from the her \\"core\\"]. It's more about what she did or did not do every day and becomes quite repetitive and deficient by not taking the reader to a wider appreciation of her/our interaction with the flora and fauna she is surrounded by.  This takes a far greater depth of feeling and stronger writing style than Strayed was able to achieve.<br /><br />I was swept into the story, however, worried about her reckless tendencies to hook up with weirdos [sounds like she was lucky too many times and thus I hope young women are not flocking to the PCT alone to imitate this trek!]  She had one nasty childhood and can't seem to accept her mother's early death. She's basically a troubling tenderfoot [in  more ways than one] that the reader is truly concerned about.  The interweaving of flashbacks works up to a point and then the reader is ready for Strayed to get to the meat of why she's up there on the PCT and achieve some kind of nirvana.<br /><br />The book could have used more editing [as seems to be the case almost universally these days. The writing is neither riveting nor strong enough. It needs a tighter premise and conclusion - I kept wanting her to say \\"Oh little me, what significance does any of this have in the scheme of things?\\"  From a Blackfoot Indian [and who had more respect for the natural world?]:  \\"What is life? It is the flash of a firefly in the night.  It is the breath of a buffalo in the winter time.  It is the little shadow which runs across the grass and loses itself in the sunset\\".  Now THAT'S a thought!ings?\\"  From a Blackfoot Indian [and who had more respect for the natural world?]:  \\"What is life? It is the flash of a firefly in the night.  It is the breath of a buffalo in the winter time.  It is the little shadow which runs across the grass and loses itself in the sunset\\".  Now THAT'S a thought!
B0041KKYEM|5.0|I received this item severely damaged. I expected no response, as is the usual handling with such matters. The DVD was completely playable, only packaging was destroyed. I could have gone through the refund procedure; however Amazon rose immediately to rectify the situation...  Black Swan is an excellent movie and highly recommend it to Natalie Portman fans and anyone inerested in fine productions. Natalie gives an outstanding performance into which is a bit of a psycho-drama, her dancing abilities show her devotion to always completely immerse herself into the part. I have been a devoted fan since her very first film. Natalie and AMAZON, you are the greatest!

B006LSZECO|4.0|I enjoyed the storyline....the twists and turns. But, the ending didn't feel like the end. I would have preferred a final ending. Other than that I feel it was very well written. I would definitely recommend this book to any that like a mystery to you books.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This brings back the memories of the quarter games of long ago.  It is fun to try and get the coins and the prizes to fall down for points.  Almost addictive !! I start my morning with this game just to spend a few minutes getting my mind awake.  Angles make all the difference in where you put the coins. You think you will be good to go for a prize or puzzle piece and then another big coin or bonus coin will pop up and you may lose your piece. But you have plenty of opportunities to get the next one.
B007O4XX9K|5.0|I first heard this album on my XM radio and I had to get it. Joe himself was going through his album and talking about the songs and how they came to be on this album.It is always great to hear the artist go through the album and talk about how the songs were put together.The stories behind the songs are the best. I would recommend this to anyone that is a fan of Joe Walsh and his music, either with the Eagles or when he was part of the James Gang. You cannot go wrong in getting this great songbook.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Grisham ist ein guter, routinierter und flüssiger Schreiber. Seine Helden bzw. Protagonisten sind in der Regel keine Supermänner sondern ganz normale Menschen - die allerdings immer etwas cleverer sind als ihre meist mächtigeren Gegenspieler. Sie kämpfen mit dem Kopf statt mit den Fäusten oder einem Schießeisen. Grisham kann Spannung auch ohne Brutalität, technische Wundergeräte oder esotherische Mätzchen erzeugen. Er hat es auch nicht nötig, seine Bücher mit explizieten Sexszenen anzureichern.<br />Hier allerdings übertreibt er bei der Konstruktion seiner Story. Dass der sehr komplexe Plan so reibungslos aufgeht, ist unglaubwürdig und erinnert an die Superman Konstrukte mittelmässiger Autoren. Aber in einem anderen wichtigen Punkt bleibt er sich treu: Auch im \\"Racketeer\\" hält er seinen chauvinistischen Landsleuten den Spiegel vor und zeigt ihnen, welche grossen Schwächen dass\\"großartigste Land der Welt\\" in Wirklichkeit hat - in diesem Fall ein brutales, mittelalterlichem Denken verhaftetes Rechts- und Vollzugssystem.<br />Fazit: Nicht Grishams bestes, aber dennoch ein spannendes, gut lesbares Buch, dass entgegen einem verbreiteten Irrtum nicht nur unterhalten will.
B009NPKTN6|4.0|While the story was basically just so-so, the music was great. Also, the characters and acting were both pretty good. Would buy a copy for my collection just for the soundtrack.
B001A5HBAG|5.0|I have never watched Mad Men and started with Season One on a plane with my Kindle. I grew up in the sixty's and it was so much fun to be reminded of the era from the clothing that my Mom use to wear to all the crazy cocktails my Uncle's would indulge in. Nothing but pure fun if you are a 60's child, or just want to remember the good old times.
B009JNXK88|5.0|this app is waaay better than most fps apps out there. if anyone knows what in talking about, its kinda like final ninja, but waay more badass. there are no ninja stars or ropes. what better way to waste your time then jumping off walls like a boss and flying kicking dudes (with guns) in da balls!!! i am an experienced gamer, and this platformer is wayyyyy better than most on the market. get it while its the faotd so you can kick them all in the faces, too!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Good sci fi story.  I did not want the book to end.  Look forward to further stories about the silos.
0812550706|3.0|People should read Ender's Game, but I am a little hesitant to recommend it.  It is good, but not as good as its reputation.  I am not a sci-fi junkie, so I don't care for the plot.  The writing could be better - in fact Orson Scott Card does get better.  What I like are the lessons.<br /><br />Of the lessons in Ender's Game my favorite is Ender as an example of self-reliance.  No one is coming to help Ender.  Even when games are rigged against him, complaining will do know good.  It seems a pretty fitting analogy for life; one that we often resist embracing.  Ender also provides a solution.  Without the hope of help, Ender masters strategy and leadership.  Ender goes far beyond the lame, \\"I am good at strategy and I am a good leader.\\" He masters them.<br /><br />Again, the book does has its virtues, it just isn't the greatest book of all time.  The last twenty pages are the weakest in my opinion.  There is a twist at the end, but it really isn't that mind blowing.  It is not like Fight Club.  Parts of the end seem forced, like he is trying too hard to set up the series.  Other parts seem rushed.  For me, the result was, I closed the book unsatisfied.
B008XG1X18|3.0|The app functions almost exactly like the computer version so is fairly easy to navigate. The app glitches either on startup or in the middle of loading new data and tells you there has been an error and the program needs to close. This happens every time I use it and is annoying.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Sorry, didn't see the part about 20 words or more. Thought it was a great book and opens your eyes to what went on in Iraq and just what SEAL training makes a person. All good.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|it is AMAZING!!!!!!i love it!!!!!<br />the weapons are cool the armor is cool and everything is cool.its as if god made this game himself
B008K5T5AI|3.0|Banks has been my favourite author of intelligent, witty and above all else, gripping Sci-Fi, since his eponymous \\"Consider Phlebas\\" all of 25 years ago.  Since then, I have read and re-read all of his Sci-Fi novels and some of his non-sci-fi novels. I have absolutely loved all of his novels to date. Except this one. Perhaps it is getting a bit much for Banks to maintain the concentration levels required to imbue his novels with a sense of depth, layering, hidden subtlety of meaning, which when combined succeed in conveying a truly masterful rendition of the big picture space opera that is the culture.  IMHO, this is distinctly lacking in his latest novel.  I won't pick holes in anything specific, as he writes too well to leave holes in his novels, gaping or otherwise. But I do feel compelled to comment on the following:<br />If the Gzilt are so close to subliming, why do they come across as just as petulant, greedy, ambitious, avaristic and genuinely unsophisticated as the rest of us? What marks them out as being ready to \\"sublime\\" compared to the rest of us?  Its like the biggest question in the novel, which is only vaguely hinted at. In fact, it is more a bald statement of fact, as opposed to a deep understanding as to Banks' own ideas on the issue, which I'm sure would be enthralling.<br />Still, all in all, would I recommend that you read it?<br />If you are a Banks fan, then how can you not?<br />If you are a first-timer reading his work, then I strongly suggest you do not start here.<br />So, have fun either way.<br />Slainte,<br />MarkO
B002PEP4SC|4.0|Just as flippant as the ABC series on which the series of novels is based. If novels are make believe, why not their creators? Great reading fun.
B004LP3AYI|3.0|Excellent follow up to Wizard's First Rule.  However, most of my reading was done on my iPhone kindle app and the text was plagued with missing text between page breaks, typos, and grammatical errors.  Not sure if this was a problem w the app or a problem with the kindle edition of the book.  Either way, was hella frustrating!
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|This is an excellent adaptation of the book. I was engrossed from the start. I had my doubts about Daniel Craig because I am so used to thinking of him as 007. He is great and Rooney Mara is fantastic as Salander.
B008GVD6D8|5.0|After reading 'Bared to You' and loving it, I had this pre-ordered & was counting down the days until it was released.  I was not disappointed.  I just wish the books were longer as I can read them in just one late night session, or wet day!
B000N2HCM4|1.0|If you wrote a book, you didn't get there on your own. You didn't get there on your own. I'm always struck by people who think, well it must be because I was so smart. They are a lot of smart people out there. It must be because I worked harder on the book than anybody else. Let me tell you something, they are a lot of hard-working writers out there. If you were successful, somebody along the line gave you some help (to correct the mistakes for example). There was a great teacher somewhere in your life (maybe not, in fact the reason you needed somebody to correct the spelling mistakes is because you went to a failed public school. Somebody Somebody helped create this unbelievable American system that we have that allowed you to thrive (no not the founding fathers but super LBJ. And before LBJ? Blank out) Somebody invested in roads and bridges. If you wrote a book (and sold it on Amazon) you didn't write that. Somebody else made that happen. The internet didn't get invented on his own. Government research created the internet so that all the companies could make profit out of the internet. (Journalist: Was Amazon standing on the side line with the idea of selling stuffs online but with no way of getting online? And was google waiting for the internet to develop with the idea of having a tool to search the internet? Obama: you are not part of the mainstream media, you? Journalist: I told you I was a journalist and I meant it. But anyway, I thought the internet was created by the government for the purpose of defense, not for businesses? Obama: Yeah but we don't use bayonets and horses any longer. Journalist: Actually we do)
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great way to pass time. Fun and competitive. Easy to navigate and understand. Really not much more to say. Try it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I absolutely loved it. Kept me on the edge of my seat!<br />Would recommend it to anyone and everyone !
B006XF5BTG|5.0|A few months ago, I decided to go back to working out and get my body to look the way I always wanted it to. Whenever I start doing something I try to learn as much as I can in order to get the best results through minimal effort. It's not laziness but a quest for efficiency.<br /><br />During my research, whenever it came to weigh training, the [[ASIN:0982522738 Starting Strength, 3rd edition]] book was always mentioned. It is indeed a great book and you can achieve great results by following its instructions.<br /><br />I've also read a lot about nutrition and supplements. The amount of information out there is huge and can be quite confusing and overwhelming. Again, I was looking for the most efficient path.<br /><br />Luckily, a few months ago, I heard about \\"Bigger, Leaner, Stronger\\" and how it was similar to the Starting Strength workout program. I decided to read it and I'm really glad I did. It is a practical application of Starting Strength, but more than that: it is a great source of information, very to the point.<br /><br />Michael Matthews delivers exactly what I had been looking for. The most straightforward and efficient workout and nutrition plan in one single book. This is that book, the one that condenses everything you need to know to get in the best shape of your life and know how to get there.<br /><br />Note: Michael explains all you need to know about nutrition, body training and supplements. Having this knowledge allows you to adapt and tailor either your diet or workout in case your expectations or needs change.
B00992CF6W|3.0|mine craft is okay.however it gets more credit than it should.it has no storylines or missions.you just go around and build.I wouldn't pay more than 4 dollars for this game.if you have a xbox and a kindle get it for the xbox because there are misssions and storylines for xbox.on a scale of 1to 5.this game is a 3 which means its okay but not great.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I have numerous projects that I am working on at one time and Evernote allows me to keep up with everything in one place. I love that I'm able to sync across all my devices. This is the best of the bet.
B008TMA1LY|5.0|great app. lots of fun. love it! I really love hello Kitty so this is fun for me. it is a must have for your android phone or kindle.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I greatly enjoyed this book! I will definitely read others by this author. She walks the line of giving you just enough information to keep you wondering, but also without it being gimmicky.
B0073COMUW|3.0|The color of the daylight is a fluorescent color. I'm not really happy with it, but I will deal with it considering the price of the bulbs.<br />Also, I ordered 3 but one came broken.
B0091REZMW|5.0|This game is absolutely amazing! The graphics are wonderfully designed! It's really cool, though while slow downloading somethings. Other than that, it's wonderful!
B007L3BMGA|4.0|Lot's of sex and drama. If you want to live in a dreamworld a few hours per day, you should read this. Unexpected ending.
B004KBSQOW|5.0|Great collection of some of IZ's best songs. Price is a little steep, but I guess it has to be because it's an import.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love live this game Apo its spool fun and there's spool many games! !!! download it you wont be dissappoined
B007EECSFA|4.0|I love Kate Morton's book.  she is an amazing story teller that keeps you guessing with every page.  I love the mystery of the past mixed with the present.  This story had an ending that I truly did not expect or even see coming.  It takes everyone by surprise, expecially the reader.
B007KOYEOC|2.0|This book is the worst of them all! Weren't we expected more S&M? The whole series is a bunch of \\"Does she/he love me? I'm gonna leave him! No I can't cause he's awesome in bed and has a lot of money\\"
B00003CXCQ|5.0|Bought this video for my three year old grandaughter.  Both she and my wife found it very entertaining.  The quality was very good, and condition was as advertised.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|I would rate this a must read! I adore Patricia and the Scarpetta series. My only bad thought is that this was not her best. I wanted the book to be more like the Body Farm and it was not, however saying that I still could not put the book down!
B004V5A7K8|4.0|fun game. the only drawback I've encountered is there isn't a key to explain what the dropped items do. It's easy to figure out once you've caught them... but if you get two green plus signs will you get the extended paddle for more time? What's the significance...or is there any?
B007KZY1YY|3.0|Well, I expected there to be more of the red room and less of the same there was in the first book.<br />Still the same lip biting and OOooohh, no does he really love me.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game it is so much fun I play it 24/7. it is the best game in the world
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|This is a great game until you reach a point where you just collect food and money in your own town or you can connect to a social network and ask for help.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|As great as the first two! I loved all the twists! The end was rather shocking and not what I expected!
B001JIHGO0|5.0|Even though this movie has been out for a while, I recently purchased it because it had two of my favorite actors:  Kate Beckinsale and Hugh Jackman.  Kate is absolutely athletic in this sci-fi classic.  Merging Frankenstein with Dracula was a stroke of cinematic genius.  The special effects are dazzling and spectacular.  The pace of action is relentless.  There is plenty of good humor in this flick, too, as the director makes you think about the scene unfolding in front of you.  This movie is not for the faint of heart, nor for the squeamish.  However if you like rough and tumble sci-fi, make ready the popcorn!!  Five stars, plus.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Amazon is amazing.  I believe my kindle is about 4 years old and the plastic on my charger cord had flaked and shredded off to the point where it was nothing but black electrical tape and basically dangerous!  One call to Kindle and they not only told me which cord to order (which was my original reason for calling), they gave me a credit in order to replace the cord and a credit if I needed it for shipping.  Total cost to me zero dollars.  Wonderful customer service from a wonderful company.  Way to GO AMAZON!!
0525423842|5.0|Have been a Grisham fan since his start, and look forward to everything he writes. Looking forward to reading the series on young Mr. Boone since the first one was such fun to read.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|This film did such a beautiful job of portraying the reactions that travelers have when they first arrive to India. Smelly? Yes. Crowded? Yes. Fantastic, enlightening, emotional, and delicious? Yes. I absolutely recommend this movie to any with a special place in their heart for any of the following: quirky British actors, curry, milk and/or honey, people over the age of fifty and/or Maggie Smith, or the movie Something's Gotta Give.
B0083EY9EI|5.0|Her voice is so beautiful, powerful, and almost haunting. Definitely a well put together album. You can actually listen to every track.
B006DRVFRQ|2.0|Thought it would be great to be able to read blogs and rss feeds on my kindle, and the description seemed to say this would work.  Maybe it does, but I haven't yet figured out how to make it work. Oh well.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Dr. Alexander is making a good case that consciousness is not synonymous with mind or brain. There is more to us humans than meets the eye. Spiritual seekers have suspected or known this for eons, but lovely to hear it from a scientific minded person. Nothing beats direct experience and he had some experience! Totally uplifting.
B009R8DHAQ|5.0|Great book re amend it to every kid age 12 but to understand it u will need to read the other books forst
0385338686|5.0|Hysterical ! I happened to be having a sad day when I went to my shelf to choose a book. This book was funny,sweet,and interesting to the very end. Feel good! Read this book.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I expected this book to be suspenseful, but predictable - it is, after all, the typical Dateline story: adorable wife goes missing, handsome husband tries to clear his name. It was that...and so much more! This book had me shaking my head at each twist and turn. Fun read!
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|...It Must Be Indiana Jones. Over 30 years later this tagline still rings true to me, recalling fond memories of growing up with these films and watching them endlessly. Even as an adult I have yet to find another franchise that captures my imagination and thrills me as much as this series can. I've been waiting for years for Indy to make the jump to Blu-Ray and I'm happy to say that, aside from a couple minor quibbles, he's done it with his fedora firmly in place.<br /><br />Most buyers are picking this up for the enhanced picture and sound, something that a majority of consumers should be pleased with. All four films look and sound better than ever, except for Crystal Skull, which is a repeat of the previous Blu-Ray release. It was already stellar and if you've already seen it then you know the picture and sound were top notch. The original three films are all cleaner and more vibrant than they've ever been, though I must admit the transfer didn't blow me away like I was expecting. The audio and visual quality is certainly better than any previous release and should be enough to satisfy anyone looking to update their collection. I guess I was just hoping for a bit more detail and clarity, something that older films like [[ASIN:B0074JOUHE Ben-Hur: 50th Anniversary Edition]] and [[ASIN:B001UHOWWY The African Queen [Blu-ray]]] did brilliantly. Don't get me wrong, they look great: just not quite as sharp as I was expecting.<br /><br />As others have already mentioned, the packaging itself looks very nice. The problem is that it's not functional and getting the discs out requires some additional effort. Blu-Ray discs are certainly more durable than DVDs but I have a feeling more than a few customers will experience some wear and tear with this set. It's baffling why so many companies can't find a safe way to bundle these sets while still making them aesthetically pleasing. It's a minor gripe but one that matters when you're spending this kind of money on something you love.<br /><br />If you're an Indy fan then this set is a must-have. The extras will definitely be of interest to any fan and the films look and sound better than they ever have. Adventure still has a name...and it's still Indiana Jones.love.<br /><br />If you're an Indy fan then this set is a must-have.

B0092C2X7U|5.0|its actually good and has replay value... and its free... sadly i bought this game on the Google play store a few days ago. wish I waited! you also have the option of not connecting online in game, so stop griping about it!
B002RI9TB4|3.0|Interesting and captivating read on author viewpoint of the African states.  Constantly wanting to find out how it ends, though left wanting.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I feel this movie is a must see for more mature adults. I say mature adults because I feel younger adults might find it dull or not \\"get it.\\"I found the dialogue to be extremely well written and the acting superb. As I finished watching this movie, I felt completely lifted-up and inspired by the stories acted out in the film. It left me with an important message learned, it being, \\"that you're never too old to start again, whether it be moving to a new place, making new friends or falling in love...<br />I felt that Judy Dench's performance in this film to be delightful!<br />[[ASIN:B009CPJHY4 The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel]]
B0034G4OYA|2.0|There's not a lot to like about this movie.  Hotel Transylvania reads like a movie that is supposed to appeal to adults while also entertaining children, but it fails to deliver at its core: jokes.<br /><br />Dracula is the proprietor of a hotel that serves as a getaway for monsters who are tired of beign pursued by mobs of humans.  Funny idea, but it's confusing at the start.  If the monsters are tired of being chased, where are they when they aren't at Hotel Transylvania?  Why didn't Dracula just build a place where they could live forever?  But setting that minor loophole aside, Dracula is supposed to be this misunderstood creature that only wanted to be left alone with his wife and child when a mob took his wife in a fire.  He's only a concerned father now, trying to protect his 100-something years young daughter from the menace that is humanity.  What he winds up being is a completely ball-less 'master' vampire who never bites anyone and is reduced to roaring at people when he gets upset.<br /><br />But it's a children's movie, you say, of course Dracula didn't bite anyone.  That's not my fault.  Sony Pictures chose to make a movie about a monster that couldn't do anything monstrous.  I mean, if Lionsgate chose to make a children's movie starring Leatherface, you'd be a little off-put if he didn't chainsaw anybody, even though you knew it probably wouldn't happen.  So I'm saying a children's movie about classic horror monsters is a mistake in and of itself.<br /><br />But since they insisted, well, what did work?  Adam Sandler's accent?  No, it made him cartoony to the point of silliness (again, I know it was a children's movie, but the accent just didn't work for me).  Jonathan was completely obnoxious throughout as was Mavis.  I was about to go through the list of characters, but it would just annoy me all over again.  I kind of liked Wayne the werewolf and Griffin the invisible man.  I enjoyed the zombies whenever they were on screen.  But I absolutely HATED the shrunken heads.<br /><br />And the jokes themselves seemed put in as an afterthought.  The poorer children's movies have a tell that reveals them as the weak movies they are- senseless violence.  Remember how the minions in Despicable Me would punch each other for no reason and remember how nothing like that ever happened to Toy Story (you should get that I didn't think DM was any good)?  Hotel Transylvania's tell was Dracula roaring at everyone.  It wasn't really funny, they went to it too often, and it didn't make sense why anybody was afraid after he'd done that.<br /><br />What did make me laugh, but struck me as undeservedly funny after I left the theater was near the end when Dracula saw part of a movie that was obviously a dig at Twilight with sparkly, shirtless vampire brooding in a forest.  Dracula makes a comment I can't remember about this being what people think of his kind even though Twilight's vampires actually eat people whereas Dracula doesn't seem to eat anything with a pulse in Hotel Transylvania.  It reminded me of what Roger Ebert said about Fun with Dick and Jane and the movie's lampooning of the failures of Wallstreet.  The movie just didn't deserve to make the joke because it hadn't earned it.<br /><br />I would give this movie 2 out of 5 stars and that's only because my 5 year old enjoyed it.the shrunken heads.<br /><br />And the jokes themselves seemed put in as an afterthought.

0307887448|5.0|Might be one of the best books I have read in a long, long time.  I loved every one of the nostalgia references and the entire world he built is completely engrossing.  I recommend this book to everyone I can.  I'm hoping Ernie continues to write (it would be a tragedy if he was one and done)- I've been checking his website and blog for a while and haven't seen a mention  of anything new he's working on in that direction.<br /><br />Believe all the other reviews and ratings that give this book 4 and 5 stars.  I just hope you have a lot of time on your hands cause putting down is gonna be a problem.
B007TK77QE|4.0|this is definitely not for the children! I think it is a jaded look at the new British social structure. The book itself is very difficult to put down, once you have started reading, due to the twists & turns in the plot. As with the Harry Potter books, the author is able hold the reader's attention fully. I thought it was a jolly good read.
0307341577|3.0|I really liked the book up until the end.  There was a lot of suspense all the way thoughout the book.  Then when you finally find out the truth and you want a good ending it just left you hanging.  I'm kinda wondering if there is going to be a sequal or if the author wants you to create your own ending....who knows.  Overall I liked the book, just not the ending.
B0088WFZQG|3.0|It was ok.  I just didn't have that something to pull you into the movie.  It was just average in my opinion.
B0087HT36U|4.0|fun game worth a dollar I would recommend it get this game hopefully the developers will create more levels there is not enough that is the only downfall
B009JNXK88|1.0|This is another jump game. Every level is similar to the last. When you have to retry a level you get a shadow of the previous attempt. You can end up with tons of shadow ppl to the point that you have trouble seeing what one is the current one. Poorly designed.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This was my first Kindle book. Great story and this one is better then the first one! Glad they are falling in love and it's not about the \\"contract\\" the whole time.
B0092C2X7U|5.0|this game is awesome...get it now, its funny, challenging, and just plain addicting trust me u will love it and will be constantly playing it
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this app it was fun and great and and and I I I I qloved it very much
0545265355|3.0|I have to say I read the first book and was thoroughly impressed. The suspense was breathtakingly well played out, it was gripping, nail biting, action packed drama. This series is by no means for the faint at heart.<br /><br />The idea that the world had fallen into decay, that barbaric games are played to control the communities, in general the direction of the books , is astounding. I find it a tale that can be paralleled on so many level to our own reality.<br /><br />However it's becomes apparent that Katniss is about as much of a heroine someone who walks down the street and watches an old lady get mugged and looks away. She is a sniveling, sooking irritation well and truly before the end of the second book.<br /><br />I was so disappointed throughout book 3- the story slowed right down. The action happened when Katniss was ALWAYS knocked out. So it could be explained easier, later.<br /><br />I found the live triangle to be a complete flop. Being the heroine in the story, I felt her \\"happy ending\\" was merely a woman just settling with what she got.<br /><br />I was disappointed greatly.
B0091REZMW|3.0|its a fun game but if you don't purchase diamonds it takes forever to get to far in the game.
B0086449YA|5.0|Mr.Knopfler always has his Celtic leanings but Privateering finds him exploring a dirty bluesy side. He's a maestro and can do what he wants and has the skill to handle any musical genre that he attempts and the wisdom to not attempt anything he doesn't command.  The CD is friggin great.  I bought it before I go to see him on tour with Dylan.  I have virtually everything the guy put out and I am a big fan.  Great CD
B008RDHYJM|2.0|If WEA really wanted to impress, the company would have released Kylie's top-selling singles and their remixes. The Girls Aloud set released a few years back did exactly that; all singles were accompanied by their mixes--some of which had been difficult to find. Although I admire Kylie and have followed her career from the beginning, why would I shell out a lot of money for songs I already own? There are two songs on each mini-disc--one on the last disc--and the box itself not nearly as large as the pictures would have you believe. (Makes sense, right? Mini-discs...mini-box.) The question I have: Why would I bother to dig through the box for a disc with two songs on it when I have the music already downloaded on my computer, etc?  In short, this item will do nothing but sit on the shelf. Not sure this dust collector is worth it. A rather lame way of celebrating Kylie's marvelous career.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I need help my minecraft thing works fine but it never turns dark but on my friends ipod it dose.
0679405496|3.0|Well, five stars for me lasting until the end, one star for the book. I've read classics I actually enjoy but this wasn't one of them, I don't care how beautiful the prose or profound the understanding of human nature.  I was thirty pages from the end and almost put it down but that would have been like quiting a marathon at mile 25.  I tried to be engaged, I tried to marvel at the insights, I struggled to untangle the language and to follow the conversations, I tried not to treat it like an old lady's doily.  Maybe the movie is better because this cries for a languid, immense cinematic treatment.
B00884GR0W|1.0|don't buy this for kids. there's no way to operate the thing and no good instructions at all. wasted my birthday money on this game.
B006CED4W4|1.0|This was without a doubt the single worst purchase I have ever made in my life. The episode was on par with what i expect out of sons of anarchy. The quality of the video I received from amazon for my money, was absolutely terrible. At no point did the sound match the video for more than ten to fifteen seconds. More than several times throughout the video there was a delay in both sound and video, and extreme pixilation. None of which resulted in the stream synchronizing the sound and video. I do hope nobody ever makes the mistake of purchasing another video stream from Amazon.com! I do hope more people continue to watch or discover the Sons of Anarchy however, its a great series that immerses the viewer completely.
B007SOQBCM|5.0|Please give this great app a feature to increase the video/stream quality.. it looks so terrible. I'm going to keep the app because I like it. the quality just sucks so badly! Please Make It Better!
B000I186FW|5.0|Loved it and would watch it again. Great story and great cast. Glad that I could got a chance to see it
B003G4W49C|5.0|I had not read any scifi in many years, but stumbled across a reference to Enders Game, so gave it a try.  Very well written, in contrast to most scifi I remember, with interesting character development.  An enjoyable read!
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|bad piggies is a very fun and addictive game that has given me hours of enjoyment BUT every time that I turn the game on after my kindle was on sleep mode all of the data from it dissapears. this has happened 4 times in 1 week.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Here you have a two disc set of pure awesomness. A movie with so much action, drama, and memorable moments that will make your mind explode with joy. Then when you think it is over The bonus materials (with its deleted scenes, gag reel, a short original film and other features) will pull your mind together just to rip it apart again. Simply Exellent!
B004D2A04M|2.0|A couple of months ago, I bought an Fenix E21 flashlight for work. As this appeared to be the only holder available, I ordered it. I found this holster to be well made but poorly designed. The swivle mount was more fluf than function as it kept rotating around. The flashlight required constant monitering otherwise it was upside down and trying to slide out. A simple pouch with a fastening flap would have been much better.
B001DRF84W|4.0|in my opinion i liked this hulk better than the 2008 version simply because he seems much more powerful. The 2008 hulk had to use a little muscle to tip over a humvee while this one grabs a tank, spinns it around a couple of times and throws it hundreds of meters away. Now that is a HULK. This movie truly deserved a sequel instead of a remake.
B004FOA84A|1.0|there seems to be clear indications that story continues and there are furyher items to find but after continuous clicking on every part of with nothing else happening there is no hint button to steer in right direction ...after days of trying to figure out next move i want my money back.
B00846REIS|5.0|Bared to You blows Fifty Shades of Grey out of the water, by far! This book will have you reeling till the very last page. A MUST read!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I have really enjoyed this.  I have preordered book 3  due out in may.  I wish I didn't have to wait so long.  I really suggest these books if you like romantic novels.
B0092C2X7U|1.0|Please do not download this. The game is garbage. The permissions are invasive and the fake reviews make me sick.
B002VHI8J0|4.0|Every now and then an author comes along and re writes the rules. As much as I love my prefered type of books. Cloud Atlas shook me up. turned me upside down and inside out. Fantastic, just what we all need every now and then. Can't believe it took me so long to get too it

B00846REIS|5.0|Great storyline and detail. Love the fact that Eva isn't some fragile, spoil ed brat. She has a backbone and it's refreshing!!!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Really good story...the writing isn't the greatest but the story is captivating.  Couldn't put it down and now that I'm finished, I'm sorry it's over.
B0055SWM08|5.0|it took a while before I thought it was a fun game but now I cant put it down until I beat every level
B0083P1QUM|5.0|I ordered The Bone Bed early for my Kindle.  Scarpetta is at her best again!!  Suspence, danger, clues, meticulous post-mortem, and, best of all... Our relentless heroine has brought a frequently overlooked problem in mystery books I have read.  The effects on wildlife when people hide bodies, trash, pollutants in our rivers, lakes, creeks, and forests.  I will remember forever the poor giant reptile that Scarpetta diligently freed from human snares!
B008J34466|5.0|I really like this album, while I don't love all of the songs I do love most of them; they're cheeky which is how I picture P!nk. To me it seems like you can actually HEAR P!nk singing and this album to me proved she can sing not just spit out an album like many ahem \\"singers\\" do these days; she actually has tallent. My Mum who doesn't usually like female singers loves track 3 - Try  after seeing P!nk perform it live on X Factor Australia. All I can say is keep doing what you do you are awesome.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|love this game it keep you guessing and love the story behind it everyone should try it its great even my kids love to play
B007L3BMGA|1.0|Répétitif, rébarbatif, ne surtout pas acheter ! De personnages principaux sans charme. Des invraisemblances.. bref, un cadeau à ne surtout pas mettre sous le sapin
B004FRX0MY|2.0|This app worked well for a while but recently it has stopped syncing my purchased music and therefore this app no longer serves any purpose for me. If this issue is fixed then I would give this 4 stars.
B00000DRYH|5.0|This album contains some of the greatest songs ever written by Steve Perry and Jonathan Cain. They were the best writers of the 80s. Open Arms is by far the most beautifully written song. Its melody is from the heart and the meaning of the words is what good songs are all about. Steve Perry has been and always will be the voice and face of Journey. Journey is nothing without him. No disrespect to Arnel but Steve can never be replaced.
0143117009|4.0|the book collapse, how societies choose to fail or succeed is a great book, cannot wait to finish reading it, I received it as good as new also.
B0098VYKSA|4.0|I enjoyed watching this movie and would watch it again.  I love the fairy tale themes and its great to see them brought to life again in these times with new technology in movie making.

B009ZQAN9I|5.0|Many twists and turns!A very wild episode to say the least.we were not expecting the shocking ending.The doctor is a strange individual.can't wait till this week to see what is next!
B004V5A7K8|5.0|I think it is a little bit like block buster.It has the same rules and everything.I think that block buster got a 5 star rating from me also.
B009WJWE7W|5.0|a real edge of your seat kind of episode.I like it so far!<br />my wife and i will certainly be watching more.

B008XNZMOU|5.0|Taylor Swift is my all time role model and this album definitely is one of her best ones yet! I highly recommend it!
B0083P1QUM|4.0|This was as usual a well written book full of forensic clues and tons of information about esp. dead bodies, but in this case also live turtles!  However, this book felt rushed and not as fleshed out as her previous work.  Just the same it was better than most modern novels.  I simply wish she would spend a little less time fretting about the people she cares about.  Enough!
B005LAIHXQ|3.0|Great special effects were to be expected but the character developement leaves much to be desired. As a Ridley Scott fan, I am extremely disappointed by the number of questions raised and the lack of resolution to ANY of them. Are there 2 factions of architects?What was up with the programing and agenda of the \\"Artificial Human\\"?Architects visiting developing humans and leaving clues for what purpose? How many different types of genetic material are stored, or are they all the same? Why would Architects need a weapon? These are just some of the questions which remain unanswered. Prometheus II? Not really interested! Too many possible back stories and outcomes and all that I can imagine seem unrealistic and inconsequential.The ship Prometheus should have never left earth it was  a waste of their time and mine!
B005ZKYXZI|4.0|Originally saw this movie via internet streaming and I liked it so much, that I purchased the Blu-Ray DVD version for my movie collection.  For me, this was a very entertaining movie.  I definitely recommend it.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|yipee Angry Birds! I don't have a cell phone so I've been coveting this game ever since my niece showed me how to play. Thank you for offering this on the new Kindle Fire HD, loving it. 5 stars.
B004SVM7BW|5.0|My first kindle and chose repligo pdf reader - love the different features. I can make comments and notes, change the color I just love it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|After my inital suprise of finding a wonderful short story that had come into being through independent on-line channels, I found the rest of the story moving swiftly with suprises and revelations in each book. Set in blighted world, survivors scratch for survival in an underground \\"silo\\" I found the characters well rounded and the world building believable. It's a fun read and I know we fans always want to \\"see what happens next\\" but I think it may be good to leave this world for a while and let the author develop. I have high hopes.
B000TO0TCQ|5.0|It took me forever to find this book. It was totally worth it. Once I started I couldn't stop. Completely shocking beginning to end.CRAZY ending
B0076DCT2G|2.0|I waited patiently for this book to come out and read it rather quickly. Too much wisecracking by Corey, not enough involvement by Brenner and in the end the \\"set up\\" and plot were just a bit over the top.<br /><br />If you are going to bring two characters together (Corey and Brenner.....3 counting Mayfield) you just have to do it better than my fellow Long Islander. (Michael Connelly does it much better)<br /><br />Book was almost as disappointing as \\"The Gate House\\".<br /><br />Demille is now overdue for another Gold Coast or Plum Island....not going to hold my breath.
B009VSW15Y|4.0|.... so long as you remember the KFHD only has a 1.3MP camera so 'HD' will be HD of images produced with a 1.3MP camera - in other words, a bit grainy, but this app does seem to capture images and video adequately.<br /><br />The only problem is when I transfer the videos to my PC they only play correctly in Quick Time - even then the short test video I made was a bit jerky. In VLC and in Windows Media Player the test video content I shot played upside down. I know the developer reads these comments so if he can fix I'll update my review and up the star rating.<br /><br />Overall, recommended!<br /><br />UPDATE 26 Nov 2012<br /><br />Vastly improved since the developer updated the app a couple of weeks ago. This app now makes the camera on the KFHD really useful. I'll update again when I have more time. Thanks to the developer who listens to his customers :)
B00992CF6W|5.0|wen I got this game I was so exited the min it installed I played the gameand it was so good
B0034DGPEU|2.0|I guess I should have known from the sample that this book was not for me.  When it starts out with a hanging, it can't be good. Everything about this book was disturbing:  incest, rape, murder, violence, horrible mental institutions.  Maybe all that really was the way life was back then, but if I really want to read about it, I would rather read the non-fiction historical version. How can anyone make up anything that sick?
B008LSVLZG|5.0|An amazing purchase! Appropriate for both those who missed seeing the tour live and those, like myself, who just can't stop living it. Steven Wilson has gathered an awe-inspiring collective of musicians whose talents, along with the excellent directing of Lasse Hoille, truly bring to life the heart of this tour which featured the perfect marriage of music and stagecraft. Get All You Deserve is a uniquely spiritual experience that will tap into the full, stunning spectrum of human emotion.
0316017930|5.0|This books makes a powerful and thought-provoking argument about what shapes success. First, it is our environment, and everything in it: our socioeconomic background, style of parenting, school or lack thereof, all the way to the centuries that shaped the culture of a country we grew up in. Second, there is an enormous luck factor, such as being born at the right time of history or right month of the year (super powerful argument! I want to have my kids born between January and March, never afterwards). In one sentence: everything counts, and sometimes the elements of \\"everything\\" are so minuscule they get ignored altogether. Fascinating stuff.<br /><br />\\"Outliers\\" are also said to leave the reader with an uncomfortable, negative impression that the script for everyone in this world has been written by their environment, including parents, social class and cultural heritage. Not the case with me: while I accept the wealth of statistics as true, I believe an individual can defy them (and perhaps is better suited to do so after reading this book). Just look at the story of Korean Airlines, one of the cornerstones of \\"Outliers\\".<br /><br />After my first meeting with Malcolm Gladwell, I'm left much more convinced by his arguments than I though I would be. Recommended.
B006P0FD4W|5.0|If you like the series then this one is very good. I saw PA 4 at the show and its not as good as 2 and 3. If you are not sure about buying it then rent it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I like minecraft .it is awsome . you should do a update that makes it more like computer and X box 360
B0050PYNP8|5.0|Okay first of all if you have a problem with cussing in your movie do not buy this movie. If you don't then its a funny movie. Paul is defintinely not a typical ET. I would say for anyone over 18. If you are still not sure just rent it. I bought it and its a good movie.
B005Z271Y6|5.0|You don't even have to love Adele to make it worth buying this live concert DVD (although, who doesn't love Adele? Hello?) This woman's talent never ceases to amaze. Her live performances of all the songs you would expect, and maybe a few you wouldn't, do not disappoint. You will laugh and cry along with her as you hear her personal and emotional commitment to her music and in her performance. Also the CD included is great because it is simply just the songs, none of the talking in between. But don't get me wrong, Adele is pretty entertaining in her small talk between songs. If you're thinking of getting this, DO IT!! You won't regret it.
B000I9YWDO|5.0|This is in my top 10 of favorite movies ever. It's just a all around funny movie. I think we can all relate to these guys and their jobs and how much they hate it
B007HC3LHS|4.0|Love the story.  But it was difficult to keep everything straight when you were going from the past in one chapter to the present in another.
B0051XSKSU|5.0|I avoided watching Kung Fu panda because it had Jack Black.  Sorry, I just did not think I would like it.<br /><br />But when an actual Kung Fu master tells you he watched it and liked it.  You tend to open your mind.<br /><br />This is not only a fun movie about accepting who you are, it actually talks about and demonstrates the true beauty of martial arts.  A lot of which will probably go over the 10 and under heads, but I still appreciate the positive message.  It's so rare in movie these days to see that with out it becoming to drama heavy.<br /><br />Side note:  I do not appreciate the W.O.W commercials making me think a KFP 3 was coming out.  Don't toy with emotions like that.  ;)
B000YJ85BI|4.0|I read the first 2 books and finally picked this one up. Very enjoyable and I look forward to reading some more of this author's books.
B0085RQLXK|4.0|If you are like me, you have been a true Aerosmith fan for the longest time and since their heyday, which was when they had the number one pop hit in 1998, for the movie Armageddon. I have always loved this pop band, and my love for them grew even more when Steve Tyler began to host American Idol, which as any real Aerosmith fan knows is what truly makes a hardcore, classic pop band like Aerosmith highly credible. I'm also overjoyed to hear that Aerosmith reunited because, a few years back, I got the shock of my life when I read that they were breaking up!!! Thank goodness that Joe Perry totally came to his senses and apologized to everyone else in the band for trying to go solo with a fledgling rap career!<br /><br />Anywho, I think that Music From Another Dimension is just what the 2012 failing pop scene requires in order to increase music sales for this very unpopular genre of music. After all, with country and alt-metal ruling the charts for the last few years, we can all use a little classic pop salvation in the form of Aerosmith, right, people? Am I right, or am I right?!<br /><br />One of the best songs right off the bat on this CD has to be Angel, which is very original-sounding and which is a song I will likely never, ever get tired of--even if it ends up being played to death on Top 40 radio...it is that friggin original. Another sweet treat from the AARP readers and Social Security recipients in Aerosmith is the fantastic song by the name of Crazy, which to me doesn't sound at all like it will be about two l/e/s/b/i/a/ns. If I may suggest something here...I mean, only if it's alright with everyone here...I think the music video for Crazy should include Alicia Silverstone and Liv Tyler playing l/e/s/b/i/a/ns. That would be very family-friendly and not controversial in the slightest.<br /><br />Other b/u/t/t-kicking songs on this CD of pop awesomeness are Freedom Fighter, LUV X/X/X, Street Jesus and Out Go The Lights. I find that all of them capture the pop essence that is Aerosmith. For instance, Freedom Fighter is a cover of Creed's song Freedom Fighter from the early 2000s (still not as good without Scott Stapp yarling his little, non-sober heart out), and LUV X/X/X is about Steven Tyler's love for free p/o/r/n sites on the Internet, I think. Street Jesus probably won't be well-received by black Americans because it takes the Lord's name in vain, and since many blacks are Christians, they will probably hate that song, which is okay with me. Finally, Out Go The Lights is what happens when Superstorm Sandy comes along and cuts off your electricity.<br /><br />As a big Aerosmith fan, I am very enthused that the 60-something boys of Aerosmith are one unit once more. I hope that they will continue being one unit for decades and decades to come.essence that is Aerosmith.

B000FC1PFW|4.0|Exactly what you expect from an Agatha Christie mystery.  Find myself trying to solve the mystery along with Hercule Poirot.
B005NACYQU|4.0|Strange and long yet oddly satisfying. I mean, the book didn't connect with me on an emotional level at all but on an intellectual level, from an interest perspective it connected like a punch to the gut. Gods and myth and legend and systems of belief have always fascinated me, and this book brings it all together; which, I believe, is both its strength and its weakness, because by trying to fit the pantheon of gods in, focus on the main character is lost for much of the book, which does leave you wondering where the book is going, if anywhere, at least on the first time round.  What it does do, though is bring everything together at the climax and doesn't leave you right away but takes you on a necessary and therefore satisfying denouement in the epilogue and subsequent postscript. It was interesting. I think I need to read it again sometime. Three and a three quarter stars for interest and intellectual fulfillment and enjoyabillty.
0385535147|2.0|Hoped to enjoy this as an audiobook while driving my daughter across the US, but neither of us could stand it, so we gave up half way--and that was a long half-way since I was sure Grisham would pull it together.<br /><br />First I thought, well this is just a slow moving novel. Then I thought, but the plot is so limited, maybe it is a documentary/true-to-life story and he is restricted by what happened in reality. When I googled that it is fiction, I was dumbfounded.<br /><br />People say he brings it together in the last few pages, so I recommend you just read the ending and call it good if you happen into this long (there goes Utah), dull (there goes Wyoming), boring (there goes Nebraska), disappointing (there goes Iowa) excuse for a novel.  (P.S.:  I toned this review down as much as possible ;(
0765357151|4.0|Was a good read for sure but nothing like the movie at all if you watched the movie first like I did.  It was so different I actually don't know if the director of the movie even read the book at all lol.  Still worth reading though and was actually glad it was so different because it would have been boring if it was the same as the movie.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|Fun game but I got almost to the end and it wouldn't load anymore.  Had to uninstall it and lost everything I had done. Was not happy with starting over.
B004QX07G4|5.0|Ellen's new book put a smile on my face from page 1.  I couldn't put it down!  The chapters are so random in the most hilarious ways.  But amidst all the laughter she also made me think.  She inspires her readers to be better people.  Reading this book also made me go back and buy her very first book.  This book was so worth the money.
B002ZG99CC|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo3JH8TALGH2IB1]]*Spoiler Alert*  I loved this movie and explain what it is that really caught my attention in the video. I talk about a specific scene and how I believe it is a metaphor for life.  So if  you don't want to know about the scene ahead of time, don't watch my video review. All in all, I thought this was an excellent movie for the whole family.
B008OOYALE|5.0|a bit tedious with the constant coin collecting, but its entertaining none the less. the dragons are very adorable, especially how they are constantly in motion and flying about.
1607066017|5.0|Not what I was expecting. Some of the pages made my stomach turn a little, some made me laugh, some made me a little misty-eyed.<br /><br />At the end, though, my thought was \\"excellent, when do I get more?\\"<br /><br />Definitely worth a read, especially at this steep discount. Also definitely not for kids!
B004FGMDOQ|3.0|I decided to get this after seeing the reviews that said if you like the Hunger Games you'll like this book. I loved the Hunger Games and this book does not even compare.  The pictures are cool and the story line is ok, but it does drag quite a bit until you get into the heart of the story.
B0036S4CTS|4.0|Interesting characters with some originality in story line.  This book was recommended by a friend and was an enjoyable read.
B003ZSJ212|4.0|People get all up-in-arms about changes made to the original trilogy.  I don't much care, it's all good! My complaint is only with the price- you shouldn't have to pay a small fortune to get this product. The visuals are great, the sound is great, the price.... not so much...
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This is one of the best games of this sort.  Much more detailed than others I've played.  I'm hooked on it.

1451696191|2.0|I am not quite sure what to think of The Perks of Being a Wallflower. Everyone says: \\"This book has changed my life.\\" and \\"This book tore my heart out and left my feelings all over the floor.\\"--but no such thing happened to me while reading it.    When I first opened it and saw that it was written in 1999, I was expecting an amazing novel because I am a die-hard 90's fan, but by the time I was a quarter into the book, I found that I was only still reading it so I could finally get it over with.  Every other sentence seemed to be:    a. \\"And then I started to cry.\\"    b. \\"Then, I went to the The Rocky Horror    Picture Show.\\"    c. \\"I don't know why...\\"    Now don't get me wrong, Stephen Chbosky did a wonderful job setting up the characters and the idea of writing to an anonymous person through letters was genius.    I am not sure if Chbosky meant to do this, but I felt like the main character, Charlie, was autistic. I Googled this and found that many other readers felt this way also. If Charlie was meant to be perceived that way, then kudos to Chbosky for getting that characteristic across. This book's whole premise is alcohol, drugs, and sex--which I think is not accurate for the freshman in highschool that Charlie is--but maybe that's how life was in 1991.    Would I recommend this novel to anyone? Sure. I feel like it is a book everyone should read because of its different style of writing and it is interesting despite it's flaws.

1407409395|2.0|\\"...if I agree to publish an idea like this...it'll kill your reputation. You're a Harvard historian, for God's sake, not a popshlockmiester looking for a quick buck.\\"<br /><br />\\"Renowned Symbologist\\" Robert Langdon was supposed to meet Jacques Sonier one night; instead, he gets called to the Louvre, the scene of Sonier's horrific death. Langdon spots clues to Sonier's murderer everywhere, which makes the French police officer, Fache, immediately think that Langdon is the murderer. Fortunately, sexy Sophie intervenes to shunt Langdon away. And then they are off, trying to avoid being arrested, trying to find the \\"Grail\\", and trying to discover who killed Sonier.<br /><br />NOTE 1: My French is atrocious; expect misspellings everywhere.<br /><br />NOTE 2: Light spoilers to follow.<br /><br />This book has been quite controversial. A lot of Christian and Catholic churches have been up in arms about the claims Dan Brown makes in this book--namely how Jesus married Mary Magdalene and how the Church will stop at nothing to try to conceal this \\"horrific and world-altering\\" religious conspiracy.<br /><br />Let's get this out right off the bat: I don't know if Jesus was married. Tradition has it that he was not, but since I wasn't there, I can't say for certain. All I know is that, if I learned Jesus was in fact married, I would probably be surprised, but I'm not going to suddenly abandon my faith just because of Jesus' relationship status. And while this may create a bit of controversy if it ever does appear to be true (I think there was a recent article that gave more evidence to this), I think a lot of people are just going to believe that it's all a bunch of lies, like they do with evolution. Good grief, stop making mountains out of molehills.<br /><br />\\"Controversial\\" non-controversy aside, this was an absolutely unintentionally hilarious book. Characterization is astonishingly bad, the pacing is dull, the clues somehow end up between too easy and too difficult, the mystery is snooze-worthy, and the narrator's over-the-top French accent sent me into gales of laughter.<br /><br />Our main characters are Gary Stu and Mary Sue--I mean, Robert Langdon and Sophie Noveau. Langdon is one of the most boring male protagonists I've had to read in recent history. I love how he supposedly looks so \\"bookish\\", with descriptions like this:<br /><br />\\"His usually sharp blue eyes looked hazy and drawn tonight. A dark stubble was shrouding his strong jaw and dimpled chin. Around his temples, the grey highlights were advancing, making their way deeper into his thicket of coarse black hair. Although his female colleagues insisted the grey only accentuated his bookish appeal, Langdon knew better.\\"<br />George Clooney anyone?<br /><br />It was painful how every character had to clamor on and on about his \\"accomplishments\\" and how \\"intriguing\\" he is, or how the ladies' panties get all wet when he enters a room. If this is not male fantasy, I don't know what is.<br /><br />The weird thing is, when it comes to actually solving the clues/mystery, Langdon is a moron. He spends so long talking about history, symbols, sacred feminine (I got a load on this one...), but he seems severely stumped when trying to solve a few clues. The worst was the mirror-image English. Do you seriously mean to tell me an American can't recognize mirror-image English? I, a measly engineer, experimented with reading mirror-image English and had no problems.<br /><br />Meanwhile we have the set of boobs, Sophie. Don't expect her to have a personality or purpose besides being a set of boobs to get captured. I think Sophie is held at gunpoint 800 times in this book. She is even dumber than Langdon, despite being a talented cryptographer. She cannot solve any of the puzzles on her own, even though her own grandfather wrote them.<br /><br />The rest of the cast was goofy and 1-dimensional. Fache might as well twirl a mustache for all the good he does. I had no clue what Arringarosa's purpose in the story was. Silas' Sally Sob Story was so overwrought and cliche, I was laughing at his self-flagellation. And Teabing...good God, Teabing. I have no idea how to classify Teabing. Other than I kept imagining Sir Elton John, and I'm not sure that was the \\"characterization\\" Brown was going for.<br /><br />But you know, a lot of thrillers are more about the puzzles and mystery and action than the characters. I can buy that. But you also know what? The puzzles, mystery, and action are horrible. The puzzles tend to be the same type over and over and over again. They also seem to somehow be way too complicated (such as translating one word into Greek, doing an anagram, then translating to English???) and way too easy at the same time. There really is no mystery; there are so few characters, that it's pretty obvious who the Teacher is about halfway through the book. And the action? PAH! None, or very, very sparse. Most of the book is long, boring talking scenes where Teabing and Langdon try to out-Wikipedia each other. I'd rather go to Wikipedia and read THAT then read the mangled facts here.<br /><br />The other thing that drove me bonkers was how EVERYTHING, from Walt Disney to Sir Isaac Newton, from playing cards to the Mona Lisa, was about the Sacred Feminism. I don't doubt that the Sacred Feminism had its influence, but come on! It's like Brown randomly threw in artwork or famous people to be a part of his stupid conspiracy theory.<br /><br />And the narrator! Good grief! A Geoffrey Harding narrated my copy, and he had the worst accents I've heard in a long time. Sophie sounded like a moron; the French sounded so ridiculous, I had to stop the iPod to laugh. And Harding reads everything in this movie trailer voice that makes the book seem so much more important than it is.<br /><br />If you want a smart, intelligent read, don't go here. If you are expecting Indiana Jones style adventure, I think this is just too slow-paced for you. If you are looking for a Buddy Read to snark over, you've come to the right place!!<br /><br />Brought to you by:<br />*C.S. Light*'s purpose in the story was.

B005BX3NAA|5.0|I am very happy with this CD. The description was very accurate and the songs and sound are great.I had forgotten how much I like Guns and Roses.
B004V5A7K8|3.0|Awesome game BUT... I am so annoyed because I can't save my game so if I must leave the game I start back at Level 1. Please update.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Cuando no puedes dejar un libro y quieres conocer lo que va a suceder el siguiente capitulo , cuando estas intrigado por  las inesperadas y sorpresivas acciones del narrador, sabes que est as enganchado. Una obra  encantadora,  seria extraordinario  over una version cinematografica de James Cameron.
B00005J6T1|5.0|This was the first Madonna album and to date, her best, most fun stuff.  Go back to your roots, Madonna!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Fantastic book, couldn't put it down. I read it on my Android Kindle...2 thumbs up. Can't wait to read the next two.
B003PTP4S6|5.0|Omigosh... this music is so fantastic ... it actually lifts me to a different plane!  I could listen to it all day .. absolutely stunning performance!  Perfect arrangements by Ennio Morricone, and believe me, Petunia absolutely soars! I want to share this music with everyone .. how could anyone not love it!
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|Heard the hype, like everyone else in the states, but wasn't too interested in it.  Haven't read the book, but finally caved a week or two ago... there's gotta be something to the talk, right?  Well, it turns out to be one of the most surprising movies.  Not because of superb acting, awesome visual effects, or extraordinary cameos (although I didn't expect Natural Born Killers dude to be in it).  It was surprising because of the unassuming, \\"natural,\\" nonchalant way with which the kids in the movies killed each other.  I understand that it is part and parcel of the world that the movie depicts, but I didn't expect it to be just so in a movie that seemed to be squarely marketed at young children.  If I were a parent, I would not want my child seeing this movie, unless they were 15+.<br /><br />That aside, the movie isn't great, but the movie doesn't totally suck.
B0011Z1BSS|5.0|Great album to realize just how talented and diverse Led Zeppelin was! All of My Love to Hot Dog, this album produces. The whole albums is great to listen to. From beginning to end. I just wish the album was longer. And In The Evening is great listening.
B0085WA9OM|5.0|I didn't buy Paul Simon's Graceland album when it came out twenty-five years ago, but I continued to hear various songs from it with decreasing frequency as the years rolled by.<br />When the anniversary album came out I started to hear more cuts and saw more of Simon on TV and the Internet. This time instead of just promising myself I'd \\"get that one of these days\\", I pulled the electronic trigger.  You can't roll back the clock, but listening to this album was very close. In a positive way. Great lyrics, remarkable instrumentation, and wonderful rhythm throughout helped me joyously overcome my twenty-five years of neglect.
B008OOYALE|4.0|this game gives you the ability to train and raise dragons there is a few bad parts just as you have use real money
B009NQKPUW|3.0|Visually appealing although when you really think about the philosophy of it, it's really depressing.  Plus there's some rather cryptic scenes.  All in all it's just a \\"meh\\".
1619692376|5.0|Will Robie is the man Christain Gray wanted to be!  He's courageous, intelligent, compassionate, and empathetic.  I hope to see more of him in future novels. Baldacci continues to be my favorite author... never a disappointment!
B00936A0ZW|5.0|Like the latest PG a lot! Excellent combination of jazzy blues rock gems here. Great production as well. Nice change of pace for Paul. The usual excellent muciscianship- great piano and outstanding drums. Definately worth adding to your collection.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Awesome game. There are no glitches. I love the game. The game is kid friendly also.  I love the game!
B00A1ZW1JC|5.0|I am not going to spoil this for those who have not watched this episode or show. I just want to say that I was blown away with the emotion that these actors brought forth in this episode. So intense that you could feel the emotions of the events that took place as if they were real events. The only character that grates me is Andrea. She seems to be thinking more about a handsome face rather than the safety of her and Michonnes lives. Overall if you have not seen this show, it is definitly a must see. I am still in shock.
B00846REIS|4.0|This book was very simliar to Fifty Shades of Grey, but the female character in this one is a little spunkier. Liked it alot, and ready to read the next one
B006QPX7UI|1.0|I have Netflix as well and never have this problem.....this movie froze numerous times which took away from the viewing experience
B00992CF6W|5.0|I agree partly with the other dude who said it needs water lava and minecarts but it needs way more like redstone;enderlands (portals);buckets; exetra. but it is way better than blockstory by a reeeeeealy long shot.
B0092C2X7U|5.0|it only gives u a very little tutorial so of course it will b challenging at first but after ten minutes of playing time u get really used 2 the controles it still wont b a piece of cake but that's wat makes it fun and once u get used to it the game is really addicting but the name fits because all u littarally do is backflips off of stuff you get three fails and then u have to start over which rally stinks I only got it yesterday though. so I am only on level three.I am really looking forward to playing more any getting to more stages or even finish the game so don't listen to those one or two star reviews because this is a reaal addicting game that people from age 5 will like and even at age fifty so I hope u like it as much as me thanks for reading
B001U0HBPG|5.0|OMG..It hasn't been one week and I have already gotton the movie the service was really fast and the movie was so touching I love it.
B00A202A3I|5.0|Very good episode.  I don't ever cry.  I'm one of those guys who feel weak if I show that emotion.  This is the first time a show has made me truly cry.  You love the people they portray.  It felt like losing your own Friend.  She was brave in the end and gave up her life so willing to save her child.  That is true love. Lorie will truly be missed.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I devoured this book, cover to cover, in 1 night! I couldn't put it down! After finishing \\"Bared to You\\", I couldn't wait to continue the journey with Gideon and Eva, and enjoyed the journey of their all-consuming passion for each other!  My heart broke for both of them and I felt their pain!  The ending of the book promises that their journey will continue and I can't wait for the 3rd book, Entwined, to be released in May!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is an easy and fun app. quick to learn, but challenging to complete.  recommend for any age group to challenge your mind's
B00846REIS|5.0|The love story that unfolded between Gideon and Eva was so passionate and raw; totally hooked me from the 1st chapter to the end of the book. The erotic nature of their relationship and the pure, raw passion from Gideon was spellbinding! I couldn't read this book fast enough, and had to read it twice more before I had my fill!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|An excellent continuation of Book 1.  This is one of the most intriguing stories I have ever read.  It was realistic and based on something that could happen in our every day world.  It was an excellent book.  Thank you.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|I loved this book. I loved the characters, the plot, the premise.<br /><br />Clay Jannon is a recently unemployed graphic designer who stumbles upon Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore after noticing a help wanted sign. He meets the owner, Mr. Penumbra himself, who asks him, \\"What do you seek in these shelves?\\" (What a great question to be asked upon entering a bookstore, by the way!)<br /><br />Thus begins a fun, quirky journey through the idiosyncrasies of Mr. Penumbra, his bookstore, and the \\"members\\" who \\"shop\\" there. Clay quickly realizes that the bookstore is not your run-of-the-mill bookstore and is drawn into a search for the truth of what's really happening. His friends, roommates, and love interest (a girl he meets when she visits the store after he created a Google ad for the store) become involved in trying to unravel the mystery of the Unbroken Spine.<br /><br />It's part literary thriller, part technology thriller, part historical thriller, and part a lot of things. And the sum of its parts is a lot of fun.
B009KHDT0C|5.0|Johnny Depp as Barnabas Collins in the movie Dark Shadows was a great hit with me. I'm sixty six years old, I've seen the original Dark Shadows on t.v. and I've seen other versions of Dark Shadows but I really liked Johnny's  version because it was done in a tongue-in-cheek humourous style and I got a kick out of that. I mean the seventies music, Johnny's Beatle's hair style, all of it was great. The big party happening bash he gives with Alice Cooper alone was a hoot. And Johnny did give a lovely hommage to the original Barnabas Collins actor Jonathan Frid and other original cast members, by having them be the first party guests to arrive. Johnny is always challenging himself as an actor, that's what I like about him. No other leading actor takes on so many different roles like he does. I'm looking forward to seeing him portray Tonto next on the big screen. It may not be the way we've gotten used to seeing Tonto portrayed but I know Johnny will give the part his own particular twist.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved reading this part it just has me in the moment of all the action i cant take my eyes away
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I'm so glad I stumbled across this game!! My kids love the simplicity and challenges this adorable and entertaining game provides.  We have a competition everyday which one of us can either go the furthest distance or collect the most coins in a single run; of course, after all the chores are done.  Can't wait for updates.  Three thumbs up!
B001TCHDPS|5.0|Saw the movie.  Love the music.  What a shame he was screwed by the record industry and more people were not made aware of the man and his talents.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Well-acted, intelligent story line, and intriguing plot twists all make up this excellent series.  Highly recommended.  Can't wait to start watching Season 2 since I was so addicted to Season 1!  Far and away one of the best series I have watched in recent years.
B0091REZMW|4.0|it's. fun. could be a little quicker, it can be slow switching from room to room. but I like it. its. interesting.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|I like this kind of movie, it kept my attention. I recommended it to several friends. rEally makes you think of whats out there.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Easy to pickup on and fun and challenging.  It was free.  What more could you ask for.  Just take the leap and play
B004AFFZNI|5.0|Awesome case. You can have the go pro cam run all night if your taking time lapse pictures. The cam gets a little hot so the skeleton case was perfect
B004GYY714|5.0|I love the fact that I can listen to radio stations from all over the world. Music, Sports, Talk, Entertainment, and Comedy.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Couldn't stop listening to the CD.  Every song is a good one.  They get stuck in your head.  Adele is amazing.
B0096U6TNC|4.0|Very subtle transitions with good straight ahead jazz musicianship. I don't know where this band went but this issue is quite nice. I like the additional live versions included in Remastered re-issue.
B0049J3QF4|4.0|Even if you aren't a NASCAR fan or fan of cars in general, this movie will entertain.  Decent story, endearing characters and enough innuendo humor to keep adults laughing too.  Pixar is King.  I don't think they can do wrong.
B008MEM24S|5.0|We really like this game. It is a lot of fun and quite addicting! Great for kids and adults alike.
034580404X|5.0|This series was good, I usally do not read these types of books but it had me hooked on the first page.
B00913DPW2|5.0|I just finished this game after playing it off and on for a few days. It was VERY challenging, but definitely doable. It just takes some time to figure it all out. I loved the graphics, story, and puzzles.  This is a game that will make you think.  At times I got stuck, but moved on and came back to it later. I do recommend this game if you love figure it out yourself McGuyver-like adventure games. I can't wait for more games like this.
0525953728|5.0|This book is one of the best i have ever read!  I felt like i was there and could imagine everything Mark Owen went through-  I had to stay up until the wee hours of the morning one night until i finished it!  Every American should read this and praise our Navy Seals!
0307269981|3.0|\\"The Girl Who Played with Fire\\" continues the \\"Millennium Trilogy\\" over a year later exposing the introverted Lisbeth Salander to the Swedish public.  The cryptic, untrusting behaviors perform as a plot device although many times it may be the same individual with a different name (Faste and Hedstr&ouml;m, Berger and Modig) as there is not much different between them.  Mikael Blomkvist conducts himself poorly, less research and more rash decisions.<br /><br />Sweden is a community of chauvinistic or dim witted male detectives and strong women where IKEA is the furnishing store of choice and Billy's Pan Pizza the only pizza people consume.  The novel is bogged down with unnecessary shopping details such as number of pizza's, toothbrush, toothpaste, what specific chairs and tables, and on and on.  The detectives handling the case behave like children.  A better editor could have vastly improved the quality of the novel.  The surprise elements are too far fetched to entertain a reader.<br /><br />The moments with Lisbeth Salander create the strongest draw.  I'll more than likely watch the Swedish movies.  I equate the series to the Bourne saga, the books are horrible but created a strong movie series.<br /><br />Thank you.
034580404X|5.0|This book is a must have. Icould not get my eyes off , all the sleepless nights were worth it . The books go in order from great to greatest and irecommend it to anyone . Its kinky but beautiful at the same time and that's what ilove the most. If you haven't read it and you want a good book to read then read atleast the first one and you will surely want to read the rest .
044651506X|3.0|This is the 3rd book I've read by this author and it is good, but seems to be filled with \\"excess\\" information and many times just seems to be awfully \\"wordy\\"!  Also, the plot is somewhat predictable.
0316228532|1.0|This is a dreadful book, and I'm not just talking about the wretched, completely unsympathetic characters or the really awful language. Novels, whether for children, young adults or adults should all be about the storytelling. Having given us fully fleshed out characters with great story lines in the HP series, I was disappointed and appalled at the banality of the storytelling in this book. I couldn't keep all the characters straight because apparently they were ALL drawn from the same cesspool and boring.  Really boring. I squandered my precious reading time slogging through 200 pages and threw the book across my room where it made a most satisfying plonk as it rebounded off the wall and fell into my wastepaper basket.
B006H5120E|5.0|Watched the 3d bluray last week and have to say I was Impressed.  The quality of the 3d version was much better than expected based on previous experience with other 3d movies.  I would definitely recommend it anyone who is on the fence and likes the movie.  If you spent the money for a 3d tv and bluray player, it is a must have.  Considering it was $5 more than the standard bluray, it is worth it.
0307744434|5.0|I loved The Night Circus. I thought the concept was imaginative and the product well-written. I would recommend it to any fantasy fan looking for a good weekend read. I wish I could visit the Le Cirque des Rêves!
B005LAJ212|5.0|This is the best series ever!  It makes you think of all the people who have screwed u over and how u can get them back LEGALLY!
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I could not put this book down! Very gripping and exciting. I recommend this for any murder mystery fan. Immediately purchased Baldacci's newest book.

B008KW43TE|5.0|I grew up loving the multi-layered RB of the early nineties that melded soulful voices with energetic rhythms. Songs you can love, dance and cry to all with in a verse of each other. Genius.
0345803507|4.0|Im not much of a reader but these books are great... dont knock them until you try them! I couldnt put the books down and I am happy I didnt. But after reading these books I had a hard time finding other books that interested me enough to read them fully. Buy the whole set. I am greatful I did.... Does anyone know anymore good books I could look up? I have read all the ones by sylvia day, though I like them I felt like it was a copycat.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Extremely exiting from beginning to end.  A page turner.  Can not wait for ken Follet's next book.  I highly recommend it.
0425263908|5.0|I liked this book better than the others that were out at the time. The characters had a better back story that was more interesting to me. It was very fast and to the point which I liked. Love the erotic novels.
B005K01VZS|5.0|What a wonderfully uplifting and positive read.  I loved being able to share inspirational quotes from the book directly from my Kindle.  It is a relatively quick read that is perfect to enjoy on a weekend afternoon.<br /><br />Seeing the spiritual journey that these 3 men take (Mitch's experience is shared in the context of the 2 \\"Men of God\\"), is fascinating.  The important message is not how you get to your relationship with God, but rather that you do get there.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|I have read every novel in this series and I waited with bells on for this book to come out.  It was not the best one of the bunch.  I was not on the edge of my seat like I normally am.  I would normally finsih the book in 2 days and be wanting more.  I found that this book did not flow smoothly and the story was inconsistant but predictable with the plot. There are Questions still to be answered and the ending was disappointing to me.  Patricia please write another book soon and make Kay her old self full of vim and viger.
B006P96PAO|5.0|Great story about being a father in all walks of live. There are struggles and triumphs, love and lose.  If you're a dad, you gotta watch this movie.
141694737X|5.0|My two young sons love it! It is a fun book with a really cute story.I'm very glad we picked it up!
B008MEM24S|4.0|my grandchildren age 4 and age 3 love it. have only achieved a few levels but its a learning game for them. perry makes it fun because of them knowing him from television
B0085RQLXK|3.0|I really love Aerosmtih. They've come out with some of the most iconic anthem rock has ever heard. They are one of THE quintessential rock bands ever. You can argue this point all day long, but there just isn't any denying it.<br /><br />That being said, I listened to this album with very mixed feelings. You buy a favorite bands' album to hear them do what they do best. In this case, I found myself listening to a whole lot of deja vu. Some of the tunes are outright rip offs of what they've done before with a little lyrical tweak here and an alternate chord there, but when I started singing other lyrics in place of those on these \\"new\\" songs, it just didn't seem right. Too many rehashes imo.<br /><br />There are some stellar songs on the album. I counted four in total, which kinda sorta justified the purchase, but made me really feel like if the whole album had been like those four tunes, it would have been a true smash. I'll let you figure out which four made you start dancing in your car seat. This is no \\"Just Push Play\\", which was an outstanding push forward for the band, or \\"Honkin' on Bobo\\", which made the old, done the Aerosmith way, an amazing way to listen again.<br /><br />The formula is there, but it just seemed a lil' lazy to me. Kinda of liek: \\" Hey guys! Let's do what you we best and rehash what we did hoping for another hit!\\". I don't listen to music for that. I listen to music to reach and ROCK my soul. This one didn't.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|One of the most BORING books ever read.  Can't believe it is a \\"best seller.\\"  Certainly will not read anymore  James books.
B000W93CHC|5.0|I am not going to give anything away in this review.<br />I re-read pillars of the earth. Then went right into world without end.<br />WOW. well written and a page turner. Almost came back late from my breaks and lunch.<br />Couldnot wait to see what was going to happen next. Love the characters. Love the story line. Like the solutions to that times problems. Loved the politics.<br />Is there going to be a third book? If so are we going to have to wait as long?
B009GENZ12|4.0|Okay, this movie wants you to believe that it is a horror movie.  The setting is gloomy and drab, set in a coal mining town hit hard by economic hard times....<br /><br />Honestly, while I sit here watching the 2012 Presidential election, I realize it is a movie that millions of Americans can relate to today.  In addition, as a high school counselor, a lot of discussion could be had after watching this movie.....<br /><br />Remember, I absolutely LOVE movies that make me scream.... keep me on the edge of my seat..... and keep me totally engaged while I'm trying to figure out what is actually going on, without being subjected to Scream-esque bludgeoning with squirting fake blood!  This movie does just that.<br /><br />The Tall Man is a movie with a lesson... one that we have discussed over lunch at school.<br /><br />I recommend this movie.... it will leave you satisfied at the end.....<br /><br />Let me know what you think after you watch it!  That's all I'm going to say so that I do NOT give too much away.... Enjoy!!
B0076DCT2G|3.0|This book starts out very slow with not much action which is not what you have come to expect from John Corey.It seems the author goes into way to much  of an explanation of the history and religion of the Middle East. It does finally come to life about 3/4 of the way thru and is in typical John Corey style. Of course not to give the end  away but it leaves the way open for another follow up.
B005WUHAX8|4.0|I purchased my LifeProof Case for iPhone 4S in pink directly from LifeProof.  Before this case, I had a bulky Otterbox.<br /><br />Not only is this case waterproof, but it is also thin and slick so that it slides into a pocket easily unlike the bulky rubber-covered Otterbox. I love the fact that my LifeProof case will protect my iPhone 4S in the event I drop my phone on the ground or in the commode!<br /><br />Be sure when you are putting your LifeProof case on your phone that you do the water test on the case BEFORE you put the phone in it.  AND, make sure that every seam touches.  The case can be pretty tight and you might need strong hands to get that last seam closed properly.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />The charger connection is VERY tight and sometimes it takes me a bit to get it plugged in to charge.<br /><br />The ringer button is very difficult to push up or down as well as the other two buttons on the side.  I deducted a STAR for these cons; however, I like my LifeProof case a great deal!
B009VSW15Y|2.0|i thought this product would be a good deal, well I found out its not all its made out to be. Pictures are so dark I cant see them, no instructions at all unless i over looked them. But I dough that. I should have looked for a freebie first. But so excited about the Fire HD I just rushed into it.Beware of what you get. Pay closer attention and always be sure there are some type of instructions.
B000GDH9JQ|5.0|I happened to catch part of the movie on TV and that part was a dance scene. So I decided to buy it. The dance scenes alone are worth the money, but I also liked to see Isabella Rosselini in her first movie role.
B008N1V11U|4.0|It is a cool game. it is almost as good as Arkham City. But the vehicles are a bit hard to control. It is still awesome.
0807014273|4.0|Very interesting information but it was not an easy read.  It might be since I am not into psychology but his accounts from his imprisonment caused me to reflect on life in a different manner.  There are many memorable and repeatable quotes throughout the book.
B0091QSNEE|2.0|get an instruction button! this makes no sense. I don't know what to do! I rate this 2 stars until I figure out how to work it
B003ZSI7R2|5.0|I just saw these guys open for The Who in Georgia. Takes me back to the high energy sounds of Otis Redding and James Brown. Rock and Soul with the best of them. I loved the sound and I hope there will be more to come from these guys!
B008TMA1LY|5.0|this app is really fun and its so cute!! its like diner dash, but it has cute little people and characters from Hello Kitty :D
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|it is a really great app,  exept for the fact that it doesnt really have anything calendar based. If your anything like me,  a calendar would realllllyy up this app. other than that. i've had no problem with  evernote and i love how it works offline. good app.
B000W93CHC|4.0|Without a doubt Ken Follett takes you back in time.  His detail of history and character development gives such reality to the story line.  I feel that I am a part of the community and look forward to each chapter and finding out more about the lives of the characters as the plot(s) unfold.
B008XG1X18|5.0|The best way to get great ideas for pictures, decorations, crafts and the best app to get information from. Also has great ideas for wedding cakes &bull;_&bull;
B008XOXGCO|4.0|It's typical The Script but they seem to be trying to be hipper and maybe not get played on just adult contemporary stations. I don't like rap and this has far, far too much rapping for me but it's tolerable because quite a bit of it is very sing-song as opposed to L'il Wayne style. It also has a lot of cursing but it's okay as there is a parental advisory sticker so I checked with my Dad and he ok'd my owning it. It has the introspective, love-lorn, love lost lyrics you'd expect so that's good and I really like Broken Arrow and No Words but I am not too fond of Give the Love Around. Overall, for every curse word, I mentally replace it with something else in my head. Stuff, mess, etc. It works.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I was waiting anxiously for Kate Morton's next book.  She is a favorite author.  I was not disappointed.  Great read!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Downloaded to my kindle fire...works great!! No slow downs at all! I use the app more on the kindle than anywhere else. Love it!
B006PHD0RW|5.0|It is a great game! It has many different types of mini games in it that you can earn. It is great for any age group and i recommend it to anyone!
0061969664|5.0|A very well-written and thrilling book. Retains the same flavor from the previous volumes. Looking forward for the next in line. Can't barely wait.
B008Y2VTIS|5.0|This is an excellent show. Love the wardrobes! 100% realistic of how it probably really was during that time period.

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It's not a whole lot different than the calculator that comes with my phone, but it's a good basic one. I prefer it visually to the built-in one and I like the fact that it displays the operation that you have just completed.
B0071BGOJC|3.0|Ken Follett succeeded in keeping me glued to the Kindle until the last page; I felt a sad loss to snap out of that (albeit stark) reality and the lives of the people involved.  I could see the main characters, cities and towns, meals, interior decorations and battles in my mind's eye and thought this book has the makings of a great film. It also made me wonder again why people allow charismatic leaders to brainwash them to harm others on behalf of a \\"greater cause\\".<br />The two stars I subtracted, were for (in my opinion) unnecessarily abundant and permissive sex and of course, the many instances of deus ex machina (most of the main characters in the USA, Russia, Germany and UK are either related, or were friends, dated, or knew each other long ago in school) and meet in the most unlikely places (e.g. Fitz/Lloyd; Boy/Lloyd; Willi/Volodya; Volodya/Greg; Daisy-Lloyd-Boy).
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show is one of the best shows I've seen in awhile! Keep up the great work guys! We love it!

B006ATJXQW|5.0|Couldn't put it down; wanted to know what precipitated the series!  Each book had new twists and turns, and characters.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I could not put this book down! It took me less than two days to read, I found myself up until 2:00 am reading. It was poignant and sad and reassuring at the same time maybe because I'm a mother and recognize my own imperfections or reminiscent of my own past
B004JN1CW4|5.0|One of the best series I've ever read.  Had to know how it all ended, and who was still alive.

B003F3FJQO|5.0|Wanted to see if the author could keep up the suspense.  Every bit as good as the first book of the series.
0316228532|2.0|I really wanted to like Casual Vacancy, and of course I read it because I had liked the Harry Potter series.  And I was willing to cut Rowling some slack, because how do you write a book after Harry Potter?  But I was really disappointed, and I struggled to finish it.  Too many characters introduced too slowly, no interesting plot, no main protagonist, no one to care about or to cheer on.  Rowling is good at describing details, especially about mean and self-centered people.  But not enough loose ends were tied up at the end to make it a satisfying story.<br /><br />There is a little morality play in this book:  that in ordinary communities and ordinary families, selfishness has real and lethal consequences.  And if we don't become our best selves, we allow and are culpable for what happens.<br /><br />But still...I wanted a good story.
B009329ZF2|5.0|I liked 'Independence Day' and 'Battle Los Angeles', but this movie was better than both. It has great action and effects, but for the most part it's a straight up Good Guys vs Bad Guys movie. It kicked Ass!
B000F8O4E0|5.0|ELO's sixth album Face The Music was first released in the Fall of 1975. This was the first album with new members Kelly Groucutt and Melvyn Gale. It was also the first ELO album to go Platinum in the U.S.. The album opens with a great instrumental number called Fire On High. Waterfall is a nice ballad and is followed by one of the band's biggest hits, Evil Woman. the first half ends with Nightrider which builds into a nice gallop. The second half starts with one of the band's fastest songs Poker with a nice rock and roll edge. Down Home Town finds the band doing a country number and being pretty successful at it. Strange Magic is another one of the band's biggest hits. It has a pretty melody and Jeff Lynne's guitar hooks are very nice. The original album ends on a high note with the ballad One Summer Dream. the bonus songs are quite nice giving us alternative mixes and versions of the songs on the album. A perfect ELO album!
0345803493|5.0|This triology is awesome, well worth the read. Fifty shades Grey just set you right for reading the other two books.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Landay wrotes good fiction, not a formulaic imitation of thoughtful writing.  He develops character in more than caricature and will impress with his plotting and his command of metaphor.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Dark, mysterious, revealing, intrigue, mystery, progress, love, rich, marriage after 5 weeks what more could you ask for? Perfect for sex lovers
B005LAIHY0|5.0|I went to see the movie when it first came out enjoyed it enough to order the Blu-ray copy . I found it a departure from the first series but , considering the directer , I had expected that . I have not found it at a better price anywhere . That made the wait bearable .
B009KHDT0C|4.0|The movie was funny, and had a plot that keeps you interested. We enjoyed it & hope you do too!!!
B009NPKTN6|1.0|I love movies that risk it all, and this one seemed to have a lot of daring, inventive elements--at least in synopsis. But in practice it was a turgid, disappointingly formulaic movie (although it had a kind of winking, faux-naive tone that was obviously meant to excuse the dependence on tired narrative formulas).
0930289234|5.0|This is one of those books you must read over and over again. It is one of the finest pieces of literature out there which deconstructs caped hero's and explores the characters like no other book. For 15 bucks, this is a must have.
1616284382|5.0|I received this stunner as a birthday present. Wow! I have been collecting books on the making of \\"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\\" since 1987 and this is by far the best! It is elegant, from the cover to the end papers, to the tons of artwork and other photos included. Kaufman is a fantastic writer. His writing never feels forced or too flowery. The text flows smoothly throughout the comprehensive story. The book begins with the origins of the tale and continues to the present day. I was hoping for a list of credits and was overwhelmed when I saw credits for each section of the film! This is not only a lovely tribute to Walt Disney, his staff, and film making in general, it is also a gift to the film's legion of fans from generation to generation. It serves not only as the definitive history of the classic, but as an encyclopedia, an archive, an art book, and a thorough look back at a magical time in Hollywood. If you are a Disney fan, a Snow White fan, a fairy tale fan, a movie buff, or an avid reader, you can't go wrong here. Proudly display this in your library. I will treasure it forever.
B006LSZECO|4.0|The book started a little slow for me but quickly picked up pace.  From 40% to about 90% I could not put it down and thought it was amazing!!!  The end is the part I'm a little unsure of.  While I think it was probably the perfect ending it was also a little anticlimactic for me.  But still, the perfect ending.  That's why I say \\"I think I really liked it.\\".  I would definitely recommend to a friend, in fact I already have.
B0083P1QUM|2.0|Very slow go.  Seemed very disjointed.  The killer was someone we didn't know, or care about. I was very disappointed because I really used to enjoy her books.  I would not recommend this book.
B004LROMWU|5.0|First of all, I am a huge sci-fi fan AND very patriotic. So Falling Skies is right up my alley! Love Noah Wylie. He is just great in everything he does. The program has a very \\"grass roots\\" feel to it; makes me want to join up. It is just so good, I have nothing too criticize. Get it!
B009XY97VC|3.0|While Archangel was an absolutely wonderful album with a vast majority of the tracks being not only superb but unique and memorable, this album feels like a step in the wrong direction. I was enjoying the first song to hear it suddenly shift gears into some absurdly generic dubstep. Further down the list I came across awful lyrical songs which were in no way fitting of the style or quality I've come to expect from TSFH. Overall, I regret my purchase of the full album as I only really enjoyed 2 or 3 songs (which on Archangel, and even Invincible, though I had my favorites, I enjoyed the entire album(s) immensely.)<br /><br />This one is worth trailing on youtube before buying, fans of the classical side of TSFH will enjoy tracks such as \\"Ocean Kingdom\\" a great deal, and will want to gouge their ears out at the dubstep in \\"Alls Hell that Ends Well\\" and the awful lyrics in \\"Back to the Earth\\"
B008CP93S0|4.0|Wasnt to sure when we rented it but ended up being a pretty good movie....for adults not one for the kiddos.  Funny
B0094GW6YE|3.0|I would like to ask something. Is this a joke? No, I'm not talking about music. I think the music is great (better than Sonic Boom...). I´m talking about the product. I love vinyl albums but this is outrageous!! It couldn´t be so simple. No gatefold cover, no lyrics, no inner sleeve, no poster (You don´t need to think in records like Dynasty or the solo albums, \\"Sonic Boom has got all of this)...only a simple plane white sheet. A shame. Paul, Gene, please don´t do this again to your fans.....
B001AGXEA6|4.0|I have been a fan of this movie since I was in grammar school, and all I can say is that the movie is not a big thing on high def quality. The movie seems to be on the normal DVD form.
B0085TKAW6|5.0|I'm a big fan of Ken Follet and have waited eagerly for the release of this book, and it hasn't disappointed.
B001IKKMCW|5.0|Delivery was quick, and the movie is pretty good in bluray edition. I have been a fan of The Mask since I was in grammar school.
B002V091IO|5.0|I'm a bit of Nick Hornby addict so tend to devour anything he writes. Particularly loved this though. Tender,  funny and charming.
B000SEGUDE|3.0|Interesting concept but dialect difficult to read in first two sections. Enjoyable reading after that, but difficult beginning. If it hadn't been for my book group I doubt I would have perservered, but glad I did.
B00563M11M|5.0|I start every discworld novel expecting a damn good read, and I've yet to be disappointed. Top marks for Snuff, a worthy Vimes story.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This is my second time reading through the fifty shades of grey series.  What can I say other than I love these books.  It is the love story behind the sex, the gradual build up of getting to know Christian and Ana that really makes these books special.  You have a picture in your mind of this couple and you are taken on their journey of lust and love.  A real treat to read!
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|This game is just amazing! It is so fun, but yet challenging.  The puzzles get more detailed as you go along and makes you want to keep going. The fact that you are on a time limit makes you strive harder to complete the puzzles.  This game is really worth it.
B002UNMW7O|2.0|The first movie was so good!  This movie had such bad acting in it. If you loved the first movie and feel an obligation to see this movie for that reason, just go in expecting nothing.
B003SI84D6|5.0|This is a modern classic I can watch again and again. They picked the best actors for the parts. I will purchase this movie on my Kindle.
B0042RUMEQ|5.0|Didn't have to skip a track. Nicki is different from other rappers. She's very unique, probably one of the most creative and stand out artist ever. She caught the attention & support of some very big artist for this debut album such as Eminem, Kanye West, & Rihanna. My favorite tracks are I'm The Best, Right Thru Me, Fly, Here I Am, & Dear Old Nicki. This album is worth buying.
0525953728|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyed learning about Mr. Owens' experiences. Being a staunch supporter of our military and unable to serve directly, the opportunity to see what our elite fighters do to maintain our freedom was very satisfying.
B0091REZMW|1.0|I play this game on facebook and I love it.  I was excited to see it on the market for my tablet. I was super disappointed that it plays for the \\"intro\\" part, but then I am unable to do anything else. If I restart it, it just takes me back to the intro part again.
0142421375|5.0|I purchased the whole series for my grand daughter, she is 11 and had actually lost interest in reading the last year or so, and checked out the first of the series (kid lawyer), she loved it, so I went to amazon and bought all three Grisham books. Her AR score at school is back up to an A. She can not wait to the next book in the series to come out next year, Mr Grisham now has a new fan for life.
1451695195|4.0|It IS a very interesting read.  It was a tad too intellectual for me, and I wished there was more detail on his actual experience.  Having said that, his story is very believable.  You do need to keep reading the book in order to get the whole picture.  Can't say more or I'd give it away.  You'll come away from it with mostly feelings that it IS going to be ok after we pass from this life.  I'm glad this story was written!
B009JNXK88|5.0|Simple and addictive! Switching from left to right on wall transfers seem off, but gameplay is smooth otherwise. The ghost replay figure is a nice feature
B006LSZECO|3.0|I loved this book. Until the end. It sucked me in, and kept me up until 3 in the morning wondering what in the world happened to this girl. I skimmed over the epilogue at the end and saw something the author wrote, thanking someone for motivating her to finish the rest of the book. I think she got tired of writing, put it down, and then later felt obligated to finish it. That's just my opinion, but I just don't think the ending does the rest of the book justice.
B008G33OJM|1.0|I preordered this blu-ray from Amazon back in July. After months of patiently awaiting it's release and arrival it came to my house yesterday afternoon (11/05/12). I immediatly ran to watch it. To my disappointment the blu-ray would not play anything past a few copy-right intros and a \\"Tarja\\" title screen, after that nothing - just black. It never made it to any sort of menu. Then, once I get on Amazon I find that many other people are having the same issues. I was really looking forward to this, too.
B007THA4FI|2.0|This is Very Slow to develope characters and plot lines. I am half way through the book and have lost interest.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think it is a very easy game to understand and it is so fun and it is so exciting
B006LSZECO|3.0|I was totally engrossed by this book.  I listened to it in audio form, and loved it right up until the end, which I hated.  I'm not sure how I wanted it to end, but that wasn't even close lol.  Definitely worth the read though.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Patricia Cornwell has another hit!  The Bone Bed marries the best in forensic anthropology with archaeology and mixes in complicated relationships.
B004U8VWLE|5.0|In this age of big CGI productions where actors are photo shopped or blue screened this is a honest to goodness character driven movie. I confess the Natalie Portman of Star Wars fame never thrilled me, I've always thought she was wooden. Once in a while she threw us a bone like in Cold Mountain but for the most part it was a yawn fest. In The Black Swan she wow's with her on the edge performance. It's a think movie. You feel for her character and you want her to do well. Without giving anything away you spend most of the movie resenting Mila Kunis who has definitely grown leaps and bounds from her 70's show days. Worth your time, one of my favorite movies of all time.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|this is a good game but the constant popups trying to get you play other games is annoying. i would have given it a 4 without the popups. it gets a 3 because of the popups
B006O2QNOU|1.0|Again, I now know why these movies are free with Prime: they suck! This one is completely shallow in dealing with its topic. It makes most people on Wall Street seem nice, other than their propensity to use the F-word while dressed in expensive suits. It's not even clear who the bad guy is in this film. The people I knew from Wall Street were truly nasty people. They don't talk anywhere close to the actors do in this film, regardless of where these real tradres and managers are from: the U.S., Europe, Asia, or Down Under. And nobody cared about their customers, regardless of whether the customer would come back or not. I felt very frustrated while watching the film. It simply watered down the seriousness of the problems, problems that have not been dealt with and will never be dealt with by the government or the society! Watch the part where they were going over Dale's numbers; they didn't even show the screens. BTW, why do the filmmakers so conspicuously show that those are Bloomberg terminals? Haha, because someone has to foot the bills for this film, paying the big-name stars and all that. My fellow Americans, these filmmakers are as into the money culture as the financial raiders on Wall Street. Like some wise man once said, everybody's got a dirty ass!
B009QWNS9I|5.0|There's not much on TV I enjoy and I HATE commercials. I love that I can watch Revenge when I'm ready, commercial free. AND, I love Amazon.com for providing it.
B001O1O71C|3.0|Boy in the striped pajamas.  Good but not great.  Very predictable.  Author didn't delve into too much about characters.<br /><br />Boy in The Striped Pajamas
B009NBSEXM|5.0|This review duplicates the one I wrote for Revenge. I love this show and I love being able to watch it commercial free. I've given up expensive TV cable/dish providers. I stream Netflix, Amazon, and other free channels with my Roku device and laptop. I dread the day our internet charges sky rocket because the cable/dish providers start noticing the money they are losing because of streaming.
B00785P2QC|5.0|very addicting game.  easily passes the time. quick money and investment generation too. I find myself checking the game often and cant wait to log in in the morning to see my money generated and see what new missions and buildings are available to me.
0062197258|5.0|This is an excellent thriller that addresses the complex issues of abuse and OCD while also being supremely entertaining.  I am glad I started it on a weekend, as I couldn't put it down.  I thought it could have been a little shorter (maybe compress some of the middle of the story) and the beginning was a little confusing.  Each chapter alternates between the narrator, a young woman, Catherine, in the present day and back when the abuse was happening to her.  Oh, and it starts with a trial transcript and also a second narrator, Naomi, who immediately gets killed. The chapters are marked with the dates, but it took me a few of them to figure out who was who.  Once I got used to the system (and eventually Naomi ties in), I found it an interesting way to present the story.<br /><br />This is one of those books that sat on my nightstand for months and, now that I have read it, I kick myself for waiting so long.  I have already recommended it to several friends.
B009CPES4I|5.0|My husband and I watched this movie a couple of weeks ago. We both really enjoyed it, but how can any movie with Judi Dench not be great!
B006P96PAO|5.0|Very good movie....good for whole family. I highly  recommend this movie. The whole family can watch it and there are no curse words or nudity.  We need more movies like this.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I simply could not put this book down. I loved the movie and the book was even better! I am now about 1/3 of the way through Catching Fire and it has me just as captivated. Absolutely enjoy this trilogy and I have to say it is one of my favorites.
B009FZZFME|4.0|Great acting, and an ever-changing plot make TWD a real drama and thriller. Beyond just a horror movie, it shows how people might react under frightening conditions they have little control over. The struggles they face, the heroes, cowards, and evil doers all play their part in keeping the story fresh, with new surprises always around the corner.
0545157617|5.0|I purchased the book for my youngest granddaughters. They are 2 and 6. They were totally thrilled and entertained by the illustrations as well as the words. I feel the book will be a favorite for many years to come.
B009IKPOUO|5.0|Surprised the wife with her favorite artist of all time with the newly released album for only $5! Great deal and a happy wife!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book kept me on edge from beginning to end. Every time I thought I knew what was happening next, I was wrong!
B008Y212PI|5.0|I now have several of these puzzle collections. and I love them all. they are challenging yet doable. will probably get more.
B009FBX5M0|2.0|1.  The Adele track is not on this score but you should still buy her single, it is a fantastic entry into the opening credits history for Bond films and they really nailed it - love the dramatic theme that is mixed in.  It is noticeably absent from the score though.<br /><br />2.  This Newman score is really not that good.  Take Newman's Jarhead with the wacka wacka wacka fast paced music and every 5 tracks throw in a 5 second Bond motif and that is what you get.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I like Newman as a composer this is a solid effort, but as a Bond film (standing on its own) it just does not have the same drama or classic feel to it.  Even the action cues are not dramatic at all, just repetitive strings that never crescendo with brass or percussion without character.  The opening track Istanbul has some highlights, but it echoes African Rundown very closely from Royale.  It will be interesting to see how much of this cue is re-used throughout the film.<br /><br />I know they are taking the series in a new direction, but David Arnold really nailed Bond with Tomorrow Never Dies and Casino Royale (to be fair World is Not Enough was terrible).<br /><br />Note that the track Komodo Dragon is the only one that has that Bond feel to it so Newman got that right, but everything else falls around it.  It only lasts a minute then we are back to the wacka wacka wacka within the same track.  Breadcrumbs is the traditional Bond theme, but you can't possibly screw that up so at least he included that.<br /><br />If you are a die hard collector, go ahead and pick this up, but don't expect it to be worthy of repeat listening - honestly, the second time I listened to it, the repetition was pretty annoying.<br /><br />It may work really well in the film, and that is the ultimate goal, but again as a stand alone Bond score it is really not that good.  Nothing in it has me excited to hear it in the film, unlike some pre-release scores tend to do.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I really enjoyed the way this game was made. You could get from point A to B without a problem. This game had a clue button that really gave you a clue. Wow! No cheat sheets needed. I loved it! Please make more!
B003VANOFY|2.0|I encourage you do a Google search for \\"g930 charging problem\\" before buying this headset.  There seems to be a common problem where one of the connectors inside the headset is loose.  (I also have this problem.)  Someone posted on the Logitech forums the steps required to fix it yourself by opening the headset and re-soldering the relevant  connections.  And people who have tried this seem to have success.<br /><br />If you feel like re-soldering connections in your new $100 headset, it may be for you.  The headphones are comfortable, the microphone works well, noise canceling seems to work well, and the sound quality is good.<br /><br />On a general note, I feel like Logitech must be cutting corners lately.  I've been a loyal Logitech custom for years, but have had problems with their products recently.
B0087HT36U|5.0|I love this game! There are so many possibilities in how to pass each level. You can really be creative. I am just waiting for more levels!!!
B0086700CM|4.0|my daughter and I love playing this game! sometimes it misreads my move but no big deal... still loads of fun
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This app loads quick and is very addicting for the whole family. Trying to send the coins down the chute is easy but never boring because you have all kinds of prizes to collect. Also there is another puzzle your collecting for which just makes you want to play. Sometimes you have to wait for more coins but give it a few minutes. Also the prizes you win can be collected for coins. This game is really nice because I haven't been hounded to buy anything online. The graphics are well done! In fact my five year old got mad at me because she wanted a turn! I definitely recommend this app!
1476712042|5.0|This is the first Jamie McGuire novel that I have read/purchased & was very impressed. Beautiful Disaster was a really good read & hard to put down. The storey was so good, I didnt want the book to end. I will definetly be reading more of her other novels. :)
B000FC1LOC|5.0|I had to read this book for an assignment for school.  It was Great! I love it soooo much. The character development was thoughtful and you felt as if you were part of the story while reading the book.  If you have seen the movie, my suggestion is to forget it and read the book, it's 100% better.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|I expected to like it. I expected alot from Ridley Scott. I won't spoil a thing (for those who haven't seen it yet), but it was dark, gritty, expansive and had my complete attention, start to finish. Not an easy fete in and of itself, I assure you. Completely drawn in to the film. Forgot I was watching a film. The very definition of a great film experience. Enjoy!
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I am speechless I have never cried so much, this book was absolutely amazing i don't know what else to say, this is a must read. I loved it!!
B008O69SZ0|5.0|One of the benefits of the demise of the music business as I / we used to know it is the end of the requirement of major sales to get a wide-spread release. Thanks to the web, sites like this, and so forth, most artists are no longer under the constant pressure to have \\"hits\\" and move 100,000 copies of something in order to get their music released and heard. As a result, artists like, say Ian Hunter, are able to keep making records (yes, I still call them that - sue me) and, even more, keep making the music they want to make without regard to whether or not they make the charts. I'm not really sure what \\"making the charts\\" even means anymore. Thanks goodness.<br /><br />And thank goodness for Ian Hunter. I have been a fan since the mid-1970's, my mid-teens, and am kind of astonished, really, to find that he is making what is probably the finest records of his career (Mott or solo) in the last 10 - 12 years. This, [[ASIN:B000068G2Q Rant]], and [[ASIN:B000NTPGCK Shrunken Heads]] are simply three of the finest records he ever made, ranking with the best of Mott, his first solo album ([[ASIN:B00080CO9W Ian Hunter]]) and [[ASIN:B000002Z7K You're Never Alone With a Schizophrenic]]. His writing is as cogent, trenchant, and pointed as ever, and in many cases more so. He and the Rant band rock as hard as he ever has and yet are as light on their feet as they need to be when such is called for.<br /><br />And the songs here are terrific, starting from the top: His string of great album openers remains intact with Comfortable taking pride of place alongside Once Bitten Twice Shy, Just Another Night, Still Love Rock 'n' Roll, hell, All the Way From Memphis and Death May Be Your Santa Claus, too. He also avoids the overly sentimental ballads that marred [[ASIN:B0028OF7P4 Man Overboard]], the one area in which his older songs tend to be stronger.<br /><br />It is a gloden age for music by talents like Hunter, John Hiatt, Dwight Yoakam, Niel Young, Loretta Lynn, and on and on - no longer at the mercy of mass tastes, they can make music that they really want to make and know that it can get to the people who really want to hear it. I really wanted to hear this and all evidence points to Hunter really wanting to make it. Hurrah.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|Uh well I didn't really look at the meanings but I think I might need them soon. :) Ps I'm awesome
B008J34466|5.0|I have a sister...that reminds me so much of Pink!  This CD is in my opinion Pink's best yet.  Some sorrowful songs that will touch you.  Some tracks that make you crank up the volume and dance in your seat going down the road.  I highly recommend that you buy it.
B006LSZECO|2.0|This book grabbed me at the beginning so much so that I overlooked the bad language, which wasn't' necessary, in my opinion, but I gave it two stars because I thought the author got to the end, didn't know how to end it, so just gave up.
B00961ZGQC|5.0|This song is a good song to just have fun with and give a a nice feeling to dance and move to
B004JMY312|5.0|So glad Hocus Pocus was available to rent on Amazon Prime this Halloween! The whole family loves it, it really makes the holiday to sit around and watch an excellent family movie.
B008Y5OW20|5.0|It took ages for Amazon to ship this...but the wait was more than worth it.<br />To be honest I didn't care too much about these songs before (except maybe She and Smile), but Jeff's take on these classics makes most of these songs a true gem.  The melodies and chords on these songs are simply beautiful, add to that the addition of Jeff Lynne classic sound, harmonies, deep bass and drums, and they are a pleasure.  Bewitched, Bothered & Bewildered and Love Is a Many Splendored Thing are my absolute favorites.
B000BVMAJ2|5.0|There are not a whole lot of pieces in this but there is a whole lot of imaginative play.  Duplo quality is always great.  This set could be a stand alone toy but is fabulous as an addition to a collection
B003O86FMW|4.0|After the first book this on leaves a little to be desired ,not in the essence of content but in th game field itself ,while it tells a deeper story it lacks the quality of detail . In my humble opinion the arena could have used a more excitement . But overall it accomplished drawing the reader toward the next book without question , a good read
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love it!  We're back to the basics - killing lots and lots of zombies!  Season 2 on the farm looking for Sophia just went on tooooooooooo long.
B003XDZLTG|2.0|significantly shrink (more than a full size) if you leave them outside in the sunlight, even for a few hours.  Happened twice.
B0063IH60K|5.0|classic game that everyone loves. its fun its free what's better than that.  I am really happy I have it
B008AX1HD8|3.0|The buildup for this book, the first in the Harry Hole series was disappointing.<br />As a former resident of Sydney I appreciated his local knowledgem but it is the New South Wales police force rather than that of the City of Sydney. I find these little inconsistences annoying as they tend to distract from the well researched changing role of the Aborigines at the time - post Mabo which did add to the plot.<br />The book was boring and in some instances reading some chapters were like driving form Sydney to Forbes. (miles of bloody nothing) as my stepfather described a drive in the Australian bush. Its as bad as driving through Iowa when the corn is high, that is like driving through a tunnel. About the only thing I learned is the Hole is pronounced \\"Holey\\". Nesbo was at Writers Week in Adelaide recently- but before the publication of The Bat as he would have had some explaining to do.
B001TXWJ4M|5.0|Just discovered this exceptionally written story of the accidental drug maker and his journey towards drug kingpin, while maintaining his normal life as a chemistry teacher and supporting his enormous bills for medical treatment of his lung cancer, and having a new child. Can't wait to watch season 3 (I know - lots to catch up!)<br />Excellent series!

B009CPJHY4|5.0|This is a story about some unusual people who become friends in an unlikely place.  The setting in India is beautiful and you can't help falling in love with the characters.  Well worth watching more than once!
B003AXAS60|4.0|This toy is what I had expected a Ty plush to feel like when I had received it...however, the swing tag was on its CHEST instead of its ear.  Considering the fact that this should be an authentic Ty product, it almost makes me wonder if the tag was re-punched into the wrong part of its body.
B007P6VLRS|5.0|This cd has a great sound. Different than past albums, more electronic sounding. I listen to it all the time!
B004GYY714|5.0|by far the best music app. i rarely give app 5 stars but this deserved pandora is nothing compared 2 this get it. i love u cal listen to local chanles.
B008BD9SI8|4.0|Joe Abercrombie is undoubtedly one of my new favorite authors. His dark, bloody, dirty style with extremely detailed characters, full of pain and anger and hate made his books the most fun to read in a long time (unfortunately, not may authors have the guts to write in such a style). While 'Red Country' was a very good read, I find it slightly lacking compared to the original trilogy. The story has less action, the characters are a little less fun to follow, and it is a pity we jump so much into the future with no real inter-rim storyline to give us a complete detailed description. As I am not a spoiler, I will not give away details, but... some of my favorite characters end up in a way which simply makes me angry. But again, Abercrombie defies the odds and writes a wonderful piece of literature, only for those with a strong stomach.<br />Otherwise, I compliment Abercrombie's writing skills, which are truly eye-catching and fun, andI eagerly await his next book, hoping it'll make up that small gap that this book made.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I am not sure why the low reviews, it was challenging but not impossible. There are hints but you really don't need them if you really review your inventory and think about it. Great graphics too. Looking forward to more like this.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|Excellent value.  I tried to see this movie three times and fell asleep on it all three times.  Now that I own it, I control it;
B003O86FMW|5.0|The best trilogy I have ever read.  I could not put it down.  Worth any price. I wish it would continue.
B0091REZMW|5.0|this is the best game i have ever played.im on it everyday.so cool..i recomended it to couple friends and they loved it too..
B006BAEQB2|4.0|I love this author! However I found the main character much more negative then she is portrayed in other historical novels. However it was a great quick read!
B008UUPOVM|5.0|Loving this new album from Owl City. This new material brings out a more pop sound that is executed excellently with the usual Owl City style. I highly recommend it for all of the Owl City fans out there!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|It is so nice to learn the accounts of incidents of history from the people who participated.  You only get glory mongering from an administration who had to stumble through the process, and breaks its arm trying to pat themselves on the back for saying, &#34;ok&#34;.  I am so proud of Mark Owen for having the courage to write the book.  I thank him for his service to our country.  I am so glad for his safe return from his missions.  I hope that after such an action packed life, he can learn to enjoy smelling the roses.  I feel safer knowing there are more people like him out there who can do these missions, and keep us safe.  I regret that our president did not learn a thing about being a commander-in-chief, and because of that 4 other American patriots are dead.  No answers for their parents.  It might hurt chances for re-election to be honest with the American public.  I pray for their families and hope for some honesty for them.
0824835921|3.0|If you're like me and have learned the hiragana and katakana and think that kanji would be the next step, this book is not the way to get there.  I can see the value of this book to someone who is fluent in spoken Japanese. For those of us learning by reading, this book isn't a lot of help.  As one reviewer pointed out, there is only one meaning to each character. Though, the most disappointing part was that there is no pronunciation offered with the words.  It tells you what the character means in English, but not in Japanese. Seems like a no-brainer to include that info as well.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Interesting and fun to read. Chris I believe did an excellent job telling this story. It felt real. Every bit of it.
B0000TLA9G|5.0|I was first introduced to the music of Guns N' Roses as a young child (around 8 years old).  My two older brothers listened to a wide range of rock music and this band was one of them.  \\"Patience\\", \\"November Rain\\", \\"Paradise City\\", and \\"Knockin On Heaven's Door\\" are some of the popular classics on this greatest hits set. \\"Greatest Hits\\" by Guns N'Roses is best for those who like and are familiar with at least five of their songs.
B008OOYALE|5.0|i love the game but wish it was easyer to clear my areas and more gold and make it better to get more food
B004LZRSDM|5.0|\\"Ending On A High Note: Final Concert\\" is a brilliantly played performance that showcases powerful music harmony among the band members. \\"The Sun Always Shines On TV\\",  \\"Manhattan Skyline\\", \\"Hunting High And Low\\", \\"Butterfly Butterfly (The Last Hurrah)\\", \\"Foot Of The Mountain\\" and \\"Take On Me\\" were some of my favorite performances of the concert.  There is a complete listing of the concert songs on A-ha's storefront website from playdotcom.  \\"Ending On A High Note: The Final Concert\\" is best for those who like at least three songs by A-Ha and/or  pop music spanning from the 80's to the early 2000's.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|SOA is one of the best shows, and IMHO if you take every show from every channel less then  10 (maybe 8) are worth watching at all.<br />SOA is in top 3. this season has to rate 5 stars because its the 1st season and if it wasnt any good they wouldnt be on season 5 right now.<br />Enjoy
B003O86FMW|4.0|I was just a little disappointed that once again she was fighting to survive..but the plot is well developed. I haven't read the 3rd book because I heard it doesn't really have a 'happily ever after' ending. I'm a hopeless romantic so I decided to stop at book two and decide for myself how it all ends!
B007WKEM8C|4.0|In the last 30 days, I went through 3 cookbooks, and to be honest only 2 are worth mentioning because the recipes are indeed delicious that I end up with extra servings most of the time. The 2 good ones are The Smitten Kitchen and a [[ASIN:B009277LL8 diabetic cookbook]] which offers 60 delicious and healthy desserts that even non-diabetics like my son and husband find it delicious.<br /><br />Back to The Smitten Kitchen. I started following Deb's blog some time ago, and enjoy it thoroughly. However, and respectfully, it will be more ideal if she can focus more on the recipes than her son in the book. After all, this is a cookbook where readers like to find out how to make delicious foods.<br /><br />The other thing is that, I would prefer a book in the dessert category to focus more on dessert or have more dessert recipes. While this book has recipes for desserts, it is really not one I would want to consider if desserts are what I'm seeking only.<br /><br />Further more, I find it a little pricey. I don't think I will ever want to pay this much for a cookbook no matter how good the recipes are (especially for a kindle book). Also, because of her emphasis on the ingredients, you will need more time to whip out every dish, and most people are too busy to spend that much time to prepare food nowadays.<br /><br />And for the positive part? If delicious food is all that really matters, then this is the book for you. My son and husband finished up everything every time I prepare something from this book. They are more than happy if I can cook something taken from this book everyday.
B005CRQ3NY|5.0|It was great<br /><br />I love Greg bag time at the Baseball game<br />I still hate that phone Good Job Greg
B005LAII1C|4.0|Tis move was very entertaining and better than exceed. Mark wahlberg was perfect for this role and although I do not like fake animals in movies this bear was very likable and believable :)
B004UAODUE|4.0|Very enoyable - plan to watch the whole series - I enjoy the period setting and am learning about a culture of which I had little knowldege
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Found this to be fun and challenging. Loved the hint option so I didn't need it after I realized how helpful the maps. Great fun for everyone in our family. Several of the puzzles seemed tedious at first but after getting used to the procedure it was truly enjoyable. Cannot wait for part 2.
B00992CF6W|5.0|its awesome and my brother has it too and he plays it all the time on his ipod. u should deffently get this app because u will love it to Seth.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|This showed up under the suggestions based upon prior purchases.  I was initailly skeptical based on the digital only format and low prices, but based on the great reviews I decided to give it a try.  What a pleasant surprise!  I would have been thrilled with this as a full priced novel, at $3 it feels kinda like stealing.<br /><br />Blood Song tells the story of Valien, son of the realm's battle lord.  We first meet him imprisioned after a failed campaign, during which he killed the enemy's prince known as The Hope.  As he is to be transported to a duel which is meant to be his death he tells his story to his enemy's historian.<br /><br />As a boy at the death of his mother he is given to the service of the Sixth Order, a military branch of the realm's religious order.  The training is brutal, and many of the boys will not finish or survive it.  Valien emerges as a leader of a tight knit group of friends to make it through the training.<br /><br />Valien soon learns the lessons that he was taught in the Order is not the full truth, and there are threats that he was never aware of.  The Orders do not tolerate other religions, and magic (or the dark as they refer to it) is considered evil as well.  Deniers (those who practice other faiths) as well as those who use the dark are hunted and put to death when found which does not mesh with Valiens sense of justice.  Valiens life is further complicated when he is forced to give promises to the king which draw him into the dark side of realm politics and intrigue.  Through this all Valien is also trying to find out who he is and deal with his own emerging abilities.<br /><br />Blood Song is a fantastic coming of age tale.  The characters are well written and the story moves quickly throughout the novel.  I've added The Raven's Shadow is a short list of series whose next installment I'm eagerly anticipating.
B005I4JG80|4.0|The \\"rest of the title\\" is what grabbed me~Three words: \\"wisdom\\", \\"parenting\\", \\"French\\". ~ Okay, not in that order,but in the order they registered in my mind~all favorite topics.  Having had a French child and her mom in my home for several months I got to observe first hand something of their philosophy of parenting, and, having visited Paris twice  it just sort of reached out and grabbed me.  It's a fun read, and an instructive one too.  It seems the French have a good-sense balance between the needs of the relationship (yes, the one that resulted in the child in the first place) the needs of the child, and the personal needs of each parent.  I recommended this book to a granddaughter with a new baby.
B007EECSFA|2.0|I have enjoyed other books by Kate Morton, but not this one.<br />I really didn't connect with the characters,and found it repetitive at times.
B003Q6D2B4|3.0|owed my wife a movie so she requested this one..that's why i bought it.unrealistic movie however.Bruce Willis always makes fin movies.
B004T5R2HQ|2.0|I tried this app four different times on a galaxy s3 but it didn't work. It looks great on other phones but not mine.
B006ZCWU5K|2.0|I saw Bruce in concert at the Armadillo World Headquarters in the 70's more times than I can remember.  Always loved his music, and I have mostly followed him over the years. He really put on a great show.  This record has some good spots, but mostly it sounds too much like what he has done in the past, special edition or not.  I have heard it, and I won't be buying it.  I find it boring, and I believe maybe Bruce himself is rather bored.<br />I just wish actors and musicians who sell their work to the public at large would keep their political views to themselves, off stage.  You know who I am talking about, its a very long list!  I hate to be a hypocrite, but in so many cases I have to (try to) ignore their politics in order to enjoy their music.  But it niggles away at my soul.  There is something about using one's success to become a mouthpiece for a cause, any cause, which implies knowledgeability.  Unfortunately the expertise that led to the original success rarely has anything to do with the cause. And something about fabulously wealthy individuals sobbing along with the downtrodden, then using all their loopholes to avoid taxes, just smells nasty.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|very fun and challenging. it is a must have app. this game keeps you well focused as each level keeps you thinking.
B009RI4ZKC|2.0|I guess this movie is not my style.  Neither my husband or I enjoyed it.  It was entertaining in some areas but I guess we were expecting more of a comedy and it was hard to tell where exactly the storyline was headed.  We both fell asleep and didn't bother to watch the end.  It is very artsy and some of the shots were gorgeous.  The costumes & sets were great to see.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game ever invented. The only thing wrong is if you power off when it comes back on it'll be black you have to hit back on the buttons at the bottom. otherwise the graphics are great and this is the best game I've ever had!
B0098VYCCE|3.0|It was ok. I can't say it was particularly noteworthy- I watched it not too long ago and can't remember what happened. It wasn't that bad either because if it was I would remember that it was particularly bad. So... It was ok.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is very cool,yet very ADDICTIVE. On this game you can earn coins and you can but different thongs if you have enough coins earned. For example, you can get a new character, resurrection wings,etc.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have a love hate relationship with Pinterest. I'm addicted to it and it stops me from getting all the productive things it suggests I do done.
0439023513|3.0|I was lucky to come by The Hunger Games series after it had all been written. I picked it up after I had just read a few beautifully written novels. This seemed so poorly written I couldn't keep going. Once I was in a more light hearted mood and wanted a fun read, without caring if it insulted my intelligence, I picked it up. I've loved many silly books like the Sookie Stackhouse vampire novels.<br /><br />By the third book in the series it just seemed so ham fisted. The only relationship that seemed to be developed well was between Gale and Katniss. I totally understood why they were bonded and it was the first thing to keep me interested in seeing what happened. I wanted to know how their relationship changed. In this book, I didn't really understand who Gale was or his motivations yet this relationship was more developed than the relationship with Prim which the reader just has to assume is based on responsibility and a semblance of sentimentality.<br /><br />I particularly was disappointed with the development of Katniss. The theme of her being afraid of the underground because of her dad's death needed to be continually explained because it never felt real and every time I read it, it just felt like 'this again?'<br /><br />I found it unrealistic that the capital loved its victors and yet continued to kill children, it somehow didn't make sense. Perhaps if there was some explanation of capital life and capital children's lives earlier in the series it would have been more believable. There's a few remaining questions like what do the capital residents say to their children about these games and where does the amazing technology displayed in the games or with the Pods.<br /><br />All the negative aside, I kept reading and really wanted to know what happened. The book was action packed and it was a fun read that I don't at all regret.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|When I had finished Fifty Shades of Grey, I had just had to confirm what I believed Ana would do.  And this one sucked me in just like the first one.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I absolutely LOVED this story.  For me, it was better than the Hunger Games trilogy, as well as the Divergent / Insurgent books (although not by much).  I was so intrigued by Wool 1 that I immediately went out and bought the rest and then couldn't put my Kindle down.  I really hope the author continues the story from where it left off and I can totally see a good movie come from this.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|If you liked Alien trilogy, you will like Prometheius. It actually explains how aliens (from the trilogy) came to be.<br /><br />The movie gets too much hate in my opinion. But I guess some people expect too much out of it.<br /><br />And by the way, this movie is based on facts. Look up 'Anunaki', which were considered to be large beings or \\"gods\\" by Sumerians who came to earth and genetically altered humanoids, and turned them into humans. That's how some say we were created to be who we are today, and that all of this darwinism theory is a bunch of b.s.. Just thought I brought that up.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The walking dead series is wonderful. I have been reading the books, the series makes it come to life, just can't get enough, hurry up  more episodes! If you like zombies and drama check this series out!
B002SW8Y2E|5.0|An amazing, on the edge of your seat thriller that keeps you wanting to read.<br />Very well written and planned out. Ties everything up at the end and doesnt leave you sitting there thinking \\"But what happened with this person/thing\\".<br />Loved it, well worth the read and I am already half way through the second book.
B008EZVNO0|5.0|We LOVE Van the Man. Can't wait for next cd. There are so few artists that have such a music arrangement like him.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|The Facebook App for Kindle does not work. It only loads my timeline; all other pages, lists, groups, etc., all say 'Tap to Retry' but they can never load. It's basically a worthless app. The web based Facebook is only margianlly better. I can load pages, but it's nearly impossible to Like or Comment on anything. Very disappointing.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|good game but it is really slow and there are a lot of ads. I could have gotten all of the people and it took away all of my coins. for the most part you should still get this very addicting game GET THIS GAME! &iexcl;!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book took me back to Highschool. A rollercoaster of laughter and tears. I was sad when I got to end, I didn't  want the story to be over.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Easy to play and fun game to just play mindlessly. Doesn't require knowledge or brain power just drop coins and hope for the best!
B000FVNX2Q|3.0|This is my first foray into the world of finance. I began taking classes this year with the ultimate goal of taking the CFP exam. Having read a number of calculator reviews, I have to say that clearly no calculator is perfect. It really seems to be very subjective as to preference for a financial calculator. That is born out by the reviews. I also found that many people have more than one calculator. I originally bought a TI BA II+ Professional and liked it quite a bit until I found that for some reason, despite adjusting my settings to accommodate more decimal places, the TI BA II+ rounds up a lot more often than I would like during Time Value of Money calculations. I searched on the net for a fix but came up short and a lot of folks said I should have bought a 12C. Well, I just did. So, while my 12C doesn't round up like the BA II+ Pro, I now have a new issue, perhaps even more irritating. I'm finding that throughout a lot of TVM problems, the 12C comes up with the incorrect answer because it cannot correctly perform calculations when the result is a \\"non-integer.\\" I've done some research on this and the answers I've gotten basically indicate that there's some logic to rounding up when a non-integer is the answer but when you have to take an exam that counts for accuracy and yours is the only device that produces an \\"incorrect\\" answer, you're still going to be hosed. So, I'm in a bit of a pickle. It doesn't appear either calculator is going to be a device I can use to the exclusion of others. Very discouraging.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|This novel by Nelson DeMille is very well researched and meticulously written, but the ending is somewhat anti-climactic.  The novel focuses on Yemen where an Al Queda leader (born in America) is the object of the hunt by Detective John Corey of the Anti-Terrorism Task Force.  DeMille has a wonderful sense of humor which permeates all of his writing.  The characters are well developed as is their dialogue throughout the book.  If you liked \\"The Lion\\" by DeMille, you will enjoy this book, as well.
B007Y36K46|5.0|I loved the books and the movie is wonderful it fantastic that we're only now able to do justice to a series of books who's first story was written over 100 years (1911) ago.
B005FITIIC|5.0|Product was perfectly packaged and arrived in perfect condition.  No problems with the blu-ray whatsoever when i played it in my player. It is a great product and a great movie.

B0086449YA|2.0|I was hoping Mr. Knopfler's next album would reverse the trend begun in \\"Kill to Get Crimson\\", namely his manifest boredom with the guitar and his apparent quest to replace it with other sounds, such as flute(?), etc.<br />Hopes were unfulfilled; as I listened to \\"Privateering\\", I was saddened to see just how bored he must be.<br />Pick any track from \\"Shangri La\\" and it will have more of his deft fretwork than the entire contents of \\"Privateering\\".<br /><br />I've read interviews where he stated his dislike for doing the same thing again.  I suspect many artists share this sentiment.<br />Evidently, this new direction is the one he feels he wants to follow and that is his prerogative, but not a journey I care to share.<br /><br />When most people hear the name Mark Knopfler, they naturally think of magical guitar playing and notes dripping with tone.  Not anymore; the magic is missing.<br /><br />Here's hoping it returns.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|This beauty is incredibly easy to USO. Snap it on and shoot. Perfect exposure every time. Fits in a pocket when unneeded .
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I wish i could give this series 10 stars!!!!!! I can not get enough of GIDEON and EVA!!!  The connection between Gideon and Eva is electrifying !!!! There were times that I wanted to strangle Gideon with my own bare hands, but after reading the book, I understand why he handled some situations the way he did.. I can not wait for Entwined In You in May 2013... I am hoping that all of our questions are answered...
B008FTAAG2|5.0|It's an awesome CD. Has a great transition in the songs from a softer side to a much harder rock. I like all the songs and its definitely worth getting the whole CD.
B00846REIS|5.0|I absolutely LOVE Gideon Cross.. At first I was a little hesitant thinking that this was a replica of 50 Shades of Grey.. But as I continued to read the book, it definitely held its own!!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I was slightly sceptical after reading so many 5 star reviews, but tried the premium anyway.  My only regret is that I didn't find this app sooner.  Setting up your own custom ambient environment is easy and fun.  Best app around for putting you in a restful state.
B001DD0HPG|4.0|This is billed as a set of Julian Bream's favorite albums, collected and reissued at budget price.  Beware that almost all of the albums are from the LP era, so they provide relatively short playing time on CD.  Bizarrely, the double-album with John Williams is cut so that only 38 minutes of music is offered, leaving more than half the capacity of the CD unused.  Personally, I wish more Spanish music was included, though the Granados/Albeniz album is probably the highlight of the set.  The other compelling albums for me are the 20th Century Guitar, the Villa-Lobos album, and the live album made with John Williams.  Altogether this is an interesting set, though it is by no means comprehensive.  Notes and photos are included.

B000GLKLCK|5.0|This is the best available set of Mozart piano concertos currently available, mostly because of the extremely distinguished playing of Murray Perahia.  The set includes the four earliest Mozart concertos, which are reworkings of pieces by other composers.  Also included are the 2-piano and 3-piano concertos (the 3-piano work is arranged for 2) in performances with the great Romanian pianist Radu Lupu.  The recordings are relatively consistent, even though they were made across a 13-year period in various venues and with different recording technology (analog and digital).  The balance between piano and orchestra is definitely weighted toward the soloist (almost all Columbia recordings were made that way) and this may upset some listeners.  Nonetheless, the contributions of both the English Chamber Orchestra and Perahia are ideal.  The set is spread across 12 discs, with several discs having short playing time.  A cheaper version of this set is now available, though the budget version does not provide any notes or documentation.

0316227706|5.0|I was drawn to this book by the incredible appeal of the cover photo. It contains over 80 photos of dogs having fun exploring/swimming underwater. The author reports that most of the dogs never went underwater until he met them; some had never even been swimming. Each dog featured has its name, breed, and age - from as young as 12 weeks old to as old as 13 years old. The eyes of some are especially fascinating, while others look incredibly fierce with their mouths open in pursuit of the tennis ball or ring used to get them to dive. A few could even pass as otters, looking so natural and happy. There were also a couple with their mouths closed and tongues hanging out.
B0086449YA|3.0|Mark Knopfler is misunderstood. Some of our contemporaries find him boring. I think not. But you have to listen to him in stillness to grasp his subtle excellence. While this is the usual stellar collection of tunes, I think it's one disc too long. Pare it to a single disc and make sure you include Radio City Serenade, his best song since The Last Laugh on the Sailing to Philadelphia record and a work worthy of his greatest Dire Straits cuts - Romeo and Juliet and Your Latest Trick.

B009DH371K|5.0|Saw the concert in Sep at the Egytion Theatre in<br />Hollywood. Great concert. I would have to say Freddie's voice is the best I have heard him live.<br />Very good sound mix with Freddie's voice out front.  The camera as usual loves Freddie and he gets the bulk of screen time which is fine as this  show is a tribute to his greatness. On Blu Ray with a good home stereo system should sound even better
1863514260|5.0|I really enjoy this book because it breaks down color combinations and techniques in an interesting way. As a textiles artist I have found that most books are incredibly boring, not this one! I love the DMC color chart, it makes life easy when replicating the projects. This is also a durable hardcover book which I love
B00499K9E0|5.0|I saw that this series had a very high rating, so I decided to give it a go.  Wow, I was hooked after the first fifteen minutes.  Sherlock Holmes is played by Benedict cumberbatch.  His character is eccentric, quirky, and extremely intelligent, yet in a limited way due to his uninterest in anything other than his interests.  Yet somehow all of these things put together make Sherlock very appealing and fascinating to watch.  He is balanced by the down to earth Dr. Watson played by Martin Freeman.  Freeman is a great Watson, and his numerous girlfriends, much to the amusement of Holmes, adds a pleasant twist to Watson's storyline.  Love this series!!!  Watch it and you will be hooked too.

Highly entertaining blockbuster that may not be 100% true to the comic books but is good enough to be entertaining and addictive. Slightly longer than expected but barely a moment of boredom.<br /><br />Looking forward to more releases by Marvel. Great family fun.

B008TMA1LY|3.0|Downloaded free version for 4 year old granddaughter. After about 20 minutes it is too hard and too fast for her to manage. I got caught up for an hour or so and even spent $10 for another character in order to advance. Now I am trying to play as long as I can without spending any money. I have to say, when I reach the point where I am maxed out and would need to pay to continue I will delete the game. It's just not worth the prices they want to charge. Oh well....
B00A1ZW1JC|5.0|Quite the episode!  Watching this felt like getting sucker punched....three different times!  This would be the type of episode one would expect to close out the first half of a season, not air mearly four weeks into it.  Makes me wonder just what those crafty-minded writers have in store for us coming up these next few weeks. Quite different from the graphic novels in terms of events and major character revelations/deaths. This one made me realize how much empathy I have for these characters - even the ones I didn't particularly like. Andrew Lincoln's performance at the end was fabulous and really drove it all home.  They certainly seem to be pulling out all the stops for this third season, so let's hope they can keep up the pace for the extended 16 episodes. Amazing show!

I was saddened that it became a war on civillans from all three countries. Then our country with the Atom bomb on Japan. How nice. Perhaps us so-called intelligent creatures should become extinct. Again an insightful read. ---Wanted me to question our cancerous dominance on this planet.

Kinda speechless. It speaks for itself. Beautiful recording. Love it so...
B005PR2FD8|4.0|I'm a big Tekken fan, but fell off the train some time after Tekken Tag Tournament 1. When I heard Tekken Tag Tournament 2 was being released, I had to get it, but I wanted to catch up on the story and new characters first. One character in particular stood out to me as particularly interesting - Alisa Bosconovitch - and a friend of mine recommended I watch this movie since she's basically the main character.<br /><br />I'm really glad I did! There was so much to love about the movie, and it really drew me back into my Tekken fandom by reminding me just how good the characters really are, and how deep and interesting the world of Tekken is. It certainly whet my appetite for Tekken Tag Tournament 2.<br /><br />First off, the animation in this film is absolutely gorgeous. The bright colors, the lighting, and the fluid movements and loving detail in each character is astounding. The film is really a treat for the eyes. Whether it's a simple conversation between two characters, or one of the film's astounding fight scenes, it's really just a pleasure to watch, even on a standard DVD.<br /><br />Speaking of the fight scenes, I really have to give special mention to them. They are AWESOME. They really capture the feel of the Tekken series - helps that all of the moves used in them are straight out of the game - and are brilliantly exciting and animated to perfection. There is one in particular, near the middle of the film, that had my mouth agape. So well-done. It's worth watching the movie just for that, in my opinion.<br /><br />Of course, it helps that the plot of the movie is quite interesting. Yes, it requires foreknowledge of the Tekken storyline, and when I first watched the film I was confused as to why certain things seemed to come out of nowhere. However, on a second viewing after I had caught up on the series' story, I was impressed with the amount of foreshadowing and callbacks to the game there were. I will say that parts of it do require accepting the \\"scientific\\" explanations at face value, but I had no problem suspending my disbelief and there was nothing that really pulled me out of the illusion too badly.<br /><br />As for audio, I can't comment on the English dub, but the Japanese voicework is great, with Alisa especially sounding adorable and ranged. The music as is to be expected of the Tekken series is fantastic, fitting the atmosphere of scenes to a T.<br /><br />I've heard complaints that the film isn't action-oriented enough, or focuses too much on the \\"high school drama\\" between Alisa and Xiaoyu. If anything, I felt this was one of the movie's biggest strengths. Tekken's world is populated with fantastic characters, so it was nice to see many of them get their due. Lee in particular was one of the film's biggest standouts, and this film really made me love the character. The fact that the fight scenes were kept far apart from each other made each of them that much more special, and as said before they were impeccably choreographed and animated.<br /><br />Of course, this film isn't perfect. The story may be a bit confusing to some, especially if you're not a fan of the series, and your enjoyment of the film really depends on your enjoyment of the characters. As someone who really likes the characters they chose to focus on, I had a blast, but other fans may not be so kind towards it.<br /><br />All in all, I thought it was a great film - one that triumphantly defies the accepted notion that movies based on videogames are terrible - and am pleased to have it in my DVD collection. Gorgeous animations, likeable characters, and an interesting story all tied together to make an entertaining romp I would watch again and again. Check it out.tific\\" explanations at face value, but I had no problem suspending my disbelief and there was nothing that really pulled me out of the illusion too badly.<br /><br />As for audio, I can't comment on the English dub, but the Japanese voicework is great, with Alisa especially sounding adorable and ranged.

B005FISBTO|4.0|The sixth season is a nice series of episodes, although the end of the last episode was quite abrupt. It was shocking that his sister Deb could see him in 'his way of killing' action. The episode with the ghost of his dead brother being present in a follow-up of the Trinity murder case was disappointing. His dead brother should have remained out of the series.<br />All and all it is worth watching this sixth season. After the 'time wasting' episode follow-up of the Trinity murder case, you are glued to your TV screen, as much glued and puzzled as you were before, during the previous seasons.<br />Looking forward to the seventh season.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I really did not like this book - would not have finished it if it hadn't been a book club selection.  I did not like the characters - I did not get emotionally involved in the book - I didn't care how it ended - the only positive thing I can say is that Gillian Flynn is a very skilled author to keep me remotely interested - have heard many others who felt the same way.  Do you remember the story of &#34;The Emperor's New Clothes&#34;?  That is the way I feel about this book being on the Best Seller List for so long - it's all done with mirrors.
B001BC2ZS6|4.0|'Merica done right--in a righteous book. And now, because I need a few more words to finish the review, blah.
B0094FQZTM|5.0|There seems to be two types of Tiamat fans out there - The ones who keep clamoring for the old black metal days (guys, it's been 20 years, time to move on), and those like myself that feel Tiamat excel best at their more gloomy psychedelic goth rock. Well, I'm glad to announce that if you are the latter, you will absolutely be pleased by The Scarred People.<br /><br />While Amanethes was a perfect album in my eyes musically, for some reason Johan's vocals were a bit off - Tracks like Lucienne and Until the Hellhounds Sleep Again showed Johan's voice cracked and shaky, trying to hit dramatic low notes that he probably shouldn't have. It ended up sounding a bit corny. Still, I've come to enjoy the album as one of my favorites. I'm happy to report that Johan's vocals on The Scarred People go back to the more smooth dark delivery he had on Skeleton Skeletron and Prey, though much lower in the mix this time around.<br /><br />Musically, the album seems to be a mix between the full-on goth/blues rock of Judas Christ and the slow, psychedelic somberness of A Deeper Kind of Slumber. I was so pleased that they went back to these styles because speaking personally, I became a fan of the band during the A Deeper Kind of Slumber years so this record is a return to form in my eyes.<br /><br />Tracks like Winter Dawn, Love Terrorists, and The Sun Also Rises just ooze atmosphere and melancholy. Lots of dark electronic undertones swirl against the increasingly Floydian guitars. As a matter of fact, the whole record is pretty much a mid-tempo atmospheric ride into Johan Edlund's mind and the experiences he's had over the last 4 years as he stated in a recent interview. The only upbeat rockers on this record are the former Lucyfire demo Thunder & Lightning, one of the album's finest cuts, and the title track which oddly enough, is the weakest song on the record in my eyes (the chorus is ultimately not memorable).  Messinian Letter is a full on heartfelt acoustic rock song that almost entirely echoes Heaven of High from Judas Christ and Meliae from Amanethes, though Meliae is still a superior song in my eyes. The album ends on the crushingly sad and powerful sounding The Red of The Morning Sun.<br /><br />Also tying the record to the Deeper Kind of Slumber days is the use of acoustic guitar passages (Tiznit) and connecting short guitar jams (Before Another Wildbury Dies) - both passable, unless listening to the record as a whole. The bonus songs are covers and live tracks. Born to Die is a cover of a 2011 track by Lana Del Ray (who?). Some indie pop song. Truthfully would have been better left off the record. The other bonus track Paradise is a cover of a Bruce Springsteen song from 2001. It's not my cup of tea, but it's the first Tiamat album where bassist Anders Iwers does lead vocals. It's interesting to say the least. The live tracks are Cain and Divided from a 2010 show.<br /><br />All in all, unless you have been keeping track of the band these last 15 years, there will be little here to appreciate. Tiamat is an atmospheric goth rock act - that's what they do best and The Scarred People proves this. Fans of the band will be pleased. Those still wishing for Wildhoney part 2 will continue to be in denial.<br /><br />Don't miss this soon to be sleeper hit of 2012. Far superior to new works released by Katatonia or My Dying Bride.<br /><br />Essential Tiamat.entirely echoes Heaven of High from Judas Christ and Meliae from Amanethes, though Meliae is still a superior song in my eyes.

B004J4WLB4|5.0|This novel really delves deeply into the mindset of just one of so many kids \\"in the system\\" without being melodramatic or at all contrite.  It made me laugh, cry and really appreciate all the sacrifices foster parents and adoptive parents make to save the souls of children who have suffered and need someone to love, encourage and believe in them.  I loved--and at times, hated--Victoria, Elizabeth and Grant, but mostly, it was a page turner that ended in love for all the characters.

0375869026|5.0|There's just something so powerful about what R.J. Palacio has created with WONDER. The world of upper elementary and middle school teachers and librarians has been all abuzz about this book since February, and I knew it was a book I would have to read, but I also knew it would be a book that I would likely want to use for a read aloud with my students, so I held off until close to going back to school so it would be fresh in my mind. If you still haven't gotten to it yet, I urge you to do so as soon as you can because this is one of those books that must be read and shared with children and teens. Even if you don't have or work with kids, read it, and share it with someone who does. This is one of those titles that exemplified for me the power of Twitter - I may not have known about it if it wasn't for my Personal Learning Network out there, and I am so thankful that I have.<br /><br />WONDER is a book that makes you think. It brings up the hidden parts of all of us that you may be ashamed of, brings it to light, and helps you to know how to do it better. It's about acceptance and understanding. It's about being...no...choosing kind. It's about relationships. It's about family and parents and siblings and friendships and school and teachers and students and principals and how all of those people interact to create someone's experience. It highlights the importance of adult interactions with children. It highlights the importance of both verbal and non-verbal behaviors and how those can impact someone's view of others and one's self. It highlights our fears and our hopes and our dreams. It makes you think and leaves you a better person than when you entered this story. It's the wonder of WONDER (#wonderofwonder).<br /><br />I could get into some of the specifics of this book. The way Palacio chose to write so splendidly and honestly in Auggie's voice. The way Auggie helps us to see inside the mind of someone we may have known or seen in the past, and what our actions may have meant to them. The way the various voices that get to tell this story enhance the reader's experience so much. The way the use of emails and letters in certain parts highlights important moments in the story. The way Palacio flawlessly interweaves the multiple storylines and characters' experiences to create this complete book. The way that this realistic story can appeal to upper elementary students, middle school students, high school students, and adults. The way it opens a readers' eyes to actions and thoughts that may be hard to be honest about. The way it creates precepts for life that could make all the difference. But the experience of this book is about so much more than that. It's about the human experience, and how we can all be better at it.<br /><br />I can only be thankful that so many students will be experiencing WONDER in their classrooms this year. I can only be thankful that R.J. Palacio's story may make those children take a second to think differently about bullying, and even more than that, their simpler interactions with others. I can only be thankful that the message to Choose Kind is permeating the world of education this year. We can only hope that more people get this message and pass it on, and the way to start is by sharing this book with others. So I encourage you to read WONDER, to pass it along to others, and to always choose kind.s may have meant to them.

So I encourage you to read WONDER, to pass it along to others, and to always choose kind.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|This book is a touching book about a love and a tragedy. I love this book and would read it again over and over
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|Playing this on my kindle i have more space to draw so its probably a bit easier then others.I am surprised by some of the words it gives as a choice.So i give it 3 stars cause its ok.It seems as though you end up needing to give description as oppose to drawing a picture maybe half the time unless you draw well(i don't).But hey it kills time and its ok so i keep playing.
B009YDB2QK|5.0|Best show on TV but I live out in the country and only have two channels.  I watch the shows a day after it is aired.  nothing negative to say about the show or the video service.  Also...it rocks on my kindle Fire HD!
B0083SBJXS|5.0|I love super hero movies. This is a fun movie to watch. It has a few places that made me laugh because of a surprise gag. I especially enjoyed the scenes with the hulk. Marvel rocks. They know how to make great hero movies.
B008XG1X18|4.0|Love this app and site - it's my favorites source for \\"pinspiration\\" (sorry, had to!). It's a tiny bit glitchy on my iPhone, but seems to work flawlessly on the Kindle.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|Great show (not as good as the previous season) but I got ripped off by Amazon being that season 4 came on netflix the next day. I will reconsider making amazon video purchases in the future.
B008RYN44U|1.0|Dude. DUDE. I can honestly say from the cover, I wasn't quite sure what to expect. Some sort of futuristic electronic ska, perhaps? A rock based beat with a pulsating synthesizer organizing it? No. What even is this, DUDE?!! Some sort of funked up dance hall electronic pop and it sucks a lily white lonely goatherder's as.
B002VECM72|4.0|The Blind Side tells the story of Michael Oher, a homeless kid from the projects who is taken in by a devout Christian family and made part of their family.  They see to it that he gets a good private education, so he can earn a football scholarship.  Oher eventually becomes an All-American at Ole Miss and then the first-round draft choice for the Baltimore Ravens.<br /><br />The story is well-told and inspiring.  Sandra Bullock is particularly good as the mother, Leigh Anne Tuohy.  Bullock won the Academy Award for Best Actress, as well as the Critic's Choice, Golden Globe, Screen Actors' Guild and People's Choice awards.  Ironically, Bullock had turned down the role three times because of her concerns about playing a devout Christian.  After accepting the role, she almost quit a couple of weeks into filming, because she thought her acting was doing an injustice to Tuohy.  Apparently not!<br /><br />The blu-ray transfer is great.  Visuals and audio are both strong.  The disc contains interviews with Michael Oher, Aaron Quinton (who played Oher), Leigh Anne Tuohy and Sandra Bullock.  Parental Advisory: While the movie does feature one scene of violence and a couple of allusions to sex and drugs, it is suitable for family viewing.  The Tuohys are commendable for their care of Michael.  The power of their example outweighs a couple of minor negative elements that might necessitate a word of explanation for very small children.<br /><br />One goof in the film.  Above the gate at the Christian school, is an inscription that says, \\"With man this is possible, but with God all things are possible.\\"  This is a misquotation from Matthew 19:26, which says, \\"With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.\\"  Apart from this, the movie makers handled the Christian aspects of the film quite well.<br /><br />I highly recommend The Blind Side.  While it does take some liberties with the true story of Michael Oher, it nevertheless gets the basic story right.  The result is heart-warming.result is heart-warming.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|DeMille is back to being his old self and wisecracking John Corey is back thank goodness.<br /><br />Thanks for going back to the wisecracking and sarcasm.<br /><br />Amethyst21447@yahoo.com
B0096PAA6E|5.0|This album blew me away!  First of all ... I've known about Gary Clark Jr. for about three days now.  I saw him in a video of a live performance of \\"Bright Lights\\" and I was completely blown away.  Immediately got online and downloaded this entire CD.  After hearing the whole album about ten times now - I'm completely in love with it.  I don't EVER get excited by music anymore, but this guy is such a genius I go around to friends and co-workers now saying ... \\"Have you ever listened to Gary Clark Jr.?\\"<br /><br />Seriously - this guy nails it and two or three of him would revive rock and roll and the blues and wake those genres up from the sleepy state they've been in for about two decades.<br /><br />Okay - this album ... it receives criticism because it seems to be \\"all over the place\\" - but that's EXACTLY Gary's strength here.  First, let's remember here that Gary's always said that he was influenced by ALL genres of music - including country music.  Yeah, it's pretty unexpected that Gary didn't stay well within the lifelines of the \\"Blues\\" but he's making a bold statement about himself here that he's not going to be \\"labeled\\" by anyone.<br /><br />This album has Blues - done right.  Funk - done right. Psychedelic - done right. Hip Hop, Bee-bop - all done right.  If you want an album where every song sounds the same - go buy something by BOSTON.  If you want something that will send a chill up your spine every song - buy this!<br /><br />I'm NOT even a fan of Hip Hop - yet the Hip Hop influence on this album makes me feel GOOD.  Gary just \\"lifted\\" the good and meaningful parts of the Hip Hop genre right out of their box and laid them all out on this album in a way everyone can enjoy.  I was playing this in my work center yesterday and a co-worker (also a hip hop hater) came into my cube and remarked ... \\"Damn, this is a pretty damn good groove here - who is that?\\"<br /><br />Psychedelic ... AMAZING!  Dude, here we are here in the 21st century and we have this black guy from Texas belting out some of the best psychedelic sounds we've heard in a generation!  He's belting these sounds out on an Epiphone Casino (same guitar John Lennon and George Harrison used for years - and the same one that Paul McCartney said that if he \\"could only have one guitar - this would be the one\\".)  NOBODY plays a Casino anymore!  But Gary has his Casinos and he's fuzzin' 'em out with some kind of fuzz box and it all just puts you back into the time of Jimi Hendrix.  And yeah - you can hear a lot of the Hendrix sound on this album.<br /><br />I know a lot of people wanted for Gary to be TRUE to the Blues but people - this guy is far too talented to be put in any kind of box.  Leave this guy to his own devices - and I guarantee he'll start a new musical revolution that will shake up the airwaves once again.  There's no doubt in my mind that this guy is going to be a heavy influence on young players coming up in the ranks today.
B0026RHR6K|5.0|Excellent product and great price. The bonus Cylon figure was a nice bonus too. Postage was very reasonable and the purchase price was very good. Pity it is region one, but hey, I'll cope. good work Amazon  ;-D
B0027MJU00|5.0|This book keeps you on the edge if your seat. I literally could not put it down because I had to know what happened next. Deep troubled characters that are flawed and human.
B004M8S3Y6|5.0|I'm in the process of testing the solutions but it surely is an eye opener! Worth reading if you're open for change.
B008BD9SI8|5.0|Abercrombie set this new First law setting novel in a western film fashion, an does it amazingly well.<br />If you enjoyed his previous works you will be pleasantly surprised with what changes and what doesn`t.
B008Q09K2U|2.0|this was the most dissapointing book ever from Nelson DeMille. I had prebooked it for many weeks and having waited so long and for 75% of the book I was bored out of my mind the only redeeming part was in the last 25% hence the 2 stars. I love DeMille's work and normally rate 4-5 stars but this was discouraging. I hope his future writings will be improved dramatically.
B005STGIYA|5.0|Got this on vinyl (note that it is not 180 grams). Had never tried this one previously but other reviews, particularly claims that this was one of their best and the 2nd album really shows a different side etc made me curious. I have to agree with those rave reviews. And absolutely no complaints about the vinyl (not sure why they did not go with the 180 grams and honestly did not realize that until I got it but am definitely keeping the one I have). Also note that there are no liner notes etc but the free mp3 download (which it does include)is always a very cool and welcome.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book makes you glad to be normal!  It starts a bit slowly but delivers a roller coaster ride with somewhat of an anticlimactic end.  I do recommend.
B00A1ZW1JC|5.0|Wow this show is amazing. Im a 38 year old man and im literally crying over the ending part to Episode 4 season 3. Words cant explain how great this show has been week after week after week. Its addicting and thank you amazon for giving us the option to buy the episode a day after it airs for those of us who don't have cable. I just cant think of a way this show can get any better. Thats the gods honest truth.
B0085RQLXK|5.0|Its funny how people have already rated something.before it has come out or before they have even heard it but i really love this album and its a great buy and for those who wrote these long review yall need to shut up and learn more about music before commenting and even if you are trying to rate this because you either hate aerosmith or you just pretend to know about aerosmith you dont dare rate this so please do us all a favor and SHUT UP
B006LSZECO|3.0|Story line was great with many surprising, unexpected twists. I enjoyed reading the book and had a heard fine putting the book down Disappointing ending.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|I had never read the book before this, seen many versions in movies. It's a great read and hard to put down. I recommend getting a copy of this book
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Clean and clears everything that you are not using cached. I have been have a lot of problems getting space l! Works Great!!!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|People make fun of me for loving this game but I do not care! It is mindless, addictive fun and a great little way to clear my head when I am stressed.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|this game is so much fun! and you don't see a lot of games that are free well good news its free . If you are in to adventures this is the game for you!
B004UNX1LS|4.0|its a good app runs good and fast picture is clear it dosent lag overall its a good app as usual amazon has good apps
B004XISI4A|4.0|Just when you thought they had killed off one of your favourite Characters, they come back again. Only half way through this and love it as I did with all the other books.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Good game, but gets a little boring after a while. Needs more variations of the dozer to keep it interesting. Could be a great game with a little work.
B006VREQ0G|4.0|It was interesting. I don't have time to devote to watching it right now though. So, if you are a busy person, probably not for you.
B0061JPT46|5.0|I had this album on vynil when I was young. I searched for it for years as an older adult. I was thrilled to find it on Amazon, and for a very good price. I love this music. It's uplifting for me, and it brings back a lot of memories. It is unfortunate that I didn't get the chance to store it in my computer before my move from Florida to Ohio as I seemed to have lost it in the move somehow. At least I got to listen to it once.
B006VREN86|4.0|It was interesting. I don't have time to devote to watching it right now though. So, if you are a busy person, probably not for you.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The whole series is awesome.  Could not stop reading it.  Finished the book in no time. Recommend as good reading.
B004L3AQFG|1.0|It has been documented that animals do it all the time, when they get trapped for instance.<br />They do it in way less than 127 hours, as such a long time would expose them to predators and would also lead to starvation...C-
B009NQKXYK|3.0|The movie was good with visual effects but had a poor story..<br />The edited portion should not have been edited
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love this game.  The variety of dragons is great.  I love all the different colors.  I wish some of the plants didn't cost so much to remove and that there were more dragons you could purchase with money instead of gold.
B000V6BE6C|1.0|look, avenged sevenfold got some decent songs, but most of what they create is not really inspired....they sound like a mix of many past bands....but what i gotta say is this front cover.......HEEEEEYYYY!!!! you guys from avenged never heard about the classic THrash band OVERKILL?????? this front cover is EXACTLY the same persona of CHALY, the classic OVERKILL skull bat creature.....man, unfortunatelly Chaly can´t reclaim his place.....i could give 2 stars to this korn megadeth without talent clone, but for TOTALLY ripping off OVERKILL´s mascot i give this uninspired album 1 star..........
B007UXSPK2|4.0|THIS MOVIE IS REALLY GOOD THOUGH IM NOT A FAN OF THE STAR OF THIS ONE. BUT ANYWAYS I LIKE IT.
B003OF3R0S|1.0|avenged sevenfold is a clone of many bands i like, like megadeth and metallica with some nu metal, and really uninspired lyrics.....but what amazes me, is the fact that avenged TOTALLY clone the classic OVERKILL mascot CHALY, the bat skull creature.......WOW!!!!! OVERKILL still reigns in the THRASH world, but seems like avenged never heard about it....or even worse, THEY REALLY RIPP OFF OVERKILL.....REALLY BAD, reminds me of Godsmack ripping off the sun logo of ALICE IN CHAINS.......
B008OOYALE|1.0|If you have a ton of money and you want to give it to TeamLava, this is for you, and I have a bridge to sell you. Dragon Habitats are your income providers. Oh, you'll see people with them, but you poor people are just going to be limited immediately. You're going to be at level 7 a long time! The habitats have a cap or limit on the amount of money they will hold for you. Evolving your dragon is simple, and it gives you a decent income. The farms work most efficiently when you pump out $30 for  food in 30 seconds. You have to touch, and touch, and touch those farms and habitats, or you're losing money. This game puts obstacles in front of intellectual players on purpose and rewards simple, small, underwhelming tasks. The only fun thing to do is touch a habitat to collect $1 and watch 12 silver coins explode all over the landscape.
B0000AGWJ7|1.0|avenged sevenfold is not good at all....their sound is a mix of many past bands like metallica, megadeth and korn with a POP feeling and bad lyrics.....i can only totally agree with what another reviewer write......HEYYYY, OVERKILL!!!!!!!! this band is REALLY STEALING the skull bat creature you guys create to your front covers!!!!! many avenged covers got this skull bat clone.....man, if they don´t know what is OVERKILL, a classic thrash metal band, is a shame....but if they know, it´s a TOTAL RIPP OFF!!!!!!!i can list a really really big list of better bands than avenged sevenfold, but try the bands they try to copy like metallica, megadeth and pantera......
B008JGSM6G|5.0|it is so easy becaese all you have to do is conekt to the color that matches the color of the string
B008QE9VJI|2.0|EVEN THOUGH I BOUGHT THIS I DONT RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE ITS YOUR TYPICAL TIM BURTON MOVIE. NOT MUCH OF THE MOVIE REALLY KEPT WITH THE ORIGINAL SHOW AND A FEW OF THE ORIGINAL CAST MEMEMBERS HAD VERY SMALL PART ALL THEY DID WAS JUST WALK INTO THE PARTY. AND WHO EVER HEARD OF HAVING ALICE COOPER IN THE MOVIE.
B004UID2LC|2.0|Ok, at first it lets you download music from youtube to ur amazon cloud storage but then the freaking app DOESNT let you download at ALL!!!!! And sometimeswhen it does it says Playback Error Unable To Play. FIX THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0067RQYNW|4.0|The only fault I have with KingSoft Office is it won't handle OpenOffice files. I use OpenOffice on my desktop and I can't open them on my Android tablet.
B0086700CM|1.0|at first it was ok but when I got it updated it got all laggy and keept making me die Never get this app because the version of suckiness is 100% they need to get the ap store like the opossum not the andriod
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|went for the update freezes screen up to where nothing. can be done ...I lost everything..fix...I was gonna give it 5 stars but now a neg
B007THA4FI|3.0|I bought this book expecting J.K. Rowling to transport me on an exploration of British society. I got quite an exploration of a side of Britain I hadn't seen before; but one I would have rather not explored.<br /><br />The author carefully builds characters and dialogue so well, they seem like real living people--no fiction, plenty of reality. I am a person who likes to read about someone doing courageous things and/or helping others achieve their best. The only character in The Casual Vacancy deserving of that description dies at the very beginning of the book and the suffering people of Pagford and Yarvil march from there to the pointless death of two children, countless family relations broken, and several careers trashed by the end of the book.<br /><br />I look forward with hopeful optimism to J.K. Rowling's next offering.
B008OOYALE|5.0|A bunch of differant dragons. Able to set down and pick up later. Also has seasonal dragons that you can buy.
B000W93CHC|5.0|Wonderful story.... You feel like you are IN it, rather than observing....quite a trick, considering it thes place in the Middle Ages. I recommend it to all my friends and relatives....Esp the ones who think we are living in th &#34;end times&#34;. :-) Great book by a great author. His best.
B009AJDDQU|5.0|I watch this all the time.  This is actually the first movie I purchased on Amazon instant video, and I love it I can watch it anywhere and the HD quality is on point!  Amazing movie if you haven't seen it I would recommend it to anyone that enjoys a good Sci-Fi movie that has a bit of suspense and even horror in it.
B000J103WK|1.0|This DVD had no data on the disc. We did not open the package for over two months from the time it arrived. We did not know it was blank until I attempted to play it. We tried it on two DVD players that are otherwise working fine and then tried it on a dvd player in our computer.<br /><br />I previously rated the transactions as a 5 star because of the quick delivery. However I need to change that to a 1 star minus due to the missing data on the disc.<br /><br />Hoping for a replacement but navigating thru the return options is difficult.
B008X9Z3UC|5.0|It is just what I wanted. I did want a case that stays attached while using the Kindle. It is great for protecting the Kindle when it is not in use. The Kindle also fits in it perfectly.
B0085Z8F4A|4.0|[[ASIN:B0085Z8F4A Prometheus (Blu-ray 3D/ Blu-ray/ DVD/ Digital Copy)]]. Wondrous Visuals..Uneven plot..The movie inspires debate...I'll make this short and sweet...This set is loaded with content great stuff...The picture quality on both 3-d and 2-d blu-rays are absolutely astounding possibly the best I've seen..The sound is window rattling goodness to say the least..if you have the proper system WOW! If your fan..I'd say its a must buy..just be prepared for some let down with the silly plot.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love my Kindle Fire and when I had issues with charging, Amazon was right there.  They sent me a charger, but that didn't work for more than a month or two.  I called them and told them that the only way it would charge is if I held the charger to the Kindle myself until it charged.  They said that was not acceptable and sent me a new Kindle Fire.  All I had to do is return the old Kindle and charger in their box and they even emailed me lables so that it would not cost me.  I recommend Amazon to anyone who wants anything that they carry before going elsewhere.  They are AWESOME at taking care of their customers.  Thank you Amazon...
B003R4ZMNQ|2.0|I INJOYED THIS SHOW VERY MUCH, BUT THERE ARE TO MANY BIKINI GIRLS IN THERE, MACGARET IS SO GOOD BUT HIS TATOOS SPOILES IT, I LOVE MACGARET AND DANNY TOGETHER.IM NOT BUYING THE MOVIE BECOUSE ITS NOT A FAMILY MOVIE.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|THis game is awsome everybody has got to try this game!!!!!!!! 4 a reason ok dose evetydody hear me clerly
B0091REZMW|5.0|Very neat graphics, love each room &amp; level with the challenge that comes with it.  Enjoy how it changes each time.
B008VBYN80|5.0|Lots of fun. Good graphics and keeps me interested. I wish you could play the game longer rather than waiting for the energy bar to recover.
B008O9V4C2|5.0|A new Donald Fagan/Walter Becker/Steeley Dan album is an automatic purchase. Sunken Condos could have been half as good as it is and still met the high expectations that accompany a DF release.  I agree with an earlier reviewer who boldly stated that this is better than Nightfly.  At first listen, it was a bit of a stretch, but NF is a familiar classic.  After about 20 listens, SC is now a familiar classic.  I think it is the best release from DF (and related) sinc AJA....  The only problem is that I can't stop playing this album and can't get the songs out of my head.  It is a rare thing to find someone who has been making music this long come out with something this good.  Regarding the negative or even mediocre reviews.... I do know some people who don't like champaign or chocolate.....  They are entitled to their tastes, but champaign and chocolate are still really good!
B00503BN1M|5.0|this movie was great, had a great story line. Also it doesnt end when you expect it too, i would recommend this movie. not a corny ashton kutcher movie.
B009LRE040|5.0|we all know what happen in Aurora, its where I live I had to see it twice and let me tell you there is no force in this world that will ever stop me from watching it again.One of the best Batman movies to date it ends the trilogy quite nicely (and parents to children if you are not sure if you should let them watch it. It would be a disservice to all who was affected by the Aurora shooting If you chose not to let your children see it) This movie truly shows that good will always prevail and it compliments the spirit of Batman to the entirety.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|i love it!! its soo addicting. one of the best games ever. i would recommend it to anyone who's looking for a distraction.
B002UBRFDC|2.0|The book started out with potential but I got bored. Way too much time given to scenes that go nowhere and add nothing to the story. And full of lazy dialogue 'he said.. she said.. he said.. then he said...' Man it was like reading a script, not a novel. I stopped reading 1/3 way through and started on Life of Pi instead (excellent book by the way). Life's too short to read crap books.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|its very good to occupy little kids when you need them to stay in one place I guess it can occupy anybody
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Love it, great game to keep you busy. You can play in short little spurts or for a longer time
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Another great book well written by Nelson DeMille.  He has a way of drawing you into the story.  Have enjoyed all of his books thus far.
B0030B624E|5.0|Fun movie.  Everything a zombie movie should be.  Scary, funny and action packed.  Then to top it all off it has Bill Murry, at least briefly.  Wish they would make another one.
B0055EAJ7A|5.0|Stunning 3D effects, GREAT MOVIE.  Recomend going back and seeing Captain America, The Avengers, as well it will give more clarity to the relationships between the characters.  Awesome!
B008OOYALE|1.0|this game is slow and there are way too many ads. why do they make us buy stuff??? cant all the gold be earned in ways other than cash?!?!? worst game ever.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book made me cry the whole time. Like I was there with everyone, going through what they were going through
B00992CF6W|4.0|My little brother loves it and built amazing things on it, but for some reason it deleted all of the progress! All his buildings were lost! Every time I went on the world it restarted it like no one played that world yet. It wouldn't even let me delete any worlds, so I had to re download it. I just hope that doesn't happen again. Other than that it is a great game! There aren't many items though.
B00846REIS|5.0|By far better than Fifty.....Reflected In You is even better..Can't wait till May 2013 for Entwined In You!!!!  Can she move the publishing date up????  Please!!!
B0098VXBIA|4.0|Not sure if the moms-to-be or the dads-to-be we're funnier!  Enjoyed by both men and women, much more than a chick flick!
0312360258|5.0|This book is wonderfully written and I am very picky about what I read and this is something I would recommend anyone to read. The characters are so alive in it that I can picture the character instead of having to guess what they look like. Also a lot of people say its to \\"cliche\\" but that is b.s. because I have read a lot of books in my life and this book is definitley one of the best ones I have ever read.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Another great read by Patricia Cornwell.  I purchased a copy for my daughter as well!<br />I love all of the Kay Scarpeta novels and this one dosen't dissappoint.
B009NPM5Y2|5.0|Great music & acting. Not one bad thing to say about it. Who knew Tom Cruise could really sing.  All the cast were amazing.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|Worst use of 3D of any movie I've seen. Terrible script. Not worth the money. This movie was shot using all 3D rigs. Did not read the reviews beforehand. Expected much more from the maker of so many other good films. 'Blade Runner'...
0307956350|3.0|Sometimes a writer sets out to write a story that is full of turns and red herrings so as to make the novel 'interesting'.  Many times this will mean that the readers spends a lot of time trying to figure out what is worth reading and what can be skimmed.  With so much not being what it seems, skimming in this novel is almost impossible.  This is unfortunate because the book is a slow read and skimming could help with the continuity.  As others have mentioned, at times it's like reading a travelogue or 'what I did this summer/winter/vacation' etc.  Way too much about Luxembourg and the countryside surrounding it.<br /><br />The story starts out very slowly and builds while we learn more and more about the four main protagonists. At a certain point (pick your own) you start to think, OK enough surprises already, lets finish up in some semblance of sanity.  But it goes on and on with twist and turns and lies and half-lies and more lies and volte-faces to the point where I didn't care anymore.  My last surprise was that it didn't really end, just sort of petered out.<br /><br />Zeb Kantrowitz
B000UZPIAW|5.0|I have always been a fan of Nikki both as a musician and a person. This only enlightened me to just how amazing he is for getting through such a hellish life. I love this book and would recommend to anyone! I will definitely read again!
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|I have to say I was surprised at how much I liked this show. Great show with a little humor thrown in to boot. We'll be watching it again soon.
B007WA56SC|5.0|Such a great selection of songs! Anything Kylie is amazing and this set just shows how many hits she has had through her 25 year + career! A great buy for sure and also check out her abbey road sessions!
B009NQKPUW|5.0|It a great movie. I liked a lot. It has real meaning which everyone should see. I really really enjoyed watching it.
B000WXVJ6Y|5.0|So it's no no doubt but it's a great solo record by gwen.I mean why go solo if your gonna do the same style in music? So props to gwen for going for a new sound in her solo career! The concert was great as well! Love gwen and love no doubt! :)
B008OOYALE|1.0|Force Closes periodically for the Kindle Fire. I've been playing it for over a year and now I can't even open it. This STINKS!!!!!!!!!!!
B0096I9UTE|5.0|Wow what a great way to hear all her big hits in a new way! Especially when you play her other albums over and over llike me! Great album this is and her voice is so sweet and so full of power! Her tours are great fun as well! Love this woman!!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|The story starts out with action and the author just keeps on going.<br />Reminiscent of the MacGyver series in many ways, just really enjoyed it
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Excellent historical novel about the events leading up to and including WWI. Describes the dramatic changes in European and American society brought on by this world conflict. Quite lenthy, but entertaining.
B0086700CM|5.0|Really fun. It's a good quick game,  that doesn't feel like a waste. Highly recommended if you're looking for a good quaility runner game.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Love them all. This is my favorite. A bit graphic at times ha ha but overall a great read. Can't wait to finish the third!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Such a great love story! Can't wait to see who they will get to play Grey, Anna and Mrs. Robertson!
B0063IH60K|3.0|this game is easy to play and it is highly addictive. I play this game all the time.I love solitaire both online and offline.

B007HU7NBK|4.0|Light on details, but loaded with enthusiasm, John Taylor's book is best for fans of Duran Duran.  Those with a casual interest will lose said interest quickly and no great questions are answered that diehards may waiting for.  Still, it's an enjoyable read and Taylor's \\"Gosh, I've had a fun life\\" attitude shines through on every page.  It's worth reading just for that fact.
B004BLDD9Y|1.0|This light bulb looks like a really great idea, except that amazon.com fulfillment means that the protective airbags in the delivery box are placed so as to expose delicate items to the maximum of external impact. In this case, the plastic globe of the light bulb was broken, leaving the interior of the bulb exposed.<br /><br />Come to think of it, the bulb could have been designed with a much stronger bulb materiel, so as to make such breakage not occur, even when shipped by amazon.<br /><br />So, to resume, there are two problems here. The usual sabotaged amazon packaging is one problem, and the possibility of breakage after successful shipment is the second problem. I think I'll shop elsewhere for items of fragile design.
B0085RQLXK|4.0|I'm giving this one by Aerosmith 4 stars here on Amazon's system because that translates to \\"I Like It.\\"  I've been a fan of Aerosmith for years and first discovered them in high school when \\"Permanent Vacation\\" was released.  That was the first is a four album run that is hard to beat \\"Permanent Vacation,\\" \\"Pump,\\" \\"Get A Grip\\" and \\"Nine Lives.\\"  Of course, I then discovered the 70's material that just absolutely blew me away.  I find it hard to give bands like this star ratings because it is so very hard for them to live up to the legend that they've already created, usually making me want to rate new stuff lower in direct comparison to the classic music they've released in the past.  With that said, I was excited to see what they could produce since they hadn't released an album since 2004.<br /><br />\\"Music From Another Dimesion!\\" just seems to try too hard to figure out what kind of album it is supposed to be, often jumping from one music style to another within the same song.  It appears the intent was to mix the sounds of the past with new sounds, often to less than stellar results.  Steven Tyler's voice is showing its age and the songwriting is just not that great across the board.  There were multiple times when listening to this album where I caught lyrical references or guitar riffs that were pulled off of one of Aerosmith's hits from the past.  It just all seemed to make this album more of a cliche then a band moving forward.<br /><br />I really wish that I could say that there is a song or two on here that will be able to rise above and make its way along side legendary Aerosmith classics like \\"Dream On,\\" \\"Walk This Way,\\" or \\"Sweet Emotion\\" but after a few listens I still can't find it.  It seems that the most radio friendly song is the duet with country superstar Carrie Underwood entitled \\"Can't Stop Loving You\\" which is one of three ballads on the record.  That may seem like a lot of ballads for a rock album, but oddly enough that seems to be more and more the place where Aerosmith is shining.<br /><br />Sometimes, it does take music time to grow on me and I have to say I would have probably knocked off a star or maybe even two if I had reviewed this album after one listen.  After two or three it really did start to grow on me more and perhaps the expectations of waiting close to a decade for the album began to wash away.  There is no doubt in my mind that Aerosmith had a good time putting this record together and it shows in the playing, they can still rock out with the best of them.  And while there may not be any mega-hits here, it is a good sign that Aerosmith is still making music.  Now that they've shaken the rust off here, we can only hope the next album is not years and years away.<br /><br />The bottom line here will depend how big of an Aerosmith fan you are.  If you are a fan, like me, you will probably enjoy this one enough to have it in your catalog and you'll pull it out a few times a year.  If you are new to Aerosmith there are much better places to start with this band and if you're on the fence about Aerosmith this probably won't push your opinion of them one way or the other.more the place where Aerosmith is shining.<br /><br />Sometimes, it does take music time to grow on me and I have to say I would have probably knocked off a star or maybe even two if I had reviewed this album after one listen.

B000ME5B30|4.0|I really enjoyed this video and wish I owned a copy. It is a FAST-moving documentary on a controversial subject: global warming. The video was well-designed. We were required to watch this AND read transcripts from a show on Glenn Beck. It would APPEAR that there are missing pieces in the video presentation, but I think it is well worth the time to view and to consider the facts. We CAN (and do) contribute either to making our planet healthy - or UNhealthy. Check it out and see what you think. In fact, you can RENT this baby right here on Amazon.com! THAT was a super plus for me.

Once I looked up the instructions at [...], I was able to get this tiny product to work perfectly.  Keep it in your pocket and the headphones on your ears - you're all set - love this product (bought it because I can't stand the wires on my headphone and the headphone jack on my ipod touch BROKE so this was the alternative to buying a full fledged new ipod product). Highly recommended product, just make sure you install it correctly before you complain it doesn't work.
B00425S1H8|5.0|if your a mac person trying to do console work, you've probably been hunting high and low for a cable that works. I can positively confirm this works with 10.8.2 .  if you are looking for a genuine, up to date (HX Rev D) prolific chip based cable, this is for you. be warned as others have mentioned there are counterfeit chips going around in cheap cables.. I know this as I've purchased 2 so far from an unnamed auction site, and spent nearly 2 weeks trying to get them working.. Tried windows 7, tried mac 10.8, tried older windows xp, tried older mac 10.6. no luck. pure junk. This cable however is NOT junk. Upon receiving it, I downloaded the drivers from the Plugable website, and within 3 minutes It was showing up as a device, usbserial (I used ZTerm in this case).  Thank you Plugable for making a genuine cable (made in china sadly), that functions. I will recommend this cable for anyone who needs a serial cable without headaches and incompatibilities . I used the genuine prolific drivers. I didn't try the open source version with this cable, just fyi. I assume it would work (failberg is now just berg fyi, if you are hunting for the original site). Purchased and successfully used November 2012. Thank you plugable. This is also the least expensive genuine cable I have found.

0439023483|4.0|Sure, it's no Battle Royale, but The Hunger Games is pretty good none the less.  We get to see a Randian Post-Apocalyptic America (renamed) run by the Capitol (based in the Rockies).  What remains of the rest of the country, which revolted at one time, has been reduced to starvation level survival.  The Hunger Games are one of the ways the Capitol manages to keep the rest of the country under it's control.<br /><br />All-in-all, it's pretty good.
B008673ZAQ|3.0|I love Bared to you and was one the edge of my seat waiting for Reflected in you to come out.  (even after they moved the date of release and then to only release it early on kindle, it was so frustrating but I still wanted to read, it so I put up with it)  The second book was just not the same.  I will read the rest, but I think they cured my obsession and I will move on to another series, so I am not jerked around with release dates.  It makes me sad because I told many of my friends that I thought this was going to be better than 50 shades as a series,  now I am telling them, I was wrong and sorry for leading them down the wrong path.

1423140605|5.0|I cannot say enough good things about Rick Riordan. It should go without saying that he is a GENIUS, an absolute master storyteller! WHY Riordan's books have not enjoyed the same level of success as J.K. Rowling, I'll never know. Riordan's writing style, characters & plots are just as enchanting/engaging as Rowlings & while Riordan is extremely popular it's just not on the same scale. I've read THOUSANDS of books in my lifetime, my personal library is over a 1,000 books currently & Riordan's volumes earn a place of importance right next to several other favorites, namely Rowlings Harry Potyer series. Owning so many books can sometimes necessitate that I put volumes in storage, Riordan's are such favorites that even having read them several times over, I could never beat to store them.<br /><br />I've babbled enough! Onward!!! Though I'll try NOT to give anything away, I should state there WILL be possible ----->S-P-O-I-L-E-R-S&lt;----- AHEAD!!!! So read with the knowledge I might have some in my review.....<br /><br />The Mark Of Athena -<br />The Characters -<br />The Mark of Athena picks up where The Son of Neptune left off, the Greek & Roman Demigod camps are aware of each others existence but this is only a happy thing for a few chapters.<br /><br />Percy & Annabeth are reunited after months of anxiety on Annabeths part. Jason is back with his old Camp, New Rome & able to attempt to try & bridge the gap from Camp Half Blood to New Rome w/ Percy's assistance. Though it was a valiant effort, it doesn't work & our 7 Heros leave New Rome to answer the \\"call\\" of their quest with Romans right behind them. What follows is action, myth, comedy, friendship & young love (tastefully done) written as only Riordan can do.<br /><br />Our contingent of young Heros, Percy, Annabeth, Jason, Piper, Frank, Hazel & Leo set out to find the \\"Doors of Death\\" in Leo's ship the Argo II. This time around however the demigods are on their own. No godly parents popping up to lend a hand asthe Gods are suffering from the clash between the Greek & Roman sides of theirs personas meshing together. Mount Olympus is closed off to them. A few Gods make cameos in this book, but always in their Roman form, save just 1.<br /><br />This book as usual is written in a variety of POV's & is not hard to follow at all. Each chapter is \\"headed\\" with the name of the hero's POV that we are seeing. This time around we get a lot of Percy & Annabeth, Piper, Leo & Hazel. There's less from Jason & Frank, but I think this is due to the backstory of Percy/Annabeth, Annabeth's own singular quest to follow the mark of Athena & to explore how exactly Leo & Hazel are connected prior to this story. Piper comes into play as a much stronger character this time around, less self doubt on her part makes her a bigger time player this volume. Young girls should really like how her character is developed, she's a beautiful girl who didn't have a high opinion of herself & thought she had to depend on others. This time, she becomes one that others can count on, showing that strength CAN come in a lovely package.<br /><br />Percy & Jason seem to constantly be trying to outdo one another, which makes sense as they are \\"sons\\" of the 2 most competitive \\"Gods\\" of olympus, Zeus & Posiedon. Each is trying to outdo the other in an attempt to prevail & prove which is stronger, thankfully it doesn't take long for both boys to realize they are far more formidable as a team than as foes.<br /><br />All in all this book was so amazing that I had to force myself to go at a slow pace. The House of Hades isn't due out until Fall 2013 & that's pretty far away for me to have to wait. In the end our demigods follow their quest, with thrills & hilarity following them every step. Annabeth FINALLY shows us she has a chink in her armor by accepting her shortcomings & acknowledging her fears as she prepares for & goes alone on her side quest, following the Mark of Athena to avenge her mother, Athena. The \\"vengeance\\" is due to a \\"slight\\" from the Romans in ancient times towards Athena while the ancient Romans were demoralizing the Greeks as they pillaged their city. It's been a little while since I read the Percy Jackson & the Olympians series & the 2 books proceeding The Mark of Athena but if my memory is correct, this is the first book where there is a separate side quest that takes one of the larger quests members off alone in harms way. It adds an exciting, nail biting twist that really moves things along fast. Fans of the previous 2 books in this series will love it.<br /><br />All in all this is more of the greatness that makes up Riordan as an author. This is book 3 in the Lost Olympian series & NOT a standalone book. I'd recommend reading the 2 previous books for it to make sense, while your at it read the 1st Percy Jackson series, I promise you will love it! Fans of J.K. Rowling, Michael Scott, Nancy Holder & Maggie Stiefvater will enjoy this, as will fans of ALL AGES that read about mythology.<br /><br />I'm terrified that The House of Hades will end the series. I hope not. Mr. Riordan, if you happen to see this, please (!!!!!) make this a 5 book series! I love this series as much as the first!

1451695195|3.0|I pre-purchased this book based on the publishers hype, being a physic's and math guy I was excited to read proof from a learned specialist. I was passionately hoping for some crumb of evidence to support what I have long believed, that there is a heaven. The hope of course being to help heal the world, but alas if you want proof of heaven you will have to look elsewhere.<br /><br />Oddly I found that the good doctor's experience of what Heaven is like aligned very closely with what I hope (and have logically deduced to the best of my ability) heaven will be like, and that part was quite exciting but in the end there was no proof. He does go into great detail about all the things that could have caused these experiences and walks down a checklist of why each of them do not apply but there is one glaring item he does not address \\"Is it possible you were dreaming (or something closely related to dreaming) the experience either just before/after slipping into/out of the coma?\\" The timeline of these experiences and how it related to real time are absent and no attempt is made to detail this aspect of his experience yet the books description leads one to believe it will do just that if only you read it's content. (This very may well be the publishers doing.)<br /><br />The Good Doctor even mentions the lack of a sense of time during his experiences (and we all know how skewed time can be in dreams) so I was surprised he didn't deal with this aspect. I am certain the Good Doctor believes these experiences were real but he presents no \\"hard scientific proof\\" and because of that I am compelled to agree with other reviewers and say that I feel more than a little bit taken advantage of by the pre-release hype the publishers spun concerning this book, I suggest changing the title.<br /><br />A good read but he falls short of the mark.

0374275637|4.0|*A full summary of this book is available here: [[ASIN:B00IAXGTAO An Executive Summary of Daniel Kahneman's 'Thinking, Fast and Slow']]<br /><br />The adage `you are what you eat' is no doubt literally true, but when it comes to getting at the heart of what we are it is certainly more accurate to say `you are what you think'; for our identity emerges out of the life of the mind, and our decisions and actions (including what we eat) is determined by our thoughts. An exploration of how we think therefore cuts to the core of what we are, and offers a clear path to gaining a better understanding of ourselves and why we behave as we do. In addition, while many of us are fairly happy with how our mind works, few of us would say that we could not afford to improve here at least in some respects; and therefore, an exploration of how we think also promises to point the way towards fruitful self-improvement (which stands to help us both in our personal and professional lives). While thinking about thinking was traditionally a speculative practice (embarked upon by philosophers and economists) it has recently received a more empirical treatment through the disciplines of psychology and neuroscience. It is from the latter angle that the Nobel Prize winning psychologist Daniel Kahneman approaches the subject in his new book 'Thinking, Fast and Slow'.<br /><br />As the title would suggest, Kahneman breaks down thinking into 2 modes or systems. Slow thinking is the system that we normally think of as thought in the strictest sense. It is deliberate and conscious, and we naturally feel as though we are in control of it (Kahneman refers to it as system 2). System 2 is in play when we actively consider what we want to have for dinner tonight, or when we choose what stocks to buy, or when we perform a mathematical calculation. System 1, by contrast, is automatic and unconscious, and hums along continuously in the background. It constantly surveys the environment, and processes the incoming stimuli with razor speed.<br /><br />System 1 is informed by natural drives and instincts but is also capable of learning, which it does by way of association (that is, connecting up novel stimuli with known stimuli according to shared characteristics, contiguity in time and place, or causality). The system is designed to give us an impression of our environment as quickly as possible, thus allowing us to respond to it immediately, which is especially important in times of danger. In order to do so, system 1 relies on general rules and guidelines (called heuristics). These heuristics are primarily geared to help us in the moment and are tilted towards protecting us from danger, and in this respect they are mostly very useful. Still, mistakes can be made, and the system was specifically designed to work in the environment in which we evolved, which is quite different from our current one, so this adds to its errors.<br /><br />Over and above this, the impressions that system 1 forms are also fed up to system 2. Indeed, whenever system 1 senses something out of the ordinary or dangerous, system 2 is automatically mobilized to help out with the situation. And even when system 2 is not mobilized specifically out of danger, it is constantly being fed suggestions by system 1. Now, while the impressions of system 1 are fairly effective in protecting us from moment to moment, they are much less effective in long-term planning; and therefore, they are much more problematic here. Of course, system 2 is capable of overriding the impressions of system 1, and of avoiding the errors. However, as Kahneman points out, system 2 is often completely unaware that it is being influenced (and misled) by system 1; and therefore, is not naturally well-equipped to catch the errors. Much of the book is spent exploring the activities and biases of system 1, in order to make us more aware of how this system works and how it influences (and often misleads) system 2.<br /><br />This is only half the battle, though, for while system 2 may be naturally poorly equipped to catch the errors of system 1, it is also often poorly equipped to correct these errors. Indeed, Kahneman argues that system 2 is simply not a paragon of rationality (as is often assumed in economics), and could stand to use a good deal of help in this regard. The most glaring deficiency of system 2, according to Kahneman, is that it is naturally very poor with probabilities and statistics. Fortunately, system 2 can be trained to improve here, and this is another major concern of the book.<br /><br />Kahneman does a very good job of breaking down the workings of the mind, and presenting his findings in a very readable way. My only objection to the book is that the arguments are sometimes drawn out much more than needed, and there is a fair bit of repetition. A full summary of the book is available here: [[ASIN:B00IAXGTAO An Executive Summary of Daniel Kahneman's 'Thinking, Fast and Slow']]y half the battle, though, for while system 2 may be naturally poorly equipped to catch the errors of system 1, it is also often poorly equipped to correct these errors.

B007THA4FI|3.0|If this had been Ms. Rowling's first book, it would have been received reasonably well. It's a complex story because of the multitude of characters. In my Kindle version I referred often to the character list to remember what the relationship was among many of them. I was more than half way through before I was comfortable with the associations. Frankly, I think some of the characters could have been combined to make it less complex but as a counter argument, life is not simple and this story is a life story above all.<br /><br />I wonder how American readers will feel about this book compared to the British. The theme could be translated into one of American local politics and interactions among small town Americans with their prejudices and jingoism but the casual reader may not appreciate the parallels between the casual vacancy in a local English town's governance and local political issues here.<br /><br />My biggest disappointment was the plot is just interesting enough to keep reading but not as exciting as Ms. Rowling is capable of making it. No, I did NOT expect Harry Potter, but the Potter series was difficult to put down. This was too close to reality, too mundane a topic to make a really interesting story. I would have preferred more suspense, more plot twists, and maybe a different outcome.<br /><br />It is an important issue and we in the US are far behind the UK in social support systems. There is little help for and even less interest in the plight of substance abusers, the impoverished, the mentally ill here. There are many Wheedon families here and not enough structure or support to help them. Maybe my lukewarm reception of the story is the sense of despair I felt that the better off in society may not be willing to tackle these problems. With a presidential campaign marred by those who would let the less fortunate fend for themselves whle taking a self-righteous attitude against all logic I think perhaps this story just made me feel things will never change.<br /><br />Or maybe I really was hoping for something like Harry Potter.
1423140605|5.0|[Originally posted at [...]]    Oh my goodness, was this book adorable. I've been OBSESSED with Percy Jackson since I was 11 (so 5 years now, guys) and this just hasjdaksjdah I loved it. A lot. I made the mistake of lending it to my sister when I first got it, since I was reading Origin at the time, and the kid took freaking 3 weeks to finish it! How on Earth are we related?! It amazes me. Anyways, I loved getting to see more Percy and Annabeth, along with the new Heroes of Olympus characters. LOVE IT. (seriously fangirling)    So, the people mentioned in The Lost Hero are all at Camp Half-Blood, but Leo built this rockin' fly-y boat thing, and they all went to Camp Jupiter to get Percy. That didn't go over great with the Romans (they're kind of what we would call warmongers), and Percy, Annabeth, Leo, Jason, Piper, Hazel and Frank (plus Coach Hedge) had to flee on the Argo II. They go to Rome to try and solve the whole Prophecy of Seven (I did list seven people, since Hedge is in fact just a satyr with a baseball bat, and not technically a person). And Annabeth judo-flips Percy at one point in time and the cuteness killed me. I love these books, like so much. And that's not even my inner 12-year-old Megan talking. This 16-year-old Megan saying that it has adventure and Greek myths and the greatest couple EVER (seriously, even in The Lightning Thief I knew Percy & Annabeth were gonna get together. they fought too much not to). I just, I can't even.    So, yeah. Characters. I mean, if you're reading this review, you should have read all seven previous books (if you haven't I will hunt you down. and violently force you to read The Lightning Thief. It's much better than the movie, I promise. Like a thousand times better) and should know these awesome characters pretty dang well. However, Jason and Percy kind of react like oil and water with each other, and Frank and Leo end up having some issues, too. And Piper and Annabeth eat each other's food. And Percy is really flipping sassy (it's awesomely funny). And Dionysus ends up drinking Diet Pepsi at one point. Crazy, right? Oh, and Coach Hedge wants to kill things. With his baseball bat...    So, as you have probably figured out from my immense fangirling, this book was AMAZING. It deserves 5 mustaches, for sheer awesomeness.
B0095R64AO|1.0|I had to force myself to finish this movie. I love Emily Blunt and even she couldn't save it for me. It was too long, too repetitive and too boring. While it tried to be funny it fell short of the mark on most of the jokes.
B001AQR3JY|5.0|This was the first movie I ever remember seeing in the movie theaters. I am now a 24-year-old man and I still think it is one of the greatest movies of all time. Perfect movie for children and adults.
B008QTUA5W|3.0|Homeland is not nearly as good as Dexter, AMC's The Walking Dead or Justified. Cant quite figure out how it won so many awards but I guess Hollywood loves to love their own. I have this on DVD and the only reason I'm watching it is because the cable is out due to Hurricane Sandy. I had a feeling I would be disappointed...I am.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was the best. The best book I had ever read in my life. I went on a wonderful adventure. Peeta seems really cute.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I have had this app for a year now and now it won't open. I have spent a lot of money on books that i can't access now :( Please fix this app, I'm bored and would like to read a book.
B005SJIP1E|5.0|First of all, this is an outstanding bargain. I passed on the \\"Carnegie Hall\\" issue,<br />and am now glad I did. Here you have the same 2008 remastering, markedly better sounding than any previous issue of these performances, and all you lose is interviews and a less than first choice \\"Das Lied\\". If you want just one set of the Mahler symphonies, this is it. The second Bernstein set on DG does have better sound, especially on symphonies 1,6,and 9, but the 4th(boy soprano soloist) and 8th<br />(radio broadcast quality sound)fail to match the older recordings. There's also the issue of price. If you add, say, the Bernstein 9th with Berlin, and the 6th from the Bernstein DG set, you have an amazing sample of Mahler, with dramatic and impressive performances. I can't say that you could never do better picking individual recordings by Bernstein,Abbado, Levine,Tennstedt and Karajan, but I CAN say that you will have spent way less, and done much better than purchasing ANY of the modern \\"domesticated\\" Mahler sets such as Zinman, Bertini, Chailly and many others.
B00992CF6W|5.0|when is the update coming out because me and my freinds are getting bord.  and when people start getting bord of the game they tell people that the game sucked. but if you tell me when the update is coming out ill tell my freinds that the game will get better soon
0061733199|5.0|The other survival books out there strive to be this book. You know that this is the Bible because all the other reviews give an alternative survival book to seek out instead. Not a single reviewer here. OK maybe Peterson's Medicinal Plant book, but beyond that your search for the all encompassing survival book is the SAS Survival Handbook.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|Reading this book was a wonderful experience for me, i discover this book (was recommend it by a friend), in the moment I was really need it. My grandmother is cancer suffering; for many years and now is close to end. This book help me to see the live and the deed in a complete different way, it helps me to know me better, to rediscover my and to find the power to be beside my grandmother and to help her to go on in the disease.
B00783NWB6|5.0|Kate Beckinsale delivers another great performance with nonstop action. This latest episode will not disappoint. Can't wait for the next one.
B00992CF6W|4.0|it is just like the real game but I don't like how monsters seemingly get in or under my house and this bugs me
B00A1ZW1JC|5.0|I could hardly believe the episode was over the time went so fast. Your attention NEVER wanders. More great zombie battles and again kudos to whomever is doing their makeup and costume.  The workmanship and attention to detail is incredible. This is mirrored by the rest of the show which also seamlessly creates the prison and the Guv's seemingly idyllic town. Lots of action, lots of death...keep em coming!<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />There are more deaths of key characters and this fits with the arc of the comics.  The only two characters who the comics' creator seems bent on preserving are Rick and Carl.  Everyone else is fair game.  So we lost more characters this time with the big one being Rick's wife. In the comics, Rick's wife is safely delivered of the baby but they are both killed during a huge fight at the prison.  In the tv version the baby lives while the wife dies during delivery. So the tv version has decided to add the baby as a character, just like it added Darryl as a character.<br /><br />Everything happening with the Guv is just like it unfolds in the comics and his pathology is given to us in bits and pieces. Darryl's brother being his sidekick is solely in the tv version because he doesn't exist in the comics.  So far, I think these additions work pretty well.<br /><br />Things will kick up with Michonne as she is onto the Guv while Andrea is increasingly beguiled by him. Michonne vs the Guv should be key as it is key in the comics. If you have loved this so far, that should really be the centerpiece of the whole season, those two locked in combat.

B008OOYALE|2.0|To me this game takes forever. It takes a long time to make money, level up, hatch new dragons. I wanted to love it but just can't seem to.
B009A9EPLM|5.0|John William's score and soundtrack for LINCOLN is just brilliant. It is very rich and pure Americana. It stands right beside his scores for AMISTAD and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. This is a very lush and melodic score and very much heartfelt to the spirit of Mister Lincoln and his times. I highly recommend this one.
B0063GORYU|4.0|This is a fun and challenging game.  The graphics are nicenand it is easy to learn.  You can change.levels as you improve.
B005USZML4|4.0|Interesing story Nice easy read with strange out come. Seems like it was written in a home town setting, which most readers will see as they go on into the book. Quick read for a Grisham book.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book had a lot of suspense. I didn't want to put it down. And I didn't!!!!  Got to finish this series. It is a must read
B008QTVNUI|5.0|The production value of this show is some of the best on television. The acting is Acadamy awards. But the writing is the most creative element of the show. And no commericals!!!
B004YM6JI2|5.0|This is a Christmas gift for my husband who will now have the entire series so far. This makes a Great Gift  for the Supernatural lover in your family.
B009NPM5Y2|3.0|movie wasn't  as  good as the hype was. As a last resort movie i would watch it. dont waste your money.
B0098VYKSA|2.0|The trailers seemed good.  I read positive reviews.  I almost went to see it in the theater but in the end I waited to rent it.  I'm glad I did because it was a big let down.  The plot was weak at best and some of the special effects were bad.  I would pass on this one.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|When pigs fly is probably a better title. Lot of fun and easy to play. Watching the pig crash is good for a laugh. Some levels are very challenging.  Works well on my kindle fire.
B007THA4FI|2.0|I couldn't finish it.  It was just too boring.  It just dragged on and on and on forever.  Certainly not Harry Potter!
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I couldn't wait to start reading Book Four. One, two, and three, left me wanting more.Wow, the story just keeps getting better and better. The twist, the turns, the build up. My favorite charactors adventures are ALL turnig toward a climax that is at the same time climatic and anti-climatic. Who lives, who dies, who schemes the best. This is very exciting stuff.<br /><br />Book four is the turnig point and the glue that holds the story together. I enjoyed itso much that it's like a Serial that leaves you salivating for the next scene.<br /><br />Five Stars and Counting.<br /><br />Tom
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|This is hard to put down.  This game lets you be creative and you anyone can do it. Graphics are amazeing.  Fun for all ages
B00846REIS|4.0|Very good book, totally luv it! Was so good that I didnt want to put it down, jus kept on reading it until I finished within a day.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Great sequel to Bared to You. I CAN'T wait for 3rd book to come out. This couple is made for each other.
B004VB3UYW|5.0|It is an ideal piece of work for someone who is not very much into R, but still needs it for some research project: the problems are organized almost in a step-by-step manner, so it is okay for everyone who is not helpless at using a new programming language (but, again, people knowing about R aren't supposed to be helpless... ☺)
B006LSZECO|4.0|Loved the development of the characters but the ending was whack!! Gillian is a very insightful author and this book was truly unputtdownable!
B008KY5W9W|5.0|Awesome show. cant wait for the next season to come out. If you havent seen it yet i would highly recomend watching a few!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This is a fun and challenging match three game.  Runs smoothly on Kindle Fire. Wish there were more levels to conquer.
B0092C2X7U|4.0|Kind of stupid kind of funny overall not a horrible app. The fact that you only get 3 tries is kind of annoying because at certain areas you will need to learn all whole new series of tapping in order to land a jump. It definitely made me waste some time.  I'm glad I got it as the free app of the day otherwise I never would have gotten this app. Not worth buying but fun.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I blew through this book! I just could not put it down and was surprised throughout! It definitely kept my attention.  After I finished this book, I quickly bought her other two books and read those too!
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love being able to create and design beautiful islands and interact with neighbors who can help inspire creativity. I have many of the games developed by the same company and I love them all.
B0084IG7KC|4.0|As a fan of the books, I have to say that this is one of the better movies I've seen in a while.  The way the actors portray their desperation, anger, fear, and love is vivid and well done.  However, this is assuming you read the book, because otherwise you will miss out on some of the best parts of the film that are not explained entirely.  That having been said, these are only a few scenes out of the entire movie, and are not critical to understand the plot of the entire movie.  Overall, this is a fantastic film, and I recommend it to everyone, whether or not you read the book.
B001U3Y5XE|4.0|Purchased for our nephew & he loved it. Very durable & fun toy that he plays with all of the time.
B008BM9L72|5.0|Despite several typos and other silly grammar errors, its an incredible book that takes you one a journey into unusual but incredible relationships.
B000W91RUG|5.0|DVD came in great quality. Shipped on time and this is one of our favorite series! So funny and we have so many personal jokes about it.
B0076DCT2G|1.0|This was a terribly painful read.  I could not even make it through a quarter of the book.  The constant one liner's by John Corey get old and completely dominate the book and completely take away from whatever story line there was.  This will be my last DeMille purchase along with the other mass mass produced authors.  Don't waste you time trying to read this.
B007R6UWN0|5.0|This was a fun compliment to the books. Love to see the characters come to life. I hope they continue the series.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I'm sure most readers of reviews are interested in the ease with which a media app works.  It works fine.  Don't have any complaints about the design, the changes, the applications.  And, I may be the guy who was old enough to put the wrinkle on the face of Facebook when I joined years ago when it was typically the terrain of the college age subscribers.  But, my complaint is that it has lost a lot of its benefit for me in the maintenance of friendships that don't have the luxury of geographical connections.  I live on two continents ... not at the same time obviously ... that are 10,000 miles apart.  I'm not really interested in photos of what people prepared and ate for dinner last night.  But, I love the photos of my grandkids.  With time, Facebook has intensified my desire to really be WITH people.  There is a lot to be said for a relationship not simply digital.  Yeah ... just tired of all the interesting, but not really significant, \\"stuff\\" posted on Facebook.  I'm there, but not much.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Reading the book is much more fun than the tv show. There are so many details-reading the book is just like being there
B008MG1E4A|3.0|This book deserves to be a best seller. The work of the brave men in the special forces is fascinating, interesting and thrilling.  I had misgivings about seeing a publication that might compromise the safety of those left to do these missions, but Mark was cautious to not give too much away.<br /><br />Mark Owen describes his motivation for becoming a seal, the obstacles he endured in achieving his goal and his rise through the ranks. The many and varied deployments around the world are amazing.<br /><br />Where the book falls short is in emotion. But that is probably the nature of being a SEAL.  The job is logical to a fault and emotion would probably be an encumbrance.  Just the same it was hard to connect at a gut level with some of the work being done.  The never ending use of military acronyms makes for a tough read, but that is the language of the trade.<br /><br />Overall, the book sheds new light on the lives of some of the toughest men on the planet and the courageous work they do to keep us free.
B005ES1EN0|5.0|Sizing on Crocs is not clear but turned out to get correct size and my son absolutely loves them. Would buy again.
B000OBYLVO|5.0|Great feel good story with well known actors, beautiful scenery and stage sets.  Would recommend without hesitation for for easy entertainment.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|About as interesting and complex a main character as you can have, within a rich world with rich supporting characters.  Ryan brings to life the cast with simple yet purposeful writing totally engrossing you from beginning to end.
B00A11AN6O|1.0|Umm ... there is a X next to my Kindle Fire HD model on the right side .. meaning you cannot use this on a Kindle that actually has a camera ..... major fail.
0385344228|4.0|What if your teenage son was arrested for murdering another teenager?  Would you destroy potential evidence?  What if it appeared he was guilty?  Would you continue to believe he was innocent strictly because he was your son?  Or would you let doubt creep into your mind?  What if your wife thought he did it?  Now imagine that you were the assistant district attorney originally assigned to the case. This is the plot of the book in a nutshell.  The book has interesting twists and subplots, but I found the characters difficult to get involved with.  Jacob, the teenage son, was especially hard to like.  Fortunately the teenage victim was even more unlikeable than Jacob.  It seemed unlikely to me that the outcome of the trial would not have been investigated, but of course, the reader knew more than the investigators did.  The book had a great surprise ending.
B000RH0C8G|5.0|As a player and fan of baseball with an open mind for looking at things new, I found Moneyball both an interesting look at business and back office operations of baseball as well as an interesting historical and statistical assessment of the game and its players.  I saw and subsequently bought the movie and am happy I have taken in the story from both media
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I needed a new USB cable for my Kindle because the coating on the original one peeled off.  Amazon was wonderful to deal with because they were prompt in getting it to me, they overnighted it, and didn't charge me for either the cord or the shipping.  I will always deal with Amazon and purchase many, many book downloads for my Kindle every year.  I hardly ever buy books any more and used to buy at least four hardbacks each month.  Now I just buy them for my Kindle.  It is the best electronic invention for me!<br /><br />Shelli O.
B0085RQLXK|2.0|I am going to preface this by the statements I am not a fanboy (I have been An Aerosmith Fan since '73) and I know most of the time negative reviews are associated with the a click on the \\"no\\" button.  So regardless, here it goes:<br />If I could set the wayback machine to 1976, crank \\"Toys In The Attic\\" on vinyl again and ask myself the question \\"I wonder what Aerosmith will sound like in 2012?\\". \\"Music From Another Dimension\\" would be a  \\"good\\"  answer.<br />Granted,  the album still sounds like Aerosmith, but it just sounds old, contrived, weak, uninspired, digital, sterile, boring, cliched and commercial. Oh...I know what some are thinking and don't even go there!  Guitarists have been rehashing the same Chuck Berry riffs for over 50 years and some still  kick fraggin ass. Not here.  The deal breakers are the power ballads.  Is it just me or do the phrases \\"return to the old sound\\" and \\"duet with Carrie Underwood\\" seem like an obvious contradiction?  What we actually have is a  slight return to the \\"old sound\\".  Just enough 70's Aerosmith to possibly  reel in longtime fans; and then an over abundance of power ballads for the longtime \\"Jaded\\" fans.  Power ballads geared more toward iTunes<br />download rather than pleasing longtime fans who pray for a shimmer of \\"Back In The Saddle\\", again.  I won't go into a track by track analysis, you can get  from  other reviews.  I look at the album as a whole and it just disappoints.  Finally, there is an overall vibe these guys just don't care anymore:  don't care about the fans, the music, each other, and what Aerosmith once meant in the world of rock n' roll.  Well, they may care about their PayPal or 401K accounts.<br />Like a wise man once said, \\"If something doesn't make sense, it is  about money, someone involved  is literally crazy, or both\\".  I leave anyone who saw Aerosmith back at Comiskey Park in '76 to figure out which applies here.
B006LSZECO|3.0|It was a real page turner, however, the ending left something to be desired. For such a thrilling novel, the ending fell flat.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|I first heard of Sanderson when he was selected to finish the Wheel of Time series.  I picked this one up on a whim and was amazed at fast 1,000 pages went by!  Sanderson is truly a first rate author and has created a unique world here with the Stormlight Archive.
B009JNXK88|5.0|runs great. tons of levels. awesome music. nostalgia was very high for all my beloved 8 bit classics. galaxy s3
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is lots of fun I like it. I am 8 and I like all the different kinds of games.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|very well written whodunit from the view of the person doing the medical exam of the remains,left at several crime scenes. ok I liked it, even with the medical terms a bit over my understanding
B0053O8AQE|5.0|Great series.  I will be buying the 2nd series for sure.  So funny.  laughs non-stop.  Easy to sit and watch the entire series all at once.
1449410243|5.0|This hilarious, handsomely illustrated,  hoot of a  handbook for friends of felines makes a great gift.  In addition to  a 49-page  section  dedicated to a week in the life of  two cats named Bob,  this book also delves into solving such  meaty issues as:  Having a baby vs. having a cat. Walking the dog vs. walking a cat.  Cat vs. the Internet.  3 ways of dealing with cat litter. How you see your cat and how your cat sees you. Six ways to tell if your cat thinks it's a mountain lion. How to tell if your cat is a raging homosexual.  How kittens are plotting to take over the world.  And, of course, the piece de resistance: its big glossy  pullout title poster, \\"How to tell if your cat is plotting to kill you.\\" Believe me, as the recipient of more cat nightshirts and cat t-shirts and cat towels and cat tchotchkes than any fan of a feline could ever want or need...this one's a winner.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love Mincraft so much. This game works really awesome on me Kindle Fire. I just love his great it is. I recommend this app for people that like fun games :-]
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love that the app is very User friendly :) I can do everything on it that I can on the full site.

B0092C2X7U|5.0|one of my favorite games I love it kind of repeative but still really fun I recommend it to everyone
0061245097|4.0|Cat leaves Bones to save his life and to head up a new team for the DHLS- paranormal investigations unit. Justina, is her usual surly self. And poor Cat - she is miserable knowing she left Bones to save him and in doing so made herself (and everyone stuck around her) miserable because of it.<br /><br />An impromptu vampire wedding and Max in a box - add a dash of wit, a lot of steam and stir!<br /><br />Cat and Bones continue to give us what we loved in the first book  making this a good follow-up to the in the series!  I'm really loving this series - shame I hadn't found it earlier!
B003UBTX6S|4.0|This is an amazing book, and a great sequel to beautiful creatures. I picked up this book and read it in two days,I couldn't put it down. Lena‘s change over time was interesting and kept me reading.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This was suggested by a friend.  I love this ap!  It helps keep me on track.  I have read through the Bible once already, but I did it from cover to cover.  They have a lot of plans to choose from.  It is so much more interesting to do it this way.
B009KHDT0C|4.0|I was surprised how much I enjoyed this movie.  I didn't have high hopes for it but it was a nice story with great actors.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this app really helps when you cant find a calculator. It is simple and easy to read. It only has basic calculator settings though.
B008QE9XD2|5.0|good as all was Jonny Depp keep up the wonderful work I have injoyed every thing he has been in.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is the  site where others put their favorite things from recipes to home decorating.  It is fun to see how to make gifts for wedding and baby showers.
B008N1LL42|4.0|How can you go wrong with aliens & the military. Love the sci-fi genre and love the military. What better way to the the 2 in action.
0375413405|5.0|This cook book was a gift for my wife along with the movie. She loves it and so do I..
B005LAIHSQ|4.0|Loved the newly revised story. Not so traditional. Great acting from the queen herself and all round good acting. Visually nice with entertaining special effects. Fun.
030759565X|5.0|Couldn't wait for this to come out in Europe, so have the US version. We had a &#34;smitten kitchen Sunday&#34; - made 4 recipes from the book: cherry walnut granola, bacon maple breakfast biscuits, wild mushroom tart, tomato-glazed meatballs. All were fantastic, and can't wait to try out more recipes. Loved the fact that it starts with an extensive breakfast section with some really interesting options.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|Some people complained that the rubber stripes make a very tight fit for your kindle. I agree with them, this cover is not made that you keep taking the Kindle in and out from it.<br />However, the material the rubber stripes made of and the quality of the whole product is just phenomenal!<br />I highly recommend this cover and it is worth the wait if it was out of stock.
B006LSZECO|4.0|The story pulls you into the mind of the misguided husband, is he true and innocent? Or what character flaws will be revealed as the story progresses? I was taken for the full ride and enjoyed every moment of this book.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I adore this book. I felt as if I was reliving some of my past. The book never comes out and says it directly but Travis and Abby are soulmates. It is written in a way that people of any age could read and fall in love with it. I hated Abby because she reminded me of myself so much, and I love Travis for loving Abby (I know that makes no sense, but its coming from personal experience). Mrs. McGuire did a fabulous job on rollercoastering the intensity of their relationship. A love like that doesnt come without its highs and lows. I was on the edge of my seat most of the time reading this book. Its rare I can find something that sucks me and causes an addiction like I had reading this.
0446580848|2.0|I have read and reread all of John Corey's books and was looking forward to this one. Half the book is so boring I had to force myself to read. Only about one-quarter of this book is fast moving and great. Corey is in the background for most of the time and yes I am sure the CIA man will be back in the next book. Of<br />course I will buy and read the next one, hoping that it will be as good as both of the Lion books.
B00006GO9Q|5.0|Bandleader and trumpeter Miles Davis certainly takes charge here, but he shares his navigational possibilities with critical support. And it's each musician who fits the specific needs of the music. Leading off with organ on \\"Shh/Peaceful\\" and building the song up with mellow electric guitar, bass, delicate cymbal crashes and electric piano tinklings, Miles' own trumpet playing enters the proceedings after a couple minutes in and he contributes aplenty to the already earthy coloring. The song's tempo alternates between slow and lively. Then when Wayne Shorter serves up a thrilling sax break about midway through, there's that much more to wend through that you don't realize that all these sounds caress a single-chord motif. Towards the end of this eighteen-minute cut, it returns to its beginning and finishes with a quick fade-out in uptempo fashion because there's nowhere else for it to go. It's triumphant jazz-rock improvisation with positively no barriers. And we haven't even reached dinner time yet!<br /><br />The composition between Miles and co-conspirator/organist, Joe Zawinul, \\"In A Silent Way/It's About That Time\\", is generous with harmonic and melodic dexterity in all its movements. Joe's portion, awashed in inspired serenity, bracket this masterpiece. Mastermind Miles' lengthier middle part, \\"It's About That Time\\", switches keys and gets the groove on with his bubbly trumpet pipings before slowing down the tempo with a hypnotic two-note motif on electric piano. The secret essence on this part are Dave Holland's electric funk-filled bass, John McLaughlin's soothing guitar ripples and Wayne Shorter's buoyant sax work. It's wrapped up coherently by referring you to its point of origin.<br /><br />This seminal jazz-rock album doesn't change the meaning of jazz or rock, but Miles now makes them more broadly defined and this is a celebration of projecting that attitude.
B008XX6J4C|4.0|Excellent compilation of the recent hits, reasonable cost, promptly and safely delivered, can't think of anything negative to mention. Good to have a copy of Pepone for the car.
1416914285|3.0|After reading The Hunger Games I did a little looking around to find a new series that I might enjoy. The Mortal Instruments series was one that was highly recommended.<br /><br />It's not that its a terrible book, but I found it to be a little too \\"young\\" for my tastes. I will probably read the rest of the books in the series just to see how it plays out, but I don't think this one will make it on to my top ten list.
B00884GR0W|4.0|for once there was a decent copy of mineraft!!! please be quite about your &quot;I thought of the exact same game a year after the original&quot;. anyway I gave it 4 stars cause it was a decent game but a copy and thats just low
B0083Z614S|3.0|I have read this book many times and do enjoy it still but I really only wanted to see if it was illustrated, which it is not, unfortunately. I think children like illustrations.
B007NESBK2|4.0|In short....<br /><br />Pros - Great sound. DTS HD audio. 30 minutes of behind the scenes footage in the bonus section<br /><br />Cons - Poor video quality for blu-ray standards. At times out of focus. Amateurish video capturing done by the video crew.<br /><br />Verdict - still worth the purchase if you are a Sade fan or witnessed this tour and want to relive the show.
B001KZG99A|5.0|Love this movie, it's a must-see.  Any superhero movie is good!  Saw this at the theater and had to have it!
B0091REZMW|3.0|like the game ok but don't like that you have to buy coins energy and diamonds when you run out and still want to play.
B00005PJ6M|5.0|Love these movies, so this is a must for me.  I have the first one also.  Good movie, lots of laughs.  Def. recommend this to anyone!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|My kids and I enjoyed playing this game very much! It is simple and fun for the whole family. I gave it four stars.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I downloaded Flow Free onto my new Kindle Fire HD.  Thought I was a wiz at it in the beginning, boy does it get harder and more challenging.  Love this game !
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I love this series. These books remind me of the 50 Shades of Grey series, but they definitely stand on their own.  I could not put down the book until I was done.  You just fall in love with the characters and want to see how their story unfolds. I cannot wait for the next book to be published: Entwined with You.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I really enjoyed these books, a little too much sex perhaps, but I would read another one. As I said in title- great for travelling
B00992CF6W|5.0|ok peeps this is sweet. almost like real mc. it needs mincarts the end and the nether. good controls.this is totally EPIC!!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I am completely addicted to this series.  It is captivating, egaging and very well made.  I can't wait for season 3.
B00003CXBK|5.0|This is one of the greatest classic animes ever, its about a boy who gets a curse goes on a jounery to get it removed meets some unslightly characters and some great ones. he meets the mononoke a girl of the forest, a woman who runs iron town, a strange man who knows lots about the gods. its a great anime and must have for many fans i believe.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|This was probably the best of the three...  My reviews of the other two books weren't very flattering.  I still fail to see where the books are a good example of real love and passion but more of lust and possession. To me, since I live in the real world, none of the books were good fantasy material.  Many women in real life are trapped in similar situations with domineering men with issues.  Many of those women die because they fall prey to the belief that they can help make that damaged person know love.  I really fail to see the positive message here.  It was ok to read for just plain fiction, but the story line kind of fell apart at times.
B006BXTOFC|5.0|One of the best albums from The Black Keys. Songs include:<br />  1. Lonely Boy<br />  2. Dead And Gone<br />  3. Gold On The Ceiling<br />  4. Little Black Submarines<br />  5. Money Maker<br />  6. Run Right Back<br />  7. Sister<br />  8. Hell Of A Season<br />  9. Stop Stop<br />10. Nova Baby<br />11. Mind Eraser
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Would highly recommend this book. It is great eeacher book. Expands the character from previous  books in the series. Slight tie in to previous books not as much as previous.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|This is John Cory at his best. Sarcasim an all, As usual he keep you guessing as to what's next and who is really the bad guys. Who can you trust and what is the motive. Also some great insight into why. Read it and you will see what I mean. One of his best yet.
B008IYN9P8|5.0|You either love this show or hate it? I love it! If you haven't seen it give it a try
B008OOYALE|5.0|love it! very addictive. kids love it adults love it. love the weekly up dates and new dragons. keep them coming.
B0000A2I1B|5.0|This is my favorite Santana album of all time. Nothing here for mainstream listening, but it covers so much musical ground. Santana changes his band with every album, but this one had many musical directions.  If you had to pick one song from his catalog, it could very well be &#34;Every Step of the way&#34;.
B000RIWAVW|5.0|There's never anything like the original story. John Carpenter thought it up. It has qualities Rob Zombie just can't capture. He was more into shock by gross out where the original Halloween had little things like when the chic's in the laundry and you see Michael for a second out the window and when the same frame is in the shot again, he's gone. Plus Jamie Lee Curtis is just like every teenage girl I knew in the early 80's, like my sister and what a set of lungs on her. There's just a creepy-ness about the first film Rob Zombie couldn't quite capture.
B0098JJYZQ|5.0|I love this book a realy grown up. Fate and Destney there story blew away  there love reminds me of my life. Just a brilliant read Xx
B0058YPILY|3.0|I am a huge fan of Criminal Minds and the episodes that weren't too obnoxious to watch were great. I was very upset because 3 discs out of 6 were all defective and made an extremely loud, obnoxious buzzing/humming sound when played. We tried putting the discs in multiple players and it would occur every time. The first couple of discs played normally. All of our other dvds at home play normally as well. Even more frustrating the only option given to me was to get a money refund not an actual replacement for the item so now it is going to take even longer for me to have to order a new copy.
B002RI9M2U|5.0|This book was amazing. It changed completely my perspective. I realized that something very insignificant to me, can mean a lot to others. Now I care more about other people and I remind them everyday the good things they have.
B005LAJ17M|5.0|My wife who really does not watch these types of shows is totally captivated by this series. I am too!!  Highly recommend it to folks who love plots taht twist and turn and leave you wondering and wanting more!!
B009DP9D6A|5.0|First a quick glimpse at to some of the music I listen to. Mozart, Beethoven, Bach, Rachmaninov (classical music), Mumford and Sons, Muse, Metallica, Paul Van Dyk, Sasha, BT, Sigur Ros, Nine Inch Nails, K&D (dub...not dub step), Jimmy Eat World, Beatles, Beach Boys to name a few.  Bottom line, while it's not everything, I appreciate a wide variety of music.  I play guitar, and have done some of my own \\"computer music\\" before as well.<br /><br />I am a pretty recent fan of Deadmau5.  I picked up 4x4=12 after seeing him on the Grammy's as I thought Raise Your Weapon was a very smart, awesome track.  In general I thought it was a great CD.  I haven't purchased anything in the house/trance subgenres for a while and it was refreshing to hear a good 'artist album' of that genre.  I picked up For Lack of a Better Name shortly afterwards and based on those two albums, I've decided that Mr Zimmerman is indeed a talent at audio production, at producing and composing banging house tracks, and will probably sound like that for the rest of his career.<br /><br />Out of boredom one day I did a little more research into this seemingly quirky character who comes off as a total prick in print interviews, but watching some live interviews, he was surprisingly very humble and genuine, yet opinionated, and seemed to be really into a large variety of music.  I checked out this soundcloud (especially when trent reznor tweeted a link to Deadmau5's awesome mix of survivalism) and picked up Get Scraped and Random Album title.<br /><br />and particularly with Get Scraped...that's when it hit me.  Deadmau5 made it big with his banging house tracks.....so that's what he's ran with.  You see him branching a wee bit out of the norm at times (right this second, the long intro of strobe, raise your weapon, FML), but for the most part it's always been fun dance tracks.  But is that the music Deadmau5 really makes for himself??<br /><br />Now there's this unmixed album and, while it does have some banging dance tracks, there are a few tracks that are \\"head scratchers\\" to some.  and some of those dance tracks have long 2+ minute non-danceable intros.  and the result is some confusion from fans, which is understandable.<br /><br />However, from my perspective, this is just Deadmau5 doing what he enjoys, and it shows.  Does it make for a cohesive \\"album\\".  No.  This isn't The Wall, heck it's not even 4x4=12 or For Lack of a Better Name. In fact in interviews he states himself that this is an album of a bunch of one offs that hasn't been properly released.<br /><br />But this album does show Deadmau5's incredible range, his love for music, and his technical proficiency.  I am hoping this album is a bridge to a \\"mangnum opus\\" type of album for whenever he decides to release his next.  He has such a clear progression of improvement in each album, and while this one might be a little more \\"out there\\", i like it for that very reason.  If he can experiment a bit like he did on this album, make it a little more cohesive, and make it a continuous mix...with his talent and passion an album like that could be generational.<br /><br />In a meantime, I'll have this little gem on repeat.  If you're a fan of his previous work, you'll no doubt love at least half of this album.  If you're a fan of electronic music or music in general, this is a great CD, and hopefully you won't be thrown off by quite an amazing collab with imogen heap.  :)
0812979702|5.0|There are a bunch of golf books written by golfers and golf writers which focus on the mental aspect of the game.  And golf may be the most mental of games this side of chess.<br /><br />But Timothy Gallwey has been writing books about the mental aspects of all sorts of stuff -- including tennis, skiing, etc.  So he brings a much wider vision to his analysis of golf and its mental challenges than other folks can do.<br /><br />Mr. Gallwey kind of started this whole \\"mental aspect of the game\\" business with his \\"Inner Game of Tennis\\" book back in the 1960's, and his understanding of this critical aspect of doing the game effectively between your ears is as valuable and well thought-through here as it was with his tennis book back then.
B0085RQLXK|3.0|I had really hoped that the return of Jack Douglas behind the board would kick this band in the a**, and we'd have another \\"Rocks\\" on our hands. Unfortunately, that is not the case. Sure, there are some solid rockers with their foot in the 70's, but overall, the riffs are rather tired, and have a heard-it-all-before aspect to them much of the time. Douglas has generally brought back the raw vibe that the band has been missing for a long time now, but it's pretty rote - in fact, I think I prefer the slicker, more vibrant \\"Just push play\\"! And the ballads!! Too many, and too sappy. Some of the early Aero ballads have been favorites of mine over the years: \\"You see me crying\\", \\"Home tonight\\" and \\"Seasons of wither\\", to name a few. Great when they are written by the band, not when they are penned by shlocky hit-makers like Diane Warren. Do they really need that input here at this stage in their career?? And the Carrie Underwood duet? Horrid, and an obvious play for a cross-over hit. Again, do they really need this now?? Generally, the band is strong in performance, and some songs rock like the days of yore, but overall....tepid. Really guys, take a cue from another band from your era who answer to no one but themselves, and continue to amaze: RUSH.
B0086700CM|5.0|Fun and addictive game to pass the time. But warning you can easily lose more time than originally planned.<br />Perfect for time filling since gameplay isn't that long.
B0094FQZTM|5.0|This Swedish band has been running the Euro goth-metal circuit for nearly twenty-three years now, with little, if any presence in the States. Too bad, because they really are among the best progenitors of this often-cliched genre, and on this album, are at the top of their game. In fact, out of all the great bands in this arena that I've discovered over the years, from Paradise Lost, to Katatonia, Lacuna Coil and Flowing Tears, I like Tiamat the best. And that's due to the fact that every album is a bit different, yet still sounds like them - and within each album you'll find a plethora of moods and styles. (Unlike a lot of his metal contemporaries, leader Johan Edlund is not afraid to incorporate acoustic guitars, synthesizers, piano and atmosphere into his creations). But for those looking for the \\"bookend\\" sounds of their career output (the death-metal growl of 'A Sumerian Cry' or the hard-edge metal attack of 2008's 'Amanethes'), you might be disappointed. But not me! Here, it's pretty much \\"Tiamat Mid-Period 101\\", combining a heaping amount of 'Judas Christ' and 'Skeletron' with touches of 'Prey' and some of the atmospheric Pink Floyd-isms of 'Wildhoney' (their foray into David Gilmour-esque soloing over keyboard-drenched mid-tempo arrangements is in abundance here). Edlund's vocals are also some of his best yet, his deep baritone melding into these songs better than ever (a far cry from the gruff approach he took on 'Amanathes' - in fact, I thought maybe his voice had given out on that album, yet I'm glad to report that is not the case!!) Elsewhere, it's a slightly lighter take on the dark gothic metal of their past, and one of the most satisfying of their many great albums. I just wish that more folks in the U.S. would catch on.....but that's why I review!!
1579128955|5.0|The Elements by Theodore Gray is a must-have book for anyone who has ever wondered just what exactly the world is made of. That includes curious kids as well as adults with even a passing interest in nature, science and technology. The luscious photographs in this coffee table size book will captivate even young elementary students, while the surprising, witty, non-technical text will keep even professional chemists and engineers.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|This odd story comes to life as only Wes Anderson can do. The beautiful Cinematography and superb acting is worth your time.
1439153663|5.0|I think this story is just what it proclaims to be - a story of family - it describes how the hardships inflicted on any family member is felt by all.  I like the way the story is told by two different people with two different social standings.  I also like that not everything is explained in full; I think the astute reader can figure it out without all the graphic details.  This book and all its well developed characters will stay with me for a long time.  It's a heart-wrenching story but given the time period and story line, how could it not be?
B009NPKTN6|5.0|Saw this in the movie theater and knew I'd like to see it again.<br />I waited for this movie to come out on dvd, and enjoyed it just as<br />much the second and third time.
B00992CF6W|4.0|for all the minecraft people that play minecraft I think you should get this game because you get to use your fingers it felt like I was in a first person shooter game. that's why I like this game.I would recamend this game to you.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I absolutely fell in love with this book. I never watch the movie before I read the actual book & I am guessing its no where near what this book is. I normally do not read books that are set in the future or as horrible as the idea of the games were.. but if you have not read this book take it from me.. its AMAZING. You absolutely get so involved in the story and find yourself actually cheering for Katniss, Peeta and even Rue. The survival factor in this book brings out all emotions and actually sheds light on the human race. And its always nice when a little love makes it out of even the most unthinkable situations. Can't wait to finish the series. I promise , you do not want to start reading this if you have things to do. I was so engrossed I read it in less than a day.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Some of the best books I've read!! I was sad when I was done!! I would most definitely recommend these books!!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game! its my most favorite game on my kindle fire. I hope you make more games. people who say its crape think agian

B001I45UFC|5.0|The Lion,the Witch and the Wardrobe is the best known of the Narnia novels and it is a true classic. Although I personally didn't enjoy The Lion,the Witch and the Wardrobe as much as I enjoyed the Magician's Nephew,it was still a high quality read. The Lion,the Witch,and the Wardrobe starts with the now grown up Digory Kirke,who has become Professor Kirke,taking 4 siblings into his house in a time of war. One of the siblings first discovers way into Narnia through the wardrobe Professor Kirke made out of Narnian wood at the end of the Magician's Nephew. Eventually,all 4 of the siblings find their way into Narnia and the story really begins. The plot is graver and the tone grimmer than the Magician's Nephew. In this book the 4 siblings find Narnia an unhappy land annd will also find themselves in real danger. The adventure is about how the siblings,with the help of Aslan,put things right in the land of Narnia. There are two things I particulary like about the Lion,the Witch and the Wardrobe. 1st,The Lion,the Witch and the Wardrobe makes the Magician's Nephew an even stronger story than it was to begin with because of connections between the stories. There were many times while reading The Lion,the Witch,and the Wardrobe that I found myself saying \\"Oh,yeah,because in the Magician's Nephew.................  Now we've got a strong series going. I also loved the fact that the people that got into Narnia from \\"our world\\" in The Lion,the Witch,and the Wardrobe were different humans than the ones in the Magician's Nephew. I love how Lewis expanded his base of characters with this book. One last thing is that I LOVED the \\"gifts\\" part. (Can't say more than gifts,it'd require a big spoiler.) The biggest waekness of The Lion,the Witch and the Wardrobe is that the physical appearance of Peter,Susan,Edmund,and Lucy is never described so you have to guess. (I now think of the characters from the movie when I think about what they would look like.) The Lion,the Witch and the Wardrobe is a masterfully crafted tale about the adventures of the Pevinse children in Narnia and is surely 5 star material.be is a masterfully crafted tale about the adventures of the Pevinse children in Narnia and is surely 5 star material.
B008JAGZDE|4.0|Exactly what one would expect of it given the first movies.  I thought it was funny, but my girlfriend could not help burst out laughing for most of the movie--it was worth it.  It was convenient to rent on amazon and playback was good.  Overall, I was satisfied.  FYI, if there is a redbox near you, you could save a couple bucks.
B004I4H8QI|5.0|Contained a hard to find Eric Clapton song I wanted. Good price. Came fast. A little scratched up but the song I wanted was ok.
B004KZOXJA|5.0|I loved this book. I feel this world was very well research, I loved her play on it. The characters were real, there development was great. I couldn't put it down!

B007704PRU|2.0|I loved her first book Delirium and found the second book quite disappointing. The storyline was not as throughly developed, the characters didn't feel as real. The story was quite short and jumpy. I was disappointed, everything she built the first book up to be fell apart.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|THE PANTHER WAS INTERESTING AND HELD MY ATTENTION, HOWEVER, i FOUND IT<br />DRAGING UNTIL THE LAST FEW CHAPTERS. ONE ASPECT OF THE BOOK THAT WAS<br />AMAZING IS THE GEOGRAPHIC KNOWLEDGE THAT DE'MLLE HAD OF THE STORY LINE.
B009YG2ND8|5.0|this is a real game. if the price is too high for u then dont buy it. its simple. no need to post a review about the price if u haven't got the game.<br />now ff3 is a really gud game for a tablet. the touch screen controls fit well and isnt awkward at all. the story is a typical ff one. there is a crystal, some chosen heroes, evil to destroy and the world to save. the theme is simple but the story feels deep and enjoyable.  the fighting is turn based and the job system is back. overall this is the best rpg game on a tablet to date. deff a must have. (if u got a job and can afford 15 bucks)
B002PTHKNY|5.0|I loved this album! But being the Pearl Jam fan that I am it's hard for me to find an album by them that sucks. This is one quick album - only about 40 minutes long. My favorite songs on the album are Just Breathe, The Fixer, Got Some and The End. Eddie Vedder has a great voice on this album - so much emotion and depth. There are so many good things to say about this album but not enough space. I can't wait for the followup to this one!
0446580848|5.0|What a great audio version of this book! Being a long time fan of Scott Brick's narrative skills (especially his interpretation of John Corey), I think this is his best performance ever. Of course Nelson DeMille is an amazing author, but I have to wonder if even he imagined how John Corey's humor & charm would so brilliantly come to life in his audio of The Panther. Thank you Nelson DeMille & Scott Brick for such a well told story & delivery!
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|I've watched this movie several times now, and I still love it just as much as I did in the theater!  My wife and kids love it too!
B00992CF6W|4.0|This game seems to work really well.  My grandson plays it on the laptop and ipad, so we downloaded it to my kindle also.  Now we can both play at the same time.  Really fun and we haven't had any problems with the screen freezing up or the game slowing down.  :-)
157421327X|5.0|One introductory class with a  Zentangle instructor had set me wanting more, especially more Zentangle patterns. Zentangle Basics was just the thing for me. Clear instructions for getting started, step-by-step illustrations for how to draw twenty-five patterns and creative ideas for using Zentangles make this book a great jumping off place for everyone--teachers, parents, even non-artistic neophytes like me.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I think it is best not to know too much about this book before you read it. I found it to be a very entertaining, sometimes disturbing, not for the bashful, who done it. This is not a great piece of literature although it is very well written. If you only want a G rated read this would not be for you. I had a hard time putting this book down which is the type of book I really felt like reading at the time.
