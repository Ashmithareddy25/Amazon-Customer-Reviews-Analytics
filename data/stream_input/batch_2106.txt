034580404X|2.0|This author is just trying to make a quick buck.  There is nothing in this trilogy except repeated scenes and phrases.  She doesn't even develop the characters much.
B00004XMTJ|5.0|My aunt and uncle bought the VHS version for me when I was a child.  I fell in love with it, watched it many times, and wanted to own it on DVD.  A great musical.  Great for almost any age!  (You might have to break up the viewing sessions depending on the viewer's age because it was a little long for my 9-year-old niece.)
B004J4WNL2|5.0|For most of my adult life I've always known that I didn't fit well into certain settings and that I would grow uncomfortable around other people after a certain amount of time.  This book helped me to truly understand why that is and that it's ok.  I now recognize that I'm not socially-challenged, I just prefer much deeper and thoughtful discourse than what's considered the norm.  I've been educated about my sensitivities and how too much stimulation such as at a loud, raucous party is just not my thing.<br /><br />I've always described myself as shy but I'm not - I'm an introvert.  I'm a person who prefers peace and quiet, anything that will stimulate me mentally, and conversations about big ideas and deep thoughts.  Again, thanks to this book I know realize these things about myself and can now be much more comfortable with myself and others understanding how I relate to those around me and why.  This book has my highest recommendation.
B0002WZTOI|5.0|This movie is awesome!  It is my mom's favorite movie.  I ended up buying it for her for Christmas last year.  I had to make sure she didn't buy it herself for like 6 months; but I did it!  She was totally surprised when she opened it.

I stayed up late reading for several nights because it was so engrossing.  And then, the book ends.  Just like that.  I feel as if I read the whole book and then........no closure.

B0049P244W|5.0|Christopher nolan uses foreshadowing to play with viewers expectations. Leonardo Dicapro deserves this. Inception keeps a balance of good acting and cgi. Both the acting and the cgi steal the show. If you are really into the art of filmaking, Inception is not something you want to miss out on. As I explain Inception to you, and what it expresses and how it may appeal to your senses. SPOILERS BELOW!!!!!<br /><br />STORY<br /><br />This movie is sort of an IQ test. Inception's story may be the most complex story you'll ever have to go on. Many things are thrown at you. You will be trying to focus on one thing, and you'll think you understand everything, well no. There is so many things you have to look into when watching this film, and trying to understand its flow. Former dream architect Dominic \\"Dom\\" Cobb and business partner Arthur perform corporate espionage using an experimental military-developed machine to infiltrate the subconscious of their targets and extract information while dreaming, their latest target being Japanese businessman Saito. Tiered dream within a dream strategies are used and dreamers awaken by a \\"kick\\" such as falling or by dying in the dream. If the dreamer is the one who awakens, the dream \\"collapses\\". Each extractor carries a totem, a small object the behavior of which is only predictable to its owner, used to determine whether a dreamer is in someone else's dream. Cobb's totem is a spinning top that perpetually spins in the dream state. The extraction fails due to Mallorie \\"Mal\\" Cobb, Cobb's deceased wife, whose memory projection sabotages the mission. Saito reveals, after Cobb's and Arthur's associate sells them out, that he was actually auditioning the team to perform the difficult act of inception: implanting an idea into a person's subconscious while they sleep.<br /><br />Saito wishes to break up the energy conglomerate of his ailing competitor Maurice Fischer, by planting the idea in his son and heir Robert Fischer to disintegrate his father's company. Should Cobb succeed, Saito would use his influence to clear a murder charge against Cobb, so he can return to the United States and his children. Cobb accepts the offer and assembles his team: Eames, a conman and identity forger; Yusuf, a chemist who concocts the powerful sedative for a stable dream within a dream strategy; Ariadne, an architecture student tasked with designing the labyrinth of the dream landscapes; and Arthur. Saito accompanies so that he knows whether or not Cobb and his team succeeded.<br /><br />When the elder Fischer dies in Sydney and his body is flown back to Los Angeles, the team share the flight with Robert Fischer and Cobb sedates him, bringing him into the shared dream. At each stage, the member of the team generating the dream stays behind to initiate the \\"kick\\", while the other members sleep within the dream to travel a level deeper. In the first level, Yusuf's rainy downtown dream, the team abducts Fischer. However Fischer's trained subconscious projections attack and severely wound Saito. Eames temporarily takes the appearance of Fischer's godfather, Peter Browning, to suggest Fischer reconsider his father's will. Yusuf drives the team in a van as they are sedated into Arthur's dream, a hotel, where the team recruit Fischer, convincing him his kidnapping was orchestrated by Browning. In the third dream level, a snowy mountain fortress dreamed by Eames, Fischer is told they are in Browning's subconscious, but they are really going deeper into Fischer's. Yusuf, under assault by trained projections, initiates his kick too soon by driving off a bridge, sending Arthur's dream world into zero-gravity and causing an avalanche in Eames' dream. Arthur improvises a new kick using an elevator that will be synchronized with the van hitting the water, while the team in Eames' dream races to finish the job before the new round of kicks.<br /><br />Due to the effects of heavy sedation and multi-layered dreaming, death during this mission will result in entering Limbo, dream space of unknown content where the dreamer could be trapped. Elapsed time in each dream level is roughly twenty times greater than in the level above it; in Limbo, the deepest level of all, 24 hours of outer-world time would be experienced as about half a century. Cobb reveals to Ariadne that he spent \\"fifty years\\" with Mal in Limbo constructing a world from their shared memories whilst seemingly growing old together. After returning to the waking world, Mal remained convinced she was still dreaming and committed suicide, trying to persuade Cobb to do so by retroactively incriminating him in her death. He fled the U.S. and left his children behind, ostensibly in the care of his father-in-law.<br /><br />Saito succumbs to his wounds, and Cobb's projection of Mal sabotages the plan by killing Fischer, sending them both into Limbo. Cobb and Ariadne enter Limbo to find Fischer and Saito, while Eames remains on his dream level to set up a kick by rigging the fortress with explosives. Cobb confronts his projection of Mal, who tries convincing him to stay in Limbo. Cobb refuses and confesses that he was responsible for Mal's suicide: having convinced her to leave Limbo by using inception to plant the idea in her mind that the world they had been living in for fifty years was not real, and hence the need to kill themselves in order to return to the real world, once back in the real world she continued to believe dying would wake her. Mal attacks Cobb but Ariadne shoots her. Through his confession, Cobb attains catharsis and chooses to remain in Limbo to search for Saito. Ariadne pushes Fischer off a balcony, bringing him back up to the mountain fortress, where he enters a safe room to discover and accept the planted idea: that his father wishes him to be his \\"own man\\", and that splitting up the conglomerate might not be a radical notion.<br /><br />All of the team members except Cobb and Saito ride the synchronized kicks back to reality: Ariadne jumps off a balcony in Limbo, Eames detonates the explosives in the fortress, Arthur blasts an elevator containing the team's sleeping bodies up an elevator shaft, and the van in Yusuf's dream hits the water. Cobb eventually finds an aged Saito and the two remember their arrangement, presumably killing themselves and awakening to outer-world reality on the airplane. Saito honors the arrangement and Cobb passes through U.S. customs once the plane lands in Los Angeles. Before reuniting with his children, Cobb tests reality with his spinning top, but he turns away to greet them before observing the results. As I stated earlier, this is a lot to go on, so you can't miss a single second of this film, or you will not understand its climax. Inception's story is something you won't understand the first time around.<br /><br />ACTING<br /><br />Why Dicaprio hasn't won an oscar for this fantastic performance? I will never understand. I mean how much better is he supposed to be? There aren't many actors out there like him these days who can become the character by putting so much expression and heart into his role. Joseph Gordon-Levitt makes the film even better. He, as an actor, supports leo's character in every way, he gives off a believable performance in support of leo. Ellen page is a fresh new actress who does her best to capture the role as the film's second protagonist. Tom hardy, I say this a lot but, Tom hardy is a great character actor who chooses the right roles. If you are looking for a persona film, Inception has multiple persona performances by each character, and is most desirable! Michael caine, same old same old.<br /><br />CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT<br /><br />There is so much character development in the entire film. Good thing the film is long enough for you to understand the characters in the film, and what their purpose is. I can't stress this enough, PAY ATTENTION TO THE FILM!<br /><br />SPECIAL EFFECTS AND SETS<br /><br />The cgi is one of the main aspaects that captures this film. The sets and effects are visual striking. I would imagine this film making a beautiful blu ray, unfortunatley I didn't purchase the blu ray, but the dvd. It feels as if you are in this illusionary world (No pun intended). It doesn't look fake at all, not one little bit. Of course christopher nolan had to hire the best cgi workers in the world.<br /><br />DVD QUALITY<br /><br />I purchased the dvd at a small store. I note that the dvd says \\"Inception\\", then it says \\"Origine\\". I am not sure what origine means or what language that is, but if someone could tell me I would appreciate that. Overall, the picture quality of this dvd is great, very clear, good sound, no fuss or sound issues. The film is presented in widescreen.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES<br /><br />-The inception of inception- Christopher nolan shapes his unusual concept for the movie.<br />-The japanese castle: The dream is collapsing- Creating and destroying the castle sets.<br />-Constructing paradoxical architecture- Designing the staircase to nowhere.<br />The freight train- Constructing the street faring express train.<br /><br />LANGUAGES<br /><br />The languages are in english, french, and in espanol, dolby surround 5.1. Also has english subtitles for hearing impaired.<br /><br />SOUNDTRACK<br /><br />The music is really nice in this film, it has an epic sound. A great orchestra was hired to make this film. Love the trailer music, ending music, I'm gonna see if I can find the tracks on cd anywhere.<br /><br />FINAL WORD<br /><br />Inception is a film that is testing your IQ. Therefore, this film may not be for everyone if you don't like to think that hard when watching a film. However, you will be spending almost 3 hours of your time contemplating what is going on in terms of events, but in the end, it all leaves you with an inscrutable climax that will begin to make piece together all that has happened. Many people had questions in the end, because the film is like rocket science, but it's so exciting. Inception is one of those films you have to watch over and over again. Christopher nolan's vision of filmaking is pure solid geniusness! You can't miss out on a film like this, and if you have any unanswered questions, simply dig deep into the film's presence, find what you found passionate about the film, and slowly piece everything together. I will be reviewing the departed soon, so stay in touch.o reality: Ariadne jumps off a balcony in Limbo, Eames detonates the explosives in the fortress, Arthur blasts an elevator containing the team's sleeping bodies up an elevator shaft, and the van in Yusuf's dream hits the water.

B0095ZMMCK|3.0|Please, please, please start writing your own books again. It is increasingly obvious to the Clancy fan base, that these books are written in name only. A decent read, but without the writing style of the master story teller. Too bad, I am a huge Jack Ryan fan....
B000FC1LOC|5.0|i love jodi picoult's writing.  they are suspenseful, easy to follow and almost all have been unpredictable until the end.
B000UZNRS2|2.0|I am struggling to come up with enough words to meet the required amount. As far as a Baldacci book goes.....very blase, not very interesting. Hopefully an aberration as I have enjoyed his books in the past.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|i love jodi picoult's writing.  they are suspenseful, easy to follow and almost all have been unpredictable until the end.
B00B0ZT9NI|3.0|I was glued to this movie for the first 1 1/2 hours. There was plenty of suspense throughout to keep you on the edge of your seat, but the ending was cheesy. My friend and I felt like we were watching Gigli towards the end! Having said that, I still give it 3 stars.
B008G8SFGO|5.0|Their latest studio album and also their finest, the raw edgy sound has re-cemented kiss as the hotest rock band inthe world.  You must get this album.
B001FB4VY4|5.0|This is the best show on TV by far.  Everyone should be watching it!  Absolutely love it!!<br />Wonder when I can stop writing words, so I can SUBMIT this review?
B000002L9Y|5.0|Lovely rythm's great lyrics and just sweet to drift away with, one of the best fleetwood mac albums in my opinion.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I feel as though I can make the world disappear while listening, really focus on my work without distraction.  Better for this purpose than radio or music, which I would stop and listen to. Wonderful app and really well thought out.
B00AVTMCYW|5.0|The movie was set in a time & place very much like my own, so I could relate very well with the characters, scenes and goings on of the actors in the movie.  It was almost like a revised &#34;Sixteen Candles&#34; that actually came out when I was in high school, yet this movie was just as good and unique even though it's some 25 years ago or so.  I think that there was a part of me that wished that my high school experience was as interesting as this movie, but now I realize that it was as fun!  I just didn't remember it as nicely as the scenes in the movie.  I thought that all of the actors did excellent jobs because I never felt as though they were reading their lines or not truly acting well.
0345803485|5.0|I couldn't put this book down...I simply loved it! I need to figure out what to read after this trilogy...
B008JGSM6G|5.0|A great way to kill a few idle minutes.<br />Great to play with family members<br />I'm guessing playing this with younger must have a positive impact on helping them with problem solving.
B001B1CBSQ|5.0|The Fugees are one of Hip Hop's gems in the entire genre. No other group was as spiritually uplifting, and no other group before or after the era of the Fugees was creating this kind of blend of funk, reggae, R&B and hip hop all at once. All three members with the de facto Wyclef Jean, Pras and of course the impeccable Lauryn Hill have incredible chemistry together that is undeniably captivating. As much as I give praise to the lyricism of Wyclef and Pras, the star of the album is without a doubt Lauryn Hill, with her cunning lyrical ability filled with swagger, tenacity and demand for attention; not to mention her distinct soulful singing. With this album, we see the upcoming of a star that would be Lauryn Hill, with female emcees on the decline since the late 80's and early 90's along with MC Lyte and Queen Latifah, I would consider Lauryn Hill the top Female MC of all time with incredible talent. This album was created as a listenable movie filled with skits that tie the entire album together. The overall sound of the album is diverse but has an undertone of a hardcore New York backdrop that is similar to many of the mafioso-themed Hip Hop albums that were released during the times such as Biggie's \\"Ready to Die\\" or Raekwon's \\"Only Built 4 Cuban Linx...\\".<br /><br />The album as a whole is filled with social commentary of the human conscious, going through life with contemplations of their surroundings and finding one self. My personal favorites would have to be \\"Ready or Not\\", \\"The Mask\\", \\"Fu-gee-la\\" and \\"Killing Me Softly\\". The production is rich of colorful instrumentations mixed with 90's boom bap, jazzy samples, funk and reggae. This is one of Hip Hop's best that any music fan should own.
141659521X|4.0|All Vince Flynn's books are page turners.  If you are a Mitch Rapp fan these books are for you.  Anyone in the genre who reads adventure, no prisoners taken, tough guy marine books will love this too.  Write down the character names, a lot of them read the same.
B005ZHBA9I|5.0|I finally realized that I watched this particular installment more than &#34;normal&#34; because of the soundtrack.  Finally bought the music and put the movie back in its box.  Great music to have in the background while reading or working.  Recommend.
B00594XOZU|5.0|I love this awesome app it lets me send pictures and it lets me find people fast and easy!!! This is the best texting app I've ever had!
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Bond is the Best!!! The cinematography is spectacular, the directing for this new Daniel Craig era is so dynamic and entertaining.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This is very easy for me to get any weather info that I am interested in. Do appreciate user friendly.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Have been a Tom Clancy fan for years and this book did not disappoint. Clancy makes you feel like &#34;know&#34; these characters and have watched them grow and evolve. Hopefully there will be many more of his Jack Ryan books to come.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|it is a very fun game. but once i had to remove it from my kindle fire then download it again. now i press on the app it brings me to the  &quot;i&quot; opening page then kicks me off. its annoying because im like at level 10 so i have to remove it from my kindle and put it back. im also annoyed cause i just bought barry bones. the app wont load any more and im really really annoyed.
B009X01GJ2|5.0|This is the best case/cover ever. I like to read during lunch, so having a case that lets the Kindle stand is very nice. Being able to rotate the reader is a bonus because I prefer to read with the Kindle in more of a book position. Also having grooves and tabs makes it so you never have to worry about it slipping should it get jostled or bumped.  But the best feature is the ability to turn off when you close the cover. Then when you reopen it is instant on. It is great when you have a few extra minutes to read, but don't have the time to wait for it to boot up. I love it. Wish they had this for the first Kindles that came out.
B004EFYZ1C|4.0|very helpfull.I have to check the accuracy to be 100% satisfied .bla ,bla, bla ,bla, bla, bla ,bla ,bla,bla .

B00A6HHJ9C|5.0|I am really loving this. I have been totally loving the direction that Steve has been taking with his music and no doubt this is his best effort to date. When the title cut started playing I swore for a moment I was listening to Jeff Beck. Having Jeff's bassist prodigy, the amazing Tal Wilkenfeld playing bass on this CD only adds to that influence and fresh mystique Steve is bringing to the table. Just when you think that Steve has become the new Jeff Beck-like guitar prog god he throws an harmony-rich ethereal anthem at you like Right The Wrong or the bluesy-pop of Last Man Standing. There's an astonishing integrity with which Steve moves through his strongest musical modes with ease and an intelligence that keeps the music honest and uncontrived. His heart and mind are opening from the heartbreak he is leaving behind and his blues have a new hopeful and creative spark, at times jazzy and experimental and at others finding new refinement in standard blues-pop structures in the way that only he can. Highly recommended.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Very nice game..the graphics are fantastic ...I recommend the this game to everyone it is very entertaining.. Not a waste of space in anyway
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game has the most awesome graphics and great variety of play. I love this game! Thanks to the developers... fantastic job!!!

B005K0HDGE|5.0|Stephen King with a new twist on an old trope.  It's a page turner, or in case of the Kindle version, a screen swiper!
B006LSZECO|4.0|From almost the first page I had a hard time putting this book down.  I stayed up late and woke up early just so I would have more time to read it.  The story moves fast and I wanted to know what happened to Amy and was her husband relieved or distressed that she was gone.  The story becomes slightly unbelievable about 3/4 of the way through and I did not care for the ending but I do recommend the book.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is a fun little app to keep me and the kids busy. Graphics are good and the controls work easily.
B0076DELIG|5.0|As always, Connelly does not disappoint with his Harry Bosch novel.  Great read abiut a foreign journalist who was killed during the LA riots. Her murder was left unsolved until Bosch reopens the case and brings finality to the mystery of hef demise.
B00ANW33CM|1.0|The game would not download. It is still not on my phone. I tried twice to download, but it never dis.
B00AKYRCNY|1.0|i thought this was going to be better.  it ended up being really kiddie and not what I thought it to be.
0307460444|5.0|Martha is the best! Love, love this book. Lots of great ideas and even how to's and some great tips! Can't wait to use them.
B007T8BYWE|1.0|thought you could fly a plane but it is just puzzles. no art just puzzles.  not worth getting.  it sucked
0525952926|4.0|This was a thoroughly engrossing read, but I wanted more . . . there were some areas of the book that were just not given the space and time needed.  I hope in book three that Ken takes however long and as much space as he needs to tell the story and keep the rhythm!  An outstanding series I have thoroughly enjoyed, thanks!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I find the season 3 Downton Abbey to be an excellent portrayal of life in that age.  The acting superior and believable.  I am from GB and can relate to and remember much of what I see.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|This is a really cute game. I just wish it wasn't so difficult to find and add friends.it should be like iceage.
B00992CF6W|5.0|If you like minecraft then you must buy this app. it is just like minecraft on Pc on the go!
1400069289|5.0|So without giving you the book in a short summary, here is how i look at it. If you don't want to refresh some lessons learned in times past, or have updated information about something you may already know, or maybe proof in something you have believed to be true but had doubts, then don't read this book. Even that statement is too small and broad, but the point being is that this is a great book for those who are looking for an interesting read about an interesting topic and history. Take what you want out of it, but if you are looking for something to revolutionize your world and give you the best examples to change your life, you'll be out of luck. This is \\"The Power of Habit\\" not \\"Let Me Show You How to Psych Yourself Out of Your Bad Habits, Give You Will Power, and Teach You How to Believe in Yourself\\". If your looking for change, look in the mirror, help yourself befor reaching out to books and blaming them if you can't succeed. This book is not an intorduction into reinventing the self, but simply information on how, when, where, and why about the very strong nature of habits. And to point out, i say \\"nature\\" because of the science that the book entails that is not common knowledge.
B0077ZNCE2|4.0|I love Twilight, so this had 4 stars on the story alone!  The acting is horrible though, but it was a pretty good job picking out the important bits to include in the movie.
B00AMBH70S|2.0|I'll be generous and give it 2 stars, mainly for some great senic shots. The movie plods along with references to Treadstone and other previous Bourne movie anchor points. There is a wild motorcycle chase sequence at the end but by that time I was already playing around with my Kindle, having lost interest somewhat earlier. Jeremy Renner is not remotely believeable, too bad an actor couldn't have been hired for that part. I admire Edward Norton greatly but his talents are wasted in this one. Casting him as an upper level CIA boss doen't fly. Wait for Red Box availability on this one, that way you'll only waste a dollar.
B009GEEMLY|3.0|There are more special effects than story telling, and some unnecessary side stories that don't add to the main story.  Overall, I gave 3 stars because it WAS the story that we all know and love.
1594487154|4.0|The reality is we are all in sales. Whether we are presenting a new idea to the boss or our team, interviewing for a job, teaching concepts at school, getting our kids to go to bed, or selling used cars, we are all trying to motivate someone to do something. Old fashion, hard-core sales techniques don't work in most of these areas. Daniel Pink would say it doesn't work selling used cars either because the practice of selling by pushing a product on someone else, and of coercing, deceiving, or cheating them in the process is dying. Thank goodness! To be sure, there will always be people who will try, but because of the internet the rest of us can be better informed about our purchases and even push back--when a person or business gets out of line--in the form of rating a company or a product on a social media website. So how do we get someone to do something without being pushy? I believe some of what we should do is just common sense, like the Golden Rule, but for all the rest Daniel Pink has some very good insights. I learned a lot from this book.
B00AMBM9MO|5.0|This movie made both my husband and me laugh all the way through.  It is a little bit crude - just fyi in case you haven't seen any previews.  Great movie though!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|always loved stephen kings work but hadnt read any in quite some time. this is a pleasant departure from the horror & monster type of before & am enjoying it. a totally cool concept.
B0098VYKSA|4.0|It is hard to get excited about yet another fairy tale remake.  My husband talked me into watching this, and it wasn't bad.  Kristen Stewart just isn't a good actress.  The movie was okay.
B000088SYA|5.0|How do you define great music?  You don't have to. Ask a dozen people that know this album why they like it and I bet you get a dozen completely different answers.  There's something about the entire mix that is just appealing and fun. It beats, it's alive and it makes you want to move.  Some albums and some music just have a magical quality and this is one of those rare examples.  It would hold up if released today, you can take that to the bank.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it is such a fun game to play to little kids even if you are older it is still fun to play.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|My entire family loves Downton Abbey.  I can't wait for the next episode.  Thomas is bad to the bone.  Thanks
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read (and not only in the YA genre).  I recommend this book for anyone teen and older.
B009VLX8FS|5.0|Love Taylor and the songs on this album are some of her best yet.  Never get tired of her work.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is really fun to play when I am bored, and it is super fun to play with my little brother!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this type of puzzle game so it has been fun to move up the levels.  It can get a bit boring but all in all I loved it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is great.It's addicting and it has so many things. I can't stop playing this game.I love their governor's and their characters. THIS IS THE BEST EVER
B00683JK9K|1.0|I read some of the other posts with disbelief when they stated the puzzles were missing pieces. Afterall, how could an electronic puzzle be missing pieces? I downloaded this app after seeing it as the free app that day and after playing a few of the beginner puzzles just to see how it worked, I went right to the 'master' level. Sure enough, I no sooner got the border nearly completed when I noticed there weren't enough border pieces to finish it! Is this some kind of cruel joke by the developer? This HAS TO BE PROGRAMED IN INTENTIONALLY!!!  There is no way this can be a mistake on an electronic puzzle. Anyone who is having this problem and PAID for this game should demand their money back! This is a disgrace!
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|wanted a game for my new kindel, this is not the game for me, everyone was talking about it, Why?
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Angry Birds is fun and enjoyable. It keeps me entertained when I have to wait for something or I'm exercising.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|Still trying to figure out the ins and outs but overall pleased with the game. Animals are really cute. Moves along pretty good.
B00632HWOG|5.0|This email site is easy to use. They have lots of interesting and informative information about current events. I get my email easily and quickly.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|waa I would give five stars but I cant access the app temple run two that's why I rate three stars
0670020745|3.0|While the author's personal story is riveting, her discussion of how the brain works was very repetitive and not terribly informative. I was hoping for a much more in depth look at recovery from stroke and regaining brain function.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|I'm very pleased with this CD...I fell in love instantly with almost every single song on it. I only wish I would've broke down and bought one of her CDs sooner!
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|There are some good twists and turns, but a lot of parts are dragged out. Characters aren't that captivating, and their relationship dynamics are a little far fetched.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I saw the movie when it was in theaters and enjoyed it, but hesitated to read the book because I thought it was more geared toward teens.  But with my kindle fire and prime, it was free so I gave it try.  I didn't realize how much I'd enjoy Collins' writing style.  Quick yet descriptive sentences.  The book reads fast with a suspenseful edge.  I'm looking forward to reading the rest of the trilogy (which isn't free).
B0089EHWQE|4.0|Loved the characters. This book had me laughing out loud and crying at times. Really enjoyed this book and would recommend it to friends.<br /><br />Not your average love story.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|So vicious in parts. Diving immediately into the next one. Just fantastic story telling. One of the best series I've ever read.
B0067RQYNW|5.0|this app is ready to go , even as a free version , i mean maybe some of the more advanced features like margen managment would be usefull if you need to put together professional documents , but for vueing and editing documents , its great
B004GJXQ20|5.0|I watched the HBO series first but the book has revealed all the subtleties I may have missed and clarified the various political tensions as well as the geographic relationships between each house. A must read if you watched the tv series.  I couldn't put it down and read it at every spare moment
B005VT42BS|5.0|even on 100+ console networks this thing still rocks ,honestly i put this app right up there with wireshark , for it gereral usefulness
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is so fun and I think Its much better then temple run. Download subway surfers now. This is a fine product so fun and entertaining. I hope you will love this games like I do. I'm praying that you will never stop playing the game.
B0096DFBZQ|5.0|It is my love. Of vidio games, this is a fave of mine becase i know how to play it already.
B005COO1X6|1.0|Good at first but then very boring. Got me into it at the beginning but then lost me. Wish it had more depth.
B0007TKNII|5.0|i got the movie for my daughter. i just never got into any of these type movies.good present for her
B004SKJTY6|1.0|I also was MISLED into thinking this was the movie, not a 5-minute teaser.  Amazon advertises lots of free videos for Prime customers .. I guess this is what they mean. Back to Netflicks.
B003CN5SAY|5.0|alot of these operations are 100% accurate. u couldn't find a better bunch of actors for this show.i was hoping for a season 7 but i will live with your decision. just overall an outstanding .show.  i hated to see it go off the air
1419705849|5.0|My son read it in 1 day!  I love books that kids will beg to read!  You know you have a popular book when your 8 year old begs for it as a birthday present.
B000066C6Z|5.0|This is a really funny movie that skewers a few different genres, including spies, war, love.  You'll laugh all the way through and we watch is often to catch the funny lines we missed the last time.
B00683JK9K|5.0|It has different settings , pictures are beautiful, lovely scenery. It is great down time when I waiting at doctor's office etc.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|More than hidden pictures, that's what I like. Small puzzles make the game more interesting and some are a challenge. The hidden pictures are just enough of a challenge to make it worthwhile. I recommend this one for all you hidden picture adicts.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read, I wish I would have read it before we lost a true hero, not only in war but with his actions after he returned home.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|ADDICTIVE! So good! The graphics are fantastic, and so is the play! I can't get enough, on the bigger screen it is so much better!
B007HACDLK|5.0|A superbly crafted, action-packed novel about what many people can only hope to be... a man of conviction, courage and honor... someone not given to taking either the path of least resistance or politically correctness. As in the Special Operations community, Mitch Rapp and his Band of Brothers &#34;Show Some Sack,&#34; when and where required... come hell or high water. Vince Flynn is a gifted story teller with insights into a world most Americans will never know, let alone experience.  Bravo for American exceptionalism!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book will keep you turning pages well into the night.  Imaginative, well written, great character development.  You feel you are right there. At the end, you'll be yearning to continue the second book of this popular trilogy.
B0007TKNII|5.0|Who doesn't love a good movie. Great price too! A must see. Add it to your collection today! x x
B001NLKXK2|5.0|I couldn't put this book down.  It's the story, told in narrative, of a successful vibrant woman's descent into early Alzheimer's Disease.  At it's core is a love story.  Love of life and love of family.  Keep your tissue box nearby.  It's unforgettable!
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|Who doesn't love a good movie. Great price too! A must see. Add it to your collection today! x x
B00AF6B22E|4.0|didn't give enough movie!!  ;the upside down flight was fantastic...the nudity was not necessary...I have an excellent imagination-(in other words unless they want to show males frontal view then don't show the female.)Would have loved to see how they filmed the upside down flight,etc.
B002ZG976U|5.0|Who doesn't love a good movie. Great price too! A must see. Add it to your collection today! x x
B001DRF84W|4.0|This hulk is more believable, more human and more likeable.  The actor made you want to embrace the poorly treated creature and beg them to understand him instead of trying to inaliate him
B000077VR3|5.0|Who doesn't love a good movie. Great price too! A must see. Add it to your collection today! x x
B0034G4P8A|4.0|this is a great little movie. I've been a fan of the super heroes since I was very young and nothing but comic books were available.
B000001F76|5.0|Bought this as a gift for my honey. He loves it. I am not a huge fan. But I did enjoy some on the songs.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this is just a simple game that's good for passing time. it's. also a good game to play with kids.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I got this game at first for my daughter, but now i cant stop playing it. Very sddictive and a ton of fun.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|So happy to have heard about this series at Christmas time. I could not stop watching until I got it completed. Would highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys a classic type series.
B00003CXAT|5.0|I have the complete set of Jurassic Park since the beginning. This one went bad [it was a VCR] and I just had to replace it.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|This is a very high quality series, makes it hard to watch some of the other shows on TV after watching a show of this quality. They all seem so shallow compared to Downton. Cannot wait to get this third season completed.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|I now have the complete set of DVD's. I have been buying them since they first came out. And watch the quite often.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This book was a very enjoyable read, keeping my attention and making it hard to put down. I am very glad I read it.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|I was really pleased with the DVD. It now completes my set. I've been collecting them since they first came out.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I really enjoy the way Colleen writes.  There is something so honest about her characters.  I loved this book as much as I loved Slammed and Point of Retreat.  Can't wait for the next one!!!!!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I didn't care for all the sex but enjoyed their relationship, their connection and banter.  At times I wished Ana would shut the heck up with all the annoying questions but all in all it was good.
B0092G1O8A|5.0|I enjoy action movies. This was an unusual one. It makes you wonder if this actually happens somewhere.<br />The ending is a surprise.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I had no plans on reading this book but a co-worker said that it was such a good love story and that I would like it.  I loved their connection, their banter and his over protection was cute. The sex was fun but the same results every time.  I did get annoyed with the style of writing but got so caught up in following their relationship that I went on and suffered though it...lol.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I just bought this game and I cannot stop playing it! It really is a lot of fun. My three year old loves it as well.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|I couldn't stand how it jumped from different scenes.  I was really bored with it.  I actually went to a blog and got the gist of the story to help me finish reading it but it was bad.
B000Q6GURU|4.0|the disc skipped once or twice in the opening credit but not at all through the movie itself. Good buy for a used disc.
1609611543|5.0|This book has changed our lives. We are getting healthier and can not believe the changes including weight loss we are experiencing.
1475143389|5.0|Mike's book is excellent for all bodybuilders. He uses simple terms that everyone can understand.He covers all Phrases of bodybuilding from bulking-up to getting cuts plus nurtion. The book price is right.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|This one was just as ingrossing as the past 4 and left me completely mad at the author over cliffhangers. Trying to wait patiently for \\"winds of winter\\" and \\"dream of spring\\" but unfortunately may not be out til 2014... sadness.
034580404X|5.0|I really enjoyed reading these.  Would definately recommend these to friends!!!  Would like to see more of what happens to this series.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I found this book to be a bit strange. It kept me reading but I felt overall it left me feeling out of sorts.
B0084AZXKK|4.0|Some of the formatting was off, but its great you can get classics for free!  Cant wait to get some more!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|love this game! its really additive. I would pay for this game. its like Mario brothers gone Irish! I hope they keep the updates going!
B001HNE3NO|5.0|Sarah,s Key recommeneded by my sister .A must read really is scarry to think this happened so close to when we were born!!!!
B001NLL93W|5.0|Easy read. Age range for the book series is teen to 101. Book series about the supernatural world. Love this series!
B003F3FJQO|5.0|As the second book I was looking forward to it, because the first was really good. I like this book just as much as the last, and maybe even better. I recommend it.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Another great love story. Well written, intriguing, mysterious, all together to create a great story. You won't be disappointed. Give it a shot.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I liked the twists and turns and the twists ending with the wolfs<br />And how katniss shot Casio in the head
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Quite a page turner. I sorta of figured where it was heading , but nonetheless, still well worth reading.<br /> Great!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it is so cool and addicting buy it and you won't regret it. My friend can't stop playing subway surfers because it's  such a good game. Hope you like it.
B0084B1T8Y|5.0|This book takes me right back to my childhood...I loved the movie. I love the book. It is so amazing this book makes you remember so much about the movie.
B0044RUSZM|4.0|Good price.  I wish it were stiff, but good enough for what it needs to be.  Saves lots of space on the desk.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I can say that overall I consider it a nice novel. The plot somehow seems unbelievable, but it sounds good as a fiction in the end. It also sheds light on some critiques of the American justice system. And the writer delivered a good message and advice about relationships between couples.<br />I felt bored most of the time during the first part, but it was quite exciting in the other two parts.
3836531038|4.0|Uwe Ommer is one of my favorite photographers, a master at capturing the beauty of womanhood -- in his case, African women in all states of undress. How come those photographs of bare-breasted natives I used to ogle in National Geographic never looked like this? Lovely.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I think the writer has excellent insight as to the mentality of cancer patients and the way others treat them. I think this is just an example of how we consider with inferiority some others, like the disabled for example. I always had this idea about the need to change the view toward them. The message is very valuable and ethical as far as I understand it. This is a really nice novel. I recommend for others to read.
0307749584|4.0|On longer trips my wife and I rely on audio books to entertain us. And \\"A Wanted Man,\\" the Jack Reacher thriller by Lee Child, did exactly that. While we enjoyed the Tom Cruise movie, we prefer our Jack Reacher big and brawny and -- yes -- read to us by Dick Hill on CDs like this one.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is the best Zombie show ever. Even my girlfriend, who never watches sci fi or horror (she's a psychiatrist for gods sakes) loves it.  I think because of the character development ... you know women. But it makes a sort of sense because if you can suspend your disbelief enough to accept the Zombie Apocalypse, they do a great job depicting how people might actually react and cope in such a situation. Plus there's lots of zombies and action and all that good stuff for us guys who don't really care about feelings but just want some blood and guts. We're totally hooked and were royally p***ed that we have to wait for the second half of season 3 to come out. You should watch this, but start with season 1&2 which you can get on Neflix streaming.
B005RUV0NY|5.0|You may think think this is just another show in the zombie genre, and it some ways, it is.  But the characters are complex and they are developing interesting roles.  The writing is compelling enough so just when you want to see some zombie chase scenes, one comes along.  I would say that this is not horror in the traditional sense.  I get freaked out by horror movies, but this show does not scare me like those.  This show falls more comfortably in the drama genre.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|This dvd was on my sons list for christmas. So he was happy when he got it. I know he enoyed watching it.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|It is sad to think that I would have not listened to this artist if I had not seen the movie \\"Searching for Sugar Man\\" That shows how mush we in America got used to trust music industry hype! Now I have found him I am amazed how good his music is. And more you listen better it get!  And movie is wonderful too!
B003ODIZL6|1.0|CNN ox TV of Beth her y ssh us fish Iran Inst if ebb uhh chi if ebb ox st
B0035LGXXO|4.0|Classic gang war film from a lost era. It is quintessential 70's. I would love for Quentin Tarantino to do a remake of this great and highly underrated film.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Haven't played much yet, but can tell by first few games that I am going to love it. Great way to past the time and enjoy it.
B000LPI68W|5.0|Very few action films are realistic, which them very hard to watch, at least for me. When I was going through Army Special Forces training in the late 90'2 we watched the sreet fight scene from the movie Heat and the scene in The Professional where the police are entering Leon's apartment. Classic lessons learned films. This movie is a must watch for anyone for a variety of reasons. It's about shady friends, dysfunctional families, and a love and strong bond formed by a man and 11 y/o girl who come from those respective situations. They join forces to exact revenge on the cops that killed her family and baby brother. This a must see film and one of the best action movies ever!
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|My mother and my sisters and I started watching season two of American horror story as the episodes came out on tv. Every week we started looking more and more forward to the next episode so I bought the first season. It did not disappoint. It arrived before the estimated time and was in perfect condition as described. Very pleased.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|this is ssssssssssssssssoooooooooo awesome!!!! you should totally get it!!!!!!!!!!!! it is fun but challenging at the same time. I love it, my mom loves it,  my brother loves it, my friends love it, everybody loves it!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game it really shows you how to take care of a horse. my horse is the best free horse game ever
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love the fact that you can revive yourself but the problem is you have to have gems. You also get shield when you fill up the coin meter. I truly love it &amp; I'm glad it finally came out (:
B0013UZHTU|1.0|This item is more than twice the price you would pay on the lego website.  Surely some mistake here, right?
B0029XFNAI|4.0|My wife and I enjoy this version of the Santa tale.  We saw it when we were still dating.  The movie is predictable but has a lot of charm.  It has become a movie that my family watches every year at Christmas.<br /><br />The blu-ray version of this movie is pretty good (we upgraded from VHS).  There are a couple scenes that you can see were they did matting.  Though that is probably like that in the movie's master.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Excellent horse game, lots of detail, fun and easy interface. Ability to pick different<br />horse, characters, and tack is great.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|A new twist to a story of our heroes with feet of clay. Topical. Good performances from Denzel Washington and John Goodman.
B00B2166BS|4.0|Could have just used the supplied cable.  This cable is much slicker and reduces my worry about breaking the USB port.  I have long thought that the magnetic type charger on the Apple products would take over on phones and tablets.  One small gripe is that the connector is only connects in one way.  I would have thought that you could connect without considering &#34;which side is up&#34;.  I put a small sticker on the &#34;up&#34; side so I don't have to figure it out each time.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game has a totally new feel from the original temple run. I love the cart the explorer has to jump into (pretty challenging for me) it is so much fun. I do think some of the graphics make it a little difficult to think but the more I play, the better it gets.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is awesome,It has good graphics ,you can build anything you want,and<br />the game NEVER ENDS!Even though it is expensive,it's worth it.So what are you waiting for? BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|My 8 yr old is enjoying the game. She says it is teaching her how to take care of horses. It is like the games that give you tasks to complete to earn money.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I tried it and it was epic. But, today it wouldn' open! If I could rate zero stars,  I WOULD!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think this game is fun and super I also like how I try to get a sertain amount of coins to buy a board or a Peron but either way I still reach my goal of how many coins I have I love subway surfers
B007IXWL2C|5.0|still reading , still reading still reading still reading still reading, why do we have to type 17 words, love the book
B0094BB4TW|5.0|It works better than the ipod ap.  It doesn't crash and you can actually tag people in posts.  Plus it's free.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I really enjoyed all three books. Great for any age. She keeps you wanting to know of ending of series early on!
0689835604|5.0|We bought this as a baby shower gift for a friend of ours. It was their first child and this just seemed like a to start a baby on the path to reading.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I love this alarm clock! I have tried others but I always come back to this one and always will!!
B00846TRHY|5.0|this was an excellent movie. take someone who was on the wrong road and turned his life around and made it great. i totally recommend it.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|Love the game...until it started freezing my kindle, force closing, and generally getting all buggy.  We had a good run, but they need to make a version for kindle.
B0098VYCCE|4.0|Pushing aside any Disneyesque trappings, &#34;Snow White and the Huntsman&#34; delivers a power struggle between between Beauty as Truth vs. Greed as Evil. Dusted with just the correct amount of Romance this dark cake tastes just right. Kudos to the filmakers for not making the Evil Queen, (God I love that girl from South Africa), a caricature. An oblique mention of possible abuse of the Evil Queen as a younger women is interesting without being gratuitous.
034580404X|3.0|This is a long drawn out love story.  Books one and two are page turners, but book three is difficult to get through.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I've never actually owned an &#34;official&#34; copy of Star Wars, but i decided to go ahead and get the Blu-Ray complete saga.  I cant think of much to say besides the bluray quality definitely outshines the old DVD format in terms of graphics and audio.  Anyone who enjoys this series should grab this item!
B004LROUNG|5.0|Another hit for John Grisham. In addition to a good story, always some law tidbits to learn! Although a common theme about Big Pharma, an interesting read.
1586638491|4.0|Book was as advertised; I would suggest getting the modern English translation along with the Cliff Notes to ease reading
1846144132|5.0|Typical first class piece of work from Neil Macgregor.  The book can be dipped into without shame and is always rewarding.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is great. I love horses and this gives me the chance to take care of one. I think everyone should get this game.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I had heard good things about the movie so I went ahead and bought it.  The movie was hilarious and sad at parts.  I was surprised that my husband and 10 yr old son both loved it as well.  After the movie I wasn't expecting it to actually change my husband's heart the way it did, but it was amazing.  And it made me as a mother and wife want to be more supportive and devote more of my time to my family as well.  Great movie.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|A good way to see how fast life is evolving and how technology has over taken the simplest of life's pleasures
B007VYQ9G2|4.0|The film was great, I was just very disappointed because I thought I had ordered it in 3D. When I went back & checked I can't find anywhere that does offer it in 3D. So, it was my mistake, I'm just very disappointed
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is sooooo  fun and addicting. Once you start u can noot stop I rrcomend this to everybody its soo easy to
B007PVHANM|5.0|great documentary detailing bob's last days, should of had david rodigan view on bob and his impact...  given his history of reggae music.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|I purchased the Kindle edition of this book, and couldn't put it down. It combines an \\"old school\\" aspect of the story (wizards, going on a quest) with a modern twist (high tech industry) in a very \\"human\\" manner. You can identify yourself, or people you know, with the characters in this book.<br />I even ended up researching some of the factual background, and discovered there's a whole sub-culture abouts fonts!(Yes...fonts. You have to read the book.) I wholeheartedly recommend Mr Penumbra's 24 Hour Bookstore for a great read!
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|Just finished watching the first one last night and it looks absolutely amazing.  The Blu-ray format is crisper, clearer and so much better than I remember when I'd seen it the first time.  There's a TON of content; more than I'll probably ever get to but it's nice to have options.<br /><br />Anyone who likes The Matrix movies will love this set.  It's a great value, would have paid a lot more than what Amazon is offering it for.
0316228532|1.0|Its simple, this is one of the worst books I have EVER read, there is nothing compelling, nothing enticing you to turn the pages.  It is drab and boring, the characters awful.<br /><br />Save your money, buy something else.
B009NPA3Q4|2.0|Phillip Phillips reminded me right from the get-go of a Dave Matthews wannabe. His moves, the way he stands when playing guitar/singing, everything about him was just like watching Dave Matthews. He did not have anything about his style that was unique. It's like he watched Matthews and studied his style and just copied it. I tried giving Phillips' album a try but I just can't get past the fact that he is a copy of someone who has already established their place in music. I just don't get into artists who are just like someone else who is already out there and has made it. It's like listening to Halo In Reverse, who has stolen/copied everything from Nine Inch Nails. You just can't recreate something and call it your own. It has obviously worked for Phillips, but he does have the right people behind him who can push it in the right direction.
0385536828|2.0|Boring, slow, endless details.  I couldn't relate to the characters.  They all seemed contrived, unreal.  The ending felt like cheap trick to me. Maybe the author was in a &#34;hate the reader&#34; state of mind.
B003AVMUU4|5.0|Firstly Brio wood train sets are more expensive then other options available at your local retailer. However I have been very satisfied with the build quality of all the included pieces. The people characters included are small approximately 2 inches tall. I removed the people from the set until my 2yr old was past the stage of putting everything in the mouth. The doors on the train are removable I removed for easy of play.<br /><br />Finally and most important, the kids love the set. They play nearly everyday with it. They have discovered that it looks a lot like the Disney Monorail and that has added even more levels of imaginative play.
0307592731|4.0|It is a fascinating read. The author's strange behavior and stupid mistakes, in contrast to evident intelligence, hold the reader's attention.
B005IU1OMA|5.0|Gave up in skate/snow boarding videos ten a friend showed me this. Wow. This breaths new life back into skate/snow  boarding genre.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|If you're a fan of the &#34;Aliens&#34; franchise or sci-fi movies in general, this is the set for you. For only $30, you get gloriously-restored Blu-Ray editions of all 4 movies, plus more extras than you could possibly have enough time to completely explore in a week-long period. I got this for my girlfriend because she is a huge &#34;Aliens&#34; geek, and even though she had the &#34;Quadrilogy&#34; set on regular DVD, she was very happy with this upgrade, as was I. The first two movies never looked this good! Game over, man!
B001ANSSDC|4.0|This is the first I have read about mental illness.  It is a moving story about a mans come back<br />From a tragic occurrence in his life.  I would recommend this book.
0375413405|5.0|Julia is so meticulous in directing the novice cook:  what pan to use, accompaniments, which wine to choose, and how to fix a turned sauce.  As a new bride, 40 years ago, my French husband handed me HIS Art of French Cooking and said, &#34;Make something interesting for dinner.&#34;  After 3.5 hours, I served him the best Coq au Vin ever.  Unrealizing, I had used a very expensive, very good wine for the stew:  1966 Chateau Margaux!  It will never be as good again, but always use a good wine.  It does make a difference!<br />Nunu Portier
B001BC5HXG|5.0|Books like this show the reason that John Steinbeck is considered one of the great authors of our lifetime. His writing flows like honey and paints pictures in our mind.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I saw the author on the Oprah interview and I thought it sounded interesting.  I really enjoyed reading about how he found God through such a life changing situation.  I want to share this book with my non-believeing friends and family.
B006HL9G10|5.0|This app works perfectly on my Kindle Fire HD and on the original Kindle Fire.<br /><br />I love the sound of the bells and the ability to set up presets where I can chose how long I want to meditate, which sound I want to hear and how often.<br /><br />I had originally used it only as a meditation timer but recently linked it to my Facebook page and am enjoying the added features that opens up for me.  It was a very pleasant surprise to get a message from someone else in another part of the world yesterday after I finished my meditation session to say \\"thanks for meditating with me.\\"<br /><br />I also enjoy the very uplifting comments folks add to their profile to show to others while they are meditating.  Insight Timer gives me a sense of being connected to a world wide meditation community, showing me who else is meditating when I am.  I feel that the personalized comments from many of the meditators helps to increase the feeling of shared positive energy.<br /><br />I highly recommend this application.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Breathtaking story, beautiful characters. Shows life how it is. People should have talk about this one, not about freaking kinky sick 50 shades.
078322737X|5.0|great movie toad is the best actor great cARs and aactors love it best movie of all time for ever
B001HDO4YW|4.0|I love Coldplay and vinyl, so when I saw this record I thought it was a match made in heaven. Upon receiving it, however, I found that the song with 2 or 3 songs didn't work. As if it one side had been scratched. I was disappointed, but enjoy the songs that do work.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I highly recommend this book! It keeps you reading and I was sad to see it end! Good job Stephen king!
B0052T7IC2|4.0|I am a long time Ramones lover and when saw this record, became ecstatic. Upon receiving it, I immediately put it on. I love the sound that carries through it, the music sounds alive and clear. Only a slight skip, and I might have done that, so a great product all in all.
1440503257|5.0|Very neat little book!  Very much captured by its charm and witt.  The recipes are very traditional to the U.K.  Any cook who also loves harry potter, will love this book!
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is the ultimate weather app. Platinum is better, but for free, this thing is awesome. I recommend it for the ultimate weather freak. Need the weather anywhere? This is there by your side. 2 thumbs up!
B004K00NMG|5.0|I love everything about this movie! The songs are catchy and the love story is sweet. Anastasia is one of my favorite animated movies!
B000FC2L1E|5.0|This series might be quite lengthly, but well worth the read! Fantastic read and can't wait to begin the next book in the series.
B009WO7NQO|1.0|Ok im all good with the season and regular and the other one but really youve made for now u guys got to learn to stop
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|This author is very detailed in her descriptions of the period and I really like that! Can't wait to finish the entire series.
0156030209|3.0|I can't figure what the hoopla is about.  It's an OK adventure story with no suspense since it's first person narrative.  Might be a good choice for high school as the prose is easy enough, and there are incidents a plenty.  I guess I missed the point.
B007SGM084|4.0|Great to see how she changes him and how he opens her thirst.  The trilogy bundle was worth the buy!
B00AC8ZJPQ|5.0|I was a little skeptical at first. I am a HUGE Halo fan. When I first saw that this was going to happen, I thought that it was just going to be another low-budget mediocre movie. But, I was wrong. It was entertaining and well acted. The effects were great. Especially the Covenant Aliens. I was shocked! They looked like they were straight from the game. The colors were perfect, they were all the correct sizes. They could have been \\"real.\\" It was awesome. Really the only thing I didn't like was Master Chief's voice actor It wasn't quite what I was expecting. It was close, but still not quite there.<br /><br />Overall this movie was extremely well done. This makes it VERY feasible for a movie based off the Halo games themselves.
B00AE9UYJ4|2.0|Really really really really really hard I will NEVER play it without someone with me. But I have to give the makers credit for making it so SCARY.AAAAAA
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is an awesome game! If u like horses u r going to love this game! Sometimes it freezes up though. Otherwise this game is awesome!!
B00992CF6W|4.0|I found it pretty fun it definitely makes me want to get the pc version and I will I recommend it....
B00A9C3RB8|2.0|Not for the younger crowd, it was a very depressing and down movie and would only recommend it to people who like to see two old people fight over nothing and then fall in love again... Great actors, just not a great script, in my opinion of course.
B008BQ8VOC|4.0|This show is hip, interesting, and entertaining -- well-played by all. Gabriel Macht (Harvey) fits his role perfectly. I reserve 5 stars for MM. However, this series has gotten better & better with each season. Good legal plots mixed with personal stories and neither overdone. Rick Hoffman, who's been around a while, brings a swarmy, lovable, annoying tinge to the scenes - he is great. I love a good cop show (Southland) and then legal and then medical shows. Last week I fell asleep before the end of the show (work day was too much) so I had to stream it on the weekend to catch up!
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|I had been looking forward to seeing this movie since it was released in the theaters and so had my 85 year old father, so we streamed it this afternoon.<br /><br />For those of you that have seen the movie, you probably understand the review title.  The movie begins with a naked woman prancing around a hotel room. I'm not a prude by any means, however I do feel that it was over done, which created some awkward moments as we sat there watching the movie. I don't understand the need to inject this type of nudity and foul language in a movie - call me old fashioned.  Wish that I had read more of the reviews prior to renting Flight and  had instead rented another movie to watch with Dad.  My mistake.
B0074MZSWW|5.0|Organic and real !! Music the way it is supposed to be, Not like the over proccesed crap I have heard for the last 25 years-Like breathing fresh air again-Hats off to the  Alabama shakes -Old school recording and the real deal !!
B001JI5DRC|5.0|I use it in middle school science but the swearing is a problem and I have to skip small parts of the movie when I show it at school. However, it really make the complexity and danger of space travel real for the  students.
B002XZOZQA|5.0|Always a favorite movie of mine. I've watched it many times and loved it again! Cast is perfect - music is sensational!
B005VPRDAY|5.0|perfect for storing legos as you buy additional sets! reduces clutter in our girls' room and gives them an opportunity to remember to clean up after themselves
0307474259|1.0|I read this book in 2011 and followed Taubes' advice for several month (including his recommendation of the new Atkins for a new you). I didn't know better at that time.  While you can lose weight on such a diet it is almost impossible to maintain it and stay slim. That's why Low-Carb diets come in last in long-term weight maintenance. Please google:  Atkins Comes in Last for Long-Term Weight Maintenance Or check this video on Youtube: Low Carb vs. Plant-Based  or:  Low Carb Guru Update  Are you aware that beef and cheese causes an insulin response which is even higher than oatmeal?  His recommendation that you don't need to exercise is also plain wrong. Farmers know that effective fattening of farm animals can be achieved by not letting them exercise.  Dr. Michael Greger MD summarizes every year several thousand scientific studies about nutrition. The science is very consistent here and totally contradicts Gary Taubes' view. You should check his yearly DVDs &#34;Latest in Clinical Nutrition&#34; or his website: nutrition facts org (please google it). Gary Taubes recommendations are the best advice to die early either from heart disease / stroke, or from cancer, which this nutrition style extremely promotes.  Dear Reader, I just want to make you aware so that you can avoid the mistakes I did and get slim and healthy sooner. My wife and I are both slim now with a normal BMI and we are no vegans or animal rightists (even do not have a pet) but eat plant-based (whole unprocessed) and meat maximal 2 times per month.  Here are just 2 examples out of many where Taubes is making fake science or just cheating:  In his book Good Calories, Bad Calories he uses the 22 country study about dietary fat and death rates and claims that when you would also include all 22 countries (instead of cherry-picking just 6 countries) there is no clear relationship between these 2 variables. This is absolutely not true. Additionally, he omits (intentionally?) the very strong link between higher animal protein intake and increase in heart disease rates.  He is downright lying by writing that sugar consumption did predict heart-disease rates as well as saturated fat consumption in the Seven Countries Study. Sorry Mr. Taubes but you know that this is not true. Sugar was not significant (at r=0.13) while saturated fat was at (r=0.62). Gary Taubes is just making stuff up.  Check the undeniable facts. Here a quote from Atkins Exposed about Taubes: &#34;Taubes evidently interviewed a number of prominent obesity researchers and then twisted their words. &#34;What frightens me,&#34; said one, &#34;is that he picks and chooses his facts.... If the facts don't fit in with his yarn, he ignores them.&#34;[47]   The article seemed to claim that experts recommended the diet. &#34;I was greatly offended at how Gary Taubes tricked us all into coming across as supporters of the Atkins Diet,&#34; said John Farquhar, a Professor Emeritus of Medicine at Stanford. When the Director of the Center for Human Nutrition at the Washington University School of Medicine was asked to comment of one of Taubes' claims, he replied, &#34;It's preposterous.&#34;[48]   &#34;He took this weird little idea and blew it up,&#34; said Farquhar, &#34;What a disaster.&#34;[49]   &#34;The article was written in bad faith,&#34; said another quoted expert. &#34;It was irresponsible.&#34;[50] &#34;I think he's a dangerous man. I'm sorry I ever talked to him.&#34; Referring to the book deal, &#34;Taubes sold out.&#34;[51]   What the researchers stressed was how dangerous saturated fat and meat consumption could be, but Taubes seemed to have conveniently left it all out. &#34;The article was incredibly misleading,&#34; said the pioneering Stanford University endocrinologist Gerald Reaven who actually coined the term Syndrome X. &#34;I tried to be helpful and a good citizen,&#34; Reaven said, agreeing to do the interview, &#34;and I ended up being embarrassed as hell. He sort of set me up... I was horrified.&#34;[52]  [47] The Washington Post 27 August 2002. [48] Nutrition Action Healthletter November 2002. [49] Nutrition Action Healthletter November 2002.

B00ABGEFWC|5.0|so cute. great way to pass the time. and the graphics are pretty awesome. just wish the stuff wasn't so expensive.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|This game works great on my HTC Thunderbolt.  The images were beautiful.  The gameplay was challenging enough to be fun and easy enough for my 10 year old to solve.
B004EPYZXU|5.0|This isnt one of those movies where you can look away for a second and go right back to watching, you need to pay attention so you know whats going on.  Its slow paced so its not for the type who have to have something big happen every few minutes.  All the action in this film is pretty much in the last 15 minutes.  But I felt it was worth it, it was a good enough film to keep me interested.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|This was amazing!!  I could not put it down!!! At first I wasn't sure if I would like it but then it got really good and I couldn't stop myself!!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Flow Free lives up to its reputation as an addicting game.  Be careful, this game can cost you a lot of time.
B009UZLRJE|5.0|well, yeah, I do. I really don't watch TV any more, not to watch a weekly program. But in order to escape election year I began watching episodes of the Big Bang Theory every evening until I realized that I wanted the whole thing from the beginning. We haven't laughed so much in a long, long time - I love Sheldon and my partner hates him so it makes for some very fun viewing together.<br /><br />I think we'll enjoy these for a long time.
B0066WJLU6|4.0|Not only does it work well as a flashlight, it also has a full color palate and dimmer so it can be used in a hotel room as a night light.
B007KQI1NA|4.0|Purchased to use with Microsoft Trips & Streets. This works better; liknks faster, finds my location faster than the receiver that Mirosoft included with the program.
B001ANSSDC|2.0|I sure hope the movie is better than the book. I don't not like it, but I also would not recommend it. Over slow and predictable.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|my 5 yr old daughter &amp; i both love this game! it's very realistic &amp; the graphics are great. very addictive lol
B009U9S6FI|5.0|As classics go, this not typical. The reason? Well classics frequently attract readers who have every intention of reading timeless literature, yet alas, they occupy space for a generation and the glue backing is brittle and splits the book in half when it is finally cracked open. The Ipad storage story? Ask me in a generation's time.<br />Now Victor Frankl's &#34;......Search For meaning&#34;: Man's that is. It is a classic and a bloody good one to actually read. Why? Because it is classically meaningful and it makes classical common sense. If things are bad enough, how do you live without hope? Well if you are resident at hotel Auchwitz in the first half of the forties, you don't: unless you recall classics like Dostoyevsky. (spelled differently in Frankl's script but the same bloke I assume) You will learn that suffering is within the human condition for all of us. Therefore we can get meaning by being worthy of our suffering. To be unworthy is the real suffering. You may even die to be a worthy sufferer like that because it is better than turning into an impulsive unprincipled animal. Good people die in Frank's book but they lived with meaning until they were dead. How about us? Just because we don't live in concentration camps does not mean we do not suffer excruciating struggles. Frankl gives an analogy of a bottle that fills up with gas, meaning our lives fill up with challenges that pain us wherever we are. The second part of the book is a technical and professional rationale of what Frankl told us about in the first half. Why don't you just read it and see if you find principles to find some meaning in?

B0063IH60K|1.0|I appreciate all the reviews about the ads. I always check out the reviews before I download an app. The warnings about the ads was enough to keep me from downloading. thx
B002EEP3NO|5.0|Yes, I would recommend this Lego. It is awesome, cool, every thing you think it is and more. It rocks!

B0053KWDES|5.0|This is the best bet for the money. Yeah you could spend more but why. This is perfect for taking your iPhone or iPod to the next sound level. Really makes it feel like you have a stereo in your pocket. Highly recommended.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Have always enjoyed Solitaire. I like that it takes me so little time to play (that's probably because I lose so much!). I just keep trying.
B00B8R1NP0|5.0|I loved this book! I read it all in one day because I HAD to know what was going to happen next. It has everything you could possibly want in a thriller/suspense novel. I can't wait to see what Mr. Thiede comes up with in his next endeavor!
B007N8RULO|5.0|Play this pretty often. Really enjoy playing this game on my Kindle Fire and Laptop. Glad my daughter told me about it.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|I like. it is fun to play It is a fast game. It  keep you interested in moving to  next level
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I really enjoy this game, but am not very good at it. My kids have no problems with it at all. The smiling pigs just crack me up (an annoy me a little too).
B0064X7FVE|2.0|Like some other app downloads it's complicated to use.  A lot of small print and controls that make it complicated to find weather information in your area.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Christian and Ana are awesome together!  I can't wait for the next one!  Looking forward to seeing what will happen!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This is one of those games that pass the time without much thouight. It was easy to download and works well on the Kindle Fire.
B003FXXNH6|1.0|It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.

B002TLSSXO|5.0|Upon receiving these utensils and using them, I immediately chucked all of my old utensils!<br /><br />These are very rugged, the handles are nice and easy to grip (thick), with non-slip surfacing.  They sit directly on the counter without the serving end touching, which is amazing when you're used to using a plate, paper towel, etc. to keep your counters clean.<br /><br />They clean easily (food doesn't really stick too much) and they look really nice, either sitting out, in a drawer, or hanging on a wall.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is so awsome i love it i have it for computer and i wood like to have for kindel fire you shoud get it
B005K0HDGE|1.0|Kindle broke before I was finished with book.  Had to go to library to take it out to continue reading.  Had to then purchase a new kindle
B0014JGDUC|5.0|This is my third pair of these particular bistro crocs.  I like them because there are no holes in the front.  I have plantar fasciitis and after years of trial and error and many thousand of dollars I have noarrowed it down to three types of footwear.  I good (not cheap) pair of athletic shoes with superfeet inserts, Orthoheel or Dr. Weils for more dressy occasions and these crocs for around the house and errands.  These choices have really helped by pain subside, that is all I do now.  You won't be dissapointed with these.  I did order the wrong size at first but the exchange process was easy and successful.  Thank you Amazon.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Had no problems with this item.  Arrived easily and book was enjoyed.  Nothing negative about my experience in purchasing this book
0446547573|5.0|I read this book in no time at all, due to the fact that I wasnt able to put it down. I felt like I was there with the characters watching this story happen. The details are quite vivid. At times I could even feel my own heart racing. I Absolutly Loved this Book!
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I love this cover! It's classic and beautiful and looks just like an old book cover so that it could really just be placed in a bookshelf.  The leather material is amazingly soft, and the gold embossing is gorgeous.  I was a little skeptical about the elastic bands that hold the kindle down, but they are surprisingly secure.<br />My only wish is that sometimes when i throw this in my bag, I'm afraid that something will get between the covers and damage my kindle, but that's what a clear screen cover is for and I'm not usually rough with it.  If you're going to be throwing your kindle around and shoving it in bags with keys and coins and whatnot, I'd probably go for a more protective case, but if you play nice with your kindle, then this cover is just fine.
B00ANW33CM|5.0|Very challenging version. I enjoy Mahjong and I love 3D and the two together are great! I now it is going to be very addicting.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|makes you solve puzzles. in addition to hidden objects. best kind a little spooky. but addicting<br />like G5 games the best and I'm 63!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Omg I like love this game it is so like awesome I like love all the world tour stuff like Rio and new York city
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game is so fun. It is almost like the old Mario games but with a leprichon. I recommend you get this game and once you beat it, get Lep's World 2
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfed is the best game. It is so much fun.You will have lot of fun playing subway surfers.It works grate on kindle fireand and ipad.  So you should get this game
143911000X|1.0|you have to be a very immature, silly boy to honestly want to read this thing.  Too bad there are many kids who like it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Es una muy buena aplicaci&oacute;n. Es facil de usar y de entender. Tiene audio para todos los libros del nuevo testamento.
078681859X|4.0|The first book was pretty good, but I got really tired of reading the little quotes from bartimaeus on every page....  Don't waste your time reading all three though.  By the last one I hated the book....and the ending!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I had been waiting for Subways Surfers to come on to Amazon and finally it's here! It's my new favorite app! It is so addicting! I would recommend this to everyone I know.
1439130833|5.0|This is a very inspiring book for any person.  It makes you believe you can do anything and be successful!! It can help you see the way you think causes your life to be what it is!  I love this book and have ready it over and over
B00007KWI9|4.0|I love this album (as in 1971 vinyl). The songs are great. The ideas fresh. The personnel, my idea of perfect (for Yes). As far as their covers go Every Little Thing has never been topped. Their own compositions were never equaled. Nothing else in their catalog sounds like or tries to go where this first out of the gate recording traveled.    This newly remastered and expanded CD holds the potential for more of a good thing. But it is going to take more than just more to best a personal best on their first set of recordings. While Yes never really sounded like this again, I am glad that they attempted to travel the spaceways, rather than plowing the same field with diminishing returns.    So obtain a copy of their freshman offering and enjoy it for what it is: incredible and very creditable.
B000FC13E0|5.0|It has been a long time since I picked up a Michael Crichton book and this one is fantastic!!!!  It kept me reading into the long hours each night.  I recommend it to anyone!!  Interesting concepts....but you have to like science to like this book.  Its very technical
B00A80SHFM|4.0|I am glad to have this, but I wish it had contained more of the key songs from the movie.
0060734191|5.0|This was the best series I have ever read!!!  I would recommend it to anyone who likes to read.  I still think about these books
B005Y423ZC|5.0|This was actually a replacement. Loved it do much I had to have another copy. Adele's best! I have watched it many times
0316743305|5.0|This book was FASCINATING!!  It makes me wish I could know what is being created now!  I just ate this book up!  Its scary to think of what our government can do and is doing...
B007REV4T8|2.0|I dont get the positive reviews.  This movie was awful.  Bond's bad logic: the bad guy has access to MI6's computers.  I'll take M to a remote location that is listed as my home in the MI6 computers, completely without backup, without any escape plan.  What is the worst that can happen?<br /><br />The lasting impact of this movie could have been better realized through a press release that said they were recasting Q and M.  The worst thing is that they've wasted the reboot.  The previous movies were focused on the Spectre like organization responsible for the events of Quantum and Casino Royale.  This movie marks a return to the stand alone bonds which characterized Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan.
B004MMEF30|2.0|I'm used to better quality mysteries.....just wanted to read a &#34;classic&#34; and I wasn't impressed.  It was worth reading, I suppose, but I won't read it again...
B003MC5AV2|3.0|I read this book for light entertainment which is what I got.  Although the plot is sometimes predictable, the protaganist is not.  Rather than become a hysterical teenage girl after being done wrong, she takes action (or inaction, however you see it).  If you like romance with a little twist, this one is for you.  It is an enjoyable read.
074356619X|5.0|This is a great book for anyone! It makes you believe you can do anything and be successful!!  It helps you realize the way you think is creating your very life.
0920668364|4.0|If you were read this as a child, this is a great gift for your mother to remind her of those sweet times when you were still her little baby
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think that minecraft is amazing because it is a world made of blocks and your made of blocks. you can craft stuff.
B00005O3VC|5.0|This is such a classic. I looked so many places before I found this on Amazon. I love having it on my pc 'cos there is nothing like Monty Python's humor and I never fail to fall into it an laugh like I'm watching it for the first time or I know every word by heart.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game! I play it all the time. I thought it was awesome when it changed from New York to Rio.
B002R5LKOQ|3.0|When Whitney Houston passed,I had to have this movie. I hate Costner's hair and the acting's not great(or good)and there are so many things wrong and predictable about this movie,but when I hear the song I just have to watch this movie. I never was a huge fan,but the song lives forever in this movie for me.If you love it,you have to own it.
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|I bought this mic to use while vlogging on my motorcycle. Hidden behind my cheek pads, I am clearly audible even at highway speeds when it's hard to hear myself without speaking loudly. The quality is great, plain and simple. There were multiple days where I accidentally left the switch 'On'. I'd always be afraid that I killed the battery, but I guess the power drain is non existant, as it never stopped working.<br /><br />Down side: The cord is very long, for me at least. I just cut it and spliced it shorter, no big deal if you apply some common sense and basic electrical knowledge (google-basic, not degree-basic, it's not hard! :P)
B004LWZW4M|5.0|I love owning these movies on Amazon. I feel guilty if I don't leave a review,but everyone's dif. I loved this movie and having it on my pc is so easy.There are times when a good movie is all I want.Got it!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I couldn't put it down. Gone Girl is a fun ride. Gillian Flynn has a clever way with words and the characters are believably developed, despite the dramatic plot and unexpected twists.
B005VC4FLW|5.0|One of my new forever favorite movies. I did not see this until there wasn't anything new and now I've seen it and I had to have it! Gosling is 'melting' gorgeous and I just became a huge fan of Steve Carell. This was so original to me and I love that. Any movie you can't guess the end no matter how close it is-is a keeper and I had to own it!
B000FC11JW|5.0|I was required to read this book for my Comparative Leadership class and I can't believe how much I actually enjoyed. Peter Drucker's writing style is very easy to follow and he makes a lot of great points. I especially love that he points out the fact than anyone can become and effective executive. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in becoming a better leader.
B001FD5KJM|5.0|Loved the movie and the easy downloading. I lose interest so fast on reg tv and no matter what service-there're times NOTHING  good is on.I love my fav movies on my pc.No commercials or buffering.love it!
B0095T3H2U|5.0|We watched this movie as a family movie and we really enjoy it. We all had a very good laught :)
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|Easy read, a little predictable. Could have been so much better. Needed more suspense and more edginess to it, definitely not a page turner.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This a very addicting app. I love the activates you play to earn coins and experience.  Hope they add more stuff to do though.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a really fun ! You run away from a police and surf on subways. Earn coins and you can buy new characters. It is one of my favorite games.
B00881VLCE|5.0|This game is great for wasting time. It's low key and relaxing with different levels (number of pieces) and offers free downloadable pictures.
1449410243|5.0|I've given this 3 times now, and each time has been a huge hit. Comedy aside, it also has some information that may be news to even life-long cat owners. If you're looking for a gift for a cat lover in your life, you can't go wrong with this.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|Doesn't load well, and doesn't respond at all with farmville even with WII FI. Does ok with just facebook though.
0553382179|5.0|This is a great book for those of us who get overwhelmed by all that needs to be done in our homes.  Flylady encourages us and loves us for even the &#34;baby steps&#34; we take.  Flylady talked  me through &#34;HomeBlessing Hour&#34; with her podcast! It was great to have her cheer me on while I cleaned up my house in an hour! She's the best support for anyone who needs to do housework and doesn't like to!
030758836X|5.0|I can usually figure out a book at least by the mid-way point; this book took me completely by surprise!  A good &#34;wow&#34;  book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love this can  my kids have a blast worth getting for a free app it's awesome have fun enjoy ur game
0486414124|4.0|I think I've read all or most of her works now.  While this one was a little more difficult to read because of the language, still very enjoyable.
0399536108|5.0|a must read. specially for teens and young adults. great insight with life changing lessons to enhance anyones lives. thanks to Chris
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I loved the movie, and the book was also good. it's too awesome for words. thank you for your time.

B0070XB0N6|4.0|This book was very good, and I enjoyed it. However, at some points it gave me the creeps and the chills.........

B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I have 21 pets on the game. Seriously, it's really fun. I really recommend it to every girl!<br /><br />  - Lily
B00136JPB0|5.0|An amazing album by a very talented man.  Sorry he did not live long.  I'm sure there was a lot of music that might have been.<br /><br />I love music and lyrics that delve deeply into the heart and soul, as these songs do so well.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Fun game. I particularly like the missions, it gives a point to the game which could become repetitive if you didn't have some sort of target.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|If you are just getting into the walking dead this second season is a must. New characters are added and lots of stuff happening. 3 disc set with lots of extras, deleted scenes etc. You get your moneys worth.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|A very simple calculator that is easy to operate and  big enough to see. Gets the job done and is easy to use.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I loved the book all the way through until the ending.  The ending was just plain dumb.  I'm giving it 3 stars for the great story and loved the twist of the psycho wife.  Taking 2 stars off for the crappy ending.
B004LWZWGA|1.0|As Batman movies go, this series is too dark and too difficult to get into.  In fact, I've only seen approximately the first twenty minutes of each film before I turned them off because of sheer boredom.  I simply found them completely uninteresting.  Give me back the 1940's serials, or at least the 1966 film.  Prime examples of why I haven't been to the movies in ten years.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's amazing game to play and in like the way they design. Only thing it scared me was that when the  little boy got hit by a train an  it jump over on my screen like he I  going to hit me in real life.I like that idea and keep it more exciting!
B006546EPA|5.0|This is a wonderful collection of Strauss' music, particularly the tone poems.  The recordings are still fresh and crisp, and well reproduced on CD.  I am not a musician, but I highly recommend this set.
B009F7OQ5Y|5.0|I had a hard time finding this doll. I really want it for her birthday. She loved it. I was all I expected.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|How to grow from a boy to a man in a very short period of time. I wish I had read this when I was younger. I wouldn't have gone seeking treasure like the story, but maybe I'd have found treasures closer to home.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|I don't like this, the demo is too short of time to decide if I like it. I could  not do any thing except build a house and blow stuff up in creative mode.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I was not really a fan of Steven King but this book is amazing. It captured my attention the entire time and I would recommend it to anyone. New look at time-travel and great character development. Easy to follow and makes you want to keep turning the digital page. Get it.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is simply amazing, it is really hard but I have gotten really far on it. (I am 13 btw) Did I mention this game is amazing? After you play this play the second one.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|Love this show! I'm not sure who to trust.  Agent Westin is probably part of the cult. There are some really wicked characters. Looking forward to watching more episodes.
B00B0U2SEA|5.0|The whirlpool filters are very good. The utility blades that were advertised were not the ones sent , They were probably hoping I would accept the lower grade blades. I worked with the extra heavy duty blades for many years in a paper mill , I know the differences.Taken 2 is an excellent adventure movie and Liam Neesan is a great actor , in Schinder's List Liam 's performance was excellent.The MSR ski poles had an issue with the bottom stem breaking free while trying to put on the cone. Summit was excelent in sending out a new pair without a charge.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best game I have ever played my children love it. It is also hilarolious when the charecters hit the train my children have learner there multiplication so what will be there treat there treat is playing subway suffers this game is a life sager I am going to tell everyone about it
B00A9T1HUO|4.0|Much better CD than his last one and I have enjoyed listening to it since I received it.  I was suprised that he included \\"She Moved Through the Fair\\", this has been a favorite of mine for a long time and he did a great job on it. I would recommend this CD to any Josh Groban fan or a new one. He does have an amazing voice and if you were slightly disappointed in his last CD, I think you will enjoy this one. Not as much energy as some of his earlier works, but still worth getting.
B009VSW15Y|4.0|I like the service it is friendly.  However, I have had several incidences that I had the service crash at unorportune times while working were I have required photos to be taken.<br />With this in mind it is somewhat difficult for me to recommend to friends and family.
B007THA4FI|3.0|I did not read the other J.K. Rowling books.  She has great command of the written word and that is reason enough to read her.  This work, my humble opinion, is nearly devoid of a functional character.  It takes away, for me, from what otherwise has the making of a great story well told.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|great,great,great.  Will recomend to friens and family.  For years I have enjoyed the ease of google search and plan to try google chrome.
B000068TPN|4.0|One of the best movies I ever owned, Mel Gibson was fantastic in this exciting film about Americas first in counter in the Viet Nam conflict. I have replaced it twice.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Having the job as limo driver I find the use of the weather channel great... I helps me prepare for mornings afternoons and evenings out in the elements.  I will recommend to friendas and family.  The visiuals are fun no matter what the weather maybe.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|11/22/63 (the date of JFK's assassination) is primarily a story about time travel, but with a bit of a unique take on it; the time portal in question always opens to the same specific date and time in the past, and every trip back results in a reset from all previous trips. Oh, and when you return, exactly two minutes have passed back where you came from, regardless of how long you spent in the past. The year in question is 1958, and when our protagonist learns that things can be changed, a decision is made to make the biggest change one can reasonably expect in such a time window: preventing the assassination of JFK. Only that means spending five years in the past, and also, as it turns out, the past apparently is resistant to change, in the magnitude of how big that change is. There's also strange elements concerning a drunk near the time portal who appears to act differently each visit, even though most people act the same, and some strange recurring themes that seem to keep playing out in the life in the past.<br /><br />Strangely enough, for a large segment of the story it stops being about time travel, or Kennedy's assassination, and just becomes about our traveler's life in the past, and how he actually begins to like living there, to the point where he actually seriously contemplates staying there. A big segment of this story is actually an unexpected love story. I was not expecting this, but it is actually quite charming and enjoyable, and I found it one of the most enjoyable parts of the tale, surprisingly enough.<br /><br />I am no historian, so I don't know how much of what King presents is historically accurate and how much is fabrication. I also ended up enjoying the parts where he stalks Oswald to be less interesting than the rest of the book, but that might just be my lack of historical background (I tend to be more into science fiction and the like then say, history). Nevertheless, it still kept me on my toes and eager to read more, and it might doeven more for someone who is into such a thing.<br /><br />Ultimately, King shows that he is a great storyteller, as I'm sure many already know. This isn't horror, but it does have it's suspenseful moments, and is still well crafted. I wasn't able to predict exactly how it would all end up, and it was a bittersweet, satisfying ending. It certainly kept me engaged all the way through, even through the slower parts. Well worth a read if you get a chance.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Graphic and very detailed, but purely amazing! Grey is such a prize, even to the real world women! I do understand why people say it's similar to twilight
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This is a really fun game with new features like a zip line &amp; mining cart. The only down side is that the upgrades cost a LOT of coins...to purchase coins is really expensive, but once you earn enough coins playing the game to get features like double or triple coins you can get coins faster in the game &amp; buy more upgrades for free with the coins you got while you played.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I should have read the reviews before buying this book. The ending was a joke. Wish I could get a refund. Don't waste your time.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read in a long time.  It is actually the second time I have read it!  I watched the first movie and decided to read the series again.  I would recommend this book to readers of all ages.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game it is so much fun I think it is easier than the first one but if you think the first one is hard you might think this one is easy for me it was I love this I recommend that you give it a try.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|This is an &#34;under the radar&#34;  brilliant piece of writing. Such clever character development and plot twists. Emotions are described so vividly individually and within the many relationships, that I could not put it down. I highly recommend Matthew Quick and The SilverLining Playbook. Great ending!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Never want the stories to end....maybe a prequel ?  So nice to read clean stories for a change . Thanks
B008476HBM|5.0|Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice gets better with each read because there are so many hidden character traits and character development that you can't possibly catch in one read. Everyone should read at the very least Pride and Prejudice!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Dowton Abbey continues to be a great show.  I cant wait for the next season to be released.  5 stars
B0084AXZK0|4.0|Loved it as a kid, but superficial and predictable. A fun and enjoyable First read. Dorian Gray does represent the reality of the British Aristocracy of old and how useless their lives really were for many.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|It is addictive.  The early levels keep you engrossed, and later on, the big prizes are timed to spawn every 30 minutes of play time, guaranteeing that you keep going.
B0076DELIG|3.0|I have read all of Connelly's novels, and The Black Box is a great read. Harry Bosch is a great central character with depth and reality. He is close to retirement so maybe a character added who he trains.<br /><br />Would like Connelly to shake it up a bit, possibly adding characters and new locations. Born and raised in L.A. myself,I 'd like to see Harry being asked to assist the Mossed or another Foreign Agency and  called overseas to solve an International crime....leaning towards Ludlum just a bit!
B0086700CM|5.0|Game play varies each time. I really like the graphics. Interesting power -ups. Game is fast paced and you need both hands to play it.
0030565812|5.0|Below are ten excerpts that I found particularly insightful from  Long Walk to Freedom by Nelson Mandela - a truly spectacular story of one of the greatest men of the century!<br /><br />1- \\"As a leader, I have always followed the principles I first saw demonstrated by the regent at the Great Place. I have always endeavored to listen to what each and every person in a discussion had to say before venturing my own opinion. Oftentimes, my own opinion will simply represent a consensus of what I heard in the discussion. I always remember the regent's axiom: a leader, he said, is like a shepherd. He stays behind the flock, letting the most nimble go out ahead, whereupon the others follow, not realizing that all along they are being directed from behind.\\"<br /><br />2- \\"...I learned from Gaur that a degree was not in itself a guarantee of leadership and that it meant nothing unless one went out into the community to prove oneself.\\"<br /><br />3- \\"Non-violent passive resistance is effective as long as your opposition adheres to the same rules that you do. But if a peaceful protest is met with violence, its efficacy is at an end. For me, nonviolence was not a moral principle but a strategy; there is no moral goodness in using an ineffective weapon.\\"<br /><br />4- \\"Although I read a variety of newspapers from around the country, newspapers are  only a poor shadow of reality; their information is important to a freedom fighter not because it reveals the truth, but because it discloses the biases and perceptions of both those who produce the paper and those who read it.\\"<br /><br />5- \\"Prison not only robs you of your freedom, it attempts to take away your identity. Everyone wears the same uniform, eats the same food, follows the same schedule. It is by definition a purely authoritarian state that tolerates no independence or individuality. As a freedom fighter and as a man, one must fight against the prison's attempt to rob one of these qualities.\\"<br /><br />6- \\"Prison was a kind of crucible that tested a man's character. Some men, under the pressure of incarceration, showed true mettle, while others revealed themselves as less than what they had appeared to be.\\"<br /><br />7- \\"In some ways, I saw the garden as a metaphor for certain aspects of my life. A leader must also tend his garden; he, too, plants seeds, and then watches, cultivates, and harvests the result. Like the gardener, a leader must take responsibility for what he cultivates; he must mind his work, try to repel enemies, preserve what can be preserved, and eliminate what cannot succeed.\\"<br /><br />8- \\"There are times when a leader must move out ahead of the flock, go off in a new direction, confident that he is leading his people the right way.\\"<br /><br />9- \\"It is relatively simple proposition to keep a movement together when you are fighting against a common enemy. But creating a policy when the enemy is across the negotiating table is another manner altogether.\\"<br /><br />10- \\"I knew as well as I knew anything that the oppressor must be liberated just as surely as the oppressed. A man who takes away another's man freedom is a prisoner of hatred, he is locked behind the bars of prejudice and narrow-mindedness. I am not truly free when my freedom is taken from me. The oppressed and the oppressor alike are robbed of their humanity.\\"kind of crucible that tested a man's character.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|Hi guys your kindle fires are not good because my works perfectly so my work maybe it's the memory. Well, I give it 5 stars
B009LGO88E|5.0|This is everything I hoped for in the CPP for the 3DS XL.<br /><br />It grips the console *VERY* securely, so you do not have to worry about it when you play.<br /><br />Games that support the Circle Pad Pro are pretty easy to configure, and this really makes those games play much nicer. It is not too heavy, does not add too much size, and has a pretty nice ergonomic style molding which feels good in the hands.
B007KCG7MQ|5.0|He sings my spirit as a 62 year old musician as I am. My father was a jazz guitarist. I listened to Joe and went through all the things he went through. It is a cathersis.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Game is a lot of fun.  Graphics are great.  My 17 yr old and 4 yr old sons also love it!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I didn't like Temple run 1 AT ALL, but I decided to give two a try, and I liked it from the beginning. the graphics and sound effects are great. If you like to increase...that part of your brain that makes you think faster....you should get this app.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Very entertaining game! Would have rated 5 stars except for one major flaw... If you're going to have everything (minus the barest handful of items) cost diamonds, you either need to give more for challenges or make them A LOT cheaper!!! Otherwise make more items available for a reasonable amount of coins.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|The Perks of Being a Wallflower was such a moving and emotional book. It was very creative of Stephen Chbosky to write this story through a diary's perspective which gave it a more personal feel. The development of Charlie was truly amazing! His thought processes that were described in the story really reflected the problems he was facing but he learned to accept his imperfections thanks to Sam and Patrick. This story was emotionally stunning and I would highly recommend it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is the best this is a real review its truly the best. the graphics. are awesome also. defiantly get this app
B008476HBM|5.0|I know, almost everyone has read the book, but in case people are looking for a free book and haven't read this one and are considering it, READ IT!!! It's amazing! Jane Austin captures your heartstrings and never lets go. Still swooning.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is great and very addicting when I go to school this is all I hear about! Truley amazing keeps you on your toe a in my opinion! Even my mom loves it we play it everyday!!!! I REALLY RECOMMEND! (:
0374275637|5.0|Over twenty years ago, I dozed while a PBS special on psychology played in the background.  On came Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, interviewed by Phillip Zimbardo.  What they were saying about heuristics and cognitive bias was so intriguing that I shot up out of bed and watched rapt. I ordered that episode and still have it...on VHS!<br />Needless to say, I have been following Kahneman for years.  He is the epitome of smart and curious, pursuing the dark gaps of thinking as diligently as Costeau explored ocean trenches.  Because of my familiarity, a lot of the experiments in the book I had already read about several times.  But, there was so much more added.  Moreover, this book is the ultimate compendium of the knowledge that exists out there.<br />It is not a position paper or platform for his p.o.v.  To the contrary, he is inclusive of everyone's work, especially Stanovich's model of System 1 and System 2 which so neatly explains all the work he and Amos and everyone else has done. He is so intellectually generous and his obvious love for his late collaborator, Amos Tversky, makes this book a gift of character and heart above the groundbreaking understanding he conveys.<br />Yes, I would love to have a coffee with Daniel Kahneman.
1608862801|5.0|My son is studying sequential art at Savannah College of Art and Design.  They all watch this series so having it in book form is great,
B004T6IBNY|2.0|I love pinball and have been playing it since I was a child. This game is probably ok for the average player but it is too small and unresponsive for an advanced player. I don't recommend it.
B003JTHXOK|1.0|I just finished reading the book and I'm just so disappointed. The story started well. It grabbed my interest, but as I continued on it became so predictable. I felt Alex's character was so underdeveloped as well as monotonous! I just think his character wasn't developed enough. I mean, he was a detective in the military, why couldn't the author elaborate more in that area? And finally Katie pisses him off and Alex walks away? That's it??? No argument? No drama? I mean, Katie said some hurtful words, and nothing? BOR-ing! Oh I forgive you, let's get back together again. {{{snore}}}<br /><br />And really, the ending...what the...??? &#34;Jo&#34;? The author really threw me off on a loop. The ending made no sense whatsoever!!! I wouldn't bother recommending this story to anyone. I just hope that the movie has a better ending.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is truly a breathtakingly funny and beautifully sad book. cried and laughed at the same time. Thank you John Green for The Fault in Our Stars.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Loved this book. Have not been happy with any other book since reading this one. How can you beat this kind of love. Nice job Jamie McGuire.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|Josh Groban co-wrote 7 of the 12 tracks on this album and they are all quite wonderful! He adds a bit of jazz and the popular Laura Pausini to the mix. I could actually dance the chacha with Un Alma Mas. You won't be disappointed in this album! It is beautifully done.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|We play this game everyday and my 4 year old LOVES it. Its amazing what these little minds can do! It really teaches her to look at what's going on and how to actually figure things out if it doesn't work the first time. Its good at teaching her those fine motor skills too. Awesome game!
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|This is a story that draws you in, first with recognition and a good dose of humor, then with an irresistable plot, that has you at the tip of your chair. And it has illustrations, in fact, the story is based on them, giving a story a very special twist. Peculiar, almost. Must read!
B005HSL626|5.0|My 4 year old gets such a kick out of this game. She loves it! Its easy enough for her to understand but challenging enough that she doesn't get bored too quickly. It also keeps me entertained for a bit sometimes too.
B00A1XOPE8|4.0|This is a novel, and nothing like the usual size of Mr. Sanderson's work. This is of some note, since the world he has constructed in this novel, is complicated enough to build an entire series upon. Reading the first chapters, I felt a little insecure whether I hadn't missed the prequel to this story!<br />Having said this, I do love the setting, I love the characters and I do hope someday THIS work will turn out to be a prequel to something truely grand.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it!!! Even compared to Temple Run I would pick this game!!! Its more.....playful!!!!! I enjoy this game, I play it everywhere, at home, in the car ect. I really recommend this game.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game was great.  I recommend trying the free  version, then get the full game,. Kept me busy for hours.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Just as much fun as the original. Much more of a challenge which makes it a lot more fun. It is amazing.
B006LSZECO|2.0|It completely blows my mind that people have actually given this book four and five star reviews. I gave it two stars<br />because it had good bones. I was captivated and excited from the beginning, then was disappointed about halfway through. Hope was restored in the third quarter and then slowly declined right through to the horrible, sloppy, awful, maddening end. I finished this book yesterday and am still actually angry about the way it ended. A perfectly<br />great novel, totally ruined by not just an unhappy ending,  but a flat out bad one.
B007BFSYMS|4.0|Adjusting to my husband going on away on a two week rotation was causing me to lose sleep. After using this app it is a big help in relaxing me to go to sleep with him away. I like the various sounds and the wake up alarms.So far I am liking ocean waves, stream,and boat. Thanks!
B005H0CBZ0|3.0|Having really enjoyed Cross stitch and Dragonfly in Amber I found myself having a bit of a struggle this time. The couple's adventures are becoming, for me, more and more unreal.  On the other hand, Gabaldon writes very well and I was kept going to the end by her vivid description and frequently funny dialogue. I thought it was time to let the couple go in peace.....
B0060D2WYI|4.0|I found this movie to have taken great liberties with the books they jammed together to make this from. Some of the most interesting aspects of the stories were hacked, changed, abridged, or ignored to make it. I understand that time and tech prevented a lot of execution. Faruza and the incomparable Jean Marsh are the only reasons I rated this as high as I did. I think it should be remade. If you are the hard core fan of L Frank Baum, be prepared to pick this apart. If you just like Oz? You'll be entertained with no clue of what is missing. My niece was disturbed by the images of Dorothy in the what basically amounted to an insane asylum , which is NOT part of any Oz story. They almost gave her shock therapy! Inappropriate visual for children and anyone born after 1970. If you want to subject your younger children to imagery such as this? Feel free.I've read every one of the Oz books and I know what I'm talking about. Have you? This movie is PG-13 as far as I am concerned.  The whole aspect of how Dorothy ends up in Oz is completely forgone to go with the insane asylum idea. Much of the story about how they got to the Gnome King is missing. There were even other enchanted people to find as knick-knacks that are never mentioned. In summary. Read the books! More story and entertainment for your dollar. This isn't high school people. Grow up. Just because you liked a movie and its a childhood favorite doesn't mean it was CORRECT in following the story, nor that it's the Bible of the genre. Rating reviews poorly just because your fluffy bunny got run over? Immature at 8 or 80.
B00122KW0I|5.0|It's an AMAZING soundtrack!! What I especially like about is the extra tracks from the extended edition of the movie.
B004SRPXWQ|1.0|Sorry I waisted my time on this. Very lame and they try to get you to purchase more silly stuff.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Can't wait for the next one<br />How long will it be? I wonder which of the Starks dies next. Seems like the girls survive
B0001W1BWS|4.0|I enjoyed the film.  I am a big Michael Pare fan.  I believe he is an underrated actor. I can't understand why he didnt get more recognition.
B004I654WQ|5.0|My 3 year old grandson and 4 1/2 year old granddaughter both love this.  One for the home and one for the car.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is very addicting.But it is way more challenging than the first game. It is a really cool game. If you liked the first temple run you will like temple run2.
B00005JMXX|5.0|Wear a heavy sweater when you watch this DVD.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Amazing awsome wonderful fun addicting however we are amazed at how awesome this game is I Will never forget it IT is cool and I'll try to see if I can also get everyone else to play this it's so easy and fun and I'll try to beat the my high scores
B0002TJGQS|5.0|Great price and beats having to get in my car and go out and buy them.  I will go back to these guys in the future.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Once again, I couldn't put it down.  Makes you wonder if this is really possible, and if so, is it happening right now.
1595826971|5.0|I am a big fan of the original Alice game by American McGee. It was a dark and gritty interactive depiction of Wonderland and it's o so many weird inhabitants. Even back in the days when the Quake 3 engine was still at large, the game's art design was exceptional with mind boggling level design, colourful environments and very organic structures. Alice: Madness Returns tried to recreate these wonders for the current generation of consoles. In my opinion the game itself was not nearly as fun as the original game, yet still good in its own right. However the art design was once again the star of the show and I was pleased to see that Dark Horse Books was also going to release an art book for the game... and what an art book this is!<br /><br />The Art of Alice: Madness Returns features a hard cover binding and its 184 pages are of very high quality. The book feels and looks phenomenal. The Art of Alice: Madness Returns features six distinct chapters and an introduction written by American McGee himself. The art presented in this book ranges from pre-production drawings, to high fidelity environment images (London and Wonderland), character concepts (literally every single character from the game seems to be in this book!), world object design and so much more. Small descriptions beneath some of the artworks will explain the things you'll see, which is a good thing and something I really missed in art books from Blizzard entertainment.<br /><br />The art in the book can be best described as Wonderland meets HP Lovecraft meets MC Escher. There are so many weird contraptions, impossible structures and otherworldly creatures to be witnessed in this book, that your mind will be blown halfway through the pages.<br /><br />Please, make no mistake. This book as well as the game itself is by no means anything you should show your kids. The images in this art book can be very aggressive, gross and - in layman's terms - generally eff'ed up. Even the cover itself may be enough to invoke nightmares in a child for weeks to come.<br /><br />The Art of Alice: Madness Returns has got to be the best art book in my collection as of now. You can still get this phenomenal book via Amazon for a very good price. I can't praise this book enough. Go get it now.<br /><br />For more Reviews like this, visit my personal homepage (check out my profile for the link) where I review video game art books.invoke nightmares in a child for weeks to come.<br /><br />The Art of Alice: Madness Returns has got to be the best art book in my collection as of now.

B00BB8SKPW|5.0|Great movie and if  you're nervous about it being about a plane crash, although that scene is incredible, the story after is what makes this film amazing.  Take the time to see it and Denzel, if you ever see this, thank you!
1781163243|5.0|Halo has been around for quite some time now. I still remember seeing the first Halo trailer, when it was planned to be a Mac game... Yes, it's been a while and Halo has come to be one of the biggest console franchises ever since. One thing all Halo games (and movies, books etc...) have in common is the spectacular, well crafted sci-fi universe they are set in.<br /><br />Halo 4 set out on a mission similar to that of the first Halo game: Halo 4 is an adventure, deep into an unkown world, uncharted by mankind, so alien yet so beautiful in display, that you can only admire its presentation.<br /><br />The accompanying hardcover art book Awekening: The Art of Halo 4 has 192 pages and features 5 chapters: Environments, UNSC, Covenant, Forerunner and War Games. Each chapter speaks for itself, the later (War Games) is dedicated to the game's multiplayer environments and war assets. The book depicts a wide variety of art fidelity, ranging from scribbles and scetches to beautiful full feature drawings, I'd seriously consider to put them on my wall, if I had the space. Almost every page has a few lines of explanation. Only few pieces of art have some kind of caption to it, other than the artists name - but credit where credit is due!<br /><br />Just like the game, Awakening: The Art of Halo 4 takes you on an adventure to another world, only to make you realize how a dedicated game development art team, can craft a visionary experience, almost hard to believe it's all fiction. You should definately get this book if you are a Halo fan and it's a must have for all art book fans.<br /><br />For more Reviews like this, visit my personal homepage (check out my profile for the link) where I review video game art books.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|This case is everything i hoped it would be. It is very versatile and puts the kindle to sleep when it is closed. All in all it was a great buy.
1595827684|4.0|So the Mass Effect series is massive. You get that form the name and you definitely get that from playing the game. There is just so much to the Mass Effect universe that you can't grasp everything in one - or can you?<br />The Art of the Mass Effect Universe definitely tries to give an extensive insight on the art about the critically acclaimed role-playing titles from Bioware. The hardcover book has 184 pages packed full of art from Mass Effect to Mass Effect 2 and Mass Effect 3. Just like The Art of Alice: Madness Returns this book from Dark Horse is very high in quality: Thick glossy pages, a nice format and a wide variety of artworks, from scribbles to drawings, 3D models and so much more. You will definitely get your Mass Effect art fix from this book. I really love the scribbles for all the different alien races. Especially the Turian faces and Elcor body scribbles had me laughing out loud. Trust me, there are some hilarious concepts in this book.<br /><br />You will find at least one artwork for `almost' every location from all three games, as well as character designs and many sci-fi structure and object works. This book is a sci-fi-art fan's dream come true.<br />If there's one gripe I have this book is that it's just not enough. Yes, I think The Art of the Mass Effect Universe could and should have easily been double the size to really give the game's vast universe justice. Again, there's nothing on user interface design and no word on prototype development and very early concepts. Something I am always interested in.<br /><br />As it stands The Art of The Mass Effect Universe is a beautiful art book, you can easily snatch for a very good price. And if you're a fan of the games you should consider this book for all the additional insights into the game world as well.<br /><br />I also own the so much smaller The Art of Mass Effect 3 art book which comes with the Mass Effect 3 Collector's Edition. This book however is more like an excerpt from the full feature The Art of the Mass Effect Universe book. You will not find additional art in this small sized book, so you might want to pass this one.<br /><br />For more Reviews like this, visit my personal homepage (check out my profile for the link) where I review video game art books.ture The Art of the Mass Effect Universe book.

0470876417|5.0|What a great book to have, even after I read it I still look back to it for references. I often give it to co-workers to read up on the topic. I have a few close friends who have bought the book for their reference. Great for beginners and up.
1926778103|5.0|Darksiders the game can be best described as The Legend of Zelda meets Diablo. Gameplay is king and Darksiders delivers in that regard; But it also delivers in terms aesthetics. This game is oozing style and when I had the chance to buy the accompanying art book: I jumped on it. And so should you.<br /><br />The Art of Darksiders would be the pinnacle of artbooks if it wasn't for the cheap paperback binding they went for. This thing is massive, packed full with the biggest variety in art you will find in any video game art book to date. There are sketches, scribbles, drawings, 3D renders, concepts, storyboards, beautiful promotional illustrations and so much more all throughout a whooping 288 pages! That's almost 300 pages of some of the best art you will find in the industry.<br /><br />The Art of Darksiders features 10 chapters: Illustrations, Characters, Creatures, Bosses, Environments, Weapons, Artifacts, Icons, CG Gallery and Key Visuals. As you can see there is a ton of variety when it comes to content and I just love some of the dark, twisted, hellish things you'll see in this bad boy. As it stands - in terms of content - this book is an ultimate beast. Needless to say, I am already looking forward to The Art of Darksiders 2.<br /><br />For more Reviews like this, visit my personal homepage (check out my profile for the link) where I review video game art books.
B006LSZECO|5.0|As many twists and turns as a corkscrew.  Turns out these two were made for each other!  I would  definitely recommend &#34;Gone Girl&#34; .
B000FIMG68|5.0|Ordered as a Christmas Gift.  Amazon price far below store price and my husband will continue to enjoy each season as I plan to continue purchasing succeeding DVDs for him every Christmas.
0345803485|4.0|Okay this isn't a bad review, just a critical one. I love the book only because well it's a guilty pleasure to be honest. It's not the best written book out there and frankly the author for some reason uses the same phrases to describe everything. According to the book Anastasia the main character; blushes, flushes, gasps, says \\"holy s***, holy cow\\" and her breath hitches and her blood sears in her veins...I'm sure a seasoned author could probably have found more words to describe different feelings and emotions in the book. Other than that annoyance the book is still basically a fantasy, nothing more.<br /><br />If you're looking for the next great american novel, look elsewhere. This is a guilty pleasure nothing more. If you can accept that, then you will enjoy the book. Oh and if you've read twilight you will notice the overwhelming similarities which is also annoying as far as originality goes. *shrug* I still liked it tho, maybe because i didn't expect much.<br /><br />P.s. The main hottie, Christian Grey could be bi-polar....just read it you'll see. :P
B00B2V66VS|1.0|u guys must have the good cause it stopped working on like the fifth sixth day so I give it a bid fat zero star just know that when u see a one star.I hare it very much so don't get all the people under me say it good cause they got paid to say it was good just ask.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Lo tiene todo: acci&oacute;n, aventura,romance. Mantiene el inter&eacute;s del lector de principio a fin. Lo recomiendo adolescentes y adultos. Muy emocionante.
B0076DELIG|4.0|You gotta love Harry's persistance. Being the first on a murder then twenty years later being the guy who solved it.
B004DSX5B6|4.0|Easy to use and get at the tools. I like it that they are on the outside and they seem and look solid. I still have the old habit of reaching for my swiss army knife but I am glad the multi tool is there if I need it.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|what a terrific movie!  I have always loved Denzel Washington and he is wonderful in this movie. Addiction and denial always go hand in hand until you are willing to admit you have a problem.<br /><br />Sometimes it takes several negative events before a person hits bottom and decides to get help.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B008BGNMZU|2.0|Did not listen to the CD. I received it with a broken case; very poor shipment packaging. I'll probably reorder in the future.
B00280LYIM|5.0|I love this book series. Reading about the Greek Gods are fantastic. I can't wait to finish it! Thank You!
1451695195|5.0|Thank you for sharing your story with us.  This is a true story of a highly skilled scientist leaving his brain consciousness to travel in what we call 'heaven'. His account is very compelling, and we're lucky to have it.  Personally, as a graduate student of theology, I found that what he says also happens to be very consistent with what I learned in graduate school from heavy-hitting theologians including Thomas Aquinas and (more recently) Elizabeth Johnson.  It's as if he sat in on these doctoral courses and heard the language mystical theologians throughout the ages have used to describe G-D.... To say that God is \\"unconditional love' is true, but then again, it seems so trite in comparison to the FEELING of Absolute love and acceptance these people received in these experiences. As Alexander points out, this love is CONCRETE, and these experiences of love and compassion means we all need to generate love and compassion for others... to be more like our Creator.<br /><br />Thank you Dr. for showing us, once again, that G-D is FULLY PERSONAL, and that religion and science can co-exist without tension.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I was so sad to see this book series end. I was enjoying reading it so much, I was honestly unsure about this series, but by this point. I was amazing!! Thank you so much!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this show, I just started watching it a few months ago and I can't get enough. I would recommend this show to anyone.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I got into this series after I saw the movie the first time. But it usually isn't my style to watch the movie first, but in this case I made an exception. It is a great series.
B0091THDOM|5.0|This product has turned out to be great. I can carry my iPhone in my pocket without worrying that it will get scratched.  I have thoroughly enjoyed it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Part two of the book series was even better than the fist. This series was excellent and I loved every minute of it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Hey this is a great game. I love subway surfers. I also love how you can update it. I don't like how some people cost so much money. Subway surfers is a great game
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was unsure about this book when I got it for my Kindle. I was told that I needed to read it and that I would like, so I decided to give it a try. Once I got a couple of chapters into the book I was completely captivated by it. Thank you so much!
B004A8ZX2I|5.0|He is one of my favorite actors.  This movie's mystery and suspense is amazingly heart felt.<br />Highly recommend to family and friends.
B000MZHW4A|5.0|Great acting, great movie. Wish Leo won an Oscar for his role. It was awesome. I really loved Djimon's role as well.
B000UJ48UO|5.0|I seen this movie when it first came out in the movie cinemas. Very entertaining then and now. A must keep.<br />Highly recommend to family and friends.
B003KRJNBW|5.0|I thought some parts of this movie were a little drawn out, too slow and if you are a person who takes a long time to &#34;Get it&#34; then you will have to watch it twice. Its a great movie for someone who likes the bible, and God. I really enjoyed it in the movie theater and wanted to share it with someone but they didnt like it as much bc there were a lot of quiet parts where you have to concentrate hard to understand and that person fell asleep. LOL!! I loved it tho. And Love any and all of Denzel's movies :)
B004XDYJRU|1.0|not only won't the update work, the app itself is now unusable. this is ridiculous &amp; i  should be allowed to give this 0 stars! BAD APP
B007HACDLK|5.0|Very good read action packed, typical Mitch Rapp shoot em up interesting plot twist and worthy of 5 stars can't wait for the next Mitch Rapp novel no let down here!
B00B99KJR0|5.0|There are a lot of unpolished Match 3 games available, but this isn't one of them.  The graphics are nice, the gameplay is well-balanced, and the different levels offer unique challenges.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game ever since I started to play it . Very nice cool people and this is better then temple rum. So this is what I think
B004J4WKTW|5.0|For all who believe in magic ... this is a must read. Words cannot express as well as Morgenstern does.
B004FEFS5E|5.0|I think this is top of the line when you want to understand exposure. This was recommended in a class I took that used this as the model for the instruction. You will learn a lot and I felt like I finally started to get a grip on my camera and never have used auto on my camera since!
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Very challenging but very fun!!! I got stuck a few times but the help tips git me through. Worth the price and I'm now awaiting the next one...
B0042X9L6A|5.0|I bought this mainly because I am able to use it as a commander on my d5100. I am a budget conscience photographer so for the quality and price it's perfect!!
B000SGGUWS|5.0|It was a great book I loved the drama. I wonder who A is. I wonder if it is Jenna and her brother
B000HX499S|5.0|Can watch this over and over! I actually bought this movie! It has always been a favorite - now I can watch it whenever on my Kindle HD!
B00003CXXJ|5.0|Thank you for your promptness and we enjoyed it very much. We realize it's a childrens movie but we adults like things too.<br />Thanks<br />myrt
B003JTHXOK|3.0|I thoroughly enjoyed Safe Haven.  It kept my interest all the way through, but like a lot of Nicholas Sparks books, they are are somewhat predicable.  But having said this, I could easily recommend this book.  it is a quick read and very enjoyable.
B00AA8Q0FQ|5.0|I have to admit, I was pleasantly surprised by this DVD combo.  I really wanted to like the movie Monster High Ghouls Rule, but was kinda disappointed.  These two movies hit it right at the top. The characters are more refined, the plots are better, and the music is nice and very catchy. Yep, I liked this one.
B005LAII62|5.0|My son and I love this movie. It's funny, a lil creepy but teaches a good lesson and that's great.
B007FJFDXS|3.0|Some of the puzzles are really good and challenging.  Some either not solvable or too difficult for my patience.  As a result I found some of the puzzles too frustrating.
B00ACB9Z3U|5.0|My husband and I are avid collectors of anything big bang and this was something that of course had to be added to the collection.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|I wanted to read this book before I watched the movie. I know that the movie wasn't necacaraly based off any of the books but I wanted to have some foresight anyway. Great read for you detective junkies (and fans of law and order).
B004UZGWL2|5.0|As described
B0084B1T8Y|4.0|This was a good book I would give it four stars it was okay for a book I liked the mongoose story.
B00000JNJ1|5.0|I remember Faces as the group that I always woundered 'Who is that playing Lead Guitar\\". Sure I know and like Rod's singing but The Guitar kept pulling me back to Faces as one of my favorates. Ronnie Wood is excellant on this CD. He plays the licks that keep your toe tapping and the blues that lets you close your eyes and just flow with the music. I highly recommend this to any blues fan you won't regret it.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This Gillian gal has a very clever writing style, kept my interest the whole time.  I was disappointed by the end of the story, I wanted revenge! but hell it's good reading!  I recommend it to anyone, in fact, I have a friend who just started 2 days ago and it's about to finish it!!! (we're sharing notes and it's so much fun hearing his theories throughout the reading! LOL).
B006AX6ONI|5.0|Wether you're in business or not (I'm not) this book is good for anyone. It's straight forward about how to live your life and do business in general. Really, really great advice, very clearly written. You feel like you get to know Mark Cuban a lot better and feel inspired to do big things. I learned a lot from this book! Get it!

B009NQKPUW|5.0|I love this movie and we keep catching more and more each time we watch. I got this for my husband who is also a Ridley Scott / Alien / Aliens fan (we love the first 2 Alien movies). The story is riveting and very nuanced, the cinematography stunning, and the visuals / special effects very dense (amazing, very detailed). We look forward to Ridley continuing the story into the next movie.

B002CQUCDK|1.0|I have seen all the versions of The Thirty-nine Steps and while this version is not the worst it is NOT the best. I believe everyone is blinded by the name of the director and cannot see this movie for what it truly is. Overacted is the only word that comes to mind for the performances, The directing is heavy-handed and too dramatic. It's another case of Hitchcock taking himself too seriously.

B002ZG9940|4.0|I'm glad so many people dislike this movie so much because it means I get to pick up this excellent film on Blu ray for 6 bucks at Amazon! Why so many people dislike it-I don't know. Maybe it's because some feel let down that this isn't a non stop action type espionage movie like the Bourne films (which are great in their own right). No, here you will not see Clooney shooting out any windows and then jumping through them. The pacing is slow, but persistently tense. The filmmakers and actors have managed to pull off an exciting espionage thriller without having to rely on the over-saturation of action sequences. Action sequences are only peppered about but are well done. What I thought was kind of cool was that it's a great character study, yet without a lot of character development... we don't know them, they're all kind of mysterious, yet we are interested in them, we're rooting for the lovers (the love story backdrop is very, very well done). The only familiar face in the movie is Clooney, I'm not a Ra Ra Clooney fanatic but let me tell you his acting here is superb. The performances of the entire supporting cast are also superb. The cinematography of the European locales is visually stunning. A really artfully done movie. Highly recommend.

B000HCO83Q|3.0|I saw this movie when it came out and kind of lost my mind.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Good movie, solid plot, nod to some characters and plotlines that comic fans would know, Hugh Jackman, entertaining twist with Mystique, has Beast in it, Leech was well thought out, reference to Juggernaut meme, etc<br /><br />Cons:<br />Some of the nods are horrid (Like Callisto. Seriously?! She deserves better.)<br />Jean Grey annoys me greatly as does Scott and this didn't do a lot to make them very sympathetic.<br />Nightcrawler is gone entirely and no one even bothers to comment on it the entire movie!<br />They have had a different actress for Kitty in EVERY movie! Ahhhh!<br />Pyro is lame to begin with so why did they make him so central? Go with Avalanche or even better go with Domino or someone actually worth the time and effort.<br />They turned the Morlocks into goths with tattoos which is seriously watering them down.<br />And so on.<br /><br />It isn't a bad movie and 90% of the reason I own it is because I love Beast but I was very angry at the way they jacked with the plot. Making Kurt super timid in X2 was bad enough!

030758836X|4.0|Always when a psychopath is revealed, that innocent spouse had no clue.  What happens when one lying psychopath meets and fools (and is fooled by) another lying psychopath?  These are two characters who have no true personality, and define themselves by what the other believes them to be, in the most positive light.  Yet what happens when they just get tired of it?<br /><br />What I didn't get was the desire of the wife to totally sabotage the husband when she was so empty of emotion.  That kind of planning takes energy and motivation and I just don't see her having that.

B0041KVW2K|3.0|I purchased this set for my boyfriend on Christmas.  We decided to listen to all the albums in order.  Every album sounded perfect.  No surface noise.  It was crystal clear.  Until, that is, we got to Rubber Soul.  The last song on the second side (Run For Your Life) skipped at the tail end of the last chorus.  He checked for scratches or debris and nothing could be seen.  He tried wiping it with a microfiber towel just in case but it still skipped.  &#34;No worries,&#34; I said.  &#34;We'll just exchange it for one out of a new box set and return the defective one to Amazon.&#34;  When the second box set arrived we skipped to the last chorus of &#34;Run For Your Life&#34; and listened to the replacement skip in exactly the same place.  When talking to Amazon (since we didn't want them to keep throwing box sets at us until we found one that worked) we asked if we could just swap out just the one album for a stand alone replacement instead of the entire box set.  They said they couldn't since it came in a set and that they'd be willing to refund our money but at the cost of sending the entire and fully working rest of the set back until they could fix the problem and even considered pulling the item. We weren't really willing to do that since all but one song sounded great.  So we decided &#34;Let's just look for Rubber Soul by itself.&#34;  It was sold out on every large online retailer and my suspicions were that everyone else was trying to do the same thing.  Finally we found an Urban Outfitters that had the record so we purchased it, brought it home, and sure enough it skipped as well.  I had all but lost hope going 0 for 3 before finally finding a working copy at a different Urban Outfitters.  The experience proved to me that yes there ARE good copies out there in order to complete your sets.  However, I should never have to buy the same item 4 times in order to do that.  Someone dropped the ball somewhere.  Had the second set worked fine I would have just chalked the first defective record up to the &#34;these things happen&#34; category.  But 3 different records should not have the same flaw.  Someone who runs the vinyl pressing company needs to reevaluate how quality control is done.  Unfortunately I haven't heard anyone complain about Rubber Soul but 3 records, 2 from box sets at Amazon and 1 stand alone from Urban Outfitters can't be an isolated incident.  I would have given this 5 stars if the second set's Rubber Soul worked but the fact that it and the first Urban Outfitters' album both shared the EXACT same problem is almost unforgivable.

0765325950|1.0|all along, the only thing that saved WoT from being total dreck was the world building; the wooden dialog with ultra repetitive cliches (I mean, how many times do we need to hear that Lan's gaze made rock seem soft) and the gaping holes in the plot (eg, Rand's forces knew about compulsion, had the foxhead amulets, yet did nothing to protect their generals..? not believable. )<br />Or, Matt is able to sneak about the palace of the Seanchan Empress without being detected ???<br />yet in this book, we have no world building, just a long, long , long dreary battle.<br />It is almost insulting to those of us who slogged thru 13 long, long, often dreary books...maybe the whole thing is a test to see how much abuse readers will take

0142420891|5.0|I have been struck low by this series. It's true. It started with when If I Stay snuck in like a thief in the night and reduced me to tears. I probably would have been perfectly happy to leave Mia and Adam as they were at the end of that book. But the reality of them three years later, the heartache and realizations they've both had to come to made their journey so much more poignant.<br /><br />One thing that struck me in book 1 was that Mia felt like a hanger-on at Adam's concerts. She enjoyed his music and she loved seeing him lose himself when he played but she never felt like she fit in. It's an admittedly little thing, but he went out of his way to support her and she tried but never quite embraced that side of him. I think Mia needed a chance to grow a little. The three years that have passed gave her time to face her grief and her pain. It gave her time to do a lot of things. Not all of them were good. But, then, the way she walked away from Adam also put him on a path, musically speaking, that gave him a chance to achieve something that he otherwise wouldn't have been able to achieve. She shattered him and he was able to take those little pieces of himself and turn it into something that touched others.<br /><br />Adam is a wreck. He's reached a point where the music that used to be his escape can't fill the emptiness inside him. His emotions and heartache bled across every page. It was hard reading it at times. It was hard to see him so manic and swamped by depression and fear. Then he sees Mia again and things get both a little bit better in that moment and a little bit worse.<br /><br />It's beautiful and terrible and heartbreaking all at once.<br /><br />This book brings the closure that both Mia and Adam needed. It wraps the two of them up together and forces them to face the things that have happened. It pulls them and pushes them and makes them stronger when they come out on the other side. Adam was so alive here, even when he was spiraling downward.His story deserved to be told and I'm so, SO glad I read it.<br /><br />-Kelly @ Reading the Paranormal
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I found the game to be easy enough to be a quick filler but challenging enough to keep my attention.
0345522478|5.0|Based on some of the things I'd heard about this series before I ever picked it up, I figured that it was going to be one that I'd end up enjoying in a big way. Let me just say, I wasn't wrong. The Celtic pantheon holds a special place in my heart (even when I can't pronounce half the names correctly) and this book took all the godly goodness and gave it an extra dose of badassery in the form of a two thousand year old Druid with some seriously formidable skills.<br /><br />Also, the lady gods appear to really like his boning skills. #JustSaying<br /><br />Let's take a look at Atticus, shall we? The dude is all sorts of awesome. He has tattoos that help him draw on the power of the earth. He fights dirty when he needs to. He loves his dog. He spends time with old ladies because he knows what it's like to outlive your friends and family. Awwwww. I LIKE this guy! His snark makes me laugh. And somehow SOMEHOW he manages to not piss of some seriously powerful gods who take offense at the most innocuous of things. He's the guy we all hope to be when we hit the two thousand year mark. Or maybe that's just me.<br /><br />I really, really got a kick out of every part of this book. From how all the werewolves hate Thor for his douchebaggery to Oberon's quest for sausages, it made me laugh. I'm a little sad that I don't have book 2 in my hands right this very minute.<br /><br />I guess I'll just have to channel Atticus and show a little patience. Well, either that or go cut someone in half with my badass enchanted sword. Oh, man. The possibilities are endless!<br /><br />-Kelly @ Reading the Paranormal

Michael Lewis gives all the facts on why the Oakland A's are so successful in baseball with ~$50M budget against teams spending 2-3 times as much. This book is not a glorification of the A's GM, Billy Beane but a complete dissection of the ways baseball teams must operate to compete successfully
0061655554|5.0|I work with small organizations who are considering big changes. Every so often, I run into a leader who gets all fired up about some idea that has little evidence to recommend it, and lots of uncertainty surrounding it. I almost always recommend that those people read \\"Barbarians at the Gate\\" before doing anything. And they almost never do, which is a shame.<br /><br />This book has a ton of great lessons for anyone in any kind of business, even if you are not working with megacorporations or on Wall Street. It has especially profound lessons about negotiation and knowing the quality of your information before you make a move. I don't want to recap the book here, but basically, back in the late 1980s, F. Ross Johnson, who was the CEO of RJR Nabisco, got bored and wanted to shake things up a little bit, and so decided to work with some bankers to do a leveraged buyout of his company. Johnson and his \\"management group\\" offered a stupidly ridiculous low price, purposely, because Johnson really liked corporate jets and company apartments and celebrity golf tournaments, and didn't want to have to run his company without them (what a bummer that would have been, right?). His beyond-lowball bid prompted several other companies (namely Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and First Boston) to enter into a bidding war for the company. Hilarity ensues.<br /><br />I pull this book down every couple of years or so and re-read it, mostly when I am in a situation where I know I, and whomever I am working with, have a protracted, difficult negotiation ahead of us. The bulk of the book is about negotiations of one kind or another. And basically, the lesson you can take away from the book is, the person who keeps control of themselves, the information, and their team is the person who ends up taking the day. My opinion: Kravis, whatever else people want to say about him, kept his eye on the prize and was able to stand fast when he felt strongly, make concessions when it was appropriate, and stay focused on the end goal, to get where he needed to go. Johnson was a lightweight who really didn't know what he wanted, other than his beloved corporate jets. If he could keep the company, and the jets, and a couple of billion dollars from the restructuring, wow, that would be dandy! If not, then, well - maybe he wasn't that interested anyway. Which brings up another lesson - in the book, the financiers working with Johnson sweat blood making the deal happen. Unfortunately, the central figure of the management company's deal - Johnson - was both less-than-committed to the mud-wrestling dirtiness of the LBO process, and incapable of convincing people he could run the company after the deal was done (because he wasn't). When people talk about this book as \\"a portrait of corporate greed,\\" it really is greed you have to read about to believe. The prospect of hundreds of millions of dollars of fees blinded the companies aiding the management group to the fact that not only was Johnson not ready to go to the mat to keep the company, he really wasn't interested in running the company unless he had his beloved package of perks to accompany his title. The best part is, he made that clear to everyone from the outset, and people ignored him! A good lesson for any consultant or potential partner considering working with someone on a big move. Before you commit to helping someone, make sure they are invested as much as, or preferably more than, you are when it comes to achieving the goal. And to quote Maya Angelou, when someone shows you who they are, believe them.<br /><br />There are other great tidbits in this book, more than I can list. There are lots of lessons for leaders about how not to act if you want people to support you when the chips are down. Johnson was completely tone-deaf about a lot of things that critically affected his ability to lead his company - media exposure, community relations, discipline and focus, how his own greed looked to his subordinates and line employees, how his public actions affected the way RJR's board viewed him, etc. Ross, in true good ol' boy fashion, seemed to believe that as long as he could toss people fat consulting contracts and play golf and slap some backs, everything would be fine and he'd be able to keep his corporate jets and fancy company-paid apartments and outsize compensation packages forever. His downfall was squarely his own fault, but unfortunately his downfall took down others who were blameless. And, the antagonism he created among his own people handed Kravis a key asset at the worst possible time for Johnson - John Greeniaus of Nabisco, who was able to give KKR critical financial  and strategic information to bolster their bidding position. Johnson's story is an excellent fable about the downsides of executive hubris and greed. Too bad more corporate executives aren't heeding it.<br /><br />I totally agree that there needs to be a follow-up written to this book, either by the original authors, or someone else. As other reviewers have mentioned, Kravis' victory did turn out to be more or less Pyrrhic. In his desire to win the bidding process, he agreed to deal terms that proved toxic to the company. I also would like to see an exploration of how anti-tobacco legislation and public sentiment was more or less ignored in the bidding process, by all parties. No one had a crystal ball, but I am always perplexed, when I re-read this book, that more people didn't see some writing on the wall in regards to tobacco and its continued viability as a popular consumer product.<br /><br />I also think a follow-up book would be interesting as it could provide \\"where are they now\\" info on the principals. F. Ross Johnson parachuted out with $50 million and never had to work again, not that I think there would have been many clamoring for his services. He lives in Florida with his third trophy wife - I can't find any information about what happened to Laurie \\"Cupcake\\" Johnson. Ted Forstmann turned out to be a very insightful and prescient prognosticator, and I think didn't get his due before his death. He was definitely able to see the forest for the trees more clearly than others. Henry Kravis and Linda Robinson are still around and still powerful. Hopefully, some day, someone will pick up the threads of the story and continue weaving the tale.

B007ZZKXWS|1.0|It is for Europe and so it is totally worthless to me I feel completely ripped off. it doesn't even make a nice coaster.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is awesome traps animals survival creative you cant get enough minecraft you could stay up all night playing this game I SWEAR. IT IS awesome price is to low for how much fun it is must have you cant get enough at all
B004SBX112|5.0|kind of hard to control on kindle, screen sensitivity makes it kind of hard to properly aim and control. fun though
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Great book. This is another page turner in Martin's typical style. Fans of the earlier books will enjoy the latest part of the saga.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I have this on all my devices, I do wish they would find a better way to allow ads though. I realize they have to pay for the use somehow but its become very distracting.
B003O86FMW|1.0|I know these books are written for teens and possibly young adults, but I really wonder at the competence of the writer. This delivers a rise and repeat theme from the first book with zero creativity. The characters are annoying as jar jar binks. It's as if this book was written from the perspective of some lustful teen with pseudo sexual tension and angst. I kept asking myself why I was reading such lame material. One star for attempting to write a book, I must recognize determination at least.
B004SD5GZ4|2.0|was a challenge to figure out which one to purchase based on available product descriptions.<br />seams to work ok once i figured out which one to buy
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|Being a pilot and former air traffic controller, I was looking forward to an all-too-rare, technically accurate, and well-executed drama/mystery about an air disaster.  However, &#34;Flight&#34; is more of a study an addict (who happens to be an airline pilot) and the way he eventually deals with his addiction.  The air disaster is almost incidental to the overall story and could have been replaced by any set of circumstances portraying an addict who is directly responsible for lives of the public.  I was not very happy with the ultimate cause of the aircraft's crash, either.  My feeling was that the cause of the crash was too 'pat' and  didn't lend as much drama to the film's conclusion as it could have. (I won't say any more so as not to spoil the film for those who haven't seen it.) Those are my personal disappointments with the film, but most others who watch the film may not be looking for techno-drama as I was and may find the film very enjoyable.<br /><br />Although not as fast-paced as I had expected (or wanted), the film serves up good drama in spite of the occasional slow spots.  I thought Denzel Washington (as always) was excellent, and most of the supporting cast members were very believable and did a nice job.
B0081SPK0I|3.0|Not all that much fun, to hard to control on kindle. will not use to often. it was a buck so who cares.
B009CGLO3K|4.0|This version of the story beats Mirror Mirror hands down in the special effects department. Very well done a movie I would recommend probably more for adults than children.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|101-1in-1 take it this game is awesome 101 games in 1 game take the best game ever!!! You can get as many coins as you can get
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is one of those games were if u was watching bleach u would watch dragonball Z<br />Because its better than it
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Having this book helped me quickly update a printed manuscript to publish for Kindle. It will be a valuable resource as I continue to publish books in print and make them available for Kindle as well, or for those I publish on Kindle only.
B00867GHS8|5.0|Love the 3d version, just like being in the ocean. Depth of picture was awesome, watched it twice with family. It was great demo material.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Good clean fun that makes you smile. The Doctor makes you believe that anything is possible, and Rose is sweet.
B00867GKIK|5.0|What an awesome movie in 3d. This was just like when I seen it in the theatre. My dad is the same as mr. Fredricksen and he laughs.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is fun and great but I think the world tour should alow us to go back and pick the places and they should release new places faster.
B004KKXMSI|5.0|I think the first movie is clearly the best, but the other two are still worth watching. As long as you're watching mainly just to enjoy some action and special effects, then you can tolerate how the plot gets silly and ridiculously unbelievable at times.
006091307X|1.0|This book was absolutely insufferable. The plot was convoluted, the characters were unlikable, and the prose was simultaneously confusing and boring. I didn't finish it. I suppose if you like post modernist crap?
B001NLKWLW|4.0|despite the fact that you could see the final twist coming a mile away, this was a fun read during a snowstorm
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I admit, I skipped through the story line on adventure mode. The story was just too slow and boring. But the game itself is great. There are some useful features like autozoom as you complete the puzzle, and a button to dim blocked tiles. In addition to the adventure mode, there are 99 regular levels as well as a fun &#34;endless&#34; mode where the bricks tower to infinity.
B005QUQ99K|5.0|I bought this for my Sons 9th birthday. He loved it! It has a great instruction booklet and he was able to build this himself.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I played for over an hour before I got to the pay-wall portion of the game, and by then I was hooked. The story line is interesting, the artwork is pretty, and the game play is a lot of fun. It's a mix of hidden object, puzzle mini-games, and problem solving. I loved this! Took me about 4 hours to beat the game.
B008Y6TD5A|4.0|Russell Crowe works to free his wife from prison where she is serving a life sentence for murder. The plot has some interesting twists in that you don't know if she's really guilty or was victimized by a miscarriage of justice until the end. Lots of suspense and surprises.
B006ZPJWBM|5.0|Amazing Tony does it again! Tony sings old favorites with a lot of folks and they compliment each other. Bravo!
B008476HBM|5.0|I've always liked Jane Austen, and this is one of her best, I feel. The ending isn't my favorite, but it's not as if I can change it. I would recommend Pride and Prejudice to all lovers of love stories.
B0076DELIG|4.0|I've been following Harry since Connelly first introduced him.  He never disappoints. The story unfolds little by little just like a British police procedurel
0385736002|5.0|I love how characters you have learned about in history classes have come together with the world of fantasy to create this series. This first book gets you hooked. What a great way to write! The author combines the modern world with myth so it is easier to put you in place with the characters. Want to travel to Paris or San Francisco? Look no further than this series. Want to meet Joan of Arc or William Shakespeare? This is the series for you! Always imagined you you could do magic? This book makes you almost believe you can.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Haven't read much of John Grisham lately so this book was a big surprise.  Very well crafted with a super surprise ending!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I would consider everyone to read this book. It has a lot of emotion, loving, and might even soften up you inner core, your heart. This is a book with districts killing each other. The<br />Bomb.
B0067RQYNW|5.0|It Is almost like Microsoft!!! I love it!! I highly recomemend this app if you are looking for somethig to type papers!
B008476HBM|5.0|this is my desert island book - my favourite of all time. I have read it over and over again and it never ceases to entertain
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was amazing. All I wanted to do was read. I would be out with friends and thinking will I have time to read a chapter tonight
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|The calculator has enough functions for the average user with the extra available functions beneath the memory keys.  Easy to see the big numbers w/o reading glasses.
B007DVF5CC|5.0|Excellent acting all around, good depth, and a couple of good twists and turns.  There's a good bit more to this movie than just a &#34;loose woman&#34; getting men to be with her and pay her sizable amounts of money.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|loved the three books of the hunger games.There are surprises and in the last book. Great ending to the book.
B0059DQHHI|5.0|This was a really interesting movie. It was not at all what I expected . I would Highly recommend this movie.
B001XVS232|5.0|Good tale, great character development, excellent but sparse dialogue.  And the music (esp Tom Petty) is well done.  Excellent northern New Mexico setting.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|I scoffed at these when I first saw them online, but was compelled to check it out after reading rave review one after another. They're the best. They are easy to find, they don't roll when they hit the ground, and much easier for my daughter to get in her mouth on her own. We have two for wash days and I couldn't live without them.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I love playing this game.  My 6 and 3 year olds love this game (and I love that the 3 year old can play and have a blast by himself!).
B007SGM084|5.0|Books had a great story line and excellent characters! I want to read it again and again! It was a great purchase!
B0013FNC38|5.0|Jason Mraz is able to take the lives and thoughts of many and weave it with rhythmic form to envelope the hearts and minds of his audience once again.
B00386EZJU|5.0|The Viking/Celtic music mix is entertaining and fun to listen to.  Makes for some great motivational music, too.<br />A worthwhile piece.
B002P4VUMQ|5.0|Listing to Jason Mraz music is enthralling in itself.  Coupling it with being able to enjoy seeing the music being produced is thrilling.
B001ECQ75A|5.0|& my daughter's too. even when she could barely talk, i knew when i heard &#34;oso&#34; (spanish for bear), she wanted to watch KFP.
B001UGB1X8|4.0|Tommy Lee Jones shines in his performance of a bayou cop trying to track down a murderer. Elements of the supernatural mix with a down to earth murder who-dun-it. Look for John Goodman as a despicable bad guy, a different role for him.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Answers all your questions about publishing on Kindle in a way that is easy to understand, step by step instructions.
B0095P33IW|4.0|Starts off a little slow, but really picks up the pace after the first 20 minutes. Great WWII action movie. Almost like Star Wars meets GI Joe. Good adaptation from the comic book.
B002JH3TW8|5.0|I have had no troubles with my adaptor; it connects my firewire camcorder to my iMac without any issues. Recommended.
B0060D0HJK|5.0|TO ME IT SHOWS THAT YOU CAN BE TRUE TO YOURSELF, SHE CAN HAVE THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS, PLUS WE ALSO LIKED IT WHEN IT WAS DISNEY
0553386697|5.0|I don't want to put the book down. As a mother of two young boys, it's amazing to learn how to foster learning on both sides of the brain.
B0045XICB2|5.0|MY DAUGHTER REALLY LIKES THIS MOVE SHE HAS ALL THE MOVIES AND ALL THE BOOKS. THESE ARE TYPES OS MOVIES SHE'S INTO
B00APUYN0I|4.0|This turned out to be a great film to watch with my wife. It fit her style of film she enjoys, and it was funny enough to keep me entertained, and not longing for something to blow up.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Good imaginative science that is plausible in the real world. Best to watch from the beginning of the first series.
B00AYB1RGG|4.0|I really enjoy the original with Stallone, so I wasn't sure if I would like this one or not. And I did find it to be quite entertaining, not the same as the original.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It was really good and I would highly suggest this as a read for anyone. It was a fantastic buy!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|As always I love this book as I have loved all of his. I hate that it has to end it is definitely a love hate relationship with his books. The storyline is one that we all can relate to in some way or another. Bravo
B004G600A4|5.0|Movie was in great condition and arrived in time so I could give it as a present a few days after I ordered it!
B009VB97EY|2.0|I wish I looked like Matthew McCaughey.<br /><br />Other than that, the rest of the movie was pointless. The story went nowhere until the last 30 minutes, then it was just over. Oh well... At least I didn't pay twenty bucks to see it in the theater.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Like this, mostly cause it helps make plans on days comming up. You can plan to work out doors or plan on indoor projects.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|Scientifically, Fringe is really really bad, but I still like the story a lot, and it's easy to get hooked to the plot.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Enjoy this too much, it is a way to send small messages to friends and keeps you up to date on all friends and family. More so with sharing of pictures of everybody at different occations.
B004UID2LC|1.0|guys I recommend the app playtube its perfect for songs and has a button to put lyrics to the video its better than youtube and you can play the music as background meaning you can listen to it like me listening to Adele skyfall and reviewing this!
B006TJXZ30|5.0|Enjoy all of my Email and information send and recieved. This has become an excellent past time, and fun time to keep up to date with family and friends.
B0098VYCCE|5.0|Have been waiting to see this movie. Excellent cast would see over again and would tell people a must see.  thank you
B00821PCJS|5.0|This show is amazing. Its intense yet very well thought out. It really makes one think what would happen if we weren't alone out there.
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|It is an interesting and fun show to watch. There are some suspenseful parts but overall it's pretty easy on the brain.
B001XUJMZK|5.0|this is probably one of the best movies of all time, I have seen very few movies that equal this one, a must watch. Mel Gibson does an epic role as William Wallace leading rebellion against the British oppressive rule of Scotland.
B00A2LOAKI|5.0|this dvd restores my faith in a great superhero movie, adult themes and killing/deaths are a refreshing flick in the genre. loved this movie and cant wait for more
B005LLT0DQ|5.0|SOA season 4 much better than 3. I've been catching up on the series by streaming with Amazon prime the last four seasons and I couldn't stop. Like reading a good book you can't put it down. Can't wait till season 5 becomes available on prime.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Book was very slow to get into.  It picked up halfway through it.  However, when I got to the end I felt like I missed something.  I reread the last few pages...and no...I did not miss anything...just a really, really bad ending.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I LOVE this game! I play it A LOT! Full five stars! This app is actually<br />worth 10 stars, but I can only give it 5. This is a game for boys AND girls. Not just for boys, not just for girls. Games like MovieStarplanet<br />and wedding dress up are for girls, and games like Xtreme Motocross<br />and Star Wars paper wars are for boys. I enjoyed cut the rope for 10<br />reasons;<br /><br />#1 I loved playing it.<br />#2 It is meant for EVERYONE<br />#3 It's interesting to find out different ways to get the candy in his mouth.<br />#4 It's funny when the monster makes a certain sound when u don't<br />get the candy in his mouth.<br />#5 There are SO many level options!!!! AMAZED!!<br />#6 It's a nice game to play when I'm bored.<br />#7 Nice way to make time fly by.<br />#8 Nothing bad about it.<br />#9 Everyone loves it.<br />#10 ITS AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This book was different from others that Nicholas Sparks has written. Excellent read! I could not put it down! Now all we need is Part II.
B008K9UZY4|4.0|This game is pretty good, but I took off a star because it's a little hard.<br />It's fine, but not many level options. Still, it's fun!
B008KMHFJY|5.0|FAB,  what can I say this would have to be one of the best reads I have read,  The characters are awesome and you feel their pain and the bond they share.  You will fall in love with this story.
B008MEM24S|5.0|I LOVE the show Phineas and Ferb! I'm giving this game 1,000,000,000<br />stars! This game is so entertaining!  LOVE it! It's one of those games<br />that everybody knows about. U should try it out. BE POSITIVE!!
B005PK553C|4.0|Bizarre but extremely well written and acted story. Jessica Lange is excellent. Made me look forward to season 2 !
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Though I am a girl, I am OBSESSED with Star Wars!! The Darth Vader<br />laugh is pretty funny. I have seen EVERY SINGLE STAR WARS MOVIE!!<br />The Dagabah levels are SUPER fun, even though they cost like, two dollars.Don't be so negative about this game, because it's a great game.<br />People ( including me ) like this game. People like Star Wars!!
B006MW3UZW|4.0|I grew up without cable and with PBS and I love to see people really get into masterpiece theater! Maggie Smith is perfection and the story is addictive! I saw both seasons in one day and I cannot wait to see season three!
0802473156|5.0|I love this book<br />It was shipped they way I like<br />Carefully so it can get to my hous in the new contionons
B0034G4P8A|5.0|I love these movies Thor, Iron Man, the Avengers, Fantastic 4, etc. They are way better than the cartoon versions and I like that they have great actors and not a bunch of nobodies. They do a good job recreating the comics now days.
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|inspirational movie about a young girl who has a tragic accident due to a shark bite she continues to love and trust God when others would have been angry and turned away from God
B001UGB1X8|4.0|I was surprised it didn't suck. I love Tommy Lee Jones and the other actors were good as well. It was a good movie to watch when there was nothing else to do on a Saturday night.
B00012QM8G|3.0|This is a great great movie the story of a man's courage to save innocent lives during the holocaust it had way to much profanity had to throw it out because of that fact
6304240554|2.0|This film lacked to live up to the hype that surrounds it.  While the film did have a lot of good zombie death scenes, it lacked the plot of the original &#34;Night of the Living Dead&#34;.  I wish the character interactions had more depth and a better explanation of the power supply for the mall existed.<br /><br />WARNING, SPOILER:  The bikers at the climax of the film were what rubbed me the wrong way most of all; trained military personal fell before a hoard of zombies but random bikers lived and thrived just fine?  I don't think so...
B0018QQQK8|5.0|This was another great Nicholas Sparks novel! I could not put it down! I wanted to read it because I heard the story on a movie trailer. I wanted to read the book before seeing the movie. It is a great story and I would recommend it to anyone who likes romance or Nicholas Sparks! You won't be disappointed.
B000OV85AW|5.0|A good movie from the past. I would recommend it to see the acting of Steeve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman.
B00AA0TJO8|3.0|At first I really enjoyed this game! It is fun to be able to draw the characters and then play the game with them. It quickly becomes boring as you can't always reach the goals and there are only a few differences in the levels. It was a free app on my Kindle so it was worth the price, but if I had paid for it I would think it is a waste. Kids may enjoy it for longer because it is a fairly simple game.
B0094K1WZE|5.0|Half way watching the movie it stops and 're-launches' from the very beginning. I am not sure who's streaming Issue it was U-Verse or Amazon.<br />The movie is excellent.
B004GYY714|5.0|I was trying to listen to a radio station on my Kindle and found there wasn't an app for it. I was able to find this FREE app that allows me to listen to many many radio stations! It comes in loud and clear. I was not aware this app existed, but I would recommend it to anyone who loves to listen to music!
B005B0QYMM|2.0|i thought i was getting something scary but in the end it just did not make sense, poor poor movie
B0046ECFRM|5.0|I started this book and could not put it down! It is a great story and it is easy to fall in love with the characters. There are times when it was easy to predict what would happen, but I found myself rooting for certain characters and wanting more. At the end of the book I was hoping there was a sequel so I could keep learning about the characters. I recommend to anyone who likes romance, teen or adventure books.
0345803485|1.0|Booring - Another chick book written by a female author I was unfamiliar with.  I flipped through the book and then gave it to my daughter, who liked it.
0547884591|3.0|Despite the title, this is not a cookbook.  There are some cooking tips and a few recipes, but it is more of a blog of the author's life and philosophy, and a bit of bragging about his various accomplishments.
030758836X|1.0|Boooring - I should have known better since it was written by a female author I was not familiar with.
B004E1RYKA|4.0|If your a real big Beyonce fan and know ALL of her songs, then this is for you. For, i had bought my sister this and she ended up not using it because she only knew few of her songs from the old albums. Now the songs on &#34;4&#34; Beyonce's 2011 album(newest edition) my sister and i both know.
B0044C3RB4|5.0|Best series ever! Too much reality crap out there so it's nice to have Fringe for those of us that actually have a brain in our head.
B002HNA95O|5.0|All of madonna's hits, i am actually not too much into madonna but this highlights the few songs i do like! :)
B001QWBM62|5.0|These used to be very expensive, so I was a bit worried the new ones might be a bit dumbed down, but it seems they are just as good, and a lot lighter to boot.<br /><br />It's doing everything we wanted and more. :-)
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I have a 3yr old that loves the old game and this one is even better. I know what your thinking, a game a 3 yr old can do....He is an amazing 3yr old. He has reach level 4 and I can't get past one. I am trying too. Might not say much about me but it irritates the snot out of me that my 3yr old can master a game that I am completely at a loss at. Don't be fooled this is a very difficult game. Simple concept and challenging at the same time.
B00APJLFEG|2.0|This movie isn't worth the ten lines I have to write about it. All style, no substance; with a crap pile of exclusionary male bonding where any female that isn't young, thin, or \\"passably hot\\" is silenced put to work up-keeping the hotel while the male monsters can go about their petty dramas undisturbed.<br /><br />If you think kids don't pick up on these messages in movies, think again.<br /><br />If you go around claiming to be progressive and against discrimination, but ignore all the offensive crap in this movie and give it 10 stars regardless; you're lying to yourself and everyone else.<br /><br />It is the year 2012, and movies in America are still selling sexist stereotypes to the public. The only reason people go to the movies is to celebrate sexism as if it's cool and awesome, but I thought that was limited to stupid adult films. I just wasn't prepared to see that stuff SOLD TO OUR KIDS via cartoon movies.
B000GOVHN4|4.0|Some what off beat and enjoyable. Love Elijah Wood in everything I ever saw him in. His body of work is every growing.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|If you like Sci-Fi and you are looking for something to fill the gaping hole left when the last disk of BSG spun to a halt in your DVD player, you might like this.  I loved it.  It has very little in common with the aforementioned, in terms of character personalities and plot, but is a great series and hits on some interesting ideas.  BSG is of course, very militaristic and stark.  Firefly is a bit warmer and fuzzier.  Sadly it is only one season and I am already bummed even though I'm only half-way through!  Joss Whedon is the writer and director.  He is best know to me for Buffy the Vampire Slayer, which is not the least bit interesting to me, but I did watch a couple of episodes and admittedly it is pretty smart and funny.  This has no vampires or demonic themes, just space ships and social commentary, as good Sci-Fi should.
B00AS1Q8FW|1.0|If Tom Cruise was NOT cast as Jack Reacher then this movie would have had at least a chance.  His acting was so bad I wanted to walk out but was with friends, who, in turn, felt the same way.
B00631VJIC|3.0|I thought the songs sounded better on the show than they do on the CD...Maybe it's just me.  Depends on what kind of music you like.
B0025WX2YW|5.0|This show reminds me a lot of Spartacus for some reason. Very dramatic and a fun take on the Henry the 8th story. Plus he's the hottest king henry I have ever seen.
B003TTKB5I|5.0|Never got to see this show when it started out on the air.  Now I'm starting at Season 1 and working my way through....What a great show!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love this show, love the characters, I had never heard of this show before I went to my daughter and son house and she got me hooked now I must admit I am addicted to this show.
B0035YTG30|4.0|I like to watch old movies.  They usually have a good plot and the language is clea.  I get tired of watching movies that the language is so foul that it ruis a movie.  Movies can bee good without the f word and even the gd word.  Also there is too much violence in movies nowadays.
B005HEDI3K|4.0|i wish the original unremastered star trek was available on amazon prime.  i mean ya, i own the dvd's but sometimes i'm too lazy to find the disk.  anyway, the remastered versions are nice for the colors, but i miss the original models and tangerines, fruits, watermelons that were all the planets!
B00APJLFEG|4.0|I am 6 years old and i liked the characters in the movies. Especially the bat, wolf and zombie. Also liked the sound effects pretty scary and funny. :)
1878424319|5.0|Its a great book. I feel that you need to read more than the four agreements to get the whole picture. It has helped my life tremendously. For the person that wrote the bad review. I wish you well. Sounds like you have alot of emotional poison going on. But that is your choice. I have incorporated the four agreements to my beliefs in my own religion and have a completely different interpetation of the bible which I believe is so much better than what a pastor's definition is. I feel like I understand more of what the words of the bible should mean. The truth according to me and what is truth for me. To not be GOD but to be GOD like how can anyone go wrong with that. Of course I cant create miracales like GOD but I can surely win the energy of the Creators favor.Postive energy is always better than negative energy. A great Tool to have and nothing more. The choice is yours.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This is the first  book on my kindle and I throughly enjoyed both.  It is hard to put Grishams' books down when he writes about lawyers.
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|This was a great piece of story-telling.  It is an inspiring movie suitable for both little girls and boys, but there are some scary parts that might be too much for younger kids - you will have to use some judgement about the monster scenes.  I had more appreciation for the computer animation after reading articles about how each individual curl in her hair has to be separately simulated and that this technique has only become possible with the latest generation of technology.
B001GSTOAM|5.0|You will never approach coding the same way again. This book WILL make you a better software developer.<br />A must read for anyone writing code
B009RI4ZKC|4.0|This was a good cast and the camera work was artistically done.  The island is picturesque and feels just like how I imagine life could be like on a small New England island town.  There were some cringe-worthy intimate scenes, but nothing felt gratuitous.  It was an enjoyable, smart piece of story telling - something rare compared to the many mindless action movies out there.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Wow! What an awesome story! Absolutely incredible. I'm so glad I read the \\"story\\" before watching the movie. Let go and just imagine.
B00AR0DN3Y|4.0|JS writes surprisingly well.  He conveys the mixed emotions of the joy of survival and the agony of (supposed) loss. Although a bit technical in its climbing narratives, the book is a must read for anyone who has ever dangled from a rope or slung an ice ax.<br />An excellent supplement to the film.
B004X2M3N8|5.0|I didn't know if Matt Smith was going to have the seriousness aspect as well as the others did, but this season cemented that.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|The Fringe is intertaining beyond measure. So much of the story lines hint at the kind of pseudo science that is repeatedly being rumored by sources on altervative news media to be taking place behind the scenes through black ops projects with their Machiavellian secrecy. It is fun to watch.
B003G94BZC|5.0|New Doctor, New Personality, and what seems like a New Budget... My only possible gripe with it, is that it feels like nothing from the past is ever going to come back, other than River obviously... but that isn't a bad thing necessarily...
B001UTW7QU|5.0|One of the best sci-fi shows ever, right up there with The X-Files. The cast is perfect, you'll love the characters in this very engaging show.
145210655X|3.0|I remember being in the crowd on Saturday night in the summer of 1977 when Star Wars made it to South Dakota in the summer between my sophomore and junior year of college.  No doubt, it was a revolutionary movie, and we all fell in love with way Star Wars expanded us.  Since then, over and over again, \\"Star Wars\\" has defined much of our generation's experience.  This book, though, doesn't really live up to my expectations.<br />While it stands at the threshold of being a cute concept, I am sure that the most that I did was smile at the pages.  I'm happy to have it on my shelves, but I don't think I will take it down very often.
B004ZG5EYC|5.0|A film about the anomie and search for meaning and happiness in a modern urban setting.  Many excellent character studies by supporting cast and the tale of Amelie at it's core.  Audrey Tautou is remarkable and possessor of probably the most mischievous grin in captivity.  Great Parisian locations and a plot that moves along nicely.  I chose Blu-ray version for better picture detail and durability because I will probably watch this film many times.  There is more to this film than just the humor but even on that level alone it is exceptional.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I started is book with little hope as it seemed a bit \\"Oirish\\" in the worst meaning of that word, but I found it more and more touching as I read on and soon didn't want to put  it down. Give it a chance and it will touch your heart.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Marvellous portayal of the lives of the elite of that time period as well as the lives of their servants.  Such a treat to be inside that wonderful old mansion. The acting is wonderful and the music sets it off perfectly.
B0095ZQ36G|3.0|Better WWII Bomber books concerning cockpit procedure and aviation terms, but a very compelling story.  Enjoyed the book very much, but wish the author had a pilot's perspective.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|This is probably the best series ever to come out of England. The storyline is classical and the acting is far above great! Then you have all of the wonderful costumes, the old automobiles, and the sets. And of course you get to watch Maggie Smith at her best.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|Good movie for both adults and kids. The characters were fun to watch and the one liners we wonderful. Our family thoroughly enjoyed watching Hotel Transylvania on movie night.
B00499NHLC|4.0|I like the series very much. The only problem that I am having is sometimes I don't get the connection that Holmes does; I get confused.
B000GRTQXY|5.0|Primal Scream is a chameleon band. This is their country/rockabilly album. Great hits like 99th Floor and Country Girl get stuck in your head for days.<br />I can't believe it's only on CD, but such is.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Yay when this game came out I knew I had to get it I'm so addicted to this game I can't go a day with out playing it I just wanna say thank u 4 making it
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great show from the beginning!  Love it!  I'm bummed that I am caught up and wish I had more to watch!
B00AZL3PBK|1.0|I give it a 1 because it's ok game and a bad game.it's like super Mario but worst so that's why I give it  a 1
B0094K1WZE|4.0|This movie was enjoyable but I don't think that it compares to the first couple that were made.  If you just enjoy the action you will like it.  It's worth watching.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I give it 5 stars because u always get something new every time and its a good<br />Game that's why I give it a 5
B008M34INW|5.0|It kept my eyes glued to the movie. Funny. Not what I expected. Would recommend to everyone. Media must not really like Gibson because I'm not sure I heard of the movie before or during it's time in the theaters.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I've read previous books by John Grisham and this is one of the best. Love how the underdog wins in the end.
B005PK56TA|2.0|I watched the full first season, mostly because of Jessica Lange (and because it was free).<br /><br />Each episode was pretty much a repeat of the one before it, just with a few more perversions and evil deads thrown in.  By the end, even Jessica was annoying me.  A mindless celebration of violence and gore.
B007V65R54|4.0|Mr. Silver delivers his main point in a powerful way using a number of domains where predictions and models are used to make predictions. His main point ... that one should be wary of predictions in all fields ... is well made. The danger of using noise in the prediction is also an excellent point that is often overlooked by many in the prediction business. If you like baseball or playing poker, you will enjoy his copious chapters on these subjects. For me personally, these chapters went on too long and delved too deeply into background matter when a brief explanation of each would have sufficed followed by a discussion of the estimation techniques applied in each.<br /><br />Where I think this book falls short is the opportunity to educate the lay person in a number of areas. First, the presentation of Bayes' Theorem was a bit odd and the equation he presented did not convey the succinctness of the theorem, in my opinion. It was a form of the theorem seldom seen by engineers and mathematicians who are familiar with technique. It was an opportunity to give a clearer glimpse into the techniques for doing predictions in political races, something everyone would be interested to know. I still don't know how these predictions are done, how the polling is done, etc., and it was one of the main reasons I bought the book. He also did not make a clear explanation between a purely statistical model and a temporal model such as those used in econometrics or weather forecasting. It was an opportunity to educate the lay person that I thought was missed.<br /><br />In summary, the book attained its goal of putting the reader on warning about widely-used predictive models and it gave insight into several surprising domains where statistical models are used, e.g., the selection of baseball athletes. I felt the book fell short in missing an opportunity to educate the lay public on some of the more technical aspects of the application of statistical and temporal models to predictinga variety of events that affect everyday life.
B006YC74E8|5.0|every other photo edited I downloaded won't let me add text boxes. I freakin' love this app! &lt;3 I recommend this app to everyone. If you want to make a book cover or add a caption to an embarssing photo of a friend. It has other great settings but I'm obsessed with captions. :)
B008VIKLWA|2.0|The filmmakers behind \\"Chimpanzee\\" should be pissed. Clearly, they love their subject matter and worked extremely hard to create this gorgeous film. When placed in Disney's hands, however, it became a caricature of a nature film. The poor music choices, awful writing and Tim Allen's hammy voice work really wrecked it for me and my family. I'm tempted to replace the film's audio track with some classical music to see if that solves it.<br /><br />What's good? The photography is fantastic. The film mixes incredibly intimate shots of the chimpanzees at work, play and war with stunning slow and fast shots of the surrounding nature. It's a visual treat at full 1080p on a big screen.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Well written- provides fascinating details in an interesting yet conversational way. It feels like the author was sharing and explaining the situation and events to a close friend. For everyone who knows in your heart how much we all have to be grateful  for to our military people and their families, this provides some of the reasons. A tribute to all who serve or have served, it is also a reminder of the importance of doing one's best even during the toughest of times. I feel honored to be able to help keep the author's bravery and story alive. Rest in peace!
B009JZTP4Y|4.0|I loved this movie when it first came out and it was great fun to watch it again. If you are not a Trekie, you will probably feel that too much time is spent on celebrating the Enterprise itself. But the end of the movie is unexpected and makes the movie worth watching.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Great show. The new generation X Files.  Casting was spot on for each character. Each season keeps getting better than the last season.
B00A6VAW9W|3.0|Very nicely produced album. Problem is, I'm not a big 'country' fan. I bought this album based on other reviews. One said that if I liked POCO (I LOVE Poco), then I would love these guys. I've been a huge Loggins & Messina fan forever, so based on other reviews, I gave BSR a shot. Just waaay too much Country for me. Not particularly into the girl's voice either. She tries too hard to sound like she's auditioning for American Idol, or The Voice. (never watch either show because they all sound the same) She needs to find her own voice instead of emulating 50 other 'artists' voices. Too bad. I had high expectations, got more dissapointments. Gonna dig out my old POCO cd's.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|What a wonderful program! I love the fascinating glimpse of noble and servant life at that time. Terrific characters, too!
B004ZQRFGM|2.0|She's OK, but found her voice to be very monotonous over the course of the album. Best part of the album is looking at the pictures!
B004UID2LC|1.0|This app only lets you see what is popular. You don't get to put in any of you're own choices. I wouldn't buy it.
B005K17RU0|3.0|Weather for my location is rarely accurate.  App uses zip code.  My city is small and uses the same zip as another small city. The weather is greatly different in the zip code.  New Hope,TN is one side of the TN River and at the foot of a mountain along the river and Nickajack Lake.  South Pittsburg is on the other side of the river, not near the lake and not as close a proximity to the foot of a mountain.  It is often raining on one side of the river and sunny on the other side of the river.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|This is easy to use and very helpful. I love how it gives the estimated time for each activity on your device.
B0044C3RB4|5.0|Fringe is a great show that is full of action, suspense, and drama. The characters and story lines are detailed an always leave you wanting more. Don't miss this one!!!
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Can't get enough of this game - one of the most fun puzzle games ever!  A fast-paced game that is great if you are ocd and love patterns.  Highly recommended!
B0086700CM|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME! Keeps me entertained and always wanting to earn a higher score. Fast pace game. Great game for a tablet.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|Love this program.  Each character is unique in their own way.... all strong, always one step ahead.  But Gemma is The Best.
B008MEM24S|5.0|I purchase this game for my five yr old. He loves it, and I like playing it too. Perfect for all ages.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|I love Jane Austen and this rendition of Emma is done extremely well.  It captures the caprice of this young Privilidged girl and all it's quirks. I highly reccomend it.
B005PK56TA|5.0|Super 12 hr horror series must watch cast was superb and story was even better twists and turns each episode kept me wanting more each show
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Love to watch this while on my treadmill.  Wish there were more episodes!  The writing and the acting are phenomenal.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|Very cool app. I'm new to this stuff but very fun to use so far. I would recommend this app to anyone who likes taking your photos and doing creative things to them like adding a frame, sketch, etc.
B001ANSSDC|2.0|Although this book did not really grap my interest, I am really glad I finished it. A very slow and somewhat strange book.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Very entertaining funny movie for a family with teenage kids!  Would definitely suggest watching it...(maybe twice).  Oh and did I mention the music was fun, too?!
B001BKTEZA|5.0|Wonderful classic!  This should be required reading for every American history student.  Surprisingly enough, this book was hard to find in stores ...Amazon is great!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is the best game ever. It is like Temple Run but better. I would not change anything about it. The characters are really cool and fun. Subway Surfers is the best game of all time.
B000050HTO|5.0|Dylan.  Bought for old stuff I didn't have, found a lot of stuff I hadn't heard and liked.  A good deal all the way around.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Fun app for all ages especially horse lovers realistic graphics. Plenty of activities and fun a virtual game that can entertain for hours
B004WR125O|2.0|The big disappointment with this unit is with its network settings.  In short, it won't connect to a secure WiFi network that doesn't announce its SSID.  Lame.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|best app ever !!! it is very good when you are bored....I would know....I am always bored....yeah two more words
B004EF65QA|5.0|Captured the problems of industry and labor while throwing in a real romance in the style of wonderful Jane Austen. I especially appreciated the fact that the author took into account the fact that a true lasting love has to have two partners and friends to form a lasting relationship.  Whenever I read/watch a story now, I want to believe that the two characters are looking beyond the &#34;love&#34; of the moment and thinking about what it would mean to spend every day &#34;living&#34;, working, playing, being silent, and loving just one person for the rest of their lives.  I replayed the ending several times.  I was touched by the simple gesture of her finally taking his hand and holding it in her own - now that is true romance.  A simple, gentle touch that says so much while so simple; if only other film makers could realize the power of a sweet gesture!<br /><br />Of course, the acting was wonderful and the casting perfect!
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Jack Ryan jn. displays all is is fair in love and war. Techno stuff as always.<br /><br />I've been away from Clancy for a bit,  but Jn adds a lot of spice and takes us back to a younger Sn.<br /><br />Good ending. I've been reading a lot about Chinese virtual attacks on website inside the USA. Topic is indeed right on.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|We loved this series.  Relaxing and enjoyable!  We love the history and the beautiful scenery and a glimpse in the life of past times.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|The sub-plots of this novel were outstanding, each and everyone of them tie into the outcome. I particularly liked the number of heroes vs villians. It brought more reality to the novel and helped tie up loose ends.<br />The technical details were outstanding in all aspects, computer, air operations, and governmental intelligence agencies, This however, is expected of Tom Clancy.<br />Good Job
B00A9T1HUO|3.0|That sums up Josh Groban the longer his career goes on.  His first few albums were magnificent! Than starting a little bit with Awake and even more so with Illuminations which was an UTTER disappointment to me.  I was afraid of the same thing with the new CD since I didn't really like the single at all \\"Brave\\".  Very predictable sounding and generic and formulaic.  The next song, \\"False Alarms\\" is a little better but STILL a little too formulaic for me. It has an some interesting instrumentation to it, but the same refrain is repeated over and over with his voice lifting the same way all the way through! It gets worse on track 3 \\"Falling Slowly\\".  It's SOOOO predictable, starts off slowly than builds a little until Josh raises his voice in a higher tempo (than even higher).  The same thing is repeated again and again throughout the entire song. Track 4 \\"She Moved Through The Fair\\" is even worse and more predictable than ever, and I really started to feel like Josh was going to take an even further step down from Illuminations.  The song is slow, boring, and other than the bagpipes never changes.  The same methodical sound and Josh's voice all the way through!  Track 5 \\"Below The Line\\" has some different sounding music on it but again it's formulaic!  Playing around with different sounds, instruments, etc does not make a good song.  It's nothing great at all!  Track 6  \\"E Ti Promettero\\" with Laura Pausini is the first song I like on the album and it's not in English. A pretty decent ballad! Usually I don't like remakles but Josh does a great job on Track 7 with \\"The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress\\".  I always liked this song, Judy Collins was my favorite version from decades ago.  Groban has the right voice for it and it's quite nicely done! I also like Track 8 \\"Un Alma Mas\\".  Seems to me the album is finally starting to heat up, very good instrumentation and Josh's voice really does well with the song and the Spanish guitar.  Nice horn at the end, superb! I would like to hear this song done in English!  Track 9 \\"Happy in My Heartache\\" visits back into formulaic again. The arrangements are simple, but the problem is when the refrain is repeated over and over in exactly the same manner.  I am again reminded of the downfall of Illuminations.  Track 10 \\"Hollow Talk\\" is a really unique song. It stays slow for a long time, nice piano and interesting arrangements, but it builds and builds......  Finally the song explodes with a nice orchestra.  Creative, something this album on the whole sorely lacks!  Track 11 \\"Sincera\\" is a bit too operatic for me.  The best song on the album is clearly Track 12 \\"I Believe (When I Fall in Love It Will Be Forever)\\" which I would never have expected but they couldn't have done a better job with this had they tried. The instrumentation and choir highlight the vocals perfectly.  So there you have it, a new Josh Groban album with about 5 good songs so it is better than Illuminations.  I would give 3 1/2 stars.  But the bad songs on this album are FAR TOO many.  Josh continues to be an awesome talent with a beautiful operatic voice but he can't seem to find songs that are worthy of him.  I can't believe it's so hard for him to find song writers.  He's so popular and his albums are starting to fail commercially ONLY because of this reason.  Yea it's number #1 right now on Amazon and the usual die hard fans are praising this album up one side and down the other.  But you will see in a month or so \\"All That Echoes\\" will sell even less than Illuminations and in the end be a commercial disappointment.  This guy needs better direction and management, someone to tell him what music he chooses is good or not.  He's crashing way too soon in a career that should have gone 10 years before any of this was even an issue.  His flame is dimming way too soon I'm afraid!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Kept my interest throughout.The characters were all intertwined at the end. Although you didn't think they would come together.<br />Very good.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I have been watching televison since my parents got out first TV, in the late 1940's. There have been many great TV shows and series I have watched since then and this is up there with the best of them.
B004LROUW2|5.0|I kept turning the pages and puzzling along about unreal worlds and unknown dimensions.  It reads like an M.C.Escher drawing.
B002KGEORM|5.0|One of the best shows on television. This is a great opportunity to catch it from the beginning f you haven't already
B007PFD90G|2.0|Too much information, details that are relevant to the author but that do not reach a reader.  I couldn't even read it on a long flight.
B0040I09RM|5.0|One of the best shows on television. This is a great opportunity to catch it from the beginning f you haven't already
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|I have watched all of season 1 and 2 and love this show. I watch it alon with Damages. I have watched all the of the shows on Amazon.
B008X6JP3G|3.0|a tony scott film from 1990 with a puffy, tucked in shirt wearing kevin costner. what more needs to be said?
B000IDEORY|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies. I did review a remake which had some bits with Patrick Swazy but it did not out reach the original.
B00821PCJS|2.0|This series was clearly written with the beta version of the PlotMaster1.0 software.  Take all the alien and sci fi shows you have seen, add a linear plot, and a bunch of gore and you have this show.  It is not in the least intellectually engaging.
B00AREIAI8|1.0|this game does not work. whin you. go to start it does not work. don't by this app. pritty please
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Good play. Good length. Graphics looked nice and the puzzles weren't too easy. Worth the price. Another fun game from G5.
B0026PA05M|5.0|I love it! Love the meaning behind the songs. Love the story in the songs. Need to listen to it everyday
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|The writing is quick and the characters are interesting.  Nikki Heat is the female version of every ubber male cop you've ever read about, so it's fun to have a female being the Alpha Dog for a change.  I can't help but picture the characters from Castle, the TV series but that doesn't interfere with enjoying the book.
B00821OX98|4.0|It is an interesting take on an apocalyptic event. Many interleaving storylines add to the interest. Good science fiction action and effects.
0061733199|4.0|I am a novice Prepper, so frankly I was overwhelmed by the information in this book. I keep returning to it and always find new and useful information. Very useful if you are a hiker or any sort of outdoors person. Armageddon not required.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|The first one has more characters to unlock making it more  to explore. I do like the graphics and the new zip line.
B0058YPILY|5.0|I have all seven seasons and love them all. I have not seen season eight at all but will purchase it when available. I think they have changed/dropped an actor/actress so only viewing it will determine if I will continue. I stopped watching CSI when actors/actresses got changed/dropped.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is so well written. The plot was well thought out and the dialogue was riveting. And the intense seduction OMG!<br />I totally fell in love with Holder's character. Sky's character and responses to situations were believable.<br />Great read
B007THA4FI|1.0|Ugh. A real snoozer. Too wordy.  Confusing. Too many characters being introduced early on. Story jumps around. I couldn't even finish it.
B0084670FU|3.0|This is a very odd and confusing movie. I liked it bc it kept me wanting to keep watching it just to figure out what was going on. One the other hand, at the end of the movie my husband and I found ourselves saying 'really, that was it?' Some of the scenes were so odd and days afterwards I would think about how weird they were. Not sure I would tell someone 'oh, you have to watch this movie, it's really good.' If you have seen everything else and just want something to watch, this movie is worth watching.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|very fun and addicting love how I can interact with my horse who I could name so I named. him hammer after my horse who recentley passed
B000QWCLOK|5.0|Perfect Condition. The sound quality is amazing, the lyrics were included, and it is exactly what I purchased from the online site.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|Lark Rise to Candleford has all the classic elements of a Masterpiece theater miniseries. It's a sweet 1890's period piece about family, love, community, joy, and hardships. The acting is superb and the setting pretty. (And the Pratt's dresses are a treat.)
8866130931|5.0|Nothing beats the Moleskin line of products. They do what they're meant to do in the way you want and need.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This is a great read!  As a husband of a very committed and loving wife this book helped me realize all that she does to speak my love language and how simple it would be to reciprocate this love!
B0088W4YTK|5.0|This is one of the best originals from the Syfy network before the Syfy channel started going downhill.<br />I wish another network would pick back up a Stargate series.
B002ZG9968|5.0|This product is a great deal... The quality is excellent.... I recommend the purchases... Excellent and good... I'm really satisfied...
B000HZHBIM|5.0|Perhaps the BEST Star Trek story ever written!  The video playback was perfect, as was the audio.  I recommend this video!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game because it s like I have a real horse to play with. I love this game
B008MM9630|5.0|Awesome game love you don't have neighbors too really have to<br />Love the game love everything about it and can be wireless
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I would definitely recommend this book to a friend!  Thought it was entertaining and full of lots of suprises!!! Couldn't put the book down!
B0084TWN9K|4.0|All these short stories seem to be of a looking back. Of decisions made and not made. The author has some biographical shorts at the end. The matter of fact way she writes of these sad events are told realistic and without sentiment. Yet left me feeling rather melacholic about all the stories and the fates of these characters. Worth reading.
B002RI9UBS|5.0|Have read Life of Pi and seen the movie and thorouhly enjoyed both. The courage of Pi in the face of such danger was amazing.
B008NBEY3C|5.0|terrific, the more i ear the more i like, even the sound is improved when compared with earlier edition, in fact  from  cds1 to 38  are new remasters, perahia always make you fell that his version of any piano piece is the right one, even if you love another version by other pianist, but you have to compare only with the best, beautiful presentation, great value , for me is the shopping of the year ( and i expect to buy more)
B007HACDLK|4.0|Mitch Rapp again kicks a** and takes names, this time in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Well written cloak and dagger thriller from Vince Flynn.
B0055SWM08|3.0|The fact that they nag you to rate this app is very annoying and turned a very positive experience into a so-so one.  The music is wonderfully soothing and the game is not timed so it's a nice way to relax.
B0095P33IW|4.0|Superhero comes to life, a fun flick for a Friday night. Lots of action (as expected), and good casting for a movie of this type.
B00AKL1XPU|3.0|ive had the game restart on me atleast 4 times plus it did not save progress when leaving so had to go back and redoubt lots of time otherwise fun time waster
B00AZL3PBK|1.0|to tell the truth this game is stupid is that really the best they can do a lepercon (which is not real so lying to kids) shooting pinecones at bugs (do u want kids going around  throw pinecones at people) this game is immature and stupid I wouldn't recommend to kids between ages 3-8 but its steal fun :)!!!!!!!!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Loved the first one and this one is even better. Although I do feel like they've made it a little more necessary to use real money in the game.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|It's a romance novel with a bit of danger. Not too sappy, not too cliche. It was just right and it left me wanting more! Recommended (: Sparks never disappoints.
B001XULSG6|5.0|First Contact feels a lot more like the Next Generation TV show that a feature movie, but it is still a good Star Trek movie to watch.  The action in the Next Generation movies is much more subdued than the originals but is still entertaining.
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|Author writes with so much detail. You wonder if she actually traveled back to tell us her adventures. On to the next book :)
B001DPHDCY|3.0|I love the movie, but it sometimes skips so it is just OK, so no more cheap ones for me.
B00AA7V2Z0|4.0|Season 1 has def hooked me in as fan of this series! Will be catching up with season 2 shortly
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I loved every minute of this creative and beautifully written story.  Just saw the Avett Brothers in concert over New Year's and it blew my mind that there music figured in so prominently.  What a wonderful synchronistic event!  Love Colleen Hoover's poetic prose and her gift for imparting wisdom through wonderful storytelling!
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|While the acting and story line was superb as usual , beginning and ending the third season with death of two of the favorite characters a bit trying! Ending on suspenseful note is a cliffhanger; a death is a downer!  Still can't wait for season IV.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|Great plot and Denzel Washington did a good job portraying a completely unlikeable pilot.  The initial flight /crash sequence was gut clenching and so realistic that I'll be thinking about it next time I have to travel.
B00AUJ9NZE|5.0|What's so compelling about the Sherlock stories? Answer. Conan Doyle's ability to build the intrigue and describe characters with great detail. It's just a great read. Best story for me \\"  The Adventure of the Speckled Band\\".
B008476HBM|5.0|This is a classic that I have read several times.  Each time I return to it I find new levels of inspiration.  I recommend it to  anyone who loves period pieces of worth.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|It funny for both parents and kids. With hidden jokes(clean) for parents and goofness for children. Fun for all ages.
B0027MJU00|4.0|I thought that it had a good plot. It kept going from the past to the present but it would give you little hints so you could keep thinking about how it all happened.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|its a good game my friend told me to get it and she liked it and so do I I play it every day

B008Y6WPXC|3.0|I didn't expect too much and this movie delivered. It was fun to watch and held my attention. It didn't have me thinking about it until Amazon prompted me to review it. I don't think I'll want to go back and see it again. Not deep, A few good action scenes. Lots of &#34;I wonder what happened to them&#34; actors. It's good for what it is.

B008476HBM|5.0|One can easily be mistaken by pride and prejudice, which can later lead to foolish misunderstanding. Throughout this novel the reader can observe how a marriage can secure social status and economic security. Mrs. Bennet would do anything to guarantee both for her daughters. Pride and Prejudice is a story of love, drama and life at England during the 19-century. The author of this classic of literature is Jane Austen. Jane Austen is the seventh daughter of eight children. Being daughter of Rev. George Austen and Cassandra, Austen was born in December 16th, 1775 at Steventon, Hampshire, England. Austen died on 18 of July 1817 at the age of 41 in Winchester, Hampshire, England. Jane died unmarried as well as her sister Cassandra Elizabeth who was 2 years older than Jane. Jane wrote several books before her death including Pride and Prejudice who's initial title would be First Impressions.<br /><br /> The arrival of Mr. Charles Bingley to Nederfield Park, caused quite a scandal. Mr. Bingley was a young single man with a huge fortune, and the perfect candidate for husband for one of Mrs. Bennet's daughters. Mr. Bingley's sister and closest friend, Miss Bingley and Mr. Darcy had arrived with him. Mr. Bennet paid unwillingly a visit to Mr. Bingley under order of her wife with the purpose of causing a good impression. Mr. Bingley encountered the Bennet's at a ball and was allured by the oldest Miss Bennet, Jane. Not only once did Mr. Bingley ask her to a dance with him, but twice. Miss Bingley became an acquaintance of Jane and became very fond of her.<br /><br /> Throughout the novel we are able to observe how society was back in the 19th century. A woman's priority was to get a wealthy and high ranking husband who would be able to provide a good social status to her and their children. The fact that Mr. Collins would inherit the Bennet's property after Mr. Bennet passed away allows us to see further into women's rights. Women were not oppressed as they used to be but they still didn't had the same amount of privileges we do in the present. Mr. Bennet could not leave their daughters any inheritance because they were all women and the property was entailed, meaning that only males could inherit it. The book is so well written with so much detail that it turns one from an outsider into an insider.<br /><br /> One is able to observe what a typical day would be in the old days, especially for women, how would they travel and how long their visits would last. I found it quite peculiar how in the past people used to be guests for months and in the present it is less likely, one usually is more busy and just stops for a while and moves on. In the novel Elizabeth spends four weeks at Hunsford with Mrs. Collins and she is still begged by Lady Catherine to remain. Jane also spends around three months in London in her aunt's residence. We can see and advance in the way Mr. Darcy thinks. Many would have believed that Elizabeth's imprudence would be considered of bad taste and rude, but Mr. Darcy admired her for all the reasons someone else may dislike her. Elizabeth didn't accepted Mr. Collins proposal and she still declined Mr. Darcy's proposal not afraid of remaining unmarried. In contrast Miss Lydia Bennet was so desperate in getting a husband. On her way home Lidya commented to her sisters the following,<br /><br /> \\"Let us hear what has happened to you all since went away. Have you seen any pleasant men? Have you had any flirting? I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back. Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare. She is almost three-and-twenty! Lord, how ashamed I should of not married before three-and-twenty! My aunt Philips wants you to get husbands, you can't think. She says Lizzy should had better have taken Mr. Collins;but I do not think there would have been any fun in it. Lord! How I should like to be married before any of you! And then I would chaperon you about to all the balls.\\"<br/><br /> I found this book intriguing since it shows how us humans may be blinded by prejudices and pride. Sometimes we may judge too fast or too harshly and that no matter how bad something seems it may not be the absolutely true. Elizabeth judged Mr. Darcy too quickly, being blinded by prejudice, she believed completely what Mr. Wickham had said and didn't confirm it with Mr. Darcy. Mr. Darcy was sometimes too proud that he acted foolishly, he didn't show any signs of his feelings towards Elizabeth till the last minute, he didn't tell the absolute truth about Mr. Wickham in order to avoid judging and to conserve his pride. Even though Jane Austen is not here to see the impact her stories has had, this piece of art specifically will always be remembered as one of the classics of literature./><br /> I found this book intriguing since it shows how us humans may be blinded by prejudices and pride.

One day I was scanning the free app of the day on my Kindle Fire HD and I found this app! I was so excited and I love playing it on my Kindle Fire HD. It has great graphics and a great strategy-physics game.

B00APJLFEG|5.0|Not cheesy like those Disney films.  Very entertaining and cute.  You don't have to worry about bad language or back talk.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|After hearing how great this series was, I finally started watching season 3 on PBS.<br />Then I saw that I could buy the entire season  1 & 2 on Amazon for a low price.<br />As soon as I received the DVDs, I had a Downton Abbey marathon, and was thoroughly hooked.<br />The DVDs also have some extras which added to the enjoyment of the series - such as the fact that the actresses even wear the type of corsetts for that period and have all had a corsett failure at some time.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Very good and addicting.  Great quality video. Would recommend to others Nice not to have to buy the video to get caught up on the series. Just started watching new season and needed the info to get vaught up to date.
B000V5Y1SQ|3.0|DS9 Season 1 starts out REALLY slow, with some acting that goes WAY over the top.  I struggled to convince myself to keep watching, and by the end of the season I had at least forgiven the poor acting.<br /><br />There's not a lot new here as far as Star Trek goes: new alien species, strange energy-based phenomenon, smugglers, criminals, etc.  The only difference is that instead of the Star Trek crew encountering them, the encounters come to the space station.  There are regular instances of a crew member or two either going to the nearby planet or taking a runabout through the wormhole to the gamma quadrant, but generally it's only a carrier for the story that's happening on Deep Space Nine.<br /><br />One truly redeeming factor of DS9 is its characters.  Despite a bit of overacting, particularly near the beginning, all of the important characters are deep, and that depth often helps carry the show through a boring scene or a weak story.<br /><br />All in all, DS9 is worth watching for people like me who want to watch the entire Star Trek series, or for very, very devoted Star Trek fans.  Otherwise, I don't think DS9 would hold a persons attention for very long.
B001XV09UG|4.0|This movie is a bit unusual about a secret organization that disguises the membership behind masks and provisions for all the near cult likes sexual encounters among the membership.  I would recommend it for the movie goer that likes a weir twist to a common subject of adventure through secrecy and infidelity.

B0044C5SCU|5.0|Creative, stylized, and complex; however, easier to follow than Lost.  The actors brought this series to life and invested the viewer in the worlds of Fringe.  I am sorry to see it end.

0425263908|3.0|\\"Graceful,\\" \\"strong\\", \\"sliding fluidly\\", \\"moved with animal grace and arrogant economy\\", \\"turning in a leisurely pivot,\\" and \\"easy and unhurried stride.\\"<br /><br />If you had to guess, to whom or what do those phrases refer?  A leopard?  Olympic champion sprinter Usain Bolt?  Figure skater Michelle Kwan?  Certainly, those descriptions could apply to any or all of them, but in this case, these are phrases describing the walking habits of Gideon Cross, the love interest in Bared to You.  I noticed all of these early on in the novel, and I decided I had to make note of them.  Let's also not forget to include:  \\"every step he took commanded attention and respect,\\" and \\"walking with that sleek, confident grace.\\"  And these were just in the first 100 pages.  There were similar over-the-top descriptions of Gideon's body, face, hair, clothes, and of course, his prowess.  Oh, he's also in his twenties and worth some $12 billion.  So, it's no surprise that Eva fell immediately for him, and of course, he was crazed for her in return.<br /><br />There was other silliness - Gideon owns just about every building Eva sets foot in: her apartment building, her office building, and a nightclub.  Everyone in Eva's small circle is gorgeous, successful, and charming, and most are incredibly wealthy, including Eva herself.  Yet, we're supposed to accept that these are all very messed-up people, but the only real evidence we see of that is that a couple of them have bad nightmares.  Gideon also has some bad habits including grabbing Eva by the elbow and steering her everywhere and shoving his hands through his hair.  Seriously, I should go back and count the number of times those acts were mentioned.<br /><br />A book like this is difficult to review, because so much of it makes me laugh and/or cringe, and yet, for reasons I don't understand, I feel compelled to read it.  I know some of it is due to just wanting to see what the fuss was about.  Much of the story was repetitive; in the few weeks that the story covers, Christian and Ana (whoops, Gideon and Eva) fought, broke up, and got back together in spectacular fashion countless times.  I didn't like Eva.  She is petty, spiteful, and manipulative.  I'm sure others think she's fabulous, but I found her much more distasteful than her Fifty Shades of Gruesome counterpart, whereas Gideon is immensely more likeable than that other dude.<br /><br />I think it's safe to assume that if you liked Fifty Shades of Grotesque, you will enjoy Bared to You.  Sylvia Day's writing skill is worlds beyond that of E.L. James.  That may sound like faint praise, but it's praise nonetheless.  If you hated Fifty Shades of Gross, you will, like me, probably find this book to be at least slightly more tolerable.w weeks that the story covers, Christian and Ana (whoops, Gideon and Eva) fought, broke up, and got back together in spectacular fashion countless times.

B00499QUK2|4.0|I enjoyed it.  Funny and true to Sherlock Holmes story.  Watson isn't my favorite but if you're a Sherlock fan you'll enjoy.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|At first I looked at this app hesitantly, thinking that I already had enough news apps to begin with. Being me though, I went ahead and got it, thinking I would use every once in a while. I was wrong. I use this app multiple times a day. Mainly for the news, but I can check practically any of my social apps without having to go to them separately (with the exception of pinterest and reddit to my disappointment) The app is neat and tidy (and fun, the pages literally &quot;flip&quot;) and so far, no crashes or even glitches. If you have pulse, think of flip board as pulse, but a hundred times better. All and all, great app.
B000JQU1VS|4.0|Sure.  I'm a devoted reader of yore.  I enjoyed the various chapters of Sherlock Holmes.  Recommend it and many other Kindle lenders.

B005DOKL3E|4.0|A bit expensive but well worth having.  I feel much safer with the Coral.  It's much less likely to break or to scratch, and<br />it's also  convenient if I'm using it in another area.

B008M7JODC|5.0|I consider Fringe the new X Files,it's that good. Fantastic story line and great visual style. Dr Bishop is my favorite.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|An amazing job of intertwining the lives of the next generation of the families who were portrayed in Book One.  While being totally wrapped up in their stories, one is getting a history lesson like nothing one could get in a history book.  The reader gets a true sense of the ideologies and passions that can ultimately lead to such a devastating war.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|When I first read the summary, I thought it would be boring to read a story of one guy trying to survive. Boy, was I wrong. Mr. Weir is one smart fellow with a lot of solid education and common sense. I think NASA could really use him on future projects. Besides being blown away by the technology situations, I laughed out load more times than any book in recent memory. I'll definitely be looking for more from this author.

B008GXHOFW|2.0|Not sure if this happens with anyone else, but my main objectives no longer show up on my map. The first time this happened was very early in the game, so I reset my data and started over and it worked fine. Now it has happened again and I'm quite far in the game, not really sure what to do. It's incredibly frustrating.

B003WUYOQ6|5.0|This book explained in detail but also in an easy to understand manner the science behind the low carb diets. It challenges widely held views and really challenged long entrenched views on what makes us fat! Eye opening stuff
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|When I have time to waste, I love this game. It isn't complicated at all. You simply tap and hold the screen to float up with jetpack power. It gets a little hypnotizing while playing. After a great run, I get upset that I didn't do better & HAVE to try again. The challenges give some really fun goals that entice you to keep playing. Good fun!<br /><br />I was a little surprised when my friend told me that you could buy different equipment to make goals easier. I didn't realize there was a shop for the longest time! If you get stuck on not killing scientist with the jetpack, buy a bubble jetpack. It helps greatly!<br /><br />Overall, a great, fun, time passing game. I just get a little tired of doing the same thing over and over and over (just jetpacking to dodge stuff). But I still really enjoy it and recommend for everyone!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Was looking for some post apocalyptic reading that did not have a zombie theme, not easy to do these days. Someone mentioned the Wool books as depressingly awesome. Went with it, they start out a little elements but the writing/ story improves quickly into the second and third books. Just a really refreshing plot and crafted story that ties together well throughout the whole series. Really hope it continues past the Second Shift book. Thanks for the awesome story Hugh!

If you guys are on the fence about this mouse - Climb down and get this mouse.<br /><br />I'm more than impressed with everything this mouse has to offer:<br /><br />-Feels great in the hand - I have big skinny hands and this is the most comfortable mouse i've used.<br />-Buttons respond seamlessly<br />-Lights are pretty as heck!<br />-Button layout is perfect for FPS games - there are two on the back of the mouse that can only be used by lifting your hand and one underneath for switching profiles. The one underneath is not counted as one of the 9.<br />-More control options than most will ever use<br />-Smooth sliding on my mouse pad (cyba snipa tracer)<br />-Custom light colors<br />-braided cable<br />-material feels like a nice grip rubber so your hand does not slide<br />-Buy this<br /><br />Seriously at $39.99 There should be no hesitation.

B009APMNB0|5.0|I have two 24&#34; monitors from two different manufacturers connected to my system and the color difference between the two was driving me crazy. The ColorMunki Smile did the trick and while they're not both perfectly matched, they're close enough that I'm happy. After doing the calibration I thought that I'd probably never have to use it again but when I installed the latest display driver I found the color difference had returned. I was really glad I had the ColorMunki to do a quick recalibration of my screens. I also do quite a bit of rendering on my system and if the customer wants something in blue...I know they're getting blue and not purple. If you do any kind of computer generated art or photo retouching you owe it to yourself and your clients to do the work on a display that you know is setup correctly. This product does the job and does it well without a lot of hassle.

B001EOOQEM|5.0|This was a huge comeback for Black Sabbath and Ronnie James Dio was the shot in the arm that they needed. Their previous albums, Technical Ecstasy and Never Say Die! respectively, showed a band that was running on fumes. Heaven and Hell restored their reputation. The sound was a little different. The driving \\"Neon Knights\\" and parts of \\"Die Young\\" and the title track were faster than anything that the band did with Ozzy Osbourne. This was also the point where Tony Iommi, the master of the slow gloomy riff, started composing leads that were on par with those riffs. His guitar playing is fantastic on this album. As for the songs, everything works as the aforementioned \\"Neon Knights\\" is a killer while \\"Walk Away\\" and \\"Lady Evil\\" are strong mid-paced metal tracks. \\"Children of the Sea\\" and \\"Lonely Is the Word\\" are slower gloomier tracks where Dio truly shines. Other strong tunes include the dramatic \\"Die Young\\" and \\"Wishing Well\\". Finally, the title track is the band's greatest song post-Ozzy, a true heavy metal tour de force where every member shines. In my humble opinion, this song has endured as well as \\"Iron Man\\", \\"Paranoid\\", and \\"Children of the Grave\\" have. Certainly one of their five best albums, Heaven and Hell is a classic metal release that all fans of the genre should own.
B0091REZMW|3.0|Couple levels then you buy TRICK ME AGAIN!!!  Drive it then ditch unless you want to buy it. Hard to see when playing.
B000002L61|4.0|The Last in Line was Dio's second album and the followup to their awesome debut, Holy Diver. While Dio would never reach those heights again (it was the best album that Ronnie James Dio was ever a part of), The Last in Line is still a very good album and it actually raised them higher in the public eye thanks to MTV's airings of the videos for \\"Mystery\\" and the title track. The latter is clearly the album's best song with a memorable lyric and vocal from Dio and a killer guitar solo from Vivian Campbell. \\"Mystery\\" was clearly a shot at the pop charts but it was still a cool and catchy tune. \\"We Rock\\" continued the trend that started with Black Sabbath's Heaven and Hell of starting out albums with a strong pounding metal tune while \\"One Night in the City\\" had a strong melody and lyric. Other solid tracks include the mid-paced rockers \\"Breathless\\" and the epic \\"Egypt (The Chains Are On)\\". The remaining songs (\\"I Speed at Night, \\"Evil Eyes\\", \\"Eat Your Heart Out\\") are just okay but the performances do bring them up a notch. While The Last in Line is not as iconic as Holy Diver and doesn't impress from beginning to end, it's still a very good album and if you like the best of Ronnie James Dio's work, you'll like this too.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|SWIPE THREE GAME. YOU HAVE DIFFERENT LEVELS THEY GET HARDER. GOOD GAME IF YOU LIKE SWIPE THREE. I PROBABLY WOULD'T USE IT FOR A LEARNING EXPERIENCE FOR A CHILD.
B0074MZSWW|1.0|They sold me a bad bootleg, not even a good bootleg! Sounds like it was copied from an 8 track.
B00632HWOG|5.0|This is a good APP to get ECSPECIALLY if you have, or want a free email account. They have just about the same thing as AOL but you pay for AOL, DEARLY. Recommend this APP HIGHLY.
B0083Z614S|5.0|Loved this book.  What a joy to read as an adult.  So many lovely messages and inspirational reminders.  A fast, lovely read.
B0049VQZUA|5.0|Best TV show series, must buy! This shows you its awesomeness! Once, you watch this you will be hooked, trust me.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I LOVE IT!!!<br />My friend has this game on her iphone; but when I first got my kindle they didn't have this game on the appstore. I was very exited when they added this game! I would recommend this game to anyone!
B00358ESI4|5.0|They don't get any better than this.  Realistic, great acting, perfect sound!<br />It's not a movie for kids - the blood looks very real.
B000002O4X|5.0|This is another background music to sit and watch the sun go down, or the lights come up over the lake, and talk about sweet nothings as they did in the movie.  I recommend it very much.
B007QDNKQA|4.0|Kind of like the male version of Salt, although this one was first.  It's pretty action packed with a decent storyline.
B000002PCS|5.0|Every song was relaxing except one, but it was not bad and did not last all that long.  Wonderful and I would recommend it.
1457514508|4.0|Author Duncan Whitehead is, among other assorted hobbies and jobs, a standup comedian and it shows.  Not that this book as a comedy (well, in many instances it is a droll comedy at that) - it is billed as a thriller and there are indeed enough acts of derring-do played out in this wild assortment of characters and enough instances of death and killings and even the opening chapter is an elegy for a gravedigger/to become killer to be slotted as such.<br /><br />But the setting is a rather wonderfully silly shallow group of ladies who walk their dogs in the park in Savannah GA in and around a rich neighborhood called Gordonston. The story isn't all that startling but it is entertaining and there are enough faux pas situations that nearly backfire the plot - until you realize that is precisely what the author is trying to do.<br /><br />Others have commented on the plot, and enough is enough. What this novel pleads to be is a dark comedy on film. And hopefully the author is stepping out of his home in Savannah far enough to encounter a potential producer/director/screenwriter to make it happen. Read it, and you'll be able to cast it easily enough. This is a dandy little escapist novel for an evening's enjoyment.  Grady Harp, February 13
B00B7G3BUW|4.0|Well done. Frank Miller revolutionized a moribund format with his genius. Rescued the legend from degenerating in to irrelevant  mediocrity.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|I had seen the Tv series before. The BD is much better, makes amazing reading. Of course you can discover all kinds of metaphors when you read this marvellous book. For me the story and the drawing are already enough to be hooked to this BD. Hooked is the right word.
B009X2CRMK|5.0|Brilliant, love how Kate ties the past with the present. I can wait to read the next Kate Morton book.
B007THA4FI|1.0|This book is the biggest disappointment I have had from J. K. Rowling.  She must have used up all her inspiration with the Harry Potter books.  Although I have not finished this, I am only continuing to read it hoping that the plot is going to improve or something interesting will happen.  So far it's terrible!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Such a superb series! I am as giddy for this series as the rest of the population is for &#34;The Walking Dead.&#34;
B003Y5USF0|5.0|I love watching storm chasers, but I could never get that close myself. This movie is a great thriller.<br />The tornadoes seem real enough to get your heart pumping. A lot of action & a love rekindled.<br />This movie is a favorite.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is great. Its a great time filler through long car rides especially with children. Make more entertaining games like this! :)
B0082SU98U|5.0|Recommended to everyone. Teaches to make the best of every situation, to see good in people and situations. Shows how valuable a positive attitude is.
B009XY97VC|5.0|totally worth buying, best stuff I've heard in a long time. love two steps from hell can't wait for more
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|This movie is a wonderfully told story about people who are addicts. I know many and this shows exactly what the life of an addict is like. It is very up and down, mostly down and spiraling out of control until one day it final hits them and they see that it is enough. My favorite actor (Denzel) had a very interesting part to play to really make you believe he was an addict and he nailed it in my opinion. The only thing is that sometimes an addict does not wake up and realize what they are doing to themselves and the people around them until its to late. This shows the good ending which in reality is what we all want. Nicely done
B003MOHX8S|5.0|totally worth buying, best stuff I've heard in a long time. love two steps from hell can't wait for more
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I am able to fit my entire kit in this bag.  My Canon T4i, 3 lenses, two hoods, flash, video camera and a small point & shoot camera (I have room for one more lens but at the expense of the hoods).  I have plenty of room for my cleaning kit, spare batteries/w charger and lens filters w/cases.  My tripod mounts easily and the bag distributes the weight evenly across my shoulders and upper back (as you can imagine what it weighs with all the gear loaded).  I use this backpack to carry my entire kit to locations where I don't have to do much hiking/walking.  For those times, I have a smaller backpack that carries two walk around lenses, hoods, flash and batteries.  For my purposes and the price, I love this bag.
B007AYKZBI|5.0|This is an awesome CD!Allison and the conductor got everything just right.Without seeing the trumpet She is useingYou couldn't guess it was a very early one with no valves.Terrific CD to listen to.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|kids like this. different fun activities for them like feeding and clean up. the camera is a favorite with them.
B00AESN8XY|1.0|Great game, had a lot of fun until the nano-virus level. When i reached this level, each time i try to click on a country to start the infection the game sends me back to the kindle menu. 1 out of 10 it sort of works and the infection starts but the transmission, symptom and ability menus are completely empty and the cure starts at 20 percent before i can do anything. i tried to restart n stop the game in the kindle menu and it didn't do anything. :-(
B003Z49LYO|4.0|Just finished reading this book.  The movie was very close to the original story and done very well.  I enjoyed it very much and would recommend to anyone who enjoys period pieces, or just a good story.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|While choosing which program to watch on my Kindle Fire, I kept on passing this one up. Finally, I decided to watch it and it is wonderful! I watched all 4 seasons in a two week period. I wish they did not cancel this series. I did miss Dawn French and Brendan Coyle when they left the series and was pleased to see Dawn French return in the last episode. I highly recommend this TV series.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a great app! im a fan of Temple Run. And Temple Run 2 is TWICE As better! u swing from vines and the graphics are much better and there's a mime!
B008HK3XU4|4.0|I am very satisfied with this product. Nice vibrant purple color. Stands up my kindle perfectly. If I had to make one adjustment or addition, it would be to have a pocket or a velcro tab or somewhere to stick the Stylus (the pen) if a person uses a stylus with their Kindle.
B004HW7JH4|3.0|The actual show itself was amazing, as usual. However, the box in which it came in was a little scuffed up...it wasn't exactly brand new, though it was rated as 'new'.
B005SEYOXW|5.0|This beloved series is a cult classic! If you like any form of science fiction, you will love Firefly. 'Nuff said.
B0091REZMW|4.0|A fun game. Entertaining and unique. I like the theme and the characters.<br />would recommend to someone who likes hidden object games.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|The tragic character was Pat`s dad. In the movie he obtained redemption, in the book he was and remained a tragic figure.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is the best game to help with boredom!! I love to play at work when no one is in.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think this is the best kind of game on my tablet. Mabey the next version could be. Minecraft edition
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|great game but so adicting I can play for hours. it can get annoying when you have to wait 30 seconds to get 1 coin after you run out of your starter coins.
B002SF9YUM|4.0|I have heard and read mixed reviews about this film before viewing it. Some thought it was pretty good while others felt it simply sucked. I'll have to agree with the ones who felt it was pretty good.<br />I'll agree with those who thought there could have been more to the story but despite that, the film overall worked. It is beautifully shot!<br />Now for the acting, you have to remember that Bunuel, Lorca and Dali were 3 very exceptional artists in their own right and those are pretty big shoes to fill in. Especially for the Dali role. Take away the Twilight films and you could say Robert Pattinson has his heart in the right place as an actor. The man took on the lead role in the film Cosmopolis and wasn't bad there either. In an interview, Pattinson mentioned that he has never seen the finished version of Little Ashes. For some reason I don't quite believe that and if it's true then it's a shame because he shows a lot of promise despite some minor flaws in his delivery.<br />The best one was Matthew McNulty as Bunuel and Javier Beltrán portraying Lorca was quite touching and visceral.<br /><br />If you're a fan of those 3 brilliant artists then jump into this film with an open heart because while it's not perfect, it isn't horrible either. If you're a fan of Twilight and you're viewing this film for Pattinson then you should come into it with a very big open heart as this isn't Edward Cullen he's portraying.
0307704610|4.0|So. I just got done reading this book and have only just started the diet. Which is really a paleo diet that I had already learned about but was excited to see that this would basically work with what he is doing.<br /><br />First off, this is a great starting point for someone. I'm not sold on going to the gym only a couple times a week for 30 minutes. I've seen those people - not sold that they're doing better than the people I see there everyday.<br /><br />What I would take away from the book is the science and I would research the actual people who wrote and or did the experiments.<br /><br />I think that this is way over someone's head (mine), if they are just trying to get a bearing on what to do. I really think if you want a full body work out that hits all your muscles, you may need to look into something else.<br /><br />If you have some extra time and some extra cash I would recommend the book - Like I said its a good place to start. I think what I learned here is.<br /><br />-TF explaines you need to focus on your diet. I completely agree. I enjoy that he gets really in depth with how your body reacts to certain things. But you may need to read it once or twice and then do your own additonal research and then its up to listening to your body.<br /><br />-TF recommends kettlebell work outs. I actually believe these are great work outs for core training but I think you also need to hit other workouts as well.<br /><br />-In the end. I feel like I've learned a lot. But lets be honest. It took him years and hundreds of thosands of dollars to find his perfect median or point of diminishing returns. He oversimplifies this process dramatically. He was supposed to make this simple. I'm not going to go and buy a diabetic machine to monitor my glucose levels. Maybe when I become and ultrendurance super star. Maybe. I'm just looking to lose some weight and get stronger.<br /><br />I'll absolutely keep it as a reference guide.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was a great sequel to the first book.  It had so much action and kept you intrigued the whole time.  Left you wondering at the end so I'm now on to the third book.
0802473156|5.0|I purchased this for someone else. She has been reading it and loves it. It has opened her eyse to several things and has improved her outlook on herself and her husband.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I actually saw the movie first.  Didn't think this was my kind of story.  After seeing the move, I just had to read it.  I was amazed how close the movie was to the book.  It was so good I couldn't wait to see what would happen in the next two books.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|i was one upgrade away feom having all the power ups upgraded and it started over when i came back.
B008XKT9FG|4.0|We enjoyed this movie, it was not what it appeared to be in the beginning.  Helen Hunt was truly a &#34;Good Woman&#34; in spite of her lifestyle.  I recommend this movie, might even watch it again.
B00433TO52|5.0|How can you rate the best there has ever been? He has been studied for centuries by students of literature for very good reasons.
B009NX409M|2.0|This movie was very slow moving, thought it would never end.  Also was depressing as it was about breaking up a nice family for &#34;love&#34;.  I don't recommend spending your time watching this movie.  There are many better ones to watch.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Just a little glitchy. Have had to re-install it a couple of times because of startup issues. Luckily, you are given the option to regain your progress when re-installing. Other than that though, a great time waster. Reminds me of when I was little and wanted a horse so bad!
1400069289|5.0|It might sound crazy but what I've learned in this book is helping me change my life step by step and it's working beautifully.<br /><br />I've learned how to stop my bad habits and add good habits. I'm loaning the book to friends and recommending it to everyone.
B009U9S6FI|4.0|A worthwhile read. I have wanted to read something from this author and was not disappointed. He made interesting observations regarding man's coping ability in perverse situations.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It is easy to understand how to play the game, still it challenges your mind and it is fun to play the game
030014332X|4.0|Nice little book that can be read a little at a time. However, I am puzzled that two major events, the Inquistion and Black Plague, are hardly mentioned.
B0012GTZC0|5.0|I have read the &#34;Eye of the Needle&#34; which is translated into Japanese a few years ago. Although it was very interesting, I did not remember the details. I read the original book indeed, I was overwhelmed by deep impression. Ken Follet novels always have wonderfully appealing characters. The origin of the &#34;The Pillars of the Earth&#34; after masterpiece is just here.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|I saw this in the theater and loved it.  Couldn't wait to purchase for home viewing. Great acting sorry to see this series end.
B003O86FMW|5.0|A good read  read with great story l kindle be and many good cliffhanger. I would give Israelis 5 stars.
B005GIS1WA|5.0|I bought this for my kids and have watched it several times after that with my friends because I love the story and the animation is great quality!!!  Highly recommended to kids of all ages!!!
0783225547|5.0|Dante's Peak is a movie I use in my classroom when studying volcanos. It's great to use as a comparison for correct facts to fiction.
B0094OLFUW|5.0|This was another great release from The xx. I was fortunate to catch a glimpse of it when they did the pre-release and I loved it from the start. Awesome buy!
B0076DELIG|2.0|Not Connely,s best novel. Love the Harry Bosch novels read them all, This is not nearly as good.<br />From the begining I knew thr Bosch novels were going in a new direction.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love Temple Run now I can have two times the fun, yay!!!!!!! I really love it my friend loves it so much should wants to take it from me, XD
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|I enjoyed it, but then I lived through the start of the computer and computer game era. I used the systems and played many of the games referenced in the book. If you don't like gaming and don't care about its history, this book isn't for you.<br />The book was fast paced, even thrilling at times.<br />It loses a star for two things: its cartoonish dystopian view and the resulting glibness with which the villains are dispatched at the end. That gave it a young adult feel that disappointed me just that much to take away a star.
B005HEPIDS|5.0|The actors are amazing. The writing is exceptional. This is about a captain and her crew stranded 75 years from home and their perseverance and willingness to adapt to in order to survive no matter what they face. 7 prime time Emmy winner. Loved most every episode though there were a few where it did feel like budget got in the way of production.
B007R108WA|4.0|I didn't expect to like this movie. It was something my wife wanted to watch, and I figured i would spend the time tooling around the net on my laptop. It really drew me in almost immediatly. Very interesting idea and well filmed. The acting was pretty good as well. I would tell friends to check it out.
B003V4JU08|5.0|This Show is really different from NCIS but I really enjoy watching it.<br />Unfortunately, CBS didn't published the following season on BluRay.<br />The picture and sound quality - perfect on this season - are not so good on the next seasons...
B001CO42MU|5.0|I don't think you would be looking at this if you hadn't seen the movie. It's a great story about the highs and lows of a drug dealer. I loved the small part played by Pee wee hermen too! I watch this movie again every few months.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Excellent!  Page Turner. Exciting throughout.  Good suspense and twists. Really enjoyed this book.  Outstanding! Not much else to say! Great!
B003IY49S4|5.0|At almost 2 dollars a CD, this box set is indispensable for the budding jazzhead.  They're all true classic albums, not a junk budget set.  Plus, nearly each one has many bonus tracks.  I bought it just for the fusion stuff but got into so many more of the albums...  Well worth it, plus it's a cool box.
B007THA4FI|3.0|I am reading this now and can't wait to finish.  I bought it for my Kindle more out of curiosity, I should have respected the reviews. I am another who has not read any Harry Potter or seen any of the movies. I finish 98% of what I start to read. I probably will not recommend as a must read. It is well written but the story is sort of predictable.  I get bored with stories about total dysfunction and it is hard to believe a whole town can be this dysfunctional. None of these people communicate.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is a great way to see the battery life on your tablet. Lets you know when to charge the tablet. Lesley
B001NLL93W|5.0|I am writing on behalf of all of the books in this series. I highly recommend! The writer is amazing! The dialogue is witty,doesn't feel too young even though the characters are young, she uses so many great descriptive words and so many words I have had to look up to find out what they mean :) It's no wonder they are making a movie out of this! I actually saw the movie preview and looked it up online to see if it was based on a book and that's how I found this series...it's almost the best way to find a good read...see if they are making a movie and if they are, it must be a good book. The imagination and details in this book is incredible. I think this author blows the hunger games writer out of the water! There are so many great characters to read about and the book bounces around to each character and where they are in the story, so it's never one point of view for the entire book.  Great read!
B0064T6LV8|2.0|My grandkids like to play pinball when they go to arcade's. However this one is very hard not only for them, but me also.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|See review for city of glass. It's a must read! The author has a great talent! I definately recommend this series!
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This is a great book to help people learn to talk to each other so we can understand each other.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Book takes you through early Lincoln politics to his death along with a nice little background on all his competitors.<br />Lincoln choosing all these guys to be in his cabinet even after what a few of them did to him. This book is amazing.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|My husband and I went and saw the movie and enjoyed it. He wanted to read the book to see how close it is to the movie. He is still in the process of reading it and so far has enjoyed it.
B000OJFV4C|5.0|Really enjoyed how easy it was to watch when & where I wanted. Love amazon prime & all its advantages!
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I love everything about this show from the actors, characters, story plot, scenery, and even some props.  I find the stories interesting and educational.  I look forward to the next season!
B004SBQGHS|1.0|The Rovio ads went away... to be replaced by Amazon ads! NOT as advertised. Please remove the ads, or give us a way to hide them!
B006LSZECO|4.0|The book was interesting.  A bit predictable but a quick and engaging read.  I would recommend it to anyone who isn't over analytical with what they read.
B000FVQLQQ|4.0|Eventhough, one part of CD was damaged, I cleaned up and play.  I got very resonable price, so I am OK.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Excellent graphics on Kindle fire, enjoyable game play,requires good memory and some out of the box thinking. Could have made it a little clearer before downloading that it was only a taster though.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|Downton Abbey's second season is not quite as great as the first but it's still good. Some problems were too easily resolved.
1439196834|5.0|This is not a serious book!!!!!<br />This is from the show and should be taken as a joke, and it will be funnier if you watch the show. Do not actually buy this to learn how to pick up women.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Downtown Abbey had an amazing season 1 and season 2 finds itself doing the same.  twists, turns, and subtle treachery and back-stabbing galore. Watch it.. you won't be sorry... really... WATCH it NOW! ; )
B006MW3UZW|1.0|In as much as i have not yet received the item, I'm forced to give it a Zero. 2 more words
B003TJR2HS|5.0|Works great with my iPhone 3GS and iPhone 4 in my 2006 scion xa and 2008 infinity ex35! I can now charge them and use audio in my car.
B0079XNWQA|5.0|MY HUSBAND LOVED THIS CD.  THE ARTIST IS TRULY TALENTED.  AND HE DOESN'T SING SICK LYRICS LIKE YOU FIND ON OVER 60 % OF THE MUSIC TODAY.
B0094K1WZE|5.0|Glad Tom keeps coming back to do these.  Wouldn't be the same without him.  Stunts once again great and the new team worked well.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I don't use many apps on the phone, but this allows me to make lists on my tablet and sync it with my phone to keep organized.
B003XVYLDU|5.0|If you haven't read it read it. This book will stay with you forever even if you don't mean it to.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is truly the best book Ive read it was full of suspense and left you continually wondering what was going to happen next. There were so many twists and it kept you wondering the whole way through I didn't want to put it down.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|Good looking graphics and I love the way the web pages are setup.  Very cool. Easier to read news articles.
B008AIGWVA|2.0|I am not crazy over this game.  It really doesn't do much and is kind of boring.  I would say it is just ok.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love the series... But they've got to end it soon.. Running out of time and and storyline.. And they seem to be down to torturing the remaining characters... Go gently into that sweet goodnight, Dear Downton... And I will watch again..
B004SRPXWQ|3.0|My granddaughter likes playing with Tom the cat.  She likes when it repeats what she says and she finds it funny.
B007R108WA|5.0|Narrated like a Grimm's fairy tale, the vivid photography assists the viewer to smell the good, bad, and the ugly.  Such a different kind of story that makes your jaw drop from the start while you try to put it back in your head the entire way.  Intense, gritty, and fabulous!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Excellent game!  I enjoy this game alot.  I like going after the monkeys for a change instead of pigs.  Lots of fun!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a fun and confounding game. Even my 7 year old grandson runs to play this game, when he comes over.
1469273802|5.0|Goes along with the other Ryan novels.  I just wish there was more! All of Tom Clancy's stories are great.
B000FBJAEG|4.0|I like this book and its plot.  It had lots of action and many twists and turns.  The main characters did not actually have sex; but are going to soon?  I would recommend this book for a weekend read.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I truly enjoyed the first season of Downton Abbey and season 2 is just as enjoyable.<br />Love how the characters interact with each other.<br />Highly recommend.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|Small compact doesn't take up much space in the camera bag. I have used it several times now and it does a great job.
B007W1BLN0|4.0|Nice to see a true story sensitively portrayed.  Very engaging acting and cinematography. Good way to spend a Saturday afternoon.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Wonderful for PBS to have a hit show! This is quality television with captivating drama. Well done to all involved!
B004LROUNG|5.0|A very interesting and good book.  I really enjoyed the book. I enjoyed reading the book. Give it a try.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fantastic. I LoVe it!<br />I never get tired of playing! It is fast paced but never get tired of playing it.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|good value for the price paid. this was a 3 book set and did not cost the same if got the books in a book store. Great value and storage is great all fit in my Kindle
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app not only helps me establish the habit, but provide enormous resources for new believers to grow in Scripture!
B0037NVM1I|3.0|It is ok , This movie has a lot of action and is interesting . But I give 3 stars because it does not keep my attention .
B004T4KQJS|4.0|Our author does a lot to make difficult science immediately understanable, but misses a couple of times mid-book with photons and other --tons.  I have no diea of what they are which made following him a bit difficult.  That was something.<br />Bill
B002ZBZFNY|1.0|wow this movie just olain out sucks . Old show ,dry ,sorry actors ! Just not worth the time.Total wast of time .
B003JTHWJQ|5.0|To think that my generation may only go on for a bilion--or was it a trillion? -- years before the entire universe disappears in the distance is emotionally difficult.  I mean, are the 4 billion galaxies going to heaven?<br /><br />Bill
B008673ZAQ|3.0|I of course found the first book in this series good enough to continue on to the next book in the Crossfire series, but that doesn't mean I enjoyed every moment of this read. I often felt angry at the FICTIONAL characters and did not feel the attachment I felt in series like 50 Shades of Gray or Twilight. However, after a long road of pretty much hating the protagonists the ending makes the up for choices they made. I would recommend it if you got passed the first book and didn't regret wasting your time because why not finish the series you've already started. Enjoy!
B0081SPK0I|2.0|remember this game from the late 70's and it has not changed at all.  No improvements, no enhancements, no changes.  I would not waste your time.
B00846REIS|3.0|I read this book after reading the &#34;50 Shades of Gray&#34; trilogy, so expectations weren't high. Even though I very much enjoyed 50 Shades I wouldn't say it was the best written book but none the less it was VERY VERY entertaining. Bared to You lacked in many ways but if you enjoy this genre or style and want an easy read I would recommend this book.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|I loved this series.  No sex, no violence, no bad language but an intriguing waltz through another time with all of the emotions, loves and betrayals, action and excitement to rival any modern drama.  the poetry of the language and the flow of the accents brings charm and grace to the presentation.

B004J4WNL2|5.0|This book is very well written, five stars to the author for that and the information was wonderful.  I feel this book should be a required read by all teachers, bosses and parents....you'll see why after you read it.  I am telling all my friends about the book and it even has helped in my relationships, thanks Susan for all your hard work.

B006BDHAX0|5.0|This is fun and not too hard at first.  My 6 year old enjoys the first level.  Later levels are a great challenge for people who have played for a while.

B007QDNKQA|5.0|What more can you say - a guy - a gun - and bad guys under acting under the pretense of being<br />true Americans.  The shooter is what we would all want to be!
B001MKQS4O|4.0|Philip Seymour Hoffman deserved the Oscar and more! His ability, to immerse himself into Capote's character, was nothing short of incredible! Overall I thought the film good, but at the end, it left me feeling as if something was missing. Maybe it was that the storyline failed to tap fully into the depths of Capote's own upbringing as it connected with Perry. Can't quite put a finger on it. I will admit, I have not picked up a copy of his book, &#34;In Cold Blood&#34; since the 70's. Perhaps if I had read the book prior to seeing the film, it would have filled in some of those missing pieces. But not enough reason to overlook this film. A must see!
B003LQ3YXU|2.0|I am a fan of British television but this did not measure up. I heard a lot of good things about this show, it even has a cult following, but it lacked the whit and creativity I have seen from the BBC. Simply not impressed. And the fact that the main characters switch so often makes me not want to follow it, this guy is not James Bond.
B006LSZECO|4.0|A little difficult to get into in the beginning but a great read! Want to check out her other books.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Have read almost all John Grisham publications and while this one is a little different than his earlier books it was still very enjoyable reading.
B0085RQLXK|3.0|Like several other reviewers on here, I have been listening to Aerosmith since the 1970's.  They consistently put out good records until the last few.  This one is no exception.  I regard this record the same as I did with Queensrhyche's last record.  It sounds like it could be split down the middle and two seperate records could have been released instead of just the one.  It's disjointed and kind of odd, almost like a collection of old b-sides tracks they never recorded and are releasiing now.<br /><br />The album kicks off with Luv XXX.  It sounds reminiscent of Young Lust from Pump and not as good.  However, like Young Lust its a good album opener.<br /><br />Oh, Yeah -- this is a rockin tune with a sound that's a cross between the Black Crowes and the Rolling Stones.<br /><br />Beautiful -- Not a favorite.  This sounds like it should have been a B-side that was written by American Idol for one of the kids on the show. It shows that he spent too long on that show.  This does not sound like something Aerosmith should be recording at this point in their career.<br /><br />Tell Me -- typical A-Smith Ballad.  Nothing new here to the point that it sounds like Angel from Permanent Vacation.<br /><br />Out Go the Lights -- Like Oh, Yeah, this is a good tune.  Aerosmith should have been the Super Bown Halftime show this year and debuted this song.  It would have been perfect.  IMHO -- Aerosmith are one of few bands that are worthy of doing the SB Halftime show.  Good song.<br /><br />Legendary Child -- This is the best track on the record.  This was clearly written to be a single.  It has a classic Aerosmith sound that makes it unmistakeble who it is.  If you turned on your radio and heard this song from halfway through, you would know who it is.  A new song destined to be a classic.<br /><br />Street Jesus -- They should have left this off the record as a B-Side.<br /><br />In the booklet there is a picture of them crossing a random street on horesback in Anytown USA.This is clearly an homage to the Beatles Abby Road cover.<br /><br />Can't Stop Loving You -- this sounds like another American Idol written track.  Probably something they came up with when Tyler was working on the show.  It brings the entire record down a notch.  Should have been left off the reocrd.<br /><br />Lover Alot -- had potention until he dropped the F-bomb.  They don't need it to write a good song.  That being said, it would have been better if he had not thrown that in.<br /><br />We All Fall Down -- Before I looked at the book, I knew that this was a Diane Warren penned track.  The beginning has her trademark sound.  That does not mean that it's a bad song.  She writes good songs for lots of different artists and they are always good. So is this song and it fits the record perfectly.<br /><br />Freedom Fighter -- Someone tell Joe Perry he can't sing.  Please.  He sounds better than Keith Richards, but not by much.  Musically its a good song.  Loses points for lead vox, though.<br /><br />Closer -- Its okay.  It'll never be considered one of their best songs.  Joe Perry does a good job with a little bluesy guitar on this that saves it.<br /><br />Something -- Another Perry on lead vox track that immediately brings it down.  Would have been a better song if Tyler had taken lead vocals.  It sounds Beatles influenced and fails there, too.  Another case of what should have been a b-side.<br /><br />Another Goodbye -- A good album ender.  By far, not their best.  You can still hear the Beatles influence in the music.  Tyler is showing the cracks in his voice on this song.  He can't seem to hit the high notes anymore.  Another case of a song just being okay.<br /><br />Shakey Ground -- A cool cover of a classic blues song.  Sounds like a hold over from Honkin on Bobo.  I like this.  They should have down a few more of these and left off some of their own tracks from this record.  It would have made for a better CD.<br /><br />Overall, this record is just toolong for a regular release.  This is a major downfall.  Artists who began their careers in the 70's and 80's are releasing new records that would have been double albums when they started.  They really need to stop doing this, because the extra tracks amount to little more than filler.  That being said, I am only giving this 3.5 stars, but their is not enough there to punch the fourth star on Amazon's rating.  I sincerely hope that Aerosmith release another record that will be better than this one.  That being said, it's still Aerosmith.  They are still better than most of the new bands out their today.  These new kids need to listen to some old Aerosmith and learn a thing or two from them.<br /><br />3.5

B006LSZECO|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  Just when you think you know where the story's going, the author throws in a surprise.  My opinion of the main characters vacilated between good, decent, and likable and then in the next paragraph, they became loathsome.  The plot twists kept me page-turning well into the night as the narrative changes from his to her perspective with each chapter.  This book was hard to put down!
