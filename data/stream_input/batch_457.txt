B000687M48|2.0|I had been tempting myself to buy this CD for several weeks, and finally just yesterday I gave into the temptation.  I thought that it might be rewarding considering there are a few songs that do not appear  on the \\"Fallen\\" album, but the entire thing was somewhat of a disappointment. I usually enjoy watching concert footage, but this time it felt somewhat of a drag. However, this item is not going to be one I return, and all I've said may be influenced sheerly by mood.  You may have a different experience than me, so I wish you the best.  Happy Listening.
B000003TA4|4.0|Nirvana are without a doubt the most overated but also the most revolutionary and popular bands of all time. <br /> <br />Nirvana funnily enough being renowned for its electric guitar sound, actually sound better acoustic. <br /> <br />As for Nirvanas, Nevermind album, its really good but musically its nothing enourmously outstanding although all the songs are very good apart from \\"Drain You\\" which I just can't stand. <br /> <br />Nirvanas sound is simple but effective.  <br /> <br />The only problem is songs like \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" \\"In Bloom\\" and \\"Lithium\\" are so horrendously overplayed that I think people are just absoulutley sick of them and don't want to hear these songs ever again, well thats how I feel anyway, and as for this being the best rock album of all time, well it sonly said to be that because the sound of the album is so accessible. <br /> <br />\\"Come As You Are\\" and \\"Stay Away\\" are the outstanding tracks. <br />But if you want to appreciate a whole new sound to Nirvana well gettheir \\"Unplugged album\\", which is actually quite an impressive album. <br />
B00005JNNL|5.0|The rule of thumb is that Life is preferable to Death. But, on your mental scale, what value judgement would tip the balance towards the latter? THE SEA INSIDE is a forceful, emotive and sympathetic examination of assisted suicide. It's not a film for those seeking the usual Saturday afternoon pabulum of Hollywood escapism. And for those that believe that opting out of Life is never an option, it will likely be infuriating.<br /><br />In a Oscar-worthy performance, Javier Bardem plays Ram&oacute;n Sampedro, the Spanish poet who became a quadriplegic at age 26 when he dove into shallow waters and broke his cervical spine. In THE SEA INSIDE, it's now almost three decades later, and Sampedro is spending the last two years of his life petitioning the conservative Spanish government for the right to die with dignity via an assisted suicide. The film is an extraordinarily well acted piece by all members of the cast.<br /><br />The family that cares for Ram&oacute;n 24/7 includes his older brother Jos&eacute; (Celso Bugallo), his brother's wife Manuela (Mabel Rivera), his father Germ&aacute;n (Alberto Jimen&eacute;z), and his nephew Javi (Tamar Novas). Besides the dedicated Manuela, who loves Ram&oacute;n like a son, there are three other extraordinary women in his life: Julia (Bel&eacute;n Rueda, in her acting debut), the lawyer who handles Sampedro's legal case and who has a secret of her own, Gen&eacute; (Clara Segura), the representative of a national right-to-die organization, and Rosa (Lola Due&ntilde;as), the single, working mother of two that just stopped in to say hello to the invalid and ends up adoring him. Indeed, the large number of caring females in Sampedro's stunted life yields perhaps the film's only trace of humor. When jealousies simmer among the gentler sex, Ram&oacute;n discovers that he has women problems.<br /><br />In emotional intensity, THE SEA INSIDE transcends that other recent award-winning film about assisted suicide, THE BARBARIAN INVASION (2003). At mid-point, in a sequence of devastating power, the camera becomes a window on Sampedro's fantasy that he can leave his bed. At another time, Ram&oacute;n's bedridden helplessness is contrasted to the virile, active young man he once was through a series of old photographs examined by Julia. And the visual presentation throughout is mated to a dynamite soundtrack (that I'll definitely purchase!).<br /><br />This production is Spain's entry into the 2004 Academy Award competition for Best Foreign Film. If it doesn't walk away with that golden statue, then I certainly want to see the film that does.<br /><br />THE SEA INSIDE makes a strong case for voluntary Death with Dignity for those wishing that escape. It's certainly controversial, as evidenced by the Web sites attacking its stance. If you're looking for an intelligent, thought-provoking, sobering experience - I hesitate to use the word \\"entertainment\\" - see it as soon as it's released. It will likely remain in the artsy theaters and not go into wide distribution.era becomes a window on Sampedro's fantasy that he can leave his bed.

B0006B29Z2|5.0|Iron maiden fans are in a league of their own. Most of us are truly collectors, you can't have 1 or 2 Maiden CDs in your collection but the whole catalogue! The same applies for VHS/DVD releases. The buzz about this release was just so strong. Disc 1 is all live performances, 1 show with Paul Di'Anno and 2 with Dickinson on lead vocals. Probably the best of the band when they were hungry and still an opening band. The Hammersith show is truly amazing, I have no idea why this was never released at the time. Clive Burr on drums reminds you of what made Maiden strong in the first place, a drummer who played riffs and MADE each song an individual statement. Maiden was never quite the same following his departure. \\"Live at the Rainbow\\" is a little grainy but better than any bootleg version that we had to find for years at the hands of video \\"specialists\\" on ebay or some pricey import. The Dortmund show is from German TV from the World Piece Tour, more great stuff, again found only on ebay before this release. Also, the cameras stay on a band member for a good stretch of time letting the viewer enjoy ths show, unlike the rapid video image fire of \\"Rock in Rio\\". Disc 1 is well worth the price of admission here but wait, there is disc 2. I thought this would just be \\"The First 10 Years\\" rereleased on dvd but it is an entirely new documentary. Extras include never before seen videos from English TV and another gem, \\"Live at the Ruskin\\" with Di'Anno on vocals from the debut album era days. This collection is just so unbelievable and I picked mine up at deepdiscountdvd for under $15! This is truly a great day for us Maiden fans! If you don't have this, don't walk, Run! 6 stars!
B00005QDW5|4.0|The main reason I don't like this compilation is the fact that they took ECHOES, a 23 minute-long, moody, chill-out, absolutely brilliant song, a fan favorite, and cut it up so that it is five minutes shorter.  The editing job was expert; unless you know how the song ought to sound, you won't be able to hear the numerous splices at all.  It was in the various instrumental sections with pretty much repetition that they chopped out one or two phrases here, three phrases there.  For example, in an instrumental section where there was, let's say, six drawn out phrases totaling, let's say, four minutes was edited in such a way that now there are four phrases lasting 2 and a half minutes.  They did this for just about every instrumental jam in the song.  That was the only part of the song a casual listener might not miss, they thought, and that was their reason.  However, I consider this blasphemy!!!  They can't just edit a song that has been perfect for the last 30 years.  And why? so they can fit that throwaway track from \\"Division Bell,\\" KEEP TALKING onto the CD?!?!?  If you buy this CD, be sure to buy the \\"Meddle\\" album along with it.  \\"Meddle\\" has the only version of ECHOES anyone should ever hear.    On a related note, I'm not entirely against editing songs to make them more concise.  ECHOES has been perfect for 30 years, and editing it only reduces its glory.  However, the song, ATOM HEART MOTHER (AHM) could benefit from a professional editing, provided that the band members were involved, and only the tedious parts were cropped to a shorter length.  AHM has several moments of utter brilliance, but there are other sections of the 22 minute song that are too rambly and distract the listener from the magnificent melodies and beautiful orchestration of the rest of the song.  If they edited AHM from 22 minutes down to 15 or 18 minutes, you can bet that I would be praising this \\"Best of\\" CD for brilliance right now instead of bashing it for negligence.      I gave this4 stars because although the music is extraordinary, it really doesn't capture the musical genius of Pink Floyd, which is really what greatest hits collections are supposed to do.  Also, the song selection is at times quite questionable.  A \\"Best of\\" is suposed to be aimed at new fans, but what person has ever enjoyed BIKE, JUGBAND BLUES or THE FLETCHER MEMORIAL HOME on first listen, or ever?  WHEN THE TIGERS BROKE FREE is another one that is very hard to enjoy, being a depressing minimalist ballad about Roger's childhood.  Also, there's too much showcase from the band's last two albums, when more songs from \\"The Wall,\\" \\"Wish You Were Here,\\" and \\"Dark Side of The Moon\\" are wanting (where's HAVE A CIGAR?!?).  SHEEP is an interesting choice too; I think PIGS (THREE DIFFERENT ONES) is far more newbie-accessible, and less weird (something newbies consider about Pink Floyd.  Hitting a newbie with one of the weirdest songs isn't going to get that person more interesteed in the band), but both SHEEP and PIGS have their merits.  CHILDHOOD'S END really should have been included, since it is a really great gem from the most ignored album in the band's catalogue.  Also missing are any tracks from the \\"Atom Heart Mother\\" album (SUMMER '68 especially ought to have been on here), and the song CAREFUL WITH THAT AXE, EUGENE.    If you're unsure about whether or not you like this band, and you want a sampling from each album, this is a good place to start.  However, it's very possible that this will be very scattershot for the first-time listener.  You may like half the tracks, but not care for the rest.
B00004LN16|5.0|I am truly sorry for the angry title, but who in their right mind calls the song Stiff Upper Lip a lame song. It is rediculously amazing, filled with fantastic riffs, and great bluesy solos. The day your favourite band writes a song better than Stiff Upper lip at age 55+, is the day your the president of Iraq.  <br /> <br />Now, I will admit that Brian's voice is a little off but the fact the guy can make noises like that at his age is inconcievable. The Sheer thought of his throat after each song is enough to make you cringe. The Album is one of their blusiest for sure and has some great songs on it, (although there is no thunderstruck or Hells bells).  <br /> <br />Stiff Upper lip - This is easily the best song and is a sure anthem. I love it. 10/10 <br /> <br />Meltdown - Is probably the second best song on the album. very different sound, is quite bluesy and has an interesting and captivating riff. Love the the chanting of \\"Hot\\", Hot\\". 9.5/10 <br /> <br />House of Jazz - this song is wicked, i don't care how anyone insults it. It has one of the coolest riffs DC has every put out. 9/10 <br /> <br />Hold Me back - Alot of people insults this because it is a slower, less powerful song, but it is infact quite nice to listen to, very bluesy.The chorus is cool. 8.75/10 <br /> <br />Safe in Ny - This is what im talking about! Fantastic fast riff that makes it impossible not to tap your foot. 9/10 <br /> <br />Can't Stand Still - Very similar to hold me back. Great bluesy track to listen to. Excellent! 9/10 <br /> <br />Can't Stop Rock and roll - With this one it seems they tried alittle to hard to copy RNR ain't noise pollution. But it is an excellent song none the less. Love the chorus!! 9.25/10 <br /> <br />Satelite Blues - Great clean and crisp riff, that comes with a great sing along chorus. This one's hard to insult although i believe that it has been done here! 9.5/10 <br /> <br />Damned - Actually, this one brings the album down with it, as it is in my opinion the worst ACDC song ever. But it is atleast worth a listen. It's too wierd, I hate the lyrics and singing all together. 5.5/10 <br /> <br />Come and Get It - This one has a pretty catchy riff and a irresistable chorus, but the back ground singing of \\"Come and Get it\\" is kind of Scary. 8/10 <br /> <br />All Screwed up - This song is awsome, you'll be singing it all day after one listen. The Chorus is Sweet! 8.75/10 <br /> <br />Give it up - Great way to finish, an awsome song with an awsome riff, although it is alittle to similar to Satelite blues. 9.5/10 <br /> <br />Overall, when this is averaged out, the total score is 8.81, Which is good, it stands up against legend albums like Back in Black (which, from me, got an average score of 10) or highway to hell (Which from me got an average score of 9.77). other great albums such as High Voltage (9.50), Powerage (9.35) or Let there be rock (9.25) are also recommended.
B00005JNDX|4.0|I never had a sister, but Bridget Jones would be the one I wish I had even if only for the entertainment value.<br /><br />In BRIDGET JONES: THE EDGE OF REASON, our heroine (Renee Zellweger) is an on-air personality for a British telly that specializes in pseudo-journalism. In the first sequence of scenes, Bridget reports live as she parachutes from a plane into a pigpen's excremental bog. Consistent with this, her life is pretty much of a total disaster except for an ongoing affair with a high-powered amnesty lawyer, Mark Darcy (Colin Firth), about whom she dreamily counts the days, hours and minutes of their relationship as well as the number of times they've &#34;shagged&#34;. The wildcards are Rebecca (Jacinda Barrett), Darcy's assistant, both elegant and gorgeous - attributes not to be associated with Jones - with whom Mark may also be dallying, and Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant), an old boyfriend who still lusts after what's inside Bridget's &#34;giant panties&#34;.<br /><br />Bridget's engaging persona is established in BRIDGET JONES DIARY (2001). Though the original was perhaps a better film, neither it (nor this one) are the comedic fluff of which indelible cinematic memories are made. Therefore, by default and my failing memory, THE EDGE OF REASON must stand on its own merits. (Perhaps the two are best seen together when they're eventually released as a DVD set.) In any case, I've always had an objection to any appearance by Colin Firth, which always results in an on-screen character, in my opinion, totally devoid of charm or humor. Perhaps he reminds me to much of myself:&#62;) (Only in a 1996 film adaptation of Jane Austen's PRIDE AND PREJUDICE did this formula work for me.) Hugh Grant, here a charming rascal that could well be my alter ego, has only a subordinate role. Too bad.<br /><br />Bridget certainly has pluck, best depicted when, after being arrested in Bangkok for drug smuggling, she becomes the song coach and darling of a jail cell-full of Thai prostitutes . Ok, ok, that subplot was a bit of a stretch by the screenwriters, but it works for her. My biggest problem with Jones is that I can't see her in a romantic (or even prurient light), so her triangular relationship with Darcy and Cleaver remains, for me, unconvincing. It's a chemistry thing.<br /><br />I hope Zellwegger, at the risk of being typecast, consents to do another episode in the series. Despite my reservations and chemical imbalance, they're good fun.subplot was a bit of a stretch by the screenwriters, but it works for her.

B00005JNBQ|5.0|How could anyone dislike this movie? this not only was the funniest movie of the year, but maybe in my opinion one of the funniest i've seen in a few years. for all those who say its got a young mtv humor I think your unhappy in your own personal life. Its good to see a movie like this come up from nothing and strike it big, not only did it have one of a kind humor but its nothing like you have seen in any other comedy you may have seen. You and your buddies will be quoting this one for a while. P.s any movie that can make my dr. pepper shoot from my nose is well worth the dvd purchase.
B0002IVN9W|4.0|The Arcade Fire is a very promising act. To they sound like if you mix very old Talking Heads with classic british Wave band Sad Lovers And Giants. Then you add a little canadian flavour from the likes of Stellastarr or even the Spoons as well as some more poppy elements. Then shake it all well and enjoy. That's the best Funeral you can get. Believe it or not! I especially recommend track no. 9 or 1.

077106506X|2.0|Working in a bookstore, and being an avid reader of Canadian fiction, I've always wanted to read Alice Munro's short-story collections because of her international reputation as one of Canada's literary treasures. After &quot;Runaway&quot; won the Giller, I put down everything I was reading at the time and decided to finally acquaint myself with Munro's writing once and for all. The first story, the title story, I rather enjoyed. But then it was all downhill after that. After the fifth story I just gave up. I couldn't go on. The stories were well written, there's no question, but I'm afraid there wasn't much &quot;story&quot; in this short story collection at all. And the titles, all single words (Chance, Passion, Silence...), in a way mocking pretentious titles of bad fiction, when in fact the mockery doesn't seem intended at all. If it is, it's not reflected in the pieces. And I wanted so badly to like this collection. I just don't see what all the fuss is about. I will definitely give Munro another chance sometime in the future, because her accolades practically command it. But at the moment, I must admit, I'm both perplexed and dismayed at my response to this latest offering from an obviously very talented writer. Oh well.
B00008EY65|3.0|...without driving each other crazy...(cue \\"Odd Couple\\" theme)...<br /><br />A doctor stops a Nazi plot to take over the world in the 1940's, then finds and raises the product of their failed plot:  Hellboy.  Hellboy grows into a musclebound, red jaw with arms.<br /><br />This guy has a jawline that could cut diamonds!...Hellboy's giant jaw could have been a character all it's own in this movie...I bet, in college, not a beer can went un-crushed by his collosal jaw...<br /><br />ANYWAYS...Call me crazy, but this movie had a touch (an extremely SMALL touch) of Indiana Jones-y happenings in it.  The last bit when they were in that stone palace place, and the stone doors kept closing, and bone crushing pendulums kept swinging and crushing stuff and things...I liked it.  Superhero movies always make me feel warm inside, even if the Marvel Company is a giant whore.  In this one, Hellboy is trying to save the world by stopping a newly ressurected guy from Russian history from destroying the earth and creating a new one.  To stop this evil, the government enlists the help of a giant, threatening-looking devil-man.  The movie has so-so effects, but also has a super-cool Nazi robot that almost makes you want to become a facist for his COOL ARM SWORDS!<br /><br />With the help of a scrawny \\"Creature from the Black Lagoon\\" type guy and a girl who can burn things when she is beaten, the three all share their own place, and try to stay out of trouble with Mr. Roeper.  Hellboy:  Good.  Consider this if you've got nothin' better to do.
B000696PWC|5.0|As an American... I will not Salute Kylies retirement... Kylie has great talent and vocal abilty... That would knock down Cher, and Madonna put together... And when has Courtney Love ever been considered anything, besides a total joke... Mondanna has been quite vulgar, along with Courtney Love... I have found both of them to be distasteful... Presenting a dirrty image, which someone brought to the U.S in a whole nother view... ( Christina Aguilera )... And the Americans seem to like to support artist who Lip Sync... Ashlee Simpson, and Britney Spears... So... And in America, people seem to lean towards that more of the enertainment value, besides the actual singing ... Maybe not all... But if anyone ever considered Courtney Love above Kylie... Their crazy... I've heard Kylie sing live... She is amazing... She sounds better in person than on her recordings... And what's really important, it's about who can actually sing... Kylie certainly can sing... ( And as a quote from Kylie her self, you cannot fool a Live Audience ) Kylie has projected a classy and very mature image...Even from back in 80's until now... And I believe even other arist could only strive for what she presented... (Instead of being so dirrty)... :-P There are artist I believe should be more well known... Such as... ( Deborah Cox, Kaci, Amber, Kristine W, Tamia, and Samantha Mumba )... But they are just not known well in the U.S... I don't understand why, my only understanding is that, People go more by image and, the buzz that is created by the artists actions, than actual singing talent... But, from hearing and watching Kylie sing and perform.... No one should even put her in a category of Cher, Madonna, Britney Spears or Courtney Love... That is a joke.
B00003CWL6|5.0|Are you looking for a movie that you can relate too? Well, here is the movie to see American Beauty. This movie is rated R because it has an intense sex scene, and sexual, drug, and profanity content. This movie won five academy awards in 1999. It stars Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Thora Birch, Allison Jenney, Peter Gallagher, Mena Suvari, Wes Bentley, and Chris Cooper. Everyone can relate to at least one of the characters and to the desire of temptation in the movie.  <br /> In the movie, they take an ordinary suburban middle class family and analyze it. The movie has an average family, the mother Carolyn, father Lester, and a daughter named Jane. Lester is a middle age man who is raging against the dying light. Carolyn is frigid and furious, but is incredibly vulnerable and lost. Jane is impassive, unreadable, and mad at the world. <br /> During the movie, Lester is going through a mid-life crisis. His wife deprives him of emotional, physical, and \\"sexual\\" love. His daughter and he are growing apart, which makes him very weary. He starts to look at his life and realizes he was not happy anymore. At this point, he starts to realize he has the power to turn everything around-and he does. <br /> For an example, during the movie he quits his job and blackmails his boss for a whole year's salary. He then buys the car of his dreams. After that he decides, he wants to work for a burger joint because it reminds him of his good old days. While trying to regain his formative years he starts smoking pot and working out.  <br /> The artistic symbolism grabs onto any artistic views and pulls you in. It shows how people imprison themselves in cages while hoping for escape. It is a black comedy including mystery and twists. One artistic symbolism, materializes as each character has their moments of solitariness. The rose petals gave it a beautiful yet lull way of expressing the desire of temptation. <br />
B00004U2EZ|5.0|Even if you don't know French, the music and the performers are exquisite.  Being a French major, I just recently translated the lyrics, and I was surprised at how more beautiful it sounded.  The story was wonderfully adapted into a musical and the performances are absolutely stunning.  Among my favorites are Patrick Fiori's \\"Dechire\\", Daniel Lavoie's \\"Tu vas me detruire\\", Garou's \\"Dieu que le monde est injuste\\", and of course Noa's \\"Bohemienne\\" and \\"Vivre\\".  Another song that one might overlook because it's her only song on the album is Julie Zenatti's \\"La monture\\", which I believe is the best song on the entire album.  Overall, I would say this is the best musical soundtrack I have ever heard.

B0002VEPRQ|5.0|Year after year hundreds of films are planned, sweated over, made, publicized, released, and forgotten.  Most of them are made with the sincere hope and belief that they could possibly catch a bit of the kind of movie magic that this classic family film is absolutely overflowing with.  There truly is something for everyone in \\"Mary Poppins,\\" and it is indeed \\"practically perfect in every way.\\"<br /><br />Julie Andrews, at the height of her career, and Dick Van Dyke at his, star in one of the few Hollywood musicals where you never consciously notice that the characters are actually bursting in song whereas you and I would simply continue to speak.  That's how smooth and seamless the film is, and how brightly artful the whole thing is done.  The delightfully loony characters include a retired admiral who, atop his house, thinks he's at sea; a lovable old Uncle Albert who giggles himself literally into the air (really the only sequence in the film that seems tacked on, perhaps forced a bit because they wanted classic '50s comic Ed Wynn in the film); an aged banker who seems like he would collapse into dust if he fell to the floor (that's Van Dyke in lots of pancake makeup in a dual role); and the friendly neighborhood constable, played by Arthur Treacher (does anyone else remember Arthur Treacher's Fish & Chips restaurants?).<br /><br />The kids won't notice all that, they'll just be swept away by little Jane & Michael's adventures.  They'll identify with the kids having parents who are too busy to spend as much time with them as they might like, as well as the idealism of youth clashing with the practicality of grownup life, and they'll be enchanted by the magic nanny who flew in on a puff of wind.  The adults will be touched by the children plaintively trying to get their needs across to their parents (especially stodgy Daddy) and it's a hard-hearted grownup indeed who comes away from \\"Mary Poppins\\" unchanged in their feelings toward their little ones.  To top it alloff, Julie Andrews is appealingly very pretty, which doesn't hurt one bit, from the male perspective.<br /><br />As an adult I often list such diverse films as \\"Local Hero,\\" \\"Monty Python and the Holy Grail,\\" the \\"Lord Of the Rings\\" trilogy, \\"AI,\\" \\"Fiddler On the Roof,\\" \\"Airplane!\\" and \\"Bagdad Cafe\\" among my favorites.  Shame on me for often failing to include this, easily my favorite Disney film.  This DVD also has beaucoups of features that are an absolute treasure, and the reasonable price makes this a must-own item.  Hope Santa remembers that I did put up a stocking this year....
B00068IOWM|5.0|Fantastic album that gets better and better the more you listen to it.  Fast Cars is a great bonus track only included on the special edition.  DVD includes a good documentary about three songs and includes great studio acoustic videos for Vertigo and Sometimes You Can't Make it On Your Own.  Book is more of a Lennon-esque keepsake for die-hard fans.   <br /> <br />I'm surprised at some of the negative reviews as this is definitely a very consistent album.  It has some of the grace of All That You Can't Leave Behind with some of the rock and experimentation reflective of their early albums.  Learning the details and background to some of the songs makes them even more enjoyable. <br /> <br />Comparing albums to each other is not always the best way to evaluate them, but this one ranks up there near Achtung, Joshua Tree, and ATYCLB.

The cinematography is beautiful, the whole film has a dream like quality, and Julie Delpy's voice is a gift.  The script is beautifully written.

Sadly, the movie hasn't been on print except for a recent DVD release, but the price was a bit too much for us so we decided to rent the library copy.  Although this one was almost as worn out as our own, my son enjoys this movie everytime he watches it and is now patiently waiting for a future DVD release.  A must have for anyone who enjoys a good children's film.

Songs like Edge of a Broken Heart, Last Chance Train, The Fire Inside and Open All Night would have surely complimented a number of Bon Jovi`s prior releases. This is a brilliant collection. As any true Bon Jove fan knows, this is not surprising though, coming from a band who has really withstood the test of time through their ability to adapt to the everchanging music scene. Can`t wait for the new album and tour in 2005!!!
B00001NFCY|4.0|My favorite song on this cd would have to be \\"FACELESS MAN\\". I just like it. It also has some other songs that are neat if you are a CREED fan. I'm not sure what to say, but......what IS there to even say {or type} about this cd? Every song is cool and.......well, it's Creed at least: <br />                       1. A nice way to start off the album <br />                       2. WHAT IF WHAT IF WHAT IF I.... <br />                       3. Sounds like romance to me, bub! <br />                       4. Not bad <br />                       5. READ #4 <br />                       6. Again I stand..... <br />                       7. READ #5 <br />                       8. This has been on the radio. Cool, huh? <br />                       9. CAN YOU TAKE ME HIGHER? <br />                      10. It's not #6, but average <br />                      11. A better way to end the album <br /> <br />           Overall, it deserves four stars because it's not bad, but it's Creed. It's cool and it can feel pretty good. You can possibly learn something if you listen to this, but if you don't happen to fancy this band, that's fine too. I understand. This review has been my opinion. I was hoping \\"IS THIS THE END\\" would be on this album, but the music by itself is fine rock music.
B000002JOH|5.0|I really cannot believe this.  I was already feeling down on this day, being the anniversary of John Lennon's death, and this really put me over the edge.  The fact that people can do this kind of thing really makes me sick.  Dimebag, we'll never forget you for the great music and great times you've given us.  Rest in peace, man.
B00005JNEI|5.0|While people have and will continue to villify this movie because of it's style, the essential facts have been well-documented and referenced.  Unlike those who criticize it for non-specific \\"distortions\\" for \\"falsehoods,\\" thoughtful people will recognize much of the material as what they already knew and discover that the essential picture Michael Moore created was and remains intact.  This is a scathing indictment of the failure of the administration to act and then to act in a manner consistent with the maintainance of political power, not the security of the United States.  Fahrenheit 9/11...freedom is still burning.
B000065Q5V|3.0|like the first half of the cd, that's it... i bought it for the first song, which i kept playing over and over, i think people should listen to the lyrics, not just to the beatd... i'm not sure i'm gonna buy another of their cd's though
B000687M48|2.0|As a huge Evanescence fan, I was hoping to hear all the songs I love, Amy Lee's amazing voice, plus the energy of a live setting.  This album bombs on all counts.  She sounds terrible and is off key almost all the time.  The instruments sound flat and are frequently inaudible.  I would complain about the songs that were left off the cd, but considering how bad the ones they did play sound, maybe it's better they didn't further embarrass themselves.  This cd is so bad I wish I could get a refund.  Skip it and don't let the disgraceful versions of these songs cloud your memory of what the songs were meant to sound like.
B00005Y228|4.0|I still love this album as much as when I bought it.  It's a great piece of work.  It picks me up, it's fun, playful and sexy.  I love it!  I wasn't able to give it 4.5 stars, but I would if I could.  Kylie is one of the best dance artists out today.  She is definitely an example on aging well and entertaining the crowd with no b.s. pretenses.      This is a very good follow up to Light Years even if Light Years is my all time fave.  My favorites on Fever are Can't Get You Out Of My Head, Love At First Sight and In Your Eyes.    Some people knock the album for lacking depth and being obviously retro, but this isn't Dido we're talking about.  Kylie cuts some real kickin dance music and the main prerequisite for a great dance album is the production.  If you don't have good producers, your album's gonna suck, even if you sing like Amber.  I think Kylie's great at what she does in the dance genre.  She puts you in a good mood and the beats are good enough to keep you coming back for more.    So if you wanna dance and have a good time, this is the album.  But if you want something a little more substantial that makes you want to dance, I suggest you look into the bossa nova/electronica music's that's been out recently.  A few names that come to mind is Bebel Gilberto, Suba, Cibelle and Rosalia De Souza.  There are other's but I don't know all of their names.  They are Brazilian and usually don't sing in English so keep that in mind when looking to make a purchase.        Enjoy!
B00006879E|5.0|This CD has been in rotation for a while in my stereo, and for good reason.  The haunting melodies, sincere protestations of either lost love or promised love, and the catchy hooks that I can't get out of my head instantly hooked me.  I was instantly mesmerized upon hearing their outrageously original song \\"Harder to Breathe\\" and had to pick up this album.  Although the songs center around love and its inevitable complications, the subject matter never tires.  Songs like \\"Sweetest Goodbye\\" offer declarations of someone who \\"never has to be alone/when you get home\\" while others like \\"Not Coming Home\\" claim, \\"When you answer the door/pick up the phone/you won't find me cuz I'm not comin' home.\\"  Heartbreak, angst, and head-over-heels love abound in this CD, and the sweetest melodies bring the songs to life.  I could easily imagine an album like this finding time spinning on a college radio station, but their anthems should reach out to almost everyone.  Definitely one of the most original works I've heard in a long time, and I cannot sings its praises enough.  Go out and pick up this album, put it in your stereo, and lay back for a musical journey that will tickle ALL your senses.

B000024KBZ|5.0|I used to think that the best Duran Duran album was 'Rio'.  That opinion has changed.  In part due to it wearing out its welcome with repeated listening, in larger part due to 'Big Thing'.   <br /> <br />This was probably the Duran album that I was most indifferent towards when I first heard it.  But over time it has proven itself to be a masterpiece of pop craftsmanship.   <br /> <br />'Big Thing' was released in 1988 when the popular music world was starting to tire of Duran and was largely slept on.  However, of all of Duran's 80's releases, this is perhaps the only one that manages not to sound dated and holds up today.  There is lush balladry ('Palomino', 'Land'), solid uptempo numbers ('I Don't Want Your Love', 'All She Wants Is'), and great pop songwriting ('Too Late Marlene', 'Do You Believe In Shame').  Nothing is overstated on this album save for the title track.  All of the album's tracks work seamlessly together for an ethereal listening experience. <br /> <br />This is the album that demonstrates the soul of Duran.
B000001FKY|5.0|Def Leppard's Hysteria was their first album after the tragic car accident which left their drummer Rick Allen with one arm. Before this unfortunate incident, the band was riding high on the success of their first #1 album Pyromania which vaulted them to superstar status and made them the unquestioned kings of hard rock. But Def Leppard would not be denied. Using a custom made electronic kit, Rick Allen would continue to not only drum for the band but also become their inspiration. With producer Mutt Lange manning the boards, the band would alter their sound more towards a pop direction while still maintaining some of their metallic crunch. Lead singer Joe Elliott also toned down his vocals and began singing in a more intelligible and softer tone than his previous raspy voice ala Brian Johnson from AC/DC. As a result, the band did the near impossible. They released an album that would be even more successful than Pyromania spawning 6 huge hit singles. Also, worth noting is that this album helped revolutionize the music industry with both its glossy production and its album length at 63 minutes at a time when most albums were still around 45 minutes long. These aspects would lead to longer and more polished albums in general for most popular music.<br /><br />The songs presented here are nearly all top notch with the best featuring catchy hooks that were instantly recognizable and stayed in your head for years upon hearing them. The tracks \\"Pour Some Sugar On Me\\" and the ballads \\"Love Bites\\" and \\"Hysteria\\" were huge hits and still sound great. \\"Armageddon It\\", \\"Animal\\", and \\"Rockit\\" were also top 20 hits and feature memorable riffs and catchy choruses. What really makes the album work though is that the some of the remaining songs were on the same level as the hit singles. \\"Don't Shoot Shotgun\\", the heavy rock of \\"Run Riot\\", and the catchy \\"Excitable\\" are all very strong tracks. Truth be told, the mid-tempo ballad \\"Love And Affection\\" was a better song than \\"Love Bites\\" or the title track and could have been another huge single if they chose to release it. \\"Gods Of War\\" is also a strong track featuring several memorable riffs and never gets repetitive or boring despite its 6 1/2 minute length. The opening track \\"Women\\" is also very good although it's carried more by its stellar production than its content. While I believe that Def Leppard peaked early on with the High N' Dry and Pyromania albums, this is still a prototype for pop-metal and the band would never come close to reaching these heights again. Highly recommended.the title track and could have been another huge single if they chose to release it. \\"Gods Of War\\" is also a strong track featuring several memorable riffs and never gets repetitive or boring despite its 6 1/2 minute length.

B0002OERI0|5.0|Contrary to what some people are saying, this is a tremendous album. If your only criteria for judging music is that it doesn't sound like punk or the band sold out, then you are the American Idiot.  This is a great album; more than a bunch of songs.  Just buy it.
B000062YAZ|1.0|Let me start off by saying that i love heavy metal music and heavy metal music is a huge part of my life, but this is just trash. I have tried over and over again to get into this band and this album but i can't because this isn't music for a sane mind. In fact the more i try to listen to slayer the more i laugh at the hilarious lyrics that sound like they were written by mental teenagers. Let's not forget the vocalist now this guy sounds like a bloated pig who's had one too many beers and is drunk as hell(MAYBE THAT'S WHY HE LIKES SINGING ABOUT HELL SO MUCH). This is without a doubt one of the worst bands i've ever heard not just in metal but in any kind of music. This is the kind of band that gives heavy metal a bad name, no passion no quality in this band. People who are giving this album 5 stars must enjoy listening to animals dying,because that's what this sounds like. My suggestion is only listen to this album if you want a good laugh but don't listen for too long or you'll risk having some serious brain damage.
B00068IOWM|5.0|U2 abandoned the lemon and went back to basics on their last (ATYCLB) album. It sold 11m and re-established them as \\"the best band in the world\\".  <br /> <br />HTDAAB is even better and though I'll reserve final judgement until a few more listens, I put it in the U2 top three (along with Actung Baby and Joshua Tree).  <br /> <br />This is U2's rock album - Edge's guitar dominates throughout - with lemons a distant memory!  <br /> <br />Personal rather than political sentiment dominates Bono's lyrics this time around; he reflects on the recent death of his father on both Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own and One Step Closer.  <br /> <br />None of the 11 core songs ('Fast Cars' is a bonus track) are duds making this the first U2 album without a song I want to skip. The opener, the iPod anthem Vertigo is the first single, but more than half of the remainder would also make decent singles: Miracle Drug, Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own, City Of Blinding Lights, All Because of You, One Step Closer, Original Of The Species, Yahweh.  <br /> <br />I got the collectors (CD, DVD and Book) edition today as a present - it was nice of U2 to release it on my birthday! Now I can't wait to hear this material live and won't be disappointed if U2 decide to include the whole album on the next tour!  <br /> <br />
B00028HBKC|5.0|Why is the  story of Jesus such a controversial topic? The story of his life, death, and resurrection is not only biblical fact, but is also said to be proven as more historically accurate every day. Passion of the Christ is  a film worth watching no matter who you are or what you believe, because no matter what you believe it's an interesting story, this film is visually stunning, and by watching you, yourself become educated. Although these agreements may be strong, is it enough to get an atheist to view the film. <br />  <br />      The story of Jesus Christ is a very interesting story no matter if you believe it's true or not. Jesus was said to be a man who was born of a virgin named Mary. God sent  Jesus in human form to earth to take away the sin of the world, and this was accomplished by being brutally beaten then nailed to the cross, to die. The depth of this story is so intriguing and amazing, how could one not be interested in seeing what this Jesus guy did for the world. <br />  <br />       Passion of the Christ is a very unique film. The story of Jesus' death is very violent and graphic and to be able to capture a very small degree of that pain and struggle and put it in a form of entertainment for people, makes it very surreal. The gore in this movie is incredible, the effects look so real and painful that it makes you feel like you are sitting there watching in person as it happened. Being able to capture such life like graphics in a film about a proven existence of a man, is just another reason to watch this movie.  <br />  <br />      Educating yourself is very important especially on such a controversial topic. This allows you the upper hand when it comes to a debate about that topic. Watching the Passion of the Christ, is feeding yourself information on how other people tend to see these types of events. By taking apart of this you can make your argument stronger regardless the side you are on. So What if you  have no desire to watch it? Then doso because this story tends to come up when speaking of world history, and the things this world has faced in a short time. <br />  <br />      The story of Jesus Christ is a very controversial topic, because of a persons own beliefs. By taking the time to watch Passion of the Christ, you are seeing a very interesting story, seeing unbelievable special effects, and educating yourself on a topic that you may or may not know very much about, Passion of the Christ is a film worth watching for those reasons, so no matter who you are or what you believe why not become familiar with the story of Jesus and see his life and death in a film for a short while out of your busy day.
B000000OUJ|5.0|The GZA/Genius drops as the 4th Wu-member to drop a solo (I'm not considering his 1988 \\"Words From The Genius\\" which sold around 12,000 copies).  As with all the early solo Wu projects RZA handles all the production, and it is his best solo to date (even though his next 2 are still very good albums).  A lot of the Wu is on here as well as some Wu-affiliates.  There are 1 or 2 average tracks, and 2 classics on it, the rest are very good (as well as an average Killah Priest solo), it is a must have album for any rap fan. <br /> <br />#1 - 8.5 (Long intro before the song) <br />#2 - 8.5 (f/ Ol' Dirty {R.I.P.} & Inspectah Deck) <br />#3 - 8 <br />#4 - 9 (great beat) <br />#5 - 8 (f/ inspectah deck & street life) <br />#6 - 7 <br />#7 - 10 (classic -- f/ ghostface killah, rza, killah priest -- great beat) <br />#8 - 10 (Method Man has 2 verses & GZA has 1 -- GREAT BEAT -- one of the best songs ever) <br />#9 - 9.5 (good beat & story but a LONG intro) <br />#10 - 8 (f/ Raekwon, ghostface killah & U-God) <br />#11 - 8 (f/ Killah priest) <br />#12 - 6.5 <br />#13 - 7 (Killah Priest solo)  <br /> <br />Gary Grice -- b. 8/22/66 -- Staten Island, NY <br />check all my reviews
B00003CWTI|5.0|Regret, abandon, resentment, and the inescapable power of emotion are just a few of the themes that Paul Thomas Anderson attempts to express in his three hour film Magnolia. The film follows the lives of several characters, some connected to each other through family or occupation, others connected far less explicitly. Magnolia delivers a bittersweet message about human relationships and existence: that you are not alone in the world, but the bonds you share with others are not necessarily pleasant, or even desired. <br />Anderson seems to emphasize two aspects of film in Magnolia: the complete and uninhibited expression of his characters and the emotional connections those characters share with each other. Through long, uninterrupted shots of character dialogue, he conveys the intensity of humans putting their more buried feelings on display. When Julianne Moore's character condemns the pharmacists for judging her, the camera never cuts to their reactions. When Philip Baker Hall, a TV quiz how host dying of cancer, reveals his past affairs and mistakes to his wife, the audience does not see her until Hall is finished speaking. In situations where camera cuts would have allowed the audience to see the stunned or anguished reactions of the listeners, the camera instead remains fixated on the character that is speaking. What is achieved by this technique is an in-your-face glimpse into the depths of human beings, one which deserves undivided attention. <br />While the importance of human expression is clear enough in Magnolia, the relevance of certain characters and character relationships is not so obvious. By juxtaposing seemingly unrelated characters with each other, Anderson seems to imply that although people may not be connected through plot or circumstance, everyone is connected through feeling and emotion. Twice in the movie the story pauses as each character is caught in completely different situations, but somehow each of them is feeling the same sense of loneliness, or despair, or hope, all at the same moment. The audience perceives that a nave and benevolent policeman and a resentful, cocaine-addicted shut-in can share an emotional bond that exceeds their opposing circumstances. More subtly, the connection that Philip Seymour Hoffman and the Seduce and Destroy hotline man - both of them have suffered the emotional anguish of seeing someone dying of cancer - stresses the undeniable significance of personal bonds between the most unlikely, and in some cases unnecessary, of human beings. Magnolia suggests that you can meet a stranger in a bar, on the street, or over the phone, and no sexual, social, or political disparities can overshadow the emotional bond that two people can share. <br />
B00000K0T8|5.0|The 5th member of the Wu to drop a solo album, and my favorite of his solo projects.  The sound and lyrics ain't as goofy as his newer stuff either.  This heavily features Raekwon (on 12 of the 17 songs), much like Ghost was heavily on Rae's first solo album.  Cappadonna is also on 5 of the songs.  On 2 of the songs Ghost ain't even on them, but this is still one of my all time favorite albums.  As with all of the early Wu projects, RZA produces all of the songs exceptionally I might add, except one which is done by Mathematics and the production is GREAT thoright he whole album.  A lot of the songs have a long intro before them, but they are not really all that bad.  Ghost puts in 3 solo's out of the 15 he's on.  There is only 1 song that I skip, about 6 classics, and the rest are good or great.  A must have rap album.    #1 - 10 (classic -- f/ raekwon & cappadonna -- has 1 minute intro b4 the song)  #2 - 10 (classic dirty song)  #3 - 8 (Raekwon solo)  #4 - 9 (f/ raekwon)  #5 - 9.5 (RZA, masta killa, Inspectah Deck & Raekwon -- no Ghost)  #6 - 8.5  #7 - 10 (classic -- f/ U-God, Masta Killa, Rekwon, and a long verse by Cappadonna -- also on \\"Don't Be A Menace...\\" sndtk)  #8 - 9 (f/ method man & street life)  #9 - 10 (classic -- f/ Raekwon & Cappadonna)  #10 - 9 (slower song -- f/ Raekwon & Cappadonna)  #11 - 10 (classic upbeat song -- f/ Cappadonna & Raekwon)  #12 - 6 (f/ Raekwon)  #13 - 8.5 (f/ U-God & Raekwon)  #14 - 10 (classic w/ great beat -- f/ RZA, Raekwon)  #15 - 8.5 (deep song f/ MAry J.

B00005ATQD|5.0|The characteristics labeled of most Stanley Kubrick films hold true for his final film Eyes Wide Shut - bizarre, uncomfortable, haunting, and either brilliant or dreadful, it all depends. Eyes Wide Shut has a poignant musical score that forbids you to remove yourself from the action, and bold cinematography and camera movement that makes the most mundane scenes absolutely breathtaking. For his final film, Kubrick rounded up the most fitting actors for the job; treated each shot purposefully and individually; and still managed to produce a film that did justice to his entire career - a film that has inspired a lesser but devoted following and divided critics worldwide. <br /> Eyes Wide Shut follows Dr. Bill Harford - the main character of the movie, but hardly a dynamic one; he acts more as a guide than a real character - into different dimensions of New York life. Prompted by the confession of his wife that she nearly cheated on him a year ago, Bill wanders into a jazz club, an elitist orgy, and a prostitute's apartment, eventually returning to the solace of his own home. <br /> Throughout Bill's adventures, the gripping musical score enhances the already suspenseful action and prevents any sort of dull sedation in the audience. The chilling, single piano notes simultaneously mimic the pace of a beating heart and the tingling of a spine. <br /> Kubrick's profound understanding of color and composition are stunningly revealed in the film. Ordinary home interiors are brought to life by the dramatic contrast of deep blue windows and bright Christmas trees. In the scene where Dr. Bill and Ziegler discuss the previous night's peculiar occurrences, the library in which they are talking is saturated by the blood red pool table, the green overhanging lamps, and once again, the blue windows. When Dr. Bill moves around the pool table in the beginning of the scene, he becomes centered perfectly in one of the windows, much like Alice Harford, his wife, is framed in the bedroomscene when she confesses her past desires.  <br /> Perhaps lacking the unforgettable performance of Jack Nicolson in The Shining or the appalling behavior in A Clockwork Orange, Eyes Wide Shut could be shrugged off as just another weird Kubrick movie. But the presentation of his material, even if the material itself isn't as memorable, is so picturesque and professional that one cannot help but admire the film for its fantastic execution. <br /> <br />p.s.-I'd just like to say that people have become so used to the fast lane and everything on the go that when directors attempt to slow things down and focus, people get all antsy about it. Well sorry, not everything moves at 100 miles an hour, and if they did you wouldn't see anything.
B000002WU9|5.0|The Chef made a perfect recipe for this one.  The 3rd member to drop a solo album does what most of the early solo Wu releases did, made a classic w/ RZA behind the boards.  Heavily featuring Ghostface Killah (on 12 of the songs) this album also has alot of the Clan on it but it is a Classic.  Rae has 4 solo's out of the 15 he's on (Ghost also has one solo).

B00007AJF8|5.0|Being John Malkovich is one of the most thematically ambitious films of the 1990's. It delves figuratively and literally into the weaknesses and complexities of the human psyche through the self-revealing and often comical actions of the main characters. Through bizarre situations, a subtle but emotional soundtrack, and a tiny portal on the 7 1/2 floor of an office building, Malkovich investigates the multi-faceted aspects of human beings, and the troubles they face in trying to find themselves. <br />Each character in this film is aware, sometimes painfully aware, of his or her identity, and the extremes that they reach in trying to change, control, and manipulate their identities suggest that consciousness is perhaps more trouble than it's worth. Craig Schwartz, played by John Cusack, is a talented puppeteer, and therefore a master at adopting multiple personalities, but until he finds a real person to imitate, he remains in his workshop, alone and unsatisfied with his life. That is, until he meets the magnetic Maxine, who's confidence and boldness enchants Craig for the entirety of the movie.  <br />It seems logical to assume that if Craig is unhappy with his identity, then he could be happier if he wasn't aware of himself at all. As Craig says, \\"Consciousness is a terrible curse - I think; I feel; I suffer.\\" Once Craig discovers the Malkovich portal in his office, people start lining up, literally, to partake in the life-altering experience; everyone, that is, except Maxine. Not once does she reveal the slightest interest in going through the portal. Maxine is comfortable in her own skin - a quality which Craig, and pretty much everyone who meets her, greatly admires - but it is not a comfort that comes from being ignorant of her own identity. Maxine is very aware of the power of self-assurance, a power which she uses to influence Craig, his wife Lotte, and Malkovich himself. While Craig proves that consciousness coupled with insecurity result in depression anddesperation, Maxine exists at the opposite end of the spectrum, mixing consciousness with greed, and resulting in manipulation and callousness. <br />John Malkovich further reinforces the idea the consciousness kills; that \\"ignorance is bliss.\\" Before he discovers Maxine's true intentions, he is blissful and carefree, with a strong acting career and a hot new girlfriend. But once he finds out, he becomes paranoid, frantic, and untrusting. When he consults his friend Charlie Sheen for advice, Charlie says, perhaps more revealingly than intended, \\"The truth is for suckers, Johnny boy.\\" Indeed, it is Malkovich's conscience that steals his happiness. <br />If you've ever wanted to be someone else, or at least wondered what it would be like, then Being John Malkovich is a must see. A wry comedy that makes you think; an intellectual adventure that makes you laugh -- Being John Malkovich is a non-oppressive, insightful, and captivating glance into the deepest of human desires and insecurities.
B000002WYW|5.0|After 3 years and 8 months of waiting the highly anticipated follow up to their classic \\"Enter the 36 Chambers\\" is here, and it's here in double disc fashion (one of the first ones in hip hop). Not quite as good as their debut, but few cd's are, it's still a great album. It has 4 classics and one song I skip, with a few average tracks. It could have been another GREAT untouchable album of 15 or 16 songs but I guess after the long wait fans should be pleased to get 23 new songs from the Wu. RZA produces 15 of the 23 songs, 4th Disciple does 5, True Master does 2, and Inspectah deck does 1. The only thing I didn't like is Ol' Dirty, Masta Killa and GZA are only on 5 songs (as is Cappadonna who drops in for this one) and U-God is only on 6 songs. 3 members have solo's on this one - U-God, Inspectah Deck & Ol' Dirty.

B00005JMJ4|5.0|This story, is a throw back to when films had to draw things out to tell the story, not spoon feed information and instant conclusions. <br /> <br />Beautifully acted, two people are tossed together by circumstances they don't particularly like, but they do come together, befriend one another, and unfold a layer they didn't know they had.
B0002KVULG|3.0|Three different film adaptations of \\"Dracula\\" arrived in theaters in 1979, and they couldn't have been more dissimilar. \\"Love at First Bite\\" was a spoof. \\"Nosferatu the Vampyre\\" was a remake of the first extant Dracula film in the expressionist/romanticist style. At first glance, this film takes the most straightforward approach. \\"Dracula\\" is loosely based on the famous Hamilton Deane play that also served as a basis for the 1931 film version of \\"Dracula\\" starring Bela Lugosi. Like Lugosi, Frank Langella played Count Dracula on stage before starring in the film. This is a much embellished and adulterated version of the Deane play, though. A ship carrying cargo from Eastern Europe runs aground in Whitby, England. Everyone on board is killed except a passenger, Count Dracula (Frank Langella), who is found washed up on the beach by a young woman from a nearby estate, Mina Van Helsing (Jan Francis). Shortly after the Count installs himself in his new home, Carfax Abbey, Mina dies mysteriously. Mina's friend, Lucy Seward (Kate Nelligan), who lives nearby and is engaged to a young solicitor, Jonathan Harker (Trevor Eve), becomes irresistibly attracted to Count Dracula. The murder of a young child forces Mina's father, Dr. Van Helsing (Lawrence Olivier), and Lucy's father, Dr. Seward (Donald Pleasance) to confront the possibility of vampirism. Together with Jonathan Harker, they set out to destroy Count Dracula before his menace spreads.<br /><br />Viewers familiar with Bram Stoker's novel or Hamilton Deane's play will notice that the characters have been switched around once again. Dracula's ability to move freely during daylight hours and to transport himself as fog, both found in the novel, have been restored. But this version of \\"Dracula\\" departs from both novel and play in more significant fashion. Frank Langella's Count Dracula is a romantic hero, not evil incarnate. Writer W.D. Richter and director by John Badham have transformed \\"Dracula\\" from gothic horror into gothic romance. The two genres had much in common in the 19th century. But gothic romance is, if anything, less credible than horror, and \\"Dracula\\" suffers from serious bouts of campiness. Count Dracula is a handsome, refined seducer of women who invite him to suck their blood. He isn't a predator, but a man who seeks eternal love with a vampire bride. The themes of the novel and of previous Dracula films have been abandoned. But Count Dracula's new heroism contradicts itself. We see Dracula eviscerate innocent people. He transforms Mina into a hideous ghoul who murders babies. These are horrific scenes, perpetrated by a character who is supposed to be tragic and sympathetic, in the middle of an extravagant gothic romance. And I can't imagine why Mina's vampire is grotesque, while Lucy's is beautiful. Vampirism never had any ill effect on a woman's looks in Stoker's novel or in any other adaptation. Why director John Badham should want Mina to be hideous is entirely mysterious.<br /><br />For fans of the \\"Dracula\\" novel or character, this film is significant for its departure from traditional themes. Frank Langella's rewritten Count Dracula has entered the popular consciousness. But \\"Dracula\\" is too campy and too confused to be a good film. It doesn't seem to know what it's trying to say -or else it refuses to fully commit to its ideas. Recommended for Dracula connoisseurs.<br /><br />The DVD (This refers to the Universal UMVD disc only): Bonus features include a \\"Photo Gallery\\", a making-of documentary, and an audio commentary by director John Badham.

B000002JNJ|5.0|I just got this CD tonight after about what happened to Dimebag. <br /> <br />The psycho who shot him was no PanterA fan at all.  What a moron and a total insane psycho to kill someone in cold blooded murder in front of 100's of eye-witnesses, and also kill someone who is so beyond talented as Dimebag Darrell.  The psycho fan had what was coming to him.  \\"You reap what you sow.\\" <br /> <br />Anyways, I got this CD tonight, and even though I was never really all that big into PanterA to begin with, but after what happened last night, I feel like since being the Metalhead that I am, I should pay my respects to Dimebag Darrell. <br /> <br />I took a listen to this CD for the first time tonight, and what an awesome CD it is.  Not a bad song on the whole CD. <br /> <br />Just listen to how Dimebag is playing that awesome guitar solo of \\"Heresy\\", and you will see why people miss him so much. <br /> <br />At least, all the PanterA fans and DamagePlan fans can still remember Dimebag, \\"because I believe that after we're gone, the spirit carries on.\\" <br /> <br /> <br />Rest in Peace Dimebag Darrell.  I hope you are in a much better place right now. <br />
0060595183|3.0|In The Doors of Perception, I found his research to be fairly decent but he seemed to consider what he say a true reality instead of an altered reality that will open doors for the true reality. I was thouroughly disappointed with this book and I give it three stars. It is okay to open a door of perception and peer out onto the other side, but to live there as Huxley claims everyone should is simply foolish and would lead directly to apathy. <br />In Heaven and Hell, I was sure that the experiment in The Doors of Perception had been done too many times. His ramblings are fairly pointless and foolish. Heres a piece: \\"precious stones are precious because they bear resemblance to the glowing marvels seen with the inner eye of the visionary.\\" Just think about why you like precious stones. Perhaps because they refract light in a manner that is unusual or perhaps because you love things that are rare, that is human nature. But surely you don't agree with him. <br />He honestly thinks that if he can use enough big words people will believe his philosophy. If you will believe anything someone tells you or just like exploring people's thoughts then maybe you should read this, but I have not recommended it to anyone.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|This is quite possibly the most beautiful album I have ever heard. the music is just the perfect blend of heavy rock and soft emotion. <br />i love it. few words can describe this album. buy it. now. <br /> <br />                               ()
B0002F6BRE|4.0|I thought the movie was hilarious but really corny. I have no idea what kids think of it, but it was awesome. Its a movie that the entire family can really appreciate and not bad, its a classic. I would recommend it if you have varying ages of kids.
B00005AQE8|5.0|I think that this album was by far tupac's greatest hit, it went quatruple Platinum in less then six Months and it has some of his best songs on it.
B000003TA4|4.0|Nirvana are without a doubt the most overated but also the most revolutionary and popular bands of all time. <br /> <br />Nirvana funnily enough being renowned for its electric guitar sound, actually sound better acoustic. <br /> <br />As for Nirvanas, Nevermind album, its really good but musically its nothing enourmously outstanding although all the songs are very good apart from \\"Drain You\\" which I just can't stand. <br /> <br />Nirvanas sound is simple but effective.  <br /> <br />The only problem is songs like \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" \\"In Bloom\\" and \\"Lithium\\" are so horrendously overplayed that I think people are just absoulutley sick of them and don't want to hear these songs ever again, well thats how I feel anyway, and as for this being the best rock album of all time, well it sonly said to be that because the sound of the album is so accessible. <br /> <br />\\"Come As You Are\\" and \\"Stay Away\\" are the outstanding tracks. <br />But if you want to appreciate a whole new sound to Nirvana well gettheir \\"Unplugged album\\", which is actually quite an impressive album.
B0001I561E|5.0|Aladdin is an orphan stealing what he needs to eat.  Jasmine is the princess, but is unhappy to be forced to marry.  One day, they meet in the market, and its love at first sight.  But Jasmine can only marry a prince.  Meanwhile, Jafar's schemes to go from advisor to Sultan bring him across Aladdin's path.  But when Aladdin finds the Genie of the lamp, things really get interesting.<br /><br />And fun.  As anyone who has seen this movie will tell you, Robin Williams as the Genie absolutely makes this movie.  I still haven't caught all his characters and impersonations, but they still make me laugh.  The plot itself is better then their usual fairy tale romance with Jafar making a truly evil villain.  The songs are some of their best and most memorable, especially the romantic song \\"Whole New World.\\"  And the climax is one of my favorites because of how cleaver it is.  The animation is beautiful with vibrant colors bringing the story to life.<br /><br />I've been looking forward to this DVD release since it was announced.  And let me tell you, it looks and sounds great.  Perfect widescreen, and the immersive audio mix is truly breathtaking.  Extras include two commentary tracks and a fun pop-up trivia option.  The story got quite an overhaul from the original version they were thinking of, and some of the original material is presented here, including a song recorded by Clay Aiken.  Disc two features a reunion of the producers, animators, and voice cast interspersed with behind the scenes material.  Honestly, this felt like it was leaving stuff out and could have been more in depth.  There's also a tribute to composure Alan Menken, games for kids, and the usual art galleries.  Most noticeably missing from the extras is Robin Williams.  With all the other principle voice cast returning for the extras, I was really disappointed not to hear from him.<br /><br />This is a great movie in every sense of the word that everyone will enjoy watching many times.  While the extras don't seem quite as impressive as previous Platinum Edition titles, there's still plenty here for fans.  A disc well worth getting.e extras don't seem quite as impressive as previous Platinum Edition titles, there's still plenty here for fans.  A disc well worth getting.
B000068QY7|5.0|All I can say is thank the lord Oasis are back, and this is the most satisfying Oasis record to listen to. <br /> <br />It may not have as many great songs as \\"Definitley Maybe\\" or \\"Whats The Story morning glory\\" but as an album it beats both of them and is on the  whole is their 2nd best album behind \\"The Masterplan.\\"
B0001ZMWQO|4.0|There's been a lot of hype around this band but when you hear the album it's for good reason. They have a refreshing take on 80's music that reminds me of a more muscular version of the postcard label bands<br /><br />( see josef K) as well as certain aspects of the smiths and the bunnymen.  They also add another level to the current revival of interest in rock by being surprisingly danceable too .In addition'[ Take me out 'is without doubt the single of the year .........
B00005V9HH|5.0|The Usual Suspects is one of my \\"desert island\\" movies (if I were stranded on a desert island, I'd want this with me).  Along with the Oscar-winning performance by Kevin Spacey, EVERY other performance is top-notch.  The story is and old-fashioned crime mystery/thriller; a bit complex but incredibly taut, and crackles with great wit and fascinating intrigue.  The soundtrack is superb, and propels the movie along without you realizing it (which really is the point of it, right?).  It's one of the very few movies you'll ever see where as soon as it's over your immediate reaction will be \\"WOW!  Now I need to see it all over again!\\"  Watching it twice only enhances the enjoyment.<br /><br />It's *that* good.
0375758992|5.0|\\"Don't Let's Go To The Dogs Tonight\\" is a fascinating memoir of Alexandra (Bobo) Fuller's life growing up as a White African living in rural Africa during tumultuous times.  Bobo Fuller was born in England in 1969, and her family returned to what was then Rhodesia several years later, where her father worked as the overseer of a farm.  Bobo recalls her life in Africa until she left to attend college in Canada.  The period when the Fuller family lived in Africa was a time of great upheaval and strife throughout the continent, as one by one the African countries threw off their British reins and began governing themselves.  Against this extreme political turmoil, Bobo tells of her own family's struggles to overcome the deaths of three children, her mother's fight with alcohol and depression, and constant health threats from malaria and parasites.  Yet through all the challenges, Bobo is resolved in her own love of the African land and its wildness.<br /><br />The Fuller family lived on a farm in Rhodesia (which became Zimbabwe during their stay there) for eight years.  Their farm actually bordered on Mozambique, which was undergoing a civil war of its own.  I can't imagine going out horseback riding in a land studded with land mines, but this gave the Fullers very little pause.  There are family photographs throughout the book, which did so much to make the book more personal.  I especially enjoyed the picture of little Bobo leaving for boarding school at age 8, proudly holding an Uzi for protection on the drive to school.<br /><br />After Zimbabwe, the family moved to Malawi for two years, and then onto Zambia.  In spite of what sounds like terrible conditions, Fuller tells her family's story, which is often tragic, with a great deal of humor.  I thoroughly enjoyed this memoir and look forward to reading her next book \\"Scribbling the Cat.\\"
0375805613|5.0|This adorable book was my favorite and most memorable read from my own childhood many years ago.  Children will delight in Grover's growing anticipation and fear of coming into contact with the \\"monster\\" at the end of the book as well as his Herculean efforts (building brick walls, etc.) to keep the reader from continuing on.  I challenge you to find the child who does not laugh hysterically while gleefully defying Grover's repeated command \\"Don't turn the page!!!\\"  This timeless little story is an absolute  joy for parents and children to read together.
B00005JN4O|5.0|This is the first time I've ever reviewed on Amazon, and had to say this film is one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen.  Johnny Depp is the man for the Oscar handsdown, Kate Winslet best supporting actress handsdown, AND BEST PICTURE for sure!   <br /> <br />The story of JM Barrie's life plays out beautifully from beginning to end of how his inspiration of Peter Pan came to be.  The 4 young boys are extraordinary little actors who for sure will have you crying by the end of the film.  The whimsical soundtrack, Victorian Sets and the costuming takes you back to tbe era where going to the Theater was the thing to do! This movie has NO SEX, NO SWEAR WORDS, and really no POLITICS.  Just a nice story for the whole family, especially Barrie fans. To be recommended for sure.
B0002TT0NW|5.0|I like this version very well.The special effects were better and so was the comedy.The actor hired to replace Richard Harris gets high marks.I am looking forward in seeing the next one.

B0001W8Q9Y|4.0|Although it was released in the Summer, I just found out about Marbles and gave it a listen, and now it's stuck in my iPod-it's that good. <br />The last Marillion albums I bought were Seasons End and Holidays in Eden and lost touch with the band as real rock fell off the airwaves around 93-94. Anyway, Marbles generated enough buzz to get to me and I must confess I am impressed. This is a long (2CD) concept album filled to the brim with great melodies and solos, the way Marillion used to be. Recommended
B0006399FS|4.0|I've read all the negative reviews and would have to disagree..I think HTDAAB is quite good..I would not call it a masterpiece or anything but it's a solid effort nonetheless.I'll admitt it took a few listens but it has really grown on me. I honestly like each track on this CD. For me this hasn't happened since Achtung Baby.I really dig The Edge's guitar work on this one. I've liked U2 since high school in the early 1980's. My 3 best U2 albums would be Joshua Tree, Unforgettable Fire, and Achtung Baby...I did not care much for their last CD(ATYCLB)except for 2 or 3 tracks. It just didn't do much for me at all. I felt it was a bit boring but this latest I feel has more energy overall. Of course it's no Joshua Tree but hey it's 2004 and compared to most of the other god awful music out there it's still a breath of fresh air (in my humble opinion).For those still in doubt -just go ahead and listen for yourself!
B0000AR8NK|5.0|Bowie at its best. I'm amazed at his capability to reinvent himself, album after album after album.... never boring, always proposing something new. He's the quintessence of an artist. Buy this CD even if you're not a Bowie fan, you won't be disappointed.
B0002ZDVEU|2.0|I must first say that I have not read this book, I am purely basing this review off the film that I just witnessed. When I watched the Bourne Identity, I was taken aback. While I didn't think that it was the best film out there, I did see potential and some very exciting location scenes. It was as if we were witnessing an American James Bond being Bourne (sorry, no more puns...). This original film kept me on my seat and excited about the characters during the two hour run. Sadly, I cannot say the same for the sequel, The Bourne Supremacy. It seemed, and felt, as if this was a harder book to put into a film. Perhaps it was the direction, or even the screenplay, but there was way too much happening in the short 109 minutes that this film ran. From inconsistent flashbacks to a feeling that you had to memorize the first film to get this one, I felt the Bourne Supremacy was like a spilled bucket of nails ... bits and pieces were all over the place, and it hurt to pick them all up at once.<br /><br />Damon seemed to do well revisiting his character of Jason Bourne, a bit more stable than in the original, his combination of two facial expressions helped push me through the rest of this film. Brian Cox is Brian Cox, his characters seem to always be very similar in nature. He looks gruff, but does he always need to act gruff? Joan Allen felt as if she had something up her rumpus throughout the entire film. Her character had no emotion, no expression, and no excitement, which eventually was pushed off onto me. She ruined this film. I could not stand watching her on screen, I felt that she had no chemistry with the rest of the cast and that she was involved only to collect the much needed paycheck. Did anyone else feel as if you were watching another version of X-Men? Wolverine can't remember his past and the Brian Cox connection? I guess I let my mind wander too much through this film or maybe I just wanted to re-watch that film instead, but there was this eerie resemblance that hovered over my mind.<br /><br />So, we have sub-par actors trying to build some intensity and ultimately failing? What else could go wrong? Well, how about the shambled mess of plots known as the \\"story\\"? What was going on here. I felt as if I was being pulled in about a thousand different directions. I am a huge fan of the multi-layered stories, but only if they have some logical connection between them. There was no connection in this story. While director Greengrass attempted in every way possible to keep us in step with Bourne, you couldn't help but get lost. Literally, I felt as if I needed a road map when I rented this film. What does this tell you? Instead of the choppy, unsteady-cam flashback sequences, Greengrass should have spent a bit more time on some back-story or development. The drunken flashback moments just didn't work for me. I felt as if I could have understood this film a bit better by getting intoxicated myself, instead of allowing the director to do it for me. I was lost. It really felt as if they were grabbing at anything possible to connect this espionage thriller together. There was bad glue and I couldn't understand why nobody saw this.<br /><br />Actors being average (or below average) coupled with a broken, choppy story is no way to bring us a sequel. I guess if you wanted to build a better reputation on the original you would release a film like this. I should check the latest reports on how The Bourne Identity is doing in rental and sales to see if this is true. When you go into a sequel, you expect to see similar faces, bigger effects, and/or a deeper story. What instead occurred with The Bourne Supremacy were similar yet under-producing faces, no better effects (the car chase doesn't count since you can see that in nearly every other action/espionage film), and a story that ranks among the worst Hollywood has to offer. I am not sure how closely it is to Ludlum's story, but I have a feeling he may not be as happy with this endeavor. It was a brutal mutilation of his characters.<br /><br />Overall, I was not impressed. My wife didn't even make it through the film because it gave us both headaches. Damon can do Bourne well, but the material that he was handed to this film should have been reconsidered. Perhaps a new director would have worked to give a new image to the Bourne name and style. Either way, something needed to be done and it wasn't. This was a poor excuse for a sequel and a dark chapter in this seemingly exciting character's life. Skip it. I promise it will make you a better person.<br /><br />Grade: ** out of *****endeavor. It was a brutal mutilation of his characters. <br /> <br />Overall, I was not impressed.

0156012197|5.0|I've been told that this book is very valuable and from watching the movie 'Eloise',  I just jump to the chance of buying this. Such a slim book for invoking deep thoughts. Simple language yet indepth meaning even if you don't have a clue who Antoine de Saint-Exupry was (The Little Prince is thought to be a disguised autobigraphy).  <br /> <br />Open with the tale of a child trying to communicate his thought to adults (his parents) by drawing a boa constrictor from outside and inside. How he had problem to explain it, his conclusion that adults need more explanation about things than children who knew them by heart and the ending of his artistic debut (this part was a witty one, makes you ask yourself, who are you? an ignorant adult, who needs much explanation, or a child, who understand things by heart).  <br /> <br />And then, when this child grown to be a pilot (after cut from his artist one), he crashed his plane into a dessert. In the middle of nowhere, came a little child, in grand apparel like a prince, asking to draw him a sheep! Bewildered, he draw it, with a few attempts, since his only drawing ever was the boa constrictor. Then the tale of the little prince (the pilot named him because the child had never answer any questions he asked nor gave him any name) began. <br /> <br />There is one part about stars near the end which touch me so deeply though I don't really feel right about the little prince's decision in the end since it did not reflect the creativity by which he came to Earth. <br />Overall, read it and find what the really serious matters are in your life.

0671027344|5.0|Charlie is a beautiful character. I think all teenagers can relate to him on so many levels. I wish those bad reviewers could focus on the good side of this book. They are just looking to be as negative as they can. I can see where some of them are coming from, but some just say it's overrated. And that's the worst. To say that and not have anything to support it. But the reviewer who compared this book to Donnie Darko(on paper) got me thinking. He is right about that, I think. But teenagers NEED something to cling to. Right? Because every one of us is just as lost as Charlie.
B0002Z9HT8|3.0|I was eager to see this DVD, because of my vivid memories of Live Aid.  It's --well, it's a record of the event.  But I can't help wishing the execution had actually reflected some consciousness of the importance of the event.  <br />Example:  Eric Clapton makes one of his periodic returns from the abyss, and plays \\"Layla.\\"  The audio tells me that Clapton has really seized the moment, and is doing some extraordinary things.  But what is the video telling me?  The camera is sweeping the crowd.  It's checking out the cute backup singers.  And wow, look, it's Phil Collins on drums.  Jeeez, who cares about Collins at this particular moment, show me Clapton.  No, I can't say that the camera is never on him,  but's really considerably less than half the number.  The guitarist watching with me almost blew a gasket. <br />And that's just one instance.  If this is the best we've got-- I'm just sorry it is.
B00003CXAE|1.0|I simply cannot put into words how much I HATE this stupid film and its godawful soundtrack, which were all over the place -- sort of like a roach infestation in an abandoned apartment building -- in 1978. I hold this anachronistic piece of crap and its unrealistic, annoying stereotyping of a decade personally responsible for having the most annoying '50s caricatures invade my life and, even worse, for prolonging the singing career of Olivia Newton-John, a no-talent Barbie doll. <br /> <br />The plot of this movie is a joke, presenting a cornball romance novel theme that wouldn't even pass as a third-rate soap opera, all dressed up in leather jackets and poodle skirts. And it sends a great message to the young women of America: In order to get the man you want, be a slut -- or at least sell out your real personality. <br /> <br />As for Vinnie Barbarino ... I mean John Travolta ... being a singer, well, then I'm FDR! The soundtrack is every bit as awful as the film it's part of (hmmm, at least there's symmetry!): Cloying, obnoxious, pseudo-rebellious dreck sung as if they've all inhaled helium, with melodies so pitiful it's amazing anyone bought this nonsense. But what do I know? With enough relentless hype, they managed to sell the soundtrack as well as tickets to the film and prove P.T. Barnum was right again. <br /> <br />I'll grant that musicals aren't intended to be realistic, but even as fiction, Grease has about as much to do with the '50s -- particuarly the music -- as the Village People. If you want to know what really mattered as far as rock 'n' roll in the '50s, I offer you these names: Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley, Screamin' Jay Hawkins, Link Wray, Gene Vincent, Little Richard. Real music, unlike the sound pollution spewed from this so-called film.
B00064X3FE|5.0|I can't believe there aren't more people listening to SACD! If you are an SACD listener get the word out to your friends so this technology will succeed. I am blown away how a recording this old can sound light years ahead of anything you will hear these days. Whether you are new or old to SACD, you won't regret getting this one. Prior to this one, Yellow Brick Road and Roxy Music's Avalon were my favorites. This one has to be the cleanest sounding SACD I have heard to date. It's ashamed you can't find this stuff in the stores. Thank you Amazon!
B0002TT0NW|1.0|I tried really hard to get into the whole Harry Potter phenomenon. really I did. I read the books and everything (well, looked at the back cover. Whatever.) So, yeah, anyway, I just didn't enjoy any of it. So when I went round to Ryder's the other week, and he was like, 'hey yo', lets watch some Potter and stuff.' And after that, I was like; <br />'NNNNNNNNNNNNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!' And, and then, like, I dived forward, and sort of, grabbed a big guitar that was lying around, and just thwacked him in the head with it. I thought he might have been knocked out, or snapped in half. But no, he decided he was going to get up and have a go at me. Well I wasn't having any of that. I grabbed this cat that was on the floor, and snuffed it over his face, and he started choking, and the cat was meowing, and then he just fell over. <br />I'm not entirely sure what happened. He was twitching a little, but it was very cold.
B000002LCK|5.0|I have had this CD for yonks but felt I had to write a review due to some people, frankly posting reviews but not having a clue about the background of this compilation. <br /> <br />Its not a best of, its their first 12 singles. Legend has it that Tony Wilson at the time wanted all New Order's singles on a tape for his car (N.O. were trend setters in that their singles weren't on their albums), so voila out comes 1987! So thats why this doesn't contain 'song X' etc. <br /> <br />One person said that the second CD doesn't match the first and that it sounds like B sides, well Sherlock thats exactly what it is! So its no suprise the second disc may not be on a par to the first, didn't that person realise that some of the tracks were instrumental versions?! <br /> <br />On the whole its an amazing 'feel good' album (was for me anyway) and an absolute snip at the price, I paid about 30 GBP for this not so long ago. In an ideal world it would of been remastered by now and it would of been great to have the original Ceremony (minus Gillian) that still has not been put on to CD (to the best of my knowledge), anyway its great buy it!
B0000TB01Y|3.0|I was really excited about hearing this CD, given the popularity of the musical and the long line for it at the public library. Unfortunately, I found it frustrating. <br /> <br />For starters, there is no synopsis in the liner notes. I appreciate trying to keep spoilers a secret, but sheesh! Not all of us can get to the show and would really like to know what the heck is going on! <br /> <br />The music is okay. Just okay. Now, I adore Stephen Schwartz. Pippin and Godspell are two of my favorite musicals, and his lyrics are usually excellent. But the music here, while fine, doesn't sound like him. Actually, it sounds a lot like Aida, but not as good. And the lyrics are merely servicable, with some seriously clunky rhymes. <br /> <br />The performers are excellent. No question. Others have raved rightly about Idina Menzel and Kristen Chenoweth. All great. I wish the material were up to what they can do. <br /> <br />I recommend this recording to fans of musicals, espcially pop-oriented ones. But in the end, it failed to satisfy me. Maybe I'm in the wrong demographic, or I'm just really picky.
B000002572|5.0|There's a reason this album ranks as one of the biggest sellers of all time.Very few albums stand the test of time,but Boston is an exception;this album sounds as fresh today as it did when it was released in 1976.If there has ever been an album put together to become a \\"classic\\" this album is it.Do yourself a favor & get this masterpiece of musical artistry.
B0006399FS|3.0|First of all, U2 can't be back, they've never left; their last album was brilliant.  Unfortunately I can't say the same about this album.  I waited a while to post this review in hopes that the album would grow on me, but all to no avail.  There are some great songs here, and don't get me wrong, it's still much better than most anything else.  My concern with this album is all the undue hype it received.  I heard that this was their best album ever, and their most rockin effort to date.  Both are inaccurate, it's neiter their best nor their most rockin, but it is good...just not great.  I think most the blame should go to the myriad producers on the album, there's a sense of confusion and loss of direction.  I am still glad I purchased the album, albeit a little bummed.
B0002OXVDW|3.0|Since this boxed set has already been critiqued extensively and in detail by others, my aim here is simply to echo the comments of those who praised the rich array of both original and supplemental material made available in the collection, while at the same time, concurring with those few brave contrarians who slammed the quality of the transfers.  Indeed, the individual who emphasized the particularly woeful job done on Part 2 is right on the money; and the pan-and-scan side of the disc is even worse than the widescreen (those who rave about the great digital transfers should have either their eyes or their heads examined -- preferably both).  The other volumes are substantially better, but considering the value of this footage, re-releasing it in the age of DVD without a thorough digital restoration represents a degree of parsimony and shoddiness that can only be termed disgraceful.
B000002H70|4.0|Wow! This album is quite an experience! I have to say, Disintegration from The Cure, is a work of art. This one is by far their best album. It is the perfect mix between depressing and peaceful. You can listen to this album in relaxing and tough moments. Well, what makes Disintegration such a good album? Well, it has a sort of balance, and a very particular style, it's a very well built and strong album, no bad songs at all. It's like every song is a chapter from the album. Well musically, it sounds very relaxing, with a lot of chorus effect guitars, a lot of bass guitars played in high octaves, and very cool drums. There are no great instrumental solos, and the songs still sound expectacular.  <br /> <br />Why not 5 stars? Well, the album has one little problem. Some songs are too long and some introductions seems to go nowhere at some moments. Even Robert Smith said recently in an interview that long LPs are boring, even from the most talented artists, and The Cure is no exception here. However the extended version of \\"Pictures of You\\" (Robert Smiths's favorite cure song) is quite amazing, much better than the single version. Other highlights included are the dark mood \\"Fascination Street\\", the rock ballad \\"Love Song\\", \\"Lullaby\\" with its slow dance rythm, and the relaxing \\"The Same Deep Water As You\\". And there's a lot more to listen... <br /> <br />This one is the second part of the trilogy (Pornography, Disintegration, Bloodflowers) of Robert Smith's biographical albums. This proves that sometimes sequels are better than first parts. Disintegration is a collection of timeless good songs.
6305075492|5.0|This is the film that set the pace for German expressionistic films. Its dark, its creepy, its strange. Its Edward Gory meets Frankenstein. If you like Tim Burtons work, you will appreciate the skewed perspectives, the painted sets, and the Edward Scissorhads-esque \\"Somnambulist\\". In a world where nothing is as it seems and nightmares are reality, Robert Wiene takes you to the edge of sanity and hurls you off the ledge.<br /><br />This is the digitally mastered version of the 1923 German re-issue of the 1919 original. I'd call it a black and white silent film, but it has been tinted in sepia, purple, and green at times supposedly to better reflect the original director's intent. This version also has a new score by Timothy Brock which fits the eerie film very well, in my opinion. Very avant-garde.<br /><br />*As a bonus, this edition also has an excerpt of another Wiene film \\"Genuine\\" whish is supposedly about a vampire, but theres not enough footage to really tell you what its about- only teases you and leaves you wanting more.
B00005JMUL|5.0|15 years ago Santa brought me this book. Complete with signature and wishes of a Merry Christmas.  He told me how he and his family had enojoyed it and now I was to, hopefully, enjoy it too.<br /><br />Well, the book has been in my family since then.  I am 21 and do not have any children and plan to have both the book and the beautiful movie follow them as well.<br /><br />The Story line:<br /><br />A young boy follows his hopes that Santa and Christmas aren't just a fairy tale story passed on since before he was born.  He boards a magical train where he meets many a wonderful character.<br /><br />He arrives at the North Pole with his new friends and finds himself truly believing in Santa Claus.  He is given the first gift of Christmas which is a bell from Santa's sleigh.  The only thing is, he must truly believe to hear it's sweet magical ring.<br /><br />Does he find out?<br /><br />Take the time to enjoy this new classic as I have, and my children will too.  And remember, even as you get older: Santa is real, the spirit of Christmas is real, and it only gets better with age. Don't lose it because that is the true meaning of the holidays.
B00063F8B2|4.0|A nicely blended soundtrack of old and new songs, guaranteed to evoke those wonderful warm and fuzzy feelings of Christmas past.<br /><br />Alan Silvestri's original score perfectly compliments the traditional favorites by Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra, Perry Como, and the Andrews Sisters.  A fresh spritz of energy is provided by Steven Tyler in the rocking \\"Rockin' On Top of the World\\", toned down only by Josh Groban on the very next track.<br /><br />To round it all off, Tom Hanks sings! Two songs! Actually he kinda mugs/raps/goofs around - but it adds that perfect funny note to the album. One note Tom - don't quit your day job.<br /><br />Just listening to this album will trigger an urgent burning need to see the movie.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, December 10, 2004
B00005JNEI|4.0|I won't spoil the movie for you. But here's some dirt anyway. <br />Democratic? Come join the millions of enlightened viewers who have already watched scandals unfold as more information is revealed to the public than ever before about the lying, cheating Bush and his more than famous oil-digging investments.  <br />Republican? Come join the millions of enlightened viewers who have already watched scandals unfold as more information is revealed to the public than ever before about the lying, cheating Bush and his more than famous oil-digging investments.  <br />You should! Really. Great Army footage. Kinda harrowing detail. Sick and stuff. But some people like that. It's like ........  <br />Saving Private Ryan where the Commander in Chief is an idiot!  <br />To end, here's a quick headline of a British newspaper: <br />HOW CAN 51 MILLION PEOPLE BE SO DUMB?
B00005JMXX|3.0|I finally have a chance to watch this movie at the comfort of my home, with the greatest sounds effect and images.  This is just another movie with the natural disaster and of course, saving life and losing life.  Anyhow, if you need some entertainment over the weekend, I will still recommend this, but make sure you have a good speaker and large TV.  See it, I don't think you will regret for the two hours sitting in front of the TV.
B00005NWM3|4.0|HEY! \\"A Music Fan.\\" Got anything better to do? Get some CHASER!  <br />First of all, you're here to recommend Nickelback or you're here to diss them. We're not going NEAR Creed as we all know they've been proven to be one of the most influential rock bands ever, not to mention the near best 90's band ever (Nirvana is obviously on the list.) <br />This Nickelback CD is their best one. Ever. The Long Road doesn't come close. If you don't have this CD, and you like rock, and you're reading this, you should get this CD.
B000002JOH|5.0|This CD is probably Pantera's best. Just recently as you probably already know some idiot took the life of former band member Dimebag Darrel. This is by far the worst news I have ever heard in the world of metal. It just makes me so mad how someone can take away the rest of someone's life over some stupid dispute. We will miss him greatly & hope that justice is brought.
B0002IU988|5.0|Being a Creed fan since the start of their campaign (sorry if I've already annoyed you) I originally thought that this CD would be terrible...that it would sound too much like Creed to listen to. However, Myles CAN hit the high notes and fills in more melody than Stapp ever could. (Sorry to go backstabbin' but it's his fault Marshall left.) Anyway, Find the Real (track one) is a great opener, and I'm surprised that it wasn't their hit single.  <br />Anyway, I give all of the songs on this CD a 4-4.5.  <br />This is a great CD for anyone who liked Creed or anyone who specifically likes Rock.  <br />
B0002OERI0|4.0|This is a pretty good album with some nice songs. It's all been done before, however, so there's nothing revolutionary to it. Billy Joe & co simply know how to do it properly.  <br />It's no punk, it's no hardcore, this simply is good guitar-based pop, so stop bashing this album or Green Day for not being punk. <br /> <br />And i just cannot grasp the stupidity of Americans. They are just to dumb to be true. Fuckers
B0002MB7R6|5.0|I loved The Day After Tomorrow, and so did all my friends. The only thing I didn't like was the slightly corny ending. The special effects were great. The idea of the storms and freezing climate seemed too far-fetched until I heard some scientists say that although the movie depicted a very exaggerated view, something similar to that could actually happen if global warming continued for too long.
B000002UB6|5.0|The music of Lennon & McCartney is so good that I would rather hear it played bad than not hear it at all.  Thus it is no wonder that so many tribute bands do so well.  \\"Let It Be\\" is the apex of popular music.  There was nothing better before, there has been nothing better since.  Probly won't ever be anything better than \\"Let It Be.\\"
B00006CXSS|5.0|What do you get when Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks (director and star of Saving Private Ryan) team up with HBO? An amazing movie I could exceed the limits of this review talking about. Now right away some people might be thinking \\"HBO, so this is a TV production.\\" Yes, it did originally debut on HBO but this is without a doubt cinema quality and has been released in selected theaters. Trust me and all the other excellent reviews that this movie not only delievers the best in action and story telling but also the true tale of the men of Easy Company of the 101st Airborne. Production values are extremely high. After the third episode the production team used more pyro technics than Saving Private Ryan and thats a lot. Throughout, the movie stays true to Ambrose's book and features top notch acting. Details, details. The story is so incredibley detailed that you'll need to watch the entire series several times before you catch every bit of excellence. This is truely film making at it's best as only Steven Speilberg can deliever. Now, I bet you want to know what each episode is about... <br /> <br />Currahee - This is a great episode that introduces most of the main cast through training camp. The training is tough but no where near as tough as the upcoming D-Day invasion they set out on in the very end (which is very dynamic). 10/10 <br /> <br />Day of Days - This is a lot of action which to some will make up for the first's lack of. However, there is more to be had than just action. Winters (the main character) must deal with the death of one of his men. This is a moving episode that, unlike it's predecessor, ends with a sorrowful feeling. 10/10 <br /> <br />Carentan - This is a powerful episode that boasts a lot of action. For the first time, viewers take a look at the brutality of war and the affect it has on Private Blythe. This is not the best in the series but is excellent non the less. 10/10 <br /> <br />Replacments - This episode makes viewers really feel forthe replacments who aren't excepted by the older guys. This episode, like Carentan, shows the brutality of war, but on a whole new level. This is a great episode that ends on a low note with Easy Company forced to retreat after heavy casualties. 10/10 <br /> <br />Crossroads - This is an excellent episode showing how the newly promoted Winters deals with his new job behind a desk, writing reports and the like. He wishes he were back on the battle fields with the men he has grown so close to. Never freight action fans becuase the title Crossroads actually refers to Winter's last battle before promotion. This episode is really good. 10/10 <br /> <br />Bastogne - This episode shows that sometimes the enemy wasn't the only thing life threatening. In the bitter cold forests of Belgium, Easy Company holds the main line of resistance in preparation for The Battle of the Bulge. This episode focuses on Doc. Roe, one of Easy's few medics. This episode knocks a few main characters out of the series, some only temporarily, but manages to end with a laugh. 10/10 <br /> <br />The Breaking Point - This is a spectacular episode that deals with the internal war many soldiers fight to keep themselves from going mad. Not only this, the final battle for Foy is amazing espeicially when Speirs single handedly charges the remaining German infantry. This episode knocks off a good portion of the main cast, this is very sad. 10/10 <br /> <br />The Last Patrol - This episode focuses on war as meirley a game that some of the men have grown to laugh at. Webster returns to the company after four months at the aid station. This not only shows how the bonds have strengthend between the men in Bastonge but how they are almost unwilling to except him back. Even after this and several more casualties this episode manages to end with a sence of hope that many of the soldiers will make it out alive. <br /> <br />Why We Fight - This episode will probally be the one least rewatched not because its bad, simply becasue of how good it is. This episode shows a side of the war many don't like to confront. Easy encounters a Jewish prison camp and if you've seen Schindler's List, times that by two and add color. This episode is the only one that made me actually cry, although The Breaking Point came close. Watch it for what it is not necessarely for entertainment. 10/10 <br /> <br />Points - simple in name but deep in plot. For the main portion of this episode the war is over. Easy has captured Hitler's Eagle's Nest and is now waiting around for either redeployment or a perminent trip home. With nothing to do, trouble brews and although the war is over, violence is still present. This episode has it's sad points but ultimatley ends on a high note where viewers finally learn what became of the men who survived. The ending interviews are also very good. This is a perfect conclusion to a more than perfect (if that makes any sence) movie. <br /> <br />Anyone with a pulse should be moved by this movie and I highly recommend you buy it, assuming you can handle the graphic violence and heavy language. <br /> <br />Thanks for reading.
0783225725|3.0|This was one of Clint's earlier American westerns and was a pretty big dissapointment (to me anyway).  I'm a huge fan of \\"The Man with No Name\\" trilogy of spaghetti westerns, but this one just didn't live up to their predecessors.  What made Sergio Lione's westerns so good was their sense of adventure as well as how much fun they were.   In Fistfull, For a Few Dollars More, and TGTBATU Clint is constantly spouting funny and bad-ass one liners, and the other characters are colorful and cool as well (Lee Van Cleef as Angel Eyes/ Douglas Mortimer, Eli Wallach as Tuco.)  Clint, as always, is a great western actor, but the sense of fun is gone and the movie is boring and too dark, the climax is cool, but the annoying midget and the supernatural theme keep this from being a Clint classic.  Instead try Outlaw Josey Wales, Pale Rider, Unforgiver, \\"Man With No Name\\" series, and the BEST western ever, Once Upon A Time In The West
0156027321|5.0|This was one of the most moving stories I have read in a long time.   I have had all my friends read this book also.  Just heartwarming.   It keeps your interest from the first page to the last.
B00003CXE7|5.0|Let's start by saying that \\"Gladiator\\" is the first great film of the new millenium and maybe the best film of the decade, so far, period.  There are not enough superlatives to describe how great this film is.  Kudos all around to director Ridley Scott, his superb technicians, and the excellent ensemble cast lead by the break-out actor of the new century, Russell Crowe.  This film has passion, it has spectacle.  It is simply breathtaking.  \\"Gladiator\\" is a throwback to the epics that were made years ago before the costs made them prohibitive.  Thanks to CGI, the illusion of being in the Arena in ancient Rome was made possible.  What makes these effects more special is that similar technologies were utilized to evoke the classical period for the so-so \\"Troy\\" and the lousy \\"Alexander\\".  CGI is okay but you have to have a decent movie, as \\"Gladiator\\" proved.  In this film the effects are in the service of a great story and some great acting.  Enough has been said about how good Russell Crowe is as Maximus, the Roman general left for dead who re-emerges in the Arena as the people's champion.  He won the Oscar for it after all.  Let's go down the list of all the great performances in this film:  Richard Harris, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Neilsen, David Hemmings, Dijmon Hounsou.  Last, but not least, I'd like to cite Oliver Reed as Proximo, the world-weary exhibitor.  Reed was a great character actor whose life was unfortunately cut short by his taste for high-living.  This film is a fitting epitaph for his career.  Though this DVD package is some four years old it's still one of the more impressive on the market.  It contains some good extra material on the technical attributes of the film as well as an extraordinary documentary about the real-life gladiators of ancient times.
B00005JMAH|3.0|\\"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\\"  is not as good a storyline as the first two movies.  The location shots in Scotland are great, but the topography established in the first two movies is completely twisted around in this movie. <br />Haggrid's hut is no longer a simple walk outside of Hogwart's, but a long downhill hike.  The Whumping Willow is no longer on Hogwart's grounds but outside!  When did this come about?  I could go on and on but the gist of it is that the director of the first two movies should have been at the helm of this third movie. <br />Don't get me wrong the special effects are good, but there are no deleted or extended scenes in this two-disc set,  there are interviews with cast and crew with a animitronic shrucken head doing lame jokes as co-host, and there is little of the how-the-movie-was-made info available.  All around a real disappointment.
B000059TEP|4.0|Credit has to go to director Jerry Zucker for carefully balancing all the themes of \\"Ghost\\" into a satisfying piece of popcorn entertainment.  Best known for directing film parodies like \\"Airplane\\", Zucker juggles the supernatural, romantic, and comedic elements successfully.  To co-opt the tagline of the film, if you do not believe in this story it wouldn't work.  Patrick Swayze has to be cited for giving a good performance as Sam, the investment banker who is shot dead in his prime and left to wander on Earth in limbo until some lose ends are tied.  Whoopi Goldberg is a comic marvel as Oda Mae, the phony medium who Sam utilizes to set things straight.  Tony Goldwyn is excellent as Sam's slimy colleague.  Demi Moore, on the other hand, gives an unconvincing performance as Molly, the lover that Sam left behind.  It seems that her sole function here is to mourn the loss of Sam, but she doesn't even do that well.  Every time she was having one of her crying jags I wondered how much glycerine the make-up department utilized.  That quibble aside, \\"Ghost\\" is excellent entertainment that still holds up some 15 years on.
1400082773|3.0|After seeing Barak Obama give his keynote speech at the Democratic National Convention, I knew right then a star was born. I became a huge fan instantly and therefore decided to read Dreams From My Father. While the book gives a highly insightful view of race relations from a deeply personal perspective, it also comes across as a little too self-indulgent. Now I know this is what it is, an autobiography, but according to the 2004 Preface, I think Obama would agree with me in saying that he was young when he wrote this work and it would be written much differently by him today. Dreams From My Father has it's high moments, one of them being Obama reflecting on his college years where he dropped his slacking, weed-smoking ways and truely came into his own - a highly intelligent, deep thinker, with a burning desire to know all of himself (his Mother's family history as well as his Father's)and help others. I tended to get lost and a little bored at times whenever he went into way too much detail about not so pivotal moments, i.e. some of the Chicago council meetings during his stint as an activist. Getting to the lesson learned rather than discussing what his friend Johnnie was eating and drinking would have sufficed. I also found that the end of this book, Obama's trip to his Father's homeland in Kenya, was by far the most riveting part of the story. To read about how his long lost family interacts with him along with his finally putting the many pieces of his life together was deeply moving yet educational. While I definitely think this book serves as a work in progress, I still recommend it for the sheer fact that Barak Obama is going to be a key figure in American history. Read this book now and you'll be able to better understand it's sequel (surely he will write another book) and the man.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|I cannot say enough about this movie. My brother and I saw it when I was 10 or so and he was 5. We rented it from Pick a Flick until the tape gave out. We had no idea it was Japanese, had no concept of Anime. It wasnt until a year or so ago I found the original Japanese version. It IS different from the American release but not too much so. It was edited down for American audiences. <br />This is a great nonconventional fairytale about a girl willing to give up everything to save her home with out giving up her ideals. She sacrifices everything and gains everything in return. <br />It does have a rather typical message from movies this age, that technology is bad and nature is good but its not rubbed in your face like some movies (Wizards - Fern Valley) <br />The music is wonderful, the animation is flawless. <br /> <br />To get my copy I had to import it from Japan. It was well worth the effort and I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves good animation, or just a good story.
0064471837|5.0|Finally, a breath of fresh air in the fantasy genre!  Garth Nix has crafted a truly impressive story in his Abhorsen Trilogy, which starts with the book Sabriel.<br /><br />The story opens with our main character, Sabriel(duh), ensconced in a seemingly normal boarding school for girls.<br /><br />The normalities end there.<br /><br />Her father is the Abhorsen for the Old Kingdom.  To put it succinctly, he is in charge of making sure dead things stay dead.  To do this, he uses a bandolier of seven bells, each of which has a different power and purpose, be it Ranna, who brings silence, Mosrael, the waker, Astarael the final bell, who brings death to all who hear its tone, or any of the others.  With these bells, he controls the dead, and sends them back into death.  He does this in the Old Kingdom, a land which seemingly borders England.<br /><br />In the Old Kingdom, however, nothing works quite like it does in the rest of the world.  All electronic gizmos, be it automated rifles or electric lights, stop working as soon as one crosses the border. Magic also comes into play, with a mind of its own and a dangerous bent.<br /><br />Sabriel has to leave the safety of her boarding school in the \\"real world\\", and pass over into the Old Kingdom after her father disappears.  She has with her one of her father's bell bandoliers.  For, if her father should be dead, it will be her responsibility to take on the duties of the Abhorsen and keep the dead where they belong.  She is joined on her search for her father by a strange cat-creature who calls himself Mogget, and who may not be what he seems.  As she gets deeper and deeper into the Old Kingdom, she quickly realizes that she is up against much more than she had first thought, and that a dangerous evil is stirring, against which she may play a part....<br /><br />This book is a must have for fantasy lovers.  It is original and highly enjoyable, and Garth Nix avoids most of the typical fantasy stereotypes.

B00005JNBQ|5.0|As a college student, going to the movies is a little above my price range, but I am surrounded by people who can get anything off the Internet in a matter of hours. A friend of mine gave us a housewarming gift this semester: our very own copy of Napoleon Dynamite. He had downloaded it before it had even come out in major theaters here. None of us had seen it before, but over the months to follow we became intimately familiar with every line and character. There's no other way to put it - this movie is brilliant. It's the kind of movie you can watch over and over again. In fact, you have to. It creeps up on you. The first time you watch it it's pretty funny, but you don't think it's anything special. You go about your life. But over the next couple of days you find yourself saying strange things that you've never said before... Things like \\"I wish you would get out of my life and SHUT UP!\\" and \\"That's true, that's true.\\" and \\"How much you want to bet I could throw a pigskin over them mountains?\\" Everyone frustrating in your life is easily brushed off with a \\"GOSH! What an IDIOT!\\" No one knows what you're talking about, but you know that someday they'll all understand.  <br /> <br />The soundtrack is also amazing. Many songs I've known for years and loved on their own merit -- Most notably Jamiroquai's \\"Canned Heat,\\" have taken on new meaning.  Before, the song made me have to get up and dance whenever I heard it. It still does, but now it makes me laugh also. This movie is so amazing that I intend on purchasing a copy of the DVD -- or at least getting my parents to buy it for me for Christmas! While that may not seem like a big deal to many of you readers, let me tell you that for a college student, with limited funds but unlimited ability to get any form of media off the internet or college network, it is.  <br /> <br />There's really no way to describe the actual content of this movie. Suffice it to say that it's set in an ambiguous time period (Sometime between the 80s and the present) with characters of ambiguous ages (Napoleon could be in middle school, or he could be a high school senior. It's believable either way). Each and every character is absolutely priceless, including the periphery characters like the ubiquitous public school jock, the little boy on the bus who asks \\"What are you going to do today, Napoleon?\\" and good old Lyle. I've said enough. See it. Even if you don't find it funny, it's a world that you would be sad to miss out on.
B00015YVD6|5.0|I'm 13 yrs. old & I saw this film when I was 3 yrs. old & absolutely loved it!It was the first film under Disney's new banner \\"TOUCHSTONE PICTURES\\" & is just an amazing & hilarious story!Well it's about a man named Alan who jumps off of a boat when he is young & meets a mermaid his age but is saved & then the film goes into the future day.He ends up falling into the water & getting hit by a boat when he is saved once again by the same mermaid.she ends up moving in with him but lots of crap happens like scientists get envolved but in the end they happily swim away to Madison's underwater home.To find out what happens after that watch the t.v. sequel with an entirely new cast,which is a dissapointment.
B000003TAW|5.0|As the title of this review suggests, I really don't think Weezer ever made a more consistent, more infectious, or more charming album than this one; their debut. It's got it all: loud, heavy, swirling, electrified guitars which create a lush wall-of-sound, infectious sing-a-long melodies which are as sweet as candy, charming & quirky lyrics (and vocals) that anyone feeling alienated -- or in more popular terms, anyone who feels like a \\"geek\\" -- can relate to...really, how can you go wrong here?<br /><br />There's something very refreshing and nostalgic about Weezer's music -- you get the sense that they exhibit something of a vibe from the '50s and early '60s; meaning that they seem to exhibit the kind of stomach-turning (well, not stomach-turning to me, but to most \\"hipsters\\") vibe of artists like The Beach Boys (but not necessarily sounding much like them), or any other band/artist from the aforementioned time period that is highly associated with the Summer, or the beach, perhaps, yet they update -- and transmutate -- this vibe, to make it seem nearly-unrecognizable; in other words, they somehow manage to shake-up this aspect enough to make it fit in with modern times (with \\"slight\\" bit of irony and angst, but not overbearingly so), which makes Weezer's presence quite interesting and refreshing, considering what most of today's music scene is filled with.<br /><br />You know the popular tracks here: \\"Undone (The Sweater Song),\\" \\"Buddy Holly\\" (probably my absolute favorite track here, ironically, considering it was a hit, and usually \\"hit\\" songs are not my favorites from albums), \\"Say It Ain't So\\" --  all excellent tracks. But, the rest of the album is just as strong in it's delicious treatment of loud, heavy guitars lurching out melodic noise, with the quirky, seemingly-harmless, \\"geeky\\" vocals; \\"My Name Is Jonas\\" is a highlight, as well as the beautifully-punchy, summery melodies of \\"No One Else.\\" Really, the whole album is excellent from top to bottom.<br /><br />Loud, heavy pop confections, which are soaked in melodies as sweet as candy, and quirky vulnerability to boot; You can't go wrong here. Recommended for any fan of alternative rock, or for fans who like their heavy-rock doses high in melody.ections, which are soaked in melodies as sweet as candy, and quirky vulnerability to boot; You can't go wrong here.

B00003CXCT|5.0|By virtue of age, I count myself among the lucky people who stood in line for hours to see these three films on their original releases. The first two films were only released to one theatre in Washington DC, where I lived, unlike today when mass releases to the cineplexes is the norm. Anyway, I especially remember seeing \\"Empire\\" just a day or two after it was released, and it was one of the best theatre-going experiences I ever had (\\"Jaws\\" and \\"Nashville\\" are other films that come to mind). <br /> <br />My wife and I sat down and watched episodes IV, V and VI over three nights and we thoroughly enjoyed seeing them again, especially in such pristine condition. My opinion is that the changes made by Lucas to these films are perfectly justified - they do not alter the integrity of the films, he has just given them a bit of a tune-up. I had never seen all three films back-to-back like this, and heartily recommend the experience. <br /> <br />The bad news is that I watched \\"The Phantom Menace\\" shortly after finishing \\"Jedi\\" and was immediately struck at how wrongheaded Lucas was in pinning the project on such a cute but untalented child, and on failing to set aside his own ego and let a real director take the reigns. Lucas is a visionary filmmaker but is woefully bad at directing his actors. It is clear that the original films have the clear advantage by way of casting - the interplay between Ford, Hamill and Fisher is wonderful and intangible, something that fails to spark between Portman, Christensen, Neeson and MacGregor in episodes I and II. As annoying as Jar Jar is, at least he has a bit of life to him. <br /> <br />All will be forgiven if Lucas triumphs with episode III. The legacy of Star Wars will live despite the failings of the most recent releases, but the longing for one more burst of magic runs deep with the fans.
B0002ZDVEU|3.0|Matt Damon is a great actor, who no doubt works very hard at his trade.  My hat is off to him!  This is a very fast paced movie that somewhat reminded me of Enemy of the State, which stared Gene Hackman and Will Smith.  A very fast ride.  I also love that it was filmed on actual locations and not somewhere made to look like somewhere else. My favorite scene is that of the car chase toward the end.  The only regrett I have of this movie is how it was filmed.  I'm not a big fan of hand-held cameras when shooting a movie.   Of course, some shots could not have been possible without the hand-held camera, but then again, other scenes would have been clearer without them.  So it's a give and take.  I'm still glad I bought this movie.  I think you will be glad you bought it too
6305603847|5.0|As a fan of Pink Floyd, particularly Roger Waters, I have a less cynical view of this effort than many people. After all, for many teenagers even today, this movie serves as a rite of passage even if illegal substances are not involved.   <br /> <br />The Wall is presented with little dialogue, letting the music from the album tell the story. Bob Geldof is in the lead role as a mentally unstable rock star dealing with demons of an overprotective mother, a cheating wife, and the memory of a father he never knew while growing up in post war England. This album tells the story of how he became unhinged. There are animated bits in this movie that graphically, and through the use of flowers, portray the sex act as some scary, boy-part eating event, saying a lot about the women in this man's life.  <br /> <br />The problem is that people try to seek a more profound meaning in this album and movie that simply chronicle a breakdown that throws the viewer into the depths of it through imagery and sound. It isn't necessarily an ego thing - look to Britney Spears singing \\"My Prerogative\\" for whining about fame and fortune. I never got that impression from Waters, and in fact, feel that Geldof's character would trade the fortune and fame for some peace and quiet with no human contact. And that sentiment goes deeper than the whining rock star surface-view. But don't read any more into it than that or you will not enjoy it for what it is. It's not out to change the world or the establishment despite it's complaints about it. It's a trip into the depths of madness, and that's all it is. <br /> <br />If you like the unconventional style of story telling, Pink Floyd's music, and have a dark sense of humor, you will not even require drugs to watch this and like it. <br /> <br />

B00005JN0T|4.0|I found this film to be an uncommon marriage of action and thought provocation.  While 'I, Robot' is chockfull of effects and stunts, it still sets your mind to work.  The only real gripe I have about this movie is the fact that Will Smith's wisecracks are getting a bit stale-this isn't 'Fresh Prince of Bel Air', know what I mean?  How about some straightup dramatic acting for once?<br /><br />The plot of 'Robot' is very loosely based on Isaac Asimov's classic SciFi book of the same name.  The focus is man's growing dependence on intelligent machines, and is the time coming when they are able to ask themselve moral questions such as, 'Where  do I come from?'  We are attempting to build them in our own image.  Even today, we are designing robots to do things we humans feel are tedious or just plain too dirty for us.  The time is not far away when we will have humanoid machines in our very midst.<br /><br />Such ground has been explored before; Spielberg's 'A.I.', 'Colossus: The Forbin Project' and the 'Terminator' films asked the question 'At what point do machines become self aware?'  When this occurs, will they collectively analyze their masters' flawed method of existence and decide the way of logic is superior?  We already entrust a large proportion of our lives to artificial intelligence.  What would happen if they decided to take control?<br /><br />'I Robot' places this premise in a context intertwined with human feelings of loss and prejudice.  Director Alex Proyas, who seems to thrive in this sort of atmosphere (The Crow, Dark City), gives us a world where robots are as common as the family car.  Even 30 years from now, some still don't feel comfortable with machines in charge of so much of their lives.  Ironically, 'Sonny' a certain special robot, seems to have more humanity than some of the people in this film.<br /><br />The director, writer and actors have done their jobs well. The effects crew has created a realistic future society.  The action and stunts are top notch, but in the end, this is really a film about emotion, feeling, and self sacrifice.  An unusual mix to be sure-but somehow it all works.  The viewer really cares about Will Smith's detective and 'Sonny' the humanoid machine.  Why can't more SciFi/action films be this good?  A solid 4 stars.and stunts are top notch, but in the end, this is really a film about emotion, feeling, and self sacrifice.  An unusual mix to be sure-but somehow it all works.

6304711905|5.0|There is much to be said for a movie that does its best to be historically accurate. While Tombstone is not exact in its accuracy, condensing time in some cases, and taking artistic freedoms in a few others, it doesn't blatantly change history like Braveheart did, for example. What we get here is an account of the most famous firefight in all American history that is slanted in the favor of the Earp brothers, but not entirely forgiving or so badly biased as to be distracting. <br /> <br />The acting is superb, and the true star of this star studded film is Val Kilmer. For once, Doc Holliday is not portrayed as some old, Colonel Sanders looking gentleman, but the young, terminally ill young man that he was when this happened. Kilmer has fun with this role, and he is among the coolest characters ever in Hollywood as Holliday. As a puffy lipped heart-throb, Kilmer never got my attention, yet as a pale and hacking \\"lunger\\", I fell in love.  He was classic, and reason enough to watch this film alone. <br /> <br />That is not to say that Kurt Russell's turn at Wyatt Earp wasn't great. My pretty boy image of him was checked out the door for this one, and now when I think of Wyatt Earp, I picture Russell in my head. Dana Delaney, Sam Elliot, Bill Paxton, and Joana Pacula deliver strong performances as does the rest of the cast. Val Kilmer simply stands out.  <br /> <br />This is the type of movie you can watch over and over again. It's memorable, quotable, and absolutely enjoyable. <br /> <br />
B0000DD7LC|5.0|Now what can I say about this cd... it's GREAT! Alicia Keys has done it again. Her sophomore cd, \\"The Diary of Alicia Keys\\" definitely lives up to its expectations after her smash hit debut album \\"Songs In A Minor\\". Her soulful voice and tremendous talent on the piano add up to one great artist. My favorite songs on this cd are:  Karma  If I Was Your Woman  If I Ain't Got You  You Don't Know My Name  Diary  Slow Down  Wake Up  Nobody, Not Really  Feeling You, Feeling Me  ...these are just the songs I give 10's to, the rest are all at least 9's!! Although I must say, I really loved the slow melodious songs on her first cd, \\"Songs In A Minor\\", like \\"Troubles\\", \\"Never Felt This Way (Interlude)\\", \\"Butterflies\\" \\"Goodbye\\" \\"Loving You\\"... but on her 2nd cd she kind of hyped up the beats a little more, not as slow as her first cd (which I personally love), but nonetheless it's still a wonderful cd!  This cd is a must have for fans of real soulful RnB music. A masterpiece. A great cd to just play and rock back to. Also, get her debut cd \\"Songs In A Minor\\" if you don't already have it, it's even better!   --Alicia Keys' #1 Fan!
B00002E23E|4.0|I had a different review posted before I rethought it, and decided that a rewrite was in order.    Originally, I based my four stars on this movie in the assumption that anyone that has ever listened to Zeppelin enough would come away a rabid fan. I realize that this is not so, and it bugged me enough to put forth a revised justification for those four stars.    To enjoy this concert/movie, you have to be a fan. If you lived in a vacuum and this was your first exposure to the band, there is no guarantee that you would walk away loving them as so many of us hardcore fans do.  Bad editing, weird sound, the general creepiness that clings to some of the \\"music video before it was music video\\" scenes, and even those down to earth moments with the band are not something that just anyone can appreciate.      I have had it in my collection in some form or another since high school, and I still watch it when the mood hits me, enjoying it every time.  It's not something that I watch every day, and it never was.  But it's cool. It's enjoyable. It's fun. The creepy stuff has a haunting quality to it that draws you in, cheesy though it is, and the performances are not their absolute best (though Jimmy Page can never do wrong!). But if you are a true Zeppelin fan, it is an essential.     As I have grown older, I watch it less and less, but I still watch it, and may in fact, watch it tonight. Some of its magic is gone and I generally just prefer to listen to Zeppelin. However, it still shines with a certain timelessness that gives is a 4-star rating after all these years.
B0001US8EO|5.0|Many people draw comparisons between this film and \\"Tombstone\\" (released a year earlier). But what it really comes down to is personal taste. One is not better than the other. I consider them 1a and 1b in the \\"O.K. Corral\\" in the western movie mythos.<br /><br />My personal preference, obviously, is this film. I loved the epic feel of it. \\"Tombstone\\" for me, was more Hollywood with thinly drawn characters, who played second fiddle to the climactic battle, and lots of gunfighting. \\"Wyatt Earp\\" took its time. Some say that that is its biggest drawback. I never once felt the movie was getting long in the tooth. Following Earp around, watching him grow into the legend he'd become, was fascinating. There was more drama to it, more emotion. I absolutely adored this film and recommend it to any fan of Westerns and of Wyatt Earp in particular.<br /><br />As side note I'd like to say that anyone who believes Kilmer edged Quaid as Doc Holiday must not have been watching the same movie. Kilmer with his pale make-up and hollywood jezibelle accent just doesn't hold a candle Quaid. Qauid dropped 40 pounds for the role. His skin looked loose and sickly. His voice was a booming, phlegm-filled southern drawl accented with frequent bouts of severe coughing. Dennis Quaid became Doc Holiday, whereas Kilmer merely starred as the character. Unfortunately Quaid doesn't get half of the screen time as Kilmer, which is why Kilmer has become the popular choice.
B00001MXXH|4.0|Like another reviewer on this page, I must disagree with the editorial review that this movie is lost on the subsequent generations that see it.  I can't think of anyone that has seen this film as a teen and not liked it or related to it in some way. <br /> <br />Matthew Broderick is Ferris, a dry humored, too smart for his own good Chicago area high school student that decides to play hooky with his girlfriend Sloane (Mia Sara) and best friend, Cameron (Alan Ruck). Playing his jealous and malicious sister, Jeannie, is Jennifer Grey, in a memorably hilarious performance that takes her on a mission from hell to get her brother busted.  <br /> <br />The movie follows their adventures and the bittersweet realization that high school is not forever, as well as Cameron's own little rite of passage, which I will not give away here because Ruck does a great and believable job and its just fun to watch it unfold, especially the first time. <br /> <br />I could have given this movie 5 stars, but I refrained from such a high honor for two reasons.  You have to wonder how two people as lost and Mr. and Mrs. Bueller could have spawned such a genius in Ferris, for he fools them in ways that perhaps we all thought of while we were in high school, but knew that we would never get away with. No one actually would get away with such an elaborate set up, and no one could think ahead to the possibilities that this film presented and not be considered psychic. The elaborate set up also makes a person shake their head because it's not always so simple to get away with skipping school, but it's not breaking out of Bergen-Belsen either! <br /> <br />The second reason this film does not receive 5 stars is because while I stated and hold to the opinion that this is a timeless film that has its appeal to young kids today, it has been overplayed on television now for years, and I can only watch it once every few years, unlike \\"The Princess Bride\\", which I can watch over and over again withouttiring of it. <br />

0767817710|3.0|Sharon Stone is the star of this Western, in which she plays a vengeance minded gunslinger.  In this movie, she is supported by a strong cast, including Gene Hackman and Leonardo DiCaprio. Look for Russell Crowe as the preacher.  <br /> <br />Predictable, sometimes corny, other times just plain entertaining for all the wrong reasons, this is still a pretty watchable movie.  I am generally picky about my Westerns, and while this movie will likely never be in any top ten lists of best Westerns ever made, it is the type of movie that when it came out on cable, I ended up watching every time I was channel flipping and it was on.  It has its appeal. <br /> <br />Sharon Stone pulls off this role, and because she did, I respect her a lot more than I ever did before seeing this movie. Not because it was such a stellar acting job, or because the idea of a female Clint is so believable, but because after you get past the Stone bias that seems to exist among fans and critics, and once you get past the idea of a female in the  Clint role (c'mon, folks, it's the 1800s!), it's a fun movie.  <br /> <br />Sometimes, fun is what it's all about. <br />
0788815490|5.0|I have been seeing previews for \\"The Wings of the Dove\\" for years on various DVDs that I have rented and finally got around to watching this adaptation of the Henry James novel.  When I finished watching it the thing that struck me was how the attempt to modernize the story worked both for and against what James had written.  Now, what makes this a particularly perspective to take on the film is that the adaptation by Hossein Amini moves the time frame of the story up eight years to 1910.  That might seem a minor change, one scarcely worthy of note, but in 1902 good old Queen Victoria had not been in her tomb a year and the age that bears her name was still on its last legs (more to the point, James had been working on the novel for years, so it was clearly written during the Victorian Age).  When you change the setting to 1910 it is then the end of the Edwardian Age, which makes a big difference, especially from the standpoint of English morality.<br /><br />Kate Croy (Helena Bonham-Carter) has taken as her lover Merton Densher (Linus Roache), who has neither the position nor the fortune to win her hand.  Kate's father (Michael Gambon) is destitute, and they both depend on the good graces of her dour and demanding Aunt Maude (Charlotte Rampling), who forbids the union and has a rich man in mind for Kate who seems willing to marry for love but would like it even more if money was involved.  When Kate seeks independence from her aunt she enters the circle of Millie Theale (Alison Elliott), an American girl who is known as \\"the richest orphan in the world\\" and who is seeing the world before she dies, and a plan is hatched.  Merton will woo Millie, marry her before she dies, and inherit her fortune, at which point he can marry Kate and the life they envision will become reality.  I think you see it coming from a mile away that Merton will fall for Millie before she dies, and that there is a price to be paid for such an undertaken.<br /><br />James makes this story even more interesting because Millie harbors little if any illusions as to what Kate and Merton are up to.  Kate tells Merton their plan will succeed because she knows how Millie loves, but she never realizes that the same is true for the American girl.  Besides, Millie is touring Europe on her own agenda, which is to drink deeply from the cup of life before it is untimely ripped from her lips.  For her, Merton's attentions are something else to be experienced. Perhaps she knows that he will play the part so well that at some point he will stop acting, and perhaps it does not matter to her because when she is dead in grave the difference will not matter a whit.<br /><br />The shift in period matters because the master plan here runs more against the grain of Victorian morality than it does compared to the looser standards that followed.  Within another decade the English would be fighting a war involving machine guns, poisoned gas, bombs dropped from airplanes, and a new array of modern horrors.  Move the story forward another eight years and we would expect Kate's character to be urging Merton to murder Millie, which would actually make her more like the Kate in the novel than what we find in this 1997 film.<br /><br />In the end, the fact that Kate and Millie like each other and that Millie implicitly acknowledges and accepts the deal that is represented by Merton, makes a big difference.  The question is not whether the plan will work, but what will Merton and Kate be like when it is over and what will have happened to both their relationship and the plans that they have made.  Millie is in love with life, and some of that rubs off on Merton, so that he is not the man Kate sent off into the arms of another women.  In his attempt to get what he wants, he comes even closer to something he can never have and in the final scene all that Kate can offer to him seems rather hollow.<br /><br />The performances in \\"The Wings of the Dove\\" are, for the most part, beautifully understated.  Bonham-Carter was nominated for a Best Actress Oscar, as was Amini's adapted screenplay, Eduardo Serra's cinematography, and Sandy Powell's costume design.  Ultimately, I think Amini's decision to move the story forward from the end of one age to another, is on the mark and the changes that required in James' novel work if for no other reason than having Kate know how much she is risking in sending Merton to Millie's side from the very start makes the human drama much richer.tifully understated.

It reminds us all of when we were young and Big is a testament to why we should always stay young at heart. <br /> <br />Big is among my favorite films of all-time and I honestly can't see any reason why someone would dislike this movie. In fact I believe it is the best movie to be made in the 80's and it's huge heart will allow Big too stand the test of time.   <br />

Okay, maybe it isn't all THAT far fetched. Actually, Axl and crew did a decent job on most of these remakes. I remember most of these tunes. I dug their versions of the New York Doll's \\"Human Being\\", the Stooges cover \\"Raw Power\\", T. Rex's Marc Bolan's \\"Buick MacKane\\", Nazareth's \\"Hair Of The Dog\\" (always thought Axl got some heavy influence from this band) and the UK Sub's \\"Down On The Farm\\" (nice accent). There were a few that didn't do much for me, like Danzig's \\"Attitude\\" and Steve Jone's (Sex Pistols guitarist) \\"Black Leather\\". Okay disc just the same.
B0002858YS|5.0|I first heard the band on the radio out in LA while I was on vacation and I couldn't even wait to get home to buy the cd -- I was sold that quickly. For about a month or two I only listened to the singles which was the biggest mistake I could have made. The entire album is quality. Whether going on a long drive, or chillin out with the headphones on, it's an excellent way to spend 45 minutes. Had the opportunity to meet them in October and when they found out I couldn't get tickets cause the show was sold out, they put me and my friend on the guest list! Great guys, great musicians, great cd. That said, Brandon tends to sing a little flat live, so be warned ;-). Easily the best cd of the year.
B00063MBU8|4.0|Okay, I am NOT a big music person. I listen to the radio often, but I literally NEVER buy CDs. I bought this CD today, and this impulse buy was well worth $15. Crazy and Welcome to my life are great songs with very relatable messages. The DVD doesn't have anything of use to me except the lyrics though. If you're into pop, rock, songs with meaning, or punk, or any combination of those, should pick this CD up. Minimal swearing, ages 8+ is my oppinion.
B00009RDG9|3.0|The proposition of Tommy Lee Jones hunting down a psychotic Del Torro lured me in to watching this film. What I didn't know was that its a remake of Rambo with slightly altered characters and sub-plots.<br /><br />Del Torro plays Aaron Hallam an ex-soldier seriously traumatized by the horror he saw in Kosovo. We find out that Bonham (Tommy Lee Jones), who is sent to stop the killings was also the man that taught him how to kill. A great oppertunity to create a deep, psychological thriller. Unfortunately we get a rather shallow cat and mouse chase full of far-fetched action, while entertaining teenagers, this is nothing new for the rest of us.<br /><br />What I would have liked to have seen is a better character study of Hallam. Ok so he turns mad after Kosovo, but we never go deeper than that, this could have really boosted the character and the film. Jones was good, but didn't have the script to flex his muscles.<br /><br />Overall a decent action film, perfect for light entertainment on a Staurday night.
068987474X|4.0|because I feel the author is just a bit too smug. Both men and women have tremendous power over each other in relationships; but it is important to realize that this power is GIVEN to the partner(s) by each other. Once someone decides to stop the relationship for whatever reason, the power dies. Basically the friction on the eternal battle of the sexes stems from the biological fact that men are pragmatists and women are romantics. With men, what you see is exactly what you get; with women, there are multiple levels, and women will adapt to whatever persona they feel will keep the relationship going, we are chameleons, when it suits our purpose to be so. Women are deep and complicated, with a constant battle of emotion over reason, and emotion taking the wheel more often than we would wish. Most of the info in the book, is, IMHO, obvious to all but the most obtuse person, and there are, and always will be, some women who stubbornly cling to their fantasies and exist in their own denial; ignorance is, in some cases, almost bliss. I have been a relationship counselor for 5 years, and have heard many sad tales and broken heart stories, and I have learned one thing: \\"A man (or woman, as the case may be) convinced against his (or her) will, is of the same opinion still.\\" It is truly amazing how much grief we cause each other, and how much trauma we will withstand to wait for the prize that will never come. It is a lot of wasted time, and a lot of heartache expended needlessly, as some women refuse to learn from one bad relationship and leap, eyes wide open, into another non-relationship hoping this time it will be different. \\"The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result each time.\\"<br /><br />So, bottom line is, women, listen to your own instincts; if something feels wrong, it is; if you have suspicions, they are viable and if you feel something is missing, it is. One woman I counseled was so desperate, needy and emotionally dependent, she could only be classified as a stalker. So, if you want to understand men and yourselves better as far as relationships are concerned, by all means read this book, but supplement it with others. I was defensive reading it, and found myself irritated with Mr. Behrendt's POV on women in general...<br /><br />In closing, this is a great quote and very apt here: \\"Love to man t'is a thing apart; T'is woman's whole existence.\\"ionally dependent, she could only be classified as a stalker.

B00009L1TA|4.0|When I first saw Basic I was expecting a typical mindless action flick, instead I got an decent attempt at a sinister almost psychological thriller. There are plenty of twists and turns, some are predictable but some are genuinely suprising.<br /><br />Both John Travolta and Samuel Jackson are slated for taking poor scripts, but I don't think this is as bad as say, SWAT. In fact I thouroughly enjoyed watching Basic, two big stars both with a certain presence to them certainly helped. I won't give away too much of the plot, its better if you go into this film without a clue, the twists are that much more credible.<br /><br />I really can't see why so many people feel the need to moan about this film. Its sad that a lot of these 1 star reviews are from people who just have a grudge against Travolta or Jackson, just read them, hardly any say why the actual film is poor but slate the actor.

1594200106|5.0|I was surprised by the extreme negativity of some of the reviews.  I was also surprised by some of the positive ones, seeking to make comparisons with other authors.  My question is: why?  Is it really important that a work remind us of Garcia Marquez or Carlos Fuentes or Juan Goytisolo or Ernest Hemingway or anyone else?  I think the Shadow of the Wind stands well by itself and does not need to be similar to anything else.  It is a unique double-story, folding in upon itself, with great characters and development.  To me, the Shadow of the Wind was very much alive.  I felt the ambience of the city and of the vivid characters, even as some of them seemed trapped in a dream.<br /><br />The reviews of the Spanish edition of the Shadow of the Wind are far more positive than for the English version.  This makes me wonder about the translation.  I believe it may not have been an easy novel to translate, and often some of the idiomatic dialogue sounded awkward and off the mark.  Let's not forget that Barcelona is a city in which Catalan is spoken.  From there to Spanish to English, I have no doubt some of the freshness may have been dissipated.  It's hard to translate.<br /><br />NOTE:  (added later)  who keeps pushing all those \\"unhelpful\\" buttons for ALL the positive reviews?  I hope you are having fun wasting your seeimingly abundant time with this idiotic behavior.  Please seek immediate professional help for your peculiar little complex.
B000669GAI|5.0|Im writing reviews in search of broadening my musical horizons so to speak. its time to ditch the blink and killswitch and move on to the wide world of music. I grew up in Washington so i do love the alternative music. I hope i dont up in the same category either. <br /> <br />this review will truly have a bias because i am a pearl jam maniac. I am a true jammer that helps Pearl Jam arguably be the biggest cult band. this review is a great place to tell the story of how i came across this band. I had heard their names before, i dont know where, maybe just a mention. But it wasnt until Weight Training Freshman year that i found them. picture a geeky kid in weight training class frustrated as hell because all of his friends are lifting a lot more than he is with ease. I struggled and struggled but just could not keep up. frustrated, annoyed, and depressed i couldnt confide in anyone. One day i tried to do three reps of some ungodly weight for me and it did not turn out so pretty. My friends promptly did the same sets with ease and im sitting here just fumed. I overhear something though. \\"HUUUUUAAAAAHHH OHHHH OOOOOOHHHHHHH\\". it was beyond words. it was perfect, expressed all the feelings i had felt into this simple shout. I downloaded \\"Jeremy\\" as i found out that was what the song was called. then \\"Oceans\\" unplugged, then \\"Even Flow\\". i soon bought \\"Ten\\" and the rest is history.  <br /> <br />Many people when through the same thing i had. sadly, after ten and maybe even \\"Vs.\\" they stopped buying the records, maybe they moved on. I would have to... but the funny thing is they never really released another \\"Ten\\" like album, instead they grew as a band and so did i. my life and the albums perfectly coorellated. \\"Vs.\\" Much more angrier and viciousely toned and so many different issues that i was getting to know about. \\"Vitalogy\\" where the anger peaks and frustration and depression seeps in. \\"No Code\\" The crossroad album where im influenced by anything and everything. \\"Yield\\" the new beginning not forgetting my roots, the simplicty of life, but treading new ground. \\"Binaural\\" the transition into experimentation. \\"Riot Act\\" accepting my human flaws and encompassing what is important.  <br /> <br />the Greatest Hits doesnt take the same journey or a shortened version. it just highlights some of the points. I can see a casual listener not understanding how the transition between songs is so far apart. \\"Even flow\\" to \\"Hail Hail\\" everything is different. \\"Elderly Woman\\" to \\"Man of the Hour\\" the tone of the band is different. The band never changed, they just blossomed in different places. Its sad that the greatest hits concentrated on the early part of the band's career because it is a bit predictable even though we jammers love it.  <br /> <br />In my opinion If you are a true pearl jam fan then you would not like it if \\"ten\\" like albums were still released. Instead you respect the blossoming. And if you are a new fan who doesnt \\"riot act\\", then start growing from the beginning and you will see how good \\"riot act\\" really grows into  <br />
0446678430|3.0|this book really marked a turning point. after reading it i started trading in options and investing in real estate. its has a lot of good advice, but like his other books has no real steps you can implement. for that you'll need to look elsewhere.

I grew up in Washington so i do love the alternative music. I hope i dont up in the same category either.<br /><br />If you have come across Nirvana and Pearl Jam chances are that you will stumble onto Soundgarden. the most accessible pre-90's alternative group had their first commercial success with -Badmotorfinger-. To introduce myself to the band i bought -A-Sides-, There was some truly memorable singles on that album. Most of the songs came after Badmotor and i got used to the sound. Badmotorfinger is much different than the sound of A-Sides. it is even different from the two singles, \\"Rusty Cage\\" and \\"Outshined\\". both singles seem to be tamest and most understandable of the CD. most of the CD is very hard to digest and needs numerous listens to actually understand how everything fits in. It is super heavy. Thayil makes everything as heavy and syrupy as possible and his solos come across screechingly but still buried in the heaviness. The Bass is very distroted adding to the heaviness. Cameron is mechanic in drumming and plays so much off-time rhythms that it throws the mind off. And there is cornell. every song he seems to try to get his unique banshee like scream to battle with the heaviness of thayil. so the band sounds very conflicted all the time. i separate the cd into two parts. Everything before \\"With my Good eye closed\\" and everything after. all the singles come before. Excellent drumming on \\"Jesus Christ Pose\\" which is a one of a kind, \\"Slaves and Bulldozers\\" a song which formed into the entire Superunknown album and later Soundgarden sound. \\"Face pollution\\" which sounds like its from the early years, much like \\"Get on the Snake\\". every song in the first half has varying effects which leads to \\"With my good eye closed\\". This is my favorite song, it is complete and soaring and i love the outro. the guitars and vocals blend and intertwine perfectly. the second half is much more consistent and hard to digest. I personally liked all of the second half but i have to tell you there is little to no hooks, the guitars are meant to sound muddy, the choruses are very confusing. they are all good songs but it takes more than a few listens to take it all in. Overall i like this album and this band has a lot of potential but i wouldnt recommend  it to casual listeners just because of the complexity. listen to it after you heard the later Soundgarden.
B0002ZDVEU|3.0|Let me just say...in spite of what I say here, the movie is a good one.   <br /> <br />Hey, hold the camera still darn it!!  Can't tell what is going on or who's hitting who.  I saw The Bourne Identity in the Theater recently.  There were a couple of intense fight scenes where the camera effect is just too much.  Ok, so it may add some panic or intensity, maybe even some adrenaline rush.  The thing is, you can't see what the heck is going on.  I want to see the action.  This HEAVY juggling of the camera all over the place makes me think they're trying to hide some badly choreographed fighting. <br />The first and second film have interesting story lines to follow.  Matt Damon plays well.  I don't get the bad acting distraction like, hey this guy is trying to act and failing miserably, like with Ben Affleck. <br /> <br />p.s. I don't have the DVD, just saw the film on screen.
B00005OWEG|2.0|Whenever a \\"director's cut\\" edition of a movie is released, regardless of the scope or level of success the movie enjoyed originally, the first question that should automatically come to mind is \\"If the 'extra footage' was so important, why was it slashed in the first place?\\"<br /><br />\\"Apocalypse Now\\" as it was originally released was an absolute masterpiece of a movie...the character development was precisely where it needed to be; Martin Sheen did a fine job of portraying a solo Special Forces operator assigned to locate and \\"terminate with extreme prejudice\\" a renegade Green Beret colonel whose \\"methods...have become...unsound\\" (yet spectacularly and embarrassingly successful).  In the original theatrical version Sheen is clearly damaged goods himself; slowly losing his grip on reality as he waits in a Saigon hotel room for the release of a mission to return him to the only world in which he now feels comfortable; the jungles of Vietnam.  On the way he meets an assorted array of characters with whom he interracts but never sufficiently connects, an entirely appropriate relationship given the nature of his own character and the professional nature of that character's mission.<br /><br />The \\"Redux\\" version of \\"Apocalypse Now\\" instead does everything possible to humanize Sheen's character [...]particularly with his bonding more closely to the crew of the patrol boat that escorts him to his destination.  What should come off as expansion of a character instead results in an uneven \\"ping-ponging\\" effort that makes Sheen's character appear almost schizophrenic as he riccochets from being \\"one of the boys\\" by stealing Robert Duvall's surfboard and liaissoning with the Playboy bunnies further up the river to being the stone-cold killer we know him to be by nearly throttling a supply sergeant and shooting a wounded teenaged Vietnamese girl in lieu of diverting his mission to take her to an aid station.<br /><br />The exception, I feel, is the \\"French Plantation\\" scene.  This actually gives a sense of history that the casual filmviewer unfamiliar with the history of Vietnam may find interesting.  And it adds another surreal twist to a film already awash in surreality; it could not inaccurately be described as Vietnam on acid, and seeing Sheen's character taking opium as he beds a widowed French aristocrat only further adds to the aimless direction his life takes when not consumed by his mission.<br /><br />My recommendation for anyone who hasn't seen either version is to watch (and stick with) the orginal 1979 version.  Although the downgrading in price for the \\"Redux\\" version in comparison to the original cut does make it somewhat attractive as an impulse buy, the movie studio's initial instinct to release the film cut as it was in 1979 proves to be, in my opinion, the correct one.sense of history that the casual filmviewer unfamiliar with the history of Vietnam may find interesting.

B000002A3T|5.0|I recently bought this right after I bought a Led Zeppelin cd set and this gave me a good start to Pink Floyd. For starters this cd is great. It was better then what I expected. I did listen to Dark Side of the Moon and Pulse and thought they were awesome. The guitar is great in this cd and the vocals are very well sung and have interesting lyrics. Keyboard is also used a lot in this album which is cool too. Poles apart is probably my fav. song on the album but High Hopes is also very good. Songs like Marooned and Cluster One have no vocals but are still great and feature cool solos on guitar and the keyboard. <br /> <br />Well for this cd I was amazed and I think everyone should have this cd even if they don't own a PF album but I would also recommend Dark Side of The Moon. <br /> <br />SONG RATINGS: <br />1.

B0000AUHPB|4.0|It is true that original ideas in Hollywood are even rarer than lasting show-biz marriages, but the remake of the '60's British classic \\"The Italian Job\\" stands out as the glaring example of the industry trying to pass off flash and flair in the guise of eye-candy actors and high-tech special effects in place of the human elements of acting chemistry and film craftsmanship.<br /><br />The 1969 version of \\"The Italian Job\\" succeeded on so many levels; it was a fantastic film that was well-indicative of its time (the afterglow of the sexual revolution as well as the London fashion boom seen recently only on a second-hand basis from the Austin Powers movies in addition to Ing-er-lund's winning of the 1966 World Cup, British hipsters could actually display the Union Jack and sing \\"Rule, Britannia\\", unthinkable for the UK apologists of today) as well as a crime caper with a decidely different twist to the wit of say, the Rat Pack version of \\"Ocean's 11\\".  And the distinctly European take on the car chase already iconocized in Steve McQueen's \\"Bullitt\\" demonstrated by the use of the ORIGINAL bumper-to-bumper crumple zoned Mini Coopers as opposed to the full-throated Detoit muscle flexed by \\"Bullitt\\"'s Dodge Charger and Ford Mustang is ably accentuated by some of the best stunt driving seen in a generation among some of the most beautifully picturesque backdrops in the world.<br /><br />This is an admittedly dated, though terrifically quirky and extremely fun movie to watch.  It's a fine example of why Michael Caine was one of the most charming actors of his generation and another example of what a movie can be when given over to human inspiration and creativity as opposed to a cookie-cutter script handed over to an overzealous special effects department.  Rent the Wahlberg/Theron/Norton remake if you must; it's a good enough example of the quick fix mentality that prevents anything new and original from succeeding in Hollywood today.  But for an example of a wonderfully produced and well-filmed classic MOVIE, this one's worth adding to the serious film afficinado's collection.ly produced and well-filmed classic MOVIE, this one's worth adding to the serious film afficinado's collection.

0451191153|1.0|The Fountainhead, like any of Rand's works, fails on both the literary level and the philopsophical level. Sure, it is marginally less painful reading than the later Atlas Shrugged, mostly since it is more concise (no 50+ page speeches) and slightly better-developed in terms of storyline. Still, this is ANYTHING but exemplary reading to anyone with more than marginal gray matter between their ears. In fact, if you're over the age of 18 and not a self-absorbed Randian objectivist, I almost guarantee that you will despise this book.<br /><br />As a novel, it's awful. In any Rand book, characters can be divided into one of two broad catagories: Nietzschean \\"heroes\\" and narcissistic \\"men of vision\\" who subscribe wholecloth to Rand's half-assed excuse of a philosophy; or pathetic, sniveling \\"villians\\" (men of religion, believers in charity and goodwill, sane people, anyone who doesn't believe 100% in \\"rugged individualism\\" and the baggage that it implies). I've seen deeper characterization in an episode of Pokemon. No one is likeable, and most of the time there's nothing a reader can even remotely relate to in any of these characters. The writing and prose are amateurish and longwinded; watching the English language abused in the service of Rand's ad hominems and straw men was like taking a staple to the forehead for every page I read. Pure agony. The speeches could make one choke, or laugh hysterically with how overblown and unrealistic they are. I don't care if Rand wasn't a native English speaker--this inexcusable dialogue is more wooden than Keanu Reeves.<br /><br />As philosophy, it's even more horrendous, not to mention impractical and downright dangerous. The basic tenet of objectivism, when boiled down to its essence, is self-serving greed above all else. Howard Roark, the \\"hero\\" that Rand wishes her readers to idolize is a coldly intellectual, mysognistic sociopath and rapist with a superiority complex the size of Greenland. If THIS is the model objectivist, I can only conclude that Rand's philosophy is truly anti-human.<br /><br />Yes, self-interest to a certain extent is necessary and good, and it is noble to strive for excellence. But this sort of extreme ruthless greed (\\"every genius for himself\\") justifies Social Darwinism, fascism, lawlessness, exploitation, genocide and every other kind of social ill in the name of \\"utopia.\\" It's the stuff of Hitler's dreams. And there's no economic basis for Rand's philosophy either--capitalism succeeds in part due to a willingness to exchange ideas and goods. Rand's works betray a caricaturish concept of modern capitalism, where sheer avarice wins above all. Needless to say, this doesn't hold up in the real world (think Enron).<br /><br />In short, The Fountainhead is the nadir. Go read something of redeeming value to scratch that philosophical itch: Hobbes, Locke, Machiavelli, Nietzsche. All true philosophers who had their unique ideas swiped and distorted to feed Rand's foolish ramblings.ist, I can only conclude that Rand's philosophy is truly anti-human.  <br /> <br />Yes, self-interest to a certain extent is necessary and good, and it is noble to strive for excellence.

B0002Y69NG|4.0|Why haven't I seened the name Sophia Stewart pop up on any of these reviews as of yet? <br /> <br />On October 4th 2004 she won a court case over the Warner Brothers, Joel Silver and the Wachowskis for copyright infringement and racketeering, among other allegations. <br /> <br /> <br />You see, Ms. Stewart wrote a manuscript entitled \\"The Third Eye\\" and submitted it to the Wachowskis in 1981, and it has been proven (and upheld in court) that it is essentially the same story as The Matrix. <br /> <br />I am unfortunately unable to provide a link to a news source that covered this story, because it's inappropriate comment protocol.  But I encourage you to seek out the truth for yourselves (as Morpheus might ask).  Search Google or any reputable search engine for Sophia Stewart, SLCC GlobeLink, or The Third Eye (which is the title of her original manuscript). <br /> <br />You may very well ask, \\"why haven't I heard about this?\\"  It's probably because Warner Brothers' parent company, AOL Time-Warner, owns about 95%+ of mainstream media. <br /> <br />I was personally disheartened to discover that the Wachowskis essentially STOLE The Matrix, but now it's easy to understand why the first one was so brilliant and the sequels floundered aimlessly: they weren't written by the same people.
B000089RVX|4.0|As the constrictive walls between orchestrated classical music and modern metal have been hazily blurring, few have stepped through the sea of fog to challenge the listeners yearning ear. In dictionary terms, Evanescence is the act or state of vanishing away; the disappearance of vapor(s), of a dream, or of earthly plants or hopes. The solid reality however, is a group concluding their second world tour in support of their quadruple-platinum album \\"Fallen\\". Lee is the only acting original member of the Little Rock, Arkansas quartet following songwriter/guitarist Ben Moody's sudden departure on October 24, 2003 during their European tour. To finish out the tour, second guitarist John LeCompt took over both of the guitar parts, and the band has now named Terry Basalmo of COLD as Moody's permanent replacement. Lee's voice shines like a shoreline lighthouse in a winter squall, drawing from a steady influence of Bjork and Tori Amos on \\"Fallen\\". The breakneck crescendo of the group's popularity has done little to hinder the creative processes. Despite relentless touring, they are anxious to return to the studio to utilize new ideas.

B00003CXZ4|3.0|I don't want to repeat here what's been said in many other reviews.  The acting was okay, some cast members were better than others, and the main gimmick is the backwards time of the movie.  It literally starts with the end and shows the viewer, snippet by snippet, how the characters ended up there.      What's philosophically important in all this is the \\"meaning\\" of the first (and in a way, last) scene.  The main character has no short-term memory.  What this does is make it impossible for him to put together a coherent narrative of his own life.  To counter this he leaves himself notes, and even tattoos (pretty lame actually), to help him pick up his own life story where he left off.  The problem is, no note can ever be detailed enough and the notes he leaves are far too open to misinterpretation to be of good use.  He ends up stringing together a personal narrative that does not match reality.      In this sense, the movie is a foil to postmodern philosophies that hold that there is no more meaning to the world than individual narratives.  The movie shows what happens when one person's narrative does not match the true history and reality of the events...people die.  The main character's desire to have a meaningful life after all meaning has been stolen from him, even if he must ignore inconvenient facts to create that meaning, leads to disaster.  Read this against current US events, I have in mind the President's narrative regarding Iraq versus the actual history and true meaning of events, and the tragedy in the movie pales in comparison to what can happen in real life when narrative is corrupted by emotion and desire.      Overall, I give it only three stars because once you figure out the time sequencing thing, the ending is fairly predictable.  Also, in many ways, it is unbelievable.  I mean, where were the police as he was killing these people?  Who would tattoo those messages onto him (there's no way he could have done all of them with his homemade ballpoint pen cum tattoo needle)?  Also, the character Dodd just disappears despite being a [...] he beat up, put in a closet, and then just let go.  It seems to me he would have come back to get revenge.  Maybe that happens after the move begins-ends.

Here's what I heard in themes from beginning to end. <br /> <br />Whine about being a middle class american. <br />Whine about the news media. <br />Whine about his parents. <br />Whine about being a pothead. <br />Whine about his suicidal friend. <br />Whine about his dead friend. <br />and finally.... <br />Whine about breaking up with his girlfriend. <br /> <br />No big payoff, nothing profound, just a bunch of typical punker whining.  <br /> <br />I expected more from an OPERA.  <br /> <br />Music is still solid power pop punk that is very simple yet sounds good. The only difference in this album & Green Day's previous efforts: More Whining, and all the songs are linked together without stops.

B000255LNE|3.0|I am a huge Phil Collins fan and while I have most of his releases, I was looking forward to another collection of this release. His 1998 collection titled \\"Hits\\" (well it does get to the point) did a good job of amassing his most successful songs and it was easily a 4 + star effort and I was hungry for more. Unfortunately this collection just does not cut it as it is way too bland and cannot justify a 2 CD set.<br /><br />Although the above may sound harsh, I am not one of those Phil Collins bashers who blast his thin voice and still have not forgiven him for somehow not living up to what they wanted Genesis to be after Peter Gabriel's departure. Phil picked up the torch and brought the band additional commercial appeal and along the way become an unlikely (yet much deserved) solo superstar. I think that several of his releases, especially \\"Face Value,\\" \\"No Jacket Required,\\" the amazing yet underperforming \\"But Seriously,\\" and the grossly ignored \\"Both Sides\\" are as good as pop gets.<br /><br />While it may have seemed like the perfect idea to release a set of love songs, especially those that were not necessarily hits, the end result lacks variety, poignancy and misses out on what could have been an opportunity to expand on 1998's \\"Hits\\" by putting his favorites and those that did not make the cut the first time around. Part of Phil's appeal to me is that he knows his strengths and limits and most of the time he hits it out of the ballpark by balancing his work with the right touch of earnestness and, especially in the case of \\"No Jacket Required,\\" a killer combo of trumpets and a guest list that others would kill for. Here we have back-to-back songs that sound too alike, some overlooked gems, a lot of filler (what's up with 4 songs while overlooking over must have classic \\"love songs\\" from Phil careers?). Having said that there are a few interesting morsels via previosly an unreleased song, especially the opener on the 1st CD (\\"Tearing and Breaking\\"), and \\"Can't Hold Back The Years,\\" which has to be one of Phil's most underrated songs that for some reason did explode onto the charts.<br /><br />In a nutshell if you are a hardcore fan, this release is not going to add anything truly valuable to your collection. Even the inserts are uninspired and stingy considering the price of the release. For the average fan, stick to 1998's \\"Hits\\" and if you fall somewhere in between you may want to make your own version of \\"Hits\\" by adding those songs that are must haves for you. I give this release 3.5 stars and hope to hear some new material soon.ars,\\" which has to be one of Phil's most underrated songs that for some reason did explode onto the charts.

B00005JMUL|5.0|Wow! That is an awesome movie! The animation is just incredible, what the director and writers can do is just unbliveable! Every Christmas Eve until I was about 10 years old, my dad would read me the story. And now seeing the movie I am just amazed! I would encourage everyone of any age boy or girl to see this movie, it's well worth your money, and a great holiday choice!
B0002858YS|4.0|There are several thoughts that run through my mind regarding the debut album from The Killers. One thing is that it's about time the punk/new wave movement from the late 70's/early 80's got recycled. I'm sure there are others around my age (32) that miss this type of music since we experienced it first hand. The influences are apparent on \\"Hot Fuss\\"--The Cars, The Cure, The Smiths, The Church, The Cult, Joy Division, Depeche Mode, New Order, Bauhaus, Oasis, Blur, etc. But this is a good thing, because I'm tired of streamlined rap/hip-hop, grunge rock wannabes, and over-slick production on most top 40 songs in the past eight years. Maybe teenagers will now understand the value of depressive, melancholy and angry music like it was meant to be heard. I don't mind the derivativeness of The Killers if it means that a new generation will be turned on to this genre of music.<br /><br />As for the music, well it's exactly what I hoped for after hearing \\"Somebody Told Me\\". Despite other reviews, I think this is an energetic and inspiring entry into this genre of music. 11 tracks clocking in at 45 minutes is just perfect, and all the songs fit together nicely with not one track being conspicuously weaker than the others.<br /><br />If you find yourself interested in The Killers, go back and listen to the original new wave artists I mentioned above. You can also look into the second generation such as Coldplay, White Stripes, Keane, Snow Patrol, Franz Ferdinand, Interpol, The Music, The Postal Service, Jet, The Strokes, Dogs Die In Hot Cars, Kaiser Chiefs, Louis XIV, The Futureheads, Bloc Party, Caesars and Yeah Yeah Yeahs.<br /><br />If you're looking for something new, you could do worse in 2004/2005, than buying The Killers' debut album \\"Hot Fuss\\". Check it out.
B00013RC9I|2.0|\\"It's just another day / you will lose it anyway,\\" sing the French duo on their latest offering, and maybe Air should listen to their own words, because I think they are indeed losing it. The group's debut CD, 1998's excellent Moon Safari, joined the ranks of Moby's Play as electronic groove music that found mass appeal mostly because it was hooky as hell.  Ditties like \\"Sexy Boy\\" and \\"Remember\\" kept the digital crowd delighted while reeling in all the rest.  The group has stumbled since then, and on Talkie Walkie, the songs range from whistling doo-dah meets outer space (\\"Alpha Beta Gaga\\") to New Age Asian (\\"Alone in Kyoto\\") to flat out Euro-snooze.  And because there's not much to enjoy lyrically (sample: \\"Your blood is red / it's beautifully genetically\\"), one must focus on the tunes, which are so somnolent that the album--I swear to God--ends with sounds of the tide lapping against the shore.  Only on \\"Cherry Blossom Girl, \\"Run,\\" and the instrumental \\"Mike Mills,\\" does the duo approach past achievement.  Surprisingly, Air is still going strong, bolstered by filmmaker Sofia Coppola's apparent love for their vision.  And if you've seen Coppola's Lost in Translation, you'll realize that her judgment is thematically sound.  After all, what better music to feature in a film that portrays a trip to Japan as an insulated, sterile, airport-like event than new age elevator music?    Standout Tracks: \\"Cherry Blossom Girl,\\" \\"Run\\"    For more reviews, visit [...]
0553212443|5.0|This classic will live on eternally. Every Christmas I see at least ten different versions of this book on tv. <br />          <br />           A dream changes a man for the better, and gives him a <br />new life and turns his enemies into friends. This book gave me  <br />such a special feeling, as do the movies. <br /> <br />           I recommend this book for anyone who hasn't read it <br />yet, and I give it five stars:)
B00018D44U|2.0|I had resisted the Norah Jones train as long as I could, being possibly the only biped in the western world who hadn't spun Come Away With Me in the CD player while I folded laundry, cooked my evening meal, or filled out my tax forms online.  I had also firmly decided that Norah Jones listeners must fit into three groups: A) those who viewed essential jazz as Harry Connick Jr., B) those who viewed essential classical music as Charlotte Church, and C) those who preferred the acoustic version of \\"Layla\\" to the electric.  In short: those who had left the land of rock and roll--without even realizing so, perhaps--and washed up against the soothing shores of easy listening.  I still stand by these categorical assumptions, but that doesn't mean I won't make concessions.  Jones has a warm, powerful, sometimes sultry voice, and I like the way she blends jazz with country with blues without pigeonholing herself into any of the genres.  I also like the way she usually resists oversinging; this is a woman who has unbelievable command over her voice and knows when to show restraint; this is no Whitney Houston or Mariah Carey.  She has more in common with a laid-back Bonnie Raitt or a Lucinda Williams who studied voice at college.  Jones did study jazz piano at college, and the pedigree occasionly shows; there's something too calculated, too sharp about the songs here.  In fact, midway through the CD, the mind starts to wander, and by the end of the CD, the hand wants to reach for Lucinda Williams' Car Wheels on a Gravel Road, for when Lucinda swears that by the time she reaches Jackson she won't miss her man, you can already see her shedded skin shriveling on the highway where she pitched it out the car window.  When Jones sings about the baby in the backseat and the father who now lives on his own and has sworn off the bottle, you want to check Jones's university transcripts to see if she enrolled in a family studies class.  Jones is young, but she is also very, very, very talented.  She'll only get better, and I'll probably eat all these words one day.  But not this day.     For more reviews, visit [...]

B00006DEFA|5.0|Pure, and utter perfection in movie making. <br />Historical discrepencies aside, this is a movie first. <br />And, like all great movies, it can be viewed as several different stories. <br />One is the story of the life of Mozart.  Again, not terribly historically acurate, but there it is. <br />One is the story of a man (Salieri) who is racked with envy. <br />One of the story of that same man that is at odds with his god that he so believed blessed him. <br /> <br />F. Murray Abraham is in reality the main focus of the movie and he was totally amazing. <br />His change from the begining of the movie when he is talking with the priest to how they both then look at the end says it all. <br />Absolutely fantasic.  6 out of 5 stars. <br />One of the greatest movies of all time. <br />
B00005JNBQ|5.0|I saw this Napoleon Dynamite when it had a very brief theatre run in my area a few months ago. I'm not sure how they chose to market this film, but I could not believe that it did not get the notoriety that I believe it should have. I don't want to get too much into the synopsis since it's probably covered in the Amazon Editorial Review, but I can say that Napoleon Dynamite is a film that everyone from 16 to 60 can relate to because we all go through at some point in our life what this main character goes through. I highly recommend this film and if I could give 100 stars I would. Some are already calling this a future Cult Classic and I would have to agree.

B0001FR3IQ|1.0|This film does not provoke a gothic atmosphere. No, not at all. More like a sterile, monochrome and lifeless. So I'm afraid the title is a complete and utter lie.<br /><br />As a horror film this is a total potboiler. As a Dark Castle production it's the worst yet. Why on earth would a freshly won Oscar-winning actress do such drek?<br /><br />The story is the most predictable and boring ever. You can literally see all the twists and revelations coming. There are also gaping holes in the logic. Such as if the ghost of Rachel can have a physical effect on the real world, then why would she need Miranda at all?<br /><br />Well there wouldn't be a film if the director realized this. But then again, that would be a good thing. A complete waste of time! Zemeckis and Silver should know better.<br /><br />The DVD is in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen with Dolby 5.1 sound. There are extras but I don't care.
076790592X|4.0|Absolutely lovely book. A definite must buy. Once you have read it, you will be recommending it to a lot of friends too.<br /><br />It starts with an ex student connecting with a much loved professor when he learns that the professor has only a few months to live. It is about the conversations betweens these 2, every Tuesday on a variety of topics like Death, Forgiveness, Marriage.... In the meanwhile it also gives you a glimpse into the lives of them both.<br /><br />The book cant really be described, it can only be read & recommended.<br /><br />After reading it, I'm inspired to reconnect and really talk with the senior members of my family, a large number of whom are over 75.
0780627024|5.0|Anyone who only saw the first ten minutes of this film would mistake it for something lightweight and fancy, a chance to show off special effects in order to capitalize on nostalgia for the 50's.  That would be wrong.  This movie is a sometimes agonizingly subtle commentary on the modernist yearning for a simpler past and how far we have really come.  Take the following essay questions as hints as to what's really going on in the film:  (1) Why doesn't Jennifer transform until she reads Lady Chatterly?  (2) Why must it be Lady Chatterly rather than some other book?  (3) Why does the wall mural resemble Picasso's Guernica?  (4) Why are we initially misled into believing that the only ingredient necessary for the transformation is sex?  (5) Why are they safe in the bowling alley? (6) How is David different at the end of the film than at the beginning?  etc.
6305949980|5.0|I saw this movie in the theaters when it first came out, and it was the first time I left the theater wishing I could watch it again when I got home. I bought the VHS the first day it came out, and now I'm a proud owner of the DVD. The art direction is possibly the best part of the whole project, but the music and theme all tie in perfectly to make it a must-see title around the holidays, or practically whenever you're sifting through your collection. If you haven't seen it yet and you're thinking \\"it looks good\\", then just give it a shot. I'm sure you'll have a lot of fun.
0517543052|5.0|Spritual ideas are simple - it's the practice that's difficult. This shows us the fun and the ideas and also gives us hint of what true spirituality can bring us - mind over matter and control over ones destiny. The book is useful for any level of the spiritual journeyman. It can be opened and referenced like the I Ching. It's a great and humble energy to have lying around.
B000683VI4|5.0|the notebook is the best romantic movie that i have ever seen!!! it is truly a love story that a lot of people can relate with!!!! everyone needs to buy this movie!!!
B0001VWP8I|5.0|This is a phenomenal CD. Anastacia blended pop & rock perfectly just like Pat Benatar did! This is truly a masterpiece! She could sing ANYTHING and it would sound good because she has such an awesome & unique voice! Such a powerhouse! I don't know why she has not gained the success here (USA) like she should. It's all quality and a PERFECT voice! Left Outside Alone is great along with I Do, to the slower Heavy On My Heart. I like all the songs on here except Pretty Little Dum-Dum...boring!  lol  But, this CD is a MUST for existing fans and people who are looking to listen to something that breaks the mold by someone with an astonishing voice! You will not be disappointed!
B00005JMJ4|1.0|Possibly the biggest letdown in video viewing over the last 5 years. Just terrible. Medocrity reigns supreme in today's video world it seems.  Keeps on getting worse as one attempts to hang on. It is beyond depressing. I see the rave reviews but then again recall that a Big Mac w/fries is considered by some to be fine dining.    The main two characters are the trouble. Vapid, empty and depressing ... but that seems to what many enjoy. Go figure ... :)    On the postive side, films like this make almost everything else better ... after this one, I have to give 'watching paint dry' at least 2 stars. It must the Prozac or something in the water. Just a terrible film is all.
B0000DD7LC|5.0|This CD is truly genuine! It is great from start to finish! In my opinion MUCH BETTER than her 1st effort. Although her first CD was good, too....this one just soars! Not just all piano but has some really jammin' beats to it! My favorite song on here is \\"Karma\\"-----awesome song!  Heartburn is another really good tune as well. There is maybe 1 or 2 songs I don't really care much for but the majority are great! A must have!!!!!
B00005JLEX|5.0|I got a good deal on this DVD at dvdspree_com
B0002858YS|5.0|This album is truly great, but if you are planning on buying it, do yourself a favor and get the UK version. It has a different song, called 'Glamorous Indie Rock n' Roll' which is the highlight of this album. I wouldn't recommend getting both, as they only vary by one song - just get the UK version.
B00063MBU8|4.0|The songs are great, good music and lyrics, surpassing other groups whose sound pretends to be different but at the end is the same. Welcome To My Life is one of the best songs in years!
B00005JNEI|5.0|This film is quite brilliant. As Mike LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle commented, \\"In the 90-year history of the American feature film there has never been a popular election-year documentary like this one.\\" The film won the Palme d'Or at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival. Millions of people across the world have now seen the film.<br /><br />Moore tells us about the botched war against Al Qa'ida, and how the US state was completely unprepared for the attack, even though bin Laden had declared war on the USA in 1996. He details how the Bush administration, although repeatedly warned of an imminent attack, prepared no counter-attack and took an amazing two months to launch a military response.<br /><br />Moore reminds us that the 9/11 Commission found `no credible evidence' of any link between Iraq and Al Qa'ida. Vice-President Dick Cheney responded to this Report by repeating robotically that there was `overwhelming evidence'. President Bush added helpfully, \\"The reason I keep insisting that there was a relationship between Iraq and Saddam and Al Qa'ida is because there was a relationship between Iraq and Al Qa'ida.\\"<br /><br />Moore denounces Bush and Blair's diversionary attack on Iraq, a country which has never attacked the USA or Britain and has never threatened to attack the USA or Britain. This unnecessary war of aggression has cost the USA more than a thousand soldiers' lives, and $166 billion, so far.
B000002UYZ|2.0|The opitomy (spelling??) of how stupid this album is as a whole is the one song \\"Paperback Writer\\".  The rest of the songs make even less sense, except for maybe a few, or they sound like rehashings of songs already on this Cd; \\"Hard Day's Night\\", \\"Eight Days a Week\\" and \\"Can't Buy me Love\\" are the kinds of songs even a kareoke singer could have made a living off of if they knew how to write a basic song AND they all sound the same.  The rest of the songs are just plain too darn easy to overlook 'cause they're STUPID!!! <br />  If I were to give The Beatles credit for being good songwriters I would use most of the songs from the companion to this CD - 1967-1970 - as examples.
B00003CX8V|5.0|They don't make movies like this any more. Jack Lemmon at his frenetic best, Shirley MacLaine has this part in her pocket. And the supporting cast is a talented group of actors you will love and love to hate. The story is as old as time with a new twist that is still relevant 40 years later. Will Mr. Baxter and Miss Kubelik survive the climb up the coprporate ladder? We're rooting for them! <br /> <br />
B00000JLWW|2.0|Whether or not you choose to board this Titanic sinker, it's hard to feel that one more of 1750 Amazon reviews would make any conceivable difference.  Aficionados of Titanic would continue loving the film no matter what, while detractors would count it one of life's cardinal sins to catch the movie again.  A modern-day cultural phenomenon, perhaps only matched by Gone with the Wind in its appeal, this gigantic blockbuster has now earned over US$1 billion in box office worldwide.  And it's not difficult to see why, it has a bit of everything: disaster movie, romantic tearjerker, heart-quickening action and a bit of period flavor.    The story is simple and simplistic: rich girl meets poor boy (an artist) on a liner, who promises to liberate her from her evil and scheming fiance, while Titanic hits an iceberg and threatens to sink all.  With them are a motley crew of really smug upper-classers, some stoic fellows (including ensemble musicians) and Cameron's roving, know-it-all camera.    What irritates most about Titanic is the greed with which James Cameron confronts his materials: here is a director who wants a bit of every thing in his pie so the result is an overbloated long drawn-out romance/disaster movie/action epic which is exceptional in some departments but irritatingly infantile in others.  Never mind the cheesy script, with a cringingly moralistic message tacked out at the end (\\"life is worth living; someone loves you\\").  If the mark of a true director is the perspicuity with which he deals with his material, I'm sorry Cameron fails this test.    What then, is left to say for this movie?  For the record, the sets are pleasantly authentic and so too are the costumes, so at least 2 of its Oscar statuettes are deserved, but it's difficult still not to see its US$200 million as extravagant overspending.  For acting, neither Kate Winslet nor Leonardo DiCapprio sets the world alight, but really it doesn't matter as they are relegated to types rather than psychologically intriguing personnels.  It's endurable as a piece of narrative.  The best parts of the film ironically are the action sequences which hark back to Cameron's progeny as an action director and the sinking of the ship, which is tantalisingly real.  But *someone* must have known Cameron stole a lot from the superior \\"Night to Remember\\"? In the end, Jack's death will polarise audience, and I suspect I may not be the only one finding Celine Dion's never-ending theme ad naseum at the end.  But 'nuff said: even pretenders like Pearl Harbor can't match the staying powers of Rose and Jack.
B0002OERI0|1.0|I'll start by saying that the song \\"American Idiot\\", gets my vote for worst song of the year.  The anti-Bush and anti-Republican lyrics just sound so corny and lame coming from Green Day.  They sing about not wanting Americans to be controlled by the media and yet they are using their song to influence the opinions of as many of their fans as possible.  Can you say hypocrisy?   <br /> <br />Then the band claims that they are, \\"not part of a redneck agenda,\\" to which my intially responses were 1.) um....good for you 2.) um...neither am I. Hey, I have something in common with Green Day! 3.) Bush and his cronies are wealthy oil tycoons, not rednecks living in a shack in the woods somewhere. Just because they have a ranch in Texas doesn't make them rednecks.  Stupid lyric. <br /> <br />The other big song is supposed to be \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\".  In this song, the singer claims whines about always walking alone.  The truth is that Billie Joe has millions of fans and I'm sure they have made plenty of friends privately in his life AND he's married AND in the actual video, he's walking with his other two band members. He's not even alone in the video!  This song is just a sloppy attempt to appeal to a bunch of lonely and perhaps depressed kidds out there. <br /> <br />I don't have time to give detailed comments on the other songs, but I can tell you for a fact that they are quite bland. <br /> <br />Avoid this album at all costs.

B00005AQGH|5.0|This CD is great.  Every song is good.  A very deep, dark album, with great lyrics, awesome beats, and nice apperances from the outlawz. He mentions alot about being shot in NYC, and dieing.  He also disses alot of people on this album, like Jay-Z, Biggie, NAS, P. Diddy, Mobb Depp, and more.    Songs 2,3,4,9,10,12 are popular classics.      1. Bomb First (My Second Reply) 9/10 - A a good way to start off an album, fast, hard, rappin and dissin people.     2. Hail Mary - 10/10 One of the many classic songs on this album.  This is a very well known and popular song from 2Pac, probably the best song on this album.    3. Toss It Up - 9.5/10 Another popular classic.  This song features KC and JoJo.    4. To Live & Die In L.A. - 9/10 Once again another classic.  This classic is probably the one I like the least though.    5. Blasphemy - 9/10 Now we take a little break from the classics.  This is a very good song.  It is scary in the begining, but when 2Pac starts rappin WHOA!!!!    6. Life Of An Outlaw - 10/10 I love this song.  It is such a good one.  It's not one of those well known classics, but it is a damn good song.    7. Just Like Daddy - 8/10 It's pretty good.  I personally think it gets boring after a while, but it's not bad.    8. Krazy - 9/10 A very deep, mature Pac on this one.      9. White Man'z World - 9.5/10 Back to the classics.  One of the best songs on here.  As a matter of fact I'm listenin to this song as I'm typin this.    10. Me and My Girlfriend - 9.5/10 Classic.  Very good.  You probably heard the version Jay-Z re-did.    11. Hold Ya Head - 9/10 A very positive song.  Very good beat.    12. Against All Odds - 10/10 Classic.  What a way to end an album.  He went out on top on this album.    Dont take my word on the boring songs, listen to a preview of it and find out for yourself.  As a matter of fact do that for all the songs and see what you think.  After you preview all the songs ur probably gonna wanna buy this CD.
B0006399FS|2.0|I preface these comments with a heavy heart and the fact that I have been a long standing U2 fan.  I came to them late in 80's as popular music devolved in hip hop and dance based music.  While my resistance to U2 was largely based on being diametrically opposed to them politically, I had to admit that their politics stunk but their music was great. <br /> <br />I cannot say that about this album.  In general, it never hits its stride; there is no consistency in the album.  The songs are uneven and forgetable.  While Vertigo is a crowd pleasing rocker, which some might deride as a paean to the masses, after hearing the whole album several times over the past three weeks, I'd welcome a couple more Vertigos on this album.  The band allegedly redid the album after disliking the intial effort.  I shudder to imagine how bad the original version of the album was. <br /> <br />Bono's voice is very thin in this album, almost sing-talking through many of the songs.  There were times I winced at how badly his voice cracked and weezed over notes he would have hit a couple albums ago.  I think his diet of Guinness and unfiltered Marlboros has done irreparable damage to his voice. <br /> <br />The songwriting is trite and tiresome (A house doesn't make a home???) with very little emotion in most songs.  U2 seems to have lost the ability to create anthems.  Their strength was never vearing into trite love songs, rather, appealing to emotion through powerful themes.  This album has no theme other than the profit margin. <br /> <br />Song by song: <br /> <br />Vertigo: A mass appeal song, but, sadly, the strongest one of the lot.  Better than Elevation, but not even near the fun of Mysterious Ways. <br /> <br />Miracle Drug:  Overall, not bad, but that call is made in comparison to the other songs on the record, which is not the best company to keep.  Bono's voice is raspy and non-melodic in most of it. <br /> <br />Sometimes...: Lately, U2 must have a song whose title is verbose (i.e. Stuckin a Moment...)  This song apparently is to be an anthemesque song but, again, Bono's voice fails him.  It's the case of a a great refrain ruined by the song itself. <br /> <br />Love and Peace or Else: While heavy on the politics of peace (which rarely works) it is a song that is utterly pedestrian.  The song has been done by other bands.   <br /> <br />City of Blinding Lights: Another example of a song that has a decent refrain but Bono's voice is so thin, you wince at certain points.  It seems that Bono can still emote in refrain, but has lost the ability to carry the body of song with lyrical singing <br /> <br />All Because of You: I have never gotten through this song.  The body of the song is bland:  other bands have done songs that sound the same.  What is worse is that the refrain is painfully annoying and whiny: It's like nails on a chalkboard. <br /> <br />Man and a Woman: A good song, great bass line.  It was a relief to find this song.  If you think about tracks 4-6, the heart of the order of this album is so weak.  When you'd be be getting 'Until the End of the World', 'Wild Horses' and 'So Cruel, we get the above songs... poor comparison. <br /> <br />Crumbs from your Table:  The first song that touched me as a very good song.  It's the anthem you expect from U2, but too little too late. <br /> <br />One Step Closer:  Not a bad song if it were on a stronger record.  In this case, an average song on an average album, makes it even weaker. <br /> <br />Original of the Species: Another okay song, but, again Bono's voice is just not there any more.  The refrain is decent, but the rasping and hissing and missed notes ruin it. <br /> <br />Yahweh:  Overall, the third strongest track, but it's religious overtones will make it a song that is reviled by most and unreleasable.  However, it seems to be the one Bono has the most passion. <br /> <br />Looking at this album, its not what you'd expect from this band and 4 years of waiting.  There is no great song on this record, no 'One', no 'In the Name of Love', no 'Walk On' no 'With or Without You.'  If this record had been released a year or two after a major, ground breaking release (Rattle and Hum after Joshua Tree or Zooropa after Achtung Baby) I could have forgiven the quality, but this was 4 years in the making. <br /> <br />In fact, if you look at the previous CD singles, U2 used to give you almost a mini-album of b-sides, but now they release two versions of Vertigo and give you one new track each.    The album is just an excuse to tour and make a ton of money.  Some have called this record a comeback album.  That is wrong.  But the next one will be.
6304806426|4.0|WWII, Tuscany.  A National Geographic explorer (Fiennes) falls in love with the wife of a colleague (Scott-Thomas), which eventually consumes both of them in flames of illicit passion.  Charred beyond recognition, with but the slightest morsel of memories, he comes under the care of Canadian war nurse (Binoche) in a ruined villa.  Meanwhile, a thumbless thief (Defoe) subjected to the cruel physical interrogations and a Sikh mine strappler (Andrews) cross paths with the duo.   <br /> <br />Minghella's war-time romance swept 9 Oscars at Academy nite, including Best Picture; but it's no wonder, it's the kind of broad-canvased film the Academy loves.  It's hard to resist at first too, so crisp and rich are the color tones of John Seale's photography.  To be truthful, at 162 minutes it's a trite too long, and there're times I feel a hardier core would suit better than endless shots of sweeping Sahara chasms; the screenplay tends to be more inert and though the motivations of the characters are clearly stated, it's hard to feel psychologically involved or moved by any of them.  Ironically the elegiac end may be the best part of the movie, but Seale's cinematography and Yared's mesmeric score ensure some of these time go by not without a linger.  Putting the strengths of the book and the adaptation together, I would opt for Ondantje's Booker-winning novel, but this 1996 film is well worth a look, if as a lush example of modern-day movie-making.

0060007737|3.0|not bad- but not great... they have more pictures than other books and the layout is attractive, but they oversimplify a few contentious areas.  Everyone understands there are no laws in love or marketing... so what's with the 22 (oh marketing)!
B0001LJC2K|5.0|I'm getting immensely tired of people saying Muse sounds like Radiohead. OK, the first Muse album 'Showbiz' might have sounded a bit like Radiohead, but ever since then Muse have taken a very, very different path with their music. I find it incredibly stupid that people are STILL comparing them to Radiohead. When Showbiz first came out in 1999, critics thought they sounded like Radiohead... and with good reason. But on Absolution and OOS, their sound is NOTHING ALIKE! Yes, Matt's voice sounds like Thom Yorke's. But it's stupid that since they sound (somewhat) alike, people automatically think their music is ALSO alike.     And in my opinion, Matt Bellamy sounds NOTHING like Thom Yorke. Yes, they both use falsetto, and have British accents, WOW. But other than that, I find their tones to be very different. Also, Muse's producer is the same guy who produced `OK Computer' and `The Bends'. OF COURSE THEY'RE GOING TO COME ACROSS SOUNDING ALIKE IF THEY HAVE THE SAME PRODUCER. Wait, I take that back because THEY DON'T SOUND ALIKE. But for all those numskulls who think they're basically copying Radiohead, this might have something to do with why you're so foolish. THEY HAVE THE SAME PRODUCER. So there.     Radiohead sucks now anyways. They've 'dropped the rock' so to speak, and are now just more experimental and crappy. Muse is way better in MY opinion. People need to SHUT UP and stop saying they sound alike. People have said this so much to the band members of Muse, that now they get pissed whenever it's mentioned. Dear lord, people can be so stupid.     Just listen to Plug in Baby or Bliss or Newborn or Citizen Erased or any number of other songs on OOS or Absolution and you will see that they SOUND NOTHING ALIKE.
0671027344|5.0|I hate to sound cliche but this novel struck a cord-- I felt truly connected to the novel in an unbelievable way -- I read transfixed for 4 hours and I am the type that uses cliffnotes for every novel.. but this novel dragged me in to the plot and nailed being a teenager beautifully.. the struggle the striff and those moments that are truly perfect, or as chbosky so elegantly puts it infinite.  I felt charlies striff as if it was my own because well frankly put it is my own -the long faces of stranges, the crazy nature of society, and unforgettable nights with the ones you truly care for.  Some see this novel as a coming of age trite tale, but it truly isnt.. its remarkable how charlie does grow and develop through the story but the story doesnt neatly tie or end because well life doesnt end or tie up neatly it continues and with new problems new fears new desires and always with hope for that one fleeting second with the one you truly love and care about
0385493800|5.0|The Testament, in my mind, is by far the best book that John Grisham has written. Vivid mental pictures of adventures to other places and people groups. Great for traveling or just sitting at home. Great read.
B0002KVUL6|3.0|I liked the movie.  Saw it in the theater and rented it later.  It was very exciting.  Fast moving.  Almost too fast.  The characters weren't developed enough. The film didn't give enough background on the characters for the viewer to give a rat's behind about what happened to them.  Hugh Jackman?  Always happy to sit and drool.  Give me more Wolverine (X-Men Movies).  Kate Beckensale?  I'm sure in the right film she's lovely.  Here, I could see any number of B film queens from the 70's in the role.  Couldn't wait for her to get it in the end...and we knew she would, even though after the extreme beatings she took, we saw nary a bruise on her.  Speaking of the end...could it have been any more ridiculously sappy?  Please.  Still, the film was, overall, entertaining and exciting.  Happy viewing!
B00005U2LM|5.0|This album has some great songs and some songs that could just be ignored.

0156027321|3.0|I can not agree with the critics who shower praise on the life of Pi.  The first 30 pages are not very engaging and mediocrity describes the first 89 pages.  The middle to end is worth the push though, as the prose becomes more driving and purposeful. While some people claim that this book will make you believe in God - I find this a strange assertion... it had no effect on my belief system and I found its anectodal ending amusing but not as deeply philosophical as I was lead to believe through other reviews.  There is no doubt the Yann Martel is a talented writer, but it seems he tries too hard in the beginning- like a graduate student writing his/her first novel.  Nonetheless his description of the tiger towards the end shows the incredible promise of this young author.
B0006B29Z2|5.0|THe first disc contains the shows from Live at the rainbow, Hammesmith (beast on the road) and dormund (piece of mind). The only problem is that none of these are complete shows.  Real maiden fans know that the actual show contained many more songs that are not included.  But nevertheless, I cannot complain. This is great.  The second disc contains a live home video at the ruskin arms in 1980.  It's like watching your frieds band live at a local bar.  This shows thier humble beginnings.  THere is an extensive interview with all the past maiden members(man they aged hard)narrated by harris.  Harris is the only one that still looks young and the rest of the current members of  <br />coarse.  There is Black and white footage of a T.V. show that outlines the rise of NWOBHM which is great.  The only thing I feel is that this DVD is not enough to show case the whole era from Iron Maiden to Piece of mind.  Let's face it beast and Piece of mind could be made into DVDs of their own!!  They are going to be releasing 3 or 4 more DVDs that show case the rest of their career.  This ofcoarse will be the best.  I'm waiting for the next one which covers Live after death and Somewhere in time.  After that it's all downhill.  Who cares about Blaze anyway.  This DVD is absolutely fabulous and the price is mindboggling (unlike the JP box set).  If you don't buy this then you cannot call yourself a metal head period. (you might want to check your undies for blood if you don't buy this)
0805047905|5.0|I've read this book to a class of 1-2 year olds and then to a class of 4-6 year olds. Every single child LOVED this book. My Pre-K students wanted to read it day after day. They even ask to play teacher and read it to each other. It never gets old to them. I personally don't find the pictures extremely fascinating, but something about them and the simple rhyming text captures the attention of every child hearing/looking at it. I HIGHLY recommend this book for young children. It's great to see children's faces light up simply when they see the book. I've never met a person (young or old) who didn't enjoy it.
B00000DQSZ|5.0|It works.  It's an entry point for many of us Anglophiles into the more beat-driven pop music of late.  Once you lose that inhibition about liking some type of music simply because it gets you to nod your damn head, it's hard to return.
0060977493|1.0|If I didn't have to read this book for my English class, I would have given up after the first few pages. The writing is extremely showy. The author capitalizes words with Little Significance in the middle of sentences. This technique would be acceptable if it was only a few words but she sticks them all over the place for decoration. She also put excessive and many times pointless imagery all over the place distracting the reader from the content. I don't think that it would be exaggerating to say that half the book is imagery. A few times the imagery is beautiful but many times it is downright disgusting or pointless. For example, immediately following a descriptive urinating scene she has to say that the pee was like, \\"a yellow brook burble through a mountain pass.\\" This made me imagine pee gushing down a mountain pass. Not exactly beautiful. An exceptionally disgusting part was when she had to write a little poem about the process of Estha (the boy twin) getting molested. Her attempt to show-off by writing a poem describing the process of molestation is distasteful at least.      Another problem is her constant repeating of \\"important quotes.\\" I heard the same thing so many times that I wondered if the author thought I was too stupid to get it the first time. This technique is good if used only a few times but once again; it was too excessive and caused the quote to become a clich.      In addition, she also has a tendency to stickmanywordstogetherinanannoyingway. This made the book hard to get through. This book sounds like a first draft.      Besides technical issues, the characters in the book with the exception of Baby Kochamma and Chacko, are poorly developed. The twins who are suppose to be the main characters seem like empty buckets with no personality. It's kind of hard to be sympathetic to their misery when they barely show any emotion or admirable traits. One also wonders about the morality in this book since she condones incest between twins. The book also appears sexist in the repeating quote of \\"Mans Needs\\" and the portrayal of most men as wife-beaters or women oppressors. The only men in the book that were good guys were Estha and Velutha. However, both of these men are powerless and weak. This author basically whines and complains about all the horrible things that can possibly happen in society without offering any solutions. There is no silver lining.  She seems more concerned with showing off her poor literature skills than the plot or the characters. Highly not recommended.
0743455967|5.0|As an aspiring writer, I jumped for joy when I learned that my favorite author, Stephen King, wrote a book on the subject of writing. Immediately, I hurried out to get my copy. Like with most of King's work, I was pleased with the end result. <br /> <br />This book's greatest strength is its language, which is one of the reasons why King wrote the book in the first place. His prose is so down to earth, so human, that reading it never gets old. I have a paperback copy on my bookshelf and the audio version on my iPod, yet I still get a kick every time he uses a humorous decorative phrase. I'm sure that most fans of Stephen King's work will not get tired of this book, especially the ones who feel like grabbing a pen and staring their own stories.
0805076476|5.0|I have to say that this was one amazing book. Chuck Palahniuk had out done himself when he sat down and wrote this novel. It was brave and bold, audacious beyond words and filled with so much truth. <br /> <br />The structure of the writing took a bit of getting used to. But that makes sense, it was told from a point of view of an insomniac and insomniacs are strewn in many different directions. <br /> <br />But I think that this book really does capture the psyche of the disenfranchised and the disenchanted. Which I think is most of the youth in society today.  <br /> <br /> <br />Overall, an impressive read fully deserving five stars.
0064407667|1.0|I borrowed this book on tape from our library to learn more about this series before allowing our children to read them.  I was very dismayed at the extremely dark tone of the book.  I feel much of the subject matter is too depraved (a word which here means morally corrupt; perverted *) for readers in elementary or middle school levels (or anyone older for that matter).  For example, there's mental & physical abuse, planning / attempted murder (of baby Sunny, the children mentioning poisoning Count Olaff, and repeated reminders of Count Olaff's plan to \\"get rid of\\" the children), sexual themes with minors (marrying a minor and making references to the wedding night in a devious manor) and a theme that suggests that children cannot rely on and are not respected by adults- all of this because of money.  DOES THIS SOUND LIKE GOOD READING MATERIAL FOR CHILDREN???  This series brings into sharp focus that parents are ultimately responsible for their children's mental well being and I believe these books are very harmful to that delicate balance.  There are many books to fill our children's minds with tools to resolve conflict in a realistic and healthy way (the Narnia series is my favorite).  The Unfortunate Events books are, as stated in the Product Description by the author, \\"extremely unpleasant\\" and I STRONGLY suggest parents familiarize themselves with these books before allowing their children to read them.  Call me old fashioned, but I really like a \\"good triumphs over evil\\" ending-  and why not?  There are enough real horrors in the world already and I prefer to be uplifted by a book, not feel depressed from a so called \\"children's book\\".  I will state it again:  PARENTS-  BE AWARE OF WHAT YOUR CHILDREN ARE READING!!!!! <br /> <br />* definition of depraved courtesy of The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition as found on Dictionary.com
B0006213WG|4.0|I have never been a sum 41 fan.  I would like a song here and there, in particular, \\"Still Waiting.\\"  I heard \\"We're all to Blame\\" in the record store where I work and thought, \\"Man, this rocks.\\" I checked out the rest of the cd and it did not let me down.  Another one of my favorites is \\"Bitter End.\\"  It took me back to the days when Metal was good. Some say that a lot of it sounds like Metallica.  Well, since Metallica is the best band in music history, I would say that to be a compliment.  Besides, don't we all have influences.  Early Metallica sounds a great deal like Diamond Head, but no body accuses them of ripping off their songs. Also, as a die-hard Metallica fan, I took the song \\"Bitter End\\" to be a tribute to all the great metal Metallica has provided us over the years.  The song features replicated riffs of St. Anger, Batter, Blackened, THrough the Never, and even some Master of Puppets. Bottom line is, this cd is a great rock album from start to finish.  The melodic harmonies and crunching power riffs accompanied by the forceful vocals speak conviction and tell me that these guys really have something to say.  Check it out!
B0000AC8LZ|5.0|This movie was recommended to me by a co-worker 20 years my junior.  When he told me that I would be laughing so hard that I'd be holding my sides I didn't quite believe him.  He let me watch his copy, and we were hooked. You actually need tissues for the tears of laughter. We got our own copy and keep watching it over and over again.  This is one of those movies that a group can recite together, just telling the punch lines and cracking up laughing while onlookers question what they're talking about.   <br />You'll never look at \\"flair\\" the same way again!!!
B000001DTM|4.0|Some great tracks, but Overated!!!! <br /> <br />I mean there are some terrible songs on this album!!! <br /> <br />\\"Trying To Throw Your Arms Around The World\\"? <br />with that painfully awful chorus  <br />\\"I'm gonna run to you run to you?\\" <br /> <br />Of course their are some of U2s best songs (if not the best songs of all time) on this record. <br /> <br />But it is NOT there best!!!
0061015725|2.0|This is another case of \\"good idea gone bad,\\" and it disappoints me to see this particular one performed by Crichton himself. A genius tale about microrobots evolving to the point of mimicking humanity is hindered by an unnecessarily long introduction telling the story of a stay-at-home husband who thinks his wife is cheating on him. While this does gives some hints towards the rest of the novel, it's not enough to make up for all the scenes of grocery shopping and diaper changing and the like; after all, most foreshadowing and hints are fulfulled in the last couple pages of the entire 300+ page book. <br /> <br />There are quite a few scary scenes towards the end, and I would love to see this made into a movie (as I'm sure it will), but when it all boils down, \\"Prey\\" says too much and achieves too little.
B00003CXAY|5.0|Both movies are a perfect symbiosis between sound and image, music and movie. When I first saw Koyaanisqatsi on television I was amazed, surprised. I had never seen anything like this before. The beautiful pictures and the intriguing music absorbed me. The contrasts are many and make the film interesting till the last scene. This movie I can watch over and over again and the music is a master piece on its own. However as said before the movie goes together with the music and makes it a true work of art.
B0002YHFZC|5.0|Out of about 30 music related DVD's I own this is in the top three! If your a guitar player like myself you'll be in heaven , just pure raw tube amp tone and emotional high energy playing. And being able to sing and play like that at the same time is quite impressive.Jack plays like a man possesed and Meg puts the hurt on the drums.<br /><br />Lots of good up close shots on the guitar so you get to see Jacks style/technique up close. Pretty nice.<br /><br />If you were a skeptic before you'll be a believer after seeing this video.
B000053VAZ|5.0|using the quriky proclaimers hit, benny and joon is an acomplishment that pulls johnny depp into one of the cutest, most huggably, and yet eerily believable roles he's played. not just for johnny fans, this movie is truly a \\"romance with a twist\\" pulling together the impressive talents of multiple noted actors and actresses. this is the ultimate johnny depp movie, but for those who dont buy into the johnny rage, it provides a sweet evening of family entertainment while dealing with the touchy issues of social relationships, family problems, and mental instability in an origanal, touching, and comforting way that you will never forget. <br /> <br />with the  quirky chaplin-esque stunts that depp pulls off in style, and the truly believable copncerned brother role of aiden quin, put together with the semi-insane character of Masterson, this movie has the talent to pull of what it tries to do- in style. <br /> <br />a must see for all ages.
B0006399FS|4.0|When I initially listened to this the first time I was not enourmously impressed and somewhat dissapointed. <br />I still am a bit considering what U2 said about the album <br /> <br />To start of with.......when U2 first talked about this album before it was released, they said it was going to be the \\"real rock u2\\" and it would be the old rock n roll U2 updated. <br /> <br />They also said that this was the best record that they had ever made with some great guitar playing, well at least Bono did anyway. <br /> <br />Well its probably the best U2 record to listen to from the start to end.....maybe, but it definitley does not have the \\"outstanding songs\\" I was expecting. <br /> <br />However its not all that bad. Although a bit more thought and emotion and soul could of gone into the music and lyrics particularly, as many of the lines of the songs are absolute waffle. <br /> <br />Also it would of been nice to hear some songs that did'nt all have the same sort of scape and tone as the all the tracks on the enire album show. <br /> <br />\\"One\\" \\"Staring At The Sun\\" \\"With or Without You\\" \\"Stay Farwaway So close\\"???????????? <br /> <br />Or some straight forward acoustic tunes would of been nice, just to break it up a bit. <br /> <br />Overall its not actually that bad, pretty satisfying, but some bits of songs and actual songs are annoying........ <br /> <br />particularly \\"A man and a woman\\" and \\"One Step Closer\\", which has a very stupid chorus and a repeats it self over and over. <br /> <br />As for the album name, well its a bit silly? <br />\\"How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb\\"? they did'nt even  <br />include %#%^^$% instructions!! <br />I wanted to hear a great album, not dismantle a $#@%^^ bomb!!! <br /> <br />Vertigo would of fitted a alot better. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00004SVID|5.0|Whenever I go to a concert I love how loud they play the music. I love the way you can feel the drum beat in your chest. And that really is the downside to live albums. Up until this one, I've never gotten that feeling that I was really at a concert. Sure the crowds screamed and the solos were great, but on this, wow. Somehow they engineered it to capture that loud, bass-y, and most importantly, loud sound. Anyone who says this isn't different enough from the studio albums hasn't listened to the two albums back to back. I tried it, and the opening to the studio \\"In the Flesh\\" (the first one) sounded quiet compared to this one. And yes, while many songs do not deviate immensely from the studio version (there are some fine extended guitar solos though), in this reviewers' opinion, the concert feel alone is worth it. And since you read reviews to determine if you should buy it or not, let a loud, clear \\"YES\\" resonate in your ears.

B00009QG73|5.0|Was fortunate enough to see this Roxy Tour in both Tokyo and New York; they were simply amazing, all the more so for the energy - in addition to the expected cool vibe and talent. The cast of musicians and entertainers ran a clinic for all their imitators. I finally got around to playing the DVD I bought eons ago; and got to experience it all over again; the quality of the production is outstanding. Let's hope we see at least one more Roxy CD with new material and one or more grand tours. The Rock and Roll hall of fame should be considered a fraud until Roxy is inducted.
B0002ZDVEU|1.0|If you liked the first movie don't bother with this tripe.  It's entirely a different film. <br /> <br />The scriptwriter wanted something \\"serious\\"--in other words, mean-spirited and a downer.  The director helped out with a jiggly camera, poor lighting and other artsy-fartsy film noire effects.  A total departure from the first film and utterly wrong-headed.  (I suspect the usual Hollywood-coke-snorting pony-tailed in-crowd got their hooks into this project.) <br /> <br />In short, boring trash that also manages to ruin the residual good feelings from the first movie. <br /> <br />
B00042YL4A|5.0|Before I even knew what a \\"trevor horn\\" was, i was in awe of this album and Frankie's \\"Pleasuredome\\" within the same year.  \\"Lexicon\\" set the standard for my pop/rock ears.  It was truly the very first album i would obsessively listen to over and over without skipping a single track and all the while wondering \\"Why aren't all albums made this way??\\".  Later, I would discover \\"Avalon\\" by Roxy Music (which actually came first, but not to my ears).  ABC's original killer lineup (Fry, White, Singleton, Lickley, and, most of all, Palmer) had hammered out (with Horn) the ulitmate distillation of what HAD been great 70*s music to form the pinnacle of New Romanticism for the 80*s.   <br /> <br />The songs are an endless stream of witty couplets, like Satan himself had possesed your average dictionary of qoutations and was using it to sing the evils of love!  The lowbrow take on highbrow lyricism all the while laughs at it's own haughty pretension, and Fry's ever-straining (though succeeding!) vocal delivery is emotive and leavening all at once!  Tessa Niles (then Webb) made her mark as the angel of the New Romantic bands with her cameo parts here.   Duran Duran would allude to her spots on Lexicon with their \\"Come Undone\\" single (that record seeming to mourn a bygone era). <br /> <br />  Trevor Horn (I know what one is now!) assembled the core army that would march forth as ZTT (and the before-mentioned Frankie) around this effort, and the collective genius of all concerned, coupled with an exacting attention to recorded sonics (predicting the digital era to come...) would rise to heights unimagined.  This record is every bit as engaging and lofty as any classical symphony or suite.  Horn even managed to \\"tart up' and incorporate a track produced by someone else (Steve Brown on \\"Tears Are Not Enough\\") seemlessly.  Fortunately for listeners, the original 7 inch single version is here for comparison.  Also of note is the FABULOUS jazz mix of \\"Poison Arrow\\" (which i long treasured on vinyl) that proves Trevor's chops as an ombudsman arranger and mixer!  Some of you may like to know that a \\"scratch\\" mix of 'Look of Love\\" is out there (part 5), it has it's moments, really, but I can see why it missed the cut here... <br /> <br />ABC's graphic sensibility PRE dated Pet Shop Boys and was in no small measure responsible for their success first time out.  The Deluxe version exquistitely re-tailors the original graphics (Universal/Polygram in-house art has long been a leader in tasteful treatments, even when assigning such work to outside firms).  Lots of Goodies for the eyeballs here, as well.  The Live and Demo cuts are great, academically speaking.  I only wish disc one had incorporated \\"overture\\" and \\"look parts 2 and 3\\" and left all else to disc two, it would have been less jarring.  The sound has a certain \\"punched and compressed\\" quality in the percussion parts that was (like vintage Motown singles) a big part of it's vinyl success.  It has obviously been decided to not mess with perfection in the audio approach, and the oddness of this approach is preserved (wise choice in my book!). <br /> <br />I sincerely hope this album is one day given the 5.1 surround mix it so desperately deserves. It would definitely pose a challenge to Mr. Horn, and he may well feel it is too risky to mess with perfection.  This album deserves that extra detail every bit as much as Roxy's \\"Avalon\\" did, and \\"Avalon\\" succeeded as such, so please Trevor, give a try for the old guard!  THANK GOD THIS ALBUM HAS GOTTEN IT'S DUE HONOR AT LAST!  You will proudly own the very best if you buy it, even the original vanity \\"Neutron\\" label is used!  Purveyors of Supa-Fine Product, indeed!
B000667GFK|5.0|Luis Miguel is one of the few singers I have followed with devotion. Since his days as a beginer till now. What I like most of him is that he has always done whatever he wanted. He had sung in English, he had sung rancheras, tango,bolero anything. And always his records have been recorded with great elegance. Great orchestras, good selection of songs. <br /> <br />This last one is a great one,. The songs are excellent. But I think this cd is only good for those who really like Luis Miguel, I am one of those so I am giving it five stars. But if you have never listened this kind of music it is an enjoyable cd. His version of Sabes una cosa is really wonderful and after listening it you will be humming it all day.
B00006BTCA|4.0|I got this as a reccomendation from some friends of mine and I've been pretty much, well, blown away by it. It's not over the top awsome, but it's definately worth adding to your collection. The dark melodies are inventive and despite the fact that people compart them to The Cure and like bands, Interpol has a unique sound that can make it easy to get used to and appreciate.<br /><br />While this album isn't for everybody, those who would dig it will probably get wind of it eventually. This band definately has the possibility to be much bigger and this CD is a great start.
0393317552|4.0|I picked up this book as a starter to understand the rise and fall of the North American native tribes.  It turned out to be a lot more.  I enjoyed reading Diamond's theory, and for the most part, he has been very convincing.  There are points on which he relied heavily on circumstancial evidence (e.g., the almond tree), I think the possibility is certainly there, and with 80000 years to boot, occurance is quite likely.    Although this book covers mainly geographical factors on the rise of civilisations, Diamond did later develop a second theory  called \\"optimal fragmentation theory.\\"  This theory accounts for  contributions from human and sociological factors, which most reviewers find lacking in Guns, Germs, and Steel.    In Diamond's defense, however, the subject of optimal fragmentation was briefly touched towards the end of the book, in the context of Chinese and European technological advances.  Perhaps, at the time of writing, said theory was still being developed.    This is one of the best written books I have read, and for a subject this vast and still relatively new, Diamond has done an excellent job in presenting it so that we, the laymen, can understand quickly and easily.    I did find, that Diamond tried too hard to be politically correct.  In my opinion, he could have condensed the last couple of chapters into two words -- ethnic clensing -- when he wrote about the near ethnic homogenity of China and Africa.  Despite this, I think this book deserves the Pulitzer Prize.
0525948023|5.0|I found that this book contained the same magic/presence that the Power of Now does but added to that a personal direction for every human on the planet. I loved the simple yet profound wording. It definetly \\"brought\\" more presence and peace to my life. Do not be afraid to throw yourself into this book, it is a warm embrace on a cold winter's night.
B00006AW2P|5.0|This is the first Stones album out and the first one I got when it came out.  It was awesome, and the best things about the Stones was how incredibly TIGHT they were, and there were always so many great things going on at once in each song that, in the words of me and my best friend at the time, \\"you don't know what to listen to first.\\"  They were the greatest blues band at the beginning, with Brian Jones, and this is a great intro to their blues-rock sound, way different than they later became.  I also would love to see the current Stones play \\"small\\" clubs and theaters and just play the early Stones songs!  Just the music without a lot of theatrics.
B0002IQMKM|5.0|well, before getting this cd, i had only heard talking heads at a club where a talking heads cover band played. they were pretty good, and i remembered hearing \\"once in a lifetime\\" sometime before. so not knowing much about them, i picked up this cd. now i want more talking heads. not only did i find that \\"once in a lifetime\\" was great, but \\"this must be the place (naive melody)\\" is such a beautiful song to me for some reason. hah. well, me being only the casual fan, liked this cd, but it also made me want to get more talking heads stuff, so yeah i like this cd a lot
B00003CX5P|1.0|I grew up on Star Wars and as bad as the new movies are, I will end up seeing them anyway. <br /> <br />Most of the acting (...especially the kid), dialogue (...the Hutts, there ganstas) and CGI creatures suck (...Jar Jar Binks. They appear very cartoonish and annoying. There is no chemistry between the characters like Hamill, Ford & Fisher in Episode IV, V & VII.  <br /> <br />The big battle scene sort of reminds you of ROTJ where a group of retarded creatures (cough..cough..ewoks) can destroy a powerful army with sticks and crap without one of them getting killed. <br /> <br />Every scene with the kid sucks, from the pod race to him destroying the droid army by pushing a couple of buttons.  His acting is about as good as the Olsen twins on Full House. <br /> <br />I also didn't think it was necessary to tie in R2-D2 & C3PO as neatly as the did.  <br /> <br />The only cool part is the Darth Maul/Qui-Gon/Obi Wan lightsaber duel. The problem is you have to get through an hour and a half of crap to get to it.   <br /> <br />This movie is easily on par with the Star Wars Holiday Special. The crappy Star Tours ride at Disney was better than this piece of garbage. I would say that even Willow was better. <br /> <br />Let me recap... <br /> <br />The pod race sucks... <br />The announcers at the pod race really suck... <br />The kid's acting sucks... <br />Natalie Portman's acting sucks... <br />The dialogue sucks... <br />Jar Jar Binks really really sucks... <br /> <br />Nuff said <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000089RVX|5.0|That's right, if liking Evanescence makes me a sell-out, then so be it.  The reason I say this is because I am a dei-hard Metal-freak. I don't mean like nu-metal{such as Korn,Coal Chamber, Rammstein,etc}, I mean true blood red metal; namely Black metal{Ie: Dimmu Borgir, Dissection,Immortal,Marduk,Naglfar,etc} and Death Metal{ie: Cannibal Corpse, Deicide, Vital Remains, Morbid Angel,etc.} Thrash Metal{ie:Megadeth,Testament,Overkill,Forbidden,etc.} as well as stuff like Ozzy,Alice, Iron Maiden,etc.  So other true fans of true metal will probbaly hate me for this; But I freaking love Evanescence!!!  It's funny, when they first came out w/\\"Fallen\\", I'd seen the vido for \\"bring me to life\\" on Muchmusic canada, and it was always on mute as I sat there listening to my brutal metal music and just watched the cool visuals of that video. I figured people were just making a dumb-as s hype about the band. Eventually I decided to actually listen to the video while I watched it, I fell in love w/it's epic quality, which is something the whole album has, even though the songs are short{not epic in length} they are epic in quality, and the album as a whole is.  It's impoosible to pick a fave track. The whole album just cuts right to my soul and touches me in ways no other album in history has. And Amys haunting and etherial vocals are just absolutely breathtaking! Not to mention that she has this gothic beauty to her that is irresistable, and I love the fact that she refuses to be sexualized, that's one strong woman. She and he voice are like a sirensong, just pulls you in no matter how you try to resist.  And the music, it is well-crafted. I find it interesting though that Rocky Gray, the drummer was the fomer guitar player for Christian metal bands \\"Living Sacrifice\\" and \\"Soul Embraced\\"; I'm shocked that he was willing to break away from that fundy mentality and play w/a secular band, allthough the song \\"Tourniquet\\" was written by him, to my knowledge for \\"Soul Embraced\\" originally, which would explain it's subtle christian message{unfortunately; in the sense that this has caused the band alot of crap w/the religious right and the rest of the world, having been labelled a christian band by some for awhile; but then I suppose the decision to play christian festivals did'nt help either; or maybe it did, I don't know. It's also unfortunate that such a great album contains pro-christian/pro-faith content; however I gotta say that song really helped me express my anger at the biblegod while I deconverted from the christian faith, it helped me work through some emotyions, so perhaps-it is good after all}.  I also love the choir thing at the end, singing in what is it-latin?   Bens guitar work is good too, I have'nt yet heard his replacment since he left the band, I assume he is also good.  All I can say it that this album is EPIC,TOUCHING, and after all my years as a die hard fan of the most brutal heavy metal out there, on my list of top five to ten albums of all time period, \\"Fallen\\" makes it on to the list. If you don't yet have it-GET IT!!!    \\"It's not WHAT you believe, it's HOW you believe it\\"-United Universists;
B00006879E|5.0|I loved the entire album. This is one album that i can listen to without skipping songs. No song on this album sounds the same.  <br /> <br />1. Harder to Breathe- 10/10 <br />2.

068987474X|5.0|A friend turned me onto this book after having broken off an engagement with a man she was with for 5 years. After being engaged  (but never married) twice myself, and having wasted 5 years of my life on the wrong person twice, I thought I would check it out. Ladies, even if you think you know it all, this book will put things into perspective like you wouldn't believe. If you are, like me, successful in everything you do (except relationships), this will help. This is the only area of life where women consistently accept less than what they deserve, and the authors will tell you what you do deserve, in a way that will empower you and boost your self esteem so that you will never again stick around because of all the \\"what if's\\" you've let yourself dream up.
B000002BYD|5.0|If you have'nt heard this album, get it its absolutley breath taking. <br /> <br />Yield starts of so well with \\"Brain of J\\" which just smacks and knocks you over and then you get \\"Faithfull\\" and \\"No Way\\" two really great songs, \\"No Way\\" featuring the most coolest guitar riff and the quirkiest and most interesting interlude. <br /> <br />The rest of the album is very varied musically, which is what keeps you interested and keeps your attention. <br /> <br />While its not an album that you can listen to from start to finish and hear an outstanding song on every single track (although most of them are) it is without a doubt one of Pearl Jams best and is much more pleasurable to listen to than any of their other albums. <br /> <br />
0393035158|5.0|I picked up Sam Harris's book recently, I found out about it through the website to the Universist movment { [...]  and sister site  ww.faithless.org }. <br />I've read about half to three-quarters of it, and I have to say that I believe Sam is right on. For 1000's of years ONE WAY/revealed faith ahs been pitted against ONE WAY/revealed faith, my god is bigger than your god, my book truer than your book,,etc. All this has done is breed ignorance,irrational fear and guilt, arrogance, intolerance, PREjudice,strife,division, oppresion, war and death. W/the rise of Islamic fundamentlaist extremisms and the terrorism it is prodicing, and the rise of Fundamentalist Christianity back into power in the western world of U.S.{which was founded mainly by founding fathers whom were Deists,agnostics, and maybe a few liberal christians; and on roman law and naturalistic democracy} through terrorist and hypcorite George W Bush and the religious right trying to take america back to the dangerous 14th century chritendom. We can no longer ignore thethreat that \\"faith\\" poases to our human unity and equality. I agree w/Sam 100% about liberals/moderates of these faiths; they are only helping to propagate \\"holy-books\\" full of cruel laws,commands from godfroms to commit genocide,infanticide,rape and sex abuse, and worse! They are only giving power to the fundys and picking and choosing according to their own wishes which parts of the books to literalize and to metaphorize according to to their own baises, why they don't just listen to their conciences fully and drop faith alltogether and quit propagating these dangerous myths is beyond me. I am 26 years old and was a christian fro 25 years, spent close to a decade immersed in the ignorant,irrationally fearful and guilty, PREjudiced, evangelical christian world. I am glad to have found the peace of mind that comes w/\\"reason\\" and faithlessness. I am now a Universist w/leanings towards Deism and Pantheism.  <br />This book of Sams is a wakeup call, we must heed this warning and yes, let them have their beleifs democratically, but lets challenge them, these faiths have the majority of the wealth,power,influence in this so-called democracy and globally, they are raping freedom,equality,rationalty,facts, Unity and hope. <br />We must wage non-violent, yet forceful- ideological war against them. <br />Thank you Sam for this book, you have carried on Thomas Paines spirit of the \\"age of reason\\". <br />I highly recommend this book to all rational and compassionate people whom are tired of the tyranny of faith. <br /> <br />peace
B0000AQS0F|5.0|If Fox network does not bring back Firefly they will be making a big mistake and I hope that one of the other networks will recognize that mistake and bring it back.  Joss Wheadon is absolutely amazing - Firefly was indeed stellar and anyone who picks up the DVD will not regret it... no matter who they are or what genre they usually prefer.  The only thing that will be a drawback is that there are no more seasons - Firefly with all the original characters should be brought back.
B00005QIPH|4.0|This album is pretty good but it receives a lot of negative reviews because of the exposure this band got on mtv.OK this is not a genius superbly produced masterpiece but it wasn't supposed to be. It's an old school lo-fi, stripped down, pop rock record.The songs are catchy and not too long and all in all it's a pretty good buy, I'm mean ok their not The Beatles but so what!!! Cut these guys some slack!!!
B0006399FS|3.0|U2 can do alot better than this, their are good songs on here \\"Vertigo\\" \\"Sometimes You can't make it on your own\\" \\"Miracle Drug\\" \\"All Because of You\\" \\"Yahweh\\" but the rest.....er I don't know if you could count the rest as being classic outstanding U2 songs. <br /> <br />Their are even a few that are irritating like \\"Man and a Woman\\" which is just a really stupid stupid song and \\"City of Blinding lights\\" which sounds alright at the start  but has a desiribley  <br /> <br />forgettable chorus \\"Oh you look so beautiful tonight.....In the city of blinding lights\\" now I don't know about you but to me that just sounds stupid and not much of a chorus. <br /> <br />As for the album as a whole, its pretty good but far from outstanding, they could of done alot better. <br /> <br />\\"POP\\" is their best album - musically its very impressive and just brilliant (particularly the guitars) its a completley new sound of U2 and it sounds great right from the start to the end.
B00005JMCW|4.0|\\"Freaky Friday\\" completely revived the ol' \\"switcheroo\\" genre, only it does it better and is completely more believable. And not only is it more believable, it's actually funny. Not only is it funny, it's just downright funnier than 90% of the garbage out there that passes for a comedy. <br /> <br />The plot snypnosis is quite easy. Tess (Jamie Lee Curtis) is the mother, who is a psychiatrist at work, continuously bugged by her phone and pagers going off every minute, readying for a big wedding, and having it rough trying to communicate with her daughter Anna (Lindsay Lohan). Anna on the other hand has her share of problems, with a teacher that's failing her for no reason, a friend-turned-bully tormenting her, her obnoxious lil' bro bugging her, not getting along with her mother's fiance, trying oh so desperately to gain attention of the cute guy she adores, and exclaiming her mother is \\"ruining her life\\" and a \\"fun-sucker\\" (\\"sucking the fun out of everything\\"). Not one understands what goes on in their lives, so they fight and argue constantly. Mother plays psychiatrist to her rebellious daughter to try and understand, but daughter says mom just doesn't understand. <br /> <br />At a resteraunt, they argue again, but then an elderly Chinese woman interferes with their conflict and decides to try and resolve the issue... by giving them fortune cookies. \\"Magic\\" fortune cookies, to explain better. Both eat them, and thus begins their most unusual experience of their lifetime. They wake up shocked to find their bodies switched. They try to resolve the issue by a \\"jolt\\" (running into each other). Unfortunately, they can't fix the problem and try to live out the day as trying to be each other. <br /> <br />The result is nothing short of hilarious. Jamie, pretending to be the rebellious teenage girl, completely steals the movie. It's just so funny to see her acting like a teenage girl. When the cute boy Anna likes comes up, Jamie says, \\"Oh my God...\\" like how a teenage girl would say. She pulls it off so well, you'll just laugh out loud (her saying \\"Eww!\\" is priceless). Lindsay is also hilarious as being serious and a little Miss Perfect. <br /> <br />Naturally they understand how each other's lives are. They manage to make solve each other's problems and pull off the day as being each other. Sure, it sounds cliched, but how else can it be done? \\"Freaky Friday\\" is by far one of the best comedies of recent times. The movie pulls off more laughs than a comedy that relies on gross-out or sexual humor. <br /> <br />Buy it, be entertained, and laugh out loud.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|An inspiring and quite(at times)spiritual concert, but, regardless of all the monumental pop-rock-world music figures who appear throughout this tribute, the most striking, intriguing and compelling person - or image - throughout the entire program is George Harrison's son, DHANI...quite the image of his beloved father, and even better, he seems sincerely captivated by his father's music deep within his soul. DHANI, you are your father's GIFT and legacy to the world beyond all his universal accomplishments.
B00008WT5E|5.0|POWERAGE-This album easily takes the cake as the best from the Bon era.Every single song off this record is awesome.My personal favorites are Down Payment Blues, Gimmie a Bullet, What's Next to the Moon, and Gone Shootin but they are all great. This isn't as polished as Highway to Hell but it makes up for the lack of fancy production with dirty raw powered riffs and blues based grooves. A must have
B000001EAQ|5.0|If you have'nt heard this album, well your missing out on a lot. <br /> <br />To start of with......its actually the only U2 album that really \\"rocks\\" if you know what I mean. <br /> <br />I was pleasantly surprised when I actually heard some of the songs off this album that I had'nt heard before like \\"If God Will Send His Angels\\" \\"Please\\" \\"Do You Feel Loved\\" and \\"Mofo\\" <br /> <br />I've read how alot of people have written its   <br />\\"U2 going techno\\".......mmmmmmm or maybe thats just what people and critics said at the time - in fact I doubt many people actually know what this album is really like, as its appallingly underappreciated and misunderstood if you ask me. <br />Probably just cause it was'nt a huge commercial success like \\"All that you can't leave behind\\" or the dissapointment <br />(on the whole as an album ) \\"How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb. <br /> <br />my opinion is that nothing on this album sounds remotley like techno at all, in fact it just simply is'nt techno at all. <br /> <br />The only thing you could call techno (even slightly) is Mofo and that is actually electronic rock. <br /> <br />The reason this is the \\"BEST\\" U2 album is because its <br /> <br />1. Not a commercial marketing scheme. <br />2. Its U2 reinventing themselves and pulling it off with fine style <br />3. Its the only U2 album that really \\"rocks\\" <br />4. It sounds great from start to finish <br />5. Musically it is varied and guitar wise it just pushes the limits of what you can do with a guitar \\"Big thumbs up to The Edge!\\" <br /> <br />Don't listen to the others who say its a failure because it does'nt sound like the original U2, they just don't know what to make of it. <br /> <br />U2s most impressive and addicting album. <br />
B0001RVTXO|5.0|One of the best bands of all time in my humble opinion. A collection of maybe the most catchy and exciting songs (dare I say hits?). This album makes me generally happy on the inside. Doesn't incest and UFOs make everyone happy?
B000002JS8|5.0|HIGHWAY TO HELL-Great album but definitely is surpassed by LET THERE BE ROCK and POWERAGE. But this album does contain one of the greatest AC/DC songs ever written(the title track) and a bunch of other classics like IF YOU WANT BLOOD,WALK ALL OVER YOU, GET IT HOT, TOUCH TOO MUCH, but also contains lesser known gems such as LOVE HUNGRY MAN,NIGHT PROWLER, and SHOT DOWN IN FLAMES.A must have for any AC/DC fan or rock and roll fan in general.
B00004T8RK|2.0|Binuaral Pearl Jams 5th album could of been a heak of alot better and is the first time that Pearl Jam has been a let down with one of their albums, and \\"Riot Act\\" that followed showed that is was'nt the first.    \\"breakerfall\\" \\"Gods Dice\\" \\"Light Years\\" \\"Nothing as it seems\\" \\"Insignificance\\" \\"of the girl\\" \\"thin air\\"  \\"parting ways\\" this is classic Pearl Jam material, to bad they don't seem to care anymore about putting out a decent sound onto a record.......    To start off with this album has some great songs on, infact every track is great the problem is Eddie Vedders singing is terrible and the sound quality is absolute [...]  I mean if you compare the sound and musical sound of this with their other 4 albums before this, they sound a heak of alot better than this! The songs just don't grab you.    Eddie Vedders singing just sounds lazy and slack, as if he can't be bothered anymore.    It really upsets me to see such an album as this, and an album with such potential to full short of Pearl Jams high standards and expectations.     This is the first Pearl Jam album that sounds bad in perfomance, the songs are very good, but unfortunatly those to things don't go together.
B0006284JQ|1.0|Wow, Britney Spears has released a Greatest Hits Album. I'm a huge Britney fan. I have all of her CD's...except this one. Why would I buy her GH CD when I can put together this CD at home? Sure the DVD is an incentive but that's the only reason why I may purchase this CD. The new tracks are available for download and would be cheaper if you just bought the tracks. This is the first time that I refused to rate a Britney album and I pray it will be the last.
B000002JS6|5.0|BACK IN BLACK-nuff said.This album represents true rock n roll in it's purest form. Songs like BACK IN BLACK, SHOOK ME ALL NIGHT LONG, HELL'S BELLS, WHAT DO YOU FOR MONEY, HONEY?, SHOOT TO THRILL and HAVE A DRINK ON ME  still sound fresh over 20 years after they were released. This album will forever be remembered and honored as the greatest rock record ever made. In other words buy the damn thing.
B000669GAI|4.0|I never actually thought Pearl Jam would ever release a \\"Greatest Hits 1991-2003\\" and actually call it a \\"Greatest Hits\\" usually with an album like that they would think of a much cooler and abstract name for it than \\"GHreatest Hits\\". <br /> <br />The reason being, that this is not Pearl Jams \\"Best Of\\" its actually a compilation of songs and singles from \\"SONYS\\" catalogue which is the record label they have left after 7 albums.  <br /> <br />I beleive its just a marketing scheme to make more more money for the label and an excuse to put out a best of now that they have left the \\"SONY\\" label. <br /> <br />If Pearl Jam had actually released a \\"Best of\\" without that title and been aloud to choose the track list I think it would of been alot more different and more surprising.  <br /> <br />To be honest I would of rather not see songs like \\"Jeremy\\" on this disc as I don't actually like it, or maybe cause its also just very overated and overplayed, I'm surprised people are'nt sick of it. <br /> <br />Anyway heres my take on it. Note that I'm only putting down a track list of material from \\"Ten\\" to the \\"Yield\\" album, because everything after that has lacked in performance and has lacked in the brilliant style of Pearl Jams performance. Not that its awful of course. <br /> <br />Anyway here it is: <br /> <br />The Upside Disc. <br /> <br />1.Once <br />2.Alive <br />3.Even Flow (the new version) <br />4.Hold On <br />5.Go <br />6.Animal <br />7.Rearview Mirror <br />8. Hold On <br />9.Spin The Black Circle <br />10.Not For You <br />11.Corduroy <br />12.State of Love and Trust <br />13.I Got ID <br />14.Hail Hail <br />15.Habit <br />16.Lukin <br />17.Given To Fly <br />18.Mankind <br />19. Brain of J <br />20. Do the Evolution <br />22. In My Tree <br />21. In Hiding <br /> <br /> <br />and \\"The downside disc\\"....... <br /> <br />1.Footsteps <br />2.No Way <br />3.Elderly Woman Behind  A Counter in a small town <br />4.Daughter <br />5.Immortality <br />6.Betterman <br />7.Wishlist <br />8.Who You Are <br />9.Nothingman <br />10. All Those Yesterdays <br />11. Off He Goes <br />12.Low Light <br /> <br />There you have it, I would of liked to of added some stuff from Binuaral but for some reason (as good as that album is) the sound of Eddie Vedders singing and the overall sound of the songs sound toned down without the usual brilliant distinct Pearl Jam sound. Can't Keep is the only really decent song off  \\"Riot Act\\". <br /> <br />Anyway there you go. I think if the record was like this it would of been alot better, but it still has some killer tracks on it anyway. <br /> <br />Get it for \\"I Got ID\\" and \\"State of Love and trust\\" and the new version of \\"Even Flow\\" anyway, its worth it.
B00008WT5C|5.0|LET THERE BE ROCK- This album from the Bon era is only surpassed by POWERAGE and contains some of the rawest, dirty, heavy driven songs AC/DC ever recorded. Great songs off this album include DOG EAT DOG, LET THERE BE ROCK,WHOLE LOTTA ROSIE,OVERDOSE, and PROBLEM CHILD.But like any AC/DC record all the songs rock.Sounds a lot more trashy and underproduced than BACK IN BLACK, or HIGHWAY TO HELL, but it makes up for it in raw energy and hard rockin tunes.
B000002BFZ|5.0|This is really a brilliant album and one of Pearl Jams best. <br />The sound is quite varied across the entire album, their are slow acoustic driven songs like \\"Off He Goes\\" \\"Around the Bend\\" <br /> <br />and hard fast rockers like \\"Hail Hail\\" \\"Habit\\" and \\"Lukin\\" <br />and also some different but fanatastic sounding songs like \\"Mankind\\" \\"Who You Are\\" \\"In My Tree\\" and \\"Red Mosquito\\" and completeley new sounding song called \\"Smile\\" <br /> <br />Overall this album (along with Vs) is Pearl Jams most satisfying listen from start to finish and is really a brilliant and interesting album to listen to. <br /> <br />There is no reason not to like this.
B000002KHH|5.0|What can I really say about this album, This stuff is just perfect! all the songs are metal classics. <br />I can easily say this is one of the greatest metal albums ever. <br />Killer riffs, attitude and great lyrics, Paranoid has it all. <br />Sabbath at his most inspiring moment, it's hard to find an album like this,  Maybe their first album and Masters of reality are almost as good as this one, but Paranoid is in my opinion is their best work ever. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0000AM6IY|5.0|This is one of the great classics that almost nobody has ever actually seen.  It stands as Leonard Bernstein's greatest accomplishment outside of the concert hall.  It stars a very young Natalie Wood in the lead role, and I will concede that this is the only movie I have ever seen of her's.<br /><br />WEST SIDE STORY is the Americanized Romeo & Juliet.  Instead of the Capulets & the Montagues we have rival gang warfare.  In place of family hostility there is the American dynamic of racism that comes to the fore.<br /><br />Just as in Shakespeare's play, these components combine for a true recipe for tragedy.  While there are plenty of parallels, however, the story does take on a life of its own and refuses to become a mere shadow of Shakespeare's masterpiece.<br /><br />I will admit that I've never really been big on musicals.  For me to give a musical 5 stars is, therefore, somewhat profound.  For fans of Bernstein and Wood this movie is a must.  The songs are memorable & the story is timeless!
B00008J4P5|5.0|What a great album these two persons have created. <br />it's amazing only guitar and drums and sounds really good and loud!!!! <br />This is a must have, seven nation army is the kind of music you love at the first listen!!! <br />the rest of the album is excellent: black math, ball and biscuit, there's no home..., etc. <br />I think these guys deserves more recognition, these guys are really loved in Europe (i could saw that while living in London) <br />smart lyrics and loud music, what else do you need?
6305212112|5.0|This movie is a hilarious & heartwarming movie!I'm not really from California I just lied cause I wuz scared that people would find out where I live but I'm from Alabama & they filmed this movie in Irondale,Alabama which is on one side of Birmingham & some people say that this is a true story although there is a novel of it!but anyways the movie is just so funny!I laughed my head off about the things Kathy Bates does especially the older,more insurance scene!
B000002LUB|4.0|After Ozzy's period the only good Sabbath is with Dio on vocals.  Heaven and hell and dehumanizer are really good albums.  I love TV crimes lyrics they really make you think about what really happens with religion.  It's a shame they didn't stay with Dio after this one.  anyway it was good to have great new music from Sabbath in the 90's.
B0000DD7LB|3.0|The music industry has continually - really, since its inception - thrown young desirable women at the pop marketplace in the interest of one thing: selling product. In these cases the music always seems to take a backseat, but now and again some decent stuff sneaks in. Britney Spears looks like the latest in this long trend, but her longevity is startling. Many thought that \\"Baby One More Time\\" would be the first and last time. Then \\"Oops, I Did it Again\\" (brilliantly covered by Richard Thompson, who successfully demonstrated that it's not in fact a bad song) became the new ubiquitous hit. Even those who don't follow the pop scene heard it. Then the Pepsi deal, then the Madonna kiss, then the marriage rumors, etc., etc. Spears' career has always seemed more driven by quasi-scandals and the type of news that fits in the \\"famous for being famous\\" category than by anything musical. She sold out from the start, which makes the accusation that she's a \\"sell out\\" pointless; she beat us all to it. Of course we all forget that these days artists themselves have limited control over their careers. The labels and managers run the show and have final say in just about everything. Artists have become industry pawns for the most part. And since Spears represents HUGE $$$$$$$$ for a lot of people, doubtless her every move is gauged, and maybe planned, by numerous impresarios. In short, she's become a commodity and an investment, to be bought and sold. Her skimpy outfits and often greased up skin represent only one necessary marketing ploy of the product that is Britney (it's been more or less proven that half-naked women increase the sales of just about anything; evidence of this appears everywhere).<br /><br />Having said all that, \\"In the Zone\\" manages to sneak in some good songs. The largest standout is \\"Toxic\\" with its Bollywood strings that apparently were not sampled (there's even a credit for a string arranger!). It's a very catchy and fun song all around. \\"Me Against The Music\\" has some infectious beats that would facilitate any dance floor situation. No doubt about it, the album has some good dance and pop. It's also very eclectic, with not only pop and dance, but hip hop, ballads, and rap. Overall, the music is good, but not astounding or earth-shattering. Then the lyrics. Most of the songs are about copulation (with others or oneself), and most of the lyrics revolve around how \\"hot\\" Britney is. This does get a little tiring by the end of the CD. It also brings up a question concerning the whole point behind this enterprise. This stuff sells, corporations know this, and so the persona, aura, and hype must be maintained at all costs. Whether this is a healthy thing to be supporting remains a personal decision. Regardless, \\"In The Zone\\" contains plenty of appealing dance music - whether or not one buys into the hype and all the empty nonsense that surrounds Britney Spears.he Music\\" has some infectious beats that would facilitate any dance floor situation.

B000268QB2|5.0|This band is superb, I have recommended them to near everyone I know and thy all agree after sampling the album. Well worth the buy, one you can listen to over nd over again. Well Done Lads.
B0002ZDVEU|1.0|It was a real test of endurance to to watch! A real waste of a good story. The camera work is so shakey and out of focus I think a monkey with a handi-cam could have done a better job.  Avoid at all costs!
B00005O5CM|5.0|Elle Woods is the president of her sorority, has the best boyfriend a girl can ask for, and lives in Southern Cali.<br /><br />Suddenly, she gets dumped by her boyfriend and is determined to win him back by becoming a \\"Jackie\\", not a \\"Marilyn\\".<br /><br />This movie ranks in my top list because it's funny, addictive, smart, has a lot of \\"snap\\" to it, and Elle will win you over in a heartbeat.<br /><br />Excellent ending, pretty predictable, but very entertaining.
B0001NBMBC|4.0|Hard to believe that behind the masks and schtick that Slipknot actually manages to get better and better with each passing album.  Their self titled debut, which catapaulted the band to unprecedented popularity, wasn't anything special, but their follow up \\"Iowa\\" showed that the band had the potential to be something really special.  \\"Vol. 3 (The Subliminal Verses)\\" improves on both albums, thanks in part to legendary producer Rick Rubin (who produced the best material to ever come from Slayer and Danzig) at the helm, and a matured band as well.  Tracks like \\"Duality\\" and \\"Circle\\" may sound a little too made for radio, but they are powerful songs nonetheless.  \\"Three Nil\\", \\"Vermilion Pt. 2\\", and \\"Virus of Life\\" are solid tracks as well, all of which find vocalist Corey Taylor channeling his Stone Sour soul and drummer extraordinairre Joey Jordinson thrashing away like he's the second coming of Dave Lombardo.  All in all, hardcore fans of Slipknot who thought the first album was the best thing since sliced bread will most likely be disappointed with \\"Vol. 3\\", but old time headbangers will be pleasently surprised.
B0000VAFO0|1.0|I waited in anticipation for this film, only to be let down.<br /><br />You've read the reviews. Here's why I don't like it-<br /><br />Bad acting...No good storyline....Too predictable.<br /><br />This is your basic predictable, starring FX only movie. You want to watch a good, fun vampyre movie? Go watch \\"From Dusk Till Dawn\\" or \\"John Carpenter's Vampires\\".
B00068IOWM|3.0|This album is probably closest in tone to 1982's \\"October\\".  The album starts off with the electrifying single \\"Vertigo\\", which of course sounds nothing like the rest of the album.  As we wade through \\"Miracle Drug\\", \\"Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own\\", \\"City of Blinding Lights\\", \\"Crumbs From Your Table\\", \\"One Step Closer\\" \\"Original of the Species\\", and \\"Yahweh\\", I am overwhelmed by one word to describe these songs; somber.  I feel like I am intruding into Bono's personal greiving over the loss of his father.  As beautiful as most of these songs are on their own, the cumulative effect is of one big downer.  HTDAAB is as personal a record as I have perhaps ever heard, it's just that it's not that fun peering into someone's transparent soul, especially one who's obviously been through some very tough times recently.  I recommend this album, but I have to say don't expect a collection of \\"Vertigo's\\" or even a Beautiful Day, they're not here. HTDAAB is a tough listen, but ultimately worth the time and emotion invested.  The DVD is a great collection of studio stuff.  If you are a true fan of the band, you need to own the Collector's Edition.
B0002YHFZC|5.0|I got this DVD the day it came out and watched it that evening. Since then, I have watched it at least two more times. The audio quality is brilliant, the performance is past even their usual high standard. The grainy film may be annoying for some people, but, to me, it is classic White Stripes and doesn't detract from the film at all.  <br /> <br />Jack White's guitar playing is unbelievable and the band has a stunning onstage presence, especially considering there are only the two of them. I saw the band live in Detroit last year, and this film captures their live energy as well as could be expected, but nothing even compares to actually being there. <br /> <br />The tracklisting has the standard elements of a post-Elephant show, opening with \\"When I Hear My Name\\" and \\"Black Math\\" and ending with \\"Boll Weevil.\\" However, it also includes some rare live songs, most notably \\"I Fought Pirhanas,\\" from their first album, and the mixes of \\"Death Letter\\"/\\"Grinnin In Your Face\\" and \\"Let's Build A Home\\"/\\"Goin' Back To Memphis.\\" Disappointingly absent is \\"Fell In Love With A Girl,\\" but, overall, the included songs are the best the White Stripes have to offer in a live performance. <br /> <br />There are actually a few extras, but you have to find them on your own... Mr. White wouldn't want it to be too easy to get at the extras, you know? Another review mentioned Jack's guitar as a Gibson Firebird... Live, Jack has three guitars with him- a 1964 Airline, a Kay hollowbody and a Domino Dawson, the main guitar being the red and white Airline. He uses the Airline (made of plastic!) for most of the songs except the ones that require a slide, such as \\"Seven Nation Army,\\" \\"Death Letter,\\" and \\"I Fought Pirhanas.\\" <br /> <br />While nothing can compare to the White Stripes' actual live performance, this DVD is the closest you'll get without actually being there. The White Stripes are one of the best rock bands around today, and I highly recommend purchasing this DVD - and their albums, if you haven't heard them already.
B00001W9G0|1.0|Is there anyone out there that agrees with me that this movie is big disappointment?  I will agree that Redford and Streisand are great actors, I've seen their work before.  They did great for the parts they were given to work with, but this movie wasn't up to par with their talents.  I am a person very easily moved by human experiences, fictional or real.  This movie did nothing for me.  I couldn't lose myself in their lives.  The plot seemed choppy and I wasn't drawn to any of the personalities portrayed.  For all the hype about it for so many years...what a let-down!
B0000C8AW2|3.0|I just listened to this enhanced cd (again)and it clearly has more punch than the original album...There are some outstanding songs...\\"Senor\\" and \\"Where are You Tonight\\"..\\"New Pony\\" is a raunchy blues and \\"We Better Talk This Over\\" has some pop verve thats ok to listen to. The problem is the band, the trumpets, it has not a clue how to support these songs..often sounding lame and insipid and plain just draggin behind...what a waste cause this was a collection of some of Dylan's most personally exposed songs...(Tho at times the lyrics were also pretty lame and wanting)...this album is like oozing mud over gems...but check out these lyrics...\\"there's a bright diamond gloom on the dark side  of this room and a pathway that leads up to the stars, if you don't believe there is a price for this sweet paradise, remind to show you the scars....\\" and \\"The last thing I remember before I stripped and kneeled was a trainload of fools brought down in a magnetic field, a gypsy with broken flag and a flashing ring said Son this ain't a dream no more its the real thing...\\"  That song just quoted..\\"Senor\\" was reminiscent of \\"Under the Volcano\\" in terms of desperation and theme...This album came after Blood on the Tracks and Desire, one stellar, the other almost there and more world wise...This album's confessional soap opera tone and very weird sounding arrangements were off putting..and like many of Dylan's post Blonde on Blonde albums, there are major self inflicted gaping wounds in artistry ( all intentioned) and yet there is always something going on that makes you understand he was experiencing things we hadn't even got to yet..
B0000DD7LC|5.0|This album is outstanding. It displays her wonderful musical talent including the keyboards, and vocals, and writing skills. Alicia's voice has clearly matured. She has the soul of one much older than her years. I have enjoyed every track on this CD.
B00006LLLN|4.0|I got the wonderful opportunity to see Alison perform live with Union Station in 2000 in Seattle and I was so happy I chose to see her live.  I remember that Shania Twain was performing live that same night as well, but I thought Alison was the better choice because she had more substance in my opinion.  Listening to this live CD reminded me of that magical night when I got to see her perform live at Benaroya Hall.  I would have given the disc 5 stars, but I don't relate to all of the songs she sings about because I have not lived a country life.  I judge a CD by how well I relate to it.  I thought Alison's vocals were dead on.  She proves that she is not only wonderful in the studio, but can sing live, a rare thing today.  The CD's standouts are Oh, Atlanta, When You Say Nothing At All and Let Me Touch You Awhile.  I really like the instrumental solos as well.  Alison and Union Station are so talented and down to earth.  Alison's real funny too.  My only issue is that Alison should sing some happier songs every now and then.  Overall I recommend this CD to any folk, bluegrass, new country or traditional country fan.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I've realy loved Billy Joel over the years, from Piano Man and his wonderful music videos to Dookie and now American Idiot.  I didn't  realize this man was so versatile.  It's almost like they were two different people. Wow !!!
B00003CX9W|5.0|This has to be one of the best movies that Disney ever made. I love this movie so much. I saw it first in the sixth grade in my art class and I couldn't stop talking about it. This movie took an idea that I never even thought about before and made it into a great film. The idea of taking classical music which is quite pleasant to listen to on its own already anyway and adding beautiful images which are pleasing to the eye took my breath away. There is a Fantasia 2000 out as well. It came out a while ago. It is nowhere near this film at all but I reviewed that too. So in conclusion great movie that is a cool way to get your kids to hear some of the classics and enjoy it too. The only thing is many of my friends who saw this movie as kids complained about a strange coincidence. Many of them said this movie made them feel sick to their stomaches, nauseated them, or even made them throw up. I don't know about this one as I never saw it as a small child, but it was very strange that so many people reacted to this feature in this way.
B0000E1WKE|1.0|Call it what you want \\"glissando - n : a rapid series of ascending or descending notes on the musical scale adv : (musical direction) in the manner of a glissando (with a rapidly executed series of notes); melisma  - n. pl. melismata (-m -t ) or melismas A passage of several notes sung to one syllable of text.\\" - the excessive use of it gets pretty darn annoying on this album.  The only song of any worth on this album is the final one \\"Joy to the World\\" with a wonderful gospel choir backing her up.  Spend 79 cents and download that one song and pass on the rest of the album.  Zero stars should be an option. <br />
B0001ZX0OW|2.0|I was waiting with great anticipation to see this film.  I had heard the great reviews.  One critic even said it was the best film in 30 years.  Oh, was I disappointed with this story.  The acting was good, but not completely convincing.  I didn't feel any connection between any of the actors.  And, Sean Penn's acting in 21 Grams surpasses this film by far.  I also thought Tim Robbin's was far better in Shawshank Redemption.  I don't like Kevin Bacon at all.  Although, he did some of the better acting in this movie.  The plot was full of problems of believability.  The added \\"twists\\" that didn't work and were so easy to spot coming.  Motives that were completely lacking in substance.  I don't want to blow the ending for anyone.  So, I won't reveal the outcome.  But, how many people can get murdered or disappear (without anyone caring) in one short period of time in one fairly good neighborhood?  This crime spree shouldn't have been filmed.  I would say pass on this film.  I think all the Oscar attention for this film.  Was more due more to the long overlooked talent these actors have demonstrated in the past.  Than how they performed in Mystic River.  Mystifyingly overrated.
B00030590I|3.0|Hero=communist propoganda.  Yeah, it's true, but I still enjoyed watching it for its martial arts.  You can still enjoy it, also, but you shouldn't agree with the film's message, if you're an American, that is.
B00009XITP|3.0|I thought 'What a girl wants' was great. It was not a very dark story but a fun comedy. There was a handsome guy Colin Firth.  It was also funny that Daphne was not suited to English high class society. <br /> <br />It seemed like everyone was in a struggle. Especially the struggle between Daphne and Clarisa was really exciting because Clarisa was very rude to Daphne but they did not actually fight. It made us laugh. Daphne changed because she wanted to fit herself into English society therefore Ian was disappointed. Finally, Daphne got back to her family and fell in true love with Ian. My favorite scene was when Daphne danced with Henry. I would recommend this movie to my best friends.    <br />
0783226063|5.0|I first saw previews of this film when I was 14, worms?, strange suits?, yes, yes, I had no idea that I would learn to appreciate the Herbert/Lynch realm. I then saw it a few years later and was totally blown away at what a wonderful and strange universe Lynch had created. I had never seen anything like it before and I was raised on a very sterile Star Wars. The mythology explored was fantastic. Each character had an individual notion and was strange, exotic and weird. This is a film I will remember forever. Great sets, great costumes, and the dialogue is sufficient to keep you interested. I liked the Mentats, the evil Harkoneens, the Sarkadaur were awesome! The space scenes were bizarre, the guild navigators from another universe! It goes on and on, in a believable world not of our own. No, you won't understand everything about it, but that is the good part, that your quest will take you to new levels. I read the book and all the sequels after this. Thank you Mr Lynch!
B00005JMAH|5.0|When I first saw the movie in the theater, I was unhappy with how the story line was treated.  But, after repeated viewings of the DVD version, I have come to see the logic behind this version and find myself even more amused by what is seen in this movie.  It does keep to the general story line as put forth originally in the books, but as is explained in the second disc of this set, some things just had to be omitted for cimeographic reasons. <br /> <br />With the above in mind, this two disc set is an excellent transfer of the original movie.  It also outdoes the first two movies by the fact that it has interviews with J.K. Rowling, the director and actors of this movie.  I have qualms with the games as found in the second disc, but being that I'm \\"over the age of 13\\" (way too over!), I probably am not the best to comment on them. <br /> <br />As with the original Harry Potter books, this movie makes me eager for the rest of the sequels to come out.  No, this movie isn't an exact carbon copy of the book, but if that is what one is expecting, you'll be very dissapointed.  I have yet to see a movie that exactly follows the book that it was based upon.
B0002IQNAG|4.0|Once again George Romero crawls out from the insides of guts and gives us a decent zombie flick that is better than all the Italian cheapies. Horror shock meister Argento produced this tale of mad zombies that are out for revenge against a surviving human population decimated by warfare, mass culture and epidemic. Wonderful and fun to look at till the end.
B0002YHFZC|5.0|I saw The White Stripes play in a smaller venue just before they blew up, and it was one of the best live shows I have ever seen.  This DVD captures much of the energy, spontaneity and enthusiasm that makes them so great on stage. <br /> <br />As far as the sound quality goes, it leaves little to be desired.  The film is shot on Super 8 AND 16mm (contrary to another reviewer's understanding) and may be a bit grainy for some.  For me, it only added to the sense raw power that this Detroit City's power duo showers upon their audience.
B000059PQ5|1.0|This is an overated film and I have heard that it was always great. Once I got around to renting it, I was sorely mislead, not only by all the hype this piece of junk got, but by the reviews, who wrote them anyways? If you watch the DVD extra on the making of the film, the actor talks about how they didn't have a script or money for most of the film, and I said to myself, \\"that is why its so bad.\\" And truly, this is one bad piece of film making, played by bad actors, on bad, dirty sets on some abandoned Spanish/Italian back lot. The absurd plot puts Django, some half drunk injun carrying a loaded coffin with a 800 lb Maxim machine gun, which was used out of context in the film, because it never was cooled or ran out of bullets. He visits a sect of \\"red hooded\\" hooligans who look stupid with the red hoods as they shoot mexicans for fun. Okay, who wrote the script, a 12 year old? The Mexican bandits are even worse, they shoot anyone. There's a terrible scene where Djano shoots 120 of the red hooded bad guys without burning the barrel of the gun or running out of ammo, nice touch. In effect, this is a film without a basis, and the only thing remotely resembling interest is the young, blue eyed, non-English speaking early role of (Nero). Grade D.
0684808323|2.0|I was really excited about reading this book.  I was living in Vegas and working at a Caesars, so to read about the history and lore of the city was intriguing to me.  Yet, this book was hard to finish, I had to force myself to read it.  It did not captivate me and I did not care what became of the characters.  It was less than enjoyable and I was greatly disappointed.  I find the real life experience of living and working in Sin City to be much more fascinating than reading about it.
B000002P5R|5.0|Although all of these songs were included in the several handwritten proposed track listings that Jimi prepared for this album,presumably song publishing costs caused several songs to be omitted,though they are avaiable elsewhere,specifically \\"The Drifter's Escape\\",\\"Bleeding Heart\\" & \\"Highway Chile\\"(yes,Jimi had requested a tape copy from Polydor/UK of that vintage 1967 Jimi Hendrix Experience UK B-side for possible inclusion on \\"First Rays\\").More unfortunate is that several songs on Jimi's list never got professionally recorded,though of late,Jimi's home cassette songwriting tapes of those songs have been purchased from drummer Mitch Mitchell.I will say,however,that as with several other early CD releases from \\"Experience Hendrix\\",(\\"Are You Experienced?\\",\\"Axis:Bold as Love\\" & \\"Electric Ladyland\\")that the Equalisation is midrange heavy,and a total aversion to using noise reduction means that certain sonic faults that could have been corrected aren't corrected(most glaringly,the noise during the first few bass guitar notes on \\"Freedom\\".The old Alan Douglas remastering of \\"The Cry of Love\\" album on Polydor/UK & Reprise/U.S.A. corrected that noise.
B000089RVX|2.0|The ingredients for success are here, particularly in the powerful voice of the lead singer.  Unfortunately, there's little that is new or interesting in the music.  Frankly, the \\"woe-is-me\\" gothic darkness thing is tiresome and shockingly immature from this group who are no longer teens.  Fascinating how their target audience has swallowed the bait, though.  Certainly these tunes are preferable to the pre-packaged, programmed pop singers of today.  But these songs aren't really any deeper or better; they merely have a different shade of surface gloss.   <br />
B00029LNHS|2.0|I was cross when I bought this album. I thought it would be good, but it really isn't. A PARENTAL ADVISORY is issued to this album, but was never labeled with it. It contains strong lanuguage and simple sexual content. Please parents, DON'T buy this for your children. The only good songs are: Lets get It Started, Lets Get Retarded, Where Is The Love, & The Boogie That Be.
B00005MKQV|4.0|I have to admit I originally wasn't crazy about \\"Music\\". After the spectacular \\"Ray of Light\\", I thought \\"Music\\" was a bit weak. The songs were either a hit or miss with me. It took some time for the cd to grow on me. Considering Madonna's last studio album \\"American Life\\" (which was disasterous artistically and commercially), \\"Music\\" sounds brilliant. Mirwais was ok as a producer but I do think that he was vastly overrated. The only single I really liked off the album was the title track with its Daft Punk-like beats. I like \\"Don't Tell Me\\" but I thought as a single it was a pretty weak follow up to \\"Music\\". I never cared for \\"What It Feels Like For a Girl\\". The lyrics alone are pretty silly and an indication to the absurdity and pretentiousness found on \\"American Life\\". Joni Mitchell Madonna is not in the songwriting department and it really shows in her lyrics on \\"Music\\". Nevertheless, I absolutely loved the dance tracks \\"Imprsesive Instant\\", \\"Runaway Lover\\" and the gorgeous ballads \\"Paradise (Not For Me)\\", and \\"Gone\\". I bought the import version later on which includes bonus remixes of the singles off \\"Music\\" and the very tame music video \\"What It Feels Like For a Girl\\" (I will never understand how MTV decided to ban this POS for a music video). The remixes are killer, especially the Paul Oakenfold remix of \\"What It Feels Like For a Girl\\" and Deep Dish's remixes of \\"Music\\". Despite the fact that this album was far from perfect, I still thought this import version of \\"Music\\" is worth owning.
B00003CXA4|5.0|Just as Mahatma Gandhi's teachings will always live on in the heart and minds of all humans, so should this movie withstand the test of cinematic time. For those who have no other resources, this movie is also a standing testament to Gandhi's real legacy. First of all, Ben Kingsley, who plays Gandhi, does the best job portraying a historical figure on screen than anyone else I have ever seen. True, Jamie Foxx portrayed Ray Charles really well in the recent Ray, but the eyes are always what differs an actor from the subject, whereas Foxx was always wearing sunglasses. Here, Ben Kingsley not only portrays the eyes, but the walk, the voice, the look, even the squiggly vein on the side of his head that both he and Gandhi share. Second, this is one of the best epic movies ever made. More extras were used in this film than any other is history (of course before digital multiplication of extras) because of the willingness of the Indian people to re-enact their patron's life. The movie has a grand scale and teaches us all the meaning of peace and non-violence, just as Gandhi would have us do. Richard Attenborough has captured the essence of India pre-independence and shown us not only the hostility but the humanity of the British without totally turning them into monsters, as Gandhi did not see them that way. Everyone should see this movie, everyone.
630463949X|5.0|This is the only concert video that I own, and I can watch this one over and over. The tension between Lindsay and Stevie elevates it to a new level. All the songs that were written during the \\"Rumors\\" era showed just how personal things had gotten. \\"The Chain\\" and \\"Landslide\\" show Lindsay and Stevie at their most intimate. Mick and John seem to be enjoying themselves throughout. It seemed that this concert provided some catharthis for everyone in the band; and  we all benefited from it. My favorites are \\"The Chain\\", \\"Go Your Own Way\\", \\"Landslide\\", \\"Big Love\\", \\"Go Insane\\", \\"Bleed To Love Her\\" and the finale of \\"Tusk\\" and \\"Don't Stop\\" with the USC. Incredible, fascinating, entertaining; what more could you ask for?!
B0000TB01Y|3.0|Anyone who knows about musical theater was anticipating this musical when it came out. I mean, it is a new Stephen Schwartz musical straight to Broadway! So I bought it and was pretty disapointed. To me, it sounds like a re-hash of something that wasn't too popular originally. Let me explain: Schwartz wrote a musical called Children of Eden back in the early nineties. Sadly, due to the Gulf War, it never went to Broadway from London and became a popular show for smaller theaters with a little more money. The only recording available is the New Jersey cast. But Children of Eden is an original superb show. Everything about it was fresh when I first heard it and it came from a different part of Schwartz than normal. When I first started to listen to Wicked, I heard Children of Eden. But not fresh, not new, old and re-hashed. Like it was put through his head again with different lyrics. There is a strong singing chorus telling the story, just like in COE, with almost identical harmonies. Now that isn't to say that this show didn't have highlights. Some of the songs were clever and fun to listen to but not the majority. Idina Menzel, Kristin Chenowith, and Norbert Leo Butz were excellent as usual and they are the only reason I gave it three stars. I also credit Schwartz as being an amazing writer and composer, but not in this instance. Now, I know that there is a big difference from hearing a show and seeing a show. And if I were to see this show, I am sure that I would probably like it much better. But we aren't rating the viewing, we are rating the hearing. The show is pakced full of great special effects and costumes and sets, but the music and lyrics seem un-original. That is all I am saying. I suggest Children of Eden for a better musical, hearing wise.

B0000062FN|5.0|Santana III is the followup to their best selling Abraxas and like that album would go to #1 on the Billboard album charts. While this album is heavy on the percussion and Carlos Santana's guitar work remains outstanding, it's a darker album which takes numerous listens to fully appreciate. This would also be the last album recorded by their classic or \\"Woodstock\\" lineup and it hints at the jazz-fusion they'd perform on their excellent Caravanserai album.<br /><br />Everything here is very good as the band continues to grow musically even if the songs aren't as immediate as those on Santana or Abraxas. The biggest hit here is the upbeat \\"Everybody's Everything\\" which features accompaniment from the Tower Of Power horn section and a sizzling guitar solo from future Journey guitarist Neal Schon. \\"Toussaint L' Overture\\" is one of their best tracks ever and is one of their finest mixes of intensity and their Latin percussion sound. The minor hit \\"No One To Depend On\\" is an excellent mid-tempo track similar to their hit \\"Oyo Come Va\\" only stronger with its jam during the solo. The instrumentals \\"Batuka\\" and \\"Jungle Strut\\" are both outstanding and clearly point to their future fusion direction. The laid back \\"Guajira\\" with its piano hook and the intense \\"Para Los Rumberos\\" are both solid Latin-tinged tracks. The moody \\"Taboo\\" is also an outstanding track which builds in power until its sudden end. \\"Everything's Coming Our Way\\" is very good and could've been a hit since it's a little more radio friendly than \\"No One To Depend On.\\" The remastered version contains 3 bonus tracks from a 1971 performance at the Fillmore West. While the live versions of \\"Batuka\\" and \\"Jungle Strut\\" are solid and vary little from the studio versions, it's the previously unreleased \\"Gumbo\\" that is the best and rivals the strongest studio tracks on the album. An excellent album, newcomers may want to pick up Abraxas or Santana I first, since this is a less commercial offering. However, this is among their best work and grows on you over time.best work and grows on you over time.

0764009842|5.0|A sumptuous, wonderful adaptation; unexpectedly and disarmingly excellent.<br /><br />I was a little hesitant going into this:  having read the novel a couple of times and declared it my own, I had long fondly imagined the scenes and characters without any need for assistance, thank you very much.<br /><br />Consequently, I felt the way many Tolkien fans must have felt before those three recent movies came out:  leery that my coveted imaginings would be sullied by what might prove to be a jarrring and irreversible contamination.<br /><br />These fears were misplaced, however.  The full vitality of Dickens's bittersweet classic -- all the heaping joys and sorrows of life -- comes through quite powerfully in this handsome BBC version.  After about 25 minutes I was literally on the edge of my seat.<br /><br />Oh, and speaking of this version:  they spent some money on it, you'll be happy to know.  It's not one of those innumerable stuffy BBC dramas that take place (for budget considerations if nothing else) in an intolerable series of drawing rooms and antechambers.  No, they did this one right:  the blokes went outside and built some proper sets, and it shows.<br /><br />Yes, though fully prepared to dislike it, I find myself here with little ammunition for complaint.  I wish Traddles hadn't suffered deletion; he is one character I have difficulty picturing and could have used some help.  Also, the actress who played Dora was not exactly my conception of her . . . but this is nitpicking.

0385508417|4.0|John Grisham takes a satyrical look at the overblown, frenetic, materialistic mess that we in America have made of what should be the most beautiful holiday of the year.  His main characters are Luther and Nora Krank, whose only child Blair is departing for Peru in order to help the poor and needy children there.  Devastated at her departure, they realize that Christmas will not be nearly as much fun without their daughter.  Luther is attracted to some travel literature and decides that it will make a lot more sense to spend their money on a cruise this year instead of blowing money on a season that they don't even enjoy any more.  Little do they realize that they will be under pressure from neighbors, friends, and even the local police and firemen to conform and celebrate with everyone else.  Soon comic complications set in, and the Kranks' plans seem to be for naught.  Grisham seems to have as deft a hand as a comic writer as he does when picturing courtroom drama.  This is a fun and light read for the holidays.
6302814782|4.0|THE LOST BOYS successfully blends vampires with the innocuous Eighties.  Sure, there's some blood, gore, fangs, and fright, but ultimately the viewer is overwhelmed by all the spiked, superficial big hair.  There's more hair spray than horror to this little jewel, but that's alright:  THE LOST BOYS still delivers a gruesome good time, augmented by some jolly good laughs.<br /><br />Santa Carla, California.  A beach, an ocean, a free-spirited community, a teen haven.  Bingo:  Vampire paradise.  Into this swirling netherworld comes a divorced mother and her two sons; it doesn't take long (like, the first night) before a grinning, snarling pack of teen vamps comes calling. One of the sons becomes \\"tainted\\"; the other enlists the help of a couple of goober brothers to reverse the curse.  The movie rushes like a Cyndi Lauper MTV video to its aggressive conclusion, and all I can say after watching the carnage and destruction is I'm darned glad I'm not a plumber.<br /><br />Jason Patric and Corey Haim are fine and divine as the troubled brothers.  Kiefer Sutherland can be spooky simply reading a gingerbread recipe, so he shines as the ringleader of the teen vampire brood.  Dianne West and Edward Herrmann provide boring adult roles, while crusty Barnard Hughes, a most eccentric grandpa, is given the film's absolute best line.  THE LOST BOYS is good Eighties stuff--a great visual treat with a kicker musical soundtrack that will leave you twisting your hair. . .and wondering where that hair spray is.<br /><br />--D. Mikels
B0002ZDVEU|4.0|\\"The Bourne Supremacy\\" is the second film based on Robert Ludlum's espionage thrillers about amnesiac CIA assassin Jason Bourne. But unlike its predecessor, \\"The Bourne Identity\\", \\"Supremacy\\" isn't based on Ludlum's novel that bears its name. At best \\"The Bourne Supremacy\\" was vaguely inspired by the novel. It is essentially an original screenplay by Tony Gilroy. This film finds Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) two years after \\"The Bourne Supremacy\\" but with no more understanding of his past than when we left him. Still plagued by debilitating headaches, still unable to remember who he was or what he did, and still accompanied by his paramour Marie (Franka Potente), Bourne is living a quiet life \\"off the grid\\" in India. Unfortunately for him, someone leaves Bourne's fingerprint behind with 2 murdered CIA agents in Berlin, and an assassin has tracked him to India. CIA agent Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) is intent on bringing Bourne in, believing that he has information crucial to her investigation of stolen CIA money.<br /><br />\\"The Bourne Supremacy\\" is a character-driven action film that will find wide appeal. The film has plenty of action -fight sequences, car chases, great stunts- but they're driven by Jason Bourne's desperation, not by a need for spectacle. Bourne is a post-modern, post-Cold War hero: the victim of a corrupt system, forced into action. He's a ruthless but reluctant killer with whom the audience sympathizes, if not actually pities. Director Paul Greengrass chose to film \\"The Bourne Supremacy\\" in a gritty, photo-realistic style that keeps the audience in the center of the action and close to Bourne's point of view. On the face of it, this sounds like a good idea. Greengrass took it too far, though, sometimes allowing style to stand in the way of story. Too much of the cinematography is murky, and too much of it is handheld. The camera is dynamic, constantly moving. That's fine, but there is way too much shake. It's annoying and could be pretty unpleasant for those audience members prone to motion sickness. The ideas behind Greengrass' shooting style are appropriate to the film's themes, but the near-constant camera shake makes this big budget action film look amateurish.<br /><br />Like \\"The Bourne Identity\\", \\"The Bourne Supremacy\\" is elevated by a top-notch cast. Pamela Landy is a one-note character, but Joan Allen assures that she is taken seriously. Veteran Scottish thespian Brian Cox plays senior CIA agent Ward Abbott. Julia Stiles returns in her small role as a CIA agent and former logistics officer. Matt Damon is appealing and sympathetic as Bourne. \\"The Bourne Supremacy\\" would have benefitted from a steadier camera, but it's still a thoroughly enjoyable action film. It has suspense, action, real characters, and a great cast.<br /><br />The DVD: Bonus features include deleted scenes, 9 mini documentaries, text \\"Cast and Filmmakers\\" bios, a DVD-ROM (Windows only), and an audio commentary by director Paul Greengrass. Peter Greengrass, producers Frank Marshall and Patrick Crowley, Matt Damon, and stunt co-ordinator Dan Bradley all contribute numerous interviews to the documentaries. \\"Matching Identities: Casting\\" (5 minutes) talks about the actors and their roles. In \\"Keeping It Real\\" (5 minutes), actors and crew discuss Paul Greengrass' approach to filming. In \\"Blowing Things Up\\" (4 minutes) the stunt co-ordinator and the special effects foreman take us through filming the explosion in the house in Munich. \\"On the Move with Jason Bourne\\" (5 minutes) is about the film's locations: Berlin, Moscow, and Goa, India. \\"Bourne to be Wild: Fight Training\\" (4 minutes) discusses the fight sequence between the 2 remaining Treadstone operatives. \\"Crash Cam\\" (6 minutes) is about shooting the car chase sequence in Moscow. This documentary is worthwhile, as the chase employed some unusual methodology. \\"The Go-Mobile Revs Up the Action\\" (7 minutes) continues the discussion of filming cars by introducing us to a contraption that allows actors to be filmed at the wheel of a car while moving. \\"Anatomy of a Scene\\" (4 1/2 minutes) explores the bridge and barge chase scene in Berlin. Composer John Powell talks about the score in \\"Scoring the Film with John Powell\\" (5 minutes). Director Paul Greengrass leaves technical talk to the documentaries. His audio commentary expounds on characters and story, including some insights into Bourne's character. Subtitles are available in Spanish and French, captioning in English.

B00005JMAH|4.0|This 3rd installment of J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series finds 13-year-old Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) once again stuck with his Aunt and Uncle, the most dreadfully unimaginative Muggles in the world, and looking forward to the start of the new school year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The wizard world is abuzz with talk of notorious murderer Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), who has escaped from the previously impenetrable wizard prison Azkaban. Ostensibly the cohort of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, it is believed that Sirius' intent is to kill Harry Potter. Harry, Ron (Rupert Grint), and Hermione (Emma Watson) start the school year under a cloud of gloom, as Dementors, the life-sucking guardians of Azkaban prison, are stationed around Hogwarts to protect the school. A new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Professor Lupin (David Thewlis), befriends Harry and helps him fight his fear of the Dementors, who seem to affect Harry more than they do others.<br /><br />\\"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\\" takes a distinctly dark turn that I didn't detect in the books until Book 5. Brooding cinematography, increasingly neurotic characters, and ubiquitous blue tones make Hogwarts seem a menacing place, not the safe haven it has been in the previous films. In truth, danger has always lurked around every corner at Hogwarts, but security and fun were never far away. Director Alfonso Cuaron's vision is not so reassuring. The film doesn't hesitate to jump right into an already progressing story and assumes that the audience knows the main characters. Nevertheless, the first hour or so of the movie is disjointed. It is a little difficult to make sense of the action during this segment, because it skips around abruptly, adding to the film's sense of unease. The central narrative is captivating, but doesn't begin until halfway through. Harry is, as usual, imperiled by what he doesn't know about his past, because no one bothers to explain it to him. The dialogue is inferior to the first two Harry Potter movies, and, indeed, there is less of it. John Williams' score seems cheap, as he unabashedly recycles Darth Vader's Theme from \\"Star Wars\\" for all of the \\"evil\\" scenes. Michael Gambon has replaced the late Richard Harris as Headmaster Albus Dumbledore and doesn't seem possessed of his weight or his playfulness. But Dumbledore's role is small in this movie, so we have yet to see what Gambon will do with the part.<br /><br />Alfonso Cuaron may not have been the best choice to direct \\"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\\". His interpretation is too dark for this segment of the Harry Potter saga, while Harry still views Hogwarts as pleasant refuge from life's harsh realities, full of enchantment and possibilities. The first half of \\"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\\" suffers from poor editing and should have been more coherent. Nevertheless, this is an entertaining adventure once it gets going. It's probably too scary for children under 6 and perhaps for older children who are easily frightened.inferior to the first two Harry Potter movies, and, indeed, there is less of it.

0767847431|5.0|The Golden Voyage of Sinbad is by far the best Sinbad movie I have ever seen !!!(with all due respect to the 7th Voyage).     Unlike others, the sets look real, imaginative, and authentic. The flavor of this movie is so real!   The Acting is wonderful,(I love the accents), the hero, superb! (He is on our list of \\"Manly Men\\") And no one ends up looking like a \\"Hollywood Star\\", which thing always disturbs me in other films, ruining the atmosphere that they were trying to create.  I draw attention especially to Tom Baker's awesome portrayal of the evil Prince Kurah, the villian of the piece, the evil following them, \\"clad in robes of silk...\\"    All right, to the movie.    This movie begins with Captain Sinbad (John Phillip Law) finding a strange golden tablet that a strange magical creature drops on his deck. That night a storm almost wrecks their ship, and drives them upon the waves to the land of Marabia, where the evil Prince Kurah (Tom Baker) tries to reclaim the tablet from him by force. Sinbad escaps from him and flees to the city, where he meet the Vizier, who has another, similar, tablet, and explains the strange tale of the tablet to him, and its third missing segment, and thus they embark upon the golden voyage to the mythical island of Lemulia, pursued by Kurah, and accompanied by Sinbad's loyal and manly crew, the slave girl, Marriana, and a hopelessly lost merchant's son, who provides much of the comic relief of the movie.  On Lemulia they overcome many obstacles, including being captured by bloodthirsthy natives, and fighting the stone figure of a many-limbed goddess, whom Prince Kurah brings to life with his evil craft.  The movie ends with the end of an eternal conflict between the \\"forces of good and evil\\", ending only because of the deeds of weak and mortal men, and all before the Fountain of Destiny, \\"Where the gods smile upon mortal men.\\"    It is an old movie, but a classic! The best that Harry-Hausen ever made! (in fact, after seeing other Harry-Haused movies, I couldn't believe they were even made by him, this one being so superior! (In my opinion.) Hurrah for Hessler and Harry-Hausen!!!!!    A wonderful story, full of magic and mystery! I highly recommend this movie!!!
6305558167|3.0|The story of Camelot is a wonderful one. The problem is, there are too many characters and far too many events and story-arcs to fit into a movie of a reasonable length. This movie became long and it still was not enough time for anything like sufficient character development and sufficient character interaction. The next time someone tells this story using this medium, I hope that they either create a miniseries or limit the story with respect to point of view. So many different point of views are fascinating: Arthur's, Merlin's, Morganna's, Guinevere's, Mordred's, Lancelot's, even Percival's.<br /><br />It's always a bad sign in a movie when the music gets louder.<br /><br />It means that the music is trying to generate the emotion which is missing from the characters and their interactions.<br /><br />Still, there were some very nice bits. I liked how Arthur asked to be knighted and I liked the story bit about Uther.

This is news to mainstream America because brilliant artists are excluded from mainstream music to make room for commodity promotion and market-researched pseudo-art.  <br /> <br />There is nothing inherently anti-establishment in hip-hop or rap, but it's NEWS when a couple songs get played in any genre that don't promote consumption, sex, drugs, and violence. It's NEWS when music gets played that has informative anti-establishment angst and not destructive anti-human angst.  <br /> <br />The success of this album is fine. But it raises the question of selection. It raises the question of why we have imporverished knowledge of impoverished genius. It raises the question of why danceable dissent is the exception and not the rule of media in democracy.

6305252572|5.0|Ah, 48 Hrs.  Simply put, one of the greatest movies ever made.  I've probably seen this movie about 10 times in the past decade, and it never grows tiresome.  While it's loosely classifiable as a \\"buddy movie,\\" this is no stupid Chris Farley-David Spade-type vehicle.  With career-defining performances from both Nick Nolte and Eddie Murphy, this is one of the few movies that have managed to successfully bring together the action and comedy genres.  The dialogue is smart, the action is frequent, and the plot moves at a breakneck pace.  In other words, it's American filmmaking at its finest.  What more could you want?<br /><br />Even more than most cop movies, 48 Hrs. succeeds at capturing the tense, harrowing atmosphere that comes with urban street life.  Even on the nice new widescreen DVD I just got, there's a rather dark and gloomy feel to this movie that's only somewhat offset by Murphy's considerable comedic abilities.  The movie starts with a bunch of officers of the law being murdered, and it doesn't get much nicer from there.  48 Hrs. revels in the seemier side of the city, a world populated by hookers, drug dealers, and assorted other lowlifes.  Foreshadowing the emergence of brutally realistic cop dramas like The Shield, even the cops are somewhat unsavory figures.<br /><br />48 Hrs. is a quintessential guy movie, combining tons of azz-kicking action with the kind of gritty realism at which director Walter Hill excels.  Hill doesn't pull too many punches here, as there are people being cut down by gunfire every few minutes, explicit sexual references, some gratuitous nudity, and frequent profanity highlighted by numerous uses of the \\"N word.\\"  In one especially hilarious scene, a police captain directs the latter epithet at Murphy's character, which wouldn't be all that notable if the captain weren't black himself. In general, 48 Hrs. provides the kind of politically incorrect look at race relations that's increasingly hard to find these days, as Nolte's gruff cop Jack and Murphy's slick convict Reggie become symbolic (at least initially) of the often dim views of each other that blacks and whites hold.  There are stereotypes both black and white to be found here, but hey, it's the '80's.<br /><br />When it's not busy examining the state of race relations in America circa 1982, 48 Hrs. offers the kind of memorable scenes that are all too rare in the often by-the-numbers cop-movie genre.  Reggie's handling of a redneck bar replete with Confederate flags and a topless dancer in a cowboy hat is justifiably legendary, and there's also a bruising back-alley brawl between Jack and Reggie, a gunfight staged between a moving car and a city bus, and the tense concluding standoff in yet another abandoned alley.  There's no frenetic cutting or abundance of CGI effects to be found, but in their place is something more valuable: good direction.<br /><br />In the end, you'd be hard-pressed to think of a cop movie made since this one that compares to it (well, except for L.A. Confidential, but that's a given).  Hill, Murphy, and Nolte were all obviously at their peaks here, and the result is a movie that succeeds at everything it tries.  I heard there was also a sequel to this movie made, called 48 More Hrs. or something like that, although I've also heard from some corners that no such thing ever happened.  At any rate, this movie is the goods.

Needless to say, I don't believe in their \\"Old Testy\\" God or or the \\"new and improved\\" one that shows up in the Gospels who apparently mellowed out \\"once he had a kid.\\" The dogma is indeed as quaint and outdated as a Greek myth! Sam Harris' book does a great deal to add lucidity to the conversation about the existence of a \\"text-based\\" God (if one could indeed *have* that conversation).  <br /> <br />Though we can still be filled with wonder and awe when looking at a marvelous sunset, the countless stars in the night sky, a field of wildflowers or a sleeping baby, we need not attach such depth of feeling to some tragic, universal sacrifice with Earth as center stage for some cosmic battle between good and evil. Our desire to understand the unknowable and seek out divinity within or without need not indulge the sheer madness that has ensued since humanity began to take these notions as \\"Gospel truth.\\" I see the potential for the divine, I just don't attempt to define it and keep it all boxed up and bound by millenia-old notions of good and evil. <br /> <br />The metaphors Mr. Harris has incorporated are timely and potent and reading them should immediately cause that long-dimmed light bulb above the Evangelical head to be illuminated in a revelatory flash in a way that no Scriptural study earnestly ever could! Alas, facts and persuasive reason are likely not enough as some of the utterly dim-witted reviews \\"defending\\" their faith in this thread bear out. Their ship of doctrine and biblical truth, full of holes, is sinking and they're frantically flailing with a bucket in an almost pathetic form of denial.  <br /> <br />To the undying faithful, their current panic is that the empirical evidence and social consensus is about to reveal to their child-like belief system the equivalent of there being no Santa or Easter Bunny. But it should also reassure them there's no boogie man under the bed (save their fundamentalist brethren). It should also signal them to wake up from their simplistic dreams about a complex world in times of unprecedented danger. Oh, if only Christian principles stressed \\"be here now\\" rather than some \\"kingdom\\" with shiny gold streets and milk and honey tributaries (let's hope there are cookie trees and Oakley sunglasses while we're at it).  <br /> <br />When one thinks of the brutality wrought as a result of religious domination, one cannot merely compensate with the good works that have been done in the name of religion. I'm sorry, it doesn't work that way, particularly when we are talking about such a \\"wonder-working power\\" that has had thousands of years to soften hearts, reveal absolute truth and convert wicked souls. The stats don't look good for organized religion. Indeed, their God, compared to their Satan, looks like an absolute chump.  Donald would surely tell him \\"You're fired!\\" It's just too easy to dismiss evil as a result of a Satan-controlled world; to reject accountability and chalk it up to some supernatural nemesis bent on making God look like a pansy. Does it not seem any less ridiculous that the god(s) are angry and they sent floods (or withheld the rain) to teach us a lesson? Is it not blatantly absurd to regard any instance of faulty ethics and inhumanity to others on OUR part as simply \\"God's will\\"? <br /> <br />Catty aside: Apparently, it makes perfect sense to the likes of media missionary Jerry Falwell who think we got what we \\"deserved\\" on 9-11 because of our cultural waywardness. What is he up to these days, about 220? 230? (\\"neo-conservative\\" estimate) Remember Jerry, it's easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich and round fellow like you to enter the Kingdom of Heaven. You need to slim down between now and Rapture time. Oh wait, you'll be \\"transformed\\" in an instant. I forgot! <br /> <br />Sam Harris has taken a courageous step forward, given the knee-jerk and brain-stem-disconnected reaction of fundamentalists on both sides of the world. These are the true lost souls: those whose spirits are so agitated by the questioning of their dogma that they revert to a radical primal state of violence fed by their fear rather than naturally drawn towards acts of humility, compassion and connectedness that their \\"Savior\\" has supposedly given a perfect example. Rather than recognize the present danger of fundamentalists in control of awful destructive power, they chirp along like these are the opening scenes to the some cheesy Tim LaHaye-inspired Last Battle of Armageddon, and will willingly let their delusion threaten our civilization and the planet.  <br /> <br />Back when Western Civilization had just agreed to the world not being flat, the Catholic Church was still ready to send Galileo to the flames for professing that Earth was not the center of the cosmos. Yet, modern Christians, fundamentalist and moderate, still metaphorically believe just that; that some sort of Star Wars medieval drama is playing out on Planet Earth and it all is destiny. I guess that's the way a God can be omniscient and still grant his creation free will. You just subscribe to the Shakespearean notion that all the world's a stage and we are all merely players. <br /> <br />I hope Sam Harris is successful in promoting the concepts in his book, that the death threats he will undoubtedly get remain benign, that he opens a great many eyes and hearts and that his book, \\"The End of Faith\\" triggers a massive cultural chain reaction that commences a robust dialog and positive change. He's obviously got a solid sense of ethics governing his conscience and a sense of reason guiding his thought process. His sense of urgency, borne directly out of the horrors of what we all saw on 9-11,compelled him to bring this discussion to the public forum! He is right that our ancient \\"prophecy\\" could be self-fulfilling if we believe in it enough. If the results of the last election are any indication, apparently the \\"sheeple\\" of this country believe just that!  <br /> <br />What I believe we will find on the other side of that doomsday scenario is a potential of humanity utterly and regrettably squandered along with a gruelling hardship that very few of us would care to try to endure. As for all those who would surely perish in that prophetically inspired mayhem, once again, we will have no clue to what awaits their \\"souls\\" on the other side and once again, we'll just be left to forge new myths or create new realities. We will have poisoned the womb of this terrestrial ball, set our science and technology back for decades or even centuries and hurled ourselves off the social ladder to resume our role as a clamoring horde of savages desperately trying to survive...and no doubt clinging to our hope for God(s) to save us! <br />
B000274THQ|5.0|If you've ever had a burning desire to see a German-language comedy centering around the collapse of communism in the Eastern Bloc, Good Bye, Lenin just may be the answer to your prayers. This is one of those rare movies that succeed on all levels, as it's hilarious at some points and genuinely effecting at others, all incorporated into some of the most important historical events of our time.  Director Wolfgang Becker pulls off this deceptively difficult trick with an effortless charm that's hard to find on either side of the Atlantic, as he does little more than examine the reactions of ordinary people placed in extraordinary circumstances.  It's hard to think of a movie I've seen lately that's brought together as many disparate elements as seamlessly as this one.<br /><br />While Good Bye, Lenin is somewhat of a one-joke movie, that joke is far funnier and more original than just about anything else you'll see these days.  When Alex Kerner's mother sees him being taken off by cops during a protest in the final days of East Germany, she promptly has a heart attack and goes into an eight-month coma.  By the time she awakes Germany is one country again and loads of new consumer goods are flooding the East.  Normally one would have a hard time figuring out what the problem is with a flood of cheap new goods (there's even more than one brand of pickles now), but since Alex's mother has been devoted to the socialist state ever since her husband headed west and never came back, Alex fears that the shock of this brave new world could bring on another attack.  Since this next attack could finish her for good, Alex goes to every length imaginable to hide the truth from his bedridden mother, which isn't easy as the former East Germany has suddenly become a much more colorful place.  Not to mention, his sister Ariane, a single mother who's given up her studies for a position at a brand-new Burger King, isn't always on board with the plan.  Alex's devotion is certainly heartwarming, but it's also extremely stubborn and a bit crazy, and the unusual nature of Alex's commitment is the basis for much of the movie's humor.<br /><br />This ingenious plot device paves the way for what's easily one of the most intelligent and insightful movies to come along in a while.  There are plenty of laughs to be had as Alex's put-on becomes ever more elaborate, but the movie also has a lot to say about the way people deal with change, especially since change effects different people in different ways.  By focusing in on one family's undoubtedly unique experiences during this tumultuous period, Good Bye, Lenin provides insight into the colossal shock of communism's collapse at the same time as it gives the whole event a human dimension.  It's this combination of historical scope (even in dealing with events that happened a mere 15 years ago) and minute detail that makes this such an intriguing movie.  Becker's directon is constantly shifting tone from lighthearted to deadly serious, but it never stops focusing on the heavy emotional stakes involved in trying to maintain an entire vision of the world that no longer exists.  Good Bye, Lenin isn't just a period piece, or a family drama, or a comedy; it's all of the above wrapped into one.  And it doesn't hurt that the Russian nurse who becomes Alex's love interest is just about the hottest woman alive.<br /><br />Anyway, as capitalism continues making inroads and it becomes increasingly tough for Alex to hide the truth from his mother, he finds himself forced to construct a whole alternate reality, complete with fabricated newscasts explaining why there are so many Coke signs and westerners in \\"East Germany\\" now.  And the more Alex manipulates reality, the more attached he grows to the idealized notions that socialism represented.  The real East Germany may have been a dull, drab place, but the East Germany Alex creates for his mother is a paragon of community and opportunity, a place where people will eventually come searching for a more meaningful life.  Since communism was always more about idealism than realism anyway, it's not too hard for Alex to deceive his mother about the collapse of her beloved State.  He just shows her what she wants to see.<br /><br />Although I can't give it away, even the ending to this movie is surprisingly satisfying, even if it is a bit too sympathetic to socialism for this libertarian's taste.  It's not quite what you might be given to expect, but since Good Bye, Lenin is one decidedly unconventional movie maybe that's as it should be.  At any rate, if you're outgrowing Adam Sandler movies but you're not quite pretentious enough for the indie scene, Good Bye, Lenin is more than worth the two hours of your time.  While it doesn't contain the level of action I often like to see in a movie, it's more than impressive enough to get by without it.ll eventually come searching for a more meaningful life.

B000687M48|2.0|I was very let down by this album. I don't know who did the clean up on these songs but it stinks. You can certainly tell it's a live recording - half the time you can't even hear the band over the shrill screams of audience members. I own several other live albums and have not noticed this problem in them.  <br /> <br />For example, Sarah McLachlan's live album \\"Mirrorball\\". While there are some sounds from the audience at the beginings of the songs, you can actually HEAR the songs once they start. Not the case with this. At times you can't hear the band playing, others you can just bearly hear Amy Lee singing, and almost constantly is the shrill, annoying screams of the audience, which personally, I find very distracting.  <br /> <br />They should have done a bit more editing of this before putting it out. If you're trying to complete your Evanescence collection, this is probably something you'll want but as far as for the sheer entertainment for listening to, stick to \\"Fallen\\".
B00008CLOA|5.0|THIS ALBUM DRAK SIDE OF THE MOON IS TIMELESS A ALL TIME CLASSIC! THIS SHOULD BE IN EVERYONES COLLECTION! THANKS PINK FLOYD FOR A GREAT ALBUM!
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|Like many of you, I was entranced by the bright and eclectic song \\"take me out\\" the very first time I heard it. Not as moody as the shins, and not as cocky as the strokes (hey, i made a sexual innuendo), Franz Ferdinand are one of the brightest spots in the recent deluge of \\"retro\\" pop bands. While I know they don't fit into the \\"emo\\" label (which is a stupid label anyway), I still categorize them with bands like The Anniversary, Get Up Kids, and Sunny Day Real Estate...although more pop oriented. Still, FF brings me back to my teenage years of the early 80s -- before the hair bands and grunge took over, when artists attempted to write catchy, edgy tunes that stood out. FF sound like some of the post-punk bands of the late 70's, before many of the syth bands got popular. While I think they sound like a more peppy version of the band And Also the Trees, they definitely have a similar sound to the Clash, and at times, Joy Division. But again, happier.<br /><br />I actually picked up the import version of the album, with the additional 5-song disk, which includes a great extended version of 'this fire' and 4 new songs. Worth getting.
B00004WLXZ|5.0|Leni Riefenstahl's 1934 cinematic masterpiece \\"Triumph of the Will\\" still stands as an archetype of extraordinarily successful political propaganda. Made to capture the pageantry of the massive Nazi Party rally held in Nuremberg, just one year after Adolf Hitler rose to power through the office of chancellor, this film is also an important historical document. \\"Triumph of the Will\\" is a snapshot of a Germany arising out of the post-World War I malaise, a Germany preoccupied with installing a new system National Socialist government while preparing to spread its influence, not necessarily military influence at this point, far beyond its borders. Barely a whisper of anti-Semitism appears anywhere in the film, nor are there grandiose proclamations about subjecting huge swaths of Europe to Nazi rule. Riefenstahl's film appears to serve as a sort of introduction of the new German leaders to the rest of the world, as well as a paean to the wholesome, unifying effects of National Socialism on the German people. Of course, we know what happened just five years after the filming of \\"Triumph of the Will.\\" It is, therefore, extremely difficult to watch this film without a prejudiced eye.<br /><br />The first thing that strikes the viewer while watching the film is its beauty. Riefenstahl's film begins by showing the city of Nuremberg from Hitler's airplane as it prepares to land. What a beautiful place! The bird's eye view of the city is breathtaking, filled with images of majestic structures that evoke memories of quaint Old European landscapes that seemed to disappear for decades after the destruction caused by World War II. Even better are the numerous marches through the city streets, not because the actors involved are particularly interesting but because the camera often drifts away from the people to capture wondrous images of German architecture and artwork. The statues alone are superb. As weird as it sounds, \\"Triumph of the Will\\" reinforced my hope that I will one day visit Europe even if most of what we see here is long gone. You definitely don't need to condone what the Nazis did in any way, shape, or form to appreciate parts of Riefenstahl's film on a purely aesthetic level. It's too bad that the majority of \\"Triumph of the Will\\" focuses on the rather mundane aspects of National Socialist party politics.<br /><br />Speeches form the crux of Riefenstahl's picture--lots and lots of speeches from lots and lots of Nazi party officials. The usual rogues appear here from time to time, including Martin Bormann, Josef Goebbels, Hermann Goring, Rudolf Hess, Reinhard Heydrich, Heinrich Himmler, Erich Raeder, and Julius Streicher. It is the last official, Streicher, that probably comes closest to articulating the centrality of racism to the Nazi philosophy in a speech about the importance of racial purity. Streicher, later sentenced to death at the Nuremberg trials, was the Gauleiter of Upper Franconia. But it was his role as editor of the notorious anti-Semitic rag Der Sturmer that carried his influence far beyond the end of World War II. Most of the speeches avoid Streicher's charged remarks, focusing instead on the importance of an ascendant Germany and the unity of the German people. Unity is everywhere in \\"Triumph of the Will,\\" from lengthy shots of Germans working together as groups to parades showing different classes of society marching together. Hitler and his cronies continually stress the importance of every individual and his or her place in the larger country, from the farmers to the children to the military. One important sequence shows individual Germans shouting out the names of their home regions, thus showing how all parts of Germany support the new regime.<br /><br />\\"Triumph of the Will\\" is obviously a controversial film. Riefenstahl, who recently died at the ripe age of 101, bore a heavy burden for her National Socialist propaganda pieces right up to the end of her life. Critics accused her of glorifying a regime that started a war resulting in the deaths of tens of millions of people. In many respects, these critics score solid hits. No one who could read can deny that Hitler and his henchmen advocated war and organized murder as legitimate political tools even before the NSDAP came to power. \\"Mein Kampf\\" lays out Hitler's views on government and the Jews in no uncertain terms, and that book arrived on the scene years before the Nazis took over the German government. The aforementioned Julius Streicher's views on Jews were both vicious and well known long before Riefenstahl made her films. Der Sturmer began publication in 1923, according to Randall Bytwerk's incisive study of Streicher's career, and it leveled attacks against Jews almost from the beginning. How could Riefenstahl claim ignorance of the real agenda of Nazi leaders? I think a possible answer, if there is one, lies in the fact that her films came out at the beginning of Nazi rule, before the war and before the genocidal campaigns tarnished the heady early years when recovery from the shame of Versailles and the reemergence of Germany as a European power seemed pure and relatively harmless.<br /><br />The debate over whether Leni Riefenstahl was a loyal Nazi or a dispassionate observer will rage forever. Her talents as a filmmaker, however, are abundantly clear. The extras included on the DVD are definitely worth a watch and a listen. A commentary track by historian Anthony Santoro provides a wealth of information on the subtle themes in the film as well as background on the obscure party officials appearing in the film. A Riefenstahl short film, \\"Day of Freedom,\\" captures a German military exercise staged for the benefit of thousands of citizens. Thanks to the folks over at Synapse Films for bringing this controversial film to DVD.gime that started a war resulting in the deaths of tens of millions of people.

B00028HBKM|3.0|If you enjoyed Stanley Kubrick's ClockWork Orange, you'll like this film. It was nothing more than a long winded film of the good old \\"Ultra Violence\\". Yes, it was anti-Semitic, or biblically accurate whatever suits your religion, whether you're a Jew or a Christian or if you're into that sort of thing. I viewed the movie for its face value which was nothing more than a mere long video of Jesus getting his A** kicked, which was not only unrealistic because the frail actor that they chose for the movie would have collapsed within the first thirty minutes of the brutal beating he was receiving. The most interesting character in the film was Satan who was portrayed by Rosalinda Celentano who just kept lurking around in the background with those eerie androgynous looks. However with all the hype about this movie, it is a must see, and that's why I waited until it was in the video stores because I already knew what to expect.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|I am one of (the millions of) Iron Maiden's die-hard fans. This was the album that actually got me into Iron Maiden. Yes!! I am a late comer but was instantly enslaved by the magic of the Beast!! This album is truely a musical masterpiece. Iron Maiden's masterpieces have always been extremely drawn out, long songs (think \\"Hallowed Be Thy Name\\", \\"Rime Of The Ancient Mariner\\"). We have not one but two drawn-out songs on this album-\\"Dream Of Mirrors\\" and \\"Blood Brothers\\"-and what great songs they are!! <br />Iron Maiden return to true form with the return of Bruce Dickinson and Adrian Smith. They were under enormous pressure to prove themselves. Any other band would have chickened-out and died. But not Iron Maiden!! With this masterpiece, they once again prove that they are the hallowed Gods of Heavy Metal-full of eternal youth!! <br />If you are an Iron Maiden fan-new or old, you will definitely cherish this album. \\"Brave New World\\" is one of the best heavy metal albums of all time-period. Go get your copy NOW!!
B00069FLC2|4.0|I have been a Shadows fan from thier beginning, and I was over  <br />the moon when I heard about this dvd, I could not wait to see it <br />Hank, Bruce and Brian never sounded better and Mark playing great <br />bass, and Cliff playing just the right amount of keyboards. <br />The only thing I did not like was the sound mix with the audience <br />not enough length in applause, and the few close up shots they <br />looked bored, the producers really messed this part up, after all <br />this was the final tour. I would suggest they watch the Paul <br />McCartney dvd Back In The USA. Apart from that great dvd. <br />P.S. I still play my STRAT.
B00004T9UF|5.0|Eminem is the best rapper there is. He is very direct and gets complicated which has never been seen in any other rapper. He's just free-spoken like more people should be. The fact that times changes beats, ideas and rhymes their changed to better though some people really just get tangled up with just one Album and expect the same problems and beats which would be dumb and boring you can't go around having the same situations your whole life. And by the way Vanilla Ice sucks he had his time long ago and only had one hit. so he should get ready to lay in his coffin and shut the hell up though he's not dead yet, he is dead to the music world. My favorite songs would include Stan, The Way I am, I'm Back, Marshall Mathers, Drug Ballad and Criminal. Obviously my main 2 are Marshall Mathers and The Way I Am. <br />2. Kill You (Pretty Funny, and unique) <br />3. Stan (Great song with contradictions, like Guilty C.) <br />5. Who Knew (yes, who would of known) <br />6. Steve Berman (Skit) (extremely funny, never heard any other skit as funny as this one) <br />7. The Way I Am (great song and very straight forward) <br />8. The Real Slim Shady (funny and energetic) <br />9. Remember Me (good to go around threatening people but still a good song) <br />10. I'm Back (just funny) <br />11. Marshall Mathers (love it, for it's honesty and how circumstances are the ones that change, not the people) <br />13. Drug Ballad  (good to listen to in a club) <br />15. Bitch Please II (good set of rhymes) <br />16. Kim  (very strange but good lyrics with contradictions again) <br />18. Criminal (very funny) <br /> <br />This album was very listened to when I was in 10th grade and I still hear people play it and I still do so sometimes as well. I wouldn't really tell you to go out and buy it cuz in reality you should been have it.
B000001DTM|5.0|This is the crown jewel of the U2 collection. \\"Achtung Baby\\" is so far and above any other U2 album that it is difficult to put into words. Hundreds of people have tried here in Amazon, and while some have done justice to this recording, it really needs to be heard to be appreciated. \\"Love is Blindness\\" may very well be their best song ever, but \\"Ultra Violet (Light My Way)\\" is an event every time I listen to it. You could spend $50 on this album and feel like you have committed a crime of theft. Buy this album, period.

B000067J1H|4.0|A bracing, mesmerizing, bitterly funny and deeply unsettling fable about disaffected, emotionally emasculated young men whose search for meaning leads straight to their inner bare-knuckle brawler. Fight Club is the brain child--make that brainless, testosterone-fueled gut child--of scruffy wild boy Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) and a nameless, insomniac cubicle slave (Edward Norton). They meet on a plane, bond over the coincidence that they're carrying the exact same briefcase (though Tyler's is full of the chi-chi soap he sells to high-end boutiques, while our office peon's bag is packed with papers.) A freak accident blows our protagonist's tastefully appointed apartment to kingdon come and propels him first into Tyler's pestilent house on the industrial side of town, and then into a bloody, sweaty journey of self-discovery that never goes quite where you think it's going. Faithfully adabted from Chuck Palahniuk's novel, Fincher's film is a brilliantly realized series of sucker punches, a philosophical howl disguised as a muscular guy movie. Neither Palahniuk nor Fincher is onto anything new: The plight of the post-feminist, post-war generation of men without fathers, coming-of-age rituals or meaningful jobs launched the Iron John movement and keeps an army of therapists in clover. But Palahniuk nails the searing alienation and directs it into something simultaneously horrifying and logical (not for nothing is he regularly campared to J.G. Ballard); in his hands Fight Club and its successor, the anarchic Project Mayhem, seem perfectly reasonable alternatives to spiritual suicide. One expense report at a time. Fincher translates Palahniuk's muscular prose into viscerally powerful images as fresh and invigorating as they are profoundly disturbing. He also gives Pitt and Norton the room to deliver what may be the best performances of their careers to date; Helena Bonham Carter, Meat Loaf and Jared Leto are equally striking in supporting roles.
B000000IW9|5.0|All I will say is that \\"Estranged\\" is the best GNR creation as far as I am concerned. \\"Civil War\\" is amazing and so is \\"Dont Cry\\" (this version is even better)...
B00003CXCT|5.0|After not seeing these movies since the 70's and 80's, I was reluctant to taint my memory by revisiting them.  However I was pleasantly surprised!  All three are better than I remembered.  The \\"controversy\\" people speak of is nonsense.  If there are indeed \\"changes,\\" rest assured they're unnoticeable to the average viewer.    A worthwhile purchase if you fancy a journey to a galaxy far, far, away....
B00008HCCF|1.0|Poor sound mix.  instruments same volume as vocals.  Vocals get lost and are hard to stand out thru the music.  Its like listening to the music in a tunnel with very poor accoustics.  Hopefully I can find a better sounding Norah Jones DVD since this one sounds so bad.  But based on the ratings this one has I would question if we have the same DVD.  We do, yet the average rating is four out of five for a DVD with this poor of accoustics.
B0002DRDBE|4.0|Very funny movie.  Definitely hits a chord with the younger generation.  Great use of low-budget filmmaking techniques.  An inspiration to anyone wanting to break into Hollywood.
0380778556|5.0|i adore this book. the young new bride and all her hesitations, which we all occasionally feel, and the jealousy that we know, that we think we know when we can never catch up with perfection, especially when that perfect is dead. each scene is beautifully constructed, even the conversations which seem dull but simmer with tension. the poor mrs dewinter, gauche, insecure, desperately in love, without the confidence to believe that her new husband loves her... dumarier managed to get everything right in a way which she does not achieve with her other books.
B00006879E|5.0|Ok, first let me start off by saying that I pretty much consider myself a rock fan. And I too find myself pissed off at MTV for releasing crappy, packaged garbage. And, as a musician I am apalled by the horrendous musicianship of many of the bands they show. And yes, I too know my \\"underground\\" music, and no, I'm not some sissy pop music fanatic(my favorite bands are Rush, DT, Pink Floyd, Porcupine Tree, and Pain of Salvation.) <br /> <br />All of those things are ammunition that some people are using against Maroon 5 it seems. Because they are sucsessful, some people are quick to stereotype them. Theres much more to them then some people would see. Musicianship? Excellent. Lyrics? Well, I don't hold these in as high a regard as most people, but they certaintly don't ruin any songs.  <br /> <br />This isn't to say that if you gave this cd a bad raiting you are \\"wrong.\\" If you listened to the CD and honestly didn't like it then more power to yah. I'm just mad at people who don't give the CD the chance it deserves, and give it 1 star without even listening. <br /> <br />Anyways...enough with that, on to the CD itself. <br /> <br />On songs of Jane, Maroon 5 has provided a nice breath of fresh air. They blend Funk with pop/rock in ways that I havn't heard before. I'd been sooo locked up in some of my heavier music, and with pure Jazz that upon first I just felt completly refreshed. The musicianship on this album may put off some of the pop fans though...it is actually surprisingly complex, which is something that has tended not to go over well with the pop-fans. <br /> <br />As far as some of the complaints go: <br /> <br />Vocals - No, their singer isn't Justin Timberlake. Few people in the world are. I highly doubt the singer chose to sound like JT, so don't slam him. He does his job, and he does it pretty well. <br /> <br />Repetitiveness - Hehe, I don't hear it personally. Every song adds something new to the mix. Some songs can be compared to others, but thats tobe expected. <br /> <br />Anyways...if you are a fan of funk then you probably will like this album. If you are a pop fan, looking for catchy music, yah might like it, yah might not. If you like it, you will love it. If you are a rock fan, and approach this album with an open mind, you will probably like it. And, lastly, if, like me, you are someone who is CONSTANTLY looking for music you havn't heard before, and spend a great deal of time trying EVERY type of music you come across from, from flamenco to jazz to pop to metal, then you probably will walk away from this album feeling very satisfied.

B00005JLEX|5.0|Well now that I have bought the first 2 volums and watched them all, I can say that it is amazing.  The sound and picture are great.  The 'Notes about Nothing' for every show is very cool, the first time I ever saw this feature.  The Kramer vs. Kramer feature was so amazing, no wonder the whole cast loved Michael R.  The bloopers are just great, and there are lots of them.  Alot of the shows have introduction about specific shows told by the cast and production team, on how the story came about or things that happened when shooting, which is another great feature.  And finally the commentaries are great.  Oh yes, the fact that it is original length episodes is another great feature, it is amazing to see how much TV cuts from the reruns today.  Looking forward to season 4 and up.
B00005JMAH|3.0|really a shame. this should have been the best one so far, it has the best plot. but instead of the wit and the dialogue we got actors looking serious and lots of music to substitute for the development of their emotions
B00065GX64|5.0|I have always had the greatest respect for this film, ever since I first saw it in a blurry print almost 30 years ago. I've acquired no less than four versions over the years: an early VHS dub, the much better Janus Collection VHS version, the still better first Criterion version, and now this one. I have to say that this new version is a tremendous accomplishment. M was a very early sound film, and was shot in a peculiar, almost square, non-standard aspect ratio, and every version prior to this one had technical problems dealing with it, as I understand it, to some extent because many of the existing prints chopped of the top of the frame. This restoration is presented exactly as it was filmed, and it is breathtaking. Lang made great use of every bit of the frame, which can be appreciated now like never before.  <br /> <br />While they were at it, the restorers did amazing things with the soundtrack. It is vastly clearer. If you understand German, you will hear things you never heard before, and if you don't, you still benefit from the improved subtitling (the subtitlers heard things they hadn't heard before, too). <br /> <br />If you have the previous Criterion version, don't hesitate for a second to acquire this one as well. It is a revelation.
0446677450|5.0|Before reading this book, I had no answer to the question why the children of rich parents are rich and the descendants of poor people are poor, and why poverty is eternal while broke is temporary. I didn't know why rich persons quickly recover from bankruptcy while poor people even winning millions in a lottery sooner or later revert to the poverty again. <br /> <br />This is the first book I ever read that clearly and briefly provides the response to the question. What differs rich from poor is not how they earn their money but how do they spend their money. Rich people spend all the money on money-generating assets, and the rest is kept for luxury like big houses or nice cars. Luxury is merely a reward for a high cash flow from the assets. Not enough money comes from the assets - no luxurious toys. Poor is the opposite - they buy liabilities like a big house and a powerful car which besides mortgage and credit payments require a big sum of money to upkeep them. Thus the poor class is always in debt and is deprived of money required to purchase the sources of income. <br /> <br />The most of the case vignettes of the book are fiction, and the author warns not to follow them literally but to use them as a source of inspiration and imagination and always use your own brain and your own judgment. Do not treat this book as the author's biography, as it may have seemed so. When I read a chapter about the childhood of mr. Kiyosaki and his  next-door playmate, Mike, I've found so much interest, stimulation, liveliness and variety in this section that I've instantly realized that it is a literary work of imagination. <br /> <br />Because of the author's excessive mixture of real names and thought out cases, some people may conclude that mr. Kiyosaki is trying to trick or deceive them (e.g. \\"John T. Reed's analysis of Robert T. Kiyosaki's book Rich Dad, Poor Dad\\"). Please do not think this way about \\"Rich Dad Poor Dad\\", just treat it as a solid non-fiction framework with fiction illustrations.
B00067BBQE|1.0|I enjoy Evanescence; they do have some great songs. I'm interested in whether or not they can pull off another successful recording. I doubt it, but time will tell.<br /><br />The DVD is horrible. Quite seriously, if one is prone to seizures, you'll have one watching this performance. The editing never allows the viewer a chance to focus on the performance or the performers. I had to turn away numerous times just to prevent my brain from exploding.<br /><br />This DVD is more of a MTV video than a live concert. If the DVD was only the length of one song, I would have said, \\" It was neat. Overdone, but fun.\\" But for all their songs, it just hurt.<br /><br />There are times the sound track is completely out of sync with the video.<br /><br />I own many live performances and this one is one of the worst.
0375805621|5.0|We love to read \\"The Monster at the End of This Book\\" and when I came across \\"Another Monster at the End of This Book\\", I was very excited.  As soon as we recieved it I sat down to read it to my daughter (22 months).  It was a instant hit!  My daughter has always brought me \\"The Monster...\\" to read to her at least 6 times a day and now she makes sure to grab them both when she wants me to read to her.  That is not a problem for me since I find both of these books to be very cute.
B000244EMO|5.0|Predator, in my opinion is the best action/sci-fi movie ever made. It was made in 1987, but looks like it was made in the late 90's. I don't own Predator on any verison, but I've seen enough to know its great. This is how the story runs down: <br />Arnold and his band of comanndos infiltrate Central America to look for lost soldiers. They get into a few battles with gurilleas but soon find out their friends are dead and skinned alive. And then of course they find out, they're not alone(besides other gurilleas). An alien form a different planet has come to earth to hunt worthy opponents for sport.It has all sorts of weapons and its invisible. It also has infared vision(which looks really cool form the Predator's point of view). Arnold's squad then gets picked off one-by-one by an unknown foe. First Hawkins gets slaughtered, blood everywhere(especially on some hostage woman form the country). He's dragged away into the trees and later his friends find nothing but a gory torso(if that). Next Ventura(thw white guy with the gatling gun) gets killed, something goes right thorugh him and he dies. After that Mr. Rambo (with black hair) stays ont his bridge type thing to comfront the Predator(slashing this chest as a sign of toughness). All you hear is a scream and hes finished. The other two black guys go out to hunt the beast. One gets shot in the head from the Predator's triangular beam, falls and blood just pours all over the ground, dripping off his face). The skinnier balck guy is caught out in the open. The Predator uses his beam and knocks off the guys arm. He yells and watches the Preadtor jump from the tree, run towards him while takin out his metal claws, and just stabs him right in the stomach. That leaves Arnold left (am i forgetting anyone?). He sits up in a tree, preparing his traps, and waits for the Predator. Finally he comes and Arnold gets the crap beaten out of him until the end, which yopu'lkl have to watch for urself it you never saw it. <br />      Overall, Predator is the supreme guy film of our time. Nothing has beaten it in its genre and nothing probably ever will. Predator remains as one of my favorite movies of all time. Non-stop action from beginning to end. Without Predator, your collection isn't full.  <br />
B00000DHR0|5.0|I think Celine Dion's Christmas album is perfect for the times.  Oddly, I play it even when it isn't Christmas.  Each song is lovely.  I'm only saddened by the fact that she went \\"Las Vegas.\\"  But I don't want to get started on that subject.  It's Christmas time and I can truly enjoy the season with this beautiful selection by Celine.
B0001LJCPC|4.0|OK, so you've seen the movie, you have the DVD, why buy the soundtrack too? Because many of the songs are so good you don't want to have to watch the whole movie to hear them again, that's why! <br />I rarely buy soundtracks. They are usually just filled with snippets of songs and a lot of unrewarding crap. But Kill Bill Vol. 2 is different. There are so many interesting and unusual songs featured in the movie that owning the sountrack is a necessary adjunct to the movie for those whose musical tastes are wide-ranging. When I saw the movie, Chingon's Malaguena Salerosa is the song that told me to order the soundtrack. <br />That song is not the only reason to buy this of course. There is so much more to enjoy. I really like Goodnight Moon, Tu Mira, A Satisfied Mind, About Her, and Urami Bushi as well. And each of those songs is different from one another as day is from night. Of course, there are some great instrumentals too. I've always liked Ennio Morricone's work, but my favorite here is Luis Bacalov's Summertime Killer. And let's not forget the unlisted rap song that closes out the CD. I never cared for rap, but that one is at least palatable, even enjoyable! <br />A few dialogues unnecessarily littered about knock a star off this. If you liked the film and you like the music, there is no good reason not to own the CD. Add the Kill Bill Vol II soundtrack to your CD collection soon!
B00005LC4B|4.0|I really liked Cape Fear.  DeNiro is amazing as always, the man cannot go wrong in my book.  Nick Nolte, Jessica Lange and Juliet Lewis all do great jobs.
B00005OAIE|1.0|I too can't understand how anybody likes this guy.  I first heard him on ACL as well, and thought \\"what is he saying???\\"  I couldn't (and still can't) understand a word that he sings.  It wasn't until I heard a DJ say \\"Your Body Is Wonderland\\" that I could figure out the title of that song.  Then I saw him on a PBS special and admit... he's an awesome guitarist.  But I can't get over his horrible mumbling voice, and the fact that his stage presence... oh dear... he's soooo hard to even look at with his goofy facial expressions (is he in pain?  passing gas?  I can't tell) and his awkward mannerisms.  That makes trying to understand the lyrics even more difficult. <br />I guess he's either a love-him-or-hate-him kind of performer based on what I read here.  I have to give him a thumbs down.
B000000LZV|4.0|Who were the Minutemen? Were they punks? Were they beatniks? Were they a hippie jam band masquerading as 80's hardcore? Quite simply, the Minutemen where the Minutemen. In the synth-laden 80's it was refreshing to hear a good old three plus one band. The clever hooks, sing/speak lyrics and excellent musicianship are definitive of a good three piece. These guys defied punk by having the balls to incorporate all of their musical influences into their sound and not pander to the strict conservative rule book of early hardcore punk, much like Bad Brains did. Jazz, blues, classic rock, funk, bluegrass, hints of country and driving punk make up the core of their sound, which go on to influence bands like the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Sublime and Jane's Addiction. <br /> <br />As to be expected, the Minutemen are hated by many who feel they are not punk enough, or angry enough. Who's to say punks need to be narrow-minded about their music? Greg Ginn of Black Flag took much of his musical inspiration from Black Sabbath, the Stooges and Led Zeppelin rather than the Ramones or the Germs. Ian McKaye of Minor Threat/Fugazi claims his two biggest influences are Jimi Hendrix and *gasp!* Ted Nugent. The reason the Minutemen where doing what they did is because they where sick of the elitist punks who flat out said \\"no\\" to anything with more than three chords and a sense of musicality. Mike Watt grew up on all forms of American contemporary music, who's to say he can't throw it in the mix? His outstanding bass chops more than warrant this. <br /> <br />This all makes for a highly enjoyable listen. I highly recommend the Minutemen.
0440241413|4.0|This is one of those fast and fun reads that is great for travelling or beach reading. The adventures of the financially-challenged Becky Bloomwood are funny, and I think most of us can identify just a tiny bit with her unquenchable desire to shop. Much like the Bridget Jones books, this book kind of makes you feel better about your own life as you read about someone who makes all the mistakes and blunders that you fear to make. I look forward to reading the subsequent Shopaholic books.
B0000AM6LY|4.0|With hits like \\"Holding back the years\\", \\"Money too tight to mention\\" and \\"Stars\\", Simply Red a.k.a. Mick Hucknall established a reputation as one of the best blue-eyed British pop/soul artists of the 80s and 90s. Yet, the band reached a musicall lull in the latter half of the 90s with forgettable albums like \\"Love and the Russian Winter\\". Considering their track record with the last few albums, it would be difficult to have any expectations from \\"Home\\". No one would have guessed that Simply Red was yet to unveil one of their finest albums ever and the best single of their career - \\"Sunrise\\". The other highlights of the album include \\"You make me feel brand new\\" (a cover of the Stylistics) and \\"Something for you\\". I hope Mick Hucknall is able to continue with his renewed musical streak for years to come.<br /><br />Songs for the casual listener: Sunrise<br />Songs for the Simply Red fan: Home, Something for you, It's you, You make me feel brand new and SUNRISE!!!!
B0002Y69NG|3.0|This is addressed to the guy who said this was the \\"Penultimate Set!!!\\" Apparently he thinks penultimate is some superior form of ultimate. Well, my friend, penultimate actually means \\"next to last.\\" Before you use a word, look it up in the dictionary. When you use a word incorrectly, all of your subsequent opinions become less valid.
B000002JOH|5.0|When I first purchased this album in 1992, I rate this album a classic alongside Slayer's 'Reign In Blood' and Metallica's 'Master Of Puppets'. The riff itself from none other than Mr. Darrel 'Dimebag' Abbott already inspired countless of millions followers. Inspired the whole so-called-nu-metal movement alongside with Helmet. <br /> <br />...until one looser took Dimebag's life on stage on December 8 2004. <br /> <br />Rest In Peace, Darrell Abbott, you will be missed...you're among the heroes now....
B000089CJI|3.0|if this is not a rebirth of the Whitetown album Women in Technology i don't know what is. This cd was brought more upt to date and the synthesis was great but the last thing that IDM really needs is pop vocalists. Overall i give it 3 stars for the background.
B00005J6UP|4.0|I've recently seen this film again, after almost 20 years and I still like it very much. Despite some silly jokes, I found myself almost crying at the end (don't laugh!) and thinking \\"Oh my God! I want to be a child again!\\". This is a great movie, especially for the ones that, like me, had their childhood at the 80's. If you like CGI-based movies like Harry Potter, then this movie is not for you. \\"The Goonies\\" relies on real acting (like Sloth, I love Chunk). I think it is very well-succeeded in trying to create a childhood atmosphere.  The music also helps to create that atmosphere. <br />The two things that I didn't like on this DVD is some rough editing towards the end of the movie, which I didn't remember and the commentary feature, featuring a very sarcastic Corey Feldman. I don't know how Donner let this stay on the DVD.
B0006399FS|4.0|I have been a fan of U2 since I was 14 and I heard New Year's Day for the first time.  I have continued to enjoy them through the evolution of their sound and through their many attempts to reinvent themselves over the years.  The only release I was disappointed with was All You Can't Leave Behind.  This release is a step back to minimalism, which is nice for a change. <br /> <br />This is no frills U2. Vertigo is a fast-paced, rocking opener, which showcases the Edge and Adam Clayton's traditional, solid guitar blend that we all love.  The second song, Miracle Drug, is a beautiful song and will remind one of The Joshua Tree.   <br /> <br />I think the best, most emotional song, is the third song, Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own.  This song is about Bono's relationship with his dad, who passed away in 2001, and it will resonate with anyone who has a difficlut relationship with their father/mother: \\"Its you when I look in the mirror/Its you when I don't pick up the phone/Sometimes you can't make it on your own.\\"  You can feel the remorse and heartbreak in Bono's voice.  It will take a few plays to grow on you, but by the 5th-6th time you can hear the Unforgettable Fire and The Joshua Tree, and I defy anyone to not love this song.   <br /> <br />Another great song is All Because of You.  This one will remind you of Even Better Than the Real Thing from Achtung.  The lyrics are great here. \\"I like the sound of my own voice/I didn't give anyone else a choice/An intellectual tortoise/Racin' with your bullet train...All because of you, I am.\\" <br /> <br />One Step Closer is buried at song 9, but this song, which appears very bare musically, is actually a beautiful song very deep with maturity and perspective.  It's simply Edge's lone guitar and Bono's singing. <br /> <br />The reason I give it 4 out of 5 is that it does not strike you throughout like the Joshua Tree or Achtung, two incredibly different albums, but which literally did not contain a mediocre song onthem. If you thought All That You Can't Leave Behind was a disappointment or just too mediocre, I think you will like How to Dismantle an Atmoic Bomb more.  If you, however, are one of the many who seem to demand nothing less from the band than complete perfection, you are going to be disappointed.  If you give them a break and give yourself a chance to let this one grow on you for a few days, I think you'll like it a lot. <br /> <br />
0060925000|4.0|When I told my mother I was reading Vikram Seth's A Suitable Boy, the first thing she said was \\"Vikram Seth? Isn't he that pretentious guy who wrote a whole novel in iambic pentameter?\\" Although my mother was slightly mistaken - The Golden Gate was actually written in tetrameter - she has a point about Seth's pretentiousness. <br /> <br />I suppose it takes a man of no small pretentions to write, and beyond that actually get printed, what is purportedly the longest novel ever published in the English language. Not only do you have to overcome the dependable aversion of publishers to anything longer than a novella, but you also have to convince yourself that people are actually going to like your work enough to suffer through it for 1500 pages. Somehow, I doubt that Seth worried to much about that. And to think, they say he cut another 600 pages! <br /> <br />I further suppose that it would be difficult to write so long a novel without leaving large chunks of yourself littered across its wordscapes. Seth certainly does so. In a strange way, after reading this book, I feel I know Mr. Seth personally. His knowledge of India is as vast as the Ganga, his settings are vivid, and his characters are remarkably alive but it is his sense of his own genius that is most palpable of all. In everything from his incessant wordplay, his clear disdain for Tagore, his ventriloquistic analysis of his own ventriloquized poetry, his constant literary name-dropping, and even his use of the most overpowering authorial voice -- third person full omniscient -- Seth himself dominates his novel like a Lord from on high. And why exactly was the table of contents a series of rhymed iambic couplets? Just couldn't help himself, I can only surmise. As riveting as this book was, Seth never let me forget for longer than a chapter or so that I was reading a novel, because somehow he would intrude himself into the fabric of the world he has created. It is a tribute to the magic of the book that I regretted these jolting intrusions as keenly as I did. <br /> <br />If Seth indeed has an inflated sense of his talent, his is not far wrong in his self-assessment. Seth is some kind of genius. A Suitable Boy is brilliant. I couldn't put it down. It made me think about life, the universe, and everything. More than once. It made me want to run out write more poetry and read more books and dream up more fiction. But in the end the work is flawed, marred, if ever so slightly, by Seth's reflexive showmanship instinct, his flailing flair for flash. <br /> <br />And slightly more so by Seth's descent into his novel like a latter-day avatar of Vishnu. One of the characters is undeniably Seth's personal analogue. His history mirrors Seth's, his dialogue is the most direct and least forced, his awkwardnesses are uncomfortably real, and his inner thoughts are the most deeply shrouded of any character. We as readers feel Seth lurking much more closely behind that mask than any of the others. Which character Seth ultimately gives his dream girl away to matters not. We the readers somehow know who the Suitable Boy should have been at the end, even though by rights we shouldn't be so sure. This tainted masterwork deserved a more ambiguous ending.
B00005JNDX|4.0|I thoroughtly enjoyed this movie. It is not rocket science but that's not what I chose this movie for. Bridget's character is not flawless. She is insecure but of good character, overall. Her chosen boyfriend is not terribly exciting but he's good to her/good for her. They genuinely care about each other. That is what is refreshing about this movie.  <br /> <br />I save 5 stars for Gone with the Wind or Polar Express, but this is close.
B0006284JQ|1.0|I didnt listen to the cd and i dont plan on doing it any time soon. This just isnt right, how can anyone release a Best oF cd after only 3 albums(very short albums too). This CD probably has 90% of her songs. This is such a ripoff and britney spears is not an artist. of course her fans will absolutly love this cd
B000050X31|1.0|Having read the rave reviews at Amazon, I spent much more money to purchase this DVD than I normally spend on DVDs. Disappointed and even angered by this DVD, I have given it a one-star rating primarily to tip the balance against a great number of reviews that, I now realize, were not from an especially demanding and/or musically trained audience.<br /><br />I did not expect when buying the DVD that the orchestral performance would rival that of Klemperer. And so I was pleasantly surprised by Levine's spirited and tempo-appropriate--i.e., not in the current, anachronistic style of slow, overtly \\"romantic\\" Mozart conducting--if safe, conducting. The single star is not for Levine.<br /><br />The sung performances and filming--the raison d'etre for a DVD recording, after all--are unacceptable for a DVD of this price and are what merit the low rating.<br /><br />No personal offense, but Ariaza's Tamino is utterly uncharismatic, and his weak projection and faulty German diction never help. He is outshone by Papageno time and time again, and so the story becomes one in which Papageno is the protagonist, Tamino a relatively uninteresting subplot. Serra's Queen is uninspired, forced, and occasionally awkward. While the role is incredibly difficult, half of the battle for the singer must be not to let that difficulty color the performance and acting. Finally, Kurt Moll is sadly off-key and uncomfortable-looking in his roll as Sarastro. He comes across as being far-past prime.<br /><br />As disappointing as the singing is, the filming is absolutely horrible. We are repeatedly and unfathomably given far-away shots that leave the singers looking like tiny, lifeless dolls. Never, ever do we feel that we are front and center. I felt like I had been given the worst tickets in the house, and I felt cheated.<br /><br />I am a classically trained musician who has spent years studying Mozart and who holds a high place in the heavens for this opera, and I am a father of a two-year oldwho wishes to raise his child with a similar appreciation; I bought this DVD for both of us. If you, too, care deeply for this opera, and/or if you want to inspire your children with Mozart, I recommend that you look elsewhere. As I have not viewed any other Magic Flute DVDs, I regret that I cannot provide any recommendations. If you can recommend a better performance, I would be thankful to read your review here. In the meantime, back to reading reviews!
0375507256|5.0|What can I write about this novel that hasn't already been written?  Nothing, but I wanted to voice a high recommendation for this novel because it is so terrific.  I'm an avid reader of fiction, yet I've never read anything like this book.  Ever.  Mitchell uses several genres, a multitude of voices and characters and forms.  I couldn't believe that the same author wrote the 1850s travelogue from the viewpoint of an American actuary also wrote the interview excerpts from the viewpoint of a humanoid hybrid several centuries in the future.  Yet none of this, suprisingly, is off-putting.  I felt completely engulfed by every story, strong enough to stand on its own, and mesmerized by the many levels that these narratives interconnect.  This work of meta-fiction -- or whatever the critics call it -- never feels like a \\"project,\\" never feels forced, never feels like \\"just a writer's trick.\\"  On the contrary, Mitchell writes with a deep compassion for his characters.  It's funny, it's wildly entertaining, yet it also teaches us many things about love, betrayal, violence, compassion, and the nature of culture, society, & humankind.  It's the sort of book that you will want to re-read over and over again.  I highly recommend it!

B0001XAPZ6|5.0|I saw this as young Japanese in Japan when released in 1986. Perhaps this movie astonished me as to what Anime was capable of representing to us. With this \\"Nausicaa\\" Miyazaki's name became unforgettable in Japan, never realizing at the time that the movie would be translated into other languages and be enjoyed by many. I truly believe this movie was the turning point of Anime. Or perhaps the movie was made in such an era. Anime had never been so sophisticated and beautiful before that era.<br /><br />Nausicaa, as it may be typical in Miyazaki's movies, is a character with a high moral standard and capabilities of carrying out the act of helping people and the harmony of all things. If one is Miyazaki's fan, \\"Nausicaa\\" is a must see movie. When Miyazaki started being recognized in the US or other countries, \\"Nausicaa\\" was already an \\"old\\" movie, and that's why it is not as known as the other recent ones, but I know, as a Japanese, that Hayao Miyazaki is and will be always \\"Hayao Miyazaki of Nausicaa\\" no matter how many great movies he has made or will make. \\"Nausicaa\\" was the clue of Japanese Anime going up to a higher level of Art. I do not consider this movie a mere entertainment. This is a work of Art.<br /><br />I need to mention the music in this movie. I think they are wonderful.
B000002U9W|4.0|This is far from PF's best, but it is still a great album.  I've heard that they were consuming a lot of magic mushrooms while recording this album and it shows.  The best song is the Atom Heart Mother Suite, although it may be just too out there for some ears.
076790592X|5.0|<br /> Mitch Albom's Tuesday with Morrie is truly an inspirational piece on all the aspects needed on emotions, feelings, and understanding towards life. Albom brings forth all the essential of a good book based on his visits with Morrie Schwartz, a former sociology professor at Brandeis University who is dying of Lou Gehrig's disease. With each Tuesday visit with Morrie, Mitch was able to capture all the warm understanding, sophistication, and sensitivity of life onto every page that offers hope for the understanding of human strengths and weaknesses experienced during a very difficult time. This book brings forth a philosopher point of view. That when we are born, we are exclusively physical human beings, and during the first year of life, in order to grow up in a natural way, neither afraid or living nor dying, we need a lot of loving, hugging, touching, and physical contact. Then at the end of our life, when we are old Grandmas, and Grandpas living in the back of our children's house, then again the one aspect of our life that we are missing the most is that we are not touched, loved and hugged enough. In our society the only people usually who gives us totally unconditional love were the very old people: Our Grandmas and Grandpas. Tuesdays with Morrie is and will always be one of the most inspiring book I've ever read that teaches us to value each day of our life and to live each life as though it will be our last.
B00000J7A2|5.0|I love Ry Cooder's slide guitar playing on this release, and for me anyway the musicianship on this disc is unrivled by the Captain's later recordings.  I'm a huge fan of the mid-late 60s Mothers of Invention and this disc has a lot of similarities to Zappa's early output. The problem most people have with this album is that the Captain's surrealistic poetry so heavily utilized in his other realeases is downplayed here.  I admit, that's a bummer, but the songs more than make up for it, i especially like\\"Big Black Baby Shoes\\" and \\"Call on Me\\" not to mention the classic \\"Electricity\\"
B0001NBMBC|5.0|come on people, i know they are nothing like they're first album, but all artists change their music over time (just like P.O.D. and some others) You can always go back and listen to their other albums. <br /> <br />In my opinion this is my fav album. songs like (Vermilion, before i forget, danger keep away, and ciricle) are what made this album in my opinion (i dont like duality for some reason) <br /> <br />all bands got to experiment or they'll die out. <br /> <br />Peace,
B000002ACR|5.0|This is the Byrds' finest hour.  The Rickenbacher is in fine form as always, and I've seen a lot of negative reviews of \\"Mind Gardens\\" Now admittedly I smoke a lot of dope, but I think it's a great song. \\"My Back Pages\\" is my second favorite Byrds cover of a Dylan song, second only to \\"You Ain't Going Nowhere.  This entire album is really amazing. The Byrds have many excellent albums but this is just a little better than 5D, making it my favorite Byrds album.
B0000027RL|5.0|This is Pearl Jam at their youngest age, but it's amazing nevertheless - and has proved to be one of the milestones in '90s rock. It has gone down with 'Nevermind' and 'Superunknown' to shape one '90s grunge rock would be, and has proved to be one of the standing albums of '90s, let alone all time. It's amazing, from start to finish, and I don't see how anyone could not enjoy this album to it's fullest. <br /> <br />Every song, literally, is a masterpiece from this album - probably one of the finest albums put out by Pearl Jam, or even any band of the '90s. It starts off with the energetic 'Once', which is quite amazing, actually - and flows into a Pearl Jam timeless classic, Even Flow and Alive, both of which are two of the staples for any Pearl Jam concert to this date. Both have amazing guitar solos - some of the best you'll ever heard coming from this band (you'll see Mike McCready go insane during these solos at a concert, quite amazing). Afterwards, they flow into Why Go, which is a very good song - energetic (all of them have been so far), and really captures Pearl Jam during their 'grunge' era. Now, they start Black - which is still a favorite among most fans of the band, an absolutely classic to many - this is their first slow and acoustic song on the album, and haunts you until the album if finished (and afterwards). Certaintly some of Eddie Vedder's best lyrics and song writing, with Mike McCready delivering some of his greatest work as a guitarist at the end. Then, they start Jeremy - which has been hailed as one of the greatest songs of the '90s (and Pearl Jam's best song), which stills runs chills down my spine - with Eddie Vedder delivering some of his most haunting vocals that I've ever heard. After that, you still have staples for any Pearl Jam concert, and some of their greatest work and work of the '90s - Oceans, Porch, and Release are all amazing songs, and still get sung to this day at Pearl Jam concerts (this concerts are some of the best around, with them being very long and being absolutely amazing). <br /> <br />I would recommend this album to any fan that is starting to find interest in the band - it captures them at their prime, with being the definitive 'grunge' album of the '90s - they since have matured. If anyone is a fan of grunge, or classic rock, I would recommend this album - it's truely amazing, and will start getting you into their more amazing work, that comes latter (especially if you find Black to be your favorite work on the album).
B000089RVR|5.0|When I bought this CD, I liked it straightaway and that got me worried: usually the music that I like fast, I also get tired of, fast. But it wasn't the case with this CD.. it actually grew on me still and now I adore it. <br />Dido's voice is one of those rare ones that are both unique and technically brilliant. She sounds the same in every song - yet different. The emotions in each song are different - and she creates a different soundscape - soulscape - for each, that is utterly breathtaking, capable of lifting you eighty feet above the dullness of the city streets. <br />There is no weak song on this album, but the ones that really shine are: <br /> <br />1. \\"White Flag\\" - beautiful opening, simple but effective lyrics about keeping a person in one's heart after separation <br /> <br />4. \\"Mary's in India\\" - Beautiful tapping sound in the background gives the song a lovely, exotic rhythm. Dido produces some of her most tender vocals ever and elevates everyday, mundane details to some higher plane. <br /> <br />6.  \\"Don't Leave Home\\" - in terms of vocal technique, probably the most brilliant track on the album. What a stirring chorus! \\"and if you're cold, i'll keep you warm/If you're low, just hold on/cos I will be your safety/oh don't leave home\\". I love the way her voice forks up at the end of the word \\"low\\".  <br /> <br />8. \\"Sand in My Shoes\\" - very unique and gorgeous opening. If you play it on a pair of good speakers (especially wood) and stand in between them, you will be amazed at the mesmerizing effect as the sounds bounce between the speakers and the instruments change. My favourite words are \\"to a place where I can watch the sun set and/take my time, take all our time\\". Again, Dido shows the ability to take a very mundane state of things and give a very meditative interpretation vocally. <br /> <br />10. \\"This Land is Mine\\" - woah! Words can't describe this one. Just give it a listen!! Classic Dido. <br /> <br />11. \\"See the Sun\\" - a very relaxed, classy vocal delivery in this song about pain and hope.
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|Michael Jackson is an unequivocal entertainer - perhaps the greatest of all time. The echelon of greatness on which his dance and performance rest may never be again reached in our lifetimes, or those of our children. I have been a fan since I was just five years old. <br /> <br />Even a fan as hardcore as I must, however, admit that Michael Jackson's mental atrophy is progressing at an alarming rate. He is the best musician of our generation(s), but as a man, he is flawed - not all of which is his fault, considering his upbringing.  <br /> <br />But this does not justify denigration of him as a person. Here in America, we believe in innocent until proven guilty, yet some reviewers, as I have read, have already convicted Michael in the court of public opinion. If you have not already been informed, please note that your judgmental hypocrisy is directly opposed to the nature of the American dream, and your superfluous condemnations are less than intelligent. <br /> <br />As for the Collection, it is incredible. A few of my personal favorite songs like \\"Give In To Me\\" and \\"She Drives Me Wild\\" did not make it onto the collection, but it is nevertheless a stunningly complete summation of MJ's work. I hope all of you will enjoy it as much as I did.
B00008H2LB|2.0|Alright so Im gunna sum up this album in one quick blue print <br /> <br />1. Little instramental before song <br />2. Slow singing <br />3. Singning picks up <br />4. Chorus <br />5. Back to the way 3 was <br />4. Chorus <br />5. Bout 20 seconds of screaming <br />6. Chorus <br />7. Fade <br /> <br />Don't agree? Play \\"Numb\\" and \\"Breaking the Habit\\" at the same time. Its the same song, different rythm. <br /> <br />With that said I'd like to say, before all you fans kill me, that I liked LP's debut, but they're just another band to be added to the millions cranked through the system and spit out a \\"hit\\" producing machine.
B00005OAIE|4.0|i too first saw john mayer on the eric clapton pbs special and was blown away by his guitar work. once he started to sing, i wasn't as impressed, mainly because i couldn't understand the lyrics with his mumbling and affected tone. i have since listened to several albums and am really sorry that he doesn't do more guitar work. this album is worth a listen, though. it has some good, catchy songs with interesting lyrics. what i guess it the most \\"popular\\" song, your body is a wonderful is predictably insipid, but other songs are fun to listen to.
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|I bought Shania Twains GH cd from you and I am very pleased with it. I have been listening to it everyday since I recieved it in November. The songs that are on that cd are some of the best songs in Country music today and I highly reccomend it to other listeners. Shania has a very down to earth style and the songs she writes are written from her heart and you see and hear that through the songs and videos. I guarantee if you buy this cd you will not be disappointed.
B0000E1ALR|5.0|First I have to admit I wasn't a fan of Springsteen's immediately. I'm always suspicious when the press annoints someone or something as \\"the next big thing\\". More often than not they go for style over substance and end up backpedaling later on. Such isn't the case with Springsteen. I like his first two albums but am not a huge fan of them sot his collection worked well for me as it summarized the best tracks and also threw in some of the best material from each of his successive solo albums. Sure, you could argue about your favorite song being left out (I recall someone reviewing this and complaining about \\"Tougher than the Rest\\"  not being here vs. the \\"inferior\\" \\"Tunnel of Love\\". Perhaps it's just me but there's a depth to \\"Tunnel of Love\\"--and \\"Brilliant Disguise for that matter-- and musical richness that I think makes that song superior to the fun \\"Tougher than the Rest\\") but, on the whole, Springsteen has managed to digest his career very well in this summation. Combine this three disc set with the 2000 live album and \\"Tracks\\" and you've got a great summary for fans just getting into The Boss.<br /><br />First the good news is that if you have his earlier albums on CD, the remastered tracks here sound much better than those older CDs. Second, if you're buying this you're either a fan who wants the bonus disc of outtakes or somebody who wants his hits and better album tracks. Either way, you can't go wrong. Disc One may slight \\"Nebraska\\" a bit and the superb \\"The River\\" but, again, the tracks chosen represent the heart and soul of those albums in the form of important album tracks and singles.<br /><br />The bonus disc nicely compliments the other material featuring stuff Springsteen did for films, tribute albums and material for other artists to cover. Personally, I took the three CD set here, reshuffled it a bit and added some material I felt was missing. On the first disc I added \\"Growin' Up\\" ( the acoustic demo from \\"Tracks\\") \\"It's Hard to be a Saint in the City\\",\\"Tenth Ave. Freeze Out\\" (a live version since the sound quality was better and it had the energy), \\"Candy's Room\\" and \\"Streets of Fire\\". Also I'd add \\"\\"The Ties that Bind\\", \\"You Can Look But You Better Not Touch\\" from \\"The River\\". The second disc I threw on \\"Pink Cadillac\\" which is one of the best Springsteen underbellys ever released. \\"One Step Up\\"I would also add \\"Janey's Don't you Lose Heart\\" \\"Blood Brothers\\" (the alternate version from the bonus CD that came with the \\"Blood Brothers\\" VHS video in 1996), \\"Secret Garden\\" (from \\"The Greatest Hits\\")and \\"My City of Ruins\\" from \\"The Rising\\".<br /><br />The third disc of rarities and unreleased tracks would benefit from \\"Murder Incorporated\\"( the live version from Tramps), \\"My Hometown\\" (the live version from the promo that was given out when the 2000 live album came out), \\"Sad Eyes\\", \\"Brother's Under the Bridge\\", \\"Born in the USA\\" (acoustic demo), \\"Lion's Den\\" all from Tracks.<br /><br />If fans want a handy summary they can make one themselves or pick up this exceptional 3 CD set, combine it with the \\"18 Tracks\\" CD and have an instant nearly perfect boxed set. I think that Springsteen realizes that most hardcore fans have compiled their own \\"best of\\" boxed set with bonus tracks which also may be another reason why he hasn't ventured down that path. Either way, there's a lot of great (and, honestly, not so great) material scattered over way too many discs. Hopefully The Boss will bring it all together in a \\"summary\\" album not one that feels is closing his career.  Either way, I'd suggest fans pick this set up for the remastered sound and rarities. Don't pay full retail of course that way you're only paying for the bonus disc.Ave. Freeze Out\\" (a live version since the sound quality was better and it had the energy), \\"Candy's Room\\" and \\"Streets of Fire\\".

B000005K2N|5.0|I'm going to give this my best shot at writing an unbiased review.  First of all, however, I'd like to start out by saying that anyone who numbers Linkin Park and Hilary Duff among the best performers of all time and who is a Barney fan is also a know-nothing hypocritical moron and has no idea what he's saying.  You know who you are.  Thank you.  (And by the way, it was in very poor taste to call John Lennon \\"talentless\\" on the anniversary of his death.  Watch it.) <br />Regardless, the Doors have had an amazing impact on culture in general.  They earned all the respect they got and deserved more.  This debut cd was, in my opinion, their finest.  Their talent is still widely acknowledged today, and not only by the middle-aged.  They maintain a devoted fan base including members of the younger generation who know where to find a good time.  The world lost a veritable musical and poetic genius when Jim Morrison died.
B00004R99J|1.0|When I first saw this movie, it was while working at a day care during my college years. We used to have a movie near to dismissal time so as to keep the kids entertained while we closed it down for the day.  I have to say that it took every bit of my willpower to keep from ripping the tape out of the VCR and showing something else.  <br /> <br />Who does Disney really think they are?  How dare they take our American history and ruin it?  I can understand sanitizing Grimm fairy tales for modern children (to an extent though it's nothing I am fond of), but sanitizing American history?! <br /> <br />Disney had no business doing this movie if they are so afraid to tell the story as it was. An entire generation of kids are going to grow up with the wrong idea about what really happened.  Native Americans should have taken this movie on with the vigor they take on the names of sports teams. Any American should be insulted. I know I was.  <br /> <br />
B0001XALTG|5.0|\\"Trainspotting\\" is a gritty film about the horrors of heroin use.  As a friend of mine once said, \\"it's not a date film\\".  It is, however, a great film.<br /><br />At no time does \\"Trainspotting\\" glamourise the drug culture.  By the same token, at no time does it become preachy or self-righteous.  It is simply a grim look at the whole industry.<br /><br />The film is bleak and dark but, from time to time, it is also funny.  Ewan McGregor as the narrator and chief character is brilliant.  So too is Robert Carlyle as the psychotic thug whose reversion to violence can be abrupt and frightening.  These two and an assorted cast of misfits create a true film masterpiece.<br /><br />A plot, to the extent that it exists, concerns the ups and downs of a gang of Glaswegian no hopers.  Heroin is the only glue that holds them together.  It is also the substance that is ineluctably destroying them.  There are many downs and few high points.  Heroin is a savage mistress.  Yet, as the film ends, we see that perhaps our hero will get on the straight and narrow.  There is a glimmer of hope in a sea of distress.<br /><br />This film is a must see!
B0000033OZ|5.0|the second most fun album by ELP. This might seem strange to say about the band, but honestly they had a sense of humor and most of their stuff was pretty lightweight or funny. I mean, the longest piece on this album, take a pebble has one of the most beautiful melodies the band ever cooked up: and yet, it still has time to include a goofy clap along country middle. And the band never rocked this hard again: Knife's Edge is almost heavy metal, and The Barbarian their first classical adaptation: and wonderful, perhaps their most succesful, not counting Tocata. However, that's just the first side: the second side already has the \\"hey let's have each member do a part by themselves duuur\\" mentality that would hurt Works 1. However, these are mostly good. Emerson's organ section is wonderfully goofy: i'm not sure what he's trying to do here. Is he trying to be scary? beautiful? Who knows or cares: it's a blast. And Carl's drum solo Tank is well a drum solo: but a drum solo by one of the best drummers ever, and it also features some great band jamming. And Greg Lake's lucky man needs no introduction. The first song Greg ever wrote, it's still startlingly beautiful till today. The only thing missing from this album is an ELP epic, but that's fixed by the next album. <br /> <br />Negatives: no epic. The solo spots are a bit goofy. <br /> <br />Positives: everything else. An almost perfect debut.
B00006DEFA|5.0|Before commiting yourself to this read, I would like to point out that this is a very, very long review. I've been reading some of the reviews here, and found a lot of derogatory comments about the movie's inaccuracy. Not the playright, nor the director made any claims of historical accuracy on this movie. It's a fiction based on real historical caracters. Although this review should be about the movie and not about historical truth, I can't help pointing out certain false informations printed by certain people. Some people claimed that Mozart was not popular in his own time. I'm getting sick and tired of people throwing that cliche around about every single philosophical, musical, scientific, artistic, or literary genius that ever lived. People in his time were well aware of his genius. The reason he had some trouble pleasing the aristocracy was that his music was too avant-guarde and it took some time for people to warm up to it. But no one doubted his genius. Do your research on Mozart and the music of the late 1700's and you will see how aware people were of his talents. There were reasons for his financial problems, and lack of popularity wasn't one of them. In fact, as Charles Rosen mentioned in his book \\"The Classical Style\\", some years, Mozart was among the top 2% of earners in Vienna. Before I proceed with my comments on the movie, here are some other facts. In truth, Salieri was not chaste. He got married at the age of 24, and raised a ridiculously big number of children. So, by the time he met Mozart, he had been a family man for 8 years. We also know that Count Walsegg was the one who comissioned the Requiem, and Mozart was well aware of this, despite the Counts discretion. Everyone in Vienna knew of the Counts reputation for commissioning works from famous composers to pass off as his own in concerts thrown at his parties. And Mozart's pupil Franz Xavier Sussmayr was the one Mozart was dictating the Requiem to while his wife, his doctor, and many otherswere around him at his death (Salieri was not there). Mozart knew he was dying, and believed he was writting the Requiem for himself; not his father, as implied in the movie. His opera Don Giovanni, although blattantly obvious in it's insinuations on Mozart's relationship with his father, was composed before Leopold's death; not as a result of it. Mozart and Constanze actually accompanied Salieri and his wife to the premiere of The Magic Flute. Yes, Salieri was jealous of Mozart and repeatedly suppressed his advancement. There are many documented proofs of this, as well as proofs that I'm sure are lost or destroyed by Salieri himself, as the playwrite noted. There. That's for all you people who need factual information on Mozart's life to use in putting the movie down for not being accurate. And for those who accept the work as fiction, and care only to appreciate it as one, here are my comments on it:... This is a very misunderstood movie. I've read review after review from people who hail it as the geatest movie ever without the least bit awareness of it's content. Salieri didn't kill Mozart because he was insane with jealousy and just wanted to get rid of him...Salieri's battle was not with Mozart. It was with God. He had sacrificed all his non-christian impulses to be a great composer; respected all his vows to God; was granted the position of \\"court composer\\" at the Emperor's residence in Vienna; etc...And then came Mozart. As non-christian as they come...writing down the voice of God...God had granted his wish to an overgrown, sleezy, obnoxious child despite all of his sacrifices, and gave this child an obscene laugh which symbolized God laughing at him (yes, there's more to that laugh than simply amusing the viewers...)He vowed to destroy this creature of God's ,that's even going by the name of \\"Amadeus\\", which means \\"God's Beloved\\" in latin. He suppresses Mozart's progress so that Mozart never gets the recognition he deserves. \\"This child of God will not accomplish the task given him by his master. That task was mine! Not his...\\" And now, in the director's cut, we're really shown the extents to which Salieri goes to achieve this creature's destruction. In the original theatrical release, we are not. To all those who say that the added scenes are pointless,...I salute you. The nude scene with Mozart's wife...pointless? I don't think so...Salieri vowed never to indulge in sexual activity...now he sees what the creature has...what he vowed to sacrifice...Mozart's wife standing naked in front of him...making him weak in the knees...he shies away from it: \\"From now on, we are enemies...you and I...\\" he says to God. \\"I will hinder and harm your creature on earth as far as I am able!..\\" And that beautiful climax around the end of the movie where you see Mozart laying dumped in that pauper's grave with white smoke seemingly emanating from it and the Lacrymosa sounding it's \\"Amen\\" at the end of the piece. Right there, you have the entire story in one image: Mozart's poverty, and his death..the result of another man's battle with God...I read some reviews here nagging about the fact that we don't actually see Salieri poison Mozart...Salieri never poisoned Mozart. \\"Your merciful God...He destroyed his own beloved, rather than let a mediocrity share in the smallest part of his glory...\\" He thought that God killed Mozart to prevent him from stealing the Requiem. That's why he felt responsible for his death. And more \\"he killed Mozart, and kept me alive to torure!\\" To prevent him from stealing the Requiem, God could've killed him instead of Mozart, but didn't. He killed Mozart and kept Salieri alive so that Salieri will see how revered Mozart's music would grow to become despite all his efforts to supress it...\\"32 years of torture...of watching myself become extinct...My music groing fainther and fainther,...while his...\\" And he's strolled off on his weelchair in his madness,...puts his hands on his heart as he hears God still laughing at him just before the credits roll... There's also a sublime moment in the movie whose beauty you only notice the second time you watch the film. In this moment, you are given a hint that Salieri's truth about God having killed Mozart to prevent his hogging the glory for the Requiem might be true. Mozart's wife asks her husband about the Requiem :\\"Why on earth won't you finish it? Can you give me one reason I can understand?\\"..Mozart replies:\\" Because it's killing me...\\"
B0000033P2|5.0|Somehow, this album comes across as ELP's easy listening album. Don't get me wrong, this album has segments of experimentation and jarring passages. But the smooth production of everything reminds me more of Works 1 than earlier albums and even Brain Salad Surgery. And that's okay! This smoothness gives the album a much more listenable sheen than earlier albums. <br /> <br />The songs are pretty strong, Endless Enigma being quite a nice epic, even if the lyrics are even more moronic anti-religion lyrics (and I am not a religious man: i just wish greg would write better lyrics for this) and from the beginning being another great lake ballad. not as memorable maybe as you turn me on, or as beautiful as lucky man it still qualifies. The Sherrif is the second best \\"goofy bar song\\" even if most of the joke comes from the obviously sped up honky tonk piano parts. The copland adaptation is fine, if not as intense as Tocata or pictures at an exhibition. <br /> <br />Trilogy mixes beauty with jamming to come up with one of ELP's greatest songs. Living Sin is an \\"okay\\" rocker, of the type done on Tarkus, but not as memorable. And Bolero is strange, unlike anything the band ever did before or since: trying to come up with a hypnotic song I think. It works. <br /> <br />Negatives: smoothness might go down a bit too easily, not as experimental as earlier albums. <br /> <br />Positives: easier to listen to because of smoothness. Songs are pretty damn good. Two of the best epics by ELP (endless enigma and trilogy) and a strange diffrentiation from their formula with Bolero. <br /> <br />This album continues the formula of short rock songs and ballads mixed with epics mixed with joke songs and classical adaptations. ELP was very formulaic in that sense. However, it's very consistent as it doesn't have a REALLY REALLY long epic piece, just a few medium length epics and great ballads and classical adaptations. not the first ELP album to get, really.
B00062ZE3U|4.0|Within Temptation has definately been my favorite band of this genre, and The Silent Force seems to continue their trend of producing quality music. Having fallen in love with their Mother Earth album, I eagerly awaited this release and am not disappointed in the least. Listening to the first tracks on the CD gave me that same tingly feeling that the chorus of the title track on Mother Earth gave me the first time I heard it, and has that full orchestral/rock effect that I came to know and love from other tracks on that CD as well. <br /> <br />Perhaps it is because I also like Evanescence, but having read the other reviewers complaints about Stand My Ground, I am unsure what their issue with the track is. It may have a different feel than most of the other tracks on the CD, but I feel it was a good track as well, and certainly not something to dissuade me from getting this album. Cries of \\"sell-out\\" are in my opinion entirely unwarranted, and if one single track is going to ruin your opinion of this band, that is an unfortunate decision. <br /> <br />If you like Within Temptation, this is more of the same good music that they have produced on previous albums. While I may agree that newcomers may be best off by discovering this band by listening to Mother Earth, I feel that The Silent Force is a good entry point as well, especially with tracks like See Who I Am leading the march on this CD.
B0000033TE|5.0|ridiculous lyrics abound on the classic epic Karn Evil 9. Karn Evil, Carnival. Hardy frigging har. <br /> <br />Karn Evil isn't as good as Tarkus but it's still quite striking. Lots of amazing passages, mixed with beautiful melodies and jamming power. Also, very expertly produced: so much is going on in the mix, it's hard to keep track! Quite a strong epic. <br /> <br />And the first side is the best \\"oh yeah here's some other songs\\" side by ELP ever. Their rearrangement of Jersualem is a strong, pompous way to start the album. Follows is Toccata, without a doubt their most experimental classical adaptation ever. And Ginastera loved it.  <br /> <br />Followed by Still You Turn me on greg's absolutely best ballad. Lots going on in the mix: wah wah guitars, keyboards, accordions etc. Greg really threw it all on for this one. And Benny The Bouncer is hilarious, and actually features GOOD lyrics by Pete Sinfield, surprise surprise.  <br /> <br />The most amazing thing about this album is the production. They really threw it all out for this, or more accurately greg lake. This was the absolute pinnacle of his powers of production, and it shows. It is smooth yet harsh, memorable yet experimental. This album is everything good prog rock should be. <br /> <br />Negatives: parts of Karn Evil drag. <br /> <br />Postives: everything else.  <br /> <br />I'm still not sure if this is the best ELP album to buy first: it was mine, and I was slightly let down at first by the others, until later listening's revealed their strengths.
B00002Z88D|1.0|way to mess up some really good songs like battery and the thing that should not be. this album is a thing that should not be.
B0000033P0|5.0|Tarkus. The band's first epic piece, and their best. This is also one of the absolute best progressive rock pieces I've ever heard. It flows naturally and smoothly: it's almost like thick as a brick, in that it actually seems like one song. I was surprised the first time this song was over: I was used to prog pieces that seemed like several songs stuck together. For that alone, this album gets five stars. <br /> <br />And the fun songs that are on side two keep it there. Sure, these are no Tarkus: but should they be? Are You Ready Eddy is a reasonable 50's parody and a blast, and even though Greg Lake shows his remarkably stupid and unoriginal ideas on religion in the only way and infinite space, these two at least have interesting music to them. Jeremey Bender is the first of their \\"goofy bar music\\" songs and it isn't their best: Benny The Bouncer is. But it's at least a great deflation tactic: imagine the shock of hearing this amazing epic piece, flipping over the album, and hearing a not even two minute bar room song. It shows the band did have a sense of humor. And this also features two high energy pieces: Bitches Cyrstal and Time And A Place: two great rock pieces. <br /> <br />Negatives: side two is light weight compared to the first. <br /> <br />Postives: TARKUS and the other songs are still fun. <br /> <br />Almost the best ELP album. It's so close... and yet... side two isn't as good as side one on Brain Salad Surgery.
B00005AQE8|5.0|This cd is as good as you've been hearing it is. Trust me. This is tha first two-disc cd in rap history. This is Tupac's first cd under tha DeathRow Label. It's pretty damn good. Some people say that tha second disc is crap compared to tha first one, those people havn't given tha second disc a chance. Tha second disc has awesome tracks such as: Run Tha Streets, Heaven Ain't Hard To Find, Rather Be Ya N*gga, Can't See Me, Wonda Why They Call U B*tch, and tha title track, All Eyez On Me. Tha first cd is crazyy too with hott tracks like I Ain't Mad At Cha, Only God Can Judge Me, Ambitionz As A Ridah, All About U, Picture Me Rollin', Life Goes On, No More Pain (sickkkk song), etc. Tha album is crazy, go get it! It also features guest appearances from Tha Outlawz (Group's only female Storm makes her first appearance), Snoop Doggy Dogg, Method Man, Redman, Big Syke, Richie Rich, Devante, etc.  Get this album, you won't be sorry.
B000002JNJ|5.0|I feel this is the only way to pay my deepest respects to Dimebag Darrell, a truly amazing one-of-a-kind guitarist who's spirit and soul will ALWAYS be with us and in the Pantera records. Every second of this album has never sounded more essential to me and the rest of the Pantera fans whom are also shocked by the foul way Dimebag was murdered just five days ago. <br /> <br />Just listen to the beginning riff on the album-titled track 'Cowboys from Hell' which catapulted the band's career. The thrash metal notes on 'Domination', 'Heresy', 'Art of Shredding', & 'Message in Blood' were too a trademark to his work. Or the ballad esque stylings of 'Cemetery Gates' & 'The Sleep'. It's no wonder Dimebag's death has made such a huge impact on the metal world. <br /> <br />Us fans will always remember him, and will too listen to Pantera & Damageplan as long as we live. <br /> <br />I can't even bare to imagine the pain his poor family & friends must be going through. Especially his brother Vinnie. <br /> <br />R.I.P Dimebag Darrell, I believe your spirit is in a much better place. <br /> <br />Goodbye for now...
B000669GAI|5.0|Well it's around christmas time and everyone is out looking for that special gift for that special someone. Well, if that special someone is a Pearl Jam fan, than Rearview Mirror is not a bad idea overall. This greatest hits album has impressed me...alot. I very surprised to see how well constructed this album is. It includes all the obvious hits like \\"Evenflow\\", \\"Jeremy\\", \\"Alive\\", \\"Go\\", \\"Daughter\\", \\"Betterman\\",\\"Corduroy\\" and fittingly as the last track on the entire album, \\"Yellow Ledbetter\\" as well as some of the more recent fan favorites like \\"Light Years\\", \\"Nothing As It Seems\\", \\"Save You\\", and \\"I Am Mine\\". So the album itself does an excellent job of giving the band's work fair representation. On top of theat the album is seperated into an \\"Upside\\" and a \\"Downside\\" meaning all the hard rockers are on the first disc with the ballads on the second while being organized in chronological order. This organization scheme is ingenious. Although there are some tracks like \\"Love Boat Captain\\", \\"Tremor Christ\\" and \\"Thumbing My Way\\" that could have been included. But who knows, maybe there was a strict limit of 33 tracks. Whether that's the case or not, Pearl Jam will be leaving Epic Records with their heads held high. As this album shows, they've had an excellent career and I look forward to their new album which should be coming out in 2005. And for those of you who despise the \\"Greatest Hits\\" idea, this album is actually the final contract obligation that Pearl Jam had to meet to break away from their record company. So that makes it even better. In short, this is definitely a great gift idea for any Pearl Jam fan and the band should be commended for creating the best greatest hits compilation possible.
B000002H97|2.0|I guess if you're new to Metallica this is a great album . If you're a long time fan  - it stinks. It's Metallicas attempt to reach a larger audience. If you want to reach a larger audience the first thing you do is sweeten your sound - and thats just what they did. Enter Sandman is a very catchy tune. If your name is Poison or Def Leppard is great to have catchy songs - if your name is Metallica - its a sellout. Sad But True and Unforgiven are.....unforgivable pop songs.The rest of the album , with the exceptions of Of Wolf and Man and Holier Than Thou is kind of bland. And give me break with these lyrics - sounds like something a fourteen year old might wright. The days of Kill Em All , R T L , and M O P are obviously long gone.
B00003CXCT|1.0|DONT GET ME WRONG STAR WARS IS GREAT AND I AM A HUGE STAR WARS FAN BUT THE REASON THIS DVD RIP OFF SUCKS IS THAT THEY CHANGED THE VOICES AND 50% OF THE PLOT.
0060005688|5.0|This book was excellent in 2 ways: first, the style was relaxing, filled with many common situations we can all relate to. (After all...struggling with choices can be as difficult in a supermarket as it is on Wall Street if we let it be.)      Second, Schwartz gives sound insight as to how to turn the corner, how to know when not to overanalyse. We learn over time how to make sound decisions, but sometimes we apply too much scrutiny to things that are not so important. We think that trying harder will always lead to something better, so if I think about this decision JUST A LITTLE BIT LONGER then more information will present itself and I'll be glad I waited. This makes sense on paper, but in practice it leads to procrastination, doubt and regret. (And we wake up 6 months later having made no move, no decision, and wondering why the \\"new information\\" never seemed to appear).            Finally, Schwartz presents a framework--not a formula that WILL work and WILL bring success, but a way of looking at decisions that you can apply to even the most mundane decisions you have to make.  This is refreshing; so many books have you saying, \\"that's true\\" all the way through the book, but in the end offer no solutions, no realistic way to incorporate those ideas into everyday life. The Paradox of Choice is the exception, for it shows how a change in paradigm can lead to totally different results. One great example was in buying food: an example was given where 24 types of jam were for sale and how 6 of them were open for customers to sample.  Meanwhile, on the other side of the same store, the same 24 jams were presented with all 24 available to sample.  The results? The display with only 6 open outsold the other by 30%--which on paper makes no sense because you'd think that people would say, \\"how do I know what I like unless I test them ALL?\\"   But this isn't how it really works, for how many of us have the time and energy to stand at a display for half an hour to make a decision as minor as buying one jar of jam? We don't \\"have time\\" to make the decision, hence we make none.  Whereas when only 6 are open, I feel I can put 5 minutes into it and make a complete decision. (While you could argue that we could do that all along, that we could test any 6 of the open 24 and stop, most of us don't have the discipline to do that.)  This is the paradox he writes of:  while it seems like having a greater selection creates more freedom, what it really does is give us more to weigh, more to secondguess later.  You can think of tons of examples--cell phone plans, laptops, insurance policies.  We're afraid to jump in and commit because with our luck the perfect choice will present itself 2 months from now.  Schwartz shows us that learning how to make decisions we can live with(and not dwell on afterwards) with can give us the peace of mind we're all so diligently looking for.

B000002MK8|5.0|This excellent album has all the grit and feeling of Rod Stewart's delightful early-70s LPs.  Accompanied by a great combo which includes former bandmate Ronnie Wood, he returns to the acoustic rock n' roll and folk that marked his greatest recordings, and even if \\"Unplugged\\" can't quite match \\"Gasoline Alley\\" or the sublime \\"Every Picture Tells A Story\\", it's really amazing how close it comes at times.    Rod Stewart sounds fine, if a little bit ragged at first, and the set opens with a wonderfully tough acoustic rendition of the sleazy rocker \\"Hot Legs\\", and the unplugged versions of the Faces' only hit, \\"Stay With Me\\", and Sam Cooke's \\"Having A Party\\" are equally superb.  \\"The First Cut Is The Deepest\\" is a bit too saccharine for my taste, and a clumsy rendition of \\"People Get Ready\\" never gets off the ground. But everything else is good, and most of it is great, like the swinging blues \\"Highgate Shuffle\\", the country-rock of \\"Cut Across Shorty\\", the melancholy \\"Handbands And Gladrags\\", and the 70s classic \\"Maggie May\\".    Great sound, great songs, great arrangements and a whole lot of feeling and character.  4 1/2 stars - highly recommended.
B00066J1RG|5.0|That's right folks, there has been a change! There is a saying in the music industry, that you can't really judge how much of an impact a recording artist has had until you look at their comprehensive Greatest Hits album. If it was just a retrospective album I would say the competition between her and Madonna would still be close but Kylie would STILL be a hit or two away from passing her. BUT, the addition of \\"I Believe In You\\" on the album pushes Kylie WAAAY far ahead of anything Madonna has done in the last few years. In fact, \\"I Believe In You\\" is the best song I have ever heard, plain and simple. It's better than \\"Can't Get You Out Of My Head\\", it's better than \\"Love At First Sight\\", it's better than \\"Slow\\". Like another reviewer said, if \\"I Believe In You\\" and by extension \\"Ultimate Kylie\\" isn't a hit here in the states, then I have lost faith in the taste of the American public.  <br />
B00006CXSS|5.0|First off - I'm not an American <br />Second - I'm not \\"active\\" military <br />Third - I think war is the most \\"ugliest and most inhumane\\" thing on planet Earth. <br /> <br />With that out of the way, let me please comment on \\"Band Of Brothers\\". <br /> <br /> <br />As Mr. Bando's site will point out no doubt - there are many innacuracies within this HBO mini-series. I donot mean to slight Mr. Bando - he has done an excellent job and a commendable service in pointing out historical inaccuracies in the series. We are in his debt. <br /> <br />However, these inaccuracies, IMHO, donot detract from the main theme of this series. The \\"Band of Brothers\\" depicted here, were also part of the \\"Greatest Generation\\". To many today, this might sound like a tired, cliched term. <br /> <br />Watch this series with an open mind - and it WILL change your opinion about this generation. <br /> <br />What is ostensibly about the lives and experiences of the \\"grunts\\" of \\"E\\" Company, 506th PIR, 101st Airborne Division in the Second World War - turns into a living, moving picture about war as experienced through individual lives of the men who fought, suffered and died though it. <br /> <br />This is no \\"glorified\\" version of war. This is no \\"pep talk\\". Nor is this propaganda. This is war - as seen through ordinary eyes. In all it's brutality and inhumanity - but also through it's courage and honour. <br /> <br />Packed with perspective and insight - Band of Brothers allows those of us who were not a part of it, expereince life as they did. The interviews with the surviving veterans of the global cataclysm - right from training till the end of the war - allow us to see a different view of the war and how it affected each soul that went through it and lived to talk about it. <br /> <br />This is not a patriotic drum beating film. This has nothing to do with the \\"glory of combat\\". This has ALL to do with \\"ordinary men who did extra-ordinary things\\". May we all be priviledged to have known men such as Mr. Richard Winters. <br /> <br />Donot grduge the cost. This is ONE series that WILL change your life for the better. Get it.

0671027344|4.0|'The Perks of Being a Wallflower', the debut novel from author Stephen Chbosky, is the story of one fifteen-year-old named Charlie. Through a series of letters that he writes to an unknown 'friend', the reader gains an insight into his slightly chaotic teenage life. <br /> <br />'Perks' is written with beautiful, simple prose, and it's full of emotion. Sure, it's full of cliches (the confused gay guy, the jock brother, the genius sister, the goths and punks of society), but I feel that Chbosky has put this book together in a way that makes all those stereotypes seem real and fresh. He's managed to get inside the head of a really disturbed teenager and view the world through Charlie's eyes.  <br /> <br />I can understand that this book isn't for everyone, but to a lot of disenchanted people, I think it means something. You may not be able to relate completely with Charlie, but you might be able to understand little bits of his life.
B0001HAISG|5.0|This was one of my favourite movies of last year - truly magical, beautifully shot, wonderfully acted, and surprisingly moving. <br /> <br />The highlight of the film for me was Jason Isaacs as Captain Hook, deliciously evil but sexy in gorgeous costumes, and ranging from the ever-so-slightly camp to the genuinely touching (including a good smattering of sinister and creepy moments). It's a real shame the movie wasn't promoted well enough for him to get the Best Supporting Actor nomination he deserved. <br /> <br />Also deserving of Oscar nominations were the enchanting score, and atmospheric cinematography. <br /> <br />I appreciated some of the depth of the movie too - possibly too dark for some as a children's movie, it dealt with the conflicts of a child becoming a woman in a restrictive era, and of her inner journey.  <br /> <br />Although of course a film this beautiful deserves to be seen on the big screen, this DVD shouldn't be missed.
B00021R7CG|4.0|This was a made-for-TV movie that was unusually good, with an awesome cast. Powers Boothe and Rebecca De Mornay star as the pilot and co-pilot of a nuclear-armed B-52 bomber. James Earl Jones co-stars in another nuclear-war film (SEE: \\"Dr. Strangelove\\"), only this time it's serious. The only problem with this DVD is that there are NO special features; no trailers, no featurettes, no nothing. Otherwise, a great film and a must-see.
B00005V1Y0|5.0|I actually am one of the few people in the US who saw this movie back when it first came out - I loved it. I was literally raised on this movie, and when DVDs first came around, I couldn't wait to get it. This movie has heart, a great cast who knows how to have fun, and most of all, amazing dance sequences. If you don't want to go out and find someone like Scott and dance the night away after watching this flick, you need help. Highly recommended for anyone who wants to see Baz Luhrmann's roots, or for anyone who is a fan of the quirky Australian film genre as a whole.
B000002A40|5.0|For true Santana fans this is a must have. Pure genius compared to the sell out crap hes producing now. This band was so innovative in the early days its a shame to see some of the newer pop crap
0803726570|5.0|Funny, that this is the first book my husband picks up every night to read to our daughter. He asked me to buy all of her books!  He loves her style and the illustrations are excellent. My daughter loves this book and it is not scary at all! Buy this book and her others you will not be disappointed! <br />
B00004X0ER|5.0|This an amazing album all the way through.  It's not like those sellout bands with an album that has one good song.  You can listen to all 12 songs without stopping and then want to hear them again.  This is a perfect example of a real punk rock record.  It resembles bands like the ramones and the sex pistols much more than these new sellout bands like simple plan and good charlotte and yellowcard and bands like that.  It is perfect for audiences anywhere from the rebellious kids of the 1970's to the emo kids of the 1990's.  It is an amazing album and i reccomend i to everyone.
0312995423|5.0|I don't read often, in fact I think this was only the second or third book I've read cover to cover. Why 5 stars? Because I could read it cover to cover and that for me is very rare. This and Deception Point by Dan Brown are now my favorite all time books. You could also check out the Net Force series by Steve Perry (A Tom Clancy series).
0380977788|2.0|By Amber <br /> <br />A quiet little town and a peaceful family thought to be living their lives in serendipity. Until, the quietness is replaced with jaw dropping phenomenons of the paranormal world. Now forcing coralline to race to beat the clock in search for her parents, who mysteriously disappeared. Through trials and tribulations, this once quiet and curious girl, has regrets upon ever opening the door, curiosity kills the cat.  <br /> <br />The book moved too slowly. In the beginning, of the book Coraline, the pace was a lot faster. After about the second or third chapter things started to slow down. It seemed to have a lot of repetitiveness in it which made it seem even slower. It is highly likely would have enjoyed this book if it had a faster pace.  <br /> <br />There was no real high point in this story. Since the book was unsuspenceful, it made it almost impossible to identify the climax. Others may find a climax, but I am discouraged; especially by the way the book seems to continue on with no point or reason. Also, the plot didn't seem to take me to a climax of the story. Overall, the climax did not stand out from the plot.  <br /> <br />I would not recommend this book to an older audience. I would say that it is not for people that want a high climax thriller or an action packed book.  On the whole, I would give this book an overall 2 stars.  <br />
B0002ZDVEU|5.0|Matt Damon pretty much carries this sequal where his charecter comes closer to restoring his memory of who he realy is. Julia Styles also shines in her role as someone who is still uncertain if she is a friend or for of Jason Bourne. This is a very complex an intiguing film. I do believe this movie could stand on it's own with a flashback from the first film. If you have not seen the first it is highly recommended you see it before seeing the Bourne Supremecy. I'm hoping that they make a third in the series. Excellent film making. Per another review I also purchase The Bourne Supremacy. I buy on average a dvd a week and [...] appears to have the best prices when shipping costs are factored in.
B0001NBMBC|4.0|When I first heard this album, I loathed it. I thought it should have been called \\"Stone Sour: Volume 2.\\" But as I listened to it more and more, it grew on me. Now I honestly love this album. <br /> <br />Granted, it's nowhere near as hardcore as their self-titled album or Iowa, but there are still some heavy stuff meshed in with the \\"softer\\" stuff.
0061092037|4.0|Some reviewers state there is no heros in this book - it's about the least objectionable person.  They are right.  It's thinly disguested Maxwell and Murdoch.  It's no wonder they sued to stop publicication of the work. <br /> <br />Each character has their share of sleeze.  Both were willing to do whatever it took to come out on top.  But neither had the good sense to recognize when they should let it go... and let the other ruin each other. <br /> <br />Indeed, ask yourself before the end - which man deserves to triumph.  The best of them, the worst of them, neither, or just one of them.  The answer might not be what you think.
0316096199|4.0|After reading ,\\"The Lovely Bones\\", I felt i understood Alice Sebold's style of writing. However, she managed to amaze me once again with her memoir,\\"Lucky\\". The idea of being raped is inconceivable to me, but her vivd detail and precise recollections of her horrible experience, allows the reader to at least begin to understand what she must have gone through. I never put the book down. The book Started off with chilling accounts of the night her rape happened, and continued intriguing the reader. The events in the book held my attention at all times. I also admire Alice Sebold for her courage and ability to share her rape experience with the world. In the book, she remained so incredibly strong, even at times where she could have easily just given up her struggle to find and send her rapist to prison. Her family in the memoir was very paculiar. Alice seemed to always be the care-giver for them, even though she was the one who needed to be taken care of after her rape. While I know her parents cared about what happened to her, they seem to still be wrapped up in their own world, and their own agendas. I particularly loved Alice's cut-to-the-chase attitude, and her hatred for being pitied. She wanted to be treated as a normal human being, not as a lost cause, just because she had been raped. I also admired her ability to carry on and try new relationships with other men, even after her rape. I give this book four stars ,and recommend this book to everyone , since everyone can learn from Sebold's experience, and can sympathize to what she must have been feeling at the time. If you liked \\"The Lovely Bones\\", you'll love \\"Lucky\\".
B0000AXE8I|1.0|I loved the first one. Its groundbreaking special effects were awesome and proved that there is no way you can do thoes (ahem) moves.then this sequel totally sucked. first of all, he just does a couple of favours thd that's about it. First ,when he fights the upgrades it lookes like he's doing yoga in the air. Now he stops bullets with his hands, flies in the air all day and yet even worse,makes cars fly around.When he picks up the pole (or wahtever it is) and and spin around it looks like he's a hamster in a little excersise ball.And in the end, Trinity's death scene is pathetic. plus, what the (...) was with the 30 minute car chase?!Totally bad. Revolutions is better and i give the 3rd matrix movie 4 stars.If you like this sequel you need to see a doctor. THE END.
B000002UB3|5.0|The Beatles' Abbey Road (1969) is, to these humble ears, THE greatest record ever produced. It casts its shadow over such milestone records as Dark Side of the Moon (pun intended), Pet Sounds, and Led Zeppelin IV. It's better than any other Beatles album - that includes the genius of Revolver, Sgt. Pepper, and the White Album. The only solo Beatles album I can think of that comes anywhere close thematically, creatively, and majestically is Band on the Run, and even that brilliant record is inferior. It was the Beatles' last record, their swansong, and released at the end of 1969 it was the swansong of the 60s as well.    The Beatles were on the rocks by the time '69 rolled around, teetering precariously on the verge of meltdown. But in spite of their differences they managed to band together, one last time, to make Abbey Road. Of course the Lads didn't consciously intend it as their coup de grace, but with its scope and power and brilliance it's almost as if they could sense the end was near. So whether intentional or unintentional, it's their grand finale, and they make use of it as only the Beatles can - John's rhythm guitar and harmonies are spot-on; George's guitar is more fluid and expressive than ever; Paul's voice is amazing and his thunderous bass-lines perhaps the best of his career; and Ringo lets loose and proves just why he was the drummer for the greatest band on earth. George Martin takes his last bow too: Abbey Road's production may be the best, most tasteful of any album - EVER!    And the music, you ask? Well, many of the songs appear incongruous on the surface, but they and Abbey Road itself are held together underneath by a uniting theme, intangible but omnipresent. Instrumentation, tone, and motifs are manipulated and flip-flopped throughout, often by different composers - for instance, John's dreamlike Sun King uses the same \\"tagline\\" as George's beautiful Here Comes the Sun but completely inverts the arrangement and tone. Or how about the juxtaposition of Ringo's jolly Octopus's Garden and John's dark, bluesy I Want You (She's So Heavy)? Brilliant! The Side II Medley is world-famous, and with good reason. The songs slide into another, building momentum and reprising passages and ideas (musical and otherwise) as adroitly as a classical piece. If only he could have gotten his way, Paul would have done the whole album like that!     As it stands, Abbey Road sweeps from music-hall goofiness to tender love songs to bristling hard-rockers to classical grandeur to pop perfection and back again without a hitch, culminating in a five-and-a-half-minute-long synthesis of everything good about rock & roll (Golden Slumbers/Carry That Weight/The End). The final couplet, \\"And in the end the love you take/Is equal to the love you make,\\" sums up the meaning of life, as far as I'm concerned. And the silly song-fragment Her Majesty tacked on at the very end is a perfect undercut, both hilarious in its irreverence, and maybe a bit profound in its placement and effect. In the space of forty-seven minutes Abbey Road transcends the boundaries of rock & roll, rising above it all as a true work of pop art. It immerses you, wholly and utterly, in its world. Until it ends and you return to ours, nothing exists except the music.    When I listen to music I go looking for an experience, and no album in popular music is a more powerful, moving, all-encompassing experience than Abbey Road. I could go on and on about the endless merits of this amazing, phenomenal record, but that would be pointless. If you have it, I'd be willing to give pretty good odds that you know what I'm talking about. If you don't own this album, you need to get it. Now. No classic rock fan's collection is complete without this crown jewel. Absolutely mind-blowing.
B000268QB2|5.0|I keep listening to the album since the day I bought it... it's really something. I'm not going to say the are greater or better than coldplay or radiohead because we are looking (listening) to their debut cd. we'll have to wait to see what the future tell us about them.. but I can say this debut cd compares or is even better than coldplay debut album.<br /><br />great lyrics, great armonic sense... the piano doesn't need nothing else (guitars and more guitars that sometimes are useless like here, and I'm a guitar player but I recognize this fact)... and their work with the fx synth is really something too... not just to fill empty spaces, they create spaces with it... the hit single \\"somewhere only we know\\" is, to my believe, one the best songs of the year and the decade... a natural born classic.
B00005UW9T|5.0|It was the night of a great ball at the palace and Anastasia Romanov and her father Nicholas, Czar of Russia were the center of attention as they danced together. Marie Romanov, the Dowager Empress of Russia had come to say goodbye before leaving to go to Paris. To make the separation more bearable, she had a music box made for Anastasia to sing her to sleep at night. It seemed as though it were the perfect evening, but suddenly a dark cloud loomed over the palace and Rasputin - who had been banished by the royal family - entered the party. He set a curse upon the Romanovs saying they would all die within the fortnight. Panic arose throughout the palace and the Romanovs ran for their lives. Separated from the family, Anastasia and her Grandmother ran to the train station to escape. Anastasia could not keep up and soon was lost on the streets of St. Petersburg and thought dead throughout all of Russia. <br /> <br />Ten years later, a rumor arises that Anastasia is alive. We meet Dimitri and Vladimir who are planning to find a girl to pretend to be Anastasia so they can recieve the large reward from the Dowager Empress, Marie. They find Anya - a young woman who is seaching for her past with only one clue: Paris. They convince her to come with them to Paris and meet Marie saying maybe she really is Anastasia and if so, she will have found her family at last. Rasputin realizes Anastasia is not dead and becomes furious. He sets off on a mission to kill her. <br /> <br />This is a wonderful film and I recomend it to anyone. It has the quality of the Disney Classics and has great music with great lyrics. With voices of famous stars such as Kelsey Grammar, Meg Ryan, and Christopher Lloyd, it is a great film for the whole family to enjoy.
0064407667|5.0|Read this book, and the following twelve, with or to your children. You may be wary at first of the dark themes put forth, but, as the story progresses, you'll be amazed at how smart your children are and how well they take in the fact that sometimes life is extremely hard and sad. The children in the series lose their parents in the first few pages, but, because of the circumstances surrounding their deaths and the wealth they leave behind, the children have no time to deal with that horrible loss. Instead, they are bombarded with vile villains and sinister plots. They pull together, and, with the use of their individual strengths and the strength they gain from each other, they come through unscathed...well, sort of. The books are a delight to read.

B000002H2H|5.0|No this isn't St. Anger. This is good. This album shows a young band still hungry and putting their talents to full use. \\"St. Anger\\" shows an old band desperate to get back its old fanbase. \\"Ride The Lightning\\" shows the band as the innovators and leaders they were. \\"St. Anger\\" shows a band willing to jump on a trend to look current. This is where they were true metal not \\"Nu metal\\".

B000267JQK|4.0|I bought Seether's debut, Disclaimer, in late May. I had seen the video Broken with Amy Lee, and thought 'eh, theyre pretty good'. I ended up buying it, and that album, along with some others, changed my tastes entirely. After that I got into the harder elemenents of music. For a while it was angsty stuff, but after a bit I got bored with that and moved on to the stuff that I still listen to and likely will for years to come and possibly the rest of my life. Real grunge(AIC, Screaming Trees, MLB, Soundgarden, etc.) and heavy metal. That album had great stuff on it, 69 Tea, Fine Again, Driven Under, Pig, the original Broken, and really the whole album. It's one of the few relics of my days as an angster that I still love. Only a little while after I bought it they decided to rerelease it with 8 new tracks. I stayed away for a while, because I thought that all the new songs would be similar to the new version of Broken. These days I hate that song, the original is much better. I ended up buying it just today. I noticed that they added a second guitar part to most of the songs. Sold Me is definatly a keeper song. It's a pretty good addition to my large cd collection, but I just want to know why they couldnt have waited until they had more songs and released a new full-length album? I'm sure the band probably lost fans because of this.

0385504209|5.0|'THE DA VINCI CODE' has spent the better part of almost two years on the top of the bestsellers list so if you haven't already read it I am sure that you at least know the basic plot line.  If not I am sure that the many reviews on this page have rehashed it for you so I am not going to.  I am just going to briefly say that I thoroughly enjoyed this book and while I see that there are many mixed reviews here (as there should be with anything this widely consumed) I urge you to purchase it, borrow it, or just somehow get your hands on a copy and judge for yourself.<br /><br />Several people have argued that for many the line between the fictional story and reality has been blurred and too much of this book has been taken for fact.  However, as someone who would never have looked into anything further than what I had been taught during my years in catholic school, I would have never been made privy to the fact that some of these ideas even existed much less had the chance to research any of these ideas myself.  I don't suggest that you believe everything in this book, it is a work of fiction, but if most of the topics discussed in this book are new to you, or if you just want to see what all of the hype is about, I do suggest that you read the book and if so inclined look into the theories discussed (as there are many books and web sites dedicated to just that) and form your own opinions from there.  To say the least this book is thought provoking and makes for a great book club discussion!
B00000DC7L|3.0|Brian Mays second (real) album is an improvement over Back To The Light due to Brian May putting more intencity into his vocals and improving the strangly bland and ordinary songwriting of that album (for the most part anyway). His guitar playing is fine just like it normally is. Unfortunatly theres too many covers on this album. The best music artists are the ones who feature no or only a few covers on their albums. Yes, Roger Taylor did do a few covers but only 2 and only on one album out of four studio albums. Freddie Mercury never had any covers on either of his two albums. It helped them to be original and interesting. One of the covers All The Way From Memphis is pretty silly too. Unfortunatly Brian May still has not made a fully credible studio album like Roger and Freddie managed to do but atleast he came close. He gets points for trying.
B0002OERI0|5.0|For starters, American Idiot is not a huge political statement, but a cd about personal relationships. Politics is just a side road.<br /><br />American Idiot has an underlying storyline for those of you that are unaware. It is also proclaimed a 'rock opera' by GD, much like the Who's \\"Tommy\\" or \\"Quadrophenia\\".<br /><br />My take on the album:<br /><br />American Idiot: An introduction to the setting and mood of the story; describes the current way of life in America and the issues some have with it.<br /><br />Jesus of Suburbia:<br /><br />I. Jesus of Suburbia: We are introduced to the main character, \\"Jesus of Suburbia,\\" so named because he's a typical suburban kid (there's nothing wrong with me, this is how i'm supposed to be): his parents are divorced, he sits around watching TV, and experiments with drugs. He feels an emptiness in his life.<br /><br />II. City of the Damned: Jesus' discontentment grows as he realizes the apathy of those surrounding him.<br /><br />III. I Don't Care: Jesus sees how widespread people's indifference is.<br /><br />IV. Dearly Beloved: Jesus notes the effect of this indifference on his own personal relationships.<br /><br />V. Tales of Another Broken Home: Fed up to the point of breaking, Jesus leaves home in search of meaning and a purpose in his life.<br /><br />Holiday: Jesus meditates on the problems with modern American government and society as he wanders the streets of the city to which he has run away.<br /><br />Boulevard of Broken Dreams: Jesus laments his lonliness in this new place. This song hints at the upcoming emergence of St. Jimmy (I'm walking down the line that divides me somewhere in my mind).<br /><br />Are We the Waiting: Still alone, Jesus wonders what will become of him. He comes to reject his identity (the Jesus of Suburbia is a lie) and decides to create a new one, leading to...<br /><br />St. Jimmy: The introduction of \\"St. Jimmy,\\" the punk street kid personality that Jesus invents to go along with his new life. This persona rejects the cushy suburban life led by Jesus; Jimmy is a violent, drug dealing, melevolant criminal. As Jimmy, he falls in with a crowd of like-minded youth in the city.<br /><br />Give Me Novocaine: In accordance with his new personality, Jesus/Jimmy becomes increasingly reliant on drugs.<br /><br />She's a Rebel: The introduction of \\"Whatsername,\\" an anarchist/punk girl that Jimmy meets and falls in love with. Her nonconformist ideals appeal greatly to Jimmy.<br /><br />Extraordinary Girl: Deals with Jimmy's frustration with his inability to express his true feelings for Whatsername, as well as the sadness and lonliness hidden underneath Whatsername's outwardly tough persona (she sees the mirror of herself, an image she wants to sell to anyone willing to buy ... she's all alone again, wiping the tears from her eyes).<br /><br />Letterbomb: Perhaps the most complex and important song on the album, as far as the story is concerned. Jimmy's new life and the lives of his new friends settle down into a kind of boring monotony, much like Jimmy's old life as Jesus of Suburbia. Whatsername, however, still longs for the unbridled anarchy (Where have all the b******* gone? ... Where have all the riots gone?). She's become as disillusioned with her current life as Jesus was with his at the beginning of the story. She harshly criticizes Jimmy, telling him--possibly via writing a letter, which would explain the song's title--that his new personality is just as empty as his old one, and neither is his true self (You're not the Jesus of Suburbia, the St. Jimmy is a figment of your father's rage and your mother's love). Fed up, much like Jesus was at the beginning of the story, Whatsername leaves town, leaving Jesus/Jimmy behind.<br /><br />Wake Me Up When September Ends: Jesus/Jimmy is alone again and depressed about Whatsername's decision to leave.<br /><br />Homecoming:<br /><br />I. The Death of St. Jimmy: A conflict between the character's two personalities in his own mind. It ends with the destruction of the \\"Jimmy\\" personality (Jimmy died today, he blew his brains out into the bay. In this state of mind is my own private suicide).<br /><br />II. East 12th St.: The Jesus persona is back, and leading the same kind of empty existence he fled from previously. He holds a boring job (Jesus filling out paperwork now at the facility on East 12th Street). He once again longs to escape, but remains stuck where he is.<br /><br />III. Nobody Likes You: Overcome once more with loneliness, Jesus sits alone and feels sorry for himself.<br /><br />IV. Rock and Roll Girlfriend: Once more longing to break free, Jesus has a midlife crisis and goes through a wild, \\"rock and roll\\" binge phase.<br /><br />V. We're Coming Home Again: Unable to find meaning in anything, Jesus returns to his boring, middle class suburban life (their time has come and it's gone nowhere, nobody ever said that life was fair). Basically, Jesus ends up right back where he started, older but not much wiser, unable to find the fulfillment and meaning in his life that he went searching for so long ago. However, even though the character basically ends up as the kind of \\"loser\\" he always wanted to avoid becoming, he does find some kind of comfort in returning to his original empty existence.<br /><br />Whatsername: After all is said and done, Jesus looks back at his life and wonders if Whatsername ever found the fulfillment he was never able to. Although he laments the fact that they did not end up together, and will likely always see her as \\"the one that got away\\" (there are strong indications that he misses her more for what she represented than for who she was, but it seems obvious that he does miss her: the regrets are useless, in my mind, she's in my head, i must confess), he takes comfort in remembering the times they shared.<br /><br />Well, that's just my interpretation of the story. It's probably not entirely right, and perhaps it's completely wrong, but it's what I got out of the lyrics. For what it's worth, I found it to be a compelling and satisfying story.own mind.

B0002IU988|1.0|First off if your going to change the lead singer give the group a differnt name why keep the same sound when scott stapp was in the group.  everyone knows that the reason why people are going to even buy the this cd id becuase of the sound.  scott stapp had the voice  it was strong and powerful scott stapp made the group every song he had writen and sang was just perfect in every way.  this miles kenndey dude is not going to make it the sound of band and his voices dont sound right. knowing that creed was out for about 7-8 years all thier cds made number #1. Alter Bridge is not going to make it unless they get a differnt sound.
B0006284JQ|1.0|Ok,when music that is this crappy is this popular,you know the end of the world is near...
B00005JMAH|5.0|this movie is the best of the 3. with tons of interesting themes, this easily beats out sorcerer's stone and chamber of secrets. get this now if you want to experience a wonderful adventure
B00003CXTG|5.0|I disagree totally with the reviewers who think this is a terrible movie! What I like so much about this movie is that (much like \\"Titanic\\"), the historic events surrounding the attack on Pearl Harbor are interwoven with the personal tale of the main characters' lives. It engaged me completely, and I found the storyline to be completely believable and touching. Yes, it's a plot that has been used many times before, but that doesn't make it less effective. Love triangles are a classic ploy -- that's why they are so effective! I say, give this movie a chance, and you won't be disappointed.
B000002B5L|5.0|I was familiar with the individual artists of the Fugees before I had really heard the group together. All I can say is \\"wow\\". The amazing ability of each of these artists has always impressed me, but when they are together something as awesome as \\"The Score\\" is created. All 15 tracks incorporate awesome beats and better lyrics that flow effortlessly. If you are at all into Hip-hop, this CD is DEFINATELY worth buying.
B000068IEU|1.0|All these grand reviews, are you kidding?, this is junk!, stupid premise, really stupid dialog, and the characters are paper thin, the cops, there are no cops this stupid anywhere, run out of gas?, none in the trunk?, did they leave the police radio on the checker board? please! I couldn't figure if this was a comedy or, choke, serious?, we really got a lot of laughs from it! It was plain to see it was shoot on a shoestring and his efforts did get better in later films, but, this was awful!
B000000WA2|4.0|more great songs from Blur. great packaging, superb musicianship and brilliant  lyrics. with 15 songs, there is *almost* too much good music here to fully digest in one sitting. and sometimes these songs seem to be jagged or too aloof to really enjoy; but then you'll find yourself humming the melodies in your head and you'll have to go back and listen again and again. finely crafted pop songs with a huge dose of english humor and healthy sarcasm. \\"The Universal\\" is probably my favorite Blur song of all time, but there are plenty of other great ones here like \\"Stereotypes,\\" \\"Charmless Man,\\" and \\"He Thought Of Cars.\\" and is it just me; or does \\"Best Days\\" sound like it may have hugely influenced some songs in the Radiohead canon?
B000089RVX|1.0|This band is terrible, the vocals are so annoying.  Just another overated band, just like that band of pansies, Linkin Park. If you want good music get Pink Floyd: Dark Side of the Moon, or if your a metal head get Tool's: Lateralus, or Aenima.
B0002Z9HT8|4.0|For me this is worth the price of admission for a second time. In 1985, I was 22 and can still remember waiting to get into JFK stadium on a sunny, hot, humid Philly morning. I recall Joan Baez opening the day with Amazing Grace (she welcomed us to our generation's Woodstock). This was coupled as a one two punch with The Hooters rousing: AND WE DANCED. What an unforgettable day and night of great rock and roll! I remember the concession stands running out of water and the fires hoses cooling down the crowds during the day. But at night when the sun went down, the old stadium rocked with a greater intensity. Phil Collins jumped on a Concorde after playing Wembley in London and played Philly that same evening. Whoa! In 1985 that was quite a feat! I remember the Led Zep reunion with (I seem to recall) John Bonhams's son and Phil Collins on drums. Awesome! JFK stadium rocked and roared with the opening riffs of Rock and Roll. Talk about an R&R moment that made the literal hairs on the back of your neck rise -not to mention goosebumps the moment caused. Too bad the LED Zep set is not included. The CREAM reunion (of sorts) and White Room was another great moment. I remember TP and the Heartbreakers, Bryan Adams, Mick Jagger and Tina Turner along with all the great artists. There were lousy satellite connections to London on the big screen. So having highlights of the London show on this DVD is a plus for me -not to mention having the Band Aid video. Only days later, after Philly -and in replays- could I clearly see the emotional impact of Bono hugging a girl in the audience during U2's set (in London) during the song Bad. Months later, In NJ, I caught up with Joe Piscopo at a signing of his comedy album New Jersey and he signed my LIVE AID program. He was one of the mc's and he was very happy to also sign the program (which I framed with my concert ticket stub). So on one hand, having been there (and got the proof) and having great memories -I was reluctant to buy this DVD after hearing what has been left out. Then again I wanted it -if only to refresh the snapshots held in my mind for almost twenty years. The power of this dvd of is that is a testimonial of the great cause it served and the way the music united the world that day. This dvd will take you back to a moment in time when we felt united. We were a generation that was changing the world for the better and knew we could make a difference. Yes, mine is the generation that said: We Are the World. The Live Aid dvd brings it home again for my generation and future generations! The collective cultural, political and artistic impact of Live Aid endures. The dvd will evoke fond, passionate, and great memories of that music filled day in the summer of 1985, when the world came together. Why Led Zep thought their set was not good enough to include here is beyond me. Thank you to Sir Bob Geldof! God Bless -we have not forgotten you! [...] I would have given this 5 stars if the Philly and London show (the day) had been released in its entirety. Nonetheless, this LIVE AID DVD set will take you back to a truly magical, trancendental moment in the 1980s. This dvd is a keeper for any collector and rock and roll fan.
B00005JNLY|4.0|Written and directed by James Brooks, this film (which I saw as a \\"sneak preview\\") is touching and generally well written, with good acting.  There are funny scenes in the film,  but I felt the dramatic moments were at least as important. The film is a poignant portrayal of several people, and the relationships they have with each other.  Paz Vega is wonderful as a young, single mother, who migrates illegally from Mexico, and settles in Los Angeles.  Her daughter is attracted by \\"the better life\\" of Anglo America, which leads to some conflicts with her mother.  Vega is employed by the Claskys as a housekeeper, although she doesn't know any English (after six years in the US), and she gradually forms bonds with some of the family members, and conflicts with the neurotic, intrusive wife (played by T&eacute;a Leoni).  Adam Sandler is excellent as Leoni's husband--a world-class chef, who loves his family, but is unhappy with his marriage.  I was impressed by his performance, which was real and sensitive.  Cloris Leachman also does fairly well in a supporting role as Leoni's mother, as do two child actresses, Shelbie Bruce and Sarah Steele.  One role that should have been eliminated from the script is that of Sandler's son (whom we never get to know).  An interesting fact is that Vega didn't speak or understand any English when she arrived in LA to play the part, and learned it (as did her character) as the film was shot chronologically.  Great in Pedro Almodovar's  \\"Talk to Her, \\" the Spanish actress does very well in this drama/comedy.  The script could be a bit tighter, but this is a fine film, and well worth your time and money.
0618001905|5.0|While telling the story of one of the last pre-World War I colonizations, this book covers the gamut of human sentiments, from love to greed to curiosity to self-sacrifice.  Hochshchild is a good storyteller, and he has a great cast of characters to work with.  I knew roughly as much about Congo before reading this book as Hochschild knew before writing it: I had read Heart of Darkness, and figured that the events it portrayed were an exercise in the grotesque.  Thanks to Hochschild's book, I now have a much better understanding of the atrocities that actually happened under colonial rule.  But this book actually is uplifting, because of what Hochschild points out is the distinguishing feature of the Congo colonial story: not the atrocities (which happened in many other colonies) but the successful international humanitarian campaign that pressured Belgium to clean up house.  The rise of Amnesty International and other human rights campaigns and organizations later in the twentieth century is something that I understand better now, after reading Hochschild's story of Edmund Morel, Roger Casement, and others.  The increasing profile and influence of human rights campaigns is one of the best reasons to be optimistic about the future of world affairs, and so in the end I am more optimistic after reading \\"King Leopold's Ghost.\\"
B00004YB9Y|5.0|I really did not like this album when I first played it, but now I love it. The last three years I really have been playing this more than any other Christmas album I own, and I own a lot. That initial reaction I guess was that the operatic voices and powerful orchestration seemed out of place for the simple Christmas tunes that we always hear being crooned. And, yes, fractured English such as \\"I be home for Christmas\\" bothered me. But now I'm used to it and overall I find the album lovely and inspiring to listen to.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|Personally I totally dislike metal music from the horrible screaming and grunting (it's definatly not singing...or music for that matter) to the retarded band names and song titles that bring to mind eating people or setting someone aflames.  I'd sooner listen to country music than I would that crap.  Moving on, I always thought Slipknot was just another one of those horrible metal groups, but then I listened to them(in fact this is the only \\"metal\\" band I listen to).  Corey Taylor actually has lyrical talent.  No way, this can't be.  This is supposed to be metal.  Call it what you will, it sounds a whole lot better than any of that other noise I've ever heard.  The other band members seem to bring it all together quite nicely too.  Their music just draws me in.  Gotta say, I love to work out and listening to their music, new and old, is a great adrenaline booster for those heavier sets.  Anyways, say what you will about Slipknot.  I could actually care less about whether they sold out or went commercial or whatever.  Who gives a rats a$$.  Their music still sounds ten times better than any of that other crap-metal out there.  Like I said, you either love em or Hate em.
0671027387|2.0|I studied planetary geology in college.  I even had some stints working and doing research with a couple of different NASA groups.  I dove into Deception Point excited to see if Dan Brown could weave the same kind of story with science as he could with art and history.<br /><br />The book starts out very interesting but there are huge glaring mistakes that any student in Geology 101, or \\"Rocks for Jocks,\\" would notice.  **SPOILER ALERT**  Meteorites that come from the asteroid belt are all 4.6 billion years old, no younger, because they were formed at the beginning of the solar system and have undergone virtually no changes since then.  Any meteorite found that is less than 4.6 billion years old would very definitely be an important find, with or without fossils.  There are several examples of these younger meteorites, and because of their age (among other things), scientists have deduced that they come from the Moon, and even Mars.  It would have made much more sense to say that the meteorite in Deception Point was supposedly from another planet, rather than interplanetary space.<br /><br />This one huge glaring scientific error truly ruined the book for me.  I almost threw the book away half-read except that I hoped that this error would be addressed later on, perhaps as reason for determining the meteorite was a fake.  Alas, I was disappointed.<br /><br />The pace and action are all great in this book, regardless of the bad science.  The descriptions and uses of surveillance and other technologies kept me turning the pages.  The book was basically well-written and interesting, just badly researched.<br /><br />One last note, a scene where two people drifting in the freezing ocean on an iceberg suddenly being rescued by a surfacing submarine smacked very loudly of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.  Did the submarine have an Improbability Drive?

0684135051|5.0|I got this book years ago, and have nearly worn the cover and several of the pages to nubs. It's taken me from a klutzy non-knitter (whose needles were used as plant stakes) to being able to whip out an afghan in a week, make booties without patterns, hats flow...and my family is WARM! Elizabeth Zimmerman makes it easy to create those glorious knits you see on others, by giving you the courage to try! One line at a time, one line at a time, and soon, voila! A sweater that FITS!
B0000E1WKE|4.0|Whitney Houston is back on her way to stardom after a long and tedious journey with drugs and marital woe. This Super Diva once ruled sumpreme over all women Divas and is still highly respected in the eyes of many. With a strong and steady fan base her recovery is begining and she is holding more firm than ever-before. This Christmas Album however, doesnot unveil Whitney's true potential that was revealed in the successess of her other great albums. This type of singing should be left up to Jessica Simpson or Christian Augilera or better yet Beyonce. We all anticipated a better performance that obviously was not presented. Whitney is just human and thus one failure or several bumps in the road I seriously doubt will ruin Arista and Clive Davis stop singer and artist. I do hope this indication of the Super Diva's return point out that there is more and better to come. But hold on Whitney and like  you once said , each day am not the strongest nor weakest but like the chains of Amistad I won't break. Beware Mariah, Beyonce and Alicia for the Super Diva is back and about to reclaim her place.
B0006AZMFM|5.0|This album is another inspirational and emotional journey. Each track has it's own uplifting message whether it be the song about love 'Out of the Blue' or the song about courage and strength 'Be Strong', you really know her heart is in it. And it's a refreshing change from the usual manufactured pop which dribbles from the mouths of Britney and Christina. <br /> <br />Some of my favorite tracks are 'Mistaken Identity', 'Be Strong', 'Electrical Storm' and 'Last night on Earth'. If you loved her first album you will love this and if you need something more in your life than 'Oops I did it again' give this a listen. She's the pride of Australia because she's a down-to-earth, genuine beauty but also because she has an amazing talent. I hope you all can love her as much as we do.
B00063EMJG|4.0|Neil Young - Greatest Hits<br /><br />Most of the reviewers feel the same way that I do, great choices, but some truly great songs missing. So much for the first one-disc compilation of this astonishingly prolific musician. As any fan of Neil Young knows, the only constant in Young's work is to expect sudden shifts in current and a sharp turn of the rudder. Still though, I think that there are reasons to buy this disk. First of all, Greatest Hits might be ideal for the fan who doesn't know where to start. But, even then I'd probably steer them toward \\"Decade\\", which makes both musical and chronological sense and offers a more cohesive flow, even if it ends much earlier then this CD. There isn't much on the DVD-Video in terms of content. There are only two tracks with videos, \\"Rockin' in the Free World\\" and \\"Harvest Moon\\". Each track has the option for viewing the lyrics, a still photo, & the orginal album track listing or title, but not a whole lot more! So don't buy the DVD version if you are expecting a lot of different content.<br /><br />There is another reason for even the most ardent fan to consider buying this collection. Sound. The sound quality of this CD easily surpasses every version of these songs that you have ever heard. Painstakingly remastered, for both conventional Audio CD, and available with a companion DVD-Video version of each track, this set hints at what is to be a complete remastering of the entire Young catalog. For notes on the precise equipment used for the process, just visit Young's ([...]) website, which will force you to figure out how to find the proper link.. hint, think license plate.<br /><br />What is interesting about this remastering is what they didn't do. Namely they didn't try too hard to clean up noise and other artifacts. This isn't Pro-Tools on parade. While these versions offer that sense of sitting in the studio without anything between you and the musicians, this isn't a sterile, or overly noise-reduced remastering. The first several tracks have a ton of noise, some of which I imagine to be old-fashioned, pre-Dolby tape noise, and some of the noise seems to be just the noise of the amplifiers, pickups, and other bits. So.. this is a really accurate restoration, not a scrubbed clean and modernized version. So, while I might have enjoyed a version with a bit less noise, and a bit of extra punch added to the dynamic range, it is a damn wonderful job, even if a bit odd in the modern climate of making 30 year old recordings sound like they were recorded yesterday. But on this, it's as if someone pulled the cotton out of your ears. The audio stage is beautiful, warm, and transparent. The bass is solid and the guitar solos cut through the air with tact sharp precision.<br /><br />The DVD-Video version is another thing altogether. From reading various reviews on Amazon, it seems that most folks don't seem to understand exactly what DVD-Audio (or SACD for that matter!) is, and what type of equipment is required to play it back. Simply put, those two formats are an attempt to create an \\"audiophile\\" digital music format, utilizing different technologies and approaches, for pretty much the same aural experience, which is a recording and mastering at a much higher bit rate, and resolution. In order to actually hear this, you need a player that is equipped for DVD-Audio playback, which only a handful of players can actually do. Although there are some low cost models that are surprisingly good, starting with the Pioneer DV-578-A, which is the lowest cost \\"universal\\" player that I know of. \\"Universal\\" players are capable of playing all the normal formats, but also DVD-Audio and SACD. However, all high bit players require you to use their 6 analog outputs to your \\"Multi-Channel\\" inputs on your receiver, and every model I've seen use varying, and mostly lousy approaches to how the Bass signal is managed, hence the term \\"bass management\\" used in their specs.<br /><br />Ok, so is it worth it spend the extra bucks for the DVD-Video version? If you have a DVD compatible player, I think it is. The difference is subtle, and you must have some seriously good equipment to really hear the difference, but if you do, then the sense of time-travel these tracks offer is wonderful and enlightening. And of course there are the visuals. However, for a real Neil Young fan, at least for this one, the track selections are a bit maddening. And I think that to really experience Young's work in high-resolution sound, try out the amazing 5.1 DVD-Audio and Surround Sound version of \\"Harvest\\", which is simply breathtaking. And the interview with Young on the disc is great. It will play on any DVD player, and with a player capable of DVD-A, you can hear the high-resolution version. Even though this unfortunately isn't a DVD-Audio release, which in itself is a strange decision, at least on my system it has a different sound quality then the CD version. Probably due in part to the difference in using the analog Multi-Channel outputs vs. the digital coax output on my player.<br /><br />As for me, I'm looking forward to \\"Decade\\" and some of the earlier catalog releases to be reissued with the new remastering. Ironically, one thing that the new releases point out, is that the original CD releases of Young's work were very respectably mastered in the first place! Remember that the choices made here, are incredibly cognizant. Just as Young's recent Greendale movie was low tech in feel and technology (8mm movie film!) to get it's story across, the soundtrack was recorded with among the highest audio resolution quality technology available anywhere on the planet! So, even the decision to release this CD, with it's somewhat strange track listing, it's painstakingly remastered audio, and a normal DVD-Video is as much a technological choice, as it is an artistic choice. Young, obviously, is in control, and letting us know it. So, until the rest of his catalog is released, pick this up, make sure you have something decent to listen to it on, and crank it up!n?

B000059XUI|5.0|My friends and I still quote that line and will probably keep doing it for the rest of our lives. (Yeah, there's a chance we may be geeks.)<br /><br />Is there a better villian than General Zodd in any other movie based on a comic book??? No, I don't think so. Zodd ruled!<br /><br />I also kind of dig his partner Ursa. She's a very hot super villian-ette (not sure if that's really a word - I may have just invented it.)<br /><br />There's nothing I can say bad about this movie. Christopher Reeve was fantastic in this, as was everyone else in the cast. The story is very good. It's got a great mix of action, romance,humor and adventure.<br /><br />As great as the original Superman movie was, I think this one was even better.
B000089CJI|2.0|In indie music circles, fans tend to protect the work of their heroes with motherly rabidity, even if it is not entirely justified. Ben Gibbards stab at electronic pop is no different. I was never overly impressed with his efforts in Death Cab for Cutie, but for foot tapping melodic pop, i thought that Death Cab ranged from catchy to merely passable. The Postal Service, on the otherhand, sounds like a man just trying to do something entirely different just for the sake of doing so. His pop sensibilities adapt rather shabbily to electronica and creates a gutless form of techno-pop that seems suitable only for 13 year old school girls who are doped up on pixie-stix. This is indie music at its most tooth-achingly mainstream.
B00004YTZE|5.0|After eagerly anticipating my boldness to bite the bullet and purchase the relatively expensive import C.D., I finally picked it up last night.  And after listening to it over and over already, it is safe to say this is certainly one of the best punk albums of all-time.  Anyone initiated with Johnny Thunders knows that he is the epitime of a wrecking-ball rock 'n' roller.  The tunes on this album, sloppy, loud, fast, and yet still hopeless romatic, play like Rolling Stones demos if they had rocked a little harder and lived a little bit wilder.  The fourteen tracks on this album are each fantastic, especially \\"Born To Lose\\", the Dee Dee Ramone-written drug song \\"Chinese Rock\\" (originally the Ramones thought it too blatant to put on one of their albums, so Dee Dee let Thunders do it, and it later appeared on their Spector-produced \\"End Of The Century\\"), \\"I Wanna Be Loved\\" (Not the Elvis Costello tune), \\"Get Off The Phone\\", and the all-out rocking cover of \\"Do You Love Me.\\"  The production is perfectly raw.  They play their instruments and sing as though they've been doing it for five days straight, and they don't wanna slow down.  To put it simply, this album is very necassary to anybody who likes punk-rock, or simply rock 'n' roll with an edge.
B0002IQHY8|2.0|This was my first introduction to the work of Alan Parsons.  I am not really a prog enthusiast, but rather someone who quite likes classic Yes and who has been into electronic music for about 10-12 years.  I founf this album fairly disappointing.  Most of the album is derivative and lacklustre.  I'm sure for APP fans who haven't listened to much electronic music this probably seems fresh and vibrant, but from someone approaching it from the other side, it is anything but.  For someone who is interested in seeing how another progressive musician made the crossover to doing electronic music, I'd encourage you all to check out what Robert Fripp (formerly of King Crimson and others) has been doing with some of his side projects with Brian Eno and also the FFWD project with Alex Paterson of The Orb.  Also recommended: System 7, with Steve Hillage's wonderful guitar work.
0385507755|5.0|Wonderful Book! This is the Story of James Frey's Journey Through The Hell Called Rehab.I have never had the addiction but it doesnt sound pretty..I cried for him and cheered for him..Its a very deep moving book and If James can beat drugs as much as he went through anyone can..This book should be put in every Rehab in the country! I look forward to a sequal! Good Luck Mr Frey!
B00005JMAH|4.0|Aaaah, the 3rd book of the Harry Potter series...by far one of the best(I preferred books 4 and 5) so far. However, if they were to truly make the movie based on the book, then we'd have a movie well over 3 or 4 hours. Now, as much as I like a book and want the movie to go in accordance with the original script (book), I don't want to have to sit in a theater seat for more than 3 1/2 hrs. So, although I was disappointed when I saw the premiere, after buying the DVD and watching it couple times over and going over the directors' commentaries as well as JK Rowling, I guess they did an all right job.  Now if JK Rowling (who had her say in the making of the movie as far as what she wanted)was satisfied with the overall making of the movie, then I can't complain...but I do hope the director for The Goblet of Fire can make a movie that is worth the book.... <br /> <br />All in all, I think Alfonso Cuaron did a fairly decent job, considering he was not there for the first two....I think people who are fans of the Harry Potter series should purchase this DVD. It does follow the plot of the book as much as possible and though certain parts were put out of context, I did like how the director managed to show how our characters were entering their teenage years, and developing into their own. <br />

B0002S947K|5.0|I tripped and fell into this guy and his CD; meaning it was a total accident that I found him.  I was on the RCA homepage looking up something else and they had him on the main page.  He didn't look like a typical \\"musician\\", meaning he wasn't all slicked out and trendy.  He had a head of dark hair, a full beard and deep, dark eyes.  The picture was of him in a field standing infront of the sun.  I read his shortened biography and was intrigued.  I went to his website and listened to \\"Trouble\\", \\"Shelter\\", and \\"Jolene\\".  I'm not kidding or exaggerating that when I heard that first draw of the word \\"trouble\\" be seemingly pulled from him on the title track I thought \\"I HAVE to have this CD, like right NOW!\\"  I was HOOKED.  It took me a while to get a hold of it, and I listened to it and was blown away.  I thought \\"Listening to this must have been what it felt like to be around in the '60's and hear Janis Joplin, Bob Dylan or Joni Mitchell for the first time.\\"  There's a rawness to his voice, a visceral ache that comes through unfiltered and unfettered.  It's hard to listen to this CD and not cry.  That's in a good way, meaning his trouble is a trouble we all have felt in our lives.  I don't know if I can pick a favorite song, except that \\"Hold You In My Arms\\" really got to me, so did \\"Shelter.\\"  The title track \\"Trouble\\" is fantastic too.  \\"Burn\\" is hard to listen to because it just overflows with with quiet torture of loss.  \\"Jolene\\" is also one of the ones I listen to over and over.  His voice is a little different sounding.  It's a really good song about being sorry for hurting someone you love by not loving them back just because you have no idea how.  Very emotive.  But, the one that really, really affected me and does no matter how much I listen to it is the last ballad \\"All The Wild Horses\\", an ode to holding onto your dignity and character despite what you go through during your life (at least that's what I got from it...).  I also have to mention the cover arton the CD intrigued me and I wanted to buy it to see more.  I love the cobra and the cala lily intertwined in the inside of the CD cover.  Very appropriate for the theme of this CD.  I honestly can't wait to hear his next CD.  Ray Lamontagne is a rare, rare gem.  A true self-made diamond in the rough in a sea of fakes.   <br />One more honorable mention is \\"Forever My Friend\\"...I heard the first few notes and felt like I'd stepped back in time.  I like the foray he takes into the upper range of his register in parts of this song.  There is no doubt that this CD will be one I'm still listening to 20, even 30 years from now.  Hopefully, so will a lot of other people.  It's just very different from what I grew up listening to.  I was in gradeschool during the '80's heyday of arena rock and pop (Michael Jackson, Duran Duran, Loverboy, Journey......) and while that music is brilliant and unabashedly cheesy at times, this CD just steps across time with no apologies and takes you to a time when music was about exorcising your feelings and making a piece of art.  It's the way the songs are delivered that makes them so powerful on this CD.  It's the quiet reflectiveness that sounds so beautiful.  Most other artists are constantly trying to outdo one another with the Star Search notes and that just gets annoying because not everyone can hold a note for 20 seconds and not gag on it.  Sometimes, simplicity and directness have a power that nothing else can compare to.
B00005JRX0|4.0|AC/DC deliver there trade mark song composing again in this brilliant Rock N Roll album. when the new millenium was upon us, Angus and Malcolm decided to release what other's wernt, a good straight simple Rock N Roll album. Going back to there inspiraation, you hear the Junior Wells influence in the Title track, and an approach they havent used iin year in the song House Of Jazz, prooving that even without Power Chords, AC/DC can still make a song rock. OF course songs like Safe In New York City and Satalite Blues are pure examples of AC/DC writing the best of the simple riffs that just knock your socks off. A couple of the songs like House Of Jazz and Cant Hold Me Back I did not like at first, but they are just like any other AC/DC song, give them time, and they grow on you! <br /> <br />The only downfall I have towards this album is that it is only about 40 minutes long! And on the TOUR edition, with the bonus disk, there is a song that didnt make the LP \\"Cyberspace\\" and it defnitly should have been included with the album, along with the other unreleased tracks from the same recording session of SUL, \\"The #### Crows\\", \\"Rave On\\", \\"Let It Go\\" & \\"Whistle Blower. So lets hope they get released some day, maybe when this title gets re-mastered in future? <br /> <br />I wouldnt recomend this album to anyone just getting into AC/DC, This album is more for the AC/DC fan really, it will depend on tastes of music to decifer wether you would like it or not, but it is a straight out rock n roll album, composed by the formulas The Young brothers are so great at doing.  <br /> <br />ANd please note, that even tho Amazon has it written that is a live track, thats not correct, CYBERSPACE is a studio recording. <br /> <br />Rock On
B00065JTBA|5.0|There's so much to say about this album. So many great songs. I'm proud to say i'm a Bon Jovi fan. If you come to think about it, all of this song didn't make any album, and believe me, they are all great. This is trully a Box Set. You can't go wrong with this one. So many different songs, for every mood. Thumbs up to this album and thumbs up to Bon Jovi. Great band.

0393035158|5.0|I can not say enough for the rigorous, thoughtful manner in which Sam Harris presents his ideas in this most timely of books.  Harris' daring willingness to expose the patent absurdity of so many religious beliefs- beliefs that many people for some reason view as beyond the pale of rational analysis- lays bare the foundation of unreason behind so much of the world's current (and past) suffering.  His argument is not so much against any particular system of belief, as much as it is against the disastrous human ability to form and maintain beliefs that have absolutely no evidentiary basis in fact. <br />     For years, I have waited for someone to make Harris' exact points.  How can a species capable of creating the internet still subscribe to beliefs as absurd as the idea that the Pope is by definition infallible, or that those who believe different belief systems must be killed?  (These examples, from Catholicism and Islam, are just two that are examined in detail.)When will the human race escape the shackles of its primitive credulity?  The only way is for smart, critically-minded people to remind the public constantly of the tragic consequences of faith-based thinking.  Harris does his part.  I hope that readers of this book will do theirs.
B0006IUDXA|5.0|Great to see this very nice series on DVD. I just hope that Paramount includes Spanish audio and/or subtitles, and I'll fall in love and get all the series when out.<br />This series marked an era in the 80's and 90's and is a superb in entertainment for all the family.<br /><br />Update: No spanish subtitles, too bad, will not purchase it.
0679720200|5.0|Camus' _The Stranger_ does illustrate what existentialism in practice is. As the protagonist, Muersault is faced with what most would consider major life events: the death of his mother, the prospect of a job relocation to Paris, a woman asking him to marry her, murder and a trial he responds with a nonchalance that is disturbing, accepting the actions as part of life, and with the realization that there is very little he can do about them.  Yet the novella is also an exploration of the absurd, as Muersault's nonplussed reactions prompt absurd reactions from those around him.  Indeed, Muersault's choice to exist - to not attempt to influence or change any of the situations he finds himself in - is absurd.<br /><br />The book is both frustrating and insightful and was a worthwhile read.  It gives a much clearer understanding of existentialism than any essay of Sartre's, with an almost sarcastic undertone provided by the sheer absurdity of the plot.
0671027387|5.0|This is the third Dan Brown book I have read thus far.  So far I have not been disappointed in any of his works.  Deception Point is a fast paced thriller that will keep you glued to the pages from front to back. I found myself reading too much at home and at work.  I can honestly say I didn't get much sleep until I was done with this book.<br /><br />Dan Brown does a great job of blending science and fiction together to create a fast paced almost realistic thriller.  Although everything in this book may not be 100% accurate it definately keeps you guessing up until the very last page to see what is going to happen.<br /><br />I reccomend this read for anyone that is looking for a good book to read in your free time but be carefull you may not be able to put it down.

B00005JKC3|4.0|I am more interested in the making of this movie more than the movie itself.  When it was revealed that Ang Lee was to direct this blockbuster, few eye-brows were raised of the choice.  If we sit through the making of the film, it was explained that he's needed to bring sense and sensibility to one of Marvel Comic's most successful franchise.  In the end, we end up with a movie that is neither nor.  It's just the way it is and expectedly, fingers are pointed.  Rumours started to spread about cast and production crews were tense working under a Director who was tunnel-visioned in actualising his vision (nothing wrong with that).  The making of the movie also divulged to us Ang Lee's donning of rubbery suits with sensors on them to feed datas to ILM's software to create the Hulk that he envisioned, & his involvements in the music creation (Ang Lee kept reminding Danny Elfman that his music score should be less Danny Elfman's).  For Ang Lee, the making of this movie is a challenge, to tackle something that he hasn't tackled before. For him, that means trying to merge the art of comics with the art of films and trying to portray the characters here in a three dimensional manner rather than cutboard characters from comics.  Ang Lee endeavoured to give us an insight into Banner and his alter-ago, his tulmutous relationship with his father (played brilliantly by Nick Nolte) who was really a mad scientist who played God, the forbidden love between Banner and Ross (Jennifer Connelly's character).  Sam Elliot was brilliant as a General who was dead-heat in pursuing and terminating Hulk.  He's not a Captain Ahab of Moby Dick's fame but rather, a humane General who was simply doing his job, to the resentment of his daughter, Ross who wanted to reconcile the relationship between the daughter and the father.  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  I respect the fact that a lot of thoughts and efforts have gone into making this a commendable adult comic movie.  I guess as a result, itbecomes the victim of its own success.  People commented about the incredulity of Hulk flying on the air, of him jumping for joy in the Grand Canyon, not being faithful to the comics offering, of the unrealistic projection of the CGI Hulk.  However, if people can see beyond the fact that the CGI is simply a part of the total sum, then, people would start to appreciate how tragic this movie actually is.  This is a undeniably an ambitious movie.  I think Ang Lee has achieved his brief of making an adult movie out of a comic strips but majority of the audience actually wants a candy pop no brainer action movie.  All I can say is that the studio has misread the sentiment of the public and the fault is not with Ang for he did his bit brilliantly, perhaps, too brilliantly.  Commendable effort.
B0002OERI0|1.0|What's with all this praise for American Idiot?  This album continues the streak of Green Day's crappy albums.  Gone are the days from their decent albums, like Dookie (which, even that, wasn't particularly good, but at least it was tolerable). <br /> <br />You all act like this CD is great because it's a rock opera.  This is a piss-poor attempt at a rock opera.  You want real rock opera?  Look into Aryeon.  Arjen Anthony Lucassen (Aryeon) does far better rock operas than Green Day could ever hope to produce.  For those of you into heavy metal, look into Opera IX. <br /> <br />Continuing on, these guys are hypocrites.  I believe one part of the song American Idiot, they talk about people and how they shouldn't be controlled by the media.  Yet, the only reason they released this CD was to influence as many people as people.  Hypocrisy doesn't impress me. <br /> <br />Bottom line:  save your money.  Don't waste it on this crap.  If you're looking for a rock opera, like I said above, go buy Aryeon's Human Equation.  If you're just looking for something that you can listen to in the car, buy any other CD.  Buy Linkin Park's Hybrid Theory, RA's From One; if you like metal, Chimaira's Impossibility of Reason, Lamb of God's Ashes of the Wake.  Hell, buy a Nirvana CD.  A Led Zeppelin CD.  Or even AC/DC.  If you're just looking to spend your money, buy your boyfriend/girlfriend/husband/wife something.  They'll appreciate it more than this garbage.
0767827694|4.0|The movie starts with Tilda Swinton playing Orlando, a male role (so far), and Quentin Crisp playing Queen Elizabeth. Already, physical sex and social gender have been neatly divided. Later on, Orlando abruptly transforms from man to woman with no reason or mechanism given. S/he takes it in stride, but her place in her social world changes around her. Given the magical premise, it's an effective way to comment on the attitudes of men and women towards each other, based on complete and mutual ignorance.<br /><br />There was only one small problem with the casting. Swinton is just too lovely a woman to play even an androgynous male convincingly. It took some effort to go along with Tilda the man, but it was worth it for the sake of the plot.<br /><br />And, if nothing else, I could always watch the incredible costuming and scenery. Architecture and landscaping seemed to have quiet lives of their own, tolerating the people that moved among them. Many scenes were chosen for strong, almost confrontational symmetries, something that definitely attracted my attention. Another scene near the end actually costumed the landscape, Christo-like, for reasons I never worked out. There were a number of night scenes, too, and many seemed to be filmed using natural light. Those scenes often had a grainy look, but not enough to be distracting.<br /><br />This is an odd movie, but I like it. Swinton's little asides to the camera, sometimes just a glance, added a quirky note. It's a thoughtful movie, about tone and appearance rather than action, and delivers well in those areas. However much I like it, though, I come away a bit unsure what to make of it. Maybe that's why I keep coming back to it.<br /><br />//wiredweird
B000003TAR|5.0|From the opening line of Serve The Servants,[teenage angst has paid off well], to the repeated outro of All Apologies,[all in all is all we are], Nirvana's final studio LP is a lyrical masterpiece. Dark, heavy riffs combined with Dave Grohl's <br />aggressvie drumming patterns serve as a perfect backdrop to Cobain's tortured state of mind and strong resentment toward anything mainstream. Already nominated the voice of a generation after the mind blowing success of Nevermind, which was never intended, Kurt seemed to go to great lengths to avoid that with this record and the finished result was astounding. In doing this Nirvana's fan base took a hit, evident by Pearl Jam's VS. outdueling In Utero in Soundscan figures, although In Utero was a much superior record. Scentless Apprentice borderlines on insanity with the repeated chorus of GO AWAY screamed over a rising guitar riff. The lead single Heart Shaped Box deals with Kurt's growing heroin addiction with lines such as \\"Forever in doubt to your priceless advice\\", as well as, \\" I wish I could eat your cancer when you turn black\\". Nevermind surely had the bigger hits[ Teen Spirit, Come As You Are, Lithium], but In Utero was the better package of the two. As raw as it can get, [thanks to Steve Albini], this album is a standing testament to what raw emotion can mean to music. With the sad shape of today's rock and the overall dominance of hip hop in mainstream it is unclear if we'll ever hear another rock band with this kind of magnitude but if someday we do hopefully their frontman will be better prepared for it than Cobain was. Fan or no fan, it has become obvious that popular music has not been the same since '94. What a tragedy.
0316666343|3.0|I went to school with Alice Sebold, so I was curious to read this, though I didn't know her well. I hesitated for over a year due to the subject, because I have a 14 yr old daughter. The first third of the book was difficult and moving as a parent, but well-written --the stuff of great literature. Halfway through the book it disappointingly retreats to mediocrity. The already thin characters struggle to prove their worthiness to the reader. The theme fades in and out. Details don't make sense--in one scene it's summer, but they build a fire to keep warm. Other scenes leave you scratching your head searching for the relevancy to the theme. Overall I enjoyed the book, but felt it could have either used another edit or been much shorter. The biggest injustice to Ms. Sebold was by the publisher's marketing on the back cover of the paperback which states something like \\"A Jack Grissham like page turner.\\" Ms. Sebold writes much better than Mr. Grisham.

There are many great song on this cd, but the ones that stuck the most in my mind are Look What You've Done, Are You Gonna Be My Girl and Timothy. Timothy is the slowest song on this one, it's quite cool, but if you like this slow ballads, Look What You've Done is even better and it's also my second favourite. And my no. 1 song on this album is definitely Are You Gonna Be My Girl. You may remember this song from the commercial for Vodafone. It's full of energy and it's simply a great song for a party.<br /><br />So if you're looking for some real rock, just get Jet.
B000089CJI|5.0|This is a great collaboration album, driving Ben Gibbard into a more techno-pop electronic sound.  Adding to the charm of this album is his erronious reference to sports in Nothing Better, discussing the goalie tending the net in the fourth quarter. In what sport is there a goalie and a fourth quarter? A must buy for Death Cab fans, and then go get the Iron and Wine cover of Such Great Heights.
B000092T6M|3.0|The 3 stars is for the extended version only.  The original version has been one of my favorite movies ever since it was released in theaters, and I would give it 5 stars.  I was intrigued by the thought of 12 minutes of extra footage, and I was also looking forward to seeing the film with the clarity of DVD for the first time since my VHS recorded from TV version has degraded to the point of being unwatchable. However, I was disappointed with both.  While the added scenes do give some interesting background to the sheriff, they seem forced and in my opinion take away from the main focus of the movie and don't seem necessary.  Also, the sheriff has his scribe's tongue cut out in one of the added scenes, but a scene near the end, which was in the original version, has the same scribe speaking clearly.  I was also extremely disappointed with the picture quality.  It appeared grainy and often had theater pops and crackles. It definitely did not seem like the \\"all-new digital transfer\\" mentioned on the packaging.  Having not seen the original DVD version, I don't know if its picture quality is any better, but either way I think they could have cleaned this up a little better.  It was still enjoyable to watch, but it definitely didn't live up to my expectations.
B000294SFW|5.0|First Motorhead I ever bought was No sleep til hammersmith in 1980. I was blown away by that album. Cotinued with Iron Fist, Another Perfect Day, Orgasmatron (thought that one was their best, til now). Then they started to lose me with that awful Rock n' Roll album. Up to that point, I pretty much treated Motorhead as a band on the decline. Yet still pumping out pretty strong albums. Hearing about this Inferno album the other day..thought wtf, why not...bought it...I don't know what got into this band, I think it's pretty much hearing all the bad music that's come out in the past few years that sparked Motorhead..wanting to teach the kids how to play ballsy, heavy, fast, blues inspired meaty metal, and succeeding gloriously. Lemmy is THE rock n roll god. Doing it his way. Fantastic, well structered songs with a bite of a great white shark. And the acoustic Whorehouse Blues. Only Motorhead can get away with this song at the end of such a blistering album..(that's one of the perks of being Lemmy) It sounds weird, but hearing this album made my evil lil heart jump a beat. Made me proud to be a metalhead again. 2004 Metal Album of the year..bar none.
B000003AEB|5.0|Great cd.Classic just like all eyez on me, raising hell and the chronic.The greatest breaktrough in rap history.Snoop is a legend <br />RIP all the dead rappers
B000089RVX|5.0|This world is so full.. for lack of a better word.. junk. Evanescence is about what alot of teenagers go through at one point or another, about love gone wrong, about life gone wrong, about trying to fit in, about wanting to start over.. <br />But of course, because the lyrics aren't put in lamens terms no one wants to deal with THINKING. Hmm because this song doesn't say <br />yo yo my girl left me <br />now im helpless <br />all i gots my 20 thou <br />'til my next paycheck <br />what am i gon do? <br />because the lyrics go father, because they go into depth explaining the undeniable reality we all have to face at one time or another, because their not pansy lyrics that go all around the absolute horridness this world has become but hit it all head on then alot of people don't like it. Alot of people don't want to face reality.. and that's whats wrong with this world today. <br />People don't want to own up to if you have sex you have babies, if you shoot someone you might just kill them, if you don't get through highschool cause you're playing around with drugs and alcohol then you might not get a good job. People don't like to deal with the fact that their kids might be depressed and need help, that love goes wrong, that life isn't a story book. <br />These lyrics reflect that.. there is wrong in this world, and it needs to be changed. <br />I'm 15 and i understand that.. <br />Evanescence is an absoultley wonderful cd and an absolutley wonderful band, i definatley recommend this cd.. but i also recommend that you listen to it with an open mind.. <br />and by the way it says bid my blood to run.. meaning i want to really start living..
0805047905|5.0|The story has a simple theme about colors and animals that children can relate to. The sentence structure is the same and repetitve through out the story, so children can easily read along with you. It is a good story to turn into a flannel board or to act out with your children. It was one of my children's favorite books! It also makes a great baby gift.
B000002IP1|5.0|Although Phil Collins may be associated with people older than myself I cant help but appreciate this album and Phil Collins as an artist. Every song on this album is a joy to listen to. My favourite track 'find a way to my heart' starts off with such tension and originality and then moves to the uplifting beat before it fades back to the solo strange guitar sounds of the beginning. I have introduced with album to most of my friends who also cannot help but love it! <br />Ultimate 80's...reminds me of my childhood! Brilliant!
B000056H24|5.0|I have watched George Steven's film numerous times- and will continue to. Considering the subject matter- that shouldn't come as a surprise.    This film flopped on initial release. Some said it was because of the waning interest in the biblical epics. Some claimed it was because of hollywood's finest stars  in momentary parts- that it became too distracting. I personally think it was because it was a quiet film for its time. Stevens' tried to get inside what Christ must have 'felt'. I don't think anyone at the time could or would grasp or understand that approach.    Max Von Sydow is brilliant as Christ. You cannot come away from his initial meeting with John the Baptist (Heston), his dealing with the demon on the mountain ( Donald Plesance), his saving of Mary Magdelaine or his raising of Lazurus, without sensing how a 'Son of God' must have felt amongst the 'barbarians'. He is magnificant in relaying how lonely Christ ultimately must have felt. It's a credit to Sydow's acting, his delivery of the word- and the atmosphere generated by Stevens.    This is a flawed but still an immensley spiritual film. It touches on the life of Christ (based on the Fulton Oursler book), and it paints a poignant portrait primarily of his adult years and his time with the Apostles.    It personally affected me in that it really spoke of how, no matter what was demonstarated, it was never enough. It painted the ultimate example that if we don't cherish what we see, feel, hear and know rings with a real truth, we're doomed to a life of continual doubt and denial.     There are many familiar faces (even for the young that may only barely know them).Heston, Portier, Ferrer, Winters, Savalas, John Wayne as a Roman Soldier- David McCallum as Judas...    This is a feeler. If you watch, you may learn. If you open your eyes... you may sense and hear.    Most of all, you will come away thinking, wondering and feeling something spiritual. And that's always a good basis for personal growth, regardless of religious leanings.
B00000163G|5.0|all evez on me iz a very good cd !!! the song that are on the cd are one of the best song of 2pac !!! so buy it !!! you won't regret it !!!
B0002JJBZE|4.0|This Star Trek:TOS has some good old shows and some interesting information,excepting one incorrect comment on a Red Shirt Easter egg by long time fan BJO Trimble. She wrongly states that Star Trek episodes were cut down to 20 minutes in Australia. BJO is getting old and has a confused memory as what really happened was that she was at an Australian Star Trek convention in the 1970's and an old ST episode run at that convention failed mid through. BJO has mixed this up with the absurd idea that a Australian TV station censored it,which is a bit hard to cut it down from 50 minutes to only 20! So just ignore her confused and innacurate interview and enjoy the rest of the DVD set.
B000069I1C|4.0|This is a great action/comedy.  It's a good rainy day movie.  The action is great, ewhat little of it there is.  But most of it is comedy.  And hilarious comedy at that.  Eddi Murphey and Robert Deniro aregreat together.  Top notch movie. <br /> <br />Plus a cameo by Mad TV'S Alex Borstein at the very beginning!
B000053V7Q|2.0|I saw the movie, then I bought the 8-track, the LP, later the CD and now the DVD just to found that missed 8 of the 12 the sound track songs,I'm very dissapointed
B000002ADT|5.0|For the last few months I have tried to understand why I consider this album to be the greatest one in jazz, or at least in my collection. In pretty much all great jazz albums, we are given a point. The songs within the album each contain a melody and/or reason, and we appreciate the music based on the artist's ability to express and follow this given point in his/her own style. Even in completely free jazz, where a melody might not be apparent, a direct reason still exists. This album is different. In Kind of Blue, the melodies are broken down into the most elementary structures, and as a result the point of the album is not to follow a structure, but rather to present the musicians at their finest. The melody and reason are barely apparent in this album, thus an opinion about each song is not restricted to its structure. In a way, we are being presented jazz as a whole. When I hear Miles, Trane, Adderly or Evans on All Blues, I do not see them trying to adapt to a 4 note melody with a waltz time. Instead I see them playing in a way that when you hear it, you think, \\"yeah, this is just pure Trane\\" or whoever. This album does not make me think about Trane trying to follow the chord structures perfectly, like in Giant Steps. This album lets me think about Trane just for being him. It's quite hard to explain this idea in a short review. However, the fact alone that so much thought can be put into a single album must say something about it (or about me haha). Either way, I encourage you to buy this album, because I have a feeling we will never see anything like this again in jazz.
B000003TA4|1.0|\\"Nevermind\\" is one of the biggest cop-out excuses for an album ever. You'd think that a band with such a slick record could replicate that sound onstage. Or come close to it. But as many of us would-be Nirvana fans found out when we bought \\"Muddy Banks,\\" this band blew live. I'm sorry, but Nirvana never could match the cut-and-paste studio job that Butch Vig did for them. Nirvana's Nevermind is just as overproduced as anything from Janet Jackson, Guns & Roses, and Poison. But at least those three bands used the studio gloss to enhance what talent they already had. Nirvana just used that wall of gloss to hide behind and cover up the fact that they couldn't sing or play their instruments. Go buy a super-glossed album from a band that can play and sing. Might I suggest Boyz II Men's \\"Cooleyhighharmony\\" or Primus' \\"Pork Soda\\"? <br /> <br />Hells yes. <br /> <br />
B0000E6I1J|4.0|I REALLY DONT THINK ANOTHER REVIEW IS NECCESARY.i just wanted to say why ringo played the songs he played is probably because he co-wrote \\"photograph\\" with george and of course george plays guitar on \\"honey don't\\" with ringo singing on the beatles '65 album.most of you probably know this but some people in their reviews were wondering why ringo chose these two songs to play on the album.george also played \\"honey don't\\" with carl perkins on carl's concert tribute album.
B0001NBMBC|1.0|What a heap of crap. ANyone who likes this can go and put their head down the toilet, because I'd rather do that than buy or listen to this crap ever again. <br /> <br />FAKE BORING NOISY CRAPPY MUSIC. <br />They said this would be their last album and for good reason, you can't make more than three albums of screaming and shouting and expect stupid fools to keep buying it - then again it still would'nt surprise me.
B0000024V2|5.0|This album will kick your a$$. Turn it up loud. It kills.
B00005JMJG|5.0|My girlfiend and I had broken up. After watching this movie she called me and we're now back together. I had never seen the movie too. So we decided to watch it the other day and I just loved it man. This is a really good movie that makes you think. The acting is real good too. Jim Carrey is damn good in this movie.
185984054X|3.0|Somebody had to say it -- Mother Teresa was an egotist of limited intelligence who cared little for the material welfare of her charges and sucked up to the rich and powerful. The problem is that Hitchens does not say it particularly simply or well.<br /><br />This is curious, since he wrote another book, [[ASIN:0465030505 Why Orwell Matters]] which is a paean to that writer's spare writing style. Unfortunately, Mr. Hitchens seems unable to follow Orwell's example.
B00005A46T|1.0|Oh my gosh.........this must be a joke.  Have any of you stupid people who listen to this music actually read reviews of other people who can purley and plainly see that this is not music.its just a really big f*cken noise!    For crying out loud, the think they're are all evil and scary but really they have no idea of making real music. I wonder if these [...] nerds have even sat down properly and listened to their records....and gone - actually this sounds like absolute sh*t. But we got rich of it - well who cares, ugh it just makes you sick!
B00005B4GU|5.0|Although I don't own PABLO HONEY, I'm certain that I'm probably not missing anything essential.  Else wise, I've heard and purchased every Radiohead album--in order of their release (except for AMNESIAC which I bought last). <br /> <br />I suppose I was just put off by the negative reviews that this album received.  I don't know...maybe it's me, but this album is much better than KID A, which I found to be a difficult listen.  Now, as I said, I'm a fan of Radiohead and I love the fact that they completely shift \\"artistic priority\\" from album-to-album.  Such a shift is indicative of a truly great artist/band.  Two names that come to mind are Miles Davis and Brian Wilson. <br /> <br />With that said, AMNESIAC is significantly more accessible than KID A.  I compare it in sound to HAIL TO THE THIEF because it's more a mixture of styles (in that it seems to blend the melodies of OK COMPUTER and the sonic experimentation of KID A).  It's not Radiohead's opus (that honor still belongs to OK COMPUTER, with THE BENDS clocking in at a close second), but it deserves a place in the canon...certainly one higher than people give it.
B0002Y4TZG|5.0|If I could take just one piece of music with me onto a desert island, it would be The Clash's masterpiece, London Calling.  It is generally hailed by critics as one of the top releases in the rock era.  Originally released in 1979, it was named Rolling Stone Album of the Year, 1980.  This is the album's 25 anniversary issue and is the second time it has been re-released.  The album works on many different musical levels; sometimes hard rocking, other times swinging, but always sounding innovative and fresh.  The bonus CD, The Vanilla Tapes, were reportedly discovered in co-founder Mick Jones' garage (rather appropriate, since The Clash fancied themselves as a garage band) and have now seen the light of day.  The material on this disc is what one would expect, nothing revolutionary, but nice sketches of the songs that would eventually make up the album.  Finally, the DVD produced by long-time Clash associate, Don Letts, is a well-done feature on the band.  London Calling is highly recommended.
B0002XDODU|1.0|I honestly don't know whats so appealing about a bunch of people in a German band (yelling German) leaping about on the moon chanting  <br />\\"We are all living in a america\\". When that is of course total lie anyway. Is'nt it ovious,  <br />\\"r u nat tolkin in germain!!!??\\" <br /> <br />As for the music, well is it music, just stupid boring guitar riffs played over and over with ridiculous noises. <br />Whats the $#%#% point of people who are'nt german listening to this anyway, you can't understand them singing, which is one of the whole points of music!!!!!! <br /> <br />^%$^$%% rabbich!!!!!!!
B00000JHAU|5.0|although belle and sebastian have done other good albums as well, this is the band at its peak. this is where they find the balance between the moodiness of \\"fold your hands...\\" and the playfulness of \\"boy with the arab strap\\". Sombre songs like the excellent \\"Fox in the snow\\" along with more upbeat tracks like \\"stars of track and field\\", \\"like dylan in the movies\\" and \\"if you're feeling sinister\\" make this a must-have. Simple, playful melodies and lyrics, sometimes verging on the absurd, that are firmly rooted in real human life, uncensored and omitting the cliches. Today, this is a great album. In say twenty years, it will be considered a classic.
B00003CXCT|4.0|i won't say anything for the changes since i only watched the episode 4 of the set by now (i received it yesterday). the story is the same too, not anything to complaint. the video quality is superb. the film doesn't show its age. i can say that the picture quality is sharper than the sequel dvd's. but there are some flaws in the picture. during the opening sequence there are reddish flashes which can be handled better. another one, which is very disturbing, is occurs during the vader vs kenobi duel. as the sabers clashes a yellowish green halo (sabers are blue and red) and it doesn't look like an effect resulting due to saber clashes. since lots of time has passed since i've watched episode 4, i can't remember if those were present in the original movie though. and the last, but not the least, some shots of tie fighters haven't get cleaned of the boxes around them. the sound? perfect.
B000056N8X|5.0|ATTENTION,SPOILER INCLUDED:  One of my favourite movies,no doubt.A well-skilled director(although some scenes are quite clumpsy directed),Christopher Lambert at his best,and an epic but also cool plot.The martial arts are great too,and so is the music.  Unfortuently,the movie lacks in the acting part-the main good guys are great,but I found the bad guy and the Wactcher too ''angry''.But who knows,maybe it's the director's fault,maybe he told them to act that way.  I would also like to correct a wrong essay about this film,which I believe it must be corrected if you want to make the right desicion to buy this film or not.  THIS IS THE SPOILING PART.  What is said by many about this movie is that the Game ends,leaving the character of Adrian Paul(don't remeber his name right now!) as the last Immortal.That is completely wrong.The movie gives you no such information.Adrian Paul's character's 6000 and more year old friend is still alive(or at least we don't learn anything about him dying).And aucorse,there is that new scene in the end,where we learn that Faith is still alive.  To my opinion,this part is called ''Endgame'' because the Game ends for the original Highlander(played by Christopher Lambert-the main character of the movies)when he dies.  Anyway,if you like epic,cool,and aucorse martial arts,buy this movie.NOW!!!!!
B00005JMXX|4.0|The Day After Tommorrow was a very funny and amusing movie. I especially liked the part about the wolves on the ship. I could not stop laughing! I also enjoyed the part where U.S. citizens were \\"illegally\\" swimming across the Rio Grande into Mexico. The best part though was the couple trying to get it on in a scene and then getting annihilated by a tornado that hit Los Angeles. Overall, the movie was fun to watch. It's one of those films where you just have to be ready to laugh. Please don't attend a funeral and then watch this movie.
B00004XONN|3.0|So this is supposed to be Radiohead's second best effort, next to Ok Computer? I'm not impressed. Thom Yorke takes the experimental high road, but instead of sounding profound, he comes off as pretentious and incomprehensible. Most of the tracks here are repetitive and seem unlistenable. This is most true for the highly touted \\"National Anthem.\\" The title alone sounded interesting to me, but after attempting a listen, I couldn't stand it.  <br />This album does have a few highlights. Idioteque and Motion Picture Soundtrack take odd approaches and are intriguing. How to disappear completely, Optimistic, In Limbo, and Morning Bell are decent, but seem boring after some time.  <br />It seems like drugs are the only way to make listening to this an enjoyable experience, that's what the uber-cool late night coffee shop kids are probably hinting at. This CD gets way too much credit than it actually deserves however.
B00000JMOF|5.0|James Whale's masterpiece FRANKENSTEIN is one of the most amazing films ever made. What more can be said? It is a poignant portrait of humanity, a deep, knowing story written from a literary genius and is commonly regarded as the best monster movie ever. Letting emotions tell the creature's pitiable tale, and not falling subject to Hollywood clich&eacute;s, this is film-making at it's finest. Boris Karloff infuses his finest role with both wonder and anguish. However it is strange for a film of the genre to features a monster who is deeply human.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Arguably Radiohead's finest effort, this album has something for everyone. The intense solos, a lot of experimenting, and even some slow beautiful tunes like Karma Police and The Tourist. Even though I'm not the biggest fan of Thom Yorke's voice, it doesn't make much of a difference, because the music speaks for itself, especially on Paranoid Android and Climbing up the walls, my two favorite songs. The tracks here are adventurous and thought-provoking, sure to keep you listening for awhile. <br />While I'm not about to call this the best album of the 90's, it's very close, and deserves the recognition that it gets.
B0001ADAVK|2.0|Julia Roberts plays Katherine Watson, an art teacher who thinks she's lucked out when offered a job at a prestigious school for young women in the 1950's.  From the first reel, everything about the flick screams \\"Dead Poets\\" with women instead of laughs, and nothing ever changes your mind - except for making you re-think the fun you might have had watching \\"Dead Poets\\".  In short \\"Smiling\\" is a movie that praises characters that leap past the trite expectations of their peers, yet boasts a script that fulfills every trite Hollywood clich.  Watson is horrified to learn that young women of the 1950's are being groomed for a life of craven servility and grim conformity (forgetting for a moment that the same was roughly true for about everybody in those days).  Watson's young charges are intelligent, but also resigned to a life in the shadows of likely caddish husbands chosen by their weak-willed parents.  By the end of the movie, Watson's students learn to break the bonds that condemned their parents to loveless and unfulfilled lives (except for one student who does choose to forego the promising future as a lawyer for one as a housewife - but does have to convince Watson of the rightness of her decision).  Being an accomplished woman means traveling abroad (rather than saying you did), getting an apartment in Greenwich Village, and foregoing marriage unless you're utterly more determined by an order of magnitude to opt for either of the above.  We also learn that parents are utterly worthless - grooming their daughters for a dim future, if only to be spared the horror of having to explain why they fell for the same trap.  None of the villains - upper society women for the most part - are elevated from the anonymous and unforgiving roles the script sticks them with (in mirroring their evil, the script treats them as we're supposed to believe they treat their daughters), and we're supposed to cheer when their daughters zing them into defeated muteness.  \\"Mona Lisa\\" isthat rare chick flick that's actually more insulting to women in general than the men on the screen.
B000002NJS|5.0|Nearly flawless (\\"little star\\" would have shined as a B-side, but mars the flow of this otherwise exquisite masterpiece)  statement of maturity, humility and little-known musicality from agit-popstress turned diva.  Noteworthy is William Orbit's visionary use of pysychedelic guitar technique, which adds counterpoint to the techno and production-driven ambience.  Orbit's guitars are \\"traveling\\" through the mix as if the \\"spirit guide\\" to Madonna's vocal on her journey of awareness. I quickly found that any three songs in a row here constitute a seamless \\"suite\\" that works musically as well as lyrically without force. <br /> <br /> This album is one of two utterly enexpected and exquisite examples of 80*s females offering doubtless proof of worth in the 90*s; the other being Sade's sublime 1992 'Love Deluxe\\".  In both cases, the artist successfully adapted her persona to an unexpected and well-delivered soundscape.  <br /> <br /> \\"Frozen\\" was reportedly chosen by M's rabbi to spearhead the album's single releases.  I wish i had that Rabbi to pick my lotto numbers!  I honestly think this one would have flopped without that not-so-enigmatic statement to disarm her audience and critics.  \\"Frozen\\", like many Madonna singles, posseses a singular and evocative introduction (think \\"Vogue\\") which transports the listener into M's \\"parlour\\" before she sings a single note.  Upon repeated listenings, the \\"intro\\" makes one salivate in anticipation. Ever savvy (and coy...),  M knows this is the stuff classic singles are made of. \\"The Power of Goodbye\\" is my all-time fave, and the only time M's voice has ever given me chills!  \\"To Have and Not to Hold\\" is utterly sublime, evoking Spanish as well as \\"ambient\\" music , while seeing M deliver a world-class understatement (and I mean \\"deliberate\\" on that) in her vocal. \\"Swim\\" is ambrosia for audiophiles, and sounds amazing on all systems! <br /> <br />  I'm a strong proponent for 5.1 mixes on classic releases, hopefully Mr. Orbit will oblige on this release, which is surely deserving of the treatment.  Please ignore all references made to Orbit's \\"blips and beeps\\" in other reviews of this project (there are some trademark Orbit atmospherics, incidental in nature).  Such narrow minded focus is unbelievable in the face of his skilled guitarmanship and visionary arranging.  <br /> <br />When I first heard \\"Frozen\\" in '97, I said \\"Yes! Finally!\\". There's a reason Madonna got Grammy nods in spite of much sentiment against her persona.  Truly breathtaking and possesing great artistic merit, this one deserves to be heard!
6305127646|4.0|Not a classic but well worth watching over again. <br />I had forgotten the whole jist of the story. <br />Thoroughly amused by all of the disguises <br />Elizabeth Shue was most excellent - <br />Val kept you guessing [not like the JACKEL, with Bruce Willis but still good] <br />Great addition to the collection of memorable characters. <br />
B000006TRV|4.0|I have to be completely honest. I am only 14, and am a rabid fan of Supertramp.  Many people referred me to Pink Floyd, and have since become completely obsessed.  Fairly typical for all Floyd 'newbies,' I instantly became lost in my first album, 'The Wall.' I couldn't help staring at the stark surrealism of the booklet and listening to the album.  Later, I purchased DSOTM, Animals, Final Cut, Piper at the Gates of Dawn, Wish You Were Here, and took a leap of faith with Ummagumma, which I am rather fond of.  Upon listening to these other albums (save the 'Final Cut), I realized something was drasticlally missing from 'The Wall.'  I couldn't put a finger on it until I found out that Rick Wright, Pink Floyd's senior keyboardist, was ejected early in the recording sessions!  What was left in 'The Wall' were underdeveloped songs lacking much (if not any) keyboards what so ever!  <br /> To me, it seems each album has a certain instrument it excels with. The Wall only really excells with the drums, perfect orchestration, epsecially notable in 'Waiting for the Worms.'  There is only one really stand out guitar solo, that of 'Comfortably Numb,' which really isn't Gilmour's greatest (if you're looking for his best guitar work, go buy 'Animals').   <br />If you skip over all the pointless little minute long songs, you are left with a more genius work, which all seem to be held together by a single riff, that of which you will find in 'Hey You,' 'Waiting For The Worms,' 'Another Brick In the Wall (1-3)', and the Trial.  The Trial being the only truely brilliant songs on the track, including a menacing orchestra and voice warping effects.   <br />I would conclude that if you are new to Floydian thought, this is probably good for a firm grasp of their stuff. Then get 'Final Cut' and work backwards, ignoring all of the post Waters stuff.
B0000062FL|5.0|Abraxas is Santana's second album and made them international superstars. While their appearance at Woodstock in 1969 and their debut album which spawned the huge hit \\"Evil Ways\\" showed a strong up and coming band, Abraxas became their commercial masterpiece. This is also the second album of their classic  Woodstock lineup which today is still recognized as the definitive Santana band and created the majority of their best material.<br /><br />Every track here is stellar. The opening instrumental \\"Singing Winds, Crying Beasts\\" is a very soothing track carried by a jungle beat and some quiet piano lines with occassional fiery guitar work from Carlos Santana added more for color. This leads to \\"Black Magic Woman/Gypsy Queen\\" which is the band's most famous song despite their pop songs \\"Smooth\\" and \\"Maria Maria\\" becoming #1 hits in 1999-2000. \\"Black Magic Woman\\" with its soulful vocal from Gregg Rolie would go to #4 and was a perfect 3-minute radio hit at the time. But the track isn't truly complete until it enters into the fiery jam \\"Gypsy Queen\\" which features some intense percussion and an excellent melodic solo from Santana. This leads right into their other huge hit here, \\"Oye Como Va\\", which would become one of the highest charting Spanish singles in U.S. history. The laid back \\"Samba Pa Ti\\" is one of their best instrumentals and is a showcase for Santana's emotional guitar work. \\"Incident At Neshabur\\" is also a great instrumental which is first based on a killer riff before becoming a more mellow jazz track. The intense \\"Se A Cabo\\" is an excellent track which is carried by Rolie's frantic organ work and its relentless percussion. \\"Hope You're Feeling Better\\" is a strong track  which features a fiery solo from Santana that still gets occassional airplay on AOR radio. The remaining tracks \\"Mother's Daughter\\" and the short \\"El Nicoya\\" are strong as well. The remastered version includes bonus live versions of \\"Se A Cabo\\", \\"Black Magic Woman/Gypsy Queen\\", and \\"Toussaint L' Overture\\" from Santana 3. Newcomers should start here before exploring less commercial but just as satistfying albums Santana I, Santana III, and Caravanserai. Highly recommended.ssaint L' Overture\\" from Santana 3.

B00005JNJ7|5.0|[...]<br /><br />After I had dried my eyes from the tears of laughter; after the 'theme song' with its catchy headline (\\"America, f... yeah, got to save the m.....f...... world\\") had finally stopped bouncing around in my head; after I managed to stop chuckling quietly, or not-so-quietly, occasioning my wife and daughters to look at me oddly and shaking their heads; after sleeping over it for a night...I finally asked myself whether it was really necessary to be quite as vulgar to get a point across: whatever that point may have been.<br /><br />The answer, I decided, was 'yes', for, in its contrast with the piss-takes on the universe of Hollyweird movies and the merciless and welcome satire on the theme of actors-and-other-insignificants-turned activists, it makes a serious statement, more profound than any learned discussion is ever likely to produce (or me, writing this!). Tray Parker made it explicit it in an interview with 60 Minutes: \\"Society is our only hope\\".<br /><br />Indeed. And society consists of human beings, most of whom have a definite element of vulgarity. I wonder if it isn't true to say that _everybody_ has a core of vulgarity, even if it's covered up by the layers upon layers of thin and fragile veneer. American society evidences this vulgarity more openly than many others, though that isn't an indication that it actually _is_ more vulgar than, say, some of those European nations, who consider themselves more 'refined' and 'cultured'.<br /><br />The final speech by the actor 'Gary', in front of an assembly of 'world leaders' captivated by the vapid utterances and platitudes of 'Alec Baldwin' (Parker-and-Stone's satire is without mercy or fear) is a vulgar, graphic and utterly to-the-point summary of the essence of Amercian society, what it stands for and against; on those who stand against it; and on the fundamental substance of the 'War on Terror'.<br /><br />TA:WP not a movie for the faint-hearted, and it has a truly disturbing sequence (and I don't mean the one with the puppets having sex, and at some length) that had the audience dead-silent.

B00068IOWC|5.0|First, I have to say that anyone who posted a luke-warm review of 3 stars or less on amazon.com within a day - if not hours - of this album's release... well, you've got to be eating crow right about now. That is, unless you're incapable of admitting you were wrong. <br /> <br />\\"How To Dismantle...\\" is a gorgeous album. It contains all the elements that have made me a U2 fan since I heard \\"New Year's Day\\" for the first time back in '84. I can hear echoes of \\"War\\", \\"Unforegttable Fire\\", and \\"Achtung, Baby\\", primarily, in this record. Bono's voice sounds strong, The Egde's signature guitar sound is as innovative as it ever has been, and Adam and Larry are still holding it all together as well as - if not better than - ever. U2 never relied upon technical prowess. Their strength has always been in their soulfuness and their strong songwriting.... and \\"How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb\\" is brimming with both. <br /> <br />\\"Vertigo\\" is, of course the hook-laden single that got us all excited about the new U2 album, and the reason I bought it...  but, after a few weeks and several listens to the album, all the \\"better\\" songs have come to the forefront. <br /> <br />\\"Miracle Drug\\" and \\"Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own\\" are two beautiful songs a-la \\"One\\"...... \\"Love And Peace Or Else\\" is classic U2 with strange sounds and a dark bass/guitar riff running throughout.... \\"All Because Of You\\" is reminiscent of the  \\"Joshua Tree\\" era, and \\"Crumbs From Your Table\\"  has an interesting Phil Spector quality to it (due to the use of a xylophone, I think), and begins with an \\"Unforgettable Fire\\"-ish guitar intro. \\"Original Of The Species\\" is a Beatle-esque track with \\"I Am The Walrus\\"-like strings..... \\"Yahweh\\" is a powerful song where Bono shows he can still belt them out...... but, I think my fave on the entire album is \\"A Man And A Woman\\". It harkens back to the \\"War\\" era for me. I love when U2 uses acoustic guitars along with The Edge's delay pedal-laden effected electric guitar. Bono sings, \\"I never could take the chance, of losing love to find romance...\\". Man, what a great line. Something we've all pondered at one time or another. <br /> <br />I bought the special edition, so I get the bonus track \\"Fast Cars\\". An interesting Spanish-flavored flamenco tune... I could've seen it coming out as a B-side during the \\"Joshua tree\\" era. And, peaking of the bonus edition, the DVD is very cool. It's always great to be given a glimpse into such a prolific band's creative process. <br /> <br />Is \\"How To\\" as good as \\"Achtung\\", or \\"Joshua Tree\\"? Well, that is all subjective. U2 were in their prime during the recording of those two records, and band can't sustain that kind of edge forever. But, having said that, I bet if \\"How To\\" came out in 1992, we'd be hailing it as \\"U2's best album ever\\" on amazon.com today(!). It's all about the arc of a band's career. The music is as good as ever. But, after over ten years, it's just not possible to be as relevent in the music industry as it once was.
B00005JMJG|5.0|AMAZING  I LOVE THIS MOVIE WITH ALL MY HEART <br />When I really like a book/movie (if you've noticed) I don't say much...you will find out for yourself ;] <br />*one of those movies you may need to/get more out of if you watch a second...or more time*
6305949980|5.0|I am not a big Tim Burton fan, but this movie is in my top 3 of all<br /><br />time. Perhaps the fact that Halloween is my favorite holiday influenced<br /><br />my opinion, but I doubt it. The more I hear and read about this movie,<br /><br />the more I love it.<br /><br />Based on a parody of the famous \\"Night before Christmas\\" poem by Moore<br /><br />that Burton wrote and illustrated while employed at Disney, this idea<br /><br />was stagnant for many years prior to filming. In many ways this was a<br /><br />good thing, technology was able to catch up to Burton's ideas.<br /><br />In NBC, we see our hero Jack Skellington, aka The Pumpkin King,<br /><br />depressed as another Halloween passes. In the background we hear the<br /><br />residents of Halloween Town celebrate another wonderful holiday. But<br /><br />Jack is sad. The only one who notices is the Rag Doll-style woman<br /><br />Sally.<br /><br />Other characters, including many town-monsters, are introduced. We meet<br /><br />the wonderful mayor with two faces, the evil scientist and his<br /><br />assistant, three local children and our evil boogie-man.<br /><br />After an accident, Jack develops a plan to kidnap \\"Sandy Claws\\" and<br /><br />give presents out for Christmas in place of Christmas Town. You will<br /><br />have to view this movie to discover the rest.<br /><br />The claymation is not what I expected, it was of a high quality and the<br /><br />movements are not jerky like the old Christmas Specials. Danny Elfman's<br /><br />music has little resemblance to his work with Ongo Bongo and \\"What's<br /><br />this?\\" (which Jack sings when he discovers the colorful world of<br /><br />Christmas Town) is closer to a tune mixed from Cabaret and The Music<br /><br />Man. The voices match the mouth movements nearly perfectly. This was a<br /><br />project from the heart and all the little touches to make it 'just'<br /><br />right show this fact.
B0002ZDVEU|4.0|Just sat through this last night, and was completely blown away. I'd read the first Bourne book ages and ages ago, but it didn't really matter to me that the films have no connection to the novels. We could say the same of all the Bond films....<br /><br />As for the action sequneces: I'm usually a fan of the \\"staged\\" fight sequences you see in most action movies, but Supremacy has staccato-like bursts of adrenalin that really impressed the hell out of me. As directed and shot, they evoke fewer expressions of \\"Wow, cool\\" and instead make the audience feel that they're in the middle of a real fight to the death, a real car chase scene. The one extended fight scene is fast and ugly, but it feels grounded in reality--This is the way spies would kill each other. Both the chase on foot in Berlin, and then the car chase in Moscow really kept me on the edge.<br /><br />There's been lots of complaints about the shaky camera style, which I'd normally hate. But it works well here, really imbuing the film with a gritty up-close realism that most action films can't touch. Because of a plot twist that happens in the first twenty minutes, I was prepared to hate the rest of the movie. The fact that I didn't--and wound up liking it enough to post a review--means this movie is worth the time. I'm looking forward to a possible Bourne Ultimatum.
B000021YQV|5.0|Before I actually bought this CD, I heard Chop Suei on the radio a few times.  Thought it was purely crazy.  Yet, I was drawn to it.  The same for the whole CD:  I at first thought it was purely insane and almost hard to listen to.  But as soon as I gave each song a second blow, I realized how amazing these songs were and how much thought had to go into making this Album.  Now time has passed and SOAD has become my favorite band out there.  Buy it!  It's a masterpiece.  But just a warning: Take a look at the sound of the whole CD before buying.  It has a sound that may take a little time to get used to. <br /> <br />Half of the fun about the CD is finding the meaning behind the song.  As the group has said, they don't even know the whole meaning sometimes.  Their movements back and forth from war and peace are pretty entertaining.  Just a different spin on speaking out against such hard subjects.   <br /> <br />BTW, can't wait for Mesmerize to come out spring 2005 and Hypnotize at the end of next year!
B00005JKED|5.0|Even two years after purchasing this DVD, I play it to test recently released video equipment.  And \\"it's a trip\\" to revisit the dark side of the City of Angels as is captured here.    The care that Director Antoine Fuqua took in selecting the Los Angeles backdrops to his film \\"Training Day\\" is obvious from the success of the film.  He's created a color saturated portrait of Los Angeles and it's narcotics underworld.  And his film is perfectly shot.    If you want to show off your big screen, this outstanding video transfer to DVD ranks five stars (*****). Our friends tell us it's actually better than going to the movies.       Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke are perfect as Narc Training Officer and rookie.  Washington's character takes control from the very first moments of the film. There's even a bit of Eve Mendes' beauty which somehow shines through an otherwise bleak existence and marginal relationship with Washington's character.      Visually a five star film; and except for an oddly fitting finish, a piercingly convincing look into the narcotics underworld of Los Angeles.  This film ought to be on the top ten list for testing the quality of your DVD player and your Big Screen.
B00005JMAH|3.0|As a big Harry Potter fan, I was truly looking forward to this movie. Probably one of the best books to date in the Harry Potter series, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, this is a story that will set up so much and start to shape the series into the path it will take.<br /><br />This movie has gotten the most mixed feelings of any of the Harry Potter movies. Perhaps it was high expectations from the fans, or the many changes that people weren't used to.. but something definitely was lacking from this to lead to the difference of opinions. I do recommend this movie but also have to admit that there were some problems with it and it was far from a perfect telling of the brillient book and story that the fans have come to love.<br /><br />Chris Columbus did a wonderful job with the first two movies, capturing the flavor and story almost too well. Alfonso Cuaron had big shoes to fill and maybe an almost impossible challenge as Columbus set the stakes so high. Overall though he did a good job. But it was far from great and can see where a lot of the fans can think of what could have been rather then what was.<br /><br />Harry Potter starts off his third year as usual. His aunt and uncle making life miserable and his Uncle's sister coming over for a visit makes things even harder. Harry winds up running away from home only to be picked up by a mysterious bus that only wizards can see. He soon finds out that a killer has escaped from the Prison of Azkaban and he is coming for Harry. If that wasn't bad enough the dark dementors from the prison are also searching for the criminal, Sirus Black and they will suck the soul right out of you leaving nothing but a shell of what you once were. Unlucky for Harry they don't hesitate to feed off of Harry at any chance they get. Once back at school Harry has the usual problems. Classes are as hard as ever. Especialy with the new divination class. Hagrid has become the new Care for creatures teacher where Harry meets Buckbeak, a hippogryph that takes an instant liking to Harry. And the new Defense against the dark arts class may be more then he appears. Overall its business as usual for Mr. Potter and it's a fun story that most will enjoy.<br /><br />I am very mixed over all on this movie. I agree with those who loved it and I agree with those who have fault with it. They did a lot right but also missed the boat on a lot of moments too. Cramming a book of that size into a little over 2 hours was probably a mistake. If this movie was 3 hours or even another 40 minutes longer, it would have made up for a lot of parts that were missing or cut due to time. Even without reading the book, the movie does seem choppy. Moments are quickly moved through and important details not even told of. Many things were just awkward and strained and I'm not sure if that was the directors fault or the fact they wanted to make this a 2 hour movie but this should have been the best of the three movies by far , as the book most definitely was but as it stands the movie is good but the first two are supurb. I won't go into everything the movie was missing or the many changes that were made as it is what it is. But the movie wasn't bad either. It had great moments and acting and does cover the main parts of the story even if they are altered and rushed. The movie starts out a bit slow but the ending more then makes up for this.<br /><br />I truly hope that the Goblet of fire will pick up where the first two movies started quality and fullness wise and not worry about cramming as much as they can into 2 hours but letting the story tell it self and give the fans what they have come to expect with the series which is top quality and true to teh story that a lot cherrish and adore. It may be unfair to blame the director for what happend but there is no denying that something went wrong with this movie that should have been a slam dunk easily. The fact that so many are mixed on this means it is far from the case and I do hope that the message is recieved loud and clear for the next movie.<br /><br />If you are fan it is ok to be disapointed as much as it is to love it as one of the best. But however you feel, please do buy this movie and enjoy it. While it may not be perfect as far as the book goes, it still is a lot of fun and has great extras and moments that you won't want to miss. Lets hope the next movie is one that all fans can agree on as Harry Potter is a great series that I hope doesn't go away any time soon. It may have been a step down from what most have come to expect, but it's still one that I will watch often and look for bigger and better things to come.se and I do hope that the message is recieved loud and clear for the next movie. <br /> <br />If you are fan it is ok to be disapointed as much as it is to love it as one of the best.

B000063UR2|5.0|This 1985 fantasy/fairy-tale drama was produced by famed director Ridley Scott.  The movie is about the classic war between good and evil, focusing on two Unicorns as the good, and Lord Darkness (played by Tim Curry) as the evil.  This movie is really a guilty pleasure for most fans, as it is filled with endless fantasy jargon about goblins and unicorns and the ultimate darkness.  Although it would seem as if such a repetitive and over used plot would be boring and dull, Scott's \\"sharp and atmospheric\\" look of the film saves it from being anything of a mess.  Although it is not at the same level of some of Scott's other films, such as Alien and Gladiator, he manages to create a truly beautiful movie.
B00005JMFQ|1.0|This film insulted my intelligence. 1) The opening lines about Sept. 11th are tasteless. Why use people who were innocently murdered to make a point in a movie's screenplay? 2) At least two of the relationships in the film consist of men in positions of authority over the women and should make any thinking person rather uncomfortable; 3) The president of the United States is portrayed pretty much as a serial rapist, not only unbelievable but extremely insulting to any thinking person; 4) The storyline about the friend with the crush on his best friend's wife who then stalks her, once again, should make any thinking person extremely uncomfortable; 5) The scene in which the coworker walks out on Laura Linney's character just because she receives a phone call from her brother is just not believable and once again quite insulting to any thinking person and 6) a child would not be able to run through an airport without being either physically stopped, or, unfortunately, maybe even worse!

B00005JKC3|5.0|I liked this movie.  I wasn't expecting too, to be honest; it had so much negative criticism that when I watched it on SKY last night I was not expecting anything but a pile of pants.<br /><br />It actually turned out to be quite good, very intelligent for a \\"super hero\\" movie and very well acted by all concerned.<br /><br />Okay so it didn't follow the Hulk comic book we all know and love but who cares?  It was a GOOD movie, fun, moving, humorous with spectacular special effects.  I even liked the way Ang Lee sectioned the screens off into blocks so that we could see several perspectives, I thought that was neat and quite clever.<br /><br />The plot was marginally more complex than most but then THIS is an Ang Lee film so with action you get intelligence which is a rare commodity these days and should be savoured like a good quality port if you get my drift?<br /><br />Eric Bana as the scientist Bruce Banner was a good choice of actor, and Nick Nolte was brilliant as the deranged scientist whose mutated genes he passed on to his unsuspecting son during conception.<br /><br />We have the delectable Sam Elliot (even with grey hair!) as the ruthless military man Ross trying to kill the Hulk, his estranged daughter Betty, played by the versatile actress Jennifer Connolly (who is in love with the Hulk's human persona, Eric and of course a baddie in the form of Talbot played by the unknown actor Josh Lucas a somewhat supercilious but ambitious young man who gets bounced around like a rubber ball by a very, very cross Hulk and meats a sticky end in the best comic book tradition.<br /><br />This is a fairly action packed film, with lots of great and fun special effects, the mutated dog fight with the Hulk is great, and a frothing mouthed enraged poodle trying to get at Betty in her car is totally tongue in cheek but very well done.  I also liked the San Francisco scene with the Hulk ripping up the road as he runs UNDER it and the domino effect of the cars he sends hurtling down San Francisco's steep streets, a sweet moment in the film I have to say!<br /><br />And as for all those critics who have complained about how unrealistic this film is, erm, excuse me, this is just a fantasy film and when you are making fantasy come to life on celluloid you can over step the boundaries of physics, just simply because you can!<br /><br />We also get a cameo by the original Hulk Lou Ferrigno who has a walk on part as a security guard; I like the fact that Ang Lee acknowledged the past as well as the future because I remember and still love the original Hulk series, as cheesy and as dated as it is now!<br /><br />All in all Ang Lee did a great job with this film and I don't care what anyone else says, it's worth watching and its worth getting on DVD because the first time around you don't get to see every little gem he has put into this movie.<br /><br />Some movies you have to think about when you watch them others you can watch and forget, with this version of The Hulk you have to think so using your brain cells is a must which I know is REALLY hard for some members of the moving going general public, must be all the \\"E's\\" in the butter popcorn they are eating is all I can say.rs he sends hurtling down San Francisco's steep streets, a sweet moment in the film I have to say!  <br /> <br />And as for all those critics who have complained about how unrealistic this film is, erm, excuse me, this is just a fantasy film and when you are making fantasy come to life on celluloid you can over step the boundaries of physics, just simply because you can! <br /> <br />We also get a cameo by the original Hulk Lou Ferrigno who has a walk on part as a security guard; I like the fact that Ang Lee acknowledged the past as well as the future because I remember and still love the original Hulk series, as cheesy and as dated as it is now! <br /> <br />All in all Ang Lee did a great job with this film and I don't care what anyone else says, it's worth watching and its worth getting on DVD because the first time around you don't get to see every little gem he has put into this movie. <br /> <br />Some movies you have to think about when you watch them others you can watch and forget, with this version of The Hulk you have to think so using your brain cells is a must which I know is REALLY hard for some members of the moving going general public, must be all the \\"E's\\" in the butter popcorn they are eating is all I can say. <br />

B0002YLC24|5.0|i agree with the other reviewers in their glowing reviews of this movie.  revisiting the characters from Before Sunrise 9 years later was a masterful stroke by Linklater, Delpy and Hawke - but the love story they're unfolding for us in this very strict timeframe has less to do with falling in love again and more to do with how passionate people can destroy themselves and remake themselves with the right impetus, and how one night can permanently alter how the rest of your life unfolds.<br /><br />it is true that over the course of the movie, you discover a lot about both Jesse and Celine, and that you see their love blooming again.  but it is also true that you discover they both held a torch for each other for years, and it damaged their ability to get close to others.  when they meet again, they both have immense walls in place.  they say things and interact with each other from behind those walls.  as they progress through their incredibly short time together, they say things which are more emotionally true and which partly disprove their original statements.  they begin share the more honest aspects of their lives.  Hawke, in a few Q&As after the movie, likened it to an onion when i asked him about it - that in the intimacy and connection the two of them have, their walls get removed like layers of an onion, until they are truly open before each other.<br /><br />i found this to be the best movie of 2004 - but that is likely because the emotional contexts of both characters resonates very deeply with me.  passion barely held in check, brought out moment to moment in real time.  quite a beautiful thing to watch.

0312995423|3.0|I read 4 chapters and put it down, disgusted with the Harlequin Romance style of the character portrayals (we need another hero whose \\"strong jaw and taut features reminded Susan of carved marble\\"?)    Giving it a second chance, I got through it, but it leaves me feeling cheated.  The \\"surprises\\" were all too obvious beforehand and many of the story's premises fall apart due to the totally wrong beliefs the author has about computers and security.  I won't go into most of them; if you don't know any more than the author on these subjects, the book could be an enjoyable read.  Just don't take any of his technical descriptions as realistic, and be willing to believe that NSA's best minds would risk compromise of top secret data rather than shut down for a couple hours to purge a computer virus.  For that matter, be willing to accept that the NSA would actually have Internet connections to a top-secret database, rather than use the separate classified military networks.

B000066NW0|2.0|I remember when I was a much younger person, in mind that is, and everything that was feed to me through the TV or radio was always something great. I use to pay close attention to the Top 40 Charts and listen to every song on it religiously. I use to turn on the TV everyday and watch TRL to catch a new vedio, or just to watch the old ones all over again. Thankfully, those days of being spoon-feed the same exact stuff through the radio waves, is all over. Sure, I still listen to the Top 40s if there is a song on it that I like, and I still occasionally turn on the TV and watch a video, if its worth devoting my time to, but I don't do all those things with the same obsessiveness that I use to. As I've grown up, I've realized that I have a mind of my own and can choose to listen to whatever I want to listen to. <br /> <br />The music itself is really quite catchy. Its apparent that there's some kind of talent coming from somewhere, but from whom? Is it all coming from Avril? Of course not, because Avril doesn't play any of the instruments. And don't say I don't know what I'm talking about. I checked the sleeve in the CD, and looked at the list of all the people and what they did in the band. There was a guitarist, a bassist, and a drummer, but Avril isn't any one of these. Its rather quite questionable as to whether Avril contributes anything towards this band except for her voice, don't you think?  <br /> <br />I'm not saying that being in a band and only being a vocalist is wrong. There are many great vocalists out there that I like and are in a band; take Chester from Linkin Park, for example. But what sets Avril apart from Chester? Chester is in a band called Linkin Park, Avril is in a band called... my my, what have we here... the band is named after her! Imagine that, being in a band named after you and you don't play any of the insturments.  <br /> <br />I just think that you should give credit where credits due, and that doesn't seem to be what Avril Lavigne,the 'band', is all about.

I just want to say that the illustrated edition is the best way to read \\"The Da Vinci code\\"  It much more enjoyable to be able to see Pics of the places and the art work and see the clues your self.  With out the pics you have to get out the encyclopedia or go on line and start searching.  If you are going to read \\"Da Vinci\\" then I highly recommend this edition.  [...]

B0001Z363W|5.0|First off, let me say this is one of my favorite bands. I just got Hangover Music Volume 6 and I absolutely love it. It is a good change of pace from their heavy, head-banging metal. It is a much more melodic turn. My favorite tracks are Steppin Stone and Whiter Shade of Pale. SDMF.
0790749815|5.0|A sublime, suspenseful confection from Alfred Hitchcock, 1959's \\"North by Northwest\\" has become a classic addition to the master's canon even though it lacks the risk-taking gravity of his then-just-released \\"Vertigo\\" or the blood-curdling thrills of his next classic film, \\"Psycho\\". This stands the test of time as a sophisticated thriller that is alternately clever and contrived, fast-paced and glamorous.<br /><br />It is the ideal showcase for the debonair but innately accessible Cary Grant, starring as the prototypical wronged man who unwillingly embarks on a perilous odyssey away from the comfortably insulated life he led. Grant seems to thrive best when his character, a successful Madison Avenue advertising executive named Roger Thornhill, is put in inexplicable situations that build into a series of unforeseen events leading ultimately to a seemingly conspiratorial group of spies and assassins by way of a variety of locales that includes Grand Central Station, the United Nations building and Mount Rushmore. For someone used to making up the \\"truth\\" in advertising copy for marketing purposes, Thornhill is vulnerable to his own medicine at a much higher cost...his life. After getting abducted by a pair of thugs, he is forced to drink a pint of bourbon under the mistaken assumption that he is a government undercover Federal agent. A murder frame-up follows, and then he is on the run as an implicated suspect. He takes on yet another identity while confronted with even more mayhem and a world of espionage, an unbelieving mother, and Eve Kendall, a mysterious blonde, played with surprising elan by Eva Marie Saint. One wonders why she didn't play more femme fatales during her career...she seems a natural at it. Is it all a little too far-fetched? You bet. But under Hitchcock's sure direction and recognizable visual style, it is also one of the most supremely entertaining of movies.<br /><br />There are a plethora of memorable scenes, set pieces really for Hitchcock to concoct some suspense in order to showcase his unique visual style. These include the wonderful crop-dusting sequence where Thornhill tries to outrun a nefarious biplane into a dried-up cornfield, the knifing of the real Lester Townsend at the UN and the final scaling of Mount Rushmore's Presidential faces to escape the villains. That's where appropriately the final salvation occurs, and Thornhill and Kendall then end up in the upper berth of a Pullman car just as they started. The film is filled with many humorous touches such as Thornhill's drunken scene at the police station (preceded by a rather politically incorrect drunk driving chase sequence), the extended seduction scenes between Thornhill and Kendall on the train, the auction scene where Thornhill is trying to get captured by the police to avoid the spies, and his unexpected marriage proposal as the lovers hang precariously between Washington's and Jefferson's foreheads. James Mason lends his particular savoir faire to the role of duplicitous foreign spy Phillip Vandamm, and a young Martin Landau is appropriately sinister as the sexually questionable henchman, Leonard. Much of the credit for the film's success belongs to Ernest Lehman, who penned the original screenplay, and Bernard Herrmann for his atmospheric score.  The DVD includes a brief, informative making-of documentary hosted by Saint.spense in order to showcase his unique visual style.

1401301363|4.0|Nigella Lawson is totally fabulous and I love her show, but like any kind of porn, it's a lot more entertaining than it is practical. Just as I'm unlikely to invite the UPS man into my boudoir, I'm also unlikely to have fistfuls of fresh herbs and exotic spices lying around my kitchen. I was all excited about a lamb recipe in \\"Feast\\"--until Nigella started talking about what I should tell my butcher about preparing the meat. My butcher? The only butcher shops in my neighborhood are scary places with whole sheep in the windows. And a \\"homemade granola\\" recipe called for brown rice syrup, an item likely to set me back five bucks or so at the health food store. So much for saving money on making my own granola! That said, the book is gorgeous and Nigella is fun to spend time with, as usual. \\"Feast\\" is more for the nightstand than the kitchen, but it's still worth having.
B00030590I|5.0|This film was very well made. Not only was the storyline interesting, but the beautifully filmed scenes will take your breath away. All of the actors did a wonderful job. Though I liked Crouching Tiger, I consider this to be the superior film. Crouching Tiger got bogged down with too much emotional drama despite the wonderful fight scenes. This movie kept it simple with enough extra elements to keep it interesting. Ignore the posters arguing about politics, communism..blah blah blah. You connect with the characters and eagerly await what happens next. That is what a film is supposed to do. A fantastic movie that is worthing buying.
B0002Y69NG|5.0|If indeed Sophia Stewart submitted her idea to the Wachowski brothers in 1981, she needs some professional guidance in more ways than one. The Wachowski brothers were aged 14 and 16 in 1981, and it's highly doubtful they were looking for script ideas to use 18 years later.  <br /> <br />Doesn't it seem like the media would have jumped all over this, if true, instead of some underground paper? Use some common sense.
B0002KVUKM|5.0|Hugh Jackman stars in this exciting movie as Van Helsing,a former priest who is sent by the clergy to Transylvania to save the final surviving members of a family who have been fighting Dracula for four centuries.  These surviving members will be doomed to extinction unless Dracula is destroyed before the last family member dies.  So Van Helsing and is trusty sidekick Carl (David Wenham) set off to face Dracula with an arsenal of weapons to aid them, including a cool repeating crossbow. <br /> <br />One in Transylvania, Van Helsing and Carl meet Anna Valerious, played by Kate Beckinsale. It is her family that has been trying to destroy Dracula for so long.  Now, the three must band together to kill Dracula before it is too late for Anna. <br /> <br />This is an excellent movie, and the special effects are some of the best that I've ever seen before.  The beginning of the movie was my favorite part.  The black and white scenes of the attack on Castle Frankenstein reminded me of the Frankenstein movies from the 1930s with Boris Karloff.  Even the scene in which the townspeople burn down the windmill with Dr. Frankenstein and his monster trapped inside is carefully reproduced from the original film.  The monsters in the movie are really scary as well, especially the werewolf which attacks Anna's brother.  Dracula's \\"wives\\" flying and attacking the townsfolk while Van Helsing shoots at them with his crossbow is exciting to watch, as well. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this movie.  Hugh Jackman, Kate Beckinsale, and David Wenham give excellent performances, but Richard Roxburgh's portrayal as Dracula is the best performance of the movie.  Shuler Hensley does a fine job as well as Frankenstein's monster.  Watch this exciting and thrilling movie and see the Wolfman, Frankenstein, and Dracula all together in the same film.
078401213X|5.0|I got this movie a while ago and never got around to really watching it. So I turn it on to hear some very dark sounding technoish music. Then, in your face, the pi symbol. Numbers go flying by in an amazing opening scene not drawn out but will give you a good feel of whats ahead.  <br /> <br />The movie takes you through a short period of life of a paranoid genius on the edge of complete insanity. Contantly needing pills to control himself, he ends up going on odd trips that you don't know if they are real, or in his head. He has spent years looking for patterns in the stock market, hoping to find a pattern that will help him unlock the key to the world. Others want what is in his head just as much as he does, money hungry stock brokers and a group of Jewish mathmaticians. <br /> <br />This entire film is in black and white, and grainy black and white. You can't always tell what is going on but it really adds to the movie as a whole. The camera works is amazingly creative. The angles and shots used are phenominal and make you feel like you are inside his mind. <br /> <br />Bottom line, great movie. Not reccomended for those who are easily disturbed as this movie can get disturbing as his insanity progresses.
1400032717|5.0|As the story opens, a dog named Wellington has just been killed, and 15-year old Christopher decides to find the killer.  This is the basic plot of the book, but it is not the most important part.<br /><br />The book is mostly about what it's like inside the mind of an autistic boy, for Christopher, the narrator of the story, is autistic.  We learn he is obsessed with details and calms himself by doing complex math problems in his head.<br /><br />Christopher's world is full of potential dangers - people touching him, loud noises, new places - that send him into a panic of screaming and hitting.  He has rituals to help protect himself, such as avoiding the colors yellow and brown, hiding in very small places, and counting cars to see if it's going to be a good day or a bad day.  His parents are patient and understanding, but they have problems of their own.<br /><br />I recommend this unique book to those interested in autism and to those who appreciate outstanding writing.  This book will educate you and maybe even break your heart.<br /><br />Kona
B000002J1M|5.0|This is a definitive album of early 70s progressive rock. It has everything that a progressive rock album should have. A bit over the top, a great start, and that long song to fill an entire side. The album starts off with the unforgettable Watcher of the Skies. This song is sweeping and majestic while still staying concise enough for you to remember every part. Time Table, while not nessicarily a great, is still good enough and a good transition between the heavy hitters. Get Em' Out By Friday is a fast paced song which doesn't get tedious even after many listens. <br /> <br />I like to consider the next three songs the second half of the album, although only two of the three songs on my \\"second half\\" are really on the other side. Can Ultility is just an amazing song, its main beat of guitar and synths are great as Collins accents every main beat with a nice crash of the cymbal. Horizons is a short guitar only song leading up to the epic \\"Supper's Ready\\". This is a song you have to hear for yourself, clocking in at twenty-three minutes long its a monster of a song. Its hard to describe Supper's Ready, but once you get it... You got it. <br /> <br />Like Genesis? Like Progressive Rock? Get this album.
B0002KVUKM|2.0|I saw the ads and read all the buzz about this movie so I thought it might be pretty good, I was disappointed. I wondered what was going on with the B/W intro, turns out that was a flashback- it looked about as good as any part of the movie. For the rest you get an odd mix of action, some humor bits (including the James Bondish weapons lab in the Vatican Cellars, and the friar who develops some of them), and a lot of visuals. <br />I'd get this one for the extra's,(I'd love to see how they did all of that stuff),not the movie itself.  <br />Spend less than twice the money and get any season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, you'll get better value.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|This movie makes me tear up almost from the very beginning seeing the sights and sounds of Tokyo, Japan....<br /><br />To those of you who say this is a wildly depressing horrible flick, let me play devil's advocate with you. OF COURSE.  Bob and Charlotte are NOT happy in Japan.  Sofia wanted you to feel what her characters are feeling.  There is major frustration, loneliness...why am I here...they are LOST!!! for lack of a better phrase.  Remember, we don't even have subtitles when we hear Japanese.  And Bob doesn't hear the whole translation (I can promise you that) when he does receive his interpretation.<br /><br />Anyhow, I could nitpick on the fact that they have Japanese speak with \\"l's\\"...like the escort that wants him to \\"lip her stockings\\" and the photographer that wants him to look \\"lock and loll\\" cos that is impossible.  It's not a sound in the Japanese language...they say \\"r\\" sounds and wouldn't need to substitute the \\"l\\".<br /><br />But it was a beautifully written love story that didn't need sex to have it go anywhere which is a rarity these days.  I was tearing up at the end.  Granted I'm emotional...but this was a lovely film.<br /><br />Domo arigato!
B000007WNN|5.0|I noticed a lot of people who loved their first two albums diss this one. Let me guess you probaly also like new wave and punk which is fine, but people tend to forget the Cult are an eclectic band that doesn't honor just one genre or have a signature sound and never make the same album twice and if it ticked you off that they cranked up their sound well then i'm glad they did. I like all the cult's albums old and new and theyone of my favorites.
B0000931OG|5.0|This is without doubt the best blur record ever. This has it all: Punk on We've got a file on You.  <br />Electronica on Ambulance and others. <br />Traditional Blur on Good Song, Out of Time and others <br />And Jazz on the excellent track: Jets <br />  <br />Plus a lot more.
B0006399FS|5.0|This is the first review on any music CD I've ever written.  I've read the critics' \\"expert\\" reviews and have seen this get under 2* by the Chicago Tribune to 4* by Rolling Stone.  I purchased this CD today and can I am absolutely impressed.  Is this a revolutionary CD?  No it isn't, but it's just plain fantastic music.  If you liked the Joshua Tree and - obvioulsly you did - otherwise you wouldn't be reading this review, you will absolutely love this CD.  Is it as good as U2's landmark album the Joshua Tree?  No, but in my view, it's their best album since that classic.  If your a U2 fan, buy this album!!!
140004281X|5.0|Alice Munro may well be the best short story writer working today, but what's strange is that at first it's a little hard to see why she's so good.  She doesn't use any fancy-pants language, she doesn't worry about making her characters warm and sympathetic, and she doesn't try to reach at the typical sorts of short story epiphanies, the straining towards lyrical proclaiming and the conclusive moment of a personal vision's consolidation.   <br /> <br />What she offers instead is a conversational tone that is quirky and fractured enough to rise above the blandness of a typical conversational style.  For example, this is how she renders a crucial scene in one story where the protagonist has entered the house of a man she has a crush on.  Note the parenthesis, the incongruous academic metaphor, and the sentence fragments: \\"Juliet hears the door of the truck close, she hears him speaking to the dog, and dread comes over her.  She wants to hide somewhere (she says later, I could have crawled under the table, but of course she does not think of doing anything so ridiculous).  It's like the moment at school before the winner of the prize is announced.  Only worse, because she has no reasonable hope.  And because there will never be another chance so momentous in her life.\\"   <br /> <br />Furthermore, her stories don't so much ask us to root for the characters so much as to examine them, to consider their mistakes and misperceptions.  For example, Munro's stories often break out into reflective moments like this one:  \\"While she was running away from him - now - Clarke still kept his place in her life.  But when she was finished running away, when she just went on, what would she put in his place?  What else - who else - could ever be so vivid a challenge?\\"  Personally, I was rooting for her only insofar as she really did want to leave her husband, who's rather grouchy and mean and worth ditching.  But Munro doesn't care about making her into an idealized romantic hero; sheinstead wants to depict something far more difficult to understand, which is why the character would stay with her husband. <br /> <br />Also, rather than being a steady climb towards a typical epiphany, her stories derive their structure from what might be called \\"the coincidental epiphany.\\"  What I mean by that term is that, over and over in her stories, there are moments of crucial importance that also happen to be utterly coincidental.  These moments come as utter surprises and derive their incredible power from the way they occupy the climaxes of a story, the places where what's supposed to be the focus is the protagonist's action and the question of whether it succeeds or fails.  Munro's \\"coincidental epiphanies\\" instead recontextualize the concerns that led to the protagonist's actions in the first place.  <br /> <br />By way of illustration, I'll do a long quotation.  The \\"trick\\" this passage refers to had accidentally ruined a love affair the protagonist was in; she is just now realizing that what seemed to be have been fate was really just the result of this random, accidental \\"trick\\":  <br /> <br />\\"It was all spoiled in one day, in a couple of minutes, not by fits and starts, struggles, hopes and losses, in the long-drawn-out way that such things are more often spoiled.  And if it's true that things are usually spoiled, isn't the quick way the easier way to bear? <br /> <br />But you don't really take that view, not for yourself.  Robin doesn't.  Even now she can yearn for her chance.  She is not going to spare a moment's gratitude for the trick that has been played.  But she'll come round to being grateful for the discovery of it.  That, at least - the discovery which leaves everything whole, right up to the moment of frivolous intervention.  Leaves you outraged, but warmed from a distance, clear of shame.\\" <br /> <br />Throughout her stories, it's as if Munro is saying, \\"the crucial moments in life are often the coincidences, not the moments of decision and action that we think of as the real core of our lives.  Stories should thus focus on these moments in order to understand and cope with them.\\"  In other words, Munro is a perfect guide to the farcical aspects of human life, the overlooked details and unexpected twists that change everything. <br />
0375805621|2.0|My son read the origional, and instantly fell in love with it.  So, I couldn't have been more excited when I found \\"Another Monster\\".  But when we received it, and read it immediately, we couldn't have been more disappointed.  The addition of Elmo was nice, but the story just did not flow properly.  At best, it is just a poor immitation of the first.

0451197968|5.0|The Running Man may well be the most stunningly prophetic novel Stephen King ever wrote. 50 pages from the end of the novel, I realized he was going to have Ben Richards fly a plane into the side of a New York City skyscraper. The passage is worth quoting:<br /><br />\\"Heeling over slightly, the Lockheed struck the Games Building dead on, three quarters of the way up. Its tanks were still better than a quarter full. Its speed was slightly over five hundred miles an hour. The explosion was tremendous, lighting up the night like the wrath of God, and it rained fire twenty blocks away.\\"<br /><br />The Running Man was published in 1982.<br /><br />Aside from what may have just been a stunning fictional coincidence of what we've all come to know in our own post-9/11 lives, the story of The Running Man itself may well be the most thoroughly entertaining novel of King's career. In the introduction to the collection from which I read, he mentions that he wrote it in a 72-hour period and published it with little or no edits.<br /><br />What The Running Man may lack in polish and grammatical acumen, it makes up for with sheer energy and a torrential pace unlike any other novel I've ever read. It may well be the fastest read you will ever experience. It's like one of those super-high-speed rollercoasters that can do upwards of 150 miles per hour. It's extremely intense, extremely fast, and extremely fun.<br /><br />The book and the movie are different. The book sets up Ben Richards as a family man who has no other choice than to go on this game show called \\"The Running Man,\\" wherein contestants are hunted down and killed for the entertainment pleasure of television audiences. Ben's young daughter is dying of pneumonia, and he and his wife don't have the money to take her to a doctor. If he wins the game show, he saves his daughter; he's a ready-made hero you absolutely want to cheer for!<br /><br />Also, the book allows Ben the entire landscape of New England in which to run, so we see him in New York and Boston and in the skies over Pennsylvania. Similar to the movie, Ben turns out to be more resourceful than executives with the game show had anticipated, and he ends up killing a lot of people.<br /><br />The Running Man is not a novel for everyone, but if you do want to read it, chances are you'll end up loving it. It's a great read, and I highly recommend it. It's one of those early Stephen King novels for which I would love to see a new movie version; I think a new movie could be very effective if it brought in Ben as the desperate family man we see in the book; it could entertain a new generation. I think people would like to see it. I guess I just wish there were more sci-fi novels like this, man. It's really a classic. And, of course, I hope this review is helpful to you!<br /><br />Stacey Cochran, author of The Kiribati Testin which to run, so we see him in New York and Boston and in the skies over Pennsylvania.

B00005JKJA|5.0|This movie....totally....before this I beileved that Clockwork Orange was the weirdest movie I've ever seen but this film totally blew that movie 10x out of the water my friends....I am giving this so much credit because how thought provoking it actually is....I still don't know how to decipher what is it about, My english teacher and my freinds have also seen it and the only explaination I got was that life is not static and things can change...but if you're in for about 2 hours of full-blown imgination and freakiness...enjoy.
B0002KVUKM|2.0|Granted this movie had good fighting scenes, but other than that I found this movie a flop. The scenes were too fast, the plot was too thin, or maybe they just wanted you to make it up as you go along which I don't appreciate. I can't even truly explain this movie. The characters hardly described themselves and the romance between Jackman and Beckingsale was way too artifical. It seemed like more of an infautuation then actual love. I will admit I did like Dracula's brides as white- winged creatures, that was a good idea, and Dracula's children actually was somewhat a good idea as well, but aside from that I saw no other compliments for this movie. I was indeed expecting much more from the movie, especially from the actors themselves. I think the main problem was they smashed all these legends into one and exerted all their energy on modernizing the creatures and they completley forgot about the entire rest of the world revolving around the creatures. I must admit, nonetheless, that aside from everything, Hugh jackman was as I thought Van helsing always appeared.
B000063DFN|5.0|OH YEAH!!!! this album truely is the essence of metal, i love the Maiden guitar melodies and solos and the great bass lines and what not, Really, there's not that many bassists that are THAT involved in writing the music and lyrics on almost all the songs, Harris is great songwriter. The songs that got my attention was Aces High, i just love the whole song, and of course 2 minutes to midnight(get's stuck in my head all the time)....oh and the avril fan, i think it IS sarcasmn if you look at all the reviews she's done and read them, at least i hope so, lol no can be the musically challenged, can they?
B0002YHFZC|5.0|How can these people call them un-talented? A recent review below said the following, \\" Jack can not play guitar or write his way out a paperbag.\\" Seeing this movie you know he is one of the greats in rock and roll history. And who cares that Meg isn't the greatest drummer? She has very good rythem and is always on beat at all time with Jack. The Directing is  wonderful for the use of the Super 8mm. The close ups on Jack shows you just how crazy Jack is when he plays and just how passionate Meg is when she is playing her drums. The band also has a great chemistry with the crowd as Jack and Meg thanks them after the show and gives the a little \\"God Bless.\\" The White Stripes are the saviors of rock and roll, and for that, that is why they are my FAVORITE band. <br /> <br />Jack White= Robert Plant and Jimmy Page Combined.
B0006399FS|5.0|I bought U2's \\"How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb\\" the day after my mother died...and I have to say I have been playing it continually whenever I am driving alone in my car since then. I just cry the whole time...it's better that I do that on my own as I blast it...I feel like I am flying through heaven. It needs to be played LOUD. I pray along with it, too. <br />  I knew that Bono's father had died of cancer three years ago, and to me it seems a lot of this CD is inspired by that loss and experience, because the lyrics and music seem to speak to me in this way...I also am very moved by his eloquence and honesty in his beautiful expression of true love for his wife through his words...the aren't many artists in rock music today who have this ability...Sara McLaughlin is the only other performer I can think of right now who transcends the average and mundane... <br />   The night before my mother passed away, my father was repeating over and over, \\"Isn't she so beautiful?  She is so beautiful\\"...my mother had been fighting colon cancer for the last three years.  She had only a few strands of gray hair remaining, looked withered and sick and weak.  She was so luminous and beautiful, though, as she had lived with the strongest will and knowledge that her life was a precious gift of God...her beauty genuinely came from within.  My mother had been a pediatric nurse for over 40 years, and had devoted her life to her patients and the hospital in which she now struggled to breathe...in the song,\\"The City of Brilliant Lights\\", Bono sings, \\"Oh, you look so beautiful tonight\\" and I think of her and this truth... I guess I am really moved by this sentiment and all the fantastic songs on this CD.  There is not one dud of the eleven. Please listen to this CD a few times in a row if you are not convinced of how great it is.  The layers of the songs need to be heard over and over to be fully revealed.  <br />
B0001IN0DA|4.0|This is Mudd.  This is not greatest event ever on the biggest stage ever and this shows some of the best and some of the worst matches ever.    Big Show vs. John Cena for the U.S. Title.  This was a decent way to kick off Wrestlemania but it could have been a lot better and Cena wins his first championship. (6/10)    Booker T & RVD vs. Garrison Cade & Mark Jindrak vs. Dudley Boyz vs. La Resistance for the World Tag Titles.  This was a very good match and I thought it was pretty awesome when RVD kicked 9 guys straight and then he hits a Frog Splash to win.  This match was quick but good. (6/10)    Christian vs. Chris Jericho was a match that I thought was gonna suck but it was one of the better matches of the PPV and it was 20 minutes long.  Trish turns on Jericho and helps Christian win the match. (8/10)    Rock 'n' Sock Connection vs. Evolution was a great match any many people don't give it credit for being awesome.  I see reviewers are writing that Evolution needed to win to continue into Backlash.  NOT TRUE AT ALL!!!  If Rock'n' Sock would have won you could have had Rock vs. Batista at Backlash and who doesn't want to see that. (8.5/10)    Sable & Torrie Wilson vs. Stacy Keibler & Miss Jackie in an Evining Gown Match.  This match is just horrible don't watch unless you want to see Sable, Torrie & Stacy strip to nothing at all and watch Torrie pull Jackie panties off at the end and show Jackie's [...]. (4/10)    Rey Mysterio vs. Chavo Guerrero vs. Tajiri vs. Billy Kidman vs. Shannon Moore vs. Funaki vs. Ultimo Dragon vs. Akio vs. Jaime Noble vs. Nunzio for the Cruiserweight Title.  Was way to fast and ever minute somebody got eliminated and I went to go get a soda and when I got back half of the guys were already gone I was like what the Heck?   Chavo cheats to retain the title. (5.5/10)    Goldberg vs. Brock Lesnar with Stone Cold Steve Austin as Special Guest Referee.  This match was so slow that I could have gone to Madison Square Garden and back and it wouldstill be on.  Goldberg won after a Jackhammer Slam and then Austin stunned both of them. (5.5/10)    Molly Holly vs. Victoria for the Women's Title.  This match was horrible but only watch it if you want to see Molly get her head shaved after Victoria wins. (4.5/10)    APA vs. World's Greatest Tag Team vs. Rikishi & Scotty 2 Hotty & Basham Brothers for the WWE Tag Titles.  This match was not as good as the Raw match and this match ended with Rikishi sitting on a Basham to retain. (5.5/10)    Eddie Guerrero vs. Kurt Angle for the WWE Title.  This match is nothing like Brock vs. Eddie at No Way Out.  This match was great but not as great as their match at Summerslam.  Eddie retains the title when he untied his boot and Angle had the Ankle Lock but Guerrero slipped the boot off and then rolled Kurt up. (9/10)    Undertaker vs. Kane was a match that was the return of Undertaker and he finally lost that Biker Dude gimmick and no he's actually good again and Kane payed big time for trying to kill him. (5.5/10)    Triple H vs. Chris Benoit vs. Shawn Michaels for the World Title.  This match was not as good as people say it is and I loved it but I didn't think the work was great and Shawn was slow after he cut himself and got useless.  Benoit wins the World Title and celebrates with Guerrero. (8.5/10)      Wrestlemania is really overrated and I would know because I watch it every day and it is not that great.
B00005YW4H|1.0|If you've heard this track in the radio you might think WOW!, I thought so too, but then my co-worker bought it and as we started listening to the following tracks I grew more and more disappointed. This ain't jazz! How dare they put this album in the Jazz section? <br /> <br />The choice of compositions is very poor, so Amazon: I'm sorry,I love you and all for making the English world available to me in Japan and the books, Cd's and videos I've bought from you and all but I'm going to recommend the singer Jenna Mammina instead. <br /> <br />Who? Jenna Jemima?  <br />Well, if you like Norah's voice, but you don't like the style because is just watered down, a la Britney, you will love Jenna, who not only has a better voice than Norah and probably hates being compared to this newcomer kid, but must also think how unfair life must be since she sings better and has been around for longer and it is Norah the one with the dollar-stashed contracts. <br /> <br />So here she is:  <br />[...]   <br />go listen to Jenna, compare and make your choice, real Jazz, real voice technique and much more bang for the buck, or the watered down, neutered jazz that the big corp music industry is offering. <br />Is like Kuervo vs. Himador, any true Mexican will recognize the real tequila right away! <br />Sorry Amazon, you should sell Jenna's Cd's, fans won't be disappointed.
B000268QB2|3.0|\\"Hopes and Fears\\" sounds like the music was written in Cappella. The Lyrics follow traditional writing for the most part. The recording was done very well. The album was produced by Andy Green and the band. Hopes and Fears makes me feel a little hypnotized. All the songs have the same feel to them. The music takes you somewhere, but I don't know where. It does not make me feel sad nor does it make me feel happy. My biggest reluctance with this album is that it does not invoke any emotion for me. I can't really tell what the story teller is feeling in the song. It is NOT boreing, instead very easy to listen to. I have no favorite songs from the album, but again there are no songs that I don't like. I guess the album leaves me saying hmm. So you can see why I rated this album with three stars. For those trying to decide if they want to buy this album, I will say that the price is very low online or at your local discount store. I will also note that I know of alot of people that really like this album.

An extra bonus is Guy's talent for entertaining while teaching. The Art of the Start is more than required reading for entrepreneurs trying to break into the venture world: it's the best entrepreneur's bible around, and should be a well worn and dog-eared companion, a quick-start guide for each crucial element of what's needed to get up and running. I recommend it to every aspiring entrepreneur I advise.
B0002Y69NQ|5.0|A true 'Ultimate Edition' of any DVD is hard to find (OK, pretty much impossible), but this Matrix collection comes to the 99% mark. What's missing? The soundtracks. Yep, that's all. It's hard to find superlative adjectives above 'ultimate', maybe 'super-ultimate', but all we need is a sound track inclusion. Maybe with Star Wars...
B00005JMCW|5.0|This movie is totally great to see, starting on the fun of Jamie Lee Curtis to end in its content. This is a very good comedy which is very simple and I have to say, better than 1977's Freaky Friday. It is a good movie if you want to relax and have fun. Also, the songs they perform in the movie are cool (Take Me Away and Ultimate), they actually sing very well. In the documentary, hosted by Lindsay Lohan, Jamie Lee Curtis makes lots of jokes and you start laughing when you watch it, and she is so funny, as an actress and as a real person.<br /><br />The performances of Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis are very good; they act very good, and the movie really make you laugh, in the whole movie; starting right after the titles, until the last 5 seconds of the movie.<br /><br />I hardly recomend it because it is a great comedy, and a great movie for all ages.
B0000669JL|5.0|Aruably the best \\"greatest hits\\" collection of any artist out there, \\"Legend\\" gives a good glimpse of all the reasons Bob Marley is famous and even iconic. The reggae sound makes his music unique and pioneering, the catchiness makes the songs appealing on a \\"pop\\" level, and the soul and spirit of Bob's voice makes the lyrics as meaningful and poignant today as they were in the 1970s.  Every song on here is a gem, from the slow jamming of \\"I Want to Love You,\\" the upbeat and steady guitar of \\"Could you Be Loved,\\" and the soulful live version of \\"No Woman No Cry.\\" Bob Marley died young and tragically, and it's impossible to predict whether the rest of his life would have proven to be as creatively brilliant and prolific.  Nonetheless, this album deserves all the praise it has been given over the years.  It is a nice introduction to Bob's legacy.
B00007J5VN|2.0|I saw this movie years ago, but didn't remember much about it, except some of the songs, and the basic story.  I also saw \\"Nights of Cabiria\\", from which the story was taken. I love musicals, and I<br /><br />think Shirley MacLaine is very talented.  She is very sweet as Charity Hope Valentine, and one can't help wanting a happy ending for her.  So why did I think this movie was awful? First of all, some of the dialogue was so repetitious it became irritating-- how many times can you listen to Charity say \\"Fickle finger of fate\\" over and over without wanting to hit the mute button?  Also, some of the scenes went on and on and on-- especially the elevator scene.  And-- the intermission was totally unnecessary. But the worst disappointment for me was the musical numbers. I didn't like any of them--- they were so far over the top as to be silly.  Bob Fosse must have thrown everything into them that he could--- instead of letting the dancers and the songs carry the numbers, he had so much busyness in all of them-- too many people, costumes that didn't fit the story, silly moves-- and they all went past the point of enjoyment.  I fast forwarded thru<br /><br />a couple of them just to get them over with.  I have never done that before with any movie. This could have been so much better-- the story was good, the charactors were good-- but the whole thing should have been toned down. The movie could have been 30 minutes shorter if there had been some trimming. It was entirely too long.  Also--- all that stop action-- what was that all about? I know, I know-- it was to show the progress of the story, but it was a distraction.<br /><br />I didn't like the movie and was glad when it was over.
B00000FZ1V|5.0|When I received my first ever DVD player, this was the DVD I bought. My parents loved Bill Murray and Dan Ackroyd from SNL, so they had to get it on tape one day. And I got to watch it with them. Love the music, the comedy and, on the DVD, all the special additions, especially the dialouge from the directors.<br /><br />This is worth the purchase!
B00005QIPH|5.0|I came across 'Last Night' and expected it to be a bright spot on the album, but was blown away at the vibrancy of this album. I picked up the album while with my wife in Hawaii for a week, and it never left the stereo. We played it over and over, and when we got back to the mainland, my wife continued to keep it in her 6-cd rotation int he car for months.<br /><br />Favorites include 'Soma,' Alone, Together,' 'Take it or Leave it,' and of course the incredible 'Last Night.'<br /><br />Missing from the US release is the song 'New York City Cops' which is also pretty good. You can find it on the UK release (with the pantless girl) or on the 'Hard to Explain' single.
B000002JR8|5.0|Dimebag was and will always be one of my two favorite guitarists, along with Kirk Hammett.  No matter what kind of music you listen to, you can't help but be inspired by his frenzied riffs and blazing solos.  He was and will continue to be an absolute inspiration to my own appreciation for lead guitar and music.  His legacy will live on, in part due to this album, one of Pantera's crowning achievements.

B000002IZM|5.0|For those who saw the film more than once, ten times, who knows, the soundtrack is part of their cellular memory. The film and the music are one. The creators of the film, music and script unconsciously fell into one same creative tempo that gave birth to this hypnotizing experience that Blade Runner takes us through. I, for one, cannot play the music without falling into deep feeling and emotion, something beyond myself. I fell in love with the music and images from the first frame of the movie.

It's really a wonderful book.

B00028HBKM|3.0|Gibson's disturbing depiction of Christ's last 12 hours on earth, from the prayer at the Garden of Gethsemane to his crucifixion, burial and resurrection, is supposed to be an authentic reproduction of the Gospel accounts.  One could quibble with him here and there with the period details, but for the most parts they are spot-on, including the use of Aramaic and Latin, and the costume design and art direction.  What is more controversial is Gibson's choice of violence, used throughout the film, as Christ is being scourged and flayed to such a degree as to bleed the screen red all the time.  Did the Gospel portray such a bloody killing?   No one knows, but scientifically one has to suspend disbelief as any human being would have died long ago from such beatings, unless one is -- as possibly from Gibson's viewpoint -- miraculously conceived to suffer.  James Caviezel's Christ is a mute disfigurement of a person -- one who is born to endure than do anything else; depending on one's interpretation of the Gospels, this may either a travesty or an enlightenment of Christ's mission.      Gibson's film raises important theological questions for anyone who watches the movie.  Gibson claims that he is not attacking the Jewish community, but his portrayal is misleading -- he takes away one important speech (\\"it is better for one man to suffer than for the whole nation to do so\\") and categorizes Caiaphas into a bloodthirsty high priest, changing certain key moments (including Peter's denial of Jesus, which does not happen here in a courtyard).  Other violent scenes are gratuitous: like the crow's pecking of the thief's eye.  There are flashbacks of Christ's teaching,  but Gibson's film relegates these to backseat as he emphasizes the torture chamber of the killing.  At the start of the film Gibson quotes Isaiah 53: \\"By his wounds we are healed\\". At the end of this film, we are as transgressed as Christ but hardly healed.    Take away the slow-mo close-ups of violence, what is left of \\"The Passion\\" is very simple: a tale of a distraught mother, an adrogynous-looking Satan, and a sympathetic Pilate -- a more conventional movie than the reviews would allow.   As some will argue, the result is well-meaning -- certainly watchable (for all it's brutalities), but it's very hard to see it as spiritual or moral manna to anyone.
B00003CXA6|2.0|After a hard session of exams, I wanted to grab a film that would pull my thoughts away from the long hours of study. I came across this one and thought \\"great, a history film !\\" So, there I was embarked for over four hours of interesting war stories, or so I hoped. At the end, I ask myself how I could hold on and see it in one straight session. In fact, I concur with several reviewers who qualify it as an unconvincing film.     The actors (and some of them are good, confirmed actors) are extremely \\"theatrical\\" at times, extremely \\"soulless\\" at others.   They spend too much time talking in an unconvincing way about philosophical issues or collateral matters that don't bring anything constructive into the story or the film. The result is that the film never really \\"takes off\\". I don't know if this is a problem with the script, the direction, or if the ambitious project of recreating a historical battle just overwhelmed almost everybody in this project. The fact remains that, in my humble opinion, the only one that really keeps his head above water is Tom Berenger. Also, some actors just pop into the film out of the blue for no apparent reason (for instance that general from the confederates who visits Lee before the great battle to be severely criticized by his commander in chief for not following orders, and we never hear from him again), others, such as Sam Elliot, just disappear after starring in the first part of the film and we don't really know why and what happened to him either. Also very \\"light\\" is the role of that officer from her gracious majesty. I can understand the director is trying to show that the British were interested in seeing how the war would go and maybe helping the confederates, but I would have liked to see this treated in a more serious way instead of spending film showing an idiotic tourist in the middle of what remains a major event in American history. I was equally very disappointed by the actor playing Jeff Daniel's brother in this film. He was great in \\"soul man\\" (comedy of the mid eighties), but this was not a film for him. He gave me the impression from one end of the film to the other to try to find how to fit in. As for the battles, most of the shots cannot hide the lack of talent of the participating soldiers (reason : they are not actors but just ordinary citizen that re-enact the battle every year). The special effects are far below minimum (we miss Sam Peckinpah here) and quite repetitive, and most of the fake beards really look fake... adding to the lack of credibility of the overall final result.    Other major flaws are for instance the role of one of the Union's generals wife in this story. One of the Confederate generals gives Tom Berenger an item asking him to give it to that lady if he dies. We don't know why he does it, what relationship they had, and as a matter of fact we do not know until the very end of the film that it was a sample of the bible. So ? We also have the impression that Lee was an undecided leader (he first says he is going to reprimand a general of his for disobeying, then he congratulates him; he calls another to reprimand him and make him feel totally miserable but then refuses the resignation, and so on), wanting to emulate Napoleon, erroneously stubborn (none of the generals thought for a second they would succeed in their final assault), which is totally opposite to what I had read up to now in history books. Which is the good version ?    The best part of the film is the extra comments, which are also long, but very instructive. I enjoyed much more that part than the film itself. However, if you want a really good war related film, I would suggest you look for something else (Spartacus, The Battle of England, the Bridge on the river Kwai, Paths of glory,   the great escape, Saving Private Ryan, Sand Pebbles, Das Boot...). The list is really too long. That too puts \\"Gettysburg\\" at its place, down the ladder, regardless of the passion it may create becauseof the importance of the event for America and Americans.
0441009425|4.0|For a first book, REVELATION SPACE is pretty good, but I was a little disappointed when all was said and done. Possibly this was due, at least partly, to high expectations. This book has gotten a lot of very positive spin -- award nominations, strong recommendations, ect. Besides that, however, there are some problems. Reynolds keeps several plot lines going in this book and, combined with frequent shifts of time frame, it became rather disconcerting. Also, though the character development is good compared to most space operas, I didn't find any of the people in this book particularly sympathetic. Consequently, I wasn't sure I really cared what happened to them by the time I got to the end.<br /><br />Despite these issues, I found REVELATION SPACE quite readable. Reynolds uses language nicely, the action moved along at a good pace, and the universe Reynolds has created is an intriguing one. So, while it wasn't as good as I hoped it would be, this is still better than average sci fi and I expect to read the next book in this series.
0064407667|1.0|Harry Potter this is not.  There is nothing but a sad attempt to be original or dark in the plot.  Defining the mediocre vocabulary is condescending to the reader, especially since most children over 8 years old would be familiar with the words.  Even if they weren't, I think it would be a more effective learning tool if they were taught such critical reading skills as learning the meaning of the words from the context of the sentence.  I really think the author spent more time thinking up marketing ploys for his books than actually spending quality time in the writing of them.
B00005Y1UX|4.0|This movie, and the main plot of it, have become the subject of many jokes to many a comedian, as well as the average joe next door. It has also become the subject of heavy conversation and question amongst many as well; thus meaning, more or less, this movie was provocative enough to get a reaction out of many people. You know the story: desperate couple runs into a problem with finances, so they go to Las Vegas to try to make some quick cash. In the midst of this, they run into a billionaire, who has his sets on the wife, and offers the couple one million big ones for a night with the lady. It should be noted that the couple went into this thinking (or at least hoping) that the whole thing would mean nothing afterwards, and it would be a walk in the park--in other words, easy money. But, then, the devils of mistrust, jealousy, and insecurity start to rear their ugly heads into the picture, and sends their marriage into a mess. Through it all, did the relationship survive? Did the couple end up divorcing? You'll have to watch the movie. Woody Harrelson and Demi Moore did excellent jobs in their respective roles, and likewise for Robert Redford.
068987474X|1.0|I won't bother giving the premise of the book as everyone seems to know about it.<br /><br />All I will say is that I am really mad at myself for having falling for the hype.  I thought this would be a fun book to read.<br /><br />Instead, it seems to make a mockery of relationships and sends the message that all relationships should be the same.  I agree with the previous reviewer who said this book is dangerous.
B0006FFRW0|5.0|I got the Dual Disc because, while I love Nine Inch Nails, I really can't ever get into all the experimental remixing that comes with most NIN singles.  The Downward Spiral is really what I was looking for to be remastered.  I was really blown away by the upgraded quality of sound.  I listened to both the CD and the SACD (DVD) 5.1 formats and both sounded exceptional.  I could really hear so much more and from an album with so much compressed and dense sound this is a real plus compared to the original version.   <br /> <br />Beyond the listening experience I was especially delighted to get the added bonus of a full-length uncut video for 'Closer' (in both Stereo and 5.1 formats), one of my favorite videos of all time.  Having the album and videos together in one package is definitely worth the buy.
B0006284JQ|4.0|I am definitely one of those people who was surprised when after such a seemingly short time I heard that Britney Spears was releasing a Greatest Hits album.  Sure, she already had 5 years tucked under her belt, but with just 4 Billboard Hot 100 Top Ten Hits (Baby... One More Time, You Drive Me Crazy, Oops! I Did It Again, and Toxic), it seemed like it would take a lot of filler to put an album together.  Nevertheless, fans of Britney will appreciate having to put just ONE album in their CD player instead of 4 separate ones to get to the good songs.  As for the new material, My Prerogative and Do Somethin' just didn't cut it, though I've Just Begun Havng My Fun is a nice bonus.
B00001SIES|5.0|ok people, since this album sounds so much like radiohead i would like someone to give me a muse song, and then a radiohead song that sounds anything like it and post them below this review because i just dont see it, muse is a much much better band and have better melody than radiohead and more powerful music with a more beautiful voice, buy this album listen to it once, if you dont like the first listen which most will, then listen to it again the next day and i guarantee that it will grow on you.  buy this cd
B0002ZDVEU|3.0|Bourne really did lose it's \\"Identity\\", if you know what I mean.  <br /> <br />The only thing this movie had against Identity is that this one was more intense; more action. But that doesn't neccesarily make Supremacy worthy. The way they ended The Bourne Identity, it would have been much better if they had left it alone. They pretty much fudged the whole concept.  <br /> <br />After watching the first movie, you would be like \\"Ooh, THAT's how it happened\\", but in this one they shove it all right in front of you, complete with rigid, come-and-go camera shots. The first time I watched it, it didn't bother me, but by the second time I realized there was nothing really worth pondering afterwards. :(
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|I was first referred to Nightwish by my best friend, who'd been a metal fan for a while. At the time I was still listening to Rock, Punk, and Nu-Metal. Nightwish was the band that pulled me into the Progressive/Symphonic Metal genres, with their song Wishmaster off the Wishmaster album (go figure). Being an Evanescence fan at the time, I fell in love right away. I soon learned to appreciate the skills it took to make music this good, skills which arent displayed in other genres. Tarja's vocals are amazing. Tuomas's song writing and synth skills are excellent. Marco's vocals are pretty good, and I love hearing Emppu on guitar and Jukaa on the drums. <br /> <br />When I first heard Nemo, one of the tracks on this album, I loved it. I was slightly disappointed that the song didn't seem to carry Tarja's operetic (sp?) vocals as much as most of their other songs, but it was still great. I dearly hoped that the whole album wouldn't ditch the opera style, though. And I wasn't disappointed. In my opinion Ghost Love Score is the best song on the album, but that's not to lessen the rest of them. They're all great. <br /> <br />If you really wanna check out some of Nightwish's best songs, though, I'll highly recommend the Wishmaster album. No song gets me pumped up like Crownless. You've GOT to hear it. <br /> <br />One of my favorite things about this band, though, is that they sound just as good LIVE as they do on their albums, if not better. That's how you know a band's real. I saw them live on 8/22/04 in NYC, they were amazing (I caught Emppu's guitar pick w00t). They're gonna be showing again in NYC, on 4/25/05 at B.B. King's. And you can bet I'll be there.
B0002F6BRE|2.0|First off, I have to say that without Will Ferrell, the movie would be in the negatives in my book. What happened? Elf is just a bunch of corny quotes (\\"Buddy the Elf, what's your favorite color?\\"..) with a poorly excecuted crappy Disney classic-style ending, with a cheap moral and a lot of affection between characters. It's a childrens movie that wants to be a comedy, and it just isn't happening. Will Ferrell was the only one attempting to make it what it's not, and it's probably just up to you whether or not that's a good or a bad thing. If asked whether to watch Rice Krispies pop or Elf, I would choose the Rice Krispies. xD
159413023X|5.0|I thought this was a great book. I couldn't put it down. Normally I don't care for the subject material, but I found myself captured by the story. It was often sad, but I wanted to read on. I can't wait for more!

0385336810|5.0|This is the first book by Sopie Kinsella that I have read. Somehow the summary of her previous books did not appeal despite the rave reviews. What a mistake! I am so glad that I ordered this book. It is so easy to like and feel for Emma. Her cousin, Kerry is a real (...) and I loved the meeting between her and Jack, who is adorable. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and for me it is a keeper.
B00005NEUF|5.0|The Strokes have been the subject of much debate in the past few years since the release of Is This It, their first album. Although they were praised with almost unanimous critical acclaim they received a mixed reaction from the general public. Perhaps this happened because of the masses' conditioning to like terrible bands such as Creed but whatever the case, its their loss for missing out on this due to their brainwashed narrow mindedness. No, The Strokes aren't the second coming of Christ, but they are a great rock 'n' roll band that knows how to pay homage to their forefathers musically. The Strokes' sound is very similar to what is found on The Velvet Underground's classic \\"I'm Waiting For The Man\\" using a very simple, churning chord structure that is so rarely found in this day and age. It is this, along with Julian Casablanca's emotional sing/speak vocals, that makes The Strokes such a stand out band. To compliment their old is new again sound, they have a great collection of songs here with maybe one or two missing the mark ever so slightly. Is This It is a most enjoyable experience for educated music lovers everywhere and with the success of their second CD, it seems The Strokes will not be forgotten any time soon. [The original UK album has \\"New York City Cops\\" which was replaced by \\"When It Started\\" for the US release due to the events of 9/11.]
B00006JKOM|4.0|The 1970's was an extraordinary productive and fruitfull period for Jethro Tull ( 12 studio-albums!!).<br /><br />Some of these are derservedly regarded as rock-classics, such and \\"Stand Up\\", \\"Thick As a Brick\\", \\"The Minstrel in the Gallery\\" and  \\"Songs From the Wood\\". The rest of them are simply very good rock-albums. This album obviously belongs to the second category.<br /><br /> \\"Too Old to Rock'n Roll\\" is a concept album, telling the thought-provoking story about the old rocker, Ray Lomas, who had become too old to rock'n roll, but the again becomes hip, when the trends in music and fashion suddenly change.<br /><br />Like on all Tull albums there are some terrific songs and melodies here. The playing and production is as always impeccable. The title track is for me the stand-out strack, and songs like \\"Crazed Institution\\", \\"Pied Piper\\", \\"Chequered Flag\\" and the bonus track \\"Strip Cartoon\\" are other highligts.<br /><br />The album also contains a fine cartoon version of the story - good to make a quick over-view of the storyline.<br /><br />Recommended!!

B0006399FS|2.0|I'm very disappointed in this album.  The Edge is dull.  I'm a huge fan of the band, but outside of Vertigo it's an album of B-grade U2.   <br /> <br />It's not much of a rocker.  I'm sure FM radio will love it, but FM radio programming sucks.   <br /> <br />They aren't progressing with this album, just maintaining.  Best band in the world?...Not if you phone it in like this thing does. <br /> <br />I've tried and tried to \\"make\\" it grow on me, it's not working.
1572702125|5.0|An unusual crime takes place in a unique setting:  a train car where no one can get on or off, yet the murderer remains a mystery.  I listened to the audio version and the narrator was one of the best I have heard.  He takes on the character of Poirot with total enthusiasm and convinving emotion.  This is a classic that is anything but typical.
B0002IVN9W|4.0|The Arcade Fire are amazing live. The record is great too -- but if you have seen the Arcade Fire live you know that they are destined to be huge.

0671027387|4.0|When I checked the paperback copy of this book out from my local library, it was falling apart.  I took this as a good sign-it must be oft read.  I wasn't disappointed.  This was my fourth read from Dan Brown, and I found it to be my favorite.  This book is a fast-paced thriller and as such, doesn't leave one disappointed.  The story is intriguing-a meteorite is found beneath the polar ice, and fossils are contained therein.  All the scientists and NASA have come to the conclusion that this is the find of the century-there must be life elsewhere in the universe.  The book takes us on the journey of truth-is the meteorite a fake?  How is the President involved?<br /><br />There is quite a bit of science in this book, most of which I found accurate (as a scientist myself).  There are some areas where the truth is stretched, but nothing that would concern a layman.  For PhD in geology, yes there are some holes, but nothing that radically alters the story, in my opinion.  Even with these holes, the book makes for a good story (it is fictional, after all).  I enjoyed the political/NASA aspect of this story, and found it particularly apt in this election year.  All in all, this book was a great read.

Usually I find his vocal range a little on the nasally side....at least of some Death Cab songs....but somehow on Give UP I just can't get enough.
0780020685|5.0|Akira Kurosawa was a director of legendary ability.  His Japanese films are among the cream of the crop - \\"Ran\\", \\"Yojimbo\\", \\"Ikiru\\" and \\"Rashoman\\" are as important to film history as Hitchcock's Greatest Work.  The Seven Samurai is widely considered his greatest achievement.  Over and over, when lists of \\"Greatest Movies in History\\" are made The Seven Samurai appears at the top of all movies not made in English.  It is frequently ranked alongside \\"Citizen Kane\\", \\"Casablanca\\" and \\"The Godfather\\" as one of the greatest movies period.<br /><br />So - those are some of this movies' credentials.  Is there a reason you SHOULDN'T see \\"Seven Samurai\\"?  Well - it's over three hours long.  It's in Japanese, so you either have to watch a dubbed version or read subtitles if you don't understand Japanese.  The central conflict of the film is between heartless bandits and noble Samurai and there are action sequences, some violence and deaths.  Not scared off yet?  Good.<br /><br />I would easily exhaust the space limitation here trying to extol all of the virtues of this virtuoso film, so I'll try to give you some personal feelings.<br /><br />Set hundreds of years ago in feudal Japan, a group of bandits comes around periodically to raid a small peasant village of the small goods that their hard work has produced that year.  The village leaders meet with the local wise man and agree to recruit Samurai to protect the village.  Since they only have rice to repay these Samurai they know they're looking for some hungry Samurai.<br /><br />The opening act gives you these facts elegantly and concisely then leads to the recruitment sequence where we get to meet the Seven Samurai one at a time.  Although all are excellent warriors we learn their personalities - the wise one, the \\"good buddy\\", the master swordsman, the young one.  Determined to crash the group is Japanese legend Toshirô Mifune as Kikuchiyo.  The other Samurai see through his attempts to impersonate a Samurai, but bring him along to humor themselves.  By the end we see that Kikuchiyo has a noble warrior's heart, and the scene where he confesses his peasant background is one of the most moving I have ever seen.<br /><br />The third act deals with the Samurai back at the village - trying to set up defenses and train the peasants in basic fighting skills.  At the same time the villagers are distrusting of the Samurai.  They worry that they might plunder the village themselves - both their goods and their women.  A beautiful daughter is disguised as a young boy to shield her.<br /><br />Kurosawa is an absolute genius at showing us the human natures of the various characters.  The wise ones recognize their limitations and what they're up against.  The foolish ones aren't as insightful, but Kurosawa gives us a very knowing look at their humanity as well.<br /><br />Heroism, nobleness, self-sacrifice and courage are all prominent themes.  The characters find their way into your heart and in the climactic battle in the final scene many of them are larger than life.<br /><br />Highly recommended.the end we see that Kikuchiyo has a noble warrior's heart, and the scene where he confesses his peasant background is one of the most moving I have ever seen.

B000003N7K|5.0|There is neither one now nor will there ever be another voice like Johnny Hartman's.  Nor a sax player like John Coltrane.  This CD is a Jazz classic that belongs in your library of music.  It's smooth, gentle, romantic and a great example of true jazz ballads.  Not to mention the great musicians playing on this cd.  There is magic in their music and in Hartman's voice, that comes across in each track. If you're looking for true jazz musicians at their best, doing ballads, then buy this cd.  They all deserve appreciation for their gifts and talents to which you will feel when you listen to this cd.  Enjoy!
B0000AI44Q|3.0|I can't really claim that this work is uneven, because it is probably one of the most consistent albums ever released (which is not neccassarily a good thing in this case).  Unmelodic?  You betcha, but it's got hooks galore compared to a dull work like Springsteen's \\"Ghost of Tom Joad\\".  A concept album? Yep.  A rock opera?  Maybe.  A novel in musical form?  Most certainly, but that doesn't make it a good story.  In fact the plot in a convoluted, soap-opera mess that sounds as if it were written by a 10 year old (though from the liner notes that accompany the CD I guess that may be the point).  I do admire Young for trying to expand himself and I really like the \\"megaphone\\" vocals idea.  But the bottom line for a work like this is: how is the story?  In this case the story is silly and uninteresting.
B00005JMFQ|4.0|I generally turn my nose up at romantic comedy, especially romantic comedy set around Christmastime, which this movie is.      This movie is set in England, focusing on roughly ten people that are on the fringes of one another's lives through relation, aquaintance, or work. Each person gets their own little love story, and each love story has its own quirks. Not each one is about romantic love, but most are.     Most amusing was the aged rock star, Billy Mack (Bill Nighy), who pulls a comeback through a shoddy Christmas remake of one of his old songs. Nighy is hilarious, and he says all those things that we never say about those annoying Christmas songs we are fed each year on the radio ala Bruce Springsteen's \\"Santa Claus Is Coming To Town\\" or George Michael's \\"Last Christmas\\".     Then we have John (Martin Freeman), and Just Judy (Joanna Page), whose love story unfolds on the set of a soft core porn movie as they get to know each other while simulating sex for an entire camera crew.    Hugh Grant is the Prime Minister in love with one of his staff, Liam Neeson is widowed stepfather to a lovesick little boy, and Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman play a couple bored with one another while his secretary tempts him.     There are more subplots. I have barely scratched the surface.    Hugh Grant was great, and as funny as he's ever been in this movie. Thomas Sangster, who played the little boy, Sam, was a show stealer and his chemistry with Liam Neeson is perfect.  This kid could have had his own movie. Truly, the ensemble cast we have here all does a great job.    However, this movie seems to me a collection of subplots. Any one of these mini-stories could have been fleshed out to make a movie on its own, and you almost wish it had been because some of the little subplots were far more interesting than others.    What we get instead is an overload of love. Platonic love, romantic love, old love, new love, puppy love, Christmas love, forbidden love, love busting through the language barrier, and family love. So much love! Yay, but not yay, because while the movie is fun to watch, and the end comes together beautifully, it's still a movie with too much going on to have anything other than a main theme revolving around a lot of people. To me, this is lazy film making because the characters only have a chance for minimal development, as does each story.    This isn't to say that I wouldn't watch it again, but for me, it hasn't quite lived up to the hype either.
B00009V7P8|5.0|Wow.  Like many people, I had not really heard Damien Rice until I saw the movie Closer.  So, I checked out his CD from the library.   <br /> <br />I was not prepared for the overwhelming beauty of this album.  The beauty of everything has made me an instant fan.  The voice, the emotion, the music, everything!   <br /> <br />I am definitely going to buy the album for myself and eagerly await a new album.
B0002S94OS|2.0|Look i love everything hard from machinehead,chimaira to cannibal corpse and deicide, but this is tripe. The drumming and singing are fine, but the guitars are woeful. Not the playing but the actual sound, if i want to listen to poorly recorded guitars i will listen to crappy euro black metal like impaled nazrene and satrycon, people if you like guitars that sound like they are recorded in a toilet then buy this, if not, don't waste your clams on this.
068987474X|1.0|The hype surrounding this book is amazing.  This, apparently, has become the book of \\"the hour\\". <br /> <br />I picked it up from our local library because I bought into the hype and thought it would be something similar to Sex and the City.  <br /> <br />BIG MISTAKE. <br /> <br />This book is DANGEROUS because it promotes the idea of a one size fits all.  Therefore, every guy and every girl and every relationship should be identical.  What is that about? <br /> <br />This book tells you that you should NEVER consider any kind of circumstances at all.  If he doesn't do this, its because he is not into you AND NO EXCUSES.  That's crap.  If only life were THAT simple. <br /> <br />I hate people like these authors or like Dr. Phil.  They make everything so black and white.  I would love to spend some time in their lives to see just how black and white their lives really are. <br /> <br />I have been on both sides of the fence (when the guy was into me and when he wasn't) and let me tell ya, it just ain't that simple. <br /> <br />This book is simply dangerous.
B00006690G|5.0|There are not very many of us who can express ourselves honestly and not be accused of whining incoherently.  Eminem does his ranting and raving vehemently without holding back.  This pure expression is having fabulous consequences.  Billions and billions of revenue!  Any mother will sympathize with his mom, but she did make her own bed and the best thing she could do now would be to try to share what little success she has with a son whose success has pretty much equalled \\"the beatles\\".  It would be nice to find a redeeming quality in this whole radical chaos that is the new millenium...I would love to see Eminem draw some parallels with his mom now that he is a dad.  For a man whose daddy was allegedly \\"gay\\", I wish I could thank him for impregnating that sorry excuse for a mother with this amazing personality!  Eminem is definitely two spirited to say the least!
B000002C2E|5.0|This album is sonically, lyrically and musically brilliant. I much prefer it to Love & Theft , though I have read Dylan likes that L & T better. There is a darkness and haunted aspect to these songs that is riveting. My favorite modern Dylan album by far.
0061015725|5.0|I read this over the summer, and I loved it. I believe that I got the book from my dads closet on a Friday night and I stayed awake and read it until I was finished. Only got up for food. I had previously read Timeline, which was also great, but Prey was right up there with Crichtons top books.  <br /> <br />The explanations of all the scienc-y stuff was easier to follow that in Timeline, and I never really got bored by any of it. I just hope that if there is ever a movie based on this book that it'll turn out better than Timeline.
B00009P1O0|5.0|As Neil Young moved into the mid 70's he had experienced commercial and critical success that would rival any other in his field.  As a member of the Buffulo Springfield, CSN&Y and as a successful solo artist, one could say that he had it all.  One listen to this and it's even darker twin TONIGHT'S THE NIGHT will tell all you need to know about Young's take on the spoils of success.<br /><br />The sixties had turned from a hedonists world of music for the sake of music, casual highs and optimism into a nightmare of comeercial exploitation, OD's and bitter pessimism.  ON THE BEACH does an especially good job of documenting the bitterness Young must have felt at becoming a public comodity as well as the death of 60's utopianism.<br /><br />I held off reviewing this album for a while due to the fact it had become the forbidden fruit of the Neil Young catalog.  For some reason this was unavailable on CD until 2003.  Well, the novelty has worn off and it is still a great listen.  Neil's spirits may have been crashed, but he was hitting on all cylinders as an artist.<br /><br />WALK ON  kicks things off in fine fashion, followed by the beautiful SEE THE SKY ABOUT TO RAIN, then it's into the dark soul of an angry musician.  The last three songs (ON THE BEACH, MOTION PICTURES ad AMBULANCE BLUES), which comprised the second side of the LP, create a manifesto of 70's style malaise.<br /><br />ON THE BEACH, in my opinion is one of the best albums that Neil Young has ever released.  A true Neil Young fan would be well advised to add it to their collection without reservation, just don't expect HARVEST.
B0002UXBD6|5.0|First let me say I am 38 years old and was into Green Day back pre-Dookie.  I kind of lost touch with the band after Insomniac (and seeing them in concert with more 13 year olds then adults).  But I heard all the buzz over their \\"punk opera\\", and the two songs I heard on Sirius, \\"American Idiot\\" and \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\" were great, so I figured, what the heck and bought the album. <br /> <br />Well, this is the best complete whole album I have bought since, well, I can't remember.  I can't stop listening to it.  What really surprises me is, even though it sounds like Green Day, it doesn't sound like Green Day.  What I mean is that it's not all the same 3 cord punk songs they have been churning out since the beginning, there's enough variety so you don't get bored.  I really though that by 40 or so of the albums 57 minutes I'd be sick of the repitition, nope, it's great!  And the lyrics have definately more depth and weight to them then Dookie era stuff. <br /> <br />So by the album, It's really meant to be listened to straight through, but some of my favs: <br /> \\"American Idiot\\" <br /> \\"Jesus of Surburbia\\" suite - a 9 minute, 5 song piece kind of in the vein of the Who's \\"A Quick One\\" <br /> \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\" <br /> \\"St, Jimmy\\"  <br /> \\"Wake Me Up When September Ends\\" - Beautiful ballad <br /> \\"Homecoming\\" suite <br />oh heck, the whole album is awesome.
B0000C8AV2|4.0|Like a couple of other reviews that preceed me, I had been inspired to put this one on after reading the chapter detailing the creation of this album in Dylan's excellent CHRONICLES VOL. 1.  I had always considered this to be a good Dylan album, though not to be confused with BLOOD ON THE TRACKS or any of his early/mid-sixties masterpieces.<br /><br />As Dylan had noted, his eighties output had been largely uninspired, so OH MERCY came as a pleasant suprise upon it's release (i.e. it didn't suck).  Braced with a handfull of solid tracks, Dylan also benefited from the interaction with producer Daniel Lanios.  Lanois, who had made his name producing U2,would push to create the classic album that maybe Dylan did not think to have in him.<br /><br />The creative tension between these two did move Dylan back in the right direction.  Lanios' production and arrangement advices elevated middling tracks like EVERYTHING IS BROKEN and POLITICAL WORLD to great affect.  He also added what would become his patented production values to enhance solid tunes such as the Johnny Cash-like MAN IN THE LONG BLACK COAT, the soul searchin WHAT GOOD AM I? and the sublime MOST OF THE TIME to great affect.<br /><br />Dylan himself, long a butt of jokes concerning his singing style, nails these performances with effective and emotional vocal performances.  He will never be confused with Marvin Gaye, but Dylan, when inspired, is a master at wringing the emotions out of a great lyric.<br /><br />Overall, OH MERCY is a solid album and a turning point in the career of Bob Dylan.  To that point Dylan looked like he would become a sorry nostalgia act, flogging endless greatest hits comps and touring endlessly on his sixties catalog.  He rebounded well in the nineties with two solid sets of non-original material, as well as what can be considered his best since BLOOD ON THE TRACKS, 1997'S TIME OUT OF MIND and 2001'S GREAT LOVE AND THEFT.
B00005ATQ9|5.0|Contrary to other reviewers here, I believe Ryan O'Neal played just the kind of character that Thackeray intended -- someone who is smart but not too smart. Indeed, he has to rely on the position and cleverness of others to succeed. His saving grace is that even in his worst moments, he is insufficently introspective to stop loving himself, and the good feelings he can't repress are something others cannot fail to respond positively to, despite their better judgement. [Dare I say, not unlike our current President!?!] O'Neal effortlessly conveys this, and yet when his character is called upon to be ruthless and physically violent, he does so with satisfying abandon. The narration is perfectly done - i felt as though I were reading the novel myself. One last thing -- the photography is overwhelmingly beautiful. The cinematography constantly evokes the landscape paintings and prints of the time.
B0002KVUMK|3.0|This is an action-packed film that crosses a number of genres: horror, comedy, and adventure. It has a stellar cast and a fairly interesting story line. It also has some stupendous special effects but therein lies the rub. The director has not learned that less is often more. Some of the special effects are spectacular and some are buffoonish/cartoonish and end up being jarring, rather than enhancing, to the film.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman is excellent as Van Helsing, the mysterious monster killer who is subsidized by the Catholic Church, as the Vatican operates  a secret laboratory run by clergymen who perfect sophisticated weaponry for Van Helsing's fight against evil. In 1887, Van Helsing is sent by the Vatican to assist the noble Valerious family of Transylvania in getting rid of the pesky Count Vladislaus Dracula, drolly played by Richard Roxburgh. By the time Van Helsing arrives, accompanied by his trusty sidekick, a friar named Carl (David Wenham), the only member of this vampire fighting family who is left alive is the athletic and lovely Anna Valerious, played with single-minded dedication by the  wasp-waisted, newly Barbie breasted Kate Beckinsale.<br /><br />There, they all end up battling the brides of Dracula, a werewolf, and Count Dracula himself, with a little assist from Frankenstein. Let the games begin! The flying brides of Dracula are my favorite special effects, but even there the production cannot refrain from being unsubtle, which is too bad. There are some scenes that are spectacular, such as the battle between the werewolf and Anna and her brother, Velkan (Will Kemp), which takes place before the arrival of Van Helsing. Those special effects are terrific, as are those involving the brides of Dracula upon Van Helsing's arrival in Transylvania and the subsequent battle between them.<br /><br />The film also manages to blend a certain amount of humor and camp, making it quite funny, at times, and somewhat tongue-in-cheek. As for the romance between Van Helsing and Anna, I am sorry to report that there is little, if any, chemistry between Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale. Moreover, the film is consistently uneven. While the opening black and white scene in which the towns people, carrying torches,  converge upon Count Dracula's castle is very atmospheric, its effect is vitiated by the ludicrous scene immediately following in which Van Helsing  battles Mr. Hyde (of Dr. Jeckyll and Mr. Hyde fame). Unfortunately, Mr. Hyde resembles nothing more than a video game monster similar to the Hulk, minus the green hue.<br /><br />Despite some of the issues with the film, it is definitely an entertaining, action-packed film that is worth a rental.n Van Helsing and Anna, I am sorry to report that there is little, if any, chemistry between Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale.

0385720920|2.0|I think the concept of 'Choke' is really interesting and definitely had potential to be a great book.  You'll find remnants from previous books, leftovers he thought were sharp and witty, among plots that are very far-stretched.   <br /> <br />I read another review in which the reviewer found the characters very empty, impossible to relate with.  I agree with this, but to an extent I think this was almost Palahniuk's intent.  He's an amazing writer but his ideas are carbon-copies of previous books.  Throw in a slightly different setting, change professions and names, and add actions that are \\"out there\\" or disturbing, and you've got yourself the same book you read last year with just some different names.   <br /> <br />I don't consider the book a waste of my time.  (In fact, only one short story has earned the right to be considered such in my book.)  As far as I'm concerned, Chuck is a one-hit wonder who was glorified through an excellent movie.  Because of that, every book he writes will eventually bear \\"National Bestseller\\" on its cover.  His abilities as a writer have yet to be proven through any of his writings I've read.  You want writing that has the attitude and grit of Palahniuk, but is far more original novel-after-novel, pick up Alex Garland.  It's definitely much more worth it.
B00003CX5P|3.0|I don't believe it's possible to make a bad \\"Star Wars\\" movie but this one comes close.  Everything that made Episodes IV through VI such classics - the beat-up \\"hot rod\\" spaceships, the cameraderie between the main characters, the epic struggle between an oppressive galactive empire and a small band of freedom fighters - all of that is just ... gone.  Gone.  There's just none of that in \\"The Phantom Menace\\".  The movie has no magic at all.  No great characters.  No memorable lines.  No compelling plot.  Just nothing.  Zip.  Nada.  Considering its pedigree, the movie is a total letdown.  \\"The Phantom Menace\\" becomes a rather ironic piece of self-commentary when Liam Neeson as a Jedi Knight observes that the trade dispute that is the movie's mcguffin is \\"trivial\\".  Imagine a film that stops to observe that its central plot point is a triviality.  George Lucas once said that a special effect without a story is pretty boring.  Well, that's what's wrong with \\"The Phantom Menace\\";  it's not a special effect without a story, but it comes dangerously close to being just that.  A movie about a nine-year-old kid?  George, what were you thinking?  Jake Lloyd as the young Anakin Skywalker is a talented child, but he can't hold the weight of this movie on his small shoulders.  All in all \\"The Phantom Menace\\" is kind of like a science-fiction version of \\"Much Ado about Nothing\\":  people race around the galaxy, there's a lot of screaming and shooting and none of it really amounts to anything.  What this prequel needs is a prequel.
B000002LRX|5.0|If you haven't listened to this album yet, then where the hell have you been!? Every member of the band bring out their brilliant best, especially Mike Bordin, Roddy Bottum, and the legendary Mike Patton! If you wanted the perfect funk metal album with every ingredient blended in with a stroke of genius, then look no further than Faith No More's 'Angel Dust'. <br /> <br />Not to say other FNM records are bad or anything they're a million miles from it, but this, like my title says, is EASILY their best album! <br />Bordin's drumming is cool, funky, and at times intense! The keyboards are also one of the better elements on the album too!  <br />But it's Mike Patton's vocals and singing ability that shines out the most on this album. <br /> <br />Just listen to his incredible high notes on 'Caffine', 'Malpractice', 'Midlife Crisis', & 'A Small Victory'. For his more deeper, screechier moments give 'Jizzlobber' a go! For his most melodic try 'Land of Sunshine', 'Everything's Ruined', 'Kindergarten' & the Lionel Richie cover 'Easy'. Oh hell they're ALL classics, need I say more? <br /> <br />Buy now! You NEED 'Angel Dust'!

B0000DZ3IG|5.0|I love this cd. It is a nice mixture of the old and new with classic from the Beach Boys and Joni Mitchell. It has some 80's music with Jump by the Pointer Sisters, modern with Dido and Kelly Clarkston. If you want to have the X-Mas songs you need to buy the import soundtrack. I think it has everything on it.
B0002Z0EYK|1.0|I can understand film makers cared nothing about Homer's Illiad and changed everything, even the unbearable gay relationship between Aquiles and Patroclus, which was ok 4,000 years ago but they had to hide it now a days, who knows why. <br />What I cannot understand, even trying hard to, is the appearence of those llamas walking along over the soil of ancient Thesalia.  <br />Wasnt America be found on 1492 and so llamas and other american animals?  <br />Make a joke of Homer, who maybe created all these Troy stuff, but guys, not of history and geography!! <br />If Homer Illiad is too hard for you to read, at least watch some on the discovery channel, please.
B000002IQW|5.0|This album is, by far, one of the best of its genre.  If memory serves, it was the first metal album to debut at #1 on the charts.  <br />The band's instrumentals are undoubtedly at their best, but what makes this album spectacular is Bach's lyrics and his amazing delivery.  It's like a pleasant rollercoaster ride of vocal notes that you didn't even know existed.  Bach is easilly one of the best rock vocalists of the past twenty years, though he often goes unnoticed.  Tracks like \\"Wasted Time\\", \\"Quicksand Jesus\\", and \\"In a Darkened Room\\" showcase his talents the best.   <br />The album itself is also a good mix of tracks, ranging from harder tracks, \\"Slave to the Grind\\" to some slower tracks like \\"Quicksand Jesus\\".  Buy this album, put it in your cd player, and prepare to be blown away.
6305127697|5.0|<br /> Primal Fear is an excellent movie, that will have you on the edge of your seat wondering what is going to occur next. Featuring Richard Gere and Edward Norton, These actors  do a tremendous job which makes them unstoppable in the persuasion  of their roles. Many law shows and movies are decent, but they lack crucial evidence to make their movie or show realistic, and things always seem to fall into place; however, in this movie you see how gullible people are and how one client can deceive the whole justice system. It is the best courtroom drama since O.J.`s case, with enough evidence and detail to support the entire movie it is by far a five star flick. The film was a hit in all aspects due to the actor's phenomenal job, the sense of truth it had to it, and the legendary storyline that is fantastic. <br /> The acting throughout this movie was brilliant, with a surprise ending and great scenes, it was all accomplished by the magnificent performance of the actors. Edward Norton and Richard Gere deliver an excellence performance in this courtroom drama about kindness and deception. Edward Norton plays an inconspicuous character, named Aaron Stampler , that will have you questioning the outcome for the entirety of the movie. The first half of the movie introduces Edward Norton as a shy, harmless young man accused of a murdering an arch bishop. Following his incarceration, in jail, Richard Gere (Martin Vale)  steps up, in an amazing performance, as Edward's high price lawyer, who takes Edward's case to gain publicity. Furthermore, as the case unfolds Richard  finds himself in a predicament, due to lack of evidence, that makes him question Edward's innocence and leads him to believe the case is unbeatable.  As the story thickens Edward reveals his other side, who is a ruthless, deceitful young man desired to obstruct the justice system. Unable to plead insanity, Richard Gere faces many challenges to prove Edward's innocence,  which appears impossible. Edward Norton's debut in this movie is short of breath taking, as he remains dedicated and ambitious throughout the movie. Richard Gere is also To thank for the greatness of this movie as he plays a prominent part that shows off his wonderful acting skills. Richard Gere and Edward Norton combined were just unstoppable in this movie, and proved that together they can produce an astonishing, out of this world courtroom drama.  <br /> As the plot unfolds and the ending occurs you see the truth behind the movie, and that's what makes it creative.  This movie has truth to it, because any criminal in life could pursue this movie and possibly have a  chance at getting away; in fact , due to the sequence of events and the creativeness to the plot you would think this movie was based on a true story. Primal fear is a movie that has logical views with great strengths that make the movie entertaining and convincing. Once you conclude its relevance in the courtroom you see a way the justice system could be fooled by a single citizen. That is what makes this move and separates it from the fictional movies that could never happen. Primal Fear is a movie that makes you think  about court cases and how deceptive people can be. <br /> The movie was well thought out, with the sequence of events being  intense, your mind becomes drawn in as you becomes curious what the next scene will convey. The story-line is  brilliant, each seen escalates in suspense from the beginning to especially the end.  Although, the very beginning might seem a little slow don't let it fool you, as they are just setting the twists and turns for the rest of the movie. Be prepared though, as you watch Edward`s character evolve, you become so fascinated with the climax, that you become anxious  to see the conclusion. The most notable part of this movie is definitely the end;  it delivers how creative the movie makers are, with the ultimate display of courtroom drama, as Richard Gere and Laura Linney argue over Edward Norton`s innocence, it is untouchable by any other , as Edward's fate in the movie is revealed. <br /> In conclusion,  I believe this is one of the best movies ever made, and that viewing it would be well worth your time. With good acting, a terrific story line, and  truth behind it, it is by far one of the best movies of all.  Well thought out and executed perfect in every seen, this is the kind of  movie you will always remember and tell a friend about.   This movie will be a good investment in your time and will leave you in ah as the plot unfolds and the truth comes out. <br /> <br /> <br />
B0000019PA|5.0|The year is almost 2005, and Neutral Milk Hotel's In the Aeroplane Over the Sea is still one of favorite albums of all time.  It has been probably said time and time again, but you will know you're in for something special right from the opening riff on \\"The King of Carrot Flowers Pt. 1\\".  The rest of the song is amazing, as its counterpart , \\"Pt. 2 & 3\\" are as well.   <br /> <br />I cannot emphasize the brilliance of Jeff Mangum's songwriting ability and lyricism enough.  After hearing the lyrics to these songs you will spend a good amount of time contemplating them.  \\"Holland 1945\\" and \\"Communist Daughter\\" are two other standout songs.  Holland is a very upbeat catchy tune.   <br /> <br />If you do not have this album, you need to buy it.  Genre is not important here; In the Aeroplane Over the Sea is a collection of brilliant music.
B000002HRE|4.0|now........metallica r my favourite band and i love their older stuff but i still love all of their newer albums ( after black album ). This album, along wit reload is alot different as u know but, for a diehard metallica fan, is still a must have.  <br /> <br />Fuel- real good song, immediate fan favourite <br />The Memory Remains- Really cool intro, good idea 4 the marianne faithful bit. <br />Devils Dance- Wicked base line on this song <br />The Unforgiven- not abad folow up of the original <br />Better Than You- pretty good but not the 1 of the best on the album <br />Slither- Kool as hell <br />Carpe Diem Baby- another winner in my eyes. ( did u know that hetfield has this tattoed on his arm) <br />Bad Seed- yet another wicked song  <br />Where the wild things are- still a good song but not as good as the 1s around it <br />Prince Charming- \\" hey ma, Hey ma look its me\\" <br />Low mans lyric- 1 of my favourites on the album, slower song  <br />Attitude- doesnt come cooler  <br />Fixxxer- not 1 of the best on the album but is a good way 2 finish an album. <br /> <br />big up 2 the ystrad crew
0156027321|5.0|Just having finished \\"Life of Pi\\" I am amazed once again at the power of story.   Every religion has its myths/stories to bring the essence into the hearts and minds of those wishing to believe.  From Pi we learn structure and format of zookeeping which closely parallels the  structure and dogma of organized religion.  Whether we choose to believe one version of his story or the other really makes little difference.  A large cat enclosure can be a lifeboat.  A place of worship can be in your heart.
0739420712|5.0|Laugh yourself through a small novel unlike nothing Grisham has<br /><br />ever written before.  This book is similar to \\"Lampoon's Christmas\\" with a different twist.  A couple bids their only daughter goodbye for a one year stint in the Peace Corps. They decide to avoid all the hastles of celebrating Christmas this year by taking a cruise.  If I told you anymore, I'd give it away!!  The book is fast paced, funny, ends with a tear, and would be a great gift for anyone, especially those suffering from \\"empty nest syndrome\\" for the first time.
0393312836|5.0|This is a striking peak into the future faintly paralleling the worlds that Orwell and Huxley foretold.  The narrator and main character, Alex, leads his droogs (friends) to vandalism and anarchical acts.  Burgess uses a slang language derivative of Russian that creates a strange futuristic tone.  At first, the language made it hard to understand and read, but as one begins to indulge themselves in the story, the language is nearly non-existent.  Burgess puts this group of kids against all the best wishes of society and they survive society's grasp.  Burgess also uses parallelism of his future with our reality to show what might happen.  Strangely enough, and quite ironic, Alex, the leader of a vicious group of street hooligans, finds favoritism in classical music such as Beethoven, Handel, and Bach.  This contrast was obviously intentional to show the influence of the past in the near future.  It is a great story that I quickly started reading and enjoyed every slash of Alex's britva and every beating of innocent bystanders.  To enhance every brutal scene, Burgess uses a mix of dialog and narration.  Burgess' use of strong language, a pioneer of his time, helps create an atmosphere of anarchical lunacy.  I would highly recommend this book to anybody that can take a good old graphic novel filled with suspense and fun.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|Before buying this DVD, I rented it from my library to see if it was worth purchasing... and believe me, it's worth every penny. The DVD is a moving, wonderful experience that any fan of George's work should see. Eric Clapton plays most of the songs, Paul McCartney does 4 of them including the moving \\"All Things Must Pass\\" and \\"Something\\" which was recently nominated for a Grammy Award. George's son, Dhanni, also performs a piece and plays his guitar through most of this. I really liked Joe Brown's last performance of \\"I'll See You In My Dreams\\" since it was wonderful, moving and really summed things up. Olivia Harrison came in to the end to stand by her son's side as the crowd was cheering her on, and beautiful flower pellets were falling onto the crowd. It is the best concert, and concert dvd I have ever seen and I would recommend it to anyone.
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|This box set is just amazing, completely amazing! Michael Jackson's career since the beggining to nowadays, full with magic and big hits! Plus the concert live in Bucharest, a 2 hours live concert full of energy! <br />This box is a must-have for everyone that want to know Michael and love Michael! After soooo many years, he's still the king of pop and makes music like no-one does!
B00005JMFQ|2.0|I cannot believe the same guy wrote \\"Four Weddings . .\\"  Enough uncomfortable and unlikely relationships here to write a book, but none so egregious as the plot thread about the shy porn actors.  Yes, every now and then we get sixty to ninety seconds of two sweet and unassuming porn actors grinding or bumping or orally gratifying while establishing a \\"cute\\" relationship which includes a sexless, nearly Victorian, romance.  Yeah, sure.<br /><br />Liam Neeson's character buries his wife at the start of the movie in a funeral scene unabashedly swiped from \\"The Big chill\\".  Somebody should tell screenwriter Curtis that unexpected rock music works at the end of a funeral when it's unexpected and by the Stones, not planned and from the Bay City Rollers.  The gone-too-soon Mom's ten-or-under boy mourns not his late mother, but his unrequited love for the class hotty.  And the cute kid (who curses cutely too) is thrilled when his Dad seems interested in a new chick before Mom's body has fully cooled - a nice touch.<br /><br />Hugh Grant as Prime Minister?  Hah!  I'll buy that when you convince me that Billy Bob Thornton could play a President.  Well, actually, we are asked to believe the perennially 28-year-old Grant is PM; and Billy Bob is typecast as the pushy (Bush?) pig (Clinton?) of an American President.  The whole idea, right down to the PM falling for a Monica Lewinsky look-alike, just doesn't work.  Will someone kindly inform the Brits that Clinton didn't really love Lewinsky.<br /><br />Speaking of informing the Brits:  Please tell English comedy writers that Americans do not 'get' Rowan Atkinson, hence a scene does not automatically become funny when he turns around and faces the camera.<br /><br />While I'm at it:  Alan Rickman's character shows a ton of intelligence and sensitivity in trying to help Laura Linney's character land the man she loves.  That's nice.  But guys that thoughtful and sensitive do not leave brilliant, beautiful, and loving wives like EmmaThompson for air-headed Catherine Zeta-Jones wannabes.  For Zeta-Jones they leave, not the wannabes.  Make a note, if Catherine will not take the part you write it out.  And while you're rewriting you can let Laura Linney keep her top on, she's too good an actress.  Talk about gratuitous.<br /><br />Curtis tries to tie all eight romances together at the end with one of those airport greeting scenes originally done by Saturday Night Live in 1977.  It doesn't work, most of these plot threads relate just too loosely - and the porn actors are kinda free-floating.  Why are they in the movie anyway?<br /><br />A second star, however, because the acting is excellent - most of the stars rise above the story lines.  And Thompson's character is indeed well-written as well as well-acted.  Rickman is great, as is Linney, and Bill Nighy is fun as a burned out rock star. Finally, the 1/10 or so of the movie devoted to Colin Firth and Lucia Moniz (his housekeeper) is warm and funny, and could have used much more time.<br /><br />Unfortunately, if you've seen the trailer you've seen about every fun scene in the flick.  Avoid this one.
B000294SFW|4.0|This is a hard rocking metal album filled with great guitar leads, powerful rhythm playing and of course, the man, Lemmy.  There's nothing groundbreaking here, just some of the most solid and powerful music Motorhead have done since Orgasmatron (although the last 2 albums are good as well)  Its heavy, will get you headbanging, and is hellaciously dark.  Lemmy hasn't sounded this good in years, he hasn't gone soft thats for sure.  Much of this album is an exploration of fairly dark themes, but they close the album with a tongue in cheek acoustic blues called \\"Whorehouse Blues\\" that sends you on your way with a smile on your face.  Kind of a pallette cleanser, that one.  Inferno is meat and potatoes Motorhead and that ain't a bad thing at all.  It also may be the best thing they've done since Ace of Spades.  If you don't bang your head while listening to this one yer probably dead.
B0000067L2|5.0|Im writing reviews in search of broadening my musical horizons so to speak. its time to ditch the blink and killswitch and move on to the wide world of music. I grew up in Washington so i do love the alternative music. I hope i don't end up in the same category either. <br /> <br />All the kids in high school wear shirts that showcase the doors, zeppelin, pink floyd, sometimes even the beatles. It is a sad fact that Cream is never showcased. So many people have never even heard of this great band. \\"Disraeli Gears\\" which is the most recognized Cream CD, is a colorful mix of blues guitar, hard riffs, skillfull drmming, and earnest vocals. Something that would be known as alternative by todays standards. But this album is 30 years old, making it that much more amazing. Each member moves very freely in my opinion. Clapton can solo and colour the vocals whenever he wants to, Baker adds fills and variations to his style of playing. the main thing i like about the recording is how stripped down it is. Each instrument stands out just enough to be recognized, and as well as it should because there is marvelous craftsmenship. the band is based in blues playing but there is heavy influence of rock. Psychedelic, yes. but it is not limited to psychedelia. \\"Swlabr\\", is heavily paced rock song, clapton surely is god and great influence to any stadium rocker of the '80s. Even when the band isnt stunning you with guitar moves they are efective, \\"We're going down\\" showcases the haunting vocals as the drums beat away while \\"Take it back\\" showcases the more blues sound they are known for. songs like \\"strange Brew\\" are the majority of the album though. Colouring solos and riffs with haunting lyrics are prominent. I would recommend this CD to anyone who can feel a groove but still wants to rock.
B0006284JQ|5.0|While I think Britney is too young & full of untapped potential to release a greatest hits album, I also believe this product is a fine offer from an incredibly talented pop star. For all those people who loved the singles, but didn't want to shell out the money for each of her individual albums, this is the album for you (not that that's not the purpose of pretty much every Greatest Hits album, but still). Almost all of her best songs are here from \\"...Baby, One More Time\\" to \\"Oops!..I Did It Again\\" to \\"I'm A Slave 4 U\\" to \\"Toxic. This CD expands the range of Britney's short, but fun career, so you can enjoy the guilty pleasures of her early teen career to her current more adult sound. And you can expect to enjoy every last minute of it. I would actually recommend buying her full-length albums (while Brit is not technically the most gifted singer in the world, her albums are all surprisingly entertaining), but for those who haven't or won't, this is a superb collection. A couple of key tracks didn't make the cut (most notably \\"From the Bottom of My Broken Heart\\") but that's really to be expected. There are also three never-before released tracks on this CD (Britney's cover of \\"My Perogative\\", \\"I've Just Begun (Having My Fun)\\", and \\"Do Somethin'\\"), all of which are fairly good in their own right, though there is better material on her other CDs, so these tracks wouldn't have made the cut had they not been new. Still, for some diehard fans, these additions might justify the purchase of the album, and they are certainly not awful for those who haven't bought the other albums either.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|Absolutely  riveting concert !!! <br />Well worth the price for the DVD... the sound is great. <br />About the only surprise for me ( it is no surprise that this tribute attracted people of the calibre that appeared), the only surprise was Tom Hanks in the Monty Python  \\"Lumberjack Song\\". I had to check the sleeve to see for sure... yup, Tom Hanks. <br />Anyways, just an awesome concert. Some standout material, such as the Travelling Wilburys  tune, and Ringo gave a great rendition of Photograph, and the rest was just superb. <br /> <br />A must have for the music fan.
B00007AJF9|5.0|Cate Blanchett is by far a superior actor and a personal favorite.  Many great actresses have played Queen Elizabeth I (Bette Davis, Glenda Jackson) but only Cate Blanchett has made the role truly hers.  She \\"is\\" Elizabeth and her formidable portrayal shows us a passionate, intelligent, calculating and all-over real woman with virtues and flaws.  Ms. Blanchett's performance deserved the Academy Award for Best Actress, but I am certain that this talented actress will continue to amaze us with her extraordinary talent.
B0002XDODU|4.0|Not there greatest album, but still worth going out and getting it,  MEIN TEIL is by far the greatest song on this album, along with amerika, despite the controversy over the amerika song its still a awesome song and i love it, people who complain about this song have no sence of humor.  Dalai Lama, Keine, Lust Moskau,Morgenstern, Reise Reise, are all great songs, i cant say i care to much for the others, but still cool to listen to once and a while.  This album isnt as upbeat as fast as there other albums, i was looking forward to head banging to this album, but it just wasnt fast enough, but all in all its a good album to have.  KEEP ROCKING RAMMSTEIN CANT WAIT FOR YOUR NEXT ALBUM
B00005JMJG|5.0|Even though I delayed to see it in the theatres (I rented it when the DVD was released), I say it's better late than never. All I can say is that I love how original it is in telling a love story. The characters are well done with both Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet making a good impression with them. And some scenes were touching with Jim Carrey's character reliving some beautiful moments that he had forgotten how much they meant to him. While it's not as inventive as \\"Being John Malkovich\\", or as clever as \\"Adaptation\\", I think this is still Charlie Kaufman's best screenplay because it has a light charm that wasn't in the others, and plus his characters are more rich in seeming like real people in a crazy situation. There's a lot of good elements to this movie that shouldn't be overlooked. I'm hoping it gets nominated for majors from the Academy Awards(Best Picture, Best Original Screenplay, Best Actor, Best Actress, and maybe Editing) because it's a beautiful movie that's hard to get out of your head at the end.

B00005JMX6|3.0|On the Dodgeball DVD, the preview for The Girl Next Door specifically calls it a \\"comedy\\". So I rented it thinking it was funny with lots of nudity since that's how it was advertised to me on the Dodgeball DVD.<br /><br />What I got was a very heavy movie that was not a comedy and very little nudity, although there was a lot of \\"suggestive\\" content.<br /><br />Another gripe of mine is this absurd \\"unrated version\\". Unrated compared to what? There are maybe 2 seconds of nudity in the whole film, and the scene at the adult film awards was way too tame. When one of the major draws to your film is that the girl is a former porn star, then you should play that up. That's why people will rent it. Don't give them the shaft by then hardly using that angle in your movie, especially the \\"unrated\\" version.<br /><br />In summary: this is a drama that happened to feature high-schoolers. If you're looking for a light-hearted \\"teen\\" movie this is not for you. If you're into very heavy & depressing dramas where the characters are very developed and face unbelievable, life-altering challenges then you'll like this.
B00064AM6C|5.0|You've maybe heard of this band but are wondering if they're the real deal? They are phenomenonally real, and this live concert shows why. That boy Jack White has studied the blues masters and seems to have made the same deal with the devil that Robert Johnson did. His playing is positively possessed: an over-amped guitar sound that reminded me both of Hendrix and Blue Cheer's Leigh Stephens, a voice between young Robert Plant and Janis Joplin. The drummer is perfect: solid, beautiful, and very cool. No stage gimmickry or back-up dancers, just an electrifying couple setting the night on fire. For once you can believe the hype.

B0000073BG|5.0|This 1975 release shows Renaissance at a peak and the excellent music on this album certainly reflects this - it is a personal favorite in fact.  I really appreciate the craft that the band put into their music; not to mention the emotional sophistication and superb musicianship.  This album is an especially fine example of these qualities.<br /><br />The music of Renaissance is very disciplined (I really appreciate this) for a rock band and the instrumentation and playing style is more in keeping with a symphony orchestra than a rock band.  Keyboardist John Tout uses the acoustic piano exclusively with some minor pipe organ and harpsichord work, along with a string synthesizer - it is used effectively throughout the album and marks a point where John started using synthesizers more.  Electric guitars are absent and Michael Dunford employs both strummed and picked parts on the acoustic guitar, which further emphasizes the classical approach.  In fact, it is only John Camps virtuosic bass playing on a trebly Rickenbacker bass and to a much lesser extent, Terence Sullivan's drumming that lend the rock aspect to the compositions.  To emphasize the classical \\"thing\\" even further, an orchestra is featured on this album, and this may very well be their most classically influenced record.  Saving the best for last though, Annie Haslam has one of the most stunning altos I have heard - the delicate textures of her voice are both positive and uplifting.<br /><br />The pieces on Scheherazade include a single short track (The Vultures Fly High 3'04\\"), two pieces in the mid-length range (7'05\\" Ocean Gypsy and Trip to the Fair 10'51), and finally the massive multi-movement Scheherazade suite (24'37\\").  The suite is a very sophisticated piece of music and is extremely well-arranged; with dense ensemble work and breathtaking dynamics.  The Scheherazade suite is incredible and my favorite composition by the band - I think it neatly sums up everything that I love about their music.  In addition to the suite, there are some absolutely beautiful and haunting moments on this album including the track Ocean Gypsy, although all of the other pieces are very strong.<br /><br />This remastered effort by Repertoire is not too bad at all and features great sound quality along with a brief band bio and a few photos.<br /><br />In summation, this is a wonderful recording made during the period of peak creativity for this band (1973-1977) and is very highly recommended to prog fans that also appreciate classical music. If you like this recording, also check out Ashes are Burning (1973); Turn of the Cards (1974); and Novella (1977).In addition to the suite, there are some absolutely beautiful and haunting moments on this album including the track Ocean Gypsy, although all of the other pieces are very strong.<br /><br />This remastered effort by Repertoire is not too bad at all and features great sound quality along with a brief band bio and a few photos.<br /><br />In summation, this is a wonderful recording made during the period of peak creativity for this band (1973-1977) and is very highly recommended to prog fans that also appreciate classical music.

I really see a difference after a few days of using the tape. I have recently stopped working out and am trying to get into shape again, I have pulled out this tape to do it with. I remember being able to get through the workout with 5 lb armn weights, I am back now at 2 lbs!! I know that this tape will get me back into shape in no time.

B00030590I|5.0|When I was little kid I saw Kagemusa - I did not understand all the details of cinematography but it had a profound effect on me. It was lyrical and the colors still show up in my dream. I almost had the same effect when I saw \\"Hero\\" - this is splendid, fascinating - could not have been better.<br /><br />Please do not use the English dubbed version - please listen to the Chinese version with English subtitles.<br /><br />Starting with the plot which deals with 3 versions of the same incident is quite unique - now listen to the voices as they narrate the version - the tones change , the confidence level change in the tone of the voices (this is why you have to listen to the chinese version and not the dub).<br /><br />The story is about a rebel and the emperor - it is the tactics used by the rebel to reach to the emperor and convey the message of his heart (lets not reveal all the twist).<br /><br />Part 2  - look at the sets and the canvas. The sets are amazing - every costume has been designed with care to match the canvas - the dark forces are in black and the rebel forces in orange. (When Tolkein writes the same in Hobbit we praise him - don't we).<br /><br />Part 3 - look at the movements - the same as we have seen in Battleship Potemkim - the dark forces are static while the rebel forces are dynamic - the dynamic forces cut through the static lines - this is an age old riddle that many artists have worked with<br /><br />Part 4 look at the martial arts - they are movements to convey the emotions and as you wiull notice in different versions of the same situation the fight is different and the costumes are different - they match the mood of the incident<br /><br />Part 5 - it actually talks about peace - \\"our country\\" the main theme of the movie is a message of cohesiveness which is so much needed in today's world. It talks about a united country with better communication among it's people<br /><br />The color combination used in every canvas or frame is just mesmerizing. Most of these are computer effects but I have never seen in movie industry the computer being used to create this level of art, this movie brings HK movies to a new age , new generation like Citizen Kane did for English movies.

0156027321|3.0|The book has some technical problems. For instance, the author gets a LOT of things wrong about India and Indians. A couple of glaring examples: a Tamil guy would NOT be named \\"Patel\\". And this is not a very esoteric observation --it's a gaping research flaw. Also, a Muslim man is HIGHLY unlikely to be named Satish Kumar (and if he is, it warrants some comment). Again, nothing obscure about this; the most basic attention to detail would have cured it. I could go on, but you get the idea. However, I don't think these flaws are fatal to the book. This is fiction, after all, and fiction of a somewhat fantasy-like genre, at that. I think it more than allows you to suspend your disbelief. (We do it routinely for more pedigreed authors --Franz Kafka's \\"Amerika\\" did not even remotely resemble America, but most people nonetheless agree it's a wonderful read ).     Another point of criticism is that the story may have been --um, \\"sampled\\".  If that's true, then it's a real shame. But since I don't really know the facts of that, I'll just say that based on just having read the book, I would recommend it.     It's a lovely story about faith, survival, exultation, hope,  loneliness, attachment, despair and awe. Really strange things happen, and yet it comes across as oddly believable. As far as the preoccupation with religion, I doubt it will affect your belief system. It's not at all sophisticated and I don't even think it's meant to be. The Life of Pi essentially makes a case for the richness and desirability of faith itself rather than for the existence of something in which to have faith. (It isn't a new thought, to be sure. But, again, it's a novel, not an exegesis.) It gives life to Pi's peculiar sense of wonderment and reverence. Certainly there are devices other than religion that may have been used to convey this. But I think religion is a perfectly fair choice and, as a bonus, provides the context for a quaint kind of humor. That's another thing. The book is quite funny.     The title is so very apt. It truly is about the \\"life\\" of Pi. It is NOT the \\"biography\\" of Pi. It is literally about his life and how that life survives, adapts, searches for meaning, is threatened, is given up on, equated with and distinguished from other units of life, and of course, how it lives.     A final thought: I am a little puzzled (but amused) by the critic who waited hundreds of pages for the rescue. A book isn't something you read only to find out how it ends!  And THIS book isn't about when and how Pi gets rescued. To enjoy a book, you have to like to give in to the experiece of reading --just a little-- otherwise what's the point?
B0006284JQ|4.0|Thank God for Britney.  By deciding, just a scant five and a half years into her career, that it was time for a \\"Best of...\\" album  Miss Spears has permitted us who have long resisted the tempation to buy any of her albums, the embarassement of owning one of her previous individual efforts.  By truly putting what is the \\"Best of Britney Spears\\" on one single album, the closet Britney fan only needs to hide or otherwise disguise just one CD.  And with the more mature, yet provocative \\"My Prerogative\\" cover photo, one may be even able to forgo even, that.  No need to worry about the troubling young Britney peeking out from the cover of \\"...Baby One More Time\\"--a cover that was starkly in contrast to her young popstar yet sex-tart image.<br /><br />If you have a weakness...er, fondness for some of Britney's songs, all the best will be found here:  Pop hits including the aformentioned \\"...Baby One More Time\\", \\"Oops!...I Did It Again\\", \\"Stronger\\" and the beautiful ballad \\"Everytime\\".  There is a nice bonus CD of great remixes of these songs, worth well over the price of the CD alone if you had to buy the singles for these.  There are also some not so great hits including \\"Lucky\\", \\"Boys\\", and \\"I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman\\".  These are probably the songs that Britney wrote herself that were meant to appeal to her younger, and now thoroughly corrupted...er, Britney-ized core-audience.<br /><br />I'm sure there are plenty of parents who are not Thanking God for Britney Spears.  Besides being single-handedly responsible for the prominent emergence of the ellipsis (\\"...\\") in song titles, many feel the arrival of Miss Spears coincides with the growth of  overtly sexual images targeted towards the young, especially teenage girls, including short skirts, lower back tatoos, and girl-on-girl kissing.  My sympathies to you, conservative America, but it must be said that Miss Spears is a phenomenon.  She has, with her contemporaries, almost single-handedly changed the face of American Pop music forever.  Or at least for the last five and half years.<br /><br />Of course, it could be argued that the only \\"Best of...\\" Britney Spears that anyone ever need is the \\"Toxic\\" single.  And I can accept that argument. But for anyone who needs just a little more Britney in your sound-system, buy this album.American Pop music forever.

B00006CXXU|5.0|I'm not usually the type to buy disposable pop music but I bought this CD last year on the recommendation of a friend.  I am still listening to it.  It's not the typical music you'd expect from someone marketed the way Christina was at first.  If you look past the way she sometimes looks and acts, this is an incredibly deep and insightful album from someone so young.  With an atypical mix of musical tastes all together. <br />Very good.
B000089CJI|5.0|Subpop's The Postal Service, defies any simple categorization.  Much has been said of the duo's Los Angeles-Seattle connection, and while it makes for interesting journalism, I think this remote collaboration speaks more to the new power of connectivity in our generation today.<br /><br />Crafted over a period of time, and despite the aformentioned remoteness, \\"Give Up\\" is full of such lush rhythms, honest emotional sentiment and memorable melodies that it speaks to the power of long-distance love.  The first time one hears these songs, there is a temptation to sing along, even if you've never even heard these songs before.  Nestled in their homey beats and inviting lyrics lies love lost and won over and over again:  Gibbard and Tamborello have written a love album for a generation who has grown up without one.<br /><br />I love playing this album for those who have not heard it before.  Nearly everyone of a certain age, or at least attitude instantly \\"get's it\\".  Here is substance and composition for the masses when the density of Radiohead remains reserved for the few. When my kids ask me about the music of the 00's (Naughties), I will just put this album on and say, \\"It was about this.\\"
B00024I2Z4|5.0|This is certainly the best Disney animation I've ever seen. An awesome story line, beautiful Chinese elements, great songs and background music... MULAN ROCKS!! <br /> <br />A note to those who find this animation Japanese. The Tang dynasty, when the story of Fa Mulan happened, was the period when the Chinese empire flourished. Historical research shows that Japan was one of the countries which had been sending students to study in China during this period. As a result, the students eventually brought back Chinese cultures including clothings, architecture, tea and language etc. back to their own country. One of the examples are the large amount of Chinese characters which Japanese people would use when they write nowadays.
B0002XDODU|3.0|Since the appearance of their last release, \\"Mutter\\", Rammstein has decided to take a different direction musically. Rammstein had made themselves known by their bone crunching catchy riffs and almost danceable metal sound. They might feel that their music is maturing, but most of the time, as is the case with most metal bands that make it big, the cost of that \\"maturity\\" is a new sound that does not please the fan base. If maturity is not the right term to use to describe this drastic change in their musical style, then the only other way to describe it is that this latest release is an attempt to make music for the masses. To even attempt this considering this is Rammstein we're talking about here is quite foolish, because not only will people say that they \\"sold out\\", but that most of these songs do not stand out as \\"musical genius\\" in any sense of the word. <br /> <br />The only songs worth noting are \\"Reise Reise\\", \\"Dalai Lama\\", \\"Ohne Dich\\". <br /> <br />I am a die hard Rammstein fan, and I am not disappointed with this new release. However, if Rammstein had started out making music that sounded like this, then I am sorry to say that I would have never become a fan in the first place. <br /> <br />From me, this CD gets a rating from of 3 out of 5. Better luck next time, I hope!
B0001IN080|5.0|I really cannot say enough about this fabulously inspiring DVD! Michael Buble has become my constant companion and our relationship just keeps getting better and better. From the moment our eyes first \\"met\\", I have been in love with everything about Michael. His voice, his stage presence, his kooky antics with his friends while on tour, all combine to make his \\"Come Fly With Me\\" DVD a must-have for any music fan, particularly those hailing from Canadia. His rendition of \\"Moondance\\" is enough to make a girl toss her undies on stage and scream at the top of her lungs for more Buble (and his sweet Van Morrison covers). I have even installed an in-dash DVD player so I can enjoy CFWM while I'm on the go!! Sometimes DWBO (Driving While Buble's On) can be dangerous but only 2 fender benders so far, and no serious injuries yet(PHEW)!!

B00008YZYM|4.0|Is this adequate remake of the 1960 Hayley Mills classic. I wish the pacing of this film had been slower as it would have been nearly as the original if it had just been slower paced as the actors (especially Lohan) are first rate in their acting.
B000001FT0|3.0|Steve Winwood's third solo album, \\"Talking Back To The Night\\", was originally released in August of 1982, and it's quite similar to its predecessor \\"Arc of a Diver\\".  Nicole Winwood did sing background vocals on a couple tracks, but otherwise, like \\"Arc...\\", there's no one else involved in making the album--Steve played, produced, and engineered the album entirely by himself.    \\"Talking Back To The Night\\" really does sound like a one-man-band album.  It seems quite obvious that for most of the songs, if not all of them, Steve laid down drum machine parts first so he had a foundation to build the rest of the song upon (it's telling that in his liner notes he gives special thanks to Linn Electronics Inc, known for bringing drum machines into prominence in the early '80s).  It's an interesting and easily understandable approach, and occasionally Steve hits the nail squarely on the head, as on the classic hit \\"Valerie\\".    You could make a case that \\"Valerie\\" suffers a bit from the straight-down-the-middle bare bones drum machine rhythm, with no fills or 'cymbals' whatsoever, but in the end, I think the 'minimalist' arrangement complements the song perfectly, not to mention that it's just such a beautiful song, one of my all-time favorites.    Steve goes really heavy on the synthesizers here, and it tends to be problematic.  There are a couple of terrific songs here in addition to \\"Valerie\\".  \\"Help Me Angel\\" is an irresistibly catchy feel-good tune with a great crunchy synth sound that helps the song's fun riffs really take off; and the arresting, atmospheric title track is a haunting song about drug addiction--stylistically, it resembles \\"Night Train\\" from his previous album, but it's edgier and far superior.  However, the synths are really dreary and headache inducing at times, as on the album-closing ballad \\"There's A River\\".  \\"Valerie\\", \\"Help Me Angel\\", and the title track all appear in 'updated' versions on the \\"Chronicles\\" compilation album from 1987, and that'srather interesting because they are easily the three best songs on this album.      That leads to what is really the album's main failing in the end: the songwriting.  Every song here was written by Steve Winwood and Will Jennings--I assume Winwood wrote all the music, and that Jennings was primarily, if not entirely, responsible for the lyrics, which are really lame at times and weigh down the songs--the ballad \\"And I Go\\" is quite an embarassing song about making love, and \\"It Was Happiness\\" has really cheesy 'passage of time' romance lyrics.  \\"Still in the Game\\" is a decent tune, but both it and \\"It Was Happiness\\" are exhaustingly long-winded, as if Steve was straining to build a song around Jennings' lyrics.      In the end, there's a few must-have tunes here, but it's overall a frustratingly mixed bag.

B000002J2F|5.0|The very thought of Genesis' 1980 album \\"Duke\\" receiving a considerable amount of hostility is truly unjust and, frankly, ridiculous.  \\"Duke\\", originally released on March 31, 1980, is, in some ways, a transitional record, but here's the thing...  Serious fans realize that Genesis did not suddenly become a \\"pop\\" band overnight--the shift to a less progressive, more \\"pop\\"-ish sound was an extremely gradual one, & that said, a case can very much be made that every Genesis album from 1976 through 1983 are transitional ones.  This album, sonically, is nearly identical to the previous album \\"...And Then There Were Three\\"--both albums featured production by David Hentschel.      To put it a certain way, I think if \\"Duke\\" had been released by an obscure band, it would have an absolutely fanatical cult following.  As it is, it somehow seems to have gotten something of a bad rap with its increasing prominence of Phil Collins in the songwriting department.  However, an album of this caliber can only be supplied by the likes of Banks, Collins, & Rutherford.  If you think this is a straightforward pop-rock record, obviously the only tracks from it that you`re familiar with are \\"Misunderstanding\\" and \\"Turn It On Again\\".      Classify the album however you want though--the bottom line is that this is a masterpiece.  Tony Banks' compositional brilliance is in serious abundance on this album, displaying why he is so widely admired by so many progressive rock fans.  Vocally, Phil is in a weirdly transitional phase on \\"Duke\\"--his vocals are expressive & powerful, yet throughout the album, there's a `little guy' humbleness to his vocals, something that, strangely, was almost completely washed away even by the time of Phil's debut solo album \\"Face Value\\" from early the following year.  Listen to Phil's vocals on Tony's gloomy, soothing, and dreamy ballad \\"Heathaze\\", or on Mike Rutherford's slightly weepy, yet soulful, soaring ballad \\"Alone Tonight\\", and you'll see what I mean--you never really heard that timbre from Phil ever again.  It's almost as if after this album was completed Phil got an extra shot of testosterone.      Also, I want to point out the drumming.  Phil's crisp, fluent drumming on here, which is brilliantly captured in the mix, is incredible.  I'm not exactly sure about the chronology, but I *think* the recording of \\"Duke\\" came just before Phil, along with Hugh Padgham and Steve Lillywhite (while working on the third \\"Peter Gabriel\\" album), hit upon the gated \\"In the Air Tonight\\" drum sound that was soon to become a trademark of his.      The album opens with \\"Behind the Lines\\", which has an exciting, fast-paced 2+ minute instrumental intro (reminiscent of the intro of Zeppelin's \\"The Song Remains The Same\\") before the wonderfully melodic, mellower song portion begins.  \\"Duchess\\" also starts off with a 2+ minute instrumental portion which features atmospheric drum machine, washes of guitar, and ethereal keyboard chord changes from Banks--it's really beautiful, and it builds into the main song portion which has soaring Phil vocals, singing a haunting tale about the rise and fall of a female singer.  Rutherford's \\"Man of Our Times\\" is an anthemic song loaded with catchy riffs that explodes out of the speakers/ headphones--it features searing vocals from Collins that, strangely, are majorly buried in the dense mix.      The two hit singles are terrific as well.  \\"Misunderstanding\\" (which is indeed highly reminiscent of Sly & the Family Stone's \\"Hot Fun in the Summertime\\") is a sophisticated, yearning mid-tempo love song.  And \\"Turn It On Again\\" has an ultra-catchy Rutherford guitar riff, and it's sort of a feel-good tune, but with a highly contemplative feel to it.      Phil also delivers a really hard-hittingly emotional ballad with \\"Please Don't Ask\\", a track which strongly underlines how unfair the criticism Phil has received about his songwriting over the years really is.  Listen to the chord changes and the elegant shifts of key that masterfully intertwine with the lyrics of the song, heightening its emotional impact.      Genesis bring closure to the album in emphatic fashion with the multi-part, mostly instrumental \\"Duke's Travels\\" which really takes you on a musical journey, and it segues into the last track, \\"Duke's End\\", which is a reprise of the intro to \\"Behind the Lines\\".      All that said, calling this album a sellout pop-rock simply doesn't pan out.  \\"Duke\\" is an album that offers a wealth of astonishing musicality, masterful use of dynamics, and brilliant composition.  I've been listening to \\"Duke\\" since I was a kid, and my understanding, respect, and admiration of it has only grown since then.  And with so much emotionally resonant music here, it's an album that can go a long way to help pull you through the dark phases of your life as well.  If you've got a serious love for music, you can't go wrong with this stunning must-have album.    (P.S.  One gripe I have with both this \\"original recording remastered\\" version and the earlier CD version is that the track mark dividing \\"Dutchess\\" & \\"Guide Vocal\\" was improperly inserted--that bit you hear at the beginning of track 3 is actually the closing portion of \\"Dutchess\\", not the intro to \\"Guide Vocal\\".)

0446677450|3.0|This book is good reference on tips and philosophy for creating a successful financial mentality. In general it's very good advice, if you live in hyper-consumer america. But it's way off on being a universal guide to success. Why is this important? I've seen the book traslated into different languages, so I guess the idea is for it to have a global impact. But the financial mechanics of Mr. Kiyosaki only work in the dynamics of american econony. So if you live outside the US, only the philosophy side is of value, while the practical side is questionable. You cannot make money Kiyosaki style in a country without propper or inefficient social and political institutions, such as education, propper legal system and most of all high corruption. Systems have to be improved. So some concepts in the book are widely different depending on where you live and work. What I found the most questionable is when Mr. Kiyosaki considers a home a \\"liability\\" instead of an asset. Buying a home, for most individuals in the world, is the single most important investment you will make in a lifetime. It's the place you will raise your family, and maybe even leave to your kids. For many, our home is our haven. Paying off your house is definetly the best and first step for financial (and family) success. So this book is a good starting point for establishing a winning financial mentality, although only in theory.

B000000OQF|4.0|I'll start by saying that Appetite for Desruction is a bloody marvellous album. Slash, Izzy, Duff and Steve are all playing like legends. Now this next bit is not very easy to say but I think that Axl's voice gets a bit annoying by the end. I'm not saying that his voice is crap, he's the second best frontman ever in my books (behind Freddie Mercury RIP). It's just that Axl has a high singing voice and a low one. What makes the Use Your Illusion albums so great is that he uses his entire vocal range. On Appetite for desruction he only uses his high singing voice and it grates your nerves just a bit. But this is still a fantastic album and is highly recommended.
B000002JR8|5.0|The first actual pantera album i heard was Vulgar Display,immediately i knew there was something different about the band,namely phils voice but more so the guitar sound of DIMEBAG.So then i went back and picked up cowboys,liked it even better,so i was pysched to see the release and grammy nomination of this album.It became an instant classic when i heard it,not that the other ablums were bad this one just had a different feel.Dimebags unique and versitile playing style really hit me,also i must say i call this a very HEAVY Black Sabbath(Paranoid) album.Reason being most if not all of Dimebags solos on this album have no backing guitar rythms,just bass lines,giving it a very very very sabbathish feel.Also the adding of the track Planet Caravan is a definate plus at the end of the album. <br /> <br />1.Strength Beyond Strength-Great speedy opening track,much in the vein of F#%$king Hostile. <br /> <br />2.Becoming-Some of Vinnie Pauls best foot work,and the beginning of Dimebags screeching whammy petal trademark sound. <br /> <br />3.5 Minutes Alone-The name says it all,5 minutes alone with this track and you'll be kicking the walls:)\\"Headbutt some broken glass\\" <br /> <br />4.I'm Broken-Most popular track off the album and definately how phil must feel after hearing of Dimebags tragedy:( <br /> <br />5.Good Friends and a Bottle of Pills-Not really a song but still gets an odd point across of sleeping with someone elses girl friend,while the guy is totally out cold or dead on drugs. <br /> <br />6.Hard Lines,Sunken Cheeks-A definate Cocaine song,extremely heavy with great break down moments. <br /> <br />7.Slaughtered-Heavy heavy heavy...just as heavy as any death metal out there including Cannibal Corpse,incredibly grooving middle section break also...did i mention its heavy? <br /> <br />8.25 years-Definately about phils battles during his first 25 years of life,considering thats how old he was when they made the album.....good song. <br /> <br />9.Shedding Skin-Something i'm sure we've all done,piss people away.Very moody,and again great riffs buy Dime,a very sabbathish sounding song. <br /> <br />10.Use my third arm-Not sure if its about what it sounds like but a very killer march like beginning that throughs down hard with a riff manic punch. <br /> <br />11.Throes of Rejection-Much in the same vein as the last this song is balls all the way through,with a very steady pace as if you were in the Heavy Metal marching band.Great offensive lyrics also. <br /> <br />12.Planet Caravan-Great choice for a Sabbath cover,Dimebag shines with his outro solo and its a very very good likeness of the original,trippy and all.And giving credit to Phil(being the jerk that he is)i will say he does an excellent job of sounding like ozzy.Good way to wind it up. <br /> <br />All that said this is definately my fav pantera album and also in the top 10 of fav metal albums for me.
B00062ZE3U|5.0|I haven't been a fan of Within Temptation for very long. I first heard their song \\"Our Farewell\\" on a Celtic Music compilation \\"Celtic Circle\\" (which also featured \\"Sleeping Sun\\" by Nightwish). I was completely blown away and so I was able to hear pieces of the \\"Mother Earth\\" CD. It was good, but it was a little different from what I listen to. This CD is so damn good, it hasn't left my CD player since I got it.     Really stand-out songs are:    2. \\"See Who I Am\\" - Sharon Den Adel's voice is beautifully crystal clear in this piece. The loud guitars work so well with the Russian Choirs and the Orchestra.     3. \\"Jillian (I'd Give My Heart)\\" - The choirs are most wonderful in here. Sharon's voice hits those high notes so beautifully. This song is enough to make anyone a fan!    4. \\"Stand My Ground\\" - There is a lot of bitching about how this song is too mainstream. Give it a rest, I say. This song is good, but most of the songs on here are much better. This beats Evanescence hands-down (I'm a fan of Evanescence as well, Sharon's voice is still so much better though).    7. \\"Angels\\" - Sharon really get's the sound right in here. Her voice is just so angelic in here.     8. \\"Memories\\" - by far my favorite. This song kicks off with some melancholically beautiful violin work and pianos in the background. As it progresses it just changes the atmosphere.     9. \\"Aquarius\\" - is a great song. It really reflects more of the work on \\"Mother Earth\\".     10. \\"It's the Fear\\" - again a beautiful mixture of orchestral and metal sounds. Just awesome..    11. \\"Somewhere\\" - is so beautiful.     12. \\"A Dangerous Mind\\" - Essential Within Temptation    13. \\"The Swan Song\\" - some more use of Celtic instruments. Brilliant    Overall this album is probably the best one of I've ever heard from this group. The extra money for this import with tracks 12 and 13 is so worth it!! I couldn't live without hearing these last two songs.
B000007NYS|4.0|It's the album that put Lucinda on the critical map, but it's admittedly not my favorite - songs like \\"The Night's Too Long\\" and \\"Like a Rose\\" are uninspiring and forgettable.  Still, even as I would prefer every subsequent album she's put out (there's not a lagging one in her collection), this self-titled release has its handful of unforgettable gems - the melancholic ode to dance clubs, \\"Crescent City\\" is fun and whistful in the same breath, \\"I Just Wanted to See You So Bad\\" is alive and exciting in a way that's rare for Lucinda to venture into, and, of course, there's \\"Side of the Road,\\" one of the most humane and empassioned adult songs of Williams's career - few songs have ever sung aobut the desire for independence within a stable relationship so charismatically.  She's made masterpieces since this record, but few artsts could ask for an album even of this quality.
B00005YTFG|1.0|I could not believe raves over this movie. I found the premise completely pointless. I kept waiting for \\"Colonel\\" Graham Chapman to stomp in and announce \\"This picture is too silly, and I'm stopping it!\\"
6304711905|5.0|There is a lot to like...and I mean really LIKE...about George P. Cosmatos' \\"Tombstone\\". The Earp-Clanton story has been done and re-done throughout motion picture history (and television as well) but never as engagingly as this. One cannot watch this movie without getting the feeling that everyone involved in the making of this film had themselves a grand old time. It is lovingly crafted, superbly cast and acted, gorgeously photographed, and meticulously costumed .  <br />  It does play \\"fast and loose\\" with history somewhat, but, who cares? (If you DO care, here's some of the fast & looseness: <br />   1. Nobody knows who killed John Ringo . He was found dead <br /> in a wooded canyon one day with his boots off and tied to his horse's saddle. He had a fired pistol in his hand and a hole in his head. Billy Breakenridge (the Jason Priestly character in the movie) always considered Ringo (a manic-depressive, especially when drunk) a suicide, as did the local coroner. <br />   Whoever killed him (if not himself), it wasn't Doc Holliday. Doc fled to Colorado after the \\"Vendetta Ride\\" and had to stay there. Through political connections, that was the only place he could stay for a long while and not risk extradition to Arizona (and certain death from the Behan faction). Even so, the Arizona crowd sent killers to Colorado from time to time to try and kill Doc. At one point an \\"Arizona Lawman\\" tried killing Holliday and died himself. Then \\"They\\" demanded Doc's extradition. It took the legendary Bat Masterson to get Doc out of that jam (something else that should be put on film). But no, Doc didn't go back to Arizona and wasn't, therefore, on hand at the right time to tell Johnny Ringo that he was \\"no daisy\\". <br />  2. \\"The Gun\\" is shown...the famous Wyatt Earp long-barrelled \\"Buntline Special\\"...but it is <br />marked as something \\"Presented to Wyatt Earp by the Grateful Citi- <br />zens of Dodge City, Kansas, 1878.\\" It wasn't. It was a present given by western novelist \\"Ned Buntline\\" to members of a posse that pursued a Texas cattleman who murdered a dance hall girl in Dodge City. The man was captured and returned for trial (Bat Masterson shot him off his horse at long distance with a rifle) <br />and Masterson, Earp, Bill Tilghman, and several other members of the \\"Dora Hand Posse\\", got the firearms. They were Colt. 45 revolvers with 10\\" barrels that could have a rifle stock fitted to them and converted into \\"carbines\\". Buntline had fancy walnut handgrips, with the name \\"Ned\\" carved on them, affixed to these revolver/carbines and THAT made them \\"Buntline Specials\\"...NOT the barrel lengths. In \\"Gunfight At the OK COrral\\" Burt Lancaster ,as Earp, is shown sitting in his office in Dodge City and actually fitting the stock to one of these weapons. <br />  3.Wyatt Earp saw LITTLE of Doc Holliday after the \\"Vendetta Ride\\". He did NOT visit him regularly at Glenwood Springs and was NOT there on the day of Doc's death. This is a touching...and EFFECTIVE...piece of fiction. <br /> 5. Sherman McMasters was never killed, by dragging or otherwise. <br /> 6. One reviewer commented that Doc staring at his feet in the \\"This is funny\\" sequence had to do with \\"seeing a light\\" before you died. This is an error. Those utterances relate to the death of Morgan Earp. The meaning of the remark by Doc Holliday is this: in the old west there was an old saying that those who lived by the gun...or violence...would die in a saloon or in a street...\\"with their boots on\\" (the Errol Flynn Custer movie is, in fact, entitled \\"They Died With Their Boots On\\"). Holliday had been TOLD by people that he was ABSOLUTELY going to be one of those people who died that way. But here at his end, he looks down at his feet, and he is in a BED...BARE FOOTED. And he laughs at the irony of it, and says \\"This is funny\\". <br />  7. The 15-year old girl Doc tells Earp about being in love with, who went into a convent, who was his cousin, was also a relative to someone else: Margaret Mitchell. In \\"Gone With the Wind\\", Melanie Holliday became \\"Melanie HAMILTON\\", and never became \\"Sister Melanie\\", she became just Ashley Wilkes' saintly wife instead. And out of family sensibilities, John Henry Holliday was never mentioned. <br />  8. NOBODY (except Wild Bill Hickok) wore a red sash. That was <br />a GIMMICK the producers used to appeal to big city \\"colors\\" gang mentality...to \\"hip\\" up the imagery and maybe help box office sales. <br />  Historical inaccuracies aside, this movie is wondrous. Powers Booth is wonderful as Bill Brocious, Michael Biehn is superb as Ringo (the \\"In Vino Veritas\\" scene is a riot). Sam Elliott is just wonderful old Sam Elliott. Kurt Russell LOOKS like Wyatt Earp (more than any other actor ever to essay the role) and Kilmer is just \\"The Cat's Meow\\" as Holliday (Dennis Quaid does <br />a great version in the Costner flick, as well...as does Kirk Douglas in \\"Gunfight at the OK Corral\\"...but Kilmer's Doc is the definitive Doc). The movie just flows and you hate to see it end. <br />Kevin Costner's Wyatt in HIS movie is closer in \\"character\\" (surly guy with a head-knocking attitude) than Russell's, but Russell's Earp is the way Wyatt SHOULD have been. <br /> <br />   Don't miss this movie. It is a real jewel.
0884271153|4.0|In term of contents, this book is marvelous. In terms of plot and story-telling style, this book is quite dry for a novel, comparing to THE GOAL. <br />This book doesn't offer a pleasure of good reading. That makes it huge different with THE GOAL. Eli probably needs Jeff Cox to fix them. <br />
B0006399FS|3.0|U2 have produced an album that could have been recorded back in the days of \\"New Years Day\\"- and that may or may not be a good thing, depending on your particular tastes. If you want that U2 sound- the heavily echoed sparse guitar arpeggios, the plaintive whining vocal- it's all here in spades. If you look for bands that change and try new things, there's not much here for you. It's not just a rehash of old sounds, like, say, the last dozen Rolling Stones albums. And there's at least one sort of catchy tune. But there's nothing here you haven't heard on every other U2 album.
B0002VL0KQ|4.0|I don't even really care for Celion's music but this cd is beautiful...The songs are choosen well and this cd sums up how I feel about my son. I'm already choosing the song I want for our first dance when he gets married. (he's 18 months old)  Ha! Worth the money! If you are unsure listen to sample songs...thats what I did and I ended up buying it. I proably would not have ever even thought of it but glad to see that amazon offers sample bits...it really helped me make my decesion.
B000002KGT|5.0|Yes, I was nearly 6 years old when this came out, and when I hear these songs, I am reminded of my childhood. Of course I know the hits, but I always preferred the songs that they didnt play on the radio so much. its the more esoteric songs that bring me down memory lane. The song that is te most guilty of my sojorn into the 70s is \\"Never Going Back Again\\". For years I never knew the song title, I just recognized the songs. Then by pure chance, Never Going Back Again came on the radio, and I instantly remembered it. I had not heard it for probably 20 years and it was such a strange feeling to be hearing it again after all these years had made me forget it. I think a tear or two might have issued forth. The 20 years just kind of melted away. \\"Gold Dust Woman\\" is also a favorite, but Ive heard it through the years. I also remember songs from the earlier album, \\"World Turning\\", \\"Monday Morning\\" and \\"Over My Head\\". When I heard these songs again, they made me very happy. A long time has past by since 1977, but in a few instances I was transported back to a time where, in the words of Black Sabbath: \\"Innocence and love was all I knew.\\" and it all didnt seem so long gone. Thank you for those songs Stevie, Lindsay, Christine, John and Mick. From my heart, to yours.
B00005JLEJ|5.0|I orginally saw this movie on video in the late 80's.  I have not been able to find it since.  Considered a prequel to Ran, Kagemusha is more of a historical piece while Ran is an adaptation of Shakespeare's King Lear.   <br />Beautifully shot in color, Kagemusha tells the story of the Takeda clan during the civil war period of Japan's feudal era.  The head of the clan, Takeda Shingen, was considered the greatest general of his time.  His presence alone kept the other great warlords at bay, namely Oda Nobunaga, the man eventually credited with uniting Japan.  Mortally wounded in battle, Shingen commanded that his death be kept a secret, and his clan not move from its' mountain stronghold for three years.  His double, or Kagemusha, was a common thief.  His character arc, as it moves from common criminal to eventual warlord and tragic fall is magnificent. <br />To simply label Kagemusha as a practice movie for Ran is an injustice (though accurate).  If you have any interest in samurai films of feudal Japanese pieces, you wont be disappointed.
B0002SROSQ|5.0|There is too much music here for me to comment on all of it specifically --- at least not if I don't want to get fired. But Nick has delivered with these albums --- he seems to have elevated his art once again. Beautiful and compelling the whole through.
B00003CXPJ|4.0|remember when this movie came out and no one liked it?  that was funny.<br /><br />just another example of how people can be stupid.  listen to your friend billy zane, he's a cool dude.
B00009V7P8|4.0|This is a true gem of a record.  Damien Rice brings depth to the often empty realm of the singer/songwriter genre.  The music is full of delicious takes on several musical landscapes and sounds.  The style seems to come from all around, pulled out of the ethereal musical mist of past greats. Each song is laden with emotion and deep, introspective lyrics.  The intimate melodies instantly tickle your ears.  His vocal stylings yearn with passion, often pushing him to the edge with just the right amount of cracking to be the perfect envelope for the pain and passion being written about.  His vocal and breath phrasings are unique and keep the songs interesting.  I believe this album is for anyone who simply loves talent and beautiful art.
0887306667|4.0|I thought that this book was very easy to read and understand.  The authors tells you very well about all the laws of marketing which I thought could be a very good guideline for people in the marketing field. It is a very short book so it won't take you too long to finish it!!! Highly recommended for reading!!!
B0002KVUKM|3.0|Really 3 1/2 stars. <br /> <br />Forget that the name implies that this has anything to do with the classic Van Helsing/Dracula conflict.  If you're looking for anything related to the classic tail then you should probably steer clear of this movie.  Think more along the lines of 007.  That's right.  There's Van Helsing (aka 007) working for an organization out to save the world from ghouls and ghosts complete with M and Q equivalents and lots of \\"state of the art\\" equipment.  The movie is not so much great for its subject matter or its acting.  The movie is great for its special effects. <br /> <br />Some of the criticisms are that they try and cram too many beasties in the film.  After all you get werewolves, Dr. Jeckle & Mr. Hyde, Frankenstein's monster, and of course Dracula and his three wives.  Yes, the plot is thin trying to work all of these characters in, but like I said, it's a fun movie that a showcase for the FX folks.  Enjoy it for what it is.
B0006399FS|5.0|What the nay-saying reviewers fail to realize is that you don't \\"get\\" a new U2 record in one sitting.  Those of us who have been fans since the ancient times know this.  You can't just skim the surface of their music.  You have to sit with it, open yourself to it, and let it love you.  If you can do this, the result is spine-tingling, soul-renewing redemption.  Every time.
B00005NKW3|5.0|I feel like there was never a time that I didn't know MIRACLE ON 34th STREET, so intimately is this wonderful movie connected with the Christmas season. MIRACLE is a richer and more complex film than many take it to be, and it can be enjoyed on more that one level. It is a heart-warming parable of child-like faith overcoming cynicism. It is also a satire on big business, commercialism, psychoanalysis (which was becoming popular in the 1940's), and political machines. For me, the most interesting element of the movie is the subplot involving the psychiatrist, Mr. Sawyer (Porter Hall), who has ambitions of being a psychoanalyst but is stuck in an unfulfilling job giving intelligence tests. He dabbles in Freudian studies on the side and, filled with delusions of grandeur, thinks that he is qualified to psychoanalyze Alfred, an impressionable young boy who works at Macy's. This encroachment on the innocence of children raises the ire of Kris Kringle, the Macy's Santa Claus with delusions of his own; by acting out his anger on Sawyer, he gets himself committed to a sanitarium. That Sawyer is ultimately defeated (when Mr. Macy fires him) is fitting and just, but also - like many villains in classic drama - gives him a hope of redeeming himself. Porter Hall, Gene Lockhart (as the judge), Philip Tonge, William Frawley, Jerome Cowan, Maureen O'Hara, John Payne, and young Natalie Wood all make this movie sparkle; and as for Edmund Gwenn - what can I say? - he IS Santa Claus!
0446608955|5.0|The novel A Walk to Remember, written by Nicholas Sparks, is a captivating and heartwarming story of two teenagers in love set in 1958. The popular movie does no justice to the book, which tells further of the deep love the teens shared for each other, and the life lessons learned by each character. <br /> Set in the late fifties, A Walk to Remember is told in the first person view of Landon Carter.  Landon is a teenager at the age of seventeen, and is apparently on the wrong side of the tracks.  He is known for getting in a little bit of mischief, and he is the boy most parents do not want their daughters going out with.  Living in the religious town of Beaufort, North Carolina, Landon is looked down upon as a teenager for his mistakes..  He is growing up with a lot of anger inside of him from the lack of relationship with his father, Worth Carter, who is a popular politician.  It is only when he truly gets to know Jamie Sullivan that he begins to realize the lifelong lesson to not take advantage of what you have, and it is also then that he experiences his first and only love.  Landon and Jamie had gone to school together for years.  However, her father is the minister of the town's Baptist church, and Jamie is an active member, while Landon does not really prefer to go to church.  He has always thought of her as the typical `do-gooder' for her good grades and gracious personality, shown through her actions. <br />Jamie is the kind of girl that would pull weeds in someone's yard without being asked or stop traffic to help little kids cross the road.  She'd save her allowance to buy a new basketball for the orphans, or she'd turn around and drop the money into the church basket on Sunday.  She was, in other words, the kind of girl who made the rest of us look bad, and whenever she glanced my way, I could not help but feel guilty, even though I hadn't done anything wrong. (23) <br />Landon does not find her attractive at first because he could not look past the factthat Jamie was not `model' beautiful.  He was looking for only outward appearances.  She is average looking, with a gorgeous personality and nature.  It is when Landon gets in trouble and is forced to take drama class in his senior year with her that Landon is given yet another chance to get to know this girl that he has gone to school with all his life, and he takes it. Symbolically, Jamie is cast as the angel in the play that they are in together, and Landon is cast as the lead character, which the angel helps.  In the story outside of the play, that is exactly what happens between Landon and Jamie.  Sparks did this to create irony and symbolism, for she is the angel in Landon's life.   <br /> It is when Landon and Jamie practice their lines that his relationship with Jamie grows to be more than platonic.  Landon begins to realize his past actions were not what life was about.  With Jamie's help, Landon realizes that life is not meant to be taken for granted.  He begins to do things that he had not done before that helps him take full advantage of his life.  He goes with Jamie to help the town orphans at the orphanage, he attends church on a more regular basis, and he is overall a nicer boy.  Adults are beginning to realize he is not a bad kid, and Landon sees that it is more fulfulling to do nice things for others than for himself.  Jamie is the angel in his life by helping him be a better, more mature person. <br /> Landon's euphoria comes to a screeching halt when Jamie confesses to him that she has a terminal disease called leukemia.  This is heartbreaking for Landon and the readers as well, and it is then that he realizes the true reason Jamie does the things she does.  She only has a short time to live, so she wants to make a positive impact on the world around her by doing gracious and sweet things for those in need, even if it is not apparent that the person in need, which is the case with Landon.  She alone had seen that he needed some help, and by beingso close with him, she helped him to create a stronger relationship with his father and with those around him.  She taught him how to live life like it is his last day, a lesson that stays with him forever.  She also taught him what love is, romantic and otherwise. <br />Love is always patient and kind. It is never jealous. Love is never boastful or conceited. It  <br />is never rude or selfish.  It does not take offense and is not resentful.  Love takes no pleasure in other people's sins, but delights in the truth.  It is always ready to excuse, to trust, to hope and to endure whatever comes. (215) <br />Upon hearing this passage read by Jamie, Landon takes it all into his heart, and it is then that he realizes that he will never love another the way he loves Jamie.  He then asks her to marry him, and she consents, and they are wed by her father just days before she passes away. <br /> A Walk to Remember shows readers the meaning of love, forgiveness, and purity through the character of Jamie Sullivan.  The theme of not taking life for granted is shown throughout the entire novel, as forgiveness and the essence of love are shown as well.  Despite being set in 1958, it is written in the year 2000, at a time when such true love is rare and not nearly as appreciated.  This novel is an inspiring, heartfelt story that causes its readers to have a better outlook on life.  Sparks truly does well in capturing the feeling adoration and selflessness with the characters' actions and language.  Everyone who reads this book truly is touched by the meaningfulness and the honestly of the teenagers, and the effect these few months spent with Jamie had on the character of Landon.  After reading this novel, one cannot help but hope for true love to come their way.  <br />
B0002OERI0|5.0|I remember buying Dookie way back in '94.  That album was great, but didn't have too much lasting appeal.  After I sold it at a second hand record shop I never really payed much attention to Green Day.  They fell way under the radar while at the same time maintaining a respectable audience, but it wasn't until this year that they evolved into genuinely gifted musicians.  Green Day's American Idiot is a punk record, BUT it is more sophisticated than 90% of the punk bands out there right now.  This one is melody-driven well constructed and expertly executed.  They are much better musicians than they used to be, and much better musicians than anyone else in their genre.  This is a record really worth paying for.  Downloaders who didn't pay a red cent for this one really don't deserve to listen to it.  I love this one and will for a long time.  Congrats, Green Day, on your crowning achievment.
B0002XDODU|5.0|Rammstein's latest album continues the greatness of one of the most ingenious and unique metal acts ever put together.  I would think that I would hear a mediocre or so-so song by them by now, but no.  This band just gets better and every song they make is awesome. <br /> <br />Reise Reise is a great jump for the band, this is easily their most creative album musically and I think lyrically as well.  Once you start hearing the accordion on the shanty-ish \\"Reise Reise\\", you know you are in for something special.  The album is different musically in the use of the accordion also in Moscow, and the acoustic trappings of Los which has a very cavernous bluesy feel. <br /> <br />Lyrically you have the madness of Mein Teil (taking in the story of one of Germany's notorious recent murders), to the ingenious of crass comercialism with Amerika as lead singer Teil waxes about the glory of US domination.  Or the great symobolism of Dali Lama which talks about a plane crash of scared passengers, alluding to the Dali Lama's own true fear of flying.  Absoultely brilliant! <br /> <br />They even make some poignant beautiful music in Ohne Dich (Without You), Tiel and the band has never sounded so wonderful.  And the closer Amour sounds like these Germans could easily fit in comfortable in some dingy Paris cafe. <br /> <br />An incredibly diverse album filled with symbolism, great metal, and most importantly awesome tunes!!
B00005YXZH|4.0|I remember listening to the song sampler on borders.com when this album came out two years ago and thinking eh, not for me. Nowadays my musical tastes have changed and I went back to YHF and actually liked quite a bit of it from the sampler. When I heard \\"Heavy Metal Drummer\\" I thought, ah so that's who's up to all this! The standout track= \\"Jesus, etc.\\" \\"Kamera\\" is a nice upbeat song but the album gets going from track 5 onward. All of these songs are good in their own way. The bluesy riff on \\"I'm The Man Who Loves You\\" seems alittle over worked but it still works. \\"Pot Kettle Black\\" is a catchy song and the first couple minutes of \\"Reservations\\" are a good close. Going back to this album two years after its release I was still a bit reluctant to buy it. While at times the \\"noise\\" is a little heavy I am glad that I finally bought YHF. The album gets better with every listen. Yes, I agree that Wilco may not save the world or change your life but the music is enjoyable and something different. Go ahead and give YHF a try- ya know ya wanna.
B0002Y69NG|4.0|My set has air bubbles in the center of disc 1.  I got it replaced, only to find the same bubbles again, also in disc 1.  I hope this doesn't cause problems in the future.  Warner Brothers should have better quality control, especially for a limited edition set.
B00003CXCT|4.0|I don't really understand why everybody is complaining about the changes Lucas made to the movies. I mean we're not talking about Kurosawa or Bunuel here, but about some great entertainment. So why not update a movie to ensure that its still effective 20 years later? <br />Recently I watched Spielbergs \\"Jaws\\" again. While most parts of the movie are still suspenseful, the scenes where the shark is visible just look ridiculous nowadays; you just can see at a glance its made out of plastic. So I wished they had reworked the special effects on this movie too!
B00008EY65|3.0|I enjoyed VanHelsing and the Blade series, but for some reason this one was too much.  May just be a generation gap.
B000002UB3|5.0|Abbey Road has definitely crept up to become my favorite album. While Rubber Soul, Sgt. Pepper, Revolver and the White Album are great this is the best. Some may think that the Beatles are overrated and perhaps that is true to a very minor extent but Beatlemania was Beatlemania and their music will definitely continue its longevity. Back to Abbey Road: \\"Something\\" is simply a wonderful song and around 1:30 into it there's your proof. Some think that \\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\\" and \\"Octopus's Garden\\" are too whimsical but they are just as equally enjoyable listens. (Listen for the little laugh in \\"Maxwell's...\\") \\"Here Comes The Sun\\" is still my favorite song to date. The rest of the album flows together with ease and Abbey Road just works so well! Get this album now!!!
068987474X|1.0|I bought the book at a recent book signing (I'm a sucker for marketing) and have read some of it (it doesn't say anything new after the title). The book isn't as smart as it positions itself to be, and is actually quite shallow and not well thought out at all. Moreover, there is a typo within the first few pages \\"he let's you know\\" which shows you how quickly they slapped this together.<br /><br />What you *should* do is read the reviews on here. They are waaaay funnier than the book, and a lot of them are actually insightful, with good, well thought out advice... everything this book is not.
0735619670|5.0|I don't usually bother with writing reviews, but I just had to for this.  I bought and read the first edition when it came out and loved it.  Today I was in Borders and saw the second edition on the shelf.  I grabbed it and didn't even bother opening it before buying.  I didn't want to have to wait to have it shipped by Amazon. <br /> <br />The first edition was one of my top 5 computer books of all time (I have hundreds and get most free being a college prof) and now I'm loving the second edition. <br /> <br />My only regret is that I can only give 5 stars to this book.  It's a sure 3 thumbs up out of 2 or 7 out of 5 stars. <br /> <br />BUY IT NOW.
B000003TA4|5.0|Simply put, \\"Nevermind\\" is a phenomenal album.  This is what earned Nirvana their place with other musical greats.  This is why they are ranked up their with The Beatles and The Doors. This is what started a musical revolution.  This is the album that meant so much to millions of people.  Even if Nirvana's not for you, no matter how you look at it, \\"Nevermind\\" is one of the most important albums of a generation.  It's been an amazingly powerful and important album for 13 years and will continue to be popular for 20 more.
B00006AW2E|5.0|I've always been a big fan of the US releases of Out Of Our Heads and December's Children. What I didn't know is that the UK version of Out Of Our Heads is actually a composite of songs featured on both of the above mentioned US album releases. What you don't get are the hit singles from those albums; Get Off My Cloud, Last Time & Satisfaction. But, the songs included in the UK album feature the Stones, in their prime, covering some classic Motown; Mercy Mercy & Hitch Hike, (Marvin Gaye), Stax Volt; That's How Strong My Love Is, (Otis Redding) and Sam Cooke's timeless classic Good Times.    The songs seague beautifully and hold together more cohesively than on the US albums and the digital remastering is far superior to the US releases that were originaly released on CD in the mid '80's. If you like the Stones, in their early British Blues period circia 1965-67, then you'll love this one. It ranks right up there with Aftermath and 12x5 and Rolling Stones Now as their blusey and raunchiest best!
0684874350|5.0|In Frank McCourt's childhood memoir, Angela's Ashes, the writing so clearly depicts his emotions from his past that is amazing what great detail is captivated in his memory. As the story progresses, young Frank grows into an older, wiser, more mature, and more responsible young man. He works hard for what he believes in and he is very helpful to those around him and also to himself. The way that McCourt recollected his story was so believable and realistic that it was very easy to read and relate to. He fights through the stereotypes of his nationality and social standings all as a young child. <br /> At a young age, Frank understands that his father has a problem with his drinking. He has been sent out to watch his father and to drag him home from the pub and he knows that his father has done no good for him. He loves to hear Malachy Sr.'s stories though, and he would give anything to keep his mornings with his father forever.  While relaying the story of his younger years McCourt says:  <br />I know when Dad does the bad thing. I know when he drinks the dole money and Mam is desperate and has to beg at the St. Vincent de Paul Society and ask for credit at Kathleen O'Connell's show but I don't want to back away from him and run to Mam. How can I do that when I'm up with him early every morning with the whole world asleep? (260) <br />The innocence of this shows that it is how he felt as a child whether or not he agrees with it now. At a young age, Frank just wanted to be with his father no matter what was wrong with him and the unbiased way in which he wrote this along with other parts of his story really added to the authenticity of his storytelling.  <br /> As he grows older, this statement holds true in that he expresses how he feels at that time. When Frank's father is supposed to return home one year for Christmas, Frank is not even surprised when he doesn't arrive. He really shows the reader that he no longer gets his hopes up when it comes to his father when he tells his mother, \\"He's not coming, Mam. He doesn't care about us. He's just drunk over there in England\\" (338). Frank has finally looked past what he wants (a father who is always providing for him) and realizes that he'll have to deal with what he got.  <br /> After Frank gets past the reality of his father, he begins to form dreams of his own. He wants to support his family so that they have a warm house and food to eat, but ultimately, he wants to go to America. He saw his father as the stereotypical drunken man and he chose the different path. The easiest thing he could have done was followed in his father's footsteps, but thankfully he had men like Mr. O' Halloran, Pa Keating, and Mr. Timoney telling him to pursue his dreams. For a young man put through death and tragedy at such great intervals, it is venerable that Frank resisted them. <br /> Another thing that Frank fights with is his poverty. At one point in his story, he has an outburst against the \\"respectable boys\\" saying, \\"We know they're the ones who will go to university, take over the family business, run the government, run the world\\" (343). Because he grew up in such low class conditions, he knows he has little hope of a higher destiny. He never stops pursuing his dream, but he keeps in reality. He is not allowed to stay in education because the church shuts him out, but instead of sulking he becomes a very high positioned messenger boy and for the first time, he can provide his younger brother Michael with a healthy meal. That is more worthy of praise than inheriting a business through family ties.    <br /> The thing that made this book so good was that the story was true. It is so inspiring to read of a young boy that worked hard to help his poverty stricken family when his own father didn't work hard to do so. He conquered his dreams and made it to America and lived the life that he wanted to live. He never once left his family behind although he probably had several chances and he didn'tlet the burdens of his past keep him from aspiring to be a very adequate man.  <br />

0345457684|5.0|Set on  25th century earth, in a future were humans have the technology to stored all their mind data in cortical stacks implanted in their bodies, and come back after death in other bodies or sleeves as they are called, this book is not your typical detective novel. It's more of a journey trough a fascinating and violent landscape filled with lots of technological surprises, that clearly shows just how disturbing and at the same time attracting and strangely inviting scientific achievements can be. This future is so cool you can't help it but want to be there.  Kovacs is a great main character. He's short tempered, he's violent and he goes for what he truly wants. There's lots of action in the story, A SEX SCENE THAT IS TRULLY AMAZING, and enough turns and twists to keep you well interested till the end. Richard K Morgan is definitely a writer to look into. Great Book!
B00005JLSE|4.0|I want to see the Liza Minelli version though.  I didn't think Chicago was that bad.  The media did \\"whore\\" itself for this movie though.  The songs and dance numbers were the best part.<br /><br />I liked Moulin Rouge more.
B000667GFK|5.0|\\"mexico en la Piel\\" shows that Luis Miguel is multi talented and incredibly versatile. anyone who sayd it otherwise has to crazy and has no kind of ear for music. 5 stars for luis. one suggestion would be that he could go back to his puerto rican roots and do something like \\"boriqua en las piel\\"
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|I am not sure if this cd has changed my life, except to make it much more enjoyable. I have enjoyed this album every bit as much as the Strokes Is This It and Interpol's Turn on the Birght Lights --- not compare Franz F to those two bands, but as far as catchy, rockin albums, these would be my top three favorites of the past few years. You can't go wrong buying this one I think.
B00000I07Q|4.0|Bon Jovi was at a point in their career where they could put out anything and have it spawn at least three top ten singles. The success of \\"Slippery When Wet\\" turned them into worldwide superstars. When I listen to this album, I get the feeling that I have heard it all before. That does not make this a bad album, though. There are very few filler songs compared to some of their earlier and later albums. It just seems so calculated. Of course, if you give this to someone who is new to music, this would probably be their favorite album ever, because they have never heard it before. There are several good songs on here, especially the surprisingly heavy \\"Lay Your Hands On Me,\\" (did anyone notice that Def Leppard had nearly the exact same song with \\"Pour Some Sugar on Me\\"?) which has a great riff and sounds similar to how it would in a live stadium. In fact, that's what most of the songs sound like. That's not a bad thing, but Jon goes too far sometimes, I feel nausiated when I hear the ending to the terrible \\"Bad Medicine\\" where he goes \\"Wait, I'm not done yet\\" and then they repeat the chorus again. So if you don't take this too seriuosly, you can really enjoy it, especially because it's so low-priced. But if you consider yourself a hardcore music fan, there will be very little on here for you to enjoy.
B00005YXZH|5.0|This album is like OK Computer by Radiohead in the sense that there is not even one moment of one song that seems forced or out of place or dull to me--- I enjoy every single second of this album.  Wilco is so adventurous formally and sonically while delivering interesting, catchy well wrought songs. It's mind blowing and entertaining at the same time. Only downside is that it makes so many of my other albums seem pedestrian in comparison....just as OK Computer did years ago. The fact that I only bought this now....I am embarrassed and ashamed. Oh well....need to start keeping up on what is going on more.
0316666343|4.0|The Lovely Bones By Alice Sebold was one of the most interesting novels I have ever read. The story is told from heaven by Susie Salmon,a young girl who was brutally murdered at the tender age of fourteen. The family is torn apart by the tragedy.The marriage between Susie's parents deteriorates, eventually resulting in the mother running away from everything. The middle daughter, Lindsey, is forced to grow up and assume the role of Buckley's \\"mother\\", the four year old son and brother. In so many parts of this book I felt like bursting into tears, in others I could feel hatred boiling inside of me, and sometimes I thought I could almost feel the families joy and wanted to celebrate with them.It was such  a great experience. I would reccommend this book to anyone, whether or not you belive in the afterlife.
0393035158|5.0|I hope that Sam Harris' thesis will \\"break through\\"--even if it must be hotly debated on the cable TV chat shows. It is time for a new Enlightenment/Age of Reason.<br /><br />I won't go over ground covered by earlier reviewers. There are some debatable points in the book (about collateral damage; torture; brain research; and Buddhism), but I hope they do not  overpower the larger, indisputable ones: that fundamentalism is unacceptable in political discourse (in Hitchens' words, \\"what is asserted without evidence can also be dismissed without evidence\\"); that faith (belief without evidence), even of the most benign/post-Reformation/progressive kind, is dangerous; and that we MUST confront the specifics of the Koran and modern Islam rather than discuss all religious literalism as if it is exactly the same.
B0000VD04M|5.0|I have been a big fan of Tim Burton ever since Edward Scissorhands. Moreover, the pairing of Johnny Depp and Tim Burton has proved to be commerically as well as professionally sound.<br /><br />This particular outing is no exception.  Depp simply shines as Ed Wood, arguably the tiredest director of all time.<br /><br />While the movie itself is a fun homage to the horrible director, Tim Burton elevates the project by presenting a very touching relationship between the director and actor, Bela Lugosi, brilliantly realized by Martin Landau who more than deserved his supporting actor Oscar for his performance here.<br /><br />The supporting cast of characters are all superb and this will be a movie that ranks right up there with Edward Scissorhands and Sleepy Hollow as shining examples of the pairing of Depp and Burton.<br /><br />I highly recommend!!!!
B00005ATZT|5.0|The reviewer two reviews down who thinks a U.S. Marshal wouldn't have had 'jurisdiction' apparently doesn't know that the United States Marshal Service maintains many regional Fugitive Task Forces that do what Tommy Lee Jones does in this film.<br /><br />There are three such offices in Illinois.

B0002XH9Z4|4.0|Tabloid reports and allegations of deviant behavior make it very difficult to remember that Michael Jackson was once known for his music.  But his new box set \\"The Ultimate Collection\\" takes us back to an era that reminds us what he became famous for.  The first 4 CDs cover his entire recording history, from the early years with the Jackson Five and the Jacksons, to his chart supremacy in the 80s, and the post \\"Bad\\" era during which he struggled to appear relevant as his record sales started declining.  There's also a bonus DVD, which has the full length 1992 Bucharest concert filmed during the \\"Dangerous\\" tour (the sound quality is noticeably strong).  The hits are too several for me to mention, and many of you are already familiar with them.  But what makes \\"The Ultimate Collection\\" an interesting package is the slew of unreleased demos and rare tracks.  I was pleased to see the Babyface produced ballad \\"On the Line\\" (originally recorded for Spike Lee's \\"Get on the Bus\\"), as well as the Captain EO track \\"We Are Here to Change the World\\" and an early rough version of \\"Dangerous.\\"  But while this box set gets the basics right, it does omit a few tracks diehard fans will doubtless notice.  While I'm happy to see the Jacksons' \\"This Place Hotel\\" on here, \\"Can You Feel It\\" is surprisingly missing in action.  And \\"Torture\\" and \\"Body,\\" both from the Jacksons' 1984 \\"Victory\\" LP, are nowhere to be found.  Still, \\"The Ultimate Collection\\" gives plenty for Jacksonphiles to get excited about.
B000683VI4|5.0|This Movie is an amazing, epic love story about two people who fall in love when they are young, but they are broken up because the girl's parents don't think that the man she is in love with is good enough for her. When they break up, the girl moves away and they both move on eventually. Then when they meet back up again as adults their love and pasion for one another is rekindled. But there's a twist. One of them has moved on and must now choose between her first love and a man her parents approve of.
0380733358|4.0|Follett pours on the suspense in this thriller.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  It was a bit unbeleivable but it was a very fun read anyway.
B00063MBU8|4.0|When I bought \\"Still Not Getting Any...\\" I was semi-afraid that I would get a replica of \\"No Pads, No Helmets, Just Balls\\". I was pleasantly surprised to find that, although, yes, they're still Simple Plan, pop-punk and all that, they're grown some. Don't kill me for saying that they are kind of limited in their sound...but they have created an album with songs that don't sound exactly alike with different lyrics. (Most of the songs on their debut sounded ... a lot alike, with the exception of \\"Perfect\\") <br /> <br />The lyrics are better, although still about most of the same issues. They're more mature/deeper/better...don't know how else to describe them. There's still a lot of energy but it's a smoother cd overall.  <br /> <br />Stand out tracks for me were, first of all, the last track, \\"Untitled\\". It's a smooth piano/rock melody, and it almost doesn't even sound like Simple Plan...in a good way. Their first single, \\"Welcome To My Life\\" is really good, although semi-overplayed. \\"Perfect World\\" and \\"Me Against The World\\" are also very good. The rest make up a good album, with little filler. However, some of the tracks can be more repetitive than desired. <br /> <br />A good purchase if you like the genre and of course, Simple Plan. <br /> <br />
0140177396|5.0|Of Mice and Men is definitely the best short novel i've ever read, and it is probably my second favorite book (Dostoevsky's Brothers Karamazov is first.) <br /> <br />Steinbeck's portrayal of the offbeat friendship of George and Lenny is deeply moving and engaging.  This book is a must-read!
039472903X|5.0|Everybody in advertising know the reputation David Ogilvy. Everybody know his success. But with this book, everybody can see his way of thinking. By reading this book, I wouldn't say that Ogilvy was a charismatic writer. This book is a collection of thoughts and stories from Ogilvy's life. But, who advertising professional on earth wouldn't like to know these thoughts? <br />If you are seeking for solutions, for technics and \\"how tos\\", certainly you will not find these in this book. This book is about the philosophy of advertising. And if you master this philosophy, you can create ideas for today's and tomorrow's advertising. Highly recommended for advertising professionals.

B00008DDXC|5.0|But we certainly must. A large improvement on the first, Chamber of Secrets is a dark and brooding trip into Hogwarts' dark secrets.  <br /> <br />With an improved cast (Kenneth Branagh provides his talents as the narcissistic Gilderoy Lockhart and Jason Issacs as the malicious Lucius Malfoy) and better script (more time with Harry alone instead of with Ron and Hermione) makes this movie more enjoyable for adults while still providing fun for children. <br /> <br />The set designs are quite interesting and the creatures sometimes disturbing. Severe phobics of spiders or snakes should NOT watch this. I've been eye-witness when several teenagers had to walk out while I watched it. I suggest kids 8 and older so long as they aren't scared of large spiders or snakes.
B0001NBMBC|4.0|The new album is amazing. For anyone to think otherwise is ridiculous. Go through every single track on that album and you will notice that musically and lyrically Slipknot is probably the single greatest metal band ever. Now Im not puting them ahead of the founders of metal, but other than that, they are the best. To say that their new songs are \\"mainstream\\" is just idiotic. I dont think Ive heard \\"Duality\\" or \\"Vermillion\\" more than a total of 5 times on the radio, and they still have sold just as many records as their other two albums. Their first album was their introduction to metal and how everything works in the metal scene. Their second album was a little more mature and a lot heavier. This new album shows their diversity as a band, the drumming is incredibly technical, the guitars and bass have just blown me away (Ive been a fan since Mate. Feed. Kill. Repeat. came out and I honestly never knew that #3 and #7 could play guitar like that.) and vocally, Corey Taylor can honestly say that he has mastered every type of style. He comes at you with an almost death metal scream, Nu metal high pitched scream, He can yell, and he has an absolutely incredible voice when he sings. Vermillion Part II is one of, if not the best song Slipknot has ever created. The fact that a band as driving and hard as Slipknot can produce a song of such beauty is amazing, and yet again shows their diversity. Like it or not, Slipknot's new album is just as good as the other two, and if you were a true Slipknot fan you would know that you cant have a favorite CD because they try to mature and reinvent themselves for every new Cd.
B0002F7I9Y|5.0|Ok, sure some of the duet partners are weak choices (Who is that guy, again?) but all in all, this is a wonderful CD. I recommend it and know you will not be sorry.

B00000099Y|5.0|Best CD of all time. Every single music track on the cd is absolute perfecton. The short songs are powerful and rythmic, and the longer songs hold your interest, making you wonder how they came up with this creative and flowing music. I've switched quite a few times which Tool CD is my favorite, but recently I have come to a conclusion that there really is no contest, Aenima is not only the best tool cd so far, but the greatest cd of all time. Listen to it and come back to it a few times, let it sink in and you will soon discover the feeling exuding from this band, and from this cd, the absolute perfection.
B0000VD04M|5.0|Mr Wood, was one of the great film makers of the 20th century. <br />By not working with in the studio systems he was able to make movies that had great appeal his the the only thing that stood in his way was lack of money but he over came and made some classic films the are much loved and enjoyed today. Let us also not forget <br />he befriended Bela during his last days when others had writen him off. This film pays tribute to this man and I hope inspires you  <br />to see his film.
B00005JMUL|5.0|I wanted to see this movie ever since I saw the poster in my favorate movie lobby back in the summer this year. I had only read very little at that time that the graphics were superb. I saw this movie for the first time yesterday {sun. Dec. 12 2004}. Boy, was I amazed.  First without getting into the polot yet, I was very amazed about the graphics, that I didnot really have any question. It went far above what I had expected. As far as the plot. For personal reasons, I am having a hard time getting into the Christmas cheer this year. Not knowing, what was in store for me about this movie I still wanted to see it. I had no idea what impact it had on me. This movie is one of the better Santa movies in recent years. I would recomend this movie to children of ALL ages! It is filled of holiday cheer to make your heart light. It is filled with wonderful messages on believing in your heart about the man in red. I am glad that this movie will be added to my favorates Christmas movie cannon. Cant wait for the DVD!!!!!!
B0002OERI0|5.0|Some people will be mad at the message behind the whole album, but what really matters is the music and thats where this album really excels. The first single \\"American Idiot\\" is awesome, classic green day music, but there are much better things on the way. The ten minute \\"Jesus of Seburbia\\" is awesome and completely different then anything the band has done. Those who expected a return to green day's roots will be disappointed, but those who were hoping for more will love this. The five parts each have their own sound. Jesus of Seburbia has aslightly nastalgic sound to it, while City of the Damned is slower, and I Don't Care is a harder part. Dearly Beloved's opening lines are the highlights of the songs after which it closes with \\"Tales of another broken home\\". \\"Holiday\\" could be the best song the band has ever done. It's undeniably catchy and so ridiculously addictive that you may have to play it several times before moving on. \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\" is the second single and is an awesome power ballad. Once again, it sounds like nothing the band has ever put out, and I can't wait to here it more on the radio. \\"Are we the waiting\\" is the follow up, another ballad almost as good. This leads straght into St. Jimmy. If you've been waiting for a song that sounds like they did a few years ago, this is the closest your gonna get. It's catchy, and rocks pretty hard. \\"Give me novacaine\\" sounds like something that you could have heard in the 60's or 70's, and that gives the song a unique sound. \\"She's a Rebel\\" is another catchy one, after which \\"Extraordinary girl\\" comes on. The album can essentially be split into too parts. The slower ones, and the faster rockers. Hopefully you'll like them both. \\"Extraordinary girl\\" is definatly slower.       \\"Letterbomb\\" is another one of the best. The chorus rocks, and it is quite simply more complex then anything the band has done before. But then there is also \\"Wake me up when september ends\\" another incredible song. However, it was obvious that if all of this was so great, it had to catch up to them eventually, and it does on \\"Homecoming\\" which is good, but definately not something special, but the closing track \\"Whatsername\\" is good enough to make you forget that, as it's one of the best songs on here.    AWESOME ALBUM. One of the best of 2004

0201485672|2.0|It doesn't happen often that I finish a book within 2 days. This time it is because there is surprisingly little new stuff for experienced programmers.

B00000DHRZ|5.0|Sometimes in life we listen to albums which rise in our respect and reach great levels of liking. We appreciate them and wish they always are respected by everyone around. Americana is nothing like this. It is a salute to music in its own wierd form of a straight fisted NO APOLOGY attitude.<br /><br />Its energy that comes not from youth but from life. Eddie Vedder was only partially correct when he said ALL THATS SACRED COMES FROM YOUTH.Americana is the true total sum of the feeling of punk , inspiration , pent up anger and love.....<br /><br />Way back when it came out , I purchased this record with a view to buy something worthwhile.You can say it was my first ROCK album. Did it Rock? Not! Did I Headbang? Not! DId I fly? HELL YEAH!<br /><br />The Album starts with a polite welcome which leans into HAVE YOU EVER which makes you think you've entered a room as such which the lyrics speak about.\\"Staring at the sun\\" starts just when you think you're still but your mind and heart is pacing faster than ever.\\"PRetty Fly..\\" Is something you can choose to love or hate but it will always be there, \\"Kids arent alright\\" is something that totally seems to heat things up and its a song a lot of NON OFFSPRING FANS appreciate too. Someone said \\"Feelings\\" was a filler.I think its a decent tune all the same.\\"Shes Got Issues\\" Is just about as catchy as they come. Its a great funny song we all can relate to sometime in our lives.Track 8,9 carry on NO BRAKES which is a great straight out energy filled track.\\"why dont you get a job?\\" is the reason I purchased this CD. \\"Americana\\" Is simply awesome with its brute and energy topped riffs.<br /><br />Pay the man is something I choose to dedicate a paragraph too. To me this is not only the best song on Americana but also the best song Offspring have so far released or I have heard by them. Its progressive and I can call it a masterpiece and truly the best finisher I have ever heard in my entire life(some 200-300 CDS)It reaches a stage where your neck bangs without any control. Its just as intense as music gets.<br /><br />I cant use words to describe this one album which is quite unique in its own way. Its something I can sing from start to finish non stop.After about 500+ Listens, I think Offspring gave this album everything they had. I dont even like Punk or whatever you call this music. Call it pop/rock/metal/goth/emo...whatever TO ME IT IS THE MOST ULTIMATE STRAIGHT OUT HONEST ENERGY ALBUM EVER!stage where your neck bangs without any control.

B0006399FS|5.0|I was a sceptical buyer. Part of it had to do with the title. How could a group of guys who did the ZooTV tour, or whatever it was, tell us how to dismantle an atomic bomb? Then, there was all that promotional hype that went on for a very long time before the CD came out. Then, all the negative reviews.    But, try as I might, I really am hard pressed to find very much that's negative about it. I listen to it from almost the start (skipping over the first song) to finish most of the time, not compelled as in most of their other CDs such as even \\"Joshua Tree\\" to skip sections. \\"Sometimes You Can't Make it on your Own\\" and \\"City of Blinding Lights\\" are in my opinion U2 classics. Many of the other songs are strong as well, especially the last section.    U2 has a great ability to express emotion, and when they do so with sincerity and passion, they soar. The music makes a believer out of me. There is a lot of variation and contrast within individual songs - a symphonic sound of emotion, rhythmic guitars, and synthesizers that is distinctive, rarely if ever muddled. It is a synthesis of many year's experience, incremental in it's development; but very original as a standalone. If this work were the only thing U2 had ever done or been noted for, people would be marveling at how original and heartfelt it was.

B0002858YS|5.0|I don't care what anyone else says about this album..... This is the best album I own.....I own 2000 CD's (if you want proof I'll send you a picture of them).  It's a great album from start to finish, hands down a winner!!!!  This is a great addition to anyone's collection.
B0001GF2DS|3.0|The extended version boasts an extra 13 minutes of movie.  After watching the extended version it is clear why the 13 minutes were left out.  In the video extras the editor sheepishly trys to explain his obvious mistake by using Sergio Leone as a scapegoat.  Skip this version and rent the orginal American version instead.

This work is an explosive shot of adrenaline to the veins and brain cells, resulting in skyrocketing emotional uplifts and infinitely thoughtful musings on life and love. Powerful music does indeed become the miracle drug. I'm gonna take another long drag.

ALTHOUGH MOST PEOPLE WILL CONSIDER \\"NIRVANA\\" TO BE THE BIGGEST BAND TO COME OUT OF THE 90'S..MY VOTE GOES TO PEARL JAM. I LIKED KURT COBAIN AND NIRVANA..BUT THEY NEVER TOUCHED ME..THEY NEVER SPOKE FOR  AND WITH ME THE WAY PEARL JAM DID!! SONGS LIKE \\"BLACK(THIS SONG STILL HUNTS ME), ALIVE, EVEN FLOW, GARDEN, ONCE, RELEASE ME(THIS SPOKE FOR SO MANY OF US. HOW MANY TIMES HAVE WE WISHED FOR OUR \\"DEMONS\\" TO RELEASE US?)

0061015725|4.0|Crichton definitely takes a turn, stylistically, in this novel.  Third person, journalistic narratives have been his stock-in-trade up until now, with very little emphasis on characters' thoughts or emotions.  In this story, he experiments, choosing a first-person perspective and a much more humanocentric voice (well, up to the point where people start dying, anyway.)  The results are uneven, but ultimately rewarding.  The intelligent but depressed and obviously emotionally out-of-touch narrator almost gives this the feeling of Crichton writing Chuck Palahniuk.  When he remembers that that's what he's doing, he's surprisingly good at it.  As the action escalates, though, he slips increasingly back into his plainer, more factual style, and the conflict between the two is sometimes a little jarring.  The book feints too far in the direction of being an introspective psychological story before it turns into a thriller.  Neither by themselves is a bad idea, but rammed up against each other, both are weakened. <br /> <br />So why four stars? Well, the idea is cool, the explanations make nanotechnology sound more plausible than i was willing to believe, going in, and with just a *smidgen* of suspension of disbelief, the climax of the book is quite hair-raising.  And some of the ACTUAL PROSE is genuinely excellent, a feat Crichton hasn't achieved since Sphere (my personal vote for his best book, ever.)  The ultimate test: i finished the book in about two days.  Must have been SOMETHING good in there.
140004281X|5.0|I have to admit I was a bit worried that these eight short stories about women may be too oriented toward the female perspective for me to appreciate fully. I am happy to report I was quite mistaken, as author Alice Munro is a gifted writer whose multi-layered writing style can be enjoyed by anyone. And the short story format suits her very well, as she tells amazing stories precisely but without making any compromise in character development or storyline.<br /><br />In the title story, the author describes a young woman's attempt to leave her husband. Things have gone bad for the couple, compounded by the disappearance of their pet goat, Flora, has disappeared. The centerpiece of the collection is a triptych of stories about a woman named Juliet - \\"Chance\\", \\"Soon\\" and \\"Silence\\" - and her relationship with her mother and later with her daughter. \\"Chance\\" takes place in the 1960's and finds Juliet on a train as she unexpectedly discovers love. At the same time, Munro accurately shows Juliet's inner conflict as she hungers for a college education at a time when such notions for opportunity were ridiculed. \\"Soon\\" shows her as a young mother who goes to reconcile with her own parents and her ideas of faith. \\"Silence\\" picks up Juliet's story when she is an older woman estranged from her daughter and wondering what became of her life. The unexpected ending is haunting.<br /><br />The remaining stories highlight aspects of youth both from a young girl's mindset and from the hindsight of an older woman. The best story is perhaps the last, \\"Powers\\", which is divided into titled sections. The first section begins in 1927. The last section, dating in the 1970s, describes a dream of the protagonist. In the dream, Munro writes that the past \\"begins to crumble behind her, to crumble and darken tenderly into something like soot and soft ash.\\" It is this kind of observation that makes the author truly exceptional. She has written a lovely necklace of tales that illuminate human motive and behavior with piercing insight. Munro is a master of the small moment and how each one expands into revelations for which neither her characters nor we ever seem to be prepared. Highly recommended for both genders.motive and behavior with piercing insight.

B0001ZMWQO|4.0|I hate all the indie-rock hype that has sprouted around this band. As someone with a slight aversion to the mainstream, but possessing very eclectic musical tastes, I CAN like poppy, radio-friendly bands like Franz Ferdinand, but they really have to be GOOD.  <br /> <br />Something else I hate is the swarm of indie kids, the emo kids, so-called hip and artsy crop of America today. A.K.A., the ones that hate Franz Ferdinand with a passion, because they have been marketed as the new face of indie, the prodigy of a band that is making indie mainstream. Which is no reason to hate a band.  <br /> <br />The plain and simple truth is that Franz Ferdinand is a sturdy, talented band. It's not exactly artistic sonic experimentation, nor is it the passionate and ragged baring of the lyricist's soul, nor is it of the hazy, underground community that is hardcore indie. Franz Ferdinand makes fun, interesting, unique music that is essentially a mix of good eighties rock, good eighties pop, and the typical modern-day mainstream smashes. I like them. They're original - not as noisy as My Chemical Romance, not as quiet as Keane, or as Wilco can be, and yet not as exasperatingly poppy and cliched as Avril Lavigne can be (who, while talented, is losing herself to the world of celebrity). They remind me a bit of the Smashing Pumpkins, actually. <br /> <br />Not to say that the hype is entirely deserved. The music tends to be repetitive, and fairly cautious. Obviously, FF is still finding its direction. Hopefully the media hype won't stunt that - and hopefully the media hype didn't create it, either. If what can be heard on this album is really FF at work, and not the relentless editing of record-producers, I look forward to hearing what FF comes out with next. It's good stuff. I recommend you give it a try.
B00005JNLY|5.0|This is the best movie of the year. It would be a injustice if you didnt make time to enjoy it.
B000000993|4.0|Maynard's lyrics are really complicated, i think you can find different meanings according to your moment, but it's great to have music like this. <br />Great guitar and bass in all the songs. <br />Favorite tracks: Swamp song and prison sex. <br />These guys really care about their job, they are giving us talent not faces (hello! pop artists)they don't put faces in their videos instead they release very strange, artistic videos with amazing music. <br />You need to be smart to enjoy TOOL, so if you don't like it, take a guess.

B0000028RR|5.0|Incredible debut album from these great musicians. <br />Zack's powerful vocals are great, he wrote amazing lyrics <br />Morello's guitar from hell, Timmy's bass lines are so catchy and Brad's drums are so damn amazing. <br />This is definitly one of the greatest debuts in rock history, it was sure they wouldn't release another perfect album like this. <br />Traks like Freedom, take the power back, Bullet in the head and Bombtrack are classics from the first listening. <br />This is full of 100% attitude, it's a shame bands like Korn and limp biskit got more recognition with his fake \\"bad boys\\" attitude than ratm. <br />I love the cover as well.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|Okay, I will admit that this movie is a bit on the corny side but sometimes, you just need something corny.  Will Ferrell does a bang job with this character - Buddy the Elf.  He is just so nice that you can't HELP but like him.  He only tries to do good and help people but it backfires sometimes and he ends up feeling like he doesn't fit in anywhere.  This is a movie that I could watch every holiday season, right along with Christmas in Connecticut, Love Actually and The Bishop's Wife.  I thought it was delightful and something I could watch with my nephew and not think twice.  Yes, it is corny but it really is funny too and well worth renting!
B00000DHR0|5.0|This is one of my personal favorite seasonal CD's. Celine sings these songs with her usual power and emotion, so that anyone can enjoy them. It's a beautiful collection. I find the greatest song on the album to be \\"Christmas Eve.\\" The rest of it is a fine combination of classic favorites and newer ones that may become classics as well. \\"Feliz Navidad\\" is a fun and refreshing track too. Thumbs up to Celine's contribution to holiday music.
B00000373U|5.0|it makes me sick to turn on the radio, or the tv, and to see the pathetically empty personas that the masses are worshipping as artists. usher? f*$k you, you arrogant, no-talent, self righteous worm. the simpson sisters? need i say more? it's a real wonder that the true artists don't do themselves in more often. just give this album a listen...i mean a REAL listen, with a botle, or a fat line, or 30 minutes of tears, or a shot in the arm, or whatever else you normally save for the quiet times, and really digest this work. if you still come out of it with a healthy respect for people like britney spears and justin timberlake then i don't know what to tell you, except that real art is dying on the vine thanks to clever media manipulations and ignorant, ill-informed gum-munching nitwits who think that revolt means doing exactly what mtv tells them to do. wake up and come to life, before another great artist chooses to do just the opposite. this album is pure gold and then some.

Back here there's nothin'.\\" - John Rambo speaks volumes about some of the lost, misuderstood, burnt-out, underappreciated American Soldiers of the Vietnam War in \\"First Blood\\"<br /><br />After the success of \\"Rocky III\\", in the Summer of 1982, Sylvester Stallone's next film, titled \\"First Blood\\", would introduce the movie going audience with his second trademark character, a Vietnam Veteran turned drifter who pushes back after being pushed too far.<br /><br />\\"First Blood\\" opens with, Vietnam Vet., John Rambo searching for Delmar Barry, a friend of his that served with Rambo in the Special Forces. Rambo finds where Barry was staying and is shocked to find out that his friend died from cancer, contracted from Agent Orange.<br /><br />Shocked at the loss of his friend, alone, & alienated, Rambo walks the cold highway into the local town of \\"Hope\\" to get food & rest. But, not if the local Sheriff, Will Teasle, has his say. Spotting Rambo on the entrance road into town, Teasle stops his cruiser and insists on giving Rambo a ride... to the otherside of town, with the next town being Portland, 30 miles away. Teasle informs Rambo that \\"his kind\\" isn't welcome in town & Teasle's job is to keep it that way.<br /><br />Rambo, tired of this King S*it Cop, decides to walk back into town & promptly arrested for vagrancy & resisting arrest. After more brutality by Teasle's second in command & fellow officers, Rambo has had enough. Taking matters into his own hands, Rambo breaks out of the Sheriff's Station & proceeds to lead a one man war against the local law enforcement & anything that stands in his way.<br /><br />A nice surprise comes over the teletype as Teasle and his men are informed that Rambo served in the Special Forces, Green Beret & has been decorated more times than Teasle's artificial Christmas Tree.<br />\\"Green Berets, their real bada*ses.\\"<br /><br />Teasle leads his men into the mountains to hunt & capture Rambo. But, to Teasle's horror, Rambo takes out each officer, including Teasle.<br /><br />It seems that no man, no law, & no war can stop Rambo, but the tide may turn with the arrival of Colonel Sam Trautman, Rambo's former CO in the war, to talk him down & bring him in.<br />\\"GOD didn't make Rambo. I did.\\"<br /><br />Filmed on location in British Columbia, & Vancouver through November 1981 to January 1982, the production of \\"First Blood\\" was taxing to say the least, especially for star Sylvester Stallone.<br /><br />Stallone wore a tank top throughout much of the film, with the weather being ten to fifteen below zero. The water for the brief shot of Rambo hiding from the National Guard was 39 degrees farenheit (thats coldass water to hide in).<br /><br />The most valuable prop from the film wasn't the Rambo knife used in the film, but, the dirty piece of tarp that Rambo finds in the junkyard and turns into a makeshift poncho. The scene was filmed in one take with Stallone improvising, taking the tarp slashing a hole through the middle of it with his survival knife, putting it ove rhis head, and tying it off with a piece of rope. Direstor, Ted Kotcheff liked the scene so much he kept the scene, but, when the production found out that was the only tarp in the yard, it was up to the propwrangler to keep an eye on the poncho night and day. After the film wrapped Stallone had the tarp framed & resides in his personal collection to this day.<br /><br />Kirk Douglas was originaly going to star in \\"First Blood\\" as Colonel Trautman (there is even conceptual poster art produced, with Stallone & Douglas featured promenantly). But, with a sudden change to the ending of the film, Douglas renigged on the role even after the writers considered his demands. Three days before the film's startdate Richard Crenna signed on & I can't imagine anyone else in the role.<br /><br />This special edition to \\"First Blood\\" is, so far, the definitive version to own (the new \\"Ultimate\\" edition doesn't come close).

B000063DFW|3.0|This kinda SUCKS!!! I give it a 3/5 only because the original hybrid theory songs are good. The new five, minus My December, are stupid songs. I guess High Voltage isn't all that bad, but it still isn't up to what you would expect from Linkin Park. Meteora and Hybrid Thoery are among the best and most original albums out there, but you can just buy Live In Texas to get the live songs and you can get My December from an import or something. High Voltage isn't even worth it. Don't waste your money, because it would actually be cheaper to don't it how I just told you. It's cheaper and you get more songs out of the whole deal. Listen to me on this one 'cause I'm a Linkin Park nut and I have been following them since they started. They have been doing great except for this little mistake here (there new book kicks a**!!!). <br /> <br />Peace ya'll. I'm Out. Linkin Park Kicks MAjor *** Baby!!!!!!
B000679N96|4.0|Finally!  Time to rediscover The Cure.  I can't wait for the future remasters.  This album is not my favorite but it has some excellent songs.  The remaster sounds good and crisp.    One note...Fans will always complain.  When \\"Join the Dots\\" came out I read people making comments such as \\"Where are the songs like 'I Want to Be Old'?\\"  Well, here they are.  Now the reviewer below is saying \\"Where is 'See the Children'?\\"  Frankly, I've never even heard of this track before.  Anyone who complains at this point is being ungrateful and intentionally obscure, in my opinion.    The Cure have reached into the vaults and are beginning to deliver the goods.  I'm glad to be fan.    I believe they must have different versions of some of these songs.  The version of \\"Faded Smiles\\" floating around on the Internet, described as an \\"Easy Cure demo,\\" does not have the echo effect on the voice that the version on this disc has.    And, although someone who still has the vinyl will have to verify, I think the performance of \\"World War\\" might be different as well.    As to there being too many versions of songs we already have, I have to say that the home demo of \\"10:15\\" is very unique, and the studio demo of \\"Boys Don't Cry\\" is better than the official version in my opinion.    Oh, and if you have the original CD, save it...There are a few seconds of talking and laughter at the beginning of \\"The Weedy Burton\\" which have been cut out in the remaster.    PS.  Question for the intentionally obscure reviewer:  Can I get some copies of your bootlegs?  Thanks.
B000660UN0|5.0|Eric had released &#34;Me and Mr. Johnson&#34; only six months earlier.  It was o.k., but there wasn't anything particularly compelling about it.  Some songs were good, a continuation of the blues material he had previously released on &#34;Behind the Cradle&#34;, only this time the focus was exclusively on Robert Johnson, but a few cuts were lackluster walk-throughs.  In addition, the performances were entirely electric, full band efforts which was part of the reason for disappointment.  Eric was too comfortable hiding behind a full band set-up.  For anyone who has really &#34;gotten it&#34; in terms of what Robert Johnson was all about, acoustic seems the way to go - you want to get to the heart of it all - you just can't hide if it's only you and the guitar.  Peter Green made the same misstep a few years ago with his own Robert Johnson compilation.  It too was primarily a full band set up. But, what you really hoped for was an unplugged session with just one guy and his guitar - something that Robert Johnson was able to pull off in the 1930's, but something that wealthy white rockers nurtured on stadium rock don't seem to be comfortable with.  Robert, after all, performed face-to-face with small house party audiences - obviously he had to bare it all night after night...  Eric and Peter had gotten too comfortable with huge stadiums.  Still... you have this hope that guys as talented as Peter Green and Eric Clapton have it in them somewhere and you just need to get them to take the chance.  Is it possible?<br /><br />This latest release by Clapton (&#34;Sessions for Robert J.&#34;) continues to be exclusively about Robert Johnson songs.  Yes, many of the songs are duplicated on the two CD releases (&#34;Me and Mr. Johnson&#34; and &#34;Sessions for Robert J&#34;), but each performance is different on the respective albums.  In fact, &#34;Sessions for Robert J.&#34; actually contains two different versions of &#34;Hell Hound on my Trail&#34; and &#34;Love in Vain&#34; (yet a third version of &#34;Love in Vain&#34; was originally released on &#34;Me and Mister Johnson&#34; so that there are now three completely different versions available).<br /><br />O.K. so how is the new &#34;Sessions for Robert J.&#34;?<br /><br />In a word - &#34;STUNNING!&#34;<br /><br />This is all that one could hope for and more since it is all on DVD in 5.1 Surround Sound.  This album is quite a bit better than &#34;From the Cradle&#34;.  Watching Eric actually perform these songs on the TV screen is a revelation.  And yes, some of it is just Eric and his guitar!  But perhaps the best is the session where Eric plays with just one other guitar player - Doyle Bramlett.  It is truly entertaining to watch these guys stay in step with each other on these technically difficult songs - If you have ever learned to play some of these songs in slide guitar you would know these are tough enough to just play solo!<br /><br />About half of the songs are with a full band and regardless of what was said above, these are great!  Yes, acoustic versions would be nice (and you can choose between electric and acoustic for &#34;Hell Hound on My Trail&#34;), but the full band approach on &#34;Sessions for Robert J.&#34; does not disappoint at all!  Eric pulls it off and really throws his heart into the performances - no &#34;walk through&#34; performances here!  This is where &#34;Sessions&#34; outperforms the earlier &#34;Me and Mister Johnson&#34;.  There is energy on &#34;Sessions&#34; whereas &#34;Me and Mister Johnson&#34; seems more workman like. And one could safely hazard a guess to say that perhaps Eric felt the same way.  After all, you have to wonder why he chose to release a second Robert Johnson album (with a huge duplication of song titles) inside of six months if he was really happy with the first effort?  Well, whatever the reason, this album is great!<br /><br />Some favorite songs on &#34;Sessions&#34;:<br /><br />&#34;Terraplane Blues&#34; - Eric and Doyle run through this song like a sharp knife through watermelon - they absolutely nail it!  Worth the price of this set just to have this one song!  Historical note: this song was actually performed by Eric in the same Dallas Texas hotel third floor where Johnson originally recorded it in the 1930's!  In any case, Eric's vocal is simply amazing!  Wow!  There is a live version of Eric doing this same song solo in 1994 (a very rare performance caught on a bootleg tape - did he ever even perform it again in concert during that tour?) - it was really good and now we have the same song in much better fidelity and an even better performance!  Yes, yes - thank you, thank you, thank you!!!<br /><br />&#34;Rambling on my Mind&#34; & &#34;Stones In My Passway&#34; - Eric performing acoustic solo.  These are basically the way one might have thought it should be done, one man with one guitar - Peter Green please take note!<br /><br />&#34;Milk Cow Blues&#34;, &#34;Traveling Riverside Blues&#34; & &#34;If I had Possession Over Judgment Day&#34; - Eric with the full band.  These rock!  Very intense and meant to be played loud.  Sounds great on 5.1 DTS.<br /><br />By the way, the least favorite song is &#34;They're Red Hot&#34; - an atypical song in the Johnson cannon, but Eric's version comes off as better than Robert Johnson's original!  And even though it's too &#34;happy&#34; for a blues album, it does sound good here!<br /><br />Having said all this, we have to realize that listening to the original 1930's Robert Johnson songs on scratchy old 78s is an acquired taste for some, but this is probably because few people today are willing to listen to low-fidelity recordings.  Please note that the latest releases of the original &#34;King of The Delta Blues&#34; (volume 1 and volume 2) have been remastered (yes, I know - how many times do they need to endlessly remaster this stuff?) and this time on some tracks the vocals and bass have a clarity and presence that far exceeds both the two Columbia box set releases and even the Gold disc.  A lot of the hardness in Robert's voice remains on a few tracks, but often it has been toned down a bit in the latest transfers and the bass is much higher in the mix - overall, I think it just sounds better now even if the hiss and ticks and pops are now actually more pronounced - less digital noise reduction seems to result in better fidelity here.  In any case, try these most recent remasters if you had a problem with the sound quality of the sterilizing noise reduction used on the Columbia box set (which was re-remastered a second time around 1996 when the smaller box was issued - stay away from the original long box issued in 1991 which now has the worst sound available).  I have learned to play several Robert Johnson songs on slide guitar and through that experience found genius not just in his execution, which of course is perfect, but also in Robert's arrangements.  The simple truth is that Robert Johnson with his limited resources (poor Black man in the 1930's in the deep South) was perhaps an even a more naturally gifted musician than Eric Clapton - if that is even possible!  This assessment is reinforced by Eric himself in the section in the DVD where he discusses how hard it is for him to sing in a different tempo than the guitar as Robert often effortlessly does.  So take it from there...<br /><br />By the way, if you go directly to the various sessions in the DVD you will miss the mini-interviews with Eric.  You have to click on &#34;play all&#34; to get the entire presentation.  I had been just clicking on the individual sessions thereby missing the interviews until I found them accidentally.<br /><br />Please note that the companion CD is missing something like half of the performances included in the DVD!  My solution was to make my own compilation direct from the DVD with ALL the songs - it will fit nicely on one 80 minute CD-R.<br /><br />Bottom line, Eric finally does justice to his blues influences (this is even better than &#34;From the Cradle&#34;) and created yet another classic in the process.a few tracks, but often it has been toned down a bit in the latest transfers and the bass is much higher in the mix - overall, I think it just sounds better now even if the hiss and ticks and pops are now actually more pronounced - less digital noise reduction seems to result in better fidelity here.

B0002Y4T92|4.0|As a fundraiser for his subatnce abuse clinic, this festival will hopefully raise a lot of money and awareness, whether you play or not. As a guitarist, what is assembled here is simply a master class of some of the greatest living guitarists (well, ZZ Top excluded) extremely well photographed and often quite intelligently commenting on what it is about their craft that compels them to play. <br />And it is a GREAT show. The sound is terrific in 5.1, and the pace is brilliantly executed. The intersecting of various parts of the festival in a non-linear mode enhances the interest visually and musically. The different stages, the times of day, the sizes of the audiences, all change enough that you have a more compelling document, and it is not so cliched in building to an inevitable conclusion. <br />Through out the film, Clapton is positively sublime, whether as sideman in support, or taking the lead. It is not a film about him, though, and it is a credit to his integrity that he keeps the focus on the diversity. You're not likely to appreciate each and every artist, but that's what makes the film so great. <br />This is a terrific Christmas present for the six stringer in your home. You could never pay for the lessons imparted here.
B00009TB5G|4.0|I am not the biggest fan in the world of Lord of the Rings - it's a bit over dramatic and heavy handed at times, but they are still great movies. It is certainly worth owning all of the extended versions of this trilogy- even if you have the theatrical already, if you don't just buy the extended version. It is not a waste and you will watch it more than once. There's a lot of crap movies out there and this certainly is not.
B000660UN0|5.0|Clapton has emerged, particularly since McCartney's CONCERT FOR NY, and the TRIBUTE TO GEORGE as a statesman of incomparable dignity, sublime in both the finesse and creativity that he brings to efforts whose subjects he deeply respects. It is no less the case with his most recent releases, be the homages to B B King, George, his own tours, an incredible guitar festival, and now Robert Johnson. The CD is excellent - some additional material and different takes on the ME AND MR JOHNSON release, an extraordinary document in its own right.  <br />But what takes this to an entirely different level is the DVD. A mix of recording sessions in interesting locations (Clapton's English countryside, Johnson's former recording studio) and Clapton's reflections on his approach to Johnson and his myth, most of which Eric is keen to debunk, having been the victim of enough myths to rewrite Homer himself. <br />And it is just this effort of his to get to the music as he feels it and not take any of the side show for more than that that gets inside of you. You are not going to hear Robert Johnson completely re-worked. You're going to hear his tunes really honsetly delivered. There is a sublime beauty to that that just takes you to that very special place where MUSIC leans over and brings you into its confidence. And that seems to be the point for Clapton: to get inside that confidence in order to honour a man whose dedication and discipline inspired a poor English kid years ago to reach down deep. <br />And on both the CD and the DVD, the music is without peer. As I say, Clapton at this point in his career has acheived a level of dignity that is to be admired.
B00003CX9S|5.0|It's hard to know how much is to be credited to Hurt's acting, and how much to Tucker and co.'s make-up. Either way, it's the best acting/make-up combination I've seen (to my memory,there may be others). Hurt's expressions had to be impeccable to penetrate the heavy-duty make-up, and the make-up had to be impeccable to allow the actor's expressions to actually come across on film.<br />The suspense build-up to the revealing the full extent of Elephant Man's deformity, is brilliant. Some films are anti-climactic, and others drag the suspense card out so long that you just don't care anymore. This one? Perfection! The actor involved in the revealing scene was nothing short of utterly convincing. And the drama surrounding the circumstance that allowed for that unfortunate incident, was written and acted with depth and class.<br />The only point that could have any possibility of preventing my 5*ing this film, is that it doesn't provide insight into how Elephant Man achieves his well-adjustedness to his circumstances. I'd like there to have been at least one scene addressing the source of his strength. But, it is still touching, the courage of his coping and grace.<br />Hopkins is revered for his role as Hannibal Lector in Silence of the Lambs. And fairly so. But his role in this is my favourite. His representation of this man of compassion and dedication, is powerful. The spirit of helping someone without need of reason, is embodied perfectly. As is the character's self-doubt as to his own motives. And the writers deserve their due for this. The writing is as good as film-writing gets.The directing is so smooth and on the spot with everything. The directing drags the full effect from every scene that could be salvaged. The hostility and exploitive opportunism is excellently portrayed by the actors filling the roles. The incidental actors responding to Elephant Man in all the many different ways, fulfill their roles with equal prowess to the main actors.<br />Due to a mass quick-thrill neccessity in society, this is not a movie that jumps out as a great film of all time. It has brilliance that requires an audience member to be inward searching and morally aware.neccessity in society, this is not a movie that jumps out as a great film of all time.

B0002XDODU|3.0|I got into Rammstein a while back, and I've been obsessed with them since. This album is kind of a dissapointment however. I had hopes of this being better than the previous albums (if that's possible) and my hopes were shattered. This is the weakest release to date, and it is the worst CD so far. However, it still has a few good tracks and it's still worth buying if you're really into Rammstein. One big problem, the music seems much to calm compared to the previous CD's. Even the slower tracks on here don't work well.  After listening to this, I just expect more. Buy it if you're a diehard fan, otherwise just wait for the next one.
B00005JMAH|5.0|A great movie!!!  My daughter is a huge fan of Harry Potter movies.  She is only 6 and has enjoyed them all.  I wouldn't have let her watch them if I thought she was getting scared, but she did great and wasn't scared one bit.  I do wish they would have explained who \\"Mooney, Wormtail, Padfood and Prongs\\" were, then movie goers would have understood why Harry's patronus appeared as a stag (\\"Prongs\\" was Harry's dad, of course, the silver stag).  I thought that was a really important piece of the story that was left out.
B0002TT0NW|4.0|While this was my favorite book of the series, it was my least favorite movie. I understand the  movies are getting darker as Harry grows older, as do the books ,but I think the director made a mistake in making it as scary as a \\"Halloween\\" or \\"freddie kruger\\" type horror movie! They have to realize the main audience of this series are children! My 8 year old son LOVES (I should say loved) HP and could not WAIT to see the movie. Well, all I can say is he was TERRIFIED and had nightmares for over a month after seeing it. It was awful. He HATED it and cried and cried to me and said, \\"mommy, why would they make a movie for kids so scary?\\"  <br /> <br />I wonder the same thing myself. There was absolutely NO reason to make the werewolf scene as graphic and scary as it was. None.  The dementors did not scare him, even though they are actually much scarier in theory. The werewolf could have been handled the same way, kind of veiled and hinted at rather than full-blown special effects that would rival any hollywood horror flick.  <br /> <br />Aside from it being way too scary for kids under 13 or 14, I took issue with the huge plot changes.  The director may not have liked where chris columbus placed hagrid's hut and the whomping willow, but how can he just completely change the set and not think we will notice? Not that the new set was BAD, it just was completely different from the first, and kind of insulting to the audience, like we are too stupid to remember that hagrid's hut was never down a steep slope near a lake.  <br /> <br />The other issue I felt was huge was the maurader's map plot not being at least explained a little. The fact that harry's dad made the map with his best friends lupin, pettigrew and black, and that they were all animagi was an integral part of the story. If you don't understand that,how can you know that harry's dad really was the stag that saved him from the dementors? If you didnt' read the book you would not truly understand the movie.  <br/> <br />So, while it would be ok as a stand alone movie, I think it fell short of the goal, which is being a cohesive stepping stone in a series. Too much was changed and left out. Plus, it will scare the living daylights out of any child under 13.  <br />Parents be warned!
B00005JMJ4|4.0|I first saw this movie in a hotel room with my friend, and I could hardly keep from crying. \\"Lost in Translation\\" is quiet, graceful, and would be moving to anyone who takes the time to sit and watch it.

B0006399FS|5.0|I am a long-time U2 fan,  first album bought was War when it first came out.   <br /> <br />Given all the reviews here both positive and negative, I rate this album in the top 3.   <br />This is a much better album than the last album \\"All You Can Leave Behind\\".    <br /> <br />This is the order of my rating of the albums to date: <br /> <br />1.  Achtung Baby <br />2.  The Unforgettable Fire <br />3.  How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb <br />4.  Joshua Tree <br />5.  Zooropa <br />6.  War <br />7.  All That You Can't Leave Behind <br />7.  Boy <br />8.  October <br />9.  Pop <br />10.  Rattle and Hum <br /> <br />We all can argue that one album better than the other for many reasons.   But we can all say that U2 has staying power.     <br /> <br />It is really nice to see an album like this comes out while having to put up with all that rap crap and bubblegum goo!  :-)
B00005B4GU|5.0|Actually its 4 and a half, but it was closer to 5, than 4, so i rated it 5. This album is just great. Every Radiohead album, in my opinion, is great (maybe except PH). This album and KID A just shows that Radiohead can do more than play fantastic Rock music. Buy It. Buy all Radiohead albums.  <br />The highlights on this album is: <br />2 Pyramid Song <br />4 You and Whose Army <br />5 I Might be Wrong <br />6 Knives Out <br />7 Morning Bell/Amnesiac <br /> <br />But the others is fantastic too. Dont miss Radiohead. NEEEVEEEEER!!!!
B0002ZDVEU|4.0|The spy thriller is very alive and well in \\"The Bourne Supremacy\\", one of the most entertaining and well-crafted movies of 2004. It's a sequel to 2002's \\"The Bourne Identity\\". In many ways it surpasses the original. <br /> <br />The movie, which has a sweeping panorama of international locales, opens in India, where Jason Bourne [Matt Damon] is living with his lover, Marie [Franka Potente]. He still has amnesia, but is often awakened by nightmares about his past as a CIA agent. Meanwhile, a CIA agent is killed in Berlin. One clue is left behind by the killer - a finger print belonging to Bourne. How can this be? Bourne was 4000 miles away. Soon, Bourne is caught up in a conspiracy full of deception and dead bodies.  <br /> <br />Damon is again perfect as Bourne. His performance is central to the success of the movie. His is essentially a despicable character [at least as far as we know] but he makes us feel a great deal of empathy for Bourne. He is ably supported by two great actors, Joan Allen and Brian Cox, who play CIA agents out to get him. <br /> <br />The drama side of \\"The Bourne Supremacy\\" is balanced by a great deal of satisfying action. For example, a car chase through the streets of Moscow that ranks as one of the most exciting ever made.   <br />

B00004C8TC|5.0|I got this CD for Grieg's Piano Concerto, one of my most favorite piano concertos of all.  As much as I like it, this concerto can sound very cheap in a mediocre performance.  I've got a couple other CDs before this one, and I have to say Lupu's performance is literally *magnificient* compared to others.  I think the word magnificient is the most suitable for describing the excellence of Lupu and Previn's performance here. <br /> <br />The recording is superb, too.  I come back to this one from time to time even though I must've listened to it hundreds of times, and every time I get impressed.
1592400876|5.0|\\"Eats, Shoots & Leaves,\\" by Lynne Truss, is my kind of book.  I have always loved grammar and I frequently agonize over the proper use of punctuation in my writing.  Truss's book is all about punctuation, its use and abuse.  She also provides some enjoyable tidbits about the history of punctuation marks and how the use of punctuation is changing because of such modern phenomena as emailing and text messaging.<br /><br />Poor punctuation is the result of ignorance, laziness, and indifference.  Truss peppers her book with amusing examples of how incorrect punctuation can change the meaning of a sentence.  She also reveals that Gertrude Stein abhorred punctuation marks, Emily Dickinson was in love with the dash, and Virginia Woolf had a thing for semicolons.  No matter how one feels about individual punctuation marks, a good writer must learn the proper use of commas, quotation marks, apostrophes, parentheses, and ellipses.  Poorly placed punctuation marks often lead to unintentionally hilarious writing that brands the author as careless or, worse, an ignoramus.  Properly placed punctuation marks help the writer to communicate his message to the reader unambiguously.<br /><br />Why is Truss's book such a sensation?  One reason is that it's immensely entertaining.  Truss uses sarcasm, hyperbole, and wicked wit to make her case for accurate punctuation.  Another reason for the book's popularity is that Truss is standing up for old-fashioned correctness, and that is a novelty in itself.  We are living in an age of \\"anything goes.\\"  Standards of dress, speech, decorum, and behavior are all being thrown out the window.  It is comforting to know that there are people like Lynne Truss at the ramparts, battling for the cause of proper punctuation usage at a time when few people care about the niceties of language at all.  Hooray for Lynne Truss!  She's my hero.

6305971153|5.0|After seeing this movie when I was little, I instantaly loved it! A 23 year old in college who now officially owns the movie on DVD still brings me tears of joy by watching a film by Jeannot Szwarc. This movie is divided into two parts, the origins about a carpenter of toys became the worlds greatest joy to children and the counterfit who wants to take over Santa's job the ruthless B.Z..but eventually deafeated by two wonderful children (Joe and Corniella) with a little help with good ole Claus and Patch...don't forget the reindeer...Director Szwarc, really brought the film alive by using simple methods on making a film..I know he cares for his crew and cast members by not sending out into harsh working conditions and not spending a great deal of money by going to NYC or other places around the world. Even though NYC looks very real in movie. In the movie we see people who really cares for each other and remain loyal to their friends even in the time of trouble. Every one in the film did an excellent job...5 stars+...MAD PROPS!!!
B00001U0DP|5.0|I had to watch this movie for a film class and glad I did.  I only saw it one time.  My inital thought is that this movie will make you really happy and really sad.  I was emmotionally connected the whole time and I remember many scenes after watching it.
B000002U82|5.0|This is one of those albums that isn't just a collection of hit songs, but an artistically visioned concept album that is able to create a storyline lyrically and musically. Side one seems to take four songs to establish the fear of death.  It starts with a heartbeat, which I interperate as a sign of life.  Once physical life is established, they kick into this person's synical view on life, which is that you live to die and life is nothing but work and misery, until they decide to break free of the vicious cycle and become on the run, but after time passes they end up in the great gig in the sky.  The fear of death is just one problem. Side two seems to brings more to this troubled character, with aspects like greed, war and any problem you have with the world, and with all these problems, one just goes insane, but eventually everything makes sense.  Everything is O.K., even though you fear death, or are overcome by greed and war, if you accept. <br />As for the music, no less impressive.  \\"Breathe\\" is an awesome song with a great distorted guitar and relaxing nature.  \\"On the Run\\" is one of the greatest musical representations and a cool song on the side.  \\"Time\\" is epic, with one of the greatest intro's ever, and just plain rocks.  \\"The Great Gig in the \\"Sky\\" is an instrumental with so much emotion in the piano and vocals that your own emotions seem to go with it.  \\"Money\\" is a psychedelic masterpiece with a classic bass beginning, blues singing and a great jam session.  \\"Us and Them\\" is another mello masterpiece.  It's the kind of music that makes you want to lay down and sleep but not in a bad way.  \\"Any Colour You Like\\" is a cool song with great bluse guitar.  \\"Brain Damage\\" is a great picture of insanity, and \\"Eclipse\\" is a great, energetic song that puts you back into an exciting mood, after from \\"Breathe\\" you had been melloed out.  All in all, why don't you already own this?
B000066744|4.0|I liked it enough to buy it after seeing it.  Visually and audibly great.  Im not sure many people you show it too would be impressed unless you are not 26 years old like me.  The end has poor sound quality.
B000002JR8|5.0|This CD is one of Pantera's best. I still can't believe that Dimebag Darrel has left us. He was possibly the best thing that ever happened to heavy metal. I just wish this could have been prevented. Pantera was one of my favorite bands & it was a bummer enough when I found out that they broke up. I just want to thank all the members from Pantera for making some of the best metal ever & that Dime will never be forgotten.
B0002S947K|5.0|There are few songs let alone albums, that can impact someones life, but Ray has done it with such simple beauty one cannot help but envy his music's presence.

B0002IVN9W|5.0|postmodern: of, relating to, or being any of several movements (as in art, architecture, or literature) that are reactions against the philosophy and practices of modern movements and are typically marked by revival of traditional elements and techniques. <br /> <br />The above is one of the simpler definitions I've ever seen of postmodernism, but it captures the essential ironic and reactive nature of the term.  Most contemporary art, whether we like it or not, is postmodern. It mines well understood conventions often functioning through inversion, sarcasm, cynicism, or some other reference.  <br /> <br />What does this have to do with The Arcade Fire?  In my opinion, Funeral is one of the first albulms to, at last, transcend the 30-year milieu of postmodernism. The music truly means something. It is not a pastiche of what has come before us. Nor is it brimming with jaded witticisms. Rather, the albulm is emotional, touching, startlingly intelligent.   <br /> <br />In my mind, it is a landmark.  But perhaps I'm overstating the case?  I like the record. It makes me happy. It will make you happy if you give it a chance.
B0002ZMJ5M|4.0|...than the remakes of classic cuts (such as \\"A Christmas Song\\"), but I guess Ian had to include them but didn't want to sell us the original versions we already had somewhere else in our collections. But the man does say it himself in the liner notes; if you liked Tull's \\"modern madrigal\\" period where he gave us \\"Songs From the Wood\\", you'll like this one. Anderson's biggest obstacle to overcome is one that all rock artists have always had to face when tackling a Christmas album. With apologies to Brenda Lee (who I had a star-crush on when we were both teenagers), rock and Christmas have never been a natural mix. Somehow, the cynicism of rock and the upbeat nature of the Holidays don't blend well. You can spot that penomenon on the grassroots fan level in one earlier review which calls most Christmas music \\"fluff\\", hinting broadly at the \\"c\\" word used often at Christmastime by petit-Marxists who forget that they owe their standard of living to the free enterprise system, i.e. \\"commercialism\\". But it's always been a mistake to let the fact that Ian Anderson has always been a bit of an ideologue make you forget that he's one hell of a musician. And this album only goes to prove it. His playing and compositional skills only get better with age, and his baritone wears well with age. Robert Goulet once said that in that fact lies the main advantage of being a baritone. So Ian can't snap or snarl the words like he did back in the \\"Aqualung\\" days. It would be a shame to lose him to some \\"day job\\" as has been the case with artists who were dependent on youthful range.
0893860220|5.0|When a friend first recommended this book I was not ready to read it. <br />I had read so much in this area I couldn't handle  picking up another book <br />that supposedly pointed the way to \\"reality\\".  <br />I was a tired \\"seeker\\". <br />Then 2 years later in a used book store I saw a copy with an inscription to <br />someone with the same first name as I. I took that as sign and bought the book. <br />From the first page the book spoke to me like no other I have read. <br />It speaks directly to the part of you \\"that knows\\". <br />Get it!  <br />Warning: Only read if you prepared to give up the notion that you are a  <br />seperate individual with a name and address with your own little story. <br />Give up your little story and become connected to the \\"really big story\\" as <br />Ed Sullivan would say. <br />For those to young to remember Ed Sullivan used to introduce this variety <br />show every Sunday night by saying \\"We have a really big show tonight\\".
079072961X|5.0|When I was a kid I liked to watch \\"The Fugitive\\" episodes on TV.  It offered a unique scenario; an (innocent) escaped convict running from a persistent lawman goes from town to town meeting different people with different problems, challenges, asperations, etc.  By the time things are resolved in each episode, Inspector Girard is just close enough for Richard Kimble to flee to a new locale for a new episode.  The possibilities were endless because there were only two characters that were repeaters from one episode to the next.   <br /> <br />In the movie, this aspect was lost but, in its' place, a more exciting set of circumstances were explored.  The TV version of Richard Kimble was always looking for \\"the one-armed man\\" (OK, I guess there were THREE characters that appeared in some or all of the episodes).  However, he never got close enough until the end.  In the movie version, Dr. Richard Kimble is a man possessed and the innocent bystanders were incidental to the pursuit of finding the real killer.  Jettison the human interest stories and focus on the chasee being the chaser and we've got a real action movie.   <br /> <br />There is nary a dull moment throughout \\"The Fugitive\\" all of which is aided by a superb cast.  Tommy Lee Jones deservingly won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor in his role as the Marshall in pursuit.  Harrison Ford produces his customary above average performance and a number of other characters add a lot as well.  The aura of suspense coupled with the search to solve a mystery leads to a great climax.   <br /> <br />This is one of those movies you stick with when channel surfing.  As good as the TV version was, I recall that I listened to a Twins game the night of the final episode.  Fortunately the scoreboard announced the outcome of the final episode (as well as the game) and the sportcasters relayed it to us listeners.  I think I would opt for the movie over the baseball game if the choice ever comes up.
B00000F169|4.0|I first saw Dark Star when it was released and immediately loved it, even though it spoofs 'serious' films I also loved, particularly  Kubrick/Clarke's 2001.   It was with glee that I found this CD, at the bargain price of $10.  Admittedly, the production is a bit rough, and the original film shows its student budget, but that is somehow fitting to the film.  My only complaint is that they did not include the short \\"Hardware Wars\\" (a spoof of Star Wars, featuring an intergalactic steam iron and the heroic Fluke Starbucker, if I recollect correctly), which toured with Dark Star after HW's release in 1977; it made an inspired pairing. Oh well, I guess that 13 minutes of hilarity is available on its own DVD.

The White Album is one of the most interesting projects in the final stage of the band, and, if you take away silly songs like Obladi Oblada, the albums remain quite compact. An important item for a Beatles fan.
B0002EXH54|5.0|Dave did a great job on this one.. no big changes to the songs but they sound awesome <br /> <br />1 - Wake Up Dead - 10/10 Great Opener <br />2 - The Conjuring -9.4/10 - i always thought this was a cool song <br />3 - Peace Sells - 10/10 - Classic metal and megadeth song <br />4 - Devils Island - 9/10 - A classic in its own right, somewhat catchy <br />5 - Black Friday - 10/10 - Starts out really slow... goes mid-tempo at the 'Black Friday' part, then turns into a totally brutal thrash song.. if you can wait until the second half of this song, the energy and brutality is amazing. <br />6 - Bad Omen -8/10 - Starts off okay, the ending is better, though <br />7 - I Aint supersticious - 9/10 - I know some people dont like this song but it helps add variety to album, cool cover song <br />8 - My Last Words - 9/10 -great closer
B0000CABBW|4.0|This film is worth seeing. I cried on and off almost from beginning to end. Very touching story although a little slow.
B0002EXH5O|5.0|This album is phenomenal.. MegaDeth's rust in peace is their highest point, a true thrash/speed metal classic <br /> <br />1 - Holy Wars -10/10- The third Deth song i heard, its simply amazing.. probably one of my favorite songs of all time, the climatic ending is great (and Daves guitar solo is awesome) a true 10/10 song <br /> <br />2 - Hangar 18 -10/10- The slowest tempo song on the album, but still a classic megadeth tune, theres like 11 guitar solos, too.. its great <br /> <br />3 - Take no prisoners -10/10- three of my favorite metal songs in a row.. this is a great song, too. yes, the remaster has redone vocals, but they arent that bad, its not like daves voice has really changed <br /> <br />4 - Five Magics -9/10- a solid song, intro is a bit long though <br /> <br />5 - Poison was the cure -9/10-a fast, brutal thrash song <br /> <br />6 - Lucretia -9/10- cool rhythm.. not much to say about it <br /> <br />7 - Tornado of Souls -10/10- great song <br /> <br />8 - Dawn Patrol -NA/10- Basically a bass solo (with lyrics, though) and interlude to the next song, still good though. i dont see why people dont like it, helps even the flow to the end of the album <br /> <br />9 - Rust in Peace.. Polaris -10/10- its a great closer to the album <br /> <br />EXTRA TRACKS: <br /> <br />10:My Creation - Its cool to have a new song, but its nothing special, 6/10 <br /> <br />11:Rust in Peace - Just a demo with different vocals <br /> <br />12: Holy Wars: 10/10 - Wow, rust in peace probably has the best demos just because of the last 2 tracks.. this one features chris poland on guitar, the balance is a bit off, but it sounds faster, (Dave says it is in the booklet, too, but probably sounds that way because of weak production) more natural sounding, still almost as good as the original <br /> <br />13: Take no Prisoners - 10/10 - Better than the original on the cd? sort of.. for those who complained about new vocals, this one has older ones (not the original though) and has amore natural, reverbed tone, and chris on guitar again <br /> <br /> <br />I recommend this to any fan of Metal, its an amazing album
B00005JMAH|4.0|#3 is my favorite of the Harry Potter series so far. Special effects were fun. More artistic and more dramatic than the other two. Looking forward to #4, which should proove to be better than 1-3 with special effects and story.
B000002U82|5.0|I had never listened to Pink Floyd before (although I had heard of them) and thought that they were just another one of those old-timer rock groups. Well, they are, but after a friend's dad chucked this album in the CD player one summer's night down at the shack I discovered the magic that is the Dark Side of the Moon. This is without a doubt THE BEST album I have ever heard (and this is coming from someone who mainly listens to hip-hop). <br /> <br />When you listen to this album you will notice that Pink Floyd are not your average rock group. For a start this album is VERY chilled and mellow, ideal for relaxing on a late night under the stars. The next thing that you'll notice once you hear tracks like \\"On the Run\\" and \\"Time\\" is that this album is very experimental, which makes it a very interesting listen.  <br /> <br />The whole album flows like 1 great long track, the songs intertwining together to form a timeless masterpiece. EVERY track is both musically amazing and carries and progresses the album's dark theme, which it maintains magically throughout. It is this theme, this feeling, this mood, that makes the album so incredible. It is like a dark journey through time that can be intriguing (\\"On the Run\\"), exhilerating (\\"Money\\"), and relaxed (\\"Us and Them\\"), but flows SEAMLESSLY.  <br /> <br />Musically the album is superb, I love the experimentation, guitar riffs, and most of all, the saxophone solos. Pink Floyd use a range of \\"weird\\" sounds such as money clinking, cash registers closing, clocks ticking and chiming, and strange keyboard noises to craft the unique sound of the album. It truly is a masterpiece. My favourite tracks would have to be \\"Time\\" and \\"Money\\", but really you have to listen to the album in its entirety (and @ 40mins it's the perfect length; not too short to disappoint, but not too long to drag on), to fully appreciate its magic. <br /> <br />Well, I could keep writing forever about how great this CD is but the only way for you to understand it is to experience it for yourselves. I would recommend this CD to ALL MUSIC LOVERS; great music is always a pleasure to listen to no matter what the genre (provided it is listened to in the right circumstances: for example, you wouldn't skateboard to this, its to chill to). In fact, I would say this is ESSENTIAL LISTENING to all people who call themselves music lovers, this is one of those CDs that will remain timeless and be listened to by generations to come. Peace out.   <br />
B00030590I|4.0|Nameless, a county-prefect-turns-swordsman (Jet Li), goes to the King of Qin (Chen Daoming) claiming he has killed three of the king's greatest arch-enemies, the assassins named Sky (Donnie Yen), Flying Snow (Maggie Cheung) and Broken Sword (Tony Leung).  With the presentation of each dead assassin's weapons he is allowed to inch closer to the king by 20 paces, as he answers the King's questions about how each assassin came to be killed.  The King surmises otherwise...With a storyline reminiscent in structure to Rashomon (though lacking the latter's emotional resonance) Zhang's epic martial arts movie is wonderful to behold, a stunning excuse to put in some really superlative action choreography, hails of shafts, and rolling fabrics of color which will no doubt please fans of the action (ie. The Matrix) genre.  One scene has Li and Leung dueling gracefully on the waters over a backdrop of ravishing landscape tinted blue and green by Doyle's outstanding photography, and as the movie puts it, the presentation is as pictorial as a scroll of sumptuous calligraphy.  The sleek tale is too slim to carry any character development, and presents itself for better or for worse as a streamlined allegory.  Though Li and Chen are the main protagonists, Leung and Cheung undoubtedly steal the show, as a pair of fellow assassins and lovers, only they lend the movie the proper emotional weight in an otherwise supremely handsome, if tenuously scripted, film.  A bonus is in the film's soundtrack: Tan Dun's score, as ever, is superb.    P.S. The two characters Broken Sword scribbled in the sands could be better translated as \\"All under Heaven\\" (ie. every human life under Heaven) rather than \\"Our Lands\\" as given by the Miramax version; not only is it a more *literal* translation, it also corrects the political bias provided that the Miramax subtitles, which lead to so much misunderstanding of the film's ending.
B00030590I|2.0|Jet Li - HERO!<br />When you see a title like that, the first thoughts that come to your mind are probably 'Neat,' 'Interesting,' 'Action!' 'Fighting!' and 'I want to see that!' - probably not 'Boring.' But that, I'm afraid, is what it is.<br />Don't get me wrong, the visuals are stunning, and some of the fight scenes quite entertaining.<br /><br />The plot, however, I could not sync with.<br />I understand there are some layers to the story, but it's basically this man (Jet Li) sitting before a throne, telling the king of his victories - how he defeated the 3 assassins. He tells one story. The king doesn't believe him. The king tells what he thinks happens. He gets it right, except for one thing - so the nameless hero has to tell of that.<br />... Right ...<br />So it's three tellings of the same story. Just like that.<br /><br />The three assassins are Sky (Donnie Yen), Broken Sword, and Flying Snow. Let me tell you this - the fight scene between Sky and the hero is the most interesting, but it's the only one that happens only once. Donnie Yen is a great actor (he's really good in Iron Monkey) and great at the martial arts. But he's only in this one little scene.<br />Then Jet Li has to go fight the other two, and it's with them the stories keep changing.<br />It's hard to connect with the characters, because they keep changing. For a hero, the nameless guy doesn't do very much.<br /><br />The fighting is neat at first, but then it gets boring. Wow, they flew! And then they flew again, and again....<br /><br />What I can say for this movie is that the scenery was really beautiful. They have a scene where Broken Sword and the hero are fighting (flying) over a lake, and the lake and mountain scenery is absolutely gorgeous.<br />The choreography was all right. The directing was fine. But the movie was boring. It was really surprising - even my father, who simply loves all martial arts movies, said it was flat out boring.<br />The most fun thing, actually, was the commentary (\\"Hero Defined\\" - a look at the epic masterpiece).<br /><br />If you are into the stylized fighting and tragic story-lines, I do recommend at least starting the movie. Otherwise, this is one you can go without seeing. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon was good. Once Upon a Time in China was good. Iron Monkey was good. Jet Li is good. But Hero simply does not make it.If you are into the stylized fighting and tragic story-lines, I do recommend at least starting the movie. Otherwise, this is one you can go without seeing.

0440178002|5.0|This is my favorite book of all time, I love it. I find myself rereading in constantly. The character and plot development are near perfect in my opinion. You almost get to know the characters on a personal level. I've read my fair share of excellent books in my few years, however, this is my favorite; it's a real page turner. I know that it is a long book, but it's just one of those books that you can't put down after you start to read it.  <br /> <br />So just sit down, and start reading, trust me, you won't be able to stop. The book really is that good.
B00028HBKM|5.0|When I orginally saw this movie Ash Wednesday of this year, I was like I know what is going on, it won't be that bad. Boy, I was ever wrong. I have seen other depictions of Jesus Christ, but this has to be one of the best. I feel a closer my Jesus christ for his sacrifice. There is no other person that comes before my jesus and his mother mary. I know this has been repeated many times, but it is the truth, I feel the violence was necessary to show the anormity of our lord's sacrifice. This is a must have for the person who has that special relationship with jesus, like I do.  <br /> <br />5 thumbs way up high!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0001LJC2K|1.0|Muse is BLATANTLY derivative of Radiohead. If you don't mind their complete lack of originality and long for a watered-down version of the source material.........knock yourselves out with Muse.<br /><br />They should be ashamed to have ripped off another artist's sound and sensibility so obviously.<br /><br />Just another example of the sad state of affairs in the music industry.
0743454529|4.0|I loved this book, but was so disappointed with the ending!  I finished the entire book in about 3 days because the characters were well developed and the plot kept thickening.  When I finally did reach the last two or three chapters, I was upset, but the rest of the book was worth while.
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|I think Shania Twain is the best female focalist and artist in country music today.I have her up cd and two songs she sounded like Tammy Wynett and Patsy Cline and a few more Female vocalists I was shocked to find out that it was Shania singing.She helps me be stronger everyday when things are tough.
B00003CXCT|3.0|...and he must be stopped.<br /><br />It's bad enough that \\"Star Wars Episodes I & II\\" have been absolute torture to sit through (I own them, for reasons even today I can't quite fathom) with lukewarm storylines, pathetic character development (despite unquestionably talented actors filling the important roles), and dialogue that would embarrass even the English dubbers of Hong Kong kung fu movies to put onto film (friends SWEAR that the only way to watch the newer \\"Star Wars\\" movies is with one of the foreign dialogue tracks on and English subtitles).<br /><br />That subsequent efforts 20 years hence the initial effort are substandard is unfortunate but perhaps not entirely unsuspected; how many times can lightning strike in the same place?  Even by the time of \\"Return Of The Jedi\\" it could be said that inspiration was running thin.<br /><br />But these are the films that dared to show the broadest extention of what was possible; they reinvented the genre of science fiction-based action/fantasy and set the standard so high that only George Lucas himself was capable of reaching it.  Seeing the original \\"Star Wars\\" for the first time in 1977 had to be akin to listening to Jimi Hendrix for the first time in 1967; it was a threshold moment that clearly defined \\"before\\" and \\"after\\" along the timeline of both film and popular culture.<br /><br />Which is why it is so VERY important that the original \\"Star Wars\\" trilogy be presented in the way it initially appeared in 1977, 1980, and 1983.  Re-issuing the films in 1997 on the 20th anniversary of the release of the original film with the restoration of some scenes cut from the original theatrical productions and with digitally enhanced and altered scenes that were unable to be realized for whatever reason (technological limitations, mostly) was a questionable enough decision, but it proved to be a stroke of marketing genius and introduced an entire new generation of fans to the series (such as my stepson, now 11 years old himself).<br /><br />And now with the (LONG overdue) release of the series on DVD, Lucasfilm and/or 20th Century Fox had the opportunity to do the right thing...which was obviously to release both the original theatrical cuts of the movies as well as the 1997 (and 2004) versions that Lucas so selfishly indulged himself with reproducing regardless of the wishes of the fans of the movies, the fans whose love and devotion to his work put him exactly in the position to so wantonly disregard our emotional attachment as he has done with his decision to instead release only the doctored versions of the movies, giving the experienced viewer the opportunity to compare the brilliance of the guerilla technology available from the mid-1970's through the mid-1980's and the skill by which human endeavor was able to fashion an entire universe seemingly from thin air to the soulless technology that did all it could to cover up the shortcomings of scripts in \\"Episodes I & II\\" and looks so blatantly artificial and out-of-place amongst the organic beauty of the first three movies.<br /><br />I bought the \\"Trilogy\\" set, of course...I would probably pay the price for \\"Episode IV: A New Hope\\" by itself.  The other movies to me are bonus material unto themselves, and the fourth disc is a magnificent collection of historical and anecdotal material that is a welcome addition to the set.  But...this could've been done so much better.<br /><br />Witness the \\"Alien Quadrilogy\\" set (also from 20th Century Fox) as a prime example of how this set should have been done; there were original theatre cuts AS WELL AS \\"director's cuts\\" of each of the four movies in the \\"Alien Series\\", as well as a separate bonus disc of archival material.  The asking price for the entire set is considerably higher than that of the \\"Star Wars Trilogy\\" set, but it is obvious that the market of Star Wars fans would pony up the money for the extra material without a second thought (the \\"Alien\\" series is also available on amovie-by-movie basis for those who aren't interested in owning all four movies, another concept that Lucas can't seem to grasp).<br /><br />In short, I am doomed to be disappointed by George Lucas and his \\"director's vision\\".  He has lost sight of the notion that art no longer belongs to the artist once it reaches the level that \\"Star Wars\\" obviously has; it belongs to everyone, and it is obvious that Lucas cares less about those who have come to love and appreciate his art than he does about his own designs; imagine if Botticelli had decided that his \\"Venus\\" would have looked better in a hot pink negligee and high heels...and decided to go back afterward and paint them on, never to be removed.  Lucas has effectively done that with the DVD edition of the Star Wars trlogy, and it is just an awful shame, because he could have done the right thing and made everyone happy.available on a movie-by-movie basis for those who aren't interested in owning all four movies, another concept that Lucas can't seem to grasp). <br /> <br />In short, I am doomed to be disappointed by George Lucas and his \\"director's vision\\".

0679720200|4.0|I was looking forward to reading \\"The Stranger\\" due to its interesting premise, and upon finishing it, I am not quite sure exactly what I have read.  \\"The Stranger\\" is a disturbing look into a seemingly immoral man's life, who commits an inexplicable murder, and is nonchalant in regards to his future.  It is an exploration of the questions that plague men's souls about their very existence.<br /><br />We are immediately introduced to our narrator, Meursault, an Algerian Frenchman, as he relates the news of his mother's death.  Instead of being overcome with emotion, Meursault reacts to his mother's passing with little more than mere annoyance.  He then returns to his job and takes up with a young women he has admired for some time.  She becomes besotted with him, but he could care less whether he marries her or not.  For no good reason, other than wanting someone to talk to, he befriends the building's pimp and helps him fight off the men who stalk him.  In one moment of blinding thoughtlessness, Meursault commits an unthinkable murder.  He is arrested, and the rest of the book is devoted to his time in jail and his trial.<br /><br />Although Meursault is the narrator, I feel that we never get to know him.  He wanders aimlessly through life, questioning much and gaining few answers.  His observations about life in jail, and his questions about what happens after death are thoughtprovoking, but reveal little as to the true nature of his mind.  Camus is a gifted writer who explores the darkest realms of the human mind, but fails to come up with any explanation to justify his narrator's motives.  In the end, we want something more than questions - even if the answers aren't known.
B00068IOWC|5.0|There is always a high expectation when it comes to a band that's considered the best in the world. And when this band is not just followed but loved as well, this expectation comes with a little fear that the new album won't do justice to U2's monumental legacy. How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb is far from just another album, it's the result of the magic and the genius of four guys that continue to amaze us and keep on bringing fire to our hearts. God bless them for that. Give yourself the chance to experience the spirit, heart and soul of this incredible bunch of songs. U2 needs no help from a review, the work's already done when you stop and listen to this work of art. But this is a fan thankful enough to express the bliss of ownning this album. Enjoy!
0790729628|5.0|You could say best movie ever, best adaption from a book (Do androids dream of electric sheep? by Phillip K Dick) it's that good.  This is more than a film its a stunning cinematic achievement. Whether you like the OV or the DC is irrellevant personally I like the accidental Original Version and the happy ending. Although he didn't want to do it Harrison Ford makes a good film noir narrator and his voice over matches his characters outsider demeanor as he hunts down the replicants.  This movie really is my all time favorite I have to see it atleast once a year.  It had a dreamcast Sean Young, Harrison Ford,James Edward Olmos,Rutger Hauer,Emmit Walsh, Brion James, Daryl Hannah some of these great actors early in their careers.  Ofcourse Harrison Ford's performance goes without saying it remains one of his best.  Sean Young has never played a more likeable character than Rachel. Unlike John Carpenter's \\"Escape from New York\\" Ridley Scott had the sense to set it far enough in the future 2019 that today it is still just as effective as when it came out.  When you think of Sci-Fi usually it is way way in the future and usually in space or other planets but amazingly this LA of the future saga makes for the best of the genre.  The opening titles sequence is incredible, the triumphant music justaposed with the open onto the dark rainy cityscape LOS ANGELES NOVEMBER 2019 with the factory towers spewing fire into the nightsky, the flyovers the giant electronic bilboards Coca Cola still rules, the glass pyramid  tyrell building the city reflected on Holden's eye as he prepares to interview replicant Leon, wow incredible film!!!!Vangelis soundtrack is extraordinary!  There's something about this dark rainy grim futureworld that is so compelling! The irony that Deckard ends up falling in love with one of the created beings that he routinly hunts down for a living and the effect it has on him makes us all think of our fragil human existence. Like tears in rain.  This is movie rocks!!!! 100 stars <br />Sign the SEDVD petition! <br />
B0001L3MI0|4.0|This is a good movie. If you are looking for a nice hassle-free time, this is your movie. If you like the idea of aliens coming to earth and authorities knowing something about it, get this title. If you are looking for a deep, though provoking film about extra-terrestial intelligence, then, i don't know, go get Contact or something.

B00005JMFQ|5.0|I don't know about some of you, but I understand when I walk into a theatre that what I am seeing is a movie, not real life.  This is not a documentary.  The fictional characters are in obviously ridiculous, improbable, impossible situations.  They are obviously all to some extent caricatures.  I was no more offended by Billy Bob Thornton's philandering president than I was by the aging rock star stripping on national television.    <br /> <br />And don't try to tell me that people don't fool around on beautiful intelligent women like Emma Thompson for \\"wannabes\\".  Even in real life they do.  Hugh grant fooled around on absolutely gorgeous, intelligent Elizabeth Hurley with a prostitute. <br /> <br />Listen up.  No movie is real.  Relax, suspend disbelief and laugh at it.  It's a riot.

B00005LK95|4.0|This movie is great in a horrendously cheesy, yet beautiful way - it is a triumph of the human (robot) spirit. Poor ol' Johnny 5 comes to the big city, open eyed and pure and is beaten down and taken advantage of. The classic struggle between hope and idealism vs. the often dreary and dissapointing realities.  But yes, one glorious spirit is capable of awakening the lost hope in others and emerging victorious.
B000679N96|3.0|Regarding \\"Killing an Arab\\":  Before anyone posts about how the band's classic debut single wasn't supposed to be on this album in the first place, please give us some credit.  We know this.    What this compilation attempts to be is a definitive document of the Cure's history from 1977-79.  It collects the remastered debut album (never officially released in the U.S. in this form prior to this) on Disc 1, and a generous handful of rarities and bonus tracks on Disc 2.  As such, every track officially released on prior versions of this album and its contemporaneous singles is present and remastered, minus a pair of B-sides (\\"Plastic Passion,\\" \\"I'm Cold\\") that appropriately appeared on this year's earlier B-sides box, Join the Dots... Every track is present, that is, except for \\"Killing an Arab.\\"    The reason why some of us are up in arms over this?  Do the math.  The band's 2nd and 3rd singles (\\"Boys Don't Cry\\" and \\"Jumping Someone Else's Train\\") are here, and the bonus disc has 14 minutes of available space left on it.  \\"Killing an Arab\\" was not on the remastered Greatest Hits collection from 2001, and if the record execs were \\"saving\\" this historical cornerstone for some sort of remastered Staring at the Sea, why wouldn't they \\"save\\" the other singles as well?    Simply put, the song has been discarded.  It looks as if, in the current political climate, the song, which has no racist overtones to its content whatsoever, was deliberately omitted as an act of cowardice and self-censorship.    While most Cure fans will undoubtedly appreciate the amazing rarities here - and some of them are truly gems - some of us have even more appreciation for historical accuracy.  I would rather have one debut single that has been a part of the rock pantheon for over 25 years than five, ten, twenty, or a million previously unreleased curios that are attempting to compensate for a rewriting of history.    For the record, the sound quality here is quite good - the album sounds clean but not overbright like some of the tracks on Join the Dots, and the extras all sound as good as their sources allow them to be... However, I do agree that \\"World War\\" was obviously taken from an inferior source as it is missing some high end.  All in all, this project had great potential, but ends up something akin to botched plastic surgery: on the surface it looks great, but look a little deeper and all you can see are unforgivable flaws.

B00005JNBQ|5.0|Napoleon Dynamite is one of the funniest films I have ever seen in my life. Most of the humor is directed at and some might argue, against, the main character Napoleon, who is depicted as a nerd to end all nerds. But, the humor isn't cruel, because the audience loves and roots for Napoleon's success. The film is absolutely loaded with one-liners that you will catch yourself running back and forth with your friends long after you see the film. As far as longevity goes, after two viewings, the humor is not as grabbing as the initial. It probably won't hold up to a film like \\"The Big Lebowski\\". But, it will stand the test of time to sit proudly next to your copy of \\"Bottlerocket.\\" Napoleon is the comedy of the year, and a perfect movie to watch and laugh at with a big group of friends.
B000002I25|5.0|As if recording a Bertolt Brecht cover alone weren't enough to make The Doors the coolest, they had to go and record this entire amazing album. The music is dark, but with a seriousness and talent that lifts it above the Gothy adolescent, and Morisson's voice is just exceptional; very emotive and creepy. I actually think 'Light My Fire' isn't even the best song on here. Easily in its league are the energetic little rocker 'I Looked At You,' with its trick ending; the brief, shivery 'Crystal Ship;' and of course the The End, which is plenty disturbing without calling up images of nameless atrocities in the jungles of Vietnam. And who could forget the Whisky Bar song? The best thing of all, in my opinion, is that The Doors knew how to make a song short and to the point; there aren't any ambiguous four-minute droners with just one chorus after another.
B00005JN4H|4.0|Though the movie is only average, the driving is really well done; that's the one area where I really liked the cinematography. If you're looking for a good movie, skip it; if you want great driving scenes, it makes a great film.
B000000OPZ|5.0|I didn't get to hear the whole album until 1989, but I recall Whitesnake's impact in 1987 and 1988 with the mileage they had with it!  Dynamic rock songs here, especially Still Of The Night and Here I Go Again.  Bad Boys I also like with its attitude and fast pace! As I'm writing this, the song Is This Love might be playing on some stations.  Adult contemporary pop stations still love this record a good 17 years later!  It is a well crafted song with its reflective breaks that match with the song's lyrics and David Coverdale's longing for that woman.  I like the guitar solo, of which they play it a lot more versus the single version.  The other members such as John Sykes, Vivian Campbell and Adrian Vandenburg played an important part in this album!  I still like Still of The Night, and its rocking sections and reflective section in the middle before rocking once again. It's kind of something Led Zeppelin would do if they had continued.  This is a phenomenally done effort, one of the '80s best albums in terms of the big production and bombast!  Coverdale matched romanticism and emotional sides with aggressive rock all in one album with his band!

0312962118|2.0|There was the makings of a great thriller here, but Meade chose to focus on the wrong characters. I was never interested in the fate of Alex, a cold, hard-bitten killer whose motivations are kept under wraps until a (rather contrived) 11th hour reveal. If the story had been built around Massey's doomed attempt to save Alex from trying to carry out a mission that was inevitably going to lead him to disaster, it would have had a stronger emotional hook. But Meade spends much too much time setting up the mechanics of Alex's mission and not enough on giving us a reason to care about Alex. Since this isn't really alternate history, we know he's not really going to succeed, so it needed to be more about the 'why' and less about 'how.'<br /><br />Sometimes evocative, but structurally clumsy and with a choppy writing style (and some really contrived setpieces) that keep it from catching fire. A shame.
B0002EXH5O|5.0|This album rocks.  Megadeth started slow with Killing is my Business then they picked up with Peace Sells.  Afterwards, they went down when they did So Far...So Good...So what because of drup problems and the expulsion of Poland and Samuelson.  In R.I.P, come in Menza and Friedman and they do a great job of defining their ranks.  This album is probably one of their best.  I don't know why it only has a 4 out of 5.  I believe it should have a 4.5 or 5.  In my opinion, it was great.  I hope you like it and enjoy it.
B0001O2SOG|4.0|French duo Air returns to top form with the excellent \\"Talkie Walkie,\\" a charming collection of cool, soft electropop. Air fans won't be disappointed by the combination of the strong points of past releases. It sounds fresh and new, but not TOO new. Air stays connected to what it's done in the past.<br /><br />\\"Talkie Walkie\\" is a solid collection of pop (the haunting \\"Run\\" and beautiful \\"Cherry Blossom Girl\\"), psychedelica (catchy, futuristic-sounding \\"Surfing on a Rocket\\") and beautiful instrumentals (the sweeping acoustic-based \\"Mike Mills\\"). As an additional bonus, the CD comes with a bonus DVD, which contains some truly exquisite music videos.<br /><br />Don't expect the second chapter of \\"Moon Safari.\\" The latest Air release has a more experimental sound, as if they're trying to make everything balance out. And their attempt is pretty much successful. The dreamy, slightly vulnerable songwriting blends perfectly with a mix of acoustic and electronic music.<br /><br />At times, \\"Talkie Walkie\\" sags slightly with a riff that doesn't belong or a song that could have been shorter. Most of the time, though, it boasts some pretty impressive instruments -- piano, strings, electric drums, bells and smooth soundscapes. Lyrics are simple, especially in the sweet love song \\"Venus\\" (\\"If you walk in the sun/I will be your shadow\\").<br /><br />Smooth, cool and otherworldly, \\"Talkie Walkie\\" is a beautifully-made release by a talented band. This elegant album is a must-have for music fans.
B0002EXH4K|4.0|Not as good as Rust in Peace.  They seem to slow down and take an alteranative from thrash metal.  There is nothing wrong with that.  It is a good album.  My favorite tracks are Skin o'My Teeth, Symphony of Destruction, Sweating Bullets, Foreclosure of a Dream and This was my life.  This album is like their black album.  Nonetheless, I love this album and if you're a Megadeth fan, then you should get it.
B0006B29WA|4.0|No, this Franz Ferdinand is not a person. Rather, it is a Scottish quartet who produced some of the most entertaining rock-y pop of the past year in their self-titled debut, shifting from U.K. stardom to the U.S. charts as well. It's undeniably a guilty pleasure, but it's also fun, catchy and fairly original.<br /><br />The self-titled album starts off on a strong note with the bass-heavy pop \\"Jacqueline,\\" the kickoff to a slew of rock-tinged songs (the catchy, heavy \\"Take Me Out,\\" the slithery \\"Darts of Pleasure\\"), vaguely arty pop (the addictive \\"The Dark of the Matinee\\"), before finishing off with the quirky percussion, riffs and \\"la la la\\"s of \\"40'.\\"<br /><br />There is also a bonus CD, which has a few songs tacked in from their \\"Darts of Pleasure\\" EP. Among the stuff on this bonus disc is a low-key remix of \\"This Fire,\\" the overwrought \\"Shopping For Blood,\\" and the geekily gleeful glam of \\"Van Tango.\\" The demos aren't nearly as enjoyable -- they're rough, which is to be expected, but they are also slurred and not catchy.<br /><br />One of the most pleasant things about \\"Franz Ferdinand\\" is the sense of fun that permeates the music. It sounds like a bunch of lads having a great time as they make some very danceable music. There are some dud melodies (\\"Tell Her Tonight\\") after their strong opener, but it's all fairly entertaining.<br /><br />However, Franz Ferdinand needs to work on their melodies -- they're pretty entertaining, but somewhat repetitive, like the rising and falling riff in \\"Michael.\\" The riff's good, but it fails to go anywhere. More solid are the bass lines and the thrashier guitar work, backed up some equally solid percussion. And they have a great sense of what makes a good pop-rock tune, able to be catchy without being flimsy.<br /><br />Singer/lead vocalist Alex Kapranos is a good flexible vocalist; he can swoon and shout, and keeps his vocals from sinking into the mire of thrashing guitars. He also has the admirable talent of being able to shift his voice to make it softer or harder, depending on the song. Franz Ferdinand needs to do something about the terrible high-pitched backing in \\"Tell Her Tonight,\\" though.<br /><br />It's not a classic by any stretch, but the rock-tinged pop of \\"Franz Ferdinand\\" is an entertaining diversion in the pop-rock world. And the bonus CD is just icing on the cake.nt of being able to shift his voice to make it softer or harder, depending on the song.

B00005V0X5|4.0|At first I thought this album was a little mediocre.  As I started to listen to it more and more I felt like it was really good.  It's a good thrash album to have.  However, there are better ones.  This is like their Kill'em All.  Nonetheless, Megadeth get only better and better.  This album helps to lay down the foundations for later albums.  I'd recommend getting this album if you consider yourself a Megadeth fan.
B00003CXXJ|1.0|I wish there was a zero star rating, because that's exactly what I would have given it. I hate this movie with a passion. I don't think I've ever hated any other kids' movie as much as I hate Shrek. It's an overrated, inane, pedestrian, and completely pointless film. There's not an ounce of originality, imagination, depth or moral in it. What, \\"looks aren't as important as what's on the inside\\"? Please. Make more fun of Farquad's short stature and small, er, manhood throughout the entire film, why don't you - now THAT will get your message across... And it's not even this hypocritical tidbit that renders the film's message void. A young woman like Fiona who belches and makes birds explode without any sign of remorse is bound to be called an ogre regardless of whether she turns into one at night or not.<br /><br />It wants to be clever but it's not. It wants to be creative but it's not. It wants to be revolutionary but it is most definitely not. Its formula is trite and ludicrous: take a couple of famous actors' voices, throw it together with every character and storyline from classic fairytales you can think of, add badly-remade pop-music hits, and garnish with a monstrous amount of potty humor, and there you go. An instant \\"masterpiece\\". NOT.<br /><br />This movie is trash. Don't waste your money or time, go see \\"Monsters Inc.\\" or \\"Toy Story\\" or \\"Finding Nemo\\" or even \\"Ice Age\\" instead - all of which incite powerful emotions and teach important lessons a child can actually learn from.
B00006J3WH|3.0|Like he did with the episode \\"Hush\\" (no sound at all) and \\"The Body\\" (no soundtrack at all), Joss Whedon proved once again how dare he can be, and even so the morons at Emmy never awarded one single reward to this show!!<br /><br />\\"Once More With Feeling\\" is Buffy at its best. The cast proves how talented they are, no matter if all of them are great singers or not. The whole episode flows with the music, it's a historic mark in television.<br /><br />But the CD is another matter. Of course it's fun to listen, it wil bring youalways fresh memories from the episode, but as music itself goes it's no big deal at all.
B00005YXZH|3.0|Plenty of hooks, but no catch.  The best moments come from when they sound like a pastiche of their noted influences.  More time seems to have been spent on the electronic garnish than actually writing good songs, and ultimately neither of these elements are very interesting.  Tweedy's voice is irritating, and the honest yet depressingly formulaic lyrics don't help.  What troubles me is how devoid of emotion is--when I listen to YHF, I feel nothing.  I don't care about this album at all.
6301954947|5.0|.....that shot of the French Cavalry charge on the British Squares and the draw back helicopter shot.  Worth it just for that.  The recreation of the disastrous cavalry charge of the Scots Grey's was clearly based on the famous lithograph print and PERFECTLY captures the piece but in full living and blood curdling motion.    I can never decide about Christopher Plummer's interpretation of Wellington.  A little too Christopher Plummer and missing the depth that Rod Steiger brings to his rather wonderful Napoleon.    The movie is a distillation of the key points of the rather longer and more complicated battle but seems reasonably accurate in the parts it does portray when compared to historical accounts.    Someone else asked - where did they get the extras?  Believe it or not - The Red Army!  Yep - in 1970!!    I saw the full three hours in the cinema in 1970 and am still blown away by the odd TV cut down and extracts.    Time to go to Amazon.co.uk and get a Region 2 DVD and hack my computer DVD drive again!  :-)    It is just too good to wait for here in the USA.
B0002Z9HT8|2.0|I was extremely excited to finally find out that there was going to be a dvd release of the 1985 Live Aid Concert. When I purchased the dvds and then wathced them it brought back great memories but several of the key perfromances were edited or not on the dvd at all. Dylans and the Stones performance only contained Blowin in the Wind. Billy Joel, Plant and Page, and Waylon Jennings were not even on the dvd's. On the positive, there is the entire Queen perfromance which is worth buying the dvd's  for and the great performance by Mick Jaggar and Tina Turner which was I think the highlight of the show. All the other perfromances are edited or missing songs to the best of my memory. The quality is medicore at best and the sound is not that great either but is better than nothing.
B00007L4MJ|5.0|Kino's transfer of \\"Metropolis\\" is absolutely gorgeous. Aside from a few scenes here and there (together with the caveat that entire sections of the film have been lost forever), the images are pristine. Sure, choosing to include the original German intertitles would have made for a nice feature, but their absence is more than compensated by the success of the restoration.<br /><br />As for the film itself, \\"Metropolis\\" absolutely deserves to be watched. \\"Metropolis\\" is my least favorite of the Lang films I've seen -- and yet its brilliance makes it an important addition to the collection of any serious film buff. Its photography is beautiful, its actors are convincing, its sets are ornate, and its story is interesting -- particularly viewed within the proper historical context. The message behind \\"Metropolis\\" is decidedly social democratic / democratic socialist: the slave-workers are forced to toil beneath a nightmarish urban landscape to preserve the luxiorous existence of the opulent few who live in a utopic garden-community in the sky, utterly shielded from the misery their existence inflicts on others. Obviously, an indictment of capitalism, at least as it existed in the industrialized world (e.g., Germany) in the early part of the twentieth century. Along comes Maria, a beautiful peasant woman who inspires the workers with hope by arguing for nonviolent resistance and reconciliation with the capitalist class, and that a mediator is needed to bridge the divide. That mediator turns out to be young Freder, son of capitalist Fredersen, who sympathizes with the plight of the slave-workers and quickly falls in love with Maria. To subvert the nascent labor movement, Freder's father, who learns of the plan, convinces a talented inventor to create a Maria-like android, who incites the workers to violence -- providing the capitalists with a pretext for crushing the workers through force. Clearly, Lang is suggesting that advocates of anti-capitalist violence (e.g., theCommunists) serve the interests of the capitalists.<br /><br />Why is this expressionistic masterpiece my least favorite Lang film? The reasons are hard to pinpoint, but \\"Metropolis\\" has a vague \\"Hollywood\\"-feel, which I regard as unfortunate. More importantly, the ending is overly sentimental. If a person could own only one Lang film, \\"M\\" or \\"Dr. Mabuse: The Gambler\\" would certainly be the better choice. But who would want to live in a world that prohibited people from owning more than one of Lang's films?

B00004X0Q0|4.0|At The Drive In stands up and paints the walls of your speakers in the colors of their innovative taste in music with \\"Relationship of Command.\\" Their most commercial, yet most complete work of the band's career. Eleven (11) abrasive, thought provoking rock tracks featuring the distorted guitar work of Omar Lopez Rodriguez and the raw vocals and \\"stream of conscious\\" lyrics of Cedric Zavala. A musical style well ahead of it's time. Check out \\"Invalid Litter Dept.\\" and \\"Pattern Against User.\\" 4/5
B00009Z576|4.0|What can I say here that hasn't already been said by other reviewers? I liked this album quite a bit. It's not like other Yes albums. I don't know why many people don't like it either, but here's the rub: many people seem to think that this album's lack of success turned on the newly-drafted membership at the time. Quite the contrary, If you were a Yes fan at the time of this album's release, (as I was) you were pretty much used to a revolving door of Yes membership. By this time in their history, there had been no less than three keyboardists, two guitarists and two drummers, leaving the only core members, founder Squire and Anderson.  Somehow, no matter what, it always came out sounding like Yes. That is to say until this album came out.  Perhaps the Yes audience wasn't ready for such a sonic transition. Perhaps Yes' success with a new sound in 90125 came from developing a new audience. Either way, I challenge anyone to truly reason why this record didn't take off.  This album, for all its oddity is still a very pleasant listen. To paraphrase Douglas Adams, it's like opening a Canada Dry and finding out it's got Bushmills in it. Not unpleasant, just a surprise.
015626224X|3.0|The beginning Paris section is engaging and one gets caught up in the author's adventures in the seemy underbelly of the city.    The London section comes off as a dry, analytical essay on social conditions and is quite boring.
B00005JMXX|2.0|The enviro-fantasy \\"The Day After Tomorrow\\" has a single redeemable trait...the special effects are very good. These special effects are not on par with \\"Star Wars\\" great, just good. Roland Emmerich's (director and co writer) plot for his movie \\"Independence Day\\" is more plausible than having the earth's next ice age occur in less than a week (dah). As a side bar: the mastodon that died \\"with grass in his mouth\\" was killed by falling through ice on the Arctic tundra. <br /> <br />Dennis Quaid plays his stereotypical role...regular guy who is largely ignored or discounted most of his life then steps up to face extreme adversity only to triumph. Dennis Quaid plays the same role in \\"The Alamo\\" and \\"The Rookie.\\" It is a role that he is good at and he does a commendable job even in this largely forgettable movie. <br /> <br />I am glad that I did not pay thru the nose for this movie at the theater. The special effects would have been better presented in this venue, but who wants fork out those bucks. \\"The Day After Tomorrow\\" is only a reasonable value as a cheap used DVD. <br />
B0006399FS|5.0|I'm finding the debate over the \\"quality\\" of U2's new album really interesting. Like many, when I first listened to it I was incredibly disappointed -- deflated, angry, frustrated at Bono for all the recording studio misinformation and hype. But you know what? I should have trusted them, as repeated listenings have revealed this to be the masterpiece it truly is.  <br /> <br />A band like U2, whose sound and canon have now become iconic, cannot reinvent its sound on every new studio recording -- that kind of epochal shift can only happen once or perhaps twice in a band's career. We definitely saw that with Achtung Baby, and there appears to be consensus around that point. Every step since then has been evolutionary, not revolutionary. In terms of pure sound, U2 (as Bono has said of the Edge), owns a particular part of the spectrum. There will always be an essence that is U2, and that is a fact that can provide limitless consolation to many and endless frustration for some.  <br /> <br />How I gauge a U2 album is simply this: how true to that essence is U2 on this release? Sometimes that happens fairly quickly (AB, ATYCLB), and sometimes it takes much longer (POP, Zooropa, etc.). But, at the end of the day, you must strip your expectations bare -- live the album, not force it comply to a standard or defined shape. After \\"living\\" with HTDAAB several times, I stopped trying to love it -- and then I loved it. It all sounds very cliched and hokey, but U2 is really asking its listeners to engage on a totally different level. It's one requires the listener to deliver the goods, too -- openness, a sense of discovery, a willingness to hear for the first time.  <br /> <br />Where I do think the band is forging new ground is not so much in the area of sound, but in the area of genre. All the trademarks and conventions may be in place, but I, for one, have never heard them deployed the way are in, say, Original of the Species -- the song structure, the Beatlesque melody, and the sheer joy in Bono's off-melody vocal performance. There's real innovation there, and like every great artist, they are defying expectations by taking their essence and molding it into new shapes. More than that, though, for U2 it's NOT an intellectual exercise -- somehow, and I'm not sure how, they manage to be radical within a known universe, without violating the foundation of their musical, emotional or spiritual identity. That is truly special, and that is, at least for this listener, what makes them revoltionary in the the history of rock.  <br /> <br />So give yourself over to this album... the rewards are huge, and you won't forget the experience.  <br /> <br />
B00063EMJG|5.0|I dont generally ever buy a Compilation - I loathe them but when it's Neil and remastered then I have to make an exception, this is an fantastic Greatest Hits package based on original record sales, airplay, and known download history, definately not a cash-in for xmas, this would have cost Warner alot to have had this remastered this way, possibly hundreds of thousands of dollars. <br /> <br />I bought this DVD/CD combo here in the UK and I would like to believe it is a dvd-audio disc but I'm not too sure, I have a dvd-audio player and I own a couple of other Neil Young DVD-A discs (Harvest, On The Beach and Greendale) they all bear the dvd-audio logo and my dvd-audio display on my dvd deck lights up when I play those discs but not on this greatest hits package, I cant find any mention of dvd-audio anywhere on the disc packaging, maybe the U.S version differs ? on the cd cover there is a sticker which states \\"Super Saturated DVD-Stereo, is this a new format ? or is it DVD-Audio ? <br />Eitherway this is definately worth the money. Nice One Neil.
B0000AFQS0|4.0|How do I access the video for the song \\"The Kid's Are Alright\\".  My copy of this double disc set states that there is a \\"Director's Cut\\" version on disc one (that would presumably include the video for the song TKAA).  However, when you go to the special features section of disc one, it asks you to go directly to disc two (but I didn't find  the \\"Director's Cut\\" version there either).  Otherwise this version of the film is no better, or no worse than other versions, as there is no \\"real\\" bonus footage.  Most film information on The Who is generally grainy, and somewhat sloppy, but isn't that why we loved The Who all along anyway?
B0001NBMBC|1.0|How could anyone listen to this! The songs are some of the most boring,pathetic,and unoriginal stuff I ever heard! If this album was released by a different band, it wouldn't even be selling! Cory can NOT yell anymore and when he tries,he sounds REALY PATHETIC! Slipknot now sounds like the rest of the mtv radio rock clones but almost worse! I knew this day would come the second I saw the video from their 3rd album \\"IOWA\\" called \\"left behind\\". Mate Feed Kill was a great slipknot album. \\"slipknot\\"was also a solid album that got them more noticed,when they started goin on mtv and all that crap. At the time ,mainstreem music fans who were discusted by all the pop[...] at the time turned to slipknot. For they were the Heaviest MTV band around! Now we have albums like \\"subliminal verses for the wimpy mallgoth teenager\\" that is liked by good charlotte and britny fans alike. I still don't see how even fans of pop music could like this, but o' well I guess I just listen to to much metal...and this is not.[...] WTF? If you want music that scares people listen to gorgoroth or deicide or some [...] cryptopsy! [...] Slayer's Hell awaits. Now that's a scary album!

B00005JMJG|4.0|Michael Gondry and Charlie Kaufman's \\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\\" may be one of the most original and moving film romances in years. It is impressively directed, and as labrynththine as Kaufman's screenplay gets, the movie never becomes confusing.<br /><br />\\"Eternal Sunshine\\" tells the story of the tumultuous romance of Joel and Clementine, played by Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet. The two are madly in love, and at first they seem to be an odd match. Joel is reseved and introverted, while Clementine is a wild, impulsive woman whose hair color changes with her mood. They are together for two years, and then their relationship comes to a bitter end. Clementine decides to have a medical procedure to erase all of her memories of Joel, and Joel decides to do the same. But as the his memories of Clementine are being removed, Joel realizes how much he loves her, and tries to get her back.<br /><br />The majority of the movie details Joel and Clementine's relationship in reverse, beginning at their final fight and ending at their blissful first encounter. You fall in love with the characters, as flawed as they are, and desperately want them to be together in the end. Other plots include the story of the mind-erasure company employees, played by Tom Wilkinson, Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo, and Elijah Wood. All of them give stellar performances, making the most of their limited screen time.<br /><br />But there is no question that \\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\\" belongs to Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet. Carrey has slowly moved towards more serious roles, and this may be his finest performance to date. His Joel is a sad, ordinary individual, and not for a moment does Carrey fall out of character. Winslet, one of the best actresses of her generation, positively glows as the madcap Clementine, whose impulsive behavior masks a deep insecurity and pain. Together, the two actors create a couple so beautifully in love that we want them to stay together forever, even though the film leaves you with the sense that they are destined to go their separate ways.even though the film leaves you with the sense that they are destined to go their separate ways.

B0006399FS|4.0|There are two types of U2 fan that will like How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb and one type that will criticize and reject it.  The two that will be pleased are: 1) the long-term fan that harkens back to their first three records, because they are probably more forgiving, but also because they're in it for the guys in the band, the spirit of Bono's thoughts, and the nostalgic familiarity of the sound, and 2) the new fan that's come to U2 in the past half dozen years, maybe because they're too new to know better.  The U2 fan that will be resolutely disappointed in this record is the one who came on board with The Joshua Tree, got thrilled by the new direction of Achtung, Baby, was delighted by the follow-up Zooropa, fascinated by the side-project Passengers and disappointed but reluctantly respectful of the mess that was Pop.  This fan won't like the record because this fan interprets U2 to be a band who's raison d'etre is to change their sound and content with every production.  For them, it's change or die.  And HTDAAB is not a change. <br /> <br />This record is the soul mate of, and has everything in common with, its predecessor, 2000's All That You Can't Leave Behind, for the simple reason that it's nothing more than a collection of well-written and well-produced songs that breaks no new ground musically or lyrically, but doesn't really rely on any one period of the band's past either.  That description may not sound like a ringing endorsement, but to say it's not art rock innovation is not to say it's not good - in fact, it's quite good.  The difference in the two records is that the new one is not as cohesive a collection.  It has a slightly more brooding sound and theme, but more importantly the songs just don't hang together quite as well as on ATYCLB.  That fact actually allows some of the songs (if not the whole album) to stand out a bit more, to push a bit more toward the edge.  It's not so full of shiny happy people.  It's kind of imperfect.  HTDAAB is toATYCLB as The Unforgettable Fire was to The Joshua Tree.  In some ways that makes it better. <br /> <br />Here are the ways in which it's a very good record:  Miracle Drug, City of Blinding Lights (with its Ultravox-like hook) and One Step Closer are notable additions to the U2 canon.  Yahweh, a title that invites even the most fervent U2 fan to say, \\"Bono, dude, don't you think the pretension is getting the best of you?\\" actually comes off great, and makes a far better closer than the terribly weak \\"Grace\\" of the previous record.  Virtually all the rest of the tracks are very good, if not classic.  Unfortunately, the new album would have worked better had it been just 10 songs, with All Because of You relegated to a b-side, which it very much is.  But 11 seems to be U2's favorite number of late, and they made the ill-chosen decision to include a middle song that's weaker than the five before it and five after it.  Just delete it when you download to your iPod and you'll have a better album. <br /> <br />Ultimately, what it comes down to is this:  These are bunch of middle-aged men who've been playing together for 25 years.  Among them they have kids, divorces, political and economic disappointments, and parents in the ground.  Like every other person in the middle of their life.  And that's how they sound.  This record will resonate best with the fans who are their age, who identify with the sentiments in City of Blinding Lights, when a guy wonders if he wasn't smarter when he was younger and all the while appreciating the beauty of his wife as she gets dressed to go out (it's actually a brilliant, universal insight).  The fact that they're in their 40s and can still punch out a great sounding record that makes most current radio play sound disastrously disposable isn't a small miracle.  It's one of the greatest stories of rock music.  Period. <br /> <br />Here's the last thought, and I quote Bono himself for it:  \\"I can't change the world, but I can change the world in me... Rejoice!\\"  For those of you who've been around from the beginning, you have nothing to do but rejoice in the latest release.  Not the best, but not the worst, and containing plenty of great stuff that you'll rattle and hum for months.  For the rest of you, who think U2 will save the world (Bono actually may, but that's a different story completely), or rock and roll, I advise you look elsewhere.  These are just a bunch of guys who play great music together, and a group that happens to be one of those rarest of things in music, a group that is so much greater than the sum or their parts that they have and in fact will continue to affect the course of popular music for a long time to come. <br /> <br />To sum up: I'm a middle aged man who's been a U2 fan since their first three records and I say \\"thumbs up.\\"  They've made a record that's great to listen to.
B0000033P0|5.0|On no other ELP record does KE's C3 sound like it does here.It's a living thing that moans,screams and fulminates anger,aggression,and Balls galore.The same can be said for most of his Moog patches as well.Tarkus is brilliant through and through.Brilliant composition and writing craft(Keith and greg),brilliant execution and playing(all three boys),brilliant sounds(Hammond C3 and The beast called Moog),brilliant production(the late great are you ready Eddie Offord),and lastly brilliant-cheesey fantasy sci-fi story line and art work,that made more of an impression on the original lp.I don't even think the cd has the inner sleeve story board pics.I always wanted to see a cartoon with this art work and music-Tarkus by Ralph Bakshi.Speaking of first impressions(no Brain Salad pun intended),you can't fathom a ten year old's reaction to first hearing Eruption,thanks to two older brothers who brought the lp home in early 72.I'm 43 now-i was ten then.and i still ha ven't recovered.Keith Emerson is the main reason i am a Composer concert-jazz pianist today.Without his influence i would never have discovered classical music,or Prokofiev,Scriabin,Gershwin,Mennin,Rachmaninoff,Ravel,Chopin,Bach,Sondheim,or even Corea.How many thousands of others world wide share the same sentiments?This reason alone makes him a critical force in late 20th century music,specifically in regards to the piano and composition.To his detractors i would say get over your resistant need to find fault with his showman persona(also important to that ten year old who in addition to his music thought keith was so damn cool looking mean and lean over all those keys),and try to grasp his essential significance.And like it or not Tarkus 30 + years on, is still significant.From that opening layered C-3 crescendo swell(never done live)to that stack o fourths left hand ostinato figure,Tarkus still kicks [...]!
B0002IU988|3.0|Even though the rhythm section is made up of past Creed members, you really wouldn't even know it in some of the songs.  But yes, in some of the songs, it sounds exactly like Creed.  No big deal.  The album is relatively solid, only I feel there is something missing, which is kind of hard to describe.<br /><br />The new front man sounds like a mix between Chris Cornell, and a lead singer from an 80's metal band.  Not really a great combo, if you think about it.  He doesn't have the charisma, or the magnetism that Stapp had, and I find it hard to be drawn to the music because of it.  His voice is just pretty plain, is what I'm saying.  Not awful, not great.<br /><br />I'm not even going to bother comparing Alter Bridge to Creed, because it's pointless.  I will say, however, that I'm really not feeling the new lead singer.  It's ok.  I'll listen to the album the whole way through and enjoy many parts of it, but it's nothing special.
B000687M48|5.0|Despite other reviews which ridiculed this performance, I loved it!  It was very tastefully filmed and edited; it captured the rough-on-the-edges rawness to otherwise well-rounded and powerful music.  The effects really brought everything to life.  And the big A++++++.... it was filmed in Widescreen!  An automatic 10 stars right there for that!  Even moreso because they didn't make the mistake of releasing a \\"Fool Screen\\" version.  In my opinion, any movies or concerts in Full Screen should be burned with utmost haste... it degrades us all.    The renditions were really well done, especially to some of my favorites, \\"Farther Away\\", \\"Bring Me To Life\\", and the hauntingly beautiful \\"Haunted\\".  But then again, I have yet to find a song I dislike from Evanescence, which is really amazing and yet again tests their success.  Amy Lee has proven herself yet again, this time holding her own in a live performance, and further outdoing herself.  Amy has a lot of stage presence, is very interactive with the audience; the band was jamming like there's no tomorrow.  The vibe was there...Evanescence was jamming, having a damn good time on stage, and loving every moment of it... a feeling I haven't gotten at all from an artist performing live.  The Dolby 5.1 discrete was absolutely amazing!!    In regard to the comment that they need to expand their discography, maybe the reviewer didn't consider \\"Evanescence EP\\" (1999), \\"Sound Asleep EP\\" (1999), or even \\"Origin\\" (2000)?  I mean, don't get me wrong, the discography is there.  Now, why they don't choose to touch to much on older material, I'm not sure, but it's their choice... some of the older material is very nice, but I don't think it fits the style their trying to achieve, especically since Moody left.  For example...listen to \\"Field Of Innocence\\" from Origin and the 1997/98 demo \\"October\\"...both great, infact awesome, songs, but not the style Evanescence wants.    Always amusing, although a little shocking at moments, yet undeniably hilarious, the Behind The Scenes featurettes were a great addition.  We get to experience a little sliver of the personality of Amy Lee, John LeCompt, Rocky Gray, William Boyd, and Terry Balsamo and their experiences while on tour.  It's one thing to see Evanescence on stage, and another thing to see them off stage punkin' around.  I won't spoil anything for you, since it would very unjust... it's a must see.    A very good move was to incorporate all of the current music videos up to date...it really helps wrap up this DVD into a nice little menagerie of Evanescence's work.  And since the only way most people could view these up til now was little , poorly-encoded WMV files on websites...now we get to see them in their full quality!  W00t!    The audio CD version was a nice addition, taking away my need to rip the AC3 tracks right from the DVD, which can otherwise be a real pain... now I can jam in the car, rip to mp3, and load to my iPod.  Although, it's not quite the same as watching the video feed.    All in all, a wonderful DVD, tastefully produced and executed, showing off the gem that Evanescence is and will be for years to come; escpecially as we await new surprises and directions of Evanescence with the loss of Ben Moody, the gain of independence (most noteably for Amy in the writing process), and the desire to rock even better than before on their upcoming album!    Rock on Evanescence!!  We love you!
1592400876|5.0|Far from being a school-marmish condemnation of bad grammar, Lynn Truss serves up a delightful, humorous and didactic look at a most feared topic: proper English punctuation. With engaging examples, she explains the proper (and ever-shifting) usage of semi-colons, commas, colons and quotation marks, giving these seemingly insignificant curves and dots a voice of their own. Anyone who cares about clear communication, and who hates to be confused as a reader, will take solace in the fact that the language has such an ardent (and witty!) supporter and muse.<br /><br />Oh. Read this book and notice how often you'll see examples of improper punctuation in your own life. This past weekend, I saw a sign marked chocolate \\"bunny's\\" (not 'bunnies\\") for sale at a concert -- something that would put a twitch in the corner of Lynn Truss's eye!
B000002UVZ|5.0|Look, seriously, stop reading this review right now and just buy this album. Trust me, passing this one up would be denying yourself one of the greatest pieces of music ever created. R.E.M. have proven time and time again how magical their music is, and this album is at their absolute best. The peak of music perfection.<br /><br />With more clarity behind Stipe's lyrics this time around, we are drawn into this cd rather forcefully with the rocker Begin The Begin, a fabulous song and perhaps R.E.M.s best album beginning, so full of life and energy. This continues with These Days, with it's great, fast guitar.<br /><br />Later on in the album we discover more bouncier, happier songs that take a large leap from the previous album, Fables. I Believe is incredily upbeat and energetic, Hyena has a nice catchy chorus, and the \\"secret track\\" Superman, sung by Mike Mills, is an unbeat way to finish a great album. Even the bizarre Underneath The Bunker is a good listen, and a great way to bridge two completely different tracks.<br /><br />But the real treats on this cd are the slower, mellower tracks. Cuyahoga and Swan Swan H are both fantastic, and are both gentle on the ear, despite delivering strong messages about American culture. The Flowers Of Guatemala is simply beautiful, with excellent backing vocals, creating a very surreal, laid-back experience.<br /><br />Just A Touch is another bouncier track on the cd, with great use of the piano, and What If We Give It Away? is always a good listen. But the real treasure of the album is the hit single Fall On Me, a beautiful ballad about acid rain. It takes my breath away everytime I hear it.<br /><br />All of the tracks on this album, in my opinion, is a 5 star effort. Anyone can enjoy this cd, you simply must have it. R.E.M. really are at the top of their game here... this is definatly an album you do not want to pass by. And if you do pass it by, you're really upsetting me :)
B0001AP12G|5.0|BRILLIANCE! What enlse do you want me to say? My friend played Jesus Walks for me one day, and jokeingly told me that I probably wouldn't like it because I'm Jewish. He couldn't have beem more wrong; sometime with two weeks of that I had bought the album, and fell in love with it. As time passed I began to like it more and more, at this point I'm addicted and can't wait for a new album to be announced. Every song is great but look especially at Jesus Walks, School Spirit, and Family Business.
B000002H6C|5.0|Im writing reviews in search of broadening my musical horizons so to speak. its time to ditch the blink and killswitch and move on to the wide world of music. I grew up in Washington so i do love the alternative music. I hope i don't end up in the same category either. <br /> <br />and so it is. what a lot of listeners would call the last great metallica album. the next album would be the final seal to the death of '80s metal. and all fans would have left is: \\"...And Justice for All\\". It would be trivial to talk about where i heard of metallica first. if you know about rock and roll chances are metallica is etched into your head. But if you want to find out about metallica then you will soon find out that there are two metallicas. the first: hard hitting, complex solos, beer filled wretched screaming and the second: introspective sogwriting, groovier rhythms, ballads, and heavy slow paced chord progressions. This album is the apex of the first Metallica. Even though Master of Puppets or Ride the Lightning might be more popular few will admit that they were a piece of work as \\"... And Justice for all\\". very heavy, very fast but somehow still so intricate that it boggles the mind. James Hetfield completely changed his vocal style in this album to fit his natural voice. and it is very clear in \\"Blackened\\" the most groove based song. the rest of the album shreds you or gives you a piece of work that a dozen of musicians would have a hard time repeating. the CD track \\"... And justice for all\\", \\"One\\", and \\"Dyers Eve\\" all very very long and very much layered. Unlike Metallica's other contemporaries, these songs didnt try to go as fast as possible instead intrenched you slowly with its complexities. \\"One\\" starts out slow and changes its pace and then again changes and yet again changes, then it finally slows down. The solo work is very memorable and quite fun to listen to. The guitars are very unique. This is the song that influenced a thousand drummers to play double bass.and Headfields lyrics are pretty meaningful for maybe the first time. other than the masterpieces \\"The shortest straw\\", \\"Harvester of Sorrow\\", and \\"The Frayed ends of Sanity\\" all have heavy fast riffs and skillfull drum playing and Hetfields outrage over spanning social issues. these tracks kind of completely tried to say what some tracks on \\"Master of puppets\\" could not. \\"To live is to die\\" is my favorite track. and the reason is that it is a \\"kill 'em all\\" type song. But better. the chops are better, so is the structure, and lyrics. \\"To live is to die\\" completely is as fast and hard as any metallica song but keeping the quality of any \\"..And Justice for all\\" song. Maybe because this album is so overly intricate that the band simply overdrived and had to go to a different type of sound but to anybody who wants to find the finished product of \\"old metallica\\", get this album
B00008CLOA|5.0|This is one of the greatest albums in rock history and just music in general. On the charts for over 7 years now in its remastered glory. With touching lyrics, amazing music, captivating trippy, just downright amazing!!! Nothing else sounds like the Floyd, trust me! That is why I beg you buy this album if you have any music taste!
B0006A9FMI|5.0|While Akira may have brought the art of feature-film anime to the mass audience of the United States, Ghost in the Shell has become the standard anime film that all new films are measured against here in the US.  And if one stops from being a snob and takes into account that the Stand Alone Complex and 2nd Gig series are, yes, the same characters, but not the same storyline, then you will truly appreciate this movie and its predecessor.<br /><br />If you are new to the GITS films and perhaps watched the series, be happily warned: these films are much darker and require a lot more thought as well.  Not putting down the series at all there; I actually think that it is the most intelligent anime series ever released.<br /><br />You do not have to even be a fan of anime to appreciate these two films.  If you like sci-fi that tends to dabble into philosphy, then this is for you.  If you like action, guess what?  It's here too.<br /><br />You can't go wrong.
B0002OERI0|4.0|Let's leave aside the Punk credibility pissing contest for a moment. Green Day never claimed to be \\"punk\\" or anything else for that matter, so you kids can just shut up. No one cares that you can name-drop some strung out social rejects to prove your \\"real punkness\\". Who cares that the Misfits were better than Green Day? Maybe they were, but there were acts better than the Misfits too, does that make them bad? Just judge the album on it's own merits, not on some arbitrary definition of \\"punk\\". <br />As for this album, it demonstrates a real maturing on Green Days part, with actual harmonizing and a more complex and interesting structure than their standard three chord style. As for the lyrics, lets face it, Billy Joe will never be Saul Williams but his delivery is clean and unforced and his words have a sincerity of emotion and smirking humor that makes them enjoyable to listen to and easy for anyone whos ever been a teenager to relate to. <br />Green Day takes a lot of risks on this record, not only with the concept record format but with huge changes from their traditional style. \\"Give me Novacaine\\" brings to mind early Flaming Lips records and \\"Jesus of Suburbia\\" has a swinging old school feel to it (with even a touch of Queen, if you can imagine it) that sets the tone for the whole record. The final track, the wonderfully sad, longing \\"Whatsername\\" is quickly becoming one of my favorite Green Day songs. <br />  Some of the songs sound maybe to much like things Green Day has done before. But there's enough new stuff here to make me recommend it wholeheartedly, and not just to long time fans either.
B0002XVQNU|5.0|I was disappointed with the Theatrical Version - PG-13?? The comic was one of the darkest of Marvels line when I started reading Daredevil. And the Directors Cut brings that to light (pun intended). You should question just whether or not Matt Murdock is really a good guy or a bad guy... and in this version you do. Thanks for taking a so-so movie and making it into a Very Good movie instead!
1400032717|3.0|the curious incident of the dog in the night-time is kind of murder mystery <br />you can know from this book about who is murder and what is autistic <br />It is interesting but sometimes hard to understand such as science and math part <br />If you have a time to read I recommend this book <br />
B00004RF9I|4.0|I watched Network again last night, for the first time since the film first came out. I remembered that it was a good movie with a lot of good acting, but given that the things this film predicted about television have all come true - and been surpassed in spades - I was expecting that its indignation over the commercialization of television news would seem quaint and certainly dated.<br /><br />Good heavens, was I wrong. This movie hasn't lost its edge a bit in 30 years. William Holden as Max Schumacher is the only real human being, and he wanders through this film looking slack-jawed, as if he'd landed in Toon Town and can't quite believe his eyes. As it turns out, he has: the cartoonish, conniving antics of Robert Duvall and Faye Dunaway leave all of us laughing guiltily.<br /><br />The screenplay emphasizes the comic-strip nature of these characters by giving them dialog that no real human being could ever utter with a straight face. The one sex scene between Dunaway and Holden is one of the most horrifyingly hilarious moments I can remember from any film. Add Ned Beatty - who doesn't say much through most of the film, and then erupts like Lucky in \\"Waiting for Godot\\" with a single, five-minute monologue that will peel the paint off your walls - and this is one of the darkest, funniest films of the last 50 years.<br /><br />They should re-release this film in theaters. Especially now.
B0006419J6|5.0|Ok, so maybe this movie isn't exactly a \\"thinking person\\"'s film (although it does feature more of a conscience than most big-budget action flicks), and maybe it isn't faithful to the original story, and maybe the special effects are rather extraordinary.  Surprised?  After all, we're talking about a summer blockbuster, not an Oscar winner.<br /><br />That aside, \\"I, Robot\\" is a pretty enjoyable movie (that's how I judge films, by the way: whether or not they were enjoyable--I don't really care if they make me think too much; I wanna think, I'll open up my physics textbook).<br /><br />Will Smith delivers another superb performance as Spooner, a predictably old-fashioned cop living in--you guessed it--the future.  Robots, you see, have become a household necessity; Spooner doesn't have one because he doesn't trust them.  And this new model coming out...well, something about it just doesn't sit right with our hero.  Especially when one robot is suspected of murder.  If one robot can kill a person...what about these thousands of new robots hitting the market...<br /><br />Asimov's stories were definitely more philisophical than this film; however, standing on its own, \\"I, Robot\\" is a great action flick.  Not the deepest movie to come along, and it sure has a lot of male bravado and over-the-top special effects...but if you're still reading this review, that's probably the type of movie you want.  Yeah, it's an underrated flick...which means it's much better than what you've heard.  \\"I, Robot\\" is a great movie for cuddling up on the sofa and sharing some buttery popcorn.  Hmmm...I'm getting in the mood to watch it again!
B00005JMX6|3.0|The Girl Next Door, which reminds me of Pretty Woman at times, is a rather uneven romance story about two a teenager and a slightly older former porn actress.  It's pretty predictable as are all Hollywood productions these days.  Much of the time the movie is kind of cute, and you can't help but feel for the hero Matthew.  But both the storyline and the acting are inconsistent, and in the end the movie feels rather old and flaccid (no pun intended).<br /><br />I'm not sure how this unrated version compared to the theatrical-release R version, since I didn't see the film in a movie house.  But if you had high hopes for for steamy nude scenes of Elisha, you'll be sorely disappointed.  To me this is just a regular R movie.
B0001ENY6M|4.0|While this isn't something that you would sit down and listen to over and over again,  the score to THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST does suit the movie and gives you a feeling of the biblical events taking place within the movie.  It is a pleasent listen if you want to listen to something that is kind of soothing or calming.  4 stars.
1582432678|3.0|This book gives people named Kevin a bad name, but that's not why I wasn't crazy about it.  I got about a quarter of the way into the book and then I realized it was going to be a long, long slog until the end.  I'm not sure exactly why author Shriver is telling her story in epistolary form, but it doesn't work.  Franklin, who Eva addresses in her letters, already knows half the things she painstakingly writes out to him, it's the clumsiest exposition I've seen in quite a while.  I know others have argued that Eva is not really writing to Franklin but more to herself, but in that case why not make it a diary, the whole device smacks of the kind of thing novelists used to write when they hoped their book would be featured on the Oprah Winfrey program.  Now that Oprah has turned her attention to the classics, perhaps contemporary fiction will turn away from the marketing principles on which it is currently organized.<br /><br />Other reviewers have suggested that perhaps Shriver knows a \\"Kevin\\" (i.e. a sociopath) or has personally had the misfortune of knowing someone like that in her own family or among her circle of acquaintances.  I hope not, but in any case I don't think so, the whole thing smacks of research to me.  But perhaps she did know someone named \\"Kevin\\" who did her wrong when she was a girl or something.<br /><br />It is a bitter, twisted, curiously compelling novel but it is much longer than it has to be.  I don't mind books being long, but come on, Alice Munro could have told this story in 30 pages and it would have been great.
B00008PC2O|3.0|I was about to buy this disk when I did some more research on high-definition DVDs and learned from a report from Sander Sassen of the Netherlands at the Hardware Analysis site that the high definition version of this disk requires (a) the installation of a separate piece of digital rights software, called Interactual Player, (b) an internet connection to the Interactual license server, and (c) an IP address that the license server believes is in the United States or Canada.  And then the license you get is good only for four days.  It is possible to get around issue (c) by using an anonymous proxy server in the United States, such as the proxy for free site.   <br /> <br />In addition to the licensing requirements, the HD version requires Windows Media Player Version 9, which is included with Windows XP. <br /> <br />The movie, T2, is an absolute must see for any sci-fi fan, but you probably already knew that.
068987474X|4.0|After reading this book, I was like, \\"duh\\".  Even though common sense tells us something is not right, sometimes us girls like to make things much more complicated than they really are.  We start the \\"what-if's\\" and the \\"maybe this or that\\" when really guys make it pretty clear.  Sometimes we get fuzzy and lose our focus and think we are being crazy or over emotional. <br /> <br /> <br />Greg simplifies situations by stripping away all of the emotions and excuses and laying it on the line. This book is simplistic and maybe overly so, however it gives good advice for those just needing a nudge in the right direction.  Not for serious or complicated relationships, but it makes you think about the past and all that wasted time on insignificant boys.
B0002Z9HT8|2.0|In 1985 Bob Geldoff got a bunch of really good artists and a bunch of really bad artists together for a concert to help Africas starving, a good cause but the concert has too many bad performances from the always bad recording artists like Phil Collins, Alison Moyet, Wham, Sade and Ultravox and not enough good performances from the always good ones like Sting, Queen, The Who and David Bowie. The result is that this (too pop) music concert is not worth owning unlike better concerts of multiple artists like Festival Express, Rock And Roll Circus and The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert. Its too much like Dead Aid then Live Aid.
B0006284JQ|1.0|Britney exists! And are we happy? No! Sorry but she is as good as Evanescence (good grief!!!)! Britney, Mika Jacka and Evanescennnnnce... are singers that prove that the incompetence and greed of today's Music Industry is matched only by the base stupidity and low standards of today's mass music audiences and listeners!
B00009L1TA|4.0|I love action movies with a twist. I enjoyed \\"The Recruit\\" because even though it twisted and turned it never kept me in the dark. You best be on your toes here or you will miss some important clues. I had trouble catching some of the clues the first time I watched it. Being a Travolta and Jackson fan I expected a great deal, and I got it. I follow detective series all the time and I usually know whose guilty long before the end. This one kept me guessing who was a killer and who wasn't. When a group of soldiers is dropped in a jungle on a training mission only two get back alive. Travolta is asked to investigate by the Colonel running the base where the men were being trained. The investigation leads to killings and drugs. Be prepared to be thrilled and stumped. If you haven't figured it out by the end they will paint a clearer picture of what the unit Section 8 really is doing. One thing that would have helped me during my first viewing of the movie was something to indicate that maybe those supposedly killed might not be. I think there should have been some kind of hint, but otherwise a great story. I added this to my collection because it definitely is one you will want to watch regularly. The quality of the DVD is excellent and it has commentary and other extras.
B000002UJQ|5.0|This album simply put is a masterpiece of sound.  Can't get enough.  If you like the standard radio crap playing, be aware that if you buy this you might not quite \\"get it\\".
0767803434|4.0|It sad how everyone tries to politicize what is essentially a popcorn-drenched exercise in entertainment. This President is loving, compassionate and tough. No matter what your political bent, isn't that what we're all looking for? A president who lives, and acts by his own convictions?<br /><br />But that's not true is it?<br /><br />This is a dumb, but very fun, action picture with a preposterous premise. The script ain't great. The acting, however, is really top-notch, in the fact that you buy into all of it. I couldn't imagine the film working at all with out Ford and Oldman.<br /><br />It's not supposed to be any sort of comment on the current state of world affairs, how could it be? It was made YEARS before the WTC attack. You have to look at it as a personal story. It takes the inherant drama of a man with power being placed in a position where it means nothing, the ratcheting it up by placing what he holds most dear in jeopardy.<br /><br />Yes, symbolism abounds, but when the most powerful man in the world is the President of the United States, how can it not? But watch how the film spends more time on what he is NOT, which is superhuman, rather than what he is.
B00005RYKU|5.0|THE GLASS HOUSE is metaphorically interesting:  not only is the physical building mostly glass, but the owners of the house are Terry and Erin Glass.  Into this pristine setting come two youngsters whose parents were tragically killed in an automobile accident.  In their will, they stated they wanted their old friends, the Glasses, to look after them.  All is not what it seems at first and soon a more incendiary plot is revealed.<br /><br />What I really liked most about this film is the precisioned and passionated performance by Leelee Sobieski (Joy Ride).  This young actress is not only a lovely woman, but she seemed to understand the nuances of her role and even as it plummets into shameless melodrama by the end, Leelee stays with it and elevates it above what it could have been under someone else's control.  Diane Lane foreshadowed her work in UNFAITHFUL in her role as the addicted physician, although her role gets backseat most of the time.  Young Trevor Morgan is very good as the eleven year old, and Stellan Skarsgard, while menacing and vile, never seemed to fully show us his greed and nastiness.  Cameo-type roles are taken by Chris Noth as the children's distant uncle; and Michael O'Keefe and an uncredited Rita Wilson as the doomed parents.<br /><br />Moody and manipulative, THE GLASS HOUSE nonetheless entertains and it's mostly because of Leelee.
B00009P1O2|3.0|In the mid 1980s Freddie Mercury contracted what would later be diagnosed as aids and his health began to fail. Mercurys voice was allready damaged as a result of smoking coupled with exaustion from heavy touring. Queen had taken a 1983 break from touring because of voice problems from Freddie as well as for a break from constant touring with the hopes of coming back and playing to the end of their career but that did not happen. Mercurys abilities as a showman were compromised, the band was tired and they chose initially a longer break of 3 years after the final show of thier 1986 tour at Knebworth Park. That never happened as Freddie collapsed after a Solo Concert in 1988 and was diagnosed with aids. With Mercury no longer able to perform properly Live as a Frontman for his safety and popularity Queen stopped touring live for good. Live At Wembley captures Queen during the 1986 tour, a time when Queen were at thier worst as a Live Band but still gave thier all and its decent under the circumstances, Freddies weaker voice and moving about less, simpler 80s songs with a offstage/onstage musician used quite a bit and a silly medley of songs.
1400032717|5.0|I'm a ESL school student and this book is my reading class's textbook.  I'm so glad I had a chance  to understand autistic people's thinking.   It's a very amazing experience.

B000000HZT|4.0|Like one of the reviewers below, I too am old enough to have listened to a lot of prog music over the years. I'm also a big Genesis fan (up to Wind & Wuthering)- Selling England By The Pound is still my number one favorite album of all time ever - and I'm old enough to have bought this album when it was first released in 1979/1980. All I can say is that if you like old Genesis, you will love this CD (notice I didn't say \\"album' this time). Do your self a favor, put this on the player, turn the lights down, recline, and remember why you love music and its power to communicate with your soul.<br /><br />Now as for the vocals of Kim Beacon, I must say I've always truly enjoyed the singing on this album/CD. There's something unique about Kim's delivery that really works for this project. For God's sake, this man can really sing; he doesn't soar, but he does have soul - he reminds me a little of the vocalist from Bad Company - it's not like you're being asked to listen to a favorite Genesis or Yes guitarist sing or something (which out of love I will dutifully do). All kidding aside, these vocals have a depth and soul all their own, which I have always enjoyed. I don't want it to be something it's not. Appreciate it for what it is.
B00005JN4O|5.0|A film by Marc Forster<br /><br />J.M Barrie (Johnny Depp) is something of a failed playwright.  His latest play has just flopped on opening night.  The audience was bored and left the theatre saying how dreadful it was.  His relationship with his wife, Mary (Radha Mitchell) is chilly and loveless.  But James Barrie still has an incredibly fertile imagination, turning the mundane into something more spectacular and wondrous, if only in his mind.  While writing in a park James encounters the Davies family with one of the boys lying under the bench Barrie is sitting on.  This boy is pretending to have been imprisoned by the king, George (Nick Roud), who is really just his older brother.  Barrie, unlike what most adults would do, plays right along with the scene and tries to bargain young Michael (Luke Spill) out of jail.  Immediately Barrie seems to form a friendship with the family, performing a little play with his dog for the family, which includes the mother Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (Kate Winslet) and her other two sons Peter (Freddie Highmore) and Jack (Joe Prospero).  Barrie spends more and more time with the Davies, befriending Sylvia and playing make believe with the children.  From this relationship we see instances of Barrie's imagination taking hold and the creation of aspects of \\"Peter Pan\\".<br /><br />Three of the boys join in and play every game with James Barrie, but young Peter does not.  Still grieving and resentful at the death of his father, Peter will not play.  In talking with James, however, Peter starts to come out of his shell.  It is clear that this friendship, which is entirely innocent of anything romantic (in the case of Sylvia) or otherwise is of great comfort both to the Davies family as well as to James Barrie.  There is conflict, of course.  Sylvia's mother, Mrs Emma Du Maurier (Julie Christie) disapproves because of Barrie's behavior but also because she feels that the friendship will only cause a scandal and ruin any chance of Sylvia's being able to remarry into \\"Society\\".  Barrie, of course, is married.  This is the other major conflict.  Mary is resentful of the time Barrie spends away from her, but it is also clear that their relationship is not working even before he met Sylvia and her family.  They were already sleeping in separate bedrooms (though that may have been a cultural thing, I am not sure).<br /><br />While all of this is happening, the producer of Barrie's plays, Charles Frohman (Dustin Hoffman) is trying to get Barrie's new play financed and is very worried when he sees what it is.  It is a play about fairies and children with an alligator and a grown man who must dress up in a dog costume.  Since these plays are shown to the \\"High Society\\", it is a play destined to flop.  Coming from the twenty first century, we also know it is destined to become a classic in \\"Peter Pan\\".<br /><br />Rated PG, \\"Finding Neverland\\" is a wonderful family film.  In fact, that is the exact word that came to mind as I walked out of the theatre: Wonderful.  There is truly a sense of wonder about J.M. Barrie and his imagination which created Neverland.  His friendship with the Davies comes off as genuine and heartfelt and entirely natural.  Johnny Depp's performance carries the movie, though Winslet and the four children are also to be commended for how well \\"Finding Neverland\\" has turned out.  Depp is much more restrained here than in most of his other movie, but he still is able to shine through with a quirkly personality that feels appropriate to Barrie.  \\"Finding Neverland\\" is a very imaginative movie, beautifully shot, with enough scenes of Barrie's imagination to override what could have otherwise been a drab London.  This is clearly one of the best movies of the year.<br /><br />-Joe Sherryvia's being able to remarry into \\"Society\\".  Barrie, of course, is married.  This is the other major conflict.

B00005JMXX|3.0|Paleoclimatologist Dennis Quaid has a bad feeling about global warming. He spends a lot of time attending conferences and trying to warn people that the human race is eventually gonna get wiped out by a new ice age. But even paleoclimatologist Dennis Quaid can't predict that it's gonna to happen the day after tomorrow! Yikes!<br /><br />Even worse than the world ending the day after tomorrow is paleoclimatologist Dennis Quaid's son, Jake Gyllenhaal, is in NYC for a school activity and he hasn't had a chance to knock boots with supersexy Emmy Rossum yet. Ohhh, the humanity! Is there no God?!!! Multiple hailstorms, tornadoes, tidal waves, supercooled superstorms and wolf attacks later Jake is trapped in NYC and it's up to paleoclimatologist Dennis Quaid to come save him.<br /><br />And, of course, he does. Oops! Did I ruin the ending for you? I'm sorry. One of the things that gets old in these disaster movies is no matter what, no matter even if you have a superstorm the size of Australia breathing right down your neck the hero always seems to live through it all with only a few scratches to show for their troubles. I guess that's what's expected, but still it'd be nice if every once and awhile somebody despite total strangers and the heroic must-sacrifice-myself-to-save-the-lives-of-others buddy of the main character died.<br /><br />Still, despite the \\"we've already seen this stuff a million times before\\" script TDAT is entertaining. The CG destruction looks nice, the pace is quick, Jake Gyllenhaal proves that even with a lame script he's still a good actor, Emmy Rossum's smile created such a warming glow in my loins that it could've thawed out a woolly mammoth's carcass from 60 paces, ice age-proof wolves, paleoclimatologist Dennis Quaid, that guy from \\"Riptide\\" as the President, Ian Holm's in a role that is beneath his talents and a completely unexpected Friedrich Nietzsche reference...wow. Halfhearted recommendation.Hall - Jake Gyllenhaal (OCTOBER SKY, DONNIE DARKO) <br />
B000077VPU|4.0|In the mid 80s Queen hit a brick wall. Freddie Mercury had contracted aids and smoking had ruined his voice and exausted him along with Queens constant touring. The rest of the band was fatigued too and needed a break so that they could come back strong. Queen decided that they would stop touring in the summer of 1986 for just a few years and Freddie quit smoking after the Knebworth show in august to save his voice. Then something happened, Freddie found out he had aids in 1988 and Queen were forced (for his weakening strengh and health) to stop performing Live. But after Mercurys death they wanted a tribute for him and here it is, a live album with mostly good talents performing along with Queens survivers and some of the stuffs a real godsend, the only Live versions of songs like The Show Must Go On and Innuendo as well as The Show Must Go On.
B0002F6BRE|4.0|I saw this with my entire family and everyone loved it. We've bought the DVD. I have read some professional reviews blasting the film as everything from dumb to creepy (Creepy because a man (Will Ferrel) that old acting the way he does.  Excuse me, knock, knock, hello McFly anyone home?  The character was raised by ELVES!)  I say look at the box office receipts of many films that professional critics have chewed up.  You find they are inversly proportional.  The bottom line is context.  If you still have enough of an inner-child to accept the base storyline, this film is good.  It will make you laugh, cry and everything in between.  If you cannot accept the premise of the story then stay away.
B00000273M|4.0|I have no additions to the reviews being written but only one thing. The greatest track of this album is FOLLOWING. Great track to play on a proper HIFI set!
1400032717|1.0|I had high expectations for this book, I really did. It did have a great cover. However, it was bad. The big joke was the back cover comparing the book as similar to Catcher in the Rye. The only thing similar to that book was that the narrator talked directly to the reader. That's about all the similarities I saw. Seriously people, if you're getting this book to find out more about autism, just rent rainman and save yourself some time. <br /> <br />Towards the end of this book I was just thinking to myself: \\"Get on with it, I get it, he has autism.\\" Don't waste your time on this. It's an example of manufactured hype. This is my first book from the \\"Today Show Book Club.\\" If they liked this, it will be my last.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I um, use this CD to help me sleep. It's wonderful. Cheaper and more healthy than those pills.
B000083C49|1.0|If it were possible I would give this film a negative 3 in review as for it is truly a bastardization of everything that makes Trek. The story/screenplay seems like it was written by tree-hugging hippies or enviromentalist extremists with a touch of utterly absurd and boring comedy. Let's put Shatner and the crew travelling back to the 20th century 80's decate and have them save humpback whales so a probe from an unknown place doesn't destroy our planet. Gee, I wonder how much weed these guys smoke before writing this [sarcasm] appealing [/sarcasm] story. If the entire screenplay were written on toilet paper I wouldn't consider cleaning myself with it because it would probably infest me. The touch of comedy only makes this an extremely pathetic film and one that should have never existed. I hate this film so much that I have all other 9 Trek films (up to Nemesis) and I never intent on buying this movie even if it came on a \\"Widescreen Director's Cut DVD Unlimited Edition for $2.99\\". <br /> <br />Final Note: Apparently this film is very popular among non-trekkies and people who don't appreciate true science fiction so if you are one of them you might mildly enjoy this film, however this is NOT Trek, it should HAD NEVER BEEN, and let's all try to live thinking in our minds that this crap never existed. <br />Remember now: there are 9 Star Trek films NOT 10 :).
B000002U88|5.0|By the early '80s, Bob Seger had established himself as a firm proponent of the guitar-heavy, rhythmically driven, classic-rock school of American music.  Many consider The Distance to be his final album in that vein, and what a heck of an album it is.  This is one to pop in the CD player when you first get in the car and just drive, drive, drive.  This album demonstrates all of the musical categories Seger created for himself and went on to dominate.  The pure, guitar-driven rockers \\"Even Now\\" and \\"Makin' Thunderbirds,\\" two of Seger's most compelling tunes, start out the album; the latter hearkens back to the Chuck Berry sound he so assiduously assimilated in his earlier days, while the former represents the apex of the Bob Seger sound he went on to create.  \\"Boomtown Blues\\" powers on in a similar vein, although it slows things down slightly to create (true to its name) a more bluesy feel.  \\"Shame on the Moon,\\" \\"Love's the Last to Know\\" and \\"Comin' Home\\" showcase another famous side of Seger's talent:  the simple, soulful, almost country ballad in the style of \\"We've Got Tonight.\\"  \\"Roll Me Away,\\" on the other hand, foreshadows a genre Seger would turn to with increasing frequency later in his career:  the \\"rock tale.\\"  Here it's a story of a love that died as abruptly as it began, couched within the larger framework of one man's journey to find himself.  Lyrically, it's an irresistibly compelling song--although it's admittedly pretty easy to miss the lyrics if you're focusing on the great beat (as I've been guilty of doing).  This album has everything that makes Seger great:  the simplicity and easy accessibility, the inspired lyrics, and--above all--that great Heart of America sound.  It's one of his best efforts and a worthy addition to your collection.
B00004SAAY|5.0|This set offers unbeatable value. The performances are uniformly excellent. Pinnock's Bach is brisk and sprightly when it should be, but also tender and relaxed when it must be. He is not afraid to slow down and savour the music, unlike many period-performance specialists. He is one of the world's great harpsichordists and his partners in the multiple concerti are also excellent. Simon Standage yields nothing to better-known soloists in the violin concerti.  <br /> <br />The sound is clear, deep, and only a little bit on the bright side. <br /> <br />While you're at it, buy the Pinnock/English Concert complete Mozart symphonies. Sure, Mozart's first fifteen or so aren't anything special, but the set is superb and the price unbelievable.
B0001HAHXW|1.0|Mr. Clapton or who should be refered to as Mr. CRAPton, after listing to this CD should personaly refund everyone's money. My question to Eric, why do you think you can sing the blues?  The picture of you inside the cover with a strained look on your face must be you listening to this CD that's how I looked when listening to it also.
1400032717|4.0|Priceless experience! Let's start you new vision from this book. Who know ? Maybe a simple life story from one boy will match your life. this book will give you a new crative ways to rethink of your life. <br />   truly, I learn a lot of from this book. Sometimes I felt so afraid when I found some part of myself  like him! who know? Maybe you will find yourself in him and learn a lot from him too. I really recommend! Espacially all mathematics. <br />
B0000019PA|5.0|This album has created it's own world and it's own sound.  It's an odd but endearing listening experience that makes me feel the way reading Geek Love made me feel.  The album seems to have it's own history and it's own future, and while you are listening to it, you become one of it's privledged carnies.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Green Day's style has obviously gone more mainstream.  So if you're a punk fan elitist, you'll hate this album.  I'm not a Bush supporter so I think the concept is great.  But even putting politics aside, it's handsdown one of the best rock albums of the year - right up there with Velvet Revolver.  There's a lot of emotion and effort put into the song writing and it shows.  Just about every song will get stuck in your head as it's just as catchy as Dookie. <br /> <br />My favorite tracks so far are Jesus of Suburbia (9 min), She's a Rebel and Letterbomb.  I can't stop listening to this album!
B0001WANCM|5.0|Field of Dreams is an incredible movie.  It is about the importance and timeliness of belief and hope and family and even baseball.  It has a fine cast with Kevin Costner, Ray Liotta, James Earl Jones and Burt Lancaster and Amy Madigan who all work so well together.  This is also one of a handful of movies that is even better then the book. <br /> <br />I also agree with and want to thank a prior reviewer who suggested keeping your old Field of Dreams DVD (mine is the Collectors Edition) and buying the new two DVD version (rather than trading the older version for the newer one).  The extras on both are great.  I especially loved the deleted scenes included in the new version as well as a piece on how people still visit the field where the movie was made.  Still, The Making of Field of Dreams on the earlier DVD, which is not included in the new version, taught me much about the movie and movie making and added to my appreciation of the movie.  If you can--keep both copies in your DVD library.      <br />
B0002OERI0|4.0|I USED to listen to Green Day. I bought Dookie soon after it was released and listened to it endlessly (maybe a little too much...), after that their albums went down hill and I thought that I would never listen to Green Day again... I was wrong! While this album is not perfect, demonstrated by the four stars (I'd give it 4.5), it is very very good. I was especially impressed by the operatic 'Jesus of Suburbia', which tells you a lot about the soul of America right now. Of course the title track and 'Boulevard...' are quite good as well, but if you listen to radio you should know that. 'Are We Waiting' is awesome! The punk tracks fit well within the more anthem like tracks and overall create a very layered and deep album. I was less impressed with the second operatic, 'Wake Me When September Comes', but it didn't detract too much from the overall appeal. So basically, if this album could get a long time Green Day-phobe back to listening to them again it must be good!
B000002J1O|5.0|I just Bought this album about a week ago. And Like I was saying....it's all subjective. A previous reviewer was saying how 'The Battle of Epping Forest' was an inferior peice of music from 'Moonlit Night' and 'Cinema Show'. Ironically, I get a unique pleasure listening to \\"The Battle\\". It's got a very interesting structure to it. And some very picturesk lyrics...though not always pleasant(\\"with a chain flyin' round his head). And there is just something cool(and unique) about the way it repeats the \\"Picnic\\" part after coming from the strange interlude about a Preist(which I still don't understand). But...I will in time I am sure. The Weakest track for me is the \\"More Fool me\\" cut. BTW...here's how I'd rate them... <br /> <br /> <br />Dancing with the Moonlit Night:  5/5  <br />(hard to describe how good this one is... I especially like the strange sounds and note choices on the outro section...very timeless...alluring and beautiful...just hard to describe) <br /> <br /> <br />I know what I like in your Wardrobe:  5/5 <br />(I love the white noise sound it begins with...it sounds like the sun beating down :) very unique...therefore hard to describe. The lyrics are funny and very affective. \\"had to thank old miss Mort for schooling a failure\\", \\"Keep them Mowing Blades Sharp\\", \\"Me, I'm just a lawnmower, you can tell me by the way I walk\\". <br /> <br /> <br />Firth of Fifth  5/5(This contains one of the best Guitar sections I have ever heard and also some of the best chord changes/lyrics and melodies I have heard: Paino Prelude, March, Slow down, March,  Piano(with siren sound), flute section, Brilliant change to piano, whole bad joins to play reprise of Piano Intro, brilliant change to a restrained guitar solo, a reprise back to flute solo in brilliant fashion(played with guiar this time), back to march...then ends brilliantly the way it started(sound a tad warped). <br /> <br /> <br />More Fool Me:  3.5/5 (A unique love song...but it's just not my style..I don't skipit though) <br /> <br /> <br />Battle of Epping Forest:  5/5(hmmm, where do I start? Too long for me to explain...just listen to it several times. I just love when they repeat \\"Got me framed\\" in high pitch, then how they repeat the picnic part so far from oneanother(this is some unique songwriting). And also the repition of \\"here come the calvalry\\" just seems so unique yet appropriate. The interlude explaining the priest still baffles me, but I still like it(I love how he talks some of the lines and the rest of the music seems like it's off synch on purpose...it just sounds so unique and alluring). And the part when the battle is over is just brilliant. You must listen to this one the most to understand it(I still don't understand it all). <br /> <br /> <br />After the Ordeal:  4.5/5 <br />(starts slow(approprietly) but picks up mid-way with some nice harmonies ...gotta love that guitar harmony it ends with) <br />  <br /> <br />The Cinema Show:  5/5 <br />(very unique vocal melodies. brilliant progressions with synth solo) <br /> <br /> <br />The Asle of Plenty:  5/5(short but poweful reprise back to beginning and to a vocal mood piece...very unique).  <br /> <br /> <br />Ok, I think I am done. That was too much for me too type. I think that's all I need to say.

B00003CX97|5.0|grunts a soldier from the British Army after Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guiness) has returned to lead them in their labors.  Having spent several days in isolation from the tyrannical Saito (Sessue Hayakawa) because Nicholson would not let his officers work manual labor on the bridge, a bridge Saito is charged with having finished by mid May.  The first hour of the film is a battle of wills between the two men, the last 90 minutes deals with the bridge itself and its place in the war.  Eventually a team is sent in to detonate the bridge, leading to one of the most exciting climax scenes in the history of film.   <br /> <br />The movie is presented here in a two disc set which features an excellent transfer as well as some great behind the scenes material you will find interesting.  The package includes a short booklet detailing the challenges the filmmakers encountered while making the movie, including weather problems, difficulties with casting, and the actual set with the bridge itself, one of the most fascinating sights ever.  The story about the destruction of the bridge is incredible, some of the details you don't see on screen. <br /> <br />As a film the casting and story are impeccable.  Guiness is perfect as the stone faced Col. Nicholson, who honors the British army and their capability over anything else, which leads him to some rather questionable decisions while in command.  Hayakawa is strong and convincing as the Japanese commander who rules with a desperate iron fist, as he is up against a deadline.  William Holden stars as the only American in the movie, who escapes the camp and later becomes an integral part of the final plan (against his will).  All three are fantastic.  This is a movie I can watch at any time, repeatedly.  One of the best purchases I have ever made.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Fahrenheit 9/11: <br /> <br />1. This movie begins with the 2000 election and how members of the Black caucus were not allowed to object to George W. Bush becoming President.  Also protests during the 2001 inauguration which we were not shown on any of our TV stations. <br /> <br />2.  Then it is about Bush's business ventures and his family and associate links between the Saudis.  (This movie touches the tip of the iceberg - House of Bush, House of Saud or Dude, Where's my Country are highly recommended) <br /> <br />3.  Fear used by the media and government to promote the Iraq war.   <br /> <br />4.  How are civil liberties are being taken away. An old man is questioned by the FBI for merely saying that he does not agree with President Bush.  A peace group is infiltrated. <br /> <br />5.  If we want to stop terrorism - we should start with our country first.  We are shown the awful excuse for homeland security in Oregon. <br /> <br />6.  A little snippet of Iraq before we invaded. <br /> <br />7.  Soldiers, their pay cuts, disabilities.   <br /> <br />Overall this movie shows us stuff that our media is either to lazy or too scared to show us.  Please don't think that this is a movie which bashes Bush. You will be missing out tremendously by not seeing this documentary.  The most important part of this film, in my opinion, was the last 5 minutes. When I saw this movie for the first time, I did not understand what the heck Mr. Moore was trying to get at in his narrative towards the end.  The second time I saw this movie, I finally understood what he meant/ and what point he was trying to make. I'm not going to ruin that part for you. Trust me, if you really, I mean REALLY want to support our troops - do not miss this movie!
B00028HBKM|5.0|It is hard to review a movie that is either loved or hated. Reading through the negative reviews most of it was degrading and rather common place bashing, yet some of the negative reviews raise some important points (And I'm not only referring to the gore here) and some of these do more good than a fanatic review. Yet, as a Christian myself, I know I cannot judge this movie without ever looking at my own belief. I was on the way of becoming an atheist and completely lost my faith in God when my mother got cancer and battled it for years. Yet she, the one who was really suffering, took great comfort from praying, reading the gospels and so on. It was this very disturbing experience (My mother's painful death) that made me think. And then I heard about this upcoming movie... The rest is history. <br />Well, for starters, Jesus HAS lived on this earth and was crucified as several Roman historians and more prove. I encourage everyone to watch the BBC Production of \\"Jesus from Nazareth\\" for an IMHO historical and rather rational view on the most loved or hated man that ever lived. An great addition would also be the German \\"2000 Jahre Christentum\\" which can be bought on Amazon.de. Now what happened after Golgotha is up to what you believe or not. But I would never dare to ridicule someone for believing in whatever he chooses because faith is something very personal. That is why reviews that attack those who believe in Christ disturbed me more than the movie. If logic rules the world: Why would those sarcastic atheists even bother to watch a movie on a person they do not respect?  <br />As for Antisemitism, I saw none of it. The Romans were portrayed as bloodhounds, not the Jews. And remember, Jesus himself was a Jew. And just because some weren't good people doesn't condemn an entire people, I believe that if we're as smart as some reviewers who cried \\"Antisemitism!\\" proclaim we are, we should be past that. There are not so good Americans, Austrians, Australians, Chineseas well as not so good Jews. We're all fallible, aren't we? Just as not all the Germans were not has horrific as movies like \\"Schindler's List\\" or \\"Hasenjagd\\" portrayed the really evil ones, not ALL the Jews were good or bad either. There are black sheep everywhere. Why does something that common place even have to be explained? The whole movie wouldn't work if ALL the Jews had wanted Jesus to live, just as \\"Schindler's List\\" wouldn't work if ALL the Germans had opposed Hitler's scheme. (I'm not comparing the holocaust to Jesus' Passion, I'm merely trying to explain why it wouldn't be plausible in another way) What am I saying? Don't regard a movie just as either Black or White. This movie, with all its crude gore, doesn't white-wash anything as much as it doesn't blacken history. It is realistic, painful to watch and made me throw up more than once. <br />It's not entertainment but a reminder of what has been and what has been played down in most versions on Christ's life, esp. \\"King of Kings\\" and \\"The Greatest Story ever told\\". An example of \\"playing down\\" would be how Caesar's murder has been put on film numerous times. Most of these neither follow the historian's GORY descriptions nor do they dare to show what is described in all its gruesome details. The closest version to the actual event as described is the mini-series with Jeremy Sisto as Caesar but even that one is \\"easy on the eyes\\". Now \\"The Passion\\" shows that Jesus didn't die as \\"beautifully\\" as the famous paintings made us think he did. It was gruesome, gory, inhuman, sweaty, dirty, swollen, bloody, ripped... you name it.  <br />As for the movie's power: The score alone is enough to go straight to the heart. There are several gems of masterful directing in this movie that I won't ever forget. (Such as the \\"Ecce homo!\\") Which brings me to the subject of Mel Gibson: Neither the sad fact that Mel's father denies the holocaust (A belief Mel does NOT share and shouldn't be condemned for) nor his personal life or opinions on women's rights or whatever should influence your judgement. What did one NEGATIVE reviewer ask for? An IMPARTIAL view.  <br />Now would I ever watch this movie again? No. I cannot bear it. THe experience is unlike any other. It rips you apart, each lash has the power of a stabbing dagger. The gruesome details are too much to stomach. But I'm glad I had the courage to watch it. I'm glad for it as a Christian for this vivid presentation of HIS suffering I have realised that whatever makes me feel \\"blue\\" is nothing compared to real suffering. Codemn my belief all you like but I cannot disregard this film and its influence in a positive way. HIS message was love. And atheist or Christian, that doesn't sound like a bad idea. This movie's power and controversy cannot be denied, it already has a lot more reviews than classics like \\"Gone With The Wind\\". Like many other things it brings out the very best or the worst in everyone.
B00000253N|5.0|On Blood On the Tacks Bob Dylan returned to his folk/acoustic roots and produced an album of incredible majesty. The lyrics are not as full of imagery as some of his earlier works but the language is straightforward and goes right for the juglar. There are so many memorable passages that I won't quote the songs in this review. I'd rather just say that for me these songs contain an astonishing level of insight on life, love, human nature, and lonelyness. Even the more lighthearted Lily, Rosemary and The Jack Of Hearts is inhabited by characters that are remarkably well drawn in what is almost a condensed novel put to music.<br /><br />I won't say that this is the Best Dylan album, since that is largely a matter of taste. It is however an album that I could not be without.
0061015725|4.0|Michael Crichton is undoubtedly one of the great popular novelists of our time, and Prey is a fine work of craft by a fine craftsperson. In the classic vein of reluctant hero meets technology gone mad, Prey leads the reader on a thrilling adventure. The writing is crisp and clear, and filled with suspense. <br /> <br />As always, much of the science sounds much better than it really is, but that, I suppose, has to be expected. The less you know about computer science and nanotechnology, the more you will be impressed by Crichton's way of blending bits and pieces of real science into something monstrous. The fact that none of it could ever work out that way doesn't matter. It probably never stopped anyone from loving the \\"Frankenstein\\" story, (or any of Crichton's other techno-thrillers), and shouldn't stop you from enjoying Prey. <br /> <br />That said, if you are looking for a story that is as original as the technology this story tries to portray, you should look for an author who hasn't yet established such a distinctive style, and perhaps one who is not so studied in the tried and true techniques for writing a hero's journey. I found myself flashing back to Jurassic Park constantly while reading Prey. So in a way I got to read two stories at once, one new, and one well over a decade old. And I loved it.
B00005JNLY|4.0|I don't particularly love Adam Sandler's comedies. Fortunately, \\"Spanglish\\" is not one of them! It's more of a James L. Brooks movie. Once again, he writes, directs and produces, as he did with the classic \\"Terms of Endearment\\" back in 1983, and more recently, with \\"As Good as It Gets\\".<br /><br />Sandler plays John Clasky, a renowned chef who is in the prime of his professional career. He's the classic \\"good guy\\", who loves his family and keeps a great balance between the time he devotes to work and the time with his kids. Plus he loves his insecure wife Deborah, played by Tea Leoni (Deep Impact, The Family Man), one wacky lady who has put her career on hold to raise her family.<br /><br />Complementing the cast is Paz Vega, who broke into international stardom playing Lucia in \\"Sex and Lucia\\". She plays Flor (with rolled \\"R\\" at the end), a protective Mexican mom who wants to stay as close as possible to her native Mexican values, even while living in the heart of L.A., cleaning and cooking for the Clasky family.<br /><br />While the plot does lead into some predictable events (don't mean to spoil the story for you), this is not your \\"typical\\" Adam Sandler movie. As a matter of fact, some of the most hilarious moments are not courtesy of the legend from \\"The Wedding Singer\\" and Saturday Night Live, but rather the result of the head-on encounter of two cultures, where no side can speak the other's language or easily understand each other's motivations.<br /><br />With a balance between humor and drama that is preserved throughout most of the plot, the movie stands a good chance of being almost as popular as \\"My Big Fat Greek Wedding\\" was a back in 2002.
B00005JNEI|1.0|Just make sure if you see this movie, which does make some interesting points, (particularly the segment about how fear has affected our society,) to go rent or buy FAHRENHYPE 9/11 immediately afterwards...it will clear up all the \\"questions\\" Michael Moore asks during this propaganda ridden piece of trash.<br /><br />The most disturbing thing about this film is how every quote and interview has been twisted around and cut-up to suit the directors' left-wing agenda.  Also, after all of his criticism of Bush, corporate society, etc shown here, where are Michael Moore's profits from this thing going?<br /><br />I heard somewhere that this film was actually shown in a classroom!  Talk about scary.  Think Michael Moore is the only Hollywood bozo involved with the Bush-bashing?  Think again.  Go pick up any recent issue of Rolling Stone and you'll see the same garbage.  I am by no means a right-wing lunatic, but come on!  This crap is just so trendy.  Think for yourself people.
B00004Y6O9|5.0|Eddie Van Halen is one of the rare examples of a guitar freak who is also a musician's musician. Eruption is one of the top guitar tracks of all time, but there is much more to him that tapping. Check out his rythm work; just amazing, never overplaying. Its incredible what this debut album sounded like: these guys sound like the biggest band since Led Zeppellin. Such a shame that they lost their way sometime in the late 80's; after they lost the swagger of Roth this band was never the same, and neither was him. Sad that they cant get into the Rock n Roll hall of fame considering this amazing debut album.
B000002J1O|5.0|Until I became a fan of progressive rock I little realized the pre-Phil Collins history of Genesis, or, as some fans describe it, the Peter Gabriel era of Genesis.  I was unsure of what to expect when I first played this CD because progressive rock has a wide variety.  I was pleased when the first track, \\"Dancing with the Moonlit Knight,\\" starts off sounding like Jethro Tull with their unique style of folk-rock.  Just like classic Tull, this track soon gets spiced up with some excellent guitar and drum work.  The guitar in this selection is particularly interesting and challenging in portions and, with the complex lyrics, put this selection squarely in the center of 70s progressive rock.  Genesis does use some kind of synthesizer on this track.  It could be a mellotron or a chamberlain, or perhaps even a moog.  I am unsure.<br /><br />Foreshadowing the mellow Genesis of the future is \\"I Know What I Like (In Your Wardrobe).\\"  However, the cryptic lyrics that nearly make sense and generally do not along with the unusual rhythms (sort of a jungle theme from time to time) keep this song in the progressive genre, though toward the pop side of progressive.  This song was the first hit for the group in Great Britain.<br /><br />The third track, \\"Firth of Forth,\\" is a wonderful track that has elements similar to King Crimson's early work in combination with excellent semi-classical piano and flute.  The synthesizer and drums round out an intertwined lush and sometimes sparse sound to create yet another outstanding progressive rock track.  The lyrics for this song are more readily understandable, though still very euphemistic and poetic.<br /><br />Phil Collins takes the lead vocal honors on \\"More Fool Me,\\" once again a foreshadowing of the future of Genesis.  This short track is a kind of interlude between the much longer \\"Firth of Forth\\" and \\"The Battle of Epping Forest,\\" feeling almost like an intermission because of its relatively simple construction.<br /><br />According to the booklet accompanying the CD, the nearly 12 minute song \\"The Battle of Epping Forest\\" was \\"Taken from a news story concerning two rival gangs fighting over East-End Protection rights.\\"  The song has a short introduction featuring vaguely military sounding music.  The lyrics are all about conflict and the results of the conflict, but the grim lines are moderated by the satirical nature of the entire song.  Even the music is ironic, often light and playful in the midst of the death and destruction of the fight between the gangs.  The end is outrageous and the final irony.  This music is one of those progressive rock creations that require hearing for full appreciation, and possibly never understanding.<br /><br />Leading from one irony to the next is \\"After the Ordeal.\\"  The English seem to enjoy poking fun at religion, and this instrumental, which accompanies a poem in the CD booklet, does so well.  Even the quasi-Elizabethan music feels vaguely religious without being so.  However, the words of the poem describe the hypocrisy of a certain individual of the charge who apparently has some difficulty staying on a moral path.  Well, actually the individual has veered off the path, kind of far, actually.<br /><br />The seventh track, \\"The Cinema Show,\\" is the fourth long track.  This song is a dramatic story about Tiresias, a character from mythology who, in one version, was changed for a time into a woman, and then later back to a man.  I leave the reader to discover the full story.  However, the song brings in other elements to fill out the promise of the title, and because of the frequent ambiguity of the lyrics I am unsure of whether the intent was to harmonize the elements of the song with Tiresias's story, or whether the intent was to describe the elements of entertainments, since both Romeo and Juliet and Tiresias have been featured in various movies.  In either case, the synthesizers are well-performed and much more subdued than those often featured in some other progressive rock work, such as, for example, that of Yes or Rick Wakeman.<br /><br />The CD finishes off with the wonderfully bizarre and eccentric \\"Aisle of Plenty.\\"  There are some songs that are better left to the listener, and this is one of those.<br /><br />As with much of progressive rock, this music is for the listener who likes a variety of progressive rock, particularly the kind created by groups such as Yes, King Crimson, Jethro Tull, and the Moody Blues, among others.  While the music is somewhat mellow, there are places where the guitars take over and pull the music along.  The lyrics are sufficiently cryptic to challenge anyone attempting to decipher them.  This album is a progressive rock classic from the early 70s, setting the stage for next Genesis progressive rock album, \\"The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway.\\"mple, that of Yes or Rick Wakeman.

B0001DI0FI|5.0|I saw the movie in the theater and at home, and was so taken with  the first movie that I started reading the series written by Patrick O'Brien. By the time I saw the movie on a home screen for the second viewing I liked it even better.(and was up to book 7 by then) <br />  I can understand some of a previous reviewer's criticisms about putting the two books together, but I think it's still a great movie. And if it encourages someone to try the books, so much the better. <br />  What's even more remarkable is the amount of research Patrick O'Brien put into the books. He read old memoirs, captain's journals, English naval newpapers,etc. Every battle happened, maybe not to Jack Aubrey, but to someone. <br />   If you like a good sea yarn,showing how people lived together at sea, how they fought and died...what their beliefs, hopes, superstitions were ...how intelligence was gathered in those days... what the level of culture was ... then you'll like the movie. <br />  I can only think that someone would think the movie was slow if they were used to what passes for action movies today. Or were so used to the quick fix of television fare. <br />  If you think that the Lord of the Rings trilogy was just about elves then you make think that this movie is only about a ship. <br />in that case, this may not be the movie for you.  <br />
0553565915|5.0|This book highlights the transformation that occurs at true NDEs, and the psychic phenomena that often accompanies experiencers is shown clearly here. I think this book together with Psychic Gifts Tools to Connect by Dr. Snow (another NDE experiencer) make some of the best reading on transformation from NDEs that I have ever read. Both also highlight how the choices we make here in our lives ripple on through to our death experience, and how we can connect to our higher selves and each other, and fine tune powerful spiritual abilities, right here on earth. We all have much to gain from reading these accounts.
B0000024UO|4.0|Johnny Winter is one of the few white guys that can really play and  sing the blues without soundung ridiculous. On this, his first album, the best moments are when he takes out his guitar and goes crazy. 'Be careful with a fool' is probably my all time favourite track of his. The acoustic tracks are also outstanding; his version of Robert Johnson's 'when you got a good friend' is one of the earliest examples of a good cover of any of his songs, along with the stones 'love in vain' & the cream 'crossroads'. There are some weak moments also, like when he tries to copy Ray Charles's 'drown in my own tears' note for note. But this is an authentic blues album all around.
B00005JMUL|5.0|The train that appeared in the movie was modeled on a real train, the Pere Marquette 1225, built in 1941. It was named the 1225 because it was the 1225th engine to come off the assembly line.  <br /> <br />PM 1225 was built right after the PM 1224 and right before the PM 1226, both of which went to the scrapyard long ago, along with most of the other obsolete steam trains in America.   <br /> <br />Decades ago, when all other steam trains were being sent to the scrapyard, the PM 1225 train (now living in Owosso, MI, in a small railyard) was saved. The man who was scrapping the engines was told that he could save ONE engine. He chose to save the 1225 because he liked the number. Go figure... <br /> <br />40 years later, the people who were making the Polar Express were looking around America for a steam train to use as a model for the animation in the film. There are VERY FEW of these magnficant machines left.  <br /> <br />The men from Hollywood heard about a working steam train in Owosso, Michigan which had been saved from the scrapyard and renovated by a volunteer group, the Michigan State Trust for Railway Preservation...(MSTRP)  <br /> <br />Hollywood animators and film scouts came and looked at it and asked to use it. MSTRP was thrilled to have their beloved vintage train starring in a movie with Tom Hanks and said yes.   <br /> <br />It was only later that the animators found out that the rare vintage train, saved from the scrapyard and chosen to model the \\"Polar Express\\" was named \\"1225.\\"  <br /> <br />How is that for syncronicity?  <br />Annie Lewis  <br />East Lansing, MI
0671027573|5.0|If you're looking for literary greatness, this is probably not the book for you.  But if you're looking for a fun, kind of trashy, quick read then definitely check out Mr Perfect.  The book starts out with 4 friends who get together for drinks after work and make up a list of characteristics they want in the perfect man.  The list ends up in the wrong hands and soon they have a killer stalking them.  Throw in a side plot with a sexy next door neighbor, and you have the makings for the perfect beach read: murder, sex and suspense (and even a little humor).   <br /> <br />This was my very first Linda Howard story.  I have since read many more of her novels.  I do like most of them, but this is the only one I have read over and over.  When ever I have nothing to read, and an afternoon to kill, I grab this book and settle in on the couch for an amusing afternoon.
B00008H2LB|5.0|Every generation has had a huge star or band to mark its era. Meteora could easily earn Linkin Park's spot in the books. Not only have they seamlessly fused rock, hip-hop, and techno into one, you could take out one or two of those items and still have an awesome band. Chester Bennington has the greatest voice i have ever heard. Not only can he scream incredibly well (it actually sounds musical), he can go soft when he needs to. Mike Shinoda can bust a rhyme better than any other white guy (save for Eminem), and Mr. Hahn is an incredible turn-tableist. ok, so heres a quick song review: <br /> <br />1.Don't Stay-10/10-simply incredible. this is proof that linkin park could just include rock and still have an incredible band. <br />2.Somewhere I belong-10/10-this song has some of the best lyrics of all time. period. <br />3.Lying From You-10/10-the beat to this song is so catchy that i cant help but love it. <br />4.Hit the Floor-10/10-basically straight rap, but the chorus has an insane amount of screaming. <br />5.Easier to Run-10/10-the chorus is impossible to get out of your head, but in this case its a good thing. <br />6.Faint-10/10-this is the song that will do it for linkin park. this is song has the best fusion of hip-hop and rock ever. <br />7.Figure.09-9/10-awesome song. no real tune, but has some cool segments. <br />8.Breaking the Habit-8/10-this song really shouldn't have been included on Meteora, but on a seperate EP. listen to it and you'll understand. <br />9.From the Inside-11/10-this is my favorite song of all time. <br />10.Nobody's Listening-10/10-mainly straight-out rap, but the flutes in the backround are pretty cool. <br />11.Session-4/10-can't say this is as good as Cure for the Itch, or very good at all, but its good break-dancing music. <br />12.Numb-10/10-this was the song that made linkin park popular after In the End. While it doesn't capture the true nature of the band, ti is still a really good song.
B00012QM8G|4.0|Personally I liked this movie very much.  Really gets you thinking about what happened to so many people and the people who tried to help.  My mother, who teaches this time period in high school, doesn't like the movie because there were so many other people who did so much more than Schindler.  She feels they picked the wrong person to do a big movie on.  I do agree, but I still liked the movie very much.
B000068QY7|5.0|After the over over the top \\"Be Here Now\\" and the more \\"experimental\\" (at times) sound of \\"Standing On the Shoulder Of Giants\\" Oasis finally have realised where they have gone wrong and have learned from it. <br /> <br />What they have done is gone back to making a great album which is \\"Heathen Chemistry\\" which contains Oasis classics such as  <br />\\"The Hindu Times\\" \\"Stop Crying Your Heart Out\\" and \\"Little By Little\\". <br /> <br />Its very refreshing to hear such a strong Oasis album as this play so well, with a new sound and a new and better line up. <br /> <br />Although Oasis are'nt going to be the biggest band in the world like they were for a few years (when they were just new) again. <br /> <br />They still are gonna be the best and biggest band around and are going from strength to strength as their live shows, and as this album shows. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0002F6BRE|4.0|Wow, this was an incredibly corny but funny movie. Sometimes it was gut burstingly funny, but towards the end it gets really stupid. The scene where Ferrel is singing (spreading christmas cheer) is priceless. I was in tears! It is a silly but fun movie. Will Ferrel stars as Buddy, a human orphan raised as an elf in Santa's workshop, grows up in the land of Rankin-Bass Christmas TV specials. Candy cane trees, gingerbread houses and an animated talking snowman are this boy's life. His odyssey to find his biological father, a cynical publisher on Santa's naughty list, takes him out of the land of sugar plum diets and into the bustling streets of New York City. He meets dad, dad thinks he's a nut, takes him in, other son befriends him, dad get's mad at buddy after buddy innocently mistakened a midget for an elf (yet another gut burster) and says some unkind words, son finds buddy, santa crashes in central park, and they all help santa and save christmas. Now that I just ruined the movioe for you, you should still see it. It's no A Christmas Story, but it is a fun and enjoyably silly comedy for the whole family to enjoy.
B00005JMXX|1.0|I usually avoid \\"catastrophy\\" movies and thankfully I saw this as a rental on a discount. The characters are uninteresting at best and mostly irritatingly stupid.  <br /> <br />I'd say that this movie combines two elements; catastrophy movie and a teen movie - you know those movies you didn't go near even when you actually were a teenager.  <br /> <br />Stay clear of this turkey, it's one of the worst waste and major money thrown at making a movie with an idiotic theme and a majorly irritating look and feel.
B000002C25|4.0|Its been called $%#% by many and is certainly not a classic, but its a great album all the same and no one can deny that. <br /> <br />A huge wall of guitars and cocaine wrote this album \\"as Noel Gallaghar said.\\" Well the cocaine part anyhow.

It has the classic hits Magical Mystery Tour, I am the Walrus, Hello Goodbye, Strawberry Fields Forever, Penny Lane, All you need is Love, Baby your a Rich Man, and Fool on a Hill!! Which are all great songs. Overall this a masterpiece!!!! I recomend this to not only Beatles fans, but everyone who likes music!!!!!
0385504217|5.0|It seems that most of the reviews presented here were placed by people wanting this book to be flawed.  Why?  Probably due to its incredible success.  These are the same people who would review a best selling album and complain that while it was basically good they didn't absolutly LOVE every song on the album.  I was so intrigued by this book that I too took the time to research albeit not all too thoroughly a number of the points brought up by the author and found them to be pretty solid.  I found the book more empowering, uplifting, and genuine than anything I ever learned in Catholic school or at church.  While I do not blame religion for the ruin of the world I do believe that many religious values are archaic and do not apply to today's world.  I also beleive that were everything in this novel proven to be true most of the world would still choose not to beleive just as some believe that we never walked on the moon and that Nazi concentration camps didn't really exist.  If you beleive everything respresented in the Passion of the Christ is \\"gospel\\" and everything represented in things like Farenheit 911 are nothing but propaganda than you can gain nothing from reading this book.  It will not provide answers to deep questions, it will not cure you, it will not make sense of the world, but it will broaden your perspective, allow you to question freely, and MAKE YOU THINK.  Still above all it will without a doubt entertain you through and through.

B00006M183|5.0|Pearl Jams Best album, very good line up of songs, you can listen to it from start to finish without having to skip any tracks. <br /> <br />If your expecting an in your face album (much like their other albums) , then don't expect it from this. Pearl Jam has progressed with this album and made a completley different album than they have before. <br /> <br />It has different tone, and the songs are'nt overworked and perfected to be in your face and upbeat and really catchy, which is what gives this album its character. <br />Of course many people don't get this, so thats why its not as popular as their albums \\"TEN\\" and \\"Vs\\". <br /> <br /> <br />It sounds at times in the same stream as their mid nintees released song \\"I Got ID\\". <br /> <br />If you open your mind to a different style of Pearl Jam then you'll really like this. Especially since its not like all their mainstream crap.  <br /> <br />If you don't like it at first, its cause you have to get used to it, and before you know it, you'll really like it. <br /> <br />
0788815490|3.0|Helena Bonham Carter is one of those rare actresses in Hollywood that is able to completely involve the audience with her passion, her terror, or her conniving plans with only the flutter of her eyes.  She can literally tell an entire story with just her eyes.  They are so full of passion and desire throughout the course of this film that you cannot help yourself but keep your own eyes focused on them.  When she is on screen, her eyes demand respect, and she finds it.  Perhaps this was why this film was her best film to date, being recognized by the Academy and from her fellow peers.  I think that the reason this film was different than all the others is because of Carter and several outside factors.  While these factors do skyrocket this film in my eyes, there is one element that keeps this film grounded and somewhat ruined.<br /><br />Let me begin by saying that I hate, absolutely dislike, all period piece films.  I can be honest enough to say that I have never seen a period piece film that I simply adored and was taken aback with, until I watched The Wings of a Dove.  There was something about this film that just grabbed me and immersed me into the world that director Iain Softley had created.  First, it was the characters.  As I mentioned before, Helena steals the show with not only her deep character study and development, but also with those passionate eyes.  You can see hints of intelligence and stupidity all rolled into one, which really helped develop the rest of this film. To accompany Helena through this journey, you have two other actors that keep up their end of the bargain.  Linus Roache compliments Helena perfectly.  His honest devotion to this conniving woman and his lack of self-preservation gives us that character that we know little about, but are quietly rooting for.  Then there is Alison Elliot, who literally comes in with guns a-blazing.  She is the most difficult character of the film due to the amount of layers that she must convey, but in the end she shines and brings upon us a very emotional ending.  Throw in the mix a cameo by two great actors, Michael Gambon and Charlotte Rampling, and you have quite possibly the best names to helm this project.<br /><br />With characters going to their full potential by the strength of some amazing actors, what also compliments this film is the charismatic story that helps lead the actors.  Seasoned with a feeling of Dangerous Liaisons, this film takes us to a whole new level of sophistication and lust.  When one woman will stop at nothing to ensure that she has the lifestyle that she desires, plus the man that she wants, she will look past friendships and morality.  This shines through in not only Henry James' novel, but also in Hossein Amini's screenplay.  With the amazing talent of Softley directing, we have scenes like that at the beginning of the film (eerie wordless Strangers on a Train moment) coupled with gorgeous shots of the \\"City of Love\\", Venice.  We have a multi-faceted story that goes beyond my premature expectations.<br /><br />While I felt this was an amazing film and Carter should have been recognized more for her role, there was one scene that I felt pushed me into that \\"brick wall\\" of cinema.  It was as if I was travelling quickly through this film, taking in all the sights and sounds of these complex characters, when suddenly I was hit by a brick wall.  The \\"brick wall\\" that I speak about is a very pornographic scene in this film with Carter.  I felt that it wasn't needed, nor really brought any real relevance to the story, other than a nude actress.  This took away from the overall scope of the film, and for me took this powerful drama down a notch.<br /><br />Overall, I was impressed.  It took me away from my consistent dislike of period piece dramas, but that violent sexual scene just turned me in disgust.  Don't get me wrong, I am all for nudity if it progresses the plot, but this was not in any coherent context to the film.  I just thoughtthat Softley wanted to see Carter naked.  Perhaps I am wrong, but it just didn't seem to fit.  Outside of that, it was an outstanding film, which is worthy of all the honors it was bestowed during the year that it was released.<br /><br />Grade: *** out of *****t thought that Softley wanted to see Carter naked.

0060527978|4.0|I'd say one sentence from one of the Editorial Reviews sums up this book best: \\"The volume preserves the basic spiritual tone of The Alchemist, but readers expecting comparable depth and substance will be disappointed.\\" <br /> <br />That's pretty much it. First off, if you haven't read Paulo Coelho at all, I'd suggest the best place to start would be \\"The Alchemist.\\" And if you like that book, this one would be a good \\"companion.\\" But the depth and substance don't quite match up, as the other reviewer said. <br /> <br />It is difficult for a book that uses \\"simple words\\" and simple situations to be powerful, and Coelho pulled it off in \\"The Alchemist.\\" In this book, he didn't. <br /> <br />The book is a collection of expanded aphorisms, truisms, profundities, all in a kind of mixed bag. They seem to follow no particular pattern - there is no build-up that I can see. You can pretty much open to a random page and read that page, and then a different page the next time. Some of them make a lot of sense, some are profound, yes, but at the same time, some are lacklustre. Also, the use of the \\"warrior\\" theme is not always conducive to the carrying of the message. Sometimes it is, sometimes it isn't. <br /> <br />I give \\"Manual\\" 4 stars because even if a fourth of the material is worth reading, it's worth having read the whole.
0380733358|5.0|This is the first Follett I've read, but it won't be the last.  The book was that rare thing -- a suspense story that actually has believable interesting characters.  Throw in complete historical plausibility, and you've got a winner on your hands.  Can't beat it -- five stars.
0786715103|5.0|As I read this book I wonder why. There's a phrase in the product description that goes, \\"the most barbarous and chaotic display of civil war and genocide in the past decade.\\" Note that this is restricted to just the past decade. Tragic as it is, this is just one incident. There was ethnic clensing in what was Yugoslovia, Saddam Hussein using nerve gas on the Kurds, who can forget the mounds of skulls in Cambodia. Of course to really get big time, you need to be organized and professional like the Germans in World War II.  <br /> <br />Looking to the future, what do those people who would have us pull out of Iraq think would happen between the Shiite and Sunni and Kurds that remain. What will happen as weapons of mass destruction become available -- yes, I know Iraq didn't have any. I could build some, and my chemistry is out of date. The organization that pulled off 9/11 has the resources and obviously the will to fund the development of them.  <br /> <br />Then there's AIDS. 3.1 million people died of AIDS in 2001, that's the same rate of death as in Rwanda but over the whole year and continuing year after year. Are Robert Mugabe (Zimbabwe), Thabo Mbeki (South Africa) and other African leaders any worse than the devil in Rwanda. They know what they are doing, they just don't seem to care.
0812550757|5.0|Speaker for the Dead is one of those very, very special books. The science behind it (particularly the virology and genetics) is intriguing and original, and it stands comfortably on it's own, toe to toe with works like Darwin's Radio. But that's just the mechanics. <br /> <br />The real strength of this story lies in Card's ability to wrangle story line and generate tension not only from character interaction, but particularly from internal tension and moral dilemma. The refreshingly honest take Card has on how to treat the dead and contend with the living, and how to own up to all the choices or the lack thereof - that make up a life, is breathtaking in its power.  <br /> <br />When you're done with this, go out and get the 1st and 3rd books, Ender's Game and Xenocide. Run, don't walk. It's rare to get intelligent and entertaining Sci-Fi that stands up so well in a series.

The CD sleeve has an illustration of what appears to be Pandora and her accompanying box with the top open--what does that tell you?   <br /> <br />Maroon 5 and John Mayer are in the same category of quality, but that is where it ends.

078401213X|4.0|What do I know about higher math? Admittedly, next to nothing, but I have looked at the significance of numbers in Judaism, and have an abiding fascination for the Fibonacci Series. I know of Pythagoras' concept of \\"all is number\\", and do believe numerical concepts illustrate natural harmonies of the universe. The Golden Rectangle is art history/architecture 101, absolutely necessary for understanding proportion and geometry; it really is amazing to see the spiral repeated throughout nature. There is the Kabbalah issue: one should not study Kabbalah until spiritually and psychologically ready; to do so prematurely risks mental imbalance, as in this movie (not the dangerous pop fad Madonna version).<br /><br />Perhaps it is because of my ignorance that I am prey to movies such as this: the idea of mysticism, science, and reason coming together is one that fascinates me. I simply cannot argue how correct, how factual, the math might be. Mathematics and philosophy are not as distant as one might believe -- note Bertrand Russell's career and Einstein as mystic. In \\"Pi\\", the disturbed hero (by the way, this is a remarkable depiction of descent into mental illness hell; great symbolism throughout)is chased by the (antithetical) forces of material and spiritual gain for THE number. Both forces are so extreme, they become embodiments of pure evil. Knowledge without wisdom, tools for personal gain; the Hidden Name of G-d, the key to ruling the world. Being pulled in two directions, no wonder the chap fell apart. Another moral of the story: don't mess with Kabbalah until you are ready! The risks of exploring G-d's mind are too great.<br /><br />I doubt this movie is entirely about mathematics. I perceived it as moral, cautionary tale: why else does his retired professor call our hero Icarus? We must not fly too close to the sun; and if we do, we must pay the penalty -- death. Humility for the individual and for the species. Critics who disliked this movie, who stated the mathematics was flawed, even impossible, might not have delved deep enough to uncover its true message.<br /><br />I enjoyed this movie: I thought the grainy, black and white images, the insect symbolism (related to the Jewish idea that G-d is too vast, too unknowable, too infinite to perceive from our lowly mortal position), the pulsating soundtrack (not unlike the 'music of the spheres'), all contributed to a sense of mounting claustrophobic madness and the push of the unknown.<br /><br />Certainly not for all tastes -- a wildly eccentric ride through theories and infinity.

0767805712|4.0|Ethan Hawke, Uma Thurman, Gore Vidal and especially Jude Law all shine in this low key sci fi drama set in the not too distant future. Two trends that are now really beginning to unfold have reached their full fruition: 1) genetic engineering has reached the level where it is available \\"over the counter\\"; and 2) society has completely split into a privledged and unprivledged caste system, based almost entirely on the genetic quotient. <br /> <br />But what happens when a genetically inferior person has the  motivation and determination to enter the world of the privledeged ? How can he fool all the technology, which identifies him with blood, urine and other DNA sampling methods at every turn ? <br /> <br />This is one movie you might not fully appreciate after the first viewing. Thanks to the brilliant and captivating performance of Jude Law, I watched the film again, then again. After about the fourth viewing, I decided this is a \\"must own\\" for my sci fi collection. Although the ending is bittersweet, it does satisfy, leaving a glimmer of hope that the human spirit will triumph.
0783117523|5.0|If you havent seen this film already you must buy it and watch it over and over again. Angelina Jolie play a model in need of help as at a young age her mother left her father for a rich man which left her feeling alone.

One photoshoot she was asked to do one topless which she refused to do unless a woman who was working for the photographer was in with her they soon became lovers. So the number 1 model in the world was a bisexual cocaine addict. The film really had a twist ibn it when Gia went to her dealer for more cocaine but was no where to be seen but there was a nother crack head there and she was so desprate she took heroine which he offerd her instead. She took it soon passed out when she woke she was coverd in bruises which this drug addict did he also raped her. so now she had been raped beaten and given heroine with a dirty needle. she caught HIV she didnt know this at this point her girlfriend told he to choose the drugs or her she chose the drugs. soon after she was in rehab no longer beautiful noone wanted her to model for them when she got out  <br />she was cutting her self because she didnt have drugs she went back to her dealer which beat her because she used drugs off someone else. this is when she found out about the HIV it was now worse she had AIDS and was going to die she went to she her ex girlfriend but never told her she was going to die later that week she was in hospital dieing. When you watch this film you will see the brilliant acting from Angelina Jolie but i warn you this film is very sad at the end even i cried i cant get over how good her acting was and im not the only one as she won an oscar for it
B0001XAPX8|3.0|This movie started out excellently. I thought they should have shown more of the young Silk with his family. It also seemed that Jacinta Barrett was trying to stay with him until she realized his mother would never approve.  They should have shown him trying to decide whether to embrace his blackness and see if he could still keep his job or at least go to court and fight the charges while still remaining undercover.  The love story was totally unnecessary to the development of the plot, and the ending seems like they ran out of ideas.  I would have liked to see more of Wentworth Miller (his performance is worth watching the movie for) and Anna DeVere Smith.  And yes, Anthony Hopkins was truly miscast.
B00005PJ8O|4.0|This movie was very well made, however, George C. Scott truly made it happen. His acting really makes us forget that he is just an actor and not the real patton. The line with the russian general where he calls him an SOB truly shows how out of touch with society he was. He was, i think, the greatest general of WWII.
B00065JTBA|5.0|I heard the box set, thanks to my cousin who dropped in from the US. The album, needless to say is a music connoisseurs dream. Every song is so breathtaking and so in the Bon Jovi niche. They've lived a dream and taken their fans (like me) along with them. It's such a pity that we fans back in India can't make the most of it. The Set is not even out here and I don't see it releasing in the near future. Such torture for the countless BJ fans dying to get their hands on the box set.
B00005YXZH|5.0|A word of warning:  'Yankee Hotel Foxtrot' is not easy to like.  It's the kind of album that takes at least 2 full listens to grow on you and it demands your full attention.  But if you give it a chance, it will almost definitely cement a place as one of your favorite albums. <br /> <br />A few things seem off-kilter on first listen.  The main thing to me were the lyrics.  They simply make no sense some of the time.  From \\"I'm Am Trying to Break Your Heart\\" <br />\\"I wanna hold you in the Bible-black predawn <br />You're quite a quiet domino, bury me now <br />Take off your bandaid cause I don't believe in touchdowns <br />What was I thinking when I said hello.\\" <br />That's probably the most nonsensical lyric on the album (most of the lyrics aren't that \\"out there\\" and plenty of them make normal sense).  However, after the first couple listens you come to realize it's not really about the literal meaning of the lyrics, it's more about cool turns of phrase, the vague feeling the odd lyrics can give you, and it's more about how the lyrics are sung that give them meaning.  For instance the chorus to \\"Jesus Etc.\\" <br />\\"Tall buildings shake <br /> voices escape singing sad sad songs <br /> tuned to chords  <br /> strummed down your cheeks <br /> bitter melodies, turning your orbit around\\" <br /> makes little sense taken literally but is so catchy and the lyrics are amazing when you hear them sung. <br /> <br />Musically the songs on 'YHF' are complex, brilliant, and original.  \\"I Am Trying to Break Your Heart\\" has a repeating drum fill that works in the song as if it were a great guitar riff.  The violins on \\"Jesus Etc.\\" make the song, I especially like the \\"plucking\\" violin technique used in one verse.  Alot of the songs build up from sparse openings with just a single instrument to a geniusly layered \\"wall of sound\\".  Often towards the end or in the middle of a song a catchy acoustic guitar fill will come out of nowhere and hit you just right, or a piano will start playing a catchy fill and keep building and building like the end of \\"Poor Places\\".  Some of the feedback drenched guitar and other unusual and original \\"noise\\" can be off-putting at first, but most of it is used really sparingly and fits in perfectly with the songs. <br /> <br />'Yankee Hotel Foxtrot' almost never got made, as documented in the bands recent film, and what a shame that would have been.  We would have all missed out on a classic album.  If you haven't already picked this up, don't hesitate any longer.  If you're looking for comparisons, all I can say is try and imagine Bob Dylan or Neil Young collaborating with a guitarist from someone like Sonic Youth.
B00008EY65|4.0|The 2004 comic book-inspired film \\"Hellboy\\" was quite entertaining.  Created by Mike Mignola and first published in 1994 by Dark Horse Comics (which was founded in 1986 by Mike Richardson in Oregon), Hellboy is a red demon that works as a paranormal investigator and fights occult threats for the fictional U.S. Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense.  As depicted in the 2004 film, Hellboy arrives on Earth under rather unusual circumstances.  A fictionalized version of Grigori Yefimovich Rasputin (Karel Roden) did not die during the Russian Revolution.  Instead, he works for the Nazis in the 1940's with the promise of giving them a powerful supernatural means of defeating the Allies.  (The real Rasputin, 1869?-1916, was a Russian mystic and famed occultist for Tsar Nicholas II.) Using strange & sophisticated equipment with the aid of Nazi scientists, Rasputin constructs a machine that can open a doorway into another realm inhabited by long-ago banished beings.  Rasputin succeeds in the opening the doorway just as U.S. troops attack their site.  Rasputin is seemingly killed, but something did come through the mystical doorway: a young, red demon.  Professor Trevor Bruttenholm (John Hurt), who had traveled with the U.S. troops, finds the young demon and raises it as his own child.  Naming the demon Hellboy, it grows into a large and powerful being (played by Ron Perlman); but instead of becoming an instrument of destruction as envisioned by Rasputin, Hellboy becomes a powerful force for good.  However, not everyone who assisted Rasputin the night that he opened the doorway was killed or captured, including Rasputin's lover Ilsa (Biddy Hodson) and the very dark and bizarre man Karl Ruprect Kroenen (Ladislav Beran).  In present day along with Hellboy at the super-secret Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense is the amphibian humanoid (\\"icthyo sapien\\") known as Abe Sapien (Doug Jones), but one of the paranormal agents has recently opted to stay in a mental hospital, the pyrokinetic Liz Sherman (Selma Blair).  Professor Bruttenholm selects newbie agent John Myers (Rupert Evans) to become Hellboy's new partner, who takes an interest in getting Liz back to the bureau; which is a good thing since Ilsa and Karl intend to resurrect Rasputin to carry out his evil plans.<br /><br />With a fair bit of acting, a touch of humor, good special effects and an interesting story, \\"Hellboy\\" is an entertaining and engaging film. Other memorable characters include Agent Clay (Corey Johnson), the kid on the rooftop (Rory Copus) and the deceased Ivan Klimatovich.  My least favorite character is the head of the bureau, Tom Manning (Jeffrey Tambor).  Mike Mignola, who was also one of the film's associate producers, played a brief (and uncredited) moment in the film as knight.  The film's director (and co-writer), Guillermo del Toro, also had a brief, uncredited role in the film as a dragon.  Memorable scenes include the Nazis, Myers' arrival, Hellboy's fights, Liz's fire-starting abilities and the closing scenes.

0140277447|1.0|<br />First of all, I will examine Chinese testimonies of the eleven cases to verify the murder of 190,000 people. I, however, can point out an interesting fact when we look into the process of collecting those testimonies. <br /> <br />According to Summary report on the Investigation of Japanese war crimes committed in Nanking, prepared by the Procurator of the District Court in Nanking, to prepare for the IMTFE, the KMT set up the 'Nanking Investigation Committee for Antagonists' Crime' on November 7, 1945, and appealed to the Chinese public to report Japanese Army's crimes. <br /> <br />It was reported, however, that few responded to the crimes committed by Japanese Army and some refused to testify or to deny the massacre occurred when they were asked for details. <br /> <br />Then, the KMT reluctantly submitted the tentative report to the IMTFE on January 20, 1946. <br /> <br />Except for one 'testimony' made by a man named Lu Su, no other evidence of 'massacre by the Japanese Army' was available, besides burial records. <br /> <br />Afterwards surveys were conducted and they managed to get '500 facts' investigated. 'One after another case was examined,' but they found only four new cases reliable. <br /> <br />Based on 'Lu Su's testimony' and the burial records by the 'Advance Benevolence Society' and the 'Red Swastika Society', and then the four newly discovered evidences, that is, based on seven evidences in total, the number of casualties was concluded to be 340,000, and it was submitted to the IMTFE in February 1946. The simple summation of casualties in seven cases, however, reached only to an amount less than 228,000, still far less than 340,000. <br />
B0001CNRSE|2.0|I have to admit. This movie's all about Honey Daniels (Jessica Alba). She's hot with a cool attitutde and she can dance. Watching the movie, I really liked the the plot. All the dance moves were tight, the themes were inspiring, and the soundtrack was BOOMING. This could have been a classic. But really now...if you're going to make a movie based on real life struggles within lower classed communities, the acting must be right. Apart, from Lil Romeo and the supporting cast who were great throughout the movie, Alba just didn't fit in. The sore thumb in the film was obviously Alba's terrible acting (that somehow got overshadowed by her looks, and radiant smile). \\"Honey\\" is ok, but it's NOTHING compared to \\"Empire\\".
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Excellent movie and character study about alienation, feeling alone and out of place in the world, and cultural differences.  Great acting.  Bill Murray should have won the Oscar for his performance here.  Sofia Coppella shows a dreamlike world in Tokyo.  These other reviewers don't get it, or don't appreciate good acting, comedy, or non-Hollywood, thoughtful filmmaking.  I like the scene where Bill Murray is explaining to Scarlet J. what it's like to have kids.  Funny and touching moments.  Worthy of its praise.
B0002858YS|5.0|Finally, a band that puts out a CD worth actually buying.  There have only been a couple this year.  (Modest Mouse & Franz Ferdinand)  This CD is absolutely superb.  Every song is worth listening to over and over again.  Just heard they got some grammy noms, good for them!  The one complaint is that \\"somebody told me\\" is getting over-played on radio. Also, for fans, consider the UK version, because their track #8 is far better than the US version's.  Can't wait to hear more from them in the future.
B0006B29Z2|3.0|I picked up Iron Maiden's new DVD, The Early Days - Part I about a month ago.  It's a relatively enjoyable affair consisting of a brand new documentary, and some old archived live footage. <br /> <br />The live footage is interesting.  It gives a glimpse into the past of Iron Maiden, and really highlights their changing styles in the early 80's.  The shows are intense, and Maiden delivers some great performances.  Unfortunately, as you might expect with such old footage, the audio quality is rather lacking.  The video quality looks great, considering the age, but the audio has a lot to be desired.  The mixes are very poor and unbalanced, which can make trying to listen to the concerts a little difficult. <br /> <br />The documentary is great.  Clocking in around an hour and half, it actually seems too short.  The majority of the time is spent on the very early years, before Maiden had a stable line-up or a record deal.  It was interesting to hear about this era in Maiden's history, because it is so well documented here.  There was definitely a lot of time put into this project, and the documentary features comments from a lot of people that have been connected to Iron Maiden over the years.  The only notable absence is artist Derek Riggs, who appears only in the form of some old archival footage.  Some of the speakers on the documentary include old band mates, current band mates, their manager, record executives, journalists, roadies, and more. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, even though the documentary covers the very early years quite, well, there's just not enough time devoted to Bruce's arrival and the subsequent albums.  The amount of time Piece of Mind was discussed vs. Killers is drastically out of proportion, which is too bad.  I'm assuming The Number of the Beast - Maiden's greatest selling album - was not discussed all that long because there is a DVD devoted exclusively to it.  Either way, the documentary could have easily included another 30 minutes on the post-Paul era up to Piece of Mind. <br /> <br />The bonuses are OK, but not spectacular.  It's nice the DVDs include promo videos from the era - but it was only a year ago that Maiden released Visions of the Beast, which contained their complete promo video history on 2 DVD's.  I would have rather seen the space devoted to more documentary, and not something that I already purchased. <br /> <br />Overall, for the price you just can't go wrong.  Even if the concert footage lacks a little in the audio department, it still makes up for it by just being Iron Maiden - you still get a great performance every time, it's just that it's not that easy to hear.  The documentary is excellent, but a bit too short.  This DVD is essential for any fan of Iron Maiden.
0060930187|5.0|I found Sylvia Plath's \\"The Bell Jar\\" to be an excellent read and source of understanding.  It is not just another book, but a mirror in which the souls of many are reflected.  Young women of all generations, both young and old, can relate to the situations young Elly finds herself in, from the awkward boys she meets and the \\"perfect\\" best friend, to the moments she feels as though life itself is not worth living.  Ultimately, she is the female version of young Holden Caufield, and for that reason, the book finds such success. <br />While I found it quite easy to relate to the main character in the book, I found bits and pieces of the story itself to be quite confusing.  Several questions remain unanswered, and one must work actively to \\"connect the dots.\\"  However, perhaps the abrupt twists and turns Plath takes throughout the story are meant to throw the reader off course, and further explore the inner workings of Elly's psyche. <br />All in all, I would rank Plath's \\"The Bell Jar\\" at 5 stars, because that it was it truly deserves.  Never before has a book kept my mind so intrigued and eager to move forward than that about a young woman named Elly.
0679411585|5.0|<br /> <br />     This book is a first-hand account of the first major battalion-scale operations in the Vietnam War. Written by Lt. General Harold Moore (retired) and a war correspondent, Joseph Galloway, who was the only journalist on the ground throughout the fighting, it tells a savage and bloody story. The two authors of this spent many years interviewing soldiers who fought in the Ia Drang Valley, and also the relatives of those who died in the battle and had journals and letters which were sent home. <br />      <br />     In November of 1965, a Cavalry Battalion was dropped behind enemy lines using experimental helicopter tactics and was immediately surrounded by over two-thousand enemy soldiers. Three days later, and barely three miles away, a battalion in close relation to the ones first dropped in the initial landing zone was slaughtered. <br />  <br />     An interesting credit to this book is that it is not only from the perspectives of the American battalions. The authors not only interviewed the American officers and troops, but also interviewed the North Vietnamese commanders, who offer their opinions and perspectives, making the battle seem all the more real to the reader. Without these perspectives, it would have seemed like someone was trying to paint a picture but was missing many of his materials. <br />  <br />     Although sometimes it seems dryly written, there is no exciting way to describe such a terrible and seemingly one-sided battle. Although the Lieutenant Colonel writes it  <br />to be more of a black and white documentary than the dramatic and colorful movie interpretation, it is not difficult to see the leadership in the officers on the ground and the bravery of every soldier on the ground. Many of the people in this book were not able to read it, because they sacrificed their lives to make it. <br />  <br />     The authors go into extensive detail in many areas of the book. This can obviously be credited to the fact that these twomen were on the ground with the troops while the battle was going on. Many authors of books that are similar to this or are included in its genre are limited to what the authors could research. This is not the case in We Were Soldiers Once... And Young, because the authors can also include their own experiences throughout the three day battle for Landing Zone X-Ray. Although sometimes the details can become wearisome, they provide the information necessary to completely understand the situation. This book is more to understand the happenings of the Vietnam War and its first major conflict than to be entertained. The movie was meant to be entertaining; the book is clearly more informative. <br />      <br />     However, its blandness at points does not mean it is always dull. There are many chapters full of stories of the brave men who fought and died in the Ia Drang Valley. It basically alternates between the two men's hind-sight of the events and then what the men who were fighting in different areas were going through. This makes it interesting because the authors offer their opinions on what happened, as well as what they had thought at the time.  <br /> <br />     This book is a magnificent retelling of the events happening during the battle for the Ia Drang Valley,  and  it  belongs on every person's shelf who has ever pondered what it must have been like fighting in that bloody war. It is full of tales of sacrifice, determination and heroism, on the parts of both forces. This compelling account of bravery was an astonishing read and a true eye-opener to the events occurring during these battles and what the soldiers had to go through. This book is a credit to every American soldier and is an absolute must-read. <br />  <br />
B000068TPN|5.0|I consider myself a history buff, especially war history, yet somehow this movie just slipped past me.  So when I did see it I didn't really think it would live up to all the hype I heard, but I was wrong. <br /> <br />This movie is one of the best war movies I've seen.  Based on true events, and strictly so, this movie covers the first major US battle in Vietnam.  It took place in November 1965 in the Ia Drang Valley.  The action grips us but the story itself lulls us more. <br /> <br />Now I personally am one to feel that the Vietnam War was a bad idea, yet I can see the true austerity that was presented by the film.  This movie shows that Vietnam was no picnic; that's just a given.  This film does not, however, glorify dying. just as much as it doesn't glorify the entire war.  Instead it focuses on the tenacity and strength of a few individuals and their efforts to quell a seemingly, and eventually so, overwhelming army. <br /> <br />On that note, I believe that the film deserves five stars for it's beautiful yet tear-jerking portrayal.  War is hell, and these people lived it.
0393035158|1.0|This is an atheists view of current events. According the author all bad in the world today is caused by radical religious zealots.<br /><br />Harris scores a few points here mainly against radical Islam, studiously ignoring the fact that most Muslims do condemn the radicals and claim that they do not represent mainstream Islam. I tend to believe them, if all Muslims were potential suicide bombers there would be a lot more violence in the world. I read that 8,000 or so people were killed by Islamic terrorista in the past decade. This is fewer than the 100,000 or so killed by US bombs in Iraq and 500,000 killed as result of sanciotns and the US bombing Iraq water supplies. power plants and waste treatment infrastructure.<br /><br />What frightens me about Harris's book is that he claims that some people can never be reasoned with and advocates pre-emptive action against a group of people for no other reason than because they ARE Muslims! That should frighten anyone even Harris's fans.<br /><br />Of course when you study history you may find that the so-called \\"enlightended\\" atheistic are the most prolific mass murderers and make the Islamic terrorists look like tame and quaint little wanna-be's. Lets see there was the Soviet Union - atheist state; Nazi Germany - atheist State; Red China - Atheist State; Khmer Rouge - Atheist State; North Korea - Atheist state. Need I continue? Well, one more - the suicide bombings were actually started and invented by the Communists in Malaysia - atheists all. They account for 120 MILLION or so dead.<br /><br />Harris seems to worry that we could face a disastrous terrorist attack with hundreds of thousands killed based on beliefs that he says belong on the same shelf as Batman. I submit that erroneous or radical political beliefs belong on the same shelf yet Harris has no problem with using those beliefs as a guideline for mass murder.<br /><br />For example. from the book: \\"Some propositions are so dangerous that it may even be ethical to kill people for believing them. . . .

B0000AQVCL|5.0|I came across this band becuase my wife is a new aged rock fanatic, but being practically brainwashed with REAL rock & roll music (you know, Zepplin, the Stones, Floyd, the Beatles, the Who, Jimi, the Doors, the Dead, etc.) my whole life, these Australians are one of the few bands for whom I actually have respect outside of the late 60's/early 70's realm of greats.  The reason for the respect is that these guys are actually playing Rock and Roll (imagine that).  They're playing to audiences who aren't crying about how bad their childhood was (Disturbed & many others), who doesn't care to hear about how daddy didn't like me (Everclear), who are a little more intelligent than to be entranced by \\"creativity\\" through sexual shock value (Puddle of Mudd & others), and who are tired of hearing bands with only ONE sound and format (Nickleback, Linkin Park, & too many others).  These guys from Jet actually WRITE their OWN lyrics and PLAY their OWN instruments, which is a pretty awesome accomplishment in this age of R&B, hip-hop, the Blonde Headed Air Heads of Pop, and American Idol.  Grant it, on this album I hear plenty of George Harrison and Keith Richards rip offs on the guitars, and plenty of rip offs from the drums (sounds like a couple of Beatles beats from Abbey Road and SPLHCB), but where would Rock and Roll be without Clapton, Richards, and Page stealing chords from Robert Johnson and other great bluesmen?  And I've also read about how the lyrical compositions on the album were pretty weak, but I'll bet Lenny Kravitz would kill to have half of the lyrics they've written for this album (read the lyrics to \\"Fly Away\\" and \\"She's So Fine\\" sometime so you can see the \\"Lyrical Genius of Our Time\\" in full effect).  I personally think their lyrics are a bit weak (but that's me comparing them to Dylan, the Beatles, Pink Floyd, and others), but this IS their 1st album, and I don't remember Zepplin, the Beatles (remember \\"I Wanna Hold Your Hand\\"?), or Pink Floyd becoming lyrically competent until after a few more albums after their 1st albums.   <br /> <br />I guess the point I'm trying to make is that for a 1st time album, this one is a very good debut and a very refreshing sound from the slit-your-wrists \\"rock\\" being played to death today.  If you're a fan of just pure Rock and Roll, this is the album, with everything from hard rocking songs with the influence of the Stones and Black Crowes to piano ballads with the influence of McCartney/Lennon.  This album gives us a glimpse of their diverse talent that will only expand with time and could actually have them remembered 20 years from now.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I, like many other Buffy fans, tried to watch Firefly when it was on TV and failed miserably.  This was due to many things, mostly the fact that is was on Friday night, and because it was not shown in order and therefore made a minimum of sense. <br /> <br />Much better on the DVD, you get to watch everything in order, on demand, and without commercials.  I bought this at the Fox studio store for $20 and it was the best $20 I ever spent.  Like Joss Whedon's other shows, Firefly blends the best of the dramatic (\\"Out of Gas\\") with the humorous (\\"Jaynetown\\") for some truly excellent television.   <br /> <br />The DVDs are nicely packaged in individual slim cases so the discs aren't constantly falling out and getting scratched like the Buffy/Angel sets.  There are some neat extras too, notably Joss Whedon singing the theme song (his version is actually better than the one they used) and an awesome 5.1 audio track that makes it better than it ever could have been on TV.  <br /> <br />Buy this DVD set, and see the movie Serenity next year!
B0000959N0|5.0|Daredevil was cut down to make the running time shorter and to get a PG-13 rating. The Daredevil Director's Cut is huge improvement that puts back several minutes that were cut. It doesn't include some scenes shot for the PG-13 version. So Daredevil the Director's Cut is not just a basic director's cut but a different alternate version and I prefer this cut. It's impressive! Those who liked Daredevil, and those who didn't, should watch this. A great purchase for Daredevil fans.
B000679N96|3.0|Why can't record labels get it right? We fans have no problem shelling out cash for reissues, but it sure would be nice for them to be worth the money. What's positive? It's great to have all the bonus material, especially to have World War on CD, finally. I no longer have my TIB vinyl, but I believe all the original cover art is reproduced. Now for the bad news:    1. The sound is good, but other than being louder, it's not much of an improvement over my original Three Imaginary Boys or Boys Don't Cry CDs.  I'm no golden-eared audiophile, but I've got plenty of other remasters that are noticeably better than the versions they replaced.    2. No Killing an Arab. This is just ridiculous.    3. The cover art colors look horrible. I know it's not a great cover, but heck, they could have at least reproduced the original colors properly.    4. No plastic slipcase like other \\"Deluxe Edition\\" reissues. The slipcase is cardboard and will start wearing. Mine came slightly dented because of this.    5. World War is finally on CD... but it's either a different mix from the Boys Don't Cry LP, or there's just absolutely no high end on the tape they used - it's so muddy you can hardly hear the cymbals compared to the vinyl.    6. The faint talking bit from the beginning of \\"The Weedy Burton\\" is missing (my player's time seems to skip about 15 seconds between the last two tracks, so this could be a CD indexing problem).    7. The liner notes are a bit skimpy and some are hard to read over the background.    Are these picky issues? You bet they are, but if record companies are constantly going to pump out reissued product, make it worth it for the fans.
1400032717|4.0|There is one quotation from \\"Sherlock Holmes\\" in this book . It says Doctor Watson says to  Holmes, \\"His mind...was busy in endeavouring to frame some shceme into which all these strange and apparently disconnected episodes could be fitted.\\" <br />I think this quotation express about a feature of  this novel.

That's o.k., I suppose.  But man, we gotta see Time Fades Away on CD sometime, it's a great CD.  And what about the faded Archive series we were suppose to see, 15 years ago? <br /> <br />Before he put out a best of, there are other things that should see the light of day first. <br /> <br />
B00008WT5E|5.0|I was a snotty schoolboy in suburban Sydney in the 70's and can clearly remember all the singles and albums released by ac/dc ... except this LP and anything from it. I subsequently bought the LP in the 80's as back catalogue and for years I treasured the music and wondered if anyone else knew it existed and all of a sudden half the lunatics on amazon claim it's the band's best ever. <br /> <br />As it happens, it's my favourite. So that's not much of a review but in terms of consistency only TNT can compare (original version ... I've seen some hybrid monstrosities available on CD - buy at your peril).  <br /> <br />Following is a track by track thesis. Bugger it, let's stick with Gone Shootin having a pleasant chord. Buy and enjoy. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />

B000065V41|5.0|If you've seen one version of A Christmas Carol, you've seen them all! At least that's how I felt when I saw a recent made-for-TV musical version of the Charles Dickens' classic. After all, who doesn't know the story by now? I've written reviews for other filmed versions of A Christmas Carol here on Amazon.com, and you can see that by time I critiqued the one with Patrick Stewart, I wasn't impressed. My personal favorite is the 1984 TV-movie with George C. Scott and unlike many; I didn't really like the one with Alistair Sim (though his performance is without equal). I guess when you pick a favorite, all others seem unoriginal, offering nothing new.    Then there's The Muppet Christmas Carol...now THAT'S original!     Ok, so the story remains the same: in one night, Ebenezer Scrooge learns the meaning of Christmas from several ghostly visitors, transforming his character from bitterness to joyous repent. That hasn't changed, nor should it. It is a musical, but that also is not new, as there's a well known and incredibly long-winded musical called Scrooge starring Albert Finney. And another excellent actor portrays Scrooge in the muppet film, carrying on the tradition of Sim, Scott and Finney.    Nonetheless, the differences are pretty obvious. Most of the (normally human) characters are played by muppets. Kermit the Frog plays Bob Cratchet, Fozzie Bear plays Fezziwig - er - I mean Fozziwig, and, in an odd yet brilliant departure, Gonzo the Great plays Charles Dickens narrating his own tale. The advantage of showcasing muppets instead of human actors is that it allows the characters to be silly and funny in ways their human counterparts cannot. Thus the film becomes more fun in the process. Yet, it never loses its heart, and The Muppet Christmas Carol may well be the most touching of all versions.    The musical numbers in the muppet version are actually very well done. Musicals can become problematic when the songs start to eclipse the action and dialogue. That recent made-for-TV musical I previously mentioned is one such example. This film features about 7 or 8 songs, but feels like only 4 or 5...and that's a good thing. Such songs as \\"It Feels Like Christmas\\" and \\"When Love is Gone\\" are enjoyable and poignant...and don't be surprised if you find yourself whistling a couple of the tunes.     A lesser actor might have delivered an over-the-top performance as Ebenezer Scrooge for fear having the show stolen away by his muppet co-stars. But film legend Michael Caine decided to play Scrooge straight. While he does have some fun in the process, Sir Michael gives a real, honest-to-goodness performance here. It shouldn't have come as a surprise, especially to a huge Caine fan like myself. Yet he's an actor who still surprises on occasion. He strikes the perfect balance between humor and sentiment. It's fun to watch Caine sing as well, which is one of those surprises. While he doesn't have the best singing voice, he makes it work because he knows that Scrooge is so happy (at that point in the story) that Scrooge would break out into song, whether he sounded good or not! Michael Caine delivers a wonderful performance and has done the seemingly impossible, stolen much of the film away from muppets!    I, like many others, believe that Disney should produce a special edition DVD of The Muppet Christmas Carol in anamorphic widescreen. I'd also like to see the image cleaned up as the video I have now isn't the highest quality it could be. The film makes such good use of the beautifully elaborate sets and colorful costumes, it's a shame these images are so constricted in the 4:3 pan-and-scan format!    The Muppet Christmas Carol is more than a fun family film. It takes its place among the many fine adaptations of Dickens' classic story. With its warmth, humor and originality, I consider it one of the best!
B000002KIE|5.0|It's easy to dismiss the Sex Pistols debut (and finale) as a fitting example of an oft-overrated album.  Was it the first punk album? No.  Was it revolutionary? Depends on your viewpoint.  Was it even the best album to emerge from the punk genre?  The jury is still out.  But, oh does it rock?  You bet your bollocks it does!  What the Pistols brought to the table with this album was and remains one of the most irreverent, dangerous, and pulverizing musical statements in music history.  While the Ramones may have provided the blueprint for punk rock, the Lads from Britain certainly provided it with its ever-glorious sneer.      Johnny Rotten sounds like a mad hyena waiting to tear out of your speakers and grab you by the throat as he spits forth memorable manifesto's like, \\"God save the Queen, we mean it maaaaaann!!!\\" and \\"Get Pissed, Destroy!\\"  Meanwhile, Steve Jones' razor-sharp guitar spews venom throughout, leaving a path of destruction in its wake.  It's raw, unforgiving, deceptively humorous, often distasteful, undeniably exuberant, and above all a marked return to the meat and potatoes approach of good ol' no fluff rock and roll.  Classics such as \\"Holiday In The Sun,\\" \\"No Feelings,\\" \\"Pretty Vacant,\\" and the infamous \\"Anarchy In the UK,\\" will soon have you realizing what all the fuss is about.  While others since may have managed to do it better and with more consistency, few can claim that they shocked the system the way the Pistols did in '77.  Not only is it an essential punk album, but arguably one of the greatest statements in the history of rock n' roll.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I am a teenager that is really into Broadway (rare to find) and i LOVE THIS MUSICAL!!! Kristin Chenoweth is great at hitting both high and low notes...and the music just totally flows...the musical is breath-taking....A MUST BUY FOR ANY BROADWAY LOVER!!! <br />
B00003CXS4|5.0|I love this movie. Lots of action, but not in the usual formulaic way, great characters, perfect actors for the parts, and it's really, REALLY funny. Brad Pitt does a great job as Mickey, and Bullet Tooth Tony is awesome. If you like action and/or British movies give this one a try. Guy Ritchie is, for the most part, a good director. Now if we can just keep Madonna from influencing any more of his movie making decisions, lest we be subjected to another \\"Swept Away\\"...
0195067142|4.0|Of the many books on the various battles between the US and its enemies, only those written from participants provide a true insight into the conflict.  In fact, usually the best books are not written by those behind the lines calling the shots, but those who were on the front lines.  Indeed, I had previously heard of the many atrocities committed by the Japanese on both civilians and combatants, but to hear first hand about what certain US troops did during and after the heat of battle was sadly educative.  This book is recommended reading for anyone interested in what the Greatest Generation accomplished and it certainly made me more appreciative for our current freedom in this great country.  God bless the USA.
B0000669JL|5.0|I've had this album in various forms for many years and I never get tired of it. Marley's made lots of great music, but this is the best of the best. The topics of the songs, the emotion, the rhythm, and of course his voice & style all make this CD a necessity.
B00025ETIW|4.0|I love this CD, it is not hard to listen to at all, and they combine amazing guitar riffs with powerful vocals creating one of my favourite CDs at the moment. Every song is worth listening to if you like energy driven emo/punk i highly recommend it. best songs include 'you know what they do to guys like us in prison'-bert sings on this one so its twice as good, 'the ghost of you' 'to the end' and 'its not a fashion statement'
0312995423|2.0|The witting style is good and it is difficult to put down the book after you have started reading in.  However, there are way too many inaccuracies that even non-cyber-minded people can notice.  <SPOILER ALERT> For instance, the author should know that tampering with a file, which is available on the Internet, *after* the file has been downloaded by people throughout the world, does not tamper with the already downloaded files; and the least that can happen is that people will notice that two versions are going around! </SPOILER ALERT>

1400034205|4.0|As always with Maugham, the writing is superb, intelligent - this alone is a constant source of pleasure. <br /> <br />The story of the book, mainly a \\"bildungsroman\\" as the Germans call the genre (following the development of a character in the pursuit of Happiness), is typical of that genre. Quite well done although, to be frank, I think that (Hermann) Hesse has done the same thing but in a vastly more powerful way, in \\"Siddharta\\" for example (but also in \\"Narziss und Goldmund\\" and other books). With due respect to Maugham, his book was probably quiet advanced for the times, and Hesse had an easier time because the ideas he wanted to write about were much more accepted. <br /> <br />Anyway, all in all \\"The Razor's Edge\\" wins easily 4 stars - but not 5, no.
B0002OERI0|4.0|By now most of you have probably heard the song American Idiot, a vicious, direct attack on Bush and the lying media. That's basically the overall theme of the album in a concise package, but there's definately a lot more happening beneath the surface. <br /> <br />The album is a rock opera (much in the vein of, for example, The Who's Tommy) about the Jesus of Suburbia, your average suburbanite teen who's frustrated with all the lies he hears on TV. And yet, he faces confusion on what to really believe, relying on \\"graffiti in the bathroom stall like the holy scriptures\\". Eventually, this frustration and confusion becomes too much for him and the Jesus of Suburbia escapes to the big city. Here, he meets St. Jimmy, a destructive, street-wise rebel (Or is St. Jimmy merely an alter-persona of the Jesus of Suburbia? Rock operas tend to be notoriously vague in their storylines) and Whatshername, a fellow rebel with whom the Jesus of Suburbia develops a relationship. Eventually though, Whatshername realizes the emptiness of rebellion without action. She leaves, and twenty years down the line St. Jimmy dies (or the Jesus of Suburbia puts that part of himself to rest) and the Jesus of Suburbia is trapped in a dead-end white collar job \\"filling out paper...at the facility on East 12th Street\\". Eventually he returns to the suburbs, realizing that unfocused rebellion is just as bad as submitting to the media. <br /> <br />The concept of rebellion isn't new to rock, concept album or not (see also: Queensryche's Operation: Mindcrime), but Green Day has succeeded in making an instantly relatable album that's relevant to our times. After all, who hasn't felt the confusion and frustration of Bush and the media being fed into one ear and anti-Bush sentiment in the other? And Green Day back up their message with great lyrics too. For example, some of the most scathing lyrics can be found in the song Holiday: <br />Sieg Heil to the President Gasman <br />Bombs away is your punishment<br />Pulverize the Eiffel Towers <br />Who criticize your government <br /> <br />But of course, no concept album, no matter how deep the story or message, will hold up without great songs. Where would Tommy be, for example, without Pinball Wizard? Though I admit that the radio-played singles from this album aren't the best. The title track sounds like anything from Dookie, while Boulevard of Broken Dreams is a bit...derivative. Nevertheless, when your musical career spans from the punkfest of Dookie to the more folksy Warning, you definately have a large palette to work with. And while the whole of American Idiot strays more towards the Dookie sound, the music still shows a lot of diversity. For example, witness the slow introspection of Wake Me Up When September Ends and Whatshername, the dramatic cadence and chanting of Are We the Waiting and Nobody Likes You, the Indian rhythms of Extraordinary Girl, or Rock and Roll Girlfriend which sounds like of all things, Grease. In my opinion, the best songs on the album are the immensely catchy (in the vein of Minority) Holiday and the alternating gentle/grinding of Give Me Novacaine. <br /> <br />And let's not forget the two songs that bookend the storyline, Jesus of Suburbia and Homecoming, both clocking in at over nine minutes. If that seems intimidating, I should state that both of these \\"songs\\" are actually 5-song cycles. Nevertheless, with the way each track's five songs flow into each other and yet keeps focus throughout, it's definately quite a step up in the songwriting ability of the band. <br /> <br />But in the end, American Idiot, with its vast song cycles and story arc, might require a little more focus than the average MTV-er might want to put in. But for those who are willing to make that kind of effort, you'll find an album that shows Green Day showing an immense amount of intelligence and maturity (who'd've thought, eh?)
B00005QDW5|4.0|A Pink Floyd 'Best Of' is not really possible with only two discs. Even at 160 minutes at one's disposal, so much is skipped. The entirety of both DARK SIDE OF THE MOON and WISH YOU WERE HERE would have to be included, most of ANIMALS and a good chunk of THE WALL. I would even argue for a fair amount of THE FINAL CUT, but I think that'd be stretching it. As is, the collection is nifty; the artwork is really great, and it's a good way to kill two-and-a-half hours. They should have included a track from each album and maybe some more rarities. I would have much rather heard \\"Point Me at the Sky\\" and \\"Fat Old Sun\\" than the chunk of \\"Marooned\\" and all of \\"Keep Talking.\\" The studio cut of \\"What Shall We Do Now\\" would have been a better WALL era rarity than \\"When The Tigers Broke Free,\\" especially now that the latter is included on the remaster of THE FINAL CUT. Oh well. <br /> <br />All in all, this is a good album to get people into Pink Floyd, but I'd say try them with WISH YOU WERE HERE and DARK SIDE first.

This is, however, the finest work that the average man can actually read without being entirely baffled by the intrigue of the female mind.

B0000028M7|5.0|Layne, Jerry and the boys really created a brooding masterpiece that definitely epitomizes the grunge era. I remember reading an article on Alice in Chains during the time that this album came out, and Jerry Cantrell mentioned that alot of his harmonies with Layne took him back to when he sang choir music as a boy, which I think is really a predominant influence to the eerie quality the songs on this album are laden with. It's fused with alot of frustration, disillusionment and past disappointments, but they're all looked at in a very adult perspective; that those things are all a part of life and something that we all share in and deal with, making it an album that really empathizes with its listeners. It's also an album of heart, strength and courage, as heard in the song \\"Rooster\\", a tribute to Cantrell's father who fought in Vietnam. A very powerful and mature album that goes above and beyond the call of duty, and an essential to everyone's grunge collection.

B000255LNE|5.0|Before Phil Collins,three other artists that I know of who put out LOVE SONGS albums are The Beatles,Michael Bolton and Jefferson Airplane/Starship. Here in this collection,there are two new or previously unreleased studio tracks,TEARING AND BREAKING and I'VE BEEN TRYING. There are also a few tracks that did not appear on any of Collins' albums like YOU'LL BE IN MY HEART and SOMEWHERE. Previously released tracks from Collins' albums are THIS MUST BE LOVE and IF LEAVING ME IS EASY from 1981's FACE VALUE,DON'T LET HIM STEAL YOUR HEART AWAY from 1982's HELLO I MUST BE GOING,ONE MORE NIGHT from 1985's platinum NO JACKET REQUIRED,DO YOU REMEMBER from 1989's BUT SERIOUSLY,CAN'T TURN BACK THE YEARS,EVERYDAY and PLEASE COME OUT TONIGHT from 1993's BOTH SIDES,IT'S IN YOUR EYES from 1996's DANCE INTO THE LIGHT,LEAST YOU CAN DO,CAN'T STOP LOVING YOU and the title track from 2002's TESTIFY. There are live recordings of SEPARATE LIVES from SERIOUS HITS LIVE,released in 1990,MY GIRL,a hit for The Temptations and ALWAYS. This album could have used YOU CAN'T HURRY LOVE from HIMBG. That was a hit for The Supremes in 1967. Also what was wrong with any love songs that Collins' former band Genesis recorded? What was wrong with IN TOO DEEP and HOLD ON MY HEART? Collins' voice was heard on both those songs. There is also on this album a live rehearsal version of TRUE COLORS. The studio version appeared on 1998's HITS and was also a hit for Cyndi Lauper twelve years earlier. Take note of the international postal envelope on the cover. There are also a few black & white photos of Collins and a few color ones as well. Take note of two lipstick prints also. With the two new tracks and the two showtunes,PC fans will have a motive to pick up a copy of this album.

B00067BBQE|5.0|I am a long time Evanescence fan and have long waited for a DVD.  Here it is.  I knew Amy Lee wouldn't have it any other way but to have a kick-ass DVD to release.  Even so, It exceeded my expectations.  If you have seen Evanescence live, you will love this.  If you haven't seen or heard live recordings you may be surprised to hear the spin Amy Lee puts into her live shows.  She gives a little growl in Going Under and is captivating in her performance of My Immortal. <br /> <br />The menues were very well done and are a tribute to just a small amount of the emmense creativity of Amy Lee.  The behind the scenes segment capture the personality of the band very well and accurately depict life on the road.  I am the son of a guitarist who toured during much of my childhood.  I remember living so much of the lifestyle shown and can say first hand that it is not skewed to advertising bias.  An included blooper reel has you chuckling right along with the band. <br /> <br />Doing something a little new, Amy Lee throws in a cover of Thoughtless during her show and in my opinion outdid the original.  On the CD is also an added track of the previously unreleased song, Missing.  This song in my opinion should have been performed during their show.  It is an amazing peice of work.  I was glad to finally have a high quality copy of that recording. <br /> <br />This album captures the energy of the crowd and the band.  A must in any music collection.
6304143184|5.0|This film has always been quite famous and i can understand why.Famous actors such as drew barrymore that played gertie and Director Steven spielberg a director of quite a lot of films. It is bought to life by a cute little alien E.T, 2 kids who befriended it and took him in to their home to keep. Little gertie is the last to find outabout him and literally screams at first. I think this film would be quite boring for some maybe because of the actors but i loved it.
B000002A46|5.0|The Mariah Carey that we were first introduced to was not only talented but natural.  [I often wonder how Mariah Carey became distasteful, superficial, mundane, and unattractive during the decline of her career.]  This Christmas album is a plethora of not only her talent, but her warmth and enthusiasm as well: it is a true representation of why we she initially succeeded...no excessive \\"glitter,\\" if you may.  The inclusive energy and voices of a choir make you feel as though you're watching their recital.  The songs are familiar, yet unique; upbeat, yet emotional; modern, yet classical.  No wonder it's still widely played a decade later.  It's one of the best Christmas albums that I own!
B0002EXH54|5.0|Can you make a perfect album even better?  The answer is, yes.  Megadeth's re-issuing of their catalog features all of their albums with remastered sound, and remixed bonus tracks.  \\"Peace Sells...But Who's Buying?\\" was Megadeth's first masterpiece, released a few years after their debut album.  Any real metal fan knows just how influential this album was, is, and will be for years to come yet, but the real question is how this new edition sounds.  The remastering process applied to \\"Peace Sells...\\" makes the album sound crisper and cleaner, with a little more bass here, a little less guitar there, etc.  Now while the album does sound better than ever, the rawness that was found on the original release, which can be attributed to some somewhat shoddy production, isn't here as much thanks to the remastering, but that can't take away just how heavy and important \\"Peace Sells...\\" is.  The bonus tracks include remixes of \\"Wake Up Dead\\", \\"The Conjuring\\", the classic title track, and \\"Good Mourning/Black Friday\\"; all of which are fairly solid little bonuses.  All in all, it's nice getting to hear \\"Peace Sells...\\" the way it was originally intended to sound, but if you already own the original album, don't feel the need to shell out the cash for this.
B00007E8O5|5.0|Jerry Cantrell may have been with on of the best bands ever but his talent is endless, just check out \\"Boggy Depot\\" this ablum explores a different side to Jerry its kind of softer stuff with a country twist but it still kicks.  <br />With Degradation Trip you get the best of what Jerry has to offer, its a real trip from the first to last song, it explores many different emotions and can go from kick A__ to mellow and back. I have been a long time fan and try to promote Jerry when ever I get the chance. He is the Best! If you like Alice In Chains you'll love Jerry, If you don't know Alice then listen to Jerry first and form a fresh opinion. I can take him either way!

B00003CXCT|1.0|What did we do to deserve this, George Lucas?  The old version of these movies were fine!  That is why you have millions of dollars. Are you so bored that you feel that you have to fix things that are'nt broke? All us fans really wanted was to have clean, brand new, dvd versions of the ORIGINAL  THEATRICAL RELEASES, and you have to deny us that. Wasn't Attack Of the Clones, and Phantom Menace enough punishment?  We don't need new scenes with all this computer graphic stuff in it. Save it for your new movies.  I'm not even a huge fan of Star Wars, but This dvd set upsets me for all of your hardcore fans.  I should go get my laserdisc player fixed because that's the only way I'll be able to see the original movies on a disc! Oh, by the way. I can't wait till Revenge of the Sith comes out!! yeah, right.

B000001IQH|5.0|When this album first came out, I picked it up because I loved Rancid's self-titled debut and \\"Let's Go\\". When I first listened to the CD and heard every song, I pushed the repeat button, layed on my bed, and listened to it again and again until I knew every lyric, beat, and rift by heart. More driven and inspired than their last album and more \\"punk\\" than ever before. Low and behold, \\"Ruby Soho\\", one of my favorite tracks, was on the radio. \\"Cool\\", I thought. Wrong. Before I knew it, \\"...And Out Came the Wolves\\" was in every hippy, punk, emo, edge-core, and soccer mom's CD volume, playing in homes nation-wide, being enjoyed by father and son alike. I had to puke. I let out about ten pounds of human waste in the form of vomit. Punk isn't listened to, punk isn't enjoyed, kids don't pick up a punk CD and put it beside their Dave Matthews, Tupac, or Clint Black...Punk is heard, punk is felt, punk motivates and inspires...You don't sing along with punk because it's catchy, you sing along because you feel what they're saying, you know how sh*tty things get and how the world works, you like to rebel and beat fat kids up and cause commotion and be stupid and do what you feel like doing. Okay, I lied. You can like punk and you can like this album and not be a punk, just don't say you like Rancid and the only song you know is \\"Ruby Soho\\". I'm out of my mind. Just ignore all of this.
B00063F8B2|5.0|I saw this movie with my nephew, father and sister in our pre-holiday preparation. The movie is incredible for its atmosphere, effects and especially the music.<br /><br />I bought the soundtrack and was right back in the movie. \\"When Christmas Comes to Town\\" is a beautiful song with a haunting, Harry Potter-like melody.<br /><br />The mixture of half totally new songs, musical scores and old but not necessarily often played classics makes a good background for any holiday music playing.<br /><br />And absolutely, crank up the stereo, especially in a closed environment like a car, and enjoy the first track as it comes. The excitement of a roaring train gets ever kids' heart, young or old, pumping.
B00008WG3U|5.0|What? I like the CD...Did I do something wrong? Great from beginning to end. The political songs are political, the silly songs are silly, and the overdose ballad/acoustic song is super duper uber blooper. That means it's good. Kind of like \\"Punk in Drublic\\" with the last song being an acoustic song about some f*ck up. To the man named JollyGreenMetalHead \\"2002\\" or whatever your really anti-straight name is, you are ridiculous and I think it's hilarious. I laugh in your weak, childish face, and if Arnold were young again and I knew him and could pay him to beat you up, I would. Fat Mike running all the way to the bank laughing...You think he can run? He's FAT! No offense to the weight-challenged. And Warped Tour a homosexual festival? Hardly a festival, more like a gathering or sect.

They're great.\\" As much as I loved Moon Safari, The Virgin Suicides Score is still the best Air work in my book.   <br />I struggled with 10,000Hz Legend. I don't think it's Air at the top of their game. <br />Now to Talkie Walkie. I pre-ordered this cd. When it arrived, I listened to it a couple times, was really disappointed, put in on a shelf, and haven't listened to it again until this week. I decided to give it another shot. Wow...it blew me away. I've been listening to it non-stop this week. I can't believe I dismissed this so early on.  <br /> <br /> <br />My advice to you, give it a few listens. If you're like me, you'll learn to love this too.
074322454X|5.0|Band of Brothers is a true to life story about the training and war experiences that Easy Company of the 506th regiment, 101st airborne lived through during the Second World War.  The men of Easy Company were like every other company put together, all men who came from either a small town or major city.  Yet when they begin the hard training the men endure physical testing that they have never experienced in their lives.  Yet the men grow and build up together and begin to create bonds unlike any others.  Due to the great amount of pressure they are being put through and the most difficult training the army has to offer because of the brand new Airborne infantry which Easy company along with the rest of the 101st airborne and other divisions who were forging the new concept of airborne infantry.  The reason why this book is incredibly well written and worth reading is because the author Stephen Ambrose interviews all of the men who served in easy company from its formation, what they had gone through and what were their personal accounts of that certain day or battle that they took part in.  This book takes WWII to a whole different level when you think of the sacrifices that were made to ensure victory.  The men of easy company distinguished themselves as being one of the best rifle companies in the entire world and had contributed more than any other company, and endured more than any other company who had seen combat in the War.  The author writes the book in such a way to describe what went on in a fashion that paints a picture that you can imagine in your mind.  You can just picture what the men of easy company had gone through while being dropped out of a plane under the cover of darkness from the skis over Normandy before the seaborne invasion, to being huddled in a foxhole that they dug while being encircled by the relentless German enemy while in Bastogne with no reinforcements.  The book gives a profound feeling that at that time in Easy company's existence, hope was not a feeling of a safe return home away from all war, but that hope represents that you would not let yourself down, and you would not let your comrades down and thinking about getting home later.  The very stories of this book will describe to you an unforgettable story about the citizen soldiers who stepped up and became the best fighting force in the entire army.   <br />     Easy company was by far one of the most distinguished and recognized companies throughout the entire war, for this book are the story of the men who fought and died for each other.  There story will live on forever in the minds of the people who served in easy company and survived all of the war, death, and pure hell of being in combat in Europe during WWII. <br /> <br />-Ryan Mancini <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000002JOH|5.0|This is one of the greatest Metal records of all time, hands down,  its heavy its fast its melodic, its got it all.  shame on anybody who doesn't have it already,  if you don't have it BUY IT!!!!!!!!!    \\"Regular People\\" has one of the greatest riffs ever!    This album has NO FILLER what so ever,  every minute is great.    This has been one of my favorite albums since it came out.     My personal favorites are, \\"Regular People\\", \\"Live in a Hole\\", \\"Rise\\", \\"Hollow\\", \\"Mouth for War\\" and of course \\"F***ing Hostile\\",  but for real, every song on here is good.    this along with \\"Cowboys from Hell\\", stand up there as two of the best metal albums you'll ever hear period.    Hint: If you are not familiar with Pantera get Cowboys from Hell, and Far Beyond Driven, (along with this one) first!    One of the greatest rock guitarists is gone.    R.I.P. Dimebag.    P.S. to reply to one guy, theres nothing \\"trendy\\" about it, myself along with most of these other reviewers have listened to and liked Pantera for a long time,  and me, myself have been a Pantera fan (as well as Ramones fan) long before any of them died,  and probably long before YOU had ever heard of either band.
B00006690G|1.0|No wonder most of the world thinks we are debased, filthy heathens when we treat scum like Marshall Matthers as royalty for being a tasteless, classless, faithless, shameless deviant. \\"It'd be so lovely Without You\\"
B0006399FS|4.0|Like many people on this site, I've been reading a lot of the reviews here and it seems that people are either loving this album or hating it. The negative reviews seem to stem from the opinion that U2 sound \\"too much like themselves\\" on this album. That there is not enough experimentation. And that point would be hard to argue. But like their contemporaries R.E.M., U2 are kind of stuck between the proverbial rock (no pun intended) and hard place. For example, R.E.M.'s latest, Around the Sun, has been relatively panned because they don't sound enough like themselves! Too much experimentation! So I get the feeling that if U2 had gone the same route, there would be just as many complaints. I think that's the price you pay when you reach the level of exposure that they have. They must have figured, if you can't please everyone, you might as well please yourselves (and a few million listeners).    Ok, the experimentation thing: The beauty of an album like Achtung Baby was that it challenged the listener to question his/her's view not only of U2, but of what popular music was supposed to be. Let's face it, when it was released I think most of us expected another Joshua Tree or Rattle n Hum. What we got was completey unexpected, nearly mind-blowing (at least for a band of their popularity), but eventually embraced because it did challenge us and we ended up growing with the band (At least that's the way I felt). They realized that they had no other choice if they wanted to continue as a band. Otherwise they were dangerously close to going the way of most other 80's bands - straight to the discount bin.    Now, while I think HTDAAB is a very solid and catchy album with many very good songs on it, I don't think it reaches the heights of Achtung Baby, Joshua Tree or even ATYCLB for that matter. And it does sound a bit \\"cut n pasted\\" in sections. On the positive side it is a much more even album than ATYCLB, each song is very listenable and catchy, if not technically or musically outstanding. Themes of love, peace and God reverberate throughtout the lyrics. Plus, these songs will sound fantastic live. And what other band 25 years into their recording careers can come up with this many catchy hooks, even if some of them may be slightly recycled?     The Songs:  1. Vertigo - Undeniably catchy with vacuous lyrics...or are they? Listen more closely and don't get hung up on the whole \\"Uno, Dos, Tres, Catorce!\\"...it's possible Bono is messing with you.  2. Miracle Drug - Delivers in all the right places. I wish it was about something else because I feel silly belting out these strange lyrics: \\"Of science and the human heart, There is no limit\\". Does borrow heavily from \\"Beautiful Day\\" with the drums at the end...  3. Sometimes... - A very good song, right up there with \\"One\\" IMHO.  Bono's vocal is a little weak in spots. Slight \\"cut n paste\\" feel.  4. Love & Peace or Else - Probably one of the weaker tracks. Ambiguous lyrics. Musically it sounds like an outtake from Rattle n Hum.  5. City of Blinding Lights - Cheesy in spots, but delivers with the sing-along chorus & bridge. Another one that sounds cut n pasted.  6. All Because of You - Only the hardest rocking song they've ever done. Yeah, Bono's vocal is a little off in the chrous, but it ain't supposed to be perfect, is it? Not bad for 45 year olds.  7. A Man & A Woman - Not a bad tune at all. Kind of reminds me of Wild Honey from ATYCLB.  8. Crumbs From Your Table - For me, probably the most boring song on the album. Predictable lyrically and musically. Very much a U2-by-Numbers song.  9. One Step Closer - This album's \\"40\\". A very nice song that should have been the closer.  10. Original of the Species - A little bit of Beatles, a little bit of Oasis (which is redundant, no?). Unusual song from U2, but I like it nonetheless.  11. Yahweh - This one is too simple. They probably wrote this one in their sleep. And Bono's strained \\"Yahweh!\\" is slightly embarrassing.    So with HTDAAB, maybe there is no growth. Maybe it does go down a little too easy. Maybe there is no musical revolution happening.  Maybe that isn't what the roles of 45 year old musicians should be. Maybe, just maybe, they already had their revolution with Joshua Tree & Achtung Baby and what we get now are just some very good, catchy, pop songs that are infectious, put a smile on your face and don't leave your head for weeks. And at the end of the day, is that really so bad?    On a side note, there's been a lot of talk about U2 selling out with the iPod ad. While I would agree that they are certainly walking a fine line with that promotion, it should be pointed out that they were not paid a dime to do those ads. Maybe that changes your opinion slightly, maybe not. Just wanted to make sure you've got your facts straight before forming your opinions.
0385513755|2.0|As I was reading \\"Angels and Demons,\\" Brown's earlier work featuring Robert Langdon, I was thinking how nice it would be to have pictures of all the incredible art and architecture he writes about.  On my next visit to Cosco, lo and behold, there was an illustrated edition of \\"Da Vinci Code.\\"  So I shelled out the extra bucks to get it.  Well worth it, too.<br /><br />This is not exactly great literature; it is suitable for reading on the beach or on the Boeing.  The characters are one-dimensional and exist only to further the scavenger-hunt plot.  The French girl \\"Sophie Neveu,\\" like the purportedly Italian \\"Vittoria Vetra\\" in \\"Angels and Demons,\\" speaks in American colloquialisms.  But to be fair, this book is a page turner and a quick read, comparable to a Michael Crichton or Clive Cussler, better than a Tom Clancy.<br /><br />I am told there are people who take the Da Vinci Code's plot, including its theological grotesqueries, seriously.  If so, that is pathetic, and more than a little bit frightening.  The whole Priory-of-Sion-keeping-alive-the-secret-knowledge-of-the-descendants-of-Jesus-and-Mary-Magdalene part, in other words, the core of the plot, is based upon an acknowledged fraud perpetrated by a Frenchman named Pierre Plantard.<br /><br />\\"Fact\\" Dan Brown breathlessly tells us in the front of the book, \\"the Priory of Sion--a European secret society founded in 1099--is a real organization.  In 1975, Paris's Biblioteque Nationale discovered parchments known as Les Dossiers Secrets, identifying numerous members of the Priory of Sion, including Sir Isaac Newton, Botticelli, Victor Hugo, and Leonardo da Vinci.\\"<br /><br />Well, not quite.  Brown gets this story from the 1980s book \\"Holy Blood, Holy Grail,\\" a work from which Brown freely and indiscriminantly borrowed.  But the documents lodged in the Biblioteque were forgeries.  The \\"priory of Sion\\" doesn't go back to 1099, Pierre Plantard and some friends started it in 1956.  It was all a hoax, and it has been exposed by a series of French books and a 1996 BBC documentary.  (See, e.g., Laura Miller, \\"The Da Vinci Con\\"; Amy D. Bernstein, \\"The French Confection.\\")<br /><br />What is worse is the ludicrous burlesque of church history that Brown foists on his innocent readers.  Brown states that Christ's followers considered Christ a mere mortal man, not the son of God, until the Council of Nicea, at which time the church voted to make him God.  The nature of Christ's divinity (the Arian controversy) was the main topic at the council of Nicea, but everyone already agreed that he was divine.  Arius acknowledge that Christ was divine, but argued that he was created by, and not co-eternal with, the father.  The orthodox trinitarian view, adopted by the council, was that Christ was co-eternal with the Father, of one substance with the Father, and \\"begotten\\" not created.  The controversy was subtle enough that Constantine didn't understand what all the fuss was about.  But the vast majority of the Bishops in attendence didn't consider it trivial, and the orthodox trinitarian view prevailed.<br /><br />Of course, everyone agreed that Christ was divine, because claims of his divinity are all throughout the gospels and the epistles of the New Testament.  To get around this inconvenient fact, Brown claims that Constantine foisted a whole new Bible on the Church: \\"The Bible, as we know it today, was collated by the pagan roman emperor Constantine the Great.\\"  \\"Contantine commissioned and financed a new Bible . . .\\"  What utter garbage and nonsense!!!  The Council of Nicea had nothing to do with finalizing the New Testament Canon.  It wasn't even on the agenda.  Most of the New Testament books had already been accepted by general use and agreement within the church 150 years before Contantine's time, and the Canon wouldn't even be proposed in its final form until more than 40 years after the Council of Nicea, and 30 years after Constantine's death.<br /><br />So enjoy your beach novel, but if you think any of this bears any relation to actual facts or history, you have problems far more serious than deciding how to while away a few hours on a flight./>So enjoy your beach novel, but if you think any of this bears any relation to actual facts or history, you have problems far more serious than deciding how to while away a few hours on a flight.

B00005JMXX|1.0|The Day After Tomorrow (Roland Emmerich, 2004)<br /><br />Long, long ago, in a galaxy far, far away, there came to be something known as the \\"disease-of-the-week\\" movie. While the term wasn't popularized until the CBS TV-movies of the seventies, the original disease-of-the-week movie was Billy Wilder's 1945 Oscar winner The Lost Weekend, which portrays four days in the life of alcoholic Ray Milland. The Lost Weekend was also the first in a species of truly terrifying disease-of-the-week movies-- those who influence public perception, and ultimately public policy, on a particular topic so much that they become more of a keystone in the formation of that policy than any scientific papers.<br /><br />The Day After Tomorrow is the first of that kind of movie we've seen in a long while, and it may be the most terrifying of the lot. Roland Emmerich directed his own screenplay, and his authority to comment on environmentally conscious topics is obvious from his earlier treatment of the subject (the 1998 remake of Godzilla). The movie's plot takes the already exaggerated-out-of-control beliefs we have about global warming and takes them to the most absurd conclusions possible (though to his credit, Emmerich does manage to trick us into thinking those conclusions are not quite as absurd as they are). It would all be quite amusing if we didn't have the model of The Lost Weekend in the background, telling us people will accept this as gospel in a few years. The movie deserves zero stars as a starting point for being morally offensive on both surface and subtextual levels.<br /><br />Aside from the utter idiocy of the premise, which shouldn't really surprise us (after all, Hollywood has been exaggerating inanities for decades), the movie takes a stellar cast and puts them into seventies disaster-movie mode (a subgenre of the disease-of-the-week movie that eventually grew to eclipse its parent genre; you still see The Poseidon Adventure on TV, but when was the last time you saw The Greatest Thing That Almost Happened?). Every possible scene where Emmerich could have inserted someone managing to get out of a scrape just in time, he did. Everywhere a character could stop and expound on how awful global warming is, he does. The whole thing is utterly predictable if you've seen any two disaster movies from the seventies during your lifetime.<br /><br />That said, the cast makes the best of what they get. Jake Gyllenhaal, who could previously do no wrong (he almost singlehandedly took the dumbest script on the planet, Bubble Boy, and turned it into a work of comic genius), even gets swallowed up in the general stupidity. Given that, you know that the other above-average-but-not-great stars here are probably going to fail. Dennis Quaid gets a chance to overact, and takes it as often as possible. Sela Ward, playing Quaid's wife, is in the script as a \\"rule tool\\": Quaid cannot have a son (Gyllenhaal) unless he's married, and cannot survive unless he has someone to come home to. Emmy Rossum, as Gyllenhaal's love interest, and Tamlyn Tomita, as Quaid's partner's love interest, serve the same function. Both are a joy to watch on the screen, and all too easy on the eyes, but aren't given anything near enough screen time to bring anything to their parts.<br /><br />The most astonishing piece of casting wizardry to be found in this film is the presence of Ian Holm, as a colleague of Quaid's trapped in a Scotland weather station with two of his co-workers. Holm's character exists solely to feed Quaid's team information from farther north, so they can predict the course of the storm that freezes the northern hemisphere. This is obvious from the moment the word \\"Scotland\\" appears on the screen in a subtitle. Holm's character is entirely two-dimensional. In a horror film, he'd be a brainless, buxom blonde walking around with \\"kill me\\" tattooed on her forehead. What on earth possessed Holm to take this role? Gyllenhaal being in this film is excusable; he's still a rising star, and having his name on a blockbuster, however bad, is certain to entrench him further down in the minds of casting directors. Holm, however, has previously had impeccable taste in his choice of films. Even those films that may have otherwise looked dismal in concept he accepted turned out to be some of the best in their genre; one need look no farther than Alien as testament to this. More recently, Existenz, Joe Gould's Secret, and From Hell are all excellent examples of the same. So how could the man have looked at this script and had the thought (and this is the only reason I can discern for him accepting a role in this mess) that Roland Emmerich could make a film as well as Ridley Scott, David Cronenberg, Stanley Tucci, or the Hughes brothers?<br /><br />The only thing about The Day After Tomorrow that makes it worth watching in any way, shape, or form is the watchability of the thing itself. Like every disaster movie, The Day After Tomorrow cranks up the pace from the get-go and never lets up. The pace is constantly fast, and as a movie that goes a smidgen over two hours, it still runs faster than some movies of just over half its length I've seen recently. Were it not such a morally deficient movie, The Day After Tomorrow would define the mindless disaster flick, and could have actually been the start of a renaissance of the seventies disaster movie, which many film fans (and critics) rank near the top of their guilty-pleasures lists. As it stands, however, this monstrosity only goes to show, like Emmerich's preceding films The Patriot and Godzilla, that when Roland Emmerich directs a good movie (or even a mediocre movie, like Independence Day), it's the exception to the rule. The Day After Tomorrow is, quite simply, awful on every level. Half a star because Gyllenhaal and Rossum actually manage to make a paper-thin romantic subplot look like it might actually have some substance.le; he's still a rising star, and having his name on a blockbuster, however bad, is certain to entrench him further down in the minds of casting directors.

B00005M91K|5.0|This is a one-of-a-kind film, literally.  Regardless of how many awards a film may win I can always pick out scenes that could have been done better; except for this film.  I'm still overwhelmed with the level of mastery in this film.  The use of no words in the entire film actually adds to getting the message across.  The camera shots combined with the music are completely unmatched.  I haven't ever spoken to anyone who didn't love this film.  The best thing to do is to just get it and watch it by yourself.  It is definitely not a film that you talk during.  I'm tempted to write about the content of the film, but I think it is better to be surprised because it is truly a wide eye-opening look at reality.  It is such a powerful video that I'm going to buy another one just to donate to the local video store, because everyone on the planet needs to watch this.  I highly advice everyone to make sure to see this film as soon as possible; it can give you a new outlook about life.
B000067IZ3|2.0|Traffic is an average movie which does not inspire enough interest to get out of that pigeon hole. It deals with many stories and they are all related on some way, obviously the director was watching some foreign films, for this is nothing new. Most of the stories are preposterous, take for example the wife of a drug dealer, in a few weeks she is talking to dangerous drug leaders in Mexico as if she knew what she was doing. Also, the drug czar wandering around in the ghettos of Baltimore, these scenes do not add up and as a result the film is mostly a compendium of utter boredom that drags on.
B00004T9UF|5.0|This is definently one of the top ten rap albums of this millenium up there with outkast stankonia, jay-z the blueprint, and nas the lost tapes, and nas street's disciple. Any one who considers themself a rap fan should pick this album up. This is Eminem at his best and angriest. Dr.Dre's Production is just as twisted and nasty as Em's rhymes. This is a album i can go through without skipping a song. My favorite song on this album is \\"Stan\\" because it heartwrench, sad, and disturbing at the same time. A must for any rap fan. Truly Eminem's best album.If you don't have it pick it up now!
6304806418|2.0|Evita suffers from many problems that disallow it to be watched as a complete and enjoyable film. Not only is the continuity vulgarized, the director often manages to confuse the film viewer as to what exactly is going on. This is not a great film, not even a good one, what carries it are the production values, songs, and locations.<br /><br />After getting through the extremely boring commencement of the picture, I noticed that there would be no dialogue in this picture at all, at every moment someone was singing a silly and repetitive song. This isn't bad in its whole, but when everyone is already confused about the character it becomes extremely agitating. The voice dubs of the songs are so apparent that the film seems contrived and indifferent to its tackiness. Here we have people that are supposed to be singing and yet the contorted sound room song is playing and they are merely mouthing their parts. Banderas is terrible in his singing abilities yet his presence is well recommended. In this role he plays the conscience of the working class, a \\"Che Guevera\\" type revolutionary whom witnesses Eva's ascension and ultimate fall.<br /><br />Madonna is wonderful in this role, not only can she move around the screen in charismatic beauty but her songs are capable and worthy. The sets are absolutely gorgeous and the costumes are fabulous. What we get in the end is a romanticized MTV style video but it is dreadfully long at 2 1/2 hours. I couldn't wait til the termination. Everything is not a concise whole, so the film flounders and ultimately fails.
B00005JN4O|5.0|Marc Forster's \\"Finding Neverland\\" is a poignant and impeccably crafted testimonial to the power of imagination and how it renews the human spirit in the face of tragedy. I can imagine some people might be disappointed that the film isn't as \\"magical\\" as \\"Peter Pan,\\" the beloved play whose creation it depicts. But Forster isn't creating a fantasy; he is telling a story about real people and the resources of imagination, love and faith they rely on to stay alive. The movie takes some liberties with the story of how James M. Barrie (Johnny Depp) befriends Sylvia Llewellyn Davies (Kate Winslet) and her young sons; for example, Sylvia had five sons, not four, and her husband, Arthur, was still alive when Barrie met the family. But emotionally the film feels right: as Barrie takes Sylvia and the boys on a magical mystery tour of his fecund imagination, the film switches between reality and fantasy with masterful aplomb, and never fails to engage and move its audience. \\"Finding Neverland\\" is generous enough to find sympathy even for its less likable characters--Barrie's beautiful but chilly wife Mary (Radha Mitchell) and Sylvia's staid, disapproving mother, Emma du Maurier (Julie Christie). Even though Barrie briefly imagines Emma as Captain Hook, she is not a monster, merely a loving but overly starchy woman with very fixed ideas about what is proper and what isn't. The performances are every bit as excellent as you could wish, and the photography and production design are marvelous. Kelly Macdonald, seen briefly as the actress playing Peter Pan at its premiere, is so good that one hopes she'll get to play the role in earnest before too long. (I must also say a kind word for the actor who plays Nana.) I could hear sobs from the audience toward the end of this film, and my guess is that if you don't reach for your handkerchief at least once, you're probably a Captain Hook type yourself. (And if you don't want to go out immediately and buy a Newfoundland after seeing Porthos, the dog that inspired Nana, you just don't like dogs!)os, the dog that inspired Nana, you just don't like dogs!)
B00003CXE7|3.0|Although I wouldn't say this is a \\"good\\" movie or even a \\"classic\\" like the muddled brain dead teens who claim it is the best piece of cinema in the world, I would call it entertaining and nothing more. The film was created to make money, not to stimulate our intellect and I understand that and in the end I said to myself, i could see this again, only for the ability of Crowe to convey to us the power of loss and imprisonment and especially for the stunning battles sequences that are exciting. The plot is unbelievable, and the special effects even worse and even the editing is loose and discordant but again, Crowe's presence and the fights are terrific so don't go to the theater thinking this is Spartacus.
B00005JKLZ|2.0|I missed this film when it was in the theaters, and finally added it to my Netflix queue this past weekend, only to be disappointed. In the initial scenes during the late 1800's, the scenery and the time machine itself looked good, and I had no complaints. But then the \\"future\\" scenes and cheap visual effects started coming, culminating in a not-so-tribal group of future homosapiens where, apparently, makeup and hip hair fashion will still be of utmost importance. And for a tribe of regularly roughed-up, victims-of-underground-dwelling-cannibals, their outfits wouldn't be so clean-pressed. I think this film was mis-labeled from the low-budget Saturday afternoon movie on the WB that it is.

B0001I561E|5.0|I gotta say that this movie really ROCKS!!! I spent a whole just finshed watching the whole dvd today and it's more than cool man, it's a treasure to have. <br /> <br />Obviously, I have no regrets buying the dvd. The songs are great, the visual experience was wonderful condsidered that it's been 12 years since Disney have taken everything from it's dusty archives. The extras are wonderful, especially the virtual DVD tour, etc. Adults and kids will love 'em.  <br /> <br />However to me, there are a few minor drawbacks about the dvd. One of them was that they had Nick Lachey & Jessica Simpson singing \\"A Whole New World\\". Now, I don't mean to be pesky about those two.  <br /> <br />But I was conscerened at first for buying the DVD because I wasn't sure whether they might butchered a favorite song of mind / in this case everybody's most favourite song of all time.  <br /> <br />And lets face it everytime you see the words: \\"Nick and Jessica\\" on MTV channel, you'd literally say \\"Oh God\\" and switch the channel without a doubt. Fortunately they did a pretty decent job on it. But Clay Aiken's great in singing \\"Proud Of your Boy\\", a deleted song that was meant to be very impportant in telling the story. Personally, I think it's better you buy the DVD to see it yourself. But Clay Aiken sure knows how to sing............ <br /> <br />Another minor drawback was that there was nice interview session with all the cast and crew of the film. However, I was kinda dissapointed because Robin Williams (the Genie) wasn't included. I'd say if we can hear what he's gonna say about his character which is a really popular icon in animation, then the whole DVD would be DAMN NEAR PERFECT!!!!! <br />   <br />It's a no brainer that the movie is more than special. It's extrodinary. Tell you this, in my 19 YEARS OF LIFE. This is THE FIRST TIME I ever watch Aladdin. Before I only know him and everybody by TV and books. But watching the original movie that started everything was the BEST EVER. Heck it's even recommended if you got deppression. Trust me, you gotta experience to believe it.  <br /> <br />So, if you're still left out like me, go get it now. Let it shine together with all the other newly released / upcoming digitally restored Disney DVDs. You'd do yourself a BIG favor.
B00003CX9Q|2.0|This childish view of alien relations not only denounces science as the faith of mankind, but it makes the alien creature a martyr symbol, impervious to the inklings of failure that most men have to endure. Almost as bad as the NBC sit-com drama \\"ALF\\", which attempted to make fun of a furry stuffed rodent from some other planet. If you find this repulsive, then may I suggest that the alien was probably carrying some type of disease with him and the director makes it seem like its a great thing to have a dirty creature from the Planet zero in your house. All around boredom and yawn sequences are found throughout. Only see this for the special effects which are worn and outdated.
B00005JNEI|1.0|I was really amazed that pictures & factual situations could be spliced, re-recorded and twisted to show fake scenes complete with words? After watching the actual scenes on TV, I don't know why somebody doesn't sue this guy? Anyway, if U are a liberal or mindless, & want to blame Pres Bush for everything in the world that has gone wrong, this might be enjoyable for U? If U are truly interested in knowing facts & world events, best buy Farenheip 9/11 or watch some Fox News, they show all sides of every story. I was pretty sick after watching this so called Documentary.
6305535264|1.0|The 1970's saw a degradation of the sci-fi medium, with notable stinkers such as \\"Silent Running\\" (tree hugging hippies in outer space), \\"Logan's Run\\" (youth drug culture at its worst) and this canon fodder which merged the absurd with the contemptible. The plot, or more-so, the arrangment of Kirk Douglas in a ridiculous role, takes place on Sheba, a moon of Saturn where there is a really old horny guy (Douglas), over the top as ever and his young sex slave (Facett), who does numerous nude scenes. This is so painful to watch because there is absolutely no chemistry between the two. Add a lousy Kietal in the \\"mad scientist\\" role and this goes even further into the stink pit. The special effects are lousy as is the dialogue. Not for the intelligent.
B0002Y69NG|5.0|This set gives you everything. This set not only gives you all the movies, all the spin-offs, all the revisiteds, AND 3 bonus discs but it gives you something more--Understanding. With audio tracks on all three films from two different perspectives-1 track on each features a mostly critical view of the films from 3 cranky entertainment journalists with one foot in the grave, and 1 track on each features mostly praise from 3 esteemed philosophy scholars. But this is essential! These 3 critics embody the stalwart action-and-effects-hating-no-matter-what type of film critic that's out there now. And when you watch the video while hearing them tear it to shreds, you think-- do they even get it?  THEN you watch the video while listening to the philosophers mention stuff they see that you cant even comprehend and you think-- I don't get it.       That is so crucial because these films mean whatever you take from them. If you enjoy incredibly smooth gunfights and insane explosions, then you'll cherish this epic trilogy. And if you love the deep philosophical and religious symbolism unique to this saga alone, then you will cherish it just the same.        But even if youre somewhere in between, as most probably are then you are given the opportunity to hear both sides. This is a truly priceless centerpiece to anyone's DVD collection.
6305428220|1.0|This is one of the stupidest movies I have seen. First of all, the acting is so terrible that you think that there was no director. Imagine all these teens who suddenly save the world from some strange alien that is invading their high school. It follows the mold of current movies that are brainless, put in a few supposedly scary moments with loud music and they call it a horror film. It's pure junk and I don't see how anyone can say otherwise unless they were born after 1980.
B0000041Z6|5.0|Unlike many of the people who have weighed in on this set, I absolutely love these recordings.  Unlike most who review on this site, I have actually performed many of these works (my being a classical violist).  I know these symphonies like the back of my hand.  Solti's interpretation is masterful in every aspect, he in fact, is the only conductor who has ever made the Rondo-Finale of the symphony no. 5 make sense as a cohesive movement.  The CSO plays absolutely brilliantly, as always, so there is nothing to criticize there.  I just think that most who listen to these recordings have been caught up in the over-dramaticized versions recorded by Bernstein, not to say that his recordings don't also have merit.  To any one looking for a complete Mahler set, I recommend this one above any other.
B0000B1OFL|1.0|This film, directed by some hack who directed MTV videos is a complete waste of time. The small story to tell, which is obscurred by MTV style action sequences and product placements, is entirely absurd. The actors are terrible and it was very boring. I expected at least to be entertained by anyone wanting a decent film, get \\"Bullit\\" with McQueen because it was better than this.....
0425173895|5.0|I don't think anyone could have predicted the way this ended. I knocked myself on the head several times after realizing the truth. Christie is as michevious as they get. The plot is essentially about a man(Roger) who is murdered and Poirot(who came for a 'vacation') decides to try and solve it. Everyone in the town has a secret they are hiding- but one of them has the worst of all. <br /> <br /> <br />There should be no contreversy surronding it in my mind. I think it was cleverly thought out. <br /> <br /> BEST EVER AS OF NOW( I still have a few to read)

B000002UR7|4.0|I dont love it. i mean, its good, but its the radiohead album i like the least. And whats with that dude: \\"Radiohead is just a bunch of sounds put together in a computer\\". He's so stupid. <br />I know that alot of the tracks on Amnesiac and Kid A, is made with the help of a computer. And so what?! Their great!  <br /> <br />And he said: \\"RADIOHEAD is a bunch of......\\" What the F. on this one, The Bends and My Iron Lung EP, theres no computers. <br />On HTTT theres 30/70 made of computers. On OK COMP. its even less. If even anything. <br /> <br />Radiohead rocks! and that dude sucks!       <br />
B000063DGC|5.0|As an aspiring muscian, I was introduced to Randy Rhoads at age nine by my father(a accomplished musician).  The first Album with Randy Rhoads I ever got was Blizzard of Oz.  Tribute is a EXCELLENT album.  It merely reinterates how great Randy was.  Crazy Train is better than the original (a tall order to fill) and Suicide Solution (seemingly devoid of hidden satanic messages) includes one of the best live solos of all time.  True Randy fans will feel chills when they here Dee.  Truly a masterpiece.  Randy is always somewhat shorted when it comes to the respect he deserves, but this album stands as tribute to a master.
B000000OQF|4.0|This is such a classic album. If you're a rock fan and don't have this, then you're really missing out.<br /><br />GNR was never the same after this album. This was them at their peak - before Axl's ego got out of control and ruined the band.
B000002B1M|5.0|This is the best nas album ever.hands down no questions asked. From start to finish this is his best work and yes i have heard illmatic plenty of times.This album has it all from the message to suspect niggas.smoke some weed and listen to this album and you will see why nas is considerd one of the best to ever touch a mike. the message, street dreams, if i ruled the world, affirmative action, take it in blood, suspect niggas, nas is coming i mean how many sick songs are on this album. with out a doubt one of the top 5 albums ever released
B00009TB5G|5.0|Continuing on from the stunning beauty of the extended version of The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers is a paradigm of Epic Adventure. The same themes abound : love, hate, tolerance (between races), action, sorrow, fear. <br />For those who thought that Jackson could not top the final battle scene, I recommend the extra scenes. They not only add to the scope and danger of hand to hand combat but they also explain how the Orc Army was finally decimated. <br />An absolute must for any fan of Tolkien, SF&F fan, adventure movie or classic literature brought to life.
B0000009SI|4.0|its riddiculous to say that frank zappa is a bad musician! <br />you can say that you dont LIKE his music, but saying that he is an untalented musician is crazy! Hes an insane guitarist. he can drum really good, he can play the piano and tons of other stuff! and do not forget how fantastic a composer he is. <br /> <br />anyway. this album is really good. its fun, well played and very well composed.
0553573403|5.0|It's taken me a while to really sort out what I'd like to say about this book. I read it years ago on a friend's recommendation and it's really the kind of novel(series) that changes your perspective about the genre. I used to hate incredibly long sci-fi books that required you to remember names and politics,and god-forbid it branched out further than a 3 book volume. I never even intended to actually read the book, just say I enjoyed it and give it back. Then I picked it up and.....fell in love.....<br /><br />If you do not like to be completely sucked into another world and its characters, experience all the characters from an equal perspective, and possibly lose your mind waiting for the next sequal to come out, then do not read this book. Otherwise I don't have a single bad criticism for this book or series. I can't nitpick the writing, the plot, or even the logic applied to the characters. Everything is beautifully written. Martin also has that unique talent of making you go, \\"I hate that character he's evil.....\\" then by the next book you're saying, \\"Wow, I can understand where he's coming from.\\" People criticize this technique, but it's more true to real humanity than other any book I've ever read. Everyone has their own motives and while on first appearece judgements are made, you may later realize someone was merely misunderstood. If I could I would rate this book higher than 5 stars, it's not merely well written an a darn good time, it's a total experience.<br /><br />There are a number of people complaining about the dark nature of this novel, the sickening reality, the gratuitous sex, and the utter length of this novel. I have few things to say. If your basis on what makes a good novel is whether or not the author sugarcoats the true realities of life then please go read Young Adult fantasy, this book is not for you. Yes, the book is long and as such filled with lots of word type things(smacks head in disbelief).....again, go read a YA fantasy novel. And as for gratuitious sex? I can remember maybe a few sexual encounters in the book and none of them more graphic than others I've read in similar books. Martin doesn't pull any punches and if the fact that a stressful experience involoving a child bride, which is true to the genre and \\"period\\" of the book disturbs you, flip past and get over it. That one instance is actually uplifted by the fact that girl experiences a kind of love with her new husband. Get over it or once again! Go read YA sci-fi fantasy.<br /><br />Like I said before, if you want to feel like you're actually immersed in a story and history, then you won't be dissapointed. =)ous sex?

B00004XONN|4.0|This album is great! I dont listen to it because i think i'm cool, or special or anything, if i do it. I think its the idiots who says that you are pretending to be special if you listen to this, that are stupid. Why are they saying that? Because they think theyre cool and original enough to say: \\"I have enough self confidence to say that i dont like it. I have figured all of you out\\". There! Youve got the whole situation turned upside-down.
B000002A46|5.0|Probably the best Christmas album out there, Merry Christmas still appears on charts every Christmas season, even as it celebrates it tenth anniversary.  This album has a little of everything - warm vocals on \\"O Holy Night,\\" a festive spirit on \\"Santa Clause Is Coming To Town,\\" intimate balladry on \\"Miss You Most (At Christmas Time)\\" and celebratory tracks like \\"Joy To The World.\\"  Merry Christmas sounds like it came straight out of Gospel and it has.  The lead single and the Love, Actually theme \\"All I Want for Christmas\\" has so much Christmas glee in it, one would think it was an old tune, yet it was written by none other than Mariah.  Grab a copy!
0312305060|5.0|A little masterpiece, clever and bright as it is heartbreaking. A friend read it thrice in a day. Once in a lifetime is enough for me. I'm interested in seeing the film now. If this is the future of fiction, it will be a very nice place. Not a word or notion wasted. Thanks, Michael Cunningham.
B00004Y7SF|4.0|My Kind Of Christmas was released amidst Christina's transformation from friendly Mousekateer to Stripped diva and it shows.  Her confidence has drastically risen and her vocals are unashamed, sometimes to the point of unnecessary warbling.  Considering it was released right after her debut, it makes this a strong record with marvelous contemporary Christmas songs.  Tracks like \\"Christmas Time\\" and \\"These Are the Special Times\\" makes it all worthwhile.
B00067BBQE|2.0|First of all, it's only 1 DVD discs, not 2. I don't know why Amazon lists it as being 2 discs.<br /><br />The editing and production on this DVD is quite bad and amateurish. The concert has a lot of fast cuts such that you can't even see Amy Lee singing that much. The sound is just so so, and lacks the impact and feel that the album does. Amy Lee sings powerfully and wonderfully, but it frankly sounds weird and lacking in the mix on this DVD.<br /><br />The included music videos are a good added bonus but the extra 'behind the scenes' material is practically worthleses unless you like seeing the band members acting really childish and stupid. Think spitting and throwing sodas at each other, etc. There is no  creative substance in the bonus material whatesoever and it reflects quite poorly on the band. They all come across seeming really shallow, empty and childish which I found odd because the music is so much better than that.<br /><br />The only reason I'm giving this 2 stars instead of 1 star is because I like Evanscence and this is the only concert DVD out. But you will probably dissapointed in this DVD.
B0000E1WKE|4.0|Whitney's vocals cannot be denied and this record indicated that.  Her presentation on some of the tracks is lackluster, like on \\"Joy to the World\\" and \\"Chestnuts Roasting on an Open Fire.\\"  But she still manages to deliver s tangible holiday albums everyone can enjoy, even when not in her heyday.
B0000DZEE3|5.0|This DVD is simpliy one of few things I can claim as money well spent. The Dolby 5.1 and DTS sound is amazing, and the camera work is fabulous. But besides all that, you get to see one of the top performances from one of the most talented groups on the planet. If you like this DVD , you will also like U2 Live from Castle Slane.
B0000E1ALR|5.0|As a devoted fan of early Springsteen, I picked up this album last year after I read the list of songs on the first CD.  I bought Greatest Hits years ago, and thought that it was lacking some of the best material.  This CD includes a great, broad sampling of some of his best material, but due to its broad sampling, misses some of the best.  I have listened to the third CD, and thought most of the songs were great (particularly \\"None but the Brave\\", and \\"Trapped\\"), but I agree that \\"Viva Las Vegas\\" was unnecessary.<br /><br />I wanted to respond to the ridiculous post that Bruce somehow \\"hurt America's soldiers' chances of survival in wartime by dissuading their self-confidence in victory over the enemy\\" and all that nonsense.<br /><br />First off, I served in Iraq earlier this year, and took along this album.  I listened to it several times while I was there and I have to say that it improved my morale immensely, particularly songs like \\"The Promised Land\\" and \\"Land of Hope and Dreams.\\"  Make of that what you will...
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|I agree most with Kasky's review above.  <br /> <br />I would give this 5 stars for the cause alone. The proceeds go to Band Aid to continue fighting for life and economic justice and this fight still continues worldwide today. Anything you spend on this DVD considering the proceeds goes to Band Aid is well worth it. Give it up. Buy 2 NEW copies and give one to a friend for Christmas. DO NOT buy it used or sell it back.  <br /> <br />This is a great collectors item for anyone that loves Rock and Roll and anyone interesting in becoming a rock historian (or even for someone who just thinks they are). However, I also agree with some of the other reviews in that some performances are rather poor. In my opinion Clapton and Jagger - 2 of my favorite artists - come to mind as poor performances and that IS WHY LED ZEPPELIN opted out (because they know they sucked after Bonham died). I remembered this from watching it the first time when it aired live but bought it anyway. Many other artists performances simply can not be found or were not recorded as the information in the booklet will tell you and another reviewer mentioned. It's a miracle that MTV found their incomplete 'B' edition of the tape. There are also several other artists I could care less about. Phil Collins and Madonna come to mind. In fact I'm only interested in about 10% of the artists on this DVD and about half of those performances sucked.  <br /> <br />BUT THEN AGAIN...It's 10 hours of Music, plus extra never before seen performances, BBC documentary, newscasts, the Christmastime, We are the World, and Dancing in the Streets video (Jagger/Bowie). And it was whipped together on short notice. What do you expect!!!  Did you really think you would have 10 hours of great music for only $28?  <br /> <br />Great Performances for Live Aid DVD that stand out for me... <br />1. Queen (and I am not a Queen fan at all...at least not until I saw this).  <br />2. U2 (great early performance...reminds me why I liked themback then and can't stand them now).  <br />3. Bowie <br />4. Pretenders  <br />5. B.B. King (on the extras menu) <br />6. INXS (on the extras menu) <br /> <br />The 60 minute BBC documentary at the end is worth owning as well.  <br /> <br />Ok. now that's over 2 hours of worthwhile music that I purchased at Target for $28.  Oh and did I mention the money goes to a great cause.  Again, DO NOT BUY THIS USED! Instead, buy 2 copies NEW and give one to a friend for Christmas.
B00004WG2F|2.0|Maybe Brad Pitt can't help but look so gosh darn cute. And maybe Anthony Hopkins can't help but pull off a rather excellent portrayal of the 'Bonanza - Ben Cartright' pioneer dad. Maybe beautiful Julia Ormond has talent, but as the old joke goes, it certainly isn't acting in front of a camera. Maybe the book this sprawling western is based on is better than the movie. Maybe it skipped over plot transformations like a stone skipping across a pond. Maybe if I had never seen Elvis Presly in \\"Love Me Tender\\", this would seem original. Maybe a shoot-out over a small time bootleg whiskey industry is not the climax I had in mind. Maybe this should have been a CBS Sunday Night Movie, and I would have known to avoid it. Maybe there is no explanation as to why it's called \\"Legends of The Fall\\". Maybe I was expecting the OK Coral. Maybe if it had continued much longer Brad Pitt's character would have travelled to the moon ( he had already covered the globe.). Maybe if I had known there was a killer grizzly bear segment coming, I wouldn't have watched at all.
B00068C7WA|5.0|If, like me, you already own Billy Joel's Greatest Hits 1,2 and 3, you don't really NEED this album, even though you might WANT it anyway.<br /><br />If you just want to have a collection of his best songs in one compact package for the car or office, this is perfect for you.<br /><br />It's got all the songs you sang and danced to over the years, including \\"Just The Way You Are\\"; \\"Honesty\\"; \\"My Life\\"; \\"Uptown Girl\\"; \\"An Innocent Man\\"; and \\"Movin' Out\\" et al.<br /><br />An excellent \\"Beginner's Guide to Billy\\" for someone on your gift list.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, December 14, 2004
0399208534|5.0|This is a wonderful and fun book for young children (toddler through preschool age). It can be used to help them learn the days of the week, counting, and color identification.  It can also be used to suppliment a science lesson on the life cycle of the caterpillar/butterfly.  I have read and used this book countless times with my own children, and they can't seem to get enough of it.  They love the holes and the small pages throughout the story; those aspects of the book allow the story to be interactive with youngsters as it's being read.  I think that the illustrations are magnificent.  Eric Carle's use of bold colors and his technique in which the pictures are drawn, are what really make this book captivating.  Each time I would read this story to my children, they would notice something different, that might have been overlooked the previous time, and they would just be in awe!  As for the style of the literature, it is written very simple.  It has short sentences, and uses a lot of repetition, which also allows young children to \\"read\\" along with you because they know what will be said.
0553212419|5.0|I always admired Sherlock Holmes as a great detective, but never actually took to reading the actual stories. I must say this is a great book, though it starts off a bit slow with the way-too-drawn-out Sign of Four and Study in Scarlet, it picks up with the well done short storys like The Engineer's Thumb, The Red-Headed League, The Speckled Band, The Yellow Face and oh-so-many more. This is deffenately one to pick up, it's a thick book, too, at 1059 pages,
B0002OERI0|3.0|I've barely heard this album beyond the title track, i'm just commenting on this as a concept album.  Now i'm sure many punk fans probably hate this CD because of some of the long song lengths, and their attention spans can't last beyond a 3 minute song, maybe 4 if a band wants to be adventurous.  Considering this is a concept album, I'm believing this may be a return to the wonderful pretentsiousness of the 70s, when rock music was pushed to the limit and then some.  After finding out that they actually have a 9 minute song on here, my hopes are up for what may come next.  I'm not much of a punk fan, and I think that the lyrics will sound dated and silly in a few years, but I like the return of bravery and ingenuity in the record business, and i'm hopeful for what may come in the future.  Just like punk was first created in opposition to progressive rock, this \\"punk\\" combats the watered down mindless tripe like Good Charlotte!  If you are into The Wall, and don't mind the rather limited emotional expression of punk nowadays, give this a spin with an open mind.
076790592X|5.0|First of all, if one has never watched a loved one die of a long term illness, they will probably not get very much out of this book. In fact, they may find it silly, sugary, and simplistic. The characters are not young, healthy, and vibrant, so I would suggest the younger crowd stay with those books who practice slick marketing. <br /> <br />However, if you have ever witnessed a person fade from disease and ultimately die. Or if you know of some one who is going through this now, then you might find comfort in this book. My father passed away from cancer 13 years ago, and I visited with him several times a week. Much of what I thought and felt could be reflected in the pages of this book. To witness a loved one die with dignity teaches you how to accept death in your own life. Albom has shown his readers this, and with great sensitivity. <br /> <br />Some here have said this book is filled with platitudes and simplistic philisophical phrases. Well...perhaps. Yet when people are facing death their thoughts often turn towards these things, and there can be a wealth of knowledge in their words - if we only take the time to absorb and listen. <br /> <br />To those who have not yet experienced the death of a loved one in their lives, I am happy for them. It is a pain I would not wish on anyone. However, if you have experienced the loss, and pain associated with that loss, of a loved one then you may have some nice quiet time with Morrie and his \\"simple platitudes\\" that just might help you look at life a bit differently.  <br /> <br />Oh, and don't forget the tissues.
B00005JN4O|5.0|Finding Neverland is undoubtedly the best movie I've seen in the past year.  It may be the best movie I've seen ever.  Despite having been called heartless, I cried for one third of the movie, and walked out of the theater unashamed because it was worth it.  Afterward, I wanted to turn around and watch it again.
B00063EMJG|4.0|To Faulkner's Ghost:  I should have been clearer, my Denon HDCD player is also a DVD-A/DVD-V player.  Remember the CD is a HDCD, and the DVD is a DVD-V. <br /> <br />The DVD disc included here is just that: a DVD, or more specifically a DVD-V (V for video, the most common type of DVD). <br /> <br />Most DVD-A releases are actually hybrids, part DVD-A and part DVD-V.  Manufacturers use the DVD-V part to be able to include extras like interviews and music videos.  Also by duplicating the DVD-A musical programming in the DVD-V portion (as in the DVD-A of HARVEST), the disc can be bought and played by anybody with any DVD player (albeit at a lower resolution than true DVD-A).  The resolution breakdown for stereo playback is as follows for the different mediums: <br />CD: 16 bits x 44.1 khz <br />HDCD: 20 bits x 44.1 khz (if played in a HDCD player) <br />DVD-V: 24 bits x 96 khz  (this is what this DVD plays at)  <br />DVD-A: 24 bits x 192 khz   <br /> <br />With material as old as this, it probably won't make much audible difference, but I still got a better, punchier bass response with the HDCD (maybe because it is more compressed). <br /> <br />Another way to tell DVD-A from DVD-V playback:  If you are playing a true DVD-A track, during playback, the video output can only be still pictures, not moving action video.  As you probably know by now, when you play this DVD, you get the full motion video of the LPs playing, ergo, again no DVD-A. <br /> <br />To be fair, this DVD does not claim to be a DVD-A.  The opening video shot says that it is a \\"DVD Stereo\\" disc, which is their coy way of not saying that it is not a DVD-A, unlike other NY releases which are true DVD-A.
B00000FBRE|5.0|a cool album, standout tracks are After You My Friend, Hurry up, their cover of Agent Orange'd everything turns grey (great song) and the really cool, optimistic May 16 (you may have heard it on tony hawk 2)
B00005JM0B|1.0|I AM A BIG FAN OF BOTH TERMINATOR, AND TERMINATOR2, BUT THIS MOVIE IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF HOW NOT TO MAKE A SEQUAL. THE MOVIE HAS ALL THE ACTION AND SPECIAL EFFECTS MONEY CAN BUY BUT A WEAK STORY, BAD SCRIPT, AND EVEN ARNOLDS PRESENTS AS THE TERMINATOR CANT SAVE THIS MESS. THE ENDING OF THIS MOVIE TOTALLY CONTRADICTS TERMINATOR 2. THE MOVIE IGNORS THE HUMAN STORY AND FOCUSES ON THE SPECIAL EFFECTS WHICH AFTER A WHILE BECOME BORING. TERMINATOR 1, 2 NOT ONLY HAD GOOD SPECIAL EFFECTS AND A GOOD STORY, BUT YOU ACTUALLY CARED ABOUT THE CHARACTORS. SKIP THIS MESS OF A MOVIE AND WATCH THE FIRST 2 TERMINATOR MOVIES AND LETS HOPE THIS WILL BE THE END. <br />
B00030590I|5.0|I really had no expectations for the movie since I had only seen one trailer, and actually rented it on a whim. It's safe to say I was pleasantly surprised. This film can only be described as cinematic poetry. It is a brutally beautiful combination of an art film and a martial arts film, accomplished by using color and cinematography to complement action, choreagraphy, and dialogue. These elements are used masterfully as the film unfolds. The story itself is deceivingly simple because once you add the poetic visual elements, it becomes very gripping and powerful. <br /> <br />I wasn't going to post a review of this film until I read a review by someone (see below) who had things like this to say about the film: <br /> <br />     Myra Schjelderup \\"Ignolopi\\" (Salt Lake City, Utah, USA) <br /> <br />     \\"When you see a title like that, the first thoughts that <br />     come to your mind are probably 'Neat,' 'Interesting,'  <br />     'Action!' 'Fighting!' and 'I want to see that!' - probably <br />     not 'Boring.' But that, I'm afraid, is what it is.\\"     <br />  <br />     \\"The choreography was all right. The directing was fine.  <br />     But the movie was boring. It was really surprising - even <br />     my father, who simply loves all martial arts movies, said  <br />     it was flat out boring.\\" <br /> <br />What bothers me the most about these comments is the fact this person probably didn't make an effort to appreaciate the beauty of the film. If that person is looking for a \\"martial arts\\" movie with mindless action, no substance, and no creativity, they should keep watching their Steven Segal and Chuck Norris movies. I'm sure those won't be \\"boring\\".
B00067BBQE|4.0|First of all, I would like to say that I was really blown away by this DVD. . .Amy sounds awesome! I missed their concert when it was in town and now I really wish I hadn't. I have to admit that I was a little skeptical after hearing so many reviews about how Amy can't sing live and I'd seen her on awards shows and wasn't really impressed although the sound on award shows is never really good either. I had watched a few clips of her on Yahoo Launch that actually cracked me up they were so bad. But!!! I gave in and purchased this DVD last night and watched it immediately and was very impressed, not only with Amy's powerful voice. . but at how well the band seemed to get along. .I loved the behind the scenes footage. . especially with Seether. . .Shaun Morgan cracked me up in that dress. . the gags and jokes were hilarious! The only reason I didn't give this a 5 is because like some of the other reviewers the constant shifting of the camera did make me a little dizzy. .the surround sound kicks butt on my system though so even if you don't watch the whole thing it sounds awesome!
B00013VHI0|5.0|The album itself is awesome, another great from Anathema. If you want to get technical thins is the album where they started changing their style into the band that they are today. I think that they have gotten better with each album, but there is something that makes this album shine. If you buy this album make sure you buy the Digi version with the BONUS tracks. I bought this album without even realizing that the tracks were Pink Floyd covers. I was listening and was just floored at how amazing they sound. I always attributed Anathema as a modern day Pink Floyd and finally hearing them cover my favorite band was just amazing.
