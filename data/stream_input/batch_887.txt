B001HN697M|4.0|Ok, I'll admit it.... I'm a vampire lover from waaaay back.  I always hated it when Dracula got it in the end.... oh the angst of watching him die time and time again.  However, I also suffer from the \\"Rocky Syndrome\\".... I always pull for the underdog!      Was this movie necessary to make?  No, not really.  Been told and retold.  However, I'm pleased they did.  It's a rehashing of the old story of two kids from opposite sides of the tracks, she of the ruling class (vampire) and he of the down trodden, (lycan), who indulge in forbidden love, a definate no no. It's also a bit of \\"Braveheart\\".... \\"FREEEEEEDOOOOOM\\".  Woven into this illicit affair is the long overdue upraising and rebellion of the oppressed Lycans from their masters the Death Dealers.    I couldn't help but root for Lucien, aptly played by Michael Sheen, and his brothers in their bid for freedom.  Sheen portrays emotion very well and actually looks kinda hot as the long haired and scraggly Lucien.  Who'd have thunk it, as he usually looks dweebie in everything else I've ever seen him in.      Bill Nighy is superb as the steely eyed, hard hearted Viktor, who won't allow even his own daughter to interrupt his iron fisted will in governing of the coven.  He doesn't even seem to be phased in the least when he sentences her to death for her indiscretions with a mongrel.  Way to rule Dad!!!    If you are an Underworld fan, check this one out. I think you'll enjoy it.  The reason for only (\\"4\\") stars is that the movie is a bit dark in some places, not theme wise, but visually.  Also some of the fight scenes were a little bit too frenetic.  It was a little hard to keep track of who was who.     ~ jade ~
0439023483|5.0|A short and sweet read, and even though it's technically a young adult, PG-13 type of rating, it still wrestles with very adult themes and brutality.  Perfect read for airports, Doctor Appointments, or waiting in long lines.
B000JJSJR8|5.0|I have to say this is a film that has gotten better with age!!! I think whether you own it  on Blu-ray or HD DVD you be very impressed with film transfer in 1080p and the sound very superior to the standard DVD version.

1416550542|5.0|This novel maintains its plot and suspense around the lack of communication within families.  I loved the setting in the English countryside, in Cornwall, and you feel like you live there in that time when  aristocracy and class still ruled the world, as well as the life of common people, in England at the turn of the last century, and in Australia too.  This novel though is not about life in Australia, most of the book is set in England.  It is beautifully pictured and very believable, and the protagonists live there and observe life there as people from Australia, so it feels totally authentic.<br /><br />So while you can go along for the ride, the believability of the plot lies in whether you can swallow that a girl totally loved and loving towards her family just rejects everyone she knew for the rest of her life when she finds out she was adopted at 21 yrs old.
B0018O4YSQ|4.0|The film:<br /><br />Dark City is one of the standout science fiction movies of the 1990s, along with Gattaca, The Matrix, Total Recall, and Starship Troopers. It portrays a bizarre world in which humans live in an eternal night and are manipulated by a group of strange creatures known as the Strangers.<br /><br />The sense of claustrophobia and dread are well developed, and the setting, which uses evocative period details, especially art deco and 50's modern styles, is eerie and cool. Definitely watch the Director's Cut - there is really no reason to watch the theatrical cut, which shortens a few scenes and adds a terrible voice over the spoils the mystery at the very beginning of the film. This is a film that rewards multiple viewings, and the DC is the way to go to get the most out of it.<br /><br />I will say that I found one moment at the conclusion kind of annoying and pat. Basically, it was a line of dialogue in which Sewell's character avers that the essence of humanity is in some sort of soul, whilst pointing to his heart. Blargh. How cheesy. But overall, the momentum of the story, the creepiness, and the unsettling plays on identity and memory work very well.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray:<br /><br />Detail is middling for a Blu-Ray. Certainly, it is superior to the awful original DVD. But digital noise reduction has scrubbed away some detail, especially in faces. Rufus Sewell and Jennifer Connelly's faces in particular have a waxy look that is noticeable. There is no film grain whatsoever, which is a bad thing, since the computer programs that reduce grain tend to scrub away those fine details mentioned above. It's not the sort of transfer that's going to beat you over the head by \\"looking HD.\\" Brightly lit scenes fare much better in terms of detail, which is part of the issue in a film called \\"Dark City.\\" There are several scenes which are very strong, showing good detail in cloth, or textures of walls, streets, etc. If you let it work on you for 2 hours, there are pleasing things to be found, and to be sure, it's not awful. It's just not as good as it could have been.<br /><br />Production documentaries total about 1 hour 20 minutes, and there are 3 commentaries on the Director's Cut, two commentaries on the theatrical.

The concept is wonderfull, which is that music is world wide and music can create a peacefull change. music is a world language that is everywhere and gives people hope in times of trouble. this cd brings artists from over the world together, known and unknown artists and brings a smile to my face everytime i listen to it. enjoy!! one love!
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|The film:<br /><br />OK, let's get the problems out of the way first: The Joker's plot is ridiculously convoluted. It's about 20 minutes too long (cutting the Hong Kong subplot would have tightened the film considerably). Harvey Dent's transformation is a bit pat, difficult to believe such a diametrical change in personality so quickly. The cell phone deus ex machina at the end is a little tough to believe.<br /><br />That's about it for the problems. Here's what works:<br /><br />-The setting. Nolan uses even more beautiful Chicago locations than in the first film, making for both a Chicago lover's dream movie (second only to Blues Brothers) but also rooting this film with a sense of reality that makes the tension and fear ramp up all the more.<br /><br />-The acting. Every player invests their character with a seriousness and an internal life that makes the movie sing as a thriller. Particularly good are Eckhart, Ledger, and Gyllenhall. Ledger in particular pulls off the impossible - besting Jack Nicholson's Joker with a truly chilling, psychotic vision.<br /><br />-The action sequences retain a believability but also deliver in terms of size, thrills, amazingness. The chases are all thrilling, and some of the large set pieces (flipping the truck, hang gliding in Hong Kong) are truly great.<br /><br />So it is the greatest comic book film? I would submit that it is. The other true greats, Superman(1978), Batman(1989), X-Men, and Spider-Man, all fall short in one of the above aspects. \\"Superman\\" is hampered by a somewhat silly climax. \\"Batman\\" is a bit too long, and the world teeters on the brink of not feeling real. \\"X-Men\\" also suffers on the realism side. \\"Spider-Man\\" is close, but some of the acting is not up to snuff. \\"The Dark Knight\\" really delivers in spades on all of these levels. Like the first Nolan film, it works as a movie, without requiring a love for the character. It works as a thriller - I recall my palms sweating in the theater. It's just excellently made, despite a few story logic issues (say, how did they sneak all those explosives onto those boats?).<br /><br />The Blu-Ray:<br /><br />This is a reference quality disc. It switches between 16:9 and 2.35:1, replicating the aspect rations of everything shot for the film - some sequences were shot in the wider aspect ratio for IMAX presentation (note: an IMAX frame is actually \\"taller\\" than 16:9, almost 4:3, but Nolan and the DP say that they composed the shots to be shorter than that, since information that the very top and bottom of frame are hard to see anyway in an IMAX theater, and usually are out of focus anyway). These sequences are really awe-inspiring in terms of the detail and scope they provide. Nonetheless, both ratios display lots of detail. Cloth textures, facial pores, fine hairs, and a very light film grain are all visible. Black levels, important in a film like this, are rock solid and very deep, but still allow lots of shadow detail. I will say, there were one or two instances of jagged edges on high contrast lines (I believe I noticed it in the \\"new batcave\\"). But it wasn't pervasive, probably 10 seconds worth of artifacts in 2:30.<br /><br />Be sure to calibrate your display for watching this! (I recommend Digital Video Essentials, but the Lucasfilm THX calibrator found on Star Wars and Indy DVDs works in a pinch). Audio is very strong, with a TrueHD 5.1 channel mix that delivers both big noise as well as subtle dialogue. To put it simply, this is in the top 5 Blu-Ray discs yet released.<br /><br />Extras are also very strong. Although there is not an audio commentary, there are an hour of \\"focus points\\" which can be accessed during the film or as a complete documentary. The second disc contains 2 extensive HD documentaries, some fake Gotham news clips which were edited way down for the film, and a large picture gallery. All in all, you're looking at about 3 full hours of extra content. A \\"digital copy\\" disc for your laptop or iPod rounds out the set.<br /><br />***********<br /><br />If you're a fan of action, you should get this. If you love comics, you should get it. If you love top notch HD, you should get this.<br /><br />It really is a must-own for any Blu-Ray collection. The only reason not to get it is if you can't stand visceral, in your face thrillers with a lot of violence and tension. This may not be a film for a 5 year old. But anyone age 13 to 130 should find something to appreciate in it.If you love comics, you should get it. If you love top notch HD, you should get this.

B001V9LRTM|5.0|I was at the 1969 Woodstock festival and avoided the film version suspecting it would not come close to recreating, or coming up to, the real experience.  Still, I viewed the original film premierimg in 1970 just to see if I could spot myself among the masses (I couldn't - and viewing it in a theater didn't come close to being there).  After revisiting the original concert site outside Bethel, NY in 2004, I viewed the DVD version.  This second viewing was nice but still not as good as being there.  In APR09 Roger Ebert and Michael Wadleigh came to my hometown and screened a 70 mm surround sound print with 45 minutes of unseen additional footage; supposedly this print is the same being offered here on Blu-Ray DVD.  I was at this showing,too, and was almost bouncing/boogying in the aisles (Alvin Lee, Ten Years After, The Who, Santana, and others) because this print and sound system were superb.  It was the closest thing to being there and was a thouroughly exhilirating experience.  The surround sound is crisp and clear and expertly synched with the performers. Overall a wonderful experience and a film version that I can say is the closet thing to being there that I've ever experienced - it sparked a lot of memories, I could almost smell the rain and mud.  Although I'm reviewing the movie and not the DVD - I expect this is what will be on the BR-DVD.  The Blu Ray technogy will not lose much in making the transfer.  I am buying this DVD expecting everything I've said about the movie will be true of the BR-DVD.  If I find otherwise I'll create a new post.

B0009GV9LO|5.0|THAR BE SPOILERS BELOW.... if you don't know the story of Tosca and don't want plot information, don't keep reading.      I saw this production back in 1985 on PBS and have never forgotten it. Personally for me, it is the best Tosca I've EVER seen. I recently found it on DVD and bought it straight-away. I really don't have enough adjectives for it, but I will try to describe why it's so fabulous.    This is such a wonderful production because all the singers can sing AND act. After all, Puccini's Tosca was based on a play by Sardou for one of the greatest actresses of his day, Sarah Bernhardt. So what is a Tosca without a singer that can act? It's horribly pathetic, I know, I've seen one (more than one, but I won't go bashing here.)    In THIS Tosca, the lead role sung by Éva Marton is to die for (pun intended.) She sings with abundant abandon and also manages to make you believe her EVERY move. They are all motivated by something in her character. You never watch her & think \\"that's artifice\\" because it never is. Her \\"Vissi d'arte\\" is moving, believable and just a sacred moment in time- a real jewel (nice camera work by Brian Large.) It is also obvious she understands this character of contrasts. Passionate, jealous, pious but dangerous with a knife. :)  She makes you believe in a heroine that can be shy about kissing in front of the \\"Madonna\\" in church but fight like a tigress for the man she loves when faced with evil.    Which brings me to the next great acting singer- Ingvar Wixell. While some may find his voice small or dry- I have always liked the quality of his voice. It has a kind of rustic and sensuous quality. But probably best of all is his acting - and I'm not downplaying his voice. He is a singer of formidable qualities (and you may recognize him from the Pavarotti DVD of Rigoletto- more fine acting/singing) but his acting is just so freakin' fabulous that I don't know what else to say. His Scarpia is evil but his Scarpia is human too. By not making him one dimensional, he makes you think about human motivations and machinations. Just one example of the little touches he does that are so genuine:   In Act II after he gets Tosca's agreement of sex in exchange for her lover's life, he grabs her from behind, hungrily kisses her neck, then gives her just a little push-off when he walks away. His Scarpia is always in control. He may want her, but she is disposable and this little movement shows that. Every moment and look and action of Wixell's are right on the money and so in character you forget you're watching an opera - perhaps the highest compliment of all to some!    Our hero, Cavaradossi is sung by Giacomo Aragall. He may not be in the same league with Marton & Wixell when it comes to acting, but he does a good job and doesn't detract in anyway. His singing is selfless and heroic throughout. There are a few moments where he sounds short on breath, but over all this is good Aragall in his prime.     And let's not forget the venue. If there was a devil, I would probably sell my soul to go see a great production like this one at the Arena di Verona in Italy. Because it's in an outdoor arena, the production is HUGE. The sets are huge- they use real sheep in Act III (and yes, even the sheep get applause in Italy! and apparently the tenor does too every time he hits a high C by himself, they stop to applaud, but this only happens twice- I found it endearing.)  The sets, the detail, the costumes, the grandeur of it all is what has kept opera alive all these many hundreds of years. I like a nice quiet and intimate theater experience too, but this is the overwhelming expansiveness that makes for converts!    The orchestra performs well under Daniel Oren. That Act I scene \\"Va, Tosca!\\" is tough to keep together (the lack of cannon sound effect make disappoint some, but this scene was loud enough!) The orchestra pumps out a lot of sound, yet the singers never sound drowned out. (When they turn upstage the voices get a bitlost, but the singers seem conscientious of this.) The sound quality on this DVD is very good and the camera work by Brian Large is some of his best. In the 3rd Act when Tosca & Cavaradossi are singing their love duet, he shoots from an angle that allows you to see them both and the huge statue towering over them against the backdrop of the night sky. The whole evening was really quite magical. The camera shows us the grandness of scale, but also allows us to see the singers' finer moments up close and personal.     I cannot recommend this DVD highly enough. There is a great story, great music, great singing, great acting and MAGIC!!! :)

B001S6Y0AQ|5.0|\\"Time Out -50th Anniversary Legacy Edition\\"<br />(Sony-BMG Legacy, 2009)<br />------------------------------------------------<br />Dave Brubeck's landmark 1959 album, \\"Time Out,\\" is perhaps the defining record of the so-called West Coast jazz sound, a playful, dynamic set that concentrates on melody and formal composition over muscularity and improv, and (for many) a welcome step back from the aggressive hurly-burly of the more macho bebop and post-bop scenes. Even though it was an experimental concept album -- toying with unusual time signatures -- it's a comfortable, comforting record, best remembered for the hit song \\"Take Five,\\" but also packed with other melodic delights such as \\"Three To Get Ready\\" and \\"Blue Rondo A La Turk,\\" all of which show the brilliant interplay of Brubeck and saxophonist-composer Paul Desmond, bassist Eugene Wright and drummer Joe Morello.<br /><br />Over the years, I've gathered many copies of this delightful album. I accidentally acquired three copies on vinyl (it's so pretty!) and likewise, bought two copies on CD before I knew what had happened. And now comes this 3-disc Legacy edition, which includes the original album along with a second disc of lively performances from the 1961-64 Newport Jazz festivals (familiar songs given added live oompf) and a third disc that has the music on DVD, along with a modest but illuminating documentary in which Brubeck reminisces about the making of the \\"Take Five\\" album and its impact on his career.<br /><br />In the short film, which was shot in 2003, Brubeck takes goodnatured pot-shots at the late Paul Desmond (with whom he frequently bickered about musical ideas) and recalls the chilly reception that the record met with at Columbia Records: the company's president, Goddard Lieberson, was its sole champion, and \\"Take Five\\" wasn't even released as a single until after jazz DJs made it popular on their shows(!) Brubeck also discusses the inspirations he found for various songs, from nature and from other cultures (as in the case of \\"Blue Rondo A La Turk\\") and even sits down at the piano to show that age 83, he's still got serious chops.  He's a charming old fellow, full of humor and life, and this set is a nice expansion of the legacy he, and this album, have left for the world.

B00192KCQ0|4.0|I had kind of lost interest in Metallica after the whole St. Anger thing, and when I first heard \\"A Day That Never Comes\\" I thought ok does sound like old Metallica again but pretty boring, so I didn't bother buying the album.  But last week a friend gave me the whole CD and I must say this is a great album, I have been listening to it non-stop for the past week.<br /><br />As far as the sound quality it's not that bad, I mean get over yourself people.  I happen to be a bass player and the first thing that jumps out at me is that finally Metallica has a bass player (again).  Newstead in my opinion was always very uninspiring.  On ...And Justice For All there is no bass guitar period, seriously that album is a joke and what a shame since the songs are awesome but sounds like a demo tape.  Then on Black Album and Load/Reload either the bass sounds like an annoying low rumble that overloads your speakers, or, when you can actually hear the notes he is playing, his tone is muddy and overall he was always extremely dull and a total non-factor in Metallica's music, almost like he was never even a full member of the band.<br /><br />On Death Magnetic you can really hear Trujillo, he has a nice, thick tone that blends really well with the music.  Plus the songwriting is very good so overall this is a great album, its refreshing to know that Metallica is once again a true 4-piece unit with a real bass player.  I give it 4 stars only because I'm not crazy about \\"A Day That Never Comes\\" and the instrumental track is cool but a bit long.  The rest is top notch.

The search for something of value that proves illusory was done in \\"The Maltese Falcon\\". Assembling a team for a crime was done in \\"The Asphalt Jungle\\". They spent too much money on car chases and not enough on a good story for this exercise in futility.
B00008CLNQ|4.0|As others have noted, this collection is a mixture with symphonies 1, 2, and 3 coming from a digitally recorded cycle from the late 1980's and symphony 4 from a  cycle recorded in the late 1970's. DG initially re-issued about 20 von Karajan digital recordings in the Karajan Gold series with \\"Original Image Bit Processing\\" which supposedly added presence and depth to the recordings. Many reviewers have commented on the perceived improvement in the sound. None of the 1980's Brahms cycle was included in that release. OIBP was extended to non-digital recordings including all of the DG recordings in Universals \\"Originals\\" series and a number of 2-disc releases including the four Brahms symphonies conducted by von Karajan in the late 1970's (see [[ASIN:B000007ODY Brahms: The Complete Symphonies / Karajan, Berlin PO]]). Brahms symphonies 1,2, and 3 from the early 1960's received OIBP treatment, but still none of the 1980's cycle. Later DG released a collection of 2 disc sets of von Karajan recordings, including this set. It appeared to me that the premise of the collection was non-digital recordings digitally remastered at 96 kHz/24-bit. Symphony 4 retains the OIBP from the set cited earlier, but there appears to be no remastering of the three digital recordings. As far as I have seen, this is the only set in the series not remastered at 96 kHz/24-bit.<br /><br />Regarding the interpretaions, I have little to say. Karjan's Brahms is very adequate, but I have never found it inspiring. I became acquainted with the Brahms symphonies through Bruno Walter's stereo recordings, but over the years his NY Philharmonic mono recording of #2 (see [[ASIN:B00008S827 Bruno Walter Conducts Brahms: The Four Symphonies]]), racing through the final movement, has become special to me. It was a stereo recording by Klemperer of #3 (see [[ASIN:B0001O3Y8A EMI Great Recordings of Century - Brahms: Symphonies Nos. 1-4/Klemperer]]) that first grabbed my attention at the very end. Bringing off the endings to these symphonies, as with many great symphonies, presents a challenge to the conductor. None of the von Karajan recordings of Brahms symphonies have struck me as outstanding, but all are fine recordings nonetheless.
B001H9MYPW|5.0|In Treatment's second season continues in the \\"does programming get better than this?\\" fashion we became accustomed to in Season One.  The first episode has us meet up again with Dr. Paul Weston who is newly divorced in his Brooklyn apartment/office but this time around he is faced with a malpractice lawsuit from a former patient's father. We are also introduced to new patients, a female laywer whom Paul had treated 20 years prior, a college student with cancer, a preteen boy whose parent's recently divorced and a very highly ranked executive. Paul continues as a patient himself with his former therapist and mentor, Gina.  The acting is intense and Gabriel Bryne can do more with an eyebrow or a flare of one nostril than most people can do with their entire bodies and vocal chords.    If you like intelligent shows with a great deal of realism, you must watch this. I hope we see at least one more season of this remarkable show.

It is just as good as most other sci-fi action movies, with better and fresher concepts, as well as some special effects, as many other films of this genre.    Like Pitch Black, this sleeper movie will definately please those action/adventure junkies out there that don't even have a clue about this fun and exciting film.    There are some big name actors here, and they do a decent enough job, but it is the alien monster and the pacing and look of the film that wins the day. Actor Jim Caviezel should stick with these types of movies.     When you mix sci-fi space men and alien monsters crash landing on earth during the Viking age, you can't help but sit up and pay attention.    A must see film for those who love fun and exciting popcorn movies.
0756405890|1.0|So I was looking for a new book to buy and reading glowing reviews for this one, here at Amazon. After reading about 15 or 20 of them I started to have the sneaky suspicion that perhaps I had actually read this book already? Indeed, I looked and there it was on my bookshelf! Bought it about a year and a half ago, read soon after, and apparently completely forgotten until recently.     See my point? It's completely forgetable. Even when I picked it up and started reading again, I started to remember how much I disliked this when I read it. Sounds good but not something anyone is going to get all excited about.    Consider some of the features that have been talked about:     Characterization? Some people are impressed by the hero whose supposed to be anticliche while being the cliche of cliches a Mary Sue. One guy is in the future a hero. Then there are assorted \\"young\\" people who don't know what they want at all. Seen that before? The characters have no defining features and  for me seem to be the kind firstly that you don't know enough about and don't care enough about to want to continue and secondly that you can't tell anyone except Kvot apart from what other characters desire. Now, I can vividly remember lots of characters in other books that I have read over the years by e.g. Jordan, early Feist, and even early Eddings. None from here.     World building? It looked pretty stock standard, from what I saw. Kid going to magic school. Puppy love crush on girl. Evil returning. Kingdoms, castles, dragons, and menacing enemies hanging about. A compelling world tends to have at least some aspects which are not copies of other better books. Those aspects are also supposed to lead to logical consequences but in this it seems everything happens as happy coincidence. Think of some places invented by Jordan, Herbert and even Feist or Eddings. I can't see anything like that here. All right, one little original thing was that the dragons are herbavores but I think that's actually a running joke from Robert Asprin Myth books or such. Anyway this appears to have little consequence to the story anyway. We don't even get to see anything interesting happen.     Plotting? Don't even get me started. It meanders off on tangents for no reason more often than not. Every chapter or so something happens that's so out of character it pulls you out of the book. Enough said on that.     I wasn't going to review this but then I saw another 5-star shill review and felt I had to voice my opinion like I should before.
0812979656|2.0|As a PhD student of literature and a lover of Indian literature in particular, I was very excited to finally find time to peruse this novel. While I understand that this book is critically acclaimed, I was extremely disappointed and actually dropped the book at page 270. Simply put, what could have been a great story gets lost in the author's attempt at fancy poesy and artfulness. Roy is about as far from straight forward as one can get. I kept hoping that if I continued to read on, I would hit pay dirt, but it never happened. The story gets lost under a mound of fanciful junk. I have only put down a handful of books in my lifetime without finishing them, and when I have, it was because the attempt to finish became futile because the interest simply ceased to exist.<br />If you want to read a great book about Indian life, choose anything by Rohinton Mistry...you won't be disappointed. Thrity Umrigar and Padma Viswanathan are also noteworthy.
0375842209|4.0|\\"The Book Thief\\" is narrated by Death, who has the advantage over the other characters of being able to be everywhere at once.  He can also play with the action, like the guy in the movie \\"Click.\\"  This Death is not an anti-Semite, and has most of his sympathy for the good guys in the story, although being Death, you'd think he'd be neutral.  But wars create a lot of extra work, so he has mixed feelings about those, like Hitler, that start them.    (First note: The protagonist winds up living where the book jacket says the author does, which makes me worry that I am being harsh about a real-life based story.)      Death tells the story of the book thief, i.e. Liesel Meminger, a recently orphaned eleven-year-old, who is taken in by foster parents, when her own are persecuted for being Communists.  Her new family is earthy but have hearts of gold underneath, and show this by hiding a Jewish man in their basement for much of the book.     (Second side note: The author went to school in a very politically correct area and era, so she feels uncomfortable pointing out flaws in a book about the Holocaust.  The writing style can be awkward, and the action stalled about halfway through, focusing on less important characters.    Many of the characters have mixed (to say the least) feelings about the spread of Nazism and do their. best to help their Jewish neighbors.  Meanwhile Liesel collects books scavenged from book burnings and slowly comes to love reading and writing.    (Third side note - But she is going to post the review anyway because unlike Germans living under Nazi regime, Americans are allowed to voice their opinions, however unpopular.)    There are heroes in this book, but none are Mary Sues.   Victories come at a high price.  Despite the odd metaphors sprinkled throughout the story, I would recommend this book.    (Fourth side note: Although that also means that future reviewers are free to post their opinion by voting unhelpful because they consider the authorpolitically incorrect or plain wrong.  But that's life.)
B00005YU1O|5.0|As with the best of Linklater's work, the \\"plot\\" here takes a backseat to the real star of the show, the monologue. As such, we'll dispense with the plot. Notice that this is \\"monologue\\" not \\"dialogue\\". Even in scenes which would seem to portray two or more persons engaged in conversation, there isn't so much give and take as there is one person holding forth, then giving way to let the next fellow have a go. In this way, the director has basically built an all-terrain vehicle of soap-box soliloquy and handed the keys over to all manner of ranters and rhapsodists. So who needs plot?  On my most recent viewing of this favorite of mine, I realized that what was being portrayed was a view of the psychic landscape of humanity, much like Joyce famously portrayed the archetypal day of humanity, through a metaphor of The Dream. Pretentious? You bet. But don't let that deter you. Joyce didn't. Neither has Linklater. Recommended.
B0002Y69NG|5.0|I don't think there's anyone out there that hasn't seen the matrix trilogy but this collection is very good.  If you like the matrix there's plenty of extra stuff you will find interesting in the bonus dvd's.  Great purchase for my collection.
B001LRJH0K|3.0|Decent Western.  Even the good guys have flaws.  But in the end it's about a friendship and sacrafice.
0441009425|1.0|Just mind numbingly bad. Annoying, obnoxious, sociopathic characters. Atrocious writing style. Totally dystopic. Irritating and depressing to read.<br /><br />All the one star reviews are completely accurate.<br /><br />How did this junk get published?
B001SGEUNI|5.0|I wasn't sure if I wanted to go see this band. A friend of mine told me about them and we talked about them, he told me that I would like them. Well, I went to their in-store signing in Golden Valley, MN. I was hooked the first time Liz opened her mouth to sing. I bought a cd before it went on sale to be familiar with it before the show. Went to St. Paul, MN and bought a ticket for the show. Went to the show. This band deserves more than what they're getting! After the show on Saturday, I took the CD to a friend of mine who works at Sony BMG and played it for him. We went on you tube, he was hooked and we talked about WHAT ATLANTIC SHOULD DO WITH THIS BAND! This is the best Rock and Roll CD's that has come out in 2009. This band has got to go somewhere. I noticed that they are coming back to the area and you can bet that I will be there. This is what true rock fans have been asking for, it's young, fresh, sarcastic and just full of rock! If this band doesn't make a name for themselves, it was/is the record companies fault! I totally recommend this CD to anyone and everyone.
B002B4AAS0|4.0|I downloaded the album last night and only had time to listen to the first seven songs on my commute, so I'll complete this review later. However, if the first half of Hombre Lobo is any indication, my 4-star review will definitely stand.    The subtitle of the album, \\"12 Songs of Desire\\", is an apt description of the songs. This one is 100% about E's quest for love (or at least some action).  The lyrics are dripping with pain and longing, and the depth of desire ranges from innocent schoolboy crush to crazy stalker guy. At the end of each song you want to find out who he is talking about, call her and tell her to just get with him already!    The style of the album is probably closest to \\"Shootenanny\\", with half of the songs being tight, punchy rock songs like \\"Prizefighter\\", \\"Lilac Breeze\\", \\"Tremendous Dynamite\\" and \\"Fresh Blood\\", and the other half ballads like \\"That Look You Give That Guy\\", \\"In My Dreams\\" and \\"Longing\\". (I will have more to say about other songs after I listen to the rest!)    Hombre Lobo has the familiar sound of Eels, but also feels fresh and new. Longtime Eels fans will love it, and first-time listeners should find something to like in it, too.

B001RIY4WE|3.0|I seriously am considering lowering the rating right now, but ah what the hell.<br /><br />This is one of my favorite movies of all time, so I was excited about buying this release because it was great to finally have T2 on Blu-Ray. At HMV, I found two Blu-Ray editions- the original Blu-Ray release and this. With this having more extras and having a better transfers (according to source), I picked this one up.<br /><br />I popped in the disc, expecting it to be like what others had bitched about, and it worked perfectly. I have an LG BDP300. So anyways, after 30 seconds of a blank screen, I get this message saying that Skynet \\"does not recognize the network connection\\". I chose \\"cancel\\", knowing my Blu-Ray player does not connect to the internet. Then during the loading screen (which lasted for at least a minute), it said that there was no connection and that it would load with a full menu.<br /><br />It really pisses me off that they'd do this. All I ask is just for a proper release and not try to be all cool with this \\"skynet\\" stuff. I mean, if anything I bought it for the fact that it was the movie in Blu-Ray, and that'd be effing awesome.<br /><br />The menu, whilst looking cool, is slow, clunky, and almost not responsive. You'd select something, and then it would take 10 seconds to show. I thought it was just my player, but no, other reviewers are saying the same thing. The popup menu is no different.<br /><br />By the way, if anyone's wondering, yes I did figure out the password to watch the director's cut (another fail- WHY do we have to put in some stupid password just to watch the clearly superior cut of the film?). Those who are wondering, it's 82997.<br /><br />When you start playing either version of the movie, you get the Lionsgate splash screen which you can NOT skip, the DTS HD Audio screen, the THX screen, then the StudioCanal screen which you also cannot skip. This is annoying, I just wanna see the movie, mmmkay???<br /><br />The picture looks great, and was worth the purchase alone. This is probably the best transfer of T2 we'll ever get. The sound is explosive too- if there's such thing as an eargasm, then fast forward to the finale in the steel mill and you'll have one. It has to be heard. The director's cut is well restored here. Nothing has been tampered with, as well as they added in an extra set of credits showing credit for the Director's cut.<br /><br />The extras were fun too. I loved the in-movie experience, as well as all the games and gizmos, especially the Picture-in-Picture feature. Just excellent. There's lots of commentaries, including the one with 26 cast members- that one is fun, hilarious, and cool. But that said, why do I even need to connect the thing to the damn internet just to be able to access some special features?<br /><br />So if you want extras, and a good transfer, I guess buy this release. But wait until Lionsgate corrects this release, which hopefully they do. If it just so happens they do, I'll upgrade for sure, but right now, I'm scratching my head over this clunky and unorganized mess of a Blu-Ray release. I guess I'll keep it for now thought, because this is a movie I can watch again and again.best transfer of T2 we'll ever get.

B0001WTVUW|2.0|After many years of wanting to see this movie and the UK equivalent \\"Threads\\", I finally bit the bullet and ordered them on-line (I live in Australia and can't ever recall ever seeing these two movies aired on television here.).    I've done a lot reading about Nuclear War etc etc, and comparing both Threads and The Day After is like comparing a Duck Liver Truffle Pate' with Chicken Liver Cat Food.    Threads is hands down the more realistic and more frightening of these two films.  Threads gives the viewer a more realistic insight into radiation sickness (The Day After makes it seem like a bit of an inconvenience instead of a fatal illness), disease, end of society and law and order, and the Nuclear Winter.    In the Day After after the bombs go off, the sun is shining, radiation seems to  disappear to safe levels quite quickly and no Nuclear winter to even speak of, it's almost like the creators of the film wanted to make people walk out with a smile on their face.    Watch Threads, as you'll see post survivors eating rats and dead sheep (uncooked straight from the carcasse), Radiation Sickness of all magnitudes, newborn mutations/retardation, pretty much the end of everything... and still Threads is probably not that close to the real reality of what would eventuate.    Threads = More realistic, convincing, frightening, educational    The Day After = Hollywood fluff

B000AMJG4Y|4.0|A manga style film. The archetype is there. The world in ruins. A society reduced to some erratic mass movements of fear or violence. Some young people, men and women, identified as the children of a mythic father and mother are divided between the group of those who control the masses and this ruinous world, and on the other hand the group of those who are rebelling and claiming to conquer some kind of future. And that's where the archetype comes into play. This future is identified to going back to what the past splendor of this world was, to rebuilding the city that history has destroyed. It is systematically the nostalgic rebuilding of a past glory that used to be the realm of the parents, or maybe grand parents, ancestors for sure. But we are obliged to doubt all that nostalgic back tripping good intentional apocalypse. It is a myth to believe history can move back. It is a myth to believe the younger generation who has hardly known the past will want to go back to it. It is a myth to believe a world of advanced technology, cell phones among many others, will be able to regress to an ancient time when there could not be any of these brilliant inventions. It is a myth to believe these brilliant inventions could only be associated with ruins, chaos, apocalyptic events and results. No, cell phones and portable Internet-connected computers are not the lipstick and the make-up of Babylon, that lost woman dressed in blood red cloth that Saint John executes in his Book of Revelation, along with the Dragon and then the Beast.

0307341569|5.0|Gillian Flynn writes of creepy people in a completely believable, if demented, way.  In \\"Dark Places,\\" her heroine, Libby, has witnessed the murder of her mother and her sisters.  Libby grows up with all kinds of psychological problems--shoplifting, alcohol, lack of motivation.<br /><br />Contacted by a group following the history of certain famous murders (her family's among them), Libby at age 31 begins a search for the truth that takes her to many \\"dark places.\\"<br /><br />The book splits time and narrators in a convincing fashion and is almost impossible to stop reading.<br /><br />I love this author, and I loved this book though it was not quite as creepy as the first novel, \\"Sharp Objects\\"--it was still plenty bizarre in a good way.
0553582038|5.0|I thought this book was great.  First half is slower.  But of course, an author needs to set things up sometimes.  The payoff comes though.  The second half develops the plot of the series nicely.  The next book promises to be excellent as a result.  This series is a work of art.  The plot keeps maturing and improving.
B00002613K|5.0|This album has been a long-time favorite of mine.  It is the second Magnum album that I discovered, \\"On a Storyteller's Night\\" being the first (and my favorite).  Being from the U.S., I had never heard of them until I spent time in Germany as a high school exchange student in 1989.  Their sound was distinctly original and new to me, yet the melodies have a sense of familiarity.      I now have almost all of their albums, except for the most recent few.  While this album is more mainstream than many of their albums, the musicianship is nonetheless stellar.  These are great songs that are easy to listen too.      For those of you who are new to Magnum, this album is among their most commercial, radio-friendly albums.  It is simply great.  Many of their other albums have more artistic compositions.  If you were to take the 2 or 3 radio friendly songs from each of their other albums and put them on one cd, you would have something similar to this one.    In short, it's a great cd.  It's not my very favorite of theirs, but it is among the top 3 or 4 (and they have a lot of albums!).
B00026L7O0|5.0|This item was a great buy.  Although I haven't had a chance to watch it yet, the item was in great condition.  It was still wrapped in the original packaging and the disc had no scratches or marks.  It was also delivered in a timely manner.
B001KVZ6F2|1.0|When Clint Eastwood deals with Church, ethnicity, justice issues, and stars in his own show the results are always awful. This film is no exception. In this film's conclusion, with the Christ- cruciform pose, nothing registers,,it's kitsch.     Thank God for Independent cinema; when will this kind of pseudo -dramatic nonsense cease?
015603283X|3.0|Well crafted and engaging, except by revealing the mistery in the end, the premise somehow flickered and went dark for me. The author put a lot of effort into tying the story together, yet sometimes a little mistery could leave the readers aiking for revelation long after the book is over (recall The Trial by F. Kafka).<br /><br />The book revolves around a book dealer hired to investigate the authenticity of a book published in the 1600's whose publisher was executed by the Inquisition for devil worship. The investigation doesn't go according to plan as several people are murdered for their associations with the only remaing copies of the book.<br /><br />Alexander Dumas's novel The Three Musketeers takes center stage in the novel as the author uses it as a veil to the overal mistery (unsuccessfully in my opinion). In the final scene, the protagonist (who doesn't get paid for his services) discovers that the book contains a forgery that can help him get close to the evil he tried to aviod. If you enojoy these types of books, you may want to try \\"The Dante Club\\" or the works of E.A. Poe.
015206396X|5.0|THis book is full of fantastic characters and a great strong storyline.<br />I author has really pulled all the elements of this book together and weaved a breathtaking tail for Kasta and her friends.<br />I think one of my favorite parts of the book was Kasta finding so many great, nice people around her that helped her grasp her own humanity and control over her life, with a little help from the Graceling with the gold and silver eyes!

0312360266|4.0|I noticed some people comparing this series to Twilight but the only thing similar about the two is the vampire theme. Twilight was very serious, an intense love story, etc. whereas this book is just fun, lighthearted, a little romance but really captures a totally different kind of teenager. I think it is a great read strictly for pleasure. It doesn't make you think deeply about anything or get emotional really. I recommend it for after you read the Twilight series in fact so you can recover from such a serious story!    It's fun, I really enjoyed it.

B001PPLJIQ|5.0|This movie was a million times better than what i had expected. I bought it when it came out, and it was one of those movies you had to be in the mood to watch, or so i thought. so i finally put it in and was engrossed for entire 2 hours. only once did i press pause. it was so moving, and Kate Winslet was fantastic and well deserving of her oscar. In my opinion, this should have won Best Picture as well(i also have not yet seen slumdog though). I dont think this film is for just anyone though, people may find it offensive with the amount of nudity and graphic scenes with the affair. i'll definatly watch this again, and also may check out the book. 5 stars! no question!
159102594X|2.0|I read book one, and I have the other two waiting.  I sure hope that all that setting up everything for each and ever character in great and lengthy detail pays off down the road, but I am not holding out much hope.  This was a long drawn out set up for something that I fear is not going to happen.<br />I am reading book two and so far it seems much of the same as The Blade Itself.<br />Not really worth the time unless you are really in need of something to do to pass some time.

B001AVEJ1Y|3.0|I'm a big Star Trek fan as well as a fan of good science fiction in general.  Going into this movie, while I was encouraged by the trailers, I did so with a degree of trepidation because I really do love this franchise and I really didn't want this movie to suck like the last few have.      Much to my relief, it doesn't.  But, much to my disappointment, it's not actually great either.  It's decent, to be sure, but in terms of plotting, character interplay and sentimentality, it's a poor imitation of the original six films.  It's Star Trek lite.  It's Iron Man, as opposed to say, The Dark Knight.  Or, perhaps, Tom Cruise's original Mission Impossible film as opposed to the Mission Impossible TV Show.  It's creative, its flashy, and its splashy. But because it has sacrificed so much intelligence to attract a broader audience, it really doesn't deserve all the accolades it's getting.  Because lets face it, in several respects, it's actually glaringly deficient.      First and foremost is plotting.  The plotting really isn't very cerebral, certainly not as much as you'd expect from something under the Gene Roddenberry name.  Now, before you jump on me, let me clarify.  I'm not saying that I would have preferred long periods of dialog in which characters spoke in treknobabble for ten minutes.  I'm just saying, I would have liked it if the plot had made some semblence of sense.  And... frankly, it didn't.  For example, in a quick series of events, Kirk breaks regulation after regulation, including committing mutiny, and is relieved of command.  Then, all he has to do to get that command back is to make Spock wig out.  That just doesn't make any sense, and neither do many other elements of the plot, such as the convenient presence of both Spock and Scotty on the same iceteroid in the middle of nowhere.      One of the things I liked about the original series of films was that, even at their worst, they were intelligent, serious and sentimental.  The plot proceeded somewhatbelievably from A to B to C.  In contrast, this film is occasionally sentimental, vaguely intelligent and irritatingly unserious.  Most stressful is the crass new Kirk, who is far too sexually aggressive and immature to make me feel like he would make a good leader.  He completely lacks the legitimate charisma of the Shatner Kirk (There, I said it.  Shatner was a good actor, especially in the films) and his behavior is more reminiscent of an angsty teenager, which seems kind've inappropriatte considering these characters are all supposed to be military officers, and the cream of the crop, at that.  In the end, despite the better special effects, it's just not as realistic as the version Roddenberry pioneered.  Who is responsible for this new tone?  I don't know.  Perhaps I should assign blame to the MySpace generation's short attention span.  Or to the producers.  Or to Abrams.  I don't know.      Truthfully, I enjoyed this film.  It spins an interesting yarn, looks really good, and takes the familiar Star Trek universe in a ballsy new direction.  But as hard science fiction (and despite what anyone else tells you, Star Trek IS hard science fiction) this movie is mediocre/good.  Its fun to watch, but it's not Star Trek as I recognize it.

Although the author's habit of disparaging other branches of the service annoyed me, his deep love of his home Country and State was a sufficient offset. This is an emotional piece of work that clearly reflects the painful memories of the author but still manages to impart enough facts and details to make an interesting read.

0920668372|5.0|This is a beautiful and unusual story about a mother's unconditional love for her child throughout his life.  It begins with her holding her new baby and singing a lullaby:<br /><br />  I'll love you forever<br />  I'll like you for always<br />  As long as I'm living<br />  My baby you'll be.<br /><br />At each progressive stage of his life, every night she creeps into his room while he is sleeping and sings the song.  She continues this even after he leaves home until finally she asks him to come to her because she is too old to come to him.  When he comes, she tries to sing but can't finish; he picks her up and rocks her, and sings the song; then he returns home to sing to his new baby.<br /><br />The author has chosen a simple routine that is often repeated by parents with their children to simply and powerfully symbolize this mother's unconditional, faithful love regardless of her son's faults. Although it is implausibly extended to a time of life when the mother shouldn't actually be creeping into her son's bedroom, it stands as an effective symbol of her unchanging love for him.  It is a beautiful tribute to the security that loving parents provide for their children.  (When Christopher was two he referred to this as \\"The Mommy you love me book.\\"<br /><br />The story also portrays an example of maturity, gratitude, and growth into responsibility: the boy becomes the one to nurture his mother at the end of her life, and he passes on the gift of love to his daughter, by singing the same song.  This picture of healthy, intergenerational security is to be prized, and it is unusual to find a picture book that casts a vision for maturity and parenting for readers of this age.<br /><br />One thing to consider before introducing this story is that when the man sings the lullaby to his mother, it is strongly implied that she is dying.  Yesterday when I read this story to now almost four-year-old Christopher, I wiped away tears at this page, and began to explain that I was crying because the man and his mommy love each other so much.  Then I saw that he was also wiping away tears.  Parents who don't feel their children are ready for this kind of emotional material may want to steer clear of it until their children are a little older.<br /><br />It is unfortunately true that the father in this story is absent, both in person and in photos on the walls.  While this plot choice does more clearly emphasize the parent-child bond, this is definitely a single-mother story.  Ordinarily I would rate a story lower because of this, but the clarity of the theme and the intergenerational nature of the love keep this story in our family's \\"favorites\\" box.<br /><br />The appeal of this story ranges across generations and cultural boundaries. According to Robert Munsch's web site, it has sold about 15,000 copies and been translated into a number of languages including Spanish, French, Japanese, Chinese, Swedish, Korean, and Mohawk.  The lullaby is not supplied with a musical score, because the author wants the reader to make up their own melody.

0756405890|1.0|Don't be misled by the high praise plastered across the cover of this book. The plot seems like it's going somewhere for the first 300 hundred pages, but the author manages to take the story nowhere by the end of the book.     I am not scared by long books or series amounting pages in the thousands-I just finished Williams's Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn, which I recommend, by the way, to those who are patient readers. So I started reading The Name of the Wiind... Well, I found it boring, bland, commonplace, linear (yes, despite the jumping perspectives; it all sounded the same).     The book has been much praised around here, but it just didn't connect with me. I couldn't find any reason to keep reading but I kept going to the bitter end.    I know some people like books written at a middle school level-it's easy reading-, but it just doesn't work for me. There is no intelectual depth, just plain dull soap opera narrative. There might be some bright moments, but we're not talking about a 300-page novel where those bright details compensate for the sometimes boring narrative and overall bland story, we're talking about a 600-page book that's one of many and chock full of boring, bland, dull, monotony.     There are plenty more interesting books to read out there. In summary: very uninspiring, very boring.
B00003CXCT|5.0|The bonus disc is the true treasure. The Empire of Dreams: The Story of the Star Wars Trilogy, a 150-minute documentary is inspiring.     Plus the actual movies have a new digital transfer that makes them beautiful on your small screen. Then to the mix are the additions that are literally running around in the background of old scenes and there are even a scene or two added to the original action that make these old favorites fresh again.

THE EYES LIGHT UP AND IS TRULY CREEPY IF YOU SNEAK UP BEHIND SOMEONE AND PRESS THE BUTTON AND ALL THEY SEE ARE THE RED EYES!! THE VIDEO IS THE BEST PRESENTATION OF T2 EVER, BUT DUE TO ALL THE EDITIONS THAT HAVE EVER BEEN MADE YOU CAN SEE THE MASTER PRINT DEFINITELY HAS A LOT OF DAMAGE THAT WILL MORE THEN LIKELY BE IMPOSSIBLE TO EVER COMPLETELY CLEAN UP. THOUGH IT IS VERY NOTICEABLE HOW MUCH NOISE REDUCTION THERE IS IN COMPARISON TO ANY OTHER VERSION OF THE FILM. THE AUDIO ON THE OTHER HAND IS FANTASTIC, THE 6.1 DTS-HD MASTER AUDIO IS WORTH GETTING THE SKYNET EDITION ALONE, IT TRULY HAS PUT ME IN THE FILM LIKE NO OTHER VERSION EVER HAS!! THE BD-LIVE IS REALLY COOL AND EASTER EGGS FROM PREVIOUS VERSIONS OF THE FILM ARE HERE SO BASICALLY YOU CAN WATCH 3 DIFFERENT CUTS OF THIS MOVIE ON THE T2 SKYNET BLU-RAY.

Donna is a great assistant to and for the Doctor. She is a great foil to his wit. (Almost a spoiler coming up) Though her character is taken care of amazingly at the season's end fans do hope for a reprise as the other assistants have been.     If you own any of the other seasons this is one you will not want to leave out.     Credendo vides    MB

1416968725|4.0|I found this book when I was looking for another Emily Gravett book \\"Orange, Pear, Apple, Bear\\" (also really great).  After reading the other reviews, I bought this book for my 17mo old daughter.  She LOVES this book.  It's a little big for her to pull off the shelf but she often pulls it off and carries it over to have us read it to her.  She loves the different sized pages with the eggs hatching and sometimes we rock back and forth together during the \\"Creak crack\\" lines for fun.  She also loves to turn to the back cover and say \\"mama\\".  I would definitely recommend based on how much my little bookworm loves this as well as its lovely illustration and nice storyline.

From the opening guitar on \\"Southern Point\\" to the angelic choral moments that close out the album on \\"Foreground\\" we are reminded of how great and breathtaking music truely can be. In an age of disposable music and pop stars it's refreshing to see that there are still a handful of bands/artists out there that are dedicated to honing their craft with an end purpose of creating something that is, art. There are no words that can fully describe how wonderful \\"Veckatimest\\" is, its an album that you need to discover for yourself, over and over again.

B001TH16DI|5.0|The cat's out of the bag on this but I want to help raise the rating on this excellent blu-ray collection.  I own these films and will state again: YES, these films are all HD-- some of the best HD I've seen at times (esp. part 3).  There are moments where the picture gets a touch soft, and there are also moments of edge enhancement and banding, but these discs are without a doubt, honest-to-goodness HD.  The packaging is incredibly unclear on this point but rest assured, it's as high-def as any blu-ray.  If you're a fan but on the fence, relax.  Buy this set and enjoy.
B000TU16GS|5.0|Have you ever doubted a suspicious circumstance? Well, Alex Rider certainly did. Alex's parents had both died in a plane crash when he was younger. After the tragic accident, Alex lived with his uncle, Ian, and his housekeeper Jack Starbright. Now, Alex received the heartbreaking news that his uncle died in a mysterious car crash. Alex became doubtful because he knew that Ian was a very careful adult, and being told that he died in a car accident because he didn't buckle his seatbelt didn't seem realistic. One day, Alex decided to go to the bank his uncle worked at to see Alan Blunt. Here, Alex is told that his uncle was a spy for M16, Britain's top-secret intelligence agency. Alex isn't left wit much of a choice. So he joins M16 and is now their youngest agent. Alex's first mission is to infiltrate Herod Sayle's computer making factory and to find his uncle's killer.      This book most definitely lures you in at the start. Stormbreaker is written by the fabulous author Anthony Horowitz. This book is a pretty easy read, and I wouldn't recommend it for adults. I would rate this book a five star book because this fast-paced book was just a pleasure to read. The plot is extraordinary, and the author is very descriptive about the character's circumstances. I think that every kid in middle and high school should read this book.   -J.P

Understanding the core concepts of the language, such as the prototypical OO model, closures, functions as data, etc. will help you go far if JavaScript is something you use on daily basis.<br /><br />While there are numerous JavaScript libraries in existence today (jQuery, MochiKit, Dojo, prototype, YUI, etc.) that simplify a lot of what needs to get done client-side, understanding the language itself is still necessary for those times when the abstractions that the libraries provide leak/fail or don't provide some feature you want.<br /><br />If you are frustrated by JavaScript, you only need to spend the time educating yourself about how it really works. Once you do, and with some experience, you will reach that state of Nirvana that allows you to work easily in this language.<br /><br />Note: This book is not a technique book - i.e. it will not really teach you any cool tricks, per se, so much as give you an undiluted understanding of the core features of the language.

B001ED7C58|5.0|The Twilight soundtrack is one of the best film soundtracks I have heard in a very long time.  I loved nearly each song and they fit with all the key scenes in Catherine Hardwicke's fantastic adapation of my favorite book.      Paramore's Decode is not to be missed...much like Muse's Supermassive Black Hole (of course!), Mutemath's Spotlight, Flightless Bird, by Iron and Wine...I could go on. Also not to be missed is Robert Pattinson's Never Think which is haunting and moving and fits so well in the restaurant scene in the film. Anyone who has heard Rob sing knows that this song alone is worth purchasing the soundtrack for!

0439023483|3.0|It took until the second chapter for me to get into this book. But, after that, I was hooked until the end.     However, I see this book more as fluff - entertaining, but lacking in much substance. I found Ender's Game to be far superior, and other reviewers have commented on the similarities to Battle Royale and Running Man, among others (I have not experienced either of these, so I can't speak to the originality of the plot).    I thought the writing and characterization were Suzanne's strengths in this book. And, I would probably read the next book in the series when it comes out because the ending of this one was so unsatisfactory.    Setting: Dystopian America in far-future. There are some class differences between districts that provide some conflict, although it is not really explained much. There is not much unique here (yet), but I don't yet really have an understanding of why things are the way they are, so it may get better. I didn't feel like I was drawn into the story world. I was reading \\"outside\\" of it the entire time.    Plot: Kids have to kill other kids in order to keep people from rebelling. Seems like a strange reason to me. If my child were picked, that is one reason why I would rebel. And why couldn't the spunky protagonist rebel? There is also some love interest stuff going on that integrates in the story line, but nothing much else. Of course, I wouldn't expect much more from a YA book.    Conflict: A lot of the potential conflict is killed by the deus ex machina \\"gift\\" devices. Although, I thought it worked well for the bread after Kat's scene with Rue. I also did not like the undead monsters at the end. They seemed to come out of nowhere and to kill the tension around having to fight the other kid. I was also disappointed that the game was so un-pressuring. The only real forcing together was the fire. If I were in charge, I would have forced them together every day around prime time viewing. The love triangle conflict is working pretty wellfor me though.    Characters: Again, a strength of the author. I liked Katniss' wry voice (although she seemed to act much younger than 16 most of the time). I loved Rue and Peeta. I would much rather have had the story from their perspective, actually (but, then, maybe I wouldn't like them quite so much). I also really liked the designer, Cinna. I'm hoping he is in the next book.    Text: The first-person, present tense narrative is what threw me off for the first chapter: it is so overdone and ruins tension about the character potentially dying. There was no indication of why it was written this way, other than as a device to get in only Kat's head and to make it seem more present so she \\"could\\" potentially die. However, when I came back to it and started the second chapter, it didn't really bother me (a little bit here and there, but it didn't throw me out of the story). I thought the writing itself was well-done - very clear and descriptive.
0345446798|2.0|I am truly disappointed after reading all the great reviews on this book. The main point she tries to drive home is that canids and primates communicate differently, hence our trouble in communicating with our dogs. Fair enough, however this could have been done in the first chapter instead of ad nauseam throughout the entire book. I GET IT...we communicate differently. Quit telling me why and tell me step by step how to communicate with my dog correctly!<br />Most of her personal examples relate to her own dogs and sheep herding. This is great if you are trying to get your dog to herd sheep but for me these were just a tedious  stories I had to muddle through in an attempt to get to something worthy for me to learn. I never got there. After getting tired of her anecdotal explanations and constant references to her PHD, I put down the book half way through it. The first book by Caesar Milan was much more interesting and informative.

B001SMC91M|4.0|Hehhhh! Something great has been brewing over the last couple of years. Funky, gutbucket soul music is back! Not the canned, overblown, and ersatz junk you hear on TV singing contests and sitcoms but true 60's style R&B. Sharon Jones, Amy Winehouse (yes, Amy Winehouse-she used Sharon Jones' backing band on Back to Black), and Raphael Saadiq are all doing their part to resurrect soul. And now Black Joe Lewis & the Honeybears have stepped up to the plate.<br /><br />Tell `Em What Your Name Is! is a gritty, storming, high energy debut album. Black Joe Lewis sings like James Brown and the Honeybears have that classic bass-and-horn driven Stax sound. That's right, it's like the Godfather of Soul fronting the Mar-Keys or Booker T. & the MGs. Talk about two great things that go great together--forget Reese's Peanut Butter Cups!<br /><br />If that doesn't mean anything to you, just listen to the samples. You'll be up and on your feet dancing in no time. Then, check out some [[ASIN:B000001DUP JB]] and [[ASIN:B000KP62UM Stax]] cuts and you'll see what I'm talkin' about.<br /><br />Now then, back to the album. It's pretty much funky soul all the way through, with a few blues tunes, including a Yardbirds style rave up and a Fat Possum-like Mississippi hill country droner, tossed in for good measure. Black Joe and the band play loud and hard on every track...don't go looking for any slow jams on this platter. The only real flaws are that the running time is kind of short and the music seems to have been mixed for iPod and computer listening, with every element of the music placed way upfront. These are merely quibbles, however, and don't take much away from what is a fun and enjoyable record.<br /><br />Bottom line: both old school and newer soul/R&B fans will dig this album. Strongly recommended.<br /><br />-----<br />This disc made me think of these...<br />[[ASIN:B000003BR8 It's Great When You're Straight...Yeah]]: Happy Mondays + Stax = Memphchester<br />[[ASIN:B000GIWS4W What It Is!]]: cool box set of obscure and rare soul cutsuts

1594200823|5.0|We get more sensitive about issues concerning life and death as we get older, and the questions relating to how much pain we are willing to cause other sentient beings in order to satiate our appetite is one we wrestle with until we die. This book is one of the most important contributions to the canon of who are we and what should we be doing. I don't think anybody should go to the next world without reading it and pondering the questions it poses. I believe that we avoid thinking about moral issues at our peril. As painful as they may be, they must be addressed.
B00129H7VS|5.0|I hold WWII close to my heart.  I am in the Army, and my grandfather fought on the European front in WWII.  He was also a POW to the Germans for about a year.  He was emaciated, but after being liberated by US and British forces, he went on to fight in the Battle of the Bulge.  Even though I'm in the Army, I can't even imagine being in some of the situations depicted in this series.  The \\"Why We Fight\\" episode is particularly moving.  That concentration camp was terrible enough, yet not half as monstrous as others; incredible.
0743290127|1.0|I picked up this novel before a six-hour flight and suffered through it because it was the only thing I had to read besides the Skymall catalog.      I liked \\"The Devil Wears Prada,\\" and to an extent \\"Everyone Worth Knowing,\\" but this novel was absolutely horrid.  All three of the characters are unlikable, shallow and insensitive.  I wasn't rooting for any of them to catch Harry Winston until they went through some serious emotional growth.    This book was not interesting or funny.  All of the situations and dialog are very flat.  I would not recommend this to anyone.
B00006LLLN|5.0|I bought this album solely for the song, \\"Down to the River to Pray,\\" which Alison Krauss sings acapella. It is haunting and inspiring at the same time. The other songs on the album are great, too. Alison Krauss's crystal clear voice is one of a kind and this album with the audience response of the \\"live\\" performance make it a great bluegrass album.

B001TOD92C|3.0|Aside from the brilliant performance by Mickey Rourke, The Wrestler offers very little in the entertainment category. Granted, this is strictly a drama with only a handful of actors but I never got deeply attached to any part of the film. Perhaps it's because it deals quite a bit with wrestling. And even though that isn't really the point of the film, you can't ignore it.     Rourke's character is a battered, practically washed-up pro wrestler who lives in a trailer park, has no money and no family except for a daughter who wants nothing to do with him. He spends quite a bit of time at the local strip club where he befriends a stripper played quite convincingly by Marisa Tomei.     To sum up a long story- Rourke wants to get back in his daughter's (Even Rachel Wood) life after he suffers a heart attack. He tries to change his ways by giving up his passion for wrestling and commiting to a relationship with his daughter-and here is where it gets a bit dramatic-but well, not to spoil anything, but I think we can all pretty much guess what'll happen.     The minute you feel an ounce of pity for someone, it flies out the window as soon as they do something stupid again. It can be a bit frustrating at times to watch.     If I had to rate this film, I would give it a B-  The performance by Rourke really is extroadinary and completely believable and sometimes endearing-but the film itself is a tad dissapointing.
0307460444|5.0|i *love* Martha Stewart's cupcake book! for years i've been searching her web site for cupcake ideas for baby showers and my kids' birthday parties. this book is chock full of wonderfully creative cupcakes for all seasons, holidays and special occasions! i've already made the shark and beach parasol cupcakes for my son's ocean-themed birthday party and the beautiful buttercream chrysanthemum cupcakes for a baby shower. you may think you need some special talent to pull her creations off, but all you need is a little practice and patience! there is no way you can leaf through this book without getting inspired...and drooling! After 287 pages of pics of and recipes for mouth-watering cupcakes, she includes informative pages on tools for baking, how to prepare a piping bag, working with fondant and marzipan, pastry tips and even how to display your treats. my husband agrees that this was a wonderful investment since he's seen how many of her baking ideas have come to fruition in our home...plus he's hoping i make him those yummy tiramisu or choc. salted-caramel mini cupcakes for his birthday! ;) yummo!

0375842209|5.0|This is by far one of the best books I have ever read! Everyone should read it. It reminds us there are always two sides to every story. I love the history connection.

B001EQJ4DS|5.0|Whoever the reviewer was in Nov. 2007, I think he's a frustrated science fiction writer. I grew up with Star Trek and this series is very satisfying. The characters have depth and are accessible. Rodney the cowardly genius does a marvelous acting job and is simultaneously insufferably insensitive and sympathetic. I love the strong female role models the series presents. I recommend it to my granddaughters because there is quite a range from the gentle Dr. Keller to the Warrior Queen empathic Teyla. In fact this is the only series I can think of where women are consistently in charge of the base operations. Elizabeth Weir was feminine, analytic, and a force to be reckoned with no matter how intimidating the adversary. Samantha Carter is refreshing while being a down-to-earth leader and outstanding scientist.     There are multiple role models for boys as well. Col. Shepherd's diffidence and sarcastic banter is amusing yet the archetypal fly-boy confidence that we North Americans love and different from General Jack O'Neill's. And, while Ronen is not long on talk, he's great to watch and the episode that showed his tracking of the other runner was really interesting. Major Lorne is a classic military guy who loves to paint. Carson Beckett is generous with his caring but also all male. It's a great series.    The bad guys are really bad, except of course for Todd, who is what he is. Even Michael is at times sympathetic while he's experimenting on and killing thousands.     I enjoy the stories, particularly the esoteric ones like The Shrine and the Outcast. I'd love to see Elizabeth Weir reappear in much the way that Carson Beckett did.     It's a real shame that this series is ending. I hope they do make a movie but it's got to be better than Stargate Continuum because it was really hokey where all the lieutenants or subcommanders looked like villains from 1950s B movies (a Chinese in Mandarin dress?! Have some imagination please!).    My hope is that someone with money will see this for the gold mine that it is and will pick it up but keep all the same writers and actors.
0385341008|4.0|Once I sat down, I didn't get up until I had read the whole book! I am planning a trip to Guernsey! I loved this book. It took about 30 minutes of forced reading to really get into the plot, but once I \\"got it\\" I could not make myself put it down. I kept telling myself I was only going to read one more letter, but one more turned into the entire book. I was there with them. My heart broke with them and it rejoiced with them. I just kept hoping Elizabeth would come back. The only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is i was dissapointed with the ending. i wanted to experience more of the love story between Juliet and Dawsey. It just stopped! I thought the letters would be boring, but the were essential to the plot. It made it an easy read and a wonderful read! I love the history aspect of the book.
B00000ILDF|4.0|First off, who is this Marshall Fine person?  First, he slams Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, then he criticizes David Fincher for being a content underachiever.  Marhshall also forgets to mention that the content also comes with a well written script. So Marshall, why are you slamming Fincher for the supposed content-underachievment?  Putting all of it on the responsibilty of the director seems to me like a very ignorant move.<br /><br />Really, what's the deal with so many people hating this movie.  Now, I definitely agree with the people that think this movie is not as good as the first two.  Heck, those movies are up there as some of the best science ficiton movies of all time.  But wow, the negative hatred for this movie is off the roof, for reasons I can't really fathom.  I mean, the acting is fine, with Mrs Weaver herself doing her usual acting, the plot interests me, the sets are designed well, and it's directed.<br /><br />Supposedly people _______ about how the plot kills off three of the memembers, I think people are just sensitive.  Face it, people you like can die.  That's okay, right?  I really don't see much flaw in the plot, really.  Plots may interest others that others don't find interesting, so criticsm of plots are pretty mook when trying to make the problems seem universal and will affect all moviegoers.  Some people also just don't like David Fincher, and that's also a matter of choice.  I disagree. David Fincher was resposible for directing Se7en and Fight Club, two very respected (haven't seen Fight Club, though I definitely want to) movies known for some great plots.  Nuff said.<br /><br />Film making wise, it's as dank, gritty as it has ever been.  There's also some very cool shots of gore, much better done than it was in the first movie (of course, besides the Chestburster, there isn't much gore in the movie).  And of course, there is the alien aspect.  We learn more about the Alien, in that being it can attach to more than just one animal.  The dog alien isn't my favorite hybrid (the Alien and Predator hybrid so far is the best), but it's the very first hybrid animal, and a cool one at that (it's an alien, you can't go wrong with a freakin alien for christ sakes).<br /><br /> It's not the classics that Alien and Aliens are, but it's definitely not the disgrace people want you to believe.  And it's definitely not a film you can throw into the trash either.  Definitely an underrated film.<br /><br />PS Cool cover art.isn't my favorite hybrid (the Alien and Predator hybrid so far is the best), but it's the very first hybrid animal, and a cool one at that (it's an alien, you can't go wrong with a freakin alien for christ sakes).

B001E5FYS8|4.0|\\"Man on Wire\\" touches the mind and the heart.  It's amazing.    However, I have one problem with the film -- a \\"fault\\" which I imagine may have been caused by its (probably minimal) stock-footage-licensing budget.  The film could have used more historical context regarding the general state of decay and implosion in which the city of New York and the USA found itself during the Nixon Resignation, the bankruptcy of New York City, and the late-1960s/early-1970s critique of the Twin Towers as bastions of over-the-top capitalism (which they would remain until 2001.)  Both NYC and the USA were hurting in 1974.  But Petit's (a Frenchman's) unexpected, (and, thankfully, successful) highwire performance did a service to the Twin Towers by promoting and humanizing them, and to New York City and to the USA by re-emphasizing the the spirit of risk, initiative, and freedom that animated the Towers and that animates the United States.

B001RTSPVY|5.0|Warning!  Many, many spoilers below!  Do NOT read this review of you do not want to be spoiled!  If all you want to know is whether this is a great show that is worth your time, yes, it most assuredly is.  Get it.  Watch it.  Look out for spoilers from here on out.<br /><br />Season One of BREAKING BAD was interrupted unhappily by the writers' strike.  It was one of the very few shows that stopped production to come back strong afterwards (well, PUSHING DAISIES came back strong creatively, but its viewership dropped somewhat and ABC, panicking with the downturn in the economy, unwisely pulled the plug on its best series).  One of the reasons that BREAKING BAD was able to come back and even build a bit of buzz over Season One was the well-deserved Emmy that Bryan Cranston won as Best Actor in a Drama.  Anyone who had seen him in MALCOLM IN THE MIDDLE knew that he was an extremely gifted comic actor, but seeing him perform so magnificently in a drama was almost like watching Jerry Seinfeld morph into Laurence Olivier.  Even the few episodes of Season One were enough to prove to anyone that Cranston was not merely a great comic actor, but one of the best actors around, regardless of genre.<br /><br />Season Two picked up where Season One left off and took Walter White and Jesse's story much further than had been possible in the debut season.  I am not quite certain where they had intended to end Season One.  I'm pretty certain that it would not have ended with Walter and Jesse making an arrangement with the gang lord Tuco to sell drugs to him.  No doubt they were forced to compact the story somewhat in Season Two to make up for the lost episodes.  The new season sees several general arcs develop.  Walter and Jesse's relationship to Tuco comes to an end and they are forced first to go into the business of selling themselves.  Later they make a new arrangement to sell their product to a major outside distributor.  Walter and Skyler's relationship comes under more and more strain as Walter strives to keep his life as a drug manufacturer hidden from her.  One of the most interesting parts of the show is the relationship between Walter and Jesse.  Although Walter despises and looks down upon Jesse, he also takes more and more the attitude of a parent towards an unruly child.  Even when he becomes a liability to Walter, he refuses to break his partnership with him.  But Walter becomes more and more hardened as the season goes along, becoming as ruthless as any of the drug lords he and Jesse encounter.<br /><br />Some of his decisions are so extreme that by the end of the season Walter actually starts to become a less than sympathetic character.  In fact, as much as I love this show -- and it is definitely among my very favorites alongside such shows as DOLLHOUSE, FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS, and MAD MEN -- I'm starting to wonder if Walter's growing hardening as a person will make him too unsympathetic a character for the show to stay as good as it has been.  Although other series like THE SHIELD have pushed the limits of how far one can go with the moral degradation of a lead character, there is a limit to just how far one can go.  By the end of Season Two one hardly empathizes with Walter as his life gradually begins to unravel.  And Jesse remains so pathetic that it is hard to care for him as much as we ought.  I'm far from the only person feeling this and hopefully in the off season the writers will listen to the fans and do something to make us care what happens to Walter, to make us want this to turn out OK for him.<br /><br />As great as this series is, there was one other thing in Season Two, besides Walter's growing unlikeability, that was a cause of disappointment, and that was the season finale.  Beginning with the first one, several episodes began with confusing and disturbing images of some cataclysmic event.  The natural expectation was that this was all leading up to some huge event at the end of the season.  Only . . . it didn't.  There was an event, but it was completely unconnected to anything involving Walter or Jesse.  I was simply aghast when the finale ended with nothing like the kind of resolution that the entire season seemed to be leading up to.<br /><br />There was a happy coincidence to end the season.  The finale was entitled \\"ABQ.\\"  Initially I misread the title. I thought it was \\"ABC.\\"  The reason this is interesting is that John de Lancie guest starred as the father of Jane, Jesse's girlfriend (played by the adorable Krysten Ritter -- when is she going to get a permanent gig on a series?  I've loved her on other shows like VERONICA MARS and THE GILMORE GIRLS and would love to see her in a major role on some series).  I have always loved John de Lancie and like Krysten Ritter, would like to see him far more often.  He is best known, of course, for his recurring role on the various STAR TREK spin offs, as the omnipotent, omniscient Q.  The happy coincidence is that many of his appearances on the STAR TREK episodes had titles that referred to his character, such as \\"Q2\\" or \\"True Q\\" or \\"Qpid\\" or \\"The Q and the Grey.\\"  \\"ABQ\\" isn't too unlike one of those titles.  I don't think it was intended as homage to Q, but it was serendipitous.<br /><br />All in all, despite the increasing unlikeability of Walter and the disappointing finale, this was a great season.  There were many great episodes and a host of unforgettable moments.  The shot of a decapitated head slowly moving across the desert atop the back of a turtle is shocking in its horror.  Equally marvelous is a near quadriplegic who can only communicate by ringing a tiny bell attached to his chair.  Or a car that is bucking and jumping in place without a driver.  Or a drug addled hag crushing her lover's skull by lowering an ATM machine on it.  And when you get in trouble, you know what you need to do:  You'd better get Saul!<br /><br />I have a lot of faith in Vince Gilligan and his team of writers.  I think they will deal with the problem of Walter becoming too unlikeable.  And I think they will continue to come up with new and ever more fascinating story lines.  I'm excited about seeing what happens in Season Three.was completely unconnected to anything involving Walter or Jesse.

0060920084|2.0|I don't think this book really deserves hate, but...    Okay, well, I just went on a three week long trip, much of it through small town America, so when I came home and saw this book lying on the coffee table, abandoned by my sister, I snapped it up because I was interested in what Bill Bryson would have to say about the trip I just took.  I expected to laugh and to repeatedly nod along in agreement about how, yes, that's EXACTLY what Jeffery City, WY is like.    I was sorely disappointed.    Not so much about the laughing.  There was some of that to be had.  My issue is that, even in 1989, this book didn't describe how things were.  It didn't even come close.  This book is catered to the exact opposite of people who see things through rose-colored glasses - it's catered to those people who see things through turd colored glasses that are also rather opaque.  It's like he just took every stereotype that ever was and wrote a book on that.  I partially doubt that he even went on the trip.    It's not just because of all the judgmental/prejudice/whatever crap that people have already complained about (and, I have to tell you after having sat around as a bunch of Wyoming ranchers explained to me exactly what went on during the Tang dynasty and all the physics behind launching rockets, I will never assume small town America is full of dumb people again).  It's because he was just plain wrong.  It was like he didn't research anything.  People don't live in national parks?  Uh, well, someone lives in the middle of Dinosaur AND they lease the land to ranchers.  People live in the Grand Tetons and even Yellowstone.  Also, I find it highly unlikely no one was hiking or biking in Great Smoky Mountain when he was there.  The hiking areas there are packed and have been that way for a long time.  I don't think it's possible to hike at GSM without running up someone else's butt.  Not to mention all the horseback riding.  No more billboards with cheesy poems and interesting cut-out pictures?  Every small town was littered with fast food chains and malls?  What road was he driving down?  I drove 250 miles and through three towns before I even found a non-diesel gas station.  I'd have killed for any sort of real restaurant or diner.    I'm not going to list everything that was factually incorrect or off, but there was a lot, which I really picked up on as I'd just driven to a lot of the places he went to (or I live near them) and I know it hasn't magically changed in 20 years (or even 50 years, for that matter).  It really put me off.  I could deal with all the petty stereotypes (anti-Southern much?) because they made me laugh (as did all the comments about Southerners), but it was all so... fake.  Like he flew to the America on another planet or the America in a really bad British angstfest, written and produced by people who'd never seen America or Americans and only knew them through parodies or soap operas or their mother's best friend's uncle's father-in-law's brother.  I couldn't relate to it and so I was disappointed and will look elsewhere for my hilariously deprecating fiction on America.
031606792X|2.0|MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS: READ AT YOUR OWN RISK (sounds ominous, doesn't it? ;])    I think the proper way to begin this is to explain how I came to read the Twilight series (I refuse to call it a \\"saga\\").  I am a sixteen-year-old female, and just about every one of my friends has read the books and fallen completely in love with them.  I was more skeptical, but finally picked up Twilight one afternoon, and finished it the same night.  After that, I was in the same frame of mind as my friends.  That is, until I picked up New Moon.  And that's when doubt started to creep in.  Why was Edward, a main character, absent for the majority of the book, hinted at only in Bella's thoughts?  I hadn't started the series to read about Bella and Jacob, yet that is what New Moon and Eclipse were centered around.  Not to mention the complete disintegration of Bella's character as the books progressed: one minute she professes to love Edward, and Edward alone, and suddenly she's in love with Jacob?  Worse, though she refuses to have more than a platonic relationship with Jacob, she also doesn't want him to leave her.  She doesn't seem to care what Edward thinks of her deteermination to keep Jacob in her life, though it turns out she doesn't have to, because HE ACCEPTS IT: apparently Bella's so perfect she deserves to have everyone fall in love with her (and they do).  Ugh.  I thought that once Bella picked Edward near the end of Eclipse, the love triangle nonsense would cease, but I was wrong...       The first few chapters of Breaking Dawn were okay -- Bella finally getting married, going on her honeymoon, etc.  Those were the \\"sane\\" chapters, the ones that keep me from giving this book a one-star review, though I do have to agree that Bella's parents willingness to accept her marriage was majorly OOC.  But as soon as the pregnancy storyline began, it went downhill.  I think I have to agree with everyone else that Meyer set rules for her world early on; if vampires were able to producechildren she should have made that clear earlier.      I hated Part Two because it was narrated by Jacob.  I accept that Bella would be too out-of-it to narrate the birth scene herself, but why Jacob?  Again, I thought the premise of this series was about love between a human and a vampire; if Meyer really wanted to use a different viewpoint, why not use Edward -- isn't he supposed to be the OTHER main character?  But if I was expecting more insight into Edward's feelings, I was disappointed.  In fact, he doesn't seem to do much throughout the book except support Bella and be the perfect husband.      Oh, and I was a Jacob and Leah fan, too, but of course Jacob imprinted on Renesmee.  About the imprinting: I don't care about the age difference between R&J, mostly because the one between Bella and Edward is much larger, but I keep picturing awkward moments in which Jacob has to discuss his former romantic love for his mother-in-law...    I don't like battle scenes, so I didn't really care that there wasn't a showdown with the Volturi, but why go on and on about an imminent battle that was never going to happen?      The ending wasn't so bad, though I have to agree that Bella getting everything she wanted with virtually no consequences was completely unrealistic.  We should all be so lucky...
B001YV502C|5.0|The Movie:   The Apocalypse. A subject of many debates and dreaded talks. When will the world end, and how? No one will ever know, even though the Mayans had a good date for it (2012.) Children of Men is an apocalyptic thriller, but it differs from many of the ones out already. In this film, the apocalypse is brought upon us not by famine, or a plague, or the supernatural, but in the cease of human birth. The premise is of despair, and the film evokes it perfectly. Directed by Alfonso Cuaron, this films puts you in the middle of the collapse of unity in the world. Britain is the only place on Earth that is still under government control, and all of the illegal immigrants are considered refugees, which are being thrown into \\"fugee zones,\\" reminiscent of concentration camps during WWII. Theo (Clive Owen) gets involved in a mission by a group of renegade fighters lead by Julian (Juliane Moore,) Theo's ex-wife, who want to help secure the first pregnant woman in 18 years, who also happens to be a refugee. With the help of his best and only friend, Jasper (Michael Caine,) Theo will do all he can to save the life of the girl, in the process finding redemption for the ghosts of his past. The events that follow are nail-biting tense, and one of the final scenes in the film, which is an 8 minute long shot done in ONE take, help secure the tension of the film.  The vision that Cuaron puts on display is original and, in my opinion, amazing. You know it's the future, since you will see many neon signs and LCD displays all throughout the city, yet it's not too sci-fi, so you won't see flying cars or talking robots. Having this sense of realism mixed with sci-fi elements grounds the film, making it a more believable 2027. The visual effects here are extremely well crafted, specifically (minor spoiler) the birth of the baby. Also, add the amazing performances by Clive Owen, Juliane Moore, and Michael Caine, and you have a film for the ages.  The Blu-Ray:  Video:   Man, as soon asI put this baby in my PS3, I knew I was in for a treat. The detail in the picture is outstanding! In the outdoor shots, you can see every branch in the trees on the outskirts of Jaspers house, and inside of his home, all of the objects are finely represented. I noticed some pretty deep blacks, and the colors are vivid and sharp. Even though this is a \\"cold\\" film, and the main pallete is \\"steely,\\" when it wants to shine, it does. 5 out of 5.  Audio:   This mix is just bombastic and awesome! The opening bombing scene had some amazingly deep bass, and the unique alarms and music in Jaspers home did as well. This film excels in dialogue, and it was always intelligible. Pans and directionality are perfect, and I never had an issue with volume control, which was an issue I had with \\"The Incredible Hulk,\\" which was also a Universal release. The film gave my bass a workout, so I say \\"Thank you, Universal.\\" Another 5 out of 5.  Overall, this film is one to be seen. After watching it at least 5 times, there were things that I missed from prior viewing. Watch and enjoy this stellar film, and reference quality Blu-Ray.
B001GCUO16|1.0|This is exactly the kind of loud and dumb movie that the X-Men franchise specifically sought to avoid becoming.  The first two films (X-Men and X2) were some of the best examples of a smart, socially relevant story adapted into an epic, fun and wholly emotionally satisfying adventure. Since director Bryan Singer stepped away from the franchise, these films have (seemingly) been overtaken by mindless Fox execs who have no idea how to handle these characters in a way that doesn't become an uninteresting paint-by-numbers explosion B-Reel.<br /><br />And no, \\"It's Not That Bad\\" is not a reason to see Wolverine. That's an unnecessary excuse that, give the leaps in quality the Comic Book genre has made, it's a completely erroneous excuse. It just plain IS that bad, and sure as hell not worth any of your time or money.
0143038419|3.0|I just finished the book yesterday and I must say I have mixed feelings. First i'll start with the good feelings. While the book is well written, the language, prose, alliteration,allusion, and descripitions were wonderful. The way she spilt the book made sense and also helped me adjust my mood for each part. My favorite part of the Journey was probably when she was in India finding God and when she spent time with Ketut Liyer the mediceman....there was something that was so genuine about him and reminded me of my grandfather a lot!! I found his way of thinking and explaining to be very interesting.    Now for the bad feelings.Some parts of the book tended to be repetitive and I actually ended up skimming those parts;I hate when authors do that! I still don't get what caused her such grief. I know she felt she wasnt in a good marriage but she didnt really establish what caused it other than \\"too painful to visit\\" It seemed like she just up and left her ex-husband abruptly and maybe that is why he was giving her such a hard time with the divorce? I just think that if she used that as the reason for  her whole reason to go on this journey of self-discovery she should have explained it further. Why did she have to nickname her Italian pal Luca Spaghetti? that was annoying!    Overall, I enjoyed some parts of it but not sure if it was enough to warrant it a good read.

0316044695|4.0|The first part of Luttrell's book deals, at length, with the insanely difficulty, soldier-breaking, and often unfair process of becoming a SEAL. As Luttrell puts it:    \\"To state that a man is a Navy SEAL communicates about a ten thousandth of what it really means. It would be as if General Dwight D. Eisenhower mentioned he'd once served in the Army.\\"    The second part of the book explains, indirectly, exactly why the process of forging true Special Forces caliber soldiers like the SEALs has to be that insanely difficult, soldier-breaking, and often unfair. His portrait of his friends on their final mission is searing, and unforgettable. The Navy Cross, as great an honor as it is given its proud tradition and the roster of men who have earned it, is less than they deserve.    I cover the global defense industry, and it can be easy for many people to forget the human side of it all. Luttrell reminds those who need reminding that this human side is the most interesting - and as Col. John Boyd would affirm, the most important side of war.    The book has one unfinished element, but that's because it's also unfinished in Luttrell. He had to make a terrible decision: kill 3 Afghans who had blundered into their position, in order to vastly improve their odds of safe escape, or let them go, knowing that there were good odds they'd inform over 100 Taliban and al-Qaeda terrorists of his 4-man SEAL team's presence. He chose to let them go. And his best friends died as a result.    He lost his brothers. He failed to save them. And this is a SEAL, someone with an absolute personal ethic of responsibility. He clearly hates that decision, and there's a part of such men that makes it very hard for them to ever forgive themselves for something like that. And, and I think this is the worst part of it for Marcus, he made that decision partly out of fear. Fear of a hostile media that would pillory an act entirely normal and justified in human warfare, and of the threat of his own beloved country turning against the team and imprisoning them.     He's right that this is an indefensible fear for a society to give the people it sends behind enemy lines. But reading the book, and the kind of person he is, I'm not sure that he could have made another decision at the time, even if that fear had been removed. He talks about \\"thinking like Christians\\" when he tries to express some of what was behind that decision. And as much as he hates that choice now, that's a real part of his background, too.    I wish him all the luck and grace in the world as he tries to come to terms with it all. And I thank him, deeply, as he continues to stand on the toughest front lines as a Navy SEAL. Thank you, Marcus. Thank you, Murph, Axe, Danny, Kristensen, Shane, James, Senior, Jacques, Taylor, and Mac. May we in America continue to earn and remain worthy of the sacrifices you all made.

Well, it has happened to me one time too many with Picoult's books. Her bio says she had a ridiculously happy childhood and then went to Princeton.  Maybe this happy life left her wanting to explore the trials and tribulations of normal people.  She does that well.  But she seems to be unable to end a book without a major disaster, preferrably in the last dozen pages.  I didn't have a perfect childhood, nor did my parents send me to Princeton to study writing.  My life is one of struggle and loss and pain with some good times thrown in.  I don't mind reading books with realistic endings that are not always upbeat. I thought the ending of \\"Handle with Care\\" had a purpose, that it made a statement about quality of life for children born with OA type II.  But there was gratuitious havoc at the end of \\"My Sister's Keeper.\\" My life has included sufficient pain and miserable endings.  I don't read literature for more.  When I finish a book, I want to have been exposed to someone else's reality, someone else's world and to have gotten to know the people.  If a writer is good, and Picoult is, by the end, I care about the characters and what happens to them.  After all their struggles, described in loving detail, I don't like for them to be kicked in the teeth at the end. And I don't want to finish a book feeling depressed and thinking I have wasted my time. Jodi, work on your endings.

The recipes I've tried have been a nice staring point, but need serious modifications.  I've had to wonder if these recipes were actually tested before printing the book.  So far I've encountered pan sizes that won't hold the ingredients, cook times that are WAY off, and some amounts that must be mistakes.  I've been baking my whole life, and baking gluten-free for over a year, and have found these recipes a challenge to adapt.  That said, once I've made my changes I've had some great success and feel like some of our favorite family recipes will be born from this cookbook.  If you're going to buy this, consider it a starting point and expect many failures before you find what works for you!

This movie version is based on the beautifully written book by Laura Hillenbrand.<br /><br />This well-written story takes place during the Depression years, when the United States was in need of hope and optimism. During this bleak time, along came a small horse and a half blind jockey who competed against all odds and came out victorious against some of the finest racehorses that money could buy. Seabiscuit gave the country a reason to believe that determination and spirit could prove to be more powerful than size and might.<br /><br />What do you think, is the message as timely today as it was in the 1930's?<br /><br />Seabiscuit is a beautifully filmed and wonderfully acted movie. It's the story of three men and a racehorse all needing each other and the dream of victory that binds them together.<br /><br />Here are the underdogs:<br />* A jockey, brilliantly played by Toby Maguire, who is searching for emotional peace while dealing with physical issues that could potentially keep him from his true love of riding and racing.<br /><br />* A trainer, who had given up on his fellow man but relates to and understands how to bring out the best in his beloved horses.<br /><br />* The businessman, portrayed by Jeff Bridges, recovering from the loss of a child and looking for a reason to go forward - toward the future.<br /><br />* And then there's Seabiscuit, the unruly undersized horse whose spirit to win had been \\"trained\\" out of him. Although trained to lose, the champion he knows he is remains in his heart.<br /><br />Fate intervenes and all four of these underdogs came together giving each other hope, respect and an unstoppable reason to believe in themselves and one another.<br /><br />Here are a few of my favorite quotes from the movie:<br />\\"You don't throw a whole life away because it's banged up a little.\\"<br />\\"The little guy who doesn't know he's a little guy can do great things.\\"<br />\\"Winners don't give up even when life beats them by a nose.\\"<br /><br />I highly recommend Seabiscuit as a motivational must see! Even if you're not an \\"emotional\\" person, it's best to have a box of tissues near by just in case.g from the loss of a child and looking for a reason to go forward - toward the future.     * And then there's Seabiscuit, the unruly undersized horse whose spirit to win had been \\"trained\\" out of him.

B001NFNFNA|4.0|The CHANGELING is a frightening cautionary tale of historical abuses by those in power against the meager. No, I'm not talking about the last eight years under George W. Bush. This is 1928 Los Angeles, and a single mother named Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie, [[ASIN:B001GKJ2FC Wanted]]) returns home from work to find her young son Walter (Gattlin Griffith) missing. After frantic calls to the local police department, the next day a patrol car is sent out and a missing person's report is filed. Five months later Walter is found and brought home ...but it isn't Walter. He  was taller ...and was not circumcised. Ms. Collins pleads with the police to find her son and take back this imposter but the police refuse.<br /><br />Captain J.J. Jones (Jeffrey Donovan, [[ASIN:B000957O82 Hitch]]) of the LAPD tries to make Ms. Collins seem crazy or out of touch. He goes so far as to have her incarcerated at a mental institution where she finds other women like herself who have challenged the authority of the police only to have everything taken away.<br /><br />Meanwhile we learn that an insane man named Gordon Stewart Northcott (Jason Butler Harner, [[ASIN:B000WGWQG8 John Adams]] miniseries) has kidnapped many children and taken them to his distant ranch where unthinkable things were done. Most of this was discovered when a Canadian child illegally in the U.S. spills the goods to a semi-decent cop, Detective Ybarra (Michael Kelly, [[ASIN:B001CW7ZW6 Dawn of the Dead]]) who tries to bring this to the attention of his superiors only to be rebuffed because \\"it doesn't look good for the department.\\"<br /><br />On Ms. Collins' side (even while she's in the loony bin) is Reverend Gustav Briegleb (John Malkovich, [[ASIN:B001JIE7JM Burn After Reading]]) who learns of Christine's problems with the LAPD and already has a running battle going on with them over their autocratic style. His assistance is invaluable in aiding in Christine's release from the mental institution ...as well as releasing the other women who were wrongfully imprisoned on behalf of the LAPD.<br /><br />History tells us that Mr. Northcott gets what's coming to him. He's a slightly pitiable and disgusting fellow who was probably completely insane. Actor Jason Harner played him exceptionally well; a creepy and frightening premonition from the past. We also learn that several LAPD higher-ups get canned in the wake of the breaking news about the despicable things the authorities have done.<br /><br />Most of the praise obviously goes to Angeline Jolie for her excellent portrayal of Christine Collins. You can feel the rising tension as she battles to find her son and butts up against the walls of \\"justice.\\" Frustration is palpable. And you hope beyond hope that little Walter survived his ordeal. But did he?<br /><br />History tells us he probably didn't. But who knows.

B001IMFHTS|4.0|This set of all nine Beethoven symphonies provides a great deal of pleasure for a remarkably modest price. The added excitement of witnessing a live performance visually while enjoying the benefit of superb sound is what makes this a special journey through the Beethoven symphonies for me.<br /><br />Not one of the performances will become my favorite; and given the biases we build up over time, including the fact that we tend to become attached to the first performance of a given work that really moves us, this is not a surprising result, nor one that should particularly dissuade the potential buyer. I do have to register a small amount of disappointment, however, because Abbado is one of my favorite conductors; and I was hoping for a few more revelatory moments than I encountered.<br /><br />The collaboration of one of the world's best conductors and similarly superlative orchestras has produced performances that are at a very high musical level, containing much beauty and not a little virtuosity. I believe that Abbado has carefully considered and honed every phrase of the music, bringing to bear many years of experience and finely tuned sensibility; in addition, he has updated his interpretations to benefit from corrected editions of the scores and has also incorporated a style that is more in keeping with current performance trends, such as hewing more closely to Beethoven's tempo markings and generally eschewing any Romantic excesses. While all these things give us much to admire and recommend these interpretations as almost definitive, I found them to be just a little too much on the \\"safe\\" side to excite me if I remove the visual element. For all their excellence, these are performances that are neither fast nor slow, neither opulent nor austere, neither quirky nor routine, with the result that they fell a little flat with me.<br /><br />I admit, and in fact insist, that Beethoven symphonies are not a good place for conductors to make highly personal statements--stray too far from a straightforward interpretation, and a conductor risks justified wrath at tampering with the sacred; but once in a while someone adds personal touches that make for a truly great performance for all time, for example Bruno Walter's Columbia Symphony recording of Beethoven's Sixth. It may not be correct, especially in terms of today's sensibilities; but it is unique in the best of ways. Abbado has the temperament and supreme musicianship to bring off a similar feat, and yet in this set I do not see that he has.<br /><br />The modern avoidance of anything remotely approaching sentimentality in presenting the work of such a classical and architectural composer as Beethoven is probably as it should be, but I cannot wholly buy into it. As a result I found several instances in which opportunities for expression were passed over, especially in the first three movements of the Ninth. Adhering too closely to Beethoven's tempo markings leads to a sense of trivialization and sing-song-y-ness in several other places, too. A bit surprisingly, though, I actually enjoyed the brisker pace taken in the slow movement of the Ninth.<br /><br />A few very brief impressions of these performances by individual symphony: No. 1, too bouncy; No. 2, not enough humor; No. 3, probably the best of the lot; No. 4, unexceptional; No. 5, really quite exciting; No. 6, not \\"pastoral\\" enough; No. 7, possibly tied with No. 3 for best of set; No. 8, not sunny enough; and No. 9, rallies in the end for a rousing last movement, with outstanding contributions from chorus and soloists.<br /><br />Well-balanced and nicely spread-out audio is further enhanced by the choice of three different mixes: PCM stereo (CD-quality, or better, for the purist and for those lacking a surround-sound setup), and both Dolby Digital and DTS 5.1 surround modes. Those, like me, who like a little heavier bass and a more enveloping surround sound, will probably like the DTS the best.<br /><br />One quibblewith the production (and one that does not apply, for obvious reasons, to the other packagings available of this performance of Symphony No. 3, in which it occupies a disc all to itself) is that the pairing of the two longest symphonies, Nos. 3 & 9, on one disc leads to an unfortunate hesitation of play in the last movement of Sym. No. 3 as a layer-switch occurs to accommodate the greater-than-two-hour length of the disc. First, it would have made more sense to have avoided the problem altogether by swapping the Sym. No.3 with Sym. No. 2 so that one of the discs would have had Sym. Nos. 3 & 5 and another would have had Nos. 2 & 9. The current arrangement that has one disc consisting of only Symphonies Nos. 2 & 5 and with no added special feature, while crowding Nos. 3 & 9 onto one disc, just doesn't make sense.  The layer-switch burp could also have been avoided by making the switch occur between movements, or even between symphonies; letting the switch occur just wherever layer #1 ran happened to run out of space was careless.bvious reasons, to the other packagings available of this performance of Symphony No. 3, in which it occupies a disc all to itself) is that the pairing of the two longest symphonies, Nos. 3 & 9, on one disc leads to an unfortunate hesitation of play in the last movement of Sym.

B000002J29|4.0|I'll not yammer on about the differences between pre and post Gabriel Genesis.     Suffice it to say this is a phenominal album.     The ONLY reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because Genesis did not put out a 3 Album/Disc version of Seconds Out. There was and somewhere still IS PLENTY of material that could have been put to vinyl. I'm also a bit disapointed that there is no DVD to watch on my flat screen.     If Genesis would put it out I'm confident it'd sell like hotcakes.    This is Genesis at their prime.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|I've been listening to a wide variety of music for my entire life (everything from The Association to Smashing Pumpkins to Loreena McKennitt to Dylan). It's safe to say I like a lot of various genres and styles. And while I can appreciate a variety of musical styles and new bands, it is truly rare when an album so thoroughly penetrates my heart and carves out it's own little nirvana inside me. Arcade Fire's FUNERAL is one such album.<br /><br />There's been so much praise heaped on this collection that it's hard to even know where to start in trying to differentiate my comments and praise from the masses. Suffice it to say that this album moves me. Each song is beautiful and powerful and captivating. The lyrics tell stories, the stories rock, and I find myself relating to them like well written short stories--like high art--even as they elevate my mood and let me engage on a purely visceral level.<br /><br />As albums go, this one will be talked about for many years to come.<br /><br />5/5 Stars. A must buy for any music fan.
B000URWYTS|1.0|The author faced every writter dilemma. Should I focus on her or on him? should I do a biography or a romance? and she did not decide.   Instead she focuses on their love affair while only giving superficial glances of the main characters' motivations and does a romance novel but with keeping all the facts true (she explains proudly at the end of the book that everything is accurate except for one speech that was not given in 1907 but in 1909). The outcome is mediocre. Paragraphs on the women rights movements at the beginning of the 20th century cohabites with soapy description of Frank and Mamah's intimate moments. This makes it for a meaningless book which is sad because both Franck and Mamah seemed very special people.  A serious biography of Mamah would have been more interesting. Not a recommended reading.

This video kicks your BUTT from day one (figuratively AND literally), and challenges even those who work out on a regular basis.  I definitely recommend this product to anyone lookin' to get active, tone muscle and burn fat. OH--and did I mention that you can get all of this in no more than 30 minutes per workout?!
B001TODCII|5.0|Former CIA Agent Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) has 96 hours to find his daughter who has been kidnapped and who may be forever lost.  His daughter, played by Maggie Grace (Lost seaons one and two) goes to Paris with her friend, all with Mills' reluctant permission.  Mills then goes into hyper drive working to find his daughter, reaping vengeance along the way.<br /><br />Neeson is very strong and the mood of his intensity is set from the beginning.  He has friends who he was worked with in the past that give us a view of what he was like before he retired to be close to his daughter who lives with ex-wife (Janssen).  The movie helps us to appreciate Mills who after years of neglect, feels a need to be there for his kid.<br /><br />The movie takes us to Los Angeles and to Paris.  There are some very interesting chase sequences, one in a construction site at night, interesting sensation for sure.  There are a few intense fights that are seemingly unrealistic, however, who cares, he is trying to save his daughter.<br /><br />Each encounter with the bad guys gets more and more intense.  The movie crescendos at last with a fight scene on a yacht.  Better than any James Bond type of view, and very interesting indeed.  I think this could be a prequel with Mills and his friends doing their actual work.  I think it would make an interesting story line.<br /><br />I got the Single Disc Extended edition.  Not sure what was added that the movie lacked in the theater.  This is a great movie as I watched it.  This disc was a little lacking in extras, that I would loved to have had to fill in some of the details of the whys and hows of the movie after the fact.<br /><br />Otherwise, this is really good viewing overall.

0060558121|5.0|Neil Gaiman, originally from England, explores an issue that every American, whether they realize it or not, has struggled with. Who are the gods of America? Where do they come from? America is a country founded by people from all over the world, depriving us of a central mythology or religion. Even the people who crossed the land bridge over the Bering Straight brought their gods with them...they weren't here already. This is the problem that face the unique characters in Gaiman's story. They are gods...but what happens to gods when people stop believing in them? People brought them here, and then abandoned them. The gods in the story are  a wandering people,misunderstood, forgotten, and fighting for survival.<br /><br />Shadow unwittingly gets put in the middle of the fight between the old beliefs and the new. As a main character, Shadow is mysteriously incomplete. Although much of the story is told from his point of view, he seems to simply react to things and doesn't ponder them. In any other book, this would be a drawback, but in this one, Shadow fits perfectly. He is a man without a past; after the death of his wife, he lets go of his past and unflinchingly accepts his new fate.<br /><br />As an American reading this book, I really identified with the idea that the country is a difficult place for gods. My ancestors came from all over Europe; there is no one defining culture or belief system. But the book provides a warning, that as a society, in place of the old gods, we have set up new ones: technology, mass media, fashion. To what or whom will we sell our souls?
B001KVZ6FM|2.0|It's gotten to the point that most people assume that whatever Pixar does, it's going to hit a home run. But in the case of their latest 3-D animated story, \\"Up\\", I'm sad to report that this new Pixar concoction does not live up to the all the hype. For those who are watching a Pixar animated film for the first time, of course 'Up' will seem quite impressive. After all, no other studio comes close to Pixar when it comes to the technical aspects of animation. But ultimately, whether a film is animated or not, it's the story and the characters that make a film great.<br /><br />It was a bold move to choose an octogenarian as the film's protagonist--on the surface the crotchety curmudgeon, Carl Fredrickson, the elderly Spencer Tracy look-a-like, is the type of character we haven't seen before especially in an animated film. And 'Up' starts off with two very neat scenes: 1) a take-off on the old Movietone newsreels a la Citizen Kane and 2) a lovely montage sequence which chronicles the graceful aging of Carl and Ellie, the girl he's known since childhood, who becomes his wife.<br /><br />The montage sequence is notably silent and doesn't allow for much character development as to what makes Carl tick. It seems he was always introverted but seemingly happy until Ellie's death. It's perhaps suggested that loneliness has turned Carl into a curmudgeon but with all those happy memories of Ellie, I wonder why he turned into such a sour puss. And that essentially is the problem for most of the film: Carl is simply not very likable. He spends most of his time not acting very nice to Russell, the Explorer Scout stowaway, until the film's climax. But it's quite predictable when Carl finally learns the all-important life lesson that it's much better to be empathetic than uncaring.<br /><br />'Up' is similar to Pixar's prior effort, \\"Wall-e', in that it takes too long to introduce the film's antagonist. In Wall-e, we spend a little too much time observing Wall-e as earth's last operable trash compactor. But even those activities prove to be far more interesting than the flying house in 'Up'. After about five minutes, the house with the balloons becomes tiresome; it's not a very clever idea to begin with and all the smashups as it makes it way to South America, prove to be more repetitious than Wall-e's penchant for turning mounds of junk into perfect cubes.<br /><br />When we finally meet up with the long lost \\"Man of Adventure', Charles Muntz, and we saw that Muntz was already probably 30 years old in the newsreel at the beginning of the film, then we must conclude Muntz would be at least 110 years old when he meets up with Carl. But he doesn't look a day older than 90! Muntz at least has a little more personality than Carl but he's much too mean a character for such a light-hearted story. For all parents who plan to take their young children to see 'Up', be forewarned: Muntz and his talking dogs are vicious and wholly inappropriate for your young children who will probably leave the movie theater quite scared and some even crying! The giant dodo-like bird, Kevin, is much more appropriate for the kids but when Muntz's pit bulls start attacking him in old-fashioned bi-planes (straight out of King Kong), the charm flies out the door.<br /><br />The film's denouement wouldn't have been so bad had the adventure in South America been a little more engaging. There were just too many scenes of Carl and Russell tethered to the house, huffing and puffing as they try to reach the illusory waterfalls along with the talking dogs. The rest of it was perfectly acceptable: Carl becomes the good guy, realizes that the reaching his goal was an illusion and bonds with Russell back home. The best part of the film are the closing credits which give us a sneak peak into Carl and Russell's life after their return to the 'ordinary world'.<br /><br />In the end, 'Up' is a tale of political correctness. Two outsiders, the elderly Carl and the obesity challenged Wilderness Explorer Russell, are able to not only defeat pure evil but overcome both the forces of nature and their own limitations. For Carl it's his self-pity and for Russell it's his lack of self-confidence. Ultimately 'Up' falls 'down' since it's all rather predictable stuff. Pixar has become complacent, simply resting on its laurels. There is only one direction Pixar can go from now on...and that is up!feat pure evil but overcome both the forces of nature and their own limitations.

1933771690|3.0|Reviewed By Stephen J. Hage  SteveH9697@aol.com        In this book, Lanza deals with some of the ideas presented by Samuel Avery in Transcendence of the Western Mind.      His central thesis is \\"life creates the universe instead of the other way around.\\"  And, while he doesn't use the word what his thesis supports is solipsism.    What makes this book both interesting and worth the effort of reading it; is the unique perspective Lanza brings to the subject matter as a physician.  Physicians are, by definition, intellectual chimeras because the discipline of medicine is an amalgam of hard science, healing, philosophy, metaphysics and ethics.  Each physician must decide what to take and use from that intellectual palette and the decisions they make, in that regard, to a  large extent define who they are, how they practice and what kind(s) of relationships they cultivate with patients and colleagues.  I know this because I worked with physicians for most of my adult life in hospitals.    From the way he chooses to present his arguments, it's clear he has a solid grasp of esoteric disciplines like quantum theory, special relativity and particle physics.  And what makes his presentation more compelling than other efforts I've encountered is his ability and willingness to weave personal experience into the thoughts and ideas presented.    His style is conversational and warm which tends to pull you along through the exposition gently.  And his sense of wonder and befuddlement at shop worn enigmas like the double slit experiment, Bell's theorem, non-locality and Schrödinger's cat is as infectious as it is delightful.    He reveals his bent toward solipsism in this passage where he talks about his friend Barbara in the chapter on consciousness:      \\"Every morning, she opens her front door to bring in the Boston Globe or to work in her garden.  She opens her back porch door to a lawn dotted with whirly-gigs, squeaking as they go round and round in the breeze.  She thinksthe world churns along whether she happens to open the door or not.     It does not affect her in the least that the kitchen disappears when she's in the bathroom.  That the garden and whirly-gigs evaporate when she's sleeping.  That the shop and all its tools don't exist while she's at the grocery store.\\"    What he says about Barbara is true and, because it's true, he leads the reader directly to the precipice of the abyss of solipsism.    Like it or not, solipsism is an epistemological nightmare.  Its premise is that everyone creates reality, on-the-fly.  Everything we see, touch, hear, smell or feel happens only in our head and not \\"out there\\" in the real world.  That's the reason solipsism is referred to as an abyss because the next logical and inescapable question is whose reality is it?  Is it yours or mine or someone else's?    The way out of that quagmire is to understand that solipsism obtains for perceptual consciousness only.  And, to truly appreciate what that means I recommend you also read Transcendence of the Western Mind.    I very much like what Lanza has to say in Biocentrism.  My only reservation is his failure to deal with the implications of how firmly his thesis embraces solipsism.

B001QBC4AG|5.0|When I originally wrote this review, Amazon did not have this version available so I placed the review under the Schm (or whatever it is) version so here it is.<br /><br />The collection contains both the original stereo and mono mixes of the album. This is not a repackage of the 1995 release even though a lot of the extras that appeared there are here but in a different mix. The mono mix might be of more interest for fans since it has not been available in the U.S. since 1967. There are subtle nuances in the mix overall, the music and the commercial jingles meld more seamlessly than its stereo counterpoint in such a way that it does feel like your listening to a pirate radio station. On \\"Our Love Was\\" the solo guitar break is completely different than the stereo version.<br /><br />The stereo mix is a re-mastered version of the original Kit Lambert mix from 1967 so any embellishments that John Astley did in 1995 are now gone. In addition \\"Rael\\" is also presented with its original mix as well as a re-recorded version on disc one. Apparently, the original tape was thrown in the trash and a nasty edit had to be made in the songs first line. This track was re-stored by John Astley on the \\"Maximum R&B\\" box set and on the 1995 re-issue.<br /><br />Another bonus is more of the PAMS jingles that were intended for the rest of the album in-between the extra tracks. There are also early mixes of other tracks as well as a few hidden ones so this pretty much surpasses the 1995 edition especially if you were not a fan of the work John Astley did in cleaning up the recording.<br /><br />This has to be one of The Who's best albums pre-Tommy and probably the last when they actually used a lot of those great vocal harmonies. Finally, a great re-issue of a great album. Oh, as a bonus there is a small re-print of the original poster that originally came with the album

B0010VD7EO|5.0|As a rock and roller I hate to fathom the idea of rock and roll being dead, but it is somewhat absent in a respectable level at this point in the music bizzz. Therefore, I'd rather think of it as being on vacation, while the modern trends in pop music get a chance to rule the land.<br /><br />At least some cats are doing it right. MGMT started to impress me when I first heard the single on the radio KIDS. It, like most of the album infuses a good amount of styles together and creates a groovy, space like feel. It took me a while to accept the fact that this album is not overated, as it thrives on it's own simplicity; but the fact is, this is a great record... even if the talents of the members of the group is questionable (a few sources have claimed to me that they suck the bag live...)<br /><br />Its a great merging of indie pop and dance pop, with lots of psychedelic feel. The group goes off the handle in nearly every track, taking the lyrics and atmosphere beyond the top, but it works on all accounts. My favorites are the dark, acid soaked track OF MOONS BIRDS AND MONSTERS, which includes both a ripping electric solo and a long mellow space setter at the end. ELECTRIC FEEL has a kind of an Electric Six feel to it. Club pop, with funky bass groove and the line \\"shock me like an electric eel.\\"  WEEKEND WARS is a mellow acoustic, beat rythym. Overall every song fits into the fold nicely, and though I would have hated to admit it for a long time, I agree with this as a five star album.  At least until rock and roll manages to find itself again. It's worth a shot. ROCK.
0385341008|3.0|Please be advised that this book can ambush those unsuspecting folks that think it will maintain the cozy atmosphere of the opening pages.  Yes, it is well-written and the characters are mostly lovable, but I felt occasionally betrayed by the continual intrusion of monstrous details about the German occupation of the island:  starvation of Todt prisoners, a concentration camp execution of a key figure, a graphic description of an islander killing and eating a cat, and more of the like. The reader is whip-sawed between the truly pleasurable stories of the literary group and the horror of the German occupation.  By the end I was depressed and horrified.  Was that the point?  I'm not sure, because the love story was endearing and the characters charming.  Maybe this is just modern writing. Maybe I should read reviews before I buy.

So I bought Rise and Fall and when I started listening to it I would swear some of these songs could come straight off of \\"Smash\\". And you know what? I didn't care. My head told me \\"Trust in you\\" sounded exactly like \\"Smash\\" (the song) but my heart said \\"I'm not a trendy ***hole!\\" and I turned it up. The nostalgia factor was huge for me here, suddenly I was back in high school in my basement rocking out to Offspring while playing Road Rash on my Genesis with my buddy. And the album kept on rockin.    That doesn't mean this is all old stuff. Production value is high, and there's about 3 songs that are a different style that throw a little modern variety in there (similar to Green Day's American Idiot). I am definitely not a genre nut (\\"I only like punk!\\") so I was happy to have a glimpse of Offspring's \\"softer\\" side.    Bottom line: If you like Offspring, you'll like this album.
B000063IQP|4.0|A fantastic bit of music. The type of music I would expect to float from an otherworldly temple rendered in an old 70's issue of Heavy Metal (illustrated fantasy) magazine. Long Live Den!!!  I purchased Exit as well, but MUCH perfer Atem. Very much worth the dime.
B001ILFUDC|4.0|It has been so long since I last saw this movie. I distinctly could remeber Pinocchio's family, the puppet master, pleasure island & the boys turning into donkeys then the whale. But I forgot all the happenings that occured on pleasure island, the smoking & drinking made me laugh when I watched this movie again.Definitely a keepsake & just upset it took them so long to release it on DVD.
B001GCUNYO|5.0|There have been too many TV shows and movies that portray the American Dad as in infantile, klutzy, dumber-than-the-Mom, idiot.  Finally a classy, interesting and exciting movie about a competent, resourceful and smarter-than-Mom  ---- Father. Yeah, yeah, I know the main character (Liam Neeson) does have a rather unusual American accent - perhaps he's originally from NY.  LOL Whatever.<br /><br />My guess is mainstream media critics (which I don't read or pay attention to) probably trashed this movie, for 2 reasons.  1.  The Dad is smart and awesome and 2.  some of the bad guys (but not all) are apparently/possibly Arab/Muslim.  Just one of these elements in a movie will usually be enough to warrant a bad review.<br /><br />This was a really wonderful movie.  My eyes were welling up with tears at the end.<br /><br />The BluRay Transfer was crystal clear. I wanted to see this in the theater but I missed it. BluRay is the next best thing.
B000XUOIQ4|4.0|I found this at Walmart a few weeks back & it wasn't the proud price of $19.99 it was clearanced down to $13. I usually hold out & see if there are cheaper prices through Amazon to purchase such expensive movies. But to have this movie brand new & they day I saw it was awesome. All the animal characters are great enrichment to this classic film.
1595141979|3.0|First off... I thought the first book was a little boring, but found the second to be really good. The third one is extremely entertaining all the way through and I was excited that this had turned out to be a really great series. I couldn't put the book down, it was that good.    Then it happened. BAM! One of the main characters is gone????    How do you spend three books drilling it into our heads that there is no other person for her except :bleep:...    That there is no light at the end of the tunnel  without :bleep:...    That her life is not worth living without :bleep:...     That she would go CRAZY without :bleep:...    And then you do the worst thing you could possibly do to :bleep:??? Gahhhhhh! Richelle Mead, I hate to say this, but shame on you. Bad author, badddd *shakes finger*... Why would you take :bleep: away from us? :P    I really, really loved this series but the ending of this book was so sad and disappointing that I don't know if I can get through the next one... I dread sitting through what Rose is going off to do in the 4th book. I imagine curiosity will get the best of me and I will have to read it. But if this next book is even more depressing than the end of Book 3, I don't think I will be able to handle anymore. :(

0743277465|2.0|If you're interested in gaining insight into the mind of a child chess prodigy turned adult martial arts champion, this is a decent book. It's reasonably readable and has a lot of interesting stories about the author's chess and marital arts careers. As an inspirational or how-to book, though, it falls short. Maybe it would be helpful if you're interested in single-minded, highly-focused training in chess, martial arts, or another highly technical, subtle, and competitive pursuit. But, despite his claims that his road map for learning can be applied to any discipline, the author is unable to illustrate his ideas with examples from outside his own two fields. He also does a poor job of pulling the ideas together into specific, actionable advice. Instead, he goes on at length about the philosophy and abstract principles and how they helped him achieve his chess and martial arts goals. I kept reading, hoping it would get better, but it never did. Overall, a disappointment.
B000LT2IHI|2.0|First off, this thing was particularly difficult to assemble, even by the standards of children's toys.  The guide holes that the screws insert into don't line up properly without some good bending & twisting of the plastic.  Since no one else has mentioned this, it may be that there was a manufacturing flaw in the unit we got.<br /><br />As for the toy itself, I agree with others: the balls stick more often than they should, and the toy isn't as stable as it ought to be.  Most importantly, our 10-month-old got bored pretty quickly.<br /><br />Also it's curious that there is a \\"under 3\\" small parts warning on the product description, when the product is designed for 9 months and up.<br /><br />All in all, I'd say give it a pass, there are much better things out there from Fisher-Price and others.

But to be fair I have to say that this is the only album of Mike Oldfield that I have heard and I have to say I was impressed with this album and that is why I have decided to purchased other albums.  I figure if this one is as good as it is to me the others most be just as excellent.
0312427999|5.0|My first reaction after swallowing the volume was: \\"my life will never be the same after reading this\\".    \\"The Shock Doctrine\\" is a tremendous achievement providing a bird's eye view of the past 40 years of global political economic strife. It may have its omissions, misinterpretations and jumps to conclusions just as any grand narrative account would.     It will be up to the reader to take it at its face value, to critically examine it, or start acting because of or against it. I believe it is a rare opportunity to have such a massive overview from which to start working, whatever your ultimate destination may be. Even if at the end only 10% of the content ends up fitting your personal world view, or surviving further scrutiny, the ride will have been invaluable. This is the true value of any successful attempt at providing a grand narrative.    I will probably feel forever indebted to Klein for providing me a new map and a new lens to work with.

0307346617|4.0|I'm a big fan of Tom Clancy's ultra-realistic writing style, particularly Red Storm Rising.  World War Z was written similarly, which really helps bring the subject to \\"life\\" (or \\"undeath\\"...).  If you want a character driven thriller, go somewhere else.  This book reads like a history using mostly interviews with survivors a la Band of Brothers.  I read both this book and the Zombie Survival Guide, and enjoyed them both.

B001AQO3Z6|5.0|Koyaanisqatsi is a masterpiece meant to be viewed in high definition.  This is what I've been waiting for since I purchased a high definition tv and a blu-ray player.  Make me proud amazon.  Let's fast track this bad boy.
B001TOD9VI|5.0|The Wrestler.  This is a tough movie to review for me. I saw it last night, and I'm still kind of digesting it. Maybe I should wait til I've seen it again before reviewing it, but what the hell, I'll write up my thoughts on the movie now, and see how they change with time.    Randy 'The Ram' Robinson was at the top of the wrestling world (we learn this during the opening credits), 20 years later, he is broke and wrestling at YMCA's and anywhere else they'll have him. It's a movie about a man that can't let go of his past, a man who is always one match away from regaining his former glory, a man who has ****ed up everything he's ever had....because wrestling is all he knows. He's only truly comfortable in the ring, and the movie is as much about his ring persona as it is about him trying find something in the real world to latch onto.     Randy is a regular at a strip joint where he befriends a stripper named Cassidy (Marisa Tomei), and after suffering a setback after a match, she urges him to reconnect with his estranged daughter Stephanie (Evan Rachel Wood). Randy's a good guy at heart, and as the film progresses, I really felt bad for the guy as you watch him try so hard to do the right thing, yet constantly **** it up....whether it is his relationship with his daughter, or attempting to turn his \\"stripper/client\\" relationship into something more.    Like I pointed out earlier, the movie is split fairly evenly between his wrestling life and his home life. Besides his daughter and the stripper, Randy is trying to make it with a normal job and some of the movie's funniest scenes come out of this. On the wrestling side, Randy is offered a dream gig; a rematch of his greatest match from his glory days. Randy's convinced that this is the shot he needs to make it back into the limelight, but what is he willing to sacrifice to fulfill that dream?    Overall, the movie is just fantastic. It's brutally honest and violent and emotional and almost feels like a documentary. All actors are pitch perfect in their rolls. This isn't a movie for only wrestling fans, so please don't let that stop you from seeing it. If you are anything like me, I have a feeling you'll be engrossed by the end of the movie. Which brings me to my only real gripe.....the ending. When the movie ended I felt jipped. I was angry that something I was enjoying so much would end like that. I was also a bit confused (mostly because it was so unexpected). Given time to think about it, I can appreciate the ending a bit more and I might even be leaning towards loving it. I am also fairly certain I understand what happened now(but I won't discuss that in a review). Also, I feel like Bruce Springsteen's song at the end IS part of the movie....it's not just a filler song to play over the credits, it just sums everything perfectly.  The movie is called The Wrestler... and it's pretty damn good.    A
B0025X4P56|5.0|E is back, sporting a ZZ Top beard and a new wolf-man persona.  It's been 5 long years since his last proper album, a somber and inward-focused double-CD set entitled \\"Blinking Lights and Other Revelations.\\"  As is typical for Mr. E, quieter albums tend to be followed by noisier ones.  However, no matter what ideas E is trying on for size, everything he records is stamped with his unique and compelling persona.  This one is no exception.<br /><br />Sometimes wearing a mask allows us the freedom to show a side of ourselves that we might otherwise be afraid to reveal.  Here, E has assumed a persona of sorts, which differs from anything his audience has seen to date.  He's a lusty, swaggering wolfman, carrying a cane and prowling the night.  This assumed role seems to allow him to project a confidence unheard in much of his material, displayed most clearly on the opening track \\"Prizefighter\\" and the single \\"Fresh Blood.\\"  But what makes this album most compelling is when E drops the guise and reveals his true insecurities, as on \\"The Look You Give That Guy.\\"  That dichotomy makes this wolfman seem all the more human, for beneath the fuzz and fangs still lies a fundamentally reflective and at times insecure person.<br /><br />The conceptual aspect of this disc is fun and meaningful, but never threatens to overwhelm the content.  Song-for-song, this is one of E's best collections.  Almost every one of these tracks could stand on its own as a single.  The stripped-down sound that E has featured on some of his rawer albums (Souljacker, for example) is in full effect and really works in E's favor.  Overall the man sounds energized, mature and confident, always with something interesting and often poignant to say.<br /><br />E remains the consummate cult artist, and in many ways it's not surprising.  His unflinching portraits of insecurity and emotion take some getting used to, especially in the current musical climate.  Each project he records is something unique and interesting.  This is one of his best to date.his best to date.

B001U7FWM8|4.0|\\"Veckatimest\\" might not be the greatest record of all time, like so many reviewers before me have so lovingly proclaimed, but it is indeed groundbreaking on so many levels. It is a relief that in a year where Animal Collective's \\"Merriweather Post Pavilion\\" was being hailed as the Album of the Year, here comes a set of tunes that blow that set out the water. In many ways, this reminds you of Radioheads' \\"In Rainbows\\", but it is slightly better, only because of the use of the Enya-esque choral sections that take center stage in most songs.<br /><br />For new listeners, Grizzly Bear makes acoustic rock music that is recorded in a very 'lo-fi' style. This often makes many of their songs sound like very personal demos, but on this album, the production is a little fuller and definitely more controlled. Each song has been polished and dressed up in multiple layers of instrumentation and vocal textures, all of which actually work. So many of these songs deal with love, loss, desperation and solitude, but the tempo is very much middle-of-the-road and seldom (if never) veers into more upbeat territory. This isn't a very happy sounding album, but then again, it isn't as slow or plodding as Bon Iver's \\"For Emma, Forever Ago\\".<br /><br />What is especially endearing about this album is that the singers aren't actually great vocalists but they do what they can. On many occasions they dare to sound off-key (primarily on \\"Dory\\") and many tracks meander and wade through sonic landscapes without any real direction. In many ways, this sounds like a lost 1970s record, with elements of Laury Nyro popping up every now and then as well. However, there are many downsides to this record, as many as there are positives.<br /><br />First, this is one of those 'investment' records that absolutely require repeated listening. Also, many of the words aren't pronounced very audibly or coherently, so you might need a lyric sheet to assist you. Third, too many of these songs have been scrubbed into sounding way too 'precious'. This is primarily visible on the first track and the song \\"Ready, Able\\", which I felt took itself way too seriously. Many music listeners may find that the record seems far too vain and presumptious and 'full of itself', and this is in part true. Having being anointed Indie Royalty, Grizzly Bear now comes with a heavy dose of attitude, and I'm not sure what I feel about this - the only real problem I have with it is that it has started showing up in the music. Anytime a band display Coldplay-like 'epic' string sections, I believe theyre in trouble.<br /><br />I could also somewhat compare this to Death Cab for Cutie's \\"Narrow Stairs\\" album, though of course both records sound markedly different. That was an album where I felt the band has given up their indie stylings for something a little more mainstream, and I couldn't help but feel that with this record as well. Songs such as \\"About Face\\", which evoke a sunny 1960s Sunday, often feel a little too forced, but this is a minor quibble. \\"While You Wait for the Others\\" is perhaps the albums' most peppy moment - rock elements flourish here, and its a fine reminder of the various genres of music incorporated here.<br /><br />Some clunkers do miss their mark - the striving-for-greatness \\"I Live with You\\" is a superb example of how a band that stretches itself beyond their current capacities could either make the song or kill it. In this case, it runs both ways. The song is a glorious mess, cymbals and guitars and drums clash madly in some hideous psychedlica-stained environment, but it doesn't all work. Its beautiful, but would I want to listen to it again?<br /><br />However, when Grizzly Bear stick to their formula of harmonious singing coupled with those choral sections, they absolutely soar. They can do no wrong on songs such as the album closer \\"Foreground\\". The opening track, on the other hand, doesn't quite make for a striking premiere track, but it seems to be a fan favorite, so perhaps I'm missing something.<br /><br />So is \\"Veckatimest\\" a classic? Well, not yet. One would have to live with it for a while to discover if it urges you to play it again and again. Many so-called 'masterpiece' albums are barely listenable (Sigur Ros comes to mind - I could never sit through their albums), and Grizzly Bear is currently riding a popularity wave that could possibly be a bit too unmerited, considering they haven't really produced anything close to an epic. But this CD is a fine addition to their catalog, a step in the right direction, and when it works, it really, really works.<br /><br />Don't believe the hype. And don't listen to samples (they barely give you a taste of the album). Get the record and decide for yourself - this is a fantastic album, and many independent music fans might not be able to relate to it, but thats alright. It does have many noticeable flaws and the songs bunched together seem oddly morose and even insipid at times, but it some strange way, it all works.<br /><br />Three and a Half Stars.est\\" a classic?

B001VLXNLU|5.0|I love this entire book series, It's as good as the Vampire Academy ones.  You will love the spunky lead characters and the adventures.   My only complaint in this series is she Zoey is a bit of a slut lol she goes from one guy to another and can't make her mind up, so it's hard to believe any of the romance in the book cuz two seconds later she's thinking of someone else.    But I love the books anyway!
B00079FUI6|5.0|I love this show.I had never watched it before.I decided to buy all 4 seasons.I am very glad I did.I did not know what a great show I was missing.It has everything you could ask for in a tv series.I would have been watching sooner if I knew what I had been missing.Great people you can relate to and really grow to care about them.I will enjoy watching every episode.Will be purchasing season 5 as soon as it is released.Anyone who has not seen this show,really,you have no idea what your missing.
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|Simply amazing it is! Sure it doesn't come with the FFXIII demo like the japanese verson but the quality and new added scenes in the movie make this REALLY complete.     I'm not left hanging like the original Advent Children when it came out back in '05.    STUNNING in 1080p! A must have for any FFVII fan!    It even comes with a 30 minute anime feature of Denzel's past.
B0025X4P56|5.0|Eels is a great band, and it has been since before it even WAS a band (I'm referring, of course, to E's two solo albums before forming the group). E has always balanced his edgy side with a gentler, softer aspect, composing songs like small trinkets or snapshots. My favorites are \\"Electro-Shock Blues,\\" a masterpiece of mourning, and \\"Souljacker,\\" in which E indulged his more grotesque inclinations. Hombre Lobo merges the best of both worlds.<br /><br />One of the great things about Eels is that even when rocking out with heavily distorted guitars, as in \\"Lilac Breeze,\\" they never lose their sense of melody. There's a real love of songcraft here, not to mention a mastery of the recording studio. Studio trickery never overwhelms the songs - and the songs are never lacking for the right accompaniment (notice the explosive chorus of \\"Tremendous Dynamite.\\")<br /><br />It's too soon to tell (and doesn't really matter) how this will rank amongst Eels's other cds, but one thing's for sure: this is the perfect Eels album for 2009, and a great addition to an already stunning catalog.
B00005JLSE|1.0|Zero Star.  Nothing redeemable here. Bad people behaving, singing, and dancing badly and getting away with it on film, in the box-office, and with the Academy.  It is slick...but so, too, is a scum-film on an aeration pond in a sewage treatment facility. Regarding this putrescent bio-layer; flush it.
0761129235|5.0|I liked this book very much because this year, my resolution was to make daily progress in small steps and this is exactly what this book talks about, explaining it in a bit more scientific language than I did to myself.  Packed with real-life stories, I think it is a book that will be helpful for anyone wanting to effect change in his or her life and from the examples given, it works for big companies too!  I love it and will definitely read it over and over again.
B000JLSM00|1.0|Finally, this convoluted film makes sense...<br /><br />Ethan's five year search was not, primarily, for his niece (more accurately his daughter; consider the bedroom-eyes between Ethan and Martha Edwards, and Aaron's awareness of the escaping pheromones--->that's why Aaron shoves precious Debbie out the window but keeps the other two kids with him). But, I digress.<br />Ethan had no intention of performing an 'honor killing'. He was on a more profound quest. He sensed that time was fickle.<br /><br />Look carefully at Chapter 30...you will see an automobile driving along the river road behind the troops fording the frozen stream. Note, also, the backhoe tracks in the snow (plowed trail and the mounds of ice). Ethan quietly noticed all of this, and more. The Brazos River blurring into the San Juan; flowing one way, then 'tuther'...or Texas morphing into Monument Valley. Or riding like hell for years only to end up a half mile from Edwards' cabin. Materializing Navajo blanket on the hitching-post in the opening scene. The sun's erratic motion. Look's/Martin's 'honeymoon/divorce' camp beside the reservoir, only a few hundred yards from Jorgensen's future ranch house. Laurie's red label Levis. Consider the way the Navajo-speaking Comanches decamped and re-camped in the twinkling of an eye in the final battle. These are but a few of the reasons Ethan looks so angry, perplexed and confused throughout the film...People, objects, buttes and mesas were materializing and de-materializing right before his eyes from the opening scenes. Nothing made sense.<br />Unfortunately, Ethan's collaborations with not-yet-conceived physicist Hermann Weyl were cut by the film's editor. What was he really searching for?<br /><br />Exigent Ethan was 'searching' for wormholes...gates through which he could rearrange the family's tree, and his place beside Martha. What was Ethan doing during the three \\"lost\\" years? Studying holes. They were scattered all over the place. Scar, obviously not ofNative American descent, was a pharaohic high priest of the Ancient Mysteries. Alas, Aaron's pesky adopted son kills him. It is Sca'R of Thebes who Ethan sought. He would have to find another initiate. Five years utterly wasted. Wasted! Perhaps Debbie knows...perhaps she possesses a key. She must survive.<br /><br />Why does Ethan turn and stumble away from the reunion in the final act? He knows something they don't, and he knows he cannot tell them. All of the cows and horses that were beside the water, which they had just ridden past, have up and disappeared.<br /><br />Classic sci-fi masterpiece. Remarkably ahead of its time, subtle and universally misunderstood.

0307341569|5.0|Libby Day is an adult now, but her life has been shaped and twisted by the bloody murders of her mother and sisters 24 years ago. Libby, who was seven at the time, escaped from her home during the massacre, hiding in the forest. She lost some toes and part of a finger from frostbite --- the very least of her losses that night. At seven, she testified against her brother, Ben, who is incarcerated for life.    As a child, Libby lived with her aunt and other assorted relatives. Now she resides in a rental she cares nothing about, in a neighborhood she calls \\"Over There That Way.\\" Her long-term depression is augmented by the fact that she is running out of the money she inherited when she turned 18, cash that was donated by people moved by the plucky survivor \\"Baby Day\\" and then invested for her. Libby knows she is not able to work, so when she receives an invitation from a man named Lyle who offers to pay for her to show up at his club meeting, she calls him.    Lyle's group is obsessed with true crimes, including the slaughter of the Days. Libby is instantly on guard, as she knows many believe Ben did not murder their mother and sisters. These people, mostly women, are rabid fans of Ben and have screamed at Libby, insisting that her long-ago testimony was forced on her. Although she wavers, not wanting to subject herself to more of this kind of abuse, Lyle's offer to pay her $700 plus the opportunity to sell \\"souvenirs,\\" such as family letters, persuades her to attend. While the meeting is extremely uncomfortable for Libby, she is struck by the club members' conviction that Ben is innocent and that their worthless father, Runner Day, is the guilty party.    When Libby gets home, she can't help but remember all that happened the night of the murders. She wonders if her certainty about her brother's guilt could possibly be wrong. Why, for example, when she was hiding from him in the woods, did Ben yell for her to stay where she was? Libby is pulled further into investigating her family and the murders when Lyle's group bribes her to visit her brother in prison.    In alternating chapters, we follow Libby's quest today and learn of the lives of various key people during the time leading up to the murders. These characters are fully realized --- so true they could step off the page. Libby is a horribly flawed yet sympathetic protagonist. Grim foreboding pervades the story as readers are tantalized with zigzagging clues from now and from 1985. Those hints of what truly happened to the Day family feel painfully, teasingly paced as they forge an irresistible trail to the truth of what happened that night.    This sad, violent, sometimes disheartening tale is the opposite of a feel-good read (although not without its share of rich satisfaction and hard-won redemption). It is, however, tremendously compelling. I devoured the book in a 12-hour span: Could. Not. Stop. Reading. Although some might wonder if too much action could coincidentally take place in one short period, others may well realize that bizarre concurrences do happen in real life, too.        --- Reviewed by Terry Miller Shannon

B001PPLIFU|2.0|I'll give it this: the Blu-Ray presentation of this film is beautiful to look at and listen to. But the movie itself? I'm having a problem with the last couple Bond flicks: with each subsequent movie, they become more and more difficult to understand or make sense of. This one left me completely in the dark. By the end of this film, I still didn't understand who the bad guy was or what he had done, or why, I couldn't make heads or tails of the bad guy's ultimate goal, who was working for who, or why anything was happening at all.  I think in trying to make a thinking-man's action movie, the Bond franchise has gone over the top and now makes movies that it takes a phd in quantum physics to understand.  I'm done.  No more bond.
B001WCN232|4.0|Perspective: The Stones are my favorite band, Exile is their best album, and when it was released in 1973, I was agast at what a total piece of crap Goats Head Soup (GHS) was coming on the heels of Exile.    But that was then, when I was blinded by the sheer brilliance of Exile.      In the years since, I have come to realize that rather then repeat themselves, the Stones created a different kind of masterpiece with GHS, an almost anti-exile: more openly melodic, quieter and more pristine, less obsessed with decadence, though a Stones record still through and through...if you open your ears to it.    I now think of this as one of their great albums and a much better collection of songs then Some Girls, which some think is truly the band's last great album.    Among GHS's delights: Angie, arguably their finest single; Hide Your Love, an irresistably catchy and funky tune that showcases why Mick Taylor was such a great addition to the band; Heartbreaker and Star Star, two of the band's best rockers; the gorgeous Winter; and the almost poppy 100 years ago.    Even the lesser songs have grown on me.  They will on you too.      Enjoy it!

0525951113|4.0|\\"Daemon\\" starts out as a high-tech thriller with characters well developed early on in the book. It continues on a roller coaster ride with many twists and turns as a computer program unleashed by a dead genius begins to wreak havoc on anybody who opposes the will of its now deceased creator. As this novel roars along on its high-tech ride you will begin to develop a feeling that the hero may not save the day, and you will be correct.<br /><br />As \\"Daemon\\" nears its conclusion you will be left with a vision of the future that may be a mixture of George Orwell's \\"1984\\" and aspects of the \\"Terminator\\" series whereby society is controlled by mindless machines programmed to destroy those people who oppose them.<br /><br />The ending of this book certainly sets up the expectation of future novels from the author in what may be a vision of mankind's struggle to be the master of its own destiny.
1582701709|1.0|One of the most stupid books I´ve ever (almost) read.   There is something you can´t deny: good publicity campaign. An empty promise otherwise. Nothing new or secret about the secret. The whole concept is plain common sense, you are indeed responsible for your life and you should be very careful with what you wish or are afraid of because both have a tendency to become part of your reality. But the way this book, with all those false \\"doctors\\" and \\"authorities\\" (like Joe Vitale) put it is just plain Disneyland: \\"Think happy thoughts and you will fly\\". And the focus is extremely materialistic and narcissistic. If you want to read about the same thing in a compassionate, deeper, almost poetic style, I recomend you Creative Mind and Success by Ernest Holmes.
B000AP04OM|5.0|It's hard to write a review that would add to the long list of existing reviews, but i'd like to add one thing.   My 6 year old daughter loves this movie.  She sings the songs and copies the dances and just adores the whole thing.  What more could you ask from a movie.    5 stars.
B0026PMN70|5.0|I have not bothered to write a review in minute.  Lee Fields and the Expressions have created a time-capsule masterpiece that will definitely be reaching the hearts of all the hopeless romantics.  Honey Dove is my personal favorite.  I threw it on at a party and had everybody in the house like WHAT?!?  Hopefully, this cat will not be missed at the Grammys.  One thing I need to add is that Lee Fields sounds nothing like James Brown.  I keep hearing people make the comparison and there just isn't one.  Keep an eye out for Mayer Hawthorne, too.

B001YYQ9SS|5.0|In 2005, fans of the Square Enix Sony PlayStation video game \\"Final Fantasy VII\\" were excited when a new CG film was released and that video games based on the characters would follow.  The film was well received by fans of the video game but was not received well by critics who were not well versed with \\"Final Fantasy VII\\" or the games that have come out afterward.<br /><br />The DVD release in 2006 was successful as it became the first direct-to-DVD film to sell over a million copies, in fact worldwide sales were over 2.4 million copies.<br /><br />But a lot has chanced since 2005.  In fact, more backstory to \\"Final Fantasy VII\\" has been fleshed out with the release with an anime OAV series titled \\"Last Order\\",  of a mobile game (not released in the US) titled \\"Before Crisis: Final Fantasy VII\\", \\"Dirge of Cerberus: Final Fantasy VII\\" for the PS2, \\"Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII\\" for the Sony PSP.<br /><br />Here we are with \\"Final Fantasy VII Advent Children Complete\\".  Despite being announced at the Tokyo Game Show in 2006 for a Blu-ray release, Square Enix postponed the release until 2009.  The main difference is that this film would feature 26 minutes of new footage and over 1,000 revised scenes.  Although the Blu-ray scene in Japan has been slow compared to other countries in terms of copies sold,  the release of FF7:ACC sold over 100,000 copies in its first day, the highest selling Blu-ray in Japan was \\"Macross F\\" which sold over 34,000 in 2008.<br /><br />For the fans who played the video games that came after 2005, especially the Sony PSP video game \\"Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII\\", it furthers the fan's appreciation of this film.  In fact, the new footage actually makes the film much more coherent and enjoyable.  But like the original release of \\"Advent Children\\", if one had no interest in the video game to begin with, nor have they had a vested interest in the \\"Final Fantasy VII\\" video game series, they probably still won't get it.  But as a person who has played the games (with the exception of \\"Before Crisis\\"), I felt that \\"FINAL FANTASY VII: ADVENT CHILDREN COMPLETE\\" was much more enjoyable this time around.<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />\\"FINAL FANTASY VII: ADVENT CHILDREN COMPLETE\\" is featured in 1080p High Definition (aspect ratio of 1:78:1).  When the film was released in 2005, the animation was realistic and just awesome to look at.  The animation still holds up four years later but part of the problem is that the video is upconverted.  The extra 30 minutes is pretty much all throughout the film but for those with a keen eye, you can tell which piece looks upconverted and which doesn't.  The newer scenes are much crisper and sharper.  But for the most part, depending on your TV, many people probably will not know the difference on the Blu-ray but comparing to the DVD, the image quality is of course, much, much better.<br /><br />There are a lot of details in the newer scenes from books, papers scattered on the shelves.  You will now see dirt and grime on the people getting into the fights.  You will also see more footage of people around Midgar, more to the buildings and destruction around the city and just more additional footage that made the film much better.  Scenes and backgrounds come out quite clearly on the video that even scenes where characters are looking out windows, you can see the backgrounds through the windows much clearer.<br /><br />I also want to add that there were certain scenes that displayed white speckles.  Although I didn't see compression artifacts, I was surprised to see this a few times in the video but very few times. Overall, picture quality was very good.<br /><br />The audio features a lossless track with an English, Japanese and French Dolby TrueHD 5.1 track (note: The Japanese version does not have the French audio track nor does it contain the English subtitles).  To be truthful, I was hoping the sound would be much immersive and that there would be full utilization of audio throughout all channels but FF7:ACC was more front channel heavy with occasional panning of sound but I didn't hear any low level frequency bass coming out of my subwoofer, nor did I really hear anything coming out throughout my rear surrounds.  But the dialogue, the awesome music and action scenes with swords clanging and destruction of buildings do come out quite clearly through your front and center channel speakers.<br /><br />Also, when it comes to voice acting both Japanese and English are well done.  Square Enix really went all out by having actresses Mena Suvari and Rachael Leigh Cook to lend their voices to the characters but overall, both audio tracks were well done.  If anything, I tend to prefer the Tifa \\"tsuru tsuru tsuru tsuru\\" than the \\"dilly dally shilly shally\\" but overall, I enjoyed both.  I did not watch the film with the French dub track though.<br /><br />As for subtitles, the Blu-ray features English, English SDH, French, Portuguese, Spanish, Chinese (Traditional), Chinese (Simplified), Korean, Thai, Arabic and Dutch.  The Japanese version only features Japanese subtitles.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"FINAL FANTASY VII: ADVENT CHILDREN COMPLETE\\" includes a good number of special features.  Included are:<br /><br />  * Legacy of Final Fantasy - (6:37) This featurette features a quick history of the \\"Final Fantasy\\" video games and then leads up to the screening at the Venice International Film Festival, discussion of how the DVD sold over a million copies in Japan, 3.6 worldwide which is unprecedented for a direct-to-video release.  And also the release of this latest Blu-ray release which features nearly 30 minutes of extra footage and 1,000 revised scenes.<br />  * Reminiscence of Final Fantasy VII - (23:55) A featurette/digest that features the replaying of the story of \\"Final Fantasy VII\\" from the Sony PlayStation.  For those who haven't played the video game or it has been too many years that has passed by since you did play the game, this is a good refresher on the original video game.<br />  * Reminiscence of Final Fantasy VII Compilation - (29:43) Where the original digest featured \\"Final Fantasy VII\\", this time the stories from \\"Beginning Crisis\\", \\"Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII\\" and \\"Dirge of Cerberus\\" are featured.  So, if you never played any of these three video games, you can watch this featurette and learn about the Turks, the relation between Zack and Cloud and also how the FF7 group especially Vincent have started assisting the World Regenesis Organization (WRO).<br />  * On the Way to a Smile - Episode: Denzel - (28:04) The following anime OAV takes place right after \\"Advent Children\\" and focuses on the orphan Denzel who is inspired by Cloud and his friends to be a member of the WRO.  Denzel shares his story about his family and then living in the slums but most importantly information on how the disease Geostigma started to affect the people of Midgar and how quickly it spread and how people started to die.<br />  * Exclusive Sneak Peak at Final Fantasy XIII - (7:12) A sneak peak of the upcoming \\"Final Fantasy\\" PlayStation 3/XBOX 360 video game.<br />  * Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children Complete Trailers - A total of five trailers.  The original teaser trailers for Advent Children and the teaser trailer for \\"Advent Children Complete\\".<br /><br />In Japan, a playable demo for \\"Final Fantasy XIII\\" was offered.  Also, the Blu-ray came in a black Blu-ray case.  In the US, the version comes with a slip case and in the standard blue Blu-ray case.  Since \\"Final Fantasy\\" games in the US tend to come out nearly a year and more later after the Japanese release, it was expected that there would not be a playable demo of the game with this release.  Both the Japanese and the US release do not contain the 2005 anime OAV \\"Last Order: Final Fantasy VII\\" which was included in the \\"Ultimate Edition\\" DVD release for \\"Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children\\" back in the Fall of 2005.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />When \\"ADVENT CRISIS\\" was released, I truly found the release to be action-packed and visually, incredible.  From the facial mannerisms of each character, to the details of each character model including the buildings and the roads.  So, much went into this project of creating a side of realism with the character models.  It was amazing what \\"Final Fantasy: Spirits Within\\" was able to achieve in CG back then but to see how far it has evolved with \\"Advent Children\\" and the fact that unlike the previous \\"Final Fantasy\\" film, there was now an emotional attachment previously from the FF7 video game and now to this film.<br /><br />But where the original film seemed like eye candy and action-packed sequences that were a definite nod to the fans who enjoyed the series, the release of \\"FINAL FANTASY VII: ADVENT CHILDREN COMPLETE\\" is much more satisfying as the storyline seems much more coherent now than before.  Also, since the release of the original Advent Children, there have been additional FF7 video games that gave us more storyline of things behind-the-scenes with the SOLDIER program and most of all, the relationship between Sephiroth, Cloud and Zack.<br /><br />After finishing \\"Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII\\", the video game gave me a stronger understanding of why Sephiroth became this madman bent on destruction but most of all, why Cloud kept thinking about his old friend and why he fights with his sword.  Many questions answered in these last three years from the video games that makes things much more easier this time around when watching \\"Advent Children Complete\\".<br /><br />With the release of \\"FINAL FANTASY VII: ADVENT CHILDREN COMPLETE\\", with how much time I have invested in the \\"Final Fantasy\\" video games but specifically the FF7 releases, I found watching the film this time around, much more enjoyable.  I found myself noticing mannerisms in the face of Tifa and the children, Cloud's conflicted emotions with having the Geostigma disease and just small details which I never took noticed before until now.<br /><br />This is more than a re-release to Blu-ray but an enhancement of the original release.  Many of you are wondering if you own it on DVD, is it worth the double dip.  The answer is YES!  It really is worth purchasing on Blu-ray.  Newer storyline, newer features but it's not going to change non-FF7 fans or those not at all familiar with the series to enjoy it.  But for those who truly enjoy \\"Final Fantasy VII\\", have played the recent releases and want a much better version of the film than what we bought back in 2006, then \\"FINAL FANTASY VII: ADVENT CHILDREN COMPLETE\\" is highly recommended!Compilation - (29:43) Where the original digest featured \\"Final Fantasy VII\\", this time the stories from \\"Beginning Crisis\\", \\"Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII\\" and \\"Dirge of Cerberus\\" are featured.

B000X1Z0BU|5.0|Great songs and a fun story that has romance, but isn't overly so.  It isn't a \\"chick flick\\".  It's also funny at times too.  It's part drama, part comedy, part romance, part inspiration about pursuing your dreams.    Get the movie and and the album!
B0020EK4QY|5.0|In the Summer of 1997, audiences were treated with another action film from Harrison Ford.  During the 1990's, Ford has made quite a number of successful action films but his performance in \\"AIR FORCE ONE\\" was truly an example that this Hollywood veteran still had what it takes to be an action star.<br /><br />The film was directed by well-known action director Wolfgang Petersen (\\"The Perfect Storm\\", \\"Troy\\", \\"Outbreak\\", \\"Das Boot\\"), music by well-known composer Jerry Goldsmith (\\"Rambo\\", \\"Star Trek: First Contact\\", \\"Star Trek: The Next Generation\\",  \\"Basic Instinct\\") and Director of Photography by Michael Ballhaus (\\"Gangs of New York\\", \\"The Departed\\", \\"Wild Wild West\\").<br /><br />The film was received positively by critics and a success in the box office as it brought in over $315 million worldwide.  \\"AIR FORCE ONE\\" even received attention from President Bill Clinton who enjoyed the film and watched it twice.  The film would go on to receive two Academy Award nominations for \\"Best Film Editing\\" and \\"Best Sound\\".<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />\\"AIR FORCE ONE\\" features a pretty solid transfer on Blu-ray.  Video is presented in 1080p High Definition (aspect ration of 2:40:1) and one thing that I will make clear is that while many films featured in the 90's tend to have a DNR, clean, waxy or soft effect in terms of picture quality, the good news is that \\"AIR FORCE ONE\\" does not.<br /><br />In fact, there are scenes where the detail comes out quite nicely.  But if there was one thing that the Blu-ray High Definition transfer does happen to bring out is the amount of grain.  But I would rather take a transfer full of grain than the soft, waxy DNR look any day.  And I am so happy that Sony Pictures Home Entertainment decided to feature \\"AIR FORCE ONE\\" with a good HD transfer of the film.<br /><br />As for the audio, I have one word and that is \\"magnificent\\".<br /><br />\\"AIR FORCE ONE\\" has one of the most impressive soundtracks that I have heard from a 1990's film.  The soundtrack just sounds absolutely wonderful on English Dolby TrueHD 5.1 (the film is also featured in French Dolby TrueHD 5.1).<br /><br />The film features a high number of action scenes and gunfire, music, mechanical sounds from the vehicles, jet engines flying, helicopter rotors spinning, it would seem that so much was put into the emphasis of having a wonderful soundtrack that \\"AIR FORCE ONE\\" truly delivers. And these are not short bursts of audio, there are plenty of scenes that utilize this explosive audio throughout the film.<br /><br />I was absolutely in awe of how all the speakers were being utilized, especially my surround channels  and I also noticed a few times where my subwoofer would utilize low frequency sounds.  \\"AIR FORCE ONE\\" is an action thriller that truly delivers with its audio that I can say that this is one of the better sounding action thrillers from the 1990's that just shines on Blu-ray.  And just to think that this film is 12 years old.  I was absolutely thrilled by the audio quality of the film.<br /><br />As for subtitles, the film is presented in English, English SDH and French.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"AIR FORCE ONE\\" features a commentary track by Director Wolfgang Petersen and Michael Coleman.  This is the same commentary from the DVD release but there is good information from Petersen on scenes that were actual aerial shots and not CG and which parts were shot on a set and were CG'd.  Also, learning about his feelings towards his cast members, Harrison Ford especially and how Ford did his own stunt work.<br /><br />BD Live is also enabled and there are commercials in 1080p for upcoming releases from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />I am a big Harrison Ford fan and I watched this film immediately when it came out on theaters.  My first impression was that Harrison Ford should definitely be President because it was like a combination of a President meets DIE HARD's John McClane.  Well, not really but Harrison Ford's role as a President who fights back was definitely a highlight throughout the film.<br /><br />One thing that I know is when a film is being directed by Wolfgang Petersen, the viewer is definitely going to be treated with an exceptional, action-packed film and \\"AIR FORCE ONE\\" is just that.  Even 12 years later and this film still holds up quite well.  Petersen and everyone involved in this film did a wonderful job and I have to say that this is my favorite Harrison Ford action thriller to come out in the 1990's.  He manages to have the suave, charisma and that look and feel of an action star but in this case, he's the President of the United States.<br /><br />But for those who own the DVD of \\"AIR FORCE ONE\\", you may be wondering if its worth the double dip?  I have to answer with an extreme \\"YES!!!\\".  The soundtrack of \\"AIR FORCE ONE\\" is top notch and I will say that its one of the most immersive soundtracks I have heard on Blu-ray.  Also, bare in mind, this is not a new action film, this was a film released in the Summer of 1997 and it can compete with some of the recent, bigger releases on Blu-ray.  That is how magnificent this film sounds on Blu-ray.<br /><br />If there were faults in the Blu-ray transfer, its the fact that there are not many special features included.  Just the audio commentary but no HD trailer and no making of featurette.  The other thing is that although the film looks better than many 1990's film on Blu-ray and avoids the waxy, DNR look but with its HD transfer, grain is elevated.  Though not too bad, it is noticeable and this may be a slight issue for some viewers but I tend to be on side of grain is part of film and high definition elevates the look of grain.  And personally, I would rather take the grain than a transfer with a lot of DNR or edge enhancement.<br /><br />Overall, \\"AIR FORCE ONE\\" is a magnificent action-packed thriller and a film that Harrison Ford truly shines in.  And as for the Blu-ray, this is the definitive version of \\"AIR FORCE ONE\\" to own!film.    One thing that I know is when a film is being directed by Wolfgang Petersen, the viewer is definitely going to be treated with an exceptional, action-packed film and \\"AIR FORCE ONE\\" is just that.

B0026JWDQW|4.0|At first listen I was a bit disappointed.  However, the album is starting to grow on me.  Overall I would recommend it.  In fact if you ask me again next week, I might even increase the number of stars I've given.
B0010VD7EO|3.0|MGMT sounds a lot like they tried to become a new Animal Collective.  Similar timbres of their voices and the pshycedelic-electronica-pop was almost cookie cutter.  Creative? Yes, I suppose this album is creative... or at least it has a couple of catchy songs.  Tracks 1, 4, 5, and maybe a couple of the latter songs are terrific, but I could have saved myself the money on this band and either purchased the good songs individually, or saved myself the entire trouble and listened to more Animal Collective, Cut Copy, CSS, Kennedy (on For President), Grand National, Faded Paper Figures, or Bogart and the Addictives.

B001VB8UAE|5.0|Barbra, there aren't enough STARS in the universe to rate this DVD!  How could you put a number to such a stunning performer as La Streisand?  From the very first time she opened her mouth to sing, we have been blessed with this spectacular presence and this DVD proves her still, incredible talents.  From that moment at \\"The Lion\\" to this performance, she has proven over and over again that she is The Greatest Star.  She has given the world what only a few performers have been able to provide us with and to be in the same company as Ella, Judy, Frank and Tony is a feat not attainable by many.  She has earned the right to be labeled as one of the greatest performers of all time.  This DVD is a testament to her lasting power as a singer, actress, director and humanitarian.  There but for the grace of God, goes Barbra Streisand.  HOW LUCKY CAN WE GET?
B001U7FWM8|3.0|It must be tough to have to follow up an album like [[ASIN:B000FS9LKW Yellow House]], which is as close to a masterpiece as this decade gets. Yellow House has a very unusual, ambiguous atmosphere. It made an indie-rock band like [[ASIN:B000BNWNPQ Grizzly Bear]] fit naturally on an electronic label like [[ASIN:B0009NSDRU Warp Records]] -- it sounded exactly like a combination of folk and IDM. It made for a unique listening experience, as organic-sounding folk and country-style melodies were muffled by an ambient, echo-rich production.    Veckatimest is a lot simpler. Now, Grizzly Bear sound like a folk-rock band, maybe with a very light jazz swing here and there. The instruments are well-defined, the songs are rhythmic, the vocals are emphasized. It ends up making them sound more ordinary than before.    Although, granted, there are a few moments that do build on the sound of Yellow House. Opener \\"Southern Point,\\" the best song on the album, is like a more aggressive version of the Yellow House sound. The focus is on the jazzy groove, but there are sudden interjections of elaborate acoustic guitar playing (like in \\"Easier\\" from Yellow House), and the rhythm section rumbles with the same ominous tones as \\"Colorado.\\" If you were to wake up in a cabin somewhere on the New England coast in late November, and look out the window to see gathering storm clouds, that image might have something in common with the sound of \\"Southern Point.\\"    They do this a couple more times. A later song called \\"Ready, Able\\" has a similar sense of subtle menace in the chugging bass; the vocals are dramatically delivered and backed by reverberating, echoing chimes. \\"Fine For Now\\" interrupts the vocals with urgent, droning interludes on acoustic guitar. A keyboard line toward the end of \\"About Face\\" is a nice touch, and could have made the ambient-techno connection in the right context.    However, that's about it for the music. The song \\"Two Weeks\\" has gotten a lot of critical praise, but really, the music in that song is kind of bland. There's an upbeat but unhurried, jazz-inflected rhythmic groove. The lead is one note pounded over and over on a piano. The music is not bad; it's relaxing, like something that you might hear from a live band at an upscale jazz club. But it doesn't make much of an impact.    The only part of \\"Two Weeks\\" that does stand out is the wordless, swooning vocal harmony on the chorus. This is a strength of the album as a whole. \\"While You Wait For The Others\\" is similarly undistinguished musically, but the background \\"ooh-oohs\\" in the chorus are lovely, and form the song's only hook. The angelic choral sounds in \\"Cheerleader\\" and \\"Foreground\\" are also very appealing.    The vocals on Veckatimest are more prominent and confident than on Yellow House. They are louder in the mix, and most of the interesting composition has to do with the vocal figures. The voices are pleasant and soothing, and go through a number of variations on that general theme -- sweet falsetto in \\"Foreground,\\" [[ASIN:B000025XKM Nick Drake]]-like sleepy whispering in \\"About Face,\\" once approaching [[ASIN:B00005B4GU Thom Yorke's]] snarl-sulking tones in \\"I Live With You,\\" and occasionally taking on a little lounge-singer colour (\\"Southern Point,\\" or the chorus of \\"All We Ask\\").    I suppose the lyrics are meant to be more prominent also. This time around, they are actually printed in the booklet (Yellow House fit them all right underneath the CD, in small type, as if they were an afterthought). But it's still impossible to figure them out, and when it is possible, they do not call attention to themselves. For instance, \\"Fine For Now\\" repeats the phrase, \\"there is time, so much time.\\" Most of the other comprehensible phrases are similarly vague.    Most of the album sounds like this -- pleasant but unassuming lyrics, sung well but not memorably, backed by a competent rhythm section. The lack of compositional substance becomes irksome once, in \\"I Live With You,\\"which has a similar sort of one-note pounding to \\"Two Weeks,\\" only much louder and backed by drums. Sometimes the music sounds fragmented, as in \\"Dory,\\" where the droning guitar keeps getting interrupted by meandering bass notes, or in the short, forgettable piece \\"Hold Still.\\" I found myself really missing the sophisticated acoustic guitar passages from Yellow House.    Veckatimest is accessible. I don't listen to Yellow House every day -- its low-key sound requires a very specific mood that doesn't come often. So, I've probably listened to Veckatimest more times in the past week than I've ever listened to Yellow House. But that's mostly because Veckatimest is more simplistic, and ultimately less interesting.

B000BB1MIC|2.0|Perhaps the most disappointing aspect of Rory's college sojourn is her refusal to sample the delights of college, indeed adult life. She does not drink (or only does so in the most disgusting moderation; really, it would be better if she had more regard for the feelings of others) or experiment with drugs (no one expected Rory to go the Trainspotting route, but how about a joint? Such abstention is bad for the soul) nor does she really fool around with young men.  The show started to go wrong when Rory decided to go to Yale instead of Harvard; the result? NOTHING CHANGED. Rory was home every other episode, it was Chilton+.  Nothing new.  The episode where the Independence Inn burned down was the episode where GG jumped the shark; to whit, when it reached its high point and began its decline.  Said decline is nowhere more evident that this, season 5, the second weakest season.
0312323867|5.0|I was skeptical at first when reading \\"Something Blue\\". I hated Darcy in the beginning of the book but then I grew to see her true potential. Somehow throughout the book I was pulling for Darcy to put the past behind her and get herself together. Emily Giffin shows that even the shallowest characters can prevail and become the people we know and love. I was also happy to hear a follow up of Dex and Rachel. I would highly recommend this book. It is truly heartwarming. \\"Something Blue\\" is an excellent conclusion to \\"Something Borrowed\\". I would also highly recommend any of Emily Giffin's books. Her characters are loving and delightful. She always manages to tie in the themes of love, friendship, and relationships in a way that is highly relatable to everyone. Her books are not only fun to read but an excellent one!
1423101472|5.0|This last book in this series met my and my son's expectations.  We love this series.  Rick Riordan is a great author.  This book leaves you wanting more books like this from this author.  My son couldn't put this book down and neither could I.    We would highly recommend this series for anyone, and we have.
B000YIGNKE|4.0|I own this movie and have watched it twice now.  I continue to have the same opinion from both viewings.  This is a very good rendition of the Jane Austin book Persuasion, but it had the potential of being Great.  I think it was extremely well cast.  And, having seen several different versions of this same book made into TV/Movies, I can without hesitation say that the roles of Sir Elliot and Captain Wentworth were played brilliantly by both actors.  I was most impressed by Anthony Head's portrayal as he brought Sir Elliot to life with all his affectations without making him appear silly or ackward as others have done.    Indeed, I wouldn't change a single actor for each role, but I would have preferred the costume designer to have made Anne Elliot dress in a manner more befitting her station.  Indeed, between her constant head ducking and drab manner of dress I kept wondering if her role was confused with Cinderella!  Sally Hawkins is a fine actress and a lovely lady; she should have been allowed to bring a maturity of character to her role without seeming like the unwanted step-daughter.  In fact, I can't imagine Sir Elliot not insisting his daughter dress to befit his own vain image - especially in company.      Still, don't let my one criticism keep you from watching/owning this fine rendition of Persuasion.  It is well worth the experience.

0743497465|3.0|I finished this book 2 days ago, at the behest of my lovely mother who wants me to see \\"Angels and Demons\\".  I don't see movies about books without having read the book if I can help it, so away to Multnomah County Library's website I went. Not surprisingly, \\"Angels and Demons\\" has a waiting list as long as my (fill in appropriate part of human anatomy here), so I decided to take a look at Dan Brown as a younger author... you know, before \\"The DaVinci Code\\" made him a bazillion bucks.<br /><br />All in all, this was not a bad book.  He has a lot of great ideas, and he executes them relatively well.  It definitely had all the elements of what it takes to make a good thriller... almost non-stop action, pulse pounding suspense in the lulls, lots of \\"insider knowledge\\" and \\"who knew what when\\".  This one had extra layers of political intrigue and loads of scientific and military techno- babble.  I will say one thing for Mr. Brown... he does a good job of explaining techno-speak and complicated scientific concepts so the average person (i.e. me) can understand it. He also does a great job of weaving complicated plot lines into a coherent whole. The sad thing is that he still hasn't quite mastered how to get the exposition out there without making his characters look incredibly stupid.  On several occasions, I wanted to throttle his characters as they were bouncing ideas back and forth about the origins of the meteorite... \\"You idiots are the smartest minds the world has to offer?!?!  It's obvious, stupid... it's THIS!  Look over there!!\\"<br /><br />The good part about that rant is that it means I was engaged with the characters.  :)<br /><br />I also really enjoyed the way the female characters in the book managed to move the plot forward, and not by playing the stereotypical whore or virgin archetypes.  They were, as much as any of the male characters, as fleshed out and \\"real\\" as this type of story allows.<br /><br />The only other problem I had with this one was the overall predictability of the story.  You *knew* that Michael and Rachel were going to get together.  You *knew* that Gabrielle and Rachel were going to have to meet and \\"compare notes\\".  You *knew* that the character with the initials \\"SS\\" was going to have to go down... one way or another.  And the one thing that drove me nuts, but could have been just an editing error... the oft repeated androgynous bestowing properties of the CryptTalk communication system.  He was swinging for the cheap seats to convince us of the necessity of that filtering software... that it was important in someway.  After reading it for the third time, all I could think was, \\"Clarice, doesn't this random scattering of sites seem desperately random, like the elaboration of a bad liar?\\"  (Yes, I will quote Thomas Harris in a review about Dan Brown's book if I want.  It's my blurbing book blog after all!)  At any rate, I think he mentioned it about 6 times in the book.  It would have been a nice ruse if he just trusted us and went with it maybe twice.  That would have made it much more effective!<br /><br />He does a great job distilling complicated concepts down into understandable plot points.  He keeps the book moving and it *is* a real page turner.  He just runs into trouble with exposition and with making his characters anything more than one-dimensional good guys or bad guys. Character development is not always the mark of a thriller, though, and you won't get much of it here, either.  What you will get is a fun ride and loads of information about the spying abilities of the US Government.  (Oh yeah, if you are given to flights of paranoia, this is probably not the book for you!)<br /><br />To sum up, as the primary reviewer for \\"Sherry's Blurbing Book Blog\\", I give \\"Deception Point\\"...<br /><br />3 (out of 5) stars!!<br /><br />This book is a sweet little thriller from an author who got better as he went along.  If you are a fan of his later works, you will probably enjoy this one, too.Give it a go!<br /><br />Wishing you the best of books,<br /><br />Sherry
B000002540|4.0|Building on the momentum as headliners with three successively strong albums from the onset of their career, Blue Oyster Cult felt it was time to release a double live album as was the custom of many a hard rock band during the Seventies. `On Your Feet or on Your Knees' which its very ominous cover - the hearse, the gothic looking church - very evil and dangerous, was a way for BOC to show to their fans that the immense power of their live performances was not captured properly in the studio. Many of the best songs from the early years are feature on the live record including \\"Cities on Flame with Rock n' Roll\\", \\"Before the Kiss\\", \\"7 Screaming Diz-Busters\\", \\"The Red and the Black\\" and \\"ME 262\\" which all sound smoking hot on stage. My criticism of the record is that the `Secret Treaties' LP does not feature its best songs on `On Your Feet\\". No \\"Career of Evil\\", \\"Flaming Telepaths\\" or probably most importantly \\"Astronomy\\". The albums opener is an odd choice as well, \\"The Subhuman\\" which is a much more laid back song than say \\"The Red and the Black\\" which would seem like a natural. Also \\"Born to be Wild\\", though done well, could have been replaced by any of the aforementioned `Treaties' tunes. Some rave about this album as the best live record from the era but for me and maybe because I'm not a huge fan, I'm not overly impressed. Still worth it for live versions of some of the best from albums one and two...but without \\"Astronomy\\" or \\"Flaming Telepaths\\"...I'm not as impressed
B0025WUK1U|5.0|OK, I just bought the deluxe \\"Grace Around The World\\" by Jeff Buckley, of course put together by Jeff's Estate (his mom Mary Guibert really), and it's basically good value for yer money, plus it has essential ingredients which make it not exactly a cheap cash-in by Mary but a treasure trove of stuff for Jeff's legion of admirers, new and longtime alike.<br /><br />Just read the review of the single disc compilation \\"So Real\\", and I could understand why people would be frustrated and confused, but I found it to be an ideal introduction for newbies, and it plays as a cool \\"greatest hits\\", as an album, so I have no problem with it.<br /><br />This package \\"Grace Around The World\\" will make lots of people happy.  It's a 3-disc set, 2 DVDs and 1 CD.  DVD 1 has footage of live performances of every \\"Grace\\" song performed around the world, mostly all unreleased commercially, plus lots of rare TV appearances on shows like MTV's 120 Minutes, as bonus footage, 2 hours long total.  The CD is sort of unnecessary, as it consists of the first 12 performances from the first DVD...I guess to play in your car, on yer stereo and put on yer iPod and computer.  The 2nd DVD is the reason to pick up this package...it's the documentary film \\"Amazing Grace: Jeff Buckley\\", 1 hour long, and screened at different festivals worldwide & won all sorts of awards...the concept is pretty cool, made for no money and by first-time filmmakers, it's about the power behind his musical legacy, about his legion of fans...NOT a biography about Jeff...definitely different.  I think I saw a screening of it at the Knitting Factory in NYC, during a tribute get-together set up by his mom, a year or so after his death...which did hit me hard when I heard about it on the radio in 1997...nobody but a small cult of fans had heard of Jeff at the time, and when I heard that announced, I was like HUH??!!??  Jeff died??!!??  What the...???  I've been a huge admirer from the beginning and saw Jeff do an instore appearance/performance at NYC's downtown Tower Records in 1995...I still remember it like it was yesterday...met Jeff afterwards and he was spaced out but really cool and happy to have met me, appreciative too...likewise.<br /><br />Anyhoo, this package...it's like a DVD boxset, packaged not unlike Tom Petty's 4-disc \\"Runnin' Down A Dream\\" BestBuy package.  The DVDs come out in a double gatefold enclosure, with a 24-page booklet inside, well-written notes and lots of pics...even an epilogue as to what his bandmates are currently working on and with...outside the gatefold is a large, double-sided poster...one side is the French Grace tour poster...with the full black & white band photo, and the other side is the Australian tour poster with a different band pic...I would NOT hang this sucker up, unless you buy 2 boxsets and frame each poster, representing each side...otherwise, not recommended.<br /><br />There's also a laminated envelope with the title of this box and logo in silver print on the front of the envelope, sealed with a clear round sticker...inside is more memorabilia...a replica of his Sydney flight boarding pass, a backstage laminate, a small replica of a Columbia press release of his Grace tour, dated June 10, 1994, and 4 nice black & white postcards...pretty cool, all.<br /><br />All in all, a nice package for the longtime fan...hardcore ones might have this stuff already, but probably on shoddy-sounding & looking bootleg videos...nice to have it in a pretty package for a good value.  Mary put her heart into this thing...I met her at that Knitting Factory shindig, and she was quite nice and appreciative to me as I came to the event and I support Jeff's music and art...if people are not happy with this thing, oh well, I am...can't please everybody I guess...just know that it comes across that her heart is in the right place...I believe Jeff would be happy with this package, I really do.<br /><br />Jeff Buckley, RIP.t NYC's downtown Tower Records in 1995...I still remember it like it was yesterday...met Jeff afterwards and he was spaced out but really cool and happy to have met me, appreciative too...likewise.

B001DHXT6G|5.0|I was graduating from high school when Star Trek made its debut.  Wasn't really interested in it at that time.  When my wife and I were married in 1970, we watched reruns of Star Trek in the evening. I had been wanting to see how the remastering made the series come alive more and recently got the chance.  The improvement is truly amazing.  Sound, picture quality, and color have greatly improved the experience of the original Star Trek series.  I highly recommend the product.
B001XJEKGC|5.0|It's nice to see the legendary Eric Clapton share some of the limelight with the equally legendary Steve Winwood by doing a tour of this show. The performance is every bit as good as I expected from these two icons!    The two do a great job of trading off the spotlight and highlighting each other's strengths. What's surprising is how similar Winwood's and Clapton's voices are! On the higher notes, it's more obvious who's who, but in the lower register, sometimes I can't tell who's singing when I listen to the CD of this show (which I also bought)! That's quite a nod to Clapton, as Winwood is one of rock's greatest vocalists ever. It's no secret that Clapton transformed himself from a reticent singer in the 60's with an average voice to a powerful, blues shouter within the next 10 years or so, and since then his voice has just got better and better! Winwood still has it, too, though some of the REALLY high notes he struggles just a bit here, but overall, it's the same Stevie Winwood.    A real treat is Winwood performing \\"Georgia On My Mind\\" a la Ray Charles style. I remember watching an interview with Clapton some years back where he reminisced about seeing Winwood for the first time in a club when Winwood was 15, singing that song \\"just like Ray Charles!\\" I've always wished I could hear him belt it out too, and now we get our chance! I would have preferred the whole band providing the accompaniment rather than just Winwood's organ, though. I guess Clapton wanted Stevie to \\"re-enact\\" what Clapton saw that night in that club all those years ago, as I believe he said that Stevie was just accompanying himself when he sang that song back then. Still, the whole band getting into it, and especially a guitar solo by Clapton, would have been even more of a treat, for me.    Having two keyboardists in one concert was cool, kind of a novelty, but at times the blaring B-3's were a little too overpowering, somewhat drowning out the guitar and vocals. That's my only complaint about the technical side of this DVD. Overall the sound is great!

B000FCK8ZK|5.0|I watched the TV series first obviously, but when I bought the first 2 books, it was truly a treat to be in the mind of Dexter throughout the story. A lot of people complain about the lack of character development of the other people Dexter works with, but I think that there is just enough to establish them, and then continue on the first person view of Dexter.<br /><br />I also love the fact that in the book, everything is much darker and void of all the bubbly silliness that Showtime included with the TV series to keep down the gore factor and darker details.<br /><br />Deborah is quite often a bit too much at times, and can be quite annoying.<br />But other than that, I find myself enjoying the book and the TV series differently, but nothing quite beats your own imagination as you read the book instead of watching the portrayal someone WANTS you to see.
0739416707|5.0|I read this book years ago when I was in high school.  I loved reading it again.  I looked for years for a hardcover copy and could never find one.

B001P9KR8U|5.0|For once, this movie is as good as the hype.  It is a rare glimpse at how the poor live in India - the abject poverty, the conflict between the Hindus and the Muslims, and the cruel treatment of young children.  It is also a love story of longing and the final triumph against all odds.  The acting is superb and the plot is gripping.  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and highly recommend it.
0385504209|4.0|I finished the novel last night, June 1st, 2009.  I'd purchased the hardcover in a thrift shop mainly because I enjoyed the movie quite a bit.  I was curious to see if there would be any more detail in the book.<br /><br />There is a satisfying amount of extra detail, but I now have new respect for the film's screenwriters: the action of the novel and movie follow pretty much in lock-step.<br /><br />There are sections of the book left out of the movie that I can see were really unnecessary to the progress of the story.  For example, the cryptex-within-a-cryptex...completely unnecessary.<br /><br />Then there are parts of the movie that are better than the novel.  For example, having Tom Hanks as Langdon figure out that Sophie Neveu is the direct descendant of Mary Magdalene had more impact than the novel's summary of Sophie's grandmother's story.  And Sir Ian McKellen as Teabing was an inspired choice.  It made reading Teabing's dialog in the novel extra enjoyable, remembering McKellen's terrific performance.<br /><br />Of course, some of the scenes in the movie were quite contrived: the collection of documents underneath Rosslyn Chapel, for example.  Very unbelievable.<br /><br />Having seen the movie a couple of times, there certainly were no surprises to be had in the novel, so I could focus more on Brown's style.  I must admit I got a little aggravated during the big scene in Teabing's study where Sophie is bombarded with Grail fact after Grail fact.  Having Sophie punctuate each revelation with a staccato question or exclamation had quite a flat feeling because the device is so overused.<br /><br />Be that as it may, the novel was enjoyable.  I even went back to read the last couple of chapters today.  That's when I noticed the astronomical errors, two of them.<br /><br />In chapter 105, \\"night had fallen\\", according to Brown.  Langdon is speaking to Marie Chauvel, Sophie's grandmother, and Brown wrote, \\"Across the open spaces, a new moon was rising above the tree line.\\"  Impossible.  In the evening a new moon would be setting, not rising, since it's so close to the sun.  I thought maybe that everyone had stayed up through the night so that maybe it was close to sunrise and the waning moon (technically, not the new moon) could be rising just before the sun...but Brown writes later that, \\"The stars were just now appearing\\".<br /><br />In that same sentence comes the second error: \\"The stars were just now appearing, but to the east, a single point of light glowed brighter than any other.  Langdon smiled when he saw it.  It was Venus.\\"  Venus NEVER appears on the opposite side of the sky from the sun.  It can remain in the sky for quite a while after the sun goes down, but always in the western sky, not eastern.<br /><br />Those errors made me wonder.  So much has been made of the research done by Brown and the factual basis for much of \\"The Da Vinci Code\\".  But he sure never looked at the sky very much.<br /><br />Steve Erbach<br />Neenah, WIuld be setting, not rising, since it's so close to the sun.

B001MYIXAC|4.0|......THIS MOVIE.   \\"let The Right One In\\" is a odd and sometimes slow-moving film about the relationship between two 12 year old misfits.  The boy, cherubic-looking Oskar is bullied by his classmates. The girl, raven-haired and very pale Eli has been 12 for a very long time.  Eli is a vampire and a cunning blood-thirsty one.    The title of the movie is a reference to vampiric lore that a vampire can not enter a home unless invited in.  The consequence of a non-invitation is revealed in a graphic scene.    The movie follows this strange and potentially deadly friendship but Oskar and Eli are always there to help each other from life-threatening situations.    And the ending is ambiguous and details the future of Oskar and Eli.  But does it?    \\"Let The Right One In\\" follows vampiric lore pretty closely except there are no crucifixes, no garlic, no coffins, but this movie doesn't need them.

0060765380|3.0|I typically enjoy the works of Mr. Rollins, although most of the times I find them a little too far-stretched. This one is no exception to the rule; however, I did find it a tad too shallow and way too naturalistic to my taste.    We have to give Rollins credit for his tremendous imagination. He comes up with ideas, plots and developments that keep surprising me even after having read all his previous works. Every time the basic plot is intruiging, and so is the Marco Polo trail in this book. He taps into the story well, intertwines history and science in a fascinating way, and builds a present-day situation so complicated and multi-faceted, that it could bewilder even an experienced Rollins reader. Rollins is an author who does his homework well, his works are based on actual facts following a thorough research; that's why his ideas are so shockingly plausible. And, once again, after finishing the book, I'm curious to find out more. Especially in view of all the pandemic threats that have been raised over the past decade, I must admit that The Judas Strain did give me the chills...    However, I was also disappointed by the shallow and brutal characters featured in this book. Neither the good, nor the bad guys were well-developed and realistic. I hated the brutal and naturalistic descriptions of torture, and was repelled by the sadistic women (employed, perhaps, to make the plot colorful and spicy) in this book. I felt it was a bad move. I was also disappointed by Painter's role (or lack of)... All in all, the book was mostly action and no real characters, even Gray has somewhat faded in this book, lost his edge. Some may think that makes him more human, but I personally found it quite corny. On the positive side, I liked Seichan... She was a something fresh and different, and her role never quite fully understood. And, I kept feeling intimidated by the ability of the characters to put things together and fit a puzzle... But then again, it all comes down to the scope of the author's imagination.      All in all, not a bad book, but not Rollins's best, in my opinion. I would still recommend it to anyone who likes fast-paced and action-driven disaster fiction; it's got some interesting ideas in it, and would definitely make a nice vacation read. It's a page turner, alright, but don't expect to be left with any significant insights after you've finished reading it.
B000SINT52|4.0|This was a very well done film and right on the mark I think! Michael covered all the issues in a professional way and definitely gave the audience something to think about.

B0011UCOGG|3.0|I wish I could give Paolini a lower rating, but the fact is, I've read all three of his book and am anticipating the next. Paolini's main problem is dialogue. Every paragraph of speaking could be cut down to half or a third of its size. In addition to the redundancy, awkward wording also runs rampant throughout as Paolini attempts to create an old english feel and fails completely. If you can wade through the lengthy dialogue, there is enough story to keep things interesting and every so often I'll come across a passage that makes me glad I'm reading his book. I'll read the fourth, but only because I'm curious to know how it all ends.
B000PKX2KA|4.0|Needed a replacement for the OEM receiver that came with Copilot Truck, a software routing program for semi trucks, it works (install driver first), BUT, I would have rated it higher if it weren't for the short cord. 5 feet?? That doesn't even get from the west coast style mirrors into the cab. got 10 foot extension cable and that did it, with a shrink tube at the outside connection.

B001EGFQNU|5.0|What can I say this is one of the best new wave band from the 80's.the fact that you get the music and dvd in one it's hard to beat and a must have if you love 80's music.all I could say is buy it ,buy it buy it.you will not be dissaponited.
B001QV6E98|5.0|This album is a step in a more technical direction than Maiden's previous three albums. It contains probably their most popular single to date, \\"The Trooper,\\" and is still included on every tour set list since its release.<br /><br />Lyrically, most of the album feels as if the band was beginning to experiment more and trying different things with quite polarized results, in my opinion. Strong points include: \\"Where Eagles Dare,\\" \\"The Trooper,\\" \\"Still Life,\\" \\"Flight Of Icarus\\" and \\"Revelations.\\" Weak points would be \\"Quest For Fire\\" (the lyrics about dinosaurs and cave people just don't live up to the intellectual bar Maiden had previously set) and \\"To Tame A Land\\" (the song is about \\"Dune\\" but the words just aren't as clever as some of Maiden's other work). However odd some of the lyrics may seem, Maiden never fail to keep your attention melodically.<br /><br />Historically, this is the first album to contain the line-up that really propelled them to the top. During the \\"Number of the Beast\\" tour, Iron Maiden replaced drummer Clive Burr with Nicko McBrain. To prove himself to the fans, McBrain starts the album off with a technical demonstration of his abilities. He begins the album with a memorable triplet roll, leading to an anticipating rest for \\"Where Eagles Dare.\\" Throughout the song, Nicko plays a repeating syncopated triplet pattern on the bass drum at 150 beats a minute. While most drummers can do this with the aid of a double bass drum petal, Nicko chooses to play it with one foot on a single petal. Try that for even thirty seconds and your foot feels like it wants to fall off. Playing the entire song with this pattern is quite a feat and adds to the respect McBrain quickly earned and maintains to this day.<br /><br />For me this album sits in a unique place. It definitely is a part of history and has stood the test of time. I love some of it, I hate some it, and some of it is just OK. However, it does convey a simple message that is the title: for peace of mind one needs to accomplish whatever they may dream and be willing to just take chances, even if it isn't popular or seems a little crazy. If it's important to you, then that is all that should matter.mind one needs to accomplish whatever they may dream and be willing to just take chances, even if it isn't popular or seems a little crazy.

B0000251VZ|5.0|This album was a mountain-top for Iron Maiden. They really were in a groove here and the tour following this record proved it. The artwork is stunning: Rigg's really out did himself with this. The only thing even close, in my opinion, would be the \\"Live After Death\\" artwork.<br /><br />Every song on this album is strong. My favorite would be \\"Rime Of The Ancient Mariner.\\" These guys definitely do their homework when it comes to lyrical content and they show a great respect for their audience because of it. They write about some very historical and intellectual stuff and their musical content matches the thought behind the words. Proof in point: \\"Los'fer Words,\\" a wonderful instrumental that shows a lighter side and that they are still having a blast playing music.<br /><br />This album was recorded in 1984, when the band had finally solidified it's line up and had fine tuned the members' roles, resulting in a exploitation of their strengths. By this time in their career, they were working like a fine-tuned machine. This trip to the studio, Martin Birch was able to better capture a more raw-yet-refined and punchier sound then their previous work. Their first album, \\"Iron Maiden,\\" had a very raw power, yet lacked a worthy sonic production that Harris and Co still regret to this day (Martin Birch even regrets not producing that album). However, they definitely made up for it with this album.<br /><br />Murray and Smith don't disappoint even the most critical guitarist. Bruce nails every note with the character, power, and heart of a professional singer. McBrain just gets better and better and demonstrates a prodigious technique that leaves many wondering, \\"How could any human possibly do that?\\" And of course Harris, Wow! How this guy endlessly and spontaneously comes up with this stuff still inspires me. Maybe he's Mozart's long lost son?<br /><br />These guys have never sold out. They do exactly what they want, how they want, and when they want to do it. They deliver a live performance that surpasses many other bands half their age and even out-perform their own studio performances. Many bands just can't do that; no matter how good they sound in the studio they usually suck live. However, Iron Maiden is one of a very, very few bands that performs live better then they record.<br /><br />This album is a must for any Maiden fan, or metal fan for that matter. It demonstrates that hard and heavy music isn't and doesn't have to be stupid or full of anger to prove a point and be \\"cool.\\"<br /><br />When I first heard Maiden, I did not like them. It took time to recognize the genius-yet-still-grounded band that they are. To put it simply, they are an acquired taste well worth any discerning metal connoisseur's time.

B000005RQF|4.0|I don't know how they equalized the sound, but whoever country did this, my hat's off to them.  Not that the original CD release from several years ago is bad.  It's not.  But this time, the pitches and jangling sounds from Peter Buck's guitar are not screeching or wavering above other important instruments or Michael Stipe's voice.  You get to hear incidental effects more clearly this time.  Listen to the backup vocals in \\"Fall on Me\\" and incidentals on \\"What If We Give It Away\\" just for a taste.

B001PJRAUS|5.0|I love this movie! Any movie where the main character gets sucked into the lives and characters of their favorite novel is exciting.I have a lot of novels that I have read in which I will love to actually become a character in that story. Especially period pieces. It would be interesting to see what that would be like for a day or more. The only part I was disappointed in was when they cut out the scene where Jemima Rooper's character was singing \\"Down Town\\". I watched it online. On the DVD, the characters wanted to hear her sing and that next thing you know, there applauding and commenting on her singing, without her ever singing. I don't know if it was omitted because of copyright laws on the song or what. But it would have been nice to have left it in. Otherwise, I had no other complaints.

B001FB4W0W|5.0|I've been watching the first season of True Blood which we rented at the movie store. I have one more episode left and I'm done. It's in between Sopranos and Twilight. Twilight because it has some similiar parts, like a woman falling in love with a vampire - but near Sopranos because it has those sick ate up parts in the movie, WHICH I LOVE! It's hilarious, exciting, addicting, and action packed all in one TV show..     I thought the show was going to be dumb because it was about vampires, but I went ahead and gave it a shot and watched the first episode- I'm now addicted.    Give this show a try! And bible thumpers, this show is not for you!!
142312166X|5.0|If you're one of those people who has already visited a bookstore to pre-order your copy of THE LAST OLYMPIAN, you're probably also counting down the days until the release of the thrilling conclusion to Rick Riordan's series about Percy Jackson and the Olympians. What's an aspiring demigod to do while waiting for the final installment in their favorite series? The answer might be found inside the top-secret DEMIGOD FILES, a perfectly snack-sized portion of Percy Jackson's adventures that just might tide you over until the main course.    THE DEMIGOD FILES, a slim volume ideal for tucking into backpacks and pulling out during quiet reading time, is certainly aimed at the most dedicated Percy Jackson fans. They'll soak up details from the witty, candid interviews with Camp Half-Blood's most famous residents, including Clarisse La Rue, Annabeth Chase, Grover Underwood and Percy Jackson himself (sample question for Grover: \\"Who would you least like to meet in a dark alley --- a Cyclops or an angry Mr. D?\\"). They'll peruse the map of Camp Half-Blood, the illustration of Annabeth's fully loaded camp trunk, and the full-color portraits of Zeus, Poseidon, Athena, Ares, Percy, Annabeth, Grover and Chiron to see if the drawings match the world they've created in their imaginations. They'll challenge themselves with a crossword puzzle and word jumble, and reinforce their newfound knowledge of Greek mythology with a handy chart listing the primary Olympians who play key roles in Percy's life.    What these rabid fans will most appreciate, though, is the collection of three Percy Jackson original short stories that make up the bulk of THE DEMIGOD FILES. In \\"Percy Jackson and the Stolen Chariot,\\" Percy has to help his sworn enemy, Clarissa, when her brothers Phobos and Deimos (the immortal sons of Clarissa's dad, Ares) hijack the war chariot she's been entrusted with. In \\"Percy Jackson and the Bronze Dragon,\\" a game of Capture the Flag gets even more out of control than usual, when a horde of Myrmekes (those would-be giant armored ants) battle the kids over a bronze dragon automaton that might also threaten their lives. And in \\"Percy Jackson and the Sword of Hades,\\" Percy's plans for Christmas don't involve a voyage to the Underworld, but that's exactly what he gets when he, Nico and Thalia pay a call on Persephone. Throughout these entertaining and well-developed short stories, Riordan's trademark mix of adventure, humor and solid mythology is at play.    Three short stories, two puzzles, plenty of interviews, pictures and lots of fun. Oh, and did I mention that there's a sneak peek of that concluding Percy Jackson novel? That in and of itself should make this slim volume, jam-packed with plenty of Olympian extras, a \\"must have\\" for any demigod wannabe.        --- Reviewed by Norah Piehl
0345479092|5.0|Two friends recommended it and since, their little ones were happy, flourishing & sleeping well, we thought we'd give it a try. It became our baby bible. At four weeks our little one was all confused about day & night, fusy... and we were rocking him in his bucket car seat for hours in the middle of night. We needed a fix. Her words... if you can sort through \\"Luv\\" and \\"nappy\\" were full of wisdom. They made sense, especially her advice about following the \\"EASY\\" schedule and your little one's cues. Not depending on props, but instead giving your child a flexible routine that gives them comfort, and catching the window of sleep before it closes to an overtired disaster. Our little one is happy, and has been sleeping through the night since about two months, on average 8-10 hours. He's now 6 months, still breastfed, which I never felt discouraged from doing, and pacifier free. Talking to friends who are still struggling, makes me feel thrilled that I was pointed in the direction of this book. I heard stories of people driving around for hours, sleeping with a bouncer seat in the middle of their bed, running the dryer over and over again. This book brought peace to our family within three days of following it, making everyone happy :-) and leaving behind all the desperate measures we were trying. Having consistency, paying attention to one's needs, and lots of love is good for anyone.
B001GS0O88|3.0|What I remember most about this book are the characters.  They were vivid, distinct, and interesting.  To see how all of their motivations played against each other throughout the story was intriguing, and Grisham does an excellent job of describing their thoughts and emotions.  They were larger than life, especially for a small town.      The story was also well written and moved at a good pace.  The first chapter is difficult to read due to its subject matter, but the rest of the book is full of surprises and twists.    So why only three stars?  His potrayal of southerners was disappointing, making the majority of them look racist and bigoted.  I understand that race plays a large role in this story, but it seemed to overshadow everything that happened in the town.  Growing up in the South, I never saw as much racism as what was presented here.  I think that the racism was played up to make the story more dramatic, but it does a disservice to the progress that's been made in the last 50 years.
B001HN697M|5.0|I really enjoyed this for what it was, it filled in the gap before everything else happened.  It was entertaining and that is what I was after.  All I want for movies is to make sense at a uncritical level and to entertain me, this movie did that for me.
B00006AVRK|4.0|I'm a fan of P.G. Wodehouse's Jeeves & Bertie Wooster stories, from way back.    Regarding this set of DVDs, digitally restored from the British TV episodes originally released in 1990-93:  Pros:  * Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie are excellent as the title characters.  * Plenty of good performances by the numerous secondary characters.  * Plots and dialogue are true to the original stories.  * Amusing British accents and phrases, making fun of the idle rich, etc.  Cons:  * Color quality on these DVDs is not so good.  * The situations and scripts become somewhat repetitious and less funny by the time you get into the 3d or 4th DVD.  * There's a bit too much of the Roderick Spode character. His rabble-rousing activities and threats of violence are tiresome and not very funny.
B0016Q2D5M|3.0|Not as entertaining as I would have liked, the 3-D at home was not convincing, but Brendon Fraiser looked very good in this movie.  I'm glad I got it, but will not be playing it as much as my favorites.

I didn't come out of the movie theater feeling imbarassed to have to explain the dialogue which in some comedies is mortifying!
B0006B29Z2|5.0|Iron Maiden demonstrate respect and a sense of integrity for their fans by leaving no stone unturned in this documentary. The additional early live footage is a nice bonus.<br /><br />I didn't realize just how many people make up the history of Iron Maiden or just how hard they've worked and continue to work to live their dream. The in depth and honest interviews really let the fan look into the band and Steve Harris's vision. The only person I missed from this dvd, and this was beyond Iron Maiden's control, was Derek Riggs. His art work for the band has always been beautiful and unique. No one else can reproduce what he does. I wish he would've been willing to discuss his part of their history. They do include an old interview with him but I guess his feathers are still ruffled over whatever. Anyway, this dvd is awesome and I recommend it to any fan.<br /><br />The Live after death dvd continues where this dvd leaves off, and I recommend that too. in the mean time I am anxiously anticipating the next few parts of their story to be released soon. Up the Irons!

B00192KCQ0|2.0|I have been a fan of Metallica since I was a kid and heard \\"Am I Evil\\" and \\"The Four Horsemen\\". I've followed their career and even accepted that Load, Reload, and St. Anger were them stepping out artistically. I was a little disappointed in those albums but there were still some good parts in them.<br /><br />After all the hype, watching the studio videos, rock being replaced with rubin, reading all this, and hearing tid bits from the web videos I was very siked to hear this record.<br /><br />I first listened to this album from Metallica's online free listening party. I was immediately distracted by the digital distortion and assumed that it was probably some type of intentional digital pixilation to keep people from ripping the music off the net for free (you know, \\"stealing\\"). I thought, \\"Wow! That's a good idea \\". So then I just focused on the content and listened to the music. Recently I have discovered that the distortion was a mistake and unfortunately it can't be fixed because the instruments were recorded that way and during mixing the levels were pushed to the max further amplifying the distortion.<br /><br />Now I do like the tracks \\"Cyanide\\", \\"Broken, Beat, and Scared\\", \\"Suicide & Redemption\\", and \\"The End of The Line\\". There are some interesting things going on in each of those songs. But at the same time parts of the album, and those songs, sound a bit juvenile or just forced. The riffs are catchy but they don't seem to have a direction, logical flow, or a goal. Just \\"smashy smashy isn't this flashy?\\"<br /><br />At one time Metallica were considered the smart guys in metal because they played beautiful and powerful chord progressions accompanied by melodies and harmonies that seemed to flow and stir emotions. Some have even gone as far to compare some of their work to Bach and Beethoven. Michael Kaeman realized their previous genius and approached them with the S&M idea. I know that Cliff Burton (their former bassist whom died tragically) had a heavy hand in the band's creative process. He crafted many of their most memorable melodies, solos, and chord progressions and clearly was a fan inspired by Bach's figured bass approach. However, I think that their musical well began drying up after his passing.<br /><br />I give this album two stars because I do like some of the riffs, but that's about all it is, a collection of a few good riffs.<br />More over Step by step;<br />Lars' drumming on this album is sub-par. He is not doing a lot back there. He only uses his toms occasionally and isn't adding any anticipation like he had previously done when he was actually trying to impress people and prove he was a drummer.<br />James lyrics are not very inspiring. In fact since Load, they've started becoming cheesier and cheesier. Once in a while he has some cool ideas but I can tell he doesn't read as much as he used to.<br />Rob! Where the hell is rob' on this album? I can barley hear him. He had some killer ideas in the web videos that faintly appear on the album.<br />I am glad Kirk was \\"allowed\\" to solo again especially after watching him in the movie SKOM and his desperate yet correct argument about the album would be dated by the lack of solos. However, the solos on this album are about as on tempo as six foot infant on a speedball with a rock hammer and a jelly fish. I watched the making of videos posted on 'tallicas website and the solos there where on tempo and flowing in sync with the music but it feels like during production crunch time some idiot thought it would be cool to nudge the solos off beat slightly and it sounds terrible to me.<br /><br />The engineering and mixing are terrible. The clipping, distorting, and overblown volume just ruin the experience of enjoying this album to it's fullest.<br />The guys in the band have just brushed off the sound quality problem i.e.; Cliff Burnstein (Metallica's manager for some 20 odd years) said this, \\"There's something exciting about the sound of this record that people are responding to,\\" he told the Wall Street Journal and \\"...that complainers were in a minority and that response to the album had otherwise been overwhelmingly positive\\" in response to [Ted]Jensen's (the guy that mastered the album) comments. It's as if the it doesn't matter to the band that claims to love and respect it's fans. Respect would be owing to fact that the sound quality is crap. Just watch, in 5 to 7 years when they make another album they will say \\"Yeah, we were not very happy with the sound quality on DM. the record company really screwed us and the fans on what could have been a pristine album.\\" They've done the same thing since Load and Reload came out. I guess integrity left the band a long time ago.<br /><br />Like I said before, I respected Metallica for making Load, Reload, and St.Anger. I thought that was a pretty ballsy move, to make these records that just defy all one's prior work. But looking back I think that after Cliff's passing and the success of the Black album these guys just ran out of gas and feel into the depressing rut that Nirvana (how ironic a name for a band that represented depression) and MTV created in the 90's.<br /><br />As for recommending this album, if you can deal with the sonic production problems, you like things a little fast and crazy and a bit atonal then you'll probably like it. If you like things clean, tight, and logical then you probably won't.eople are responding to,\\" he told the Wall Street Journal and \\"...that complainers were in a minority and that response to the album had otherwise been overwhelmingly positive\\" in response to [Ted]Jensen's (the guy that mastered the album) comments.

But looking back I think that after Cliff's passing and the success of the Black album these guys just ran out of gas and feel into the depressing rut that Nirvana (how ironic a name for a band that represented depression) and MTV created in the 90's.<br /><br />As for recommending this album, if you can deal with the sonic production problems, you like things a little fast and crazy and a bit atonal then you'll probably like it. If you like things clean, tight, and logical then you probably won't.
1416550534|5.0|I would have given this book an even higher rating I had the option.  This book was a delight to read; it took me a week because I wanted to savor it, but I found when I wasn't reading, I was anxious to get back into the story and escape into the setting and the characters' lives.  I am an instant Kate Morton fan!!!!!  Finally, a  book comes along that is perfect summer reading:  true escapism, yet so well researched and structured that even the toughest critics will enjoy!  I really liked the fact that the story was told not only in the first person, but also through the use of flashbacks; I  thought this would be tedious, but then I began to realize how much I cared for Grace, the lowly house servant and the family she cared for.  This is a story of mystery, indescretion, love and loss.  It is the story of a great house and a grand family.  I was also impressed that this is a story about strong, willful women during  times when strong women weren't exactly fashionable.  THE HOUSE at RIVERTON is an achievement in plot and character that introduces Kate Morton as an author that can keep us turning the pages.  My life became as entwined in the people and house at Riverton as Grace's was.  I was sad to see this story end, but will be reading Kate Morton's next offering soon.  Thank goodness there is another book.  I AM HOOKED!!!
B001RTP48G|5.0|Not disappointed in the least.  There are only about one or two songs that I would skip tracks on on these combined two CDs.  The vocals, arrangements, electronic keyboarding, and overallsound effects are top-notch and modern.  Most of the lyrics are enjoyable to listen to and I like how the PSB have evolved through the years to were there is an expectancy to their new CDs/DVDs that do not disappoint me.  Looking forward to the DVD version of these songs.
B00006I53S|5.0|The Canon EF 28-135mm IS lens is Great.  I have used is almost exclusively for 6 months.  It is my #1 all around lens.  I no longer use the 18-55mm lens that came with my XSi.

B001AVEJ1Y|1.0|I've always been a fan of Star Trek.  I was very young when it was on NBC in the late sixties and became an avid fan when it went into syndication.  I enjoyed the animated series and then the movies.  I welcomed The Next Generation and the other series to follow.  I'm a big fan of Star Trek Voyager - Janeway is awesome.  I couldn't wait to see the new Star Trek movie.  I looked forward to seeing other actors playing the original roles and felt that it was such a compliment to the original cast for their roles to be reproduced 40 years later.  When the movie started I was in awe and was quickly swept away in the youthful exuberance and non-stop action.  It was different than the original, but that was OK.  But then the unthinkable happened.  The destruction of Vulcan and the assassination of the original timeline knocked the wind out of me.  I kept waiting for the salvation of THE Star Trek universe that I had been a part of for the past 40 years.  When the movie ended, I was confused and let down, mostly because I had enjoyed the first half of the film so much.  The changing of the timeline was not necessary.  I have heard many reviewers say that the complex continuity that has been developed throughout the years was too restrictive and had to be eliminated.  Well, all I can say is that I have quite a lot of respect for writers.  A good writer would have been able to come up with a script that would hold the interest of the old and new fan.  In fact, the first half of the movie proves that is possible.  My impression is that the assassination of THE Star Trek universe was very deliberate.  The director and writers went out of their way to tell original Trek fans to go to hell.  The director, in so many words, told trekkies to \\"stay home and skip this one\\".  It was very deliberate.  I guess he felt that by tossing original Trek fans overboard, they would make more room for the new ones.  But the Star Trek Universe is big, and frankly I think there was enough room inthat universe for the old and the new fans.  I think J.J. never really grasped the size of the Trek Universe.  A MESSAGE TO PARAMOUNT: With the TRUE Star Trek Universe erased from existence, I think it would be useless to spend any more money on the franchise.  After all, what good is it to own the Star Trek movies on blu-ray if the events in those movies never took place.  The same goes for novelizations, collectibles, etc.  I wonder if the new fans will be as eager to spend their money on your alternate franchise.
0385341008|4.0|I have always enjoyed epistolary novels -- admittedly not a popular style these days -- so the form of this one wasn't a problem for me as it seems to have been for a number of other reviewers. It's a charming novel for those prepared to exercise the \\"willing suspension of disbelief\\" and accept that less-educated letter writers could produce elegant, perceptive, and often witty prose. For me the delight of the prose itself was enough to push into the background the lingering question, \\"Would a pig farmer really write this way?\\"<br /><br />Equally, I could forgive the sentimentality and the predictable outcome because it was balanced by uncompromising descriptions of conditions in Guernsey under German occupation.<br /><br />It's a book I think I will want to read again.

There is so much more to the characters, the plot, the climax and the endings.

I remember watching MTV (when they actually cared about videos) being so intrigued by this woman dancing inasanely, but so happily! A few weeks ago I purchased the album @ a Borders sale and boy was I happy. Every song including the title track had me shakin in my boots LOL.<br />My 3 fav songs:<br />Swim-Excellent song, IMO a true 90's classic.<br /><br />Nothing Really Matters-So beautiful! The lyrics really speak to the heart.<br /><br />Sky Fits Heaven-Superb! Any open minded person connected to their fsmily & surroundings will love this song!

0066620996|5.0|Educational Goodness to Greatness  by WTAX    Jim Collins has written a book that describes great leadership.  Good to Great is a book with concepts that apply to businesses and educational institutions.    In his chapter entitled Good is the Enemy of Great, I strongly agree with Collins when he wrote, \\"we do not have great schools because we have settled for good schools.\\"  The goal of each school should be to produce sustained strategies for promoting high student achievement.     In Level 5 Leadership, Collins challenges that every good-to-great company began with a Level 5 leader.  I agree with the idea that Level 5 leaders \\"set up their successors for even greater success in the next generation.\\"  Level 5 leaders do not hire leaders based on their looks.  School districts should grow their own leaders and allow them to step into the positions of their predecessors.     The chapter, First Who...Then What, helped me realize that a principal can have the right people in his or her building but not in the right positions to help promote educational greatness within that building.  Unlike businesses, educational systems should not resort to lay-offs.  They must seek to find the appropriate opportunities for their current employees.  The time, devoted to finding another placement will pay off in the long run. Finding another placement allows the principal to build on the time and training invested in that staff member.     Confront the Brutal Facts (Yet Never Loss Faith) confirmed that great leaders maintain their vision, reality, and faith in the face of strong opposition.  Therefore, the goal of principals should not be to motivate teachers.  It should be to avoid de-motivating them.  Teachers have passion for learning and teaching.  Great principals know how to take that passion for learning and teaching to the next level to produce higher student learning and achievement.     After reading, The Hedgehog Concept (Simplicity within the Three Circles), I have decided that two of the three circles of the Hedgehog Concept can apply to education. The first is to determine \\"what you can be the best in the world at?\\"  Second, you must identify what you are deeply passionate about?\\"  These two questions will allow educators, at all levels, to use their strengths to educate others.  The third circle \\"what drives your economic engine\\" is not readily discussed in education.     A Culture of Discipline supports the idea that great schools know what they can be the best in the world at, what they are deeply passionate about, and that they have a culture of discipline that produces actions that promote high student achievement.   The chapter on Technology Accelerators confirmed that great schools have carefully selected technologies within them. Schools cannot afford to have technology sitting and collecting dust.  Technology must be used to accelerate learning.  Schools' uses of technology will determine their level of success.     After reading The Flywheel and the Doom Loop, I am convinced that in great schools, principals, teachers, students, parents, and community members experience momentum of the flywheel when the level of collaboration increases and student achievement improves.  The opposite happens in \\"The Doom Loop\\".  Reacting to low student achievement without understanding leads to slowed momentum and an even lower student achievement.      Finally, the chapter, From Good to Great to Built to Last supports the idea that great schools seek to attain sustainability in high student achievement. Regardless of race, gender, or age, they are interested in providing an educational program that promotes success for all students.

B001EOQWF8|5.0|At one level, Wall-E is a classic story of an awkward poor boy who meets a beautiful, classy lady and somehow manages to win her heart. Sounds easy. But look what they were working with: A pair of binoculars mounted on a tracked box and an egg with only a dark panel and a couple of blue spots for a face. Yet after only a few minutes on the screen, Wall-E and EVE are completely natural, believable, and appealing characters.    On another level, the animation is nothing short of incredible. From the rust spots and paint chips to the minute parts of moving mechanisms, the detail is mind-boggling. They even used depth of field and lens flare to make the film look as though it was shot with a camera, instead of being generated by computers. The only down side to Wall-E is the standard it sets for others (or even Pixar) to have to meet with future work. This film isn't just classic animation, it stands alone.    The shorts are impressive too. Presto is a classic slapstick cartoon brought into the digital age, and Burn-E, the hapless little welding robot that hums Beethoven's Ninth while he works is a great sidebar to the main film. Both are cute, funny, and like Wall-E, spectacularly well done.    The Blu-Ray disk worked flawlessly in my Sony player, and the quality of the image is superb.

B0017MO10U|1.0|This is the latest in the stargate movies, the plot is that the stargate has captured their most dangerous enemy and they are preparing the trial for the crimes committed, however he tells things will change, somehow he manages to change the time when the stargate was not found and the team was not formed as we all know.  While the idea is very good, I'm sorry to say the movie was profoundly very tedious, not as exciting as I hoped. So if you want alternate universes please check Star Trek Deep Space Nine or the books in which the idea is used.   As this movie Sorry Stargate fans it is not worth it.

A minority of people in the Final Empire have the genetic ability to burn certain metals which provides them temporary powers (depending on the metal) such as enhanced sensations, super strength, detection of other allomancers, influence over the emotions of others, and the ability to push and pull off of metals in the vicinity. Most allomancers can only burn one metal, but Mistborns can burn all of them. I thought this was fascinating and enjoyed hearing how Vin and Kelsier used metals to travel, jump over walls, and fight. I was particularly impressed with the very detailed and thoughtful fight scenes. It must have been tough for Mr. Sanderson to make sure that everything they did with metals made sense physically (there are a lot of \\"opposite reactions\\" to take into account). This is really cool stuff. There are hints and rumors that there may be more metals that most allomancers don't know about, and I'm hoping we'll see some of these in the next book.<br /><br />There was really only one thing that annoyed me in Mistborn, and that was the overuse of the word \\"paused.\\" Almost every page says either \\"Vin paused,\\" \\"Kelsier paused,\\" or someone else paused.

B000069KGM|5.0|Chicago released its debut album (a double album I may add) as Chicago Transit Authority in April of 1969.<br />The group that would be known as Chicago Transit Authority started as The Missing Links then changed its name to The Music Foundation before changing to The Big Thing (either that or The Big Sounds as some night club owners outside of the Chicago, Illinois ares didn't like the double entendre the name also alluded to (The Big Thing could also be a slang for pen*s)) which included woodwind expert Walt Parazaider, singer/songwriter/guitarist Terry Kath (whom played in Dick Clark's Traveling Cavalcade of Stars in 1963 with Walt) plus trombonist Jimmy Pankow, trumpet player Lee Loughaine, keyboard player/singer/songwriter Robert Lamm and drummer Danny Seraphaine. The last member to join was singer/bass player/songwriter Peter Cetera. Then with producer/manager William James Guercio (who played bass in the Dick Clark band with Terry and Walt) changed the group name to Chicago Transit Authority and got the group signed to Columbia Records and recorded its classic debut.<br />We begin with \\"Introduction\\" which introduces CTA to the world. It's an almost biographical number written and sung by Kath telling all who Chicago is and what they're all about. The solos on this track are phenomenal with Pankow, Loughaine and Kath each soloing on trombone, trumpet and guitar like no tomorrow. Lamm's piano skills are featured in the intro to \\"Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?\\" which then turned into a great song to this day and one of Chicago's biggest hits. \\"Beginnings\\" ended the first side and was Lamm's tribute to folk artist Richie Havens (whom inspired Lamm to write this track) and a great song.<br />The album's second half started with \\"Questions 67 and 68\\" which saw Cetera's tenor as a perfect counterpoint to Lamm and Kath's baritone voices plus the horns are superb here. We follow with an excellent rocker from Kath called \\"Listen\\". What a song. The first LP ended with \\"Poem 58\\" which starts as a stellar guitar/bass/drums jam with Kath playing like he was a Roman candle about to explode before turning into a stellar vocal from Lamm which is a great love song.<br />The second LP started with \\"Free Form Guitar\\" which is six minutes of Kath, a guitar, an amp and noise. This solo proved the theory that Jimi Hendrix stated to Parazaider and Guercio that Terry was a much better guitarist than he. \\"South California Purples\\" is next and a killer straight-ahead bluesy rocker featuring Lamm's impressive skills on the Hammond organ and vocals and Kath playing like a man possessed. Chicago's cover of The Spencer Davis Group's \\"I'm a Man\\" (with an impressive Seraphine drum solo) is jawdropping with Kath, Cetera and Lamm all trading lead vocals in different verses. What a cover and trumps the original IMHO.<br />The \\"Prologue\\" was recorded at the Democratic National Convention on August 29, 1968 at the riots that were recorded that night. \\"Someday\\" follows and was the band's political commentary on changing world in 1968/69 and inspired by the riots at that convention and also the Richard Nixon administration was starting at the time this album was recorded. We close this classic double album with \\"Liberation\\" which is a 14-minute based guitar jam. This track was recorded with no overdubs and a great closer.<br />Chicago Transit Authority reached #17 in 1969 and went Gold in its first year od release and eventually went Double Platinum on strength of the music despite no singles did well in its initial run. Chicago Transit Authority proved Chicago would be in for the long haul (especially this stellar remastered version Rhino issued in 2002).<br />Recommended!\\"Poem 58\\" which starts as a stellar guitar/bass/drums jam with Kath playing like he was a Roman candle about to explode before turning into a stellar vocal from Lamm which is a great love song.

I don't know if everything was written accurately according to the real life of the man, but the movie is entertaining.

B001NLL8LA|2.0|I am one of a growing number of Lee Child fans who have become increasingly disappointed with the last two Reacher novels.   I appreciate the hard work that goes into his writing,but it seems as if Mr. Child hasn't gotten (or doesn't care) about any feedback of his recent work. 'Gone Tomorrow' is incredibly boring!  I know   it is not a stand alone  book (I have read all in the series) but  I can't imagine what a reader new to the series must think of the Reacher character if they read this book before any other...  Mr. Child please listen to what your readers are saying and stop stringing us \\"Reacher\\" fans along only to be disappointed over and over again.

1595141715|2.0|The story idea had a lot of potential and that's why I bought it. After having read it, I can say that I did not sympathize at all with the girl's character. She was basically just blaming others for her death, which I thought was horrible. None of the other characters did anything so bad to be blamed for her death (ESPECIALLY the last person in the tapes). And by her basically blaming everyone else, is she trying to cause another suicide? How about taking responsibility for your own life? This seems like it's just teaching teens to blame others - great lesson! I don't think the author gave a strong enough argument to have this girl end her own life. I don't recall the character ever saying she was depressed or anything like that.    Besides the story itself, the book was written in an interesting style, although hard to get used to at first - jumping back and forth between narrators (in 1st person POV) between paragraphs and sometimes sentences.    The author seems like a strong writer, but the story definitely lacked something. At the end, I felt like I had read something with no point.  The only thing I took away from this book is to be careful because something you might do could be blown way out of proportion and then you could be blamed for someone's suicide.  Hey, perhaps that's what the author was going for!  If that's the case, then yay!  Mission accomplished.

0765316889|4.0|EDIT (03/16/2014):  Upon re-reading this book (almost 5 years from my first reading), I'm updating my rating just a bit.  I still feel that the book is too drawn out and padded.  But, if I just accept the fact that it's about internal developments instead of external ones, then I'm happier with its focus.  So, I'm increasing my rating by 1/2 star.  That means the book is now 3-1/2 stars out of 5, and I'm rounding it up to a Very Good 4 stars out of 5 (it might not deserve a full 4 star rating, but it certainly doesn't deserve just a 3 star one).  The rest of my original comments, below, still stand.<br /><br />___ ORIGINAL REVIEW ___<br /><br />\\"The Well of Ascension\\" is the second in Brandon Sanderson's \\"Mistborn\\" series. Unfortunately, even though the last 175 pages of the book are very good, the first 400 pages or so are mostly a waste of paper. In a nutshell, those first 400 pages amount to the repetitive documentation of all the angst suffered by the main characters over all the armies sitting outside their walls, political problems, and \\"who am I\\" soul-searching. The thing that should have been the focus for the book (i.e., the Well of Ascension) is ignored until the end. This makes reading the book feel more like a chore than a pleasure. If Sanderson had condensed the first 400 pages down to 50 (or even 100) pages, it would have been a very good book. But, as is -- meh:  the best I can rate it is an OK 3 stars out of 5.<br /><br />The novels currently in Sanderson's \\"Mistborn\\" series are:<br /><br />1, 2, and 3.

0786860707|3.0|As a budding animator, my favorites sprouted from Disney's 'Nine old men'...Frank and Ollie were my all time favorites out of those outstanding men.<br />The book is beautiful with large images and some not seen befores...but the print quality is not good and is a real shame that was skimped on in the reprinting budget. Some pencils were so light, I could barely see it...SHAMEFUL!<br />Should they decide on another reprint, I hope they show respect and allow the budget to reflect on the once-in-a-lifetime artistry and exceptional talent these men worked tirelessly on that revolutionized the animation world as we know it today. These inspirational men certainly deserve the most devout respect.
0385341008|5.0|This was probably one of the most enjoyable books I have ever read.  It's the story of a young woman, told in letters, who is contacted by the eventual owner of one of her books, and who begins a correspondence with him and other residents of the island of Guernsey who survived the German occupation of WWII and are rebuilding their lives.  The characters' personalities are so well drawn that by the end of the book, you believe they are real persons and want to travel over to meet them!  The harsh incidents from the war are included and not glossed over, but the characters accept them and carry on in spite of them.  An absolutely lovely book.
034544678X|4.0|I recently adopted my first dog and ever since have been reading books on dog behavior and training.  So far this book is one of my favorites along with[[ASIN:0743297768 Reaching the Animal Mind: Clicker Training and What It Teaches Us About All Animals]].  I tend to like books that do not just tell you what to do with your animal but explain the biology and psychology behind why that is the right way to do things.    This is done very well in this book.  The one difference between it and so many dog training books I have read is it talks not just about animal behavior but also about human behavior and how the way act and how we are wired affects the response we get from our dogs.  She uses both personal antedotes from her vast experience as an animal behaviorist as well as hard science to craft her story and the result is very effective.  It is credible and well researched while still being approachable and entertaining.  I think she also did a good job of pointing out the things that we humans tend to do wrong in dog training without being preachy and putting the reader on the defensive.  She is quick to use examples of mistakes she herself has made, which made me more excepting of her suggestions.    The only area the book is a little light is on the recommended actions owners should take as a result of these learnigns.  She does provide some suggestions but even more would be appreciated.  They can also be a little buried within the narrative so if you are ONLY seeking out this information you may find the book inconvenient or lacking. I did think though that the tips she had were spot on and reflective of what has worked well for me in dog training as well as some things I had hoped to try.  The book is also very focused on positive reinforcement as a means of training.  This is my preferred method, but if you prefer more force or discipline you won't find it here.    Overall, I think this is a great book.  I love that she has expanded the conversation to talkabout the influence of human behavior on dog training and the owner dog relationship.  I definitely learned a lot and enjoyed the process of reading the book.  Thanks to her I feel like I am going to continue to learn more about my dog.

B001R4KQDE|3.0|First of all, I give the film 5 stars, that said, the blu-ray is only worth 3.<br /><br />Why? Because the best way to veiw the film is as a film, not as 4 short films. Yes, it's great to be able to veiw both ways, but, why is the additional footage not in the feature-legnth cut? The extended version is not a complete film, it's each story re-edited to separate short-stories. It's not the same tension or experience as the theatrical cut, which would be improved by the added footage.<br /><br />Now the blu-ray quality is there, the film's AVC @ 22.mbps average, and the DTS MA is nice though I have yet to grasp why DTS MA is 24/48 and not 24/96 (truely thunderous audio!) Still, it's a visual feast, an excellent film. If you have the 2-disk DVD edition, this is the same thing, exactly, in hi-def.<br /><br />Certainly worth the hi-def upgrade, but lacking a true extended cut.
076790382X|3.0|I hiked a portion of the Appalachian Trail; therefore I've read Bill Bryson's A Walk in the Woods.  (I didn't meet a soul on the AT who hadn't.)  There is no disputing, Mr. Bryson is a humorous and gifted writer, so I bought I'm a Stranger Here Myself.    Unfortunately, every discriminating reader of Mr. Bryson's works will quickly realize that Mr. Bryson is also a Liberal.  And like many Liberal authors, he just can't help himself.  His writing is laced with tiresome liberal commentary and snide comments aimed at conservative icons (the much loved President Reagan) and traditions.  He is also a true believer in the theory of evolution so we get these authoritative descriptions of how things began when none of it can possibly be proved.  One also gleans that he's been snookered by the ubiquitous global warming propoganda.  Further, he is mystified by the American's attachment to his guns.  It would be reasonable to summarize Mr. Bryson's book content by saying that Mr. Bryson's worldview is an almalgam of every extant Liberal cliche.    There were times when I wished he had stayed in England to save America from yet another destructive Liberal elitist sneering down his nose at we pitiable, uncouth Americans.  We have enough of these fools here already.    Liberal authors along with actors in Hollywood just don't get it: it is safe to assume that more than 50% of your audience aren't liberal; hence, leave the political proselytizing for political forums and please just entertain us.    There were actually moments in I'm a Stranger Here Myself where I marvelled at Mr. Bryson's flagrant ignorance.  He has got to be joking, I thought.  Yet, if not ignorance, then what?  Could he be willingly promoting the nefarious agenda of rewriting American history to expunge all references to God?  Say it isn't so!  Example: Mr. Bryson claims with a straight face that Thanksgiving came about when the pilgrims thanked the Indians.  I kid you not.  What falacious hogwash!  I had to bark a laugh of astonished derision.    But aside from the content of his books, Mr. Bryson is truly a talented compiler of sytax.  He's just not that deep of a thinker or a thorough fact checker.
0316017922|2.0|Overview:    This book centers on Malcolm Gladwell's attempts to understand success. It belongs in the same genre as a wide variety of books, dubbed \\"Infotainment\\" that attempt to simultaneously inform and entertain. As with crossover vehicles, all-in-one office machines, and two-in-one shampoo-conditioners, this means that it doesn't particularly succeed at any of these goals. He manages to make a few entertaining and insightful points, but the vast majority of the book is trying to do too much, with too little, all at the same time.    What's Right:    Mr. Gladwell does a good job of illuminating the fact that successive rounds of specialization, selection, and training can turn a slightly above average person into a superstar. He also does a good job of presenting the cases in such a fashion as to make you go, \\"Oh! Wow!\\" Which is great, if you are talking down to a reader.    What's Wrong:    Being able to turn people into superstars is a pretty nifty trick. But it doesn't just happen. It takes a lot of work behind the scenes. It takes a lot of things going right. Many have asked, in light of this book, \\"How many outliers are we losing?\\" My answer is probably none. Every system, including the one to train outliers, has a saturation point, where it can no longer hold any additional people. If we double the number of hockey seasons, for example, in an effort to catch the talent in the second half of the year, we also have to double the number of rinks for them to practice on, the number of top coaches (magically) that train them, and the number of opportunities that they have (again, magically). This is clearly not possible in the great majority of cases. By taking special training and giving it to everyone, the impact is diluted. Instead of having twice as many hockey stars, we would have none. That would be the quickest way to destroy the sport. Look at Nascar, as an example. (That is tongue in cheek. A joke.)    The author states at many times that there are factors that come down to luck that determine whether a person will be successful or not. Even Malcolm Gladwell, however, is forced to admit at several points in his book that this is simply not true. Yes, the Beatles and Bill Gates were great. No, they didn't do it on their own. But, there are thousands who likely had the same opportunities and failed to capitalize on them.     Many have made much of his disastrous simplification of complex socioeconomic situations and trends, so I won't flog a dead horse. (Much. If he is going to do something like this, he really needs statistical support to demonstrate that there are not more children being born at the beginning of the year in Canada, for example, or that Korean airlines don't have pilots that really are worked harder, longer, etc.) That said, I think that it is important to point out a few problems with his goals beyond this oversimplification. For example, Malcolm Gladwell can explain success, in retrospect. But he can't predict it.     As he mocks the IQ testers and their inability to do more than select a random sampling of successful people, despite their successive rounds of targeting the Termites, I mock his retrospective analysis. Sure, being born in the 1930's in New York meant that you had a good chance to be a successful laywer. Being born in the 1950's meant that you had a good chance to be a successful computing pioneer. So what. What does it mean if you were born in the 1990's? What type of endeavor, prospectively, should you engage in to maximize your potential? Malcolm Gladwell can't tell us. No one can. His prediction tools are limited and almost useless. As such, no real recommendations can be made using this book as a tool. Anecdotally, it is a really amusing analysis. Predictively, it is as useless as the prophecies of Nostradamus.    What's Trite:    During a book club discussion of this book, a couple of people stated that this challenged several popular American myths, like the fact that \\"Individual success is determined by hard work, guts, and intelligence\\", and that, \\"as people succeed on their own, they fail on their own.\\" But this simply isn't true. We, as a society, no longer want to believe that hard work is why some are successful while others fail. We desperately want to believe that it is luck. We didn't fail because of a lack of work on our part, or (gasp) our own insufficiencies. Rather, we simply didn't have the opportunities that others did. This is a classic example of the trend in America for the past 100 years to diffuse responsibility to others and to equally deny accolades.    According to Bill Wadman's review in \\"Time\\" magazine, \\"[Outliers] makes geniuses look a bit less special and the rest of us a bit more so.\\" I think that Bill Wadman is probably close. Everyone wants to feel special. This is the genesis of terms like \\"social intelligence\\", used by Gladwell in this book, that have no meaning and are completely farcical. Yes, intelligence is a good thing (in the conventional sense). It is not the necessary and sufficient personal trait to make up a worthwhile human being. Stop calling it social intelligence! Feel special for the skills that you have developed and your innate skills. Don't degrade the specialness that others have just to try to lift yourself without doing any work. Get off the couch, put down the Wii Remote, and go DO something. Become special. No one is born special.    Moreover, Americans want to believe that we are all equal, and that given the same opportunities, everyone will be equally successful. But this is untrue, as well. We are not all equal, obviously, as the intelligence and imagination tests illustrate in this book. We are all different. Ignoring those differences is stupid. While the consequences of considering them may be uncomfortable, the consequences of ignoring them are likely to be catastrophic.    The last problem that I will mention, although hardly the last problem, is that the book seeds to inform, but it really doesn't succeed. Mr. Gladwell consistently talks down to the reader, considering him or her little more than a child to be led by the hand through the magical candy factory. At the end of the tour, your belly is full, you have had your share of sugar, but you are no better for it. Instead, if you pay attention, you feel a little sick, because you've consumed so much and got so little.    Conclusion:    Read this if you like to speculate on armchair sociology. But, recognize that there are glaring, gaping problems in this book. The lack of statistical analysis means that any of the claims are anecdotal, at best. (As someone in my book club pointed out, probably from somewhere else, Malcolm Gladwell is little if not the Master of the Anecdote.)     Grade: B-    Harkius

B000YABIQ6|4.0|A superb series but my point for writing this is the DVD transfer. Am I the only one that has noticed that Episode 7 \\"Red In The Face\\" on Disc 3 is full of dot-crawl? From the opening credits you can see the red colored titles shimmering (quite severely), just like the bad old days of VHS. In addition to the dot-crawl there also noticeably is less detail. All the other episodes are fine however. What gives? Why has this particular episode been transferred over a composite video cable? Lions Gate, please explain?!

B000RZIGVS|5.0|As a diehard Trekkie, I am thrilled to own this series.  It looks great... color, clarity, especially on the HD TV's (which weren't available when the series was on television).<br /><br />The only gripes I have are 1) the packaging could be better.  The DVD's come in a cheap plastic case.  For the money, I would have liked to see something more spectacular and sturdy... something that looks like a collectible (like a model of the Enterprise with DVD's inside) and  2)  The episodes don't run consecutively.  You have to go thru a few screens to select each episode.  Quite annoying.<br /><br />With that having been said, if you're a true Trekkie, you'll love owning STNG the Series.  Totally Awesome!!!

031219126X|2.0|To start, let me say that I'm an admirer of this series, and have found other books in the series extremely useful (Turn of the Screw, House of Mirth). Having taught the Frankenstein edition this quarter, though, I find myself disappointed in the selection of essays, most of which seem to date from an unfortunate moment in the history of critical theory, a time when critics tended to ape the style of their masters (Lacan and Derrida in particular), letting short bursts of dense ideas substitute for sustained explication. I say \\"unfortunate\\" because while such density has its place (more, to my mind, in Lacan or Derrida themselves, who have a linguistic and theoretical purpose for their density), it is off-putting in a volume that purports to be an introduction to critical theory implicitly for undergraduates. Ironically or not, Smith's own contribution is by far the clearest of the bunch, with the psychoanalytic contribution appearing nearly unreadable to most undergraduates and many graduate students (thanks to an intense, and to my eyes rare, focus on Lacan's Imaginary Order). I will not teach this volume again.
B00008BXJ6|5.0|This was AC/DC's first American release, cobbling together tracks from their early Australian releases to form \\"High Voltage.\\" \\"It's A Long Way To The Top (If You Wanna Rock 'n' Roll)\\" & \\"Rock 'N' Roll Singer\\" lead off the album and are two of the best tracks AC/DC has ever recorded. Actually, two of the best rock 'n' roll songs ever recorded. I find \\"The Jack\\" and \\"She's Got Balls\\" highly annoying but the rest of the songs are solid and AC/DC's 3-chord attack is one of the best that rock music has ever seen. End of story!
B0000DCGT0|5.0|This is my all time favorite horse movie! I will never see it enough. Since it's based on a true story, the history behind the story is fascinating. But it's the little guy winning that makes the movie. The owner suffering the loss of his son, the trainer suffering the loss of his way of free range life, the jockey suffering the loss of his family and the horse suffering from the mistakes of other men. Together they heal each other and create a bond for life.
B00008WT5E|5.0|\\"Powerage\\" was AC/DC's 4th American release (not counting '74 Jailbreak). It doesn't stun the world into submission. No big changes. No new sounds. Just another strong slab of 9 rock 'n' roll songs the way rock 'n' roll songs are supposed to be played.    This would be the last AC/DC disc produced by Vanda & Young and that's a shame since they were very much responsible for AC/DC's bluesy guitar sound. \\"Down Payment Blues,\\" \\"Gimme A Bullet,\\" \\"What's Next To The Moon\\" & \\"Gone Shootin'\\" are sure-fire highlights. Amongst the guitar-driven crunch of the Young brothers' attack lies a melancholy spirit & heartfelt lyrics delivered by Mr. Bon Scott. \\"Powerage\\" is not just good. It's great. Do yourself a solid & go buy it. It'll be more than worth it and then some.
0312323867|3.0|In \\"Something Borrowed\\" we meet the evil Darcy and how she was betrayed by her fiance and her best friend, mostly because she deserved to be.  This was payback for her shallowness in general and the years of abuse she gave her so-called best friend.    Now we see Darcy alone and pregnant and no more improved in her personality in the last book.  She wheedles and manipulates others into getting what she wants because she thinks she deserves it.  It's what you have come to expect from the character.    I found the path the book took to be as unrealistic as the happy ending of \\"Something Borrowed\\".  All it took was for Darcy to be told off just once.  All she needed was for some down-to-earth, straight-talking hero to explain everything she's going wrong and BOOM she's cured of all of her shallowness and now she's truly worth of true love.    I didn't buy it.  The transformation is too quick and too obvious.  If Darcy were really the kind of person Griffin wants us to think she is, she would have been outraged and slunk away looking for someone new to mooch off of.  She would have married the doctor because she knew she could wrap him around her little finger.      Like \\"Something Borrowed\\" it was a quick, fun read, but it's far from believable.
B00008WT5C|5.0|I find it very difficult to write about AC/DC. Those bare-bones, basic, 3-chord guitar riffs have been played and over-played a thousand times. But no one does it better than the Young Brothers & no one was a better frontman than the late, great Bon Scott.    \\"Let There Be Rock\\" rocks! Plain and simple. The '03 re-issues give the collectors & fans a bit more of a look into these Australians' rock 'n' roll world. But the fact remains that they just never deliver a bad album. At least with B. Scott on the mic. \\"Go Down\\" gets the party started. Scott's lyrics on \\"Dog Eat Dog\\" are hilarious. And \\"Overdose,\\" \\"Hell Ain't A Bad Place To Be\\" and \\"Whole Lotta Rosie\\" end the affair on as high a note as possible. Great rock 'n' roll by a legendary band. Enough said.

B00008BXJG|5.0|\\"Highway To Hell\\" may be AC/DC's most acclaimed record next to \\"Back In Black.\\" It's definitely the last release featuring B. Scott. And also features the more commercial production of Robert John \\"Mutt\\" Lange. For my take, Vanda & Young are definitely missed. But the band comes through & that's the most important thing.    Every track on here is great. It's played perfectly. And is produced flawlessly. It's definitely an album, not a collection of singles. And I love the fact that \\"Night Prowler\\" is the last song on the last proper studio record featuring Bon Scott. It's got Bon Scott's sweat & blood dripping right through it. \\"Back In Black\\" may have been Scott's epitaph, but \\"Night Prowler\\" has got his fingerprints and soul all over it. Ride on, Bon! Ride on!
B00001QEG5|1.0|Back when this album was released, pretty boy hair metal was all the rage in the US. Licking their wounds after the career killing commercial disaster that was Come Out and Play, good 'ol Dee and his SMFs try their best to look and sound like Whitesnake with disastrous and truly laughable results... after all, this band became famous for looking like a football team on drag in the first place. Even the band aknowledges on their DVD that this album should've never been made in the first place, since the songs were originally intended for a Dee Snider solo album... a truly scary proposition. For serious Twisted Sister completists only.

B001DU8T6S|4.0|This is quite a good album, debut or not. The songs are diverse and the music is crisp and well-written. My favories are \\"We Believe,\\" \\"Through The Night,\\" \\"Some Things That Glitter,\\" \\"Small\\" and \\"Say It's Not True.\\" Not necessarily in that order. If you liked Queen, you will defintely like this album. If you like Paul Rodgers, you will definitely love this album. But it's got a new sound to it. You can feel and hear the influences from the artists' former collaborations; but you also get this fresh approach to the music that is quite enjoyable. No way are they attempting to copy Freddie here. This is a brand new band that still sings their old songs; but the new songs here are just plain good music that doesn't cheat by relying on the past. I think Freddie would be proud !
B001RTP48G|5.0|I have been a Pet Shop Boys fan from their first release, and always anticipate their next one anxiously.  I was certainly not let down with the release of 'Yes'.  Very well-mixed and thought out presentation.  I especially enjoy the songs 'Vulnerable' and 'The Way It Used To Be'. The arrangement and chord progressions are quite appealling and almost haunting.  I would highly recommend this album to not only existing Pet Shop Boys fans, but to people who are tiring of the hip-hop and rap, but also want something new to listen too.

I had read many raving reviews, so I decided to try her video for myself, and I am thrilled with the results! I was in good shape before starting the video, and I wanted to focus mainly on strength and toning. By day 10, there was a noticeable difference in my abs, legs, and arms (basically every area you could ask for!). I'm on day 16 right now, and I can't wait to see the other changes that are in-store.

B0026JWDQW|4.0|'Sunny Side Up' is Scottish/Italian songsmith Poalo Nutini's second album, following the critically aclaimed 'These Streets'. It's a different affair altogether to it's predesessor. Here, he introduces the fun of reggae in the infectious '10 out of 10', stomping of rockabilly in 'Pencil Full of Lead', pining of country in 'Simple Things' and the heart-rendering pop-infused r&b in 'Candy'. There is something for everyone here. He still sings with that raw wrasping voice of his and shows a talent fulfulling it's potential that I am sure will be here for years to come. Well done Paolo, this really restores my faith in the new breed of songwriters.
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|Leonard Cohen has been a favorite of mine for at least 40 years - and to my surprise, he's getting even better!    I heard a brief review of this two-disc album on WFUV's Sound Opinions, and bought it the next day, and have been listening ever since to this iconic folk singer/songwriter. One disc is in my outside radio, and the other in my kitchen - so I can sit and listen to Leonard all day, and I never tire of it.    Believe it or not, his voice is strong and still mezmerizing, and all the old songs sound incredibly wonderful.    If you are a Leonard Cohen fan, you must have this CD: if not, this will make you one.
1416550542|3.0|Thirty-something-year-old Cassandra has just lost her grandmother.  Nell was never an easy person to understand.  Quiet and elusive, she had always been distant from her father and sisters.  But, in spite of that, she takes Cassandra in after the girl's mother abandons her.  It is only after Nell's death that Cassandra discovers her personal reasons for doing so.  It appears that Nell was found alone on a ship from England to Australia.  Back in 1913, \\"Nell\\" was only four years old, and she was in the company of a mysterious authoress who abandons her on board.  A man found her, and he and his wife took care of her.  Now Cassandra will travel to England, and, along with an old book of fairytales, goes to Cornwall to fill in all of the blanks.<br /><br />The House at Riverton is a favorite of mine.  I read it just a few weeks ago, and I enjoyed it so much that I just had to get my hands on this one.  Even though The Forgotten Garden contains the gothic elements and romantic suspense found in The House at Riverton, it is not as riveting as the aforementioned book.  For one thing, there are too many points of view.  The constant head hopping gets exhausting.  Then there are the time leaps.  One chapter is set in 1913, then the next is set in 1921, then it jumps to Cassandra's POV in 2005, only to rewind back to 1976 -- and so on.  It gets confusing, not to mention annoying.  It should have been structured better.  This novel, like Riverton, reminds me of The Thirteenth Tale by Diane Setterfield, only that this one isn't as organized or as engrossing.  It does get better after the first half; the setting is the same for much of the time and you get a better sense of the characters and storyline, but it was too little, too late.  I did manage to finish it.  And I did enjoy it, warts and all.  Still, The Forgotten Garden is overall a three-star read.  Kate Morton is talented and she does write some wonderful stories centered on families with dark secrets.  You will find foreshadowing, symbolism, gothic atmosphere -- all of that good stuff.  I just hope that her next novel will be more like The House at Riverton.oreshadowing, symbolism, gothic atmosphere -- all of that good stuff.

1439138311|5.0|BROOKLYN engaged me from the beginning and kept me turning the pages right to the bittersweet end.  Eilis Lacey is a very sympathetic and believable heroine.  The settings of small town Ireland and Brooklyn in the post World War II years are remarkably detailed especially for such a short novel and the description of the ship Eilis travels on to the US was so realistic I felt  like  I was  there being seasick with her.  Even minor supporting characters are well drawn, memorable and often reminded me of people I  have known in real life.  In the final pages of the book Eilis is faced with a heartbreaking dilemma and though other reviewers have been dissatisfied with the ending I found it to be perfect and very much in character with Eilis and the time.  Don't miss out on visiting BROOKLYN.
159102594X|4.0|I bought this just to check it out.  I am a huge Neil Gaiman fan and he gave it a good review... so I figured why not.  I enjoyed the books, it comes along nicely.  There is no skimming, you may miss something. Though I don't usually like books that don't end, I did enjoy this one and look forward to reading the rest.
B001U0HBPQ|5.0|I was impressed and moved by the film.  The acting is superb and the story very compelling.  The film scratches below the surface of  relationships and mortality.  It is not depressing, but a joyful expression of what truly matters in life.  The film may get you out of your chair to hug someone that you love.  However, due to the manner the story is told this film is one that you either \\"get\\" and enjoy, or just simply don't relate to at all.  I respect that, and everyone is entitled to their own opinion.  I would just encourage people to watch the film and reach their own conclusion.
1416914307|4.0|I read this book in less than a day so it is most definitely a page turner, but you can skim through parts very easily as well.  At times I found myself wondering when they were just going to get on with it, it seemed to be constantly dragging on.      Now don't get me wrong, I did like the book and I do plan on putting the series with my keeping books.  I liked the characters and the story itself.  I thought some of the Jace and Clary scenes were a little corny especially at the end.  I just felt it was missing something.  My favorite scene between them was when he just wanted to sleep next to her.  That was sweet.    The other characters grew nicely along in the story.  I didn't like Isabelles character.  You can't really get a feel for her.  I loved Alec and Magnus, that was just awesome.      All in all I'd say this was a good book to read.
B00030590I|5.0|I just love the Chinese martial arts movies.  \\"Hero\\", along with \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\\" and \\"House of Hidden Daggers\\" are excellent representatives of this genre.  However, in addition to the martial arts beauty of these movies, is the cinematography - the use of colors and whole-screen visuals is superb!
0786856297|4.0|I have read other reviews that compare this book to Harry Potter, I must admit that there are similarities.  But Harry Potter was a wonderful series, why does everyone make this out to be a negative thing.  I have all of those books and I plan to own all of these.  There are few books that I choose to keep, and I know that this will be one of them.    Furthermore, this book is shorter than the Harry Potter books which could make it appealing to a younger audience.  This is one not only for adults but that I could read to my small children.  I don't believe in a lot of censorship on children so even though there is violence it is not extreme.    This book was a very good read and I would recommend it to others.
0307450570|5.0|I wanted this book so I could throw out a lot of the odds and ends magazine pages I've ripped out over the years.  Not everything is in here, but what is in here is very good and typically Martha, it is easy to follow directions.  This book is a keeper and will be used as a reference and idea book.
B001E5CH0G|5.0|If you have seen Elf and are considering purchasing it on Blu-Ray you likely feel the same as I do. Blu-Ray of Elf is very clear and great sound.  Will Ferrel is wonderful and this movie gets better each Christmas.
0872860175|3.0|For some reason I thought this was going to be a large collection of poems by Allen Ginsberg. I can say I've been a fan for quite sometime. This was not the case. In fact, This book only consists of 57 pages. Its a very small book so I don't care how famous Howl is or if it's being made into a movie with James Franco. This is not worth the purchase of 6 or more dollars.
B001H5X7KC|5.0|Tropic Thunder is great on Blu-Ray.  Sound is great and picture is clear.  Maybe not worth the extra money for a Blu-Ray movie but I enjoyed the movie enough to pick it up.  Robert Downey Jr. is great along with the other star studded cast.
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|I can't get enough of this double Live album.  I haven't taken it out of my player since I received it about a month ago.  It's Sunday morning, it's Saturday afternoon, it's after work -- every time seems to be the right time for these songs.
0345457684|5.0|This start to a three book series is really good.  It is highly imaginative, and full of very interesting future possibilities.  And yet, like good cyberpunk, it explores what does not really change as well.  How we as human beings still feel, still can be good and evil, and are not really all that changed by the kind of god-like powers afforded man in the future.      I like the character as well.  He is a flawed but fundamentally decent guy, seemingly trapped in a series of indecent circumstances.      I highly recommend this book to anyone that likes this genre.
B000S0GYRU|2.0|Suspiria is one of those films whose reputation precedes it. I rented it in expectation of the highly stylized, grotesque thriller that fans declare it to be. Instead, I was  treated to an hour and a half of pure, unadulterated cheese. I've seen several fantastic horror movies from the 70's, but this isn't one of them. The root of the problem is the absolutely horrific acting. Everyone talks and moves like they're doing a elementary school play. That is, forced and emotionless. The dialogue in some spots is downright laughable as well.<br /><br />Now, I love campy horror films (Evil Dead being a great example), but I had higher expectations of Suspiria. I was expecting something that is not common in films of this genre: substance. However, what I received was a mix between campy cheese ala Evil Dead (not a bad thing), and a horrible 80's slasher film. What makes Suspiria different from those movies is that Suspiria isn't trying to be goofy and fun. It is trying in earnest to be a serious film, and it fails miserably.
B00002SWEM|4.0|I found this to be a delightful trip into Cuban music from the oldtimers.  A great cultural experience.
B00006CXSS|5.0|THE best mini series I have ever seen, also the best depiction of war I have seen.
0385340575|5.0|Finally, anther First-Person Reacher novel, one which tells a wild tale that goes all the way around the barn and leaves you a little upset at the end. His travels, and travails, involve subways, Afghans, the FBI, Homeland Security, and even the NYPD, all in a razzle-dazzle tale with lots of action that never lets us down. Reacher Rocks!     Sorry that Amazon breaks it's own goal of $9.99- why do they do that for all the books I read??
B001C48EF6|4.0|I recently got to see this film on an airplane as I was flying back to the US from England, rather ironically. I thought I'd enjoy another look at some of the English locations I had fallen in love with so recently, and it worked lke a charm. Stunning cinematography    Emily Blunt was superb as a young Queen Victoria. I know to the history buffs, the historical accuracy is not to be found, but truthfully isn't everything conjecture? To get reality, you'd have to have been there.     I found it delightful to watch, and it is has further urged me to do more research on Victoria and Albert myself. I found this fresh take on their relationship compelling, and any film that makes me want to dig my heels in and do some reading, gets a positive vote from me.     Well done.
0061020680|5.0|For all Terry Pratchett fans out there it comes as no surprise that I already own this book in paper back.  I also listen to the audio version.  So the hardcover book I bought this time is there for adding to the collection.  I have lots more to go!<br /><br />Antje
0930289234|5.0|This is one of, if not the greatest comic books ever written. Hell, one of the greatest works of fiction period. That's all anyone really needs to know.
B0025X4P56|5.0|If you know Eels, you'll dig it. If you don't, you will as well. Reminds me most of the Shootenanny album. Good to hear E rock and howl again!
B0000019P9|4.0|I have heard this album before but never like this. I can now see why the vinyl version is so popular. The first time the bass kicks in on King of Carrot Flowers, I was shocked! It sounds so full and natural. If you're a fan of some of the songs, do yourself a favor and get the vinyl version.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|I recently viewed this movie.  The story is fascinating and a welcomed addition to the world of drama.  The players were well chosen for their parts and they played them well.  The period costumes and filming locale were treats in themselves.  A wonderful story beautifully told on the screen.  For me this is a high class film and I regret we don't find more like it.  --MM
1931559317|5.0|This atlas was recommended by a man who teaches Astronomy 101 in northeast Ohio.  It is easy to use and helps me to recognize stars in the sky throughout the year.  It's not expensive either!
0312370849|4.0|The first half of this book was so gripping and disturbing that I could hardly read it, and yet I could hardly put it down.  The author is telling two stories 60 years apart.  (She's not as clandestine as some authors, forcing the reader to discern which is which; she alternates chapters and fonts.)  The 1942 story is about a Jewish family living in Paris and arrested as part of the Velodrome d'Hiver roundup, in which French police sent French citizens to concentration camps.  The horror of this actual event is personalized by the fictitious characters, who seem even more real against the historical backdrop.  Sarah, the 10-year-old daughter, not realizing the gravity of the situation and the unlikelihood that she will ever return home, has locked her younger brother Michel in the cupboard and taken the key with her.  The 2002 story is about Julia, an American in Paris married to a Frenchman.  She is researching the Vel' d'Hiv' for a magazine article and finds that her father-in-law's family moved into an apartment shortly after it was vacated by Sarah's family.  My interest started to dwindle in the second half of the book, as it focuses more on Julia's vacillation regarding her pregnancy and her marriage, even as she puts the latter more at risk with her obsession over Sarah's story.  The author seems to have a bit of difficulty justifying this obsession as misplaced guilt, and I found this to be somewhat of a flaw in the plot.  Still, as historical fiction, it's a piece of history that begs to be told, and the author doesn't try to whitewash or justify the fear and apathy that produced such dire consequences.
B001UREJWM|5.0|Call them what you want. Black Sabbath with Dio or Heaven and Hell. Who cares? It's the music that counts. When Dio joined Black Sabbath back in 1980, they took on a whole new identity that changed this genre forever.<br />Black Sabbath with Ozzy may have influenced Heavy Metal but it was the Dio era the DEFINED it. Let's face it, the term \\"Heavy Metal\\" wasn't mentioned until 1980-1981 when the animated movie came out. But enough of the history.<br /><br />The Devil You Know is a modern day masterpiece. To compare this to their previous works would be a sin. It has a whole new feel and sounds nothing like they've done before. This is more than solid and is the best Metal cd I've heard since Dehumanizer. As far as I'm concerned, this lineup is the greatest in Heavy Metal history. To put out an album like this at this stage in their careers is amazing. In fact it is very addicting. Every time I start to play a different cd, I take it out and put this one back in because I miss it. At least for now anyways because it is new. The pounding riffs are in my head all day long.<br /><br />I admit it took me by surprise that this cd starts and closes with 2 slow-trudging tracks with Atom and Evil and Breaking into Heaven. I admire this because it goes against the norm by the \\"usual\\" fast openers. Why follow the same formula with Neon Knights and Turn Up the Night? It's somthing different. BIH starts off like Shadow of the Wind, but when Iommi rips into the new riff when Dio starts with his powerful haunting vocals, the song pulls you in and never lets go.<br /><br />I don't think anyone can deny that Fear and Bible Black are the 2 best songs on this cd. Iommi really shines with these songs and proves he is the king of \\"Doom and Gloom\\" riffs. I sometimes find myself \\"air-drumming\\" to Vinnie Appice in this one. Bible Black is certainly \\"The I\\" of this cd.<br /><br />Double the Pain and Follow the Tears are solid tracks. In fact they sound like they could've belonged on Dio's Angry Machines with a Sabbath touch.<br /><br />Turn of the Screw is a catchy little track although not one of the essential tracks. This one has a \\"Magica\\" feel.<br /><br />Eating the Cannibals and Neverwhere are the fastest tracks and worthy of cranking up the volume. I LOVE these 2 songs! Why people are not giving these 2 songs more credit is beyond me. ETC reminds me a little of Ear in the Wall but moreso of Overlove off Dio's Dream Evil. Geezer Butler is at his bassy best in Neverwhere.<br /><br />Yes! There's a lot of Dio-esque stuff as I mentioned above but he IS the lead singer of this group. You don't want him to sound different do you?<br /><br />Rock and Roll Angel is my least favorite track. Not that it's a bad song. It's just nothing special. In fact towards the end after Iommi's solo, you get the feeling that it's going to turn into a powerful ending. But all you get is a Iommi-style Holy Diver riff. In fact, if you listen closely enough, I hear a slow Holy Diver feel throughout this song. One of the few, if only, times that Iommi actually borrows a riff from someone else.<br /><br />I'll finish by saying that the production of this cd couldn't be better. It SOUNDS great and nothing is distorted. You can actually make out the lyric and noone drowns out the sound of anyone else. The production quality/sound is similar to the 3 new songs off the Dio Year BS compilation of 2 years. In fact, I actually made a cd copy by putting those 3 songs in front and TDYK tracks after. Listening to these 13 songs in their respective order makes for a great workout cd and flows very nicely since they are similar-sounding recordings. Try it! You'll see what I mean.<br /><br />Thank you Ronnie, Tony, Geezer and Vinnie for this reunion cd. You are a special lineup and have solidified your Heavy Metal greatness with this work.Turn of the Screw is a catchy little track although not one of the essential tracks.

B000X1Z0BU|3.0|[[ASIN:B000X1Z0BU Once]]    Unusual but interesting movie.  The music and spirit were great, the story line a bit unclear...
B001U0HBPQ|5.0|The Curious Case of Benjamin Button may not be for everyone, as the average movie-goer might be put off by the run time, but cinephiles and film students will get their money's worth here.
B001WCN232|1.0|What's been done to 'Star Star' represents the worst example of Stones self-censorship since Jagger sang 'Let's Spend Some TIME Together' on TV. Why bother? Only nostalgia freaks and Stones fanatics are gonna buy this album anyway, and they're hardly gonna be bothered by what used to be there. 'Soup' is certainly their weakest LP. There are some excellent songs on it, but the rubbish makes it hard listening from beginning to end. Such is their high strike rate that no other Stones album provides this kind of frustrating experience. And I seriously question the objectivity of the reviewers who're claiming a 'superb' job has been done on this reissue. Go and listen to the 1994 remaster; even with this weak material, the album SOUNDED better than this version. Why are The Stones treating their fans like this? Why won't they release a (proper) rarities set instead?
B001NFNFIK|2.0|Knowing James Lee B.'s amazing writing and the character David Robicheaux he created - this movie is so bad, it's criminal. To consider the money they had for this movie and the caliber of cast, such as Tommy Lee Jones to play Robicheaux it's absolutely a ginormous shame! It was directed by an old Canadian dude near 70 who clearly did NOT get J.L.B.'s writing, tone and feel of Louisiana, the dark underbelly, the southern Gothic dark tale at all. I wonder if he even read any of his books...
031606792X|1.0|I feel that the author has taken a beautiful story and turned it into rubbish. She ignores the rules that she set up in her first book (Twilight) and makes up a ridiculous tale. Because of the last two books in the series (Breaking Dawn and Eclipse), I can no longer say I am an Edward and Bella fan.    I feel like the author should have stopped while she was ahead at the first book. Instead, she continued to write and twist the story for the sake of money.     Breaking Dawn is not well written and very predictable. If you have any like for Edward and Bella, please, DO NOT READ THIS BOOK.
B00164KYV4|4.0|I loved this movie the second time I viewed it! The first time I thought it was going to be a hilarious laugh out loud comedy which gave me a wrong impression of what the movie was really like.  There are funny parts, but there is also plenty of real modern romantic reality- drama.    This movie has great cast including Drew Barrymore, Jennifer Aniston, and Ben Affleck, and a great plot that make this a romantic film to be seen by both women and men. This movie is about modern day relationships which include endless use of modern technology, clueless men and clingy women. Not only is this film enjoyable, but there is alot to be learned about the dos and donts in love and relationships. This film has it all! If you love a great chick flick and you want to laugh and cry, this movie is definitely worth your time!
1423101472|5.0|The only bad thing about this book, is that it is the last of the series. It's a shame we won't have any more adventures with Percy Jackson and the Olympian based world that it has been so much fun to get lost in.<br /><br />As a reader of all five books in this series, let me say that this book ends everything with a bang. While its hard to say, they saved the best for last, this book is definitely one of the finest in the series and really will wrap up everything in a very nice and fulfilling fashion that I don't think anyone will find fault in.<br /><br />The story is of our would be hero, demigod that is destined to save the planet as well as Olympus himself. Quite a feat and task to say the least. But he is more than up to the challenge with the help of his friends, both demigod and creature alike.<br /><br />Building up on everything established in the previous books, this will bring conclusion and end to everything. Prophesies, relationships, destinies, fates. Every open question and situation being built up upon will be finally revealed and concluded here.<br /><br />The book never has a dull moment. Whether its tying up loose ends, interesting moments found by the way of Percy's dreams or epic battles that we suddenly find ourselves reading about against larger than life monsters from legends.. this book seems to have a bit of everything.<br /><br />The young hero that we grew up with all the way in book one seems to have finally matured into the hero that he was destined to be. And it's been a fun ride following him and his friends and creatures alike from start to end.  I'll admit there was even some times I got a bit chocked up at some of the situations going on there.<br /><br />If you haven't picked this up yet and are a fan of the series? WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR!? Good series like this won't come around often.<br /><br />Again the only disappointment when dealing with this book is that it truly is over. But all good things must come to an end and this one is a fun adventure from start to finish.

B0002Y69NG|5.0|Great series for you Matrix fans. This was a great deal at a great price.
B0026JWDQW|2.0|I'm a huge fan of the first CD and was really excited to get this one, and have to say, after listening to it only 4 times, I'm feeling like the title should have been \\"Sunny Side Down\\".  The CD is really rather depressing overall, and not at all cohesive, each song makes you feel like you're listening to a different CD altogether.  Maybe like one of the other reviewers said, it will grow on me, but I'm not really feeling like putting it into the player again, or even like uploading it to my itunes, and that makes me feel not at all sunny.  There are a few tracks that I like, but nothing like the first CD.  Save your money.
B00133KFGW|5.0|I really love this movie - every time it was on cable I HAD to watch it so I decided I NEED to own it.  It is a great mood lifter.  I smile and cry every time.  I enjoy the music and the way it informs the story.  It stimulates my own creativity.
B000UCEJEQ|5.0|Annie Lennox has such an incredible range of emotions within this CD, and it is very energizing and full of feeling...love it!
B00005YU1O|5.0|And before people jump all over me, I'm not saying that people who don't like it are not intelligent.  I'm saying that they don't think in the way this film thinks.  I, for one, do enjoy these types of discussions of the mind, and found it a fascinating look at the subconscious.  Some of the segments are better than others (my favorite was the biker scene), but they all work into each other and (again, if you are pre-disposed to liking these types of discussions) are very thought-provoking.  This is not something to put on in the background, and it's not really something a group of friends would get together and watch (unless you have a group of deep-thinking, open-minded friends who are not easily \\"bored\\").  This movie is best enjoyed watching by yourself and really giving thought to the many ideas presented therein.  I am not a person who is easily swayed by the things I watch or see, but this movie really did change how I felt about a few subjects of the mind.
0486407217|5.0|A must have book for anyone interested in Late Victorian clothing and who enjoys sewing authentic Victorian clothes, not just Victorian-styled clothes. The introductions gives a basic review of drafting methods, with careful reading and patience (lots of it!) the patterns are easily drafted to modern measurements.

But after slipping through a secret door into another world much like her own she can't wait to get home again. Unfortunately her \\"other\\" mother isn't about to let that happen without a fight. Why does this \\"other\\" mother want Coraline so badly? For company? For dinner???<br /><br />The plot isn't at all thin - it's a very effective adaptation of Neil Gaiman's novel, altered slightly for a more entertaining ride on the big screen. Henry Selick turns Neil Gaiman's fascinating novel into an incredible and creepy world full of odd characters. Neil Gaiman is this century's Hans Christian Andersen, creating new and fantastic ways to entertain children, and make parents want to revisit the shadowy world of fairy tales. My daughter has waited anxiously for the release of the dvd, but we may wait for a more elaborate release - want to make sure we get the 3D that made this one such a thrill in the theater!
087349976X|4.0|I am completely new to jewelry making and wire working and found this book helpful to a certain extent.<br /><br />I think a total beginner should purchase this book WITH another book that has more detailed steps for projects. A total beginner should consult this book for the Introduction on tools, materials and basic techniques but FIRST start with PROJECTS from a book with more detailed descriptions and photographs of steps. This projects in this book is EXCELLENT for beginners who have already completed a few simple projects (as in NOT completely, utterly new to wireworking) and know some of the basic techniques and lingo. The written instructions are very specific on certain things (length of wire to cut, number of beads to use) and can aid a semi beginner in gauging the right amount/length of materials to use in future projects and in their own designs.<br /><br />The Introduction section is absolutely excellent for those completely new to wire working and jewelry making. It has a list of basic tools and materials you would need for basic wire working alongside pictures of each tool which is great as many new to jewelry making and wire working would not even know what they look like. It also gives a short description of the purpose/use of each tool and of different materials (beads, wires, etc)<br /><br />There are about 20 pages detailing basic wireworking and beading techniques. There are step by step instructions accompanied by simple illustrations of the major steps. I found these to be useful basics.<br /><br />The projects are beautiful and basic/simple enough to suit many people's taste and also to help inspire your own designs. Variations are given for some of the intermediate and advanced designs. Projects progress from beginner to intermediate to advanced level. Materials and tools needed are clearly listed at the beginning of the project instructions.<br /><br />I personally liked that the instructions were straightforward and were not influenced by the author's personal tastes and preferences, work techniques etc and was not punctuated by little stories or quotes from the author (Personally, I find them annoying and distracting). It allows a beginner to form their own design personality and work technique/process without being influenced by the author. In addition, the written instructions for the projects included references to techniques described in the introduction, Such techniques when listed in instructions are underlined, letting the reader know to refer to the introduction and doesn't leave the reader wondering (in case they have forgotten what they have read in the introduction).<br /><br />However, as I said, I found this book helpful to me as a total beginner \\"to a certain extent.\\" I made the Pearl Cluster necklace as my first piece (the design was the reason why I bought the book). It is the first piece of jewelry I have ever made and although it was easy and employed many of the basic techniques described in the Introduction portion, it also required a lot of my imagination and trying, testing and poking around to complete. But in the end the necklace came out beautifully (in fact, it's only been a few days since I completed it and I already have 4 girlfriends who have \\"placed orders\\" with me to make them the same design).<br /><br />The steps are written instructions and not accompanied by photographs of the individual steps. Illustrations  are given for some of the steps but they are not always an adequate supplement to the written instructions. Some photos are shown alongside instruction but they show what the piece should look like AFTER you have completed the step rather than HOW to complete the step.<br /><br />I also found some of the written instructions to be very confusing - this is where I had to consult the (excellent) photo of the finished product (the only useful photos in the book) and use my imagination to figure out what the author meant.<br /><br />Overall, I think it was a useful book for total beginners to consult about basics, but total beginners should find a more detailed book for actual projects before progressing onto the projects in this particular book. Semi-beginners will find that these projects can help inspire their own designs.s should find a more detailed book for actual projects before progressing onto the projects in this particular book. Semi-beginners will find that these projects can help inspire their own designs.
6304584598|5.0|This is one of the few DVDs of Fonteyn and Nureyev dancing together, and for anyone who had the delight of seeing them perform in the early 60s, this provides a very well-done reminder of a formidable partnership.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is the best workout DVD I've seen.  I do have Denise Austin's Ultimate Fat Burner that I've used for years.  It is twice as long and this DVD works you twice as hard.  Whew!  Great workout even for people that want something more!
0060882611|5.0|It's the size of a regular piece of printer paper 8 1/2 x 11. It's perfect for reading aloud to your little ones! I love it! It's not to heavy either. The pages are arranged in the exact same manner as the smaller versions, which means the illustrations are exactly where they are meant to be! It's just as I remember it as a child. This is such a sweet story of friendship.
B001YYQ9SS|3.0|As a fan, I don't get it.  When one looks at the video transfer of 'Final Fantasy: the Spirits Within', you'd expect Advent Children to look stunning in HiDef, and it doesn't.  Not entirely.  To it's credit, the additional 28 minutes that have been restored to the film look to have been mastered in particular for 1080p (you really notice skin texture and edges of things, and there's some 'pop'), but when the scenes shift back to the original film, the overall sharpness drops, and occasionally it's downright blurry, and there's weird blocky edges, especially in scenes with high contrast.<br /><br />It feels like the original cut of the film had it's image deliberately softened, and now for this video release they've just cranked up the gamma and noise reduction. Resident Evil:Degeneration had a better picture than this.<br /><br />Other than that, the new material fleshes out the film better than ever.. some of the music has been changed for the better as well (fans will note the Nibelheim Theme gets used during the church montage), the bonus features, including a sneak peek at FF XIII are most welcome, in what's otherwise kindof an average BluRay presentation.<br /><br />A mixed bag. You won't find a better print of this film, tho.
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|Although I have a number of other Leonard Cohen albums, I still really adore his London performance.  He recites some of his lyrics as poetry and his recitation is just beautiful.  His support singers are wonderful and I have listened to the album many, many times since I ordered it.  He is truly a gifted master bard.
B001QOOCTE|5.0|I love this concept as much as the wonderful music. From an engineering standpoint, it's a  marvel, pulling together disparate musicians recorded at different times and places, aided by portable technologies that would have not been possible until fairly recently.  There's only one cut that I do not care for (I'll keep that to myself)... all others are first-rate imho.  You'll find yourself singing along during the first listen.
B000SNUMC0|5.0|I love this album, and have listened to it completely about 20 times since it was released. Of the two parts (this is part I) I prefer this one. Tim \\"Ripper\\" Owens vocals are outstanding and \\"seal the deal\\" as far as the music is concerned. To really enjoy this album, you need to learn the story and listen to it a few times. Framing Armageddon has a lot of great hooks (catchy parts) that make it fun to listen to. The Sci-Fi story is very cool and well implemented as a concept. Too bad Tim couldn't sing on Part II, but oh well, Matt Barlow is back and does a great job on part II. However, in my opinion, this is the best of the two parts. If you like power metal, great operatic/screaming vocals, dark sci-fi, fast metal with lots of hooks, then get this album, give it a couple spins, then google the back-story to fill in all the blanks, then listen to it again and again.
B000GPIPT2|1.0|I opened this and first the disc holders fell out, and then I saw that the sheet including the important info on the film comes off...what the heck were they thinking! Worst packaging ever. If you like he movie fine, but you will have to get another DVD holder - a double to house this baby and make your own new cover info from photos here.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|The previous reviewer pretty much summed it up for me; \\"A Tragic Loss to the Television Landscape\\". Although, I'm a science fiction fan at heart this is truely a well crafted series that shows that the genre has come of age. There's nothing else that can be said that hasn't already been. I really wish they'd get this series going again as I believe now that more people have seen the 14 episode first season and the Serenity movie on dvd it would have the audience and the ratings to support it on network television or the SciFi Cable Channel provided all the same people writers, actors, director, special effects people, etc.. were involved.
B000FBGBPC|5.0|I may be one of Three Days Grace's oldest new fans, but the themes presented on this album are not angsty, youth-driven songs, and I think most of us can relate to feelings of isolation or bad breakups.<br /><br />Adam Gontier's voice on lead is alternately sweet and poignant (\\"Never Too Late\\", \\"On My Own\\") or grating and gritty (\\"Let's Start a Riot\\", \\"Animal I Have Become\\"), and Barry Stock's guitar absolutely rocks. \\"Over and Over\\" has the surprising but powerful underlayment of strings, adding to its rather mournful tone. \\"Gone Forever\\" may be the best breakup song I have ever heard - \\"First time you screamed at me / I should have made you leave / I should have known / It could be so much better\\" How many times have you looked back on a relationship and thought \\"I should have known\\"? According to the band's own website, the music was inspired by the emotional issues of being on tour with their first album. But this isn't a cd about being on tour, it's about being human, with human struggles and issues, performed with honest lyrics, a clear voice, and outstanding music.<br /><br />Some of the songs sound similar to one another, but that's probably my only complaint. After buying this, I was hesitant to buy their first (self-titled) cd, because I love this one so much - I didn't want to be disappointed. But I did buy it and I have to say, they have grown a lot as a band since that d&eacute;but! I eagerly anticipate a third cd from Three Days Grace.

0061684384|4.0|Great Book.  If you like or want to understand the subject.  Kat Von D. is an Excellent Artist.                                             I feel it a tragedy that more of her Art is not in a more lasting medium.      She is truley an interesting person.  And the TV shows that she has been involved with have had a great influence  on PoP Culture.                                                              Those interested in the art of the 2000's should get this   Book.      Darrin Manuell
B00064X3BI|4.0|When you approach this album you must already be an avid Clapton fan who wants to further explore his music. With the exception of Cocaine here we get emotion over power. There are definite examples of superior musicianship but Clapton evolves his music for purer style. Less fireworks here. If you want to see what the greatest guitarist ever does when he matures then you gotta check this out.<br /><br />Honestly, even without the sonic craziness Clapton still floored me here. The opening track rocks, even got my rap music friends to know the name of Clapton. The rest definitely would not have jived with people who can't appreciate anything that isn't drumrolls, guitar solos, and all fireworks.
1892005034|5.0|This book will help anyone wishing to improve their communication skills.  The advice in this book will help people from any walk of life.  I wish we all were born knowing how to communicate in this fashion.  The world would be a much better place.
B00004RF8J|5.0|I bought this dvd after listening to the music on my ipod with the kids.  Great musicals are a vital part of education.  This one totally holds up.
9056912445|5.0|I think i spotted a slight error on page 159. There are 6 diagrams there. The first one, is characterized as a draw. In fact, it is a win for white.  The very same position was analyzed on page 157.
6305944563|5.0|Great silent adaptation of Oliver Twist.  The DVD from Image is the best available and also includes The Light of Faith.  Oliver Twist has been restored as best as possible and is a joy to watch.  The intertitles and main title were reset when this film was restored in the 1970's.
B000UBMSB8|5.0|This movie is the paradigm by which all other sci-fi flicks must follow.  The \\"making of\\" disc contains hours various things.  A must!
B001FB55MG|5.0|It's nice to see Adam Sandler do something that we can watch infront of the kids.  It's a great concept for a movie, bedtime stories that come to life.  Is it realistic? No, but it makes for a cute movie.  Enjoyable, a must see for families.
1596912855|5.0|I love this book and think about it from time to time even though I read it at least a year ago. I didn't much care for the main character at first, but she eventually grew on me. I loved the surprise ending and found the whole book to be quite funny, often chuckling out loud. I have gone on to read everything else Shannon Hale has written. You can tell she is a polished writer. I think this book is a real keeper for Jane Austen fans.
B0018QOIXU|5.0|Bold, daring, elegant, deep, blueasy and jazzy vocals... and why not say it: chic and stylish.    Adele is not a great surprise, but she is THE BEST surprise for those who are interested in a bluesy, modern and intense vocal singing style.   Technically speaking, the arrangements in this first work are clean, deep and well balanced. She varies from an extreme sweet vocals to intense deep ones. From Daydreamer to Hometown Glory, each and every song reports the listener to an atmosphere of diverse feelings and her singing shows real emotion, not to mention she dares to be strong, having an elegant irony in her singing like in Right as rain.    All I can say is that: Amy Winehouse cannot beat Adele at all. Adele is more technical in her singing, more stylish and elegant. I hope I will be able to hear Adele singing more jazz songs someday, that would be even more amazing, and I bet she would do a great job, as she did in her debut album. Anything she sings will sound great, no doubt.

B00005IC2H|4.0|First off,what's with all these Radiohead fans getting sent over to Sigur Ros?!Bjork fans too?I bet a good percentage of the fans from those two bands will \\"not get\\" this album or dismiss it as \\"pretentious foo-foo fluff\\",\\"shoe-gazing\\", etc.--whatever little label they can stamp on it so that they are finally able to feel comfortable.Radiohead and Bjork as easily-accessable pop music,albiet great pop music.You are able to dance to most of the songs or understand the song's meaning without the need for too much contemplation.So is not the case with Sigur Ros.Basically, the album doesn't offer instant gratification(for most),is in a different language,is sung out of tune at times,and is not a smorgasbourg of technical showboating:if these are things that a listener requires to be able to appreciate music,then this album will probably bore you,piss you off,or just leave you confused.<br /><br />To those who are able to resist self-restriction to the confines of convention,this stuff will go down nicely for the most part.The only thing I didn't really go for on this one was the lack of contunuity that \\"(  )\\" and \\"Takk\\" have.Seems a bit like a Sigur Ros mix tape of cutting-room songs(not that they're cutting-room quality).I don't like it when musical messages or lyrics are thrown at me pre-deciphered with no room for after-thought.I know that a lot of people get mad,bored,and distracted when watching films by David Lynch or Stan Brakhage,or while hearing musicians like Buckethead or John Zorn for the first time.Maybe this is the \\"need-it-now\\" demanding trait of American pop culture,or it could be that people are not able(or given the chance)to have time to understand art that doesn't offer instant gratification.I think that if more people were able and/or willing to slow themselves down that bands like Sigur Ros would become more popular than pop bands as more people realized the value of a good\\"chill-out\\".
0684859106|3.0|I haven't tried any of the recipes in this book, but reading the front flap made me reticent to read further and little gems along the way made me grind my teeth in frustration even further. I've never been so insulted by a cookbook writer before! The front flap quotes a review in which was written that \\"nobody knows how to bake like this [like at the Magnolia Bakery] anymore.\\" But that's okay, we learn from reading further, because these two amazing ladies who started this bakery are going to be kind enough to share their recipes and lead us by the hand so we can learn. We'll be so inspired, the piece ends by saying, that we'll go turn on our oven right away--implying that this will be the first time. Oh, how kind of them to save all of us idiots--thank goodness we picked up this tome of knowledge! The author goes on to further help us lowly kitchen paeans along with suggestions to frost between cake layers first before putting them together (gosh, I sure wish they'd put a picture of that maneuver in the book!), to \\"sprinkle\\" the water lightly over our pie crust mixture (is that with our fingertips?!) and to \\"knead the [pie] dough together several times\\" before rolling it out. Good luck to the real ingenue who tries to use this book--they'll be turning out some real beauts! The topper was that the author felt the need to \\"confess\\" that they had improved on the classic German Chocolate Cake--but in their utter genius wisdom kept the Baker's German's Sweet Chocolate as their chocolate of choice for their recipe.    Maybe I shouldn't take these things so seriously, but these young women could surely share their recipes and keep their attitude to themselves, couldn't they? In my book modesty is the best policy.
B00104W8T6|4.0|Mi favorita es I want you, es un disco facil de digerir sin pretenciones de ser clasico, pero muy recomdable. La pelicula me gusto tambien.

B001UREJWM|5.0|This album isn't as daring as Dehumanizer, but follow closely its steps. Here we find a pretty good collection of classic Sabbath tunes, played in the deep and solid way that only these guys are capable.   Atom & Evil and Breaking into Heaven open and close the album in a dark and heavy mood, sounding like Sign of the Southern Cross (Mob Rules), Headless Cross or Eternal Idol. Eating the Cannibals and Neverwhere are up-tempo rockers, like TV Crimes (the former) and Time Machine (the last), from Dehumanizer. Follow the Tears has a riff very similar to Zero the Hero (Born Again). Bible Black and Rock and Roll Angel are very good songs, where we can percieve a stronger input from Dio. Double the Pain resembles Master of Insanity (Dehumanizer), with it's bass main riff. Turn of the Screw, although decent, is the only \\"filler\\" in the album.  Finally, we have FEAR, the best song theses guys have written together in many, many years: is a heavy metal, Sabbath classic, in the same level of Neon Knights, Heaven and Hell, Die Young, Mob Rules etc.. Is the song that won't grow old and that we will remember from this album in the decades to come; the one they should (and probably will) mantain in their set-list forever. If this album had just this only song, it would be worth its price.  Congratulations to Tony and Geezer (they are the best guitar/bass match of heavy music of all times); Vinny (a monster behind his drum kit) and last, but not least, to Dio, the man who defied Cronos and won!
0060730552|5.0|So I've read, Simpson's survival is widely regarded by mountaineers as amongst the most amazing pieces of mountaineering lore in history. And I can see why. I literally could not put this book down and even cried into my cereal.

B001PJRAUS|5.0|I really love watching this movie, so much that I have watched it twice. I just wish there was more of Elisabeths scenes in it while she was in the 21st century. But I won't give away what happens but it is different than what you would expect. But if you like to see the old manners and dancings you will like this as much as other Austen DVD's. [[ASIN:B001PJRAUS Lost in Austen]]
B001I8ETFA|5.0|The most influential book in my life beyond the bible.  Constantly challenges me to examine issues of 'quality'.  Not a book for everyone - need to be open to explore issues of philosophy while having a love of motorcycles: a rare combination.  Those who can persevere with it will be richly rewarded by an author who now has a worldwide following.
0312427999|5.0|For people not familiar with the Chicago School's thesis, the book is a shock in itself. This is an extraordinary work of research and anaysis. Full of details, gives a complete picture of what it is happening in the economic and political sphere. The financial crisis of 2008-2009 simply reinforces her thesis. Capitalism in its contemporary form is a system that finds destruction and reconstruction as an effective way to maximize profits, political control and a pervasive form of survival.    The book shows that it is of the utmost importance to be acquainted with historical process in order to understand current trends.    However, it is a pity that the author did not develop the whole story of shock doctrine in the case of Mexico. She only makes a brief mention of it. Mexico, as a fundamental partner of US, enforced through NAFTA, has seen fundamental and destructive changes in its economy, with negative results for the majority of its population. What it is striking, and that diferentiates it from the rest of Latinamerican experiences, is that the process was undertaken under peaceful terms, thanks to a political party that monopolized power for 70 years, and also thanks to the rightist party that won the 2000 presidential elections. Fraud and corruption have been the main ingredients for the domination of the US southern neighbor.
0812550757|4.0|This dual Nebula and Hugo Award winner is a sequel to the award winning Ender's Game.  Fast forward 3,000 years after Ender's destruction of the Bugger race.  A world hero at the time, he is now viewed as the greatest mass murderer in history and universally abhorred.<br /><br />Due to the vagaries of interstellar travel, Ender is still alive, incognito, living a life as Speaker For the Dead, a cult like figure who has penned a scriptural work entitled The Hive Queen and the Hegemon.  Unknown to anyone else, he also is in possession of a cocoon containing a Bugger hive queen, the genesis for reestablishing the Bugger race.<br /><br />Now, 3,000 years after destruction of the Bugger, another sentient race has been discovered on planet Lusitania.  The Interplanetary Congress, careful not to repeat the mistakes made in the Bugger destruction, very carefully study this new race (Piggies).  A combination of events leads Ender to Lusitania and brings together Human, Piggy and Bugger on one planet.<br /><br />Much like Ursula LeGuin's award winning novel, The Left Hand of Darkness, this is very much a work focusing on anthropology and interaction between members of different species.  The lives and customs of the Piggy race are meticulously and painstakingly presented, perhaps to a greater degree than necessary.  The status of the human colony as a licensed Catholic conclave is an interesting twist.  An enjoyable piece of work, though not up to the level of the original.  Also, the book leaves too many loose ends to be tied together in the third book of the series.
B000002I6V|5.0|I've owned two copies of this album and one CD.  I bought my first album in the seventies and wore it out, so I bought another one in the eighties.  I wanted a portable version so I bought the CD.  I guess I've been listening to Songs For Beginners for almost 40 years.  If that isn't a recommendation, I don't know what is.    Other reviewers have done a very good job on the technical aspects of the music, so I don't have to.  :-)  Just know, if you even remotely like Grahman Nash, you will LOVE this.  It's the best thing he's ever done.

0307408833|4.0|It's important to read the beginning section of the book that tells all about how to make gluten-free and other substitutions for the ingredients in the book (e.g., spelt flour).<br /><br />I've made the cupcakes and reviewed them on my Altered Plates blog as well (you'll need to google it, sorry about that).<br /><br />The one thing that didn't work exactly as planned was the frosting. It never fully set up, just partially. So, my suggestion to you is to use less liquid when making it.<br /><br />The recipes are very easy to follow and the cupcakes came out very nice and fluffy. Don't refrigerate them, though, as suggested. They completely dry out when you do that. Otherwise, very enjoyable.
B00288KNLS|5.0|If you are wondering if this is a good movie. Yes. The plot? Realistically speaking, it's a semi-childrens' movie. It may be too creepy for kids but it is derived from a kids book ( Neil G.) thus it is meant for younger audiences. Don't expect a brilliant plot like Godfather part 1 or Titanic, it's not meant to be a plot masterpiece. Just an entertaining film for everyone. Sit back and enjoy it. It's amazingly fun to watch and the music is great!
B0014GJ08W|5.0|At most 2 songs could have been improve on this nearly perfect blend of titles mixing [Jazz, Bossa, french pop, HipHop, world fusion, reggae] with caribean touch. Well done. Joyous and lively.  \\"Cafe bleu\\" song is a hit!
0316044695|5.0|I bought this book after seeing a story about Marcus Luttrell's dog being murdered by three illegals. I had heard another story previously about SEAL Team 10 and their failed, suicide rescue effort.    The Author/writer of Lone Survivor told the complete story and filled in many of the details that I had missed or hadn't heard.    I'm glad he told the unvarished truth about how liberal politicians hinder and confuse the very troops they send into harm's way. Marcus gave a gripping acount of the dilemma face on the field of battle by our bravest and best. It's just sad that our bravest and best trained aren't valued and regarded as the greatest asset this country has to give.    I recommend this book to everyone. The writing might not be the best but the story line covers it's faults.     Well done Marcus, and Thank You Sir.
B0000009RX|5.0|On the vinyl record there were not any spaces between songs so they just came at ya one after the other, but the cd is still great. This is just THE classic American album, a masterpiece of creativity, and humor. I really wish that Frank continued pursuing this direction of advanced arrangements and compositions as opposed to developing as an instrumentalist and developing music that showcased his instrumental prowess. This is Frank the social satirist and Frank the arranger and composer at his best, unfortunately he never really drew on these skills on this level after this album, but he did become an incredible instrumentalist (which to me is a lesser pursuit, though more profitable in financial terms). This is a special album that shows what could have been.

B0000E64TR|5.0|If you were to own one EJ album this would be it. The songs on GYBR display the brilliant songwriting shown on the albums leading up to it, but with a fresh kick in the pants energy that places it firmly at the forefront of 70s pop rock.
B0000009S3|5.0|Check out Mr. Green Genes on Uncle Meat to get context on The son of Mr. Green Genes. These are dynamite musicians really jamming in Zappa's jazz period. These guys can really play, this is when Zappa was starting to get picky about who he played with and from here on he generally got the best working musicians.
B000BYCAJE|2.0|I'm sure glad I didn't give away my first CD of this album.  I'm not a critical listener but the top end of the sound has been dulled very badly.  The bonus material is OK but doesn't fit with this album, it's more like from Deja Vu.  I hope nothing ever happens to my unremastered disc.  P.S. I gave this disc away.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|What we really liked about this movie was that it was character driven.  Unlike the Bond movies from recent times, this one relied on story and good acting to carry the plot instead a bunch of phony gadgets and actresses with overdeveloped chests playing PHD's.

B001U7FWM8|4.0|For the indie fan, Veckatimest is easily one of the best releases of the last several years.  As great as it is, it may be missing that one little element that takes it from appreciation of the production (and even reverence) to true love.  As good as the songs are, they don't often move your heart in the incalculable ways that force full on devotion.  It is a tough album to listen to all the way through repeatedly and I find myself selecting favorite songs more often.  (Luckily there are plenty...)  Still, a great album, my easy number 2 or 3 for 2009...
B00004Z4SD|5.0|This is an excellent family film about the trip of a man on his tractor to visit his dying brother.  It tells of his adventures, and the overall nature of not just him, but of the people he interacts with upon his journey.  A must see.
0307450570|1.0|The sellers put a picture of this product up like it is the hard cover book.  I was sent a black and white copied soft bound book.  I couldn't read it all the pages were all smeared together.  This product was $1 cheaper than the other REAL books.  Pay the extra buck and actually get what you think you are getting.  I thought the way they sold their product was very misleading.
032147404X|4.0|Short concise instuctions for the novice at digital photography.  Great helpful hints on flower photography.  I will be looking forward to books 2 and 3.  I started out with black and white with a twin refex cameras in college in the 70's and moved to the 35mm format.  With the advancement  in technology, digital darkrooms can be for photographer to go with full control over your own pictures.  These series of books in the clear, down to earth format of the author, will be helpful for any persons ability.  Highly recommend!
B0000683DH|5.0|Great movie.  Awesome battle scenes and strategy.  Surely one of the greatest films of all time.
B001PPLIFU|2.0|The title of my review pretty much sums it up.  Aside from being convoluted, plodding, and confusing unless you watched the previous movie 5 minutes ago, it's missing all the trappings of what makes James Bond, well, James Bond.    No gadets, no Q, no Moneypenny, etc.    There have been James Bond movies before that I didn't love, but this is the first one I hated.    If you haven't seen the previous film, check it out - it's pretty terrific.  No idea what happened, but they really blew this sequel.
B00005NB8K|5.0|This is the best rock and roll film of all time.  Special thanks to Oliver Stone.  Way to go, The Doors are #1.
1416914307|3.0|Well, the first book in the Mortal Instruments series left me panting for more.  I absolutely LOVED Cassandra Clare's characterizations and particularly loved Jace, who seemed to take all of his anger, rejection issues, lack of family, etc, and turn it into a hard, sarcastic personality.  The more things upset him, the more reckless he would become.  I loved this, because it made his character jump off the page, and made him unique.    Like others though, I failed to see a solid enough connection between him and Clary for why the two fell so hard in love.  Physical attraction and witty banter, while fun, just don't altogether make the type of connection the author was trying to create between them.    The storyline, with the angels and such was very inventive, if not predictable in some areas.    The thing that turned me off the most for this last book in the series though, is that the wit, cynicism, sarcasm and general smartness of the first two books was lacking in this last one.    Jace provided a lot of that in the first two books, and in this last one, his personality completely changed.  Now, instead of his usual hard, sarcastic, reckless reactions when dealing with painful things (such as his love for Clary and how he believed they were sibs and it could never be) he turns into a whiny, emo boy.  I looked forward to him reacting with the anger, sarcasm and wit that he normally reacted with, and instead I got a mopey, sad-sack whiny teenager who dragged around with his head hung low.  While I get that he was upset and felt very low, his personality and way of dealing with hardships should have stayed consistant.  Some hang-doggedness was expected, but not the total about-face his personality took.  It made me painfully aware I was indeed reading a book so that I couldn't get lost in it like I did the previous two.    Clare is a first time author though, and perhaps with subsequent books she will improve.  Still though, I absolutely loved the first two.
B001TOD9VI|5.0|Yep....another Aronofsky movie....another great one. Good to watch him doing something different from The Fountain (a big sci-fi), this one, a smaller more intimate movie. Mickey Rourke should have got the Oscar!!
B001YLWOI0|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this brilliant French comedy when I went to see it at a cinema in NZ. Tracking down a Region 2 copy to watch in the UK, however, proved much more difficult and I was thrilled when I managed to source this one from the US no less. Everything worked superbly and friends were much amused by the crazy antics of the mad men in . . . le Nord!
044024238X|2.0|From the beginning, it's easy to detect your standard Kinsella novel. A successful woman finds herself facing some unexpected change. She falls in love, some bad event happens, they break up, and then a few chapters later, everything's peachy. Now ordinarily, Kinsella puts enough personality into the book that makes it okay, but I don't know, something was just lacking in this one. I felt like some of the characters had great potential, but were ignored, like Freya or Sam's breakdown brother, Peter. There were parts that were so predictable that it got, quite frankly, boring. It's an interesting idea, but everyone knew how it would turn out, and all the flip-flopping in the end was absolutely unnecessary. There was just too much lacking in this book, plotwise, characterwise, just overall, for it to have been a truly enjoyable read.<br /><br />Rating: 2.5/5
B000002ORU|5.0|perfect
B000002J2D|5.0|I owned this album on vinyl for over 25 years but never listened to it. I liked A Trick of the Tail and Wind & Wuthering so much I just couldn't appreciate And Then There Were Three.  However, once I bought the CD in 2009, it became one of my favorite Genesis albums.  It has enough of the old sound before they came the Genesis of the 1980's.  This is perhaps the last of the truly great (and listenable) progressive rock records of the genre.  Definitely worth a listen and a space in your collection.  It's almost like Follow You Follow Me is the odd song on the album, not the other way around.
B000G7PMD2|5.0|perfect
B000003S09|5.0|I was 14 when this album came out.  Back then in late 1969/ early 1970, FM rock was in it's infancy at best.  Like Elvis Presley or the Beatles, every once in a while something comes along that changes all the rules.  Ask anyone who was old enough to listen back then what it felt like the first time they heard In The Court of The Crimson King coming out of their transistor radio.  Words cannot express the awesomeness of the sound of this music (the same can probably be said about Zeppelin's Whole Lot Of Love).  King Crimson was ground-breaking stuff! Court and Epitaph were FM staples for years.  Even today, I Talk To the Wind is one of my favorites.  In the early 2000's The Doves even did a cover of Moonchild!  And finally, here in 2009, I am finally learning to like 21st Century Schizoid Man.  This IS a classic album, from back when albums were albums and record companies didn't dictate what music was supposed to sound like.
B001GKJ2E8|5.0|My husband and I enjoyed the science fiction/action packed storyline and the amazing special effects but the sexual content makes it impossible to watch it with the children.  The DVD arrived in very good condition as advertizes and promptly.  Thank you.
B001XJEKGC|4.0|When reviewing this on CD, I only gave it three stars - - due to what I see as an uninspired set list. I give the DVD four stars instead of three because the visual presentation compensates for the set list. This works much better as a concert film: the camera angles focus on the soloists, and the cameras stay long enough to make you feel like you're there.    But I won't give it five stars, because the performances are interspersed with interview clips. The interviews are informative, but they break the momentum. (Everything said in these clips is also part of the interviews on the second DVD in the set, so they could have left these out of the concert portion.)

B0001XALT6|5.0|MY GRANDSON'S FAVORITE OLDER MOVIE. HAD BEEN LOOKING FOR IT FOR A WHILE AND SHOULD HAVE REALIZED ANYTHING YOU WANT YOU CAN FIND AT AMAZON. IT WAS HERE WITHIN 3 DAYS. I LOVE MY AMAZON ACCOUNT!
B001EYGOEM|5.0|This CD is Great!    Her song writing skills are well beyond her years.  I'm sure we will be hearing more from her in years to come.

B0000025RI|5.0|I'm 23 years old and I grew up listening to Michael Jackson.  Any young person who considers themselves a true fan of music (any person, really) should definitely own this CD...the review is true.  Jackson's voice is at its purest on this CD...this is definitely the height of his career.  People of all ages will have heard the 7 top ten singles on this CD, so there's no need to talk about those...I just want to attest to the fact that the two songs that are not singles, \\"Baby Be Mine\\" and \\"The Lady In My Life,\\" are just as awesome.  \\"Baby Be Mine\\" is a somewhat upbeat dance track - a sweet love track - and \\"The Lady In My Life\\" is a slow ballad tribute to a lover.    Honestly, don't even debate this.  If you're on this page you already know that you need this CD.

B001TODCII|5.0|Liam Neeson is literally back with a vengence.  We've seen Liam in action before, notably so in Rob Roy, and even The Phantom Menace, but never at this level.      At 56 years old, Liam proves he has not lost any of his edge.  One of my favorite aspects of Taken is the realism.  Of course, take that word with a grain of salt as I am talking comparitively.  Compared to other actioners, Taken let's you believe what is happening could really happen.  It is not so over-stylized that, while fun to watch, is not believeable.  THis is due in large part to the coreography of the fights.  Coreographer Olivier Schneider relies heavily on the reality based and brutal martial art of Silat.  Silat is a no-nonsense martial art, with strikes that are meant to stop an attacker in his tracks, not to show off.    This film has been compared a lot to Bourne Identity.  Personally, I think Taken is better; for two reasons.  First, it has more heart, and based on the very serious matter of trafficking.  Second, the action scenes are not edited so quickly that you can't see what is happening.  With Bourne, the fights are edited so quickly that you get the FEEL of action, without actually seeing as much of the techniques.      As mentioned, I appreciate the awareness Taken brings to the very real problem of human trafficking, especially with young girls and the sex trade.  The film is great action with a great story, and made that much better by exposing an important social justice issue.  This is a movie anyone can love, not just action fans.
0385341008|5.0|Our book club read this recently and out of the twelve of us, we all loved it!  I highly recommend this book!
B000NQRR1Q|5.0|As other reviewers have stated, this is not your modern computer-generated-image horror story with out of this world screen monsters.  Instead, we get a great adult horror/suspense film which should keep you glued to the screen.  Subtle imagery and plot twists make this film extremely easy to recommend.    I love this movie and have played it over several times.  The vision from Polanski is almost as good as \\"Chinatown.\\"  Well, almost anyway.  So sit back, get out the popcorn and don't miss a scene.  You'll be well rewarded.  Highly recommended.
B0007MWZEK|5.0|It picks up dirt/dust really easy and fast.  Tray is easy to remove to dump dirt out. But the brushes are harder to clean.  Have not experienced any battery or handle problems.  Make sure the battery is removed after each use.  Overall, this is a handy product to have.
0307278255|1.0|This is not a new book.  It combines the Interpreter of Maladies and parts of the Namesake.  How about telling your customers that they are not buying a new book.
1419818120|5.0|Lake House: I was very happy that I could even get this movie. I  thought it probably wasn't available any more.  It was in great shape and well packaged when I received it I have already it. I have watched it 2 times since I received it.  Thanks so much Amazon for having what I needed this time and many other times.
B000002HJR|5.0|\\"NOLA\\" is an album of incredible consistency, where every song is a great one and the entire album flows perfectly. The album combines Southern rock with sludge metal and some melodic traces that flow nicely throughout to create an amazing song. Phil Anselmo is at the top of his game, belting out his signature vocals with passion and power. The lyrics accompany the feel of the music, as well. But what blows me out of the water is the GUITAR TONE! Holy smokes alive, the tone of the guitar is absolutely perfect. Crushing but not harsh, chugging but in an old-school way, and the perfect mix of high-end and low-end. As a musician myself, this album probably has my favorite guitar tone of many albums in the metal genre. It sounds great when they band rips into its amazing guitar solos too, which are plentiful here.    Standout tracks are the opening, grooving \\"Temptation's Wings\\", with a passionate, southern-styled solo. Then comes the equally as catchy, bludgeoning riff-rocker of \\"Lifer\\". \\"Pillars of Eternity\\" opens with some great drumming and goes once again into great riffs and solos. But what is probably my favorite track on the album is \\"Eyes of the South\\". In standard B-tuning, down two-and-a-half whole steps, the band plays a song that's equally as crushing as it is beautiful. The opening guitar solo is outstanding, going into a gigantic riff, with more melodic solos and a beautiful, clean section in the middle. Absolutely beautiful. Then back to the huge, crushing riffs to end this 5-minute masterpiece.    The band also shows more of its softer side with the straight-up Southern rock of \\"Stone The Crow\\". A heartbreakingly beautiful performance is given here, with melodic, complex riffs, passionate vocals and somber lyrics that make this moodier, sullen song just as great as others. However, the band picks it up to their energetic, monstrous sound with the seven-minute epic closer of \\"Bury Me In Smoke\\", with more B-tuned guitars that will get you up on your feetand banging your head.    Overall, this is one of the best metal albums of the '90s, a true classic in the styles of bands such as Black Sabbath and Lynyrd Skynyrd, but more modernized. You really can't go wrong with this album if you're looking for a heavy album full of awesome riffs, melodic passages and solos, and a thick, southern twang. This album surely delivers the anthemic \\"cruising down the highway\\" sort of loud vibe one could hope for, especially for a summer blast through the stereo! Thanks for the time, and peace.
B000KGGLCU|5.0|I have not had the pleasure of attending a Madonna concert. However thanks to this DVD I felt like I was there front and center. I was exhausted by the end. The concert is high energy from start to finish. The close up and far shots are awesome. I have an HD flat panel 45\\" TV with surround sound and it was like I was there in the crowd. Thanks for making it possible for me to enjoy a live conert in the comfort of my own home. Get it you won't regret it!! I will enjoy watching this one over and over again.
0385341008|5.0|I have to rate this book as one of my all time favorites! Like so many others have said, it leaves me with a warm glow and desire to step into this world. I really did not want the book to end - I did not want to depart from the wonderful world of Guernsey, where I almost felt part of the village. The writing style was very engaging, and the character development unfolded with a sense of innocence of place and time. Yet, I also felt the fresh pain of scars caused by war - still poignant and relevant. The story takes place in the shadow of WWII, but it is a timeless story. I was very saddened to read about the author and her recent passing. She had a very special talent.
B000002J1S|5.0|A brilliant work instrumentally, lyrically and vocally, The Lamb shows Genesis at their creative best. The intricate and complex storyline and accompanying music are truly outstanding. They pulled everything off so well. I can listen to this album innumerable times and never tire of it. That's a mark of greatness, right?
B001TODCII|5.0|Not a great fan of excessive violence - and there's plenty in this one - but Neeson was worth all the money for the movie on his own.  Non-stop tension, fast but economical movement, emotional tug (estranged father vindicated, but he never says \\"I told you so\\"); moral superiority of the hero (\\"get my little girl back\\") overcomes some reservations we might have over a few foibles (can't stop killing people).  They're the baddies after all. Great evening's escapism.
B00164KYV4|1.0|This movie has a great cast BUT that is all that is great about it. Let me just say I'm so glad I rented this movie before buying it because it was super boring. The movie goes back and forth between a bunch of different couples and single people and their problems and mishaps but it seems more like a horrible documentary to me. Througout each \\"stage\\" you have words that pop up on the screen and then you have random people talk about their real relationship like a documentary. The movie was NOT funny at all and it was really really boring. It switched between people way too quickly and it was just a bunch of people throwing themselves at each other. You had a crazy woman that threw herself at every guy she seen, you had the husband that was cheating on his wife with another woman that was in her own relationship, you had the woman who broke up with her boyfriend because he wouldn't marry her after 7 years, etc. I wanted to turn it off within the first 30 mins BUT I sat it through and I really wish I wouldn't of.    This movie does show what people go through in relationships but who wants to watch a \\"documentary\\" on every one else's relationship? If you have been in a relationship or you are in one now you have already \\"seen\\" this movie so to speak.    Again this movie had an amazing cast BUT that is the end of it. There was nothing else great about this movie. I was really expecting a lot more out of it and I was TRULY disappointed. Do not waste you money on this movie. It will put you to sleep.
0374139563|5.0|This is a really great book that has been written about a lot. Especially on one of my favorite sites that explores the ethical and philosophical arguments behind the morality of world hunger and poverty: [...] . Check it out, and then buy this book!
B000SZHCIA|5.0|How did I miss this performer all these years!  I stumbled upon him only recently and am enraptured by his style and class.  I might have a new best friend forever, if I could get over my obsession for Leonard Cohen.
0307408833|5.0|Myself and many members of my family are Gluten Free but we still love our treats.  Love this cookbook it gives us Gluten Free and replacements for using sugar so it is a healthier treat.  Fun read and picking out what you wish to try next!!!!!!
B001RTP48G|5.0|This may be there best effort in a long career.  I really enjoyed it.
B00000JLWW|1.0|If ever there was a film which should have been whittled down to a 25 minute all action/no nonsense cut, it's Titanic. As for the remaining 2 and a half hours, well, those reels should have been stored on the mother of all boats, and set on a collision course with the nearest sizable iceberg...
B0026JWDQW|5.0|I liked this way better than his first and I liked his first. If todays top 40 floats your boat this is probably not for you.  It is an aquired taste in a sense that it is not what all the \\"teeny boppers\\" are listening to.  If you love  Otis, The Chieftans, Van Morrison, Mike Scott, Louis Armstrong, Willie Nelson, Lonnie Donegan.. All those then this is up your alley. He may not be as great yet, but he does a wonderful job of tipping his hat to music's greats.
B00003CXTG|1.0|After watching Pearl Harbor, I found it impossible to determine which crime was more atrocious: the bombing of Pearl Harbor or the creation of the saccharin film. Are Hideki Tojo and Hirohito any worse than Michael Bay and Ben Affleck? History will judge.
B001CD6FKI|1.0|Throughout the whole film the bright, flashy colors made me fear that I would have a seizure or something! The film is kinda slow at first and there is a lot of unnecesary dialogue.  Kids will probably leave during those long sequences of talking and hopefully come back during the rare moments of action.  I give it a 1 star because it was painful to watch and the only thing that was really entertaining to me was the hot guy who played Speed(also who names their kid Speed?)
0345495004|4.0|a novel based on the historic, scandalous love affair between Mamah Borthwick Cheney and Frank Lloyd Wright, from Oak Park to Paris, Berlin, Italy and Taliesin. Mamah left behind 2 children, Frank left 6. The reality of a woman controlling her life evolves alongside Wright's: as she accepts the price she has paid for her freedom, his own art matures from prairie style architecture to the design in Spring Green, one that nestles a building into its surroundings.
B001ED7C58|5.0|I am a big Twilight fan and wanted to have the soundtrack to keep the characters around after the books were completed and the movie was over. This soundtrack in it's entirety has proven to be a favorite of mine and I would highly recommend it to any Twilight fan or any fan of great music!
1594481938|4.0|four depressed souls meet for the first time on a roof on New Year's Eve; each is contemplating suicide. Maureen has a severely disable son; Jess has been jilted (we can easily see why); JJ has lost his girl and his band; Martin is just released from prison for sex with a 15-yr-old girl. This is a black comedy with twisty roads and cul-de-sacs leading to vacation in Tenerife and an \\"intervention\\" in Starbucks. An inventive 90 days with excellent dialog and redeeming characters.
B0000AOV85|5.0|If you love this record as I do, and if you want some understanding of the ingredients and experiences that made it was it is, you'll probably be delighted, as I am.     I'm confused as to what those who diss this disc were expecting. Alan Parsons is in the studio soloing tracks to explain the details that make these songs so unique. He shows how the cash register tape-loop on \\"Money\\" was recorded, chopped up, strung together and stretched around the studio. These are the elements that create extraordinary music, and we get to see the great musicians and studio geniuses recounting how those elements were made and integrated into the record. What else would one want and why the glum reviews ? I'm a musician and I love every minute of the \\"classic albums\\" series that I've seen.
1416562605|5.0|a boy from the caste of sweet-makers is screwed out of his scholarship but cunningly manages to become a driver for a wealthy landlord. He watches and learns the system, from the Rooster Coop of the serving class to the bribery of the ruling class and, when the time is right, he makes an opportunity, takes the money and runs. A look at modern India from the bottom-up, one that excludes the incense and romance of so much Indian fiction and focuses on the feces in the rivers and streams of society. Darwin-esque. Probably not for everyone.
B000002I6T|5.0|David Crosby displays, in virtuoso depth, why he was so vital to the finest bands ( The Byrds, Crosby Stills & Nash, and CSN Derivstives forward) of the time. This is ethereal, heartfelt music from the greatest tenor voice of the sixties. His restless musical vision is given free reign here, and he communes with like-minded spirits such as Joni Mitchell, Grace Slick, Jerry Garcia, Neil Young, etc. to produce an album of staggeringly beautiful resonance..   Some of the songs seem quite impromptu and one-take free-form...others a bit more finely crafted, but never losing an emotional freeform that is unheard of in music since 1975.   Relax, unwind, and LISTEN.   This is an album that captures a communal moment in time (Hippie, post Kent State Massacre 1970), and unconciously maps out a survival mentality. How many other albums can give you that? A vision of personal thought and freedom, 'If I Could Only Remember My Name\\", will be either more greatly appreciated by our technology-encumbered descenendents, or banned by the same. It stands in stark contrast to the oppression that time. productivity, and technology unknowingly demand of society going forward. As I write this ,there are 105 reviews of this record. and it has a 5.0 average review.   This is the real deal.
B000NPLFZG|5.0|1963 novel, somewhat dated style and a tad melodramatic BUT the insight into Rodin's various sculptures and the overview of his life makes this an interesting read. Living a few blocks from Philadelphia's Rodin Museum and having been to his Paris museum, I am a devotee of the Gates of Hell, the Burghers of Calais, the Hand of God, Adam, Eve, Balzac and The Thinker. To \\"be there at the creation\\" was splendid; to learn about the critics' initial reactions was instructional. I can't wait to go back and pore over the figures' details after reading the book.
B0001GMIOE|5.0|I am a professional photographer.  Every one of the eight non-Canon brand batteries I have (four different brands)outlived their warranties by only a few days. None of the six Canon brand batteries I own have ever given me any problem of any kind. One of my Canon Batteries is at least four years old and still performs beautifully.  I will never buy a non-Canon battery for my Canon camera again.
0743204360|4.0|I had never read any books by Steven King, but I really enjoyed On Writing....a Memoir.    Held my interest, well written.   Makes me want to read his other books now.
630460291X|5.0|Great Video....perfect condition!  The movie is awesome, a classic! Combines humor with a love story.
B00005JN2Z|5.0|I received the DVD promptly and it was in excellent condition.  No problems at all.
0385341008|3.0|A Chicago book critic reviewed this book and said it was a \\"must read\\".  The history of the people during the German occupation was very well served as was the character studies of all.  The author moves the story along briskly, but I felt I had read this book before.  I would not recommend it as a \\"must read\\", but it is a good summer book.
0143038583|5.0|If you are the least bit interested in what you put on your digestive system and live in the US, this book is a must read. I have adopted new behaviors when selecting my food in the supermarket thanks to this book, and I'm a far more informed consumer now.
B001PPLIEG|5.0|This is the second movie to star Daniel Craig as James Bond. Though it is not as great as the first movie Casino Royale, it is still a wonderful movie in the series. I remember my first reaction on hearing Daniel Craig was going to be the new Bond, I remember thinking \\"He's not even cute and definitely not suave.\\" After the first movie, actually only ¼ of the way through, I was captivated and hooked. In this movie \\"Quantum of Solace,\\" the events start on a few hours after the ending of Casino Royale. The movie starts with an action sequence that involves M. The action scenes are stellar, the plot is as usual an evil person wanting to take over the world. The Sean Connery and Roger Moore's depiction of James Bond was a smooth, suave, lady's man; Coolness personified. The Bond movies featuring Craig are darker and delve deeper into the character and intelligence of Bond. Craig as Bond is totally believable as an agent for an intelligence agency. He's smart, sexy, dangerous and lethal.<br /><br />I hope they have Mr. Craig signed to play Bond into eternity. I just can't imagine anyone doing such a fantastic job of turning this franchise of such a loved character on it's head and being better than it's predecessors.
B001Q8MMGU|5.0|Great comedy love story, which has a meaning, that age doesn't matter when you fall in love.  Prompt delievery, excellent service!
B000W7JWUA|5.0|We haven't played a board game in years, but this one we couldn't get enough of.  Easy to learn, enough strategy to keep you coming back repeatedly.
159102594X|3.0|Can't say I loved this but it was better than other recent reads. Instead of writing a full review now, I'm going to read the next one, and then come back to this review. Hopefully it gets better. Hopefully.
159448385X|5.0|Wonderful read!  I couldn't put this down.  As soon as I finished it, I went right out and bought The Kite Runner.  Needless to say, it was another 5 stars.
B001QOOCTE|5.0|Not only is this a terrific collection of music, but the idea behind it is inspirational!
0316017922|1.0|I've read \\"The Tipping Point\\" and \\"Blink,\\" both of which did a MUCH better job than \\"Outliers\\" of actually raising interesting questions. At one point, Gladwell just recounts minute-by-minute details of plane crashes and thwarted crashes.      Gladwell is desperately trying to elicit some of those similar \\"very interesting\\" moments that come from his other books.  But, unfortunately, \\"Outliers\\" is just a rushed, bloated book of stale stories and failed attempts to suggest patterns of success (and failure) beyond what's already obvious.
B000002L7Y|5.0|I love the 80's and most people only know \\"Take on me\\" but this whole CD is great. I had it a long time ago and it was so scratched from me playing it all the time I had to replace it. A MUST HAVE!

I was dissappointed, sounded like the Beatles were doing heavy drugs at the time of the release of this album. With the exception of a few known hits, the rest of the album is a waste.  I wish I could return it for the Best of the Moody Blues! - RB

0143038419|5.0|I read this book because a friend recommended it.  I really didn't expect much.  I had heard so much hype about it, I thought surely I would be disappointed thinking that books talked up so much rarely live up to expectations.    I was hooked from the first sentence.  I am a total foodie, so I really enjoyed her gastronomic tour through Italy.  When she left Italy, I thought I wouldn't enjoy the next sections, but I was so wrong.  This whole book was wonderful.
B000002KXV|5.0|One of my all time favorite cd's. I've heard probably everything by Fagen, Becker, Steely Dan, and yet this cd is my fave. It's dark, bright, complex and simple. Not a bad tune on the cd. How often can you say that about an album?
0441017177|4.0|Six million years ago, Abigail Gentian formed her clan the House of Flowers by cloning herself into a thousand male and female shatterlings.  She assigns her \\"children\\" to travel separately across the galaxy as observers of sentient life-forms.  Every two hundred thousand years they are to come home to report on what they watched.  The Gentian House has become the wealthiest in the known universe as each child performs their mission diligently.<br /><br />However, this time something has gone wrong after so many successful spins of the galaxy wheel.  The gathering has not occurred on time as someone is killing Abigail's clones.  Worse than death, two shatterlings, Campion and Purslane, have broken the forbidden taboos; not only have they failed to report being five decades late, they have traveled together and fallen in love.  Each understands that if their mother learns of their transgression, they will die.  However, even before they decide about Mother, the pair realizes that an adversary is murdering their sisters and brothers as they journey home, but death rides with them.<br /><br />Most of the tale focuses on the dangerous journey home by Campion and Purslane as they have broken other rules especially with a failure to deliver to the family information super library Vigilance and the effort to rescue siblings.  This pair finding companionship and love turn Abigail's inhuman clones into humans as the need to belong and the willingness to sacrifice are traits the shatterlings never had before.  Alternating first person between Campion and Purslane (and at times Abigail) seems unnecessary as they are together and their viewpoints almost identical.  Still although some fans will miss the vastness of space and time author trademarks that are only hinted at in HOUSE OF SUNS, readers will enjoy this intriguing science fiction thriller as the lead couple goes where no shatterling (or Alastair Reynolds) has gone before with the help of Hesperus the robot they journey to the heart of the galaxy.<br /><br />Harriet Klausnerto the heart of the galaxy.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner
B001FB4VZS|5.0|I think this was the best of all seasons I have watched until now.Because,<br />episodes were great and actors really did a good job in episodes.For example,Legion rocked because we got the chance to see the Legion of SuperHeroes and the episode's plot was really good.Stiletto was really great ,too because the Intergang member mob was really good at acting,also seeing Lois in superhero costume was funny and sexy, too.But my favorite episode in the whole season was Infamous because we got the chance to see the future of Clark's superhero identity and learnt the reaction of Lois to Clark's famous SECRET.Although the ending was a little bit sad ,the episode was great.I recommend this dvd set to the all fans of Smallville.
0545123267|5.0|The Well Read Child said it all. I couldn't put it down from the moment I opened the beautifully illustrated front cover.<br /><br />Grace, a pragmatic, strong willed and independent teenager, has watched the wolves from a distance for six years following their attack on her one cold winter's day when she was a girl.  There is one wolf, with sad yellow eyes, that she feels particularly drawn to.<br /><br />Sam doesn't just become a boy trapped in wolf skin at the first sign of winters icy chill.  He becomes a wolf, a tortured shell of his human self with wild and unpredictable instincts.  When he finally meets Grace, the girl he's been watching from the woods, he fights to stay human to be with her but winter tugs at his vulnerable skin and threatens to take him away from her forever.<br /><br />The book is told from both Sam and Grace.  The transition is easy to follow and both characters are so unique and strong in their realism that there is no confusion as to who is speaking.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book, not only to those with a love of the supernatural, but to anyone looking for a good fantasy with a soft romantic element.<br /><br />-L.J.

B001FB4W0W|5.0|When I first heard about True Blood coming to HBO I decided to give it a chance and boy am I glad that I did. Ever since the exit of Buffy the Vampire Slayer of which I watched as a teenager, I have been unable to find anything remotely close or equally as interesting.<br /><br />If you haven't watched True Blood season 1 I highly recommend that you do before the season 2 premiere on Sunday June 14th. Also, this show is based on the novels written by Charlaine Harris known as the Sookie Stackhouse Books. I am currently midway through the 4th book of the 10 novel set so far. I truly recommend both watching the show and reading the novels as they are equally engaging and well done.<br /><br />(This is the very first time I've left a comment on anything so I hope it helps some of you out in regards of whether to purchase the series dvd's or novel set.)
B001F1YBPI|5.0|Never written a review for any product, when I could open a DVD distribution center myself from my collection--it would take quite an earthquake for me to do so--this DVD did it.

B0015DYIH2|3.0|Ok. I went through ALL the reviews for this book and I think I just developed a very permanant scowl. I feel sorry for the writer at this point,Was she in too much of a hurry that she FORGOT what she wrote in the other 3 books? Was there too much pressure not only from the fans but the publishing company that she felt the need to essentially screw over ALL THE FANS? What the hell happened? It really isn't too much too hope or expect a really great ending to a series that spawned her career, is it? Maybe WE fans became too needy in that what we hoped for and thought was coming would be tasteful and GOOD! I have read other authors that make a series work IN THE RIGHT WAY. That the characters and story actually make sense. Sure there might be a FEW clunkers along the way but this just goes WAY beyond that. I am now going to beg and plead that this particular book GET RE-WRITTEN!! Not only do US fans deserve a better book, but so do ALL THE CHARACTERS!! Shame on you Stephanie Meyer, Shame on you for bowing to the pressure and NOT even care!
B001FB4W0W|4.0|Lets make this a short to the point review as I'm a firm believer in giving the scoop and cutting the crap out.  The HBO series is not as good as the books of course.  Way to much Tara and why is she such a big part of the first season?  In the book she just runs a boutique.  They could have picked a better Bill, to much looking up from his head always being down, geez.  Sam is okay.  Eric should be prettier, the book says he is but at least they picked someone tall.  The sheriff is perfect. Pam, good choice.  Way to much Jason who should also have been taller.  Anna Paquin is the best choice Ball made, however she needs to be just a tudge more sassier.     The setting for Bon Temps couldn't be better and is exactly how I pictured it would be.  Perhaps Ball should have focused more on Bill and Sookie's relationship with Fangtashia.  It was Eric who got into trouble from the \\"bartender\\" episode not Bill.  Sorry, just felt the story line could have been truer to the book and not sacrificed anything.  But hey, what do I know I'm just a viewer.     One of my burning questions for Hollywood, why does it seem that all male actors are short? Not that there's anything wrong with that.  Are they easier to film?  Is the height ratio between male and female actors better for camera angles?    After all of that, I did enjoy the series and yes I'll continue to do so as it is rather fun to see them come to life.

038533348X|5.0|I first read this book when I was 12. My father gave it to me. He is a man of science and always quoted from it or praised it's subtlety and lifelong lessons that dwelt within. I didn't really understand it when I first read it. I picked it up a few weeks ago after my semester ended and blew through it in a single night. It isn't very long and can be conquered in a single sitting. I actually recommend reading it in one shot because the voices of each character will resonate more if they remain fresh.     The sly humor and unique language of the book is it's greatest reward. Vonnegut has the rare gift of allowing the reader to engage in the subject matter even if it is heavily scientific or partially obscured by an intellectual layer that might be harder to penetrate if not for Vonnegut's expert hands.     It's really impossible to describe any part of the plot without spoiling anything for a future reader. I'll just say this: you'll comprehend the limits of the human mind, heart, and the intricacies of the scientific stratum long after you turn the final page. A modern classic.

B001JEDR6U|5.0|This book is worth reading for anyone who takes their craft seriously. There are many gems hidden in this thin yet timeless rulebook. In my opinion, the most invaluable portion of the text deals with the construction of dialogue and paragraph organization. The book encourages the writer about revision and forces the writer to confront many difficult aspects of writing that are easy to sidestep but detract from the overall quality of the work.<br /><br />Upon finishing the book you are guaranteed to be bothered anytime you read a line like: \\"I'm pissed,\\" John said angrily. You will know that \\"angrily\\" doesn't need to be there, especially if the author has paid attention to character construction and mood. The book equips the author with sharpened tools that were probably missing from the \\"toolbox\\" that Stephen King referred to when recommending this text in his own book about the craft of writing.<br /><br />I have discovered that my writing is smoother and I've started to \\"omit needless words\\" before they even appear on the page. I didn't really know what my style of writing was before I picked up this book. It's a difficult thing to learn in a classroom setting and is something that is discovered by the individual over a long period of time. I can say with certainty that this book helped me find that style.
B0027P77CU|5.0|On my first listen, I wasn't sure what to think.  I'm a huge DT fan, with my favorite albums being Ziltoid and Terria.    So I listened a second and third time, and now I believe it to be his best album to date.      Ki is a less aggressive than most of his previous work, but that isn't a negative.  You'll still get plenty of the big guitars and lots of classic Devin Townsend screaming.    Seriously, nobody can scream better than this guy.    Highly recommended.  Easy five stars.

After reading the negative reviews I realised that the books would not appeal to everyone understandably;however these books can easily be read as suspense and spy thrillers as the plots and sub-plots and deals and double-deals and crossings and double-crossings are the sinews and bones of the books.The other dimensions of the books are the building of the cathedral and the bridge.  Its full of politics and the dealings underhand of the Church and the brought to life everyday towns people.  Well done Mr.Follett!!

This book is much better. I like how he goes into detail about the looks hes done.

B001HN697M|3.0|I am a total fan of the Underworld story and they all have that Romeo and Juliet story line, but....this fell a bit short to me.     They show Lucien and Sonja \\"in love\\" but it's sort of rushed. It was missing a \\"feeling\\" of \\"I would die for you type of love\\" although it was mentioned a few times. The connection was lacking passion.     Too many CGI lycans not enough practical effects. It was a distraction.    Perfect casting though...I mean really! Except for the obvious, Craven (Shane Brolly)  missing, he would have added some edge to the story.  Besides he was so much \\"brooding\\" fun in the first movie.    Wish it had been as good as the first ...but they rarely are.  Although, I have only seen it once and it may warrant revisiting based on other reviews.

B0025X4P24|4.0|Vanessa Williams returns with her first (non-Christmas) CD of mostly original recordings since her 1997 \\"Next\\" album. Produced by Babyface, Rex Rideout, Keith Thomas and Rob Mathes (her guitar player), this album is different from previous offerings in that this time around, VW ventures into Latin rhythms and jazz with a \\"Big Band\\" influence.     That's not a bad thing at all, since VW definitely has the voice and the talent for this type of music, and since most of her earlier albums contained at least one Brazilian-style or jazzy song on it (e.g. \\"Betcha Never\\"), this just seems to be consistent with her style these days. No, this is not \\"The Right Stuff\\" or \\"The Comfort Zone\\", this is \\"The Real Thing\\" so some fans may have a hard time diggin' this music. VW is now a mature, successful and accomplished singer & actress, so there's no need to make dance music sampling \\"New Jack\\" beats and Keith Sweat songs as was the case in 1988 when she had to compete with Janet Jackson, Vesta, Angela Winbush, Shanice Wilson and others to obtain a hit. To VW, these songs are more personal and emotional, not what's commercially expedient. Not to say that VW has abandoned R&B/dance music completely, it seems that's just not where she's focused at this point in her musical career.     This music is great for jazz-standard fans. Vanessa's voice sounds great, the band is tight and the music is soothing. But the downside is that some of the songs towards the end of the album are just not that interesting. These are not songs that you will be humming in your head all day long. This isn't a fantastic CD, but it's not a throw-away either. It's just a little different. If you're a die-hard VW fan like me, and if you like Latin-jazz, you'll enjoy most of these songs.     Best tracks are:  Breathless (reminiscent of VW's signature R&B sound)  Hello Like Before (a light tango and a Bill Withers cover/composition)  Loving You (a Big-Band-Billie-Holiday-ish tune co-written by Babyface)  Just Friends (very nice mid-tempo song written by Babyface)  The Real Thing (a salsa w/ Latin-flavored horns, written by Stevie Wonder)  Lazy Afternoon (a jazz standard, although I prefer Patti Austin's version)  Close To You (very nice w/ a breezy acoustic guitar and violins)    Enjoy \\"The Real Thing\\"!
B000063DIR|1.0|You already knew that the original recordings of BLIZZARD OF OZZ and DIARY OF A MADMAN are essential classics of the heavy metal genre.  And you already know that the one-star ratings I and everyone else have given are for the 2002 re-recordings (and that's what they are, not \\"remasters,\\" \\"re-releases\\" or \\"re-issues\\").  All of the reviewers before me have already done a fine job of explaining why you need to stay far away from the 2002 CD editions.  Suffice it to say that if Miley Cyrus and the Jonas Brothers were to remake those albums, the results would probably be no worse musically than the 2002 editions and they'd be infinitely less morally repellent.    If you don't already have BLIZZARD and MADMAN on CD, go hunt down the 1995 CD editions, which were 22-bit super-bit-mapped remasters of the original recordings with the original mixes and the original bass and drum tracks by Bob Daisley and Lee Kerslake respectively.      If you're in a major metropolitan area, they shouldn't be that hard to find in a used CD store (and if you go this route, check the cover art -- I'll get to that in a moment.)   Otherwise, you can always look for them on eBay.  If you do this, don't bid before you email the seller!  Ask him or her the following questions:       -- Who is credited on bass and drums in the CD booklet?  If the seller tells you that the bassist and drummer credited in the CD liner notes is Robert Trujillo and Mike Bordin, then run far away!  (On the original recording of DIARY OF A MADMAN, the liner notes credit Tommy Aldridge and Rudy Sarzo, even though it was actually Daisley and Kerslake who played.)     -- Ask the seller to list the tracks on each album.  The 2002 re-releases added a bonus track to each album.  If BLIZZARD OF OZZ has a tenth track called \\"You Lookin' at Me Lookin' at You\\" or DIARY OF A MADMAN has a ninth track which is a live version of \\"I Don't Know,\\" then those are the 2002 re-releases.  Trust me, the extra bonus tracks aren't worth the desecration that Ozzy and Sharon wreaked on the original recordings.    -- Also ask the seller whether or not the original cover art takes up the entire CD booklet cover. If he/she says yes, then it's either (1) the defiled 2002 re-recordings or (2) the original early-'80s CD editions, which have the original recordings but also the kind of shoddy sound that you get from any CD made at the time.  In the 1995 remasters, the original cover art does not take up the whole booklet;  it's shrunken down and placed in the center surrounded by a blue or green background, with big yellow \\"OZZY\\" letters running down the side.    Good luck hunting. If you call yourself a heavy metal fan, you absolutely must have both BLIZZARD OF OZZ and DIARY OF A MADMAN in your collection, as those two recordings are essential classics of the genre. But absolutely make sure you get the original recordings with Bob Daisley and Lee Kerslake, and not the reprehensible re-recordings with Mike Bordin and Robert Trujillo.

He tells the reader to replace themselves with operational systems instead of good people. If you are looking for a vision of what you should be doing, this is the book for you. It inspired me many years ago to build a better business. But I had to figure out how to do it on my own. George Hedley, Author of \\"Get Your Business To Work!\\"
0762434279|1.0|It has always amazed and eluded me to see many of the worst books on the market for Real Estate and other forms of investing are \\"best sellers\\".  Kiyosaki like Donald Trump are both examples of good marketing and motivational self professed guru's that offer poor advice.  In this book, Kiyosaki's attempts to pass off his fictitious life story of lessons learned as a work of non-fiction.  To add insult to injury, he gives financial advice throughout the book that is ridiculous and in some cases criminal.    Everyone who gave 5 stars to this book either has a financial incentive to do so, or has no clue that they have been duped by another B.S. artist.  I highly recommend searching for John T. Reed's review of Rich Dad, Poor Dad.

032147404X|5.0|The humor and information contained in this book has you glued to the pages from the start.    If you are serious about photography and have a desire to learn as much as possible as quickly as possible then this is your book.    I left photography many years ago after several years as a accomplished shooter with a 35mm.  I was often hired for events and weddings.    I recently decided to return but the world of digital is vastly different then film.  I am a fast paced learner who wants the facts.  This book provided just that.  Every page was a package of insight.  It got to the point with tools and tricks and the mixing of humor kept it light and enjoyable.    If your looking for an in depth study of digital photography than this isn't the book for you.  If you want it fast and to the point so you can get back to shooting more successfully, then this is your book.
1423101499|5.0|Riordan's fourth book in the series is amazing.  It is as fresh and exciting as the first book.  Percy, Annabeth, Tyson, and Grover begin another quest.  This one takes them into the underground - through Daedalus' labyrinth: an ever-changing, magical place with new monsters and terrors galore.  What's happening to Luke will amaze you. I had more questions than ever when I finished the book, and I'm going to order The Last Olympian NOW!!!  Be sure to read this one - it's one of the best!

0345409671|2.0|I'm sad to say that this is the first Anne Rice book that I REALLY disliked.  From the first moment I picked up Interview With the Vampire I became a crazy Anne Rice fan and I loved every one of her books that I read since.  It took me forever to get through Memnoch the Devil; I started reading it about a year ago and then put it down because I couldn't stand all of the religious drivel.  I finally decided that I had read enough of the series that I needed to finish it no matter how painful it was.  I personally don't want to read a story that revolves so entirely around the Christian religion, as I happen to be an atheist.  Putting my dislike for religion aside, this book felt preachy.  Memnoch talked for far too long about his speculation on evolution, the nature of human beings, theology, and every other monotonous detail of the Christian religion.  My only consolation was that by the end of the book Lestat still hated god and the devil though I would have preferred that they had remained out of the story altogether.  I only read this book so that I could understand the rest of the story, even though I thought it was extremely boring.  I makes me truly sad to know that Anne Rice has since gone on to become Catholic and write about Christ in earnest.  I would definitely NOT recommend this book even for Anne Rice fans, it isn't worth it!
B001M5UDGS|4.0|I loved the show, and was eager to watch it in higher quality than a Hulu stream.  However, watching the disc again tonight, I noticed that the Left and Right audio channels seem to be reversed.  For example, when Penny and Captain Hammer are singing together in \\"A Man's Gotta Do\\", Penny is in the rightmost part of the shot, yet her voice is coming from the Left channel!  The same thing at the end of \\"My Eyes\\" - Billy is on the left side of the screen and Penny on the right, but Billy's voice is on the Right channel and Penny's on the Left.  I've tried it on several DVD players, and get the same results.  Are all the discs like this, or did I just get a wierd copy?
B001JRB16U|5.0|This is a really nice movie. My 5 year daughter and 3 year old son love to watch this movie over and over again. This is a true classic that anyone should have in his kids DVD collection.
0385341008|4.0|I enjoyed this book from start to finish. It reminded me of books that I read when I was a girl. No guns, violence, suicides, all of the scenarios used to sell books these days. I could read it before I fell asleep and not have nightmares.
B000GCFY0I|5.0|I picked up Uglies because it was a bestseller and it was recommended to me. After around 20 pages, I was hooked and devoured the rest of it. Soon after I bought the sequel and read the whole series very quickly.    Set in the future, Uglies is a suspensful story about an almost 16 year old girl named Tally who is anxiously awaiting the arrival of her birthday. This is when she will get a special operation to make her pretty. She soon discovers that she doesn't want to become pretty. Instead, Tally joins a rebel group called &#34;the Smoke&#34; and meets new people, discovers new things, and gets wiser about the world.    I would recommend Uglies to any pre-teens or teenagers ages 10 and up who enjoy a suspensful, fun to read science fiction novel.
B00006AW2G|5.0|I am writing this so others won't feel ripped off like I did. This is NOT a Hybrid SACD - it does use the SACD tech (DSD), but is no better than the CD layer of a hybrid. This is VERY GOOD remaster - Monkey Man, which I always thought sounded flat - is now rich and full. but I repeat this is NOT SACD quality as was advertised in the description. Hopefully they will correct this error soon. And I guess I should say this is one of the top four of the Stones albums !!! Buy it if ypu're NOT looking for an SACD disc.
B001HYX3IY|4.0|Great insight into how European and Asian cultures became dominant. Deepened my appreciation for geography, and environment that dictated the circumstance of how cultures progressed.  There's a bit more science detail than I enjoy, but it certainly adds to the credibility of the theory.
0517548232|5.0|I can't add much to the other reviews, except to express a desire that people who want to talk about economics on public forums should at least have read this book, or Sowell's \\"Basic Economics.\\"  Just that one little desire!<br /><br />Then we would not have ill-informed citizens and voters declaring that \\"the economy is all about jobs and full employment.\\"  That's actually wrong.  The economy is all about producing goods and services that other people want.  You can get to \\"full employment\\" with a Nazi slave society, folks, or with a public make-works project that accomplishes nothing.<br /><br />Then we would not have ill-informed citizens and voters declaring that the government must subsidize General Motors.  Or Citibank. Or anybody else!<br /><br />I can summarize this book's one lesson quite briefly: \\"bad economics always focuses on the good effects of a government policy towards one particular special-interest group.\\" (Translate: Obama's \\"porkfest\\" bill.) \\"Good economics looks further: it looks, first, to the effect of that policy on 'the forgotten man' --- to the person who is NOT a beneficiary of the policy.\\" (That would be us taxpayers, stuck with a bill for a trillion dollars.) \\"Second, it looks at the long-term effects of that policy.\\" (That would be \\"another day older, and deeper in debt.\\")<br /><br />Speaking just for myself, I find it amazing that the current resident in the White House and his team have apparently never read this book.
B000NQRR1Q|1.0|The movie looked like it was fine, but when I played it made this horrendous noise and started vibrating. I am going to exchange it , but I will be getting another copy of it. I love this movie!
B0018QOIXU|5.0|I bought this cd after she won at the Grammy's and from track 1 to the very end, Adele's 19 does not disappoint! From track to track, her voice paired with the medoly make for a great listen. Buy this album and you will never regret it!
143911000X|3.0|Being an avid fan of the show I had to have this book.  As amusing as Barney Stinson is on the show I halfway expected more (didn't expect a whole lot).  I enjoyed the book but it left me wondering why I spent money on it.
B0000025T6|5.0|This CD was purchased for the original versions of \\"Open All Night\\" and \\"Reason To Believe\\".     I am not fond of Springsteen CD's without the E Street Band but this CD displays some of his best lyrical work.
0307346617|4.0|i would NOT consider myself much of a fan of the zombie genre.  i've always been indifferent to the literature and films centered around zombie-dom.  however, there is so much more here than just zombie attacks...someone mentioned the excellent utlization of social commentary; i'd agree.   the multiple viewpoints and eyewitness accounts through the progression of the zombie wars was captivating and well-formed.  enjoyed this book MUCH more than i thought i would.
1881273156|4.0|We were given homework from our marriage counselor to read this book.  It was very helpful in explaining to each of us how the other is expressing love and made it easier to understand why we do what we do.  I would recommend you read this book but you will have to go into it with an open mind.
B001FBSMF8|4.0|This album deserves more than just 3 stars, it may not be what you'd traditionally expect from someone like Chris Cornell but it's a very good effort in stying alive as an artist, I guess you need to appeal to what's popular today in order to be succesful. hardcore cornell fan will or maybe dissapointed cause the album is not what chris cornell is known for. I feel it's a very good effort! surely desrves more than 3 stars!!!
141690977X|5.0|I'm not boy obsessed, but sometime you are left hanging, and sometimes you do turn it in onto yourself.  But once I read this book, well I just feel free from all that thinking!  So what he's not that into me, who cares!  It's much better to stop worrying about 'him', and let yourself be free & open for the one who IS into you!  Don't loose hope ladies, and put up with less than you deserve!  To quote the book \\"Don't waste the pretty!\\"
B00164KYV4|2.0|What the hell is Jennifer Conelly doing in this movie, her great acting skills are put to rest in this piece of junk. The only  decent acting was done by Ginifer Goodwin. I actually felt sorry for her character, the girl was so desperate and pathetic to get a guy to like her.  I wasted my time and money renting this movie, it only proves to me how further downhill Hollywood has gone.
B00260HH3K|5.0|I've seen it!! Only once though..  It was way better than the reviews!!  When I went back to see it again for the second time it stopped playing-.-  I'm getting my copy as soon as it's available!!  Can't wait 'till July!!
B0018QQQKS|5.0|I have always been a big fan of Niall Ferguson because I am not afraid of (a) math and (b) thinking. No disappointment here. Yes it's based on a TV show, or more precisely it's segmented for hour-long bits. That's a bad thing? I found that the chapters built on each other the way you would expect, while bringing new insights throughout.    The point of the book was to show how financial instruments developed from each other. Its aim is to show that without earlier developments you can't have later ones. And its result is to demonstrate that booms and busts occur with any type of financial instrument, but the more complex and leveraged you can get the worse things will be. This is worth the read.
B001PPLJIQ|2.0|Ineptly conventional.  Tacky music, pointless accents, fake eroticism, endless pauses meant to be meaningful.  Movie-making by the numbers.
1400063515|5.0|A mind changer of a book.  For many, way too detailed, and in some instances jumps around too much while alluding to more later in another chapter.  That being said, a must read for those that want to learn a better way to look at something.  Should become a must read for all MBA programs.
B0026IBY72|3.0|I have enjoyed reading some of Shannon Hale's finely crafted YA fantasy novels like The Goose Girl and The Princess Academy. Her writing has a clean and transparent quality that I find rather soothing. In YA novels, her characterizations are sweet and endearing.     This is one of her few novels written for an adult audience. It's a Helen Fielding-esque tribute to Jane Austen and the BBC film adaptation of Pride and Prejudice. Cute. Unoriginal, but cute. The story follows a successful '30-something' gal who happens to have 3 weeks of vacation time racked up as she travels from Manhattan to England because of a vacation package she received as a parting gift from her dead great aunt. Jeez. Contrived, much?     However, once we get past the clunky set up, the story is fun. She spends her vacation in a Regency house, dressing in Regency clothes and interacting with Regency actors whose sole purpose is to help her live out her dearest Jane Austen fantasy.     The rest is rather predictable from there.     However, it's still cute. I giggled out loud in more than one place and I enjoyed the minor idiosyncracies in the characters, though Ms. Hale is not nearly as vicious as dear Jane was in her characterizations. In some places, I wish she had been.     One of the most fun parts about this book is our peek into all of our heroine's previous romantic relationships as we begin each new chapter. These were probably some of the most clever writing in the whole lot.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Arrived quickly and great condition.  Purchased for my mother after her previous copy was ruined by someone who borrowed it.  We have both watched it multiple times and love the movie.
B00000IQW5|5.0|Finally a remake of an old movie that is better than the original.  Wonderful action with the fire and the planes.  The chemistry between the characters is great.  You really laugh and cry with them.
B001ED7C58|5.0|Item arrived quickly and great condition.  Perfect Sound.  I do not like the Paramore songs, but that's a personal preference.  One song from movie I remember is not on cd.  Not sure of the name, but it's the one played during blackout/dream sequence transition into hospital after fight in ballet studio.  Might not even be a full song and that's why they didn't include.
B000EQH2QK|5.0|This is the second CD I have purchased by Shakira who is a phenomenal artist.  I love the mix of Arabic and Latino rhythms.  Her words are thought provoking on a lot of the songs.  I recommend this product for anyone who wishes to be introducted to her work or to an existing fan.
B000002JST|5.0|There may not be a harder rock album ever made! From the opening chords right through to the last note this album totally rocks. On the title track you can even hear an amp. distort and blow! Blows away anything they had done up until then, and haven't even come close to recording another CD of such monstrous rock. They later BLEW UP A VIDEO but on this CD, they literally blow up EVERYTHING!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I purchased this video and two other other jillian michaels after I tried on demand thru comcast for the first ten days. I purchased them just in case on demand doesn't show them before the 30 day shred is up. I can say I'm not the excercise type at all. I knew I needed to get motivated once my pants didn't fit from last season. I was not going up a size. So I just happened to put jillian shred 1 on and I have no idea what it was but I felt so good after I did it and realized hey it was only twenty mintues long I can do this everyday. I looked into reviews on her and on the video and found a lot of postive feed back. But most important I loved doing it for some odd reason..lol.. So now its been 15 days I'm on shred two and I only took a day break between the levels. I have lost 7 pounds so far. If I have extra time and feel like doing a more of a work out I throw in the Boost your metobolism video which is crazy hard!!! I actually felt wierd not working on the day I let myself have off. Its only 20 mintues a day. I have two boys a four year old and a two year old and for the first time since I had them I am starting to feel great about the changes on my body. I have lost about five inches all over. I totally reccommend this video if your ready for a change and are motivated because level two is killer but after the first few days it gets easier!!
1423101472|5.0|My daughter and I both read all five of the Percy Jackson and the Olympians books.  The Last Olympian is the final book in the series, and it was incredible!  This series is tied with Harry Potter to be at the top of our all time favorite books list!
B001R0KH3W|5.0|This is without question one of the greatest concerts that will ever be captured on video. I've seen Stevie live in New York City and Washington, DC many times over the last 25 years,(twice in 2008) and this concert gives you a back stage pass.  Great picture, sound, and camera work. Sir Steveland Morris was at his very best and the entire band and Stevie played as one.
B0025X4P24|5.0|Vanessa Williams ranks high in my book; she has incredible talent and I'm very impressed. Vanessa always gives blood to make her performances shine; and this album was worth the wait! Vanessa tackles some pretty special numbers on this CD; and she always succeeds. She makes it all look easy; but it's her talent that carries her through. The quality of the sound is excellent and I love that artwork!<br /><br />\\"Breathless\\" starts the album; and just as she sings about \\"candlelight and a glass of wine,\\" feel free to do just that--kick back after a hard day at work and relax with a glass of your favorite wine! This is the perfect mood music for relaxation or a warm, unconditionally loving romance; Vanessa delivers this with panache. The music fits in perfectly with her vocals; this is all THAT good! Other numbers that stand out would include \\"Hello Like Before\\" with its jazzy, romantic flavor; \\"Loving You\\" with its strong, jazzy arrangement that charms me every time I hear it; \\"If There Were No Song\\" with its awesome percussion and flair--what a Latin flavor this number has! It's dynamic, to say the least.<br /><br />Vanessa also proves she's still got what it takes with other songs like \\"Just Friends;\\" I really like this number. The texture of the song is quite appealing and Vanessa never lets go of a superfluous note, either! The piano arrangement is particularly sophisticated. In addition, \\"Close To You\\" features Vanessa squarely front and center--right where she belongs!<br /><br />Vanessa Williams gives us a spectacular new album that shines bright and proves she's got the chops to do whatever she wants to do. I highly recommend this CD for her fans; and it even makes a strong starter CD for people just getting into the magical artistry of Vanessa Williams!<br /><br />Great job, Vanessa! We love you!
B000KJU1HI|1.0|i just saw this on tv tonight and i found it very boring.the sound wasnt very good either and watching dylan with acoustic guitar and occasional harmonica is a bore itself.i was dying to hear some drums and electric guitar and bass in this music.but even that wouldnt have mattered since dylans voice makes your ears bleed.they shouldnt call this a rock documentary they should call it a folk documentary.wish they had gone on tour and filmed the beatles 65 tour instead of dylan.
B000YABYLA|4.0|Juno is going to be a movie that some people will tell you that they love while others will hate it. Juno is quirky take on teenage pregnancy. It is also a story of a complex young lady who make a tough but mature decision regarding her baby and how it will be brought into the world.<br /><br /> Personally, I enjoyed Juno - it is a smart, funny and original. Parts move a little slow (and while for the most part it is original) and at times predictable. What is consistent is that Ellen Page is outstanding . She makes a perfect smart talking teenager.<br /><br />Final Verdict -<br /><br />  While not perfect \\"Juno\\" is entertaining and while some of you may hate the movie others may find it being one of their all time favorites.<br /><br />4 1/2 stars
B001U0HBQ0|5.0|This is an instant classic you will never forget. I can't stop thinking about it. Don't let anyone talk you out of seeing this epic film.

B000FGGE68|1.0|In terms of style, the director has created an eye-catching film.  But it all goes downhill from there.  I went into this one having read many reviews here at Amazon, and approached the movie with open-mindedness, but to no avail.  The few things I liked about this flick were eroded away ever so certainly as the film progressed, entrapping itself in a morass of illogic, self-contradiction, and out of place dramatic moments.  I have seen more sense in Roadrunner cartoons, and that's saying very little indeed.
B000002H33|5.0|Cliff Burton's influence in the band is very evident on this album. Lars Ulrich oftens credits that Cliff had an understanding of time signature, syncopation, and melody that the rest didn't. This knowledge heavily influenced the band and progressed over Cliff's short but important tenure in the band. Due primarily to the fact that Cliff was the only band member to take formal lessons and study music theory during a short stint in college positively affected the orchestrations on this album. This is why many people consider Cliff so important to Metallica's history.<br /><br />Each song on the album is technically amazing. The melodies on the middle section of \\"Orion\\" are beautiful and create a serene mood. The melancholy words and chord progressions of \\"Sanitarium\\" remind me of RP McMurphy in \\"One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest\\". \\"Master of Puppets\\" menacing intro of percussive staccato guitar breaks set the stage for the theme of a person controlled/enslaved by substance abuse. I wonder if that song is a call to Dave Mustanie to clean up? Every song on this album is unique and has something to say about our culture. \\"Leper Messaih\\", \\"Damge Inc.\\", \\"Battery\\", \\"Disposable Heros\\" each song deals with some heavy subject matter and backs it up with some crazy rhythms, melodies, chord progressions, and motifs that Metallica don't or can't continue anymore.<br /><br />Every time I pick this album up to play it I feel like I am holding a legend in my hands. Metallica really peaked with this album and the only thing that ever came close, though in a completely different way, was the Black album. They still haven't replicated the passion, anger, and pure artistry that Cliff brought out of them on this album.
B001FB4W0W|1.0|I heard a lot of good things about this HBO series.  I have been a big fan of HBO, even back when it used to be called Home Box Office.  Anyway, I thought that True Blood would bring a me a few hours of harmless entertainment.  I have only watched the first episode.  Here is my problem with the series.    The premise is totally not real.  Are we supposed to believe that there are vampires that live among us in small southern towns?  Really?  Well,  let me tell you.  I grew up (and still live in) a small southern town.  I have never seen a vampire and I haven't even heard of rumors that they are around.  Believe you me, if there were vampires in a small town, the townsfolk would be talking about it.  The idea for this show is just so unrealistic that I couldn't continue to watch it.  How could any of you folks who give it 5 star reviews be so simple minded to believe that there are vampires in America.  Don't you know that vampires only exist in Transylvania, Romania or Pennsylvania?  There are none here in the good ol US of A.  Our govenrment wouldn't allow it (well, maybe Obama might allow it - he is for \\"anything goes\\", but not Bush and Cheney, who knows, maybe vampires are starting to come into our country - maybe the new regime is inviting them), why not???).  Well, not in a small southern town.  Not in the land of Dixie! NO WAY, NO HOW!  Every person in the parish would take them out with the rounds of silver bullets loaded into thier shotguns.    I mean, I don't mean to insult those of you who are so easily entertained, but really.  If you belive the crap that this show is spewing, maybe you should pick up a season of the West Wing... what a bunch of pie in the sky crap was that?  If you want something close to reality, look for an early season of the Dukes of Hazard or even Supernatural... now those are honest to God good and realistic shows. You want to experience what the rest of us live, then take a look at those gems.  If you believe the premise of this show, then I have a barge in New Jersey that I could sell you....

0316010669|1.0|On the face of it,  journalists leave us academics in the shade. They get to speak and write authoritatively on a vast range of subjects, versus our pathetic little micro-specializations. Moreover, they do so in the public domain, adding the luster of \\"public intellectual\\". They often do this with zero academic qualifications, or indeed anything we would recognize as \\"knowledge\\" in our mean-spirited ways. Finally, they get paid extremely well for their trade books, particularly if they already have day jobs, and can hold those jobs without anything we call \\"qualifications\\" in our jealous little minds.<br /><br />Why then  is  journalism of \\"popular science\\"  nature often held in such contempt ? this book's fundamental thesis on \\"thin slicing\\", the tautological idea that suitably attuned experts are, in fact, expert, relates to  cognitive science. This subject studies mind as an informational system; it incorporates elements of philosophy, psychology, linguistics, AI, ethnoscience and - increasingly - neuroscience and other biological sciences.  However,  perhaps a suitably equipped journalist can just raid the area and - Blink! - all is made clear<br /><br />So we get a range of examples, well-commented on already. To see the real argument, de Sousa's 1980's text [[ASIN:0262540576 The Rationality of Emotion (Bradford Books)]] is still worth looking at; it is described on P.63 ff of [[ASIN:1841500690 The Search for Mind: A New Foundation for Cognitive Science]] . Gladwell's \\"Blink\\" book  is close to being the worst  and most intellectually irresponsible book this reviewer has ever read, and his only regret is that the rating system here seems to force him to give a star.<br /><br />Se&aacute;n O Nuall&aacute;in Ph.D. 4u Meitheamh (san tSin 35 Bealtaine)  2009
B001FB4W0W|4.0|I haven't subscribed to HBO since \\"Tales From the Crypt\\" was still airing on the channel. I missed all the hoopla surrounding \\"The Sopranos\\" initially and finally caught that show on DVD after the finale aired. I've heard about \\"True Blood\\" on Howard Stern's radio show, as well as from co-workers, but didn't really feel compelled to see a lousy \\"Twilight\\"-like vamp tale dragged out over a season's worth of episodes.<br />When my wife expressed an interest in watching the show, I decided to pick up the box set as a gift for her. She asked if I would watch it with her, and having no interest and very low expectation I agreed as long as she didn't mind if I started to read a book once I lost interest. Once the show began to play out, the book and everything else I had planned to do was forgotten! I got addicted.<br />\\"True Blood\\" is not only a tale of vampires, it's a character driven show, and you really get to love the characters populating Bon Temps, Louisiana! The acting is phenomenal and Anna Paquin as Sookie Stackhouse is just amazing to watch. Sookie's relationship with vampire Bill Compton forms the backbone of the series, but Bon Temps is populated with a wide range of characters that you come to love (and hate), all living side by side with vampires. The overall story arch of this first season is that someone is killing women who have been with vampires (Fang-Bangers). There are so many twists and turns, edge of your seats moments, laughs, chills, scares and jaw-dropping revelations, that you cannot believe you are watching a weekly television series. \\"True Blood\\" packs more into a single hour long episode than most major theatrical films.<br />Do your best to avoid any spoilers, because even a small spoiler will ruin quite a bit of the fun. As someone who has never really been a fan of vampires, and even less so after having to sit through that god-awful \\"Twilight\\", \\"True Blood\\" had gone a long way in redeeming the genre for me.<br />Now...when does Season 2 start?
B000RZIGVS|5.0|I watched the Next Generation on t.v. as a kid.  My husband is such a fan that I had to buy ALL the seasons at once in this deal.  It is delightful to watch without the commercials.  With 133 hours of Trek you're sure to find an episode you haven't seen in a while!  A must have if you're a fan of the show.
B001LF2WCC|1.0|The video is horrendous.  The Graininess is out of control, the Color Bleed is off the wall, the Black Levels are beyond fixing with ANY HD Plasma, HD LCD, HD Processor, or Blu-Ray Disc Player video settings COMBINED.  The video looks worse than an old VHS taped movie.  The graininess is soooooooooo bad, the best way to understand it is to do the following - Watch a TV with it set to Over the Air setting without an antenna (simple). I enjoyed watching the TV snow on my 25 year old 20\\" tube TV then watching 300 Blu-Ray on my 65\\" 1080p Plasma and my reference Blu-Ray Disc Player.    If you can get past the discusting video quality (which is hard to do), it is a decent movie with nice special effects.

1416594884|1.0|Disappointing = failing to fulfill one's expectations.      Le Carre WAS the best of the best. Don't waste your money or your time on this.
B000Y7U98C|2.0|What a lot of wasted potential \\"Sunshine\\" was.  An interesting premise.  A stellar international cast.  An A-list director. Special effects eye-candy.  This is a film that should have gone down as one of the great science-based science fiction films, along with the Space Odyssey series films [[ASIN:B000UJ48SG 2001]] and [[ASIN:B00004VVN8 2010]].  Instead, about half-way through the story it takes a sudden and illogical left turn into a guy-in-a-rubber-suit Troma slasher film, and any love I had for the flick went right out the window.<br /><br />The story starts out brilliantly.  The Sun is being extinguished, having absorbed a Dark Matter Q-Ball that is slowly turning it colder.  A first mission to re-start the Sun with essentially a giant bomb, aboard the Icarus I, failed through unknown circumstances. So humanity has pooled the last of its resources for a desperate last chance with the Icarus II.  The international crew carries this psychological weight upon their shoulders, knowing that their failure means the death of humanity.<br /><br />Admittedly, the science here isn't exactly accurate, but it has its own internal logic and works in the context of the film.  \\"Sunshine\\" veers into Science Fantasy on a few points, but does its best to stay believable with details such as a replenishing plant-based oxygen garden and a ship's psychologist that helps the crew deal with the stress of a long space voyage.  The details of the ship and the pictures of the Sun are all beautifully handled.<br /><br />The crew as well deserves props.  Cillian Murphy (Scarecrow from [[ASIN:B00005JNJV Batman Begins]]) shows that he is more than a creepy face and a supporting character actor.  This was really a standout performance on his part.  Cliff Curtis ([[ASIN:B0000CABBW Whale Rider]]) is also perfectly cast as the spiritually-minded psychologist, who sees in the Sun something more than technical data. Japanese actor Sanada Hiroyuki ([[ASIN:B00065GX0K The Twilight Samurai]]) gives an understated performance as the ship's captain, and Chinese martial arts legend Michelle Yeoh ([[ASIN:B00003CXR4 Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon]]) plays against type as the mission's botanist who never throws a single punch or kick.<br /><br />All the talent really deserved a better script.  I don't know who is responsible for the disaster that the movie became in the end, but it really reeks of some producer deciding that an intelligent, introspective science fiction film would never sell so they had better throw some monsters in there and some gruesome lets-kill-all-the-crew-members-with-a-different-technique killings.  I am really surprised they didn't toss in a shower scene for good measure.<br /><br />The change in storyline really comes out of nowhere.  There is no foreshadowing, no attempt to match the first part of the story with the second.  Massive plot holes need to be created in order to mash the two pieces together, as they don't fit easily.  At one stage, there are some really annoying single-frame flashes of photographs that do nothing to advance the story, and seem like an editor goofing off by sticking pictures of his friends at a BBQ party into the movie thinking no one would notice.<br /><br />If \\"Sunshine\\" had been a space-based monster film from the beginning, like the incredible [[ASIN:B00011V8IQ Alien]], then all would be well.  Instead it is a schizophrenic car wreck that seems to be the result of movie making by committee rather than the quality film it could have been.

B00000F214|3.0|A couple of years ago I bought a deluxe DVD of this amazing movie. None of the extras that were included on that DVD are included on the Blu-Ray; in fact, the only extra is a theatrical trailer. I wish that I had waited for a better edition. Anyway, I'll hold on to my DVD.
1423113497|5.0|I bought these books for my 11 year old son. He cannot put them down. (\\"Percy Jackson rocks\\" are his words) He has really gotten into the Greek mythology of the story line. He takes the book everywhere - in the car, on the bus, and I have to take it out of his hands at night to get him to go to sleep! Just ordered book 4 which he will start next! BIG thumbs up!!
B0025X4P56|3.0|Just wanna start by saying I love Eels. They were one of the first bands I fell in love with once I really started getting into music and since then have salivated at every new album.  Every CD they've put out has been either a masterpiece or a near-masterpiece so the bar for \\"Hombre Lobo\\" has been set pretty high, but unfortunately I just don't feel they hit it this time.    The 12 songs are a mix of upbeat and mellow, more upbeat than previous albums which is where I think things go wrong.  E lately hasn't been that great at rocking out (early Eels albums have awesome go-crazy songs but recent attempts IMHO have felt sort of strained and contrived)  I dig his voice but the gruff hoarseness just doesn't make for loud singing or screaming.  It's much better on the tender, quieter stuff.  All the fast songs also sound pretty much identical which is never good.  \\"Lilac Breeze\\" \\"Tremendous Dynamite\\" and \\"What's A Fella Gotta Do\\" honestly just made me wince.    \\"Hombre Lobo\\" is saved by the slower, what I feel are the more archetype Eels-songs.  \\"That Look You Give That Guy\\" and \\"In My Dreams\\" are nice breezy numbers that are perfect for bummin around on a lazy afternoon.  However everything is overshadowed by the tragic \\"My Timing Is Off\\" which I think is the best track on here and can be likened to last album's \\"Railroad Man\\". (which not surprisingly is my fav song on \\"Blinking Lights\\")    Overall it's a good album, it's just more of the same.  E is a great lyricist but how many songs can he possibly write about being an outsider looking for love? Musically it's good, but isn't very creative and creativity is what we expect from Eels given how original they've proven themselves to be.  I feel like I could've come up with most of these songs myself.  It's a cliched thing to say, but this is a perfect example of a CD that's better than most of what's out there but for what the artist is capable of...it's sort of a miss.  \\"Hombre Lobo\\" will be in my CD player for awhile,but I'm sticking with \\"Daisies of the Galaxy\\" when someone asks what album is the best to get into Eels with.
061891868X|5.0|One thing is clear from this great and brave effort from within the same mansion of theoretical physics and it is that modern physics is in such a trouble because it followed the exclusive lead of Albert Einstein, and his obssesion with the gravitational field, and so with the concept of particle.<br /><br />\\"These people(Einstein included) worked as if Plank, Bohr, Heisenberg and Schrodinger had never existed. They were living after the quantum mechanical revolution but pretending to work in an intelectual universe in which that revolution never occurred. The Trouble with Physics. Pag52.<br /><br />This confirms my suspicion and gives me a good reason of my surprise when I found that, there had been for a long time, just one reviewer of The Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics by Erwin Schrodinger, where he wrote in 1952:<br /><br />\\"Let me say at the outset, that..., I am opposing not a few special statements of quantum mechanics held today, I am opposing as it were the whole of it, I am opposing its basic views that have been shaped 25 years ago...Pg19 ...

But with the electromagnetic field we have too<br /><br />- the magnetic-circular field or the so-called non conservative field with both kinds of forces, repulsion and attraction, and with no charge concept associated, as the Gauss's law is not valid for it, or there is no magnetic monopole.<br /><br />At the outset this seems to suggest that Plasma Cosmology is really a very good alternative, as in it, the electromagnetic field plays the fundamental role.

B00164GDD2|4.0|A tongue in \\"sheet\\" film that carries to pretenses, many laughs and   high humor. As for it being racist, huh? Lots of flaws in thie movie but  being racist is not one of them. I never discredit someone's honest reaction to a film, but c'mon! Disregard the racist monker and rent  the film. If you saw it in the theater, rent it again. Not as funny because you knew the jokes in advance. It's silly. It's fun. Paranormal  psychiology is to me voodoo science. And voodoo science is easy to  parody. They did. It worked.
B0018M6J90|5.0|A delightful film with some great acting. I love McDormand and Ciaran Hinds together.  Very amusing, witty, charming, with a wonderful lightness of touch and really terrific acting to capture the characters. Thoroughly enjoyable fun. Treat yourself to this feelgood film.
B001TIIIDS|4.0|I have baked EVERY recipe cover-to-cover in Martha Stewart's Baking Handbook - & I and now offering my experience with her \\"Martha Stewart's Cookies\\".  To date, I have baked over 40 of the recipes from \\"Martha Stewart's Cookies\\" - at least once    The following is my \\"Culinary Commentary\\" on this book:    The Positives [Many]  * This Book's Organization:  o Cookie recipe chapters are organized based on cookie texture [e.g., \\"Light & Delicate\\" , \\"Crumbly & Sandy\\" ...] which is both unique and exceptionally helpful to the bakers targeting creating a cookie specific to  preference [e.g., my husband only likes \\"Soft and Chewy\\" cookies]  o The book's opening pages are pictorial representations of each cookie featured in each chapter - enabling the baker to readily select recipes based on both appearance and texture.  * What you see is what you bake!  o Each recipe is accompanied by a color photograph of the finished product - & indeed, if you follow the recipe you will create a \\"picture perfect\\" rendition of the recipe  o Each recipe is equally true to its chapter-specific texture - e.g., if a recipe is specified as \\"Soft and Chewy\\", if you follow the recipe, it will be \\"Soft and Chewy\\".  * A treasured resource for any baker - novice to advanced  o For the novice - ever so many no-fail, crowd-pleasing, really easy recipes [e.g., Old-Fashioned Sugar Cookies - page 87]  o For the advanced baker - recipes huge in flavor, yet requiring a commitment to purchasing the absolute best of ingredients & understanding that this amazing creation requires multiple steps requiring attention to detail [e.g., \\"Chocolate Cherry Crumb Bars\\" - page 305; \\"Chocolate Pistachio Biscotti\\" - page 246.    The Negatives [Few yet Significant]  * The book's binding is terrible.  Clearly the binding is done with cheap glue.  The consequence is that if \\"Cookies\\" is used as it should be [i.e., perpetually as a trusted and frequently used resource] the pages begin to fall out.  I had to take my copy to \\"Staples\\" to have my copy spiral rebound [i.e., original binding cut, pages spiral cut and spiral plastic binding inserted - no regrets as spiral binding = a book that will lay flat when open which is \\"baker friendly\\".  * The page paper quality is not \\"annotation-friendly\\".  In my opinion, any baker must annotate any recipe with notes specific to what they learned while baking a recipe.  I found that any notes that I penned onto the pages of \\"Martha Stewart's Cookies\\" tend to smear illegibly unless I was extremely careful to (1) let the ink dry prior to closing the book & (2) never allowing moisture to contact my previously penned notes.    My Favorite Recipes:  * From the chapter on Light and Delicate: \\"Chocolate Meringues\\" [pg 33] - an easy introduction into piped cookies.  * From the chapter on Soft and Chewy: hands down it is the \\"Old Fashioned Sugar Cookie\\" [pg 87] - amazing cookies and a hard-to-find recipe for this type of cookie.  * From the chapter on Crumbly and Sandy: \\"Rum Raisin Shortbread\\" [pg 134] - this cookie is amazing if one uses quality raisins and rum.   * From the chapter on Chunky and Nutty: \\"Banana-Walnut Chocolate-Chunk Cookies\\" [pg 170] - everyone loved these and they keep REALLY well.  * From the chapter on Cakey and Tender: \\"Pear, Pistachio and Ginger Blondies\\" [pg 201] - so long as THE BEST ingredients are used and these are served same day these are AMAZING cookies.  * From the chapter on Crisp and Crunchy: \\"Chocolate Black Pepper Cookies\\" [pg 245] - a real winner with a real bite in flavor!  * From the chapter on Rich and Dense: \\"Chocolate Cherry Crumb Bars\\" [pg 305] - time consuming and expensive to make [& mandates the expense of quality ingredients] yet absolutely worth it!    My least Favorite Recipes:  * From the chapter on Light and Delicate: \\"Candy-Stripe Cookie Stripes\\" [pg 48] -too much preparation pain for culinary cookie-appreciation gain.  * From the chapter on Soft and Chewy: \\"Coconut Macaroons\\" [pg 62] - because I really donot like macaroons. Period!  * From the chapter on Crumbly and Sandy: \\"Mexican Wedding Cookies\\" [pg 112] - way too crumbly and dry.  A far better rendition can be found in Martha Stewart's Baking Handbook [pg 96 of  Martha Stewart's Baking Handbook]  * From the chapter on Chunky and Nutty: \\"Double Chocolate Coconut Cookies\\" [pg 173] - despite the name, these cookies are incredibly lacking in chocolate flavor.  * From the chapter on Cakey and Tender: \\"Mini Black-and-White Cookies\\" [pg 213] -  Black and White Cookies simply cannot be \\"mini\\" and retain being true to heritage and as such quality.  * From the chapter on Crisp and Crunchy: \\"Chocolate Pretzels\\" [pg 223] - dull flavor.  * From the chapter on Rich and Dense: \\"Cream Cheese Swirl Blondies\\" [pg 275] - personally, I found the flavor combination unappealing.    My \\"Culinary Conclusions\\":  * To the prospective buyer of \\"Martha Stewart's Cookies\\": YES. Absolutely purchase the book and use it and learn from it!  * To Martha:  Good Grief Martha, for the next edition of your \\"Martha Stewart's Cookies\\" please \\"practice what you preach\\" i.e., quality! - and as such price in quality binding so that pages will not fall out of this fabulous resource by those that respect, repeatedly use, and treasure your \\"Baking Handbook\\".

B0011N1WE8|5.0|What a sweet, sweet story that is actually okay for kids to watch!  As it is an obvious plot - fairly predictable - I won't go into too much detail about the story.  It's not an ugly duckling story as some reviewers have said but more like a reversed Beauty and the Beast.  There's a curse put upon a family and because of this curse, Penelope, our heroine, is born with a snout and the only way to break the curse is for her to find someone to marry her.  And thus begins her family's journey to find the right man for this cursed girl.  Unlike the story of the Beauty and the Beast this fairy tale has a sophisticated twist to it - which was fantastic.  Although, the story is absolutely fantastic, I have to say I was more charmed by the visual of the movie.  Oh, how beautifully this story was presented.  The production team created this whole world that doesn't quite fit in any time  period - a victorian gothic married with the twenty-first century... all the colours and the quirky and quaint setting were a sight to behold.  I'd want to live on that set if it was real!  :D<br /><br />There were no weak links in the whole cast.  Christina Ricci played Penelope beautifully.  She is supposedly the female beast but her beauty shines through remarkably - and sometimes, she was too beautiful to be the 'beast' of the movie, even with the snout!  ;)  A special mention goes out to Mr Bennet.  It was hilarius to see the hunk from Pride and Prejudice become a daft prick!<br /><br />I would like to warn you, though, not to expect a romantic comedy.  The story revolves around the character Penelope and how she overcomes and braves the hurdles of life.  The movie stands to send out a message.  There is a romantic story to it but it's definitely not the central plot.  All in all a great feel good movie and, yes, an excellent chick flick for all ages!
B00009TB5G|5.0|As in Fellowship, this is a great movie. Will be a classic. Although it varries from the book, it is a good movie in its own right.

B001PJRAUS|5.0|For some reason I really like this new take on Pride and Prejudice. This is just plain fun. A modern girl ends up IN the story, having traded places with Elizabeth. The story really gets made-over and all mucked up, but (as is typical in Austen) things work out well (if not decidedly altered) in the end. If you are an Austen fan, and are interested in a new Pride and Prejudice with interesting changes (NOT zombies in this version, fortunately) then check this out. It's delightful.
B000OCY7JE|5.0|This subtitled Danish film give us an enjoyably nuanced and intruiging story of life and morality among attractive and successful people undergoing serious life crises.

B001ECQ6YW|1.0|This movie was never received and no response ever gotten back from seller after inquiries filed.  Have filed a Claim Compliant with Amazon over the matter.
B000TGELLY|5.0|With restored footage (over 30 minutes worth) that I don't know   why they didn't keep in the original theatrical release in the   first place, this movie flows so much better and makes much more   sense than that crap that came out in the theatres and disappointed   alot of people! Alot of people (linear thinking people!)   can't divorce themselves from the facts of history and of   Homer's immortal tale...this is an adaptation people!!  It's HOLLYWOOD!!--ENTERTAINMENT!!  If you want facts and historical accuracy, you should watch   HISTORY INTERNATIONAL on cable for this!  Both this movie and \\"300\\" got a bad rap for not being historically accurate, but I say \\"Blow it out your chariot!!\\"    Brad Pitt was very believable as Achilles and Eric Bana   made for a great Hector!--Both played their roles brilliantly   and were in top shape for them..I wish there had been more nudity! (-:  (Yeah, I said it!)  Orlando Bloom played his role well as Paris,   the innocent, wide-eyed, idealistic pretty young fool in love   who inadvertently brings his family and country into ruin for   the love of a beautiful woman. Surprisingly, none of the female   roles really left a lasting impression on me in this movie!  They just kind of did what they did and fit where they fit.   But Brad Pitt, Eric Bana, Orlando Bloom and veteran Peter O'Toole   really owned this movie! I'm so glad I purchased this 2-disc   version, because the original one left a bad taste in my mouth   and this shows the original vision that the director had in   mind when this film was created.
B001OGRQ92|5.0|\\"Trouble In Shangri-La\\" for me was Stevie saving grace. I loved Stevie Nicks since I first heard her with Fleetwood Mac. I have all her CD's, but was not happy with \\"Street Angel\\". I didn't like this album. I didn't think the music and lyrics were right together. The song \\"Blue Demin\\" sounded like popular tripe, \\"Greta\\" was just ok, and the song \\"Street Angel\\" was just plain bad. I mean, come on; \\"Street angels live on the street, and they always will\\", how generic can you get. I loved the first two albums totally; every song. \\"Rock A Little\\" was great album, but not every song a winner. Then you got \\"The Other Side of the Mirror\\" which ; by my account, was ok. I seamed to me like she was going down hill. The \\"Trouble In Shangri-La\\" was released and, BLAM, she was back. Her best to date. This was my favorite, and I played it as often as I could. I even worked in an outlet store which let us bring our own CD's in, and this was one of that. No words can tell you how much I loved this CD, but if you love Stevie Nicks as much as I do; then you've got to have this one.
B0013FSL0C|5.0|I have to say I'm totally hooked on this show, I can't wait to get the next season on dvd! As a doctoral student in clinical psych I'd say it's probably the closest thing to real therapy that your going to see on tv or movies, it's the closest I've seen. Of course it's sped up to fit one client into one season, but it's pretty accurate in its depiction of how a psychdynamically-oriented clinician goes about work. The fact that he does his own personal therapy is a major plus for the show, it gives you a great view of the human side of the therapist that you don't see when he's the therapist. Overall, it's a great show. If you like this type of therapy (psychdynamically-oriented, non-manualized, etc.), or if you have had some of this type of therapy yourself, I'm sure you will really like In Treatment.

B000MV8ABS|5.0|This movie is a classic.  I am sure it scared the heck out of the viewers the first time it was released.  It is funny for us now in 2009, but it is still a treasure for collectors of movie memorabilia.  I collect horror movies from the original \\"Nosferatu\\" until the stuff like \\"Drag me to hell\\".  It is not that I like to be frightened, but it is exciting to scream and laugh afterwards because of how silly was what got us scared.  Excellent movie to see the traditional middle 70s to middle 80s horror movies.
B000QXDED6|4.0|I received the DVD of 300 ahead of schedule.  There was no damage to the packaging on the DVD.  The DVD worked great.  I enjoyed the movie.  300 is a very violent movie, but I knew that before I purchased the movie.  The setting is in the past.  As a history buff, I enjoyed the dramatization of an infamous battle between ancient cultures.  The Spartians were portrayed as protectors or what they loved.  They loved their families, their land (property), and freedom.  For these reasons I felt 300 was a politically conservative movie.  I prefer the term: \\"freedom-loving\\", I think it is more appropriate.  The error in the movie is that the enemy of Sparta: Xerxes, the Persian king.  In the biblical book of Esther, Xerxes prays to God, praises God's wisdom and submits to God's sovereignty.  The movie portrays Xerxes as a king styled like pre-Christian Rome: the god-king.  I understand why 300 would want to make the villian evil and daunting, but making a Persian general evil may have been more historically accurate.

B000P0J024|4.0|Both records are good, but Vol 1 is easily the better, and much of that has to do with Roy Orbison.  Orbison is one of the great voices of American music.  For many years he was ignored, following his early 60s heyday until the release of this album.  The release of this Wilbury's Vol 1 and then his solo \\"Mystery Girl\\" returned him to his rightful place, at the top of the charts in people's memories, just before his untimely early death.

B000W91RUG|5.0|This is probably my favorite TV show right now.  I used to think 2-1/2 Men was funny...one of the few shows where you'd actually laugh out loud.  Big Bang is done by the same writers/producers whatever...HILARIOUS! I laugh out loud when I watch this too.  Every actor/character is just perfectly suited & it makes for great comedy.   I'm sooo happy they are putting out DVD's.  I LOVE IT!
1416562605|4.0|Balram Halwai, is a sociopath, a murderer and the delusional entrepreneur in Aravind Adiga's award winning book, \\"The White Tiger.\\" We follow the evolution of this lowly child of India's disenfranchised poor masses to savvy businessman of India's newly franchised internationalization. He is self-absorbed, but clever and highly motivated - just the right tools to \\"caste\\" his own shadow on a changing Indian society. He acquires the necessary training to prosper in the murky fringes of Indian society: deceit, corruption and entitlement. He finds his teachers everywhere, his \\"masters\\" who enslave him, his \\"friends\\" who ridicule him, and his \\"family\\" who shackle him.    \\"The White Tiger\\" portrays a nation in turmoil as it struggles to blend its traditional values with its emergence as an economic world leader. The story is very entertaining, ironic and maintains a heavy conscious. Adiga's observations of Indian society are veiled through the eyes of a deranged character. In this manner, the unfair becomes malevolent and good becomes harmonious. The demons of Balram's psychosis lie in the duality of man:  justice vs. injustice, tradition vs. reform, and freedom vs. servitude. The catharsis of Adiga's beleaguered India can be found in there too.    Some reviewers have ill-suggested that \\"The White Tiger\\" is quite the modern-day \\"Crime and Punishment\\" or \\"Native Sun\\". They drink from the same batch of  \\"Cool-Aid\\" that have seemingly hyped Adiga as a modern-day Dostoevsky or Wright.  The book is good. These comparisons are not.
0316017922|5.0|I was hooked from the start of this book.  The author has a unique way of pulling the facts together with stories and experts that got my attention.  I'm still thinking about some of the conclusions that he made.  Our book group enjoyed the discussion that followed the reading, too.
B000M5AJQI|5.0|Everything under the moon is already written about this fantastic movie..I envy those who are going to be watching it for the 1st time!
0061537934|5.0|I laughed.  I cried.  I learned a little about racing.  This book had it all!  It was truly a heartwarming story that is told from an interesting perspective.  It was extremely well written and I absolutely loved it!
1423101472|5.0|This book is so far the last in the Olympian series. I bought it for my son, he couldn't wait for it to come. Once unpacked, he read it without stopping.I'm glad, that I could order it, since we have NO! book store in town.
B00005RFAI|5.0|I just keep playing this CD.  I am about twice as old as P!nk and think this album is just fantastic.  The beat is perfect, and suits her voice exactly.  I also listen to lyrics and this CD is not lacking in that area either.  There have been reviews of the specific songs already, but I just wanted to add my vote because she's really been clever to create such a great set of songs --- from the starting drum beat in My Vietnam -- to the lamenting tones in Family Portrait.  5 stars!
B001F0VHEM|4.0|For me, when I hear a song I like, I usually go and download the track in question.    So it says something when I go out and by the CD. I was taking a chance and discovered more of her tracks and songs that I've enjoyed, not just So What or Sober that I was buying it for. Some of the songs I didn't care too much for, such as One Foot Wrong or Mean. And others I found I really enjoyed like Bad Influence, Funhouse and Ave Mary A.    I'm definently considering other albums now, but not sure what yet given when she initially came out as a Pop Star and her age.
B001MW0J2E|4.0|I heard the single for my girls way back when it first came out and kind of got over it after awhile; but only after it got stuck in my head for about a week straight. Then my friend reminded me that the new album had hit the shelves and I had to take a listen. I gotta say I know there is a lot of hype surrounding this album and a lot of praise for what it is that animal collective does, but I'm not going to let that affect my own personal view of it.     To be honest, animal collective isn't an everyone band. So if you aren't into to new things then you probably won't enjoy them that much but they are a very enjoyable and interesting band and i'm always excited to hear their newest stuff.    The band as a whole has seemed to really mature with this latest album. Be it that they've been working together for so long or that they needed time apart to work on solo projects or they've just gotten better at using those sampling machines. whatever they did to come together for this new album it has really worked.    This albums is filled with catchy lines, entrancing melodies, wonderful noises and beautiful harmonies. It may be a little too electronic for some, but you're listening to the wrong band if you don't like that kind of music.    A few notable songs would definitely be the hit single \\"My Girls\\" A catchy all around upbeat song that you can dance too. While some complain of the keyboard samples in \\"daily routine\\" are too repetative, I find it to be very enjoyable and a great song. \\"summertime clothes\\" is one of my favorite songs on the album with it's incessant beat and it''s wonderful captivating lyrics and harmonies. It's another one of those songs that will be stuck in your head for days. \\"No More Runnin\\" a slower more ballad type of song drenched in beautiful multi layered harmonies is worth a good listen. \\"Brothersport\\" will take your mind to far away places with it's tribal beats and lobotomized lyrics. \\"Bluish\\" shines with it's repeated line \\"i'm getting lost in your curls\\" high pitched synthesizer sounds and once again beautiful harmonies.    In short this album is packed full of wonderfully enjoyable and much more listenable songs this time around. While it's still no mainstream music, well I generally like it better that way. The band as a whole is really a formidable unit and it really shows. But if the album cover itself is any indication of the trip that lies ahead in your listening pleasure you shouldn't be surprised at all if it's a little out there.    some call it repetitious and too experimental, but what do you expect from a band that uses sampling machines as their primary instrument? Just enjoy the magic of music.
B000VT6FAO|4.0|Short and simple. As a major fan of Depeche Mode's entire catalogue, I prefer Violator and earlier.    That being said, Dave's 'Paper Monsters' was okay, it had good points, a brilliant song or two.    This is much more mature music-wise, and more evolved singing-wise.  It is both wonderfully familiar and an intentional departure from the Depeche Mode line.  If you really like 'Paper Monsters,' 'Playing the Angel,' 'Sounds of the Universe,' you'll rate this a 4 or 5. If you're not a fan of post-1990 Depeche Mode, you'll rate this a 3 or 4.    If you collect, or in any way look forward to a Depeche Mode purchase without sampling (that is, trust it to be good,) add this to your list before 'Paper Monsters.'    Good show, Dave, I'm very impressed with this!
B001K3JF7K|4.0|Excellent choice of songs for this lushly orchestrated album.  No other present day songstress compares to her ability to present tunes in such a clear, lovely manner.  Reminds me in a way of Rosemary Clooney.  I would have excluded The Boy from Impanema and Este Seu Olhar, only because for me, they are \\"owned\\" by Astrud Gilberto.  Otherwise, a really excellent album, and am looking forward to more from her.
B00004XQ83|5.0|i've been really enjoying this cd--i've wanted it since the movie came out and finally bought myself one.  i love both the vocal and the instrumental parts of the album--a rich mix of layered complexity and  rough simplicity that manages to work together all the way thru.  it's fantastic!
B001U0HBPG|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies, it keeps your interest  frame after frame.
B0008ENICU|5.0|Wonderful film with a classic group of women starring in it. Its a classic movie and during that time a movie of just women, not a man in sight,great.  I recommend every woman see it, the story line is so true, no matter what generation you are.
0316010669|5.0|I liked this book a lot.  What I consider my gut, Mr. Gladwell considers \\"Thin-slicing.\\"  Stayed up all night to read, and glad I did.  While it lacks in the self-help department, it does not really tell you what to do to become a better thin-slicer, it makes up for by superb storytelling and thought provoking essays.<br /><br />An interesting side note, I picked this book up because I was acquainted with an individual in one of the studies it uses.  From listening to his best friend describing the relationship, I without any doubt put in my two cents from my thinly sliced comprehension aka \\"gut\\" - that the marriage is over.  His best friend got angry and yelled at me for not understanding completely and my negative judgement.  A month later they filed for divorce.  A year later this book was published.  I like that it uses their taped interaction many years ago as an example, because it validated my personal \\"Snap judgement\\" and lets me know my gut is doing a good job.
B0015YIGJC|4.0|I'm absolutely happy with my purchase I'm a big fan of MANA and would recommend it to my friends and family. Everytime I look for items on Amazon I always find what I'm looking for its so easy to navigate. I always tell my friends and family where I find my purchases and how easy it is to shop whether you want to spend a little or a lot this is the place to shop. Thanks.
B001EBC8U4|5.0|The author of this book came upon the Island of Guernsey by chance.  In a series of letters between and among her central character, a young woman writer, and the residents of the Island we get a picture of a quiet existence sullied only by the depradations of an enemy, but more importantly we meet a series of characters, each clearly drawn, and part of the main composition.  We find heroism and humor, love and malice, all the bits and pieces of a good read.  However, there is more: a tribute to community and decency which the Nazis would have outlawed.
0316036692|5.0|Similar to Gladwell's other books, it's thought provoking, interesting and fast paced. His unique and varied examples get you to think about your own potential. Definitely recommend.
B001N18HP0|5.0|I HAVE THE FIRST EDITION, AND THIS ONE SOUNDS MUCH BETTER!!!  THE SECOND LP HAS A NICE MIXING!!! IT'S REALLY COOL TO LISTEN TO ONE AFTER ANOTHER...
B001U7WUZA|1.0|I bought this 2 LP (180 gram vinyl set) hoping to discover new treasures within the music of Ritual de lo Habitual.  However, the hack mix and mastering job on this 2 LP set is appallingly bad! It's uninspiringly flat; no life whatsoever!!! All of the nuance from the high-end portion of the mix is all but gone! What happened to the cymbals? The syllables from the vocals? The coiled wire of the bass strings? It sounds like an AM radio mix with some low end! Terrible. Don't buy this, stick with the CD.

B001N26GFC|4.0|Yes, another in a long line of movies about quirky women who dress wacky, but ...but! This movie is completely worth seeing for Sally Hawkins, her semi androgynous beauty, her expressive face and body... it is worth it alone to see the scene when she goes to a flamenco dancing lesson...when she realizes she left her sunglasses perched on her head.. I can not give it away, it showed Sally's gift at physical comedy. I loved the special feature that explained the making of the movie, the intricacies involved with shooting in the car,the interviews with the actors and actresses... the featurette gave so much good information it made me understand the movie more, and THEN I actually sat and watched the whole movie again with the sparkling and completely engrossing commentary by director Mike Leigh! I highly recommend the movie, the extras, and especially the commentary.<br /><br />I gave it 4 instead of 5 because I could not understand chunks of dialogue because of the strong accents/jargon.. but I do love the accents and jargon ... there was a wee bit too much with the driving instructor, he was SUCH an unlikable character, I could not find the part of his character that would make me care about him, ( altho the actor who played him was excellent especially if you watch him being interviewed and he is nothing like that creepy weirdo) ...and also because of the scene when the driving instructor pulled Poppy;s hair and yet she  still treated him oh so kindly after he assaulted her, that was the only annoying unbelievable thing to me.. Later when I heard the commentary Mike Leigh explained what he was trying to convey mixing Poppy and the driving instructor.. they were the opposites in life.<br /><br />The other actresses who played Poppy's sisters and friends and co workers were wonderful and added a richness and sweetness to the whole mix. The actor who played Poppy's boyfriend was so charming and believeable, but as we learn later in the featurette, the actor is a Shakespearean actor... Oh those amazing British actors and actresses with their extensive and amazing theatrical educations! It shows! They all make it seem effortless and natural.<br /><br />The flamenco instructor was an actress who really stood out, too, what an amazing and scene stealing wonderful actress!<br />I hope you enjoy this movie, it really was, on a whole, delightful and uplifting and lovely!<br /><br />PS- some other reviewers felt Poppy was not truly happy, or was irresponsible, or was evil. Their view points were very interesting to me, but I did not think so. There is a scene where she tells her sister how she feels about her life and I felt that Poppy was sincere in her happiness, that she truly had a gift about seeing the best in people or situations, maybe to a fault tho. But arent all characters flawed or confused or a mix of good hearted with a streak of something else? Which would explain her acting out with the driving instructor. At 30, which seems to be not that old these days, she was a woman still growing into her own.. Oh those amazing British actors and actresses with their extensive and amazing theatrical educations!

1881273156|5.0|The book came a little too late in my first marriage.  I read it when I was separated - but it certainly explained a lot.  I am definitely using it in all my relationships going forward.
0399247459|5.0|This is my son's, as well as my, favorite book. He  goes to it over and over again and ask for me to read it to him. He enjoys the rythym of the book, learns his colors & animals, and is deveoping an appreciation for reading.
B0000BXGCN|5.0|My wife and I agree that Lara Fabian is the best French language singer alive, and that includes other greats, even Celine Dion.  Unlike Celine's, Lara's voice is richer and equally tantalizing in the lower ranges as in the higher ones.  The emotion in her interpretations also stands above all others.  We had the pleasure of seeing her live in Brussels a few years back, and I am eager to have her do a US tour.  In fact, I'd be prepared to go to Canada just to see her live again.  If you want to buy a single Lara Fabian record, \\"En Toute Intimite\\" should be it.
1416550542|4.0|Morton's first novel left me a little unmoved. This one is much better. It is a leisurely mystery, set, at various times, in 1913, 1975 and 2005. It unravels the complicated story line of an orphaned girl who goes in search of her real parents and runs up against the last bastian of Victorian manners and the hateful restrictions of false propriety. It will keep you turning the pages to find out what the big secret is at the heart of a pretty terrible family. It also evokes the beauty of Cornwall in a lovely way.
0385340575|3.0|Lee Child is one of my secret pleasures. His plots are well researched, we always learn something. His hero Jack's fights are well-choreographed; one can just about imagine this well-trained man taking on two or three bad guys and getting away with it. His violence level sometimes is high for me. I enjoy the superbly-independent Jack. I like Child's flowing prose. This story was intriguing until the end, where we're expecting an explanation but don't get it. Child's other books have been plotted better through to the end.
0307341569|5.0|I first fell in love with Flynn's writing when I read \\"Sharp Objects,\\" the most moving explication of \\"cutting\\" I have ever seen, not to mention a great mystery. Now along comes another mystery, this time evoking the secrets within the heart of a family's brutal slaying. This one is a page turner too, a can't-put-it-down, take-it-everywhere read. If you haven't read French, do so now. Get both for the beach and you'll never go near the water!!!!!!!!!!
0061689246|5.0|I picked up stardust (when it still had it's original boring cover) one day and started reading. I entered a world where little furry creatures act like fairy godfathers and anything is possible. I never wanted to leave. Even now, with the movie out, I still go back to my favorite fairy tale to relive the experience again as it was meant to be. (The movies good too though).<br />Anyone who loves fairytales, young or old, will enjoy Stardust.

1594481717|5.0|Daniel Pink has presented the clearest view of the implications of the \\"Flat World\\" available anywhere.     Asia produces more left-brain professionals than the US has people. Combine that with Asia's lower cost infrastructure, and its easy to see that any left-brain, process driven activity will, naturally, move offshore.      If such work doesn't move offshore, given ever increasing computing speed and capacity, it will be automated soon enough.      Protectionist government economic policies deny these realities and are irrational and counter productive. The good news of Pink's book is that, by getting \\"A Whole New Mind,\\" those policies won't be necessary.      To survive and thrive, context will trump content to create value in the world of mature or maturing capitalist economies. Action for action sake will be replaced by action with clear purpose, and valueable context, replacing our Mechanical low-margin, cost-plus pricing models with high-margin, value-impact models. Nobody is more qualified than the US to do this.     It is simple, but will require a profound change in how we view work and value. The definitions and processes which worked in the past will not work in the future. Mechanical process and structure business models are too rigid to adapt in the hyper-dynamic, hyper-competitive now. Asia and automation will create these by the thousands.     We need an organic model that recognizes creativity and innovation as the key to sustained competitive advantage. The Organic Model naturally produces both.     It's a right-brain thing. It's a Whole New Mind.
1439102813|5.0|a truly reamarkable book- so right on target- takes place at Harvard and the Cape so a nice read for Bostonians. I felt all through it that it had been written by Alice's daughter. It is terrific on  CD.
B0025X4P56|3.0|This CD isn't bad, but it's not great. Musically, it harkens back to past albums and doesn't break much new ground.    The \\"enhanced\\" part of the album is just a link to a website where you can download a 30-minute \\"making of\\" documentary, where you'll be transfixed by  Mark's beard and wonder why anyone in the 21st century would want to look like a mountain man from the 1800s.
1416979174|1.0|We read books by the dozens with our preschooler.  We've enjoyed many of Eric Carle's classic titles (The Very Hungry Caterpillar, Brown Bear) but this one is awful.  It's highly inaccurate, from the empirical standpoint, and has nothing to do with how a seed germinates.  Beyond that, it's horrendous.  The other seeds suffer horrible deaths until only this one is left - it's more like Stephen King's The Long Walk than a preschooler book.  1984 is more cheerful.      Carle has diluted his brand in a really awful fashion in recent years.  Now he's jumped the shark.
B000TDFKVW|5.0|Ok...I have been listening to Enigma for years! I've tried other artists that were supposed to have the \\"same\\" type sound...NO COMPARISON IN ANY WAY SHAPE, FORM OR FASHION!! They don't even touch his style and genious in any way! All of his songs are just pure sensuality in my mind...deep beats, hypnotic voices, other worldly evoking feelings...Michael Cretu is just the bomb...LOL don't know what else to say! YOU WILL FALL IN LOVE WITH ANY OF HIS ALBUMS...TRUST ME!!!
B000059Z8M|5.0|Purchased this item for my nephew. We have watched it multiple times and love it. I would highly recommended this dvd to everyone.
B000WTNCYA|5.0|I have listened to this cd over and over since I got it.  I can't decide where my favorite place to listen to it, bathroom, car, or while cooking.  The album's title song, Worrisome Heart(track 1) makes you want to slink around in a cocktail dress with a glass of wine because it's so sultry.  My other favorite is \\"Love me like a Waterfall\\"(track 8)which is a slow plea, bordering on depression. Most of the other tracks are similar to Norah Jones in it's use of simple background and light lyrics.  Overall, I love her sound and the album.
B00006AL1G|5.0|great movie, it takes you in schratching, says a lot about history, i would recommend to all begining djs, that they know what its all about.......
0316017922|5.0|A very very good read. He tries to find out what makes a person successful. Being an Indian I could relate to and compare to what he says in the book about Asians. In India schools tend to make students work hard. Give them a lot of homework. For example say a first grade student would be given homework, which take about like 2 hours. And sometimes this homework could be just labor intensive like write the word \\"everyone\\" 25 times. When I came in USA and saw the schooling over here, found it creative and less stressful for the children. I liked it. But after reading the book I did realize that even though in India if they make to write a word \\"everyone\\" 25 times it may not be as bad. That teaches them to sit in a place and do their homework. That teaches them hard work and have less distractions. Although things are changing in India and now slowly gearing towards Western style of education, I am not sure now, after reading this book that it is a good change.    But this is a very small part of this book. It shows how Bill Gates, Beatles etc. became great and successful and shows how much circumstances paid a role in their success. Its not the talent that they have is important, but it is the hard work. Shows that if a normal person spends like 10000 hours doing the same thing, he can be successful in that thing, no matter how difficult it is.     \\"Tipping point\\" by the same author was good, but this was excellent work!!    It could re-confirm some of my thinking and also opened my mind to some new thoughts.
B00005PJ8O|3.0|Patton, 1970 film     The film begins with a huge 48 star flag and the general saluting. He wears many rings and medals, and two ivory-handled revolvers. He gives a speech on the need for winning. \\"America will never lose a war.\\" [Was this from an actual speech?] They show North Africa, the Kasserine Pass in 1943 Tunisia. People scrounge for goods among the battlefield. Major General Bradley looks over the area to check the reports. He needs a tough tank commander to do better. Patton arrives to inspect the soldiers. The American forces had inferior equipment (no mention of less experience). Patton plans on more discipline for the soldiers.     An air attack provides drama. Where is the air cover? A message tells of a planned attack by Rommel. [The British broke the German code and could plan ahead.] The Americans dig in to await the attack. [No air cover? The battle scene is staged to minimize the number of actors.] The Americans and British win. Where will they attack next? Patton has a plan to take Palermo in a flanking attack. He offers his respects to the Cardinal (he knows politics). Patton wants another attack behind enemy lines so he can capture Messina first. Later he visits an Army hospital and slaps a patient who appears to be unwounded. [In fact that soldier was suffering from malaria.] The Allies parade through Messina. Ike orders Patton to apologize for slapping a soldier; he does so.     In Corsica Patton pays tribute to the Free French forces under Generals De Gaulle and Le Clerc. Ike has to fight the enemy and keep the allies together. Patton will take part in a deception designed to draw German forces to the Pas de Calais. Did he insult our Russian allies? [Are there forces out to get Patton?] Patton is given command of the 3rd Army for a flanking attack. Bradley explains the strategy to Patton, the target is the rockets launched against London. Patton notices the use of carts by the Germans, their end is near. [A shortage of oil and gasoline.] TheBattle of the Bulge halts their advance. Patton's forces race to Bastogne to attack the enemy. Will prayer help? Clear weather brings air cover. Patton is cool at a victory celebration. What will he say? Does he guard his tongue? Is he out of his mind? [Did somebody think he outlived his usefulness?] \\"All glory is fleeting.\\"     After four decades I note how this film is padded to fill out its three hours. This is one film that isn't as impressive as when first seen. Did this film try to improve Patton's image? George C. Scott refused to accept his award for this film. Scott later starred in a sequel that provided another view of Patton but it wasn't as successful. People like a movie with a happy ending that makes them feel good. Your opinion may vary. This film glides over Patton's reactionary politics and presents him as a colorful character. What other general ever slapped a patient in a hospital? Could he have been suffering from some disease?
B001IXSU8M|5.0|Every song on this album is single material. Pure pop awesomeness! Lady Gaga has a great voice and style to her music.  I recommend this album very much!  Fave tracks: Poker Face, Eh Eh, Just Dance, Money Honey & Brown Eyes.
2352500796|5.0|I originally encountered this book at a friend's house, the president of the non-profit reenactment group U.S. 2nd Rangers Infantry Battalion of St. Louis, MO (2ndrangers.org).  He uses this book for researching items he is interested in, finding out exactly which year items were produced, and for entertainment.  He has touted it as one of the best research tools he's found for WWII reenacting.<br /><br />After I flipped through it and attended WWII Weekend 2009 at Jefferson Barracks in St. Louis I decided to start a business recreating the paper products from WWII for reenactors and the public.  This book is absolutely invaluable in that respect.  It has more items than any other book I've seen.  It truly is an all in one resource.<br /><br />If you're a reenactor or WWII aficionado, or have a child or someone else in your life who is interested in WWII this book, and its sister book Volume I, are the perfect purchase.  Though the price may be off putting for some you have to realize that the book is full of 100% full color high gloss pages it is beyond worth it.
B000062U7B|5.0|\\"Rock in Rio\\" features the latest lineup of Iron Maiden touring behind their album \\"Brave New World\\" in the early 2000s. The setlist leans heavily on this album, with the first six tracks appearing in the \\"Rock in Rio\\" track listing. The rest of the gig is a rundown of some of the band's greatest hits, with staples like \\"The Number of the Beast\\" and \\"The Trooper.\\" The addition of \\"The Clansmen\\" and \\"Sanctuary\\" were nice nods to those that like the occasional deep cuts.<br /><br />The sound quality is top-notch, and the band is spot-on. You can really feel the energy the band plays with, and the crowd gets so into it you feel like you're there. A must for Maiden fans.

You cringe as you join her going back to the office, with her career, that as steps back into she realizes that things aren't as she thought she left them.<br /><br />Her world is turned upside down, she is vunerable and doesn't know who to trust or whom to turn to.  Every page endears you to the life she finds herself in.<br /><br />A definite page turner that I couldn't put down and when I would have to, I couldn't wait to pick it back up again to see how things were playing out, whom she was starting to trust, had she learned the truth about her past, could she see through the haze, fix the past wrongs, could she put her life back together and be where she really belonged??
B001NESPHC|5.0|I stumbled onto Melody the other night on Letterman signing \\"who will comfort me\\". I knew right away I needed to hear more. Since, I have bought all of her albums. Stunning, calm, relaxing. A true joy to simply sit and listen too. You can not go wrong with buying anything from this wonderful artist.
B0026GBIB6|3.0|As with most Depeche Mode albums, there are some gems and some weak songs.  I would say overall, there are a lot more weak songs than gems.    But if the songwriting is on fragile ground, it was the mixing that shoved this album into a hole.    Somebody messed up big time.    This is probably one of the worst mixed albums I've heard in a long time.  The drums were horrible.    Depeche Mode has always been geared toward the dancefloor.  But the way that this album was mixed virtually guaranteed that none of these tracks will ever be played on a dancefloor.      The drums are mixed way too quietly and to the back.  Compare the original songs on this album to any of it's remixes or to any electronic music coming out these days and you will find it sorely lacking.      It's a shame.  The production is good.  The songwriting is okay.  But the mix has zero aggression.  Nothing.  It's like a wet blanket.    Breaks my heart.
B001QOOCTE|5.0|I loved the idea behind this cd/dvd combo. The music is great and the video is inspiring. I wish there were translations for some of the songs. Can't wait to see where and how far this idea will go.

B001J4E1D8|5.0|Tess of the D'Urbervilles was a completely captivating film, minute to minute.  Gemma Arterton was amazing and subtley yet dramatically nuanced as Tess's life situation changed.  I am a real fan of hers after this. Hans Matheson was excellently dark and forboding in his role as Alec, while Eddie Redmayne was alluring and vibrant as Tess's true love, Angel Clare.        Let me give you the real impact.  I showed it to my Drama classes toward the end of the school year.  They were absolutely riveted.  I never had such certain, regular attendance, no tardies even, because they were dying to know what would happen next.  They were on the edge of their seats from the start to the end of each class.  I did ease them into it in the beginning, explaining that the movie would begin slowly as the expository information about the name \\"D'Urberville\\", the nature of the countryside, and the lifestyles of the characters were revealed.        One more hint about the excellence of this movie lies in the fact that over the three-day Memorial Day weekend, one of my students called me begging me to let her borrow the dvd's because she was so in need of finding out how the story turned out.  I mean she sounded really desperate.  The next week, she had put a photo of Eddie Redmayne in her cell phone.        Aside from all that, \\"Tess\\" is a cinematic and dramatic work of art.  I am so glad that I own it.
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|I won't waste too much of your time peddling the legacy of Final Fantasy VII to you. If you appreciated the game then the likelihood that you ran out and purchased Advent Children back in 2006 is pretty high. While I enjoyed the romp that the sequel became, I found myself wondering whether or not I really needed Advent Children Complete.<br /><br />After viewing the movie last night, I can only say how this should have been what I watched back in 2006. Fluid, sensible, and more meaningful than it was three years ago, Advent Children Complete is a high quality and stirring Director's Cut.<br /><br />Emotionally gripping, visually enthralling, and as magical as the game was--Advent Children Complete is worthy of a 5 star review.
B000002N1E|5.0|I love Prince.  I used to own this CD, but it must have fallen through the cracks somewhere.  After the song \\"Billy Jack Bitch\\" popped into my head one day and I discovered I couldn't find the CD - I was happy to find it on Amazon.com.    Ralph
B001V9LRV0|2.0|I watch Woodstock on my old VHS tape I recorded years ago.  It is not the best quality but I love it.  There is a beauty about how Woodstock was; a feel that cannot be recreated.  It is sad to think people buying the dvds will be hearing 'fixed' Woodstock music.  It will take away from the feeling of the way it was. Please leave it alone.  It stands on its own as a masterpiece.  Some things should not be changed.
B00005JKG9|4.0|I wouldn´t rate this a must see, but if you're a sucker for good acting, this is a great movie to watch.  It epitomizes various employee attitudes(from around the world I would say) ranging from lazy detachment to desperation. If you're an employee, it is very likely that you see yourself in one of the characters and makes you think about whether it's something you like.  In any case, the twists and turns of the movie make for great entertainment value for a weekend with a bowl of popcorn on your lap.
0385340575|5.0|Have read all 13 thrillers by Mr. Child.  This was great.  I love his descriptions - you feel as if you are there.  Jack Reacher, well, LC writes him as well as any author I read.  Big Fan both of Reacher and Child.    The last third of this book is the best!!! You will not put the book down. If these circumstances are bizarre, so be it.  Entertaining, gripping and a good read.  I cannot ask more than that.     Loved the short chapters and, finally, a decent bookcover without a target on it. However, the UK's cover is better. (I notice those things.) :D
0385340575|5.0|Bad Jack is back  After several mediocre Jack Reacher novels, Lee Child is back with a superb action thriller reminiscent of his original Reacher books.  What makes Mr. Child's books so entertaining is his attention to detail as he develops the complex story.  Gone Tomorrow is classic Child right from the get-go, \\"Suicide bombers are easy to spot. They give out all kinds of telltale signs.\\"   Boom, it's off to the Reacher races.  Sharp, short, descriptive sentences that grabs the reader and immediately involves him/her in the violent world of Jack Reacher.  Gone Tomorrow is both a simple and complex tale.  It is layered just right to keep the reader guessing and uses misdirection as a literary art form.  Reacher is smart.  He uses his Common Sense and police mind experience to piece together a tale of violence and intrigue.  A woman, who Reacher thinks is a suicide bomber, commits suicide by gunshot on a subway when Reacher tries to intervene.  The cops come, he is detained as a witness, and the Gone Tomorrow tale takes off in literary fury.  Mr. Child is a true master storyteller and to tell you more would simply spoil this wonderful novel.  Outstanding character development.  I never tire of learning new facets of Jack Reacher's life.  Mr. Child has a unique way of fully developing all of his story's characters.  By the end of the book you feel like you know exactly who the main characters are and why they do what they do.  Refreshing and masterful use of an array of different character types.  No gratuitous language or sex but intense and graphic violence.  But isn't this why we read Mr. Child?  The author has this unique way of writing about violence in a way that is not gratuitous but story enlightening.  Reacher does what Reacher does because that is what is required of him to survive.  Strong recommend.  Worth the price of a hardback, or get it at your local library.  Jack Reacher is one of my favorite characters along with Harry Bosch and Mitch Rapp.  I'm very happy that Mr. Child has returned Jack to that apolitical, unflappable loner that we all have grown to admire and enjoy.  Looking forward to Mr. Child's next Jack Reacher novel,
B001MEJY8W|5.0|Being so disillusioned with American cinema, I find myself resorting to foreign horror films for my fix. America has become obsessed with the thought that remakes are the way of the future, and I never can support a remake, even if I like it. What's the point? I enjoyed The Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake. I enjoyed the Friday the 13th remake. I enjoyed the My Bloody Valentine remake. But the same question always popped into my head- what's the point? You don't see authors taking books and rewriting them. Sadly, you do see bands going back and rerecording songs or remixing them, and it always leads me to the same thought, not to mention blatantly points out the lack of creativity in pretty much every entertainment outlet, especially in America.<br /><br />What's a horror fan to do?<br /><br />For some time now, I have found myself drifting to foreign cinema. I loved Audition, but I was never a big fan of Ringu or The Grudge or any of the stuff. But French horror- there was my bag of tricks. After the outstanding Brotherhood of the Wolf, I sought out more French films, and landed on the amazing Inside. And it's this broadening of my horizons that ultimately led me to Martyrs.<br /><br />To be honest, I had read a lot of reviews about Martyrs, some good, some not so good, and I am kicking myself for having done so. I already knew some of the plot points and scenes... but for some reason, I was still surprised by them when they came.<br /><br />Why?<br /><br />Pascal Laugier has an excellent screenplay and does an even better job of getting the most that he can out of his actors and actresses. There are times in Martyrs where you will just want to break down with the characters, because it feels so REAL. It doesn't feel like you're watching a movie, it feels like you're actually right alongside these people as they go through what they do. The duo of Lucie and Anna is brilliantly constructed, and the two actresses have an amazing level of chemistry between them. The rest of the cast, which there isn't really too much of, have a lot to hold their own against.<br /><br />The camera work is also nothing short of spectacular, as every shot just seems to have a life of its own, at least in my opinion. There are some shots where it looks there might be hope, only to be dashed by a completely gloomy shot. There is no room to breathe here. It's straight forward for the first half, and then the film evolves into something different, something that gives justification to that graphic violence and torture we as the viewers are subjected to.<br /><br />The violence. I had heard people raving about how gory the movie was, how f'ed up the movie was, blah blah blah, but did it live up to it? In terms of brutality, oh yes, the movie was certainly brutal. But gory? Well, if you're comparing it to Prom Night, it's the equivalent of Inside. But comparing it to Inside? Not so much. There are several very bloody parts, but the movie isn't as gory as it is straight up violent. But there are reasons for it.<br /><br />The film was not only scary at times, but it was also truly emotional. Not for the actors, but for the audience. I have NEVER been affected so much by a film. I felt myself wanting to cry along with the characters, because everything was just so hopeless for them. I have never had any emotional connection to a film like I did with this one, and there was just such power in it as a whole, and I was even scared by it at times, another thing that hasn't happened to me in a long time. There is one particularly sad scene where I knew what was going to happen, and I found myself not wanting to see it. THAT has never, ever happened before. This movie evokes something from the viewer, something truly relatable, even if the majority of people never go through what these poor girls do.<br /><br />In the end, this film is definately not for everyone, but if you want a horror film for all ages, go see Prom Night. Martyrs is the horror fans horror film, but will more than likely appear to fans of truly moving and dramatic films as well.films as well.
B000ICL3KG|1.0|Let's all watch Al Gore's film on our energy sucking electronics so we can feel guilty for doing so.  The only person not feeling guilty about your destroying the planet to watch this film is Al Gore who is getting not-so-inconveniently paid by this truth.
B001TOVZYQ|5.0|I found both the first edition and director's cut double disc outstanding. But, I give the edge to the director's cut. Because it give more Chinese feeling and expression. It's slightly longer but, feel about the same time. But, it feels much more Wing Chung.  Keep in prospective that it is a movie and some of the facts are change for entertainment purposes. Its an outstanding movie!! They are both Outstanding!!
B000PXUA5W|1.0|The product was a gift for my son.  It didn't work correctly; the timing device had a malfunction.  We felt the product wouldn't last too long on active 7 year old.  It was very novel idea but it wouldn't be functional for long with all unclasping and wear.  We were disappointed in the quality.
B0007OY2P8|5.0|I have this movie on VHS but when I saw it on DVD, I had to buy it. I love Jane Austin and the movies made from her novels. This movie has the usual plot and twists of a Jane Austin novel but is still a good movie.
015206396X|5.0|I completely loved this book. The concept of being \\"Graced\\" is truely amazing. I highly recommend it to anyone. There is a lot of action and romance. Read it! You won't regret it!
B001UE276A|3.0|I would say that this box is for the die-hard collector only.  Sure, it has some bonus material, but nothing that is over the top.  I used to be a HUGE DM collector but DM has worn me and my pocketbook out.  Again, great for the collector - not for the casual fan.
B001QBC4AG|5.0|I have this one in other formats including the last special edition and this one is the ultimate \\"Who\\" Sells Out edition. I have been waiting for the original mono version for some time and to have the original stereo version as well plus a \\"you know what load of bonus tracks\\" this is any hardcore Who fans dream. Some of these tracks were around on vinyl singles as well as leaking out on The Who's 30 year box set but to get all those versions of \\"Mary Anne With The Shaky Hand\\", well, a track I always enjoyed. Of course every Who has a favorite on this one and if your a hardcore fan I highly recommend it, if the everyday fan, still a wonderful album on its own. I remember Pete Townsend said he could never understand why \\"I Can't See For Miles\\" never caught on, well, bet it has now as well as all of this album, recommend it, so get it.<br /><br />Visit me at \\"Judemac Forever\\" google it.
031606792X|1.0|`Blonde jokes', Bella talking non-stop about her incredible beauty, endless petty fighting between characters, rampant antifeminism, a disturbing anti-human sentiment, paedophilia.  Stephenie Bella Meyer Swan is back and as self-absorbed and nasty as ever.    Adjectives and adverbs are used to a laughable point. And the repetition is painful. Everyone's got `tight eyes', and Alice is always `dancing' everywhere.    Meyer trots out another string of beautiful blondes to show us how undesirable they are to her heroes. Can anybody say `wish fulfilment'?!    The Mormon overtones are so obvious it's frightening nobody much thinks about it. The Mormon-style baby naming of combining family names. Meyer attended Brigham Young University - a Mormon university - where they are constantly told to marry young and start reproducing; which is exactly what Bella Sue does. There's a frightening anti-abortion message: even if your spawn rips your body to shreds - kills you - you MUST fight everybody to keep it. Imprinting is essentially what Mormon `sealing' is.  And, no doubt, Meyer pays tithings, which would mean every year the fans are sending millions of dollars to the Mormon church.  How is it Americans were up in arms about a bit of magic in British Harry Potter books, but they're happy with paedophilia and religious propaganda in American Twilight books?    We've got more `werewolves' (sorry - at the very end of the book they are suddenly `shapeshifters') falling in love with babies. But don't worry, one special baby is going to be ready for sexual duties by her seventh birthday. How romantic.    The unintentionally hilarious scenes of the happy family - accompanied by paedophile Jacob - dressed to the nines, running off into the forest to guzzle on wild animals, tip this already ridiculous book even further over the edge.    The appeal of the initial story was the contrast between Bella's humanity and Edward's immortality. The moment Bella wakes up a wild huntress superheroin possession of a `love shield' we lose any possible connection we could have had with her, as she divides her time between admiring her own beauty and fantasising sexually about her husband (even when covered in blood, in a ripped cocktail dress, barefoot and in the middle of a forest).    And how about those deux ex machinas?! Isn't it great how every time there's a problem something miraculous pops up out of the blue to save the day? So once again none of our characters have to actually solve a problem, or - you know - do something.    Additionally, I have no idea how any intelligent or sane person can remain a Twilight fan after reading about Edward EATING mutant vampire baby spawn out of his wife. Romantic it is not.    This series is a disaster, but no installment so much as this final one.    I hope the next tween fad makes an appearance soon. Stephenie Meyer is definitely not deserving of any more money.    Avoid this ridiculously long mess.
B000ZLFALI|4.0|I rented this movie originally just to hear the Beatles soundtrack..then after that HAD to have it. Must have watched it at least ten times already..all the characters are good, the music still fantastic, and the second extras disc has lots of interesting stuff too. I bought two so I could give one as a gift. I enjoyed everything, including the fact that the two or three \\"leads\\" were all practically unknowns. If you like musicals, Beatles, a short 60s history lesson, it's all there..enjoy!

B001FB4W0W|5.0|True Blood is not the same as the book series - of course it cannot be. It is great to have two versions of this great story.    I honestly believe nobody should watch this show without reading the books. There is only so much you can tell on the screen, and to really know the characters the best way is to read about them in more depth.    The setting, the music, the scenery, the characters....this show creates such a convincing and different world that it draws you in and doesn't let go.    In this day of moronic sparkly vampires, isn't it great to have real vampires - real men and women - who do things vampires are supposed to do?! This is a version of vampirism that is dark and sexy. It's fascinating.    The cast does a great job. Anna Paquin is nothing like the Sookie of the books, but she's an incredible actress. Stephen Moyer is simply excellent as Bill, as are the actors playing just about every other role. Hopefully we'll get to see Eric doing his thing from season two on.    A few minor quibbles I have are not enough for the show to lose a star, but they're quibbles all the same. The sex sometimes detracts rather than adds to the story. One scene in particular - of Jason on his own - was so unnecessarily disgusting I always skip it. And I do not understand the - uh - `medical problem' with his lower area. What was the point in that?  Also, I get that Alan Ball wanted to build a love triangle, but Sookie getting it on with Sam while she feared for the life of the man she's supposed to love was just wrong.    However, these faults were more than made up for with some wonderful additions to the story that only book readers will be able to fully appreciate.    Plus you're never going to see a better opening title sequence!!    This is, without a doubt, the best thing on television today.
0375420525|5.0|I bought this book for a gift and had a limited amount of time to get it. But with the quick shipping everything turned out great! The book came in perfect condition, I have no complaints! It was well worth the price.

B000PC3D34|4.0|This book is better than the 1980s movie. Parts of the original story, that could have made the movie great, are not cut out. The story not only deals with interplanetary exploration; it also deals with interplanetary racism, murder, bigotry and conquest. Especially the idiocy of the first earth expeditions. A good read!
0743454537|1.0|OK, had to read this book in anticipation of the movie. My son has Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (different rare disease, yet similar implications) This author doesn't know what she's talking about. Treatments are different now. My youngest son, by chance, is an identical bone marrow match. The procedures (not talking about transplants), like bloodwork & donor marrow are relatively minor. I hate that this author exploited leukemia!!! My son with leukemia has a good life ahead of him.  Tyrosine Kinaise Inhibitor medicines are miraculous.  Bone marrow transplants have up to 90% success rates.  There are dire cases, but if you're going to write about them - learn about them first!!  At least go to the Leukemia/Lymphoma Society website! Discuss the facts with the very few of us who live with children who have rare leukemias. I wish the author did that instead of misusing the disease for a wimpy tear jerker. Life is up and down - not all down, down, tear and down as portrayed in this book. It angers me greatly. Now, I have to keep my hands on the remote to change the channel when ever the commercial comes up on tv. It's junk. I gave it one star because it's a book and I like books. That's it.
B00097DX3U|4.0|Out of Exile  being Audioslave's 2nd studio album and their 2005 release was met good reviews by the critics and Allmusic and the Austin Chronicle gave it both 4 stars. The album was also well received by the public and peaked at #1 on the Billboard 200 and the Canadian album chart. Singles released from this album were \\"Be Yourself\\", \\"Your time has come\\", \\"Doesn't remind me\\" and \\"Out of Exile\\". The booklet is quite nice with all the lyrics, some very nice photographs of the band. 4/5.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|It is hard to find words to describe this concert. So many great talents came out to pay tribute to George. He would be proud of this fantastic tribute to him and his music. There are so many great people; Tom Petty, Eric Clapton, RINGO STARR and PAUL MCCARTNEY! Even though I wasn't there in person, the energy of the crowd and music just flows out of the TV. I found myself singing and dancing in my living room. The best part is seeing Dhani on stage playing his dad's songs. It is a really fun DVD to have and you have to have it.
B0000524CY|3.0|The DVD came as advertised and is fine. Very, very disappointed in the vendor's shipping policy, however. Paid extra for expedited shipping based on the city listed and proximity to me. Also, paid full shipping for a second product, even though they shipped together. There was no option to save on shipping by ordering two products from the same vendor. The DVDs arrived well past the expected date and missed a critical birthday. Won't buy from this vendor again, despite the good products.
B0018YIFEK|1.0|I left another review yesterday. My son has Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (slightly different disease, similar implications.) Therefore, I thought I should read this book so that I could prepare him for the upcoming movie (and those dreadful commercials.) The author is a cheap charleton. She takes advantage of rare rare situations where there aren't enough people to stand up and complain. Well, I'm complaining. This lady stated on her website that she \\"walked in other peoples shoes.\\" Frankly, she hasn't come out of her ivory tower to even see mine or my son's.  Everything written is an overdeveloped, overexaggerated LIE. Chronic Pediatric cancers are quite manageable - even without a cure. And, even in the most dire situations, no parent of a pediatric cancer patient behaves as her characters did. Most of the procedures mentioned (except for transplants of course) are quite minor and not traumatic/dramatic at all. My younger son is an identical match for my older one. If the time comes for him to give some marrow, he'll gladly bend over & donate. This author treats my family's lives as a constant roller coaster ride that's all down hill.  IT'S NOT. OUR LIVES ARE NORMAL. I've NEVER had one hand on the phone to the doctor while worried about something with my son. My whole family has eased into this life long chronic situation. It's all very mellow.  This book makes me angry. The mellow drama is what's really diseased! NO ONE SHOULD PURCHASE THIS BOOK JUST TO MAKE THE INACCURATE AUTHOR RICH!!! ONE STAR ONLY BECAUSE I LIKE BOOKS.
B0017V7GLC|4.0|Velocifero  being Ladytron's 4th studio album and their 2008 release and the album was well received by the critics scoring 4 star reviews by Blender and PopMatters. Two singles has been released so far, these being \\"Ghosts\\" and \\"Tommmorow\\". The booklet contains no lyrics but we get a strange photo of the band members. I agree with the reviews and I also give this album 4 stars. 4/5.
0930289234|5.0|I am a quasi-fan girl who did not read Watchmen in the 80's.  I decided to read the novel prior to the movie coming out and I absolutely loved it.  It did lose me a few times in there but re-reading back a few pages set me straight.  I was especially intrigued by the Black Freighter story line and how it weaved into the story arc - so damn smart.  For those of you who like to think - pick it up and read it.
B000IU3XU6|1.0|The CD was defective.  My player cannot play it.  What can I do?
1423101472|5.0|I am a big fan of the Percy Jackson Olympian Series, and this final book was no let down.  I especially liked the fact that Riordan bought Hestia, the last Olympian, to life.  Usually, she is omitted, overlooked, forgotten, and in this book, her importance in Greek Mythology and her relevance to today's world is clear. The pace is fast, the imaginative plot takes original twists and turns, and the ending is satisfying.  An altogether great read.
B001SMC91M|5.0|Black Joe Lewis & The Honeybears debut album is packed full of James Brown's influence.  Listening to this, I could picture James on stage moving and shaking all around. There isn't one song on this album that isn't full of energetic Sax, Organs, guitars and drums.  Lead vocal Joe Lewis carries the songs with some decent vocals.  Who knows maybe here is James Brown's successor?  There's not a slow song on the set, so if you are into jazzy R&B this is definitely worth the look.
630522577X|5.0|I was surprised by how much of the song lyrics I had remembered from watching this movie MANY years ago as a kid. Now I have \\"Wouldn't it be Loverly\\" running through my head, and I don't mind one bit. This is one of those movies you can watch again and again, and enjoy it every time. Good stuff!

B001G1ACVY|5.0|This is a great cd full of great songs not only \\"I'm yours \\" which is all over the radio and in tv adds but all the songs are really good. But what makes this package well worth the money is the live dvd that alone is worth the price. Spend the extra cash and pick this one up
B0014Z4OQG|4.0|Cloverfield<br /><br />At first blush, Cloverfield is a monster movie that affects the common, everyday people who happen to be having a going away party.  But it's more than that.<br /><br />We are warned that this is video is property of the Department of Defense and is a recording found in a place formerly known as Central Park.  The story unfolds:<br /><br />Robert Hawkins, Beth and his friends are video'ing the going away party and suddenly a large crash is heard.  They run out and find that the city around them is coming apart!  No one knows what's happening or going on and somehow, their social veneer comes apart.<br /><br />A clumsy love story ensues partway through the film; we get somewhat enamored by the silly nerd who's running the camera so that \\"people know\\" what happened.<br /><br />It's like an American Godzilla!<br /><br />Yeah, on the surface, but what was Abrams trying to do with this film?<br /><br />I think the director Matt Reeves is making a statement about the quick YouTube like generation.  Hey, let's get this on video and upload it to YouTube wow, gee!  Can't tell if that is a criticism of this generation's propensity for the internet or the lack of social skills presented.  The constant documentary style of the handy video cam and cell phone camera is more than a subtle commentary.<br /><br />The plot rolls along nicely.  Little creatures peel of the main monster and make their home in the sewers of New York.  When they bite, somehow the victim eventually explodes.  This is never adequately explained, but the horror of losing your friend to this is not pretty -- a splatter on the tarmac is all you get!<br /><br />The tension of the film surrounds not only saving Beth (the girl with a rebar impalement problem) but these kids are caught between the monster and the military, barely escaping with their lives.  And then not even that!<br /><br />I understand the DVD has deleted scenes, a \\"making of\\" and a commentary by the director.<br /><br />The criticism of the shaky camera and the Blair Witch Project is a minor annoyance.  What are the director and producer doing?  What are they trying to say?  This was a bold experiment by Abrams.  Yes, could' a been done better, but not a bad first effort.  Where's the sequel??<br /><br />There is no film score, which makes sense since this is a civilian video.  And I will have to get the DVD now to catch the whisper at the end of the credits: \\"Help Us, It's Still Alive!\\"<br /><br />[[ASIN:B001886LQU Cloverfield (Widescreen) Limited Edition Steelbook]]<br />[[ASIN:B0014Z4OQG Cloverfield]]nnoyance.  What are the director and producer doing?  What are they trying to say?  This was a bold experiment by Abrams.  Yes, could' a been done better, but not a bad first effort.  Where's the sequel??

And I will have to get the DVD now to catch the whisper at the end of the credits: \\"Help Us, It's Still Alive!\\"      [[ASIN:B001886LQU Cloverfield (Widescreen) Limited Edition Steelbook]]  [[ASIN:B0014Z4OQG Cloverfield]]
B00129H7VS|5.0|Eu adorei a mini serie, j&aacute; tinha em DVD, e tive que comprar em Blu-ray. E de fato, não decepciona! O som e imagem estão muito bons.
B001HYX3IY|2.0|I thought the cd purchase was the whole book, not a few chapters. The purchase however, not being what I wanted was good for the limited information.
B001KVZ6FM|5.0|Overall excellent! My fiance and I went to go see this together and the first few minutes definitely had us in tears! It was a well-made movie (barring a few logical inconsistencies) that definitely made great points about the importance of marriage, family, and generational relationships. There were many clever elements from the dogs to the character and plot development. There was much more peril and drama than I was expecting for a kids' movie so I would advise parents to screen it before bringing sensitive kids. It was my first experience with the new 3D technology and that made it even more enjoyable!

B00013F38K|5.0|\\"Kung Fu\\", featuring David Carradine as the fugitive Shaolin priest Kwai Chang Caine, was a TV phenomenon of the early 1970's and its martial arts craze.  If the fighting scenes look less dramatic to audiences used to the high skills and special effects of today's martial arts movies, the gentle message of stoic tolerance holds up extremely with time.  This DVD set contains the pilot TV movie and the 15 episodes which comprised the first season, along with a few extra features on the production of the show.<br /><br />The format of the show will be familiar to its fans.  Caine wanders the American West of roughly the 1870's, on the run from the killing of a member of the Chinese Royal Family.  Caine, half American and half Chinese, will search for a long missing brother while dodging Chinese agents and US law.  Each episode pits Caine against a situation in the present to which his past as a disciple and a priest in a Shaolin Temple in China provides guidance.  The parallel story arcs allow the viewer to see how the young Caine learns the wisdom and discipline the mature Caine applies in the present.  The stories were driven by subtle moral dilemmas and by a rotating cast of guest stars, of which this first season features Jody Foster and John Saxon, among others.  The humble Caine does endlessly good in his own way but seems never able to stay.<br /><br />\\"Kung Fu: The Complete First Season\\" is very highly recommended to fans of the series and of recently deceased actor David Carradine in what became his signature role.
B001QOOCTE|5.0|Wonderful music. My son (14 months old)and I love to listen and dance to the music. Thank you for this wonderfully, cultural rich experience.
0879309210|5.0|This is a \\"Must\\" for any beginner who wants to save money and actually enjoy the experience of being a guitarist. Now that I have this book, I actually do consider myself a true guitarist. I have pride when I tell my friends \\"I take care of my guitar myself\\". I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to build their own guitars from anything from kits to garage sale parts. It even tells you what to look for and what to bring with you when you go buy a guitar (on the DVD). From common problems with stringing acoustics, adjusting any neck problem, to how to paint any axe. Those who are more serious, will enjoy the shop tool and benches he (and his friends) shows you how to build. Yes, there is a lot of product placement- buy this, buy that- but it doesn't require you to purchase anything. It just depends on how serious you want to get. I will own this book forever and will most likely purchase the next addition. I'm very pleased with this purchase.
0743455967|4.0|I've just finished reading this. I began it last night as something to read before turning out the light, and found I had to put it down reluctantly, when the graininess of my eyes told me it was time to sleep. When I left for work this morning it was in my bag.     While computers were running maintenance programs, I was reading. While I ate my lunch I read. During smoko, it was my companion and when my wife went to umpire netball this evening, I sat on a sofa and read till I finished it.    I found it to be a compelling read (duh!). And extremely funny in places. Stephen is up front with his experiences that helped develop the writer, millions have come to love. His thoughts on how to write, the mechanics, what works and what doesn't, is thought provoking at worst, eye-opening almost always. He passes judgment on other writers across a multitude of genres, makes comment on the tools a writer needs, critique groups, readers, schedules, word counts and even provides a book list of the titles he's read over the four or five years preceding this book's publication.    He also talks candidly about his accident in 1999.    I've heard in reviews, from other writers, and on the grapevine that as a new writer, I should definitely read this. Now, in this review, I'm repeating that advice. Every writer should read this.     Not everything in it will be of use to every writer. But there will be something that strikes a chord with anyone who has ever put pen to paper (or fingers to keys) with the goal of publication.    I'm not going to go into detail on the contents of the book--you need to go out and buy your very own copy. At less than $10AU at just about anywhere that sells books, not just any good bookstore, you will gain more than your money's worth.    In case I haven't made my opinion clear on this book--go and buy it! I'll be referring to my copy for many years to come.

B001K3JF7K|5.0|I've been following Ms. Krall's recorded output for the past 10 years and while I've yet to encounter a recording I didn't enjoy, I have to say that she really hit this one completely out of the park.  Sublime.  I've purchased this disc as a gift for both my parents and my girlfriend and they love it as well.  I've yet to read the other reviews but if there are any less than flattering reviews out there, they must have received a different recording or something.  Buy it.

I had reservations about getting it because of the format...all letters.  But it was brilliant.  You can't go wrong buying this book.  It will be one that you will remember for a very long time and for all the right reasons.
1416914307|5.0|Cassandra Clare is a writer that only comes along once in a while; One who can describe and create scenes and dialogue so vivid that it takes you into a story so deep that you are a part of it.   \\"City of Glass\\" is a touching, heartbreaking and joyous end to this fantastic series. Clare provides us with characters that are funny, secretive, challenged, proud and vulnerable. This extends through all her books and throughout this third novel.   This is a series that will cause you to challenge your morals and personal value on life and love, and root for characters you know in your heart. Reading these collections will open your eyes to a type of writing that you yearn for from the first page until the last - and long after.
B000009FJL|4.0|Not bad considering this is really the 1st album of the Genesis we consider Genesis (try to catch their bio on the Biography Channel).  The six songs are very listenable, reflect the intricate detail we expect from early Genesis, and you will not be disapointed in you already like Foxtrot thru Wind and Wuthering. I had it on vinyl and now on CD.

0312330537|5.0|Ok let me first say that this maybe my favorite fiction book ive ever read and ive read thousands. Roberts give such heartfelt emotions in this book its unreal. Now ive read the reviews of this and some people gave this book 1 star because of things like over writting or bad editing what are you people NUTS this man wrote this book with 10 years left in prison who is going to edit the book for him? Why wouldent he over write he has a awsome story to tell. I would give this man 5 stars just for transforming his life from a junkie to a writer. Shame on anyone who puts this man down becouse in there snobish ways they dont like his pros or his muse. Get real the man wrote it in a prison cell and its great. I dont want to even give away the plot becouse this is a book that your going to want to go into not knowing whats going to happen. Not only that his views and experiences in India are right on the Indian people are a mixed bag but they are great spiritual people and they come alive with great humanity in this book. Get it!!!
B001DHXT6G|4.0|These ofcourse are the REMASTERED Editions of thre Original Series.<br /><br />The Quality is the best since they went back to the best possible footage (which they shouda done with the Original Un-Cut set in 2004 instead of using VHS quality prints).<br /><br />The price is outragious for a 1960's series thats now been released to DVD the 3rd time now, sure its updated with computer graphics, but its much cheaper to have updated this series than to create a whole new sci-fi series (many of which sells cheaper for complete seasons on DVD than Star Trek).<br /><br />Comments on REMASTERING this classic show.....<br /><br /> One thing that made Star Trek \\"cool\\" was how they did so well whith their imgaination with such a small budget, its fun to see 1960's tv's with its model ships and such.  Now thats taken away, you have a 1960's looking show when we see the crew of inside the ship, then we have this 2007 computer generated star ship and alien ships when in that mode.<br /><br />I can see having both TOS editions available, I cant believe Paramount has discontinued the original un-cut series on DVD...its like what New Coke did the the Classic Coke.<br />But Im sure it will be back in a year or so, ofcourse with new packaging, a few new featurettes and a new price, just another way to rehash the same stuff and sell more units.  It all about the dollar.<br /><br />The bottom line...the show didnt need any updating except using the best possible film stock and transfering that to DVD but it is what it is and its not bad.

B001MW0J2O|2.0|This is exactly the kind of music that I truly despise. There are some decent tunes here, but all killed off with over-instrumentation and excessive experimentation. On the surface it functions as a pretentious art-rock record, proclaiming itself to be wiser than it actually is. Way below though, its evident that the entire album is just a collection of semi-interesting sounds, each with no particular direction. At the end of the album, you have no sense of cohesiveness or completion - its as if you've sat through an endless stream of sample tapes, all dressed up with nowhere to go.<br /><br />\\"Merriweather Post Pavilion\\" suffers because of the overwhelming positive reviews posted on the internet, much of it terming Animal Collective as having broken new ground with this album. This is definitely not true though. The way I see it, the album is nearly unlistenable in parts - as if random ideas were thrown together and the band said \\"Lets see how far we can go with this\\". Which is fine - I mean, a band should constantly reinvent itself and explore new territory, musically, but on this album it comes at a cost.<br /><br />Someone said that this was a 'concept album'. What a joke. The lyrics are very badly pronounced and enunciated, the instruments drown out the vocals, and seriously, isn't anyone else tired of the 'epic string section' that pops out of nowhere to make the song a 'classic'. Even Coldplay knows better than this - and I count that band as one of the greatest musical travesties of this century. The various attempts to gloss up this album are only all too apparent, and listened to as one set-piece (which is what I did), I'm afraid that there is nothing here that is actually that memorable.<br /><br />Yes, indeed, there are tunes here. But mostly they seem to be half-developed ideas that are abandoned even before the song is over! What the intent behind this was, is unclear, but it does not make for a very satisfactory listening experience. Comparing this to \\"Veckatimest\\" by Grizzly Bear is unfair, only because the latter is an actual album of proper songs - ones that make sense, even though their lyrics might be sort of infantile.<br /><br />\\"Merriweather Post Pavilion\\" is one of those lucky animals that got all of this pre-release hype and for some reason, the album has garnered a cult following. Its the opposite for me though - I can't say this one has any repeat value, and at best it was an interesting oddity amongst this years' releases. If they were to work on the tunes here, strip down the instrumentation and do an acoustic set, then maybe I'd listen to that. In its current form, its boring, inspid and inconsequential.<br /><br />Two Stars.y Bear is unfair, only because the latter is an actual album of proper songs - ones that make sense, even though their lyrics might be sort of infantile.    \\"Merriweather Post Pavilion\\" is one of those lucky animals that got all of this pre-release hype and for some reason, the album has garnered a cult following.

031606792X|2.0|Whew. Nearly 800 pages. I'll say this much on the positive side -- it still felt like a quick read although my arms hurt from holding it. So much for the positive. Wow, was that awful. After being pleasantly surprised by the first book, a bit put off by the second and then reengaged by the third, I went into this conclusion pretty psyched. And then the romance just faded. Not just my romance with these novels, but The Romance between Bella and Edward, which was pretty much the whole point. As a fan of supernatural stories I can suspend disbelief pretty easily. Let's face it from the get-go vampires were known to be sexy and seductive even though we all know that technically without flowing blood some things should be impossible. After this there will be spoilers so be warned ...<br /><br />Therefore, it's not the mechanics of the pregnancy that bugged me but rather how the baby story line added yet another love interest for Bella and stretched the romance out even further. Frankly, it pulled it the point of breaking. First there were two. Then there was a triangle. And lastly there was a very squicky pairing between a grown up and a child that we were supposed to accept as part of a happy ending.<br /><br />Yet all that is not the problem with this novel. What makes the book ultimately fail its predecessors is that there is no longer any price for the huge decision that Bella must make. Once she choose Edward I thought we might be allowed a little exploration of that price -- would it be worth it? Would things change when they were equal? Might there be one final obstacle for their journey as a couple? It's not so much the fact of the happy ending (this is a teen romance after all) but that it was accomplished with no cost. Sure there was drama -- a disgusting birthing scene worthy of the goriest slasher tale, a kinda battle of wits and a tiny surprise-lite ending to resolve that conflict. But the angst that was the bedrock of the previous three books wasn't felt any longer. Maybe the perfect child sapped it away. Kids can kill romance :) Or maybe it was just a writer who was rushed and rather done with her story.the perfect child sapped it away.

B0017R5UAA|3.0|Clearly, its evident that whenever the collective blogosphere hypes an album, it immediately becomes a 'classic' of its genre and 'the greatest album ever made', etc. This has happened time and time again, especially in the years 2008-2009, and we've had to suffer the likes of Animal Collective and Grizzly Bear produce good albums that critics are only too eager to brand 'masterpieces'.<br /><br />Which is sad, really, because all the above artists are good, but none of them have actually released an album that stands the test of time. Grizzly Bears' latest \\"Veckatimest\\" is an example of a good record dressed up in costumes far beyond its' actual worth - and the embarrassing positive reviews for that album should be read to be believed - its as if the record could cure a terminal illness! The same can be said of Animal Collective's overhyped and overrated 2009 album, which at best was a 'collection of interesting sounds'.<br /><br />Fleet Foxes are a band that sounds good, relaxing even. They are rather talented and can produce a good pop-rock song. But beyond that I certainly cannot understand why they are so revered. Its true - their talents are enhanced by the production on this album - every song a cool, light tune that reeks of violins, strings, and classical instrumentation. Very pretty indeed, and they sound good live. Which is not to say that \\"Fleet Foxes\\" isn't a good album - it definitely is, but if you go into it reading various reviews, you are very likely going to be disappointed, for sure.<br /><br />Like any true lover of independent music would tell you, listen to the music first, spend some time with it, and don't believe everything you read. For every undeserving, overhyped band out there, there are tons of others who actually deserve more recognition (Isobel Campbell & Mark Lanegan, Jasmine Star, Au Revoir Simone, Lisa Gerrard), and its a pity that so many people hailed this as a groundbreaking album when in fact its just another light above-average CD.<br /><br />Three Stars.
0375842209|5.0|The Book Thief by Markus Zusak is a brilliantly crafted and gorgeously written piece of historical fiction. Narrated by Death (who does not carry a scythe by the way, but is otherwise tickled by the oft used description), it is a story about a young girl growing up with foster parents on a poor street outside Munich during Nazi Germany.     This is a story that reminds us that war and death are best friends, people are not always as they seem, and simple acts of kindness sometimes change the world. Please, do yourself a favor, read this book. Simply magnificent!
B000T9OP7G|5.0|While only a short season, it makes for great TV.  The show was significantly better than T3, and the second season only got better.
037582913X|4.0|Normally I steer clear of books about TV characters because of their low story quality.  This story, however, is a hilarious page-by-page running joke, in which Grover, after reading the title, begs the reader not to turn the pages because he is afraid of meeting the monster.  He erects barriers to page-turning which are destroyed as pages are turned, and when the last page is turned he discovers that he is the monster referred to in the title.<br /><br />The humor turns on the fact that the author draws attention to the book context of interaction by having Grover directly address the reader, and by depicting physical objects ostensibly intended to block the pages from turning.  Children will tremendously enjoy the feeling of knowing something Grover doesn't know, and will savor the situation comedy of Grover's failed attempts to resist their overwhelming page-turning force. The story ends with a moment of delicious irony in which Grover claims \\"I told you and told you there was nothing to be afraid of,\\" but then his thought bubble appears: \\"Oh, I am so embarrassed.\\"<br /><br />This book does come in a board book format, but by the time a child is ready for this level of humor they will have outgrown board books, so I recommend the paper version.
B00000JNO1|4.0|Even if you're a casual Skynny Fan and you've happened to overlook this album you are extremely lucky because you're in for a treat.  It's like the blockbuster movie you never bothered to watch, then finally viewed it many years later and went, \\"WOW.\\" I find myself listening to each track over and over till every note/lyric is etched in my soul. Like Ronnie once said, \\"There're things goin' on you don't know...\\"  NUTHIN' FANCY'S one of them.
0312360266|1.0|I wanted to love this book so much. It seemed like it had the potential to be greatly entertaining. But, the more I tried to love the main characters, the more I felt personally offended by how religion was bad-mouthed the whole way through. I think it would have been simple to show the Vampire's religion without making other religious people out to be psychopaths.<br /><br />Honestly, is this a vampire novel or so sort of attempt at slapping the Christian faith in the face?<br /><br />The \\"Open-minded\\" people in this book are complete unaccepting of other faiths (hypocritical), and the Faith is described as an evil group and based off of extremely discriminatory view of religion, and there is unnecessary cussing and sexual reference especially for a young adults book. If Stephanie Myer can write an entire series without insulting people, why can't Marked get through more than a couple chapters?<br /><br />The book has no RESPECT for it's readers. I think it could have been done a lot of tastefully and turned out fantastic, if only the writer didn't feel the need to exact some sort of revenge through a novel that's suppose to entertain.<br /><br />The series seemed like it could have been interesting, it's too bad. I will not be buying anymore.<br /><br />I've read alot of novels over the last few months, almost every Vampire book recommend by amazon and alot more fantasy and fictions, around 30 since the year started, and this is the only series that I've felt deserved such a low rating.

B001N26GFM|5.0|This is an extremely good movie. It somehow manages to be simultaneously beautiful and tragic, innocent and terrifying. Doing what no film has ever done before, it shows the Holocaust through the eyes of an innocent 8-year-old German boy. Though young Bruno may not understand the events unfolding around him, the viewer certainly will. While little or nothing is directly shown (making it an excellent means of introducing younger viewers to the history of the Holocaust), you have no trouble knowing what is happening. I loved the shooting style used in this film, as it successfully captures the innocent view of a child during one of the darkest periods in world history. This also serves to make it even more disturbing, though also more real, as you see Bruno attempt to make sense of what is going on in his world. Then, if all that wasn't enough, the whole film comes to a close with one of the hardest hitting endings ever done on film. My mother and I both were crying throughout, and were left off staring in wide-eyed terror. I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone and everyone. It isn't a happy movie, but it's an important one. I now plan on reading the book as well.
B001P5Q6F2|1.0|pure junk.. what a waste of my time. been a long time LOG fan and this album is pure mismashed junk thrown together just to make a quick buck.no hooks no grunt or chug from the guitar work, and by the way piss poor drumming by one of the greatest thunder gods of the new millenium.and the vocals... ha I didnt know they let chad gray from mudvayne sing parts on a few tracks. where is the familiar growl from Blythe? a total dissappointment and hopefully things can get better for LOG.this is only my opinion and I think I can speak for many LOG fans that this CD is crapola!
B000BZISTE|5.0|One of the great films. Interesting that Sutherland and Gould thought it was a career ender. Quite true to the book which is worth reading.  And always keep in mind that it was made during our Vietnam period, the draft, and probably the most unpopular mis-adventure by our government.  When was the last time you knew someone engaged to 3 women...  I rest my case.

1433503794|3.0|I would just like to say I love the layout and design of this bible. The articles and notes are well written. Even as thick as this bible is, it still amazes me how much information the publishers were able to fit into it. It is like having a complete commentary in addition to a bible. The full color illustrations are wonderful and very insightful and really allow you to understand what you are reading about. The bible has a calvanistic tone to it, which I find most agreeable.<br /><br />Now for the bad news. CHECK THIS BIBLE AS SOON AS YOU RECEIVE IT!!! Thumb through all the pages. My original bible had a section of about 80 pages where the printing was blurred very bad. Some pages were so bad you could hardly read the text. I would not have discovered it, but thanfully my pastor had us turn to a passage in that section and I noticed the defect. Otherwise, I probably would have missed the return window to send the bible back. I have since received two replacement copies, and both are flawed in the same way, but in different sections. The last replacement I received has the blurred pages in Psalms, but it is limited to about 12-15 pages. It almost looks like the pages moved during printing. Also, there is some wrinkling of the pages near the binding, almost as if the binding was pulled too tight during that process, causing the pages to wrinkle somewhat. That is a minor flaw I could live with, but the blurred pages are extremely difficult to read.<br /><br />Amazon has currently pulled this item as they are going to check their stock. When they make it available again, I intend to order another replacement, as the bible itself is great! Amazon has been very understanding and has really bent over backwards to work on getting the issue resolved.<br /><br />If not for the quality control, I would rate this bible 6 stars!! I forsee it remaining as my main bible for a long time to come.

Catchy electronic dance numbers and a 2nd disc of 'Dub Mixes' make this CD worth getting. Neil Tennants' vocals are fresh and clever lyrics help make this production one of the best releases this year. If you haven't bought a PSB release in a while, this is a great one to get you back into why you liked them in the first place. Go Get YES!

B001FB55H6|4.0|Not familiar with the graphic novels, I can only state my opinion regarding the film. When I first saw the trailer for Watchmen, I instantly knew it was the greatest movie trailer I have ever seen, and probably will see. It was like nothing I had ever witnessed. I was hooked without knowing literally anything about the film, the comics, the characters, or the plot.    Upon watching it, I knew I liked it alot, but wasn't sure whether I loved it. With so much packed into movie that-even at 3 hours, is a bit short- I knew it would require multiple viewings before I could form a proper opinion. The plot is a bit confusing and so much is going on at the same time, that it becomes difficult to keep track of everything, unless you are familiar with the graphic novels, I assume.    Character-wise, I thought everyone did a fantastic job. Dr. Manhattan and Rorschach were my two faves. I love characters with depth and mystery, and they had both in abundance. The rest of the cast is just as strong and well-balanced in film.    The special effects are just ridiculously awesome. There really cannot be one single complaint about anything visual on screen.     Plot-wise, I think the director did a fine job in the allotted time and while convoluted and messy at times, it was still enjoyable enough to keep my interest for the entire film-and wish for even more.    A word of caution, though by now everyone probably has figured out that this film is quite adult in every regard and cannot be put in the same league as your standard comic book films. This is not Spiderman. It is not even Batman. This is a very graphic  anti-superhero film with enough blood, language, nudity, violence and sexual content to keep any ADULT happily engaged. I do not, under any circumstances, recommend anyone under the age of 17 to watch this.

SPECTACULAR DETAIL. WORTH THE PRICE.
0756404746|5.0|This book is by far one of the best fantasy novels I have read in the past 10 years. The characters are believable, the storyline is original, and the world is incredibly detailed. After I purchased this book, I had trouble getting my work done for days.     I can't wait for the sequel.
B001GCUNYO|5.0|If you are looking for a movie with a lot of action then look no further. Taken has it all...great storyline/plot, great cast, GREAT chase scenes, and A LOT of action.  The previews do NOT do the justice for the movie. There is a lot more action sequences than what is shown in the previews. I was really impressed that it has a lot of action but it had a great enough storyline to keep me interested and entertained. This movie is really believable and heartfelt because it is about a father's love for his daughter and he will do anything for his daughter. There are not that many movies out there anymore that makes the father out to be the HeRo like this movie does.    Short storyline: Former CIA Agent Bryan Mills (Neeson) daughter,Maggie, goes on a trip out of the country to Paris with her friend only to get kidnapped by a group of men who \\"sells\\" (traffics) them to the highest bidder. Mills has to use every skill that he knows to find out who these men are, find out where they live, and stop them before his daughter gets hurt. He doesn't let anything or anyone get in his way of finding his daughter.    I highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good storyline and to anyone who likes a lot of action. There is killing in this movie but it is NOT the over the top gory kind which is another reason I liked it.
630589938X|5.0|This is a classic 80's style horror movie. Loaded with suspensful music and, at times, cheesy acting, this film is exactually how I remembered my 80's childhood. Who would have known that a movie made about a rabid St.Bernard dog could still evoke fear?!?! Two thumbs up!!!
0375842209|5.0|I loved this book..What a terrific young lady Liesel was...And what a picture of WWII it painted.
0060989157|5.0|Book is a fun and interesting read.  I hope they come out with book 2.    This was a good peak into a world that the majority of us will never partake in (or would want to).  I totally enjoyed this Book.
B0010VD7EO|5.0|seriously, i have 'time to pretend' stuck in my head all the time! in a good way though. if you like santigold, flaminglips, that kind of thing you're pretty much guaranteed to like these guys. good synth, good voices, great lyrics. love it. btw...they are not called management. hardcore fans of the band WILL eviscerate you if you use that word in reference to this group.    good stuff though.
1416511946|5.0|Wow what an interesting read and insight in to the mind of an Addicted Nikki Sixx.  Book was fantastic!
6302470021|1.0|If you are searching for a dvd copy of the Barry Nelson/Climax Theater 1954 tv presentation DO NOT BUY THIS EDITION. I'm VERY UPSET that Amazon used a review of the 2002 dvd release as a review for the 2008 Collectors/40th Anniversary Edition because I purchased this POS movie solely for that special feature. I guess I should read the reviews a bit more closely!!
B001R7IHA0|5.0|I'm not a big country fan, but have been greatly impressed by Keith's previous two albums. So much mainstream pop/rock music these days is either some over-produced mediocre \\"young hottie\\" or low-fi AAA, so whenever I hear something well written, produced and performed, I buy it. That is usually something that sells less than 100k CD's. I heard the previews of Defying Gravity and wasn't too impressed. Heard his duet with Kris Allen \\"Kiss a Girl\\" on the Idol finale and was VERY impressed!  Bought the CD and love it! Read his bio recently and saw he played in both C&W bands and \\"West Coast\\" rock bands in Australia, so his partnership with Dann Huff makes sense (ex-rock band [Giant, White Heart]/studio guitarist turned Nashville producer) melding the two genres. Keith's relaxed vocals and stage presence are only matched by his guitar virtuoso and songwriting skills. Very FM radio friendly music, expect it to be on the charts for two years, until his next release. Buy this CD!
B000025O03|5.0|This album sounds superb. Living Colour develop the style which emerged in \\"Kaleidoscope\\" more consistently. The sound is incredibly solid and heavy (in the best sense of the word), the lyrics are bleak an funny, the guitar paying is superb as ever and the vocals very strong. The music is much richer than most heavy rock and reminds me of the best of industrial rock.
B001QERPDO|2.0|Disappointing!  I bought this because I loved the song \\"Man that can't be moved\\".  Basically the only good song on the CD.  Most of the music is Rap-like.  Not what I expected.
B00000ADG2|5.0|I was only around 11 when this CD came out! I first heard it play in my cousin's car and though young at the time I knew this was what music was about. With that said, Lauryn stuck with me through all these years and she is my #1 artist of all time. I was recently playing the album and decided to go see what reviews were like on Amazon. I was shocked there were even 1 stars. Are you kidding me? I think the majority of the folk who gave it one star are either plain stupid and ridiculous or are some real racist individuals. This album is still a timeless classic and will always be.
B000000WZ4|5.0|By far one of D M s best,  I recommenend it greatly!  you wont be disapointed..
159102594X|2.0|Joe Abercrombie is an above average writer who spun a tale with action, wit, and generic characters.  From the barbarian with hard exterior but is a \\"good person\\" who is trying to live another day, to the gambler looking to win a fencing contest, the characters felt more like caricatures of other fantasy characters.  I was unable to connect to the characters through the first half of the book.    I call this novel worth reading, but nothing groundbreaking.
B001VS46DC|4.0|This DVD offers a good concert featuring the D. Krall Quartet (plus a Brazilian orchestra for some songs), they are just great. The DVD is much better than her recent Quiet Nights CD.  It is a pitty that Mrs. Kralls does not play the piano that much and the group has a stronger basis on Anthoy Wilson's great work at the guitar. Hamilton and Coleman are their own regular gery good musicians.  I recommend the DVD.
0385495323|5.0|More than a history of cryptography, this book could be called a set of  stories about the topic. Which is not a demerit, on the contrary, adds  amenity to a topic that on one hand is interesting and entertaining (who  doesn't like to keep one's secrets and break those of others?) but on  the other hand may be hard (the mathematics and algorithms). The author  copes very well with the fun part and really quite well with the other   part, taking into account that this is not a text book but a informational   and even recreational book.    A reader not familiar with algorithms or computing may still be able to  grasp most of the ideas and every reader will surely enjoy of the well  documented stories on which the book is built. The language is clear  and simple (I am not an English native speaker and nevertheless I can  read it quite easily) so I think that even children of about 12 y.o.  and up may find the book interesting.
B000SEGMAU|5.0|This is my favorite book of all time. I have read it cover to cover at least 10 times. Whenever life gets me down I turn to this inspirational story.
B0002DB0FO|4.0|I bought this as a gift for an Everwood fan and she was thrilled. I was disappointed to find two out of three of the DVD holders had come loose from the binding. Upon examination, I found that the inside spine of the binding had printing (and clay coating) on it. No wonder the glue failed to adhere. After removing the coating with sandpaper and applying hot glue, the package was ready for gifting. Did not realize that 'some assembly is required.'
1423101472|5.0|An almost epic ending to an epic series. I thought that the last chapter could have summed the story up more than it did. Unless of course we get another installment, which I doubt would happen but I will keep my fingers crossed.
B000002J0P|2.0|I bought this original cd release and the recording quality was HORRID. So I bought the \\"remastered\\" edition and if it is any better at all, it was undetectable to these ears. This was obviously a lousy recording from the get-go, so do not waste you money on the remastered version. The only possibly worse CD release (audio-wise) is Neil Young's \\"Harvest.\\" What a shame.
B000MCH5P4|4.0|Babel is such a fitting title for this movie that focuses on the theme of universal pain and hope. All the different barriers we face with the clash of cultures were very well demonstrated. Great movie, but it was a little too real and frustrating at times.<br /><br />I cried at the end, way too much for my own good. I sat there with my tear-stained, mascara-smeared face and was surprised at my outburst of emotions. It was just so powerful and wonderfully moving...or maybe I just get too into movies. Anyway, I highly recommend it.
0689865384|5.0|A nice beginning for what looks to be an exciting trilogy. Can't wait to get my hands on the next one. :)
0439023483|5.0|When Katniss Everdeen finds herself a contestant in the annual Hunger Games, she considers herself a goner. Out of 24 teenaged contestants chosen from the 12 districts of Panem, only 1 will emerge victorious. The rest will be slaughtered. By each other. And the entire event will be televised from the Capitol for the entire nation to watch.      If you had described the basic plot of the Hunger Games to me and told me that it was going to be THE book to read in 2008, I probably would have raised an eyebrow. Futuristic? And dystopian? AND gladiatorial? Despite the seemingly disparate elements, Suzanne Collins somehow managed to hit upon the perfect combination in this thrilling story about a girl who lives in a nation obsessed with violence and reality television. There is action, romance, deception, humans hunting humans (Most Dangerous Game, anyone?) surgically altered stylists (reminiscent of Scott Westerfeld's Uglies), genetically enhanced mutants, a cruel totalitarian government, and a unspoken mandatory creed to treat the entire event as if it were a holiday.     I read Hunger Games from start to finish in a day while I was supposed to be studying for finals. I meant to read a chapter or two and then go back to work, but I just could not put it down. Hunger Games is the kind of book that continues to haunt you days and weeks after you've turned the final page. I absolutely recommend it to everyone, with the one caveat that it does feature brutal violence between children and is perhaps not for the faint of heart. The next book can't come fast enough! In the mean time, I'm going to go learn how to shoot a bow, you never know when you're going to need to know how!
B00288KNL8|5.0|Question: What would you get if Alice Liddell married Jack Skellington?<br /><br />Answer: CORALINE<br /><br />The animated film, CORALINE is a deliciously eerie movie adaptation of the novel by Neil Gaiman.  This dark odyssey starts with a young girl's boredom and ends with her being appreciative of her own backyard. Both figuratively and literally. It is a well-told tale reminiscent of Through the Looking Glass, The Wizard of Oz, and Hansel and Gretel. What I particularly liked about the tale was that CORALINE's parents are alive and remain so from beginning to end. Yeah for living parents!<br /><br />When first we see CORALINE (not Caroline, as she has to remind folks quite often) (voiced by Dakota Fanning), she is bored. She lives in an apartment with her mother and father, both of whom work from home but can't give her the attention she craves. She tries visiting the old Vaudevillian ladies who live upstairs as well as the crazy old man who trains the mice, but she just doesn't understand them. Huh. Then she finds the key and the door, and the passage beyond that's sometimes there and sometimes not. The old man says that the mice have a message for her: don't enter the passage. If only CORALINE had listened.<br /><br />What CORALINE finds beyond that passageway is what makes this story interesting. It's what makes all classic fairytales interesting. Temptation, morality, determination, and heroism, all wrapped up like a spooky burrito with a side order of eerie dipping sauce.<br /><br />CORALINE is a dark movie, full of black magic and creepy critters.  Brilliantly directed by Henry Selick (who brought us THE CORPSE BRIDE, JAMES AND THE GIANT PEACH, and THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS) and Michael Cachuela, CORALINE is fast paced and contains just the right amount of spookiness.  My 12 year old LOVED this film, and my 4 year old liked it, too.  She did not have any bad dreams, and she completely understood that it was not real.  The animation is unique and very moody - perfect for this film.  The voice talent is all outstanding, but truly you are more interested in this weird and wonderful story than you are the voices.<br /><br />CORALINE is a MUST SEE movie for 2009 and is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED by my entire family.

B001PJRAUS|4.0|\\"Lost In Austen\\" is a 3+ hour program that finds a modern day English woman suddenly back in time and living with the Bennett family of Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice.\\"    Amanda Price, our heroine, longs for romance and the refined manners of Austen's era.  She knows all the characters of the book almost better than her own friends.  When Amanda finds herself trading places with Elizabeth Bennett the events of book start changing and Amanda works very hard to get the right couples together.  She keeps telling Darcy about Elizabeth (who is living in modern day England)and tries not to fall in love with him herself.  The characters are well developed and all the twists and turns make for a great story.  If you are a \\"Pride & Prejudice\\" fan you will love it, but it is also fun for those who don't have all the dialogue between Elizabeth and Darcy memorized.  It is pure delight and the extra footage on the making of the show is a great plus.  I recommend it most highly.  Perfect for the Jane Austen fan!!!!

B000F8O35U|5.0|There is no question that in 1989, Disney's animated film, THE LITTLE MERMAID ushered in a new golden era for both Disney and animation.  Widely recognized at the time as one of the best Disney films in decades, THE LITTLE MERMAID brought the beauty and joy of Disney animation to a new generation of audiences.  THE LITTLE MERMAID went on to become one of the most honored animated films of all time, garnering two Academy Awards, on for Best Music, Original Score and the other forBest Music, Original Song, \\"Under The Sea.\\"<br /><br />The artistic beauty of THE LITTLE MERMAID shines through in every frame.  Artist James Coleman created exquisitely detailed backdrops for this film.  The songs of Alan Menken and Howard Ashman are classics in their own right:  memorable, toe-tapping, and fun...some of the very best in the Disney repertoire.  The characters themselves are unforgettable.  Ariel, Sebastian, Flounder, Ursula have all ascended to the pantheon of Disney greats.<br /><br />And of course, none of this describes how my 4 year old daughter feels about Ariel and THE LITTLE MERMAID.  Ariel's story of the THE LITTLE MERMAID who wanted feet, and her beauty, innocence, and fascination with the human world instantly propelled her into the ranks of the classic Disney princesses - Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, and Snow White.  She is beloved by millions of little girls across generations, and my little one is no exception.  She is a strong female character who proves she can take care of herself, along with a little help from her friends.  I really like Ariel as a role model.<br /><br />This platinum addition DVD is a must have for any Disney, princess, or animation fans...or for the little princess in all of us.  My wee one and I love curling up on the sofa together to watch THE LITTLE MERMAID.  We become captivated by the story each time, and we love to sing-a-long.  It is a wonderful time together.  What else could anyone ask for?
B001PU8N0I|5.0|We absolutely love this movie. The cinematography is phenomenal, the story will draw you in, and the characters are all brilliantly portrayed.  One we'll watch over and over (in between all of my friends borrowing it).
B000WMEAKC|4.0|Oddly it is an album I would drive to or go to sleep to. A bit contrary I guess but there you have it.
B0026OE2O8|5.0|This is a great documentary film! The images and shots were movingly stunning, the colors were amazingly rich and fluid.  THe narrative highlighted the problems that we've created with literature-worthy eloquence and with objectivity whilst not forgetting humanity's needs. The mostadmirable part of it was that while it instills a sense of pain and regret for the environment, it focuses on what we still have and what we can still save. But behind every good narrative, there is a good soundtrack and the one for this documentary lives up to its narrative, with music from all corners of the globe, each fitting into its place and each a place where it fits.    One extremely noteworthy aspect of narrative,picture and soundtrack mixing well is that the soundtrack doesn't drown out the narrative, as some documentaries are wont to do. Also, the documentary allows for moments of wordless eloquence to captivate the viewer in sound and image - yet without dragging it to being \\"verbose\\".    all in all, the five stars awarded are truly deserved.  one for picture, one for mastery of language in narration, one for soundtrack, one for humanity the last one, for message and overall delivery.
B000VBJEEG|4.0|Bought May 5 arrived May 23 (within time frame but fairly slow).  DVD looks good and plays smoothly, very pleased overall.
B00127RAJY|5.0|i probably do this video the most out of her collection. you can get a full warm up, workout, and cool down in 30 minutes, which is awesome when you're pressed for time. but you still feel like you've made the most of it.
1582701709|5.0|A book that has changed the lives of those who have not ever heard about how to manifest what they desire.    Its a great 'first' book if you have not read anything like this before.  But it was all done long ago by the master:  Get this book if you want something with more depth - Not that the Secret is not good - it got you here - but this book will deliver what you want-    [[ASIN:1441488383 The Master Key System: The Personal Study Edition]]
1582701709|2.0|Perhaps The Secret could be of help to readers that need a shift from negative to positive thinking. However,many of the naive, inane and largerly unsupported statements that are chaotically scattered around in this so called book, are very quick to thwart the trust, interest and patience of a more serious reader...
9562911640|5.0|Funny, I bought this long ago and did not read it - shame on me.  I then went to a course and bought a copy that was part of the system they were selling (it was fantastic and very good to use) and using this new book reminded me I had this old one.  I'm going to donate the old one to a friend.    They are all great!    This is the one from the course if you are wondering:    [[ASIN:1441488383 The Master Key System: The Personal Study Edition]]

B0018CWEYY|5.0|Lost is a great show and the 4th season, though not the strongest was still very good even with the strike shortened season.
0743579259|3.0|Tough story to listen to.  With the hardcopy, you can go back a few pages to pick up one of his many character threads that you may have dropped.     An interesting story but not up to his usual mind bending suspense and matter of fact endings.  Cold war spies and spying are lot more interesting.  But if you are into tweaking the Muslim world, you will like this.
B001RTP48G|4.0|1.) Back in 1990, I bought a Pet Shop Boys CD and a Peter Tchaikovsky CD simultaneously at a record store.  The cashier said, \\"Whoa!  I never thought I'd see someone buy music from such totally different artists at once!\\"  I didn't say it, but I was thinking, \\"You obviously don't know that they share the same sexual orientation.\\"    2.) Neil Tennant of the Pet Shop Boys once said, \\"What are you going to remember more: 'Smalltown Boy' or 'Tainted Love'?\\"  Bronski Beat's \\"Smalltown Boy\\" was not the phenomenal success in the US that it was in mid-1980s Britain.  However, Tennant's point was that pop songs with homoerotic undertones, like Soft Cell's \\"Tainted Love,\\" go over better than blantant pro-gay anthems.  It's implied that the Pet Shop Boys would always take the second path, rather than the first.    I bring these two anecdotes up to bring up the standout feature of \\"Yes\\": on the second song of the CD, \\"All over the World,\\" the Boys sample Tchaikovsky's \\"Danse des Merlitants.\\"  Americans in my age group would recognize this as the Smurfberry Crunch cereal song.  I highly doubt the Boys sampled this ditty coincidentally: I think they were trying to pay homage to a gay musical elder.    In the mid-1990s, Out magazine had an article on the Boys titled, \\"They Are Out ACTUALLY, just not VERY\\" [my emphasis], in reference to the Boys' previous album titles.  Please note though: the Pet Shop Boys have often dabbled in gay subtlety.  In the video for \\"DJ Culture,\\" Tennant dressed up like Oscar Wilde.  In their Performance tour, two same-sex couples of both genders kissed each other.  Even notice how the title \\"Yes\\" is similar to the title \\"Yes I Am\\" by out musician Melissa Etheridge.    Neil and Chris can blow whistles, throw they fists up, and fight da power when they choose to.
1594201927|5.0|This was my first book by Ferguson and despite my reluctance to read multiple books by the same author I will probably read more by this insightful author. The book is so much more than about money; I don't think the title does it justice. He looks at how economics, history, politics and human psychology interact to shape the world that we live in. His writing is clear, entertaining and easy to read.    \\"Ascent of Money\\" touches on various financial products that have played a large role in wealth creation. He addresses the history of banks, bonds, equities, insurance and real estate. But what makes his book so outstanding is that he does not look at these financial instruments in a vacuum. He examines the role politics and history play in making these instruments evolve over time.  If you like Fareed Zakaria, you will most likely enjoy this book as well. Highly recommended.
B001F290E4|5.0|This is by far the best Seal has recorded! Outstanding vocals! Great choice of material. If you were on the fence about Seal this one will set you in orbit!
B002BFBAWO|5.0|I didn't laugh as hard as I did when seeing Superbad, but the plot, 80's dialog, and reminiscing on summer jobs made it more than worth while. I felt as if I was watching an 80's comedy that just happened to be released in 2009. Great film!
B0013FSL0C|3.0|The serie its very good the only thing is that disc 5 is damaged, for me as I live in Belgium is very expensive to send it back sooooo would like to have the right disc.
B0008237BO|5.0|The music itself doesn't really need much commentary, as its an ABSOLUTE timeless masterpiece and one of the greatest rap albums of all time. Pac in his prime, classic album from start to finish. Nothing else need be said.<br /><br />I recently bought this on vinyl, and I have to say, this remastered pressing sounds MUCH better than the original 1996 pressing. Pac's vocals are much clearer and the highs and mids sonically hit harder, so this classic album sounds better than ever. I wish I could say the same for All Eyez On Me, but the original pressing of that one sounds much better than the remaster. Makaveli sounds great on cd too, but if you have any reservations about buying this on vinyl because it's &#34;digitally remastered&#34;, don't. The album sounds fantastic, you won't regret it.could still make dark and grimey records. Me And My Girlfriend for example features a dark and heavy bassline with a spanish guitar. This track overall is just bananas, Pac kills it lyrically and the beat is just one of the best ever made. Then you have more laid back tracks like Krazy, which has a nice piano loop and electric violin to compliment Pacs more reflective lyrics here. Pac was also proving his strength as a producer on this album, he produced most of Bomb First, and parts of Me and My Girlfriend and Hold Ya Head, the latter of which features a spectacular piano loop. And of course, the most famous song on the album, Hail Mary, features one of the darkest and most intoxicating hypnotic beats ever made. The only weakness on this album perhaps was Toss It Up, which is misplaced here I think. But this is hardly enough to bring down the overall greatness of this record.    Bottomline: A classic album that exceeded even All Eyez on Me and is on par with Me Against the World to arguably be Pac's best album. This is a must have in any hip hop fans collection. Pac in his prime, over some of the illest beats ever, what more can you ask for? They dont make records like this anymore. It is more then worth its 5 star average. Its right up there with the other hip hop classics Illmatic, 36 Chambers, It Takes A Nation, Chronic, Paid in Full, etc etc....Pac recorded a masterpiece with this one, buy it now. All in all, Pac's second best album, just BARELY behind Me Against the World.
0762434279|1.0|The book is a miniature edition of the original and feel that it should have been mentioned in the description when I purchased it. Amazon has edited the description since. Sure, I could have looked at the dimentions of the book and that would have told me it was a very small book. I don't feel that I needed to look into the description once I found it because I trust Amazon, but now I will be looking into everything before I purchase it. On the other hand, I was able to easily return it and get a refund.
B0000029GA|5.0|What more can I say that the other 500+ reviews or so havent already?    This album isnt just a classic, but a masterpiece. Rakim took lyricism to a new level with Paid in Full, and Nas did it again with Illmatic, though in a different way. Ra did it with pure technique. He was writing very complex rhyme schemes that just made perfect sense and his flow was second to none at the time. Nas's technique was equally dope, but he took it a step further with his story-telling abilities. Upon first listen, this might just sound like another typical NY street album, but unlike other similiar albums of the time (Enta Da Stage, Ready to Die, Infamous, etc), Nas paints a picture of urban despair that points in the direction of uprising over his harsh environment rather then glorifying it.    The production of course is outstanding too, with LES, Pete Rock, Premo, and other top producers of the time delivering the goods. \\"NY State of Mind\\" is one of Premos most famous and grimiest beats ever, the beat alone gives you the feeling of a nightmarish environment with a wicked piano loop to accompany it. Memory Lane is more upbeat and pays homage to his roots and upbringing. But the standout cut for me is \\"Life's A Bitch\\" featuring AZ. A's verse was so dope people couldnt wait to hear a full album from this guy, and the beat is just unbelievable...very slow and heavy, with a beautiful trumpet done by Nas's father that makes it seem like you are standing right there with Nas atop the projects in QB, just looking at the NY skyline. I can go on and on about how sick this album is, but there is no need really. This is, simply put, one of the all time great hip hop records. Even if you are only a casual rap listener, this one is essential for the collection.
0393330435|1.0|One of the worst books I have ever read. Very poorly written. This book is nothing but a forum for Wozniak to toot his own horn and let us all know how much smarter he is than everyone else. Steve wozniak is full of two things. A) BS B) Himself.
B001GKJ2DY|2.0|I watched this movie and gave it away.  There is no way I could sit through it more than once.  The music was the only good thing and since  I have the ABBA album there was no reason to hang on to the movie.  Talk about wrong casting.  Pierce Brosnon was not the best choice for  this roll.
B001K3JF7K|2.0|Absolutely fabulous, lush string arrangements. Claus Ogerman gets that   Villa Lobos feeling - but that's it. Unfortunately, there are no sparks   or energy from Diana.     I thought this CD was going to be an evolution of that Dancing in   the Dark, I've got you under my Skin and The Look of Love sound of   past CDs. Alas,it wasn't.............  Strictly for die hard fans.
0307450570|3.0|If you're a Martha fan, you've already seen a lot of this in her \\"Living\\" magazine series.  It is nice to have all of these combined in a single volume.    one note:  i see a few rip-off ideas, and i don't think a name of this calibur should result to this.  i expected totally new ideas and for the most part they are revisited older concepts.
B001PPLJIQ|5.0|To some this film will be a love story, for others it may be about horrific discovery about WWII crimes.  To me personally, this is a film about one independent woman's tough choices she had to make for herself in order to survive.  With no family, no education and ability to read, it almost seems that her life puts her in a way of making choices that always end up hurting her.<br /><br />Hanna is single, orderly, hard working.  She is lonely and her incidental meeting with teenage boy Michael turns into a love affair that spans over summer months.  They spend time making love and Michael reading novels to her until one day Hanna disappaers.  Years later, as Michael is a law student at the local university, she learns that Hanna is on trial for the war crimes. By the end of the trial and her sentencing, Michael's and Hanna's life will be irrevocably changed forever.<br /><br />Beautiful film, wonderful scenes and tenderness that has not been captured on a film screen in a long time.
B000NY17J6|5.0|Linda Ronstadt's Greatest Hits, Vol. 1 & 2, holds a lot of memories for those of us who became fans of Linda's back in the 70s. Those songs that made her a star in her early years are present on these CDs and her voice is just as clear and true as we remember. I purchased the CD to listen to while I am busy with housework but I also copied the songs to my Ipod so I can listen to them anytime. I am glad that I found this available on Amazon.
B001NFNFNU|5.0|Clint Eastwood has given us some amazing movies in recent years and has shown how well he is able to direct and tell a story.  The Changling is added to the list.    In the movie Angelina Jolie (in a part that shows her skills as an actress more than some other vehicles) plays a mother whose child goes missing and then becomes ensnared in corruption as the police \\"find\\" the son and she is drawn into the dark side of law enforcement that existed at the time.    Eventually she finds herself being accused of being unfit and finds herself in psychological nightmare.  A dark, gripping movie that deserves all the accolades and which is all the more chilling since it was real.    Excellent.
1439157383|1.0|MASSIVE SPOILER ALERT!  DO NOT READ THIS REVIEW IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO BE ENTIRELY SPOILED!<br /><br />With the movie about to come out, I thought I should review this book to warn people about it.  DON'T BOTHER!<br /><br />I actually really enjoyed the book (even with the rather clunky writing and unsubtle characterizations), and then the ending comes and I start screaming \\"What? You've gotta be kidding me!\\" It betrayed the entire premise of the book. It betrayed the characters. It certainly betrayed the reader. I will never read another book by this purveyor of pulp, and I refuse to go see the movie unless I am assured beforehand that they have re-written the ending so it makes sense with the rest of the story.<br /><br />Specifically, and these are spoilers: what I got from the book was that the mother was so determined to save her older daughter, Kate, that she had totally lost her moorings. Kate was suffering unbearably, and so were her other children and her husband. So Anna, the younger daughter, takes a stand on Kate's behalf, and says stop, Kate should decide when enough is enough and this is it. Kate has decided she has fought through ten years of misery just to take another breath, but that's not enough. She wants a quality of life that she just can't have. So she is going to step back, let her sister and her family live their lives, and accept her own lot in life. I thought that was a very moving and interesting perspective.<br /><br />Then, the end of this stupid book happens. Anna and Kate win their court case. They get to make their own medical decisions. Except they don't. \\"Fate\\" intervenes. Anna is killed in a stupid, cheap car crash. And suddenly her kidney, which was the point of the whole book, is basically up for grabs. So Kate just takes it. Even though the whole point of her character throughout the book was that she was done with medical procedures, suddenly the fact that her sister is a dead donor, instead of a perfectly willing live donor, makes her change her whole philosophy. And she takes the kidney. And she lives. So, it turns out that the mother was right all along. The girls were just \\"acting out,\\" I guess. If they had just accepted one more medical procedure, everything would have been rosy.  The whole premise of the book as I understood it -- that sometimes adolescents can see things adults can't, and can earn the right to determine their own destiny -- was just total b.s. Mommy always knows best. Oh, I cannot begin to express how I hated this conclusion. It made me feel like the entire book was an ugly practical joke.
0307341569|4.0|\\"Dark Places\\" by Gillian Flynn is a secret yearning to be told. This is the story of Libby Day, whose mother and two sisters were brutally murdered when she was seven years old, and her only brother convicted of the crime. Her testimony put him away. Twenty five years later, broke and desperate, she attends a convention of the Kill Club, a weird assortment of people interested in infamous murder cases. Since they are willing to pay her to find the people that may know something more, but aren't telling, she goes along with it. Finding answers to questions, she had no interest in; she slowly begins to think maybe her brother is innocent. Flynn alternates between Libby's present and that fateful night (seen through the eyes of various characters). We get to understand what happened as the truth slowly unravels. I couldn't put the book down, as each new chapter brought Libby closer to the truth. The ending was a little too fitting but still enjoyable, nevertheless.
038073186X|5.0|This was my first Lehane novel.  I was at first annoyed by the vagueness of the opening, but soon found the author had a plan for me as a reader.  I won't spoil the ending, but... this is a book you may want to read again.  Excellent summer read!
B000E1JOSE|5.0|Seven superstars paying tribute to a legend - usually these affairs are more reminiscent of a punch-drunk heavyweight rope-a-doping for one last payday as he gamely sings into a dead microphone while his more famous mates gently prop up their mentor. Well, on Black and White Night Roy Orbison had a different idea - taking everyone to school and making it our privilege to sit in on the lesson.<br /><br />With his multiple octave range on full display and his all-star band in robust support mode, Orbison tears and growls though his complete canon with a force and passion that is as unexpected as it is transformative and essential. Orbison is one cool cat and the only human being that should ever be allowed to wear sunglasses at night. Breathtaking.
B001SGEUNI|5.0|heard it on a late night radio station when driving cross country. Had to buy it as soon as i made a stop it was so good. great lyrics and vocals.
B001P9KR8U|2.0|Well, I resisted seeing this movie but finally I caved in, and I had no idea of just how bad it is.  After about 20 minutes I turned to the other patrons of the theater and cried out like Augustus O'Reilly in A CONFEDERACY OF DUNCES, \\"Can no one deliver me from such pap?!<br /><br />I had the chance to see this on a double bill with Liam Neeson in TAKEN, and it so happens that they are exactly the same movie, presented in exactly the same way.  Both films depend on the continually postponed deflowering of an underage girl, and the plot of each revolved around the efforts of the hero to prevent this from happening.  So both stories becomes one man against the underworld of the gang, gangs grown rich by preying on the need of sinister, jaded men for the flesh of the young girl.  Life is a crusade against sexual sin led by Dev Patel on the one hand, Liam Neeson on the other.  This crusade allows and encourages violence of all sorts, in the name of protecting the girl.  I expect this feeds into real life violence perpetuating purity.  I enjoyed TAKEN though, while SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE is unredeemable and condescending filmmaking which even AR Rahman's energetic score can't pretty up.
B0013LKZWS|3.0|I bought it for the single \\"love song\\" and found 2 others to my liking but moth of the rest of the CD was not to my liking. I think I  was looking for more of the up tempo pop of the single. Good voice though.
B000092ZYX|3.0|This album is actually a 2 star when stood up to Radiohead's standards and potential. This album has listenable enough tracks, however memorable hooks or beautiful ambient passages are RARE. There are maybe, 3 or 4 tracks that i put on regularily, but this is not an ok computer, the bends or in rainbows in the sense that it cannot be fully enjoyed as a listen all the way through. Very weak for Radiohead.<br /><br />The tracks that have some substance:<br /><br />1. 2+2=5 - This is actually over rated. No where near some of radiohead's other great work and can even get annoying at times. However, at other times it's very catchy and has a variety of different sounds.<br /><br />4 - Backdrifts - I enjoy the electronic feel here, kinda creepy feeling in a way, But also simply a very catchy verse.<br /><br />5 - Go to Sleep - Fantastic acoustic guitar work here. A much different feel from the rest of the tracks. Catchy chorus<br /><br />9 - There There - THe feel of this track is similar to that of \\"I Might be Wrong\\" from amnesiac. A great rock song with some interesting lyrics.<br /><br />13 - Scatterbrain - One of the catchiest Verse/Chorus structures of the album. Thom shows off his ability to sound melancholic as well as on any other album with this track.<br /><br />Point is... if your not a big radiohead fan, this is not the place to start. I would recommend skipping it as it can be very hit and miss. It is mediocre, and i cannot be blamed for not trying hard enough to delve fully into this album. I listened very carefully and found very little. If you love radiohead then you probably already have it and enjoy some of the tracks like me. Enjoy! (or try)
1400079179|5.0|This book is excellent. It usually takes me a while to finish a book but I have almost finish it in just a couple of weeks. I saw the movie before reading the book so I had a heads up on the plot and certain events in the book but it still kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time.
B001TH16DS|5.0|Finally, the season one realease you can buy and not wonder if a better one will be realeased later. The video quality is amazing. Quality wise it could have been shot yesterday. Sound quality is sufficiant and holds up well. Surrounds kick in during effects as they should. There are plenty of extras. A \\"life after trek\\" segment on Shatner is tough to get through but otherwise the extras are very worthwhile. I would love to see them release the bloopers we all have on vhs. The Cage is also not included (can't have it all I guess). As far as price, it's worth it even if you have never seen the show before. All that history making material for $70 you can't beat that. Can't wait for the other two.
B001TWT0A4|5.0|I want to be clear as Amazon.com is mixing reviews for all of the editions of the movie of EL DORADO on DVD. This review is for the latest (2009) 2 DVD set Centennial Collection. Being an owner of the previous releases and a huge fan of the movie (probably in the minority who favor it to Rio Bravo)as far as the movie goes it looks stunning! The picture is crisp, the contrast brilliant and the color well saturated. If I didn't  know better I'd think it was a VistaVision.  The Second disc has some very entertaining and educational featurettes which kept me amused for over an hour themselves. James Caan is great  in the film, Mitchum  is ....Mitchum ..which is superb and Ed Asner brings a gravitas to his character.  Oh...John Wayne is terrific and this is just a lot of fun.<br /><br />UPDATE 3/8/14 The BLU RAY is even better, goodness this film is breath taking in BR and I have to admit I've just watched it back to back.  I picked up the \\"import\\" version without the extras but have the domestic one on order, I hear scuttle butt the import may have a slightly better picture in that the domestic may be a tad over processed for the super picky, I'll update after an AB test. Every frame of this film is so beautiful it could be printed and hung on a wall, and the fact that so much is shot at night enables the cinematographer (Rosson) to do beautiful work and make it look like each scene is lit with found lighting, not your TV lighting at all!  For me I prefer this to Rio Bravo as I believe Mitchum clearly outclasses Dean Martin and James Caan is far superior to Ricky Nelson ...they've kept the major bonus feature from the 2 DVD set so unlike many re releases on BR we get all the goodies.. a great movie in my collection just moved from Gold to Diamond for me!!
0143038419|1.0|I agree with the reviews that express disappointment with Ms Gilbert's Eat, Pray, Love Memoirs. I wanted to like it, especially after hearing the book will be a Film in no time starring one of my least favorite actresses Julia Roberts.   But instead I found myself thinking the author was nothing more than a vain, whiney, troubled and empty blogger/journal writer. Her lack of spirituality at the end showed me she is one of the many who think becoming spiritual is something that happens to you after a short trip to India. What frightens me more than this book are the millions of people who look up to her and feel her story is worth repeating.   I don't believe Ms Gilbert knows what true suffering is. Nor is she somebody who's advice I would take for anything other than where to eat in Italy.
B001TWT0AE|5.0|The Man who Shot Liberty Valance  is  always at the top of any list of the great westerns  of all  time and rightfully so. The story is for once truly unique and unique to the west, the sub plots are a plenty and the acting , casting (Lee Marvin is also brilliant) and cinematography (beautiful black and  white) all combine for a one of a kind experience!     That  said...THIS review is for the NEW 2009 Centennial Collection 2 DVD  set. First let me say AMAZON.COM  has it WRONG in their tech notes it IS widescreen but NOT  2:35 aspect  ratio  but much closer to 1:85 so if you think you've found  the holy grail sorry, its the same ratio as before and the correct one as shot...oh and this PRINT is by far the best offered and for that reason alone this would be the version  to buy. The second disc has a first  rate batch of featurettes which really ad to the viewing  pleasure and ones  knowledge of film and this one  in particular.     Bottom line,  its a handsome package for a modest price. A fan  of  the film  would be smart to make THIS version the one  for their  personal library. If you are curious and a fan of westerns  or John Wayne or Jimmy Stewart and old  enough to enjoy a well told story that  doesn't involve gunplay every 5 minutes...give  it a try. You may find  that its a film  you come  back  to year after year. Its  told that this movie didn't really do much in its day and was dismissed by many in  fact some of who in the critical world years later admitted that they missed it and its one of the all time classics!  To my mind something in art,music or movies that gets better with time and more  viewings is a  definition of a classic!    what are ya waitin  for pilgrim?!
B002BNKQDK|5.0|This movie is a masterpiece in my opinion. And so is the collectible case for this edition of the DVD. The movie was a classy production from top to bottom and the Nite Owl ship version of the DVD looks fantastic!    I can't really review the DVD yet as it isn't out yet. But the Director's Cut is about 30 minutes longer than what was shown in theaters and I'm dying to see it.    My own view as to why it didn't clean up at the box office is because the movie is ahead of its time. When the graphic novel came out in the 1980s, comic readers were tired of the same old same old in comics. WATCHMEN came along and blew up the traditional superhero stereotypes.    A lot was said in interviews by the creators of the film that MOVIE audiences were tired of \\"typical\\" superhero movies (just as those comic readers were back in the 80s) and the timing was right for WATCHMEN to blow people's minds.    Well, it did and it didn't. For those who \\"got\\" the movie, mission accomplished. For most fans of the novel, mission accomplished. But for the \\"masses\\", it didn't quite work. I've read a lot of complaints about the film and there is a common thread running through them. Folks who didn't like the movie complain that it was not what they expected. In other words, it was not a typical superhero movie.    From this, I think it's safe to say that movie goers WEREN'T ready for a different kind of superhero movie.    Yet.    When Blade Runner came out it was a dismal failure. Many of the same complaints being made now about WATCHMEN were made about Blade Runner: it's too long, it's too slow, there's no action... Now Blade Runner is generally considered (not by everyone, I know) one of the best science-fiction movies ever made. It has become a classic. It was ahead of its time and audiences eventually caught up.    I think the same will be said of WATCHMEN. Hollywood is cranking out superhero movies faster than we can watch them. Movie goers are loving the CGI and action sequences. We're eating it up! But the time is coming when you'll see a trailer for one of these and groan: \\"My God, not ANOTHER superhero movie.\\"    And that's when it'll be time to check out WATCHMEN again. You might just see the movie a little differently then.    I'm convinced that WATCHMEN, like Blade Runner, will become a classic. I loved the movie. Saw it 5 times in the theater and will probably wear out the DVD. Zack Snyder stayed true to the source material, he didn't dumb it down. And the movie looks stunning! In my mind it is already a classic.    Let's see what time does to the general regard for the film.
B00278U1W0|5.0|Let me say that most reviewers are correct that the playing seen on this disc is what you would expect from such influential men. What I would like to comment upon is the visuals and sound from this Blu-ray disc is clean and nuanced. You can hear Steve Winwood play the keys and his fellow bandmember quite discretely play from his side. Clapton's playing is superb and I believe this disc is the first Blu-ray concert that is available to show off his playing with the new improved sound format. For those who have not embarked upon this new format, and if sound and video matter, then you need to get aboard. This format sounds as good if not smoother than the now defunct SACD and DVD-Audio high rez CD's.
159102594X|5.0|I can't believe the (few) negative reviews about this book! This is such a great book. I felt like I was reading a classic epic-style story like Gargantua and Pantagruel, but with a modern perspective. EXCELLENT character development. I've only read the first book and I can't wait to read the next two (they are being shipped next-day air as I type....) I picked this up the day after I finished Brandon Sanderson's Mistborn. What an excruciating experience that was-- a guy who couldn't write witty dialogue if somebody held a knife to his neck.<br /><br />Anyhow, Abercrombie writes believable and hilarious dialogue. I found myself laughing out loud several times. I haven't laughed out loud that many times reading a book since Lucky Jim (yes, as funny as the stone-kicking scene, even).<br /><br />Yes, the author uses the \\"f-word\\"-- if you don't like it, go read a young adult book. How can people who have a hard time dealing with the \\"f-word\\" deal with adult issues like child-abuse, torture, & violence, all themes that pop up in the book. In fact, if you want infantile, harmless, uninteresting, inoffensive (at least scatalogically speaking, if not intellectually) dialogue, go read Mistborn. Yetch.<br /><br />I'd have to say this book is way more character driven than quest-driven. The voices of the different characters actually sound like different people, not just different people speaking with the same voice. I like the fact that they are nuanced-- nobody seems just good or bad, perfect or noble or evil, or one-dimensional in any way. I don't really care where the characters are heading in book 2, but I'm pretty sure it will be interesting and humorous and I definitely want to be along for the ride. If you have a sense of humor (more in the Monty Python style than American sit-com style) I think you will love this book.
B001TOD92C|5.0|Awesome, spectacular movie!! Mickey Rourke was superb.  Very emotional movie for me, I was a die hard wrestling fan in 1980's!!!
1434208516|3.0|Powell has taken Doyle's The Hound of the Baskervilles and condensed it into a graphic novel format.  This is a new trend I've noticed with some publishers.  Besides this being a great story, it also makes a potentially daunting text a lot more accessible to readers.  I think that this type of work could easily influence readers into picking up the actual book at some future time.<br /><br />Let me be frank here.  I love everything I've read by Doyle.  I love Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson.  I love graphic novels (I think they're a fantastic cross-over genre - what I mean by that is: kids just growing out of picture books that still want pictures in their books: check.  Do you know someone who will only read comic books?  Give them a graphic novel!  Check!  Not to mention the (*cough*) adults who still like pictures with their books!)  Now that my gushing has been taken care of, on to the story!<br /><br />Many people are familiar with who Sherlock Holmes is.  Heck, some people even think he was a real person!  Let me be clear on this: Sherlock Holmes is a figment of the imagination of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.  Now that I have potentially broken some hearts, I am deeply sorry, but you really need to know the truth!  However, that does not lessen the appeal he has on people!<br /><br />Okay, really, I'm getting there!  Basically the premise is that the Baskerville family is haunted by this glowing-eyed hound that kills people.  Sir Charles Baskerville has just been viciously murdered by said hound, and Sherlock and Dr. Watson are in to solve the case before it kills the new owner of Baskerville Hall.  One of the things that I love about Sherlock is that he is presented with some really strange situations, yet he tends to be able to see through the fog and get to the heart of the matter.  Once you hear (read) what Sherlock has to say you almost want to pull a Homer Simpson and slap your forehead while yelling D'oh!<br /><br />I really love the illustrations in this book.  They're appropriately dark and dreary and perfect!<br /><br />If you're familiar with this particular story, you may be disappointed that quite a bit is left out, but that really isn't going to detract the target audience of this book.  Despite the shortness, it really covers the basic principles of the story.<br /><br />Notes on the Cover:<br />Vicious Hound?  Check.  Sherlock and Dr. Watson? Check!  Two thumbs up!nd dreary and perfect!

B0000045C7|4.0|This performance has always gotten a bad rap, in practically every review I have read of it.     Marta Modl's Klytemnestra has to be heard to be believed. It is a great DECLAIMED rather than sung performance. Even more impressive that she gave excellent performances as Brunhilde and Isolde after the time of this recording (1950)  displaying her profound musical gifts.     This woman is simply a demented, tortured character. Unlike any Klytemnestra I have ever heard.     This recording pops up here and there from time to time. It will come around again.
B001M5UDGS|4.0|This was put together during the Hollywood Writer's strike, and it shows -- the production values aren't top-notch, but who cares?  Josh Whedon struck gold with this one.   No other regular Hollywood writer could ever think up anything so irreverently, outrageously funny.  Great stuff here.      Except for Neil Patrick Harris, the cast was mostly unknowns who have, since the release online of the show, have made it into the \\"big leagues\\".  Harris plays \\"Dr. Horrible\\", an evil scientist-wannabe who is trying to earn his way into the Evil League of Evil through dastardly deeds.  He is continually thwarted, however, by his nemesis, Captain Hammer (Nathan Fillion).  He's also madly in love with Penny (Felicia Day), a naive do-gooder on a crusade to help the homeless, who is oblivious to what is really going on around her.  Hilarity ensues!    Perhaps not for everyone, but well worth a look.  Far more creative than the usual dreck from Hollywood.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|This is a great movie.  I highly recommend it to everyone of all ages.  It is just amazing what Pixar can do with so little dialogue
1416914307|5.0|After reading this last book in the Mortal Instruments trilogy (which nearly took me a day), I was happy to say that I slept with a smile on my face that night.    Although the book dragged on a bit too much throughout the middle, the ending was phemomenal. I'm proud to call myself an avid Jace/Clary shipper, and was more than relieved that they finally got together at the end of the book.    This series is such a great combination of action, humor, romance, mystery, and just other added bonuses that nerdies (like myself!) enjoy thoroughly. This book was one of the series that helped me move on from the overly-popular Twilight series (thank God), and I do feel sad thinking that it has ended.    Although some of the parts were way too long, and Sebastian was creepy and just popped out of no where, I still love the book, and thought that it was a satisfying ending to a satisfying series.    Of course, not all endings to book series can be easily written. Ending a well-written trilogy was sure to be difficult and challenging. Cassandra Clare did an amazing job tying up the story, making sure that no loose ends were left untouched.    Still, one thing bugged me. Was Simon still in love with Clary at the end? I couldn't tell, and wished that the author cleared that up so that it wouldn't seem as though Simon was still helplessly trailing after Clary while she finally got with Jace.    But overall, I loved the series. Love the characters. Love the couples (Alec and Magnus are my faves!). And I would definitely recommend this book series to anyone.
B0009XNUK0|5.0|I guess anyone who is MJ's fan would love his songs, so I am not going to waste my time commenting on his music. Instead, I will talk about the disc/sound quality...     What impresses me is the sound quality... I bought some of his songs online previously, but becos the online versions are usually downloaded at only 128kbps, they don't sound as sharp when I play the downloaded songs in my cars. So I was amazingly impressed when I play this disc in my car; soooo sharp. Songs like Billy Jean, Jam, Dangerous, man! The bass pounds your heart... I know, my wife says I am a freak when it comes to sound, very often, I would rather not listen to a song if I think the recording is poor... which means, I have spend a lot of $ buying original disc... 8P
B001O8C5KK|3.0|Listen to Victoria de los Angeles in her two recordings of Butterfly for EMI. It is the most perfect, beautifull sing and deep characterization of tis role of any soprano ever. And listen to Carlo Bergonzi or Jussi Bjorling and u will understand why the 50's were a gold age of singing.
1423113497|5.0|When I was in school I hated mythology, who new my 4th grade son would find it so exciting!?! He's just read the last one in the series so I'm wondering if the Roman gods are going to be next. It's so hard to find good books for smart kids and this series fit the bill perfectly.
B0002SROT0|3.0|I first heard Elliott Smith's music in 1995, shortly after I moved to the U.S. My local radio station would play \\"Clementine\\" quite a bit, and it wasn't long before I fell in love with his self-titled album and quickly decided to track down a copy of his first album, \\"Roman Candle\\", which is still my favorite album of his and one of my favorite albums of all time.  His next two albums, \\"Either/Or\\" and \\"XO\\", are both excellent, and \\"Figure 8\\" is very good.  After four excellent albums, I was very disappointed in his posthumous release \\"From a Basement on the Hill\\".    For the most part, the songs on his final album are considerably darker than his previous efforts, but they also lack the depth of his earlier work.  The musicianship is subpar, and the songwriting leaves a lot to be desired.  The three best songs on the album are \\"Pretty (Ugly Before)\\", \\"A Fond Farewell\\", and the beautifully produced \\"Twilight\\".  These songs sound much more like the Elliott I came to love 14 years ago - quality songwriting and well-written arrangements.      Overall, the album is worth at least a couple of listens, but I think it's well below the level of his other five albums and \\"New Moon\\", the recent collection of Elliott's unreleased material.
B000ETRCMQ|5.0|\\"Transamerica\\" is the story about Bree, formerly Stanley, who is a pre-operative male-to-female transexual, who discovers she had a son that she(he) fathered 17 years before in New York City. She goes to New York, tracks the son down, and travels cross-country with him back to California where she awaits her surgery date. The film is one of the best buddy films in the genre, as both Bree and Toby (the son) encounter many characters along the way. The most heartfealt scenes are the ones in which Bree visits with her family, and the confrontations she has with her mother who doesn't approve of what \\"Stanley\\" has done with his life.<br /> Felicity Huffman should have won the Oscar that year as she gave one of the best performances ever by an actress in the cinema. When you watch \\"Transamerica\\" you forget all about Felicity's role in TV's \\"Desperate Housewives\\". Everything from Huffman's voice to her mannerisms are impeccable, and you think you are actually watching a man transforming into a woman on the screen. Kevin Zeegers is also great as the son who is a prostitute and ends up working in the porn industry on his jont to California.<br /> The film was nominated for two Academy Awards, including one for Huffman for Best Actress, and the other for Dolly Parton (who wrote the title theme) for Best original Song for \\"Travellin' Thru\\".<br /> The DVD comes with the trailer, Dolly's video for \\"Travellin' Thru\\", behind-the-scenes featurette, commentary by director Duncan Tucker, blooper reel, and interviews with the cast.
B001G0MFOM|1.0|Jenny dies in the final episode but questions such as who killed Jenny and how did Jenny die are never answered.  That's only the beginning of the final season's many letdowns.  The truth is, I hated everything about this season.  With only 8 X 1 hour episodes, there was no time to waste; but this is exactly what happens.  The majority of the storylines from this season come across as tedious, pointless and cumbersome.  Also, I could have done without the 2 added characters, Kelly and Helena's ex-girlfriend Dylan.  Both were annoying and their scenes felt like wasted airtime to me.  There were too many plot holes and the writing came across as clumsy and amatuerish.  IMO, the real killer is Ilene Chaiken.  Ilene killed Jenny and the series.  We later learned the idea behind Jenny's death was so there could be a spin-off, \\"The Farm\\" with Leisha Haily who played Alice from the show.  The premise of the spin-off was that Alice goes to prison for killing Jenny.  Well with no spin-off, what are the fans left with?  A huge mess of what used to to be one of cable TV's greatest guilty pleasures.  The final season was so bad it leaves a bad lasting impression of the series.  It certainly outraged and disappointed many of the show's fans.  Shame on you Ilene.
B0002J4ZWS|5.0|\\"The Shawshank Redemption\\" is one of those films that never ages. Based on the Stephen King nouvella called \\"Rita Hayworth and The Shawshank Redemption\\", the movie is one of the best in the prison film genre. Timothy Robbins plays a man who is sent to Shawshank Prison in Maine for murdering his wife and her lover. We discover that Robbin's character Andy is innocent, and the just of the story is seeing if he does indeed survive his tenure at one of the most horrendous prisons in the country. Through all the torture Andy goes through (he is gang raped on several instances), Andy never gives up hope, especially with his African-American buddy, played superbly by Morgan Freeman. Bob Gunton plays one of the most evil men in cinema history, as he plays the dastardly prison warden, with no heart or integrity.<br /> \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\" was nominated for seven Oscars the year it came out, but won none, mainly due to the fact that \\"Forrest Gump\\" was up against it.<br /> This two disc set has a ton of bonus features including commentary by the director Frank Darabont, interviews with the cast, and an episode from \\"The Charlie Rose Show\\" featuring Timothy Robbins, Morgan Freeman, and Frank Darabont.<br /> The film has grossed over $29,000,000 at the boxoffice.<br /> Roger Ebert says of \\"Shawshank\\" that it \\"absorbs us and takes away the awareness that we're watching a film...\\"
B000ZNRBK4|4.0|The HB-45 lens hood is the replacement lens hood of the HB-33. It is for the Nikkor 18-55mm lens (all types, including VR). This should have come included with the lens itself...a must have for outdoor usage. As much as I would prefer a pedal shaped hood, this one is made for this lens and does not cause vignetting. DO NOT buy a knock off hood! Purchase Nikon equipment!
B001GCUO1Q|4.0|I'm a long-time X-Fangirl, but I'm trying to write this review as a movie viewer, instead of someone who knows exactly where the movie deviated from the comics on a panel by panel basis.  *coughs*    Two brothers, Victor (Sabertooth) and James/Logan (Wolverine), join a government program of mutants called Weapon X and fight in a lot of wars.  Wolverine grows disgusted by his teammates bloody actions and quits, appearing years later as lumberjack with a girlfriend named Kayla Silver Fox (which should win the movie an Oscar right there, I tell you).    Of course, he can't leave his past behind that easily, and soon finds himself the target of his old Weapon X buddies.  So, he teams up with his friend Kestrel/John Wraith and goes in search of Gambit/Remy LeBeau, the only man who ever escaped Weapon X.  From there, more big fight scenes ensue.    The result was a fun popcorn flick.  The action scenes were great, well done and exciting.  Because the movie went for action over characterization, no character was unforgettable.  However, a few were surprisingly interesting.  Deadpool/Wade was funny and deliciously amoral, while Kayla Silver Fox was an unusual heroine, wise and spiritual with an edge of sarcasm.  Unlike, say, the Punisher or Iron Man movies where the time spent on romance made me want to fall asleep, I was interested in Logan/Wolverine's interaction with Kayla.    The plot was predictable, but not groan-inducingly so, and it was bolstered by good acting and effects.  Moments of humor broke up the drama, such as naked Wolverine streaking past an old couple.      Overall, I recommend \\"Wolverine\\" to fans of action who don't demand that all plot lines make sense.    For fellow comic book fans: there's lots of deviation from the comics, but fans of certain characters are advised to go anyway.  Of course, if you're a Wolverine or Sabretooth fan, you're going to be very happy.  But there are a lot of favorites in smaller roles who get good parts too.  Taylor Kitschwas perfect as Gambit, sexy and disarming one minute, dangerous and violent the next.  Blob was great, a dorky dimbulb who gave us the movie's funniest scene: a boxing match with Wolverine.  And, as stated above, Ryan Reynolds became Deadpool.  He played Wade a bit more staid then we're used to in the books, but it fit, and the old love of violence and droll sense of humor were present.    So: action fans will like this one, as will comic fans who aren't purists.  Fun stuff.
B001FB55H6|3.0|Well, I could go with the masses on this one or I could be an individual and state my true feelings on this movie. When I went to see this movie in theaters, all of my friends loved it. I did not. My first issue with the movie was the music. The music in this movie was pointless 80s one hit wonders which while my friends all agreed that it accurately summed up the times which the characters lived in, I thought that they were almost totally inappropriate for all but two scenes the music was used in. Having read the novel, I also did not like how they made the movie scene for panel but decided to totally change and omit certain crucial elements such as the ending, which made the novel an excellent read. While the violence and sex were gratuitous the sex was comical and also awkward unlike in the book where Moore shows how it directly relates to the main characters ability to fight crime. The movie was also too long and started to drag after about an hour. I felt like I was in the movie theater for about 5 hours for a 2 hour and 30 minute movie. Dr. Manhattan was nude throughout the entire movie as well. Again this was another thing which Moore used to make a point in his book but was a pointless item to add into a movie of this sort.    In short, I left that movie theater thinking that Zack Snyder the director should stick to action movies such as 300 as the fighting was awesome although a minor part of the movie and he should never direct a movie meant to be a drama again. I was however able to be convinced by my friends that this was not a terrible movie but a decent movie. You should not see this if you've read the book however as you will inevitably hate this movie.
B001KVZ6FM|5.0|Over the years, PIXAR movies have excelled in sprinkling in moments of deep emotion within all the inventive fun.  I remember particularly well the sadness when Jessie the Cowgirl sings about her long lost owner in TOY STORY 2 or the final moment of MONSTERS INC. when Scully sees Boo again (the one moment makes watching the whole movie worthwhile...not that it wasn't already).  WALL E certainly had many touching moments.    But Pixar's new UP has them all beat.  There are some moments of such profound emotion that I almost hesitate to call this movie a comedy.  The opening ten minutes nearly caused me to lose my composure altogether!  We meet Carl Fredricksen as a young boy in a movie theater (probably during the early days of the depression), enchanted by the true-life adventures of Charles Muntz, a dashing explorer of the newly discovered Paradise Falls in South America...a man who is fearless, flies a dirigible and is a bit of an inventor too.  Carl is a shy boy, particularly when he meets Ellie, a talkative, high-spirited girl who also idolizes Muntz.  The two become fast friends, Carl silent and admiring, Ellie fast-paced and brave.  Through an extremely well-executed montage, we literally see Carl & Ellie go from young friends, to boyfriend/girlfriend to husband & wife.  We see the path their marriage takes (and we see quite clearly how their dream of one day living at Paradise Falls never comes true) right to its end with Ellie's death.  (This is not a spoiler, in my opinion...I told you WHAT happens in the first 10 minutes, but not HOW...which is key.)  This montage has several touching moments, and the ultimate affect was to leave me feeling very sad...a feeling I couldn't shake for a long time, actually.    Carl (brilliantly voiced by Ed Asner) is not a happy widower.  He mostly sits on his porch and watches his once quiet small-town street become part of a sprawling metropolis.  He's the kind of old man that kids always steer clear of.  He carries with him the feeling that he let his beloved Ellie down in life, mostly because he couldn't take them to Paradise Falls.  It's a bitter feeling.    Then one day, when he has nothing left to lose...he inflates thousands of helium balloons, attaches them to his house, and floats his entire home away in the hopes of drifting to South America to finally give his house a home there.  It's such an absurd idea, but is beautifully executed (not a big surprise from the visual geniuses at Pixar) and the image of this old wooden house carried by these brightly colored balloons becomes almost iconic.    Carl has accidently flown away with a young boyscout named Russell cringing in fear on his front porch.  Since Carl can't toss the unwanted kid overboard, he must bring him inside.    That's enough plot.  Carl and Russell have a number of heart-stopping or hilarious adventures...eventually joining forces with a large purple ostrich-like bird named Kevin and best of all, they meet Dug, a simple little dog who has a wonderful collar around his neck that allows his thoughts to be turned into speech.  Pixar & Disney movies have always thrived best when there are some colorful \\"side kicks\\", and Dug is one of my recent favorites.  Carl and his gang even meet old Charles Muntz, who is not necessarily quite like the man Carl used to admire.    UP is one of the best movies I've ever seen about growing and being OLD.  It's not just a movie with an old man as its hero.  It gives us a clear emotional picture of the frailty, the disappointments, the loneliness and the sadness of being an old man.  It also clearly shows that old men can have amazing resources, wisdom and frankly, a lot to offer the world.  Carl had thought his life was nearly over except for waiting around for the actual end.  He discovers this isn't quite true.  For this alone, UP is a movie I dare to call IMPORTANT...because kids are going to see it, and it has the potential  to actually change the way some of its young viewers see their grandparents.    It's also a visual treat.  The floating house tops the list of great images, but Pixar does great things with an old dirigible as well.  And if you can see the movie in 3D, that's a plus.  The 3D isn't essential, and there are no moments in the film when you know the director was simply cow-towing to the desire to give us one of those \\"in your face\\" 3D moments that never quite work anyway.  But the 3D adds loveliness to the experience, and it's worth the extra 3 bucks.    This may be the least purely funny Pixar movie.  I laughed at plenty, don't get me wrong.  It's surely funnier than most films...but it's no TOY STORY or RATATOUILLE.  But it is a classic nonetheless.  It's been a few days since I've seen it, and I would happily go again...even though the opening scene (and a few others later in the film) are sure to wrench some tears.  UP takes you on an emotional journey that is as layered and textured as anything you could expect from a film.  Frankly, I don't know how Pixar keeps doing it.  It is truly a company staffed entirely by miracle workers, apparently.      Simply put, GO SEE UP!  Now!!
B0006B2A42|5.0|About the only thing I had in common with Howard Hughes is that we both loved this movie.  Hughes allegedly watched it 17 times one weekend.  I saw it at its original reserved-seat run at the Cinerama theater on Broadway in New York and have watched it numerous times since then (although not as much as Hughes.)<br />The name Alistair MacLean is not that well-remembered today.  However he was the king of action novelists during the 1950s and '60s.  Many of his books were made into films, the most famous being \\"The Guns of Navarone\\" and its sequel \\"Force 10 from Navarone,\\" \\"Where Eagles Dare,\\" \\"Breakheart Pass\\" and this film.  This film was supposed to re-unite his Navarone stars, Gregory Pack and David Niven.  However when shooting started, they were no longer available.  Instead we got Rock Hudson, Ernest Borgnine and Patrick McGoohan.  Hudson and Borgnine are fine but it is McGoohan who steals the film as a British secret agent named \\"Jones\\" who is very similar to his John Drake \\"Secret Agent\\" TV persona. There are no female members of the cast.<br />The first half of the film involves the U.S. submarine's voyage under the polar ice pack to get to Zebra.  It includes a terrifically suspenseful scene of a saboteur's attempt to flood the submarine while under the pack.  The second half involves the locating of Zebra culminating in the U.S./Russian confrontation at the detroyed station for the secret of Ice Station Zebra.<br />Directed by the great John Sturges, (The Great Escape, Magnificent 7, etc.)  this is an exciting and suspenseful film.  It features a great score by Michel Legrand and fine special effects of the submarine journeying under the polar ice pack (great on the big screen.)It lost the special effects Oscar to 2001.  The DVD features the overture, intermission music and music for exiting the theater.<br />Unfortunately the DVD only includes some vintage short subjects from the time the film was made.  It would have been very nice for a retrospective onthis fine film.  While Hudson and Sturges are long-gone, McGoohan was alive until recently and Borgnine, Jim Brown (who basically stands around looking angry the entire film,) and Tony Bill are still alive.<br />This is a classic cold-war suspense thriller that has stood the test of time, I would love to see its eventual release on Blu-ray.
B001DHXT6G|5.0|A true jewel!!!!    will not repeate what other people have allready say, will only say that it's worth every cent!... I'm very happy that I got the three season pack, I will keep the originals I allready have, but I'm sure glad that I got the Remastered compleate series!!!!!!!!!
B001DHXT6G|5.0|The CG-remastered and cleaned up series is great!  Over the years, I saw the grainy 1960s version many times.  I really like the CG remastering -- it's like seeing them all anew, with clarity and details not seen before. It's fresh.  I'm glad my kid can see the cleaned-up versions, they're more engaging to someone seeing them for the first time.   The digital clean-up process is described in an \\"additional feature\\" included on the first DVD.    Thanks to another reviewer for pointing out that the double-sided DVDs have \\"regular\\" TV versions on one side, and HDTV versions on the other.  I've seen only regular TV versions so far -- they're incredibly sharp and crisp compared to the originals.
B0012DOOF6|5.0|As any Beatles fan already knows this album (CD)may be the groups best ever compilation of original music, in my opinion the Beatles changed the face of music and created sounds that no one before them ever thought of as music, alarm clocks, crowing roosters,sustained notes the list goes on and on.  The music on these CD's starts out great and only gets better as the music progresses.  There are several CD's by The Beatles that are \\"Must Haves\\" and this is one of them and one of the best parts is that this comes along with 25 bonus tracks.  Well Worth The Price, Scott
0374531269|3.0|Unfortunately this book was marred for me by the controversy over whether or not it is authentic memoir or a composite fictional account.  The thought that these things happen to any child is horrific. Beah describes them in spare but vivid language without getting bogged down in description. He puts a face on UNESCO statistics. The telling is sometimes graphic; the emotions of children killing, dying and living with the nightmares of what they have seen and done is raw. Not all his child-soldier companions make it out, either physically or emotionally. The setting is Sierra Leone, but, tragically, it could just as easily have been Sudan, Uganda, Congo, Mozambique, or Angola.

B001KP2Y3K|4.0|As on her last two discs, Peyroux sings and plays dry, dry, dry.  This suppression of audible sound processing gives her recordings a small, house-concert atmosphere -- like she's sitting right across from you.  Every squeak of the guitar strings, every glottal click of her tongue is captured in all the raw glory.  Unlike her past recordings, Bare Bones is completely comprised of songs written or co-written by Peyroux herself.  Much of the material is done in a confessional, Joni-Mitchell style.  The standout track, reportedly inspired by Buddhist author Pema Chodron's book When Things Fall Apart:  Heart Advice for Difficult Times, is the opener, \\"Instead,\\" wherein Peyroux waxes positive on positive thinking (\\"instead of wastin' time, feel good 'bout what you're dreamin' of.\\").  Bare Bones is a testament to being true to oneself.
B001PPGAIA|5.0|It's a Baz Luhrman movie, and I honestly don't like everything he's done. I loved \\"Romeo and Juliet\\", but I completely detest \\"Moulin Rouge\\". I tried to watch it several times, but I didn't survive the first thirty minutes without desperately wishing he wouldn't waste my time with that crap. (Sorry, fans.)     Okay... I watched \\"Australia\\" because the trailers made me incredibly curious, and I must say that I stubbornly and shamelessly heart it. To pieces.     Which has a lot to do with my unending love for classical movies, of course. If you try to see Luhrman's movie only as a singular plot and a huge panorama, you might think that the whole thing is sadly overdone. But if you are a fan of movies like \\"Red River\\", or like \\"The Inn of the Sixth Happiness\\", you'll recognize \\"Australia\\" as what it is: a loving reverence to film makers and directors like Howard Hawks and Mark Robson and Burt Kennedy. Sometimes with a very visible twinkle in the eye (like in the camp scene, when we see Hugh Jackman as the male hero, water running in slow motion over his bare upper body while the heroine - Nicole Kidman - watches him from her tent, with a mixture of fascination and anger. And then the camera takes a very short dip down from Jackman's dripping chest to the spot more than one woman in the audience doubtlessly would die to see. It's only a second, it's a slightly rude joke, and you can see Luhrman giggle in front of your inner eye).     I watched \\"Red River\\" countless times when I was a child, and when all the good, classical movies were aired on those sleepy Sunday afternoons you best spent in front of the TV. I watched \\"The Inn of the Sixth Happiness\\" even more often, and I finally bought the DVD a few years ago. I laughed my a... off about \\"Support your local Sheriff\\" (with James Garner), and all of that doubtlessly makes me an ideal candidate for \\"Australia\\".     The story is told by the Aborigine boy Nullah (wonderful: Brendan Walters in his very first role ever), andit begins with a mysterious murder. The child spends some time with his grandfather who just shows him how to fish when suddenly white men are coming, and Nullah is told to hide in the water. A white man practically collapses dead on top of him, and when the boy returns to the farm Faraway Downs (where he lives), he first meets the victim's wife, Lady Sarah Ashley (great performance: Nicole Kidman). She has just arrived from England, to persuade her husband to sell the farm, and she's brought to Faraway Downs by the Drover (Jackman, whose wholehearted embodiment of the rugged Aussie is simply the performance of his life).     Now there are 1500 pieces of cattle that have to be brought to Darwin, and there is the inevitable Cattle Baron (very good: Australian veteran actor Bryan Brown) who tries to get his hand on Ashley's farm. His minion, the headman of the farm (and murderer of Ashley's husband), is played by David Wenham - and he does an incredible job, giving the audience a true (but still charming) rattle snake of a villain. He's Nullah's father (after having taken advantage of the fact that Nullah's mother is a handmaid on Faraway Downs), and he's even more dangerous than the Cattle Baron (who at least owns a working conscience while he possesses nothing of that sort).     So we have the cattle drive (which is a deep bow to movies like \\"Red River\\"), complete with a fire attack and a stampede. Of course the prissy, touchy Lady develops a sense for adventure, masters the whole task with strength and humor and finally falls for the country, the delightful Nullah and - of course - for the Drover. How could she not? All that might be terribly cheesy and might ring hollow, if not for Luhrman's sure hand with this classical plot line and the wonderful actors. (One of my favorite - earlier - scenes of the movie is the moment when Drover and Lady Sarah first meet. It's pure slapstick - including a classical Saloon brawl, bursting luggage and lacy \\"unspeakables\\", sailing through the air - and it made me laugh out loud. And it made me think of \\"Support your local Sheriff\\", of course. Heh.).     Then the cattle is in Darwin and even aboard of the ship (which means that Lady Ashley actually gets the money to save the farm), and this is where the love story begins. There are very few really \\"explicit\\" scenes in the movie (though you get a satisfying amount of hugging and kissing), and that - again - gives the movie a beautifully old-fashioned touch. Lady Sarah returns to Faraway Downs together with Nullah and the Drover, and at this point we would have seen enough to have our \\"Happily Ever After\\" - but Luhrman wants more.     People have said that \\"Australia\\" wants too much and is entirely too long. Bah Humbug, I say. After regularly watching the three Special Extended Editions of \\"Lord of the Rings\\", a movie of 164 minutes won't shock me at all. And of course I want to see more.     Drover's and Sarah's happiness is only an interlude, as it had to be expected. Neil Fletcher (Wenham's role) kills the Cattle Baron, marries his daughter and renews his efforts to snatch the farm away from Lady Ashley. He kidnaps his own son and gets him dragged to Mission Island (which was a place to herd the mixed race Aborigine children and \\"to drive the black out of them\\"). This is historical truth, by the way, and a really sad one. In the end credits Luhrman points out that those abducted children - and there were not only mixed race kids but countless others as well - had to wait until 2008 for the Autralian Prime Minister to actually ask the \\"Lost Generation\\" for their forgiveness. About time, I'd say.     The Drover has left the farm for an army cattle drive - against the will and wish of Sarah - and now she has to try and rescue the child herself. Fletcher offers her to bring Nullah back from the island if she sells Faraway Downs to him, and she agrees. Meanwhile the Drover heads for Darwin, to reconcile with the woman he loves, and he arrives just in time to watch the damage done by the first air strike against Australia ever (by the Japanese air force, on February 19, 1942). He's told that Sarah is on duty in the Army Headquarters (working as a telephone operator), but when he hurries there, the building is roaring with flames. (From this moment on you can see this truly gifted actor outshine the whole cast, and you should have a huge pile of hankies ready).     Thinking that Sarah is lost, the Drover finally finds out that Nullah never went on his personal \\"Walkabout\\", but is imprisoned on Mission Island, and he starts a rescue mission, abducting a boat and desperately trying to save as many children as possible. Those whole 20 minutes of \\"Australia\\" are an enthusiastic reverence to \\"The Inn of the Sixth Happiness\\" (a movie that still makes me bawl my eyes out after more than 30 years of watching it again and again). There be the singing voices of children, a harmonica, playing \\"Somewhere over the Rainbow\\" (which is Nullah's favorite song), a brilliant Nicole Kidman in one of the most emotional moments of the movie, and a Hugh Jackman who is just... gah.    You're still with me? Wow. Rent the movie. Watch it on the biggest screen available. Enjoy.
0762434279|3.0|I really liked this book, except for the fact that it's a super mini pocket abridged version and the description does not really point this out clearly at all.  Just today a friend of mine showed me his copy and was like \\"how did this happen.\\"<br /><br />I would like to get the un-abridged version so I can read it fully, because what I read in this version it looks to be really good.

The music, the actors, the sets, the amazing costumes!!! One of the best movies I have seen in a while.     I never knew that Nicole and Ewan would be able to sing the way they did!! The elephant love medly was one of my favorite scenes...Along with spectacular spectacular. Oh and the opening scene at the moulin rouge. Hell I loved it all!!!     If you havent seen this movie, you ought too. You wont be disappointed.

0375836675|4.0|There's very little positive that one can say about Ed Kennedy's achievements in life and, what's even worse, he knows it. At the tender age of nineteen, he's already suffering a full blown mid-life crisis. His best friend is a dog so smelly it could gag a sewer rat at twenty paces. The only job he's had which amounts to the tiniest hill of beans is driving a cab. He's madly in love with Audrey, a girl who refuses to love anyone and treats him only as her best friend. His male friends, Richie and Marvin, are equally washed up. Their only entertainments are rugby, boozing and playing cards. His father was an alcoholic and his mother treats him with utter disdain and a complete lack of respect.<br /><br />Whether it was the right place at the right time or the wrong place at the wrong time is a matter of debate but, one day in the middle of his otherwise humdrum life, Ed Kennedy is caught in the middle of a bank robbery. When he manages to nab the robber, he is hailed as a local hero and destiny pushes his life down a new path. He begins to receive anonymous coded messages on playing cards instructing him to be at a certain address at a certain time. Clearly, on the basis of his ability to halt a bank robbery, somebody is assigning him to a series of tasks which are intended to change other people's lives. The missions are widely varied - rescuing a woman from a nightly rape by her alcohol-soaked husband; giving the gift of happiness to a confused elderly lady by assuming the role of her long dead husband; providing an enthusiastic congregation to an unfulfilled parish priest; forcing spiteful brothers to recognize their love for one another; and so on.  And whoever is behind these cryptic messages is not allowing Ed the option of declining the invitation. A serious beating at the hands of two mysterious night visitors convinces Ed that he has no choice but to assume the role of \\"the messenger\\".<br /><br />\\"I am the Messenger\\" is, of course, a message. It is intended to convey the idea that worldly achievements - wealth, good looks or fame, for example - are not the basis of a fulfilled life. Love, charity, friendship, happiness and other more lasting virtues not only come from somewhere else entirely but require considerable investment of effort to achieve them.<br /><br />Adults reading \\"I am the Messenger\\" may think that Zusak has succumbed to sermonizing. They might also suggest that the emotional impact of his novel is so sweet as to be cloying. However, if we remember that Zusak's intended audience is the young adults in grades 9 to 12, then we might forgive him for being a little obvious and leaving a little less to the intuitive leaps of a more mature reader.<br /><br />While it doesn't have quite the gripping power of his previous novel, \\"The Book Thief\\", \\"I am the Messenger\\" is still quite capable of putting a lump in your throat and a smile on your face. Engaging characters, raw but realistic dialogue, endearing life-affirming messages and a satisfying ending make \\"I am the Messenger\\" a novel well worth the time invested to read it. Highly recommended.<br /><br />Paul Weissea that worldly achievements - wealth, good looks or fame, for example - are not the basis of a fulfilled life. Love, charity, friendship, happiness and other more lasting virtues not only come from somewhere else entirely but require considerable investment of effort to achieve them.

However, if we remember that Zusak's intended audience is the young adults in grades 9 to 12, then we might forgive him for being a little obvious and leaving a little less to the intuitive leaps of a more mature reader.    While it doesn't have quite the gripping power of his previous novel, \\"The Book Thief\\", \\"I am the Messenger\\" is still quite capable of putting a lump in your throat and a smile on your face. Engaging characters, raw but realistic dialogue, endearing life-affirming messages and a satisfying ending make \\"I am the Messenger\\" a novel well worth the time invested to read it. Highly recommended.    Paul Weiss

B000T9OP7G|5.0|While this show has action, the action is not the selling point. The show is very well written. The plot is not simple and has an arc that spans the season(s), not just each episode. The show is canceled (as of now) at the end of season two probably because it is a little too complicated for the average viewer (my opinion). With out spoiling it, I will say that the last few episodes of season two (I know this is a season one review)are great and provide some closure to story lines. So DON\\"T feel like you should not start watching the series just because you will be left hanging (though it is not all wrapped up with a bow, they wanted to come back and had to have us wanting more). If you like good science fiction I highly recommend this show. If you do not like science fiction but crave well a written intelligent program (rare these days) you should give this show a try.
0140120416|2.0|This book offers a conventional explanation of russian grammar, and that's about it.  I could see it useful as a reference, but for learning russian it's ineffective.  The few exercises are simple (drills) and isolated; they're mostly  random sentences with blanks to fill.  Later exercises repeat very little of previous lessons and never seem cohesive.  You'll constantly be flipping back to previous chapters for grammar points seldom revisited.  Each chapter's vocab contains a smattering of foods, household objects, verbs of motion that are difficult to combine into one's own compositions.  Other textbooks might group travel words for example, so that  the student could write usefully about that aspect of his life.  In this book, vocab is presented without any theme.<br /><br />Even the grammar outlines, its strong point, are tediously explained with the language's irregularities drawn out as additional rules rather than mere exceptions.  Rare uses of words are presented on the same level as everyday speech, especially when prepositions are introduced.  The reader is left to waste time on archaic formations that she'll seldom see.  The book is noisy, sometimes old fashioned and meanders through essential aspects of russian language while mixing in useless curios.  It ultimately fails because of the unorganized vocabulary and the poor exercises.
B001U7FWM8|3.0|My bartender's guide lists the recipe for a long island iced tea as follows:  2 tsp vodka  2 tsp gin  2 tsp rum  2 tsp triple sec  2 tsp tequila  2 tsp lemon juice  Add cola as desired    I've never really understood the appeal of a long island iced tea.  There are plenty of decent drinks to make with only rum or vodka.  And tequila pretty much stands on its own.  Not that they taste bad or anything - I just don't think the combination of all these good things makes something superior.    Which brings me to Veckatimest.  I like it alright, but, honestly it sounds just like this:  2 tsp [[ASIN:B0018TAFW0 Dr Dog - Fate]]  2 tsp [[ASIN:B000M06KCA The Besnard Lakes - The Besnard Lakes Are the Dark Horse]]  2 tsp [[ASIN:B000QEIOXK The Polyphonic Spree - The Fragile Army]]  2 tsp [[ASIN:B000002UJQ Radiohead - OK Computer]]  2 tsp [[ASIN:B00005ASHM The Beach Boys - Pet Sounds]]  2 tsp [[ASIN:B000066HI4 Bonnie \\"Prince\\" Billy - I See a Darkness]]  Add [[ASIN:B00000JC6C The Flaming Lips - The Soft Bulletin]] as desired    The DJ's over on Sirius XMU are wetting themselves over this album so I thought I'd give it a shot.  And as much as I am enjoying it - and I did give it three stars - I can't help but wonder why they (and plenty of folks on Amazon as well as in the music press) think a combination of other four and five star elements makes something even better.    Bottom Line: don't hesitate to buy this as it is pretty good.  Just make sure you check out the others I listed - they're better.
0671510991|4.0|Although a bit lengthy, Diplomacy as a whole stands as a well put together work that is informative to those who are both new to foreign policy or well-versed in the field. A definite must-read for any budding politicos out there.
0618526412|5.0|It is amazing to think that Carson McCullers was only twenty-three when she wrote \\"The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter\\", a novel that is full of experience and wisdom beyond the author's years.  McCullers was a gifted writer, comfortable in various skins, who offered her readers vivid portraits of strange characters and who raised some intriguing questions along the way.<br /><br />\\"The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter\\" focuses on four characters who are all drawn to confess their deepest, darkest thoughts and feelings to the town mute, Mr. John Singer.  There is Mick Kelly, a tomboy of a girl on the verge of womanhood, who dreams of more than her small town can offer her and who is dying to find a way to express the music she keeps within herself.  There is the hopeless drifter, Jake Blount, a drunk and unseemly man who bristles at the unfair treatment of the workers and the poor.  There is Dr. Copeland, an educated black man who wanted the best for his children but was doomed to watch them settle down to living stereotypes and cliches.  And there is Biff Brannon, proprietor of the New York Cafe, a man who watches and knows all that goes on but doesn't truly fit anywhere.  All four befriend the mute Singer thinking he understands what it is they're searching for, and even though they would count him as their friend, Singer's life and his motivations remain a complete enigma to them all.<br /><br />\\"The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter\\" is a bittersweet and poignant examination of humanity and morality in the South.  McCuller's characters are vividly drawn and her prose is captivating, brutally honest but tender at the same time.  Not much happens in terms of plot, being rather an intimate examination of these unique intersecting lives.  It is a book that is difficult to put down, a truly heartbreaking tale that deserves to be considered a masterpiece of American literature.

0066620996|5.0|This book covers everything you need to know to take an average good company to becoming a GREAT company!! Leaves you wanting more.. I now see why this book is seen as a prequel to Jim Collins \\"Built to Last.\\" This is a very simple book with very simple conclusions and concepts. Never understood the Hedgehog concept until Collins explained and showed how the GREAT companies applied it. Even if you have no desire to be great, this book has really changed my life in a way of simplifying what I aim to do while increasing effectiveness.
B000002H6C|4.0|And Justice For All is a good album, musically speaking but sonically it's dead in the water. Dynamics, other than some rests in between riffs, are no where to be found. From my understanding Lars wanted Mike Clink to produce the album. He liked his work with Gun's & Roses. But for some unknown reason Clink became separated from the project half way through so Flemming had to come back in and complete what Clink started. I think that has a lot to do with the bad production plus I have noticed that when ever James and Lars get behind the console the results tend to be on the saturated and over compressed side.<br /><br />Many claim this album was Metallica's best or at least one of their best albums. My belief is that the single \\"One\\" and the accompanying video exposed them to a wider audience of MTV watching/following posers and that's why this album has a larger following. But beside the dumb masses opinion I do like this album. Metallica wrote some clever hooks, beautiful harmonies, smart lyrics, and honored Cliff with a writing credit.<br /><br />Strong points are:<br />\\"One\\" the machine gun ending was unique and served the lyrical theme of the song though they had covered this ground previously in RTL's \\"Fight Fire With Fire\\". But like I sad before the MTV generation hadn't caught on until this song was endlessly rotated.<br />\\"Eye of The Beholder\\" great syncopation catchy unpredictable riffs and an interesting spin on our idea of American freedom.<br />\\"Blackened\\" just a killer song and one of Jason's few writing credits. I wish they would have respected him more and used more of his material.<br />\\"To Live Is To Die\\" great instrumental with a short but sweet spoken poem written by their previous bass player and song writer whom died tragically.<br />\\"Harvester Of Sorrow\\" this song has the hole BA Baracus thing going for it. The staccato rhythm in the verse really creates an angry yet terrorizing mood which greatly reflect the lyrical content of abusive family relationships. This song did set a rhythmic trend that people copy like crazy to this day.<br />\\"Frayed Ends Of Sainty\\" I love the Wizard of Oz \\"March of the Winkies\\" rip off. The solo in this song is awesome and creates anticipation while adding dimension.<br />\\"Dyer's Eve\\" The cool thing about this song is the drums do way more then the guitar. While James is singing the guitars are just holding whole notes. But in-between verses the guitars get more interesting and then just sit back and rest.<br /><br />All in all I recommend this album but because of production, mixing, and mastering I can only give 4 stars. I wish the engineer would have done a better job and James and Lars would have stayed away from the console.<br /><br />Side note - Funny thing about Mike Clink is that he worked with Megadeth on \\"Rust in Peace\\" a year or so later and had no problems. My understanding is that Dave Mustaine is a very difficult person to work with but that aside my opinion is And Justice is a good album but Rust in Peace is a stronger album because of sonic clarity.  Both albums have fairly logic and tasteful song structure that defined and expanded the genre.relationships.

1595141979|5.0|This was for sure the best book so far!  The great thing about Richelle Mead's books is that she always makes sure that the characters grow throughout her series.  Rose grows up a lot in this book from her massacre of the Strigoi to her relationship with Dimitri and I for one loved being able to see it happen.  That's another great thing about this book.  It was so easy to visualize what was going on.  That really makes a book go from good to great for me.  There was one part though that really fell flat for me.  When Dimitri and Rose are finally together physically... my mind went blank.  There was all of 4 lines dedicated to something that had been in the making for 3 books and all it gets is 4 lines????  WTH?  Mead writes something to the effect of \\"there are no words to describe....\\".  Seriously?  That almost made me give 4 stars instead of 5 but the rest of the book was just so good....  Lastly, this book doesn't end well for some of our favorite characters.  Richelle has this habit/talent for writing these fantastic stories with devastating events and then at the end leaves you with a haunting last line that makes your stomach ache and leaves you begging for info on what happens next.  How on earth are we supposed to wait for the next book?  I guess it's not like we really have a choice...  Can't wait!
0545123267|5.0|For Grace, wolves have always held a certain fascination, a certain magic, particularly her yellow-eyed wolf that she's watched for six years. Little does she know that he's been watching her too, her protector from afar. Little does she know that her wolf doesn't actually disappear for the summer like she thought, but spends the warmest season as the human he once was, Sam. Fate brings Grace and Sam together, but they must fight against all odds to stay that way. When humanity is as fragile as a drop in temperature, Grace and Same must find away to protect themselves and their love from the forces that threaten to tear them apart.    Stifvater weaves a fantastically beautiful paranormal romance in Shiver. This novel's strength by far is its unique and alluring plot with characters that are surprisingly realistic despite the unusually circumstances in which they're placed. Both Maggie and Sam are outcasts in their own way, each clinging to a seemingly impossible, at least in their present, remnant of the past. I think that's what makes them so perfect together and so interesting to read about, that and the fact that they are so obviously in love, even when they're two separate species. The reader will get swept up in the exciting world Stiefvater has created, both for the mysticism inspired by Sam's paranormal species, which Stiefvater explains remarkably well, and hope that these star-crossed lovers will survive the winter, literally. This novel is so much more than just a really good romance, though. It's about finding identity, doing the right thing even when it's the hardest, and the everlasting power of love. Shiver is the kind of book I love to get lost in because its story is just so sweet, sexy, romantic, and heartwarming; overall, it's a book that will make all readers sigh in happiness.    Shiver will be enjoyed by all teen readers, particularly fans of Sea Change by Aimee Friedman, Evermore by Alyson Noël, Wicked Lovely and Ink Exchange both by Melissa Marr, Need by Carrie Jones, Twilight by Stephenie Meyer, and The Forest of Hands and Teeth by Carrie Ryan. I can't wait to read Stiefvater's other novels, Lament and Ballad, and whatever else she has to come.
B000AM2L1O|3.0|Cute doll, sorta. In the product image above, the doll looks BEAUTIFUL, but when I received it in the mail, it was a HUGE disappointment... The doll came smelling like vanilla, except with a hint of spoiled hard-boiled egg. Overall a cute doll except it has teeth. It is a tiny newborn doll with ugly, yellow teeth. Not easy to get rid of. Don't buy.

I am very happy with both DVD sets (and with hubby for buying them for me!)<br /><br />The stories and writing are fantastic, as well as the acting.  Each DVD set comes with extras on most of the discs, as well as an entire Doctor Who Confidential disc packed with extras.  I will definitely be getting seasons 3 and 4 asap!
0307474275|4.0|When I read the novel, it was apparent to me how Mr. Brown wrote it!! He made up the whole story first with a simple plot...and then while writing it, he exerted every effort possible to weave it into a web of tangled deceptions that only aim at complicating it and leading you away from figuring out the originally much simpler plot!! I give him 5 stars for deception and 3 stars for exceptional novel writing! I like his riddle making abilities but I kind felt they were forcefully connected with weakly relevant answers. Like the apple, A. Pope and Sophia...describing an apple as a globe!! the unnecessary use of Greek to come up with Sophia...writing a pope at first then showing it as A. pope!! sorry but these are deceptions not riddles!! I kind felt he infused the whole novel with turning points that doesn't happen normally in real life; rather just to force making his plot possible and look more smooth. What he might not noticed that all of these twists and turns made the plot very complicated, confusing and emanates  artificially created events.<br /><br />The names of the grand masters of the Priory of Sion were proven to be fabricated along with the secret society. The Frenchman who fabricated it called Plantard confessed under oath!! He was even sued by the Pelat family for involving them in the Priory of Sion. Logically speaking, how could the line of Jesus stay secret for 2000 years! Even if we bought that, how could the sarcophagus of Mary Magdalen move around  so much unnoticed?! from Jerusalem to France and then back again and then all over Europe till it rested in France!! Let alone the incredulous pagan sex ritual performed by descendants of a prominent religious figure like Jesus!!<br /><br />One thing for sure....Mr. Brown knew how to pick up a highly controversial issue like the holy grail and its sensitive connection with Christianity and turn it into an acclaimed factual novel to make money....and he succeeded!! $240 Million isn't a small fortune...I'm not a conservative, but I do like novels that place more importance on passing on values that meliorate human societies than to weave conspiracies to generate sales.tive, but I do like novels that place more importance on passing on values that meliorate human societies than to weave conspiracies to generate sales.
1406315923|5.0|Beautifully illustrated, this little rhyming book is a charming way to introduce the concept of counting to toddlers. Most two year olds will understand every word in this vocabulary, and when I read it to my grand daughter last week, her impulse was, of course, to check out her own fingers and toes. A fun bit of word play and learning.

B0018M6J90|5.0|Love and life have bypassed middle-aged Guinevere Pettigrew, who is the quintessential English governess, newly unemployed. Beautiful but ditsy American singer Delysia Lafosse is doing her utmost to land a plum role on the London stage. When Guinevere approaches Delysia in hopes of a job, opposites attract, and it isn't long before Guinevere sets her mind to helping her find true happiness. And to eating as much as she possibly can before this bubble bursts.<br /><br />Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day is filled with humor and music, as Guinevere steers Delysia through her tumultuous day. Complications abound. The governess smokes a cigar, undergoes a makeover, and falls prey to blackmail from an unscrupulous social climber. Delysia, deaf to Guinevere's wisdom, makes all the wrong decisions. Will Delysia ever find true happiness? Will Miss Pettigrew?<br /><br />Frances McDormand is outstanding in the title role, while Amy Adams reprises her wide-eyed, golly-gee persona from Enchanted. Ciaran Hinds and Lee Pace are also well-cast. Pacing is quick and direction tight, and the visuals of the glamorous milieu of pre-WWII London are elegant and sophisticated. The bouncy, 1930's era soundtrack perfectly sets the tone. A frothy romantic comedy with heart, highly recommended.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|Warm, wonderful, beautiful, allegorical, moving and heartfelt. Pixar do not seem to do run of the mill. Thank God they are not the child of their parent company!<br /><br />Up is fantastical tale of Carl Fredericksen, an old man with nothing left to lose letting go and following his childhood dream. Hitching a ride on Carls flying home is Russell, a young widerness explorer scout and together the mis-matched pair set off in the footsteps of Carls childhood hero, daredevil explorer Charles Muntz (wonderfully voiced by Christopher Plummer), to Paradise Falls in darkest South America.<br /><br />As with Wall-E, Up does not start like a kids movie, adults of an emotive disposition will be in tears within the first 10 minutes and most of the first quarter is scene setting, done, like Wall-E again, with a minimal amount of dialogue. Revealtions, when they come, will also mean more to an adult audience; the very real perception that we are all too busy chasing the dream to realise the dream is what we already have in everyone and everything around us; the moral that one should never meet ones heroes because even heroes are fallable. And, of course, for the kids, the triumph of good and friendship over evil.<br /><br />However, Up is a genuine family film. Pixar have really mastered the balance of enjoyment for all ages and the reward for the little ones to sit patiently through that first quarter is plenty of cute and comical once our heroes land in the jungle. Dug the clueless golden retriever and his pack, Squirrel! and Fred the bird are a joy. Not manic, or over the top, or Disney stupid but well rounded fall guys that you warm to immediately. Subsequent adventures may see septuagenarian Carl turn into some kind of Indiana Jones (the only incongruous note to the film considering his previous incapacitation) but Up is still head and shoulders above anything else produced outside of the Pixar stable. It is beautifully well observed and loaded with deft touches; the animation is, yet again, impeccable.<br /><br />So there are plenty of morals to be taught and lessons to be learnt and good will out etc. etc. But there's talking dogs (dozens more than Bolt (and a dozen times funnier!)), a flying house, a chocolate addicted bird and a crazy scientist explorer. The dark bits are not excessively so and many of the funny bits are laugh-out-loud funny. If it is perhaps, too plodding for younger audiences then that is to Pixars credit for not dumbing down and chasing the pandering parent pound. Up is another addition to their impressive catalogue of genuine family classics.<br /><br />Another great film, a film that's for life, not just the holiday season.peccable.

1905654294|1.0|I had already written a review and it had been deleted. Let's try again.<br /><br />When I was reading this, I'll admit, I was thrilled I had finally gotten my hands on Breaking Dawn. I was like Bella, a teenager in love with Edward and Jacob--as much as any fan of the series could be. But this book has undone absolutely everything the 3 before it created. All the characterizations, the foreshadowing, plots, everything that should have happened did not--or if it did, was so mashed up that the story looked like it had just been scrawled on a page and then typed As-Is with no look-over from an editor. Did they even read this before wasting trees?<br /><br />In chapter 3 I decided this book was going to make me cry. On page 360 I did indeed. The spell of the sparkling-fangless-vampires was broken! I was freed from their manicured, sweater-wearing stupidity! Nevertheless, I continued my path into the depths of a bad LSD trip on it's pages.<br /><br />Edward became a useless background character who ripped pillows. Bella became an idiot in heels. Jake howled. Alice ran. It was not good.<br /><br />\\"Imprinting\\" is just disgusting and frustrating.<br /><br />The idea that werewolves are now forever pedophiles is just stomach-turning. EWWWW. I LOVED Jacob, I won't deny how I was a Jacob fangirl. I honestly was Team Jacob(even though I knew it would never happen except in fanfiction) But now, I want to yell when I think of him and his nasty fate! If my ex-boyfriend ever wanted to marry my minute-old babe I would castrate him then and there and be done. Ew. EWW. There is no excuse for this nasty book.<br /><br />It is not \\"ok\\" because it magically changes to sexual attraction overnight. Ew.<br /><br />Repetitive sentences galore! Chargine chargine angst angst angst. Anne Rice is still and will forever be known as the Queen of Vampires.<br /><br />My word:<br />The series ended with Eclipse. And if you want to save yourself $ then the story ended with Twilight as it ORIGINALLY had been intended.had been intended.

B001SMC91M|4.0|Joe Lewis no doubt spent many, many hours of his youth singing James Brown songs into a hairbrush, and honestly it was time well spent.  With Tell 'em What Your name Is! He picks up the tradition of good old-fasioned R&B and carries it proudly down that well worn dirt road.<br />While he certainly doesn't have a voice that measures up to such a lofty comparison as Brown, it is the voice Mick Jagger spent many years of his youth wishing he had.  Lewis wields a potent, brash bark that is over-flowing with soul, and is backed by a tight, hard driving combo of horns, guitar, and rhythm section that would make any Stax fan feel right at home.<br />When I hear most of what passes for R&B on the radio these days, over-produced with no rough edges, and a computer for a rhythm section, It just makes me sad.<br />But hearing someone like Joe Lewis flat out warms my heart and makes me look forward to more.
B0002XDODU|5.0|This album is solid from start to finish. Rammstein makes use of their diversity in music and lyrics on this hard-hitting album. My personal favorite is, perhaps, the title track, but every single song on here is good, from the slower paced \\"Ohne Dich\\" to the faster-paced \\"Morgenstern\\". I recommend this album to nearly all metal fans, whether they speak German or not!
0066620996|4.0|One of the particular things I like about this book is that the author is an expert in the background of business and the specific field he is talking about. As a former professor of the business school at Stanford University, he backs up what he has to say with data and evidence. He is not one of those guys that's just trying to sell a book that claims they can make millions of dollars for people. Apart from this he thanks and mentions a whole number of people at the very beginning of the book that helped him complete and write his book. His concepts may seem a bit generalized but they are straightforward, and broken down into a good outline. As a result these ideas explain how companies went from being good to great. The book provides the reader with insight and thought provoking ideas that may even some day help the reader to become successful both in their professional and personal lives.    The book is basically broken down into three stages.  The author shows this with an example of a flywheel describing the buildup of a company. It starts with getting disciplined people, then having disciplined thought, and taking disciplined action. The book starts by mentioning that every company had a level 5 leader to be successful. These were highly disciplined people with humility and an intense drive for the company to succeed. They also put the company before themselves and made sure that their successors were better or as good as them. Then it mentions that the good to great companies were selective in getting the right people and putting them in the right spots to drive the company in the right direction.    One of the great parts about the books is that every chapter begins with a quote that relates to the core ideas of each chapter. It's almost as if these statements are thesis statements that contain deep meanings. The next chapter in the book is probably the one I like the best from the entire book. It talks about how the good to great companies confronted the brutal facts of reality. The book provides real life examples of how CEOs dealt with the decisions they made. A key concept that ties in with this decision making is called the Stockdale Paradox. It says you must have \\"faith that you will prevail in the end but at the same time you must confront the brutal facts of your reality.\\" Based on this idea the good to great CEOs were able to stay focused and make the right choices.    When it comes to focus the book talks about the hedgehog concept which basically says if you know what you're passionate about, what drives your \\"economic  engine,\\" and what you can be the best at, then the point where these points converge is what your focus should be. This is the point where the good to great companies focused on and that is what helped to create sustained growth. The beginning quote in the chapter says it best, \\"Know thyself.\\" It also makes note of making a \\"not to do list\\" so that the companies don't limit their growth. Also the companies used technology as a means to increase their momentum for growth.  These factors are all tied in with what the book says is a \\"culture of discipline.\\" It basically states that you should have disciplined people who have freedom and responsibility of what they need to do. Their focus should be on the hedgehog concept. I think this is a great idea because the book emphasizes that bureaucracy in the company will heed growth and having disciplined people make their own choices of what needs to be done will provide for better growth opportunities.    This book is a quick read, and it provides some great ideas for people to apply and implement the concepts stated above within their own companies and even personal lives.  The key ideas I derived from this book was that a good to great company should have focus (discipline), teamwork, humility, well thought out decision making choices, and a clear will to succeed. Those people who are looking for ideas to become great at what they do will obtain some clear guidelines and concepts by reading this book.
B00004Y6NU|5.0|I feel sorry for the reviewer who said she'd prefer it if the two long tracks were several four minute tracks.  Says a lot for her attention span and ability to concentrate (not).  I could recommend a few bands for her, but I might get flamed by crowds of 13-year old females.    These tracks are absolutely fantastic.  How could you get the amazing music development, slow sustained and incredibly controlled buildup and story theme into four minutes?      This is my favorite album of all times.  It contains all of the best Dire Straits tracks with the exception of \\"Money for Nothing.\\"    Fantabulous.
075640407X|2.0|I wanted to like this, tried hard to do so, but in the end The Name of the Wind simply is not a good book. One would think that in book this size something would actually happen by the end, but not so. Nothing happens and there's so very little to hold one's interest. The worst of it is the lazy writing and the overuse of a very tired plot device: the flashback. This is essentially a book-long flashback. If you've ever watched a flashback episode in a tv show, you know it's used when the writers are stuck and can't think of anything else better to do. A few pages of flashback might have been okay, if something ever happened of consequence, but in this one it's rare for anything of consequence to happen. It all becomes meaningless. Definitely not worth your precious reading time or money. There are so many better books out there.

0307455874|3.0|An interesting insight into the thoughts of President Barack Obama, written when he the Senator of Illinois.  While no one can deny that his aspirations for a more inclusive, more progressive America are expressed in very emotive and thoughtful way, I personally do find it troubling that on some of the tougher ethical stances, which are equally important for supporters of both sides, that he does tend to hedge his bets both ways Chapter 6 Faith is a good example of this.  I consider this read a 4 out of 5 for readability and a 2 out of 5 for personal agreement to what he is actually saying.  I look forward to re-reading this when President Obama is in the last part of his second term (At this stage I do not see the Republicans being able to find a personality that will be able to surpass that of the President) and reviewing my thoughts.

076781214X|5.0|Normally I tend to avoid comedies, preferring psychological dramas or action films.  So when my partner dragged me to this, I was surprised and delighted as its depth and ironies and multi-layered story.<br /><br />It starts off in a mid-life crisis:  mom is separated and struggling, has a caring child, and wonders if her whole life has been a mistake at her 25th reunion.  Suddenly, she finds herself back in time, right at the moment that she made her most important choices.<br /><br />When she realizes that she may actually be back in time, she injects a kind of nostalgic sarcasm into everything unlike any comedy I have ever seen.  It is funny, moving, and deep, quite an amazing combination.  You never know if it was just a dream, but suspect it was not.<br /><br />The acting is absolutely wonderful, too.  This may be K Turner's best role:  she is at turns beautiful, awkward, sexy, mean, caring, ironic, and loving.  And it is all believable.  This was also the first film I saw Nicolas Cage in, and he is an amazingly good adolescent of the late 50s.  Sophia Coppola is also wonderful.<br /><br />I was scared I might be disappointed seeing this nearly 20 years after I first saw it, but it moved me just as deeply.  This is one of the best comedies I have ever seen, worthy of a talent like Coppola's.
B001EAWMGA|5.0|Bought \\"Outlander\\" on the strength of online reviews.  Couldn't be happier! I like films that do 150% without a bazillion dollar budget. \\"Terminator\\" was like that. \\"Outlander\\" is like that. Acting, plot, and sets just great.  It's my summer 2009 movie.
B000002UCQ|4.0|George Harrison may have been the 'quiet' Beatle but this album is far from quiet. You have a lot of his hit's here...from My Sweet Lord,  Wah-Wah and If Not For You to Beware of Darkness and the best song on the album, the haunting All Things Must Pass.<br /><br />George Harrison died far to young and far too soon for his legions of fans. The best thing about George, other than his humor and caring attitude, was the music he left behind. When you listen to this Cd you can almost hearken back to better times.
159448385X|5.0|I loved this book! Stayed up all last night because I couldn't go to sleep without finishing it. It was very well written and poignant, it was truly a roller coaster book.. one minute my eyes would be all watery, then i would be laughing.. You will not regret buying this book... but i have to say women will probably enjoy it more than men. I hope to see more novels from Hosseini!
B001WCN232|1.0|I recommend against buying this album because the final track, Star Star, has been censored and neutered from it's original version.  One can assume that the censorship resulted from an effort to comply with Wal-Mart's language policies (WM is the USA's #1 music retailer).  I am a huge fan of the Rolling Stones, and do not blame them in the least; but I'm also a huge fan of Free Speech and Artistic Freedom.  Please do not support censorship.
0385335997|3.0|I finished the third book in the series and I'm now more than ever convinced that this stuff is literary crack. Some goooood literary crack mind you but addicting nonetheless. I'm really enjoying Jamie and Claire's adventures and this book has to have the best reunion scene I've ever read along with some fabulous followups and twists and turns! Whoa. One needs to take a break in between heavy scenes for fear of overload.<br /><br />Voyager takes place literary right after where Dragonfly in Amber stopped. Claire is still trying to track down Jamie and finally, with Roger and her daughter Bree's help, finds him. The beginning is interesting in the fact that it's sort of parallel. We see Jamie's live as he lives it in the past while his love tracks him down in the future. Poor Jamie still goes through some trials in war torn Scotland after the battle of Culloden still suffers from England's affects after the Jacobite Rising of the '45.<br /><br />I was zipping through the beginning like crazy in a sleep deprived mind continued to see when Claire made her way through the stones again and to the moment when she see an older Jamie. I couldn't wait to see what they talked about and how they would treat each other. It was very realistic in both were nervous to pick up where they left off. Wonderful stuff. The story then zips along with a bunch of things happening at once and we're (along with Claire) are introduced and re-introduced to side characters that have aged since we last saw them at the beginning of the book. A LOT of things happen that throw our fave couple for a loop including some re-appearances by some savory and unsavory characters alike. Especially our favorite little big mouth who ratted Claire out in Outlander. And tsk tsk tsk on Jamie. I love Jamie, perhaps more than any other literary hero in literature, but why!? I spoke with my friend recently and like her I was alternating between wanting to strangle Jamie and kiss him. (Seriously though, that chapter was superb when it all came out). The emotion in these books are immensely wild.<br /><br />I LOVED the previous two books in the series but I had a few pet peeves in Voyager. I've made this review spoilerific because these are specific instances. Claire kind of got on my nerves comparing herself to every 18th century woman she came across because she was freaking out about being older. (He loved YOU woman, it didn't matter what ya looked like! lol). Plus it's a given she would be in better health considering the modern technological advances where she came from in the 1960s.<br /><br />Also (said character stereotyping aside) Claire's reference to \\"the Chinaman\\" or \\"Jamie's Pet Chinaman\\" kind of rubbed me the wrong way. Claire comes from the 60s and I'm pretty sure from her travels she's been acquainted with Chinese people before. So I wasn't sure why she reacted like an 18th century woman.<br /><br />I wasn't too happy with the Jamie and Geneva situation. I guess I'm a bit selfish in that I only saw Jamie for Claire. But considering he figured the love of his life may never return, he shut down AND he was coerced into it by Geneva. Not to mention there's a convo between him and Claire about the depths a man will go to stave off the dark pit of his loneliness. His family and tenants lives were also on the line, understood but I guess it kind of nagged. I am interested in seeing how Gabaldon picks this up and from the looks of the upcoming book this act and the result of it will be like war itself. Knowing her writing style now, I know she doesn't leave threads hanging and tends to pick them up down the line in one way or another which is always interesting to read.<br /><br />These few instances aside (and an early throw away line Claire that also bothered me) I liked Voyager as the greater whole of the series but it didn't quite come up to the awesomeness of the first two books although it was good. It took awhile to bring back the same rush, excitement and consuming feeling as Dragonfly in Amber and Outlander especially. At times the characters didn't really seem like themselves based on how we got to know them from the first few books. Claire and Jamie seemed like two other characters with too many secrets held from one another (or maybe just Jamie from Claire) and their actions sometimes seemed a bit odd/out of character. Soon things fell into step and it was just like a continuation of the previous books especially once we got back to Lallybroch.<br /><br />Voyager was a fun read no doubt and my favorite parts were everything that led up to the reunion and their first love scene. Things started really getting interesting back at Lallybroch and the ride had only just begun then. Towards the end the book turned into adventure mode with pirates, plagues and some bizarre oddities in 18th century Caribbean. I'd probably give this a 3.5 stars if I could. The first two books had a nice balance of low key scenes with the high suspense and action sequences while this one felt a little unbalanced especially towards the end. Just as things were advancing between the two characters another plot twist would arise and toss a wrench into everything that it felt a bit uneven. Towards the end more and more bizarre things kept happening that didn't feel like I was in the same world as I started.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I can't get enough Jamie Fraser cause I'm hooked like a cold water trout.especially.

B00164KYV4|2.0|Could it be that men don't enjoy saying no anymore than we enjoy hearing it?  Or perhaps the idea was that insanely good looking people have the same difficulties you and I have.  Sure.  If Ben Affleck had ended up with Drew Barrymore, we might have the makings of an interesting story.  But to see this guy, who is like the male Sharon Tate, begging someone to take him back and to marry him was a bit much. By contrast, the Scarlet Johannsen \\"why can't we just be friends\\" story seemed about right but so sad, typical and well, just a drag.
0061478784|4.0|The purpose of purchasing this book was to read \\"House of Many ways\\" and giving the book itself to my 10-year-old niece. For that, I needed to know the whole story of this book and to find out some missing links in the movie. I enjoyed some elements of mystery but could not have a feeling of excitement until coming to the last chapter. Though I have not read any other magical fiction novels written by an English author, we may enjoy the original \\"magical fiction\\" novel better than H.P.

B000EYK4GW|5.0|Despite what I've said about previous films I've reviewed (\\"Mamma Mia!\\", \\"The Dark Knight\\", \\"Mighty Morphin Power Rangers\\" etc.), this is my all time favorite movie. This is Walt Disney at his best. The story is simple and it is short at 64 minutes, but it delivers the story quickly so it doesn't plod along like some other Disney films. The characters are entertaining, especially Timothy Mouse for helping our young, speechless hero. Dumbo is one of the cutest animated characters and struggles throughout the movie because of his \\"deformity\\". The animation is outstanding, especially the Pink Elephants sequence and the sequence when the elephants stand on the ball and then the circus is destroyed. The songs fit well into the plot of the film and aren't shoehorned in. The most tearful/touching scenes are when Dumbo is with his mother, the \\"Baby Mine\\" sequence imparticular. Now, I'm going to go on a little rant here and it especially goes out all of the NARROW-MINDED and IGNORANT people who have given this gem of a movie a bad review. This movie and its portrayal of the crows are not racist, I mean, I'm sorry if crows are black, but you need to talk to the Big Guy Upstairs about that one. And even if they unintentionally were and you don't want your kid exposed to it, then you are raising them to be oblivious to a human condition that, unfortunately, will exist until the end of days. Its unfortunate that this and \\"Song of the South\\" are labled as racist films along with the great \\"Looney Tunes\\" and \\"Tom and Jerry\\" cartoons. They shouldn't have to address to people that these are products of the time and apologize that some people may be offended. We shouldn't have to be so PC all the time. It restricts creativity. Look at the Steve Martin remake of \\"The Pink Panther\\" and then look at the originals with Sellers (yes even the three made after his death). The Clouseau character had a greater dynamic and foil with Chinese manservant Cato than with Ponton (it was good but not like what he had with Cato). The character was supposed to be in the remake but the producers changed their mind because it might offend some people, despite the character being associated with the films. Even the \\"Super Friends\\" of the '70s/'80s. They try to put their best foot foward by including different races and all people do now is criticize them for being racist. When the Darkseid character was introduced in the '80s cartoons, the heads at ABC tried to change the name to \\"DarkSIDE\\" because the original spelling might offend their German viewers despite that's how the character's name is spelled in the comics and in the more PC era of the '90s with the Bruce Timm Superman animated series. If these remarks are going to garner a lot of negative comments for me, then so be it because these are my views.like what he had with Cato).

Great Edge of your seat Thriller, Involving a Former spy, and Showing that torture for the interest of Public safety in a official form*In  this case a CIA Agent*( I do not Condone) is NOT BAD, But A Preventive Measure, Of course the movie has nothing to do with Torture per se, but There are parts of torture of course he does this to find his daughter. Who lied about where she was going, and her naive mom let her be. All lessons and social commentary aside, Excellent movie, especially for SpyMovie Buffs and Action Packed Movie Fans.

B001U0HBPG|5.0|I never, ever shed more tears over any movie I have ever seen than this one.  It was truly a wonderful triumph and depressing tragedy rolled into one.  I cannot believe how Brad Pitt always continues to evolve as an actor, even though I don't think he's the strongest actor out there ( and admittingly his perfect good looks get in the way and tend to cloud their judgement of him as an actor, and a vastly underrated one at that ) but this movie was excellent but it did have a familiar Forrest Gump feel to it, but I felt that the love story between Benjamin and Daisy was what gave the movie the quasi- Forrest/ Jenny treatment.  The rest was just sheer joyful agony, Imagine that... what if we were born old only to die young, with the personality and emotional changes reversed just like everything else.  I can honestly, wholeheartedly say one thing:  for those of you who fear death, which I know everybody and every living creature that has a soul on this planet does, this wonderful film should be required viewing so we can feel good about getting old and just enjoy our lives as they were meant to be lived by us, and we should just be happy in our skin.  I WILL NEVER, EVER forget this movie and especially Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett in the starring roles.  This movie will be on the silver screen in my mind when I'm 80 and have lived a full life, and I hope closing my eyes for the last time will be just like when I opened them for the first time.  It didn't make me depressed, it actually gave me hope.

B000ULQV0W|5.0|This is one of the most beautiful albums of music I have ever heard. Stripped down and bare, the words and music touch my soul. I lived under a rock (raising children) during the 90s,so I have not heard a lot of  Pearl Jam. Now I'll be approaching them using Eddie Vedder's solo work as a reference point. Don't know how it could get better than this.

B001MYIXAW|5.0|Wife and Young Son brought this home from the rental store a few nights ago. I had no idea what to expect, but was told that Older Son recommended the movie. That's always a hit-and-miss proposition, because his tastes in movies runs a little different than mine. However, this time, he was right.<br /><br />This is not your standard vampire flick with a clutch of monsters running around butchering the countryside. The story is far more subtle and provides a unique perspective on the vampire myth. Patience is required, especially if you're expecting a typical Hollywood vampire flick.<br /><br />I watched the dubbed version and would recommend a subtitled version (it seems a new subtitled release is expected) because I really prefer hearing the original actor's voices. I don't speak the original language, so I can't attest on the quality of the dubbing (or the translation), but even with the dubbed version I \\"got\\" the story.<br /><br />If you're patient with the movie, the story will reward your patience. I'll get my hands on a copy of the subtitled version and watch it again. It's worth a second viewing.
B00008PC2O|5.0|this is one of my favorite movies of all time not just action. This movie is just action packed and is just fun from start to finish. I have seen this movie so many times and i still have not gotten tired of it. Terminator 2 has already been released on dvd and i have to say that if you are a huge terminator fan you should buy the first one that came out it has so much detail and information about the making of the movie that it will blow you away. This re-release is okay i guess it has a couple more special features that are worth a watch. But the real reason that this dvd was released again was for the sound and picture improvements. Let me warm you that you should have a fancy home theater to notice these improvements or else you wont really notice a change in picture or sound. But regardless this is still terminator 2 and regardless what version you nuy you wont be dissapointed.
B001W6S0C6|4.0|This is one of my favortie movies of all time so of course, i had to get it!  Blu-ray quality was pretty sweet even for a film as old as this one; digital copy is always nice to have for the computer at work.  The only thing that i was kind of upset about was that there was no deleted scenes which i always like to watch.  Overall it was a good purchase and you cant beat a brand new special edition blu-ray for $19.99!
B001R0KH3M|5.0|Bought the DVD last week and absolutely love it! Have read all the other reviews and the participation from the audience not a problem for me. Stevie also sounds the same from 30+ years ago...unlike other singers who are bad LIVE in concert as the magic of recording studios make them sound good. Enjoyed the first half of the DVD...but the best part comes after Aisha Morris' (his daughter) song \\"I'm Gonna Laugh You Right Out Of My Life\\" and has her Dad's singing genes. I played \\"Songs In The Key Of Life\\" every day for years when it came out so am partial to those songs...especially my favorite \\"As\\"...which he sings in the second half of the DVD but wish a little bit longer version. Buy the DVD for his early and/or later songs as all are awesome!
0634022296|4.0|I have had the original \\"Beatles Complete\\" for years and was used to transposing the chords to a playable or singable key, or at least the key that followed the chords on the Beatles recordings. This book is already in the key you expect it in but it does not have music, just words and guitar chords. If you know how the song should sound and just need the words and chords, this is the book you want. Most of the songs are one page with guitar chords above the words, just like you would do it long hand. Not much help for someone who reads music but what guitar player does that on stage. This is also a fun book to have for sing-alongs around the campfire. Our keyboard player reads music and likes to look at the old book to get some of the patterns down and than transposes it to the key in the new book, so you may benefit by having both versions.  If all you want to do is strum and sing, this is the one you want.
B000P0J09C|4.0|A movie in two parts: boot camp with a finish that was maybe wanted<br />by every one with a tough DI and a TET offensive<br />close up of Marines beating back the NVA.<br />A Viet Nam  woman sniper kills three of the patrol<br />and writer gets<br />blood on his camera.<br />The irony of soldiers who will be using full automatic M16's<br />in battle using the M14 to train still kind of sticks with me;<br />the enemy used AK47 that could penetrate light armor and buildings.<br />This movie makes a point about the American empire with volunteer soldiers killing because they love it.<br />After Iraq we get the feeling nobody got the point?
B0026OE2NY|5.0|One may not agree with the theory of evolution, but that should not be the reason for not watching/buying this DVD.   This film is about man's greed and the results.   We must become stewards of our planet or face the fact that our children or grandchildren may likely suffer unthinkable changes to our (American)wealthy way of life.   This film shows what has already happened in my lifetime of 60 years, and has certainly awakened my family to our responsibility to care for our home.   The photography is absolutely exquisite, the music haunting, and the narrative poetic.
0307269752|4.0|Bought this last year but hadn't got around to reading it yet. The second part is just out so decided to give it a go & wasn't dissapointed.<br /><br />Won't go into the plot here but wil say that after a slow start the main mystery really gets going & is edge of seat stuff for most of the book. Seems to be resolved early but Larsson then ties up the character Blomkvists second plot regarding his investigation into a corrupt industrialist.<br /><br />Shame Larsson passed away before he could see how well his books have been received. This thoroughly deserves all the praise it has had.<br /><br />Now have Part Two waiting to be read & believe me it will not stay unread for long.
B0026OE2NY|1.0|The beginning of the theatrical trailer immediately tells you this is a production based on evolution.  \\"Life, a miracle that began around 4 billion years ago\\" is how this production starts.  No thank you.  The filming may be breath taking but it is not worth the scripting.  Planet Earth is better quality and they do a wonderful job at keeping to the facts, not fiction.
1416594884|5.0|Having read several reviews, I decided to listen to this book despite them.  Its audible rendition is superbly well done, and I am glad to have heard it rather than read it because the \\"reading\\" is really a finely done dramatization.  And the novel itself is very fine indeed.    In a way what this book does is to blow up at its end.  It is something like the literary equivalent of a suicidal bombing, and the audience's sensibilities are the target, especially if American.  The experience of the end in turn changes the way one regards the foregoing narrative.  All of the seemingly tedious (but beautifully rendered) narration serves retrospectively to construct the consciousness of a devout if uninstructed believer in Islam: a consciousness doomed on account of its categorical mentality that constructs reality in a morally admirable, but intellectually limited way.  And then there are all those representatives of European spy agencies, continental and British, and their eventually nuanced points of views that illuminate how very morally ambiguous is the \\"war of terror\\" on both sides.  But they in turn are as impotent in their nuanced vision as is the moral purity of the believer.  In the end what triumphs is the self-righteousness of the most powerful, and it is horribly ugly, and it is American.  The book left me at first feeling sickened, then very sad; and upon reflection I am sad that the quality of the U.S. has been so diminished by its response to terror.  I assume le Carre aimed for such a reader response.  A great book, by a very great writer.
B001FB55HG|2.0|There is a lot wrong with \\"Terminator Salvation\\". So much in fact that it may turn out to be one of the most disappointing films of Summer 2009.<br /><br />If you take a look at the posters or promotional materials for the film you will notice two names listed above the title. The first is Christian Bale who plays John Connor. The film is set in 2018, just after Judgement Day and a ragtag group of humans are fighting to stay alive and battle SkyNet and their terminators. The second is Sam Worthington. Sam who? In Present Day, he plays Marcus a condemned criminal who wills his body for scientific experiments. When he wakes up, it is 2018 and the world is a very different place. \\"Terminator Salvation\\" basically tells two different stories; the story of John Connor and his fight to get to SkyNet and stop them from taking a lot of humans in for experiments and the story of Marcus as he quickly realizes he is in a different time and place and needs to try to save some innocent humans from these vicious machines. He eventually meets a young man named Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin, \\"Star Trek\\", \\"Alpha Dog\\") and tries to keep him alive. Eventually, late in the film, the two stories mesh. But at this point, it's too late and the two separate stories, the two separate characters seem forced together.<br /><br />This is not one of Christian Bale's best performances. He is so lifeless, so lacking of emotion that I wonder what he was trying to do with his portrayal of John Connor. Yes, I realize the world is a very difficult place and Connor has a lot of weight on his shoulders, but he never seems to be far from a grimace or a scowl. He is a determined man, but he never shows an emotion except for anger so we don't get a lot of feeling for who his character is. I found most of my emotion for this character came from my memories of John Connor in the second film. Because of this, it is difficult to care for him.<br /><br />At one point, he listens to a series of tapes his mother left him. This is interesting, but we immediately sense he has heard these tapes many times before and is merely trying to scan through them, trying to find information about the events unfolding before him. He simply states, \\"She doesn't make any mention of it.\\" So what is the point of this sequence to begin with? And it doesn't reveal any emotion for his character. He doesn't seem effected in the slightest by the thought of hearing his mom's voice again. No, John Connor doesn't have time for emotion. He has to keep moving. He has to keep working towards the goal.<br /><br />John is also very gung ho to do just about anything. He knows his destiny and doesn't hesitate to volunteer for any mission, no matter how dangerous. But because there is never any hesitation, there is never any doubt and there is never any suspense. Unfortunately, the character doesn't work and as he is the centerpiece of the story, the film doesn't work.<br /><br />Sam Worthington is more interesting but only because he is more confused. He basically wakes up in 2018. After he quickly realizes what is going on, and sees some evidence of what is going on, he realizes what he needs to do. In a way, this is also attributed to atonement for his previous life as a murderer. As soon as he realizes the humans are battling for their lives, he starts to help them and finds a group of people hiding out. One of these people is Kyle Reese.<br /><br />I think McG, the director of this \\"Terminator\\" reboot, thinks merely mentioning the character makes him interesting and compelling. When we see a young Kyle Reese, played by Anton Yelchin, our interest is piqued, but the film has to work to maintain this interest. The filmmaker gets a temporary pass because he is able to work the character into the new film, but he has to work to earn this pass or we take it away. I don't think Reese has more than two lines in the entire film and most of the time, we only see him in the distance, as whatever vehicle he is imprisoned in takes off, dozens of other people crowded in around him.<br /><br />There are many questions left unanswered in \\"Salvation\\". Why does Marcus go to such great lengths to protect Reese? How does he even now of the young man's importance? Or is he simply protecting him because he is protecting as many humans as he can? These questions and many others are left to our imagination, or perhaps they will be answered in the planned sequel.<br /><br />McG went to a lot of trouble to convince Christina Bale to appear in the film. \\"Take a chance on me\\" is a quote I read in one story about the film and it's director. Bale may have been better served to deny the filmmaker. McG, who previously directed \\"Charlie's Angels\\" and its less interesting sequel, and is the producer on many television projects, (including \\"Prison Break\\" and the underrated \\"Chuck\\") is simply not the right director for the job. Sure, he loves the whiz-bang action scenes and loves playing with his toy box full of special effects, but all of his attention is spent on these areas. For an action film to be memorable, we have to care about the characters. We have to give two hoots about what happens to them. Somehow, the filmmakers have to make us feel for the characters. When we feel for them, we care about whether they make it through or not. When this happens, the film becomes suspenseful. Without it, we are merely watching a lot of stuff blow up on screen.<br /><br />McG really does nothing with the John Connor character except to move the focus away from him for a good portion of the film. When we do spend time with Connor, we see a woman (Bryce Dallas Howard, \\"The Village\\"&lt; \\"Lady in the Water\\") approach him and try to comfort him. Is she his wife? His partner? Don't know and since McG doesn't seem to care, I can't either. There is a scene much later in the film when a group of people is about to be killed. They know they are about to be killed. They don't seem to care that they are going to be killed. When they are killed? Nothing because we don't care for them. At all. We aren't given the time or the information to care about them. I think McG feels that the mere mention of Kyle Reese's name will be enough to carry the character because that is basically all that happens to him. Jane Alexander plays a survivor who seems to be the matriarch for a small group of humans. But she literally has five minutes of screen time before she pops up in a few crowd scenes later in the film. It seems like a waste of character and a great actress.<br /><br />A lot of time and attention (relatively anyway) is spent on developing Marcus' character and making him a part of the mythology. I really think McG wanted to put his stamp on the story and add his own creation to the film. Marcus is the most interesting character in the film and Worthington brings a quiet, Clint Eastwood like quality to the role, but really all this does is divert our attention away from Connor, who should be the focus of the story.<br /><br />McG would be well served to turn to James Cameron for his inspiration. Not the \\"Terminator\\" films Cameron directed, although they are far superior to this new entry, but to how Cameron put his stamp on \\"Aliens\\". \\"Alien\\", directed by Ridley Scott, is a scary, haunted house-on-a-spaceship story. For the sequel, Cameron was called in. Rather than simply recreate the original, he took three elements from the first film; Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), the Alien and a dark, wet spaceship floating through outer space. But he added to each of these. He gave Ripley a shell of toughness, which we didn't necessarily know she had before, and a maternal instinct that made her more interesting and vulnerable. He gave the Alien a maternal instinct as well, amping the danger level by making more Aliens. And he made the spaceship larger and more cavernous. He also added a ragtag group of mercenaries sent to the ship to help Ripley fight these aliens. The result? A film that is at least the equal of the original. McG takes various elements from the previous films, but doesn't do anything with them. The result? A film that is better than \\"Terminator 3\\", but just.<br /><br />Ultimately, \\"Terminator Salvation\\" just seems like a pointless waste of time and film. Thankfully, Bale has one more Batman film to do.We aren't given the time or the information to care about them.

B00169N0BK|4.0|I just purchased the Color Munki.  I installed it without any errors.  I then checked for upgrades and installed it as well.  I went thru the processes as stated in the instructions.  I had no problem with scanning  the test charts.  I did have a problem when calibrating my monitor it asked me to adjust the brightness levels but I could not figure out how to lower the bright levels on my monitor so I continued.  Once I got to the end my monitor looked horrible.  Even though I printed out a picture using the print profiles generated my the color munki the picture looked great but my monitor looked over blown with contrast and brightness.  So I went thru the processes again and this time I was able to adjust the bright levels on my monitor and the final results were outstanding.  I printed out several pictures and much to my amazement they looked just like the monitor.  As of now I'm very pleased with the operation of the color munki.  I would recommend this to anyone who takes pride in getting the picture right the first time.
1853260339|5.0|Read: 6/09, 8/10, 7/12<br />Rate: 5/5<br /><br />6/09: Adventures of Sherlock Holmes is the third book of the series, consisting of twelve sensational cases. Actually, I find two of these cases (The Red-Headed League and A Case of Identity) to be quite simplistic that I am surprised at Dr. Watson for not making a good educated guess from the outset. It is that moment in each case that I began to suspect of Dr. Watson's intelligence. Once again, in each of the cases, the story is thrilling, and the writing of Arthur Conan Doyle is beautiful. However, each of the progressing case has a distinctively formulaic feel: some small talk or business from either or both of the main characters, a random character appears with a shocking tale, Sherlock's tendency to say, \\"It's the most interesting case I've heard in months,\\" the campaign of sleuthing without knowing the full details, the apprehension, and finally the details of how the mystery was solved with extra analysis from Sherlock. I won't say that the formulaic feel of each case is increasingly tired but rather, I had hoped the author would just mix things up a little bit. Meanwhile, in the case The Adventure of the Speckled Band, when Sherlock Holmes identified the creature as the Swamp Adder, there is no such thing as one although I thought it was a cobra based on the description of its distinctive head. All in all, Adventures of Sherlock Holmes is a can't-miss and easily beats out possibly all of the mystery books in existence.<br /><br />8/10: Sir Arthur Conan Doyle presents twelve exciting stories in Adventures of Sherlock Holmes that will have all fans of the legendary detective enthralled. Every one of the cases is unique in its own way, and in one of them, Sherlock Holmes is beaten by a woman. In two cases that a reader can really solve by easily creating a valid theory after reading the facts of the case, one must question Dr. Watson's intelligence because he should have also done the same thing. In a third case, one can really solve it quicker than Sherlock Holmes can due to a connection in the previous case described in A Case of Identity, and he readily admits that, \\"I think, Watson, that you are now standing in the presence of one of the most absolute fools in Europe. I deserve to be kicked from here to Charing Cross.\\" However, Sherlock Holmes is a genius, and every word about the cases is thrilling to read and a pleasure. All in all, Adventures of Sherlock Holmes is a can't put down.<br /><br />7/12: While not as thrilling as The Sign of Four, Adventures of Sherlock Holmes does have staying power just like the first two stories. Arthur Conan Doyle's writing steadily improves, and the stories are as refined as ever. Several of them are quite easy to figure out, but I can't believe John Watson is incompetent. Sherlock Holmes must have a good deal of patience with him. The easiest mystery for the reader is The Man with the Twisted Lip which caused Sherlock to exclaim that he is \\"one of the most absolute fools in Europe\\" and should be kicked \\"from here to Charing Cross.\\" At least he is correct when he says, \\"Crime is common. Logic is rare.\\" That's where he makes a name for himself, and the stories are replete of it. All in all, the readers will learn a lot from Adventures of Sherlock Holmes if they take the time to sit down with it. \\"Data! Data! Data!

B0026LYM5U|3.0|Here it is at last. The highly anticipated new cd from The Gathering!   No doubt this new release was very important for the band to prove they can carry on just fine without their former singer. Did they succeed?    Well, to be honest, yes and no. Overall I find this to be an \\"okay\\" album. The new singer is proficient enough, but lacks a little in comparison to the former The Gathering singer Anneke (which is understandable given how great Anneke is).    There are some really nice songs on here that I find to be moving and fairly solid. This is a little more guitar driven than the last cd \\"Home\\", but by no means is it very heavy at all. The songs seem like a natural progression from \\"Home\\" and if you liked that last album you'll find something to like on The West Pole also.     But there are several songs on here that to me seem boring and uninspired. Almost like they didn't really know what direction to take some of the songs, so they just kind of dragged them out in a repetitive way. It's difficult for me to find a strong desire to restart the cd again unless for the reason of seeing if I can try to like it more. Perhaps with more time it will grow on me some.    My personal hunch is that their former singer Anneke also contributed her own ideas and parts to the song making process on previous Gathering albums. Whereas this time, the band was left to do it all on their own without Anneke's help, and then just have the new singer sing the parts assigned to her. So they lost a strong creative force in the band and I think it shows.    By no means is this a \\"bad\\" album. It's good, just not great, and to me doesn't feel very much inspired. Still, if your a long time fan of The Gathering like me and want their new works then feel free to get it. You'll for sure enjoy 3-4 of the songs on here, maybe more.

0061854549|4.0|Did you ever stop to think why your behavior can be so doggone irrational at times? Perhaps you are someone who walks into a fast food joint and orders a bacon double-cheeseburger, large fries and a Diet Coke. Now does that make any sense at all? Do you regret that recent purchase when a salesperson managed to talk you into a product that was much bigger and had many more features than you wanted or needed? Do you have drawers full of so-called \\"free\\" stuff at home that you never even use? You are not alone! It would appear that it is really inconsequential whether you are young or old, rich or poor, a high school drop-out or an individual with an advanced degree. According to author Dan Ariely we are all highly susceptible to this kind of irrational behavior. Furthermore, manufacturers and retailers are well aware of these tendencies among their customers and have developed rather sophisticated techniques to take full advantage of them. In his new book \\"Predictably Irrational: The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions\\" Ariely seeks to arm his readers with useful information and observations that will help us to understand the forces that are in play here and to ultimately make much better decisions. It is an intriguing subject.<br />Throughout the pages of \\"Predictably Irrational\\" Ariely, a behavioral economist at MIT, discusses a number of fascinating experiments that he and his colleagues conducted in preparation for this book. You will discover that the decisions we make can easily be manipulated by the choices we are presented with. And although it makes absolutely no sense at all you will see why the more expensive brand name drug will usually make us feel better faster than its generic equivalent. Ariely also presents some fascinating experiments on the subject of honesty. Discover why people tend to be appreciably more honest in transactions where cash is involved. Terrific stuff! Towards the end of the book Ariely spotlights an interesting experiment he conducted involving a group of people ordering food and beverages at a restaurant. It is stunning when you realize just how much the mere presence of other people can influence what you decide to order!<br />I found the newly revised and expanded \\"Predictably Irrational: The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions\\" to be a particularly engaging and well-written book. I came away feeling that I had a much better understanding of human nature. Armed with the knowledge I gained here I am much less likely to be tripped up in future transactions. I wish I had read this book before my wife and I purchased a vehicle a few months ago! It might have saved us several thousand dollars! Highly recommended!cted involving a group of people ordering food and beverages at a restaurant.

B001EBC8U4|3.0|At the start of this book--which is mainly epistolary in form--I had some difficulty in sorting out what was happening, who the writers of the letters were, and what were their relationships. Then,I must say,I got drawn into the book and was reluctant to put it down. But as I reached the last quarter of the book, I felt the plot incidents were overly contrived, leading up to a conclusion that any reader could see coming a mile away.<br />There is a lot of charm,humor,and interest in the book, which is essentially about the German occupation of the Island of Guernsey during the Second World War: but the letters--from a variety of sources, including a group of Guernsey residents--also contain much interesting anecdotal references to great figures of literature (Charles Lamb in particular). The letters also build up, from various angles, a central theme, which is about Elizabeth, who has a child by a German military doctor during the occupation--and her story is very compelling.<br />But then we move into odd plot contrivances as the principal character (an English writer--Juliet) arrives in Guernsey to meet those residents who have been corresponding with her--the members of the Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Society. And the book goes downhill from about that point, especially in the final pages when the epistolary form is abandoned in favor of a narrative by one of the nuttier members of the Society.<br />It is touching and quite moving in parts, and the anecdotes of the German occupation illuminate much about the good and the bad of human nature. I also feel the author(s) have captured the tenor of the times immediately after WW2, the date when the book is set, and the language seems to me to reflect very well the style of letter-writing at that time--high marks for that. I would give the book three stars. I am not sure it really deserves to be at the top of the New York Times best-seller list--I would guess that shows its appeal to women, who I understand are the big novel buyers.<br />But you should read it...see what you think.buyers.

B001U0HBPG|3.0|After watching this excessively long 2 hr and 46 minutes movie, I realized it was a cross between the movies \\"Meet Joe Black\\" and \\"Forrest Gump\\".  Meet joe black also was a long movie and the dialogue was a bit tideous at times as was the case in Benjamin Button, not including the fact that both movies starred Pitt.  As for the \\"forrest gump\\", both Benjamin and Forrest have an unusual aspect or trait to themselves and they love a woman who goes in and out of their lives.  Overall, Benjamin Button is an okay movie, just not as good as it was touted to be.  if you plan to watch it, get comfortable as it is long.
0307408833|2.0|Received book, very excited to try recipes.  Disappointed about all of the recipes with gluten in them, but decided to try the cupcakes and see what all of the hype was about.  I spent large amount of time this afternoon gathering all of the ingredients at Whole Foods and other grocery store.  Spent more money than I've ever spent for baking a simple dessert, too.  I should have followed my intuition about the flour because all of the \\"bean flours\\" I've tried in the past taste horrendous, but since the author recommended the recipes be followed closely and precisely, I did as she suggested.  Anyone who wants to taste decent cupcakes, PLEASE do not use the bean flours.  They are just disgusting.  The kids were disappointed, not even able to get more than two bites down.  The frosting turned out worse.<br /><br />Good advice for anyone wanting to bake gluten free:  Order \\"Authentic Foods Brown Rice Flour\\" found in California.  It is worth the cost and it is not grainy like other rice flours and bakes up into fantastic cakes and other desserts .  Also, very important---Buy Annalise Roberts' book entitled \\"Gluten Free Baking Classics.\\"  It is the VERY BEST for delicious baked goods!  Use the flour combinations she recommends (almost exclusively from Authentic Foods) and you will love dessert again.  I'm going to try to use her cake recipes and use them in my cupcake molds for something we can actually enjoy and abandon the BabyCakes recipe.  Authentic Foods also has some good recipes to consider o their website.  I really wanted to love eating the \\"healthy\\" Babycakes recipes as much as I loved looking at the photos in the cookbook, but this has been a big turn off and a waste of my money.

As in real life, when we take the time to write letters to our friends and family, our humanness comes through.  Such is the case with these characters as well.  As a reader, we are privy to their fears, hopes, quirks, and most delightfully, their sometimes cattiness.<br /><br />I am an early riser, not a night owl, but for this book, I made the exception, and stayed up well past my bedtime!

B001K3JF7K|2.0|First, I think DK is fantastically gifted. I adore her voice, and love, love, love her piano playing. Heck, I even like her husband. But this is a boring, drowse-inducing sham of an album.<br /><br />Diana Krall has the right to do whatever the heck she wants with her career - anyone who recorded the \\"All for you\\" CD has a lifetime pass! But, she has gradually been losing me over the past few albums. Like another reviewer, I was excited to score tickets for the tour this summer but am now wishing I hadn't bothered.<br /><br />Almost every song on this album has the same polished, laid-back feel. Unfortunately, they're all the same tempo, and the melodies are barely distinguishable from one another. There is little evidence of the exciting ingenue that gave us All for you, Love Scenes, Stepping out etc. I get that it can get old recording Gershin standards, and based on \\"The girl in the other room\\" I don't think DK's writing is as good as her playing and singing. But this is lazy, unimaginative, and bland. If this CD was an Old Testament church, I think God would spit it out for being neither hot nor cold.<br /><br />I can't help wondering if she's just taking the easy way out. There's so little for her to do musically that this must be a much easier record to make for DK than the discs of old that showed off her abilities.<br /><br />If any of the Verve folks are reading these reviews, please don't ignore them!

B001FB55HG|4.0|\\"Terminator Salvation\\" is the latest film in the famous science fiction series launched by famous director James Cameron and his then-wife, producer Gail-Anne Hurd. This is the third sequel, and a worthy successor to the original film. The films depict a future where machines have become self-aware and have almost completely annihilated mankind, except for a scattered band of humans known as the Resistance.<br /><br />This version takes place in 2018, and John Connor, one of the primary leaders of the resistance, is trying to find Kyle Reese, the then-teenager who will grow up to be his father (if you are confused, you'll need to see the first film). The movie brings together Connor (played by Christian Bale), Reese (plated by Anton Yelchin), Reese's pint-size ward, Star (Jadagrace Berry), Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington), a convicted murder in the present day who finds himself on the run from the machines, and Blair Williams (Moon Bloodgood), a Resistance pilot rescued by Marcus.<br /><br />The action is intense and at times, relentless, but it doesn't detract from an interesting story that questions how difficult it could be to maintain one's humanity while at war with non-human enemies. The film is enjoyable and doesn't take away from a series that has produced some of the most entertaining and thought-provoking science fiction films in motion-picture history.
B001EYU1VO|2.0|The left half of the hat switch and the right side thumb buttons failed during usage. I've had this joystick for approx. 4 months.    edit: the next day i decided to tinker with my stick. the first thing i did was clean the contacts where the stick disessembles and now the buttons are working again.    i would rerate this joystick a 3/5 because of the wobble in the pitch.
B001QWBM62|5.0|Bought this a few weeks ago, just before a live gig I was going to play. It was a little confusing figuring out the manual, but once I did, I was pleasantly surprised at how easy the H4n was to use. I recorded some of our practice the night before. I really liked having the automatic volume control & the ease of starting & stopping the recording. Runs on AA batteries with stamina mode too or with the provided power supply. Other great extras are case, mike stand adapter, windshield & usb cable. I set the H4n up in front of the band at our gig & WOW! The recording was superior to a $1000 dollar Yamaha I'd been working with before. No mikes to set up with the Zoom (even though you can plug in extra mikes with phantom power too). I just turned the recorder on & got a great recording. The only thing I didn't like so far is that no recording (file), can be over 2GB, that translates to less recording time in WAV format, but it's really no big deal, you just have to stop & start more with the bigger WAV files. Even though the H4n comes with a 1GB SD card, using WAV format is better quality sound which also means much bigger files & versatility. You can still get tons of recording time with the 1GB card using MP3 format, great for practice. Definitely get a bigger SD, you will be using this thing all the time! I got a 16GB card, just make sure it is a SDHC card, most of them are anyway these days. You can over dub & there are some neat effects too (haven't used 'em all yet). You will not regret buying this recorder, so go out there & get one & make some great music!
B000FC1K66|2.0|The premise of the book is quite good and seemed to hold so much promise.  But the author fails to develop the characters or the core ideas beyond the superficial.  The main character raises a few questions about the generational guilt of Nazi collaboration, but never really moves past the question of \\"what would you have done?\\" - other than to state that it makes everyone uncomfortable.  Certainly the author could have spent several chapters grappling with this either through internal monologue or by introducing additional characters that the narrator interacted with. The father character is so under developed I was left wondering why he was introduced into the novel at all.  His only purpose was to drive a brief chapter moralizing on whether one should intercede on behalf of someone whom you feel is acting against their own interests.  Even this exchange is all to brief and doesn't move beyond a superficial raising of the issues.  Its followed later on with a comment on the narrators painful relationship with his father - again another potential vehicle for developing the main character that goes undeveloped.    I'd be interested to read the original German to see if it was the English translation that was at fault, or the author's own writing style at fault.  Given that most of the problems I have with the book revolve around undeveloped and explored ideas, I'd have to lay it at the feet of the author not the translator.
B001QOOCTE|5.0|Absolutely wonderful! Great songs, great artists, great recording, great video! I just wish that there were more videos.
B000286RNY|5.0|Before you watch this movie, here are two things you'll need:<br /><br />1) A Sense of humor.  We know the clich&eacute;, \\"Everybody's a comedian\\", but if you're someone who doesn't feel like humor surrounds you every where you go every day, you most likely don't have the sense of humor required to appreciate the humor of this flick.<br /><br />B) The ability to read.  DO NOT watch the U.S. version.  It really doesn't do the movie justice.  The translation of the subtitles aren't great, but it is a waaay better movie.<br /><br />Got those two checked? Then enjoy the movie with a loved one or a kidnapping victim (for you serial killers out there).
B001L5SXQG|1.0|What happened to the Springsteen I know? You know back at the Music Barn in Leneox, Mass in the 1970's. That's when you were wild and crazy and GOOD! This new album is way too orchestrated and the vocals are too strained. \\"Bruce\\" is tired and his voice seems to be shot. Unless you can be creative and write and sing some more real Springsteen tunes, it's time to call it a day my man and go home to retirement. I know you hate that word, but it's the truth. Back to your roots man! All the songs sound the same from Bruce these days. What ever happened to Jungleland type tunes and Sandy? They were original and worthwhile. Now this folky crap! YuK! Go back to the motorcycles and Jersey scene. That's where you belong dude. No more of this get rich, top 40 crap please.
0525478183|5.0|The book was in excellent condition and it arrived right on time. I have no complaints. Great book for a great price.
B00005R8FI|5.0|There is only one album like this ever recorded. It is totally unique. I have explored records and musicians. I have talked to the most knowledgeable music people I can find. They agree, it is a great album and there is no other album like it. When ever I am asked to name some of my favorite albums this is always the first on the list.<br />The sound is a blend of string and wind instruments without drums. Each song offers something different in sound and flavor. Other reviews already spell out all the specifics of who is playing and what they do, so I won't be redundent. If you like to listen to great live moments in musical history then you need to add this to your collection and no collection of Rock, Blues or Jazz is complete until this album is added to said collection.
B0015D3Z4O|1.0|Madonna, age 51, is an elderly woman now. So, why does she keep trying to be some young foxy babe that all the guys want to date? She actually thinks men are out there just dying for her wonderful body. Think again Madonna! \\"Hard Candy\\" is her typical stuff. All the songs sound alike and phony. She's really a dancer not a good singer. She struts her older woman stuff around the stage like she's hot! No way man! Yuk! She's sagging and yesterdays news. It's like this adoption thing with her. Go home lady cause you're washed up. Start acting like a grandma or something more your age and leave the singing and sexy babe stuff to the younger female singers who can actually sing!The picture of her on the album is gross! It's porn Madonna, not music! Hang it up!
B001PJRAUS|5.0|I love this movie.  I've watched it again and again.  Elliot Cowan is perfect as Mr. Darcy and Jemima Rooper is a riot.  I definately recommend it.
0956010903|5.0|I preordered this item the day it was announced because it was right up my alley:  I love Harry Potter and collector's or limited editions of things I'm into.  That said, I only own the hardcover editions of all the Harry Potter books.  None of those limited editions seemed special enough for me to buy.  For some reason this caught my eye as something special indeed.  I think it was the design, along with the facts that there were only 7 originals in existence, and only 100,000 of these limited collector's editions were to be produced worldwide.  I was fine with the $100 price tag.  I understood.  But like the dork I can be sometimes, I canceled my preorder.    I regretted it almost immediately, as it was quickly sold out.  I knew there was always the secondary market.  Prices were and still are ranging from the ridiculous to reasonable.  Time went by, and I forgot about it until a week ago.  I checked out the secondary market and snagged one for $109.95.  Mint condition, still shrink wrapped for only $9.95 more than the original price plus FREE shipping!  I was very happy and didn't care at all about the original \\"Muggle warning\\" box, although I think that was a nice touch.  But for those whose gift giving surprise it ruined, I understand completely.    I waited with anticipation for the delivery.  Meanwhile I checked out all the customer uploaded pictures here (many times), which only added to the anticipation.  I read through most of the reviews.  Some gave me worry because they complained about the content and/or quality of this item.      Well, it arrived today, and I was honestly blown away with it.  I have to say it is my favorite collectible I own.  It is so very beautiful and unique.  It just feels and looks so well made.  There were complaints by some that it looks cheap in person, and the workmanship is shoddy.  This is not the case with the one I got today!  As for the content, I love it too.  The five fairy tales or fables are suited to the world of Harry Potter and Dumbledore's analyses of them are interesting.  It is indeed a relic pulled from a novel.  Nothing more, nothing less.
B000H5U832|5.0|Bought this for the grandkids, but we all love it.  Have seen it many times and still enjoy it.
B001UREJWM|4.0|I could write a novel about my longtime love of Black Sabbath, but I'll just say this: I loved the Ozzy era, but I also loved the Dio era just as much (I never saw a reason to pick between the two - they're both legendary). Everyone knows about \\"Heaven and Hell\\", but I've always thought \\"Mob Rules\\" and especially \\"Dehumanizer\\" were highly underrated albums. Needless to say I was very excited to hear that the Mob Rules lineup was reuniting and, better yet, recording a new studio album.<br /><br />I had to wait awhile before posting my review because I wanted to know this album very well rather than just posting another \\"It's Black Sabbath so it rules and I'm giving it 5 stars\\" fanboy review. Now that I've spent enough quality time with it, I can say that it definitely earns its place among the rest of the Dio-era Sabbath catalogue. It did take awhile to \\"click\\" with me, but once it did, it was worth the wait. RJD's voice has held up very well (as anyone who saw the last tour or has the DVD can attest). He more than carries his share of the weight here. Vinny is Vinny, solid but unspectacular. And Tony has come up with some good riffs once again, but I think Geezer stands out the most on this album. His bass work is phenomenal (as always), and he still sounds like he could play another 30 years.<br /><br />At first, the two songs that jumped out at me were \\"Bible Black\\" and  \\"Follow the Tears\\", which are probably the most sinister tunes on this album, and thus became my instant favorites. Other songs that took a bit more time to grow on me were \\"Atom and Evil\\", \\"Fear\\", \\"Double the Pain\\", \\"Breaking into Heaven\\" and especially \\"Rock and Roll Angel\\". These are all excellent tracks, with melodies that will be in my head for a long time. I've read a few complaints about \\"Rock and Roll Angel\\", but I think it's a great tune, and it's definitely the most ambitious song here. The only songs that I just haven't been able to get into so far are \\"Turn of the Screw\\", and the two faster paced tracks \\"Eating the Cannibals\\" and \\"Neverwhere\\", which sound like they were thrown in just for the sake of speeding things up. I'll take \\"TV Crime\\", \\"Falling Off The Edge Of The World\\" and \\"Neon Knights\\" over these.<br /><br />My only minor complaints: I was hoping that Tony's guitar would have more of the thick, bludgeoning, wall-of-sound quality that he pretty much invented, but it doesn't quite reach that level on this album. It's still heavy though, don't get me wrong, and nothing compares to hearing it live. Also, the fastest tracks on the album just don't do much for me, and there are places where the lyrics get a bit cheesy. But other than that, this is a very good album that more than holds its own against much of the current stuff out there (much of which was inspired by these guys in the first place). The masters are still showing the students how it's done! I saw the Ozzy reunion tour, and I plan to check this one out as well.<br /><br />Overall, I definitely recommend \\"The Devil You Know\\"!ks \\"Eating the Cannibals\\" and \\"Neverwhere\\", which sound like they were thrown in just for the sake of speeding things up. I'll take \\"TV Crime\\", \\"Falling Off The Edge Of The World\\" and \\"Neon Knights\\" over these.

143911000X|3.0|If you're looking for a set of deep thoughts, well-reasoned arguments, or anything else worthwhile, don't bother.  BARNEY STINSON wrote it, for Pete's sake!  If you're looking for a few entertaining sentences encapsulated in a book you can read in an hour, then you've found it.  It was funny in places, but that's about it.  If you like HIMYM, it's probably worth that hour.  If you don't, I wouldn't bother.
078322947X|5.0|Ah, a great film as a combat veteran of Iraq , i can understand the impact of stress these guys went thou. As i loved the book , and the film Wages of Fear , i found that this film was head and shoulder's above it.<br />While i dont understand why it was named after one of the old army trucks , it still remain a great film.
B00164KYV4|4.0|This is a movie that is a sign of our times. What happened to the telephone when people actually spoke to each other, heard their voices and inflections on the other end of the line.Oh the instant gratification of it all.I see a whole generation of people that don't know how to communicate with each other. Does anyone remember when Carrie Bradshaw got dumped by a post it note......coward.So all this technology may be great ( IM, Texting, e-mail Facebook, my space ...)there is nothing like actual person to person talking which without leads to  non communication and confusion.I love all the cast of characters in this film, especialy Jennifer Goodwin...very good job, trying to find her way around the dating and double talk maze...Drew Barrymore always good ( exhaustingly states she got dumped by 7 different technologies in one day ) Jennifer Aniston plays a character that stands her ground, and Jennifer Connally does and an amazing job of a scorned wife, you could visually see her pain.There were a few good endings and surprises and a very enjoyable movie....Microwave some popcorn and see it with your friends and enjoy the converstion after the movie.
B00164KYV4|5.0|This has nothing to do with being a chick flick or not. It's a great film filled with experiences that men and women go through in relationships. Great to watch if you're looking for an easy laugh. My wife and I saw it with some friends in the movies, and I must say that part of the fun was hearing the comments and laughs coming from the audience. So have your friends over, open a bottle of wine, and have an enjoyable light-hearted evening. It's worth it.
B001TODCII|3.0|\\"Taken\\" is essentially two lines of dialogue - \\"I will find you. And I will kill you.\\" - stretched out into a 90-minute film. The speaker of this line finds his man. And, boy, does he kill him. And then he finds more people and kills them, too. And before he found the guy he was looking for in the first place, he found some other guys. Guess what? He killed them.     This is not a subtle film. It's not all that bloody, either, this tale of a CIA agent (Liam Neeson) whose estranged daughter (Maggie Grace) is kidnapped by sex trade smugglers, thanks to a PG-13 rating. But nuanced? No. Luc Besson (\\"The Fifth Element,\\" \\"The Professional,\\" The \\"Transporter\\" series), who co-wrote the screenplay and more or less breathed life into this thing as producer likes his action scenes big, and his hit men sentimental-yet-efficient.     And Neeson's character, Bryan Mills, is certainly that. He's divorced from his wife (Famke Janssen) for logging too many hours in hot zones for the CIA, and since she's remarried to, of course, a billionaire (Xander Berkeley, not the villain, if you're guessing), Bryan has idealized his gangly, selfish daughter Kim (Maggie Grace), and transformed her into his Reason For Living.     But Kim cons him into signing a release so she can go to Paris with her slightly older, sluttier friend. It's only Bryan's zeal for worrying about every little detail - she forgets to call him upon landing in France, so he calls her - that allows him to hear his daughter getting kidnapped by Albanian slave traders.     Inexplicably, her kidnapper picks up the phone. That's enough for Brian and his connections at the CIA to start the manhunt.     The second and third acts of \\"Taken\\" are, frankly, one mass killing after another, each unlikelier than the last. In the background, we see the pale, starving figures - some alive, some not - of other kidnapped girls. At one point, Bryan looks for his daughter in what appears to be a giant Port-A-Potty divided into tiny rooms by cloth curtains with a bed, a slave and a client in each. Bryan eventually finds the Albanians' home base, which is a hive of, well, drugged-out women and presumed venereal disease.     The movie is structured almost like a video game, with a number of bosses to kill and levels to complete. Brian's most daunting challenges lie in the bowels of a Paris brownstone at a million-dollar auction and aboard a ship headed for the Middle East. Whether Maggie is there, and whether he saves her, I'll let the film reveal.     Let it be said that Maggie Grace, a veteran of the \\"Lost\\" TV series, was 25 years old when she filmed the movie. She's lost any useful clue on how to play an innocent 17-year-old, and thus turns in one of the more embarrassing performances of the year. There is a way to pout - Kim is required to do it in just about every scene - and a way not to, and it's a mark of Grace's inelegance that she never carves out an ounce of chemistry with Neeson, whose Bryan is risking more than his life, his moral compass and years in prison to save her.  And, unfortunately, she is also not cute, as a scene near the end so drastically points out. You'll know the one, and you'll be asking yourself, \\"Her?\\"     Neeson slips nicely into the role once given to Harrison Ford. His Bryan is sharp and ruthless, and the movie's key \\"find you/kill you\\" monologue is delivered with menace and precision. You'll want to watch it twice. Janssen and Berkeley have bit roles, as does the excellent Leland Orser as one of Brian's CIA buddies.     A subplot involving a pop singer is so extraneous and unnecessary that I think it exists to be extraneous and unnecessary, as if to show the audience a modicum of 1980s decency. Everything in \\"Taken\\" - the Eurotrash baddies, the body count, the \\"heart's on fire\\" hero of steely resolve but pudding heart - feels stolen from 1986. In other words - good for a pizza night.
0525951113|2.0|This book is primed and ready to be made into a bloated Hollywood thriller, with all the good and bad this implies.  The interesting tech/intellectual aspects, which are clearly important to the author (and to the story), ultimately (and unfortunately) play second fiddle to movie-magic as the story wears on and increasingly frenetic battles and eye-roller plot-twists become primary focus.<br /><br />While the book is a fun and tense ride, and while I find gory imagery more palatable in print than in film, I just can't handle decapitation and freaky automated human butchering in any format at three in the morning (which is how late you will be up finishing this thing, given its break-neck speed of delivery)...  I was frankly quite surprised by the sudden escalation of graphic descriptions of gore as the book wrapped up and felt very discouraged to be having to slog through bleeding limb stumps and so on in order to read the bits I was actually interested in.<br /><br />Finally, given the fuzzy ending, mentioned by many in the reviews here, I have not an ounce of loyalty left in me to return to this author.  I'll read a plot synopsis of the next book or two, because I am curious to find out what happens, but I really don't like being strung along at high tension, only to be totally let down.  This is clearly a profitability decision which does not serve the story at all.<br /><br />Final Recommendation: This book is just not up to snuff...  It's a thriller, so it will drive you along at a rapid-flash pace (thus falling in the entertaining category, generally) and contains many interesting speculations and descriptions of current and future tech developments, but it does not have a resolution and becomes increasingly gory as it wears on, which may prove disturbing to those with a vivid imagination.  Pick up something else if sci-fi horror is not your thing, or wait for this undoubtedly long series to wrap itself up before digging in.
B000002LEU|5.0|first released at the height of New Orders fame.  It showed, at the time, the development of the group before Ian's death.  Transmission, written primarily by Bernard, shows the sound which would eventually become New Order. If you listen to Joy Division's work (1977-1980), and then listen to the bands from the post punk era/early 80's, you can hear the influence Joy Division had on the English music scene at the time.  A group not to be dismissed.
B0026OE2O8|5.0|This documentary will move you and scare you.  The visuals rival that of \\"Planet Earth\\" released a few years ago.  The colors are simply stunning.  The truth told in this film is mind boggling.  For those that still don't believe - watch the movie.  If after that point you can still sit there and say we have NO impact on our home, then - there is nothing that can be done for your ignorance.      Get the movie.  It will be money well spent!
B001F290E4|1.0|The name of this CD is false advertising. There is no soul to be heard on this CD.    It has a great song list and I was looking forward to some good old fashioned soul. I was shocked by the orchestral arrangements complete with strings (and I don't mean a gritty, bluesy guitar but perky violins). After listening to a couple of tunes and cringing I said to myself \\"this is David Foster.\\" Sure enough, I should have checked the producer and not just relied on the song list.    Some great songs have been ruined. I'm giving this one to Goodwill.
B002708NAA|5.0|This album is amazing.  But I recommend getting the double album, if you can find it.  This is quintessential Pet Shop Boys - pop, romantic, poignant.      Highlights:    \\"Love, Etc\\" - very catchy, very pop, yet thoughtful + poignant - love it!  \\"All Over the World\\" - strange sampling of the Nutcracker Suite, but it works, and the song is lovely  \\"The Way It Used To Be\\" - an astonishingly beautiful and heartbreaking song (reminded me a bit of my other fave PSB song, \\"Love Comes Quickly\\")  \\"Pandemonium\\" - amazing dance tune!  \\"This Used to Be the Future\\" - on the double album only - it has Phil Oakey of the Human League - need I say more?!  Clever reference and homage to the Human League and the retro-futurism of the New Wave era.  \\"Did You See Me Coming\\" - quite nice
B0015AARJI|5.0|Still the best controller I have found for the PS3.  The great thing about buying this on-line is that you pay as much as a 3rd party controller in the stores and actually get the real thing.  Thanks Amazon for offering the right products at reasonable prices!
B0006Q0XDW|5.0|I remember walking into a record store in December '79 and the owner of the store was raging against the album art. For those that don't know the album cover of London Calling is a take-off of Elvis Presley's first record, but instead of smiling for the camera the Clash are smashing a guitar.   To me this record, along with the Elvis record bookmark the beginning and end of the first 25 years of rock music. This record is one of the finest examples of electric as opposed to electronic music. The sound is so generous and the passion right out there on the edge. The amazing nuance of a finger on a string and a vocal track recorded in a single take are things that mostly disappeared not long after this record came out.   London Calling is easily one of the 10 best albums from it's era. Song for song a masterpiece. One reason I bother to keep a turntable going. This is music that suffers from being chopped up into samples, and can't be fully described in bits. Buy the LP and you'll see what I mean.

B001S2PT3M|5.0|I never thought I would root for a serial killer.  But then, no serial killers I've ever come across are as loveable as Dexter Morgan (Michael C. Hall).  After the astounding, hard to beat first season, Dexter continues to make an impression on viewers by not going through the typical \\"sophomore slump.\\"  Season two is every bit as good as the first, perhaps even better.<br /><br />After wrapping up the story of the Ice Truck Killer at the end of season one, the second season opens with a shocking discovery:  an underwater graveyard containing dozens of dismembered bodies buried in large, black trash bags.  For those already familiar with Dexter, you know what this means.  The hunter has become the hunted, and Dexter has to evade the able detective work of his friends at the Miami police department, friends that include his sister, Debra (Jennifer Carpenter).  To complicate matters for our unorthodox hero, serial killer experts are sent from the FBI to help the Miami police track down the so-called Bay Harbor Butcher, and Dexter continues to be harassed by Sergeant James Doakes (Erik King).  Over the course of the season, Dexter works feverishly to stay ahead of his pursuers in what turns out to be a rather clever and crafty \\"cat and cat\\" game.<br /><br />In addition to the complications of his \\"professional\\" life, Dexter's personal life is also thrown into turmoil.  His sometimes erratic behavior causes his girlfriend, Rita (Julie Benz), to become worried, and Dexter is able to get around telling her the truth about himself by telling her he struggles with drug addiction.  This prompts Rita to insist that Dexter enter a 12-step recovery program if he wants to keep their relationship going, not knowing, of course, that doing so would bring Lila (Jaime Murray) into both their lives.<br /><br />The love triangle that ensues serves as the vehicle for the immense amount of character development that takes place in this second season and is what makes this season as good, if not better, than the first.  In the first season, the audience is constantly reminded that Dexte is a cold, unfeeling man and enjoys being with Rita because she's every bit as damaged as he is, and therefore cannot see him for who he really is.  Lila, however, can see right through Dexter and is able to draw out Dexter's deeply buried emotions and help him cultivate them.  Along the way he discovers new information about who he is, where he came from, and reaches the unsettling truth that his adoptive father, Harry (James Remar), might not deserve the pedestal that Dexter has placed him atop of.<br /><br />This all works together to provide a memorable season with a complex, rather unexpected conclusion.  Dexter is a wonderful show that is absolutely worth checking out.  With so much puerile trash out there today, an intelligent and creative show such as this is truly refreshing.<br /><br />Video/Audio<br />The blu-ray set is presented in a 1.78:1 aspect ratio in 1080p.  The picture quality is excellent, and the blu-ray version really makes the bright and vibrant colors of Miami sizzle on the screen.  The audio is also done very well, presented in 5.1 Dolby TrueHD.  The sound is very clear and sharp.<br /><br />Special Features<br />There aren't many special features on the disc, and those that are there are only BD Live, so you will have to have a player capable of the BD Live functionality in order to watch them.  There are two episodes of another Showtime show, The United States of Tara, a featurette entitled \\"Blood Fountains,\\" a bunch of cast interviews, and a few commercial-type \\"Dark Defender\\" videos.

There are two episodes of another Showtime show, The United States of Tara, a featurette entitled \\"Blood Fountains,\\" a bunch of cast interviews, and a few commercial-type \\"Dark Defender\\" videos.  All in all, the special features really aren't worth one's time, although a few of the interviews are pretty interesting.
630463949X|5.0|This is a really great DVD for both the Fleetwood Mac fan as well as audiophiles wishing to pick up a really nice Demo disc.  I won't say that all the tracks are fantastic.  The songs you know, are all above average when compared to the recorded classics.  Over half of those are great.  And at least two or three of them are exceptional.  My favorite on this disc is Silver Stream.   I have no idea why it wasn't put on the album years ago when it was recorded(the rumour album if I recall correctly).  Plus, there are a couple songs sung by Lyndsey Buckingham that should surprise the casual fan.  Overall, I really enjoyed it and look forward to purchasing another of their dvds.

0962477060|5.0|After fooling around for decades with trying to teach myself how to play more than just chords through friends and books and tapes, I decided to give this book a try. It was the best musical move I have ever made. NO DOUBT the finest and simplest way to clarify how to create riffs, runs and solos.  The proverbial light came on and now the fretboard makes sense to me in lead and rhythm.  If only I had known about this resource years ago.  Hands down I learned more in 2 hours with this book than all the other paraphernalia combined.  This is the way to go if you really are serious about understanding how to get music from the fretboard.
B000FAGGWQ|4.0|Most common fans won't get overly excited about these bonus features, and it really is a shame that there isn't more here or that it wasent included with the new box set release. But for those that love Star Wars you'll easily blow threw a lazy evening or two with this DVD. It has lenghty interveiws and indeph documantry's about why the Star Wars movies were made and alot of the personal experiences that went into them.
B001AVEJ1Y|5.0|This re-start of the Star Trek movie series is to Science Fiction what last summer's [[ASIN:B001C08RHA Iron Man]] was to comic book movies. It completely meets our desires for what a movie like this could be, and then exceeds what almost all other films in a \\"sci-fi\\" series do. The only other movie to have this kind of creative success would have been the original [[ASIN:B001EN71DG Star Wars Trilogy]], where the whole wheel that held up the transporter got reinvented. JJ Abrahams has done that, here.<br /><br />Instead of making the characters up from whole cloth ala [[ASIN:B000RZIGVS Star Trek: The Next Generation]], he imagines how James T Kirk, First Officer Spock, et al first find themselves on The Enterprise and why. Kirk (Chris Pine) is a fatherless, troubled womanizer, Spock (Zachary Quinto, aka [[ASIN:B000QDLSR0 Heroes']] Sylar), a conflicted child of two (therefore, no) worlds. \\"Bones\\" McCoy (Karl Urban) gives away the origin of his nickname. We see The Enterprise launch for the first time. This is both an emotionally and visually stunning film, with sets and sights played to the original Star Trek and to modern science fiction mythology.<br /><br />And what a job they do. The cast is spot on in reinterpreting their characters that we all know they'll be back for. Quinto in particular is amazing as Spock, easily imaginable as Leonard Nimoy's young doppelganger. Eric Bana is great the villain, a Romulan miner seeking revenge for the destruction of his home planet at the hands of the Vulcans. The movie cruises at warp-speed, refusing to allow any kind of time-drag to occur or sub-plots (of which there are several) to become dead weight. There's enough light humor and references to the original series to make the most die-hard of fans happy. Most importantly, the entertainment value is sky-high. I have not felt a hunger for the Star Trek films since the late 90's, and this \\"Star Trek\\" makes me ready for the future.
B001AK3S4Y|5.0|Most DVD's don't have alot of effort put into them, Hellboy DVD's are beautifully designed with lots of behind the scenes films and interveiws my fav bonus is the old Edger Allen Poe cartoon witch unfortuantly is not included in the Directors Cut version so when I got the DC I still kept this copy just for that fact alone. The movie itself is great, fan's of H. P. Lovecraft, macabre and freakish stories and myths will be delighted with Hellboy's adventures, You can't help but like Hellboy played by Ron Pearlman of Beauty and the Beast fame, as he has far more in common with a working grunt/everyman or Jayne from Firefly, then Superman or Spider-Man and other comic book superhero's and yet he still is a superhero, not an anti-hero or rebel without a cause. I firmly belive that if a cast and crew get along and enjoy there jobs, the audience can usually tell from watching closesly and you can tell everyone had fun on this picture, especially the audience!
B001TODO72|5.0|An elegantly ordered, deeply thought out memoir of a father by his daughter.<br /><br />The author's father - a high school English teacher in a small town, a part time funeral home embalmer, a home body, a Do It Yourself home improver, outwardly so utterly ordinary  - had a  secret sexual life.<br /><br />The author draws parallels between her journey and ultimate escape from the small town traditions and thinking, and her father's growing, somewhat voluntary entrapment and suffocation therein.<br /><br />The father taught the author to be an independent thinker and love literature and history and gave her her intellectual and spiritual wings.  Yet he also tried to impose his vision of femininity on her - e.g., forcing a barrette on the hair of his tomboyish resentful daughter.<br /><br />The father had some ingrained notion of staying married to a woman, carrying on the family's small town funeral home business, living in his ancestral home town though he also loved visiting the gay neighborhoods of New York City on certain weekends.  He was caught between half hearted adherence to social norms and his internal deep seated insuppresible yearnings.<br /><br />This memoir is not so much about sexual orientation, but about peoples' true natures, and how only so much of it can be healthily moulded into normal forms, and much of it can be suppressed, but at high mental cost.<br /><br />If you enjoyed this book, I recommend the author's Dykes to Watch Out For series, especially the later volumes - it's about more than lesbians, but about humanity and the importance of individuality and being true to ourselves.

0060555661|4.0|The book that Warren Buffett considers the bible of investing is well worth the read.    The investment approach laid out by Benjamin Graham is a no-nonsense long term value investing strategy. Markets are not as efficient as Malkiel would suggest and there are opportunities out there for investors who do their research and manage their risk properly. The author cautions that our own emotions can be our worst enemy and must be strictly managed and rails against speculators who take too much risk or rely on technical analysis.    While Graham's philosophy still resounds today and is very applicable in the current market his examples are quite dated. That is where Jason Zweig steps in and updates each chapter with footnotes and his own commentary to highlight recent examples and bring the text up to date.
B001MEJY8W|5.0|A little overhyped.  I was expecting the violence to be more extreme, but the story is more than great.  You may want more gore, but the need to know 'why?' is enough to keep you going.  Don't get me wrong, the movie is brutal and bloody.  Although, after High Tension and Inside, any french horror film needs to make me gag...

B001AJVR5M|5.0|Very good! In my opinion the best song on here has to be Sorry. It's a very good, emotional song. You can tell the boys mean what they say.  Next in line is the quirky sing-along, \\"Lovebug\\". No doubt you've heard it before! love it.
B001B6EAOY|2.0|I used this product for my PSP-3000, and everything worked as advertised for a few month.  Recently my PSP started refusing to read from the device more and more frequently.  I would need to take out the adapter and re-insert the MicroSDHC cards to have it recognized again.  Eventually it became so frequently unreadable that it's no longer practical to use.    I use the USB cable to transfer files between my PC and PSP so I never took out the adapter from the PSP, risking damage. Once the problems came up, reformatting and switching around the MicroSDHC cards have not helped.    I probably ended up with a bad lot, but it sounds like many users are having the same issue so buying one of these could be a little gamble, given that problems could arise several month later.  That said, it's fast and cheap as long as it works.
0394800389|5.0|Dr. Seuss' Fox in Socks is by far one of my three most favorite books from childhood.  What great detail is to be found in the illustrations, classic fantastic images on page after page, which, alone, are worth the price of the book.  however, it has words and somewhat of a plot.  for us old geezers, the font is big enough to see!  It contains many episodes between that pesky Fox wearing socks and Mr. Knox.  As with all of Dr. Suess' writings, it contains numerous tongue-twisting pages that bring out howling and laughter in our home.  Of course, it's usually dad who'se the subject of the laughter.  [a word of advice: parents, never reading this book after an exhausting day or after you've taken sleeping medicine or you'll embarrass yourself with tonge twisters.]  This book holds a special, magical place in my heart, so, with great bias, I highly recommend it for everyone who is or was a kid and I give this an A+.
B0026JWDQW|5.0|I am truly a fan, I loved his first record: \\"These Streets\\" is beautiful, simple and unpretentious, with an unforgettable voice. The fact that his first record sold millions is not by chance, Paolo has one of the best, if not THE BEST voice out there. This second album proves he is truly a complete artist with brilliant vocals and also proves that his writing is moving forward and getting better..  You will need more than a quick listen; there are many styles and layers in there.  Vocals are brilliant ....it does not matter what kind of song he sings, his range and vocal control are most  unique......what a talented artist.  \\"Growing up besides you\\" is incredible, great background vocals but make sure you watch the live video version on his website.. his voice just comes out, no effort at all..(that is just pure talent). \\"No Other Way\\" an incredible ballad. \\"Candy\\" gets better as you listen and the second half of the song is fabulous, the video helped me a bit to like the song.  All songs are different and have something to offer.  Awesome, brilliant follow up.  He also deserves a lot of credit for doing what he believes is right.
B00006L6YG|5.0|The content speaks for itself, a must have, but it is the SACD recording that takes it over the top!  I have a decent collection of SACD's and DVD-A's, and I put this in the top of the list.
055358202X|4.0|Though the book is well written it is not the usual spell binding excellence that one would attribute to G.R.R.M.  The characters in this book no longer fit the mold that I had made from the previous novels.  Do I now like Jamie...How did Cersei get so crazy, and who are all of these new people?<br />I think one of the reasons I enjoy the author so much is because of the unpredictability of the main characters.  Will the good guy win, or will he or she survive for that matter.<br />But it begs the question:  After removing/killing most of the heros from the previous books can Martin build new characters that are just as lovable as the original Stark Family?  I hope so I love this series.<br />Thanks
B000002UC5|5.0|So many people want to play down what was done by Paul McCartney as maybe just unique, but this is not just any solo work by an artist it represents a completely authored album by one performer playing all instruments, writing the entire collection of songs and after 39 years Maybe I am Amazed gets more radio play as with any other Beatles or classic rock songs.

McCartney presents a pure form of the art of music in the songs such as Every Night and others that were written at the end of the sixties but left of Beatles albums and in their own write are classics.      That would be something if any artist out there could offer a pure collection of his various talents as Paul McCartney has done and one could only imagine what if the Beatles had included his songs presented here on McCartney just how awesome that would be.   It was 1970 after the biggest band of the time has just broken up at the time when the Beatles has just release their last album.   As I recall it got rave reviews then and still does.  Amend.
0743297334|5.0|In \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" Ernest Hemingway tells of the experiences that Jake has with the other characters, doing things that are exciting and enjoying each other.  Jake is friends with Robert Cohn, and Ernest Hemingway starts the book with a description of Robert.  The book proceeds through a series of events to a pleasant resolution.<br />  The characters are developed well and characterized in various and interesting ways.  The settings are described in detail that brings them vividly to the imagination.  The plot keeps the reader interested with conflicts and resolutions along the way.
B001AVEJ1Y|4.0|Many things have already been said about J. J. Abrams' new \\"Star Trek\\" film and as far as critics go, most of them are positive ones including some raving reviews. Before watching the much anticipated film, I was skeptical. And I was wrong. The new feature film succeeds in not only rebooting the Paramount's hugely popular series, but becoming a great staring point for the new chapters that will be seen in the future. The \\"odd-number\\" theory is officially disproved.    The film opens with thrilling and very emotional introductory sequences about James T. Kirk's father, who was \\"captain of a starship for twelve minutes\\" and saved 800 lives. Then we are introduced to young Kirk (Chris Pine) himself leading an aimless life until one day he speaks with a Starfleet captain Christopher Pike (Bruce Greenwood) in a bar. Ambitious and rebellious, James T. Kirk impulsively joins the Academy. Three years later a Romulan spaceship attacks the Federation ships and he and the other crew of the Enterprise - Spock (Zachary Quinto), McCoy (Karl Urban), Uhura (Zoe Saldana), Sulu (John Cho), Chekhov (Anton Yelchin), and Scottie (Simon Pegg)     The film can be enjoyed by the uninitiated and the fans (well, most of them, I think) alike, with spectacular visuals and those interesting and likable characters you can relate to. The script (by Abrams and co-screenwriters Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman) gets sometimes complicated and even confusing (to allow for the inclusion of Leonard Nimoy, his first appearance on screen since 1991), but manages to keep us interested. I admit it is not very intelligent, but still entertaining.    Lastly I add this. I belong to the generation watching \\"The Next Generation\\" and the re-runs of the original TV series. I am a fan of the series, maybe not a very big fan, but I know there are lots of gaps and plot holes regarding the new film's story, internally and in connection with the timeline of the original series. So the storyline and the details might bother you. I happen to like and enjoy the film partly because I kept in mind that this new film is set in another universe.
B00164KYV4|1.0|What a shame. The book was *so* informative and got me through some of the worst breakups imaginable. This movie had everything going for it- big budget, glossy cast, and a great idea. But it was executed extremely poorly and ended up being a lie. This is supposed to be about the reality and the harshness of relationships, and it isn't. It's just another romantic comedy that doesn't seem to have any underlying message to the audience. And I couldn't stand the characters, especially Scarlett Johansson, who I usually can't get enough of. I didn't relate to this film at all. Bottom line, get the book, ignore the movie.

B000RJO578|5.0|Ah, genius. Some people have it, some don't.<br /><br />Edward Wright, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost should just make movies together. Pegg, don't bother with 'Star Trek,' you're funnier when you get to be rated R. Guys, stop participating in quasi-heartwarming films like 'Run Fatboy Run.' Just keep doing your Blood and Ice Cream films and we'll all be happy.<br /><br />I'm a giant fan of 'Shaun of the Dead,' of course, as any self-respecting zombie lover should be. While 'Hot Fuzz' is a bit more polished across the board than 'Shaun', and maybe some of that production value is what turned people off, clearly the look and style of the film was more posh because that's part of the joke. Overly-saturated big action films are what's being satirized here.<br /><br />The genius of this comedy lies in the clever, controlled handling of all the elements. Making fun of stupid cop movies? Check. Constant visual and auditory referencing of previous collaborations AND other films? Check. Charming character development and genuine emotion? Check. Do I hoot my way through this movie every time I see it as much as I did the first time I saw it? Yes, I do.<br /><br />I'm writing this review because I also think this DVD is pretty nicely put-together. I'm not usually a fan of long, complicated DVD menus, mainly because it slows everything down and you can't just forward through to starting the film, but this menu is both well-executed and worth sitting through. Also, there are some brilliant extras, including a Sean Connery bit and a truly fine gag reel. Often the gag reel is really only funny to the people who worked on the film - kind of a 'you had to be there' thing that somehow the filmmakers think other people will get - but when you get comedy skillz like these gents have, you get ACTUAL funny. By the power of Greyskull!
B001U0HBQ0|4.0|This was not a movie I was particularly interested in seeing because the trailers made it seem to me that this was an updated version of Forrest Gump mixed with one of those 80's sci-fi shows of alien races that age backwards.  In other words, nothing original.  However when I noticed that it was a Criterion release I had to give it a shot and add it to my library of their titles.  I was pleasantly surprised to see that there was some originality to it and despite being over 2 and a half hours long I was in to the story the whole time.  As with their other Blu-ray releases, Criterion has done a great job with the video quality (of course this is a recent film with quite a bit of digital shooting so they did not have to go through the restoration process they've done with some older films).
0425188809|5.0|I was in a book store and happened upon 'Watchers'. I had read it more than a decade ago. I had always treasured the book and had passed it on to many people. I thought I'd post a review just to praise Koontz and his ability to create two characters that are as memorable as any I have ever read.    The incredible part about this book is that the two characters I mentioned above are not human. The genetically engineered and lovable dog, \\"Einstein\\", and the scientific monstrosity known as the \\"Outsider\\" steal the show. It is one of the few occasions where two fictional imaginations bridge the razor thin barrier between human emotion and animal instinct. I have read many of Koontz's novels but I am hard pressed to chose one that has a more indelible impact.     I don't want to give away any spoilers or say any more about the two supporting actors that grab the spotlight. I must comment on the book's conclusion which is one of a handful that has stayed with me over the course of a few decades. Underpinning the emotional and stirring conclusion is the question of why do we aim to kill,destroy, or otherwise overtake what we sometimes envy? Even beyond that question is the enigmatic and omnipresent scientific implications that keep the pages turning. Koontz has always been adept at suspending disbelief and 'Watchers' is one of a select few tales that is vibrantly real and impossible to ignore.     I can't recommend this book strongly enough.
B0009MAO46|5.0|I'm anxious to see how this looks on Blu-Ray, but now I find out that release is delayed until late 2010 after a 3-D version of this film and its sequel are being relased.  A 3-D version of Toy Story is supposed to come out late this year (2009).    Whatever, \\"Toy Story\\" is a very clever animated story that was a big hit when it came out in 1995  and justifiably so. It had a terrific sequel and a third is scheduled for June 18, 2010 (yes, in 3-D).     When this \\"original\\" came out, computer technology just was beginning to strut its stuff. Man, this looked awesome. Now, it's routine because animation, which took a giant leap with this movie, has made a lot more giant strides.  Still, this will always be a great film because it was   the humor in here, however, is what made this so popular.     There are tons of funny lines, issued by characters voiced by Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Jim Varney, Don Rickles, Wallace Shawn and John Ratzenberger, among others. As good as Hanks is as \\"Woody\\" and Allen as \\"Buzz Armstrong,\\" I think the supporting characters just about stole the show: Mr. Potato Head, Slinky, Rex the dinosaur, etc.    Multiple viewings don't diminish the entertainment, either. There are so many things to catch, audibly and visually, that you always seem to discover something new. The colors in here are beautiful, too. This is a guaranteed \\"winner.\\"

B000067IZ3|3.0|This is an ugly story in parts but still fascinating to watch  for the unique way it's presented, especially for those who like a different visual/audio approach.    As for the acting, Michael Douglas usually plays interesting roles and this is no exception. Benicio Del Toro got an Oscar for his role but I don't know why. He wasn't anything that special. Personally, I liked Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman in here better with the latter adding some much-needed humor to the film. Miguel Ferrer was also intense as the bad guy, \\"Eduardo Ruiz.\\"    The two kids who played Douglas's daughter and her boyfriend (Erika Christensen and Topher Grace, respectively), received no billing on the back on the DVD but they had major roles. They must have done a good job because they really irritated me. The girl's descent into drug hell was not pleasant to view. This is not an easy story to watch, or comprehend everything that's going on. It also is not one with a happy message.    The visuals were great with many all-sepia toned scenes, or all blue hues. Scenes changed every two minutes to a different ongoing. You had to really pay attention but I never found myself drifting away from the story.    It isn't just the unique visuals; it's an interesting and disturbing story.
B0014Z4OQG|3.0|I will give J.J. Abrams his due, he is true to his craft and makes you watch what he wants to show you. He is not one to pander to his audience and leave everything in a nice, neatly wrapped up bundle at the end of the film. Cloverfield is like that, we do not know what the creature really looks like or where it might be from or if it was killed in the end.  What is the Hammerdown protocol anyway?  This reminds me so much of Lost where we don't know much about The Others, or the Dharma Initiative.  We are supposed to enjoy the ride not getting to the destination.     I am not going to say that Cloverfield is excellent film making, but it is an interesting film and quite honestly a fun movie if you let your self relax and enjoy it.  Don't take it too seriously, it is supposed to be fun!
B001FSDOZO|5.0|Despite accusations of sounding too generic and cheesy, Nickelback have quickly become one of the most electrifying rock bands of our time thanks to at least 3 hit albums and a string of catchy pop/rock tunes over the past 10 years. With clear influences from such 80's bands like Def Leppard and ZZ Top, Nickelback have also successfully become what those bands were for their era, only 20 years late, which is a good thing.     Dark Horse is no different from past efforts, except for the collaboration with Mutt Lange, the guy famous for previously working with artists like Bryan Adams and Def Leppard, and that is a good thing, also. As a matter of fact, Lange's presence on the album gives it a boost in all the right directions.     The albums opens up with the party starter Something In Your Mouth, a song so catchy you'll be humming the opening chords for hours after hearing it. Burn It To The Ground follows suit, another catchy tune with layers of guitars, and Chad Kroeger's fun lyrics. The first single, Gotta Be Somebody, sounds awesome clocking in 3rd in the tracklist. Despite the cheesy lyrics, the song's sound is overwhelmingly satisfying for any hard rock fan. What's a Nickelback album without the ballads? Well, this album consists of a whole bunch of them starting with the lovely I'd Come For You, passing through the touchy wedding song Never Gonna Be Alone, and ending with the thoughtful life-pondering If Today Was Your Last Day. Dark Horse also includes such public awareness gems as Just To Get High about a drug addict wasting his life for a hit, with which Nickelback have now become pioneers (watch the video for If Everyone Cared from the 2005 effort All The Right Reasons). There's also the raunchy Next Go Round where Nickelback get down and dirty, resulting in a song that will bring the roof down at live concerts. And I just can't forget about the album closer, This Afternoon, a song in the vein of Rockstar about kicking back and enjoying time with friends,which is quite frankly the most uplifting song on the album, and one of Nickelback's greatest songs, thanks to the handy work of Mutt Lange.     One of the most enjoyable rock albums of the year!    Highly Recommended    A

B0025WUK1U|5.0|Being that Jeff's mother has had almost everything to do with all of Jeff's posthumous releases, I have to give her props for releasing this amazing 3 disc set packed with Buckley amazingness.  Theirs a lot on here that fans may have heard or seen before but theirs plenty that most fans haven't.     The documentary on disc 3 is great for getting lots of insight into the man that was Jeff Buckley.  Their are interviews intertwined throughout so you can see for yourself that information being presented is faithful.  Also on disc 1 you get lots of live stuff, with Jeff speaking about his music, life, and philosophy in between each song.  Basically this is for hardcore Jeff fans for the most part, which it seems to me that most of his fans are.  So buy, buy, buy people!

Throughout the film a seemingly sloppy Joker based on the appearance of his makeup coldly pushes all the right buttons and carefully turns Gotham on itself and its hero in Batman and new DA in Harvey Dent who is cracking down on organized crime. He tells Harvey Dent he is no mastermind in a scene at Gotham General Hospital but we all know that he is in that great scene. There are numerous fabulous scenes where Heath Ledger plays like Iago planting the seeds to turn Harvey Dent from a hero to a villain. Heath is outstanding throughout.    Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent is even more charismatic than Christian Bale as Batman and you will want him to be the true hero he seems to want to be. But as it is in life it is not uncommmon for people to have multiple conflicting ideas of where they stand in the world. There confidence in not unwavering. The seeds of doubt can be planted so easily when you are dealt with tragedy as The Joker torments Harvey with.    People that play important roles in Gotham society are ruthlessly murdered in targeted assassinations and The Dark Knight world is a world gripped in a terrorized state ruled by the Joker. Much like The Empire Strikes Back this movie is hopefully the darkness before the dawn of the next sequel because it will leave you in awe but hollow to the core because there truly is no final resolution by the end of the film. But trust me you will want more like one yearns for in lust or hunger after a great meal.    From a technical standpoint I wholeheartily love the picture quality and from an audio standpoint a scene where a hospital literally explodes was so mesmerizingly earthshattering that I couldn't help grinning maniacally like The Joker.    Stop reading. Point click and buy. Just push the button.
0446677450|5.0|This was the first book in Rich Dad series I also read just several others and I was also so impressed with style and Robert's attempt on bringing basic fundamentals of financial and personal management that went ahead and ready other books in this series too one after another. I highly recommend this book for everybody. A must read !    Somebody said that a lot in this book has to do with just plain old common sense. Spend less than you earn, save money, and invest wisely. That's all there is to it. But important thing is, as they say, common sense is not so common. This book points out exactly the same thing, but in style!    It doesn't matter whether or not Robert really went through all things as the book describes in story. But he conveyed the right principles in a very interesting way that makes this book so unique, interesting like reading a story book and yet powerful.    But, one shouldn't take this book as their bible for success. Everybody's personal and financial situation is different. So, one should learn the principles from this book, assess your financial situation, use common sense and make little little changes as appropriate. One shouldn't just go ahead and quit their job after reading this book right away!    It's great book to read and learn and have fun !
0552150266|5.0|First, Hal Moore is one of my personal heros. I would follow him into combat anytime. His book is a true accounting of America's first \\"official\\" engagement of the Vietnam Conflict (War). Against a far superior force in numbers, Col. Moore's 1/7th Cav (Airmobile) Battalion outlasted the enemy and proved that the use of helicopters in close air support, resupply, and Dustoff was certainly a brilliant strategy. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in a factual accounting of verious missions in early Vietnam To Col. Moore, Garry Owen Sir!.
0142410373|5.0|This is a hilarious book. Ms.Trunchbulls's character is both beastly and fascinating. Ms.Trunchbull dreads children so much, whenever a child disobeys her she locks them in the chokey! (a scary place for unruly students). There is a teacher named Ms.Honey who is a kind and big hearted who loves small children. These two women are constantly at war with each other even when it comes to Matilda. The book was entertaining from the beginning to the end.
B001FB4W0W|4.0|Alan Ball ([[ASIN:B000HEVZBW Six Feet Under - The Complete Series Gift Set]]) takes on Charlaine Harris's beloved [[ASIN:0441017770 Sookie Stackhouse, Books 1-7]] in True Blood, starring Anna Paquin as Sookie Stackhouse, a telepathic waitress in a small Louisiana parish. Sookie's gift is feared and misunderstood by the superstitious locals, although her boss Sam Merlotte (Sam Trammell) is sympathetic and longs to woo Sookie. Sookie lives with her grandmother Adele (Lois Smith) and her cat and has no romantic life to speak of; being able to read her dates' thoughts is a real turn-off. Her boring life is turned upside-down by the arrival of Bill Compton (Stephen Moyer), a vampire who's lived since the Civil War. In Harris's world, vampires have been \\"out of the coffin\\" for a couple of years and are seeking their civil rights, although Bill is the first vampire that Sookie's seen in Bon Temps.<br /><br />Rounding out the cast is Tara (Rutina Wesley), an uppity and downright disagreeable young woman with serious issues, Sookie's himbo brother Jason (Ryan Kwanten), who's into kinky sex and lots of it, and Lafayette (Nelsan Ellis), Tara's super-gay cousin who works as a short-order cook with a side of drug dealing. These three characters are given much larger roles than in the original novel, and this is not always an effective choice. Some of the invented side stories meander and eventually become loose ends that don't add to the storyline.<br /><br />One of the sticking points are the \\"Southern\\" accents; many of the leads aren't American (Paquin is originally from New Zealand, Kwanten is Aussie and Moyer is English), and the rest of the cast hails from various Southern states (Georgia, Tennessee, West Virginia). Generally, the accents don't noticeably distract (at least not for me, but I grew up in the northern US). Eric Northman is played by Swedish actor Alex Skarsgard ([[ASIN:B001AQO3WY Generation Kill]]), and like in the books, he has a very slight accent that crops up from time to time (Alex also gets to say a few lines in Swedish).<br /><br />Ball and the various writers (including input from Charlaine Harris) use [[ASIN:0441018254 Dead Until Dark: A Sookie Stackhouse Novel (Sookie Stackhouse/True Blood)]] as the basis for the major plot arcs of the first season, which will please fans. Dark humor lightens the tone, but the series is far more blood-drenched and sexed up than the books; nearly every episode features full nudity of Jason in various positions vigorously \\"working out.\\" I could have done without the graphic sex or the constant string of profanity. There's also a lot of gore and violence towards women.  The special effects were generally good, although I disliked the drug trip sequences and thought that it took the series too far from its original destination. The music was spot-on and enhanced scenes with the right tone.<br /><br />The opening credits deserve special mention; the uneasy blend of decomposing animals, maggots, sex and salvation is brilliant. The feel of the series captures a backwoods small town trapped by poverty, steeped in alcohol, and fueled by evangelism. Ball draws several none-too-subtle analogies between vampires coming out and gay bashing; \\"God hates fangs\\" is a recurring theme, and there's a gay vampire that pleads for understanding. Lafayette's character is also discriminated against by several drunk rednecks who tell him that they don't want his \\"AIDS burger.\\" There are also political statements not present in the original books; the vampire bar Fangtasia has a telling portrait of W. as a vampire greedily draining the neck of the Statue of Liberty, and Terry is an Iraq war vet suffering from PTSD who says that watching politicians on TV \\"gives him seizures.\\"<br /><br />Extras include several tongue-in-cheek (fang in cheek?) parodies of cheesy ads for vampire dating services, True Blood commercials, and short promo pieces that were originally featured as viral videos on the True Blood website, as well as audio commenteries. Overall, True Blood does a good job of capturing the feel of the original novels and should please fans of the series.Overall, True Blood does a good job of capturing the feel of the original novels and should please fans of the series.
0066620996|5.0|\\"Good to Great\\" is a great read.  In fact, it is a must-read for CEOs.  It's about being a humble leader.  It's not about you; it's about the company.  The book is split into 3 sections that are involved in a \\"Good-to-Great\\" Company: Disciplined People, Disciplined Thought, and Disciplined Action.  At the end, all that is tied together through the \\"Flywheel Effect\\".  Once the momentum of the flywheel gets going, it should keep going and never change directions.  In addition, the author Jim Collins frequently shows the difference between \\"Good to Great\\" Companies and Comparison Companies.  It mentions how the different types of companies do things differently and think differently as well.  Simplicity is strongly emphasized in the book as the \\"Hedgehog Concept\\", for a very simple concept can take a company a long way as a CEO.
B0013FXWU6|3.0|As many other reviewers have already stated this is an exceptional movie with a great story line that holds your attention from start to finish.  The acting is also superb, lead by Daniel Day-Lewis.  Unfortunately the single disc DVD comes in a cheap cardboard trifold monstrosity.  When placed on a shelf with other DVD's it is next to impossible to find.  Are the plastic protective cases, with their fine art work, on their way to becoming extinct or is  this an abberation.  I fear the worst.
B00070Q8DQ|4.0|this album is slightly over hyped and over advertised as the best death metal album of its year.    the first 4 tracks are awesome, but then it blends into my background noise until the last song  (in fact i never know when Slaves shall serve come on, it sounds too similar to the previous and next track).    but otherwise the first 4 tracks and the last track are the main article in my opinion, which you can just go to an mp3 store to get those.    but one cool thing about the album is having the linear notes and sidenotes of what each song means and is talking about.    other than that, i would preferably suggest Zos kia cultus or the Apostasy, those are much better and entertaining albums that have a more identifiable sound between each song for the most part  :-)    p.s. offtopic kinda, and i hope when i get extra money, i will buy those albums myself actually, but i have a long list of other stuff to buy before then
B001KVZ6FM|5.0|No, I'm not talking about the quality of the animation or the effects.  This movie is a huge fantasy that begins at the end of a life that just didn't turn out the way someone wanted it to.  He wanted adventure, he got a home and a job.  He wanted kids, and his wife couldn't have them.  And now, just as he's crossed the line and it about to get hauled off to the rest home to run out the clock, the adventure begins!  And, what adventure!<br /><br />Without giving away the detail, I belive this picure will be an enduring classic right up there with Toy Story.  I even like it better than the brilliant Wall-E, because it's more real.  The envirnomental message resonates with some, but I think many more can relate to life just not working out the way it was planned, of hopes and dreams being crushed, at the looming end of everything.  But still, adventure is out there!<br /><br />And, actually getting to meet one's hero can turn out in a way you don't expect, and not necessarily good.<br /><br />This is an animated movie with a mind and a soul, when so many seem to have neither.  And dogs are always funny, right?  Woof!
B000085RTX|5.0|i've been listening to this album a lot lately on Zune, and since Steam hammer records started changing their DRMs rights preventing subscription downloads of a lot of their music available, i started buying their albums started with The Fourth Legacy, and i recently ordered this (expecting to eventually lose rights to Karma soon).    but trust me, this is so worth it, love Roy Khan's voice, and the music is so awesome, the metal is awesome, the ballads are awesome, the power ballads are awesome, it is so awesome its hard to use words to describe how epic and romantic this band is.    big smiles   :-D
0756405890|2.0|I did finish the book, which is what got it the second star, but really the author fell apart, and un-developed the main character for the last 400 pages. He didnt start out too bad, but how can someone so smart and gifted and capable be so stupid just to take the story on a tangent.  Not once but over and over and over. You take away the stupid and there is no second half to the book. We never seem to find out what the wizard learns at wizard school. He gets there knowing more then the teachers and spends 400+ pages fighting for a key to the library, all that he really seems to want.  Two thirds of the way through the book, I thought that the writer will someday publish a good book, but Name of the Wind is not it. By the end that was burned out of me. I really don't believe that anyone that finished the book would rate it to highly.  The part of his life where he is with his family and learning is pretty good. But from there this book degrades until you have to try to remember why you were enjoying it.
B001E1GXPA|5.0|i realize Trivium started as your average metalcore band, which gained them attention in the american underground.  but then did the crusade and got them europeon attention  (while pissing off half of their american fans in the process).  but Shogun is so much more, way more than just style experimentation.  and obviously a lot of bands start out doing something at first, burning off their hatred, misery, letting out their negative energy, then eventually softening up like Staind, Linkin park, Green day, A.F.I., Bad religion...   and with Trivium doing the crusade made you think that they were about to start acting like they were reincarnates of 80s metal.  but then they realized they were heavier than that, they couldn't just stop the hard vocals and put together one of the greatest albums i have ever heard from this year so far.    the first few notes of the album starting off with the song Kirisute gomen is the exact rhythm of the chorus of the title-track Shogun.    a keen example that this time the band wanted to recognize the entire album as one figure, instead of past albums seeming to be sort of this song is that, that song is this, but mostly this album is connected is some sort of mix of both realism and fantism (in my opinion) using both history and various mythology alongside as well some real world issues and or metaphoric representations of past situations to new.    though i admit, and even the band themselves, were not 100 % on EVERY song of the album, but with production pushing them, they did work harder to sand the edges as far as they could.    all in all, this is not their old school, this is not another Crusade album, it is merely a step in the right direction with elements from both old and new Trivium and this time it is done right.
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|After Batman Begins I didin't think they could top it, but they did! This movie was great from start to finish, Heath Ledger was amazing, he will be missed. My only complaint of this movie was Rachel Dawes, she was terrible, couldn't they have found someone better than that?
B00005MP58|5.0|A very enjoyable BBC version of this Jane Austen classic. Length of the movie is very long--it was created as mini series--but on DVD it is a pleasure to watch. Colin Firth is a great Mr. Darcy for Jennifer Ehle's portrayal of Elizabeth Bennet.
B001KVZ6ES|5.0|This was one of the best films of the year. The humor in it is a bit raw, so if you are easily offended you might want to steer clear of this one. But if you like things that are not politically correct than this film might be right up your ally. Maybe the story is a bit \\"Hollywooded\\" up, old man set in his ways, young boy reaches out, blah blah, you get the idea. But it still was a very entertaining movie anyway. To me, this was one of Eastwood's best efforts to date.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|For those who enjoy Jane Austen, this is not one of her best stories; however, the video is well done and I wanted it for my DVD collection.
B001TOD9VI|3.0|So there was a lot of hype around this movie, and I was excited when it finally arrived. But I have to admit, I wasn't wowed by it. It was a good movie but I didn't think it was a great as everyone was telling me it was. The extra were good though, I particularly enjoyed the round table discussion with some of the old wrestler I used to watch growing up, you find out a lot of the guys are still wrestling on smaller stages. Rowdy Roddy Piper is the only one that is still somewhat main stream. But othen than that I can't get very excited about this one, good watch but wish I had rented it.
0312360266|3.0|My daughter is 11 and recently brought this book home to read.  I pre-read all the books classified as \\"Young Adult\\" before she reads them just to ensure that the content is not something that I believe she is too young to handle.  By page 57, I had decided that this book was too mature for her and she is going to have to wait until probably high school to read this series.  The sexual and drug references were to detailed for me.  Although the main heroine has not gotten involved in any of those activities, there are several references and descriptions throughout the book that I don't want my daughter reading.    That being said, I did finish the book and enjoyed the story.  The plot was a little predictible, but the writing style was nice and it was a quick read.  I will probably read the rest of the series - but will keep them off my daughter's shelf for another few years.
0451450523|5.0|That about sums it up.  I feel silly even trying to explain how moving I found this story.  The world of the unicorn is so perfectly and lyrically described, I could see it clearly in my mind's eye, and found myself rereading passages over and over, blown away at the poetic perfection.  I love it when that happens. :)  I am 36 years old and had never read it before, but rented the movie numerous times as a young child.  Happily, time had erased the memory of it(and the awful soundtrack by \\"America\\")so I was able to enjoy the book with a fresh perspective, uncluttered by someone else's visual perception of the story.  I highly recommend this book for those old and young alike.  For me, this is right up there with the Hobbit.
B001NP8PQW|5.0|This concert is really great. bluray video quality was pretty good , sound quality was also very good. A must have concert for any CURE fan.
B000NQR7R0|5.0|This is everything you like about the Spaghetti Western sound tracks with a rock beat and present day production values.  Not every song rocks hard, but they're all good.  Definitely a south of the border flavor.  It comes with a short DVD with two live performances.  If you like this, get the soundtrack from \\"Once Upon a Time in Mexico\\".
B000GCFO0I|4.0|Sadly, a film of this genre is often simply an excuse to engage in special-effects excess, and, in terms of any positive content, very little else. Fortunately, this title brings much more to the table. Yes, there are special effects in Silent Hill, but they are actually quite understated, and they never become self-indulgent or otherwise upstage the cast. The mood and feel of the video game is present, but the film's story is entirely accessible to everyone, game-player or not. The performances are generally solid throughout, with little to nit-pick about. Clearly, this sort of film isn't everyone's cup of tea, but most horror film fans should be very pleased. This is a tight little gem of a horror movie.
B000002SE0|5.0|This is a great recording of Turandot - heartily recommended.  My only warning is that if you buy the CD it does NOT come with an English Libretto.  The Libretto is all in Italian.  So you'll have to get a libretto separately if you want to follow along as you listen.  The only libretto that I've been able to find that's sold separately that's any good is from the Ricordi' Collection.  I found one for under $2 on eBay.    Enjoy the opera!

0385751893|5.0|If you have a deep interest about The Holocaust and what occurred this book is for you. I would recommend this read for anyone who would like to learn more about The Holocaust or doesn't mind books that don't have necessarily happy endings but a lessson.
B001FB55MG|5.0|This Adam Sandler movie is wonderful family fare.  It is whimsical, fun and ends just the way you would want it to if you'd written it yourself!
B0000009SY|5.0|Joe's Garage is perhaps the crowning achievement of Mr. Zappa. The sheer genious of the entire piece is indisputable. Shimmering beauty in two discs. Thanks Frank!!!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I purchased this DVD to use at home on days when I cannot get to the gym. I felt more results in 20 mins than I have after being at the gym for an hour! Jillian definitely delivers. But follow her advice and start at level I.  I was so sore the day after I started this that I had to go down the steps on my butt! Definitely worth the money! And mine shipped to me in 2 days (with ground shipping) If you want to feel results quickly, this the way to do it!
B0000009SF|5.0|Zappa plays jazz and brings and incredible ensemble along for the ride. If you don't like Zappa's vocal works then this is probably the one for you. Beautiful big band harmonies with zero filler. Simply phenomenal. The man was ahead of his time.
