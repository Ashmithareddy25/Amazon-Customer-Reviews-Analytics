B0018RFLN0|1.0|This movie is the worst of modern movie making: big budget, small art. I couldn't wait for it to be over.
B004U8VUUC|5.0|I got so caught up in the story and how creepy the lead character is that I forgot it was based on a true story.  I had to wonder if the man killed his wife and used a friend to cover it up as the story claims, or he dressed like a woman to cover it up himself.  What a twisted little story.  Great movie.  Not too gory, just enough suspense.
B0031YJFCQ|3.0|The first 20% of the book was a complete review of the 2nd book and I was bored. Through the first 50% was long and boring and went on and on, mostly repetition.<br /><br />The book picked up in the final quarter of the book and was rather decent. The final quarter of the book resembled the first two books that were hard to put down. However, the final 5% of the book was a complete let down. I wanted a grand finally, and it was a vanilla ending.<br /><br />If you read the first two, you need to finish the series, but don't expect it to be as good as the first two.
0439023513|2.0|Loved the first two books, in which the character development and treatment were excellent. Mockingjay created characters and disposed of them with nary a care to the reader impact. I could go on and on about this, but scores of other reviewers already have. This has nothing to do with the major shift in gears to make social or philosophical points, or to depress with the fact that war is indeed hell, that good and evil, right and wrong often present difficult, and ambiguous choices. My problem is that you do not need to rush through the book, obliterate caring about characters, and write patently absurd, quickly scribbled, battle scenes in the pursuit of making a statement. This book could have easily joined the first two as a wonderful part of a continuing saga if the author, for whatever reason, did not abandon what she started and write as if she were under a newspaper deadline.
B0002IQHY8|4.0|Alan Parsons has had a reputation for a certain sound that has pervaded Alan Parsons Project albums/CDs from the 70s-80s and even after breaking away from Eric Woolfson after their final \\"Gaudi\\" CD.  This CD is different and I actually like the change: it seems to have spirit and excitement that has been waning of late and it causes me to look forward to the next CD from Mr. Parsons and his new collaborators.<br /><br />Does this CD change the formula? Well, yes.  Does it lose its identity.  Well, no I don't believe so.  I like to hear the music updated to reflect more current styles and this CD certainly does that.  If you don't like The Crystal Method and related styles, then you probably won't like this one. But if you like electronic dance music with \\"something extra\\" that's a bit orchestral or literately themed in flavor, then I'd recommend this one.<br /><br />Note that this CD is \\"loud\\" or said another way, the dynamics are fairly highly compressed (see the \\"DR Database\\" site for details).
B005CKPQ7A|5.0|Very captivating and hard to wait for the new releases.  This show is addicting.  Nothing more need be said ;about the matter. So why take up more time just to make twenty stupid words.
B0055MITE2|5.0|I love my old Tevas.  I've had them for 12 years and worn them frequently.  They finally started to fall apart last summer.  A quick repair of the sole with \\"Household Goop\\" and they lasted me another year.  But the time had clearly come to replace them.  I selected this model because other reviewers said they were just like classic Tevas.  Exactly what I was looking for and exactly correct.  I've been wearing the new Tevas for most of a week now, and from day 1 they were comfortable.  They are just as comfortable as my classic Tevas were.  In fact, I have several times been surprised to look at my feet and see I am wearing the new pair rather than the old.  I am looking forward to a decade or so of wearing this pair.

B005KWL2IW|4.0|The changing lineup of singers in Anthrax has been the subject of debate among metalheads but for this fan, I'm glad to see Joey Belladonna back in.  While this recording suffers from poor mastering (a casualty of the loudness wars), This may be one of the best recordings (musically) ever produced by Anthrax and Joey shows just how well his voice mixes with Anthrax's style.<br /><br />I first picked up Anthrax when their Armed and Dangerous EP came out in the early 80's.  I considered them one of the most promising metal bands back in the day but lost interest with Bring The Noise and Joey's departure.  This one brings it all back for me.<br /><br />By the way, I converted the digital format by applying a slight volume reduction and a few EQ tweaks.  You can't help the lousy mastering (garbage in, garbage out) but the EQ tweaks make a difference when playing at eleven!
B00466HN6S|3.0|This family film wamts to be loved and makes you smile but it will never be a classic because of its lightweight acting and flimsy script. I enjoyed and will probably watch it again someday.  Still, it was only slightly above-average.
B0008ENHUI|1.0|This movie is about a man who is incarcerated unfairly. At least, that's his story and he stuck to it. He is sentenced to a harsh, brutal, horrible French penal colony and the film narrates his many attempts to escape. Almost the entire movie demonstrates how violent and harsh the prison is. You see prisoners beaten, abused, and killed...and that's just by the prison guards. Don't get me started on the fellow prisoners. I kept waiting for something good to happen to the protagonist. WARNING: SPOILERS. When the movie is almost completed we see 5 minutes of a successful escape until he's thrown back in the hoosegow. We then see more abuse until finally in the last TEN SECONDS of the film, a narrator tells us the protagonist successfully escapes. We don't even get to see him succeeding. You have to wade through hours of depressing experiences to finally get to that last 10 seconds. Ugh.

B001ZVJ1SA|5.0|I got this book years ago. It's one of those books that you reread over and over because the advice is so pure, sensible, and hits you a different way each time depending on what is going on in your life at the time. It's an entertaining read. It's written using the characters of Winnie the Pooh to illustrate what could be difficult to understand concepts. As a result, it's very easy to grasp. You don't feel assaulted, guilty or resistant either. I mean, it's Pooh! :) I highly recommend it for anyone doing soul searching or who just wants to understand life a bit better. I've given this book away as a gift over and over again. It's just one of those books that speaks to many people.

0451232577|3.0|I SO wanted to love FALL OF GIANTS. I approached it as I would a vast, inviting body of water and, unfortunately, the water turned out to be only an inch deep. There was little danger of pleasurably drowning in its vastness--or enjoying a full immersion reading experience.<br /><br />Ken Follett has been a favorite author of mine since his EYE OF THE NEEDLE became the benchmark for excellence in WWII espionage tales. That was a tough act to follow, but he didn't disappoint with THE KEY TO REBECCA, TRIPLE, or THE MAN FROM ST. PETERSBURG, to name just three of his subsequent offerings in that genre. Then he switched to another period in history and absolutely thrilled with PILLARS OF THE EARTH, which tackled a lesser known subject and made it fascinating through believable, embraceable characters.<br /><br />I expected more of the same from FALL OF GIANTS and didn't get it. Perhaps because the subject matter is not as esoteric as the building of the great cathedrals, FOG reads like a textbook at times; perhaps because there are too many, none of the characters are fully realized. These one-dimensional characters are stereotypes and the story linking them to actual events is predictable, hackneyed even.<br /><br />Mr. Follett's ambitious attempt to examine and make accessible the myriad defining issues of the early twentieth century does not quite work--others have done it better, with fewer words. I nevertheless respect this attempt and recommend FALL OF GIANTS to those who have not set their expectations too high.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The second book of the trilogy is what I expected. Awesome! E.L. James may not be a great writer but she sure makes the reader fall in love with the characters.  Once I read Fifty Shades of Grey, I immediately purchased this book and was not disappointed! Enjoy!!!

It has the handy option to save a photo of the fish so that you can share what you have caught. My only complaint is that to cast the lure you have to throw your phone/tablet foward. If you are using a heavy tablet, this could give you a better workout then Wii Fit. But it is a great fishing game for a portable system.
0345803485|1.0|I, like so many other readers who have left negative reviews, fell into this \\"novel\\" due to the overwhelming pressure from social networking (should have been the first red flag!) and clips overheard here and there from women who apparently have no idea what good literature, much less good erotica, even looks like.<br /><br />I forced myself to finish this book simply because I had to justify paying $10 for it on Kindle.  That act alone makes me more of a Sado-masochist than any of the characters in this piece of drivel.<br /><br />Consider yourself warned if you purchase this book for any amount of money.  Unless you pick it up out of a trash bin, or find it at someone's house and do them the favor of relieving them of its presence, DO NOT read this book.  It's painfully repetitive (if I ever read another \\"Oh My!\\" it will be too soon), fantastically unbelievable (I can believe in Twilight more than this book), and has a plot so empty and vapid that it makes the Kardashians & Snooki's of the world look like full blown self-sacrificing humanitarians.<br /><br />Besides all that, the \\"erotica\\" in this book is probably the most boring, yawn-inducing crap I've ever had the displeasure of forcing myself to read.  I think I may spank myself more for trying to read the second book (I quit halfway through, unable to deal with the torture...).  Maybe that's the joke?

B004QOB8SY|5.0|In the first series, the 2d and 3d episodes did not, I thought, quite live up to the promise of the first. Not because of the actors, but because of the script. In the 2d series, all three stories are strong. As before, Cumberbatch and Freeman are naturals as Sherlock and Watson. Better still, their friendship, a more important element than in previous iterations (including the Brett & Burke/Hardwicke series) is played to perfection, and is arguably the chief element of this series' success.

B001CZVVWI|5.0|This production of The Barber of Seville from 2005 was made at Madrid's Teatro Real which seems particularly appropriate for an opera set in Spain. There is, throughout this performance, a very Spanish variety of energy with background characters moving about with references to Spanish dance movements and postures which also feature strongly at the conclusion of the opera.<br /><br />The setting is very stylish and strikingly clean-cut with much use made of black and white colour schemes.  Stage sets are moved in full view of the audience and are moved in such a way as to become part of the performance. The period is not precise but has an 18th century aura about it but seen very much through a stylised modern viewpoint. I found this to be very effective. The predominantly black and white colour scheme changes dramatically at the end with a festive burst of colour which adds significantly to the celebratory feel of the finale complete with .<br /><br />The cast are uniformly excellent with a strong sense of fun being created. This is apparent between Figaro and Almaviva, between Figaro and Rosina and also extends to individual roles such as Bartolo, Don Basilio and the maid Berta who also sings her aria in act 3 especially well. Florez is very much billed as the star of this production and he is on very good form vocally and clearly enjoys his role in this production. A surprise addition is his extended final aria, normally heard at the end of Cinderella, which brings to tumultuous applause. However, he by no means otherwise outshines Pietro Spagnoli as Figaro who comes over as a particularly strong characterisation. He is also a particularly good singer who easily copes with the range and the speed of the vocal challenges. I would go so far as to suggest that this is one of the best musical performances of this role that I have yet seen.<br /><br />Maria Bayo makes a fine Rosina with secure vocal technique and a good dramatic sense. She is also young enough and attractive enough for her to be believably attractive to Count Almaviva. Too often the singers chosen for this role are unlikely to appeal in these ways and therefore undermine the necessary suspension of disbelief for the story to work dramatically. Bartolo, in this performance, is more youthfully vigorous than in some performances which portray him as far past his prime. The role here is portrayed as more blustering and lightweight so his acceptance of rejection at the conclusion comes as no surprise to either him or the audience.  Don Basilio, performed by Ruggero Raimondi, is a reliable portrayal and the signature `scandal' aria in act 1 comes over well.<br /><br />The chorus support the main character parts with good singing and characterisation and the orchestra play well under the attentive guidance of the conductor, Gianluigi Gelmetti.<br /><br />The camera work and imaging quality are of a high standard as is the sound reproduction. The sound is presented in DTS 5.0 and stereo and is of good range and fidelity.<br /><br />The is a 16 minute bonus film which takes a look backstage and a full-length documentary, `The Useless Precaution', during which the cast and the director provide a detailed introduction to the opera. This is well-worth watching and offers far more depth than is often the case.<br /><br />Overall this can be described as a particularly stylish production with first class musical values couples with a strong forward momentum and strong dramatic characterisations. There is a winning sense of fun maintained throughout and the whole was much appreciated by the audience.  For these reasons I would expect most purchasers of this disc to share that enjoyment and to find this a very good production and performance.

0345803485|1.0|So after being on a very long waiting list to check this book out.  I was excited to finally get it.  I've heard so much about how it's so hot and husbands everywhere are happy their wives were reading it.  Apparently it was so dirty it's even been banned in a couple places.  Yeah, I think someone forget to tell the author what makes a book erotic.  First of all, Ana sounds like a teenager. \\"He touched me there\\"  \\"And then he was there\\".  There? Really?  Since when did the word \\"there\\" become so erotic that women everywhere were jumping their significant others.  The so called love scenes leave much to be desired.  I've read more explicit stuff in books that weren't even considered erotic, so why is this book getting so much attention.  The love scenes were tame compared to authors like Victoria Dahl and Linda Howard.<br />Then comes the abuse.  How is this guy even considered to be a leading man. He spanks the girl with a belt for daring to roll her eyes at him?  As a woman I can't imagine how anyone other than abusers themselves can think this is a turn on.<br />This book was horribly written, even without the abuse angle, the author is repetitive as many have pointed out.<br />I wonder, if this was a book all to itself without no connection to the Twilight series, would it have even gotten so much attention?
B0073LWEXK|4.0|at first I was addicted to it and I thought it was the greatest game.  now I do not think so because I am stuck at the way end. I have tried using the hints but it does not help. I have asked my aunt mom dad grandma and grandpa to help but they were stuck too.
B004EPYZSU|4.0|The film is called \\"Cowboys and Aliens\\" and that's exactly what you get.  It carries a bit more serious tone than you'd think given such a title but at its core, its a solid comic-book style storyline.  I read some reviews saying it was slow and badly acted.  I disagree on both counts.  The pace moved well and the the acting was fine.  Harrison Ford comes through strong and the rest are acceptable.  it isn't academy award acting but again, its \\"Cowboys and Aliens\\".  Some reviews here have slammed the story.  Its a decent story that makes you care about the characters.  Nowhere do you have a \\"give me a break\\" moment and the tale draws you into the more fantastic elements slowly enough that the developments seem natural enough.<br /><br />The Western sets were exceptional.  The aliens acceptable (not great but not bad either).  The action was good and strong enough that except for one point in the film, it didn't have the video game feel that is so common in action films that rely on computer graphics.<br /><br />The bad points of the film are that a few of the plot twists are a bit too convenient.  If you view this as something other than a comic book storyline, you'll be scratching your head.  If you recognize it for what it is, you'll enjoy a good, fun film.<br /><br />I wish they made more movies like this.

B004DIPLQS|4.0|It is obvious that opinion is divided over this issue. Generally the Kissin contribution is considered outstanding by any standards. This is true - he fairly sizzles throughout the concerto then completely ignites for the encores!<br /><br />Demidenko, on the other hand, has disappointed many purchasers, largely for not delivering the same type of brilliance. This is an easily understood reaction but I am not sure that it is quite fair to Demidenko (or maybe even Chopin!).<br /><br />My personal view is that Demidenko is essentially deliberately taking a more introverted and reflective view than is often presented. This is particularly apparent in the first movement which is surprisingly lacking in show but definitely not lacking in musicianship. The second movement is by nature gently lyrical and this suits Demidenko who then produces plenty of light, rhythmical lift and lilt in the third movement whilst still avoiding superficial glitter. I have found it to be perfectly satisfying on its own terms and over repeated viewing. It seems to me to be a viable alternative view - especially if you already have a livelier, more regular approach in your collection (and there are many to choose from).<br /><br />As mentioned in the opening paragraph, Kissin gives an altogether livelier account of the second concerto and one will which immediately appeal. There is an altogether captivating blend of extrovert virtuosity and sensitivity throughout all three movements and this results in considerable appreciation from the packed audience. Kissin then goes on to give two encores with all the same characteristics. These more outwardly showy and very popular pieces, an etude and a waltz, contrast once again with the quiet and reflective mazurka chosen by Demidenko as his encore.<br /><br />The recording has clear imaging and sympathetic camera work. The sound is presented in DTS-HD surround and stereo and has great clarity. The Polish orchestra plays this music under the capable direction of Antoni Wit with all the familiarity that one would expect.<br /><br />So in general summary, in my opinion it is probably best to see this as one obvious winner and one possible alternative view which you may, or may not, share. It seems to me that 4 stars is a fair rating bearing in mind all the above.rection of Antoni Wit with all the familiarity that one would expect.<br /><br />So in general summary, in my opinion it is probably best to see this as one obvious winner and one possible alternative view which you may, or may not, share.

6305428050|5.0|One disaster follows another in \\"Adventures in Babysitting\\" when the eponymous heroine discovers that the road to Hell is paved with good intentions. This hilarious comedy about a babysitter who finds herself and her brood up to their collective necks in trouble as they try to flee from a gang of desperate Chicago criminals is worth watching more than once. Future \\"Harry Potter\\" director Chris Columbus made his directorial debut with this roller-coaster 99-minute opus that never wears out its welcome. Similarly, Shue has her first starring role as the babysitter, and the role fits her as snugly as a shoe. Not only is Shue sympathetic but she is also charismatic. Meanwhile, Columbus stages several exciting scenes in this Touchstone Films release that will have you perched on the edge of your seat. \\"Adventures in Babysitting\\" was one of the first major theatrical films to conclude its end credits with a scene related to the action.<br /><br />Everything starts innocently enough as our heroine, 17-year old Chris Parker (Elizabeth Shue of \\"Molly\\"), is waiting on her dream date and singing the song \\"And Then He Kissed Me.\\" Chris worships the ground that her narcissistic boyfriend treads; the tag on the front of his Camaro reads: \\"So Cool.\\" Nevertheless, she is crushed when Mike Todwell (Bradley Whitford) arrives and informs her that he has to cancel their date. According to Mike, he must stay at home with his sick sister. Reluctantly, Chris agrees to babysit a neighbor's children. Chris' best friend Brenda (Penelope Ann Miller) decides to run away from home and winds up trapped in a bus stop where homeless people terrorize her. Somebody steals Brenda's glasses, and she is absolutely destitute. She calls Chris from a pay phone and pleads with Chris to rescue her. Naturally, the Anderson kids that Chris is sitting, 15-year-old Brad (Keith Coogan of \\"Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead\\") and 8-year-old Sara (Maia Brewton of \\"Back to the Future\\"), are game for a road trip from their Oak Park suburbs into Chicago. Chris takes her mom's station wagon. Brad's best friend Daryl Coopersmith (Anthony Rapp), who has a crush on Chris, manages to persuade them to let him ride with them. No sooner do our heroes get into Chicago than they blow a tire. To make matters worse, Chris doesn't have a dime and they rely on the kindness of strangers, specifically \\"Handsome\\" John Pruitt (John Ford Noonan) who drives a wrecker with one hand. The kids freak out when they see his metal clipper of a fist. They also freak out when they look into the glove compartment and find a gun. Pruitt tells Chris that he will change her flat tire for free. On the way to Dawson's Garage, Pruitt receives a call on his CB about his wanton wife and cruises past his residence. Indeed, Pruitt discovers that his wife is cheating on him.<br /><br />While Pruitt storms the house, Chris and company leap into another car. They catch an African-American thief, Joe Gipp (Calvin Levels), as he is boosting the Cadillac. The villains lock the kids up for safekeeping in an upstairs room while they continue to plot their future crimes. When Daryl joined our heroes originally, he had a Playboy magazine with a centerfold layout that is the spitting image of Chris. The Playboy belonged to Daryl's father and he lost it. Miraculously, Daryl finds the same magazine and takes it. The catch is that the Playboy magazine that Daryl takes contains secret information about a car-hijacking schedule. Before the rollicking evening concludes, Chris and her charges wind up in a skyscraper where--as it turns--Sara's parents are attending a party.<br /><br />One of the funniest scenes shows Chris and the kids being pursued by bad guys after they escape from their garage. They get away by climbing into the rafters. Chris, Brad, Sarah, Daryl walk softly along I-beams as they pass over the villains as the bad guys have a heated discussion. Our heroes escape through a hole in the roof and the criminals spend the remainder of the film chasing them. This has got to be one of the most suspenseful scenes in the entire film. Later, our heroine and company duck into the nearest door, only to find themselves on stage at a blues music club called The Silver Dollar Room. According to the well-known blues musician Albert Collins, they must sing a blues song. The improvisation ranks as one of the highlights of the narrative.<br /><br />Interestingly enough, \\"Adventures in Babysitting\\" was the first PG-13 movie that Disney released.e remainder of the film chasing them.

0374275637|2.0|I began to read this book with high expectations: economics, psychology and the Nobel prize coming together.  Unfortunately, after wading through more than 350 pages I must say the content of this book is fairly close to zero. Let me summarize it for you: (1) People are not statistical computers (2) people use available context to formulate a response. There.  Much cheaper than buying the book and wasting your time.<br /><br />In defense of all humans let me state the following: the whole framing around psychology tests is itself a set-up for creating \\"interesting\\" results. Why would anyone ask the question about \\"Linda\\" in this silly way? It seems to me the second option ( where she is a feminist bank teller ) is where the questioner is giving me a hint. This is how helpful human conversations work.  So in spite of the probabilities, I would pick the second.  After all, there must be some reason why the benign questioner picked that one qualifier of Linda among many.  You can extend  this to the earthquake example.<br /><br />Good luck.

B00004R72K|5.0|Prequel: It is not possible for reviewers to write separate reviews of the single and of the two disc deluxe versions even though they are not the same. This is a listing arrangement beyond the control of reviewers. Consequently this review covers both options together so please be patient and extract whichever information applies to your particular interests. Thanks, Ian Giles.<br /><br />.....................................<br /><br />This original version of the original three tenors concerts given in Rome in 1990 was much copied but never matched for the sense of a unique and very special occasion. The actual recording is given good sound presented in stereo and DD 5.1 surround sound. The imaging is adequate by today's standards on close ups and only breaks up on distance shots. The camera work itself gives a good sense of immediacy and involvement - probably much better than being there at the time!<br /><br />The selection of music, largely from opera and operetta, is unashamedly popular and is performed with total skill and a performance-aware delivery that positively invites increasingly enthusiastic audience support. All three singers are in good voice, probably more so than on the sequence of such concerts that followed. It would be easy for this to become a competitive activity, and so it is to a degree, but all three men are able to unite for the two encores - two Pavarotti specials ('O sole mio' and 'Nessun dorma') that are shared out between them with great camaraderie. Otherwise any competition is good humoured and fully understood as an essential ingredient to a very joyous occasion.<br /><br />Everyone who buys this disc will have favourites in terms of aria and in terms of singer. Nevertheless, it would be hard to imagine anyone experiencing disappointment. Both Mehta and his orchestra accompany with evident enjoyment, rising to the occasion, including the orchestra only items which give the singers a bit of a 'breather' and add a touch of aural variety.<br /><br />The booklet in the original single disc version provides all the texts and other basic information. The later 'deluxe' two disc set, published in 2007, provides subtitles which is a far preferable option to the supplied texts of the first version.

B00125WAWS|3.0|The setting is interesting, the story is good and the subject is important. However the movie as a whole I found boring. But should have known that from the title: lots of talking.
0767803434|4.0|Any resemblance between President Bill Clinton and the Harrison Ford Chief Executive in Wolfgang Petersen's far-fetched, entertaining, but woefully predictable skyjacking saga \\"Air Force One\\" ends when Ford's fantastic First Guy starts knocking off the villains. Nevertheless, the parallels between Clinton and Marshall appear clearly obvious. Harrison Ford's President James Marshall is married to a tenacious, headstrong wife in the Hilary mode, and they have a 12-year old daughter. (So was Bill Pullman's president in \\"Independence Day.\\") Unlike Clinton, President Marshall flew helicopter rescue missions in Vietnam and received a Medal of Honor. No, the filmmakers refuse to identify President James Marshall's party affiliation, which make \\"Air Force One\\" impartially political, while it trumpets America's anti-terrorist stance.<br /><br />Andrew W. Marlowe's melodramatic screenplay shows more agility than innovation. While his characters emerge as largely one-dimensional stick figures, the dimensions of their predicaments assume nothing less than cataclysmic proportions. Marlowe's script keeps Harrison Ford leaping through enough flaming hoops to fill three movies. Like several other summer blockbusters, Marlowe's script does not know when to throw in the towel. Just about everything that can happen aboard \\"Air Force One\\" occurs. Presumably, with the recent spate of skyjacking movies, it was only a matter of time before Hollywood appropriated both Air Force One and the President as the pulp of their fictional escapade.<br /><br />The movie opens in slam-bang style with an elite American commando team parachuting into Kazakhstan at night. Using the latest hi-tech gear, they kill the palace guards and abduct an adversarial Russian leader, General Radek (Jurgen Prochnow of \\"Das Boot\\"), who is promptly incarcerated in a Soviet hoosegow. Three weeks later in Moscow, President Marshall stipulates that the U.S. refuses to negotiate with terrorists. Meanwhile, a ruthless ultra-nationalist Radek zealot, Ivan Korshunov (Gary Oldman of \\"True Romance\\"), succeeds in smuggling his bogus TV news crew aboard the most secure plane in the world. A disgruntled Secret Service agent, Gibbs (Xander Berkeley of \\"L.A. Takedown\\"), as we later learn, helped these guys obtain their security clearance. Once the plane is airborne, Korshunov and his men commandeer it, kill the pilots, and watch helplessly s the president ejects in his escape pod. (Does anybody remember \\"Escape from New York?\\") Ivan contacts the Vice President (Glenn Close) and vows to kill a hostage every half-hour until Radek walks away from prison. According to Defense Secretary Walter Dean (Dean Stockwell), Radek's release would bring down the pro-American regime in the Kremlin and bring back the Cold War, so the Russians are reluctant to set him free unless President Marshall makes the request personally for Radek's release.<br /><br />The filmmakers cannibalize in typical Hollywood fashion every neat idea from all the other skyjacking thrillers. Generally, \\"Air Force One\\" follows the formula of the Kurt Russell hit \\"Executive Decision.\\" Both movies start with a commando raid and then shift to terrorists hijacking a jetliner before an unconventional hero makes his entry. You can tell that Marlow evidently watch the Wesley Snipes thriller \\"Passenger 57\\" for one scene. Another scene features a stunt that appeared in both \\"Airport 75\\" and \\"Cliffhanger.\\" The president here imitates the action heroes from the Bruce Willis \\"Die Hard\\" franchise and the Steven Seagal \\"Under Siege\\" movies. Finally, the \\"Air Force One\\" ending should come as no surprise to any \\"Star Trek\\" movie veterans. Anybody who thrives on movies like an insomniac will spot these plot elements. Although \\"Air Force One\\" borrows heavily from other epics, the staging of the action and some new scenes in the skyjacking formula boost this opus over the rough spots.<br /><br />Anybody familiar with German director Wolfgang Petersen will recognize the affinity between \\"Air Force One\\" and his earlier classic U-boat thriller \\"Das Boot\\"/\\"The Boat\\" (1981). The casting of \\"Das Boot\\" star Jurgen Prochnow as the heinous General Radek aids in this comparison. Moreover, Petersen sends his highly mobile and energetic cameras plunging about the corridors of \\"Air Force One\\" with the same dexterity that they swept through the hull of the sub in \\"Das Boot.\\" Despite a connect-the-dots plot, Petersen makes every dot a fire storm of intensity. The scene where the President's jet careens wildly across the airfield in Germany and nearly crashes is pretty harrowing.<br /><br />Ford's presidential protagonist is basically Indiana Jones in a suit and tie. The filmmakers rely on Ford's action hero charisma to compensate for the lack of depth in his inadequately sketched head of state. Shrewdly, they shift gears to the parental side of the chief executive. Ford's best scenes occur before take-off when he asks about his favorite football game. Although Marshall emerges as a cardboard politician, it's his \\"Die Hard\\" courage that wreathes him with laurels. Unlike those wimpy Jack Ryan movies \\"Patriot Games\\" and \\"A Clear and Present Danger,\\" Harrison Ford's hero here kills the villains. The bad guys don't slip out of Marshall's clutches and conveniently impale themselves on sharp objects. (Remember the way the \\"Patriot Games\\" villain died?) Marshall runs up a body count, kills with a machine gun, snaps necks, and slugs it out with rough and tumble adversaries. Ford is one of the few male box office stars who can shed tears (when Ivan threatens to pull the trigger on his daughter) and not make it look schmaltzy. Ford manages to maintain a stiff upper lip throughout \\"Air Force One\\" and his scenes with bad guy Gary Oldman crackle with electricity. Ultimately, however, Ford's performance qualifies as serviceable, nothing truly special like the cop the played in \\"The Devil's Own\\" (1997).<br /><br />The real casting coup in \\"Air Force One\\" is Glenn Close as Vice President Kathryn Bennett. Close manages to hold her own in a room packed with veteran male character actors like \\"Quantum Leap's\\" Dean Stockwell who constantly bullies Close to usurp presidential authority. Although certainly not the most original skyjacking melodrama, \\"Air Force One\\" manages to add elements to the formula and boasts enough visceral R-rated violence to keep you distracted throughout its 124-minute running time.ll recognize the affinity between \\"Air Force One\\" and his earlier classic U-boat thriller \\"Das Boot\\"/\\"The Boat\\" (1981).

The guy he's competing with is one of those mean-spirited people who says things that sting.

B000BAQ8A0|5.0|This production of The Barber of Seville from 2005 was made at Madrid's Teatro Real which seems particularly appropriate for an opera set in Spain. There is, throughout this performance, a very Spanish variety of energy with background characters moving about with references to Spanish dance movements and postures which also feature strongly at the conclusion of the opera.<br /><br />The setting is very stylish and strikingly clean-cut with much use made of black and white colour schemes.  Stage sets are moved in full view of the audience and are moved in such a way as to become part of the performance. The period is not precise but has an 18th century aura about it but seen very much through a stylised modern viewpoint. I found this to be very effective. The predominantly black and white colour scheme changes dramatically at the end with a festive burst of colour which adds significantly to the celebratory feel of the finale complete with .<br /><br />The cast are uniformly excellent with a strong sense of fun being created. This is apparent between Figaro and Almaviva, between Figaro and Rosina and also extends to individual roles such as Bartolo, Don Basilio and the maid Berta who also sings her aria in act 3 especially well. Florez is very much billed as the star of this production and he is on very good form vocally and clearly enjoys his role in this production. A surprise addition is his extended final aria, normally heard at the end of Cinderella, which brings to tumultuous applause. However, he by no means otherwise outshines Pietro Spagnoli as Figaro who comes over as a particularly strong characterisation. He is also a particularly good singer who easily copes with the range and the speed of the vocal challenges. I would go so far as to suggest that this is one of the best musical performances of this role that I have yet seen.<br /><br />Maria Bayo makes a fine Rosina with secure vocal technique and a good dramatic sense. She is also young enough and attractive enough for her to be believably attractive to Count Almaviva. Too often the singers chosen for this role are unlikely to appeal in these ways and therefore undermine the necessary suspension of disbelief for the story to work dramatically. Bartolo, in this performance, is more youthfully vigorous than in some performances which portray him as far past his prime. The role here is portrayed as more blustering and lightweight so his acceptance of rejection at the conclusion comes as no surprise to either him or the audience.  Don Basilio, performed by Ruggero Raimondi, is a reliable portrayal and the signature `scandal' aria in act 1 comes over well.<br /><br />The chorus support the main character parts with good singing and characterisation and the orchestra play well under the attentive guidance of the conductor, Gianluigi Gelmetti.<br /><br />The camera work and imaging quality are of a high standard as is the sound reproduction. The sound is presented in DTS 5.0 and stereo and is of good range and fidelity.<br /><br />The is a 16 minute bonus film which takes a look backstage and a full-length documentary, `The Useless Precaution', during which the cast and the director provide a detailed introduction to the opera. This is well-worth watching and offers far more depth than is often the case.<br /><br />Overall this can be described as a particularly stylish production with first class musical values couples with a strong forward momentum and strong dramatic characterisations. There is a winning sense of fun maintained throughout and the whole was much appreciated by the audience.  For these reasons I would expect most purchasers of this disc to share that enjoyment and to find this a very good production and performance.

B00361DR4Q|5.0|This production, performance and recording of La Traviata made under Maazel at La Scala intriguingly and especially comes into direct competition with Gheorghiu's own earlier d&eacute;but recording made with Solti conducting at Covent Garden. That is still much beloved by considerable numbers of collectors, many of whom take the view that it has established an unmatchable benchmark. Not everyone agrees of course.  There have, of course, been many other recordings made since then as well as before then but this review is going to concentrate on the merits of this new disc and comment on how it compares with the earlier recording.<br /><br />This is a traditional performance and shares that feature with the earlier recording. However, the stage space available at La Scala is much more generous and all three acts benefit from the extra room. The first act allows for a real sense of a large room devoted to providing pleasure and ease of movement for many guests. The second act gives an aura of luxurious spaciousness which seems appropriate to the story and the third act provides the opposite effect of a large desolate space also appropriate to the situation.<br /><br />Ramon Vargas is a good singer who is able to act and communicate a sense of real communication. There are others who may take a more dominant role but in this case he is rightly subordinate to Gheorghiu. Roberto Frontali is one of the most acceptable Giorgio Germonts that I have seen. This is a difficult role to portray as it is so unsympathetic to Violetta and probably especially contrary to modern mores. Nevertheless he brings authority without bombast and is both young enough to be a strong character yet old enough to expect and demand social respect.<br /><br />The remaining supporting roles are all well done with committed and believable acting combined by secure singing.  Equally, the chorus are in good voice with plenty of social interaction in the crowd scenes in acts 1 and 2. The ballet dancers make a good job of their gypsy and matador moment.<br /><br />The night really belongs to Gheorghiu though and in this performance she demonstrates a great advance of sheer dramatic delivery. The first act is fairly low key as appropriate to her role in the story but with act 2 she handles the relationships with the two Germonts superbly ending with a spine tingling and passionate plea not to forget her love for Alfredo as she prepares her departure from the act. The last act once more is a demonstration of `being' the role rather than acting the role. Throughout she is able to deliver all the big vocal moments and the audience are fully appreciative. This is an older woman's understanding of the part and, as such, is markedly more subtle than her earlier performance. That is one from a much younger and less sophisticated or experienced woman and is appropriate to the age she was then. In a nutshell, with these two recordings we are given the choice of either a young woman giving a fine young interpretation or an older woman giving a fine but more mature interpretation.<br /><br />The orchestral contribution under the experienced leadership of Maazel is quite the equal of that delivered by Solti and the Covent Garden team.<br /><br />What cannot be denied though, are the obvious advances in recorded technology where the imaging is richer with a greater range of colour. The earlier imaging suffers from over-contrasty imaging and a lack of detail on the highlights such as Violetta's ballroom dress (technically called `highlight burn-out). The sound is equally much fuller and is supplied in DTS 7.1 and stereo.<br /><br />The other extraordinary advantage the new disc has is one of price as currently it is available as a budget price disc - a sort of sampler for the Arthaus catalogue. This does, of course, makes it amazingly tempting to buy whether as the only version to have or as a second. Gheorghiu fans could therefore buy both performances and solve the choice issuethat way! Beware though - the older full-priced disc is still available and is by no means as attractive as this bargain disc. Order your copy with care therefore.<br /><br />In summary therefore, this is a disc that Gheorghiu fans should snap up without delay as it is bound to give them great pleasure as indeed the performance clearly gave the audience at La Scala. Others who are more tentative as regards recordings by Gheorghiu should still find this a very attractive proposition especially at its present tempting price. For all of these reasons it seems that this disc fully deserves a 5 star rating for those who are attracted to the cast and venue.available and is by no means as attractive as this bargain disc.

B007IXWL2C|4.0|Three books, numerous hours and a lot of thought later...<br /><br />I loved them. I won't lie. The story was captivating and I find myself having read the series through twice. Grammatically it wasn't great, it had repetitive phrases that I don't think were supposed to be as repetitive and as a Brit who writes a lot of American stuff I found too many British words to be comfortable.<br /><br />Ok so the book was written by a Brit, it should be understandable but really it isn't.<br /><br />The sex scenes make the book if they weren't there though these books could be set to GCSE students as \\"find the grammatical errors\\".<br /><br />I can't speak, really, my grammar is awful at the best of times however I am not a published author, I write online, its not the same!<br /><br />The relationship between Ana and Christian is abusive, I hadn't thought about it before but now I have I can definitely agree if Ana was my best friend and confided everything in me about a relationship like this I'd tell her to get out, get help, and soon before he went way to far and she ended up in hospital or worse.<br /><br />The book has popularity. That's clear by how many has been sold and how many people are still itching to read it. Myself, I only read it so I could see what the hype was about and the sex scenes ... well I've read worse so I don't know what the big deal was about!!!<br /><br />I am glad I read it though and I am sure once I run out of something else to read I'll pick the books up again and found myself as captivated as I was the first time around.

B002BZOVLG|5.0|This production of Cosi fan tutte was recorded at Glyndebourne in 2006 which was the first year of this production's staging there. The production by Nicholas Hytner is totally traditional in feel and this will come as a great relief to those who despair of the tendency of modern opera producers to feel the need to focus on their own inspiration rather than that of the plot and music. At no discernible point is either the plot or Mozart's inspiration compromised here. The period established in the production is completely reasonable as are the sets and costumes even though it is probably a little later than originally conceived. The conclusion of the opera brings an interesting twist which may warn us that playing with emotions may lead to unforeseen consequences.<br /><br />The period feel of the production is underpinned by the use of the aptly named Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment with their leader being appropriately named as Margaret Faultless. This choice of `authentic period' orchestra leads to much improved orchestral balance and timbres and, in the hands of conductor Ivan Fischer, a bitingly exciting delivery of the music, both instrumental and vocal. Although there will be those who will maintain that there is no actual way of being sure that this is what Mozart would have heard, in my opinion, the proof is in the listening and in this case the case for such an orchestra is made clearly enough.<br /><br />The cast is, without doubt, uniformly excellent and rise wonderfully well to the challenges of live performance in the context of the likely `authentic' sounds produced by the orchestra. The tempi are challengingly fast at times but never breathless and there is always time made for sensitivity, proper phrasing and moments of doubt and reflection.<br /><br />The two girls are perfectly cast with Miah Persson and Anke Vondung being a suitably lively and attractive pair of young women. Both obviously relish their respective roles as Fiordiligi and Dorabella and also each other's stage company and there is a good deal of naturally spontaneous-sounding humour provided for the audience to enjoy. This same free-wheeling behaviour is both encouraged and shared as directed in the plot by the excellent Despina performed by Ainhoa Garmendia. All three women are fully on top of the technical and musical demands of their roles and this enables them to `play' together.<br /><br />The three men are well up to this standard too with Ferrando and Guglielmo delivering multi-nuanced performances as appropriate along with their `friend' Don Alfonso. These roles are delivered with great flair by Topi Lehtipuu, Luca Pisaroni and Nicholas Rivenq respectively. As a group of six they seem to make a perfect combination and are certainly the best I have ever had the privilege to watch.<br /><br />There are short bonus items in the form of an illustrated synopsis and interviews with the conductor and producer as well as with some of the cast. There is also an animated cast gallery.<br /><br />The recording is particularly clear visually and gives great clarity and detail while still delivering on colour definition. The sound is equally fine with clearly defined detail both on stage and in the orchestra and with good balance. It is presented in both DTS 5.1 and stereo options.<br /><br />This is an exhilarating production and performance likely to give enormous pleasure upon repeat viewing. In my opinion this is one of the best Mozart discs I have yet to see or own and I have enjoyed it as such every time I have seen it in the years since I bought it. I am sure most future purchasers will have much the same responses and therefore a 5 star assessment seems completely appropriate.<br /><br />In summary therefore, I would suggest that this disc should warrant serious consideration from any potential purchaser.er's stage company and there is a good deal of naturally spontaneous-sounding humour provided for the audience to enjoy.

B000XUBFE2|5.0|Word lovers of The World Unite! Zusak's words are pure delight. His playful patterns, cadence and rythym create such a jubilation to the senses, for those of us who find the divine in linguistic uniqueness. Pretty awesome when \\"Death,\\" a Soul Carrier, is the narrator of what is, at the core, an oft told tale we all know too well, that of a world filled with naught but heartbreak, bleakness and woe.<br /><br />While some (obviously this excludes me and many others) readers do not \\"take\\" to Zusak's combination of \\"Death,\\" books, the love of books, the theft of books, along with genius word play and a young girl orphaned not by fate, really, as I prefer to call it Hate. The Hate so unfathomed, by any standard of normal, Hitlers Hate.<br /><br />And yes, she's a thief. She steals books. Not many, but she does catch the eye of Death, who takes no small pleasure watching her grow, all the while taking in her mettle, as she, whether guided by fate, hate or destiny certainly has the misfortune, as does a continent, as does the Soul Carrier, as do millions of souls, to be one of those immersed in the carnage of WWII.<br /><br />Markus Zusak pulls this off with aplomb. He's my kind of writer, that's one thing I do know for sure.

B001L7TDQ8|5.0|Daniel Barenboim makes his debut appearance at one of these celebratory concerts with this recording. He brings his usual affable personality to the occasion as well as his easy control over all matters musical.<br /><br />As usual there are a handful of first performances at this series of concerts and on this case they add up to six. One of these is the finale to Haydn's 45th symphony, known as `The Farewell'. The reason for this name is that Haydn chose to make this music to make the point that the court musicians were overdue to return home. The musical message took the form of various members of the orchestra scored to leave as the music progressed to the end, with just Haydn and one other remaining at the end. The message was understood then and was enjoyed by the Viennese audience now! This performance also marked the first opportunity to celebrate Haydn's bicentenary.<br /><br />Needless to say the remainder of the concert is equally enjoyable and of more normal fare typical of the occasion concluding with a suitably enthusiastic Radetzky March.<br /><br />There are 2 bonuses which allow for the ballet sequence to be viewed separately plus a 24 minute tour of Linz, the European Capital of Culture at the time of the recording.<br /><br />The recording delivers crisp HD imaging following the usual pattern of in-hall camera work interspersed with some outside scenes. The sound is clear and precise and is presented in both DTS and stereo. Those who are familiar with the work of the experienced Brian Large productions will know what to expect.<br /><br />I personally enjoyed this very much and feel that it is very much up with the best of a very successful series of similar concerts over the years. As such it should give great pleasure to a great number of people and 5 stars seems a fair assessment of its quality.

Whoever put this one together was on point about the often overlooked urban issues that take place under our noses everyday,when law enforcement and even some of the neighbors when passing by or even visit these communities,the stereotyping goes on display.The anti hero remind you of a young Denzel Washington in some of his scenes,the alien creature effects were cheesy but put to good use,it had a good sense of terror once the action took place, a overall good movie with social message to it...recommended viewing

B0038UNNBM|5.0|I have checked for a long time for a pool suitable for my son (14 months) and at least 2 to 3 of his friends.Overall we are very please with this pool.<br />This product is<br />Good: The thick floor, satisfactory size for (we have tried 4 infants between 14 to 18 months),  and the side is thick and at a good height and the rainbow top provides good shade.<br />Minus: Definitely needs a pump to inflate this (we tried to blow this and it took both of us at least 4 hours or more). We had some problems too bringing it outside after inflating it because of the rainbow (good to check the size of the door first).

B000UPSKO8|4.0|I have enjoyed this concert in general terms but found the previous Waldbuhne concert to be even more enjoyable.<br /><br />To my mind this concert suffers from two main problems: The first problem is a fundamental lack of variety in the pacing with a large proportion of slow items. The Waldbuhne concert, by way of example, shows that this need not be the case with far more variety throughout.<br /><br />The other problem for me on this disc is the 'performance' by Tezier. It is important in vocal music for the performer to communicate - with the character being sung to, the audience or both. Tezier does very little of any of these. Throughout his items the camera clearly shows his eyes focussing inwards to himself and not outwards to others. In this important regard I also find the four singers featured on the Waldbuhne concert to have far more interactive personalities both with each other and also with the large open-air audience.<br /><br />Returning to this current disc, all three of the other soloists communicate well with each other as appropriate. My favourite singer on this occasion is Garanca followed closely by Vargas and Netrebko.<br /><br />The orchestra plays well and is sympathetically conducted by Marco Armiliato. The imaging is crisp with good colour rendition. The camera work is supportive of the singers and the music. The sound is good and is presented in DTS-HD 5.1 and stereo.<br /><br />For those who warm to this group of singers and the chosen repertoire this will be a clear 5 star issue although I personally have some reservations as above. For those reasons I will stick to a more cautious 4 stars.
0345803485|2.0|I had heard so much about this book that I finally got it.  It took me about six weeks to come back to it after reading 4 or 5 pages because I couldn't believe how poorly written it was. I was seriously wondering if my girlfriends were illiterate or something.  Perhaps the author is using the metaphor of bad writing to go along with bad sex.  When I first started reading the sex scenes, it really turned me on.  It was very erotic.  But then it became so unbelievable and there was nothing except the weird sex.  I don't know, its an unusual book to see at Costco and an unusual book to see in the mass market.  The statement is that women want to read erotica.  How about we introduce them to something a little more substantial.

B000JJSRNY|5.0|I have owned this concert for several years now, first as a DVD then as a Blu-ray. Every time I watch it I find it to be utterly uplifting, so good that it is almost impossible to comment about it without seeming to be wildly extreme!<br /><br />The content of the concert is ideal with a perfect blend of variety, in mood and in pace and where the orchestral items form ideal bridging moments and are also excellent in themselves.<br /><br />In a concert of superlatives one can only really pick out the most memorable moments. The first memorable moment for me is Netrebko's dark and creamy `O mio babbino caro' but not for long! The very next number is Villazon's `Ah! Parais! Parais, aster de mon ciel' from Massenet's Le Mage and arguably the finest single track I have ever heard him sing.<br /><br />Domingo is not to be outdone as he raises the crowd to their collective feet in `No puede ser' from La tabernera del Puerto. Netrebko entrances everyone with Lehar's `My lips' and amazingly fills the stadium when she leaves the microphones at the end of Musetta's `Quando men vo' and the crowd clap enthusiastically through Rossini's `La Danza', once the preserve of Pavarotti.<br /><br />The orchestra is not to be outdone with a fine performance of Rossini's Semiramide Overture conducted by Marco Armiliato.<br /><br />Finally all three singers combine to enormous applause as they share Verdi's `Libiamo ne lieti calici' and Lehar's `Dein ist meinganzes Herz' and the camera, scanning across the packed audience at the end, even manages to pick out Gustavo Dudamel on his feet and cheering fit to burst like so many others.<br /><br />This entirely wonderful experience is captured in spectacular HD imaging and equally wide ranging sound presented in DTS-HD 5.1, DD 5.1 and stereo. The bonus is your own guaranteed pleasure! This has to be a 5 star issue and is truly phenomenal.
0920668372|5.0|Clearly there are plenty of reviews discussing Love You Forever, but I feel the need to chime in.<br /><br />One day during my college years (about 6 years ago) I was walking around Target's book and magazine section when something familiar caught the attention of my peripheral vision.  I turned and instantly recognized the book cover with that mischievous little boy getting into anything and everything.  Suddenly, I was overcome with all of these warm, nostaligic feelings and memories of storytime with my mom... ah, I'd give anything for those days of just being young and innocent and naive of all the world's ills... Anyways, I sat in the aisle of Target reading that book lol  I didn't care how silly I looked!  I then got up and put the book in my shopping cart in hopes that one day I would be able to build those same memories with my future children.<br /><br />I would recommend this children's book to anyone.  In fact, get a hardcover edition and add some engraving for a lifetime of warm, fuzzy nostalgia.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|That's why I gave the book 4 stars. I think the man was brilliant. He was a great visionary and a genius. He was a pioneer in the personal computer industry and he did \\"make a dent in the universe.\\" A BIG dent.<br /><br />People can say that he ripped off other peoples work such as MP3 players but SJ himself even admitted that \\"We didn't invent some of this stuff, we just found a way to make it better.\\" His demand for quality and perfection was second to none. I can relate. I spent 30+ years of my life building. I was a perfectionist. I drove people crazy. They hated me and loved me at the same time. I feel that SJ had that same relationship with the people who worked for him. I've been told by people who work for me \\"You are the biggest pain in the a$$ in the world. I wouldn't want anybody else but you to build my house.\\"<br /><br />I have used PC's and other related tech since 1992. I started using Apple products in 2008 and realized how much more superior their entire product line is over Dell, Gateway, Sony, and HP. The Microsoft OS can't shine a Mac's shoes. This was the result of a man who had a passion and was driven, much like myself. I know the passion. I know the drive. I know the journey to perfection. Because of that passion I enjoy pretty much anything written about Steve Jobs.<br /><br />As fas as the book itself, it's a must read if you are at all fascinated by this great man. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was personally, I don't care how acclaimed this author is, I don't think the book itself was that well written. Since I've become interested and fascinated with Apple products I have watched most of the Keynotes presented by SJ with great anticipation and enjoyment. I find myself hanging on to every word he says (not necessarily believing all of it but believing that he feels whatever he was talking about was the best ever...in his eyes) I have read much about him. I have been very much into tech myself for close to 20 years now and haveused extensively it in the building business. I have incorporated much of today's technology into the houses I've built. I the process I've learned how to build and network my own systems. I've learned what products are good and what's poor. I am one of those people that have to know how everything works. There pretty much isn't anything built in this world that I can't figure out how it works or how to fix it if it's broken.<br /><br />Since the construction industry has died in this economy I have trained and obtained several certifications in Computer Technology. With all of this knowledge and hands on experience I've come to understand the quality that Jobs has demanded into his products and how he obtained his goals through failures and success. The beginning of the book starts out giving you insight to all of that but the finer details fizzle out as the book goes along. That was disappointing to me. I wanted to know all of that. I kept waiting for some of that to appear but it never did. The book ended sort of leaving me a little more educated but with a hollow feeling like there was more to learn about him but I did not know what that was.<br /><br />All in all, I still say the book is a must read.

B001F1YBP8|5.0|This set of the Brandenburgs is performed in authentic style but on modern instruments. Abbado seems to do little except set the tempo, leaving the skilled and highly experienced players to get on with the details of the performances - surely the best solution to having a conductor in such music and in such company. Indeed, in the 6th concerto Abbado is not present on the stage at all. No doubt there has been much discussion beforehand with an agreed approach. The recorded performance here was one of several held during a concert tour of Italy.<br /><br />The most abiding impression left by this set of performances is the one of joy and exuberance. The tempi are all on the faster side and these make considerable demands upon the individual and corporate virtuosity of the players. This group of Abbado's Orchestra Mozart is well up to these demands with glances of pleasure passing between the players from time to time. There is also a strong sense of dance and this has a greatly positive effect throughout but especially for me in the first concerto which is the most enjoyable account I have ever heard. However, much the same can be experienced throughout the whole set of six concertos and, except for purists who may quibble with the use of modern instruments, this comes over as a very authentic set of performances - one that I am sure would have delighted Bach himself.<br /><br />Although this is a 'live' set, any sense of an audience being present is avoided until the last item - the second concerto, which ends in applause and an encore of the last movement. This encore is given with a sopranino recorder being used instead of the lower-pitched, and more normally used, treble recorder which is used in the preceding complete concerto performance. Both are effective in their different ways. The trumpet's last note is raised somewhat further than Bach wrote but to good bravura effect - an effect I have not heard since Denis Clift, my own trumpet teacher, did the same on the old EMI Menuhin recording of about 1960.<br /><br />The recording quality is excellent both sonically and visually. The imaging is both crisp and involving, vividly capturing the delight of the players. The sound is presented in PCM 5.1 and stereo.<br /><br />This set, complete on one disc, is both generous and highly enjoyable. For many it will be tempting to think of it as close to definitive if such a description could possibly be made. It seems only reasonable that it should receive a full 5 star rating therefore.hin recording of about 1960.    The recording quality is excellent both sonically and visually.

B004P96WJ0|4.0|This is a simple re-issue of the series of Mahler symphonies conducted by Abbado at Lucerne and as issued by Euroarts. It does not include the fine Mahler 9 recorded by the same team but issued on a different label. Most important for those concerned about the DTS sound of the second symphony, this box contains the re-mastered set based on the DVD DTS sound track. (The Blu-ray DTS soundtrack was unusable due to mechanical failure). The remainder of the set are the same as the remaining individual original issues on Blu-ray.<br /><br />Abbado has the enviable reputation of being one of the world's finest Mahler conductors. This has been further reinforced by his set of performances held at Lucerne with his hand-picked orchestra constituting the Lucerne Festival orchestra.<br /><br />This very large orchestra, apart from containing musicians of outstanding individual abilities, also lays great stress upon their empathy and experience with the world of chamber music. Thus is achieved the unusual combination of orchestral size allied to individual and corporate sensitivity. This suits Abbado's particular vision of Mahler and is apparent throughout this set of performances.<br /><br />Abbado's vision is very much a visionary approach. It may not suit everyone. Chailly, for example, takes a more traditional view in the sense that his orchestra plays more as a complete entity rather than as a set of chamber musicians. This is an over-simplification of course and there are many instances where Abbado's players play like a traditional orchestra and where Chilly's play as chamber soloists. Nevertheless the overall comparison of approach remains generally secure.<br /><br />I would suggest that this set constitutes a very strong set of interpretations and performances and that previous recording issues concerning mainly number 2 are now resolved to the point where they should not be a major negative factor.<br /><br />............................................<br /><br />Some dialogue from the comments section that may offer further help:<br /><br />Thanks for your review. I'm glad you noted that there were sound issues (problems) with the 2nd symphony. I'm not sure though what you mean by saying the problems had been resolved. It happened that #2 was the first work I watched/listened to, and I thought there was something wrong with my equipment. This was reinforced by all the glowing comments about the sound on this set. I have not finished my journey through all four of these discs yet, but I have the separate disc of the 9th Symphony and I love that blu-ray.

B003HYSSZK|3.0|Each doctor brings something different to the table so it's not easy to compare them.<br /><br />9th doctor: Christopher Eccleston was strong in showing the darkness of the last of the time lords, but when it came to showing light heartedness he would sometimes be caught forcing his facial expressions.<br /><br />10th doctor: David Tennant was strong in showing vulnerability and his sadness and lonliness was palpable to the audience. but again there was sometimes forcing of his facial expressions during scenes where he was showing intense shock or anger.<br /><br />11th doctor: Matt Smith does not force his acting at all. There's no pushing and it comes across as natural at all times. He is especially strong in showing the doctor's lighthearted madness.  For many this might make him the best performer out of the three and therefore the best doctor; however, he lacks vulnerability in his approach. With the two previous actors you could often see the despair, lonliness and fear that the doctor holds inside- for them the madness the doctor portrayed was often an attempt to hide these vulnerabilities.  Where as Matt Smith's doctor seems to just be somewhat mad...simply because he is mad.  And to his credit Smith portrays this very well actually, but it's not as interesting because it was the doctor's vulnerability that made him so easy to relate to even though he is an alien time lord from outer space that travels in a 1960's police box.  There are so many scenes where Smith chooses not to show any fear in the face of danger, while Tennant and Eccleston often did.  If the doctor isn't scared about what's about to happen then why should the audience care what's going to happen?  I found myself drifting in my attention sometimes.  The main problem I see is the writing in seasons 5 & 6 is significantly less interesting than it was during Tennant's reign as the doctor, which means Matt Smith has less rich material to work with. (Not always- \\"The God Complex\\" in season 6 forinstance is a well written episode). Season 6 is better than Season 5 but in general I feel they are both just shadows of previous seasons.  The doctor is a very different character than he was before.  All of a sudden, \\"The doctor lies\\" all the time.  So what is he now, House M.D.??  The previous doctors didn't like lying at all and the few times he did lie about a serious issue it bothered him. When he lied and told Martha (season 3 motorway episode) that Gallifrey still existed he was struggling with his guilt the entire episode and said so- until the end of the episode where he admited the lie and told her the truth.  It doesn't fit dr. who and it just makes him less likeable.  This doctor Who doesn't seem like he has a different face, but rather that it's an entirely different character and show altogether.

B000BP5V0S|4.0|2006 marked the 250th anniversary of Mozart's birth so this concert was special in so far as it was the first opportunity to mark the occasion. It was also Janson's debut appearance with the VPO at the New Year's Day concerts and he is able to mark the occasion with a few well-chosen words in his brief speech before the traditional Blue Danube encore. These go down very well and increase the `feel good' element as the concert draws to a close.<br /><br />The Mozart anniversary is here celebrated by performances of the Marriage of Figaro Overture followed by Lanner's Die Mozartisten Waltz making its debut appearance at these concerts. This waltz is based on Mozartian themes which makes it easy to feel familiar.<br /><br />Indeed this concert is also unusual in so far as it includes no fewer than 6 works never previously played at a New Year's Day concert. As usual there is a novelty item and this case it features Janson's mobile phone which makes a fake appearance at the end of Eduard Strauss's `Telephon' polka francais much to the amusement of the audience. From this point the mood relaxes and there is a greater feel of the celebratory nature of the occasion.<br />As always the orchestra plays the music superbly whilst being a little less Viennese than in some other years. Austrians such as Boskovsky, Karajan, Kleiber and Harnoncourt and even non-Austrians like Ozawa or Pretre are all able to bring this out in a way that is not quite so apparent here. This is not to say that this is not so enjoyable - just less Viennese!<br /><br />The camera work is well up to the familiar and usual standards of Brian Large and his team and the sound is presented in DD 5.1, DTS 5.1 and stereo. There is a bonus in the form of a 23 minute travelogue without script but with a Mozart soundtrack of excerpts in broad chronological order ending appropriately with his Requiem. This film shows a considerable range of exotic residences, gardens and religious venues in the best possible way under the title of `Mozart 06'. There is also a smattering of images of Mozart and his manuscripts interspersed amongst the venues. This is a very attractive film but some detailed explanation somewhere of the precise relevance of the chosen venues and features beyond their titles would have added to its value in my opinion.<br /><br />This is all very enjoyable and well played and recorded but in my opinion fall just a shade below the extraordinary levels set by some of the predecessors. For that reason it seems to me to be fair to rank it just a notch below at 4 stars. This is a personal opinion of course and I would not argue with those who would prefer the full 5 star grade.nder the title of `Mozart 06'.

B001CZVVXW|5.0|This Royal Opera production, in superb Blu-ray or DVD formats, features a darkly aggressive Carmen with mutual hatred and a desire to destroy brought out strongly. This approach is made far more effective by use of the spoken script as Bizet intended rather than the recitatives that replaced the script later and are still often used.<br /><br />The opening scene rightly emphasises Don Jose's murderous past more strongly than usual prior to joining the army as his escape from the law with an opening stage sequel showing Don Jose being taken off to be executed. Early in the opera Don Jose informs his commanding officer of his violent past which led to his joining the army. This essential violence in Don Jose's character is matched by that of Carmen but not understood by her for its likely conclusion. Kaufmann's Don Jose is not a weak man but rather a dangerously unstable man.<br /><br />Antonacci, in this production, portrays Carmen as an essentially dominant woman intent on controlling men through sexual availability in order to achieve conquest over them. This is not the same as being interested in having a serial sexual interest in men. There is no indication in this production that this Carmen actually enjoys either men or sexual relationships. This is simply a story about power and control with a strong undercurrent of latent violence which leads to its inevitable conclusion.<br /><br />Both Kaufmann and Antonacci sing and act their respective parts well and convincingly. Kaufmann is especially impressive in this dark portrayal and one which his voice suits perfectly. His portrayal is of such an outstanding nature that Don Jose's character and decline has an equal dramatic weight to match those features of Carmen.<br /><br />The supporting roles are also well done with a splendid and handsome Escamillo (D'arcangelo) making his first entrance on real horseback - a strongly egocentric and sexual conception and well sung so it is easy to see why Carmen would be attracted to such a man. The part of Michaela is also well portrayed although she is clearly no match for the attractions of Carmen. This is a difficult role to make attractive and Norah Amsellem makes a creditable job of it. The two lead gypsy girls are excellent in their roles and make a strong team with the gypsy men. The women of the chorus enter fully into the rather seedy spirit of their part of the production and this is particularly apparent in the opening tavern scene in Act 2 and in all the factory scenes in Act 1. The male chorus members make for convincing soldiers.<br /><br />The setting is of the period and is very fully staged with lots of period detail and atmosphere. This relates not just to the staging but also to the costuming so this production could be summarised as an enhanced traditional production. The whole opera benefits from the drive generated by Pappano and his orchestra. Overall this is a grippingly vivid and destructive version based upon the mutual need to dominate.<br /><br />The camera work is fully involving and enables the viewer to feel part of the action. The imaging is crisp with good colour rendition. The sound is presented in DTS 5.1 and stereo.<br /><br />In summary then, this production is likely to give much satisfaction and can offer a setting of the correct period and with a cast that can both sing and act well. The recording has good production values with excellent surround sound and good camera work. It takes its place among other recent fine issues such as those at Glyndebourne and The Met and personal preferences will be the deciding factor when it comes to choosing which to buy. All three listed above are equally fine in their differing ways. In my opinion this is a worthy 5 star issue and should give much musical and dramatic satisfaction to future purchasers.Michaela is also well portrayed although she is clearly no match for the attractions of Carmen.

0307405095|1.0|Bought this because of the tart on the back cover - which I promptly served to a bunch of friends who were at my house making gingerbread houses.  We'd been eating the candy and had sugar highs when the tart showed up - there were very polite \\"oh, just a teeny slice, please\\", which turned into licking the the crumbs into oblivion.  Wonderful! - can be made in stages.  Next up was the peach tart with a great crust.  Walked into a party with that and was mobbed - another thing that wasn't big enough apparently, as cries of 'where's the peach thing' were heard, and sighs when it was discovered finished.  Two desserts, two home runs.  Will try the savories next - and the photos show them looking just as good as the sweet stuff.  Directions are clear, pictures accurately represent the finished product, the ingredients are not overwhelming, and most apparently can be done in stages (crusts, etc., and in the case of the chocolate espresso tart, the crust, the filling, and even the ganache needs to sit a bit).  Highly recommended from someone who is not necessarily a complete Martha fan.  My new favorite.
0439023513|2.0|I absolutely enjoyed reading the first 2 books in this series. The constant suspense kept readers wanting to read further into the books until they found themselves near the end with hours gone. Unfortunately this book's not even close to the greatness of its predecessors. Half of the time Katniss was on drugs fast asleep due to emotionally unstable moments. This just created predictable repetition. Tragedy happens. Katniss awakes in a hospital setting. She panics. More drugs. More sleep. My other issue is with Peeta. Yeah, he was tortured and underwent unspeakable horrors in the Capitol. But should this really destroy the image of the character we've come to idolize from previous books? Peeta was the voice of reason. He could act under pressure and use his head when others might not have been able to. Collins makes him an uncertain, violent person in Mockingjay, and only occasionally do glimpses of his former self return. Besides all this is the feeling that everything is rushed towards the end. Similarly to CF, a lot of action takes place in the last 1/3 of the book. However, read CF at this point, compare its last 1/3 to Mockingjay's, and you'll see that there's an enormous difference in the amount of effort that went into those last parts. Mockingjay hurries to end the war and tie up what happens in the afterevents. In the process, characters die without much impact and the book loses much needed suspense. This ending to a great trilogy is highly disappointing. Anyone who loves the first 2 books should just stick with them.
0345803485|1.0|I honestly don't understand why women are all a rage about this.  I thought a virgin who could climax right way, many times over and on command was a male fantasy.  The author repeats the phrases, \\"oh my,\\" \\"crap,\\" \\"down there,\\" and \\"inner goddess\\" incessantly.  Really, those phrases have to make up 1/3 to 1/2 the novel.  The rest is about a girl who receives about $100,000 worth of gifts in return for allowing this guy to perform S&M on her - so romantic.
B000002G6J|5.0|Being a former musician and having played many of these songs back in the late 60's hearing them again after so long brought back many good memories of club dates and road tours. The soft bosa nova sound is relaxing and takes you to another place. Compaired to the bone jarring stuff I hear my grandkids play, this is heaven.
0307730697|5.0|Read this book.... every American should understand the sacrifices that are being made right now for our freedom. The men & women who make the sacrifices are remarkable and this great story demonstrates it in an unforgettable way.<br />Read this book.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Love this game but it is a little glitchy.  I don't think it should cost so many acorns to locate a lost baby if your eggs hatch before you are able to get an Internet connection and I'm still having trouble visiting or liking neighboring villages. But other than the small glitches and frustrations its an incredibly fun and addictive game.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|won't even open the app.  I uninstalled and reinstalled and now it is frozen.  very very disappointed.  this app needs to be fixed.  very flustering.
B006WQLH7G|5.0|I feel that my kindle fire is much safer with this app on there. It always scans my kindle and it gives me updates on suspicious activity.
1451629192|5.0|The first 100 pages of this book are gut wrenching.  The fact that she tells the story in first person, present tense, makes it even more so.  I had a difficult time sleeping for several nights.  What that man did to her was terrible.  I'm glad he's never going to get out of prison.  I hope he has lots of new boyfriends in prison and that his fellow prisoners torture him for the rest of his days.  He deserves it.<br /><br />For a woman with a 5th grade education, Jaycee did a fantastic job writing this book.  It's an amazing story.<br /><br />I wish Jaycee well in the rest of her life.

0871404133|4.0|I wasnt a fan of the chapters on insects but that is my own fault as I was aware of the book's content when i bought it. It was written very well but it wasnt a book i would ever pick up again. I give it a 4/5 becasue Wilson is a very very good writer and i may look into more of his books in the future. I felt i would give it the benefit of the doubt.
B000JK8OYU|4.0|I give it four instead of five only because I worry that people not familiar with the original productions of the albums will not perceive this recording in a proper context. Amazingly well done, thoughtful, considered album. The segues and blends show all the more the more the consistent warp and weft of Beatles music. In pop, there are The Beatles, transcending all else.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Relaxing and enjoyable.<br /><br />Relaxing and enjoyable. Kids really have fun. Got to love the Ice Age characters. The kids really love the game.
B005IQZB14|4.0|Wild (From Lost to Found on the Pacific Crest Trail) is a great read for wanna be adventurers.  Cheryl describes her reasons for taking this hike and her expectations.  Along the trail she learns both how little one needs for survival as well as how to live in the moment.  A quick read as Cheryl resolves to take this journey.  With the ability to laugh at herself, she tells how she prepares, survives and builds strength both physically and emotionally.

B005MYEPXC|5.0|I bought a BluRay player to watch this film and will purchase BRs for other movies, etc. The movie is a lovely modern fairytale, beautifully produced. Woody Allen avoids showing the \\"machinery behind the curtain\\" and this viewer readily accepts the magic. The scenery is somewhat cinemagraphically enhanced, but not by much. Paris and Giverny DO look like that.

B0063IH60K|5.0|I used to play this game frequently on my E-ink Kindle, but playing it on the fire, in color and touching to move the cards is so much better. The game is as you would expect, just like playing on your windows computer. The app also provides options for multi-user but they call it solitaire for a reason. For a price of $0, it's worth trying.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Kept me interested and had enough twists that weren't necessarily surprising but were unsettling. This is especially true for the ending. This book left an impression, and I was so disturbed by the ending that I found I needed emotional support.<br />Great writing and descriptions with few repetitions, main characters were well developed and you get a great understanding of the psyche of the characters
B008JGSM6G|5.0|makes you think. hard on bigger screens fun to play free is the perfect price go ahead and get it
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game kinds pulls you in.  Good kids game especially with it being free!  Easy to play and nothing looks too.hard for the kids to complete.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|best game. I love playing it!!!! even my kids love to play with me!! super easy and super cute character's

B000TIO4Z0|5.0|After purchasing Maria Callas Live, a box set of 8 CDs, I knew I wanted as many Maria Callas recordings as I could get; I also knew that I wanted the best quality sound I could get (static and cracklings wear on me after awhile).  I was trying to decide between this set of 70 CDs of studio recordings and two sets of operas (one with 52CDs and one with 64).  This set is the only one that gave me any real information about remastering and that seemed conflicting:  one reviewer wrote of EMI's 1997 \\"black box\\" remastering while another wrote that the set was remastered by Abbey Road.  Both are correct.<br /><br />Browsing through the accompanying booklet, the CDs do list prior remastering, generally with a 1997 date.  But each CD has since been remastered by Abbey Road.  This is the description on the outside of the box:  \\"Remastered at Abbey Road Studios and noise-shaped by the Prism SNS system for optimum sound quality.\\"<br /><br />\\"Optimum sound quality\\" indeed!  Abbey Road studios did a superb job of stripping away the years to reveal Maria Callas in her breath-taking and timeless glory.  I've listened to about 20 CDs so far.  The sound quality on most of them is so marvelous that to my ears, they could pass for contemporary recordings.  There is NOTHING to remind me that I'm listening to recordings that are half a century old.  On a few recordings so far, the voices are clear and beautiful and it is only a somewhat murky quality to the orchestration that reminds me, only for a fleeting moment, of the age of the recording.  A fleeting moment only and then I'm once again immersed in the music's beauty.<br /><br />I've only had this set for a couple weeks and it's already among my most treasured music.  This music will continue to touch my soul and gladden my days for the rest of my life.
B000I9YX06|5.0|When I finally watched this movie I was pleasantly surprised.  See I love movies that link pieces together to form a circle.  There have been a few of those such as Above Freezing and Till There Was You.  I know those movies maybe weren't the highest rated movies but if you are a fan of scattered pieces coming together to create an ending, then you know what I am talking about.  This movie was one of those.  For that reason, I really enjoyed it.  It was fast-paced and action filled but didn't reveal all of the pieces of the puzzle too early.  Not to spoil too much but the main characters all matter and their union is key if not pre-ordained.  I highly recommend the movie.  It isn't just another Will Smith action flick.
B006G2124E|5.0|\\"The Help\\" is one of those films I can watch over and over.  After seeing it at the theater and about five times (so far) on TV, I cannot imagine any other actresses playing any of the roles.  All were exceptional and worthy of the many accolades and rewards they received for the film.  Emma Stone was overshadowed by some of the showier roles of her co-stars, but she gave a great performance as Skeeter.  The scene with her mother (played by Allison Janney) where the two discuss the fate of their former maid, Constantine, brings tears to my eyes every time.<br /><br />An actress other than Bryce Dallas Howard, as the contemptible Hilly, may have played the role as a one-note cliche.  But Howard's portrayal of Hilly's racism was fantastic.  At times, she seethes with outright rage; at other times, we merely see it simmering beneath the surface.  But she is always frighteningly believable.  Howard makes Hilly both detestable and pitiable; her final scene made me hurt, albeit just a little, for Hilly.<br /><br />Jessica Chastain broke out in 2011, due in large part to her role as the innocent and unaffected Celia.  Her scenes with her maid, Minny (Octavia Spencer), were some of my favorites in the film.  One can only hope that the trusting, respectful, and affectionate relationship depicted by the pair truly existed in 1960's Mississippi.<br /><br />Saving the best for last: Octavia Spencer and Viola Davis.  These two shine both individually and in their depictions of their close friendship.  Spencer earned her Supporting Actress Oscar with her feisty, fierce performance and with the best lines in the film: \\"Minny don't burn fried chicken.\\"  Davis, in the starring role as Aibileen, won a slew of awards but lost out on the Oscar to Meryl Streep.  She perfectly portrayed Aibileen's unwavering strength and dignity, even in the face of outrageously racist abuse.<br /><br />For a film threaded with racism throughout, I was surprised at how much I laughed.  In fact, \\"The Help\\" portrays humor better than many conventional comedies.  We also see the damage caused by all degrees of racism.  Obviously, there is Hilly's overt variety at one end of the spectrum which seems rooted in ignorance, fear, and insecurity.  At the other end of the spectrum is Allison Janney as Charlotte.  We never see Charlotte interact one-on-one with a black character, but I would guess Charlotte would behave with respect and kindness in this situation.  We do, however, see Charlotte succumb to a kind of racist peer pressure, and it's awful to watch.  One could argue (and I would) that Charlotte's behavior is worse than Hilly's, as her actions cannot be explained away by stupidity.<br /><br />\\"The Help\\" is one of the best films I've seen in years.

B000QE1U9K|1.0|I love the Alien saga, but this movie is incoherent and profoundly disappointing.  The premise of it is not rational given the end of Aliens. So it starts with a ludicrous plot premise, and it just goes downhill from there.  I love Sigourny Weaver, but this is the worst movie she's ever made.<br /><br />When we do our \\"Alien\\" film festival, we leave the piece of excrement out of the mix. I can't think of a single positive thing about this film.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Explosive.<br />That's the best word to describe the passion and emotions that roll through this book.<br />I had been reading such great things about this book, and now I know why. I love romance novels with great tension and big, passionate conflict. The kind that makes your heart ache to read. This book is LOADED with scenes that do just that. Along with a whole lot of co-dependency and jealous behavior. Almost too much. Which is the only thing keeping me from giving it five stars...it was just a bit too long with too many conflicts and ups and down in the roller coaster ride. I feel like it could have been 50-100 pages shorter and be just as good, if not better for it. The characters are both seriously flawed and have a lot of growing up to do, but how many college students do you know who aren't that way in at least some way? I'm also not a fan of descriptive violence, so I was a little worried about the whole \\"fight ring\\" part, but Ms. McGuire does an excellent job at portraying that seedy aspect without being overly graphic, although I could do without the number of fights Travis got into outside of the ring.<br /><br />I read this book (all 400+ pages!) in a day...good thing I didn't have to work that day!<br /><br />This is one of those books that I got as an ecopy from the publisher through NetGalley, but think I might be buying my own copy as well, because I have a feeling I'm going to want to reread it and lend it to friends.<br /><br />4.5/5 stars.

B004ZZS4CC|2.0|As a mother (and a human being) the details about her abuse was very difficult to read. Her story is riviting and heartbreaking, but hard to read. I realize she has only a 5th grade education, but I wish the book had been better edited by a professional book editer. Also, all of the pages and pages about her pets made the middle of the book a little dull at some parts.<br /><br />However, I feel that I can't even begin to comprehend how one would react in such horrible conditions. She is incredibly strong to endure that, whereas I feel I would have given up .

B003GDFQX4|5.0|I recently re-read \\"Day of the Jackal\\" in the fashion of taking a master class on writing international thrillers.  I am writing my first European thriller and wanted to study how Forsyth set the standard for modern international thrillers -- with apologies to John le Carre and Ian Fleming -- and to see how it held up since I first picked it up some thirty years ago.<br /><br /> I subsequently read Forsyth's \\"Odessa File,\\" \\"No Comebacks,\\" \\"The Sheperd,\\" \\"Dogs of War,\\" and more recently \\"The Afghan,\\" but felt his first book published in 1971 was his best.<br /><br />Forsyth's experience as a Reuters and BBC correspondent in the 1960s shines through in his richly detailed story of an attempted assassination of French President Charles de Gaulle by a ruthless mercenary hired by disgruntled OAS officers who despised him for leaving Algeria.<br /><br />Forsyth employs a bit too much backstory early on when he describes an earlier failed OAS attempt on de Gaulle and how the few remaining OAS officers not swept up by French police hire an assassin whose profile is not in any police files.<br /><br />Once the mysterious Englishman, code-named \\"The Jackal,\\" is recruited, he begins his solitary -- and deadly -- pursuit by creating a near perfect plan to do the impossible.  The pace accelerates and rarely lags through the rest of the book.<br /><br />Forsyth shares minute details of the Jackal's obtaining a unique sniper rifle, explosive ammunition, and silencer as well as creating multiple identities with forged passports, disguises, and stolen documents<br />The pursuit of this mysterious assassin by French police is similarly richly detailed, complex, and fascinating.<br />Tension and suspense rise dramatically until the shattering climax in a tiny loft apartment when the Jackal misses assassinating de Gaulle in a plaza below with his first shot and the door bursts open.<br /><br />What I learned from re-reading \\"Day of the Jackal\\" is how much work went into Forsyth's meticulous descriptions, pacing, and cinema verite technique.

B0042MDAL8|5.0|Product came as promised.  Loved the movie. I think it is the best out of the whole series.  I recommend reading the books for deeper understanding of the story with regard to all of the movies
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It it hard to describe how this book made me feel. In my opinion it is a modern day love story with some interesting sex scenes.  I read this in a day easily.  Made me want more!
0425263908|1.0|I cannot even believe this rip off was published. It's practically a complete, and very poorly done knock off. Save your money and buy the real thing.
B001GZ6QC4|4.0|The disk arrived quickly and in good condition, and the price was right :) only issue is this strong cigar smoke kinda smell when you open the case, perils of buying used I guess
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is my little buddy. Always with me. Never boring. Fills my time in many instances and always my friend! Enjoy!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|love this app. its awesome there are so many translations available. and the bookmarks are so helpful. the community does need improved
0439023521|1.0|this book is awful I got it because my 10 year old daughter wanted to read it and thought i should read it first. I am so glad I did this is an awful scary violent book that no child should be allowed to read I of course could only get through the first 3 chapters and had to put it away. Just the whole idea behind it is why our society is crumbling and children are becoming violent and so impulsive, video games, violence, and TV.  It is a sad sight to think of where we will be in 100 years but something like this is awful we should be reading and writing positive outlook books not killing violent doom books. I would never see this movie or read and I would not allow children who have no means of deciphering the difference from fiction to reality, read this book. The writing might be good but i did not find it moving me through I have read the The Giver and this book was upsetting but the writing was superb. So if you are thinking about letting a child under 15 read this or see the movie I would not.
B00005JNJV|5.0|Price was awesome arrived in good time and disk was clean, overall a good buy I would recommend this movie
B00005ARS9|5.0|very good songs..and.recording<br />includes all their hit songs<br />The Beach Boys are all about contradictions. The nicer word would be \\"juxtapositions,\\" but let's just call it what it is. Their carefree early songs about surfing, cars, and girls hid the Wilson brothers' chaotic upbringing for a time, and were eventually offset by band turmoil and clashing personalities. The term creative differences would be an understatement, no matter how many times a day Mike Love mediated or how many songs they wrote about the Maharishi (a figure who was arguably more contradictory than his most famous disciples)
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like it you can get metals and rewards 4 doing certain things. Its really fun and it has allot of cool games. I would recomand this game to any one who needs a app to pass the time.
0321543726|5.0|After reading the beginning chapter online, I could tell that this book had been written thoughtfully and I had to have it. I'll be taking a course soon where I need to know C++; it's only covered minimally in the class, and I've only had minimal exposure to it. I know some other languages, like Java, but I'm stalled at the \\"advanced beginner\\" stage.<br /><br />What I like most of all about this book is the size of the chapters. They are all in very readable chunks. Also, the exercises are likewise very short and doable as long as you read the chapters. I rarely got stuck, but I have to say those times I did get stuck I learned a little bit more. I also like that when he refers back to a previous section, he gives the section number so you can find it.<br /><br />The author actually created C++, so you can't find a better authority. Yet, he doesn't talk over your head and get too technical. I like his little tidbits about \\"real\\" programming. There's some humor, but it doesn't ever become annoying.<br /><br />What I like least (and I'm only up to chapter 4) is that this is written at an absolute beginner level. You need not have programmed one bit to use this book. That's great for some, but if you have any programming experience, you may find some parts tedious. Certainly some of the exercises can be skipped. But, even if you think the solution is easy, sometimes when you try it out, you run into obstacles, so try as many as you can.<br /><br />There are no printed solutions to the exercises and only a few posted online, so your only feedback (unless you're using this as a text in a regular classroom) is whether the program worked. I don't know if I'm programming the most efficient way.<br /><br />All in all, I'm looking forward to the more advanced chapters. This book is huge and it covers a lot, unlike many intro books that give you the basics then stop. Don't be intimidated; this book goes step by step. I only wish that the same author could write the same book about more languages!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I am still waiting to read the book.<br />I cannot review at this time as I have not yet read the book.
B008CJ0KI8|5.0|Frank's voice and lyrics create an atmosphere that is original and innovative.  He is a true star.  If he maintains this quality of work, we can expect great music to come in the future.<br />and the fact that he is gay/bi makes him even more sexy and bold and appealing in this homophobic genre of music.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|An addictive game that starts off simple with increasing difficultly. Good mindless fun for passing the time in short bursts.
B00723NWJE|1.0|While a huge fan of Norah Jones, I can't say there is anything worth listening to on this album. Really tried, thought there had to be something there, but simply don't like a single thing. Her voice, tone, delivery, etc. simply doesn't fit with this musical style.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|[[ASIN:0345803485 Fifty Shades of Grey: Book One of the Fifty Shades Trilogy]]This is one of the most poorly written books I've ever run across.  I've never seen so much biting my lip, body wash, 'down there' insanely gorgeous, flushing and blushing in my life.  Every page of this book has one or more of those lines.. Really, how many times can you say I blushed in one book??? It really gets boring after awhile.  Almost written from the perspective of a teenager.  One book was enough for me.
B005IQZB14|4.0|This is a very good read.  It provides great material for a book group discussion and invites readers to consider whether or not we could have taken on a journey like the one Cheryl Strayed took on.
B00881VLCE|1.0|I've had this app on my phone for over a year and used it almost daily.  Was very disppointed when they recently upgraded the software because the unplaced pieces are much smaller and very hard to move onto the board.  I had recently purchased a large bundle of puzzles but will not ever use them because it is too frustrating.  Contacted the manufacturer but and they said they would \\"look into the problems\\" but its been several weeks and it's not improved.

B008IBPECW|5.0|I didn't think I would like it, but I fell in love from the first episode. I should have known Master Piece wouldn't let me down. I am a fan of master piece theator from way back.  I cannot wait to find out what happens next.

030758836X|1.0|In reading Gone Girl, by Gillian Flynn, I was struck by several things. This book began clearly, as a whodunit, and ended as a descent into madness, for virtually all of the characters. It was uneven for this reason and didn't appear to ever get into a smooth rhythm. It was also a book of pure hate, not the least of which is a long series of characters (not all of them men) who are both obvious and subtle misogynists.<br />The two main characters, Nick and Amy, married five years, are about to celebrate their fifth anniversary when Amy disappears. It seems, for this first part of the book, that Nick may have had something to do with it.<br />However, at about 1/3 of the way through, we begin to see who Amy really is, and who Nick really is as well. These two are the most self-aggrandizing, vitriolic, hate-spewing people on the planet. Amy is ridiculous. Nobody, including her child-psychologist parents, seems to have any idea that she displays clear signs of sociopathy. People seem to \\"hurt themselves\\" around her all the time, but they just want to be her or be loved by her, or so Amy says, and her parents buy it every time. They are the few characters who aren't painted as hating women, but they certainly seem to care less for their child than the books they write about her life and make a living from.<br />Aside from this, both Amy and Nick seem to think all women are either smart, but nasty bitches or just flat-out dumb. There was some clear indication that the author, a Midwesterner, seems to find the stereotype about New Yorkers thinking Midwesterners are dumb rubes to be true.<br />I didn't care much for this story. It was too frustrating to read about innocent characters getting framed or hurt over and over, and the ending was absurd.<br />I did think the concept was interesting, but the execution was unpleasant and not at all fun to read. I would not recommend this book.
B008N1V11U|5.0|i love this game im a huge hatman fan and this game is perfect. get it its better then spiderman
B008K8U13K|3.0|It could just be my phone but half way through the first page the game slows down then freezes. A little disappointed but from what I could play it seemed like fun old school Sonic action.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|this game is fun and good for all ages not just kids but for adults to. I recommend. this app
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I was very impressed with Anthony Ryan's book, Blood Song. He builds an interesting world that's part fantasy, part historical fiction (think Middle Age Europe). He does a good job of telling a story with good pace, thoughtful action, and plot that is interesting without being predictable. Most importantly to me, he creates fully fleshed-out characters that are unique and interesting. It was easy as a reader to grow attached to the characters and care about what happens to them, which in my opinion is the difference between a good book and a bad one. This was definitely worth the money I spent and I eagerly look forward to the next installment in the series.
B007VTVGAQ|1.0|Negative. I have loved Fiona apples albums every single one. But this was a waste of my money. Not good at all.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|When I first started this game,  it became more addicting,  and now I cant stop playing this...lil I regimens this for sure.
B00785P2QC|5.0|j love it. a little hard to get at first but its a great game with lots ti do I play everyday
B00881VLCE|5.0|Of all the apps I've downloaded, this one is by far my favorite. The selection of free puzzles is quite extensive. If you like jigsaw puzzles, this is the app for you.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|What canb I say we all love this book.  I have read all three good for summer reading my sister read it in less that 12 hours .  I think we all needed some fun this year.
0547258305|5.0|Some people are born with Graces and others are not.  Graces, something akin to powers or special abilities, are often seen as something good - but every so often a Grace comes along that is feared by many, and thus so is he or she that possesses that Grace.<br /><br />\\"Graceling\\" feels like three stories in one to me.  The undercurrent through it all is simply following Katsa as she discovers how to handle her Grace and how she will take control of her life.<br /><br />Since she was quite young it was discovered that Katsa has the ability to kill.  Not only is she feared because of it, but her uncle, king of one of the seven kingdoms, uses her as his personal assassin.  But, as Katsa grows up she and a select group of friends realize that perhaps the king is something of a tyrant and they begin a secret council to carryout better missions of their own.<br /><br />The second \\"story\\" revolves around Prince Po from another kingdom, and the difficulties of his Grace, and Katsa's view of them and him.<br /><br />The third \\"story\\" deals with uncovering the most evil king amongst the seven kingdoms, how he spreads his evil ways, and how his seemingly insurmountable power can be stopped.<br /><br />It's hard to go into much detail about any of these stories without giving away a piece of another one, so I'll try to discuss the book as a whole.<br /><br />I did enjoy the story, and found the characters (especially the main ones) well rounded, captivating and consistent (in a good way - as in the author didn't cheat in their actions or emotions).  The idea of Graces and the lands were well explained and I think the writing style was good.  The book doesn't clip along, there're a lot of pages devoted to the ins and outs of travel, surviving, and area description, and Katsa's reflections.  But, whether it was the writing style or the characters, most of the time this still captivated me and it was a nice change to many of the more succinct books.  So, once I accepted the styleof the book, then I was able to just settle into the flow and enjoy it from there.<br /><br />I'm not sure if this is meant to me a young adult book, but I'd hesitate to give it to young teens especially.  Although, the book isn't especially graphic for the most part, but there is quite a bit of killing (something that I would have liked more of Katsa's reflection devoted to.  At least the weighing of some lives against others).  And a few of the deaths are more graphic.  The darkness, for me, came more from the horror you know is taking place, or the horrors that are eluded to, even if we never \\"see\\" them.<br /><br />Certain characters do sleep together, and while it's not very detailed, it is there.  So, again, for more innocent readers it might be too mature.  (Also, the characters are not married, if that's something that would matter to you).<br /><br />There were a few things here and there that I wasn't 100% delighted by, and it was darker than most books I read, so for me personally it was probably more of a 4 star book.  But, for the quality of the book and the detail it weaved, I'd say it is worth five stars.  And even though it's not my typical style it definitely kept me captivated and guessing, and I was surprised more than once, which is a delight!
B006ON41FC|5.0|this game is so fun and all of the goals you get make sure that the game never really gets boring!<br />I LOVE this game and you should totally get it! :)
B008MEM24S|5.0|its somewhat like where is my water, but with an unique twist that makes it even more fun, Thank to God it has no anoyying IAP (like its predecessor)
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book was a little disturbing but fun.  Everyone is reading it and having alot of fun and everyone should have fun.  I think if this gives good girls ideas for the bed room why not.  All the orthers were good also.
B005OLF6BI|5.0|I don't usually listen to country artists but Taylor Swift's last two albums intrigue me.  In my opinion she is a wonderfully talented young musician and this live Cd/Dvd combo is a good way to sample some of her best work.  In particular I like \\"Mean\\" and \\"You Belong with Me\\".  Though decidedly country in sound they are both terrific crossover tunes.  Some reviewers state they do not care for live albums, but I sometimes enjoy listening to the excitement of the crowd.<br />The Speak Now World Tour Live Cd/Dvd arrived in lightening fast time and in excellent condition. I also was able to use my Amazon Points to pay for a good part of the purchase.  A deal that can't be beat!
0446693804|5.0|A Walk To Remember is the first novel written by Nicholas Sparks that I have read.And I am hungry for more of his works.After reading this,I borrowed his other works - The Notebook and Nights in Rodanthe - from the public library.The story in A Walk To Remember maybe simple and somewhat predictable BUT it was truly touching and heart-warming.The reader will obviously feel for the teen-age characters - Landon Carter and Jamie Sullivan - for both the love that they have for each other and the pain they are about to experience after their feelings for each other have been fully developed.It will definitely be a must read for someone who loves a good romantic novel.
B00003CXB6|5.0|I purchased this video for my son. He loves dinosaurs and he wanted this movie to go with the Jurassic Park movie he already has.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Very good book.  The best one of the series.  I would recommend this book to men and women.  My 80 yrear old mother is reading it and her gentleman friend is also so.  I think we all need a little spice in our lifes.
B000ID3KU6|1.0|I wanted to give myself some time before I reviewed this. I am confused how so many people thought this was a good movie. The more I think about it, the more totally implausible the plot is. Most of the movies I own I have enjoyed watching over and over. But I have no desire to watch this ever again. I just do not see anything redeeming or entertaining.
B004LWZWGA|3.0|Anne Hathaway is excellent, as always; Michael Caine is a washout, stop whinging.<br />Need to see the baddies face to fear him, otherwise he's just another cartoon<br />Prison stuff was out of Midnight Express, and Liam Neeson came back for an earner.<br />Didn't see the Robin character coming until we were told about it<br />Other stuff is pretty much as usual.<br />Did you think the 'eight years of enforced silence' was a reference to Obama?  George (or Dick) forced into internal exile, the public beguiled by brittle peace? (hey, never mind the recession).  The 9-11 references were so explicit, it was quite uncomfortable.<br />Against all my prejudices, I liked it a lot, must be all the cool toys
B004MC8CA2|5.0|i very much enjoy this app.  the diverse functions including audio Bible, footnotes, cross references, many available translations, and especially the many Bible reading plans.  the is by far the best app I have.  the only things I would add is a Strong's Concordance and parallel Bible option. but regardless ... an amazing app!!!
B004XXIHS2|5.0|This book was the best of this genre I have EVER read!  Each and every word is important to the story - extremely tightly written!  A masterful job writing an absolutely brilliant book!  I was lucky and bought it for .99 when it was offered on Amazon Daily Kindle Deal.
0525952616|5.0|Being a huge technology nerd when I first stumbled upon Daemon and Freedom I was instantly hooked. Daniel Suarez does amazing job of creating an intricate storyline that you just get drawn into.<br />Kill Decision is the latest and it is a another amazing book. Fast paced, with just enough technological detail to keep you hooked an interested. The technology itself being used in the books is part of our life now and this book does a very good job of predicting what might be.<br /><br />Highly recommended book.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|I really enjoy playing this; its been so long since I played Mario and this is a good game to play in its place.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved it and a wonderful book to bring your friends together. i can't wait for the movie.  I loved the story line..i loved books 1 and 2.
B008MEM24S|5.0|this is sadly very amusing. if you liked where's my water then you'd like this too. except this is a little more fun
B0002IQMKM|5.0|As a child of the 60's, I grew up with Talking Heads when my mind was being influenced by a range of music.<br />Suddenly, something that challenged the rock ballads and stereotypes of the British and US music scenes with a raw, powerful sound utilising strong musical harmonies and hard instrumentation.  Striking lyrics, almost off note but nonetheless infectious.<br /><br />But I never latched onto Talking Heads when I was in my teens - this was grown up music. Mature, adult, sensitive, progressive, not for teeny boppers.<br />I recall in my 'maturing' years while reading a Penthouse magazine an interview with this emerging band coming out of California. If any part of the US was going to challenge mainstream music it had to be a Californian sound.<br /><br />If you enjoy good beats, tricky lyrics, eclectic rythmns and stuff to jam to while driving or partying, throw this in the CD player and expose a new generation to what music is really about.
B0084LQQ82|5.0|While others have shared their disappointment with season 7, I have yet again been left begging for more episodes of Supernatural!  While the Leviathon theme was not my favorite to come from the show, the storyline continued to build more depth particularly when it came to the relationship between Sam and Dean.
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|2nd Albums are notorious for being difficult to pull off but Adam Lambert has delivered a more assured album with a better understanding of his style.<br />The album is in two parts with the funky sassy first half and then the more mellow personal songs that show off those famous vocal cords.<br />This album is more reflective of the performer than his first album which was elctric and diverse.<br />I recommend this to many of my friends and i can see it being a big hit. i hope the UK can embrace him now and discover the great show man that is Mr Lambert,he has come a long way since American Idol.
B003VR5PPY|5.0|I LOVE this game! I found out about it through a review on a gaming site and bought it the next day and played all night. It plays like a choose-your-own-adventure visual horror novel and is a Japanese import. There are multiple endings and some of them are complete opposites. It's 100% worth getting them all, and once you get one, you can skip scenes. They are also all recorded.<br /><br />DISCLAIMERS:<br /><br />*It is a MATURE game - there is blood, violence, twisted humor, and adult themes. That is why it's rated \\"M\\".<br /><br />*It is NOT a good game for people who don't like to read, or people with very short attention spans. If you hate reading or have the attention span of a 5 year old, you will rate this game a 1 or 2, and should probably stick to hours in front of your TV.<br /><br />*There are puzzles literally around every corner, and they are all different. They range from fitting pieces together, mixing colors, putting things together, and the dreaded pushing and sliding boxes into place. If you completely suck at math like me, you can always google solutions online.<br /><br />The game itself is part visual novel, part decision making, and part puzzle. The premise is very Saw meets Cube. Someone in a gas mask kidnaps you and you wake up in a locked room. Once you escape your room, you realize you are likely on a giant, multi-level cruise ship. You meet 8 others, and you abductor \\"Zero\\" announces the rules from...somewhere. Everyone has a numbered bracelet on, 1-9. The bracelets are needed to go through numbered locked doors. You cannot escape alone. A mistake in calculation will cause the bracelet to explode and kill you. And there are many deaths along the way. To get through room, you have to solve puzzles, and the doors cause you to have to split up.<br />It is a lot of reading, but it's fascinating. If you hate to read, don't bother.<br />Possibly the most interesting thing about this game, is that it uses paradoxes and real historical events that aren't common knowledge. Some of them are so bizarre, that you will google them, and be surprised to see they exist.<br />The only caution I advise is to have a notebook ready to write down clues and decode clues. They get got exceedingly hard for me as the longest ending got closer, as I am below subpar with math. In the end, I was left hoping for a sequel.<br />Replay value is high and it is easy to get caught up in the story like a great suspenseful book.<br /><br />I also recommend Lux Pain, Time Hollow, and both Touch Detective games...aren't common knowledge.

B007PVHAN2|5.0|\\"Marley\\"  is a documentary about reggae king, Bob Marley, that covers the musician's life with emphasis on the personal over the political.  Director Kevin Macdonald (\\"The Last King of Scotland\\") provides a portrait of Marley's upbringing as mixed-race child in the slums of Jamaica plagued by an almost-always absent father and poverty. His rise to prominence and fame is traced. However, this isn't a concert film.  Instead, Macdonald offers interviews with family members, musician friends and politicians, and relies for visuals on archival footage and still photos.<br /><br />When his mother moved to Kingston, Marley turned to music and the Rastafari religion.  He incorporated his spiritual views -- far from the mainstream of the time -- into both American-style pop melodies and Jamaican ska music.  He is credited with turning reggae into a worldwide sensation.<br /><br />Marley became a vocal advocate of political peace in Jamaica, was once targeted for assassination, and was shot after a political squabble. He dated a white beauty queen while remaining married to one of his black back-up singers, and fathered 11 children with seven women. All this while selling millions of record albums.<br /><br />Macdonald provides an objective look at Marley.  We see many facets of a complex man and realize that Marley, driven primarily by humanistic rather than commercial goals, was far more than just a pop star of the 70's.<br /><br />Special features on the Blu-ray release include extended interviews with Marley's friends and colleagues, photo gallery, audio commentary, and reminiscences by Marley's children.

B0085Z3B2Q|3.0|\\"Dr. Seuss\\" The Lorax\\"  is the animated adaptation of a 1971 children's book that underscored the importance of preserving and valuing nature.  Young Ted (voiced by Zac Efron) lives in the prefabricated town of Thneedville, where the landscape is composed of plastic houses and inflatable hedges and trees, and fresh air is sold in water cooler-sized bottles. Things have come about this way because years ago, the reclusive Once-ler (Ed Helms) cut down all the real trees in order to obtain the soft tufts of the truffala trees necessary in the manufacture of his invention, an all-purpose garment.<br /><br />The character of The Lorax (Danny De Vito) is an orange-maned, yellow-mustached, mystical character who acts as a spokesperson and conscience for nature. Directors Chris Renaud and Kyle Balda present this cautionary but insubstantial tale in an explosion of color.  The screenplay, expanded from the book, seems padded even though it clocks in at a modest hour and a half.  A few forgettable songs are tossed in more as filler than to move the story forward.<br /><br />The by-now familiar computer-generated animation gives the characters a rubbery, weightless look.  The artistry here falls far short of the superior Disney Pixar features, which boast stronger scripts.  The two-disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack contains several mini-movies, audio commentary, deleted scenes, three kids' games, a sing-along, and \\"Seuss to Screen,\\" a brief look at how \\"The Lorax\\" was adapted for the screen.<br /><br />\\"The Lorax\\" is also available in a three-disc Combo Pack (with 3D Blu-ray version) and a single-disc DVD.
B0011UBDTK|1.0|I took a chance and ordered this particular collector's edition even after reading the reviews.  Big mistake.  Up until season 2 it worked fine, but starting at episode 14 the disc stalled and wouldn't continue playing.  I tried to put it in my computer and for some reason it did play better, but was still stalling.  Episode 15 wouldn't play after the first 3 minutes.  Definitely spend the extra money to get a different collector's set.

Its been a couple of years since Rock has made such an entrance back into the main stream culture. Foo Fighters manage to fight their way back in and rock harder than ever before. Buy this album, you will not regret it. It is just perfect.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I'm not one to read what everyone is reading usually but I gave in and started reading this book and boy,am I glad I did!! It is soo good, in my opinion! I read all 3 books in about a week but the first 2 I read back to back within 4 days! It's a book you don't want to put down with its exhilarating details and twists and turns! It keeps you on your toes:) so I already have and will continue to suggest this to people! It's definitely a certain genre, not everyone will like or appreciate it but people I know that will, I totally suggest it! Thanks for the good read:)
B008I34YYY|5.0|I saw this the way most Americans... downloading it.  I wasn't expecting much, but the production values are pretty decent.  Yes, it's campy, yes it's outrageous, yes it's bigoted and racist.  Who cares?  It's hilarious.  This was a little like the movie Independence Day for the Europeans.<br /><br />I won't delve deeply and give this a serious review.  A lot of people might not like it for the fun it's poking at America or Western Culture for being largely stupid. Idiocracy did this as well. I laughed my ass off. This is a movie I've had fun watching over and over, usually in the background. I figure I downloaded it and have watched it many times and I owe it to them and have pre-ordered this blu-ray to help support this title.<br /><br />I wish more films would be this entertaining without taking anything really serious.  This movie is a great departure from all of the current \\"look at me\\", shallow and politically correct Marvel/Ghost Protocol/Michael Bay recipe movies.  It's nowhere near that class of movies and doesn't pretend to be, and that's probably why I like it so much.

B002L4QP0M|5.0|It has been a while since I have read a Cold War mystery / thriller, and I was pleasantly surprised I enjoyed it seeing as how the Cold War is allegedly over and we know how it ended - but then again this is Jeffrey Archer we're talking about so it was worth a try.<br /><br />Needless to say, I was not disappointed.  In true Archer fashion, he quickly gets you into the heads of the characters - both the good and bad guys - and you can really relate to their perspective on life.  Archer has finely crafted action scenes, as well as the buildup to the \\"dramatic conclusion\\" that keeps you on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />I was traveling a lot when I started this one, and I had to start and stop a lot of times as I just didn't have my normal amount of time to read.  That wasn't a good thing, as Archer had hooked me pretty good and I kept getting impatient on wanting to get back to the tale.  If you're looking for a good page-turner of a mystery, I highly recommend this one!
B00785P2QC|4.0|I like it. fun game and addictive. easy to follow, lots of different things to build. makes money while your not on.

B006RUJST6|5.0|I absolutely LOVED this book. The characters were great and I believe they all fit the roles perfectly! The only down fall I would say is the story of the two main characters is a popular one right now. But once I started it, I didn't put it down! Awesome read and def. recommend!

B0000251VW|5.0|English heavy metal masters Iron Maiden's third album The Number of the Beast was originally released in April of 1982 here in the US on the Capitol subsidary Harvest (same label that Pink Floyd was on from late 1969-73 and The Little River Band's first four album was on this label here in the US as well).<br />This album was their second with producer Martin Birch and guitarist Adrian Smith but was the first with new frontman Bruce Dickinson (a/k/a \\"THE AIR RAID SIREN\\") whom was light years ahead of predecessor Paul Di'anno in the singing and stage presence departments. This album was recorded and mixed at Battery Studios in late 1981 but it doesn't sound like it at all. This album has no weak moment and bass player Steve Harris was on fire with his songwriting contributions on all tracks except as noted.<br />It kicks off with the thundering \\"Invaders\\" which signaled that Maiden meant business and was an excellent rocker. Next was \\"Children of the Damned\\" which is a classic track as well with lyrics inspired by the classic novel of the same name and musically was inspired by Pink Floyd/Jethro Tull/Genesis/Black Sabbath. \\"The Prisoner\\" follows (co-written by guitarist Adrian Smith) and is based on the show of the same name that was huge on television in the 1960s. Next is \\"22 Acacia Avenue\\" which is part two to \\"Charlotte the Harlot\\" (and co-written by guitarist Dave Murray) and Bruce just wails on this track vocally.<br />The legendary title cut follows and had some controversy when released as the band was labelled Satanic by Jerry Falwell and later Tipper Gore's PMRC but this song just rocks out with its lyrics crying against Satan worshiping and not condoning it. Next was the album's first single and still a classic on rock radio today \\"Run to the Hills\\" which was about the desecration of the Native American Indian tribes. \\"Gangland\\" follows and was the only track not written by Harris, this time it was Smith and Maiden drummer Clive Burr who wrote it. It was considered a weak tune but Bruce's vocal was unearthly as he hit high screams which were not heard since either Robert Plant, Rob Halford or Ian Gillan hit notes of that range a few years earlier. The original album concludes with Harris' epic \\"Hallowed Be Thy Name\\" about a lowly soul about to be executed and can't imagine why he cries when he is about to die. \\"Total Eclipse\\" is the bonus track on this remastered edition and was not used on the original album due to lack of time but is a killer track. It was revealed that Bruce co-wrote many of the tracks here but for some legal reasons (with his old management and band) was not allowed credit on the tracks.<br />The Number of the Beast turned out to be Iron Maiden's US breakthrough hitting the US Top 40 and going Gold (eventually Platinum). This album sold because the songs on here are brilliant and have aged well unlike some 80s new wave artists like either A Flock of Seagulls or Duran Duran, whose music is completely dated.<br />The album was re-released on EMI in 1998 as a digitally remastered CD with enhanced video footage plus an excellent booklet featuring photos and full lyrics and credits.<br />Highly recommended!onsidered a weak tune but Bruce's vocal was unearthly as he hit high screams which were not heard since either Robert Plant, Rob Halford or Ian Gillan hit notes of that range a few years earlier.

0525478817|5.0|I've had this on my to-read list for so long that I totally forgot what the book was about when I started reading it.<br /><br />That said, I was delightfully surprised and immensely glad to read this book.<br /><br />I should note that I typically read 5-6 books at any given time, based on what I feel like reading at the moment, and my interested spans several genres. I'm a thirtysomething mother of 3 and what I am in the mood to read varies. I also only read in 10-minute spurts... while I'm having breakfast, going to bed, sitting in the car waiting for my kids... so these two things combine to make me finish a book in unpredictable time.<br /><br />So it was totally unlike me to avoid the real world as much as I possibly could so that I could continue reading this book. I put everything on hold and made every excuse I could to postpone my daily life so that I could consume this book.<br /><br />I would not put money that I would want to read a book from the POV of a teenage, terminally-ill cancer patient who falls in love with another cancer patient. But this book is addictive. The characters are endearing. The description of the weary parents gives the book depth. The literary references in the book are delightful. The every nuanced detail of life carting around an oxygen tank should be depressing, but it isn't. The sorrow of this group of characters should be anything but alluring, but somehow Green does such a good job of making these kids have believable optimism that you feel joy when they feel joy, even when ordinarily in your own life such things would not be joyful.<br /><br />This is an emotional read and I weeped my fair share. I also did that totally cheesy thing when the book was over and I turned the last page, when I closed the book and clutched it to my chest and closed my eyes. I loved it that much.<br /><br />If you are debating whether to read this book, I urge you to give it a try. I am so glad that I did.
B000063DFN|5.0|Iron Maiden's fifth full length studio release Powerslave was released in October of 1984.<br />The album was the band's second album with the band's classic lineup which consisted of lead singer Bruce Dickinson, bass player Steve Harris, guitarists Dave Murray and Adrian Smith and drummer Nicko McBrain.<br />The band, along with producer Martin Birch, went back to Compass Point Studios in the Bahamas (where Maiden recorded 1983's Piece of Mind) to record an album that would be the third jewel in Maiden's triple crown (as I found out when I first acquired the album on cassette in June, 1988 (Capitol version) via a trade with an ex-buddy and then on CD in November of 1993 (Capitol version), then the Castle 1995 re-issue and the 2002 Sanctuary/Columbia (for US) and EMI remastered CD (I have the EMI remastered issue)).<br />We begin the album with \\"Aces High\\" penned by Harris. What a killer opening track! The track was lyrically inspired by the World War II bomber jets of the same name and is a fast paced metal rocker. Next was the Smith/Dickinson collaboration first single \\"Two Minutes to Midnight\\" which is a classic masterpiece. Next is a rare instrumental, the Harris penned \\"Losfer Words (Big 'Orra)\\" which is a great instrumental! Next is the song \\"Flash Of the Blade\\" which is another great rocker (written by Dickinson). We close the first half with \\"The Duellists\\" (written by Harris) which is another great rocker.<br />The album's second half kicks off with the Smith/Dickinson penned rocker \\"Back In the Village\\" which is a great song. Then we have sound effects which lead into the Dickinson penned title cut which has somewhat of a Middle Eastern vibe and its lyrics which delve into Egyptian mythology for a rumination on power and mortality. We close the album with the 13 plus minute prog-metal Harris penned epic \\"Rime Of the Ancient Mariner\\" which closes the album in majestic style. The song has time signature changes that would make bands like Yes and Genesis and ELP proud while maintaining the metal edge which the band is known for. The lyrics tell of the poem written by Samuel Taylor Coleridge about a mariner who kills an albatross and is cursed with some bad luck after that happens. This epic is a masterful finish to a classic album.<br />Powerslave continued Iron Maiden's winning streak and would reach #21 on the US album charts and (like its predecessors) would be another Platinum selling album and would not be their last.<br />Powerslave may have been recorded in 1984 but it still sounds great almost 30 years on.<br />RECOMMENDED!ELP proud while maintaining the metal edge which the band is known for.

1435122968|5.0|Like many of the reviewers, I've got a lot of Lovecraft's fiction spread out in a selection of incomplete and mouldering paperbacks, so it's good to have his stories collected in one high-quality volume.<br /><br />It's true, this does not contain Lovecraft's collaborations with other writers - I find a lot of those partnered stories are very uneven, and so it's not something I'm missing.<br /><br />At his best, like in \\"Mountains of Madness,\\" or \\"Shadow over Innsmouth,\\" Lovecraft cannot be matched. Even Stephen King at his best can only equal Lovecraft (although King's best short stories definitley outnumber Lovecraft's surprisingly thin library). Since this is a complete set, there are plenty of fairly weak entries that depend on surprise endings with no evidence to support the conclusion - but, they were written when he was much younger, and while they might seem derivative, it's because a lot of modern writers have copied Lovecraft, not the other way around.<br /><br />I bought this collection for the best stories first, and for the completion second. I can re-read \\"Dunwich Horror\\" or \\"Shadow Out of Time\\" 100 times and they always seem fresh. I agree with another reviewer that this is not a book to read cover-to-cover. Pick a few stories at a time, then let it sit for a couple weeks.<br /><br />For fans of short horror stories, I'd put this and King's \\"Night Shift\\" as must-have volumes in any library.

B00009YXHN|3.0|Is it any good?<br /><br />Brian Yuzna gives us more of the same but nothing new in this sequel to the 1985 classic `Re-Animator'. Continuing down the Frankenstein path, this time we see the shift into `Bride of Frankenstein' territory as West decides to create woman, problem is it feels like an inferior repeat of the first one, only the jokes aren't as funny. But in saying that...who cares! More of the same isn't a bad thing, `Bride' is still a fun sequel. With more grotesque gore, gratuitous nudity and some awesome special effects fans of the original won't be disappointed. After all Jeffrey Combs is in fine form as Dr. Herbert West, with that diabolical cynicism he sinks even deeper into his own madness, keeping his re-animated disfigured creations bricked up behind the basement wall, including an eye-ball attached to human fingers, culminating in a hilarious scene. Kathleen Kinmont is also excellent as Gloria, the undead re-animated woman created by West whom destroys herself in a scene of gruesome organ rejection; gore hounds will be in their element. `Bride of Re-Animator' may not have the same lovable wackiness as Stuart Gordon's `Re-Animator' but it is still a must see, especially for fans of the Zombie genre.<br /><br />Best bit?<br /><br />IT'S ALIVE! Kathleen Kinmont's resurrection as the \\"Bride\\" brings about a messy climax.<br /><br />Did you know?<br /><br />Metallica guitarist Kirk Hammett owns the Dr. Hill severed head prop used in the film.

B005LAIHSQ|2.0|Is it any good?<br /><br />Snow White and the Huntsman is the latest to be adapted into a live action, but this time with quite a big twist. The film takes on a Lord of the Rings feel, bringing it a dark style, but ultimately one we've seen many times before. Kristen Stewart as Snow White is predictably wooden in her performance, making the fact that she is highest paid actress in the world completely absurd. Chris Hemsworth is adequate, with the script and style doing nothing for him besides giving him a pay check. By far the star of the film is Charlize Theron, owning the role of The Queen with her performance. However, the whole film screamed of mediocre, taking the `best bits' from other similar films. Even though I was watching the film in Gold Class with unlimited popcorn and wine, it didn't make watching the film any more enjoyable. Unfortunately, the film is likely to remembered more for the affair between Stewart and Sanders than the film itself. Casting couch anyone?<br /><br />Best bit?<br /><br />The climatic fight is pretty decent, I guess.<br /><br />Did you know?<br /><br />The Dwarves in the Huntsman were played by actors who had their faces digitally transmuted onto small bodies. This caused a protest from the Little People of America.
B007PVHMCG|2.0|Bought two Lego Minecraft sets for a camp I run. I assume the kids were going to love them, being Minecraft is really popular right now. All in all, it was just OK. Most of the kids didn't really care about this Lego set, although they like both Legos and Minecraft. The set was really small, even with two sets. Yes, it's a micro set but for that kind of money, you expect a little bit more. I also bought the Minecraft foam axe, which was really popular at my camp. If your kids love Minecraft, I would recommend the foam axe instead of this overprice Lego set.
B005LAIH9K|4.0|Is it any good?<br /><br />13 years have passed since audiences got their first taste of pie, and if you are a fan of the original series, this film will not disappoint. New writers and directors are installed for this one, however, all the cast is back, yes, even the `MILF' guys. The hilarious situations and gross out humour is still very much intact, as expected, however, there is a certain joy and nostalgia that comes from watching these beloved characters so many years on, and how their lives have changed (for better or worse). American Pie Reunion is a worthy addition to the series, and an excellent send off to some of the actors careers, who will forever be type casted and will rarely be seen again...Tara Reid, I'm looking at you.<br /><br />Best bit?<br /><br />Jason Biggs' attempts to chauffeur a hot drunken, exhibitionist home, unravels with a sequence of hilarious mishaps.<br /><br />Did you know?<br /><br />At eight films, Eugene Levy has become the only actor to be in every film in the American Pie franchise.

B0085Z8F4A|5.0|What's it about?<br /><br />A team of scientists arrive on an alien planet to uncover the origins of humans and the earth, but what awaits them is something deadly.<br /><br />Is it any good?<br /><br />Prequels have been the flavour of the last decade as an easy way to extend the life cycle of a particular franchise. Some of them decent, but mostly bad. So, leave it to Sir Ridley Scott to create a smart science fiction film that sets the film in the `Alien' world, but doesn't rely on it as a cheap way to market the film. Naoomi Rappose (from Girl with the Dragon Tattoo) is a breath of fresh air, with her excellent performance as the crew leader Shaw, but it is David the robot, (played by Michael Fassberer) which deliveres the performance that most people will be talking about. Simply amazing. For me, what makes this film so great is the perfect balance between the amazing action and exploration, allowing audiences to fully immerse themselves in the world. The controversy surrounding the film in regards to being 'confusing' is quite ridiculous, so if you do get the chance, make sure to see the film in IMAX 3D for an out-of-this world experience.<br /><br />Best bit?<br /><br />Giving birth to a human child is the most wonderful and joyous occasions that could happen. An alien child? Not so much. A horrifically cringe worthy scene to say the least.<br /><br />Did you know?<br /><br />The androids' names in the Alien films follow an alphabetical pattern: in Alien it's Ash, in Aliens and Alien³ it's Bishop, in Alien: Resurrection it's Call and in this film it's David.
0670022411|3.0|I would like this writer very much if she were more concise and left the romantic novel formula behind to write more original characters.<br /><br />At first, the book held my attention. But after a while it gets dull because each scene goes on far too long.<br /><br />In spite of the author's obvious intention of avoiding the damsel in distress cliche, the heroine is continually placed in a helpless state due to illness or exhaustion, where she must be bundled up and catered to by others. The author tries to make her heroine strong, but then overwhelms her with a tall, strong, wise man to care for her and protect her.<br /><br />Lastly, the end of the book leaves the reader hanging. Even in a book series, the reader should be able to read and enjoy a single book from the series. On its own, this book is not satisfying. And the content was not worth the over long format.
B0088WGBC8|1.0|Ended up purchasing this twice as it did not work properly the first time! Quality was poor the first time, very slow and poor picture
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I can't say I liked the book. It was poorly written, had too much repetition, and didn't even have a story line. However,  I really only read it for the sex, so I got my wish. Can't complain.
0345803485|5.0|this book was absolutely amazing. I never read, dont really have the patience to sit, but this book caught my eye and in the next 20 minutes while opening it i didnt realize i was already 5 chapters in. This book is very relate able to every day life and would recommend it to any young female. I was also happy i purchased it on amazon, saved about $10 instead of buying it in a bookstore.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I was hooked from the first few pages.  Totally believable world of the future and so detailed!  Fast action and exciting pace made me want more, more, more!

B002BWP49C|5.0|The parts that differ from the book are minor. The movie can't be everything Stephanie described. It hit all the high points. The wedding was amazing. If you listen to the commentary or watch the extras on the dvd you get even more. Can't wait for part two!
B005XBA9Y8|5.0|I am extremely pleased with this set in every way, starting with the sound quality. These recordings date from the golden age of audio, from about 1951 to 1964, before the advent of solid state circuitry, digital recording, and small microphones.  Recordings were made on huge reel to reels decks, on vacuum tube consoles, using three (or sometimes two) strategically placed tube mikes. The sound has an enthralling lushness that simply no longer can be reproduced today. Yes, there is a little tape hiss, but it is never obnoxious, and most importantly, the music is still there in all its lush glory. As far as content, I am happy with most of the selections and think that they were well chosen. Plus, even if I only liked half of them (and I like much more than that), the price would still be a bargain on a per disc basis. So definitely, I am happy with this set, and I think most classical music lovers, as well as anyone who likes great sound quality, will like it just as much as me.

It's not as much a dominat love story but at the same time it keeps you wanting more. The only thing that sucked is the 2nd book doesnt come out til October bc I wish I could've kept going. Great book and I highly recommend
0525952616|2.0|I had been looking forward to Suarez's latest & loved the concept of killer drones. However, I thought this story was disjointed & a bit confusing.

That is a hard act to follow.

B0012QE4Q2|2.0|I've never read the book but have wanted to see this movie for some time. I watched it today on tv. It ran 2 hours with no commercials so I don't know if anything was edited out. I watched The Tudors tv series and subsequently have read quite a bit about that era. I know the Tudors was somewhat inaccurate - especially with the portrayal of Henry as a young viril man well into his 40s- but it was far superior to this movie. Of course, it is easier to develop characters, plots and timelines over the course of a 4 year series than in a 2 hour movie. However, the major events of the story are barely touched upon in TOBG. The timeline is wrong. It has Henry hating Anne almost on their wedding day, when actually his disappointment in her didn't occur until after Elizabeth was born. And at the end, Mary takes Elizabeth to raise. Elizabeth is portrayed as an infant when we know that she was 3 when Anne died. Plus, there is nothing I've read to indicate that Mary actually raised Elizabeth. Many other reviews have already pointed out the many other historical inaccuracies so I will not repeat. Just let it be said that this movie was a major disappointment.
B0002OERI0|5.0|The events of September 11th, 2001 and the following year influenced Green Day's most successful album titled `American Idiot'. Calling this album their \\"Rock Opera\\", the band took the real events of their lives and their feelings and formed them into what has been described by some as the best, most important, and critically acclaimed album of the 2000-2010 decade. From the slow ballad `Give me Novocain' to the ramped up anthem `American Idiot', Green Day does not disappoint with their signature rock sound, even if it is more contemporary, in this Grammy Award winning album. Many feel as if Green Day has sold out because of the tone and vast commercial success of this album, but this is not true. Taking feelings and emotions from the heart is something Green Day has always done, and has masterfully done on this album. There are two tracks on this album, each over 7 minutes long that feel like 4 songs mixed into one. Both of these songs are considered by the band front man Billie Joe Armstrong as the mainstays of this record breaking album. All in all this album spawned 3 hit singles, sold over 10 million copies worldwide, brought attention to people about what was happening in this world and put words to the feelings of the voiceless masses in the United States.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book is all hype. The writing syle is elementary and the verbage is irrtating because of its simplicity. I admit, I was hooked for a while but then it just became so tedious! I finished the book to the end to give it a honest try.

I don't plan to do too much more with it. we'll see if this changes, and the privacy concerns does bear some more looking into, which is why it gets 4 stars. otherwise, looks nice and seems to operate well.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|A little dissapointing but I loved it anyway!!!!!!!!! I ask myself Why did Prim have to die? Then I realize it helped Katniss choose between Peeta(i loved him!) and Gale(i loved him too!). I wish she didn't have to choose between the two. That tore me appart on the inside. I really recommend this book!!!!

0375842209|5.0|As an English teacher, I have read many, many great books.  In my opinion, The Book Thief is at the very top of this list.<br /><br />If you haven't read it, you must. It will be a big gift you give yourself, and you will see life through new eyes...you might have a new perspective on Death, too, who, by the way tells the story of Liesel, the book thief.  He tells us in the beginning when he introduces himself as the narrator that this is a \\"small story.\\"  When you read the back jacket, that's how it definitely appears.  But sometimes, we find extraordinary treasure in the smallest of things...<br /><br />The Book Thief is the story of a little girl growing up in Nazi Germany.  One day, in great sorrow and shock over the loss of her brother, she picks up a book, thus beginning her \\"life of word thievery.\\"  Her foster father, Hans, teaches her to read, and slowly, very slowly, she begins to see truth in her small world--a truth that is at the same time horrific and ugly and remarkably beautiful.  When Hans and his rough around the edges wife Ruby take in a Jewish fighter by the name of Max, Liesel finds something else--not just a friend, but a sort of soul mate who shares her love of words and a hunger for understanding and acceptance.<br /><br />Liesel is no stranger to poverty, loneliness, rejection and loss--Liesel and Death are well acquainted.  But while Liesel may intrigue Death, she is, without a doubt, the true picture of a relentless and fragile survivor.  Just as Liesel is well acquainted with greatest heartbreak, she is also no stranger to love:  her accordion playing foster father, Hans, who shows Liesel unconditional love for the first time, was a character I adored from his very first introduction.  Liesel's best friend Rudy, who breaks my heart in a thousand ways, shows her a friendship that transcends circumstance and danger.  Her foul-mouthed by fiercely loyal and determined Aunt Ruby is more than meets the eye--in a good way--and the mayor's wife?Well, she is a character so intriguing, so delicate, and so pure that despite her \\"small\\" role, she is captivating.  Other than Liesel, though, my favorite character was Max.  In a word, Max is a paradox of warrior tenacity and will and delicate sensitivity and kindness.<br /><br />The Book Thief offers more than a remarkable story:  it is a celebration of words, themselves:  the most beautiful words that will break your heart in a deliciously devastating way. In the words of Liesel:  \\"I love this place and hate it, because it is full of words.\\"  I love words, too...so much it hurts sometimes!!  The way Zusak plays with and manipulates his words into portraits of heartbreak, love, and raw beauty rains on the soul.  If there was ever a book that shows you the power of the written word to change minds, hearts and perspectives, this one is it.  It will stay with me forever.<br /><br />The narrator, Death, states that he is \\"haunted by humans.\\"  I know that feeling.  I will be haunted by The Book Thief forever.
0962477060|5.0|Bill Edwards' Fretboard Logic is a brilliant explanation of how the notes on the guitar fretboard are laid out. Edwards explains how there are patterns that run up the fretboard in the CAGED sequence. The patterns remain the same no matter what key you're in, although where they are located on the fretboard changes in regards to what key you're in. The explanation of these forms is important to know because it allows you to easily get around the neck. In other words, Edwards' book allows you to see the big picture.<br /><br />I feel bad for Edwards because I noticed that some people have dismissed this book as yet another scale book. If I had picked up Edwards' method right after I started playing the guitar, I might have had the same mistaken notion. It took years of frustration and dealing with other guitar methods that confused me to allow me to recognize the genius that lies behind Edwards series of books. Edwards' explanation of how the fretboard is laid out allows you to understand how scales, the modes within the scales and chords are laid out and how they are constructed along the length of the neck of the guitar. Once you grasp this information through Edwards' very clear explanations, you will be able to shift between positions, going up and down the neck, no matter what key you're in. Edwards' genius largely lies in the fact that he's able to take information that you get in bits and pieces here and there and puts all together and explains in such a clear manner that it allows you to grasp how the guitar works. When I first started trying to learn scales, I was baffled at what the connection there was between major and minor scales, pentatonic scales, the modes, etc. I realized later when rereading some of the books I used as a young guitarist that they weren't written very clearly or were even misleading. Edwards' explanation explains this in such a clear, straightforward manner that it leaves you stunned by the realization of how easy all of these concepts actually are once it is explained to you in the right way. Edwards' method also allows you to grasp how chords are put together, from the simplest to the most complex and how they are constructed from the CAGED forms. If you are a neophyte guitarist, take the time to learn the information in this book. It will save you years of frustration.<br /><br />If you've been playing the guitar for a while, this book will probably be very easy to get through since you already know many of the forms that Edwards' presents. After working your way through the book, you'll just know how to finally put all the information you've gathered and understand the big picture in a coherent and systematic way. For example, I've recently been working on learning how to read music in standard notation higher up the neck. Now that I now the CAGED sequence, it's allowed me to hit the right notes much more easily since I know what form I'm using in that position due to the key that I'm in.pts actually are once it is explained to you in the right way.

006197806X|5.0|I loved Pandemonium--perhaps even more because I was one of the few who didn't like Delirium very much. I am glad the flowery, beautiful writing was toned down to more manageable levels to allow room for action without dragging the pace down, which was my main problem with Delirium. The quotations in the beginning of Delirium's chapters have disappeared (honestly, I wasn't a big fan of them), instead chapters are separated into Then and Now. I was pleasantly surprised with the new format, it allowed a break between tense moments and to give the readers backstory without a deluge of flashbacks or the dreaded info-dump. Lena learns to be more independent: she learns to take initiative, and decide things for herself.<br /><br />World-building: Finally, Can I Get Some Answers?<br />Well, at least I know where some of the outcasts go and about how far the reign of deliria spans. But I still don't buy the society completely: it's further reinforced that the people can't feel hate, are zombies, and are fueled by fear. You can hardly blame them, the choice is clear: you get cured, or you get thrown in prison (or beat to a pulp.) I don't know how the society would function if nobody cared about others; if people are naturally \\"no better than animals,\\" then we wouldn't hesitate to wreck havoc. But I am also starting to understand the utopian concept: is love worth sacrificing if it also takes away hate? As long as you comply with the rules in this society, you will survive and be protected. Sure, you may not have \\"love,\\" but you will have a shirt on your back, a comfty bed, and food.<br />Unfortunately, the creation of this society is still a mystery so I'm sticking my theory that it was created by a group of lonely, butthurt cat ladies.<br /><br />Then:<br />The \\"Then\\" chapters are Lena's backstory right after her escape into The Wilds. She meets a group of Invalids, and she quickly learns how to survive in the Wilds. At first, her refusal to help out under the excuse that she was too weak completely appalled me since she admits to feeling guilty and selfish. I felt it was only right for her to at least try to help out instead of being dead weight. The Wilds is a brutal place where survival comes at a cost, a lesson Lena is forced to learn. I began to suspect it was because Lena was fearful of going outside. Perhaps Oliver wanted to show Lena's growth from a selfish, whiny girl to an strong, independent woman. Lena reveals that she can self-reflect, she knows when she is immature--and she fixes herself. The ability to admit to one's flaws and do something about it makes Lena so much more likable.<br /><br />Now:<br />Most people say the Now chapters were more exciting, but I honestly can't decide between the two. I can see why the Now chapters may be much more enthralling because it is unpredictable. You know for sure Lena is going to make it out fine from the Then chapters (because if she didn't there wouldn't be Now chapters), but I still wanted to see how the two stories intersected.<br />The Now chapters are filed with much more action with Lena as a spy for The Resistance. Unfortunately, her stint as a spy doesn't last very long when she is captured and locked up in a room underground. Her journey out of that room is a testament to how much Lena has grown. And I'm loving it!<br /><br />Romance:<br />With Alex out of the picture, I wasn't sure what would happen: would Lena be depressed and lovelorn, or will she get another beau? Turns out she does have another lover. I definitely liked the romance between Julian and Lena a lot more than the one with Alex (to be honest, I thought a lot of Lena's feelings toward Alex was fueled by infatuation and first love.) I suspect it's because Alex was too mysterious and flat for me to like--while Julian was fleshed out. He had his flaws, his backstory, and his weaknesses. The best part was that Lena wasn't the confused, damsel-in-distress anymore. HALLELUJAH! In fact, I think Lena was the stronger one, though Julian does have buff muscles (even though I don't know where he got them since he seems to be on the wimpy side.)<br />Lena also loves to pick the wrong love candidates: she has to pick the son of Thomas Fineman (Delirium Free America's leader.) Another forbidden love story served on a silver platter. I was surprised at how easy it was to \\"unbrainwash\\" Julian since he was raised by the leaders of the entire deliria movement. I'm secretly expecting him to go rogue at any moment. And yes, he has eyes that seem to constantly change colors. Oliver must have an affinity with eyes. Apparently they can't be just boring brown blobs.<br /><br />I'm Way Too Good At Guessing These Plot Twists:<br />You'd have to be pretty oblivious not to know what's up with all these obvious \\"plot twists.\\" Honestly, I'm not sure if Lena is so smart anymore. At least one of them was just screaming at me: seriously, why would someone make you carry a 600 page book without other intentions? And if Coin's name was a flashing red light.<br />As for Lena's mother--I don't know how I knew. Maybe because I sensed that she had to be in the book somehow? Or was I subconsciously hinted at with foreshadowing?<br /><br />Ending (OMG, EPIC CLIFFHANGER MOMENT...but really, we all knew it was coming):<br />CLIFFHANGER ALERT! I knew it was coming, but it did make me excited for Requiem. Though I know some are going to be frustrated.<br /><br />I'm glad Pandemonium didn't suffer from second-book syndrome. Most people expect the middle book to be a bridge between the first and last book, but I'm pleased that Pandemonium built from its first book, Delirium (which now that I think about it was just intro material) to give readers a very welcome surprise. Even if you didn't like Delirium, Pandemonium will change your mind. The action, the plot twists, the heart-stopping tension definitely makes Pandemonium an irresistible pageturner.ger one, though Julian does have buff muscles (even though I don't know where he got them since he seems to be on the wimpy side.)<br />Lena also loves to pick the wrong love candidates: she has to pick the son of Thomas Fineman (Delirium Free America's leader.)

B0031RS7MW|3.0|I found this a bit predictable, and was a little disappointed.  A lot of people had said it was a fabulous book, really well written, great story etc etc, so perhaps my expectations were too high.  For me, it wasn't a bad book, but it wasn't anything special either.
1609611543|1.0|While I must admit while the description of the evolution of today's wheat was interesting, the book is merely a repackaging of the old Atkins concept - no carbs.

030758836X|5.0|This is Gillian Flynn's third novel. On a warm summer morning in North Carthage, Missouri, it is Nick and Amy Dunne's fifth wedding anniversary. Presents are being wrapped and reservations are being made when Nick's clever and beautiful wife disappears from their rented McMansion on the Mississippi River. Husband-of-the-Year Nick isn't doing himself any favors with cringe-worthy daydreams about the slope and shape of his wife's head, but passages from Amy's diary reveal the alpha-girl perfectionist could have put anyone dangerously on edge. Under mounting pressure from the police and the media--as well as Amy's fiercely doting parents--the town golden boy parades an endless series of lies, deceits, and inappropriate behavior. Nick is oddly evasive, and he's definitely bitter- is he really a killer? This novel switches back from Nick's character to Amy's character. I completely devoured this book. I was always wanting more and more, especially from Amy. Amy for me, was the most interesting, rapidly changing character. Flynn, made the character so real for me. I really got connected with Amy. Also, I was really impressed with the way Flynn, depicted Nick's conflicting emotions for his wife Amy. One minute he wants to kill her, the next he's upset, wondering where Amy's well being is, or he's in love with his wife. I highly recommend this novel. If you love a good thriller/mystery you will fall in love with this novel. Also, I highly recommend Gillian Flynn's previous novels Dark Places, and Sharp Objects.

B007549W62|4.0|This film is not for everyone. It explores some of the  darker elements never dealt with in most disaster films. Quite a few people seem to have missed the point that it's a film about how people react during a crisis. There really are no cinematic heroes present (a refreshing change from the cliched filled majority of these movies) and the overall situation is given the right sense of dread. These people are alone, trapped in a basement and forced to deal with one another. The fact that some have been driven insane by what happened adds to the tension. Well worth checking out.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|good calculator app....bright big #'s,  very easy to use and to go back to previous calculations. Recommend. for all ages.
B005LAIGW8|2.0|This film is a reboot that attempts to make the character closer to it's comic book version, but fails to really do so. The main problem is that Ghost Rider seems like a secondary character throughout the film. Nobody cares about the son of satan, his mother or the sect of monks after him. These characters take up way too much screen time and worst of all bring the film to a complete stop. Boring and pointless. Nicholas Cage's performance is entertaining and he captures the overall feel of Johnny Blaze quite well. The new Ghost Rider fails though. It's a badly rendered cgi creation that looks like it stepped out of a video game. Overall this film, while nowhere near as hideous as The Amazing Spider-Man or Steel, is a bad movie.

0684803356|5.0|The decades since Hemingway's death have not been kind to his legacy. While still revered as a pillar of English literature, his life seems to have chipped away at his work.  Most find Hemingway's writing too dry or his stories clustered with masogny and booze. To be fair the critiques have some relevance, but behind every Hemingway story lies a heart fractured, but aspiring for peace. For Whom the bell Tolls was my fourth Hemingway and I can honestly say my favorite. There is so much to marvel at that my meager attempts at a review do the book no justice, but it's the way Hemingway writes and the subtle beauty that he evokes that made this novel so enjoyable for me.  Hemingway's prose style is so intricate it at once appears etched in stone, but  light as a feather.  Hemingway shows how war not only changes the way we feel and act, but the bonds we form with the ones around us.  Robert Jordan's relationship with Maria is one of the few hemingway's love stories that I felt connected to, and while a bit dated in today's world I still was touched by the love they bore one another.  Maria is encapsulated in a blanket of femine weakness, but she is bolstered by the mighty Pilar.  I find Pilar to be one of hemingway's most fascinating women. Endless papers can be written on her alone, and I found her to be so multifaceted.  Besides being one of hemingway's best novels, it's also one of his longest.  At first I was daunted by 400 pages of dry Hemingway prose, but by the end I was looking for more.  Besides shining light on an area of world history few even know existed(the Spanish Civil War), Hemingway's story is universal in it's telling by including themes of fraternity, nationalism, and the multifaceted definitions of courage.  I have a new respect and love for Hemingway after reading this remarkable novel.  While Hemingway may not be everyones cup of tea, but those looking for a good and memorable story should look no further!
B000093BDX|5.0|If you like The Beach Boys, of course you'll love this record.  It is a terrific collection of many of their most popular songs and greatest hits spanning the many decades of the existence of this group which can claim to be \\"America's Beatles.\\"  I recently saw them live as part of their 50th Anniversary Tour, and they sounded great.  Wonderful show !  Great that they are all together, especially with Brian Wilson back aboard.  I would also recommend their latest record, the first they've done in a good while, called \\"That's Why God Made The Radio\\" with Brian Wilson having written or co-written about all the songs, and he produced the record as well which is another of his great strengths.  The Beach Boys are just terrific.  They are the masters of layered harmony and memorable lyrics.  This is an excellent greatest hits type record !  Buy it and enjoy the terrific sounds of one of America's standout groups in Rock And Roll history, the legendary Beach Boys.
030758836X|4.0|This was my first Gillian Flynn novel and I must say I am quite impressed.  I'm always on the look out for a good thriller that  isn't cliche ridden and hopelessly tired like those of James Patterson or Dan Brown.  Flynn's new novel takes the reader on a roller coaster ride of emotions.  The shocks are frequent, but not schlocky,  rather cleverly well put together.  Without giving too much away, the two narrators are not only well crafted and believable, but you actually feel like you are inside two different heads.  I also feel Flynn takes a look at the ugly under belly of America's shock happy media.  What makes the story so good is that it is completely believable.  The Nancy Grace's of the world have turned the media into an overrun circus of shock and awe journalism. What is also great about this novel is the clever writing.  Very few thrillers combine good storytelling and good writing. Ms Flynn however is a writer at heart, and directs her story much like Hitchcock would have done with one of his movies.  I won't dwell too much on the action because I think part of the fun is getting to know these two characters and  walking around with them in their twisted world.  I think it's a perfect read for the summer.  My only criticism would be the ending.  Flynn had built up the story so high that the ending felt rushed.  That being said I still found the novel to be a wholloping good read!
B007U1FEJE|5.0|I recently saw the Beach Boys live as part of their 50-year reunion tour in which all the surviving original members are together for the first time in awhile, and, of course, part of this they are doing some songs from this latest record and promoting it.  These guys, now into their late 60's and early 70's, still sound terrific, and the live show was excellent.  And it is especially great to see their main creative force, Brian Wilson, back with them.  Wilson has ridden a tough road in his life with drug addiction and mental health issues, but for awhile he has been doing much better, got off the drugs, re-married, had more children, has had a good solo band career, has a good relationship with his children from his first marriage, and is living a good life in a nice home in California where he has his own studio and is still creating great music.  So good for you Brian, and good for all the Beach Boys.  The Beach Boys have endured for 50 years because their songs sound great, are memorable, and span a range of topics.  It's not just all \\"Fun Fun Fun\\" but also deeper songs with deeper meanings and reflections on many aspects of life. They are the masters of layered sound and harmony arrangments.  Their voices are still great.  They do use additional back-up musicians now here and in their live shows to enhance their sound, but so what.  All the original guys are there and that is what matters.<br /><br />So I just had to have this newest record, the first they've done in quite a while, and it is a good one. The songs are a bit more \\"mature\\" in some respects than many of their early songs, but that makes sense given their their current stage of life. The title track which they've promoted as a single is very good. However, my two favorites are \\"The Private Life Of Bill And Sue\\" and \\"Shelter\\" which both have a great sound and terrific refrains.  While most of the songs have deeper themes, this is still, a large sense, vintage Beach Boys sound with those terrific layered harmonies and lyrics about the sun and the summer.<br />Brian Wilson wrote or co-wrote about all the songs and produced the album.  Great work boys !  Congratulations.  In a very real sense, the Beach Boys are \\"America's Beatles\\".  And our \\"Beatles\\" are still rockin!

I thought it was more a light romance than erotica. The sex is strangely lacking in detail for an erotic novel. And why do the characters constantly refer to each other as Mr or Mrs?

And I like his previous singles.<br />He actually explores themes I can relate to and this shows his maturity. All in all, I consider it a great album, worth the buy and I'd recommend it to anyone.

If you're a fan of the series or fantasy art in general it's a decent calendar to have in the house... just not the show piece that my annual fantasy calendar usually is (I was on a Valejo trip for a while, but it got samey... I did the Dragon Lance thing for a few years and random D&D stuff. The art in this is good like I said, just not my particular style prefrence especially since all 13 pictures are the same style.
B0068RHSCW|4.0|Dream House is a bit of an oddball film.  The storyline develops at a pretty exciting and appropriate pace (well, starting around the halfway point) and you're constantly wondering what's going on.<br /><br />I gotta admit something rather humorous however.  For the first half of the movie with all the people constantly entering the house as well as the children finding hidden back rooms by pushing on walls in the bedroom closet, I was thinking \\"This house has an unlimited number of secret entrance passages!\\"  You'll see what I mean by this comment when you watch it.  It's hilarious that the family had no idea that the teens around town were literally partying in a hidden section of their basement.  It's not funny NOW of course- not with the knowledge that... well, I won't spoil.  The knowledge that you have to see the movie the entire way through to know where I'm going with this!  This movie was made with the intention of the second half being critically important.<br /><br />Dream House definitely succeeds with flying colors right when it reaches the halfway point (45 minutes in).  I mean I certainly did NOT see the major twist coming.  Even though I remember a similar scene from another film, I can't remember if it was even executed in that movie as well as this one.  Once we reach the point of having an idea what might be going on in this supposed murder house (and it's just that- an idea and NOT an understanding of the entire situation at hand) our interest in how these events play out perk much higher (at least mine did).  A slow-moving and somewhat boring storyline has now suddenly become dramatically compelling.<br /><br />The question then becomes, who *really* murdered a mother and two children?  Was it a complete stranger or are all the suspicions that the father did it true?  I *was* wondering why the father was walking around free and that the small town cops weren't really expressing anger whenever they approached him- more like mild disappointment and a desire to keep away from him.<br /><br />Naomi Watts needs to stop being so dog on *hot!*  Seriously, what a cute face.  A face you want to cuddle up to in fact.<br /><br />Overall, about what I expected.  Just a well told and somewhat sad ending.
B005CKPQNE|4.0|Breaking Bad is one of the best on tv and I really enjoyed all four seasons (three seasons on Netflix) and S4 on Amazon. I am presently watching S5 and wanted to get completely caught up before the season began.  Right after I bought S4 on Amazon, Netflix came out with it on instant.  Oh well, still glad I got it.  Thanks for making it available.

B007IXWL2C|1.0|This review is for the third book in a series, and might be considered spoilerish - consider yourself warned.<br /><br />Yes it was painful, but I managed to get through all three of these books relatively unscathed. I did need to bleach my brain out afterwards, but I believe I've recovered and can now return to good books. I could have used a break period between books, but the last two turned up at the library at the same time, and with such a long wait list (why?), I felt it best to dig in and get it over with and pass them along. Now to the review, which I'm finding difficult because this book is less like a *story* and more like a series of vignettes that don't add to the plot (such as it is), or to the character development. Think of it as watching clips from your favorite movies on YouTube, bits and pieces that don't quite make up the whole.<br /><br />At the start, we find Ana and Christian on their honeymoon in the south of France, with some flashbacks to the wedding and events leading up to it. Ana ticks Christian off by removing her top at a nude beach, and despite the fact that she accepts his reasons for not doing so (paparazzi, ya know), he takes her back to their private yacht, handcuffs her hand-ankle, blindfolds her and marks her chest with a bunch of hickies so she won't be sunbathing again (that is a loving husband?). Ana shows a bit of backbone, but a few smirks and cocked heads from Christian bring her right back into the fold.<br /><br />\\"Why do I feel like I've entered the principal's office? This man had me in handcuffs yesterday. I refuse to be intimidated by him, he's my husband, damn it.\\"<br /><br />There are wasted pages of  being cool and filthy rich until the *cough* action finally returns to Seattle. Then we get some conflict between controlling Christian having issues with Ana returning to work. There's also some crazy person who is stalking the Greys. I won't spoil, but it's pretty damned easy to guess who the nutter is. This of course leads to a high-speed car chase, which leads our intrepid pair to a public parking garage. Can you guess what happens?<br /><br />\\"S***! We really are going to do this, in a public parking lot.\\"<br /><br />I actually have a better quote, but it contains multiple \\"F\\" bombs, and my recently bleached brain is trying to avoid them.<br /><br />Despite Christian's confession in book two that he's like an alcoholic trying to get sober, dumb stupid Ana can't resist her curiosity about the toys in the red room of pain. I will spare you the details, but I suspect you'll learn way more about butt plugs than you ever wanted to know.<br /><br />\\"Toys! Oh, I love, love, love this anticipation. The drawer closes and my breathing spikes. How can the sound of a drawer render me a quivering mess? It makes no sense.\\"<br /><br />No, it doesn't make any sense. Stop enabling the man.<br /><br />\\"Who cleans these toys?\\" I ask as I follow him over to the chest. He frowns at me, as if not understanding the question. \\"Me. Mrs. Jones.\\" \\"What?\\" He nods, amused and embarrassed, I think.\\"<br /><br />TMI<br /><br />The next little *play* takes our pair to Aspen, with BFF Kate and her brother, as well as Christian's brother and sister. They shop and drink and dance and stuff. Not sure why this little bit was included at all, except to club the reader over the head to remind us how filthy rich and gorgeous Christian is, and how hot all the men think Ana is.<br /><br />OK, back to Seattle via their private jet landing at SeaTac. Ms. James: no one lands their private jets at SeaTac, why would you when Boeing Field is so convenient? Even the president, who can use any airspace he damn well pleases lands at BFI. Every. Single. Time. he comes to Seattle. There's more stuff with the big mean baddie who is stalking the Greys, kerfuffles over his former subs, Christian getting mad, Ana cowering because she's afraid he won't want her if she doesn't like the kinky side of sex, kerfuffles over an accidental pregnancy (for once she shows some spirit), and lastly the silliest hostage situation ever. Seriously, you can stick a gun into the back of your pants and walk into a downtown bank? There is parking to be had in the back of the building? I told my coworkers about this development and they're laughing their arses off.<br /><br />Honestly, I still don't get why these are selling like hotcakes and being promoted heavily by the media outlets as the greatest books ever. This is not romance, this is sex with a heavy emphasis on the \\"F\\" word. I understand Christian was abused as a child, but that still does not count for him abusing others, and while he does show a tender side towards Ana, it doesn't make up for the abuse he dishes out (and I do mean abuse). Ana doesn't get any points for 1) being so terrified she'll lose Christian if she doesn't play along and 2) being the one to encourage him to continue, and that includes spanking.<br /><br />I know, I know - what goes on between two consenting adults and all, but there's a whole lot more baggage with this pair, and the conflicting messages just don't work to carry off such a feeble storyline. In the end, all you're going to have is a sexed up Bella and Edward, a very predictable baddie, and probably one of the worst epilogues ever. Worse yet, there's a peek at the back of the edition I had that begins the story all over again from Christian's POV. Please, tell me they're not going to publish these all over again.l pregnancy (for once she shows some spirit), and lastly the silliest hostage situation ever.

B004J4WKTW|5.0|I loved this book. It is incredible. Ms. Morgenstern writes like Ray Bradbury. Her story is a great balance bewteen fantasy and syfy. Her characters are so wonderful and well thought out.  I was able to really invest my time and emotion into them and at the end I felt like I was saying good-bye to my best friend. Just like Bradbury I will be reading this for years to come.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I don't usually read sci-fi, but this book has made me a new fan.  My son sat next to Mr. Howey on a recent plane ride and they talked about what they each do for a living...and he told him that he was a writer and the premise of this book...WOOL...  It caught my attention so I gave it a try.<br /><br />WHAT A RIDE!!  I totally enjoyed each and every page...and was totally shocked and surprised numerous times with twists and turns not expected.  This could be an awesome movie.<br /><br />I will definitely read all of the other books he's written and hope for many more additions to the WOOL saga.
B000A6T1JU|5.0|I have got to give rockstar games major props.. I would have never ever even known about this movie if it wasnt for the game I played the hell out of back on PS2. I played The video game before seeing the movie and comparing the entertainment value the video game is much more in depth then the movie its actually based off of, and I was a little dissapointed it wasnt as violent/jacking/drugs in the actual movie itself... Still, I have to give major credit to the man who wrote this movie because obviously I never would have played the game I love so much still to this day without the movie comming out back when it did. Too bad you can only find the directors cut it would seem, as I have noticed from another review here on amazon they did things to it like the comic fade/in out stuff in what is the only version ive seen/ben able to find.. Im kinda curious what it used to look like between takes with out that stuff.. All and all, its kind of a slow paced movie, but any one who has played the video game and liked it will absolutely find some peace with this movie, and it should not be missed. It is like an underground classic.

0525478817|5.0|Emotional. Torn-Hearts. Tears beyond Measure. Smiles. These are some of the things that were flowing through my body throughout the book. Tissues didn't come in an endless supply. But smiles followed the last words. If there were words that could describe a book of this measure, please tell me.<br /><br />John Green creates a world that we as humans can relate to. Not personally but we do know of these occurences in the world. Sometimes we just blow them off because it isn't happening to us. Or it could be because we just don't care. After reading this book, those thoughts were erased and I can say that I would wish this on no one.<br /><br />Agustus and Hazel are two of the most amazing characters that anyone would just randomly want to hug and take them home. I know I would! We fall in love with the characters as soon as will set our eys on the pages where they exist. The words that bring them to life. And for one, takes their life.<br /><br />The plot was one that wasn't fast-paced but one you would want to take the time to let it all sink in. Taking every word or sentence into our mind and processing it while struggling to hold back the tears.<br /><br />I know I have told people to repeatly give a book chance and dive into its pages. However, if there is one book that one must read before they die, than this is it. Compelling with words that will leavev you an emotional wreck, Mr. Green creates a novel that wraps the lives of many into one summary. Like I said words are unable to tell how great this book is but these are my words.<br /><br />I give this book 5 souls!
0547366205|5.0|My daughter loves this book. We read this before every nap and every bedtime.  I think she loves the rhyming prose, and the refrain that comes every two pages. (Babies love predictability and repetition!).<br /><br />The illustrations are beautiful, too.<br /><br />Just as importantly, I love this book!  It's fun to read and has a lovely theme.  I couldn't bear to read another Curious George book to her -- they are SO boring!
0316098329|5.0|Excellent book.  Period.  I loved every bit of this book and could not put it down.  It takes awhile (about 20 pages) to get used to the prose (Jack's voice), but once you do it flows.  This book is a testament to the strength we all possess within us, as well as how delicate and fragile we all are.  The mother's love shines through throughout this novel.  This book is beautiful and horrifying, all at once.

B0025UHKNS|1.0|I recently received this watch with a lot of anticipation for mapping my day to day outings on foot and bike.  I was attracted to the knowlege that Garmin tracks real miles and time traveled.  While I am not a runner, I am a big walker and have a great recumbant bike that i take almost everywhere.  Since today was my first day with this new gadget, I may update this after a couple of weeks of use.<br /><br />For a first day?  Not so great, very hard to understand how to best use.  I sense it will take a lot of personal interest and patience on my part to better understand how to utilize this multifaceted gadget.  So far today I am considering returning this product.  Too difficult and as one person wrote, not so easy to read while riding my bike.<br /><br />Probably will send this back.  I like my Polar watches, they give me what is most important, time in work-out, heart rates and some of my watches have goals.  I also can download all of my information on the polar website for logging long term progress and the opportunity for cross communication from other active people who may have some ideas of how I can up my daily performance.<br /><br />Polar is a much better product for someone like me who is not necessarily an athlete...runner, but a very, very active and exercise oriented person who wants to keep up with my movement and have knowlege of personal heart rate and calories burned.

B0012DW6W4|2.0|The acting was good and believable, Glenn Close, John Malkovich, Michelle Pfeiffer, Uma Thurman, all played their parts well. But I simply didn't enjoy seeing the depraved natures of the characters Close and Malkovich played - it was quite awful, even in a movie.
B006TLFIAQ|4.0|Good action flick, guns, explosions, and more.<br />Jason Statham is always good, Clive Owen is killer, and anything with Robert De Niro is a plus.<br />Worth a rental.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|The reason I bought this book is because I like a little play with my sex, and someone said: BDSM erotic novel. However, I'm not sure that I should even be reviewing it, because I couldn't get past the beginning of the second chapter. The narrative is horrifically written. The unrelenting present-tense, first person account drove me up the wall. This is a style that at best should be used sparingly to create a sense of urgency, and an entire book written this way feels amateurish and jarring. The main heroine started pissing me off from the first sentence. If I could see any redeeming qualities, I would probably have made an effort to finish it, but there were none. $10 wasted.
B00005MP58|5.0|My video came right on time and in good shape. This is a vendor you can depend on. Plus I love my new purchase of Pride and Prejudice.
B00884GR0W|5.0|I never thought I'd be excited by a game like this, but for the price I was tempted to try it. I've been very happy with the purchase, and the authors are constantly updating the product.<br /><br />To start with, the game has a role playing element. There are quests to do. Levels to gain. Experience to earn. With each level earned you can allocate points to different attributes. These attributes are things like traveling faster, flying faster, more mana, more health, more melee damage, better ranged damage, etc.<br /><br />One can explore the computer generated realms of the game. There is the surface world, with floating islands in the sky, subterranean caves, fantastic cliffs and land bridges, glaciers, lakes, oceans. A variety of climates as well. Deserts, forests, jungles, swamps, meadows, boreal forests, snow covered mountains, and iced over oceans. Beneath the ocean's surface there's kelp forests, coral reefs, and underwater caverns.<br /><br />The computer generated realms also includes Moria, a sub-surface world populated by goblins, quest givers, new kinds of stone and artifacts to dig up. Even deeper down is Hell, a vast realm of danger, exotic ores and monsters, and quest givers. There is also a ancient sky realm, for those that dare to fly or build a structure high enough. In the sky realm one finds more unusual ores to mine, as well as unusual plants and stone. One can even mine the clouds of the sky realm.<br /><br />One can create and save multiple worlds, and move between these worlds exploring, collecting materials. The Lite version of the game does not allowing saving of one's character, whereas the paid version does. Each generated world is vast, you'll probably never see the edges of the world, unless you start moving and keep so for decades (real time, not game time).<br /><br />Filling all these realms are common and not so common animals and monsters. The game already has some 85 different kind of mobs. Some friendly, some as sources of foodor hide, and many that are hostile. These are all rendered as polygon, textured models, and not as animated blocks. This includes the quest givers as well. No animated blocks that vaguely like the intended entity.<br /><br />The game includes crafting, and the list of what can be crafted is constantly growing with each update. General categories include crafted building materials, weapons, vehicles, furniture, game aids (like teleporters), health & mana potions, etc.<br /><br />There is an active web site and forum devoted to the game where one can find advice, tips, crafting recipes, construction contests, and idea submissions for the game creators.<br /><br />One really can't go wrong with this game for the price.

B004RKSAU6|5.0|My mother watched the French Chef avidly while I was growing up. I got a copy of this book from the school library when I was sixteen and renewed it every two weeks for an entire school year,so that I could work my way through the book. I had very few failures ,mainly due to my own inexperience as a cook. I was pretty motivated to learn as I come from a family of excellent chefs in a culture that values culinary prowess as a negotiating point on the marriage market. Nigerians love being able to brag about their wives' prowess in \\" cooking \\"Oyibo\\"(European) food very well! \\" My favorite recipe is the roast chicken: when I got this one down,I really felt accomplished. I feel it is a great intro to an ancient cooking tradition.

B0018QQQK8|5.0|When I first started reading this book I had no idea how good it would be.  It was a great storyline with some pretty interesting characters that I fell in love with.  Nicholas Sparks really did a good job with this book and it is definently my favorite of his that i have read so far.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|Prometheus is a Ridley Scott masterpiece, and it is every bit as good as Alien and Blade Runner. I fail to see how and why ths film is getting such harsh reviews, at least Roger Ebert got it right. My one star review is for 20th Century Fox's Blu-ray/DVD + Digital Copy only.<br /><br />I am a little bit of a film buff and back in the day was an avid Laserdisc collector. I had all my favorite films on Laserdisc in Widescreen and watched them often. Laserdisc at the time the best way to enjoy your favorite movies in all their glory. My player was not a very expensive one so after almost an hour or so i would have to take a short intermission and flip the disc over. This was not an issue for me at all and sometimes myself or company would see this as a perfect opportunity for a bathroom break.<br />When DVD first hit the market in the US i knew that the picture and sound quality was nowhere close to the quality of a Laserdisc so i decided not to purchase one. I also knew that there was a better version available in Japan at that time, the Blu-ray, that used zero compression and had a picture and sound that even surpassed that of the Laserdiscs. Many years later however the DVD's became so cheap that it became obvious to me that this was a great way to fill in the gaps in my film collection, so i not only purchased a DVD player, i started collecting DVD's as well. Then many years after that the Blu-ray's were finally made available to the US market and sold countless amounts to many people who did not even know what a Laserdisc was.<br /><br />I still do not own a Blu-ray player, even though i own a copy of Guillermo Del Toro's Directors Cut of Mimic and Zack Snyder's Extended Cut of Sucker Punch on Blu-ray. Unfortunately these films and many others i am sure, were only made available in the Blu-ray format. I have not seen these films yet because i refuse to use my Sony Playstation 3 to view them. If you have spent what i've spent on a new laser and new drive for your Playstation you would not use yours to watch movies on either. Someday i will no doubt have to shell out the extra cash for a Blu-ray player because some of the films from Directors i love are only making their films available in that format.<br /><br />It is amusing that there are so many reviews on Amazon for Prometheus as a film, even though when this review was written there was not even a release date for this Blu-ray/DVD + Digital Copy.<br />As a fan of Prometheus and Ridley Scott i will wait to purchase a copy in the hopes that there may be some sort of later Collectors Edition made available that delves deeply into the filmmaking process. An edition that perhaps shows how H.R. Giger's design work for an unfilmed Dune, and the hauntingly beautiful mural seen on the ceiling made it into the film. An edition that shows how the special effects were created and why everything looked so huge and real, the best special effects i have seen in any film, with the exception of 2001 a Space Odyssey.<br />I hope that if there is a Collectors edition made available in the future, it is not just available in Blu-ray. Although if that is the only way to purchase this great film with some great suplemental material, i will obviously be forced to get one.<br /><br />I am not at all concerned about getting a 3D version of Prometheus even though it was filmed with 3D cameras. I have a beautiful 2D Collectors Edition DVD of James Cameron's Avatar, and even though this film was shot using the same 3D cameras, it looks just spectacular to me in 2D. I am a fan of seeing films in the 3D format as long as they were filmed with 3D cameras, otherwise i wont waste my money. For me seeing a film in 3D at the theater is a rare treat that i do enjoy, but at home i am quite comfortable watching in 2D. As you may have guessed i do not own a Plasma or LCD TV either. A great film is a great film, even if you are only watching it in 2D, on a 57 inch Toshiba Rear Projection TV.<br /><br />I for one cannot wait to see Prometheus again. When i saw it in the theater in 3D i was in awe. There were numerous moments throughout watching Prometheus that i said wow to myself. The 3D effect was used quite well and added a greater depth to the visuals, although the effect was used quite differently than say Avatar or Hugo.<br />For some reason when a film is converted from 3D to 2D the film still looks quite striking, as is the case with my 2D DVD version of Avatar, but when a 2D movie is converted into 3D it really looses much more than it gains.<br /><br />Revised review...<br /><br />I have had some interesting responces to this review, in the single most important one i was told that this Blu-ray set would have suppliments on the Blu-ray disc, and possibly the DVD would have a commentary. Therefore i have adjusted my review score to reflect the brilliant film that Ridley Scott made and a disc set that will apparently contain bonus content.<br /><br />Way back when i still watched Lasediscs a good friend of mine owned a video store and was very much in the know about video technology. It would have been easy for him to upsell me on DVD's when they came out and for me to get a player, then he could rent and sell me Lasediscs and DVD's. He stated to me that there was already a technology that was being worked on that used zero compression in the audio and video. This new technology promised to provide better than Laserdisc picture and sound. It would seem by the actual invent dates that Blu-ray did not exhist until 2006, nine years after the introduction of the DVD. But the Blu-ray technology was being developed none the less. My friend told me at the time to continue to watch and enjoy my Lasediscs and just hold out until the smaller video discs were perfected. He also told me that the DVD discs used compression to store the information on the disc and that the Laserdisc did not, this is why the Laserdisc had a better picture and sound than when DVD's were first introduced. I was actually shown a side by side comparison of a Laserdisc vs DVD so i could choose for myself. What i saw was a far better picture on the Laserdisc than on the DVD, and to me the Laserdisc sounded better as well.<br /><br />One of the responces i recieved mentioned that i was being silly for not using my Playstation to view Blu-ray's. After shelling out close to two hundred dollars for a new laser and drive for my old school 6 gig console, i will only use my Playstation to play games. If money were no object to me obviously i would'nt care and i would use it to watch Blu-ray's, but then again if that was the case, i would have purchased a DVD player back in 1995-1997 when they first came out.<br /><br />I still find it amusing that there are reviews for a product that does not yet exhist.

B00280LYIC|5.0|I seriously just ran into this book, all as an accident. I was planning to read a book for my visit, and instead of \\"the shadows in the sea\\", I brought this amazing book with my kindle. I actually as an adventure/mystery story lover, herd of Rich Riordan and his exceptional piece of work, the \\"Percy Jackson series\\". Though I had been advised by my friends to read the awesome series myself, I never got rounded up with it. It is like going to the library and finding out that all the books all checked out, again, and again, and again... till you quitted.<br />The storyline itself is interesting: there is this world we live on, but there are gods and half -bloods -literally children born between Gods and mortal- (note that Zeus had a lot of woman issues). I think it was sweet of me to run into this book, and it will be a five star for these reasons: creative, original, a bit of laughter, and a lot of fun. Hope you enjoy this book. I mean, why not?

B005LAII08|5.0|Last year, Disney- Pixar created Cars 2, the first critical disappointment film and box office disappointment that was saved by merchandise sales that everyone agreed it was the worst film even it didn't look like Pixar that this year's Brave tries to bring Pixar back to basics with a story of a princess that seeks out her destiny until she comes a witch that changes things for her and her family that now she's got to save her mother before it's too late and figuring herself out. Not Pixar's best or worst film but it's a start that's what I said on opening weekend when me and friend went to see it, it was good and another female character this year that doesn't need men saving her that she can take care of herself just like Katniss from The Hunger Games! Pixar's back in business and coming from a guy that seen 5 Pixar's straight films in theatres included enjoyed Cars 2 so much! Buy Brave on blu-ray, blu-ray 3D and dvd soon!

B008JH5CVS|2.0|*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*This movie had quite a bit of potential...but just didn't work. The concept was quite different. But was looking for a more out of the box execution. Like finding the only possible way into a place that suppose to not be broken into(which they didn't do he just strolled on board). They shouldn't have killed all the hostages. I would have settled for snow and the girl going out of their way to get them out. And Mase!!!????...there was no need...that story line made now sense?? Maybe if they had better presented what he was doing it might have made more sense. They had at least three different story line 1.) Snow & the girl 2.) Snow & mase 3.) and a briefcase that was suppose to tie it all together. And it just didn't work. Wasn't the worst movie, but i wouldn't have gone to see it in theaters. This one is a miss.

B008JH5CVS|1.0|Bad Bad and a sinker too. Poor acting and stupid plots  and  another bomb for the box office. This moive been done before and actors would tell them do not give up your day job. The goofy guy should have been blow away right form the get go and bad guys were a bunch of walking and talking stiffs.  Buy it if you want but do not pay over $5.00 for it.
0810970686|5.0|My daughter is ten and loves this series. So whenever she gets done with one we order the next. This one she absolutely loved.
B0088RQ4X4|2.0|This movie should been called the John the jumping bean Carter, I never did figure out what the guys with octo arms were doing. Plots were thin been there and done that And actors were the worse no wonder it bomb. I ask if they were going to do number 2 ha ha ha  what joke if they do. i say if you buy this movie and pay over $2.00 bucks for it your getting rip off good. I can only give it 2 stars and I am being kind at that.
1610660242|5.0|You can spend so much time reading the hard, formal, theoretical books that have some interesting anecdotes, tools and tips. But if you need a break for the heavy lifting of personal development but do not want to waste your time on trash reading then this is the perfect book for you.<br /><br />Not often can you enjoy a great read and still take away a number of learnings...in fact this will challenge most people to do more, do it differently and do it now than many other business books.<br /><br />At its very core this is a simple story about a very passionate group of people that have delivered a dream. Scratch deeper and you find a book that is broken into 3 key sections:<br /><br />1. Profits;<br />2. Profit and Passion;<br />3. Profits, Passion and Purpose<br /><br />Tony Hsieh shares his personal jouney, warts and all, and we learn about many things in the process. Things like committing fully to your dream and vision, inspiring those around you, never giving up, focusing on your customers, developing a strong culture, keeping the right people and creating a business model that is sustainable in  the short and long term. Sounds so simple...and it is...but harder to put into practice each and every day. Reading this book will not give you the tools, models and frameworks of a HBR but it is not suppose to. What it will give you is a renewed sense of passion, purpose and the desire to create profit...<br /><br />What more could you ask for!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|This game keeps me so entertained. Only gave 4 stars because yes it's a great game but I was asked to give 5 stars, should just say you'd love a good rating. Not a 5 star rating.
B00005JKMQ|3.0|The problem with doing bios of contemporary figures, is that they are still here for comparison. After just watching the press conference scene w Ali and Don King, I had to write this review. Often, the re-enactment in bios exaggerates real life. But in this case, the actors (and I like and respect both of them) couldn't even come close to the energy and personality of the real Ali and Don King. Pathetic. Just watch [[ASIN:B00007ELEK When We Were Kings]]to see the real deal.
0307887448|5.0|Great story, wrapped in the trappings of 80s pop culture.<br /><br />I recently discovered Ernie at a convention and had the privilege to hear him speak at a few panels before I was able to read RPO.  Very interesting and funny guy who wrote one hell of a good book.  Highly recommended!
B007IXWL2C|1.0|This trilogy is like watching a wreck, you just can't seem to look away! Like many other reviews, i think it's a Love it or Hate it book. I hated it. Poorly written, the descriptions are so repetitive that they become annoying. Add to that a terribly abusive relationship, that no one should live with, and there's the wreck! I'm sorry i paid for this trilogy, i just wanted to know what all the fuss was about :)
0307959856|1.0|I love Pride and Prejudice, and I love P.D. James' Inspector Dalgliesh mysteries, so I was hoping for an intriguing combination of the two. Alas, it was not to be.<br /><br />Instead, we're subjected to an extremely dry story of a murder followed by an arrest. No one ever tries to solve the mystery; the solution is eventually handed to us on a platter. Details surrounding the murder are repeated endlessly; discussed by the characters, rehashed at the inquest, then trotted out once more for the trial. But more importantly, there's no reason to care about the outcome. The person accused of the crime is someone we don't even like. No one we care for is in the slightest bit of jeopardy; that is, if it can be said we care for anyone at all.<br /><br />I had to wonder why P.D. James chose to set this story in the world of Pride and Prejudice. She could, in fact, have concocted the same story from scratch, set during that time period but with characters of her own. I suspect the result would've been better than this mess, because then she would've had to put at least a little effort into character development. As it is, she relies completely on our already being familiar with (and in love with) the characters of Pride and Prejudice. Unfortunately, that initial good will can only take us so far. By the end of this book, I began to wonder how Elizabeth could've married someone so positively dull and humorless.<br /><br />P.D. James is one of our finest mystery writers. I hope readers will not judge the quality of her other books based on her unfortunate misstep here.

B0002NRQTI|5.0|This album [[ASIN:B0002NRQTI Counterparts]] has some of my favorite songs on it. These guys perfectly express my own attitude toward various aspects of life: \\"Don't swallow the poison\\" in \\"Stick It Out\\", describing the importance of individuals even if they're \\"Nobody's Hero\\", and the musical indulgence of \\"Leave That Thing Alone!\\"<br /><br />I like that Rush wasn't afraid to make the music and songs that expressed what they thought and felt, and not to just follow what was 'commercially viable'. Time has proven them right to do so.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I realize now after seeing this movie,I never saw color in a person. We had colorful family reunions,so it wasn't something we saw. The Help was an emotional, moving movie that made me want to shake the  shoulders of everyone but Skeeter. The beauty of her heart was so amazing. This movie I realize is how the country should have changed and still should change,in so many ways. This is so true to life in that,it left me and my daughter raw with emotion that there was a life, like this, outside our world. It was called color. America it seems can't let go, even in 2012 over skin color issues. I mean nothing,NOTHING is different in the people in this movie and in the audiences, but one teeny thing,their skin color. Everything else is the same. Every body part of men and of women and of children is the same. This is how it is suppose to be. So The Help makes you aware, if you weren't already,that there should not be a difference. It grabs a hold of your soul, as it did Skeeters mom and Skeeters \\"good riddance  ,boyfriend, but sadly in opposite ways. I recommend watching and purchasing this wonderful movie and remembering it after you walk out of the theatre or your living room  and never forget it. Be a Skeeter and  love. You will have one less sin to account for at Heavens door ,if hate isn't among them.  A very good movie with amazing actors.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This book was recommended by a friend. Found it to have an interesting subject matter and also a very unexpected ending. It was worth the read.
B0000UJDLM|4.0|Short circuit is about a military robot that is struck by lightning and basically begins to act human.  He befriends Stephanie Speck and she tries to help him.  While the military wants it's robot back, there is one particular fellow, Newton Crosby, who tries to meet with Stephanie to get \\"Number 5\\" back.  Newton winds up telling a joke to Number 5 and Number 5 starts laughing, proving it is alive.  This was a very good film.  I'd recommend it.
0743297334|1.0|The book is about the protagonist Jake Barnes. It details his many days as an expat in Spain and France. The trouble is that there isn't much to his days except for drinks, breakfast, lunch, and more drinks. Jake and his friends, Robert, Mike, and Bill along with the loose Lady Brett Ashley get soused and dance at bars and argue and drink and vie for the attention of said loose Lady Brett Ashley. Mike is Ashley's current beau but Robert keeps trying to take her away while Jake(who says he's already been with Lady Ashley) is still secretly in love with her and suffers in silence.<br />Throw in a bull fight or two along with a fist fight between Robert and Jake, an affair between the bullfighter, Pedro Romero and the loose Lady Brett Ashley and you have the entirety of the 251 page boring melodrama.<br />If you are at all curious who the 34 year old loose Lady Brett Ashley chooses in the end, you'll have to suffer through reading the entire bunk like I did or skip to page 247.
B005LAIHPE|5.0|I will tell anyone who loves action packed films like transformers or better to get this movie cause it is really bad-ass no lies people im telling the truth cause I saw this movie in theaters and I absolutely Loved it I walked out of the Theater telling myself im getting this movie when it comes out.and the action scenes in it OMG! there awesome there so good I will watch this movie 10 times or more.and if you love seeing ships/explosions ETC this is the movie.GET THIS MOVIE WHEN IT COMES OUT PEOPLE!!

B007L3BMGA|4.0|After all the hype about this book I was a little tentative at first, but soon became absorbed, as so many of my friends and acquaintances had before me.  I found that having been written in the first-person and therefore able to include the delightful antics of her sub-conscious and her \\"inner goddess\\", E. L. James has written an entertaining, if light, tale which has been thoroughly fleshed out (in several ways!) to make a novel of what is really quite a short story.  As the end of the book approached I was enthralled enough to quickly whip onto Amazon and buy the rest of the trilogy and read them all in a matter of a couple of weeks.  (OK eventually I'd had my fill of the raunchy stuff but I think E L James figured that and the third book has more action - but this is supposed to be about the first book).  On behalf of womankind, I wish all men would read it and learn from Christian's (non-kinky) expertise!
B004LWZW7E|5.0|This movie is about money meaning nothing and time meaning everything. In effect, time in the future equates to the value of money today. Very cool concept. I love to watch futuristic movies, and this movie did not disappoint.<br /><br />Justin Timberlake and Amanda Seyfried was in the movie. I think they did a great job. I will admit that sometimes when a big singing star acts in a movie, it is hard for me to get passed that person is a singing star. Automatic strike against them. Well, Justin Timberlake's performance convinced me he was a solid actor and he did a wonderful job. Amanda Seyfried was gutsy and fun to watch. Those two carried the movie well. I thought everyone did excellent actually. I understood the movie's concept. I loved the action sequences. It kept my attention, and honestly, this is the type of movie I would watch if it came on television a thousand times, which some movies do.<br /><br />I can't say anything bad about the movie actually. There is no over the top adult content. It is based in the future. So, I took it for what it is worth. I hope to see Justine Timberlake in more movies and Amanda Seyfried, as well.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Hours of fun! Very addictive! A few games are impossible to complete but I give this app 5 stars anyway!
0307744434|2.0|Could have been a visually-stunning movie, unfortunately it is a book, black and white. The characters seems to be rather mundane, one-dimentiional (mysterious). The plot started off weak (with the same one-dimentiional theme), it slowly built up however all crumbled to nothing which is rather a big disappointment. Certainly not a book for everyone, thought I think this would made a visually magnificent movie.
B0087HT36U|5.0|this is a truly awesome game. the game is similar to Angry Birds, with some new twists. the only thing I found wrong with it was, that it had in app purchasing without letting you know on the app description. the game has a lot of levels but I wish it had a few more. there is supposedly going to be a cowboy age in the game. I am hoping that they make it. but, awesome game!
B003L77GG0|5.0|I have been a fan of Smallville since it premiered back in 2001 and I knew there will be a day when the show will end and unfortunately it has come and gone. However, thanks to DVD, I can always \\"Hold onto Smallville\\" by watching these DVDs and re-live and cherish the final season of the show for the rest of my life. Smallville fans, I highly recommend that you buy it to complete your Smallville set.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|pretty good game....sometimes it freezes and you have to shut down the kindle...but enjoyable still. FYI takes up a lot of space
071198042X|5.0|The legend that is Freddie Mercury is detailed beautifully in this book. Peter Freestone's honest and open account of his years as Freddie's personal assistant is wonderfully outlined, from Freddie's passionate immersion in his music to his rise as a superstar and final days at his side. I couldn't put the book down. I believe I know Freddie much more now as a person and musician. If you are a Freddie Mercury fan, this book is a must. Very highly recommended!
B00881VLCE|4.0|I enjoy these as a relaxing break @work. Sometimes, I come up w/ideas while working them out. Also, they relieve tension &amp; clear my head. Then, I can calmly tackle the next issues that need to be addressed.
1401937519|1.0|1. If I had been the editor of this book, it probably would have ended up as a short story. There is not enough substance to this book to warrant it being novel-sized. I do not need to read for the 3rd or 4th time regarding a particular part of your NDE. I remembered it the first time I read it.<br /><br />2. I get the feeling that this NDE provided Anita with what she needed for HER life. I found very little to glean from her experience, as I don't participate in self-hatred or fear/anxiety. You're given what you're ready for-- what you need at the time. I felt at the end of the book that Anita learned an important lesson (don't allow fear to run your life), but then appears to just... well... stagnate.<br /><br />3. I question whether this was an actual NDE or just an OBE (Out of Body Experience). After all, she was in a coma-- organs were starting to shut down, but she was not clinically dead. I'm not an expert on NDEs, but hers seemed to lack a completeness, if that makes any sense.<br /><br />4. I picked this book up from the library on a recommendation from a friend, and after reading the glowing reviews here on Amazon. I'm glad I didn't waste my money. Honestly, the only real value I found was her mention of a NDE website within the pages.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|The word choice is bad and redundant, the plot is predictable, the main characters are annoying. Despite its flaws after a 10 hour shift at work when I no longer want to think, I will read this book. At first I thought the sex scenes were over the top but you really have to admire the devotion to describing their sex life. This is not good literature and it is not going to give you any kind of insight on anything. However, this is the kind of thoughtless trash I want to read when I want something to numb my mind a little. Yes, Christian Grey is unrealistic but sometimes it is nice to just fantasize. Anastasia is unlikeable but she really is not why I am reading this book.<br />When I was in college I would spend hours studying and after that all I would want to do is read a book that didn't make me think too much and that was when I found twilight. SO if you are reading these books to escape your life then you might be a little less disappointed.<br />Read this book in the right mindset. Think about this book as a mindless video game or a corny hallmark movie.

B008COII1Y|1.0|We made it to chapter IV and couldn't take it anymore. This movie is slow, tedious, boring, and definitely one of the worst zombie movie I've seen yet. I love zombie movies, but this one is pretty awful. I'm really surprised that it had a 3-star rating. That was the reason why we chose this movie over other zombie movies. Big mistake...
B004TJ1H3C|3.0|Since the last episode of Stargate SGU aired, I haven't watched the SyFy Network at all. I've missed the Stargate series (all of them) and it's clear that the network has no interest in producing customer-quality and popular series that, yes, might be expensive, but that's part of successful programming. In short, the network's decisionmakers are idiots. They had some templates that worked and they blew it. The stuff they have now is junk.<br /><br />Stargate Atlantis was great. SGU was cheap...but it grew on you. I didn't really watch it until I bought the DVDs. And it's strange that Season 1 was released in Blu-Ray and the second and best was not. It's just like SGA. The network just one day decided to pull the plug despite the viewership, quality and the fact that it was making money.
B007SGM084|5.0|Unexpected love story.  Adult, erotic and dark at times but a love story through and through.  Makes you laugh and takes your breath away. The characters stay with you long after the chapters are done.
B005LAIHQS|4.0|I definitely enjoyed seeing this movie. Now, I have to admit that when I saw this movie in the theater, I had only very recently seen the first movie in the trilogy. I have not yet seen the 2nd one. However, I was still able to legitimately laugh at certain parts of this one. When I go to a movie, I don't usually expect to be blown away by how good or bad a movie is. I didn't really get blown away by this one, but at the same time, I was never anxious to know how much more time was left in the movie. There were a few slightly grotesque things shown, but that's to be expected in a movie like this, considering what happened in the first movie, and the fact that it's a sci-fi movie. The thing that surprised me the most was that there were a few touching scenes sprinkled into it--most notably toward the end of the movie. If you're looking for a somewhat light-hearted, sci-fi comedy, then I highly recommend checking this film out.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I THOUGHT THE BOOKS WERE GOOD, ENJOYABLE READING. IT HAD AN INTERESTING STORY LINE. SOME PEOPLE TOOK IT SO FAR. DAMN! IT'S NOT A TRUE STORY. RELAX! OR STICK TO HARLEQUIN ROMANCE NOVELS.
1469984202|5.0|Wow!<br />Wool is a fantastic series. I purchased the omnibus version just to have the complete story so far, if it turned out good. I am glad i did since I could hardly put the story down. Good writing, good storyline, great characters. What more could you ask for?...Well, since you asked...more stories in the series.<br /><br />With over 1400 reviews so far, this series hardly needs another one, and yet those who create (the authors) so much enjoyment deserve the praise. 5 stars for the fun, interesting series and I look forward to more books form Mr Howey.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|She is a self-possessed, resourceful teenager from a fatherless, extremely low income family who loves her little sister so much that she would do anything to feed and protect her, including risking her own life.<br /><br />She does not want to change the world or be a hero, a celebrity, a wife, a mother, a girlfriend. Neither is she greedy, self-centered, delinquent, or a slave to her hormones. She is single-mindedly focused on caring for her sister. She sounds almost pathological but for her selfless purpose. This story is about where her single-minded purpose takes her.<br /><br />The setting (dystopian future) and the risky activities (hunting--even to avoid starvation--is a capital offense, and, of course, there is The Games) are just fantastic dressing which will appeal to some and not others. There seems to be some love interests but our protagonist sees romance as secondary, something to use when necessary for her singular purpose, though some will want to make more of it all.<br /><br />When I first read the books--way before talks of making a movie surfaced--I thought that they would never be able to make this story into a movie with all the teenage gladiators killing each other. It would have to be rated R, thus eliminating much of the target audience. Props to director Ross for getting this rated PG-13.<br /><br />I am not a fan of the shaky, handheld camera technique as a substitute for well-crafted action and fight sequences, but evidently this director is. On the other hand he does a lot of things right: the pacing, the look and feel, the amazing forest fire scene (how did they do that?), the focus on story and character and not gratuitous CG effects and violence.<br /><br />Collins is a brilliant storyteller and her screenplay is nicely adapted for the two-hour-plus film format. I cheered, I boo-ed, I cried, but I don't remember as many LOLs as I got with her books. The soundtrack is dreary but I suppose that's fitting. Costumes and make-up fit wellin the same way.<br /><br />The casting had some great choices. Lawrence had just been nominated for an Oscar for her turn in the R-rated Winter's Bone as a self-possessed, resourceful teenager from a fatherless, extremely low income family who would do anything to feed and protect her younger siblings, including risking her life. (Lawrence's characters in each story had dysfunctional mothers to drag along as well.) I am sure she can play other roles, too, but she was the right choice here. Harrelson, Banks, Tucci, and Sutherland were great choices, too. I am not a fan of Hutcherson in general or Kravitz in particular, though they did not seem to stink up the joint too much here. The rest of the cast did not have enough screen time to leave an impression on me, though some of their characters are better developed in the books.<br /><br />I pre-ordered the Blu-Ray, so I can't review any media products until they ship. But I read the books several times and saw this movie in the theater in between. I highly recommend them all for teenagers of all ages.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app! It has wonderful devotional plans, and multiple translations of the Bible. I don 't need any other Bible app!!
0380977273|1.0|Maybe it is just that this book it's style, it's prose did not translate well for me here in the UK but I cannot understand the fascination with something I do not understand. It's a coming of age novel but the language is too rich and poetic for my liking \\" They ran in urine smell of shadow, they ran in clean ice smell of moon. The calliope steam-throb whispered, tatted, trilled.\\"....\\"in flight, in heat-spell river of wind and blaze of metal, in jog of July and August horses whose hoofs thudded the air like thrown fruit, his eyes blazed\\"<br /><br />I thought Boy's Life by Robert McCammon truly inspiringly brilliant (in fact I find anything by McCammon brilliant) but Something Wicked This Way Comes for me had few redeeming features the richness of language made a truly boring experience and I struggled to finish...I admire those of you who found inspiration from Bradbury's words but sadly not me :((
B007SO31BQ|5.0|Enjoyed this movie. Alot of footage in the movie that I have never seen before along with material that Ive never known. It does have alot of english subtitles because alot of the people in the movie are speaking Portugese. Some are bilingual however including Senna. A fan of any open wheel racing will enjoy movie.
034580404X|5.0|I started reading this story only after a friend of mine pestered me about it & I got tired of hearing about it in the media. I'm glad I decided to read it as once I did, I could not put it down.<br /><br />Let me address some of the more negative reviews first. Yes it does address a more alternative lifestyle in explicit detail but does so with taste. People have said it nothing more than porn on paper but this is way off the mark. The explicit scenes are there to help develop the characters and lay the groundwork for the plot.  They are intense and graphic but that is what pulls the reader into the story. You have to be able to see past the sex in order to get into the characters heads and see where the story is going.<br /><br />On a positive note, and there are many for this trilogy, the books lead right into each other and are very hard to put down. The scenes get intense and even had me in tears toward the end of book 1, cheering toward the end of book 2 and on edge toward the end of book 3. Any writing that elicits those kinds of responses must be good.<br /><br />Overall, keep in open mind, even if you don't always agree, pay attention to the character set up/plot and enjoy the story. It is well worth the read as I loved it.

0446581356|3.0|As with any book, I recommend checking this one out from your local library first if that is an option. I did learn some terrific tips from this book. How to create depth by layering blush, same layering for eyeliner, etc. The problem came in with her product type/color recommendations. It seemed like many recommendations came with a disclaimer that they did not apply to alabaster skin. I have alabaster skin. What am I supposed to do? I've turned to books because I've spent a small fortune trying to find makeup that works with my skin and so far, no luck! I hoped an expert could help me. Instead, I get a lot of sentences like \\"Everyone needs a yellow-based concealer, except maybe those with alabaster skin...\\" Except? Maybe? What do I need to banish my dark circles?????? Sigh. This isn't the book to answer all of my questions. However, it is helpful, and I learned some tricks I didn't know before. On top of that, I was reminded of a few I'd forgotten in the hustle and bustle of my daily life. So the book is worth checking out and reading. If you're totally new to makeup and interested in creating a daily look, it's probably worth a purchase. Otherwise, give it a look at the library.

B007L6VR12|5.0|Wes Anderson's Moonrise Kingdom opens with the sound of the composer Benjamin Britten's \\"Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra,\\" which breaks down, piece by piece, each section of the orchestra and then later builds it back up.  The work is reminiscent of opening up a pocket watch in order to see all of the gears working in conjunction.  It is not lost on the audience that as Britten's music is deconstructed, Anderson presents the inside of a household, using perfectly choreographed camera movements, that is itself immaculately designed by the eye of an idiosyncratic artist.  This got me thinking: is Wes Anderson one of our greatest creators of fantasy worlds?<br /><br />It might seem strange to suggest that Anderson should be mentioned alongside people like C.S. Lewis, J.R.R. Tolkien, and George R.R. Martin.  You won't find dragons or magic spells in his work, but what you will find is a hermetically sealed universe that seems to jump wholesale out of the mind of a singular artist.  Is Anderson's fetish for vintage audio equipment that far removed from Tolkien's love of medieval verse?  While every one of Anderson's films is created in a world that is slightly out of step from our own, of all his live action work Moonrise Kingdom seems to rest out on its own plane of existence.<br /><br />And much of Moonrise Kingdom's potency comes from the understanding that children and adults inhabit distinct and separate realms.  The film takes place in the 1960s on a sleepy New England island, New Penzance, which is not only largely separated from the mainland but also bares a name that would look comfortable written on a map of a fantasy world.  This close knit community is frayed when two young children, Sam and Suzy, go on the lam, making their way deep into the woods of the island thanks to skills Sam has picked up attending the Khaki Scouts.  As the children retreat into the wilderness, the adults scramble to catch up with them.  As we move back and forth between the adult world and the world of children, we understand the distinct sort of dysfunction that infects both.  In the 1960s both Sam and Suzy might have been called \\"trouble children.\\"  Sam is an orphan who doesn't fit in well with his foster family (in fact, his foster father decides that he won't invite him back to the house after hearing about his flight) and Suzy is prone to outbursts of violence and rage.  But where the children have trouble suppressing their emotions, the adults, in typical Andersonian fashion, hide their dysfunction under a laconic haze.  Suzy's mother and father (played by Francis MacDormond and Bill Murray) are mired in a loveless marriage, which has led her mother to take up with the local police chief, Sharp (Bruce Willis).<br /><br />Wes Anderson clues us into his interest in world making through a series of books that Suzy brings along on her retreat with Sam.  These books carry fantastical names like The Francine Odyssey, The Disappearance of the 6th Grade, and The Girl from Jupiter.  This need for escapism obviously parallels the children's flight into the woods.  To disappear into the world of fantasy isn't far off from dropping off the map and slipping out from under the expectations of adults.  Anderson constructs this universe with the help of a map as well as the narrating power of Bob Ballaban, who doubles as a wizard-like character who figures out how to catch up with Sam and Suzy.  As the film progresses, it becomes further and further detached from our world.  In fact, at times it seems as if Anderson is applying techniques he learned in his animated film, The Fantastic Mr. Fox, onto a live action palate.  This allows him to ratchet up the scope of his film towards the end by introducing a flood that seems to be borrowed from one of the world's most famous fantasy epics, The Old Testament.<br /><br />But of all the great fantasy writers out there, perhaps none pervade Anderson's universe more than the great artist, Charles M. Schulz.Anderson, never one to be shy about his influences, even names a dog Snoopy.  In Peanuts, Schulz may have created one of the longest lasting fantasy worlds, stretching out over a half of a century.  And while he may have made the adults invisible (they only appeared in the TV specials as indecipherable and disembodied voices), he never ran away from adult concerns.  Where Anderson creates a world where two misfits can largely escape the dysfunctions of the adult world, Schultz had his prepubescent characters shoulder the crushing burdens of existential malaise.  And yet, there's something refreshing about the optimism found in Moonrise Kingdom, along with much of Anderson's work (an optimism that Schultz often struggled to find).  He manages to be both critical and highly empathetic towards his characters.  For Anderson, a fantasy world isn't so much a retreat as it is an invitation, and one that I am never hesitant to take up.

1932735410|4.0|Received this book and the the accompanying DVD as materials for a PMP exam-prep course (passed the PMP myself just this past week).    Very effective tool for studying the PMBOK.  The book was more up-to-date than most other course materials (very little legacy content from previous PMBOK editions, and only included intentionally for context).  Many sections of the PMBOK are widely-acknowledged as exam content, but only covered in a very summary treatment within the PMBOK itself.  The Rita guide does a very nice job of helping to fill-in where the PMBOK summarizes.    A couple of critical comments  1) The questions within the chapters are of limited use.  Many questions are overly simple.  I guess for helping keep the reader engaged through some often \\"dry\\" material?  I found myself skipping most of these questions after the first couple of chapters.  Within the chapters the questions that are not overly simple, as sometimes overly complex.  The PMP exam itself offers a calculator during testing, but the challenge of the math involved rarely requires a calculator (other than for speed).  However, some of the Rita questions in time, cost, and risk get overly complex.    2) The questions at the end of each chapter are the opposite, and quite useful.  The degree of difficulty is relatively similar.  The questions struggle to vary their approach to a broad enough base to approximate the exam (recommend also using [...] and/or headfirst exams for practice).  However the questions are excellent to ensuring that the command of the content has been acquired.    3) For the most part, Rita seems to be very \\"dialed-in\\" to the exam content.  Especially in critical areas of framework, integration, scope, time, cost, and team development/management.  Personally feel that risk section is adequate, but could use some fine-tuning.  The contracts section in my opinion over-emphasize point-of-assumption and \\"legalese\\" while not putting enough focus on understanding the types of contracts and the level of risk to the buyer vs. the seller for each.

B007IXWKUK|3.0|I don't understand why some people think every book they read should be well written or make perfect sense and be true to life. Read for the fun of it, for entertainment or just because you can. These are the thoughts and the imagination of someone else. Fifty Shades of Grey will not win any literary awards, but it is entertaining to say the very least. If nothing else the author achieved his goal in writing it. So, I will read the following books.......may as well.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|This was a terrific movie of Edgar Rice Burroughs lesser known John Carter (Barsoom) series! His vision was so far beyond the imagination of the people in his day it's incredible! People couldn't imagne flying machine's, four armed lifeforms, etc.  As a result this series was left behind with the poputlarity of Tarzan.  If you are a fan of ERB's and aware of the Barsoom series you will be entertained and appreciate this movie. If you have never heard of the Barsoom series you will still love it. Great story and great action all told in a cohesive plot you can follow.  While not really true to the plot of ERB's books the movie captures the essence and feel of the books better than most movie to book conversions. Planning for this movie has been in the works for decades. Good CGI finally made it possible. They finally made a believable four armed race possible and they did a great job! Blows away the over hyped Planet of the Apes for CGI effects as well as the storyline and plot. Makes for a great movie with the right ratio of disbelief and emotional attachment.  I only wish the movie industry would do a truely true version of Tarzan (plus additional movies in the Barsoom series). With the current CGI a really good version or Tarzan, set in the appropriate time period is now possible. (If you've read the books you know what I mean) Nothing in the past has come even close to the first two Tarzan books as ERB's wrote them. Too bad the appropriate appreciation of ERB's imagination and talent aren't realized today. Unfortunately the movie industry seems to always think they need to rewrite a books plot and story. They almost never make an improvement.  Sorry I got off on a tangent. Overall John Carter is a great movie. Even if you have never heard of Edgar Rice Burroughs you'll love this movie for the plot, pacing and feelings the movie invokes.

1594203059|5.0|With all due respect, its all about the gold, stupid. What role did one million tons of Indonesian gold played in us economics.  The US bypassed serious economic depression for decades because of the large amounts of good held.  The myth that only 160,000 tons of gold exist in the world is in error.  Obviously high technology or resources could not explain the phenomenal financial prosperity of the west.  The only explanation can be a stable currency combined with a consistent rate of growth allowing the accumulation of wealth.  Was the war in Afghistan really an acquisition of gold? What happened to the roomful of gold in Iraq palace captured by allied forces? What happened to the gold in the Pentagon?  Why has Europe experienced a 10,000 to 30,000 ton transaction in gold leasing for dollars? What role does derivatives play in destroying sovereignty of nations?<br /><br />  The derivative has a paradox.  The paradox is that the paper can be leveraged to a point that it is 40 to 1 against physical assets, such that the currency can be devalue to near zero in an attempt to keep the derivative  mountain, $600 trillion from collapsing.  Why is the derivative legal than? It became legal when gold was removed as an asset for backing the currency. What was the grand design? The derivative was a tool of evil to transfer property or the fruits of labor without producing.  In other words, the derivative was a bet allowing a paper earning without production profits.  Banks use the derivative to acquire bond collateral or sovereign property.  During a crash the bank can acquire physical assets of pennies on the dollar.  The massive transfer of property to the bank is a survive mechanism allowing the bank to survive, shed its speculative bets and acquire property through repossiession.  The bank becomes the super loan collector and wins on the profit margins.  The end result is the lose of sovereignty by the debtor and the debtor can not liquidate because of the lien. Therefore, the excessive credit generated by the derivative has allowed the bank to lien against a vast range of property and depression sets in long term. The civilization can not escape the transfer of property to the banks.  The banks become the villains .  This is the paradox.  The organization that provided the debt for growth become the owners of that growth. Banks then own the property of growth without the sweat of their browe.  Could western institution of power and business created the international trade market without derivatives and used gold. Absolutely.  The dollar was the device.  The dollar was backed by gold and had a stable weights and measurement.<br /><br />All the major components of the international financial system has been weakened by excessive short term debt on the bank books, mis-priced mortgage backed securities, increased money supply, decreased near zero interest rates, a potential buying of depressed real estate before the final correction due to drying credit,  increased reliance on credit default swaps to protect against bad loss. If the fed had done nothing then companies would have liquidated assets, price would have corrected to demand, wages dropped, buying power increased, government spending ceased to safe levels, money supply contracted, and unemployment decreased.  Fed interference with free markets is causing smart money to move to assets, stock speculation to increase, bonds to increase the bubble, and inflation to rage<br /><br />The rule of law must apply for a civilization to operate comfortably and without harassment. If you compare Japan's gold reserve of 745 tons of gold with German's 3400 tons of gold, your left to ask why is Japan late in the gold game?  The logic of selling off gold to stimulate the economy is an error.  Japan should be buying gold, selling dollars, reducing government spending, decreasing taxes, and investing in Africa, China, Canada, Austrialia, Israel, and the middle east projects.  The rule of law must protect currency from devaluation because excess government will always create excessive spending and excessive credit or money supply.<br /><br />Why does Japan the second largest economy have less gold than Germany the third largest economy.  Only 2 percent of Japan reserve is in gold.  Japan should buy 3000 tons of gold and let a stronger yen help develop China and Indonesia.<br /><br />In the 18th century, Europe and China experience political fragmentation that inhibited competition.  Confucianism and Taoism emphasized proper place and discovery of the way rather than reckless innovation and discovery on the edge of chaos common in western thought.  America did not experience the political fragmentation, instead, the new government unified under a constitution balancing the powers against the rise of tyrant.  The benefits of a stable rule of law allow America institutions of business to form contracts and trade internationally taking advantage of foreign labor opportunities.  One nation under God decreed that Justice would be administrated against the wicked, the tyrant, and the communist.  America hidden power was the ability to innovate, create new designs, and rapid introduce design into production.  No other nation could keep pace with the rapid change and adaption that America demonstrated; it would be inevitable that America would become the largest super power because of its institution based on Justice, law, and morality.  The communist institution used martial law, mass murder, and theft as tools of control.  The ideology of the state transfer land ownership from thousands of farmers to the state and caused food shortages resulting from money diverted to military equipment acquisition.  The state institution inflicted injustice reducing incentives to produce beyond quotas and into new product lines.  Large projects sponsored by the state built the wrong products and ignored the free market pricing mechanism.  Today, China Confucian philosophy has empowered the Chinese to seek Christianity, save large amounts of money, renewed their confidence to build new products and designs, and embrace materialism.  Some of the best capitalist in the world are in China.<br /><br />Why didn't Nanjing become the center of trade in the world?  How did Nanjing differ from Hong Kong and Singapore in the application of confucian business thought.  A tribute system is not capable of widespread acceptance.  The Ming Dynasty expanded trade relationship to Europe helping spark a new century of innovation and production.  The Ming Dynasty brought goods from all over the world into Nanjing.  Why didn't Nanjing become the new Singpore?  The tribute system was a tax.  Similar to taxes on road and large public works, the bill for the tribute system was too expensive and participants looked for more competitive opportunities.  The tribute system faded into history and the new international trade system between America and all other nations emerged.  The tribute system had a limited range of influence and a small pool of competitors.<br /><br />Why Yongles encyclopedia fail to compete with Wikepedia, even in a limited domain of knowlege? 11,000 scholars could not match the millions of amateur researcher with specialized interest and refined discovery.  Wikepedia acceleration in acquiring and document information would claim to be better research than highly specialized research by experts.  The mass wisdom would seem to be better.<br /><br />Europe clock technology were superior to Chinese water clocks. The mechanical clock demonstrate sophisticated engineering and skill. French clock makers were welcome in switzerland. Matto Rico brought the Europe clock to China.<br /><br />Confucian administration prized conformity and caution.  Candidates for bureaucracy were required to memorize 431,286 characters and endure a three and half day test.  The big problem with 15th through 18th century China was very little was new.  The tribute system provided goods to a limited clientele and the tax inhibited trade.  China isolation caused poverty.  Ming China worked to the common place and during the Ming dynasty the buying power of silver decreased.  Within a decade the dynasty had eroded . The internal trade was stable but real wages decreased.<br /><br />Today, China does not turn it's back on trade, business, company, competition, or markets.<br /><br />Who was right about the purposes of a sovereign republic, Hobbes or Locke?  Hobbes wanted a strong sovereignty based on divine absolutionism.  Hobbes stated sovereignty must exist to unify the nation into an indivisible group.  Locke, on the other hand, believed the natural state of the sovereignty was harmonious and peaceful. Locke claimed absolutionism was at war with the sovereignty.  People are not be governed by fear, but enter the community out a desire for mutual good.  The People delegate power to the government.  The government has no power of itself.  Where there is no law, there is no freedom. Locke stated powers were delegated, where Hobbes stated, power of government were absolute.<br />The application of the constitution allowed the most impressive institutional building in history establishing a federal structure for a new republic. The constitution was all about the protection of property rights.  Lets contrast US verses English property opportunities.  In England, property was held by a few and in the 14th century 6,000 to 10,000 families held 45 percent of the land.  Many of the US plantation owners held more land and material possessions than the richest and largest land owners in Britain.  In South Carolina, 500 acres of land ownership gave you membership in the assembly or a judge seat.  In 1768, George Washington acquired 45,000 acres in West Virginia and at his funeral he owned over 58,000 acres of land in Ohio, Virginia, and Delaware.  The path to the constitution started with a protest to the British by the 13 States opposing increased regulation of transatlantic trade and Britain's attempt to limit settlement of land west of the Appalachian mountains.  The 13 states viewed the restrictions as over extensions of imperial author.  London was striking deals with the Indians for land after the seven year war.  American's wanted land ownership and not serfdom like England.<br /><br />Ferguson, Europe depends almost exclusively on US military as hard power against Russian Aggression.

B005HS00NW|5.0|I've liked M83 for a while but wow let me tell you, this CD tops all that came before it. The music is haunting and different from anything else you've heard. Midnight City and Reunion are my favorite tracks on the CD and every time I listen to them I get goosebumps. It isn't trance, and it isn't alternative, and it isn't techno, it's a new breed of music that combines synthesized beats and sounds with singing and raw talent. The haunting, ethereal quality of the music is what stays with you long after you've stopped listening.<br /><br />I highly recommend Hurry Up, We're Dreaming. The title of which, I'd like to add, strangely fits the music in the album.
0345803485|1.0|Where to start. If you took out the amount of times Ana \\"flushed\\" which, by the middle of the book, had me envisioning a gigantic white toilet and provided me with endless comic relief in an otherwise literary wasteland, the amount of times she spoke the words \\"oh my\\" , \\"oh crap\\", \\"double crap\\", \\"jeez\\", \\"holy crap\\", and the last  5 sex scenes (because they were boring) you would have a book about a klutzy young virgin who meets a billionaire who gets off on spanking her. This hardly deserves a spot on the NYT bestsellers list. A poorly written plot, underdeveloped characters  and inaccuracies abound. I think I lost about 50 IQ points by the time I got to the end. Borrow this book from a friend if you must, don't spend a dime on it.
B0081KTI0E|5.0|First of all, Daniel Radcliffe is a first class actor. Not for one minute during the movie was I thinking \\"Harry Potter!\\". This was really my kind of thriller, I like to be scared by the story but I don't like to be nauseated by blood and gore. The storyline in The Woman in Black is what scares you, the realness of the characters and the misery of the town Arthur Kipps (Radcliffe) finds himself in. Yes things will jump out at you but not so often that you want to stop watching.<br /><br />The Woman in Black is a supernatural thriller in all the right ways. An unknown energy haunts the town that Arthur Kipps finds himself in at the order of his law firm. He is to investigate the estate of a woman who died who apparently had quite a bit of paperwork in her mansion located a few miles out of town. The people of the town are uneasy and unwelcoming when Kipps arrives, they try to make him leave before his work is complete. It appears to be some sort of conspiracy until more is revealed about the town's residents. They have all lost children to an unknown force which is somehow associated with the mansion left behind by the dead woman. Kipps presence in the town awakens the horror inflicted on the town by the woman in black.<br /><br />I've watched this movie a few times since I first saw it and it still hasn't lost its appeal. The plot pulls you in and holds you until the movie is over.<br /><br />On a side note though, it did remind me vaguely of The Ring. Anyone who's seen it will have to let me know whether they agree.

I went back to buy them again at the store where I originally purchased and they were no longer available there  :(  So I looked on Amazon and found them!  :)  The only ones that are comfortable for me to work out in and they stay in my ears unlike ear buds (which I hate).  They are lightweight so you don't realize you even have them on.  I am back to buy another pair or two to have as a backup because I never want to be without them!

It is a long, boring book with so many characters that are not likeable in the least.  Mr. Follett switches from one character to another so often that the book is constantly confusing as to what is taking place.  He did not stay with any one character long enough for the reader to develop any strong feeling for the individuals.  I think this book is one of his worst ever. It is almost as if he feels that if he writes a really long book filled with many characters the literary audience will think they are getting their money's worth even if the book is poorly written.  It is almost as if Mr. Follett did a quick outline of the book and it was written by someone else.  Buying or even reading this book is a waste of time and money.  I almost quit reading halfway through the book but was determined to read to the end -- wish I had gone with my first inclination and not wasted all the time it took to plod through this mess of a book.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book has no story line.  Worse book I ever read can't imagine why it is getting so much hype.  Certaintly can't imagine reading 2 more of the same.  If you have any intellegence at all do not bother picking this up.
B0052RE4MQ|4.0|Being 23 yrs old im probably not the main target audience for this book, but I have been on a YA Post Apocalyptic book kick lately and this one was didn't disappoint. After reading reviews for Crossed I wasn't sure if I even wanted to read it, but im glad I did! Granted the book might be a little slow (this is no Hunger Games) but it has a beauty on its own that I really enjoyed. There are a few twists and turns that will surprise you and leave you wanting more. Cant wait for Reached!
B0052RE4MQ|3.0|3.25 Stars<br /><br />While not a bad book, Crossed spent too much ink covering ground covered in Matched and didn't do a lot to further the story (IMHO).  The shifting POV was done well but as a poetry tolerator and not a poetry lover it didn't enhance the prose.  Although Ms. Condie did a good job of trying to keep the third party of the love triangle involved, it was hard to miss his absence for the majority of the book.<br /><br />This time around we get to see life through the eyes of the Aberrations, Anomalies and the Outer Provinces - a desert on many levels.  Diehard fans of book one might appreciate crawling through Ky and/or Cassia's feelings for each other.  As Cassia searches for Ky, she realizes that she doesn't know Xander as well as she thought she did.<br /><br />For me this felt very much like the middle book it is. I thought  it was a book that could easily be missed and was therefore disappointing.  I was so disinterested in this book that I don't know yet if I would be interested in following through with book 3 upon its release.

B005C9YZKU|1.0|Nice plastic box..Is this thing really necessary..it could be streamed on line with just about no carbon foot print at all...
0789310627|3.0|the book is charming in a retro way but there is so much misinformation that the publisher had to add a whole page in the very back showing the corrections on the dated info.  I was not paying attention when I ordered it and I'm not sure it said it was printed in 1959 so I really can't blame anyone but myself.  My granddaughters are going to London and I thought this would be a fun book to read.  The seller delivered it very promptly and it is a very nice quality book.

055357342X|5.0|The third book of the Song of Ice and Fire series, A Storm of Swords continues events in Westeros, and holds nothing back. Ned Stark's murder in A Game of Thrones proved that no character is safe, but Swords takes that ideal to the next level, removing no less than six major characters from the story, some in rapid succession, leaving the reader's head spinning.<br /><br />Not only do deaths abound in A Storm of Swords, but major and surprising events take place at every turn. The book's pace is relatively lazy during the first half of the novel, but once the first of those major deaths mentioned earlier occurs, the second-half of the book turns into a rapid page-turner that leaves no stone unturned.<br /><br />The story picks up almost immediately after events of A Clash of Kings. With Winterfell burned, one would think that the Starks' could imagine life no more cruel, but they would be wrong, as readers will learn by the end of Swords. It would be easy to spoil events by revealing who lives or dies, but it would ruin the surprise of the story.<br /><br />The most intriguing portions of Swords have to deal with the politics and betrayal that the reader will mostly likely never see coming. Littlefinger, largely absent, becomes an even more enigmatic player when his role in events is revealed. Clearly, he is a character that has been vastly underestimated.<br /><br />Events in Westeros are far more important to the story this time around, and the plight of Daenerys takes a backseat to what's happening on the other side of the Narrow Sea. Still, there are some truly surprising scenes involving Daenerys and her faithful servants, some of which turn out to be less faithful than she'd been led to believe.<br /><br />With the twists and turns, deaths, and surprising events in A Storm of Swords, it's easily not only the longest of the series, but by far the most superb. Martin has a special skill for storytelling, and for making us care about his characters--and not justthe good ones.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|A pretty good game... addictive. Easy to start but becomes challenging the higher you get. Good for nearly all ages. Try it and you'll like it. I'll definitely be keeping this one.
0553801473|4.0|Fans have been looking forward to this one for a LONG time. A Dance with Dragons completes the story begun six years ago, when A Feast for Crows was published in October, 2005. In Feast, fans were given the full story, but only for half the characters. Fan favorites like Tyrion Lannister, Jon Snow and Daenarys Targaryen were noticeably missing from the chapters of the book. Martin's now-infamous claim that Dance would be finished within a year ended up haunting him relentlessly until the day that A Dance with Dragons fell into everyone's eager hands. A Dance with Dragons not only completes the story of that missing half, but also continues the story forward. In fact, Dance is the largest book in the series, weighing in at 1,040 pages.<br /><br />So how does this fifth entry in the Song of Ice and Fire series match up to the rest? Read on to find out.<br /><br />Note: It's presumed you've read the series up to the ending of A Feast for Crows, so if you haven't, don't read on.<br /><br />The Prologue certainly draws comparisons to that in A Game of Thrones, taking place far north of the Wall, and giving us glimpses of the White Walkers. This serves to continue the inexorable march of the undead towards the rest of Westeros. Martin is most certainly taking his time drawing out the inevitable confrontation with the Others, however, and some readers may wonder if he'll ever be able to complete this saga, much less in the two books he claims remain. Nevertheless, it's a promising start to the novel.<br /><br />TYRION LANNISTER<br /><br />Finally, after ten long years, fans get new Tyrion material. His story begins perfectly in Dance and we see the Imp wallowing in self-pity and taking careless chances, his life no longer important to him. It doesn't take long for that attitude to change, with the help of some unlikely allies, and rather unexpected revelations.<br /><br />Tyrion sees his ups and downs in this novel, and his luck continues to hold, especially near the end.He's matched up with another dwarf, but where this pairing is going is hard to say. Tyrion's line that he has a heart for \\"cripples, bastards and broken things,\\" is never so apt as in this novel. His story does wander a bit, and he's not as endearing as in his previous forays, but he's still very much Tyrion Lannister, and he entertains us nonetheless.<br /><br />DAENARYS TARGARYEN<br /><br />Unfortunately, Daenarys Targaryen's return after a decade-long hiatus does not go as well as the dwarf's. She is certainly a willful young woman, but she borders on annoying and insolent throughout the novel. She seems to disregard every piece of advice her advisers give her, always questioning herself, but then stubbornly refusing to reconsider. Though she's the mother of dragons, we unfortunately see very little of them until the latter parts of the book, which is frustrating, considering how integral they seem they must be to the series.<br /><br />There are some truly exciting portions of the novel in this book, however; One scene in particular seems to be what fans have been waiting for since the moment the dragons were brought to life in the burning embers of Khal Drogo's funeral pyre. It should bring a chill to readers' spines, and was perfectly written-leaving the reader wondering about the fate of the character, of course.<br /><br />JON SNOW<br /><br />Jon arguably has the best plot line in the novel, both fleshing out his character further, as well as one of the most surprising final chapters of the book. Strange how the Starks all seem to have the best stories.<br /><br />There's also an early scene where Jon dispenses justice Eddard-style. It's an unexpectedly welcome scene, not only makes for good reading, but also draws the reader back into the story, which until then founders a little bit.<br /><br />DAVOS SEAWORTH<br /><br />In A Feast for Crows we learn that Davos is dead. Since Dance takes place during the same timeframe, we get to see his actual situation play out. Without spoiling things, let's just say that Davos' parts are rather boring, most of the time, though Martin leaves things sufficiently appropriate for Davos Seaworth.<br /><br />THEON GREYJOY<br /><br />It's been 13 years since we last got into the head of Theon Greyjoy, all the way back in the second book of the series, A Clash of Kings, published in 1998. Martin seemingly killed off the young kraken, but readers have heard bits and pieces about him throughout the series. In A Dance with Dragons, fans finally learn the fate of Theon. Theon's storyline is one of the most interesting of the book, second only to that of Jon Snow.<br /><br />BRAN STARK<br /><br />Bran has a very interesting story in the novel, but one that seems to end much too quickly. His almost feels like a dropped story thread, and fans will wonder what's happening with him later in the book without ever finding out. This is presumably one of the characters who will see more time in the next entry in the saga.<br /><br />QUENTIN MARTELL<br /><br />Quentin Martell is the son of the Prince of Dorne, and fans are given quite a bit of time with this character. Ultimately, his part doesn't feel that important to the story, and one is left wondering why he is even a part of it. The importance of Dorne's storyline is becoming more apparent throughout Dance, but it still feels like it's late to the party.<br /><br />ARYA STARK<br /><br />Still very much in Braavos, Arya was left blind in her last outing. Hers is one of the most involved stories in all of the Ice and Fire saga, and it continues to be no less enveloping in this latest entry. It's still unclear exactly where her thread is leading her, but fans shouldn't be disappointed by her brief appearances in Dance.<br /><br />VICTARION GREYJOY<br /><br />It's not very clear how Victarion will ultimately play into the saga, but his parts are not at all dull.<br /><br />JAMIE LANNISTER<br /><br />When the book finally catches up to the end of A Feast for Crows readers are reunited with Jamie, and his quest to unite the riverlands. He only appears in one chapter in Dance, but it's a fantastic one, with a very suitable cliffhanger ending.<br /><br />CERSEI LANNISTER<br /><br />Fans will be very pleased with Cersei's chapters in A Dance with Dragons. The queen has already been brought low, and will sink even further before things are through. Fans may even begin to feel sympathy for her in this round, though they'd be hard-pressed to ever forgive her. Cersei has been the character that fans love to hate, so Dance is all the more shocking for making her seem more human.<br /><br />BRIENNE OF TARTH<br /><br />Another character that only appears once, and not as a viewpoint character. Fans won't get a lot of information about what's been happening with her, or what her ultimate fate is, but her presence is crucial to the chapter, feels unexpected, and is perfect.<br /><br />THE RED PRIESTESS MELISANDRE<br /><br />Readers are welcomed into the mind of Melisandre for the first time in A Dance with Dragons and given a look at what her plans might be. It's revealed that she's not infallible, and can doubt herself after all. There are some reasonably surprising events revolving around Melisandre in this novel as well.<br /><br />STANNIS BARATHEON<br /><br />Readers have still not seen events from the viewpoint of the truly legitimate King, and after A Dance with Dragons, it's uncertain if it will ever happen. Indeed, Stannis has a lot to do in this book, with very little to show for it. He appears a few times early in the book, then mostly those that surround him allude to him for the remainder. It's fitting that readers should spend more time with his subjects than with the King himself, however.<br /><br />SER BARRISTAN SELMY<br /><br />Selmy is still with Daenarys and serves as the sole member of her Queensguard. Throughout the saga, he's been a bit of a secondary character, but with A Dance with Dragons, he leapfrogs right into major character status. His parts are interesting, treacherous, and fitting for the aged knight. Fans will have much more respect for Ser Barristan before the Dance is through.<br /><br />VARYS THE EUNUCH<br /><br />Appears only once, and very briefly, but is the most shocking and enjoyable chapter in the book.<br /><br />MISSING CHARACTERS<br /><br />Ultimately, there are a few characters that do not appear in the novel, their fate uncertain.<br />- Catelyn Stark<br />- Rickon Stark<br />- Sansa Stark<br />- Samwell Tarly<br />- Peter Baelish (Littlefinger)<br /><br />SUMMARY<br /><br />A Dance with Dragons does indeed feel much like A Feast for Crows did, though is certainly a better novel; it feels dark and gritty. Winter is most certainly coming, as evidenced by Martin's use of the weather throughout the book. Once it snows in King's Landing, it's quite clear how winter is going to affect events in the series.<br /><br />Once Dance catches up to the ending of Feast, things move along a little faster, but this book still doesn't live up to the greatness of A Clash of Kings and the chaos that was A Storm of Swords. There are moments that drag along, and there are characters included that feel unnecessary or confusing. Fortunately, Martin moves the story along nicely in this book, and it truly feels like there's an end-game coming, though it's still unclear what exactly that is.<br /><br />The author has stated that there are at least two more books left in the saga, currently titled The Winds of Winter and A Dream of Spring. Though those titles are intriguing, A Dream of Spring doesn't sound like the title of a book that would wrap up this amazing series. It seems like in a song of Ice and Fire, things should end in a blazing inferno, and fire should be a part of the title. Mayhaps there will be another entry in the series. Time will tell, of course, but with the delay between these books growing longer, let's hope not too much time is necessary.
B0089AF2DS|3.0|I was truly excited about this double album when I heard that it was coming out, but when on the first listen it seemed to lack the thematic elements of the previous records.  I really miss the more \\"harsh\\" vocals of the previous albums, but I have to admit that the Yellow album has grown on me after several listens (don't really want to give up).  I hope that future albums will return to the style of the previous albums....
0553582038|4.0|The fourth book of the Song of Ice and Fire series disappointed many, and left readers holding their breath for so long, some may have perished waiting. Many fan-favorite characters do not even appear in Feast. In Martin's words:<br /><br />\\"I felt that readers would be better served by a book that told all the story for half the characters, rather than half the story for all the characters.\\" - George R.R. Martin<br /><br />This probably seemed like a good idea at the time, but the book suffers for it. Indeed, it is the fourth-best book of the series; that's not to say that A Feast for Crows is not a good book--it most certainly is--just that it's not the best of the series.<br /><br />This book starts out slowly, introducing new viewpoint characters that are interesting, but tedious. In fact, A Feast for Crows relies heavily on new characters and the viewpoints of characters we've only had short introductions to in past books, or have been mentioned in passing only. The Ironmen are heavily represented in Feast, though by the end of the novel, it's unclear why so much time was spent with them.<br /><br />Events start so slowly, in fact, it takes seven chapters to bring readers around to a Stark. It jumps right into the aftermath of events in A Storm of Swords with Cersei being awoken and told of Tywin Lannister's death. Readers are allowed to see events from Cersei's point-of-view for the first time in the saga, and it's immediately obvious how deranged this character is. She has easily become the most reviled character in the saga for readers--even more so than in the previous novels.<br /><br />Throughout Feast, Arya and Sansa both appear, though Sansa has only three chapters, in which she really has no import to events. Littlefinger only appears once--briefly--though his scheming is in full effect, and makes one wonder what he has up his sleeve this time. Clearly, Peter Baelish has an end-game in mind, but it's still unclear just what his agenda is.<br /><br />Much time is spent in Dorne, delving into the politics of that far-away region of Westeros, and though intriguing, it again feels like an unnecessary step away from the main events occurring. Since the Ice and Fire saga is at heart a story of political intrigue, perhaps it shouldn't be frowned upon quite so much.<br /><br />Arya's chapters, though brief, are quite good, and she continues to be a character that both rewards readers, and encourages sympathy for this girl. She has undergone the longest and most arduous journey of any character in the story so far, short of perhaps Daenerys.<br /><br />Near the end of the book, events do take a turn toward the unexpected, but not in an unrewarding way. Indeed, it was hard not to smile at the fate certain characters are forced to face. Without revealing too much, it's safe to say that there are plenty of deaths in the novel, none of them are particularly significant, especially after those that occurred in A Storm of Swords.<br /><br />It's hard to draw a full conclusion about A Feast for Crows, due to it only being half the story; however, this is the book given to readers, so it must be reviewed as it stands. It's a dreadfully dark and bleak book, and the weather turns more toward rain than anything else, helping to dull the bright vivid colors of the imagination while reading. Sadly, the theme of the series is `Winter is Coming', but it's not truly evident in Feast, since the book takes place primarily in the warmer climates of Westeros. We see the Wall only briefly, and then nothing about that portion of the world is discussed again during the novel, due to the split of the characters. Perhaps, rather than split the story geographically-as Martin has done in Feast-he could have separated the characters more evenly, and provided a story that might have interested readers a bit more.<br /><br />As it stands, A Feast for Crows is still a highly-entertaining novel, and will keep the pages turning (especially the second-half), though a mildly disappointing chapter in the Ice and Fire saga. After three magnificent novels to date, Feast fails to meet the same level of mastery as the previous books.<br /><br />It also needs to be mentioned that at the end of Feast, the author predicts that the next half of the story, contained in A Dance with Dragons should be out within a year. That prediction not only turned out to be wildly inaccurate (it took six years for the next novel to arrive), but also created a huge backlash for the author.<br /><br />Once A Dance with Dragons completes the story begun in A Feast for Crows, it may make this book better, but as it stands right now, A Feast for Crows feels incomplete.
B005HERHBY|5.0|One of the best stories in Star Trek The Next. It's a classic for the science fiction, for the action but most of all for revealing the characters and watching them develop. Very watchable for almost any Star Trek fan.
1451648537|4.0|How does one review a book-the biography Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson-when the book itself is more or less a review of Steve Jobs' life?<br /><br />Anybody who reads seems to be reading, or have read, Steve Jobs. Consequently there have already been numerous quotes, reviews, and discussions both about the book, and about Steve Jobs in general. It's difficult not to tread too much on what's already been said, and impart a unique position, but alas, it's worth a shot.<br /><br />Steve Jobs is a marvelously engrossing book, about one of the world's greatest technology visionaries. It details nearly his entire life, including where he came from-both his genetic parents, and his adopted parents. From the very beginning, it's clear that Jobs must have been insufferable to live with growing up, and even more insufferable as an adult.<br /><br />What makes Steve Jobs so intriguing are all the behind-the-scenes moments that intersperse the book. Even to those who are familiar with Steve Jobs' life and career, there was a lot of new information presented in this book-both good and bad. In the end, it's clear that though Steve Jobs built a remarkable company, he did so by being shrewd, manipulative, uncompromising, and most of all: unapologetic. His vision of the way people should use technology was unwavering, much to the chagrin of many in the media, and the outside world itself.<br /><br />It's clear in this book that Steve Jobs was a very difficult person to work for and with, live with, or even to be around in any way. He could be extraordinarily demeaning to people at one moment, and treat them as if they were the greatest person alive the next.<br /><br />What makes this biography so interesting is the way Isaacson details both the good and bad sides of Steve Jobs. He criticizes Jobs' faults, and praises his strengths-sometimes simultaneously. But it's clear that this biography was designed to portray Steve Jobs, and not some mythical figure who could do no wrong. Forthose who weren't aware of the way Jobs handled his day-to-day duties, and the way he interacted with those around him, the book may come as a shocking blow; Steve Jobs was not a great guy. Instead, he focused his efforts and his energy on making great products that he believed in.<br /><br />At times surprisingly callous, and at other times genuinely amiable, Steve Jobs was a man who-perhaps by luck-changed the world. He made no apology for being the way he was; that was simply Steve Jobs.<br /><br />Steve Jobs is a fascinating read, and-though lengthy-is a page-turner. Though completed before Steve Jobs' death on October 5th, 2011, it's clear that the author knew it was likely to be published after Jobs succumbed to his cancer. In many ways, it's a fitting epigraph to a life that was filled with contentious and arduous bouts with corporate executives, celebrities, and even his closest friends and family. Most of the book is spent describing how Jobs became to be the man he was, and also about his ideas and opinions that led to revolutions in so many different industries. It's clear that without Steve Jobs, the world would likely be a very different place.<br /><br />At the same time, it's also clear that Steve Jobs really was the main force driving Apple's innovation. Though Apple has been built to inherit Jobs' design aesthetics, and culture, one has to wonder how long his influence will continue beyond his death. Is there anyone who will take up the mantle of perfection that Jobs insisted upon? Time will tell, of course.<br /><br />Steve Jobs is also a wonderful book in that it isn't overtly technical in nature. Someone who's not necessarily into the tech scene, or computers can still pick up and read the book without difficulty. Though there are certainly sections that will enthuse tech people, it doesn't get too complicated for the average reader. It really is a wonderfully intriguing, and well-written biography.

0439023491|5.0|The second book in the Hunger Games trilogy, Catching Fire, by Suzanne Collins continues the story first begun in The Hunger Games, in which Katniss Everdeen must fight for her life against 23 others in the 74th Hunger Games. Does Catching Fire maintain the same level of intensity and interest that held readers rapt in The Hunger Games? Can Katniss reconcile her feelings with her actions taken in the arena? Will Peeta or Gale capture her heart at last?<br /><br />Collins not only continues the excellent series begun with the first novel, but takes it to a whole new level in Catching Fire. Katniss is still the torn, ever-questioning character first introduced in The Hunger Games, but is now no longer hungry, or wondering where her next meal will come from. Her actions in the arena, however, after defying the Capitol have put not only her, but her family and friends at risk as well. Collins spins a web of intrigue so well-developed, it's impossible to put the book down. More than just a page-turner, this book is addictive to the highest degree.<br /><br />Most of the familiar characters return, and each play their part in a remarkable turn of events that readers will likely not see coming. Peeta and Katniss continue their tumultuous relationship, and Haymitch is still the belligerent, crotchety figure readers met in the first book. Effie at last shows a little humanity, and Cinna continues to amaze and delight with his costumes. Still, the star of the show is Katniss, and the horrible events she's forced to endure in order to protect not just herself, but her family. As always, the dialogue is not only believable, but feels real, to the extent that it's impossible to think of the characters as pieces of fiction, but rather as if they were actual people. The conversations lend such an air of authenticity, it's easy to believe that the government of Panem is spying on us right now, listening to every word we speak.<br /><br />The story in Catching Fire not only continues the events started in The Hunger Games, but returns to many of the places visited before. The Capitol in all its marvelous glory, District 12 and the countryside Katniss and Gale enjoy so much. Readers are also at last introduced to the other Districts, where it's clear things are much more strict that in District 12. A return to the arena is inevitable, and this arena is far different than the one from the first novel. It's immediately clear that things will be different this time, from the tributes' very first glimpse of the arena.<br /><br />As the middle part of a trilogy, Catching Fire does an excellent job of moving the story along, expounding on the events from the first novel, and luring readers in for another chapter. There is much in Catching Fire to be amazed by, from the ingenious design of the arena, to the intrigue and sub-plots occurring-seemingly behind the scenes-all the way up to the final words of the novel. Readers will be left salivating, unable to wait to read the final book in the trilogy.s the events started in The Hunger Games, but returns to many of the places visited before.

0439023513|4.0|The third and final novel in the Hunger Games trilogy, Mockingjay wraps up the story of Katniss Everdeen and her struggles against the Capitol and the corrupt government of Panem. Continuing the events set in motion in Catching Fire, Suzanne Collins weaves yet another tale of intrigue, suspense, and surprise. So does Mockingjay live up to the rest of the series?<br /><br />Collins continues to tell a tale of great imagination, doing so with the same level of expediency as the first two novels. The story is well-paced and keeps readers motivated. Though the action is ramped up rather significantly in parts, there are a lot of jumps forward as Katniss is injured, then wakes to find herself in the hospital. At times, it seems Katniss spends most of her time throughout the book in the hospital. It's a bit unfortunate as it tends to ruin the inertia of the story at times. Just when things start to climax-Katniss wakes up somewhere, and events have transpired that have to be explained by those around her. It doesn't ruin the novel, but puts a damper on what could have been some amazing moments.<br /><br />The dialogue in Mockingjay is nothing if not believable; if anything, it's better than the first two books of the series. Similarly, the characterization continues to be excellent, though concentrated on the key figures. Haymitch, Peeta, and Gale all see decent amounts of time, but this series is about Katniss, and readers will see further into her mind and her emotions than ever before. It's refreshing to see Prim coming-of-age, and actually be the one to comfort Katniss from time to time. It's obvious that Prim is growing up, and becoming her own person.<br /><br />Though the two previous novels centered heavily on the Hunger Games, Mockingjay doesn't include an arena, or an annual Games, except in passing. The war for Panem has started, and Katniss is the reluctant face of the Rebels. The war takes readers all across the Districts, and into parts of the Capitol neverseen before. There are many chilling scenes, in which people are slaughtered for no apparent reason, and Collins ups the ante in the series at the very end. Overall, this book is far more emotional than the previous entries, and is quite a bit darker in tone. It's quite a journey readers are taken on, right up to the climactic battle on the steps of the President's Mansion in the Capitol.<br /><br />Leading up to the finale, fans will wonder who Katniss will end up with? Peeta? Gale? Will she abandon both, even if they survive? Many characters perish, giving their lives to protect the others. Katniss is clearly an emotional wreck by the end of the novel, and it's obvious that she'll never recover completely. The Games have taken too much from her, and the Capitol far more. Still, it's a fitting end to the series, and one that draws readers in just as much as the previous chapters. Mockingjay is highly-addictive, and nearly impossible to put down-even briefly. Though some fans will be turned off by the twists and turns it takes, sticking with it to the end provides a satisfying, if not melancholy sense of closure, and caps off one of the most memorable book series in recent memory.
B007N85ZXY|1.0|Neil young has never been gifted in being a high end musician. His playing ability is quite low on the musical totem pole of life. His voice is even worse. What has always saved him is his ability to write songs. Take away what the songwriting part and what do you have? This CD.<br /><br />Don't believe the hype this one is a stinker of all stinkers. Total crap. An embarrassment to some of the prior songs he's written. Horrible to the point of being unlistenable! This is one that should have been shelved and never been released. Avoid this one at ALL costs. Buyer beware.
0345535421|4.0|The second entry in the Song of Ice and Fire Saga, A Clash of Kings, written by George R.R. Martin begins a bit slowly, but introduces us to new viewpoint characters, such as Stannis Baratheon, the true heir to the Iron Throne. It's quite clear by the end of Kings however, that those with the most gold and swords aligned with them can claim the throne for themselves.<br /><br />The book titles have very closely followed the events of the books. In the first entry, A Game of Thrones, there is much political positioning, backstabbing, and plans being laid. It truly was a game of thrones. In A Clash of Kings, though there is still many politics going on, it truly is a clash of kings. At the beginning of the novel, there are four kings in Westeros, and fighting is occurring in all parts of the land.<br /><br />The most intriguing character in the series so far, Tyrion Lannister, is serving as Hand of the King, in the stead of Joffrey's Grandfather, Tywin Lannister, who is busy fighting a war against Robb Stark. Tyrion quickly impresses with his shrewdness and aptitude for subterfuge. He has never quite shined as he does in Kings.<br /><br />Though the novel is fantastic, it doesn't flow as quickly as did Thrones, and seems to wander a bit. Still, the events in the book can't be discounted. Without giving it away, suffice it to say that things are coming unraveled in Westeros, and the Reader may be surprised by how vulnerable every character is--whether we get to see through their eyes or not. Indeed, it's one of the draws to the series: no character is ever safe. New characters are frequently introduced, secondary characters slowly become more important, and major characters can be killed off and replaced. It's a refreshing change of pace from so many other novels (especially series-based books) that fail to truly put their antagonists in jeopardy, or seriously threaten their main characters. The author makes no such assumptions; everyone is cannon fodder.<br /><br />AClash of Kings takes place primarily in two locations: Winterfell, and King's Landing. Though we are taken all over the realm, to places like Riverrun, and Pyke, we don't spend nearly as much time there. We also get to go beyond the Wall for a huge portion of the book, and see how that story is beginning to unfold. Jon Snow has become yet another major player in the series, and continues to be enthralling to read about.<br /><br />In the end, A Clash of Kings is a great read, and continues to develop one of the greatest Fantasy sagas of all time.
B007V508CC|1.0|Garbage!<br />One of my favorite bands of the last 10 years has sold out. Worst Maroon 5 album so far....
0553386794|5.0|The seat of Winterfell is harsh and cold, with little ornamentation or fanfare. Fortunately, the same can't be said of author George R.R. Martin, who does an amazing job of bringing this fictional world to life. The reader is immediately drawn in, with descriptions of evil tidings taking place beyond the Wall. And what a Wall it is! An ingenious setting, the Wall actually becomes a character in itself, imposing and inhospitable. Martin makes the reader actually feel bad for the men of the Night's Watch, as they have this enormous weight standing over their heads; they surely must feel as if the world stands on their shoulders.<br /><br />Though the novel is long, it never feels tedious or bogged down. The use of so many viewpoint characters helps to keep readers interested, and the plot flowing along nicely. Indeed, with so many characters, it would typically be difficult to keep up with them all, but Martin miraculously prevents this from happening. Where so many authors fail in introducing new characters, Martin shines brilliantly. The story truly revolves around the four main houses: Stark, Lannister, Baratheon, and Targaryen. Hundreds of other houses are introduced, and play their role, but Martin keeps them in their place, as required, and the novel excels because of it.<br /><br />Memorable characters, landscapes, and events fill A Game of Thrones from beginning to end, and though this is a series based in a mythical kingdom, in a world where summers last years, and winters a lifetime, there is little that is unbelievable; it's a book about real people, with real ambitions, and political scheming, as those with power vie for even more. So much of history is made up of stories like this that the events in the book are not only believable, but plausible as well.<br /><br />Upon reading through a second time, I actually found the novel more entertaining that the first read-through (or at least I believe so, the first having been more than a decade ago.)  The story is eminently enjoyable and enthralling, ending with a bang. I can't recommend A Game of Thrones highly enough, and thoroughly look forward to reading through the other books of the series for a second time.y is eminently enjoyable and enthralling, ending with a bang.

B007V2UGPE|1.0|Samurai versus Zombies Defense is a fun, addictive, and enjoyable game that was ruined by its developers.  All your progress, levels, special weapons, coins, etc are TAKEN AWAY when the game updates!  This includes any items that you bought using REAL MONEY.  I was an avid SVZ player and spent money on this game to buy special weapons and to strengthen my characters.  I was at Level 60 until the game was upgraded, then it reset my game to Level 1.  I lost all of my bonus items, enhanced characters, over a million accumulated coins, and other game items.<br /><br />Glu Mobile's customer \\"service\\" (I use that term loosely) said sorry, we can't restore your lost progress,or replace your missing items, or give back the things you bought for cash.  Customer service took six weeks to reply to my first ticket, and about a week for each follow-up ticket.  Instead of acknowledging their update was responsible for deleting my stockpile, I got the brush-off.<br /><br />I learned from several SVZ blogs & forums that players lose everything when the game updates or crashes, and that Glu Mobile does nothing about this problem.  This is a shame because I really enjoyed SVZ.  I spent cash to enhance a free game app and joined their VIP Players Club!  Never again!  SVZ and Glu Mobile have made me a very unhappy customer and I will never play any of their games again.  :(

0062197258|5.0|The book begins with a transcript of the trial of Lee Brightman, accused of assault.  This continues into the 2nd chapter.<br /><br />Initially I was a bit annoyed and confused as the book is telling 2 stories.  One from 2003 and the other from 2007.  In 2003, Catherine Bailey is a woman with lots of friends who enjoys going out on a regular basis, apparently 'meeting' several men and sometimes waking up wondering where she is.<br /><br />In 2007, we meet Cathy, a woman with severe OCD.  This is where the book started annoying me.... the  constant telling of the locking/unlocking over and over again.  She lives in a flat occupied by an older woman downstairs.  The upstairs flat is vacant.  I think the woman downstairs is pretty annoyed with the constant checking of the front door.  This is so bad that Cathy is constantly 2-3 hours late for work every day.<br /><br />The book flips from 2003 to 2007 on every chapter, but as I continued reading the years fit in together.<br /><br />In 2003, Catherine meets a seeming perfect man named Lee.  She's the envy of her girlfriends as he is not only charming but extremely good looking.  The only thing odd about him is he disappears (for work) for days at a time without any calls or explanations.  Occasionally while out with friends, Catherine will see him in alleys with several other men in suits.  He finally confesses he is an undercover cop.<br /><br />Forward to 2007.  One day Cathy (who has also changed not only her name but her appearance) hears noises on the steps and finds there is a new tenant upstairs.  She finally talks to him;  a psychologist named Stuart.  He immediately recognizes her OCD issues and gives her reading material in an effort to help her and deal with her issues.  However, he refuses to treat her as he considers them friends.  Instead he offers to give her places and people she can see for help.  But she must do the work herself.<br /><br />Gradually the story of Catherine and Lee comes out, sheddinglight on the 2007 Cathy.<br /><br />The book is almost 400 pages long and an easy read.  Once I got into it I couldn't put it down.  The plot is fairly simple so I don't want to give too much away.  Sufficed to say that I didn't totally guess the ending.  This is a good thing.  (Thank you Martha Stewart)<br /><br />Thank you.<br />MEF

0439023513|4.0|I had read some reviews and had almost decided not to read this last book in the series. (I  didn't want to be disappointed or frustrated after reading it.) I have to say that I was not disappointed in it.  It had a more logical finish than I had been lead to believe from some of the reviews.  Not all heroes do what you think they should do.  Heroes have human needs and emotions and can have reactions to situations that show that. It was a good read, along with having a sad and happy ending. (Life does not always turn out like you think or hope it will.) Don't miss this last book! If they decide to do a movie(s) from the last two books I hope they stay true to the author's ending. Thanks for a good series!
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I decided to read Les Miserables because I adore the musical. The first thing you must know, if you are reading the book for the same reason, is that the book is NOT the musical. The musical basically tells the story of Jean ValJean and the people closest to him. While he plays a huge role in this book, there are whole chapters in which his name isn't even mentioned. The title tells it all: \\"Les Miserables.\\" The poor, the sick, the oppressed, it is the story of all of those who suffer.<br /><br />I really cannot say enough good things about this book to do it justice. It is literally life-changing. Victor Hugo was truly ahead of his time (probably ahead of modern time as well) when it comes to social justice and moral philosophy.<br /><br />His writing style may be intimidating for some. He is quite verbose, but if you appreciate beauty, you will love it. Each sentence is a carefully constructed painting that has its place in a beautiful mosaic of words.<br /><br />If you read nothing else in your lifetime, read Les Miserables. It is worth every moment.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I am sure my family is happy I have completed the book and they don't have to hear me tell them how much I love it every couple of hours.  I thought the intrigue, conspiracy and plot twists were awesome!  I thought the book began a little slow and then I was captivated.  I wish I would have began a character sheet right away I got some of the names mixed up.  Character development was beautiful.
B0086700CM|3.0|I don't think that its that bad its fun but not all the time where dose it say the bad word
B0071XO8RA|5.0|First, the fact that ebooks provide a way for books such as this to be self published is a gift to readers.  The story structure is so well crafted and the writing vivid that it would be a shame for this book not to be available.<br /><br />I loved this book for its characters and the transportational quality of the writing.  The construct also leaves you with enough leeway that you end up expanding the world in your own imagination.<br /><br />I will say that I did find the last two sections a little too jam packed with interesting characters and events.  I felt like the main relationship was not developed as well due to this.  Again, every character is interesting and has a great story.  I just felt a little overwhelmed towards the end.

B00000JPH6|4.0|If you're considering buying this movie, I assume you've already seen it.  But, I'll write a little on it anyway.  \\"The Dark Crystal\\" is a movie about a Gelfling named Jen who needs to restore the Dark Crystal to end the rule of the evil Skeksis.  I enjoyed the movie quite a bit.  It had a good story, and it had a very magical feel to it.  I also thought the design for the characters were great.  There was a lot of creativity put into this movie.  The movie was a bit dark, but I personally like dark movies.  (Scared me as a little kid, though.)<br /><br />As for the extras, much of it wasn't anything special.  Deleted scenes (that were boring and bad quality), trailers.  The best thing was the video on the making of the movie, which I enjoyed quite a bit.  All the characters in the movie are puppets, and it was interesting seeing how they did everything.<br /><br />(The reviews here seem to be about several versions of the movie.  I'm talking about the regular DVD version.  Not Collector's Edition or any of that.)

B008MEM24S|5.0|If you've played &quot;Where's My Water?&quot; then you'll know what to expect here... sort of. This is more of the same - convert water to steam, ice, and back again to reach a goal - but with fully-voiced characters from Phineas &amp; Fern's Agent P character. The puzzles are tricky, the graphics are big and bright, and the WMW mechanics hold up well. &quot;Angry Birds&quot; has nothing on this.

B007IXWL2C|2.0|I did read the whole trilogy because the only thing I liked about these books was the main character Christian.  I couldn't stop reading the train wreck because I wanted to find out what happens to him.  The writing is very immature and UNREALISTIC.  Please...if sex came anything close to what she portrays we would never come out of the house.  If you like pornogrophy you will like this book. Sadly I saw way too many people at the beach this summer reading this book and some of them were too young to be reading the contents.  They should really have  a warning label for parents on the cover.  I would never recommend this to anyone unless I know that they like trashy, smutty storylines.  I would be way too embarrased.

B005ANZN3Q|5.0|Lang Lang is himself. That is his talent. We should do exactly what his teacher did many years ago. Let him play his music without interrupting him even if he maybe exaggerating. Tweet him your constructive comments afterwards. Why should we draw a cycle to surround him or to create restriction for someone to be himself? He wants to pass his classical music to the next generation, so he does that exactly by using young people's language on this latest DVD. Perhaps a middle age man like me will not like the DVD's visual presentation because of the constant flashing of visual images. Perhaps, I am like other traditional audiences who prefer Lang Lang in Vienna that not one moment the camera was point away from him. But we should not put ourselves over the benefit of next generation. Now a days, I need to email, text, SMS, facebook, twitter & MSN to my kids. We are all purchasing goods from the internet now without caring about how past generations bought goods from retail stores. The world is moving forward as well as the next generation audience. It doesn't matter if it is a rock show or untraditional classical piano music performance.  Freedom should apply to him and his producer. Let them be themselves and let next generation make their own judgements. He is the bridge to connect different generation together via classical music!

B0036T32LQ|3.0|IF you like movies that mess with your head, then this is a movie for you. Personally, I don't, so I didn't find the movie that great. However, it WAS really interesting to see how it all fit together, and to see the loop going round and round. I did wish for a more concrete ending, but that's just me. This is almost one of those movies you have to watch twice, once to get the plot, and the second time to see how it all fits together--kind of like the Sixth Sense in that manner. I suppose it wasn't too bad of a movie, just not my style. Good acting, but a few loose ends that never got properly tied up...
B0017SWPXY|5.0|*I have included an optional \\"SPOILER\\" at the END OF THIS REVIEW for people like me who ask, \\"Is the dog okay?\\" before they start any book or movie involving our canine friends.<br />*************************************************************************<br /><br />\\"The Art of Racing in the Rain\\" isn't about racing. It isn't, really, about a dog. It is the author's way of sharing his philosophy on life.<br /><br />Look, I'm a guy, and I admit to looking askance at a book narrated by a dog. I don't do cute or charming. 'Cute and charming' generally equals cloying and sappy. But in the first few pages, as Enzo (a lab-terrier mix) explains evolution (as he has learned from watching television) and angrily says \\"Give me my thumbs, you <expletive> monkeys!\\", he had me hooked.<br /><br />'The Art of Racing in the Rain' deals with life, death, friendship and loyalty. It is one of those rare books where I found myself laughing and crying within the same chapter. The characters, both human and animal are well written and thoroughly believable. Denny, Enzo's master is particularly good, and ENZO?...Enzo is all of us in his love, anger, devotion and flaws. But Enzo is more perceptive than most of us, and has something to teach us all.<br /><br />The story, briefly, is that of Enzo and his family dealing with illness and, ultimately even the judicial system. There was a brief time when the drama in the middle of the book, I felt, stretched out a bit, but only briefly and Enzo got me through it.<br /><br />On an entirely different level, this book is a must for dog lovers. The whole \\"I wonder what the dog is thinking\\" question is answered. Pet owners will love Enzo.<br /><br />I LOVED this book! Couldn't put it down. The plot moved along and there IS suspense. But it was my new-found love for Enzo and Denny that kept me glued to my Kindle for three solid days.<br /><br />************************************<br />PET LOVERS \\"SPOILER ALERT\\"!!!!!!!<br />Now, if you're like me: asap for animals and avoiding anything where animals are hurt I have an optional SPOILER for you if you keep reading. (The first thing I asked was...\\"will it make me cry..is the dog okay?\\") and I KNOW I'm not the only one. So, if that concerns you, read on:<br />At the beginning of the novel, Enzo is an old dog, and is remembering his life events. It was pretty clear to me, at the jump, that Enzo was going to pass away before the end of the book. But, AND I LOVE ANIMALS...I WOULDN'T LEAD YOU ASTRAY HERE...Enzo is NOT harmed in any way. And his very predictable death is spiritual, comforting and--though you will sob--just PERFECT. Please don't let the fact that Enzo...\\"moves on\\" (LITERALLY) keep you from reading this WONDERFUL book!
B004A8ZWWO|3.0|An adventure-comedy about four former employees of a posh New York City high rise who seek to buglarize the one of its highest profile tenents, a Bernie-Madoff-type financier who lost the entire apartment's staff's retirement while continuing to live high, would almost seem a sure fire hit, especially if it casts Ben Stiller, Eddie Murphy, Alan Alda, and Matthew Broderick. What initially came to mind was a cross between \\"Fun with Dick and Jane\\" with \\"Ocean's Eleven\\" but with an extra sparkle from the comedic talents of Stiller and Murphy.<br /><br />But buglarizing an apartment was relatively tame compared to taking down a major Las Vegas casino; and the humor was formulaic: four white, sheltered, criminal neophytes teaming with a quick-talking, black, seedy professional crook--one can pretty much expect the nature of the jokes.<br /><br />As a whole, it wasn't an entirely bad movie.  It just wasn't all that good.

B004H2ZFPW|3.0|Avril Lavigne has to me always been between the music genres of pop and rock. This album has more ballads on it and less pop, the main pop song on the album is &#34;What The Hell&#34;. It's an okay album, some songs are remakes of her past music. I have been an wavering Avril Lavigne fan. But there are some good songs on this album, which was the reason why I bought it.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I freaking love Tina Fey!  Other than seeing her on Saturday Night Live, I didn't know much about her.  Reading her book took me from her experiences during childhood of being a theater nerd with wonderful gay friends to her adulthood working on Saturday night live during the uncertainty of 9/11.  I've always liked her, but I love Tina Fey even more after reading her book!
B00843TZJM|1.0|This is a complete disappointment.  The singing is terrible. I am a long time fan and I am surprised that they would release such a product.  The harmonies are completely off right from the start with Carry On.  Do not waste your money on this disc.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|The premise of this novel is fairly simple.  Harold Fry, a very ordinary retired British man receives a letter one day from a former female coworker, Queenie Hennessy; he hasn't seen her in twenty years.  She tells him that she has terminal cancer.  When he leaves his house to post a reply, he suddenly changes his mind and decides to keep walking to deliver the letter to Queenie in person.  He leaves on his journey with nothing more than the clothes on his back.  In so doing, he leaves behind his wife, Maureen, and a loveless marriage.<br /><br />As he makes his journey on foot, he meets numerous ordinary people who suddenly become much more than ordinary as they tell him their stories.  Early in his journey, he meets a young girl who inspires him that if he keeps walking, Queenie will live until he gets there.<br /><br />Some books are so special that they can be life-changing.  This is one of them.  It is not just a charming tale about Harold Fry; it is much much more.  I highly recommend it.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|THIS IS THE BEST BOOK I'VE EVER READ! I read it in two days, which is about three months faster than any other book I've read. The minute I finished it I was sad that it was done and I had to wait for the new one, \\"Walking Disaster\\", to come out. I constantly just want to read it again and again and again. I get the feeling this book is going to be like the movie \\"The Notebook\\"; no matter how many times you read/watch it, it never gets old. It is a great love story. Legendary. Soon-to-be CLASSIC.

B0062KMDZ2|5.0|The movie was good, but the effects in 3D were exceptional.  It's nice to see things feel so real and fly out of the screen as if you are right there with them.  Some 3D is good, this was exceptional! Close to the Avatar experience in theater, that is saying allot.  The price was great also, nice addition to my 3D collection.

B001UQ71QY|4.0|Having just bought a Kindle, my priority was to make sure that I could manage my budget and combine this with exploring what I could find in the Kindle Shop.<br /><br />So I downloaded the Bible and Jane Austin for free and then read Pride and Prejudice. Having done this I then treated myself to a purchased book (Danish detective thriller).<br /><br />Its worked well, I had a glitch with the on-line facilities, but this resolved itself within 48 hours. So Kindle works well and I feel in control of my budget.<br /><br />Jane Austin is a blast!  It's a real eye opener about social protocol in the 18th century.

B002WJI63A|4.0|I received this item pretty quickly. I was a bit surprised by the size though. It really is small and not that plump. Still, my 7 yr old daughter loved it and plays with it daily. Let's just hope it doesn't get worn out quickly.
B007L3BMGA|3.0|I have read the whole trilogy and to me it was an ok book - half way through first book I was literally shouting at Anastasia to have a mind of her own and to not lose touch with her friend<br />Also found it all a bit too hard to believe - the wealth and the inner goodness of all concerned<br />Would I read them again - NO!
1469984202|5.0|I just finished reading \\"Wool\\" - Omnibus Edition.  I was scared at first that it would be nothing but doom and gloom.  You really pulled the WOOL over my eyes!  I loved it.

B002ZG99N6|5.0|Great movie and acting--One of my top 10 movies of all time...Ben Affleck and Jeremy Renner..Fabo! And the getaway scenes keep you on the edge your seat! Love the history and how the plot unfolds at the end
B006T3RM08|5.0|Packaging:  This was pretty straight forward.  The item comes in a cardboard box with the actual plastic enclosure wrapped in a thin piece of foam<br /><br />Installation:  You just need to place the lower portion of your Magic Trackpad and Wireless Keyboard respectively under the lip of the enclosure and then push down on the top section to 'snap' it in place to secure the keyboard and the trackpad.<br /><br />Usage:  It is nice to have the Magic Trackpad right next to the keyboard and it is great if you want to hook up your computer to a TV and use the combo from a couch as surely others have done.<br /><br />Notes:<br />The power button for the keyboard is accessed from underneath the enclosure.  The trackpad clicks fine.<br />Complications that others have faced may perhaps be due to slight variations in the the thickness of the Trackpad or the placement of the rubber feet.<br />It certainly would strange for left-handed people to use.
1933633867|3.0|David Graeber's \\"Debt\\" is a good book, and may perhaps even turn into a great one. One reviewer on this website even claimed that the book has the power to transform economics. I am not so sure: Graeber lacks knowledge about contemporary economics, which is problematic.<br /><br /> In the first seven chapters, Graeber explains his theoretical underpinnings. This is somewhat tedious, yet the pace later accelerates as Graeber flies through history, framing events in terms of what some call \\"Graeber cycles\\": civilisations' tendency to alternate between periods of virtual and physical money. A key point is that the Axial Age's (800BC-600AD) reliance on physical money spurred the development of armies and empires. The story, in brief, is this: empires require armies, and it is relatively cost-efficient to pay soldiers in coinage - but for this coinage to be valuable requires it be redeemable, which in turn requires markets. Thus, the state creates markets by implementing taxation of coinage. This pattern repeats itself wherever physical money appears.<br /><br />Credit, by contrast, is built on social relations and trust: an IOU is only as good as those underwriting it. Indeed, one of Debt's most shocking revelations is that economists' traditional view of the development of money, from barter to bullion to credit, is completely mistaken. Early societies, where everyone knew everyone, used credit rather than barter. If my neighbour has a shoe I want, for example, she simply lets me have the shoe, causing me to be indebted to her. In the future, she may come to me requiring a pig, which I would gladly give her. Initial \\"human economies\\" had this characteristic, resulting in deeper human relationships.<br /><br />There are fascinating accounts of such economies in Graeber's story. He discusses anthropologist Phillipe Rospabé's theory that original units of currency - wampum belts, camwood, cattle - are not used in quotidian transactions, but rather to arrange relationships between people. A groom may give his bride's family a gift of brass rods upon marriage, but would never use such rods for normal market transactions. This is because early currency was largely symbolic, an acknowledgment that certain debts can never be repaid.<br /><br />Although others, like Henry Farrell, have disapproved of Debt's final and most political chapter, I thought it was Graeber's best. I was particularly sympathetic to his concrete policy suggestion: to implement \\"some kind of Biblical-style Jubilee,\\" in which all debts would periodically be forgiven. After all, debt is political - indeed, why should Third World debt be repaid, while American debt consists of less stringent conditions and discourse?<br /><br />I cannot give this book a standing ovation, since Graeber fumbles when it comes to his economics understanding. In Chapter Eleven, for instance, he writes:<br /><br />\\"Can we really use the methods of modern economics, which were designed to understand how contemporary economic institutions operate, to describe the political battles that led to the creation of those very institutions?... To take what might seem an 'objective,' macro-economic approach to the origins of the world economy would be to treat the behaviour of early European explorers, merchants, and conquerors as if they were simply rational responses to opportunities... This is what the use of equations so often does... if there is a demand for sugar in England, and enslaving millions is the easiest way to acquire labor to produce it, then it is inevitable that some will enslave them.\\"<br /><br /> In this passage, Graeber makes a number of errors. For one, scholars such as Daron Acemoglu, John Roemer, and Adam Przeworski have described, through game theory, the \\"political battles\\" that led to the development of institutions. Indeed, when Graeber argues that if slavery is the cheapest way to acquire labour for sugar production, then slavery will occur, he is simply describing an optimal response - a Nash equilibrium in some scenarios. Furthermore, I am not sure why he singles out the \\"macro-economic approach,\\" since contemporary macroeconomists seem more concerned with DSGE modelling and VAR estimations than political institutions and imperial history.<br /><br />Graeber should fix the economic mistakes in subsequent editions of his book, but overall this is a good read. I recommend it, with the proviso that the reader be skeptical of Graeber's claims about contemporary economics.

B004RPN100|4.0|John Hersey's slim little volume here is an immensely powerful pathetic argument against the dropping of nuclear weapons in particular and against war in general. He deals with the aftermath of the lifetimes of several survivors of the dropping of the first nuclear weapon on an inhabited place. Many were killed instantly, others were crushed in the debris and rubble, and others weren't as lucky - dying a slow death from burns and radiation.<br /><br />This is an immensely humanizing work that I wish those in power would read or at least be aware of before they made devastating decisions. We in human race have been lucky enough that we haven't had to write a sequel to this book based on a different war and a different place on the same scale. Sadly, we write little ones every day.
0553062182|4.0|The world is clearly not meant for HSPs. Today we are overburdened with signs, advertisements, flashing lights, and more. The result is an easy overstimulation. I'm glad to hear that she says Prozac helps many HSPs. I started that myself, and the difference in my thinking and behavior is very clear. Too bad I had not read this book sooner. Doctors are quick to put a \\"borderline\\" or neurotic diagnosis. They haven't read this book. Not every neurotic is an HSP, but, there is a difference, even though the author does not define that difference. It might be clear to some readers. The author also does not differentiate between other conditions such as Asperger's or autism, and the HSP. There is probably much overlap, with Asperger's/autism being very HSP.<br /><br />I'm not at all buying the author's statements that it's okay to be a HSP today. It's not. This world is meant for people with tough skin, no question about it.<br /><br />I feel the author recommends therapy (talking) too much, as a result of her being a therapist. That might help some, but my experience with such things has been utterly discouraging.<br /><br />The book mainly serves to give you a sense of acceptance and belonging, if you're an HSP. It doesn't take away the alienation, though, so still be prepared to feel different than most people. The author tries to comfort HSPs, but the fact remains, as I've said, that this is a non-HSP-dominated world.
B000267JQK|5.0|It's a toss up between this album and Karma and Effect, but I just absolutely loved Disclaimer II. From the hard \\"Gasoline\\" to the melancholy \\"Love Her\\" every song feels like it's telling a story. I can feel the emotion of the lyrics in the instruments and Shaun's voice. This was the first Seether Album I owned and years later, it's still not old.

B0001ARCFA|5.0|i'm a tough critic.  I always read the bad reviews, but with caution but I want to know the real deal.  So I decided to retire my 1992 240 AKG's.  Twenty years of dailly use.  The cable is shot.<br />Down to the wires, just a matter of time before I step on the cable in the dark and they are gone.  Time to update.  Decided on these cuz I Love AKG, best studio heads I know.<br />can listen all day without fatigue.  These have a mini plug, my video cameras need them. I hate most adaptors.  Mini has become more standard.  Zoom uses it.  So I got my order yesturday and tired them. A/Bed them to the older headphones.  Much more dynamic range.  I was surprized.  Spent about twenty minutes comparing, then packed away the 92 versions.<br />These are good low level Pro headphones.  I'm happy.  I'm seldom happy with products cuz most so called pro stuff is really consumer plus or kids in garages.  See my review on JBL small computer speaker for some advice.<br />I'll live with these and when I get some cash, buy some high end AKGs.  I like what i hear.  May not be top of line but my audio and music sound good.

B000002KAT|5.0|You may find title of my review odd, well at 23 most people still don't know what they want or where they want to be, but Van Morrison did.<br />When I first heard this, I couldn't associate it with the Van Morrison from the hard rocking group out of Belfast called Them and the same Van Morrison of Brown Eyed Girl fame (not that I dislike those eras either, because I quite the songs too).<br />I likened this album to a 25 year old bottle of Scotch whisky, one sip and you think oh yeah that's good.<br />The craftsmen joining Van are top shelf too (mostly all from a jazz background), no pretentious ego's here to interfere with the sound.<br />The songs themselves are slices of life and what good observations they are too.<br />Although the press of the day gave good reviews and praised the album, it was a commercial failure and has taken years to receive a gold record.<br />But at least over the years people have come to realise that it is one of the rare things you come by, a prefect album.<br />I would rate the album in the top 10 ever released and if I could give a 10 star rating would do so.<br />It's a total bargain to buy, only 10 dollars new!!!!.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|I just started reading this book and am very frustrated that Martin didn't stay true to following each person's story as it was unfolding.<br /><br />This book has story lines for which the future is already known, hence it lacks suspense.

B007SGM084|3.0|It's a bit sad that this series with so little plot content should be such a best seller.  The sex scenes are very arousing -- at first -- then they become tedious.  I found myself searching for the end of the ongoing sex scenes while seeking some continuation of a plot that never developed.<br /><br />Men should be reading 50 Shades since it's largely a how-to manual for pleasing/arousing female sexual partners in order to have a highly mutually enjoyable sexual experience but it's sad that it seems women are the primary audience.  Reading about this perfect fantasy man that is Christian Grey will likely just magnify their realization about the sexual inadequacy that is most men when it comes to making sure their partners are sexually fulfilled.<br /><br />The characters are poorly developed and their lifestyles are pure fantasy given that they're barely adults who are supposed to have had extensive success and wisdom that takes valueable life experiences -- successes and failures -- to have achieved.  There was an occasional tease in the story that gave me to believe the plot was going to develop and thicken but it just didn't happen.<br /><br />Christian Grey is every woman's perfect fantasy man.  He's young and handsome and rich and very sexually proficient and the fantasy that is him is generally appealing.  But the more important story line about how physical and sexual abuse of a child impacts and damages them is the real story that is barely acknowledged.

B0032BMTCQ|5.0|I love these bibs. I look at a few things:<br />The pad, the fit, the seams<br />I prefer a pad with extra density. Not thickness, but density. Or hardness with contour.  These are perfect.<br />I like a tight fit around my ass and thighs, and I don't like to constantly adjust my \\"junk\\". But it don't want it too tight around their either.<br />The straps are secure and don't move around at all, but also don't dig in.<br />These bibs are substantial, and very supportive, and cut perfectly.<br />On the hottest, 95-100 degree days, they get slightly warm. But wearing my lighter castellis, or Pearls on those days makes me appreciate these Gore bibs even more.<br />Gores pad is ultimately what \\"does it\\" for me.

1439170916|5.0|I'll keep this review short. I've read eight books in the past month, four of which have been medical-related. I'm a college sophomore and I'm pre-med. Out of all of the medical books, this was, without a doubt, the best in every way. It not only was intriguing all the way throughout its 500+ pages (moreso than other medical books and even a lot of story-driven novels), but made me sincerely interested in oncology and made me view cancer in an entirely different light. You won't regret reading this book.
0375842209|5.0|It's been a long time since I read a book that captivated me so much. I don't appreciate reviews that recap the story, because that's the point of reading the book in the first place.  What's key to note is that The Book Thief is beautifully written and cleverly crafted and if you don't read it, you're missing out on something very special.
1416575464|3.0|I did enjoy  \\"Domino. The book of decorating\\" [[ASIN:1416575464 Domino: The Book of Decorating: A Room-by-Room Guide to Creating a Home That Makes You Happy]]; it has amazing photos of beautiful rooms starting on the entryway up to the office and kid's rooms, but frankly, all these images can be found at free-web sources like the blogs Apartment Therapy or Design Sponge and such... The best part though, is the mini floor plan of each room that is presented, the visual \\"dictionary\\" for furniture styles and one of the final sections of the book that's called \\"the decorator's handbook\\", wich has diagrams for curtains, windows shades and different kinds of upholstery treatments for sofas and beds.<br />Wraping up: is a good book, but not an amazing one, in my opinion.
B004SH40BQ|5.0|This product works great with both iPods I have have a pair of blue tooth headphone they work perfect together ....good product to have....
0345803485|5.0|I did not expect to enjoy this book since I'm not a great fan of romance novels, but I am completely smitten.  Yes, there are things I don't like.  The inner goddess and the subconscious devices are really annoying.  The constant, dopey and dowdy OH MY exclamations (who says that??).  It wanders all over the place.  Despite all that, the characters are wonderful and the story itself is one I will remember a long, long time.  I just love it.
B004TSXUWY|5.0|A very unusual, suspenseful read. A psycho crime novel with a difference.I was alternatively intrigued and a bit scared.

It is not needed to offer you your opinon on the book, stop spoiling it for others now for my reveiw. I trhink that this was a rip off of the FSOG series and everyone is trying to jump on the bandwagon. It is just about the same exact story line. I have no respect for authors like this. Use you own ideas for your own books. you are supposed to be creative, we cou;d all write books if we had the entire story already written for us. Just a form of plagerism here..
B0050DIWFC|4.0|As a parent, I can fully understand a parent's inability to see their child's guilt. How can a parent think of his child as a \\"Bad Seed\\"? This story shows how easy it is  for parents to live in denial.  Even when their natural instinct warns of the possibility of guilt, a parent more often than not, will blind himself to the realization of any wrong doing by his offspring. This natural reaction was one skillfully revealed by author, William Landay in DEFENDING JACOB.

B003F5NSTW|5.0|This book was very interesting to me because I have often wondered about the nature/nurture debate. The characters are well developed and their interactions are fascinating. The relationship between a mother and her son is fully explored. We are left wondering if Kevin is really evil, or maybe it is just his mother's perception of him. Definitely one of the best books I have read this year.

0743289692|3.0|I tried so hard to love this book enough to finish it. It's not that the story isn't gripping or compelling in its own right, it's just..maybe it was the storytelling style. The author relates all kinds of horrifying stories from her childhood, like undergoing genital mutilation as a young girl, but recounts them factually, without much hint as to her actual opinion on the matter. I had difficulty hearing her voice in her story.<br /><br />For more reviews, please visit my blog, CozyLittleBookJournal.

Sure, the actors carry off bringing the unbelievable to life but, again, so what?  I would have walked out on this piece of dreck after the first ten minutes but I paid for it so I hung in there as best I could.  In all honesty, I would rather have an appendicitis attack, again, than sit through this abomination, again.

Through it all he is a musician first. A fascinating read; thoroughly entertaining.\\"
0345803485|1.0|I cannot believe I bought into the hype. What a badly written, overdrawn, repetitive novel full of annoying and inconsistent characters and an incredibly unrealistic set-up. This could, and should have, been 300 pages shorter. There is literally NO plot and the 'erotica' is tame, boring and incredibly repetitive. Completely overhyped garbage. If you're looking for good erotica, try Ann Rice's \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" series.

B0053O89RY|5.0|I have been a HUGE Modern Family fan since its beginning in 2009. It never fails to deliver gut-aching laughs on a weekly basis. All of the characters are relatable and are extremely well acted by a SUPERB cast. I have introduced dozens of people to this show and it is now many of my friends favorite. When introducing the show, I usually start off by saying a standout on the show is Ty Burrell as Phil Dunphey but then I also add that Eric Stonestreet is amazing as Cam. Then I must add that, oh, Julie Bowen plays a perfect crazy mom, Claire Dunphy and Sofia Vergara plays an amazingly extravagant and always hilarious Gloria. My friends usually end up saying \\"So basically what you're saying is that the whole cast is amazing?\\" And my answer is always yes. And that's what makes this show so perfect. I totally believe every single actor is the character they are portraying.<br /><br />The other thing that makes this show the best show on television is the writing. The writing is what wins this show its Outstanding Comedy Emmy every year. The writing is smart, witty, outrageous and perfect. It enters about 10 episodes a year to the Emmy's for consideration in the Writing for a Comedy Series category and won its first two years. This year, the third year, it was snubbed in the category, most likely because there were split votes between separate MF episodes.<br /><br />I can't explain how much this show means to me. Whenever I need to have my spirits lifted, I simply put in my Disc Two of Season Two and watch \\"Caught in the Act\\", my favorite episode and the episode that won Steve Levitan his second Emmy for Writing of a Comedy Series.<br /><br />I believe EVERYONE should watch and enjoy this show as much as I do. Season 3 is exceptional and sure to take home the big Emmy once again. I can't wait for September because with it comes my birthday, the season 4 premiere of MF and the release of the Season 3 DVD! All always highlights in my September!
B003O86FMW|4.0|Hunger Games caught my attention and held it all the way through.  Catching Fire had my attention going in, but lost it quickly.  I finished reading it because I wanted to know the fate of the characters, but if Hunger Games had not been its lead in, I don't think I would have cared.<br /><br />I gave this book a four because it continued the stories of characters I liked.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Wasted my money on this book. Sick individual who would dehumanize an innocent  naive  young lady like this.<br />Ordered the book thinking it was about 2 lovely college girls embarking on  their journey of life.<br /> will not read the 2 following books in  the trilogy.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|it is an awesome game I play it every day. I think if you like taking care of animals then you'll love it
B004UID2LC|3.0|Its a good app, but if I close the app while I'm downloading an item I get duplicates. when I delete the duplicate the original video will not play.
B00283PUQQ|5.0|Wow.  Someone's actually managed to make an original vampire movie.  I'm not a big fan of vampire stories, I've just seen it too many times.  But this as good as it gets.  Beautifully shot (and great looking on blu-ray), moody, mysterious, emotional.  This is as much a pre-adolescent love story, as anything.<br /><br />An outsider boy, fragile, picked on, and harboring violent fantasies of revenge is befriended by a strange, pale young girl who doesn't<br />seem to feel the Swedish cold.<br /><br />It's a strange and fascinating mix of tones; bloody, gory killings, very sweet, well acted pre-teen romance, and occasional black comedy.  There's also an interesting, complex morality here.  Both our young heroes have deeply violent, sadistic streaks within them.  Yet we root for them, even though some off her victims are truly innocent, and he collects stories about murder like a nascent serial killer.  It grew even deeper emotionally on 2nd viewing.
B008MEM24S|5.0|It works great on my android tablet. It so much fun everyone plays it. My husband play at night before bed.If you liked Where's my water you will like this as well.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|The game would go to the screen that says loading and then go to my desktop.  You would be waiting for nothing.
B00846TTDG|5.0|If you want to see Hollywood acting go see Indiana Jones. This is a small birds eye view of what it takes to keep us safe and free. We owe these men our Homage, Respect, Love and Humility for the price they sometimes have to pay for things we take for granted every day.  I thank God for them and for their families who pay the price for us right along  with them. I can't help feeling we don't really deserve them. I ask for a grateful heart for real heros. They carry the weight of the world on their soldiers.<br />I get really ticked of when I read comments by cruddy cowards who would pee their pants if anything went down in their own back yards. They wouldn't even fight to save their own you know what. \\"Punks with pens\\" that's what I call some so called \\"movie critics\\".<br />Thank you from a grateful nation, there are some left who appreciate the precious gift of life or limb given for us.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|For a first book, this is an incredible piece of fiction. The writing is of the highest quality, with a fascinating plot set over years.  An unbelievable debut. I thought the Slab City series was excellent, but this is a higher gear.  Good work, can't wait for some more.
0307951529|3.0|I liked the book, I really did, but it failed to deliver something I really needed... more details.<br /><br />When choosing this book I was looking for inspiration and ideas. It partially delivered that. I loved all the examples of success stories of all the different folks who created and found their success. But what I didn't get were more details on how they got there, just a lot of fluff.<br /><br />I'm a meat and potatoes kinda of guy, but I expect more meat on my plate than potatoes. This is where this the author failed to deliver.<br /><br />I don't want a complete roadmap to their success, but what I needed was a more indepth read to how they got there.<br /><br />The title for this book is a great sell point, but it is just hollow core information. Just a bunch of examples, all covered in the inspirational good stuff, nothing more.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this takes up hours of my time and makes me think. gotta love it. the fact that its free makes it even better. =]
B0015AARJI|1.0|When I purchased this, it gave no indication that I was purchasing from a 3rd party seller, so I'm not really sure what happened there. But the tracking, and ultimately the receipt clued me into the fact that this wasn't coming from Amazon. It was a total fraud. Slightly raised LED indicators, led lights that \\"bled\\" (can be seen shining through) the seams around the control. The lights weren't nearly as bright as the legit controller. It was lighter, would not stay synched to my PS3 for more than a few minutes, the silk screened \\"Sony\\" on the face wasn't crisp, and lacked that certain subtle metallic or glittery quality. The PS home button was incredibly loose, and the sticker on the back wasn't the appropriate color (it should be blue print on a black background, not white on a black background), and literally looked zerox'd and off center.<br /><br />Save yourself the drama, if you find this controller for less than the retail price, it's probably too good to be true. I learned my lesson. I'll be spending 60 dollars at Gamestop or Toys R Us next time.
B006JSXYPA|5.0|I bought this right away when i saw the price drop to 19.99.  This is one of my favorite movies and the fact that its in 3D makes this purchase even better!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|What can you say about these books... Next we are \\"Freed\\" Dont know if we want to be though. Ha ha ha ha ha. we have a good story line going on in this book so anxious to see what corner we are turning around next, with \\"fifty\\" lol lol .... Nothing but enjoyment... read on!!!!!
B00008BXJ6|5.0|This album or disk has the voice of the late Bon Scott. It is a must have, for any AC/DC fan.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I started working out about 3 months ago, weights only, when a friend recommended this DVD.  I started using this DVD about the middle of May, and now near the end of July I am at day 26 (Boys beer weekend in June, so went back to Level One to get reacclimated to Level Three again, took about 10 days, didn't start counting again until back to Level Three).  Let me just say that before I started this DVD, my 8 year old daughter would laugh and sing \\"Daddy has a fat belly! Daddy has a fat belly!\\".  Last week I asked her how Daddy's belly was now, she said \\"Daddy has a FLAT belly!\\".<br /><br />Results: obviously a flatter belly, lol; I have lost about 20 lbs since starting, I am nearing my goal weight of 175 lbs, was hugging 200 before I started; my waist size has dropped from a 36\\" to a 32\\" (and what a happy surprise that was when I went shopping for shorts!); I have gone from extra large shirts to mediums; And lastly, I really do look younger.<br /><br />This is hard work. After the first day, I could barely walk the next morning as my thighs felt like they were made of iron, and not in a good way, totally rigid and sore. This went away after the fourth day, and even after my extended beer break didn't return when I restarted. Get through the rough start, it does get better and easier with every day you do it.<br /><br />Don't worry about trying to keep up with Jillian and her assistants, do the best you can to just finish the time doing the exercises you're supposed to be doing.  Sometimes I would start with the advanced move, and then revert to the beginner modification by the end, but so what, I kept moving, and by the third time of doing those exercises I was able to finish the entire time with the advanced moves, and frankly, I'll never be as quick as the trainers, so just keep moving.<br /><br />Only con: like others, I hate that the DVD doesn't let you get to the workout right away. For all producers, studios, whoever or whatever, I PAID you to provide me witha service or entertainment, not for you to bombard me with commercials.  You want to do that, fine, make the video free.  Don't make me wait, it just makes me angry I bought your product, and will avoid doing so in the future.  The only way I've seen to avoid this is to just leave it in the dvd player and leave it on, then it's there for you the next day, assuming no one else has used it.
B00177YA1K|5.0|These are very good movies and our daughter hadn't seen them so i sent them to her.<br />She loves them now.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I have gotten all of my friends to read this book and we all just rave about it! I finished the whole series in a week. Needless to say the best week of my life!
B003Y8YXFS|5.0|Its a good album or disc, the record has several songs that make you think. Imaging what could have been.
B008MEM24S|5.0|its better than expected and I'm a teenage girl. it has cool levels &amp; incorporates the actual Disney show. me &amp; my little sister both enjoyed it a lot(:
B008602KQI|5.0|For Grand daughter, She loves the movie, I still think its not one I agree with. It was rated so high she is getting it.
0385737955|4.0|I really liked this book.  It is action packed and full of questions.  Some that are answered in the book and some that are not.  While I was reading it sort of reminded me of The Lord of the Flies.  The way they had to work together and of course you have some who play by their own rules.    Thomas wakes up in a lift.  He can remember nothing except his first name.  When he arrives at the  Glade he finds it filled with young boys, like himself.  They remember nothing about their past lives, nothing before the Glade.  Something feels familiar to Thomas even though he is sure that he has never been to this place before.  Even the Maze that closes tight every night does not scare him like it should.    Then something different happens.  A girl arrives the next day with a message.  A message that they don't fully understand, or do they?    As I said before, I liked the book, I didn't love it.  If you liked Lord of the Flies or even The Hunger Games, you will probably like it.  I was so excited in the beginning and the middle but toward the end it started loosing its flavor, in my opinion.  I will read the other two to see what happens.. I hope you enjoyed this review..

B0086700CM|5.0|this game is so dumb but its addictive I love it I say get this game hell it'd free so why not
B008JMKN4Y|2.0|I just finished reading this book, and I was very disappointed in this book.  I read both good and bad reviews, and I thought that the story line was interesting.  The author did a very poor job of developing the female lead in this story; she did a reasonable job of the male lead.  I did not believe that the female loved or grew to love the male lead. The emotions, reasoning and actions of the female lead seemed contrived and not very believable.<br /><br />It was an interesting story, and I enjoyed parts of it; however, in my opinion, the author blew it.  This is not a $7.99 book. It should cost around  $1.99,  and I would it give 2 stars.  If anyone is interested in buying this book; I would wait for the cost to go down before purchasing this book.  I certainly would not buy the sequel for anything near what I paid for this book.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Love this simple app. Prefer it for balancing my checkbook. The back button saves having to re-enter an entire calculation and the display of the prior calculation helps if I am interrupted. The large keys and display make for easy entry and reading.
B007SGM084|5.0|I love these books!  E.L. James makes the romance in the story seem real and not so fantasy like.  It's a true love story and I can't wait until she comes out with more!
B008MEM24S|4.0|just like wheres my water which i have spent hours playing.  my son even enjoys this game! I highly recommend this game to whoever enjoys angry burrs or where's my water :)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Reading a book as popular as the reviews I had high hopes for the book. The beginning seemed slow but once the games were brought into view it picked up. Although set for young readers I'd recommend the book to anyone, and if you haven't seen the movie read the book first.
B006RUJST6|5.0|Well written, Just loved the story!<br />Could not put it down. Great characters,fluid and heart warming. Highly recommend for all ages.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|If you want to improve you hand-eye coordination,  this is the app for you. I love it. It makes brain work fun. 5 stars from me.
B008MEM24S|5.0|I love watching this show with my son. The game is awesome too.  The puzzle are challenging enough for an adult but still very much true to the Disney story.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Mostly porn, but a quick moving story line as well. Enjoyed it, didn't love it. Wouldn't want any of my friends to meet Mr. Gray.
B0034G4P80|3.0|I suppose any review of *Thor* ought to begin with the reviewer's expectations--if you're expecting a solid comic book/mythology movie with a strong sense of the comics ethos, a solid leading man who thoroughly inhabits all aspects of his character (from bathos to boorishness), a rather one-dimensional villain, and lots of rock `em-sock `em action encased in a simple, mediocre plot--then you will probably be satisfied with *Thor.* If you're expecting anything else, you can pass on this one. The best parts of the movie are Chris Hemsworth as Thor and Tom Hiddleston as Loki, Thor's adopted brother and the villain of this film (he's also the villain in *The Avengers,* a film that displays Hiddleston's acting talents to much greater effect). Ironically, the worst parts of the film are the two Oscar winners who inexplicably find themselves in a comic book movie trying to ACT all over the place. I'm talking about Anthony Hopkins as Odin, Thor's father and the chief god, and Natalie Portman, who is allegedly a scientist/researcher but who turns into a mushy, goofy middle school girl whenever Thor flashes her a smile. Despite these two casting mistakes, the film is an enjoyable diversion, and it works well--as long as you're not expecting it to be something other than what it claims to be.
B0000648WZ|5.0|Paul Verhoven and Edward Nuemire's adaptation of one of Robert A. Heinlein  most well known books is totally unfaithful, spits in the face of hardcore science fiction fans, and confuses the themes that Heinlein painfully interwoven into his piece that has been the foundation of Military Science Fiction.<br /><br />And it's so fun.<br /><br />Pilipino Juan Rico is replace by Aryan poster child Johnnie Rico (Casper Van Dean) a handsome chisel body boy who enlists in the Federal services because his well endowed girlfriend becomes a pilot, however she chooses a career in piloting over Johnnie.<br /><br />With nothing to fight for and accidentally killing a fellow squad mate, Rico decides to quit, however an enemy weapon slips past Earth defenses and obliterates his stomping grounds.  Now with no home to go home to and nothing else to lose he resends his resignation and goes to war.<br /><br />It's fun because it makes fun of the patriotic World War II movies between 1945 and 1970, using the same optimism of kicking it to the enemy and dialog used in the church yard, yet having Verhoven's trade mark graphic violence and gore. Massive gouts of red and cart wheeling limps, with an icing of total gratuitous nudity that clashes so wrongly. You don't know whether to be horrified or amused. The handsome and sexy youths of the Terran Federation are the cannon fodder for its war against interstellar insectoid race is only one of the dozens of elements that Nuemire and Verhoven satirize about a war and nationalism in general. This 1997 film came out one year before Steven Spielberg released \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" that showed what a true nightmare it was to fight in World War Two compare to what was shown in the classic war films of the 50s 60s and 70s. Verhoven took that jingoistic spirit, put it in a science fiction setting, and added the stylized over the top gore seen in early John Woo films. This is not a film to be taken seriously, unless you know something about satire.<br /><br />The two disc special additional is worth every penny. The main feature has a multiple commentary tracks with much of the staring cast as well as the director and screenwriter, revealing funny little tidbits about the production like how Verhoven made everyone read the book that he ignored, while not reading it himself, and a secret that actress Dina Meyer's discovered to clean up stage blood.  Couple with a second disc that has a satisfying documentary with screen tests, special effects test, and conceptual art, you have a good edition to your movie collection/><br />The two disc special additional is worth every penny.

B00785P2QC|5.0|A fun game in the vein of Sim city. Pay real money for a boost but don't have to. Worth having. Great project/Sim game
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is awesome! Both my boyfriend and I couldnt stop playing... if I set the kindle down for a second than it was in his hands playing this game Lol.
B003L77G8I|5.0|This particular purchase was to complete the set, until the next season comes available. I like \\"Bones\\" as the characters are believable and the topics are interesting. I can usually learn something new with each episode, which is something that makes watching it all the more enjoyable on my part. The producers / writers are not afraid to touch on delicate subject matter but allow the viewers to develope their own opinions and feelings on these issues. The two main characters often have different opinions that allow for exploring the matter at hand and often stand their ground on the issue but without judgement on the other's opinion. And remain friends despite having different opionions.
B005IA9K2G|5.0|The great Judy Garland was one of the greatest movie stars ever.  Meet Me In St. Louis ranks close to the Wizard Of Oz as her best.  It contains some of the best songs she ever sang.  Buy it and you will treasure it.

1613823649|4.0|An all-time classic for a reason, Orthodoxy has the wit and thoughtfulness that only Chesterton can provide. Be aware that for the modern reader sometimes Chesterton can be a bit tough to wade through at times, but it is well worth the effort.
B008BRC6NS|3.0|I don't know what it is about this collection that just doesn't sit well with me.  I feel like it's missing some crucial songs from the J. Lo-era (Play, I'm Gonna Be Alright remix with 50 Cent and/or Nas) and This is Me...Then-era (I'm Glad, Baby I Love U!), as well as the Rebirth and Brave eras even though those were her least successful albums.  Also don't understand why the version of \\"Get Right\\" contains Fabolous over the regular beat, rather than the remix video version which was a different, more slowed-down gritty/R&B beat.  I mainly purchased this for \\"Get Right\\" on DVD since I only have it on the dual-disc version of \\"Rebirth\\" (which includes the remix video with Fabolous that has a different beat and slightly different video).  I also don't understand why the \\"All I Have\\" video isn't on the DVD as well as a couple of others, not to mention the \\"Jenny From the Block\\" video is the original version rather than the remix video with the Lox (this regular version wasn't even on the actual album release).  I love her stuff so she can't really go wrong with me, but I guess I wanted a bit more.  I suggest just downloading all the singles she's ever released, and video-wise purchasing \\"The Reel Me\\" if it's still in print, which was a very good compilation of her videos before \\"Rebirth.\\"
B007VTVGAQ|5.0|Amazing work by Ms. Apple. The lyrics, the music, the soul; I am addicted to the whole combination of elements in this album. I cannot get enough of it!
B0053KWDES|4.0|I take the bus back and forth to work, and found my ipod could not give me the full sound I needed, especially if I used over the ear headphones. The Fiio e11 is great for giving me that extra boost. The sound is clean, and I have yet to be disappointed. The nokia battery it uses is inexpensive and lasts around 8-10 hours between charges. I would recommend the Fiio e11 to anyone who needs more power for their headphones. Well worth the price.
B006MVJ2L4|4.0|This sophmore CD is a mix of very high energy Michael Jackson/rock/Euro pop, except for the last couple of tracks. It has a strong bass back beat that is not something to which I generally gravitate. The few ballads are hauntingly beautiful and they perfectly exact the breadth of his vocal range. I think he is still trying to find his niche as demonstrated by this departure from his first CD; I am really looking forward to his next CD. All this being said, I just saw him live on 7-27-12 for the first time (have always been a fan) at Winstar Casino in Oklahoma. He was having such a good time on stage, mostly doing work from his second CD, that it made this new CD come alive for me. Now I listen to it with new ears. I suggest you buy it if only to see his talent progression. And make sure you get the Deluxe version!

B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Downloaded free version to try to determine how much of a challenge Angry Birds is. Didn't expect to find such a wide, difficult and time-consuming (but fun) game. To anyone who is contemplating the game, don't wait, do it. Try it, you'll like it!!
B000RLFJQ2|5.0|I watched this via Prime Instant Video after reading an online article about how great the car chase scenes are. Not only are they among the best I've seen, but the acting, production, and plot twists are first rate as well.
B005JE7WKI|4.0|A really pleasant surprise - at first it seemed it would be just a silly one-off extended skit on reversing the old hillbilly slasher flicks. But it was so well-intentioned and it simply just kept rolling out such hilarious comic scenes that one couldn't help giggling, then snorting, and then outright crying with laughter. As usual Alan Tudyk was great, he is a fine actor, and his comic timing and facial expression are priceless. But the rest of the cast is (for the most part) almost equally as good. A few weak links keep this from being a classic farce - a few of the characters seem penciled into the script and, as a result, come off more than a bit wooden. But overall, Tucker & Dale vs. Evil is worth watching  because it works so hard and so competently to be funny, and most of the time, it succeeds. Films nowadays that generate real comedy don't come around all that often. Three-and-a-half stars that deserves the rounding up because any film that can make me laugh on a Sunday night is golden.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I've read so many bad reviews and I absolutely do not agree. I've read all 3 books and quite frankly after I finished which was about an hour ago I feel a bit empty and depressed.. I'm longing for more and I cannot wait till they make the movie. I fell in love with the characters and the entire trilogy. This is a great book!! I hope that the author decides to write more.

1451608659|5.0|I have to give this book a 5 star rating. I have loved Dominique Moceanu since before the 1996 Olympics and I love her even more now. I had an opportunity to meet her in 2005 while she was in VA Beach for a competition and was able to get a picture with her and she was as nice as I would have hoped. I still have that autographed picture framed on my desk. I knew I wanted to read her book but as Olympic gymnastics was starting this weekend I had to go out and buy it now. A lot of times you will read memoirs and find that they have left out the parts you really wanted to know. That is not the case here. Dominique has completely opened up about every area of her life and you find out everything you have ever wondered about and more. I cannot help but think that American gymnastics will be a much more fair sport once the Karolyis are out of the picture. We may not crank out gold medal gymnasts like a factory (or maybe we will!) but as we see these girls now make it to the top you have to wonder what price some of these girls paid and even if their journeys aren't as rough as Dominique's was what about all of the crushed girls that didn't make it, possibly because of unfair politics? This is the United States, not Romania, not Russia, not China and I have wondered why we have moved to a selection process that appoints gymnasts to a team regardless of what happens in qualifying competition, which is the system we use in most other national sports. Well I found out in this book, it's basically because Marta Karolyi said so. Good for you Dominique for standing up for yourself and thousands of other girls!

B00008H2LB|5.0|The CD I ordered was listed as used, so I was a little worried that it might be scratched up. It came in about 3-4 days after ordering, and in great condition too. I would definitely buy from here again.
B00003CXDD|5.0|If it wasn't for hubby I wouldn't have Willow added to my DVD collection. Just the looks of it makes me think it is boring. But it is a good movie. I even find my self watching it with out hubby around.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|love the movie and now the game. the graphics are awesome and you always win. the quests are very easy.
B007SGM084|5.0|I was warned that the first book was quite \\"pornographic\\" but that if you could look beyond the descriptions and the 4-letter word that is used throughout all three books, it is truly a great love story.  I was able to do just that and so glad that I did.  There's a reason that he took on that role and as it is revealed, and the love story develops, it is amazing.  Loved this book!!
B000003N7K|5.0|If one were to win one over on this music called jazz for a better word--I call it spontaneous composition, then this album would win the prize.  Not only would it win your girlfriend or boyfriend for that matter, but it would probably rival any album that Sinatra or Cole would make. Coltrane is more restrained than ever and his rhythm section's qualities are brought out in this classic session with the unsung Hartman.  No wonder Eastwood used him as background vocal in \\"Bridges Of Madison County\\"--too bad he wasn't around to collect the royalties on that one or maybe his widow did.
B00821PCJS|5.0|I miss many shows when they are first aired, but it's great to be able to go back to the first season of a series like Falling Skies when I belatedly discover them.
034580404X|5.0|These books were extremely entertaining and enjoyable. The character development was so rich that you feel as though they are actual people. Along with being entertaining, it was an easy read so you were able to concentrate on the story line and not get caught up in fancy writing techniques.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I am used to using carbide draw blades, but I really like the finishing touch that the ceramic plates put on a blade. The diamond hone is great on the serrations and fishhooks. It quite sharp - Caution! - but hides well in  the handle.
B0085PFG1U|5.0|Comprehensive, fast, easily learned. Best of all, the developer replied to my question immediately.. Finally, it works on my Asus Flip chromebook.
1468161660|5.0|WOW -- what an excellent book -- I could not put it down.  Excellent characters.  The story just draws you in.  Instantly had to buy the sequel and loved it just as much.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I have a 2-year-old son. we both play and love the games they keep us both busy at times when we need it.<br />I use it when I need to keep him busy, still, and quiet. I get addicted to some as well
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game!it has a few glitches at first and it might forget things sometimes but it is awesome. you should get it! people say is ducks but it doesn't! it is super awesome!
B0084RSYEK|4.0|I love this movie and it has a good message. I would recommend the movie to family and friends. I am so happy to see Eddie Murphy in another great movie keep up the good work.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love it beacause it is every thing combine like Chillies it has all kind of diffrint food.It is like that in fun games.
B0084IG7KC|2.0|I never understood all the hype behind this movie.  It was \\"Good\\" at best.  It was painfully slow in parts and the acting was muted.  This movie was clearly meant to appeal to the Twilight crowd.  As a thirtysomething, I guess I am too old for what amounts to a teen movie, despite a somewhat twisted plot.  Thats all I wanted to say...
B004GJXQ20|1.0|Enjoyed the first novel, and it showed such a great promise. After reading the second it seems as if the overarching theme is repetition, monotony and pointless meandering.<br />It seems as if the author has generated a string of characters and moves them across different pieces of a large games board. All dazed and confused.<br />There are some really interesting themes , however he fails to explore them fully and keeps stringing it out pointlessly. Would benefit from some good editing.
B007MNV5WU|1.0|I like this game and I've played it so I updated this app thinking it would have the other half of utopia. first time it warned me about removing the last version. I pressed cancel then tried again. I pressed yes in the warning then opened the app. I saw that my progress was gone. I wouldn't reccomend updating this app.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Can get mind numbing after a while but a good way to pass the time!!  some of the games are really boring but other are really good. Wishing is my favorite so far.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is so much fun! it has many games and puzzles that are soooo addicting. two words get it!
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I found the first book compelling and the second good. This was one step too far for me. A little too gooey. Nothing really new or compelling
B0086700CM|4.0|its entertaining when you're really bored. though I must say it can be a little laggy at times which can result in your guy dying... but its rare I would say.
B008JAGZDE|5.0|This was a great movie! I recommend watching this if you need some laughter in your life. I sure did and loved it. Brings back memories of the old movies. Evan the European girl shows up in the end and you will not believe the timeing!!!! Must see this!
1469984202|5.0|those who have not read the Wool Omnibus...<br /><br />and those who have.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor, and make sure you are in the latter group- just be prepared to spend a day or two gripped in a uniquely enjoyable series.
B004LWZW8S|4.0|I was expecting a movie similar to 300.  The fighting was great and the style or look of the movie was excellent in Blu Ray.  I would recommend this movie to those that like to watch movies about Greek mythology and war movies.  Much more hand to hand combat than what we see these days with automatic weapons and other guns.<br />The movie looks great in HD.  And there was a deal on the movie which didn't hurt.
B0063GORYU|3.0|i love Spider but using your finger makes the wrong moves sometime.  it needs a &quot;tap&quot; to identify which card or run to move and another &quot;tap&quot; to select the location in which to move the card or run.<br />PS - Try playing one suit and winning in less than 100 moves!!!
B004UNX1LS|3.0|I loved it while it worked.. Now it doesn't open and I cant install it again. Not the first time ive had a problem with it.. FIX IT PLEASE.!
B00015YVD6|5.0|this was touchstones first movie that they had ever made.  they say that Daryle Hanna swam faster and could swim better then then stunt doubles so they got rid of them.  a movie about Daryle Hanna being a mermaid and finding true romance to Tom Hanks.
159514188X|5.0|Thirteen Reasons Why by Jay Asher is probably one of the saddest books I have ever read. That being said, once I started it I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />Like Clay, I found myself unable to stop \\"listening\\" to the tapes. Wanting to know what Hannah's reasons were. Where Clay fit in. How it all went together.<br /><br />It was heartbreaking. To hear all the horrible things that happened to Hannah. The \\"snowball\\" effect. I kept reading, hoping she'd change her mind. Only to remember that the whole reason Clay is listening to them is because... she didn't.<br /><br />I wasn't sure I'd be able to make it all the way through this book... because the story kind of hits close to home. But like I said, I couldn't put it down. I read it in a few hours in the middle of the night, even though I had to wake up at 4am. It was definitely written to be a page turner.<br /><br />Clay was the perfect person to follow as he listened to these tapes. I can't imagine having heard Hannah's story through anyone else. He has this enormous heart and it tears you apart to watch it shatter to pieces as he listens to Hannah's final words.<br />Hannah is this beautiful, crushed soul, just looking for ONE PERSON to reach out to her and show her she's not alone. But the one person who wants to, she pushes away. By the time he knows how desperately she needed him, regardless of her actions toward him, it's too late. And one of the WORST feelings in the world is knowing that there was something you could have done... could have said... that might have made a difference. But you'll never get the chance.<br /><br />Apologies don't matter much when the person's not around to hear them.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to everyone. But with caution. I know there are things in here that are triggers for some people. So just be careful when you read it if you choose to.
B004EPYZV2|5.0|this is a superb movie to see.  one think i like about the movie is the car that Tom drives in the movie.  like the other MI movies full of action and dangerous stunts.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is a awesome game ever one that likes challenges should get this fun filling addictive game I play ever day never miss a beat
B00019074O|5.0|One of the comedy police series out there.  you never would want mess with tackleberry.  the worst candidates end up being the police. watch if you have never seen this before.
B003K1EYM6|4.0|Luckily, my Canon 40D has a USB port - which allows me to use the USB cable from my CF card reader and connect my camera directly to my iPad 3 using this connector. It works quickly and easily. I'm lucky. I'm not sure if the networking connections of newer and/or higher-end SLRs are still compatible or not.<br /><br />And yes, if I try to use the CF card reader as described in other reviews, I get the same error message: \\"Cannot Use Device: The connected USB device requires too much power\\" (using a brand new iPad 3 with the latest iOS 5.1.1.) It boggles the mind why Apple would want to alienate many photographers and make their tablet less useful.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I am on vacation and needed a book that I couldn't put down.  GONE GIRL is that book!  After reading 2 reviews, i went with the 2nd person's advice to stop reading reviews and just get the book.  So I did, and I could NOT stop reading it (so thank u to that review person!)  If I cannot get through a first chapter of any book, I bail.  I was suspicious when I read the first person format, and how it toggled back and forth....I was quickly pulled in, however, and from there it was a race to the finish.  I am totally in agreement with the other reviews i have just read about the ending- let's just say that the process of reading this was so fabulous that you will love it until the last line- you simply want more.  I still will give it 5 stars because if she came out with a sequel, I would be first in line!
B002G1YPH0|3.0|It's too small for a micro-atx case.  The problem is, it stands so tall that most micro-atx cases can't close their lid over it when you install it.  Maybe it works fine for ATX cases, but for micro atx... this is a crazy TALL hs/fan here.
B0063IH60K|4.0|easy to use and hours of mindless fun! I have been playing many variations of this game and found I like this version best of all!
0553386794|5.0|First off, I'm not a huge fantasy/epic guy. However, a lot of friends recommended I watch HBO's Game of Thrones, so I watched it and loved it, but wanted more insight; so I bought the first book. Wow. Without going into too much lengthy detail, if you liked the show, you'll LOVE the book. Honestly, its 800+ pages fly by. Can't wait to get my hands on the second!
B007TR1R22|4.0|Let me state upfront that I new literally next to nothing about this movie when I saw it in the theatres here in Cincinnati this past weekend. All I knew was that it starred Rachel Weisz in some sort of a love drama. That was good enough for me to take a chance on this movie. Glad I did. (Although it was rather strange that I was by far the youngest viewer in the theatre, which incidentally was sold out.)<br /><br />\\"The Deep Blue See\\" (2011 release from the UK; 98 min.) starts off on shaky (or more precise: confusing) ground, as we are immediately thrown into the thick of the story (a woman attempting suicide), which then is broken up with flashbacks on how she got to that point. It took me about 15 min. or so to figure out what was going on, and who was who. After that, the movie took ahold of me, and (without spoiling major plot points), we see Hester (played by Weisz) struggling in her relationships with her husband William (played by Simon Russell Beale) and her lover Freddie (played by Tom Hiddleston). The movie is set in London \\"around 1950\\" but much of the movie feels like a theatre play, to be honest, and that's not necessarily a bad thing, as it really focuses on character development more than anything else (an aspect of movie-making sadly overlooked far too often in your typical Hollywood movie).<br /><br />In all, I was quite taken by this movie. There are several key scneses in the movie where it is just Hester and Freddie, or Hester and William, talking for minutes on end, beautiful! And Rachel Weisz proves once again with this performance that she is one of the top actresses of the post-Meryl Streep generation, right up there with Michelle Williams. If you are in the mood for a \\"talkie\\" movie where things don't get blown up every 5 minutes and characters are actually fleshed out, then by all means \\"The Deep Blue Sea\\" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
1594200823|1.0|I read this book three years ago and finally decided to post my reaction. Michael Pollan's research and engaging story-telling fascinated me, in the first part of the book. But then, I found his blinders sad and his false statements disturbing as he misrepresented the practices of farmers and judged vegetarians/ vegan diets as unhealthy and unsustainable.<br />Also, it was little disgusting that his advice ignored many disadvantaged people lacking time or resources to grow a garden or buy quality food, much less designer food.<br />The New York Times recommendation is becoming a red flag for me as the non-fiction books they rave about are often, like this one, hurriedly sent to press with inaccuracies and glaring bias.<br />I rate this another bestseller that will eventually be abandoned.
B007ZKY7XO|3.0|Yeah, SS have always been \\"out there,\\" but they were also retro and had a bit of a \\"wink wink, nudge nudge\\" quality about them. They took Comfortably Numb - a classic by all counts - and actually made it work to a disco beat. Fire with Fire was awesome and Invisible Light was amazing (the video was hideous...but....), Laura, Take Me Out, Don't Feel Like Dancing.... I can go on and on....but the problem with Magic Hour is that SS seem forced - like middle aged rockers who are courting the late teen audience.  Maybe they are.<br /><br />What's with all the really foul language?  Yeah, they're foul mouthed in concert (I've been to every tour through ATL), but WOW, this seems like foul language just for the sake of it - or maybe more for the \\"audience of it\\". Is there an elusive hip hop audience the SS think they're going to attract with this album?<br /><br />From the concerts I've been to, about 3/4 of the audience were middle aged folks (30's - 50's) who relished that a young band was making inclusive music for multiple generations...50% of Magic Hour is targeted to whatever audience is into unimaginative, repetitive, hip hop and rap beats. There are remixes, but only of songs are the ones I don't care for. Where are the lyrics that have been so great in the past?  What about the riffs and the great little tweaks they've had in past albums? The other 50% is great SS stuff!  I wish the whole album were made up of those songs!<br /><br />Keep Your Shoes, Let's Have a Kiki, Shady Love, F*** Yeah are all rather too hip hop for my taste.<br /><br />Baby Come Home and Only the Horses are good, but there's not much to the lyrics.<br /><br />Inevitable, Year of Living Dangerously, San Luis Obispo (my favorite), The Secret Life of Letters, Somewhere, Best in Me and Self Control are what we have come to know as Scissor Sisters bread and butter - sort of 70's/80's/dance 90's - all tuned up for the present.<br /><br />The good songs outnumber the ones I don't care for, but it'sreally annoying having to skip songs. Guess when I burn these to my iPod I'll just have to not upload the ones I don't like.<br /><br />Good album overall - but the remixes and the hip hop stuff just isn't to my taste.<br /><br />I bought it and I'm listening to it - yeah, I'd recommend it.
B00821OUT6|2.0|The series is no where a match for other programs on cable or network TV. The production of this series is horrible and cheap. The special effects looks like out of the 80's and the acting is sub-par. Too bad, the actors are well known and mostly good...I would blame this on the director, budget and the production.
B007VTVGAQ|4.0|I'm so looking forward to the last half of 2012, at least for new music. Some really good things planned to come out - some with release dates, some not yet set.<br /><br />I got the newest one from Fiona Apple a few weeks back. All hype on 'The Idler Wheel Is Wiser Than the Driver of the Screw and Whipping Cords Will Serve You More Than Ropes Will Ever Do' , there is no way it can live up to all the PR that it got.<br /><br />...and it doesn't. Which isn't to say it's bad. It isn't.....but you build something up that much, it's destined to not meet expectations.<br /><br />But I like it, or most of it. Like a lot of the music I buy, it's a little off-center, and while Apple has always been that way, she takes it to a new level with 'The Idler Wheel'.<br /><br />The disk is very stripped down compared to some of her other works, and those were never brimming with over the top production. Over her career, it took me a long time to warm-up to Apple, but I did and like her music and her risks.....and this is her riskiest. If you're looking for classic melodies or arrangements, this isn't really the album for you.<br /><br />For those who want to hear something more innovative and interesting, you might take a listen.<br /><br />Yes, she is angsty. Yes, there are semi-volatile moments, but that's her style overall, just in context of song.<br /><br />Recorded a few years ago and held by her until she wanted to release it, the disk sat on a shelf since then waiting to see daylight.  But if you're looking for radio airplay - forget it. Maybe college radio or some obscure XM station, but even her most accessible songs were for MTV (eons ago) and not radio.<br /><br />The first \\"single\\", \\"Every Single Night\\" is seemingly one of the most difficult song to grasp and it give attention to Apple's style for this disk, but I fear it won't make anyone go out an purchase the album because of this.  But it is only seemingly the most difficult - as it's the first track. The more you delve into the recording, the more you discover more obscure tunes.<br /><br />But I like \\"Every Single Night\\" as well as \\"Daredevil\\", \\"Left Alone\\", \\"Regret\\" (that one took me a few listens), \\"Periphery\\", \\"Anything We Want\\" and \\"Hot Knife\\".<br /><br />The other 3-4 songs are ok, one's if they rotate through my playlist, I'll let play, but doubtful they'd be ones I'd search out.<br /><br />Still it is the most interesting disk of 2012, that's for sure, but it still couldn't stand-up to the pre-release hype.delve into the recording, the more you discover more obscure tunes.<br /><br />But I like \\"Every Single Night\\" as well as \\"Daredevil\\", \\"Left Alone\\", \\"Regret\\" (that one took me a few listens), \\"Periphery\\", \\"Anything We Want\\" and \\"Hot Knife\\".<br /><br />The other 3-4 songs are ok, one's if they rotate through my playlist, I'll let play, but doubtful they'd be ones I'd search out.<br /><br />Still it is the most interesting disk of 2012, that's for sure, but it still couldn't stand-up to the pre-release hype.
B0058SNLIC|5.0|my girlfriend loved them, i certainly recieved a lot of credit for them! its always nice to make a girl happy
B0002KVUKM|2.0|The central conceit of Van Helsing, that the Universal movie monsters of the 1930s were real and that Van Helsing was a supernatural being committed by a secret religious sect to defeat them, gave a nice spin to old material. Several of the actors, including Hugh Jackman and head vampire Richard Roxburgh, chew scenery with gusto. Kate Beckinsale, by contrast, seems to be trying to play her role straight, which doesn't work as well.<br /><br />The special effects dominate almost every scene, and they're not great, even allowing for the fact that this film was released in 2004. I liked the werewolf transformation sequences, which are handled creatively, but most of the rest was sub-video-game quality.<br /><br />There's an amusing scene near the beginning that spoofs James Bond receiving his weapons from Q. Otherwise, the humor is mostly limited to action-movie quips. Too bad, this movie could have been a lot funnier. The religious aspect of Van Helsing's origin seemed odd and out of place; they could have just skipped that.<br /><br />I have read that people are working on a remake of this film, perhaps starring Tom Cruise. Surely a star of his magnitude can find better material?
B006LSZECO|3.0|I usually like a book to grab my attention in the first couple chapters (or 20% or so), this one did not.  Several times I nearly decided to quit reading it.  Finally I told myself I would go to 30%, well I kept going, and at about the 1/2 mark, I was finally interested with the twist and turns in the plot.  However, I felt like the authur just had a page limit and had to end it after a certain amount of pages.  Very abrupt ending....strange ending.  Overall, I think about 1/2 of the book as an ok read.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|very useful when reading or playing.  know how much time before you die....or when to plug in!  take the chance and download the app, it is great!
B007ORVC36|4.0|The only time I had any issue at all was with the video stopping and waiting for it to continue- which was when I was at someone's home with a weak internet signal. When I was home (where I have 6.0Mbps), it ran perfectly fine, no shaking or stopping.  I'm happy with my purchase!
B005M2V2K8|4.0|Cashmere the Cat isn't what she appears in her picture!<br />The eyes are much closer together and she's is a bit lighter. Also her whiskers are slightly shorter than the picture portrays.<br />Despite this, she's still an adorable addition to my Beanie Boos collection. I'm glad I bought this product. :)
B008MEM24S|5.0|great game for kids and adults!  This game is great for children.  This game teaches kids basic physics.  really fun too
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|it is fun I like the game wish there was a way to get more town money with out buying it but iv still just started playing....
B008J05EL8|1.0|Wow, this is not a very good price point for an add-on to a paid application. I'm afraid I'm going to have to pass on this one. Nice try though.
B008MEM24S|4.0|The game is very challenging. It may be similar to &quot;Where's my Water&quot; but with new twists. You will really get your dollar's worth. You will never regret that you bought it.

B004VMUS9G|3.0|The shake feature stopped working about a week after getting the app. It happened three different times, I had to pull the battery, and never use the shake mode.
B000FCKBCU|4.0|I read this book in a day and a half and enjoyed it. It is another fun, quick, light hearted read by Kinsella. Surprisingly, I took quite a few lessons from the main character, Samantha. Samantha leaves her work-aholic life behind for a job as a housekeeper. It opens her eyes to a work-life balance and defining herself as a person, not a career woman. It is a good read that many can relate too, which  is uncommon in novels.
B0034G4P8A|4.0|Well i haven't watched it yet but the transaction with Amazon was quick & easy + free shipping too. I hope its as good as everyone says and then i need to watch the Avengers
B007L3BMGA|1.0|I feel a bit peeved that spem in alium is forever associated with this trash. Glad I didnt spend any money on it.
B007SSEBCU|5.0|It is refreshing to see that film-makers CAN produce a really good movie about a conservative; a WOMAN, no less!  Although the flash-backs were sometimes disconcerting, the Meryl Streep's acting was supurb.  I really did not detect the usual liberal bias that is often present in films of this sort.  Well worth seeing.
1936608898|5.0|This book is amazing. Written in a witty and highly readable way, It Starts With Food will uncover the reasons behind your out-of-control overeating, energy deficit, and midnight binge fests. From insulin resistance to Leaky Gut Syndrome, understanding how your body is affected by the foods you eat will certainly have you thinking twice before you shove that next Nutty Bar down your gullet. We weren't made to eat the pseudo food that is rolling off the assembly lines these days, and this book explains why. If you're looking to live your best life, it's time to start looking at the foods you eat. Dallas and Melissa Hartwig show you how to remove the top offenders from your diet for 30 days, and then how to reintroduce them in order for you to evaluate how your unique body reacts to each food. From there it's up to you what you do with the foods you put in. You'll know how your body will respond, and from there you can decide if it's worth it. Does a single scoop of double chocolate chip ice cream send you to the pantry looking for anything and everything you can possibly get your hands on twenty minutes later? Or do you feel satisfied until your next meal? Arm yourself with some food knowledge; knowledge about who *you* are - it could change your life.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is a great game. Though, I think it should be easier to unlock more games or it should come with more games. other than that,  this game is my favorite game on the kindle and it is so addicting.

B00782O7NE|5.0|This is a beautifully written movie. Jean Dujardin, Bérénice Bejo, and Dan Goodman made this a Colorful movie about a silent film star who is comfortable in his world of silence. When he heres sounds for the fist time, he is scared not knowing the world is changing around him. I will give this movie 5 stars.
0525457585|4.0|I am a twenty-three-year-old American guy who likes to read at least three or four books a month (I do have other things in my life other than reading, and I write a lot; I'm not the type of person who can read a book in two days because I don't have the time and I read slow for picking up on literary techniques for my own writing) and I just happened to have \\"The Neverending Story\\" next on my reading list. I had just read Stephen King's (or should I say, Richard Bachman's) \\"Roadwork\\" (which is surprisingly a lot like AMC's Breaking Bad), and then, quite the opposite comes up on my reading list: this book.<br /><br />I bought the book because at the time it had a 5/5 stars on Amazon. That usually means it's a good book (especially if it has more than two hundred votes), read Robert McCammon's \\"Boy's Life\\" to see what I mean. Currently someone has given this book a 1/5 because, and I quote, it \\"ends.\\" But, at the same time, I cannot--in good conscience--give this book a perfect score, because it isn't a perfect story, nor is the writing style as charming as Rowling or Tolkien, or as imaginative and morally rich as Lewis, nor as dark as King or Barker or Martin, but I digress from the main point that this is not adult--nor is it serious--fantasy. Therefore I can't possibly compare it with a the realistic fantasy that George R.R. Martin has in his \\"Game of Throne\\" series, and neither can I compare it to the mind-bending concepts depicted in Stephen King's \\"Dark Tower\\" series. The point of which is, considering my age, gender and nationality, this book doesn't quite hit the spot with my tastes; I can't hold that little fact against this book at gunpoint though.<br /><br />Anyway, in terms of reader audiences, I can only compare it to Rowling and Lewis. But, like I said, this novel doesn't have the charm or smarts of the previously mentioned . . . so, it sort of is in between a hard and a soft spot, so to speak. Also, something to mention, the \\"Harry Potter\\" series is something an adult can enjoy because it deals with themes--personal, political, religious--that any adult from any part of the world can relate to.<br /><br />\\"The Neverending Story\\" is sort of like Christopher Nolan's \\"Inception,\\" except it's not a dream within a dream, but a story within a story (within a story) and at some points the realms merge. Part of me feels a very \\"Dark Tower\\" undertone, in which there are hidden worlds all around us, and another part of me feels like this entire story is a cop out--like, \\"It was all a dream.\\" Now that's not to say it was; but quite literally, it might have been.<br /><br />Bastian, the protogonist, falls asleep while reading the book and then he goes into the world of Fantastica. Then he wakes up. It sort of reminds me of the end of Guillermo del Toro's \\"The Labyrinth\\" because it's possible that when the protagonist in that film gets shot at the very end, that the place she goes to is actually Heaven or a type of purgatory or just her brain imagining the magical kingdom awaiting her just before her spirit leaves her corpse; I compare \\"The Neverending Story\\" to that movie because it leaves the audience not sure if it really happened or not. That's okay, sometimes. In this book it doesn't really work for the mid-twenties American male. And trust me, I had an open mind, and I am still giving this book a pretty good score.<br /><br />I did find the biggest flaw--other than the fact that it takes the reader out of the story by making them completely aware that everything that is happening is actually a story that the main character is reading; in other words, breaking the fourth wall--was that the story was overly bloated. The person who had given this a 1/5 did so because the book ended too soon (well, if they read the entire book in two days, they must have enjoyed it enough to not stop reading), and I envy that person because I wish I had read this book in two days. It's LONG for a young adult book. But what makes it appear even longer is the fact that the pacing is a little strange and the character progression really has no rhyme or reason. You meet characters once and never see them again. Why? Well, I suppose that's another story and shall be told another time. Right? Ha-ha. Aside from the odd placement of characters and strange beats in the pacing, the story becomes a different animal altogether at the halfway point. In fact, it feels like a different story altogether. That's odd. It's jarring. I didn't like it because I was beginning to like Atreyu and Falkor and I could care less for the whimpy, would-be hero that was reading the book in the attic of his school.<br /><br />What the book does best is its inventiveness. Bastian reads a book that's the same title as this book and the characters in the story need a hero from some unnamed outside world (Earth) to give the Childlike Empress a new name. But of course it can't be Bastian that they're talking about, right? It is. And it's innovative storytelling, but it's a hollow innovation, because Bastian is having all the fun. Not us. If the author had found a way for US (those who read the book) to have a role in the story, NOW THAT WOULD BE SMART! And genuinely innovative. I know that Clive Barker attempted such a book with \\"Mr. B Gone,\\" but it didn't really turn out so good. Although the concept was there.<br /><br />Something else to note. Translations. In the English version of this novel, the style and the voice all lies with the translator, as opposed to the original author, Michael Ende. Seriously, consider the Holy Bible--there are many translations, and translations make a big difference in the reader's experience. I'm not saying that the translator got this book wrong (because I can't read this book in its original form, so I can't compare), but I am saying that a translator can't translate greatness. Consider this: read Stephen King's \\"It\\" and imagine somebody else wrote an adaptation based off the movie. They're going to be two different animals. Style--style is something that a translator can't translate perfectly, and I think that may be what happened here. That might explain why this novel feels like someone is telling a story told by someone else, rather than telling it themselves. And it gets a little chaotic with that way of thinking considering the subject matter of this novel . . . ugh!<br /><br />I give this a 3.5/5 because it's not terrible, but I didn't get anything from this book. As a reader, I didn't particularly enjoy it; as a writer, I didn't pick up on any new writing tools. It was just . . . bland. Maybe at one point in time it was revolutionary (perhaps around the time that it was adapted into a film, directed by Wolfgang Peterson--and I was NOT taking that into account when reading this book; I've never seen the movie), but now it feels really dated. Some things age well, like \\"The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time\\" and some things don't. Either I'm too mature for this book (but I loved \\"Harry Potter\\") or this book just hasn't aged well.<br /><br />Although, fans of young adult fantasy will likely gobble this book up--and that's probably the target audience. I just couldn't get into this book. So, if you're twenty-ish, American and guy, I'd suggust that you try Stephen King's The Dark Tower series, George R.R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire, and even Clive Barker's Abarat series . . . sure, it's young adult, but Clive is disturbing.ven longer is the fact that the pacing is a little strange and the character progression really has no rhyme or reason.

B008MEM24S|4.0|nice to have more element-changing -inators, but the frequent talking and captions at the bottom get annoying.  I haven't looked closely at the settings though so there may be an easy fix for those.  game is fun and challenging.
1594202842|4.0|Being Asian myself, I could understand where Amy Chua was coming from. But what I found odd was that she was born and raised in America, yet her views on parenting are more radical and harsh than most Chinese immigrants! I understood the importance of playing an instrument (I failed miserably at it and was allowed to quit - which I will admit I regret to this day that I did), but to play for up to 6 hours a day at such a young age is ridiculous. Having to bring the violin or rent out the library etc to play the piano or violin was ridiculous and excessive. She brought Asian parenting to a whole new level that I hadn't even seen in Asia! I felt that even though the book was satirical because hindsight is 20/20, but I felt that her actions were trying to prove she's more Asian than Asians because she's an ABC (American Born Chinese). My family immigrated and they weren't remotely as harsh on me as she was with her own children!<br /><br />There were parts of the book that I could relate to but other parts that left me thinking she was nuts. I think the important thing is to NOT take this book too seriously because it's meant to be reflective and at times funny or callous. This is by no means a guide to raising straight A model students who will go on to the Ivy Leagues and pop out more babies who will repeat the cycle. She states her views, admits a few mistakes along the way and ends up accepting that sometimes we have to let go a little.<br /><br />I think if my mother read this book, she'd even say that the author is crazier than she was with us - and I'd agree. Overall I'd say it was a good, quick read (took only a few hours) for someone who wants a glimpse of Asian parenting in all its glory and catastrophe.<br /><br />Definitely no literary masterpiece, but I think I'll keep it as a reminder of my own upbringing and how I can relate to many of the things she discusses.
0345803493|5.0|Received all three books together and quicker than expected. Thoroughly enjoyed all three. What a wonderful story. They are page turners - you just have to see what's going to happen next. I know all the hype is about the explicit/provocative parts but the most endearing to me was the love story between two people. Loved them!

031620157X|5.0|Anyone who loves fairy tales has probably wished at some point that they could fall into their favorite book or be friends with their favorite characters. And books from The Sisters Grimm to THE MAGICIAN'S BOY have explored what the world might be like if all of the characters from the world's best-loved fairy tales knew each other and played supporting roles in each other's stories.<br /><br />The fact that fairy tale characters do know each other, hang out together and argue amongst themselves is something that twins Alex and Conner Bailey are going to find out firsthand when a gift from their grandmother turns into an adventure in The Land of Stories, where Red Riding Hood has a crush on Jack of beanstalk fame, and where Snow White's stepmother has escaped from prison.<br /><br />But before we get to The Land of Stories, let's backtrack. Alex (a girl) and Conner (a boy) are 11 years old and live with their mother. Their father died tragically about a year ago, and while Mrs. Bailey does everything she can to keep things together, their loss is hard to deal with. This is something that the twins' teacher, Mrs. Peters, is only too happy to remind Conner of every time he falls asleep in class. Alex, on the other hand, is the teacher's pet, especially when it comes to the class's current unit on fairy tales. Alex knows it all --- or at least she thinks she does. When Conner catches her falling into the book their grandmother gave them (The Land of Stories, of course), he follows her in.<br /><br />It turns out that fairy tales are a little less tame than Alex thought, and just because when we read them they turn out okay doesn't mean that there's no evil left. From gnomes who kidnap to witches who still like to eat children, there are plenty of dangers in The Land of Stories, and so Alex and Conner quickly decide that they need to work on finding a way home. But that's easier said than done, as the best way to get out, says their new friend Froggy, is to gather the objects needed for the Wishing Spell, an ancient, mythical thing rumored to grant any wish, no matter how big or small. And the \\"ingredients\\" for the Wishing Spell aren't your usual eye of newt variety; instead, they have to go throughout the many kingdoms that make up the Land of Stories and find the very objects that were made famous in fairy tales, from one of Cinderella's glass slippers to a piece of the bark that made Red Riding Hood's basket.<br /><br />THE WISHING SPELL is clearly Chris Colfer's love letter to all Western fairy tales, from the Brothers Grimm and Hans Christian Andersen to L. Frank Baum's THE WIZARD OF OZ. While it's not the most original fairy tale retelling, it shines because of the quirky personalities of many of the fairy tale characters. Goldilocks makes the perfect bandit, and Red Riding Hood definitely needs sleep therapy. There are also layers of humor that make THE WISHING SPELL a fun read for families, who at any age can find different things to laugh at. For those who can't get enough of fairy tales, Colfer's debut novel will feed your insatiable fantasy appetite.<br /><br />Reviewed by Sarah Hannah Gomez

B0013TXA5Y|5.0|First I need to say that this was an outstanding read in Cassie Clare's Mortal Instruments Series. As a creative writing tutor and author of [[ASIN:B0065QYXQA When Copper Suns Fall]], I'll say that I speak from experience when I mention that it is VERY difficult to create an entirely new world of celestial creatures without someone feeling confused about what just happened. In my humble opinion, Ms. Clare has created a well-drawn world in City of Bones. Not once did I feel confused or lost and I didn't feel that the pacing was off. Yes, you must read carefully, and yes, you will enjoy the story if you don't get wrapped up in deciphering each and every detail. I've seen numerous posts that mentioned the pacing problem and I'm sorry, but I just don't agree.<br /><br />The book contains demon slayers and angels and strange races that are hard to pronounce, but in the end Ms. Clare won me over. Angel books don't come with a guide on how to read them. These books come in all flavors: entirely clean, very violent, or ambiguous so that it's hard to tell who is on what side. In angel books, that's what makes them so much fun. Jace had me worried about this throughout the entire book. I didn't know what he was all about, or what he would do to Clary. And I kind of didn't like him at first because he was so very cocky. But Clare's ending made it all come together. I was finally able to come off the edge of my seat. But that's what made this book so much fun. I gave in to my imagination and went along for the ride.<br /><br />I recently purchased this book again for my kindle app. It was $.99 and that was a steal. Thank you Ms. Clare and Amazon. I'm going to re-read it. I loved it that much and Ms. Clare's world of angels is that good. If you're open to a wild ride with vivid and rich creations then you'll feel the same way. 5 solid stars.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|I only read this book because I wanted to know why Mr Grey was a psycho, the story it´s simple and I like it, but I have to confess that I skip some chapters, they are so full of unreal sex, that I get really mad, really someone belive that?<br />The trama of the boss and grey´s ex could be better, it´s poor, I think that the author felt a little hurry to end with them.<br />I am not going to read the third because it is so obvios that Mr Grey it´s going to be charming and that the exboss is going to haunt them, predictable, so I will save my money and time.
B003XRELGQ|5.0|(this review contains no spoilers)<br /><br />CAT'S CRADLE was the first thing by Kurt Vonnegut that I ever read, and honestly, I would probably recommend this novel above all others as the best place to start reading Vonnegut's work.  It's relatively short, and chapters are only a page or two long.  The book moves at such an incredible pace that it's hard to put it down.  Beyond that, the book contains messages and themes that I still think about today (it's been about 5-6 years since I've read it).<br /><br />The crux of the book involves a hopeful author that tries to make sense of the Hiroshima bombing.  He stumbles across the story of a mad-scientist involved in the making of the atomic bomb.  While searching for information concerning this scientist, he stumbles across the scientist's children and a strange creation only known as \\"Ice-Nine.\\"<br /><br />The essence of Vonnegut's writing concerns the underbelly of humanity: war, greed, anger, stupidity.  This book particularly was written in response to the Cold War and the Cuban Missile Crisis.  Instead of his books being dark, dreary affairs, they are actually pretty funny and full of wit.  Vonnegut's philosophy is that, when faced with something horrible, you can cry or laugh; he prefers to laugh, as it involves less tears.  Laughing at these truths are the only things that stop us from crying.  Much of the plot of CAT'S CRADLE would, in any other context, be pretty disturbing, but given the author's knack for humor and pacing, it becomes a satirical farce.<br /><br />Kurt Vonnegut is often considered to be a science-fiction author (probably due to the alien presence in [[ASIN:0385333846 SLAUGHTERHOUSE-FIVE]]), but CAT'S CRADLE is largely devoid of any kind of scientific-mumbo-jumbo.  Sometimes this novel is dinged for its flat characters, but as long as readers keep in mind that these are less of characters and more of symbolic representations of humanity's various faces, this probably won't be an issue.<br /><br />I would recommend CAT'S CRADLE to most people I know.  In fact, I would recommend it to anyone interested in the plot's premise, but I would especially suggest this novel to anyone who is looking for a good gateway to begin reading Kurt Vonnegut.  CAT'S CRADLE or SLAUGHTERHOUSE-FIVE are both good places to start, but due to CAT'S CRADLE's more brief nature and absurd themes, I'd recommend it first./><br />I would recommend CAT'S CRADLE to most people I know.

B004K4IZ3G|5.0|This is an excellent movie that continues the original story line of Tron many decades ago. It bridges the time span between the first and second movie perfectly, brings back familiar characters and introduces new ones.

Every other chapter is told from the perspective of the husband, with the other chapters told from the perspective of the wife.

B005LAIIRQ|1.0|I had always thought anything with Liam Neeson was going to be a good movie.  I've had to adjust that thought.<br /><br />The disjointed beginning of the movie wasn't helped with Neeson's voice over.  I find that movies that do not do a terrific job up front with flashbacks, lose me before the movie is ten minutes in.  The flashback to Neeson's family isn't a binding force.  It is too soon to care for the character's, so it is wasted on the viewer.  Shooting the wolf in the opening scenes also lacks cohesion.<br /><br />Eventually, the scene shifts to a plane, inane conversation and a crash that is as disjointed as the start of the movie.  And then survival and wolves.<br /><br />I can't begin to explain how utterly unending and boring the rest of the movie is.  Punctuated with moments of thrill/fear as the wolves threaten the survival of each man in turn..... the monotony rendered this movie forgettable.<br /><br />I truly began to root for a quick end to the struggling group.  Go wolves!  Just put me out of my misery.<br /><br />When the end of the movie came, I remained non-plussed.<br /><br />In our house, there is generally at least one person that will like the movie.  That was not the case with this movie.  It was a painful experience all around.

1400049628|4.0|There has been so many reviews already, there isn't much to add, but I will say my piece and move on.<br /><br />As a security dealer I fight zombie hordes everyday. It is frustrating going for a zombie's jugular, when he just keeps on coming. Now I know to aim for the head. That has been such helpful, my kill rate has gone through the roof. It is reassuring to know that a zombie's life span rarely exceeds three years, which is longer than I give the economy. This book is a must for anyone who wants to live long enough to advance up the corporate ladder. But no matter how far you rise never forget that you're only safer, not safe. One out of four zombies can climb and that's an extremely sobering statistic!
B0072NWKEC|5.0|I enjoyed reading Prague Fatale because it was a mystery that moved along nicely. I'd been looking for a book set in the Czech Republic because I'd recently traveled there and this really was an interesting and fun read.  It was also a history lesson concerning WW II.  I especially liked that most of the characters in the book were real people who had a role in the war.  After the book ended the author told what happened to the characters after the war.  The mystery was fiction though.
0385344228|1.0|Maybe I didn't give the book enough of a chance, but I did read up to Chapter 4, and couldn't take any more. I found the DA lead character pompous and obnoxious, the family comical, the dialogue strange, unnatural and forced in all cases where there was dialogue.... The bedroom scene, the scene with the family at breakfast, the scene with all the couples returning to the school; in all cases I found the dialogue to be poor, and the characters unnatural. I only read 38 pages so maybe the book became great, but it was all I could manage to read

B000Q6GUTI|1.0|The movie has an agenda and it isn't to entertain but rather to preach.  The script reads like a North Korean newspaper article about the United States.  If Osama Bin Laden needed an illustration for his speeches, he would picked this film.  The villains in this film consist of:<br />1.  US Soldiers who have won the Medal of Honor.  Apparently, they did so while wiping out entire villages in order to help with establish oil pipes.<br />2.  People prone to saying things like \\"Land of the Free and Home of the Brave.\\"  The villains here like these slogans while filling mass graves with dead civilians.<br />3.  Politicians out of Montana. The movie pretends not to associate with political parties, but it leaves little room for the imagination to figure out that the film targets conservative Americans.<br /><br />The plot: USMC Sniper Mark Wahlberg shoots up some rebels in the opening scene.  It turns out that (unbeknown to him) he's killing some fighters who are rushing to rescue some civilians being massacred by the United States in a nearby village.  The civilians were massacred so the oil pipe could run through their village.  And, of all the places where they could be buried, the US Government buries them all underneath the oil pipe and then hands out medals of honor to the commanders who handled the operation.  Left wing garbage one would expect in a North Korean newspaper.

However, i don`t know what happened when Atlantic went and tried to do a dig. remaster of this great album, but it did`nt work. The sound came out tinny, and no depth on the bass end of the music. I have many albums that have been remasterd, and they are all great. Too bad no one was watching the boards when they did this one. sometimes it is better to leave well enough alone. Still a great album.

0553801473|3.0|I feel like most of the reviews sum up my thoughts quite well, but here is my two cents. This series started off as an original, intricate and engaging story. Unfortunately after the first few books, the story has come to a virtual standstill. I find that this book is like climbing a mountain; you can take the straight route to the top which may bypass a few sights, but gets you there quick, or you can switchback your way up and take your time. I feel like Martin has switchbacked, doubled back, stopped for lunch and then decided to go back down and try the other side of the mountain. The characters are still engaging but after the twentieth kidnapping, I as a reader started to get a little restless. Danaerys has been in the desert for so long I am becoming bored with who used to be my favorite character. Cersei is predictable in her actions by this point, and I really couldn't care less about all the drama happening at the Iron Throne. I am hopeful that Martin will pick up the pace and reunite all of our beloved characters in an epic battle, an overseas war..heck at this point I'd settle for a drunken feast. At this rate I feel like Bran will live out his days as a tree, Tyrion will ride off on a pig into the sunset and Danaerys will get swallowed by a sandstorm.<br />I wish I could be as drawn in to this book as I was for the first few. But it was a struggle to finish to be honest. Here's hoping Mr. Martin picks up the pace with the next few books.<br />Thats my opinion of it. You don't have to agree, and I hope you liked it more than I did, but unfortunately, I found it to be a let down.
0143034901|2.0|This book has had a lot of hype so I thought I would read it. It tells an improbable story of a boy who by chance comes into possession of a copy of a book by Julian Carax.  The boy, Daniel, seeks to find out more about the author and the book tells about that search, and of the romance which led Carax to leave Barcelona to go to Paris.  There is much extravaganct melodrama, none of which really caught me up. Yes, I wanted to know what would happen, but there was nothing too admirable about any of the heroic characters--though one had to be \\"for\\" them rather than the excessively evil people seeking their destruacition.  I was glad the ending was as it was, but the air of fantasy hanging over the events--none very logical--did not remind me of great novels of the classic genre--which I think the book was designed to do.  I found it too long and was glad it was not longer.  I understand there is a prequel, but I am not tempted to want to read it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|i don't really know what a review is so i am just going to right my opinion. i really like this book but i want to borrow it for free and it says that it has reached it's monthly limit.i don't know how to get rid of that. i hope you get rid of it immediately.  Thankyou
0307352145|5.0|As a new teacher, I was surprised -and dismayed- by how much movement and noise affect me in the classroom. This book really helped me understand why, as an introvert, I am so sensitive and why I almost always eat lunch alone. It's such a relief to know that I'm not strange and I'm not alone. I also really enjoyed the section on the Culture of Personality prevalent in our society and how we all feel we must \\"sell\\" ourselves. No wonder I've often felt out of sync, especially as a teenager. Highly recommend this book for IN personalities.

B003X7MCGW|5.0|I passed on buying this album before wondering how different these versions of the songs could be.  I was  pleasantly surprised at how incredible this album is.  I've been a fan of the Black Crowes since Shake your Moneymaker, and still love their music.  I feel these songs should be shared with everyone.
B0012Q732O|1.0|Set in the prehistoric times there's a mammoth hunter named D'Leh (Steven Strait, \\"The Covenant\\") who must fight back and lead a band of warriors against an oppressive army that captures a beautiful young woman named Evolet (Camilla Belle, \\"Push\\"). Thats about the gist of the movie, D'Leh fights through rough terrain, battles the elements and fights giant creatures with a spear and his own cunning.<br /><br />While any caveman/prehistoric movie is more often than not meant as campy fun, this one is an exception. Its slow and boring, not a lot of good if any decent acting, the cinematography is well done at least so it looks pretty as does Camilla, though once again she's not terribly expressive or that good of an actress. The battle sequence at the end is fairly underwhelming and just kinda there, sure there are some decent visual effects but when the story and dialogue aren't that energetic it makes for a long and boring alleged epic. * out of 4 stars.

B002KSPKRS|1.0|I ordered this product hoping it would be better than what I currently have.  It wasn't!!  I currenttly have the Turtle Beach X31 headset and the Turtle Beach DDS.  The Turtle Beach X41 did worse.  I realize this is mostly personal, but I missed a fair amount or ambient noise (game environment sounds) or in-game sounds (shooting or footsteps, etc.).  The X41 also lacked in depth of range, I missed the deeper bass sounds.  The X31 have a button that permit up to 4 sound quality settings, each offering a significant nuance difference in what you hear.  The X41 have a similar button, but here you only have 2 range options.  An hour after I unpackaged the X41 I was repackaging them again and made arrangements to ship them back.  The vendor was wonderful and took them back with a full refund.
B001BPJJ9G|5.0|My darling husband (then boyfriend) introduced me to this incredible movie. I'd never even heard of it. I was instantly grabbed and pulled in by the simple beauty of this story. The acting of \\"Alexandria\\" and \\"Roy\\" is natural, easy, and unaffected. You swear you're watching a genuine interaction between two strangers instead of something rehearsed or directed. Alexandria is adorable, ornery, and sweet. Roy is affable, charming, frightened, and depressed. The acting of the five \\"bandits\\" is equally likable, both melodramatic and endearing, just as a five year old might imagine them to be. The stark difference, visually, between the bland hospital and the vibrant, lush, extravagant imagery of the imagined story, is nothing short of powerful. I admire creativity and good acting above almost anything else in a movie, and this one delivers! The ending is heart-rending and captivating, you can't look away, wondering if Roy will find any redemption... as the \\"story\\" he tells Alexandria becomes tainted with his own despair and grief, and her own little heart starts to break... well, you just have to see for yourself how it all ends :)
B0058VW36U|5.0|got this app about 8 months ago. don't go 2 days without playing it. I would put 1 billion stars if I could. I am not gonna lie when I told the title. got it on the kindle fire and it barely makes you wait (all except when you wait 10 milliseconds to wait for the level). but never go to the main menu on your device when loading on it.<br /> FLAWLESS! totally deserves at least 5 stars.
0307269752|4.0|produces a visceral emotional response. Then, this book is a good one. You will like the characters and you will care about them.<br /><br />The book is not set at Disney World and \\"The Girl\\" is not Minnie. There are despicable events in the book and you may be disturbed by them. But, presumably you are not eleven years old and you will able to keep firmly in mind that it is fiction.<br /><br />It's much easier to be a critic than is is to be a writer. I don't know  a single person who, after reading the first book, failed to read the second and the third. I know about thirty people who read all three. If there is a fourth, I will read it, too.

B007X4N0DU|4.0|There is no doubt that Murdered Love is taking P.O.D. back to their roots. From Snuff the Punk to Satellite P.O.D. carried a wide range of diversity in their music from heavy metal to punk to funk, and this is the first album since those days to carry the same diversity. Eyez and Murdered Love open up the album with very similar sounds and I was preparing myself for much of the same for the rest of the album, but got quite the surprise. Some highlighted moments are from Beautiful, which is a departure from the traditional P.O.D. sound without sounding to weird or goofy. West Coast Rocksteady is the prime and perfect P.O.D. track on the album, made all the more enjoyable by the guest vocals of Cyprus Hill's Sen Dog. Babylon is a murderer and Panic and Run both see the band rocking back into a classic nu-metal style with punk influenced choruses.<br /><br />Some lower points on the album, while Bad Boy is overall one of my favorite tracks on the album the idea of Sonny calling himself a bad boy just seems goofy to me and I can't help but smile and giggle whenever I hear him sing it. Lastly as forementioned in previous reviews, is the dropping of the muted F-bomb 6 times in the final track I am. I can look past that they leave the hanging question of \\"Would you really come and die for me?\\", that kind of leaves a question for the listener to ask God when they hit a difficult time, but I find the use of language, muted or not, just takes away from the overall meaning of the track and is kind of pointless.<br /><br />Overall this is one P.O.D.'s best for sure, and if we're lucky we can see them back in the spotlight where they belong.

I highly recommend this book to those who like a bit of smut in their romance novels.
0547569653|2.0|I read this book excited to get tips from Scott, and to get a better look into the mind of the ultrarunner.  While he did provide some insight into his mind set it was usually fleeting.<br /><br />What put me off was his preaching a Vegan lifestyle, and comparing vegan-ism to a magical elixir that would cure all your woes.  Scott talked of having no pain after a 50/100 mile run and attributed it to eating a vegan diet.  I HIGHLY doubt this is true.  Perhaps the vegan diet helped with some of his health and high blood pressure, but natural ability, coaching, and I'm certain a unreal level of commitment to training is the true culprit.  That said in hindsight a book by a vegan called Eat & Run should have alerted me to the vegan propaganda I had just paid to read.<br /><br />I also found Scott to not carry the Ultrarunner mantel of helping and encouraging each other, he seemed to have an unhealthy dislike for those who grew up in mountainous regions.  He also just seemed like an idiot during his runs, to his friend, and to his competitors.<br /><br />I liked the Scott Jurek brand before this book, after reading it he put me off.  Be a Vegan and I'm great...that's what his message was, oh and live in a car and run all day because I live free and the reset of you suck because you don't.<br /><br />I know alot of people are not Dean Karnazes fans, but if you read Ultramarathon man your in a better place, its just as detailed (meaning little), less preachy, and Dean comes off as a character you can cheer for.  Scott not so much.<br /><br />That said he did have some decent vegetarian recipes after each chapter.
B0072IVGZG|5.0|Being a big fan of The Cult I've been somewhat disappointed with their output over the last decade and a half, but only in terms of output, not quality.  That's because these guys never fail to deliver great albums, they just don't make enough of them!  Which is why it has come as a total surprise to me that their 2012 album Choice Of Weapon has achieved such dismal sales figures (not many over 20,000 copies sold at time of writing) and has got its fair share of negative on-line reviews as well.  What are people thinking?<br /><br />One thing for sure is that The Cult never make the same album twice.  If you go through their back catalogue you will find that each album sounds quite different to the one that preceded it in terms of style and overall sound.  This can make it a little hard at first to really get into whatever their latest offering is because it's never what you expect, rather it is something you have to listen to a few times to fully appreciate.  But when you do, it's a rewarding experience and means that because they have so many different albums they're a band that you never tire of.<br /><br />In that regard COW can be considered a little different again, because it doesn't fit into the normal pattern of Cult albums as described above.  What we have with this one is an album that combines sounds and styles from throughout their entire career.  At times we hear a little Dreamtime, some elements of Love, a bit of the \\"Goat\\", some stuff that is Beyond Good And Evil, quite a bit of Born Into This, and what is quite pleasing to my ears - a good dose of the Electric era sound and vibe.  When all this is blended in together I don't really think any fan of The Cult could possibly ask for more.  This album rocks!<br /><br />Ian Astbury has again brought his mix of social consciousness and mysticism through in the lyrics, and whilst none of these songs have the soaring choruses that were so enjoyable on Sonic Temple, he sounds as good as ever.  In fact one of the things I quite like about his voice is that at times he sounds quite strained and sometimes a little off key or out of tune.  This is though after all part of the character of his voice that makes him unique and appealing.<br /><br />The production of COW is not as raw as BIT but not as over produced as BGAE and it is the better for it.  They have got it right on the money with this one.  It sounds slick and polished but not too overdone, still retaining the looseness of BIT and a raw vibe that prevails throughout.  Billy Duffy lets loose a bit more on COW in terms of guitar solos than he has on the more recent albums BIT and BGAE.  In fact in several places he cuts loose and rocks out in a way that I haven't heard him do since Electric, and it's very welcome.  When they get going in this sort of vibe is when I think The Cult are at their best and I find them most enjoyable.  Great examples of this are to be found in the songs Honey From A Knife, For The Animals, towards the end of Amnesia, and A Pale Horse which sounds like it could have quite easily fitted on Electric.  In contrast to this are the songs like Life>Death, Wilderness Now and This Night In The City Forever which lean to a more subtle and mellow style but are quite enjoyable nonetheless.  In particular I quite like the Led Zepplin-esque ending of Life>Death.<br /><br />So again I repeat my question: what are people thinking?  To me this is a very high quality & consistent album that has everything that anyone could possibly want from a Cult album.  Superior IMO to BGAE and in some regards better than BIT.  So break out a bandanna (or cowboy hat), bang on that tambourine and stomp your foot because mercy!, this is pure Cult baby!<br /><br />Preferred Tracks: Hmmm... I actually enjoy them all but I suppose my faves are For The Animals, Elemental Light, Honey From A Knife, and A Pale Horse.<br /><br />The disc with the \\"Capsule\\" recordings is a great added bonus with the dig-pack book edition of thisalbum that I have (very nice cover art & packaging I might add too).  In particular I really enjoy the songs Every Man And Woman Is A Star and Siberia.album that I have (very nice cover art & packaging I might add too).

B007J4T2G8|1.0|Where do I begin. I decided to read this book because my sisters, sister-in-law, and basically every other female I know have read it and simply loved it.  I have come to the conclusion they lack a sex life and are living vicariously through this book.<br /><br />I am appalled that so many strong modern women are jumping up and down saying \\"Oh yes me too please!\\" when this entire book is centered on a young women attempting to morph into something she is not for a man. She is both mentally and physically abused by a person who admits he enjoys hurting her. Yes, lets teach our daughters that is what love looks like. It is okay for someone to hurt you in the name of love, and if you love them you will let them do it.<br /><br />The sex... oh my. People just go rent some porn, because lets be honest that is what this is MOMMY PORN! You can cuddle up on the couch with your book and you look all innocent reading this when in reality your brain is conjuring up images of dirty, filthy, porn.<br /><br />So if you read it know you are reading it to live vicariously thought someone else's sex-life, because the story is terrible!

B0087IT8FK|5.0|The Intouchables, a French film written and directed by the team of Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano, is I am moved to say absolutely one of the best films I've seen this year.  It is certainly one of the most enjoyable.  It is not, strictly speaking, a comedy, but it is so rich in humor and in human comedy that I found myself constantly laughing.  While fictional, The Intouchables is closely based on the real-life story of two men so starkly different in background and circumstances that it is difficult to imagine their lives even intersecting, let alone becoming intricately intertwined, and yet they did.  How it all came about is the story.<br /><br />The film begins with Driss (Omar Sy), a young African immigrant, driving a luxurious Maserati sports car at full tilt along the streets of Paris at night.  Riding with him is Phillipe (François Cluzet), an older Frenchman with a beard who seems to be taking his companion's breakneck driving with remarkable calm.  When the police inevitably start after them, Driss bets Phillipe a hundred euros he can shake them off, which Phillipe takes.  When he fails to shake them off, Driss then offers to double the wager that he can turn the police into an escort, to which Phillipe laughingly says he's crazy but accepts the wager anyway. Driss then cons the police into believing that he's speeding because he has to get Phillipe - who can't get out of the car when the police order him to because he's a quadriplegic, paralyzed from the neck down - to the emergency room of a hospital.  Phillipe, in spite of the wager, proceeds to support Driss's con by pretending to be having a stroke.  The police then hurriedly escort the pair to the nearest hospital, where Driss tells them he can handle things from there, and then the police leave.  After having a good laugh at their getting away with it, Phillipe asks \\"What do we do now?\\", to which Driss replies confidently \\"Let me take care of it\\" and they drive off.  The scene sets up the rest of the movie - most of which occurs in flashback - by showing at once how different the two men are and how in spite of their differences they have an intimately playful us-against-the-world relationship that quickly intrigues and engages.<br /><br />Flashing back to when Driss and Phillipe first met, we find Phillipe, a wealthy man who really is paralyzed from the neck down, in his Paris mansion, interviewing candidates with the help of his assistant Magalie (Audrey Fleurot) for a position as live-in caregiver to help with the more basic physical tasks that Phillipe needs but can no longer do for himself.  Candidate after candidate gives all the reasons why they'd be good for the position but Phillipe is clearly dissatisfied with all of them, not surprising when we learn that he's already gone through quite a few caregivers since becoming quadriplegic.  Enter Driss, a brash young man who cuts in ahead of other candidates, not wanting to wait because he's only there to get a paper signed indicating he was interviewed for the job and rejected so that he can qualify for welfare support.  He does everything wrong, openly revealing that he knows nothing about the job or the kind of work it involves and is only there to get his paper signed, even as he flirts outrageously with Magalie.  But at the same time he talks directly to Phillipe and even makes jokes, the only candidate to do so.  Intrigued, Phillipe tricks Driss into coming back, telling him to leave the paper and they will have it ready for him the next day.  When Driss returns, thinking he's only there to pick up his paper, Magalie takes him on a tour of the mansion, showing him in particular the room the caregiver will be living in - an extremely luxurious room bigger than the whole apartment Driss's aunt and four cousins occupy in a seedy Paris suburb- only at the end revealing to him that he's been hired.  Unable to resist the lure of all that luxury - and having nowhere else to go since his aunt kicked himout the night before - Driss decides to take the job.<br /><br />It is comical to watch as Driss settles into his job, showing open astonishment as he realizes the extent of Phillipe's limitations, loudly protesting at some of the duties he's expected to handle, like putting tight stockings on Phillipe's legs to help with their circulation just for openers.  But we quickly see why Phillipe chose him:  Driss is completely uninhibited and utterly without pretense, never holds back what he's thinking, and he interacts with Phillipe like he does with everyone else:  crude and irreverent and disrespectful of boundaries and proprieties, but always as a person.  And because Driss seems to be the only person who can make Phillipe laugh.  I found myself constantly laughing at the humorous moments, but mainly it was in delight at the human comedy unfolding on the screen.<br /><br />There are so many delightful scenes in The Intouchables, a lot of which center around either Driss drawing Phillipe out of his comfort zone or Phillipe drawing Driss out of his.  The first time Phillipe wants to go out for a ride, instead of the van designed to accommodate him and his wheelchair, Driss insists on taking the Maserati Quattroporte he sees instead.  \\"Why would you want to ride around in that,\\" he asks incredulously, dismissing the van, \\"when you have this?\\"  The van never gets used after that.  Later, once Driss has gotten Phillipe to come out of himself more, Phillipe decides to go para-sailing again (it was in fact a para-sailing accident that left him paralyzed). Driss thinks Phillipe is crazy, loudly protesting that there's no way Phillipe is going to get him to try it. And then the next thing we see is Driss para-sailing, screaming in total terror at first but soon laughing and shouting at how incredible the experience is.  And one of the best scenes is at Phillipe's birthday party where the guests listen to a live chamber music group that Phillipe has hired. After most of the guests have gone and the musicians are about to leave, Phillipe impulsively tells them to stay, wanting to expose Driss to a variety of classical music, to which Driss responds, reluctantly at first, but then finally seeming to see what Phillipe gets out of it. Driss then turns around and plugs in his MP3 player, taking the opportunity to show Phillipe the kind of music he likes - Earth, Wind & Fire in particular - and soon he has the party rocking with everyone joining him on the dance floor.<br /><br />In addition to the humor though, there are a lot of serious moments. Both Driss and Phillipe have their troubles.  Driss's relationship with his aunt is rocky because of his irresponsibility and his troubles with the law, and he sees one of his younger cousins is being lured into the gang life.  Phillipe misses his wife, who died of cancer before his accident.  His adopted daughter is a spoiled brat, he has a poetic pen-pal relationship with a women he longs to meet but is afraid to reveal his physical situation to, and he suffers periodically from excruciating phantom pains that he can do nothing about but endure.<br /><br />There is a lot more that I could mention about what happens in the film, but I think it best not to say anything further.  It's simply too much fun to see things unfold as the relationship between Driss and Phillipe develops, both in the humorous moments as well as the more serious ones, so I will leave those pleasures for others to discover.<br /><br />The cast are all very natural and their performances first-class, but François Cluzet's Phillipe and Omar Sy's Driss are truly outstanding in their roles.  Cluzet - who bears a striking resemblance to Dustin Hoffman - in some ways has the more difficult task as he can only use his face to convey everything about Phillipe's character, a particular challenge given Omar Sy's infectious and animated physicality.  But Cluzet does more than hold his own, showing Phillipe's evolution as his expressionsgrow less contained and more open as his relationship with Driss draws him out of himself.  Sy's challenge is more subtle as he must convey Driss's gradual maturing as new worlds and ideas are opened to him, and as he finds himself becoming more responsible, both in his relationship with Phillipe and in his attitude towards his family.  Both actors succeed marvelously, making their characters and the complex relationship the two share completely believable.  I later learned from reading about The Intouchables that Omar Sy appeared in three films that Nakache and Toledano did prior to this one.  Judging by his performance in The Intouchables, it's easy to see why they keep casting him.<br /><br />It would be easy - if one has not actually seen The Intouchables - to dismiss it as just another \\"buddy\\" or \\"odd-couple\\" movie.  That would be a big mistake, because you'd be denying yourself a thoroughly enjoyable experience.  When it was released in late 2011, The Intouchables quickly became the second-biggest grossing film in French movie history.  Internationally, it is the biggest grossing non-English film, beating the record formerly held by Miyazaki's Spirited Away, proof that the appeal of the film and of its truly memorable characters is indeed universal.<br /><br />Highly, highly recommended for everyone.  It may well be the best film you'll see all year.  It will certainly be the one you'll most enjoy having seen.uests have gone and the musicians are about to leave, Phillipe impulsively tells them to stay, wanting to expose Driss to a variety of classical music, to which Driss responds, reluctantly at first, but then finally seeming to see what Phillipe gets out of it. Driss then turns around and plugs in his MP3 player, taking the opportunity to show Phillipe the kind of music he likes - Earth, Wind & Fire in particular - and soon he has the party rocking with everyone joining him on the dance floor.<br /><br />In addition to the humor though, there are a lot of serious moments. Both Driss and Phillipe have their troubles.  Driss's relationship with his aunt is rocky because of his irresponsibility and his troubles with the law, and he sees one of his younger cousins is being lured into the gang life.  Phillipe misses his wife, who died of cancer before his accident.  His adopted daughter is a spoiled brat, he has a poetic pen-pal relationship with a women he longs to meet but is afraid to reveal his physical situation to, and he suffers periodically from excruciating phantom pains that he can do nothing about but endure.<br /><br />There is a lot more that I could mention about what happens in the film, but I think it best not to say anything further.  It's simply too much fun to see things unfold as the relationship between Driss and Phillipe develops, both in the humorous moments as well as the more serious ones, so I will leave those pleasures for others to discover.<br /><br />The cast are all very natural and their performances first-class, but François Cluzet's Phillipe and Omar Sy's Driss are truly outstanding in their roles.  Cluzet - who bears a striking resemblance to Dustin Hoffman - in some ways has the more difficult task as he can only use his face to convey everything about Phillipe's character, a particular challenge given Omar Sy's infectious and animated physicality.  But Cluzet does more than hold his own, showing Phillipe's evolution as his expressionsgrow less contained and more open as his relationship with Driss draws him out of himself.  Sy's challenge is more subtle as he must convey Driss's gradual maturing as new worlds and ideas are opened to him, and as he finds himself becoming more responsible, both in his relationship with Phillipe and in his attitude towards his family.  Both actors succeed marvelously, making their characters and the complex relationship the two share completely believable.  I later learned from reading about The Intouchables that Omar Sy appeared in three films that Nakache and Toledano did prior to this one.  Judging by his performance in The Intouchables, it's easy to see why they keep casting him.<br /><br />It would be easy - if one has not actually seen The Intouchables - to dismiss it as just another \\"buddy\\" or \\"odd-couple\\" movie.  That would be a big mistake, because you'd be denying yourself a thoroughly enjoyable experience.  When it was released in late 2011, The Intouchables quickly became the second-biggest grossing film in French movie history.  Internationally, it is the biggest grossing non-English film, beating the record formerly held by Miyazaki's Spirited Away, proof that the appeal of the film and of its truly memorable characters is indeed universal.<br /><br />Highly, highly recommended for everyone.  It may well be the best film you'll see all year.  It will certainly be the one you'll most enjoy having seen.
1573229725|4.0|I picked up this book almost entirely due to the slew of plot twists that Waters' fans have raved on and on about. I expected to be shocked, taken by surprise, and wholly unable to see where the story would take me.<br /><br />Well, that didn't happen.<br /><br />The only twist that I did not expect was at the end of Part One. From there on out, I found the plot to be very formulaic and conventional. While I turned each page with the desire to suddenly gasp out loud at the new startling events, I found that all of my expectations and guesses came true. It took much of the thrill out of this book.<br /><br />However, that is not to say that I didn't enjoy it. Waters is a thoroughly lovely writer who has managed to create a set of captivating and likable characters. Her use of differing perspectives was delicate and very effective: not many authors could have pulled that off without making the story repetitive. She somehow made it feel natural. It organically presented the reader with new information that allowed us to both question and appreciate the authenticity of both Maud and Sue. Without that small question mark, the end would never have been as satisfying.<br /><br />This is a love story that has managed to move so far beyond the realm of romance. I almost wish that I had a dozen copies so that I could lend them out to friends.

0307279189|5.0|I have been a runner since I was 13. To this day people ask me why I run (especially long distances). Suffice it to say my answers thusfar have been uninspiring. Christopher McDougall has put those words in my mouth with his book and I felt not only vindicated after reading it, but that those who gave me a hard time or just don't understand that the runner's high really exists might get a taste with the stories of Scott, Ted, Caballo Blanco and the Tarahumara. I was compelled to finish the book the day it arrived in the mail. The chapters regarding the science of barefoot running I also found enlightening. Since running cross-country races in high school I always felt that running in our flats was a different, more natural feel and started ditching the clunky NIke and Asics for racers and minimalist shoes. My injuries were held at bay and I haven't had any since. The research regarding barefoot running was more than I could have hoped for to make a case to my fellow runners that minimalist running is the way to go. I have never looked back. I have always revered the life and story of Prefontaine, but this story of bringing the \\"superhuman\\" endurance runners down to our level and showing that we are infinitely more capable than we realize touched me even more; It made me realize why I run!
B007SGM084|4.0|For all those persons checking out this book hoping for a well written erotic romance novel I'd advise you to stop now and check for another book.  If you're open to a not so well written amusing steamy book we can talk.<br /><br />Ok I agree with the people who said it was not well written in the sense that it could have been more professionally written.  So for those people that really go all out critiquing the writers writing style this book will annoy you.  Some of the dialogue was a bit corny but did provide a good laugh.  The plot was fairly good.  The writer captures the classic romance novel theme that many women can only fantasize about. A rich, handsome bachelor who sweeps you off your feet buys you nice things and a happily ever after.<br /><br />I'll admit  I was reluctant to read the books because of the bondage description but it isn't as graphic as you might be thinking. The sex scenes were more steamy than erotic and the bondage quiet tame compared to what you might see in a movie or described in a law and order episode.<br /><br />Why the 4 stars you ask?  This book provided some much needed amusement one quiet, boring weekend.
B002C6A6N6|5.0|Have watched Seasons 1 & 2 so far and am in the process of watching Season 3.  The series is great on DVD.  Did not watch the show on Television.  Enjoy watching the collection in the evenings.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|As the sequel to Fifty Shades of Grey I expected the captivating and thrilling 'what happens next' feeling to diminish, but I found I enjoyed the book even more. Anastasia matured and her niavity and innocence as a result diminished. It propelled the series in a new direction and I wasn't able to set the book down. I greatly enjoyed getting Fifty Shades Darker right along with Ana and Christian.
B008IZ5X5Q|4.0|This was the worst season (8 out of 10), but its still my favorite show. Season 4 is tough to beat (10 out of 10), but I hope they try! I give every other season a 9 out of 10.  Given that they are not shy about killing off anyone, I was nervous about the sacrificial lamb...I'm not a fan at all of Deb coming to a certain \\"realization.\\"  That's creepy and unnecessary, and actually reduces the credibility of the show. I sure hope they change courses or end that subplot.  I cannot wait for Season 7!

B000RD0RDU|5.0|I got three of these to replace the incredibly LOUD fans in some external optical drive housings.  I prefer active cooling on all my housings for both optical and hard Drives, but they don't need an enormous air flow.  Two of my Bytecc housings had fans you could hear half the way across the house.  After replacing with this fan, they are essentially silent, helped by the fact they are in the back of the housing.  I ordered six more to try in several other housings.  The relatively low air flow is fine for this use, but buyers should be aware that may not work for every installation.

B004LWZWGK|4.0|\\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" concludes the Batman trilogy that Christopher Nolan started seven years ago with \\"Batman Begins,\\" an epic installment that builds on its past while providing a cracked lens view of the rising social inequality of the present. It's a testament to Nolan's team that he was able to pull off three superhero movies that are tightly integrated yet excellent films in their own right.<br /><br />\\"Rises\\" takes place eight years after \\"The Dark Knight,\\" with Gotham City in a state of peace under the Dent Act (named after district attorney turned psychopath Harvey Dent/Two-Face). Like the beginning of Frank Miller's seminal work, [[ASIN:1563893428 The Dark Knight Returns]], Batman (Christian Bale) has retired from crime fighting after the death of those closest to him. Like the end of that same graphic novel, Gotham's peace is merely a patch over a festering corruption. On the anniversary of the Dent Act, Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) plans to tell the world the truth: that Batman took the fall for murders committed by Dent and the Joker (nowhere to be seen). When his courage falters, Gordon's investigation into a congressional representative puts him squarely in the path of Bane (Tom Hardy), a guy so villainous he was thrown out of the League of Shadows.<br /><br />I was unhappy with the changes to Bane, who was stripped of his ethnic heritage and his steroid-like Venom. But having seen the movie, I now understand -- the plot requires Bane to be a white guy. He's been transformed into a sort of anti-Batman, second guessing everything Batman does. Less forgivable is his Sean Connery impersonation, a Scottish burr muffled behind a mask that makes Bane sound like a jovial Santa Claus. It's disorienting to say the least, and at times almost indecipherable, particularly in a THX theater where the soundtrack rattles your ribcage.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Wayne Enterprises is in disarray. Having already lost control of the company because Bruce Wayne shelved his weapons division, business rival John Daggett (Ben Mendelsohn) strikes a fatal blow by bankrolling Bane's attack on the Gotham Stock Exchange. Like so many Americans who have lost their wealth, Wayne is now bankrupt as the rest of us.<br /><br />After being badgered into returning to the outside world by father-figure Alfred (Michael Caine), Wayne is torn between two love interests: board member and global do-gooder Miranda Tate (Marion Cotillard, stilted) and jewel thief Selina Kyle (Anne Hathway, better than expected). They are both more than they appear, a duality that shadows every character except Alfred, which becomes an irreconcilable difference between he and Wayne.<br /><br />Batman finally rouses to action to take on Bane, only to discover that his false reputation as a murder causes more harm than good, just like it did when the Joker framed Batman for his own murder in The Dark Knight Returns. When Bane's plan goes into full swing, the plot diverges into two story lines: the breaking of Batman's city ([[ASIN:0671774557 No Man's Land]]) and his body ([[ASIN:0760754381 Knightfall]]).<br /><br />What ensues is an all out war that veers from the unbelievable to comic book levels of audaciousness. Nolan's grim and gritty take on the universe doesn't always make sense (3,000 cops for millions of citizens and enough food ferried in to feed them all?), but it makes up for it with spectacle and the chilling parallels to American society today.<br /><br />That's what makes \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" so good. A villain rises from the Lazarus Pit. The police rise from the ruins of Gotham. Batman rises from the wreckage of his ruined body. Wayne Enterprises rises from fiscal ruin. And, Nolan warns, if we don't do something about social injustice in America, the people will rise too.his weapons division, business rival John Daggett (Ben Mendelsohn) strikes a fatal blow by bankrolling Bane's attack on the Gotham Stock Exchange.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|just got this a few days ago and already several levels in. it starts out pretty easy and then starts getting more and more complex. fun brain challenges but a relaxing activity as well. love playing on my kindle. it's large enough both my spouse and I can play together.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|when I first saw this game in the app store I thought it looked stupid and boring then my friend got it and I became addicted to it!
034580404X|5.0|One of my good friends told me about this trilogy and I had to have it. Once it arrived at my door, I couldn't put the 1st book down. Once I was finished with the 1st book, I quickly moved on to the 2nd and 3rd. This was a great twisted love story and I am so glad it worked out in the end. Right now, I am going through withdrawals from this series. I want more of Christian and Ana. I will definitely wait for more books on Mr. Fifty Shades. Great read!!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this app is so amazing and so addicting! I started playing it and couldn't stop. this app will challenge u and make u think hard
B004UID2LC|5.0|this app works fine for me although I have a kindle fire...soooo...yeah it works incredibly great ..I suggest it a bunch
1451629192|4.0|This is a book you have to read to understand what this child went through. It really makes you take a look around and wonder everytime you walk out the door. You can't help but feel so sorry and so proud of this young lady after all she went though. A very good read!
1469984202|5.0|A close friend recommended this book on her blog, and that's the only reason I downloaded it. So glad I did! I love non-techy sci-fi. Howey created a dystopian world I could understand without feeling like I needed to go back to school. I enjoyed how the idea of the skills needed to be good in Mechanical are carried through everything that the main character does. Great characters and a plot that keeps ripping along.<br /><br />More, please, Mr. Howey!

B008JMKN4Y|4.0|Wow...I love it when I come across a book that surprises me in a good way!<br /><br />When I began reading this book, it conjured up feelings I thought I had long forgotten. I can honestly say I can relate to this couple. I've been so deeply in love that it hurt and it changed me in ways that made me grow and learn from my mistakes. And the journey this couple takes together is about growing up, learning from mistakes, and loving someone so much that you can't live without them even if you have go through hell to be happy.<br /><br />Abby's past has caused her to leave her home to attend college in another state at Eastern University. She's trying to start over fresh and live a mundane life compared to the one she left behind until she meets Travis Maddox. Travis is everything Abby is trying to avoid. I can't help but love Travis and all his flaws. Travis is your typical bad-boy. He has every quality that most young girls are attracted to...tattoos, gorgeous, rides a motorcycle, and fights in illegal underground boxing matches. He has never been in love or been in a relationship before. His reputation is known for having sex and discarding the girls when he's done. So, when Travis meets Abby, he has met the one girl who can bring him to his knees.<br /><br />Beautiful Disaster is exactly that. It's beautiful when it's good and a when it's bad, it's a disaster. This book took me on an emotional journey that made me feel angry, frustrated, annoyed, and happy. I felt frustrated with Abby's wishy-washy decisions on whether she wanted to be with Travis or not. I felt frustrated with Travis' jealous outbursts and over-protectiveness. I felt angry when Abby left Travis without communicating with him first. I felt annoyed with Travis begging for Abby back and Abby stringing Travis along. But what's crazy, I felt hypocritical when I felt happy when this couple would make up because their happiness made me happy. This couple is a train wreck but that's what made this story sointoxicating. I found myself addicted to finding out how Travis and Abby will work out their next issue. The ending, though, was a bit unrealistic but this is fiction and I read romance for HEA's, therefore, I could live with the ending.<br /><br />If you like lots of drama and highly flawed characters, read this book! I'm so glad I found it and wish I had read it sooner.
B006DHAT5K|4.0|Perky Anna Faris has some serious comedic chops.  Whether it's physical, slapstick comedy or witty dialogue or even obscenity-laced party girl rogue, Faris makes all of it look easy (and easy on the eye).  And the rom-com WHAT'S YOUR NUMBER? is the perfect vehicle for Faris's many talents, as she plays slightly wild child Ally Darling, an unlucky-at-love free spirit who--with her baby sister's approaching nuptials--starts to feel that biological clock ticking, and decides it's time to get serious about finding Mr. Right; yet at the same time, concerned that her 20 prior bedroom partners might make her appear unseemly to a \\"decent\\" man, decides she'll look up the 20 former boyfriends to see if she's already met Mr. Right, and fall in love with him all over again.  For assistance, she enlists the aid of her neighbor Colin (a mega-buffed Chris Evans), an unemployed womanizer who always makes himself at home in Ally's apartment while he waits for the latest one-night-stand lady to awaken and leave his apartment.  Colin and Ally are platonic pals (or are they?) who enjoy hanging out together--from playing strip horse at Boston Garden to skinny dipping in Boston Harbor--yet every viewer happily watching these two knows exactly where this platonic friendship is going.<br /><br />Faris and Evans have tremendous chemistry and the same level of (almost furious) energy.  They look like they had grand fun making WHAT'S YOUR NUMBER?, and it shows, and definitely pays off.  The supporting cast is solid, including the beautiful Ari Graynor as Ally's sister Daisy, a stoic Blythe Danner as Ally and Daisy's doting mother, Ed Begley Jr. as Ally and Daisy's free-spirited father, and a host of actors comprising the former beaus.  (By far the biggest hoot from moi came during the rendezvous with the former beau practicing gynecology.)  Charming, engaging, and clever, yet predictable as ever, WHAT'S YOUR NUMBER? is a fabulously fun adult romp.  No doubt Faris would be deliciously glorious to party with!<br />--D. Mikels, Esq.to party with!<br />--D. Mikels, Esq.
0307949508|3.0|This book stars off with a bang and the reader is forced to keep reading until you reach the middle where more characters, detectives, suspects, villains, double identities are thrown in, there is a scamper here and there. Is there a suspense worth unwielding? I won't say. But towards the second half of the book the intensity is somewhere lost because it seems like the characters that are running after the truth are to busy playing games with each other.<br /><br />The author writes only better than he did in the first book but I thought the first one had a better plot. The second one ends on a pause of sorts. I wonder if they will answer these questions in the third book. For the first half of this book alone, I would implore you to ignore me and read it.<br /><br />In Dragon, there was a collective search.<br />In Fire, there is a search my many different parties for the truth and you always wonder about the why's and the now what's. There is to much happening in this book to maintain a steady story.<br /><br />Was this as good as Dragon Tattoo? Not in my opinion.<br />Do I recommend it? Certainly.
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|I will try to be brief and without spoilers:<br />Prometheus is a truly great film, and responsibly presented.  It does have scares and vicerally challenging images.  There is also some fine acting (especially from Rapace and Fassbender).<br />The (senseless) criticism of the story presented here can be summed up as follows:<br />1. I don't understand what was happening in ___ scene.<br />2. They didn't explain why ___ did ___.<br />3. I wouldn't have done ___.<br />4. This doesn't remind me enough of the Cameron movie \\"Aliens\\".<br />Folks that don't want a visually splendid movie that is highly provocative (yet accessible) should stay away from this film (and most films by Scott, Altman, etc.).  There are plenty of decent, non-challenging movies out there for you... please let the rest of us have a mature Sci Fi experience without all the prattering.  With all due respect.

It deals with a near death experience and that is what I was faced with . I was riding my bicycle and was hit head on by a pick-up truck . Amazingly , I survived with broken ribs and 13 staples in my head .<br /><br />This is a beautiful album and I just can't say enough about it . Lush vocals , great musicianship and great subject matter which was a little too close to home for me .<br /><br />At this point in my life , I simply must listen to this every day to survive and carry on .
0802136834|2.0|Alison Weir has written more than a couple of books centered on Tudor history, and I will admit, this is the first of her books I've read.  It will be the last.  Though I have been an avid reader all my life, I have just discovered how impartiality can ruin an otherwise good read and cause you to quit a book entirely.  Such is the case with the \\"Six Wives of Henry VIII.\\"  It is so terribly biased against Anne Boleyn, you might imagine that a reincarnated Katherine of Aragon has written it.  The author is sly in her approach, peppering the type with slanderous, and often, downright false accusations (Anne did not have an extra finger) against the historically misunderstood Anne Boleyn.<br /><br />At first, I gave Ms. Weir the benefit of the doubt, thinking that ample research was not completed, but the attention to detail regarding Katherine of Aragon's life is amazing.  Details of Henry's and Anne's relationship was horribly lacking, and whenever Anne Boleyn is mentioned in this book, disparagement always follows.  Sadly, Anne Boleyn is not given recognition as being Henry VIII's greatest love.  Nor is she given credit for her strength and determination in an impossibly awful situation.  Lastly, she is not given the credit due her as a catalyst for the reform of the English church and, to go so far, a mother and martyr for Anglo Protestantism.  Perhaps Ms. Weir is Catholic.<br /><br />Like many of you, \\"The Tudors\\" recently sparked or rekindled a romance for Henry VIII and the Tudor period, and like many others, I was hungry for more information about the enigmatic Anne Boleyn, a woman that many have come to understand and relate to (several websites are devoted to her).  Don't look in this book for that information.  I wish I could point you elsewhere for a \\"complete\\" guide to all of Henry's women, but sadly, you may have to expand your knowledge with individual biographies.  Even more sad, the discourse on Anne Boleyn leaves you wondering what else you can and cannot trust in this book.
0525478817|5.0|A close friend of mine got a signed copy for her birthday and when she showed me the book I SCREAMED.<br />I have read all of John Green's books and there are just no words to describe the awesomeness that has been distilled into this book. John made me go through a rollercoaster of emotions and as a young adult who lost her dad from cancer, it gave me a sort of closure that I needed. I stray away from reading novels involving teenagers falling in love but John Green's works delve deeper than other young adult fiction books. This book definitely deserves a place on my collection of books that needs to be passed down to my children.<br /><br />John and Hank Green, you give me hope :')<br />DFTBA
030758836X|5.0|My first reading of this author and I am hooked  I could not put this book down.  It is so well written both from a literary point of view and as  psychological .

The book has many areas of using your subconscious to achieve what you want, whether it is health, wealth, confidence etec. I read it all the time to remind me that I am in control and have to ability to get to where I need to be.
0307388921|5.0|This is my third Palahniuk novel. I preferred it to Invisible Monsters, which was good, but it didn't speak to me like Choke did. My favorite Palahniuk novel thus far is Survivor, which was amazing! Choke takes you into the life of Victor, scam artist/sex addict/colonial American theme park tour guide/messiah. Victor nails any chick that moves, scams money to pay for his mother's nursing home, gets drunk off of beer found in neighbors' slug traps, and pals around with another sex addict named Denny (awesome character). Dude... it's good, just read it!
0553801473|2.0|Minor spoilers ahead...<br />I feel really mad about this book. After spent a month reading this long dreadful new installment, I realized nothing significant has being put into it. Some say this one is about world building, well, aside from all the meaningless exotic names I have to put through, I don't see much of the word building per se.<br />Slaves or freeman makes no matter, Meereen or Yunkai I'm just not interested. Jon basically recruiting wildlings the whole book, which can be said in full in one chapter. Dany's chapters are filled with dreams and courts and tokars, all of which took all the wasted words that I'm painful to go through. Stannis waited, brooded, and waited then booded a little longer, just to be able to enjoy the storm and snow in stead of starting the attack to Winterfell. As to Victarion, his chapters are completely fillers which you don't even have to read because his purpose is all being said in book four, and all he is doing is sailing, sailing, rob some ships and then sailing some more. Tyrion's doing with this dwarf girl can be truly called nothing but a mummer's farce.<br />There are some nice moments but only probably acounts for one fifth of the whole book, the rest are all fillers and wasted time and money. I hate to acknowledge this since I'm a huge fan of the first four books(yes including AFFC), but this one only deserves a 2 star and I am being merciful here. GRRM is not being sincere, and I feel like being cheated immensely.

B008K8H9C6|5.0|this game is great it makes u think and brings puzzle solveing action I give it 5 stars its awesome thanks rovio
0345803507|5.0|I could not put these books down!!! I read all 3 of them in 4 days... I would and have recommended them to everyone.. These books were exciting, tearful, happy and sad.. Might want to have a box of tissues when reading them.. Loved them can't wait until E.L. James writes more !!!
B003R4ZMJU|5.0|I love this show I am so addicted to it, if you love mystery and drama this is the show for you! I am totally buying the other seasons !!!!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|swords arrows zombies and magic always a fun mixture waiting for the apocalypse to happen zombies aliens etc have fun with it :)<br />keep on killing<br />no one is safe<br />become the chosen one.<br />arm up and get ready haha<br />we all are going to die!!!<br />just kidding.
B006MHWXMS|5.0|Even though there is still room for improvement I'm giving this a 5 star rating because it's the best I have found. It strikes a very good balance between power and simplicity. Voice notes with speech to text are incredibly accurate. Easy access to multiple lists. I have 3 items on my wish list. An option for repeating tasks - daily, weekly, or monthly. Better support for outline style nested items. A few options on color for teens or skins. I tried 10 yr 12 the highest rated task and to do apps and this one stands head and shoulders above the rest. I find it to be very useful and highly functional.
B002ZG993Q|1.0|Boring and pointless. . .<br /><br />This is not a thriller, or a character study. It's slow and boring and should not have been made into a full-length movie.
B006CDCWDM|5.0|In depth anaylsis of what all is involved in becoming a champion.  How much do you want to be a top athelete and keep your feet on the ground when you become famous?
B0041T52S6|1.0|J for \\"juvenile\\". . .<br /><br />I did not find it entertaining but then i am not a pubescent any longer. I agree with the reviewer who said that this can be used by the police to torture uncooperative criminals.
B00170MYIS|1.0|Purchased this with charger for camera. We can't tell yet which item doesn't work, but the battery won't hold a charge. It could be the charger is unable to charge the battery, or it could be the battery is unable to hold a charge. Either way we are thoroughly disappointed.
B0034G4P80|5.0|Yes, Thor is a Marvel superhero, and this movie is based on the comic books. But before Stan Lee introduced him as part of his Marvel line-up, he was a mythological character. This movie effectively fits into the sword and sorcery genre -- I would consider it this more so than a typical superhero movie.<br /><br />This movie features Oscar winners Anthony Hopkins and Natalie Portman, but to me the strength of the acting was carried by Chris Hemsworth whose character grew from hothead to a real leader while keeping likable throughout, and also Tim Hiddleston who was excellent as Loki. Stellan Skarsgard, Ray Stevenson, Joshua Dalla, Jamie Alexander, and Darcy Lewis all were excellent in their supporting roles.<br /><br />The only drawback -- I believe this movie and Captain America came out to create interest in the Avengers movie that came out this year. Hawkeye the archer makes a brief appearance that I believe was not really necessary for this movie, but very helpful in giving him an introduction for his role in the Avengers. However, does this mean it's a bad movie? Not at all. It still is great entertainment.<br /><br />One final note -- if you look at the scenes, you'll notice the ending credits is the next to the last one. Huh? Yes, there's a final scene following the credits.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|It's an awesome app everyone will love it. Tell all your friends now! I tried it 5 days ago and already love it.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|easy to play. takes some time to master. can't complain about the price either. apparently I have to keep writing.
B0009353IW|5.0|This is a brilliantly crafted and produced album. And as concept albums go its up there with dark side of the moon and joes garage. I have no real concept of the SoCal Latino lifestyle or the Red Scare but when I listen to this album ive been there man. 3rd base. Dodger Stadium.
0345803485|4.0|There are already a lot of reviews for this book.  I'm sure no one will ever see this one.  But if someone does click it, I'll do my best not to sound like everybody else.  All of the criticism I heard about this book is correct.  The author uses the word blush or flush too much.  And the characters are always mumbling or muttering, never just talking.  And this book does steal from the basic premise of Twilight, you know, with an insecure, clumsy girl who thinks she's not pretty who gets with a hot, godly hot guy who thinks she's the best thing ever.  But even with all of that, this is still a good book.  The story is intriguing, the sex scenes are hot, and there is a lot of suspense.  I think this book is definitely worth reading, and I don't understand why it has so many one star reviews.
B005K17RU0|5.0|great app would recommend. to everyone over any other weather app. updates on own and much more accurate then weather channel go get it now
1419702238|5.0|I got this for my god son and he finished it in less then a few hours. He loves this series and thinks it is the funniest thing in the world when he reads them. He enjoys them so much he made me pick it up and read it and I must say it is better then I thought.
B00005RHF8|1.0|I agree with the other reviews - the quality is poor and scenes are missing.  My VHS copy that I taped from TV is better than this version.
B004JN1D2I|4.0|For the amount of reading contained in this set, it is a fantastic deal. I would recommend this set to anyone who wants to enjoy a great series of books for a low price.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love this app. I can take notes across 3 pcs, one android phone and one iPad. They sync seamlessly and I can find them all later by searching for whatever I can remember. I highly recommend it.
B0081SRJSY|3.0|This would be so much better with online multiplayer. the game itself is fine, but local multiplayer is just kinda lame.
B004L0NGEC|4.0|Upadated review:  I had initially rated this app with only one star because of some difficulties I was having getting it to download to my device.  Those issues have now been resolved and I am pleased with my purchase.  I needed a way to view and, occasionally,  download photos on Picasa and PicFolio does what I need it to do.  I can now access my photos from all of my devices.  I guess it would be nice to be able to post directly to Facebook/Twitter rather than having to use the special upload email addresses but this isn't an issue for me.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|so repetitive that i struggled toreach the end. if i read 'holy cow' 'my inner goddess' etc one more time i will need restraints!
0765316994|2.0|When I heard about this book, I was excited. However, after reading it, I feel like the ball was dropped. The plot resolved way too quickly and the final conclusion was not all that original. Felt like satire against sci-fi tv shows, not an original sci-fi adventure.
B004WMKSH2|5.0|Please! I bought all the other harry potter movies a while back on a god box deal and all i need is this one!<br />I want my collection complete!!!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I find my mind working out connections even when I'm not playing it. Simple and satisfying. Easy to pick up and fun for perfectionists.
140053271X|5.0|Really cool and workable!!! if you want to Read the books it is the coolest thing ever and also there are some other ways to make it more cooler.(if you know what i mean. android :P)
B007VTVGAQ|1.0|Listening to this cd left me with two thoughts. One, I want my money back. And two, Phoebe on Friends sounded better singing \\"Smelly Cat\\".
B0085KGHI6|5.0|Keith Richards describes in his fabulous autobiography that the Stones grumbled about playing rock and roll when their real goal was to be the best blues band in London (they certainly hit that mark) but this wonderful DVD/CD record the formal passing of the torch between generations.  The Stones are like kids who found a pony under the tree at christmas and Muddy smiles with the pride of a grandfather.<br /><br />There seems to be some controversy about Left Dizz's performance and at first it also put me off until I realized that the Stones (and by extension us) are getting a peek at real blues (and jazz) where cutting contests are a key part of the jam culture.  These were an essential late night rites of passage where various players display their skills and showmanship to oneup the others on stage.  This isn't a genteel \\"after you sir\\" but a macho competition that Buddy Guy describes as the blues world in Chicago at the time.  Dizz may well be dead drunk but he can sure play a hell of a guitar and it was in rough and tumble competitions like this that many players developed the techniques that later blew us all away.<br /><br />The Stones wanted the real blues.  They got it and so did we.
B007PBKG5G|5.0|New to Amazon, Alabama Shakes. Giant, soulful, romantic, robust sound that makes me want to move. I've heard many say the female vocalist sounds like the late Janice Joplin, but trust me she has her own unique sound that stands alone. I'm telling you they will not be a one hit wonder.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I bought the download version for my Android, had it in just minutes or less.  Easy to read doesn't use up much battery power, hard to put down.  It's so great to download books, no trouble to store, had to get a new phone and once it was up and running my books where there waiting for me. Love it!
B0002VFXFE|5.0|I will start by saying this stuff really works. Replaced factory compound on both my CPU and GPU, and the temp difference was noticeable instantly, fans are running quieter now. Great price for a small tube that will do the job 30~ times, it's easy to use but make sure you know what you are doing!
B008KRJWEK|1.0|I played like two times and then it just stopped working I was waiting for it to load I kept trying and nothing happens
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is awesome cool and really fun! I was looking for a fun game and got this.its really challenging and fun:)
B000ID37KO|5.0|This is one of the best of Alfred Hitchcock's works. As a Hitchcock fan I have seen 90 percent of what he has done, including the early stuff and this is a solid classic by the Master of Suspense...
B006MW3V6U|5.0|See this series!!!! Wonderful film treat. Superbly casted and created. I look forward to Season 3 coming out in January 2013!!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|great distraction had a friend issue and this did a great job of distracting me from the complications and stress. I love this game because its so soothing
034580404X|5.0|Bought this for my wife. She loves it. She read all three books on a recent trip to Europe almost in one sitting.
B0086700CM|5.0|most amazing game I have ever played in my entire life which is pretty long since I was born on July 29 1912 . great for people of all ages, especially if your nearing your one hundredth birthday
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app for my kindle fire. I appreciate. being able to download various versions to my kindle to have available when I am without wifi.
B007JMW46U|4.0|I am only half way through having read 6 chapters (out of 12) as of present and just have to say these are great / fun intriguing tales with Dr. Watson being the main narrative.  I have the Kindle version and so far really nice job with the character illustrations accompanying the story lines in each separate chapter a tale in itself. Really enjoyable and fun reading.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I read the other reviews that called this app addicting, and it most definitely is. The puzzles start out nice and easy and get progressively more difficult. They're not impossible, but you do have to think about it. I personally love it!!!
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I Love David Baldacci and he didn't disappoint me with this one.  He has a way of \\"grabbing\\" you right from the start and continuing to the finsih.
B00631VJIC|5.0|This CD was great.  In following the songs we remembered which scene each of them went to.  It was great.  Kind of like watching the series in your head along with listening to the music while driving down the road. GREAT!!!!!
B007IXWKUK|3.0|If you buy this book, you know what you're in for.  It fun and basically the same as the first one.  Not worth slamming, because it is what it is.  Enjoy it or don't. Oh myyyyyyyyy....
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is an amazing game I could play it all day!!!! I would definitely reccomend this game for kids and adults!
B006RUJST6|2.0|If I were 18, I am sure I would love this book, but I have \\"been there done that\\" and this is just pretty silly.  Making a year seem like a lifetime seems so silly to me.  I don't think 18 year olds see 1 year (or 10 months) in such simplistic terms.  Maybe I was just more long-term in my thinking.
B0086700CM|3.0|I love this app. I have it on my opossum and its great! but on the kindle fire... its kinda slow and glitchy... :p it make the timing on some turns and jumps off... please fix? I know this app is capable of earning 5/5 stars :)
B0052VUNHC|3.0|I liked it.  Take it for what it is.  More realistic characters than some other YA books I've read.  I think I'm done with this genre, though.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is an awesome app. to use on a daily basis!  It is easy to search and find without a bunch of confusion and I wish some of my other app's where as easy to use.
0375842209|2.0|People love this, but I can't say that I do.  It was eh.  Fine.  Didn't blow me out of my shoes.  I honestly don't get the hype.  Different strokes for different folks.  :)
B00785P2QC|4.0|fun to play and can be addictive at times. good way to pass time if bored. reminds me of Sims city
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I needed music to relax and meditate and this app is my answer. I cant believe its free. I love it, and yes get this app!
B0063GORYU|5.0|This ap is fun and has no glitches.  Easy to understand.  Enjoyable.  I completely recommend this ap for anyone. who enjoys card games.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I enjoyed these books very much.  There was lots of salacious sex, but I thought it had a good underlying story.  It was well written, and I am reading the three books now for the second time.
B001OGWY1W|5.0|Good refresher for the final in the trilogy and probably the best antagonist since Arnold Schwartznegger and the Terminator !
B0038JN6VA|1.0|IT WORK FOR A WEEK AND THE PLAY BACK SONGS STARING NOT TO WORK NOW LOW VOLUME DOES'T WORK EITHER
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I downloaded this on a whim, and now I wish I had a version without stupid advertisements scrolling along. The game is a lot of fun, for me and my 8 year old son.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love this game, passes time by and some of the games are a little challenging so you don't beat it in 5 mins. haven't had the problem of upgrading yet but will take everyones advice about that issue.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this is a fun game just wish energy regained faster other than that its a pretty good game to play when your board
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Good read. Kept my interest. Although, sex was repettative.  Liked the hang left for book 2!  Must say, it is a great summer read
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is the best game on the kindle fire. I absolutely love it. you have to get this app. THE BEST GAME EVER!
B005K17RU0|5.0|Good app, does  what it says.  Absolutely no problems with it on the Kindle Fire.  Recommended it to all my friends who own a Kindle also.
0756404738|5.0|This book was listed as only \\"good\\" condition, but it's in the best condition I've ever seen. The dust cover has another cover for goodness sake. It smells like a brand new book, the pages are milky white and smooth... its beautiful. Sorry to nerd out so hard, but this book was worth it.
B007PEIHKE|3.0|One port works, one thinks it's \\"off hook\\" most of the time even with nothing connected. This port also has a high-pitched tone that's loud enough to be unacceptable (occasionally reported on other models also).  The working port works well with good sound quality and no issues.  Firmware upgraded to latest.<br /><br />NO response from customer service after opening a trouble ticket.  Probably will return to Amazon for replacement and give it another try.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love it!!! its sooo amazing I wish I would have found it sooner like the baby anamials are so cute......I just love the game overall
0345803485|5.0|Loved all three books! Can't wait for the movie! I am leaning towards Ryan Gosling as Christian Gray :)Read Bared to You after and enjoyed it also.
B0018QQQK8|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. Never wanted to put it down. I really enjoyed to ending compared to some of Sparks' other novels.
0425263908|5.0|I loved this book...I just finished reading 50 shades so I still needed more...this book kept me very interested and still wanting more. I can't wait until the next one.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I really love this calculator because I can back space. and I can check what I've done on the memory.  I also love it because it displays all of what you are doing instead if just one number at a time.
B006RUJST6|4.0|This book was great.  It grabs you from the first chapter and you must keep turning pages to see what happens.  I am not a poetry lover but I loved the way the book was written!!  Very easy read and started on Point of Retreat the next day!  Great book and well worth the money!
0812550757|2.0|The first 100 pages of the book are on the fringe of falling out. The glue holding them to the spine of the book was not strong enough apparently. Still a great book though that everyone should buy
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is excellent I have it on my iphone and Kindle Fire. I love being able to have the word availible at all times.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|:) its pretty sweet. kinda boring at times but if you keep at it it gets better. visit others to find scratch and your money grows
B004I744AS|5.0|This app is really useful, it's great for looking up words without a cluttered screen. It also is great at zooming in and out so you can see better. :)
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a really really really cool game. there are a whole bunch of games to enjoy so your never bored.
B007G51UV0|5.0|I decided to upgrade my PC with a new motherboard, CPU and memory. After considerable research I selected the Asus P8Z77-V Pro, the Intel I5-3570K, the Thermaltake Water2.0 cooler, and 8GB of Corsair Vengeance 1600 memory. I kept my old case and my 120 GB OCZ Vertex 3 solid state drive. Everything went together with no problems. I am very happy with the simple overclocking capabilities of this board. Everything works and I couldn't be happier.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I knew right from the beginning I would love this book John Green has done it agin. I love the story, I love the writing, and i love the characters!!!!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|The product was bought for my son. He enjoyed the movies on Blue-ray DVD. The service was efficient and the product was in excellent condition. The price was the best!
0385737955|5.0|I got into this reading kick after reading The Hunger Games.  This trilogy is little strange.  So if your are looking for something serious, stop now.  My Grandson was in The Hunger Games.  After I read these books I mentioned them to my daughter.  She said Josh had been approached for this trilogy but turned it down because it was too close to THG.  I was actually sad when I finished reading the third book because it had to end.  I wanted it to keep going.  It's great for mid teens on up.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Much cheaper then the previous app I was using and much easier to set up. I would recommend this to anyone that doesn't want to monkey with port forwarding.
B0064BWE8U|4.0|A lovely, light-hearted read which has everything you want in a classic chick lit: a heroine you want to be friends with, some cute love interests, a bit of drama and a slightly-ridiculous-yet-believable plot to keep you turning the pages. I found it easy to get into and a real page-turner. Lots of fun!
B001V9LPWQ|1.0|Buyers be aware, this  format of DVD does not fit to your HDTV (with black bar on the sides).Instead, this is for the old TV built 10 years ago. So do not expect good viewing experiences.
B005LAIGRS|2.0|item recieved in timely manner.<br />for some reasson it would not play on two dvd players.<br />it did however work on my portable dvd player<br />good movie, lots of action
057809665X|5.0|My day job involves dealing with large numbers of people who are both hostile and friendlies.  This book definitely offered me some techniques and tunings for my face-time interactions I'm already seeing benefits from.  Quick, easy read that can yield benefits for you in your day to day interactions.  I work in high-tech and not the secret world Robin Dreeke comes from, yet the interaction principles play out regardless.  If you don't read the book, you may never know what you're missing.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Anastasia a soon to be graduates sets out to do a friend a favor, interview enigmatic entrepreneur Christian Grey. Their meeting is mediocre; uncomfortable questions \\"are you gay\\", cold glances from the reclusive young billionaire and the bumbling and stumbling of a young woman uncomfortable with herself, but Grey see's something in Ana and proceeds to pursue (i.e. stalk). Okay, here is where is fell apart for me; actually, it fell apart for me with in the first few pages, the POV narration comes through completely British to me, I like British, but she is supposed to be American and her vernacular (she grew up middle class most of use cabinets, not cupboards) is slightly unbelievable. So is the idea that this is a twenty something, her observations are to mature, though she is portrayed as being naïve and inexperienced. Part of this POV from the character is her inner thoughts neurosis that are constantly proving her discomfort with herself; we all have them, but to read someone else's blubberingly self-effacing inner voice becomes boring after a while. What does she see in Christian other than that he is a young, attractive, billionaire? Is it a control thing? Personally I found how bossy he is in the beginning alarming, his comments about strapping her seat belt on were disturbing; alarm bells should have been ringing, even for someone as `innocent' as her. Too vanilla; the one and only brown person tries to forcibly seduce the skinny, pretty, ultra-neurotic, adorably klutzy Caucasian girl. She is of course saved by a white knight who then skips then leap frogs from unnerving stalker to crush and first lover (Start mailing packages to her house, trace her cell, track them down, and meet them unbidden? yes, its stalking).    Honestly, I found the whole thing ridiculously average and contrived;  I've been stalked it's not sexy. And, I've dated controlling men before as well, also not sexy; especially when they break out `gear'. And, author's out there please listen; retire the adorable klutz, WE GET IT! Seriously!    please visit me BookDevour.blogspot.com  for more of my reads and opinions
B008MEM24S|4.0|Its fun and challanging its worth 99. but if you have to chose between the regular where's my water  and peery one i'd chose regular.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|The strength of this book is the writing quality (some truly beautiful prose), the first-third person point of view shifting, and the main character Kvothe.<br /><br />The weakest part of this book is the plot and subcharacters (especially the love interest). Kvothe has two main friends, but honestly they are so underdeveloped/undesribed that I often get them mixed up. There is not really much happening besides the whole smart boy meets tragedy and goes to wizard school. Still it is so well told, with such a strong main character, that even with a weak plot it is easily a five star novel.<br /><br />I am writing this review after reading book 2, The Wise Man's Fear, which is simply not as good. It is still written very well, and had many interesting stories, though there is even less plot development than book 1, which did not have a great deal itself. Book 2 is a four star book, but still worth reading, so if you liked the Name of the Wind (especially for its writing quality and main character), I would recommend picking it up.
B007MDQW3W|5.0|\\"The View From The Cheap Seats\\" is an excellent CD. It's hard to define what Regina does, but everyone I've played this CD for has loved it. The music is sparse, piano driven pop, sometimes folk, sometime cabaret, but whatever the genre every song is a gem. Lyrically,the disc will alternately tug at your heart strings or make you think about the unusual subjects she's chosen. All in all, everyone can love this CD.
B0042J6VUS|1.0|Does not work, my phone will not fit in the mount and the mechanism to hold the device in place firmly is not functional.
0345803485|1.0|I have never written a review on something I did NOT purchase from Amazon but in this case, my lesson learned may help some other poor person stop, put the book down at the register, or stop typing up your Amazon order for this book or.... horrors!... the entire set!<br />I had heard about 50 Shades of Grey about 2 months ago while out shopping. A woman was desperately looking for not just the first book, but all three so she could have the set to read without interruption. She was quite intent and the store staff said though they just couldn't keep it in stock it was her lucky day. A shipment had just arrived. The woman looked so happy when they handed her that set I asked her what it was all about. She said, \\"I don't actually know but all my friends are talking about these and most of them don't usually have time to read books.\\"  That was interesting. \\"But what are they about?\\" I had to explore just a little further. I might have even bit my lip thinking about it. She said, \\"I think they are like romance or something like that but a little racy.\\" This was intriguing... lots of books are \\"a little racy\\" but that alone isn't enough to get people to buy novels anymore.<br />I normally buy all my books through Amazon. It's easy, affordable, and with the review section I can often narrow many possible selections down to a few if I'm researching a particular area or just want to check a trend. How I wish I had shopped on Amazon! I don't think I would have wasted my money on 50 Shades of Grey let alone the entire set. This is my just reward for being impulsive at the bookstore.<br />Romance novels have never been appealing to me because the few I flipped through over the years seemed as though they might have been written by the same person about the same people... just change the clothes, the era, the names and you have a new/same romance of the day.  The Grey trilogy was found in the romance section... and that was my first warning.<br />Still, I was eager to experience for myself what everyone was talking about- references to it all over Facebook and emails from friends, who should play Christian Grey in the inevitable movie, how it was sold out at the stores, did anyone have them to loan out, etc. And I bought the set on impulse because it was there.<br />About 40 pages in I was already starting to get uncomfortable. How many times could you write about blushing or flushing? Or biting one's lip? Or about some guy running his hands through his hair?  100 pages in I wanted to magically erase every mention of blushing from the rest of the book(s) along with any reference to Ana biting her lip. And if she said, \\"Oh crap!\\" or any variation of it again I thought I just might scream.<br />Even the eventual erotica became silly. Yes, I've read erotica that was very well-written but this doesn't fall into that category. I've also read books based on dominant/submissive dynamics in relationships and halfway through the first book I was ready to edit the rest for myself just to make it readable!<br />If Christian Grey had been a true top, he would have made Ana come to him after the first request. But no... he chases her around with text (yes, text) messages and emails. How very... adolescent.  Like others who have already left reviews, I had to stop reading to investigate who had written the book to see if in fact it HAD been written by a teenager. All the indicators were there... Ana was a virgin, Christian is smitten by her during an interview (gulp) for a college newspaper, the constant blushing, inability to eat, the Converse sneakers, the hair ties, \\"Oh crap!\\" statements, and of course Grey is a gazillionaire who just KNOWS her size and buys her a new Mac, flies her around in a helicopter he pilots, and holds her hair back while she pukes in a flower bed. Yeah, right. Keep wishing.<br />If you are looking for quality writing you will not find it in this trilogy. If you are looking for a more realistic blueprint for a dominant/submissive relationship look elsewhere- even this effort is laughable. I rarely criticize someone else's efforts to write but in this case I can definitively say I could have edited this series and I guarantee it would have been at least 10 times more enjoyable.  If you want hot, edgy erotica with distinct dominant/submissive themes, read Anne Rice's Sleeping Beauty trilogy. It is not written in the contemporary time frame, but you will barely notice... She used the pen name A.N. Roquelaure to write The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty, Beauty's Release, and Beauty's Punishment, available as a boxed set from Amazon. This is NOT a version you would leave out for children of any age and I assure you they will leave you absolutely breathless. Anne Rice put every man and woman's dark fantasies together in one body of work in a way that won't have you rolling your eyes at yet another sentence with the word 'blush' in it. Even the classic, The Story of O by Pauline Reage will be more satisfying than E. L. James's trilogy if you can find it.<br />I heard they are already talking about making a movie based on 50 Shades of Grey and the other two books of the set. I'm not optimistic. The worst case scenario is that the cast from Twilight will occupy the starring roles and thousands of people will be wishing someone had done a better job with such fertile subject matter.<br />As for me, I'm stuck with these books... 50 Shades of Grey, 50 Shades Darker, and 50 Shades Freer. How I wish I'd found them at a yard sale instead....
1451629192|5.0|In Jaycee Dugard's Memior, she talks about her kidnapping and what happened during those 18 years.  I am not going to lie, but some of the things that evil monster did to her are disturbing!  It makes you wonder how in the hell did she keep it together?  The rape she endured from that man and the horrible sexual things he made her do.  Awful!  I felt sorry for her just reading about it.  Then she talks about her daughters.  That must have been a stength for her.  That man took away so much from her and yet gave her two beautiful daughters as she says.  Jaycee is so postive and forgiving in some way.  She has not forgiven the lost years with her mother and sister, but is grateful for what she has now and is trying to live a normal life.  I know when she was first found and was writing this book, people are all like, she's doing it for more money.  I don't think so.  I think she just grew tired of the questions like the details of what had happened to her and how she's doing now.  She talks about driving for the first time at age 30 and being taught by her little sister!  The little things she missed out on then she gets now.  And she has to deal with things differnetly because of what that man did to her.  She is very couragous to share her story.  I read this book in a day and I was very proud of her.
0670022411|5.0|It's summer, and was looking for a easy pool read - something a little fluffy (I've just finished the 5 Game of Thrones books and I didn't want to deal with anything confusing). It was a bit of a slow start, but I was surprised at how much it sucked me in. I enjoyed it, and I'll definitely be reading the next two in this series.
B007Y36K46|5.0|I have no idea why this film, John Carter, was so criticized. I loved it from the moment it started until it ended. It has plenty of action, great special FX. Romance, mystery and a handsome hero who also has a wicked sense of humor.For me, it's as good as any Star Wars or Star Trek movie. it just didn't get the publicity it should have. Too bad. If you still aren't sure, then watch it before buying it, I did and I still intend to buy a copy.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I really love this movie. It's a remake; but it's exceptional. Beautifully done. A lovely and timeless love story. If you're a fan of the book I highly recommend this movie.
B007SGM084|5.0|While most readers have just found the wonderfulness of Fifty, I am one of the lucky ones that was able to read it in the form of Master of the Universe. I loved it then and love it now so much so that I have the trilogy in its original publication from The Writer's Coffee Shop, audio book and the release from Vintage Books...<br /><br />I would recommend this story to anyone....

0553804677|1.0|I had high expectations after reading all the other Amazon reviews, but I was a bit disappointed and found it relatively tough to get through this book.<br /><br />I didn't really enjoy the separate timelines and how slowly the story progressed. I also found that the author spent a lot of time describing the scenery and explaining random facts that didn't ultimately add to the story. The cursing and profanity were unnecessary and all seemed very forced.<br /><br />I got through to about 3/4 of the book and gave up. I've never had to force myself to finish a novel but I do blame myself for reading Name Of The Wind  just previously.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I like the ability to design my own village the way I want it. I also like the new ship that tells the jokes.
0345803485|1.0|My review is only intended for people who took anything at all in these books seriously - sex or love. For those of you who \\"get\\" that this is pure unadulterated fantasy, proceed as you were.<br /><br />As I did with the first Twilight book, I finally relented and read Fifty Shades to see why these books have such wide appeal. If these are just bdsm sex books, haven't we all already read much rougher mainstream stuff in the 1990s thanks to Anne Rice and others? So what's the deal with Fifty Shades?<br /><br />Basically, James delivered a strong dose of low-grade crack. I get it. It's addictive, especially if you keep in mind that James apparently knows just enough about operant conditioning and schedules of reinforcement to know what works best to get her readers hopelessly addicted. (It's certainly not her horrendous writing style that appeals. Repeat, repeat, repeat. *yawn*) But James's drivel is only the stuff of sexual/relationship fantasy. What I worry about are the comments I've heard adult women make about these books. \\"I wish my boyfriend would do that to me.\\" \\"I wish I had a man like Christian.\\" Seriously? It seems that someone may actually be buying into this trash as realistic for long-term relationships. Oh my. If you're one of those women, please just walk away from the book(s) now!<br /><br />Sex/Relationship Education 101, gratis James.<br />(Here's what you should NOT learn from these books that James seems to purport.)<br /><br />1. Jealously works in relationships and brings people closer. Uh, no.<br />2. Being a suffocating, control-freak stalker is desirable. Uh, no.<br />3. Everyone who doesn't enjoy having sex 10 times per day is abnormal and adult men do not have physiological refractory periods. Uh, no.<br />4. There's nothing wrong with women constantly \\"forgetting to eat\\" and engaging in anorexic behavior. Great message. Uh, no.<br />5. If you really really really love someone, you can \\"fix\\" all of their horrendous psychological problems. Seriously, folks? Good luck with that.<br />6. Size matters. A great deal. So men, if you don't have a big one just kill yourselves now. Uh, no.<br />7. You can anesthetize your \\"bits\\" with massive amounts of alcohol and still experience multiple orgasms. Is that so? Again, good luck with that.<br />8. Virgins will always have amazing first sexual experiences if only they have the right man (with a large penis). The pain is nothing to speak of. OK, good luck with that, too.<br /><br />I'm not even going to get into the even sillier aspects of the books. But one last thought. If women all over the world start holding men AND women to James's sexual and relationship bar, I'm afraid we're all lost.<br /><br />THIS IS FICTION. And yeah, crack.eriously, folks? Good luck with that.<br />6. Size matters. A great deal. So men, if you don't have a big one just kill yourselves now. Uh, no.<br />7.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is as addicting as zoo world on myface. just remember to keep track of the clock, and don't do it at work.
0307744434|5.0|I realize that this book is not without flaws; however, the darkness made me happy. While reading Night Circus, I felt that I was in a delicious dark dream from which I did not wish to awaken.
0345803493|3.0|This is a good book as well, could be better though. This book is actually like reading porn hope the third one is not like this.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Unquestionably, one of the best young adult series I've read; it ranks favorably with my all time favorite YA series: Harry Potter!  Whereas \\"Catching Fire\\" rehashed some plot, somewhat slower paced than the first, and arguably a slightly weak ending due to a cliffhanger of sorts (although still extremely well done), \\"Mockingjay\\" brings the series to a close in a thoughtful, well developed fashion. In the \\"Hunger Games\\" series, Collins has captured our current generation's love of reality shows - a la \\"Survivor\\" to \\"Big Brother,\\" plus their \\"video game\\" mentality, and their need for instant gratification, and has blended it with classic dystopian novels: \\"Fahrenheit 451,\\" \\"The Giver,\\" \\"Brave New World,\\" \\"1984,\\" and \\"Lord of the Flies\\" (the latter two books being two of Collins' favorite books from her youth).  So now what we have from Suzanne Collins is a \\"new and improved\\" post-apocalyptic YA series. \\"Mockingjay\\" is well developed; the plot is tense, gritty, and engrossing.<br /><br />Against all odds - human, mechanical, and scientific -  Katniss Everdeen has survived the Hunger Games not once, but twice. But now that she has been saved and spirited out the arena, she's still not safe. The Capitol is angry; the Capitol and President Snow want revenge.  It appears that everyone is out to use her one way or another.  Katniss soon realizes that she is now just as much a pawn for District 13 and President Coin as she was for Snow and the Capital. A new \\"arena\\" later opens for Katniss and her group as they move on the Capital. Collins is ruthless in her depictions of war in all its cruelty, violence, and loss. Her characterization is brilliant as we grow to dislike some and love some others; here are characters about whom one genuinely cares and characters one despises. The love triangle between the three main characters resolves itself; some will forever argue about that. Yet, this book never seemed to lead us to one of those fairy tale, happily-ever-after endings. This is a must read series; read them in order.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|highly entertaining. its my favorite game. I enjoy playing it a lot. the characters in the game are so much fun.
1423134206|5.0|As plenty of other reviewers have noted, this is a pretty terrific book. A lot of care has clearly gone into putting it together, which makes the superfluous gatefolds seem strange. The book contains sixteen pages that fold out to double their normal width, but the pictures on these pages are, with only one exception, printed small enough to fit on regular pages without crossing a fold. Elsewhere, the book features a panoramic Eyvind Earle background that's spread across two normal pages, which means that some of the painting gets lost in the middle crease. Why not put the Earle in the gatefold, where it can be opened up and spread flat? Or, why have gatefolds at all? It's as if the book designers knew that gatefolds add value to a book, but they had no idea why. This is a minor gripe, considering the art on display, but the only effect of the gatefolds is to make some of the pages awkward to open.
B0027MJU00|5.0|I am so in love with this writer!  My breath is just taken away!  I love it when I feel like I am right there with the characters.  I feel the suspense and thrill.  Thank you so much Gillian Flynn!
B007UQ5Z1G|1.0|I used to be the biggest fans of this band right from the first album i was hooked.<br /><br />But until they brought out minutes to midnight their creativity went down hill. It just became pure boring, worse than commercial music!!!!<br /><br />And with this latest release \\"Living Things\\" linkin park should just give up, they really have hit rock bottom. None of the tracks have any originality to them, they just sound like the last 2 albums they brought out, which is really sad as they were so good :-(
B006LSZECO|5.0|I did not read books.  But when I got my Ipad I ordered a book titled, \\"Gone Girl\\".  At first I thought that I would not like it because the writer writes differently than other writers.  But that first chapter was so awesome!  I wanted more.  The writer made me feel like I was right there with the characters.  I could not put the book down. Now I have bought other books written by Gillian Flynn. You will not be disappointed!
B003UHYSIK|5.0|Live Intrusion is an incredible home video capturing the last US show of Slayer's Divine Intervention tour, with clips from the road scattered throughout the concert footage.  It was originally released in the 90's on VHS, but has thankfully been made available on DVD.  Picture and sound are both excellent; I don't own the VHS, but the transfer seems sharp.  The set list on this DVD is pure classic Slayer, with At Dawn They Sleep, Captor of Sin, Hell Awaits, and Chemical Warfare, plus numerous songs from South of Heaven, Reign in Blood, and Seasons in the Abyss.  It also features five tracks from Divine Intervention.  The cover of Venom's Witching Hour has an uncredited guest guitar and vocal appearance by Robb Flynn of Machine Head, out for their first US tour supporting Slayer.  Much of the road footage is hilarious, with hotel hijinks, autograph session madness, sleeping pranks...all the staples of touring videos.  Live Intrusion is without question a DVD any hardcore Slayer fan would enjoy.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Awesome!!!! Loved it.  I loved all three books.  You don't want to miss out on this book.  Thank you Suzanne Collins!
B000M5AJQS|5.0|When I first watched this movie back when it came out on DVD, I didn't fully understand it because there is a lot happening, so you have to pay attention, but anyways, even though I didn't fully understand it, I enjoyed it none-the-less, and it was worth my time to watch it again to see if I could figure out what I missed the first time, and I sure did, so ever since the second time watching it, it has become one of my favorites by Martin Scorsese.<br /><br />Now like I said it can get very confusing, because there is a lot of names and double crossing, but once you figure it out, you will love this film, it has everything you'd want in a mob/scorsese film, excellent and well thought out plot, terrific performances (Leonardo Dicaprio has really become a great actor), and Matt Damon, Mark Whalberg, Jack Nicholson, and Martin Sheen all deliver performances you would expect from them.<br /><br />Let's just say this, I watched the movie again for the first time in about 2 years the other day, and I watched it again that same night, and I'm going to watch it again tonight, you really get drawn into the characters, because it's really a character driven movie.<br /><br />Now I have not seen Infernal Affairs, but if this movie was influenced by it, I'm sure it's really good, so I will have to check it out, I'm sure it's not easy taking a Chinese movie and converting it for an american audience, and like I said, although I have not seen Infernal Affairs, and I cannot make a valid comparison, they did a hell of a job in my book.<br /><br />Another thing I must give a shoutout to is this films soundtrack, every song fits perfectly in every scene, the only song that is meh is Roger Waters cover of 'Comfortably Numb' great song yes, but the original is far surperior, but I can deal with that.<br /><br />So in one word, this is a fantastic modern mob movie, I usually go for the classics myself, but you can set aside a few more modern movies for me, and this is at the top!
B003O86FMW|5.0|It started where the Hunger Games left off and I loved it!<br />Want more.  Am ready to read the Mockingjay!  Thank you Suzanne Collins!
B001F12J0C|5.0|If you've read any of my other reviews, you will see that I'm not much of a fan of modern films, save aside a few, so keep that in mind, so whats my verdict on these? well as you can see from my review title, I absolutely loved these movies, these are really well done and entertaining, one thing that I really like is that they are not CGI filled movies, it seems like old school cops and robbers, with a little bit of a modern feel with the technology and cell phones and what not, another thing that I like that seems to differ from most modern action movies, is that there is no stupid comedy parts in them, as they are very serious movies, with plots that actually mean something (unlike movies like Transformers and Bad Boys and such), and the 3rd thing I really like is that these movies are really well acted, of course we know that Matt Damon is a terrific actor, so that goes without saying, but the rest of the cast did a great job, especially the woman who plays Pamela Landy, and Julia Stiles is wonderful, and pretty at the same time, so double bonus.<br /><br />These movies are filled with great action sequences such as hand to hand combat, gun fights, and great car chases, and the suspence just keeps you drawn in, and keeps a hold on you, and keeps your interest, meaning they dont stray off.<br /><br />Not much more that I can say that everyone else hasn't said already, I watched all 3 of these films in 2 days, and I found all 3 of them to be fantastic, this boxed set is really worth the $20.00 or so dollars you pay, you're getting 3 great movies, plus a bunch of bonus features and the presentation is nice, three slim cases inside of the outer box, that is fine with me, good job Universal, now if only they would put more out like this!
B006RUJST6|5.0|I'm far from being a \\"Young Adult\\" but I adored this book, so much so that I downloaded the sequel as soon as I finished Slammed.<br />I loved it because the characters grabbed me from the outset and I was sucked into their story. I found myself crossing my fingers for them, willing for a happy ending. I know when an author has done a good job because I use every excuse possible to steal away and read. A wonderful book and congratulations to Colleen for an excellent debut.
B006OGMEUI|5.0|The CD is amazing. Eluveitie is a great band and has taken the time to use this cd to tell a story. My personal favourites are A Rose For Epona  and Alesia.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|have you ever wanted access to your favorite songs ,but didn't have enough money to download them or buy the album. If so this is for you. its absolutely free of cost. you can download any youtube video directly to your tablet and you can even convert it as mp3 download!
B007PVHMCG|5.0|I really wanted this for my son, but did not want to pay Scalper prices for it. I have been searching in earnest for the last week or so.  Finally, this evening, Amazon got some in at the regular price.<br /><br />As I write this, they have had stock for 2 1/2 hours and counting... And they are limiting sales to 1 per customer (I know because I tried to buy 2).<br /><br />Kudos to Amazon for getting these and doing what they can to ensure that the limited supply goes as far as possible.<br /><br />BTW, I found out these were in stock because a few days ago I signed up for alerts on this LEGO set from a site called NowInStock dot net.  I did not notice the txt for about a half hour, but still managed to get one.  Another chain has gotten some in the last few days, but I always missed out - even had it in my cart before it sold out one time, but it did sell out before I finished the transaction.
0486284735|5.0|I love this book. Reading it after I saw the movie helped me make a mental movie of what is going on as I read.
B00867GHS8|2.0|This is whats wrong with movies today. $33 dollars for a movie! Who buys a Blu ray and then says \\"Gee I hope this comes with a low resolution DVD version too, or I am not buying it.\\" All I want is the 3D version because I already bought the Blu ray disc but instead, I'm gonna be forced to pay for a DVD I don't want, a 2D disc I don't want, and a digital download that I don't want. People wonder why piracy is rampant, well this is why.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|the best for insomniacs. I will definitely share this app with my friends and family. so totally worth it. will use it everyday even if I don't need it.

034580404X|1.0|I was very disappointed.  After hearing everyone talk about how this book was so good.  I found it to be disgusting. I am sorry I purchased the set prior to finding out how much I was not going to enjoy reading the book.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this app. I have the game on my iPhone and loved it so I was thrilled to find it for the Kindle Fire. I haven't had any problems with gliches or freezing. My boys(8, 5, and 3) all love this game. It will keep them quiet and entertained when sitting and waiting for appointments or long car rides.
B0019Y8G9I|2.0|I bought the vinyl version of this in a record store in Nashville.  I hadn't seen it anywhere before so I thought I might have found something interesting.  Wrong.  The live recording is convincing, and I really enjoy live for the ambience.  Wynton's performance sounded like a practice take and Willie, well, bad off-rhythm singing (drunk?), and really poor guitar playing.  Still, there is something that keeps making me put this back on the player.  Maybe it is the fact that this was a unique recording, or maybe I am just attracted to train wrecks or good sounding vinyl.
0345803485|4.0|This book started off a little slow, but once it got about a 1/3 of the way into it, I became just like every other woman i know. I could not put it down! I read the whole thing in just days, and had to pace myself at the end so that i did not go crazy waiting on the second book (as i did not have this yet). I am looking forward to the third book in this trilogy, as i am already to the point of starting it! I know this set has become quite controversial, but it is a GREAT story, and for me thats really the point of reading a book!!
B007MDB71O|5.0|I love this movie! I read all the books when I was in high school and was thrilled to see that it was being made into a movie. I was so upset that it did not get better reviews because this means NO SEQUELS. :( I am not happy about this! I want to see more!!!
B00007E7K0|5.0|This is great when you need a replacement because you dropped your original in a stream...<br /><br />\\"Fits like a glove.\\"<br /><br />AND it arrived a week early!
B0058YPGL6|5.0|I bought it for my nephew who is 15 and he loves the series.  Will buy season two when it comes out.  Downloaded the version for myself.  Can't wait to watch.
B00170MYIS|1.0|I normally do not place product reviews but this battery sucks. I am not sure if this was an accident or if this is a shady seller; Schinn Mabaan. This battery does not work, it will not charge. I have the correct charger and my other battery charges just fine. I wanted to have a spare. Battery is labeled as \\"Europe Only\\", I am not sure if that is the problem but my other battery does not have that label. Should have just bought one at Target.<br /><br />I would give this zero stars but guess you have to give at least one.
B008M36ER0|5.0|Classic Mel Gibson... Excellent Movie!  Get the Gringo was a nice little surprise. It definitely has a clever kind of an dark comedy feel.  I really enjoyed this movie start to finish... Enjoy!!!
0425263908|5.0|Excellent book....cant wait for the rest of the series to come out....so impatiently waiting...it has alot of simularities to 50 shades....but yet a completely different angel....very intense book
B008JH5CVS|2.0|Really wanted this to be a nice, action, set-in-space,flick BUT what I got was a poor version of \\"Escape from NY\\". Do not recommend.
0345529057|5.0|I ordered the first four books in the \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" collection.  The books came in exactly as described.  The price was great!  4 books that are all 1,000 pages or more for just around $20, is an amazing deal.
B00846REIS|2.0|After just finishing al three 50 Shades in about a week, I was going through withdraws and wondering what I could read that would match 50! I turned to this and found it to be such a disappointment. I'm wondering if the author matched the exact characters beat for beat and just changed their names. This book is identical to 50 shades and was such a disappointment because I knew exactly what was going to happen, the psychologist, the rich guy who owns everything, blah blah blah. However, this book would be a great read for someone who has yet to read 50 Shades.
B0042MDAL8|1.0|Asked for Blu-ray disc and received it in a regular DVD format.<br /><br />Make sure when you order your DVD it comes as you ordered it. Will think twice before I order from Amazon.<br /><br />Loved the movie.

B008JGSM6G|4.0|like the way you must think &quot;out side the box&quot;. wish there was a HINT button. Colors are great addition too
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Even if I nothing to do this game is always fun! I wish it was easier to get acorns without spending money...
B008JMKN4Y|1.0|I downloaded this book for a quick read at the beach and my expectations may have been too high because of all the great reviews.  This books is tragically immature and written for 14 to 16 year olds but I wouldn't want them reading a book like this...just not right. It is also poorly written and the plot is a mess.  I kept reading and expecting it would get better but turned out to be a complete waste of time.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I've used a few weather apps but this one is the best so far. I am bewilderd by the one star reviews.  This app is easy and works well!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love that I can download right from my phone. So far it is a really good book, I hope it is as good as the first.
B005MW8CLK|5.0|The difference between \\"Gish\\" and the rest of the other Pumpkins albums, for me at least, is that it feels like the entire band contributed to the songs more. Jimmy Chamberlain's drums feel organic and alive, James Iha rips through guitar solos and lines of notes like it's nothing, D'Arcy plays her bass with great intensity/grace and even sings on \\"Daydream\\". To me, this is the only Smashing Pumpkins album that Billy Corgan let everyone shine equally and that's what makes this so unique.<br /><br />The sound of this album is psychedelic rock and sometimes just melodic rock that is extremely beautiful without heavy distortion blaring. There's no doubt that this was the beginning of better albums to come, but there is a charm on this album that's found less and less as the years went by with later albums (not saying the ones after this weren't good, but it seemed like with each album after this one Billy Corgan took more and more creative control).<br /><br />As for the bonus stuff, the one disc has early demos and tracks that are similar to or actually are found on \\"Pisces Iscariot\\". The early live show is amazing, the band is full of energy and sound great.<br /><br />I love all the Pumpkins albums that followed (minus \\"Zeitgeist\\") and Billy Corgan's vision for the band and evolving/experimenting with sound that came about later on.<br />This album like I said before though is the only album that actually sounds like the band are working as a team instead of being lead by Billy.<br /><br />This is a must buy for Pumpkins fans and for people who like good rock music.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|Loved this prog from the first season. Since i got rid of comkast i now buy select seasons of the programs i loved. The dvd came within a few days, in sealed package, not scratches, in perfect condition. Will def use this vendor again. Cant wait for season five to be on disc.
