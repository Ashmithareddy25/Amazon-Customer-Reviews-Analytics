B00000K3CM|5.0|Ok, so Home Alone 2 is very similar to Home Alone, but that's what's so brilliant about it. I think that the this film is better than the original, mainly because of the superb addition other characters make to the movie. Tim Curry is brilliant in this.<br />So yeah, if you like Home Alone, you'll love Home Alone 2. It rocks!
0385504209|2.0|I read this book just from the perspective of wanting a good mystery to read - the religious 'accuracy' aspects didn't concern me.  And - it simply didn't hold my interest very well.  The plot seemed fairly lite, and the characters weren't well developed.  I probably scanned through about 1/4 of the book's pages.  I suspect that Dan Brown recognized that the religious implications of what he wrote would make the book sell - and for that he is correct!
B00000G3PA|5.0|Many are say this is a film that drags on to long and doesn't get to the point. If it didn't get the point soon enough the film would be a drag and would never end. Seeing how it ended, it apperently got to the point.<br />The digital features were amazing, though I must admit the astroid wasn't as real as I expected it to be. The casting director picked an amazing cast, whom worked well together. <br />The movie was funny, sad, and a enjoyable adventure to save Earth.<br />Bruce Willis did a wonderful job, and I watch this movie all the time becouse it is an enjoyable film and I recommened to anyone who as not yet seen it to go rent it or watch any way possible because I am sure you will love it!
630463949X|5.0|If this isn't the best live recording ever done, I'd like to know what is.<br />And if you weren't a Fleetwood Mac fan before watching it, you will certainly be a lifetime convert by the second or third performance on this video.<br />All five band members are on top of their game here, and you don't have to know much about the painful relationship histories played out on Rumours in order to feel the emotional reconciliation and maturity that is evident throughout The Dance.<br />This, simply put, is a magnificent collection of performances by the most insanely talented group in pop music history.<br />About as close to perfect as you can get.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This album is possibly the greatest album of all time. Many people out there think Britney's voice is terrible. But let me put it this way. Can any of u sing better or even equally as good as her? No-I didn't think so. A lot of the people posting mean comments here are only doing it because they've never heard the album. They just hate Britney. I assure u, I used to hate Britney for the past five years, but now, ever since Toxic, I purchased the CD and immediately fell in love with it. <BR>Here is a review of the songs:<BR>Me Against the Music: 9.5/10 <BR>Great beat, didn't really see the need for Madonna though<BR>(I got that) Boom Boom: 6/10<BR>Not really good. i'm not into the whole Ying Yang Twins thing. I like some hip-hop songs, but the collaboration is a little un-wanted.<BR>Showdown: 8/10<BR>Okay, but it lacks some lyrics<BR>Breathe on Me: 10/10<BR>A great song! Catchy!<BR>Early Mornin': 5/10<BR>Worst song of the album, but average compared with Xtina songs.<BR>Toxic: 10/10<BR>The best song eva! Luv it!<BR>Outrageous: 10/10<BR>A great song! R. Kelly and Britney roc!<BR>Touch of my hand: 10/10<BR>Great song!<BR>The hook up: 10/10<BR>Catchy club tune<BR>Shadow: 10/10<BR>BEautiful ballad<BR>Brave New Girl: 10/10<BR>Great and dancy song<BR>Everytime: 10/10<BR>Great song, can't believe she wrote it herself<BR>MATM remix: 10/10<BR>love the extra sounds
B000008GHW|5.0|This is shameful, a great release of Hendrix... completed after his death, but with enough of Jimi on there, both playing and engineering to warrant this one as one of Jimi's [before all the other stuff started emerging].  After this, I believe Crash Landing appeared and then the gates opened and the market was flooded with material Hendrix would have never approved of.  Too bad.  There are some live cuts on here from a Maui Concert at Rainbow, Astro Man, EZ Rider, Angel good stuff.  The band I was in at the time used to copy the daylights out of this release.  It was good stuff.  Re-release[...]
B0000A9GLS|1.0|One of the characters in this horrid film actually has the temerity to compare what is happening to them to Ms. Christie's classic, Ten Little Indians! This movie is confusing, unbelievable and trite. Let me see if I can dispense this film, obviously launched to acquire money from the less discerning in our population,in a paragraph or so. The first 100 minutes of the film you can skip. It transpires that all the mayhem, and blood-letting, unconvincing, at the hotel really didnt happen! It was all imagined by this chap about to be executed for multiple murders.H e convinces those taking him o the xecution area, as well as the legal and psychiatric authorities, that he is no longer a danger since now he oly imagines bad things. Maybe he didnt take his medication that day, but on the way to the prison for the criminally insane he murders everyone in the car, and shortly thereafterwards sends one of his manifest identities, a young boy, to strangle an attractive girl her Florida garden. Apparently, the screenweriter was not satisfied with imaginary characters buried in the synopses of the psychotic killer, but with a Stephen King-like enthusiasm, made it possible for the killer to created these personalities in flesh and blood. I don't think this is clininically possible, and I have poured over the DSM -I-IV, of the AMA.If there were such an entity, it would certainly be a challenge to treat.<br />Since all that happened at the hotel was imaginary, I don't feel that I should have to describe that action. I will say this, altough I'm sure such a nuance point was not in the mind of the director or screenwriter, he lack of plot, craziness, inconsistencies, symbol objects such as a key,the curious amount of rain in Nevada, killings, does point to the imaginary ramblings of psychotic killer.<br />I'm going back to Hitchcock; I've had enough of this. The lst thriller I viewed that was realistic was Sea of Love. If you have not seen this get it, anvailable trough amazon.<br />One final irritation. This movie had many opportunities for laugh-out loud wicecracks and jokes. Try turning this movie down and providing your own dialogue. It will be hilarious!
B000068G9X|5.0|Heavy Metal Classic. Danzig is the King. Who said he was better than Ozzy, though? Whatever. This CD rocks!!!<br />MOTHER. MOTHER. MOTHER.
B0000C9ZSV|3.0|I am not a big fan of the post Electric Ladyland era Hendrix.  Most of the material coming out after Electric Ladyland just seemed to be marking time while Hendrix was transitioning into something else he hadn't fully decided on.  So while this CD is good, it seems to me it is not as good as other \\"live\\" material already released.<br />I would recommend any one of these CD's instead:<br />1.) Blue Wild Angel:  Jimi Hendrix Live At The Isle Of Wight<br />2.) Live At Woodstock<br />3.) Live At Winterland  or<br />4.) Stages (if you can find it)
B00006J3T4|1.0|This is really a soundtrack so it is not an \\"album\\" in the normal sense of the word.  The music is in service to the film-so the logic, which drives it, does not necessarily make it material for the popular music world.  Indeed, the music may in fact serve \\"The Ragpicker's Dream\\" very well.  I don't know since I cannot get my hands on a copy of the movie from the local video store.<br />But as music there is not much to recommend here.  My brother-in-law who is a guitar freak speaks very highly of this CD; but I was disappointed.  On first listen, I had the impression that Knopfler was phoning in his performance.  Successive listening have dispelled that impression but as fine a craftsman Mark Knopfler is nothing on this CD matches his work with Dire Straits.<br />I did like \\"You Don't Know You're Born\\" and \\"Coyote\\" but over half the CD is finished before you get to these gems.  Then the rest of the album sinks into the same undistinguished doodlings as the first part.  Sorry, I simply can't say this is a good CD.
B0000E6I1J|5.0|When John Lennon died, I was angry.  When I got in my car on that cold winter day I heard on the radio that George Harrison died, I cried all the way on the twenty-minute journey.  We knew it was coming.  Still, Harrison's passing hit me hard.<br />Back in the day (the 1960's), you could tell a lot about a person by who his favorite Beatle was.  My favorite was George.  There was just something about his presence in those public appearances that I could identify with.  It turns out my future wife also was a big fan of Harrison's.  Hard to say why.  Harrison's song output was usually only one or two songs for each Beatles album.  John and Paul were usually more talkative.  But George was the one I felt closest to.  When he died part of my life slipped away.<br />So I cannot be objective about this album.  I love it like an old photograph of my grandparents who are also long gone.  And that is not a bad way to view this album, an act of love of Harrison's \\"family\\" to his memory.<br />The album consists of two discs.  The first disc is a small homage to George's love of Indiana music.  As such, most will give it one listen and forget it which is a shame because rarely do we get such a fine presentation of Eastern music in one setting.  It should be given more than a couple of chances.  Harrison himself was drawn to this music and devoted a lot of time toward it.  It gives the listener a little view into Harrison's life beyond the hype and celebrity roller coaster of events and press releases.<br />The second disc presents us with the Harrison we thought we knew.  All the way from the early Beatles to the solo artist to the Traveling Wilburys, the expanse of Harrison's songwriting comes in for a decent selection.  Of course, the actual performances are the thing.<br />In this regard, one has to admire Eric Clapton for setting the tone and standard for the evening's proceedings.  Clapton is a constant presence on stage taking the lead on much of concert with his vocals and outstanding guitar work.  Jeff Lynne also has to be respected for his input.  Lynne is not a welcome musician in a lot of reviews-but he always did well toward Harrison and turns in an excellent version of \\"Give Me Love (Give Me Peace On Earth)\\".<br />I have to confess that I don't know who Joe Brown is except I have read his name on various album credits over the years.  I gather he is something of an institution in the United Kingdom.  In any event, Mr. Brown lends a note of grace and warmth with his low-key performances of \\"Here Comes The Sun\\" and \\"That's The Way It Goes\\".<br />Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers in contrast seem a little weak and \\"under powered\\" with \\"Taxman\\" and \\"I Need You\\".  It is not until the last half of \\"I Need You\\" that Tom and the band hit their stride.  I have no doubt that Petty very much wanted to be there; but I was surprised to be disappointed with his set.<br />After a brief \\"Handle With Care\\" by the Petty, Lynne and Dhani Harrison, the concert takes us to the closest thing we will ever get as far as a Beatles reunion these days.  Ringo comes on to remind us of George's contributions toward Ringo's own solo work and Harrison's love for Carl Perkins.  Then McCartney hits the stage.<br />There was a real potential for McCartney to overwhelm the festivities by virtue of his presence.  But to his credit, McCartney submerges his charm into the performances of some of Harrison's best work.<br /><br />But a special note has to be made of Billy Preston.  Preston plays support throughout most of the evening, but then he takes lead on \\"Isn't It A Pity\\" and \\"My Sweet Lord\\".  It is on the later that Preston really shines.  Over the years, Preston has romanced \\"My Sweet Lord\\" to the point that it has become truly his.  His performance is one of the best of the entire concert.  Perhaps only second to McCartney's satisfying rendition of \\"Something\\".<br />In the end the question remains for this tribute album that is with every tribute album:  whybuy this when you can get real thing.  After all, Harrison's albums are hardly out of print.  The answer is this album marks an event where musicians who really knew and worked with Harrison came together to celebrate his life and play his music.  In other words, this is a tribute album that really does pay tribute to the memory of one who really did help shape the world we live in now.  George Harrison deserved no less.uy this when you can get real thing.  After all, Harrison's albums are hardly out of print.

B0001BKAEY|2.0|I swear, the Wachowski bros. have a one dollar bet (like the movie trading places) with George Lucas (the new Star Wars Trilogy) and Square (Final Fantasy Movie) on who can spend the most money on a film that has a god awful plot (and ruin their credibility).<BR>The Matrix was fresh, smart, exicting, paid attention to little details that made things interesting and/or fun, and had a great story.<BR>The sequels had numerous scenes that could've been reduced or cut entirely to the point that they could have made just one sequel and be done with it.<BR>Revolutions had an ok story in general, but the presentation was very flawed. Here is a laundry list of the offenses:<BR>- You hardly see Neo, Trinity, or Morpheous and when you do see them they really don't do much.<BR>- the film focuses on way too many minor characters that you really don't care for.<BR>- in the first movie you didn't see shades on everyone as much and you saw more emotion, in the sequels everyone acts like robots because you can't ever see their eyes when they are in the Matrix.<BR>- You see the machines flying around for way too long (especially during the zion fight). The first Matrix showed enough of the real world and the machines to scare the hell out of you and then moved on. Now they do needless CG because they can.<BR>- The whole opening part where Neo is stuck between worlds should have been heavily cut. There could have been a better way to explain that Neo can interact with Machines in the real world and that programs also want freedom.<BR>- the final fight was way too cartoony, the first film's fight between Neo and Smith was cool, in this one it is a joke.<BR>- The ending was mostly useless, Neo and Trinity die for a temporary cease fire so the Wachowski bros. can pump out another game &quot;The Matrix Online&quot;<BR>- speaking of games: am i really supposed to play a buggy and awful game (Enter the Matrix) just to see cut footage from the sequels?<BR>If the directors would've focused more on a good story and using CG to assist the storytelling process (like the first film) the series would've been awesome. Now I doubt I will ever want to see anything that the Wachowski bros. are ever involved with in the future.<BR>So get &quot;The Matix&quot; and &quot;The Animatrix&quot; and stop there. If you must buy more sci-fi movies then get Solaris, Blade Runner, or 2001 - A Space Odyssey.
B000066NW0|5.0|A lot of the reviews I have been reading have been bashing Avril saying that she is not like other punk bands or anything like that - first off, isn't that a good thing? She has her own sound and her own personality. Who wants a world of music where everyone sounds the same?<br />Another thing I read was that she doesn't write her own music - who cares? Most singers don't. What do you think a SONGWRITER does? Besides, she's only a teenager. You think Britney writes all her own music? Avril also doesn't have to sing about autobiographical things for her music to be good... Avril's audience probably doesn't care much about the &quot;meaning&quot; of the songs, but rather the SOUND. Also, who cares if she is a poser? SO MANY artists these days are posers! Britney is (and she's the highest paid pop artist), JT is, Jessica Simpson is... who she is as an artist doesn't affect what her music sounds like.<br />I would give this album a great rating because the songs all sound different and aren't boring or drawn out like most artists tend to do. For those who said negative things about her album saying that she's not doing a good enough job... where's your record deal?<br />And if you're going to say something negative, LEARN TO SPELL!
B00008H2LB|5.0|You critics have to be kidding me.  This is the single best CD made in the last 10 years!  Just listen to the lyrics along with the music.  It's unbelievable!  You critics (jokers) must be out of your minds.
B00005JLYW|5.0|Are you people kidding me here??!!!<BR>This movie was hilarious.  It never took itself seriously once and was made to poke fun at serious movies in the genre of cop, spy or karate flicks.<BR>It was so blatantly silly that you just had to laugh and it was meant to be this way.<BR>Come on, what were you expecting???<BR>It was done very well, because this is the way these movies should be done, in a fun, lighthearted way.  Just watch Starsky and Hutch and you'll see alot of those similarities.<BR>Lighten up, here!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00009V7RF|1.0|Your better off buying real hip hop music.  Black eye peas are not even a hip hop group.  They are more of a hip pop group.<BR>This is coming from one a former dead hard Black eye peas fan, they sold out to white America.  The only way they can make money is to turn their backs from hip hop and turn pop.
B00005JMNA|4.0|I ENJOYED THIS MOVIE.  I THOUGHT IT HAD A FULL PLOT AND EVEN THOUGH IT COULD USE A LITTLE MORE ACTION.  I FEEL IT DIDN'T HAVE ALOT TO DO WITH THE FIRST MOVIE.  IT WAS A VARIETY OF WHAT DIRTY DANCING IS.  I WAS PLEASE TO SEE THEY USE PATRICK SWAZEY.  I THOUGHT IT WAS ROMATIC AND A GOOD MOVIE TO SEE.  I THINK THEY SHOULD HAVE AGED IT SENSE IT WAS A WHILE SENSE THE FIRST MOVIE CAME OUT.  BUT IT WAS NICE BECUSE SHOWED A DIFFERENT COUNTRY AND WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE THEN.
B000084T18|3.0|With so many Dre tracks floating around in Hip Hop these days, it's hard to say how the good ones were avoided on this album. There are some great songs on this album (Patiently Waiting, Wanksta, In Da Club), but so many more awful ones (Don't Push Me, 21 Questions, Many Men, Bloodhound, You Not Like Me, etc.) The CD would be good to blast in your car if you're a rich white boy who's convinced himself that he's black. Which you're not. I'm sorry.<BR>Highlights: Patiently Waiting, In Da Club, Wanksta<BR>Lowlights: Many Men, If I Can't, P.I.M.P, Like My Style, Poor Lil Rich
B0001IN07Q|1.0|Another aweful attempt. Peter Cincotti, Brian Evans, and Buble need to get off the Sinatra wannabe bandwagon. This CD is terrible.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|I know I'm not with the majority in saying this, but I truly think that this movie was much, much better than the first. This isn't a case of a fanboy trying to convince himself because he's desperate to like the sequel, I already tried that with the Matrix Revolutions and failed (the third and final part of this trilogy is truly a bad movie in almost every sense).<br />I went into this movie expecting expensive special effects and not much story.  The key to the success of the first movie was that it had a simple story, I was simply hoping that Reloaded would come close to achieving the same thing.  What I got was way beyond expectations.<br />In the first ten minutes of this movie, I had the same misgivings that I think everyone else did. However, I seem to have gotten over them much faster than everyone else. Yes, the old insular, gritty nature of the first movie, the small group against impossible odds, is gone.  I missed this at first, but then I realised that the Wachowskis had set out to tell a much bigger story, and this needs to happen on a much bigger stage.<br />The movie is somewhat unbalanced. The first half-hour is set within the underground city of Zion, which isn't as impressive as it should have been, and it contains Morpheus' speech to the masses, which is far less impressive than it should have been.  But I didn't find the rave/sex scene to be anywhere near as dull as others did.  It serves a valuable purpose within the framework of the movie.<br />Once the Zion section is over, though, the movie never lets up.  The fights are more impressive, the story is incredible, and the special effects are amazing. And for once, over-the-top special effects actually aid the flow of the movie, rather than distract from it. It is the slickest, coolest movie I've ever seen.  It isn't Citizen Kane, but it is so cool that it outshines anything else that came out in 2003.<br />The DVD also sports a few neat documentaries that, unlike the documentaries on the original Matrix DVD, don't ruin the movie, they show you just how much effort was put into making it (the documentaries on the first DVD show how dull the fights were to film, and how slowly they were done, which takes all the fun out of them).<br />But really, when you buy this DVD, you buy it for the movie.  And in this case, it'd be worth the price even if there were no extras at all.
B000084T18|4.0|Boom.50 is finally here.This is a classic album.Anytime you sell 7 million copies its a classic.This Cd is a 4 out 5.With the story to many men and 21 questions this cd has both high lyric content and good beat.The only thing you may not like is too much songs about killing or shooting.Still after hearing this you'll turn Gangsta.
B0001BKAEY|1.0|I was one of the rare few who thought Reloaded was better than the original.  In fact, I thought it was an order of magnitude better than the original.  I had begun to think of the original as a kind of 'Hobbit', and Reloaded and Revolutions were to be 'The Lord of the Rings' one you viewed them together.<br />But Revolutions takes all the questions that were raised by Reloaded, and even a few that were carried over from the original, and does...nothing with them.  This movie answers none of the questions.  It barely even addresses them, except in a dismissive way early on.  I could have put up with a crappy movie and still walked out satisfied if it had answered these questions in some way, but Revolutions doesn't.<br />Not only that, but it would be a bad movie even if it wasn't a Matrix sequel. It has no plot. It has almost no kung fu - the single fight sequence in this movie is by far the most forgettable of all three movies. We do get a long battle scene involving characters like the Kid and Zee who we truly don't care about at all, with special effects that are impressive for the first minute, and boring for the next twenty.  The main characters are left on the sidelines, doing nothing.  Even Neo doesn't get any serious screen time until the big finale.<br />And the finale itself, the big flying battle between Smith and Neo, isn't anywhere near as impressive as the Burly Brawl from Reloaded, or anywhere near as intense as the final Smith-Neo fight from the original.  Neo and Smith fly around, tumble and twist and don't do much real kung fu, and the audience is more engrossed in how cool the rain looks than the actual fight.<br />And if the hideous, sappy Hollywood ending wasn't bad enough, we don't even get a good Rage Against the Machine song when the credits roll.  I was hoping for 'No Shelter', but what we get instead is a swelling, majestic score that made me want to vomit.<br />I've watched Reloaded several times now - including three times at the cinema- and the original many more times than that.  I've watched this movie once, on the opening day, and I never intend to see it again.  I only hope that the WB people realise that there's probably a lot of money to be made by admitting that the movie was terrible, and remaking it better a second time.
B00005AQF7|5.0|Snoop D o double G. Now this cd is not for the weak. Snoop has a smoothe and quick flow on this cd. At this point in his career he was the ABSOLUTE BEST MC.Songs like murder was the case and Gin and Juice no one can fade them,EVER.This cd is one of the best off all time.There's not just one hit there's nothing but hits.If you are ready to ride you could put on serial killa or if you feeling laid back you put on Doggy Dog world and if you feeling like partying put on Gin and Juice. Man if you don't like cd you don't like rap.PERIOD THE END.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I fell in love with Firefly as soon as I watched the first episode aired on FOX.  It didn't matter that it wasn't the pilot, and that they continued to air all of the episodes that they showed in whatever order they felt like, it didn't matter that the show combined Sci-Fi with Westerns, both of which I don't particularly tend to enjoy.  There was something about how the characters interacted with each other, about the family that they formed, that was breathtaking--and addicting.  I watched every episode FOX showed, and then I began saving up money for the DVDs.  I bought them a few months ago, and watch them all the time.  The dialogue and plots of the episodes lend themselves to rewatching, as I often catch things that I missed in earlier viewings, and the extras on the DVDs are spectacular, especially the commentaries.  Now, I'm simply trying to wait until the movie for more of these characters, these stories, this family.
0800179501|4.0|Now that none of the K2's are available, I can only assume the studio that has distributor rights to the series (Columbia/Tristar) will probably re-release all three or four films as a box set.  Is that a good thing?  Considering the first two are of any relevance, its a good way for the studios to recover any money for the last two.  This is simlar to how 'Back to the Future' and the 'Pink Panthers' have been re-released.  Let's hope the studio releases K-Kid I in widescreen and with additional content.
B000089RVX|5.0|First of all, I love Evanescence. Now that I said that, let's get down to the music.<br />Going Under- It's OK. Why it was released as a single, I don't know. 3/5<br />Bring Me To Life- This song got me hooked. 5/5<br />Everybody's Fool- The new single. 5/5<br />My Immortal- A tearjerker the first time you hear it. 5/5<br />Haunted- The goth influence is apparent on this song. 4/5<br />Tourniquet- Written by drummer Rocky Gray, it denounces suicide. It coulda done well on Christian radio. 5/5<br />Imaginary- Not bad, but not good either. I liked the old version of the song better. 4/5<br />Taking Over Me- It's being played on Christian radio, although not a single. I like it. 4/5<br />Hello- This song gives a lot of imagery. 5/5<br />My Last Breath- Just OK. 3/5<br />Whisper- Used to be great, but they had to change it. 4/5<br />Now, if you like &quot;Fallen&quot;, go and download (yes, download) &quot;Origin&quot;. You won't be disappointed.
B00005GL0R|5.0|First of all, this is one of the albums that really seriously deserves five stars. A lot of others get it because all the groups' fans come in and obligatorily rate their albums a five, but this one transcends any group preferences. It is simply music, and &quot;arguably&quot; (though not by much) some of the best ever created.<br />Second, I don't believe there are any reviews here actually for this version of the CD release. You have to hand it to the Japanese Toshiba/EMI label for realizing that it is due time to remaster one of the greatest albums of all time. Capitol in the US continues to sit on their 1987 CD issues of all Beatles albums. Many advances in technology have been made in 17 years but none of the albums (save for the Let It Be re-creation) have been digitally remastered to take advantage of this technology. And the sad thing is, not many listeneres know the difference right now. But once the US labels actually do remaster the Beatles catalog, they will definitely see what they've been missing.<br />On this release you will find smooth, clear audio, with no background hissing! What a revolutionary accomplishment! Actually, it's been done millions of times, but for some reason not in the US to the Beatles albums! This remastered CD lets the brilliance of this album truly shine and one can only hope that a more affordable version will come to fruition here in the states, and perhaps it will sound even better, though that's hard to imagine.
B00003CX9E|1.0|I was browsing movies on the Internet for something best to watch, using reviews to decide if it might be worth my time or not. When the movie started, I already knew this one was a mistake. I sat through the whole thing patiently and in the end I felt very cheated out of a buck and a couple hours of my life I could of spent doing something else. The acting, characters, script, and plot were pathetic. The ending that people keep mentioning wasn't a big deal at all. This movie was not artistic as some claim. It wasn't entertaining. It was just a bad attempt at a boring story about newspaper tycoon. It's one of the worst movies I have ever seen.
B0001BKAEE|5.0|This movie was one of the best matrix movies. Tons of action,yet a great plot. If you like war movies, it has lots of battles between machines and people. If you like good old kungfu this is a great movie for you. It is a must see.
B00000JCOV|5.0|Slipknot is an awesome band. This is an awesome CD. All the songs are great.
B00008S2VG|4.0|I have had this title for about 11 months now, and I am still listening to it. The songs have a more personal and unapologetic feel, than some previous albums. It is an album that you may not want if you have difficulty adjusting your clocks when daylight savings time comes, because this album not for the &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; crowd. She leaves virtually all ties to previous work in the dust, and goes in a definitely different (albeit abstract) direction.<br />It is quite sad that this album got such bad reviews. America tend's not to give &quot;different&quot; a chance, and end up writing off otherwise innovative music as &quot;bad&quot;. It's definitely a different album than the cookie-cutter radio-friendly drivel, but I guess the public likes hear the same top 40 crap over and over again.<br />With songs with a futuristic edge like &quot;Die Another Day&quot; and &quot;Nobody knows me&quot;,there is a definite electonic feel to alot of the songs. Then there are some personal softie songs like &quot;Love Profusion&quot; and &quot;Intervention&quot; that make you feel like you are driving though some pastoral field like in some mushy car commercial. You people just need to give it a chance, or maybe you'd rather be force fed the regular blandness manufactured by MTV and mega-conglomerates.
B00001SIES|5.0|Muse's recent commercial and critical success for 'Absolution' has certainly been deserved, with 'Absolution' one of the, if not THE, finest albums of 2003. With their second album 'Origin of Symmetry'(an album which I personally think is very average) already quite famous due to the singles 'newborn' and 'plug in baby', I sometimes look back at Muse's first effort and feel it's a bit....left behind.<BR>  Which I consider to be a major major musical crime, as 'Showbiz' is, in my eyes, their best album.<BR>  It Starts with the immense, infectious 'Sunburn' (a song which shows us the whole range of Matt Bellamy's instrumental range), and moves swiftly onto 'Muscle Museum', one of the best songs off this album and Muse's career. These two songs really do set the tone for the rest of this very fun collection of songs.<BR>  The seventh track, 'Unintended', is a wonderful slow song, showing that Muse can do so much more than fast-paced rock anthems. While 'Showbiz' is one of the most perfect semi-rock numbers you'll ever hear.<BR>  I have a lot of friends who haven't really heard much of this storming debut, and still consider 'Origin of Symmetry' to be Muse's best album (even though Absolution is twice as good). However, nothing will ever make me think that mUse will produce a finer album than this. Showbiz's sheer energy and diversity make it a must-have for any real music loving fan.<BR> And I'm still not that sure how they really sound like Radiohead in ANY of their periods......
B000001FKY|5.0|Def Leppard made one heck of an album with &quot;Hysteria&quot;. From top to bottom it has an endless amount of hits. It has the radio rocker &quot;Pour Some Sugar on me&quot;. It has awesome loud, fast hard rockers with &quot;Run Riot&quot;. Other good songs are &quot;Animal&quot;, &quot;Rocket&quot;,  and &quot;Women.&quot; And also, if you like slow depressing songs then &quot;Love Bites&quot; is the one for you.
B00005JMX4|4.0|Having experienced high school in the time when Tom Cruise did his famous slide into the living room to Bob Seger's \\"Old Time Rock & Roll\\", and seen Hollywood remake movies to fit previous standards, I expected very little to surprise me when this movie was slated to be released in March of this year (some of the pages on the official website still show the original release date). <BR>It seems as though the director and producers (one of whom is a Hollywood behind-the-camera name btw) wanted to bring \\"Risky Business\\" into the 21st century. One of the background tunes is even similar in sound to one of the themes from that movie. The actors who play Emile's parents are less severe than Tom's were, probably to avoid playing any sort of stereotype. With Georgetown replacing Princeton in this film, and more time spent on the story, the people behind this film don't seem to be trying to remake Risky Business over again (could this mean that Hollywood is learning that remakes don't always sell well)<br />In the end, I found the surprise ending to this film enjoyable, especially since I could relate to what they did, as I spent a few years working at my high school, and saw how it had changed, and not changed, since I had been there. The only downside to the film was its overall predictability. You knew that he would either get the girl, or enjoy his time withere, and they didn't seem to do anything new with that part of the movie, other than letting you know how they were after high school.
B00004T9UF|1.0|Yo what up dog. I am just talking like them. Eminem thinks he is tough. I am really scared of a 5'10 150 pound boy  who couldn't survive one second in the army. Eminem is terrible so do everybody a favor and do not support his &quot;music.&quot; And he is a wifebeater. Why would you support a beater?
B0000TLA9G|4.0|I enjoy listening to it, although I know it leaves something to be desired. Maybe a better way to have gone about this was to put together a multi-disk compilation, or a box set...but then they'd have to admit that they are really done, and I don't think that they are ready to do that.
0385510438|3.0|I enjoyed this book. The protagonist, Willie Traynor, is a journalist/entrepreneur who grows up page by page, and I enjoyed his journey. The town of Clanton is carefully drawn. The book is true to the 1970s as I remember them. And the crime that is the catalyst was truly despicable and movingly told. All that said, there are some disappointments. First of all, I figured out whodunnit and why well before the book ended, and I hate it when that happens. And it does seem to be a valentine to the death penalty, which bothered me enormously. (This from the man who wrote THE CHAMBER?) Perhaps Grisham was just being true to the feelings of his characters, but the blood lust did strike me as creepy. Still, this is a very good writing trying something new, and I applaud the effort.
B000059XY3|3.0|Batman forever is where the Batman franchise was put in the hands of Joel Schumacher.  This batman film is quite entertaining; after all it does have the some of the best action scenes throughout all the Batman films.  However this film doesn't come close to Burton's work but it is still fun to watch.  Before I go on, let me state one thing.  THIS MOVIE STANDS ON ITS OWN 2 FEET, IT ISN'T A SEQUEL TO BATMAN RETURNS.  I'll explain why that is later, first here is the plot.<BR>Batman (Now played by Val Kilmer) is out to get Two Face aka Harvey Dent (Tommy Lee Jones) Two face is a villain who is obsessed about trying to do whatever it takes to kill Batman.  Two Face/Harvey Dent was once an attorney in Gotham but then a guy from the mob had thrown chemicals in his face during a court trial.  He blames Batman for not saving him and that is why he is after him.  But he isn't the only problem, an insane inventor at Wayne Enterprise named Edward Nigma (Jim Carry) decides to wreak because his boss (Bruce Wayne obviously) didn't give him a funding for his project he was working on.  Nigma's work was a device made to manipulate brain waves so people would think there in the tv show they're watching.  Wayne didn't like the idea.  Now after getting pissed, he decides to stalk Bruce by mailing him anonymous and very erie riddles.  Not only that, he gets a bit obsession over Two face and joins him and starts wearing a green suit with lots question? marks signs and likes to be called the Riddler.  He makes a deal w/ two face, if 2face helps him steal lots of $ so Nigma can create his own organization that will build a lot of the brain wave manipulating devices, he'll help Two Face solve the greatest riddle of all- WHO IS BATMAN?  Enough about the viallains, now about the heroes.  A wicked hot psychytrist named Chase Merridian, (Nicole Kidam) whose helping in the case against two face develops a crush on Batman (not Bruce), and Bruce Wayne has one on her too.  Plus, Bruce has decidedto let an orphan named Dick Grayson (Chris O'Donnell) live with him who will later become Robin.  Dick's a former trapeze artist from the circus who entertained people with his talent along with his family.  Two face killed his family and is now bent on revenge to killing two face.<BR>That is basically the plot, now let me state why this should not be known as  a sequel.  First of all, this movie completely ignores EVERYTHING from the first.  I don't mean the mechanics such as Gotham City not being dark but Gotham city itself now looks completely different.  It's too gothic now, thee way too many statues of gargoyles and the city it self seems to have a different look then it used to.  Not only Batman himself is different.  First of all, his suit and gadgets seem a bit too high tech and his batmobile is also different.  His mansion looks different, so does the batcave, and last and most importantly, this movie totally ignores about when Bruce's parents were killed.  In the first Batman, it clearly stated that it was the Joker who killed his parents yet in Batman Forever, it makes it seems like it was a mysterious man who did Bruce still has no idea who it was.  This movie acts like the first two films never happened.<BR>Besides that, let me explain why this movie didn't come close Tim Burton's.  This movies tries so hard t be an \\"Awesome Batman Movie\\" by having lots of explosions, lots of guns firing, lots of CGI and has a cool soundtrack that it leaves out on what made the first 2 movies good and that is basically all the good mechanics.  Things like a dark Gotham City, serious characters and villains (in this movie, the villains are just goofy dorks), SERIOUS ACTION (This movie does have a lot of good action but a lot of it is cheesy and meant for little kids) and whatever happened to the powerful score music done by Danny Elfman.  This movie has a new score soundtrack which isn't as good. <BR>In conclsion, Joel Schumacher put Btman in the direction where it wasmeant for little kids to watch.  This movie isn't bad but no great.  We all know the real bad batman movie is Batman and Robin.  I know Schumacher seriously hurt the franchise with that movie but stop calling him a bad director cuz he isn't.  He made other great films since then such as Bad Company and Phone Booth so stop trashing him about Batman and Robin cuz that movie was made in 1997 and its 2004 so stop living in the past.
B00005JKCH|2.0|As a fan of Spiderman I was deeply let down by this stupid, gaudy, 'Hollywood' movie version. There are so many things wrong with it I could go on for ages.<br />First of all, it's HORRIBLY miscast. Tobey Maguire is NO Peter Parker, he is so completely wrong for the part. Jake Gyllenhaal could have been much better. Kirsten Dunst as Mary-Jane Watson seemed like a typical studio-exec choice. Instead of finding someone who could actually be a model/actress with a statuesque figure, real auburn hair with green eyes who could bring some integrity to the part we have ' the hottie from Bring It On who all the teenage guys like'. I personally do not find her attractive and her part in the movie is no more than 'the damsel in distress when necessary to the plot' kind. She's such a stronger character in the comic book and it's been totally ignored here. James Franco as Harry Osborne was useless. I've seen more charismatic performances from furniture. Willem Dafoe was okay as the Green Goblin but some of his dialogue was real bad, it felt like rejected Skeletor jibes from the original He-Man show. He did provoke some sympathy and coped well with the inner-turmoil story but I could not help but think that someone else could have done it better. JK Simmons and Bruce Campbell were the only bright spots among the whole cast.<br />27-year-old Tobey Maguire plays high school student Peter Parker. A 'boy' who is blessed with web-spinning capabilities after being bitten by a radioactive spider on a field trip. You guessed it, this is another 'origins of' story. I HATE it when comic-book superhero movies feel the need to do this. Honestly, who DOESN'T know who Spiderman is or how he got his powers? The fact that Spiderman is so popular (as a franchise) is the only reason this tawdry-looking movie was a hit. I would have had so much more respect for it if it went straight to the action and didn't waste time setting things up. No superhero movie is willing to do this and it only proves even further that Spiderman was cooked up and packaged in board room meetings.<br />As a way of disguising the fact that the whole thing is no more than processed cheese, eccentric director Sam Raimi was hired to direct. Known for his cheap but whacky movies Raimi had never really done anything big budget before this. The result is a meretricious, mess of a movie that is all over the place. I honestly thought I had walked into some Power Rangers movie.<br />The computer effects are, quite simply, hideous. Who are they honestly trying to fool with this stuff? It boggles the mind how they ended up with an Academy Award nomination. They are really, really bad. The Styrofoam shark in Jaws: The Revenge was more convincing.<br />Danny Elfman cranks out YET ANOTHER superhero movie score for this 'un. It's flat, boring and unimpressive. Aunt May is way too old. The Green Goblin looks like a Power Ranger. The direction is uncontrolled. It's got a poor cast. The story is nothing new or daring (check out the comic books for that). It's assembled by a boardroom committee, not crafted by people who care and it's just loud, dumb entertainment when Spiderman really should be much more.<br />The only part I appreciated was the way they made Spiderman's web biological instead of manufactured. It just makes so much more sense this way. Though there are loads out there who disagree with me.<br />The DVD is in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen (I seriously think this film would have benefited from and deserved scope-widescreen but no luck) and it looks better than average. There are some color problems and it doesn't look too crisp. The Dolby 5.1 soundtrack is typically loud and thumping but it's nothing particularly dynamic. There are quite a few extras if you're really that much of a fan. As I couldn't care any less for this film I can't comment.even further that Spiderman was cooked up and packaged in board room meetings. <br />As a way of disguising the fact that the whole thing is no more than processed cheese, eccentric director Sam Raimi was hired to direct.

0385504209|2.0|A conspiracy/mystery story written in simplistic, episodic fiction. It's touted to be (according to the back cover) \\"an exhilarating brainy thriller.\\" In fact, this book is simply horrible. The writing is as bland as anything I've ever read. The characters are as deep as a puddle of mud.<br />What's most disturbing are the factual inaccuracies, and this book is filled with them. It begins with the word \\"FACT,\\" and then seems to imply that everything in the story is somehow based on fact. But it's not, and Brown gets even simple things like dates wrong. For example, the Dead Sea scrolls were found in 1947, not in \\"the 1950's\\" as one of Brown's character's claims. Another example: One of Brown's characters says that in the non-canonical Gospel of Philip, Jesus refers to Mary Magdalene as his \\"companion,\\" which in the Aramaic language is synonymous with \\"wife.\\" The problem, though, is that the Gospel of Philip was not written in Aramaic but in Greek. The same character, Teabing, says the vote at the Council of Nicea was \\"relatively close.\\" Sure: 300 to 3.<br />An in-depth view of all the factual mistakes in this piece of trash can be found here: [...] with another good resource here [...]<br />The DaVinci Code is, in short, a waste of time. There is nothing good about the writing, and as far as the \\"facts\\" of the book go, about the only thing I would say is correct is the page numbering.
B0001BKAEY|4.0|Why are these Matrix movies not being released in DTS sound option format???? DTS is the ultimate sound option. Why is it not here?
B00003CXBK|5.0|What can i say about this movie hmm. Well. Ilike it cause IT IS GOOD. Cause constant violence has a contrast. Because animation is handdone hard work i respect that. Story is not corny. I consider artwork very original.<BR>Sure movie has a fair moments of upclose gore and some gore in the backgound, but many infect a lot of anime use blood. This is one of them, its not ment for kids anywho.<BR>Now back to nice parts, movie is very colorfull and generaly has a nice atmosphere. Animation is well done and like i said i like hard handwork true work of art. Not like some movies that abuse 3d with drawing which starts to ba alittle trend nowadays.<BR>Story is about a boy who kills some king bore big very big pig. It passes a desease on his hand so he goes of to find a cure before it consumes his brain kind of like cancer only this black thing on his hand will make him visious in a fight in the begginign when he goes to a journey and horsemen atack him his hand goes all messed up and his arrow took one horsemens head of ouch. On his travel he comes toa village and it is attcked by Mononoke girl who is against the vilagge which looks like a factory. Old fashioned nature versus techno i like that. Boy gets tangled in this &quot;ittle&quot;war. thats what basicly happened but there is more to movie than that old search for cure and save the forest morale. rent find out and dont be surpeised when in the beginign you will see an arrow go down in the pigs eye MHAHAHAAH BLOOD!!!just kidding(&gt;_&lt;)
B0001AP12G|5.0|This CD is one of the best CD's I own!  I had never heard of Kanye West, even as a producer, but I heard &quot;Through The Wire&quot; on the radio and loved it.  It turns out, that is not even my favorite song on the CD.  I seriously love every single song on this CD.  The first time I listened to it, I was feeling every song and didn't have to skip a single one.  Even the skits kept my spirits high.  Overall, Kanye West is one of the best producer/rappers out there, so go get this CD or you'll be sorry!
B000000OTY|4.0|Recorded live on his &quot;Secret World Tour&quot; in support of his 1992 album, &quot;US,&quot; &quot;Secret World Live&quot; is an excellent live document of this most gifted musical genius. With a brilliant backing band including guitarist David Rhoades, bassist Tony Levin, and an up-and-coming backup singer named Paula Cole, Gabriel is simply on fire. The bulk of the material is from the &quot;US&quot; and &quot;SO&quot; albums, but they're brilliantly performed, including &quot;Come Talk To Me,&quot; &quot;Blood Of Eden,&quot; &quot;Digging In The Dirt,&quot; &quot;Red Rain,&quot; &quot;Sledgehammer&quot; and &quot;In Your Eyes,&quot; as well as a rare Gabriel gem, &quot;Across The River&quot; (only ever released as a B-side). Gabriel &amp; company are simply marvelous in concert, with passionate performances and superior sound.The only debit is that a few songs from the tour were cut from the live album---no &quot;San Jacinto&quot; or &quot;Family Snapshot,&quot; for instance. But otherwise, this is a great live album from a most-great artist. Peter Gabriel's &quot;Secret World Live&quot; is a wonderful live set.
B0000033OZ|5.0|This was a stellar release, in many ways a synthesis of all the best elements of Nice and King Crimson, two of the members' previous bands.  The music incorporated many different influences and elements, including ballads, rock, classical, and touches of psychedelic.  Even the instrumentation was challenging, replacing the usual guitar-led lineup with dominant keyboards and early synthesizers.  Emerson Lake and Palmer were truly at the forefront of the evolution of popular music into a more mature art form.  This CD is both historically significant and still very listenable, even 30+ years later.
0385512104|4.0|I thought this was an amazing book.  Not since The Lovely Bones, have I been drawn so completely into the mind and world of another character.<BR>What I loved about this book, was that the author made no judgements of any of the characters, but simply allowed the drama to play itself out.<BR>I've had the honor and pleasure of working with autistic children, and what I learned, and I think what the author is successful in showing, is that there may be some differences in how autistic people deal with the world, but that we all have unique coping skills, and theirs are perhaps extreme, but maybe not as unusual as we would like to think..<BR>Take a chance - if you are an adventurous person when it comes to books, I don't think you will regret this journey!
B0000033P2|5.0|If ELP's previous releases were excellent, Trilogy was jaw-droppingly amazing.  Here it seems they truly hit their pinnacle, finding their unique blend of rock, classical, and even country-flavored (!) influences.  One of their most charming traits is their sly sense of humor, found in tracks like &quot;The Sheriff.&quot;  Their talent and musicianship were, by this time, sharply-honed from a regular cycle of touring and recording.  It is easy to see why they are still cited as an influence by some of the more interesting musicians recording today.  This album is frequently mentioned by fans as their favorite ELP album (usually in a close contest with Brain Salad Surgery, their next release).
B00005B36H|2.0|Let me start off by saying that until this album came out I loved TOOL's music. It just misses the creativity they posessed in the old days when they just kept evolving from 'Opiate' to 'Aenima' because they probably wanted to make a more commercial album. And this means that the music must sound less complex (too many notes, Mozart. Cut a few and it is perfect). And just what is going on on their site? I visited it lately and there is this Blair guy who just keeps talking about Crowley and the Rennes le Chateau-mystery (It's solved a long time ago: the supposed grandmaster P. Plantard who was in reality the son of a farmer who produced wallnuts, made the whole story up with a companion and forged the parchments himself, he confessed this after a fight over money with his friend de Chaurissey, money from Lincoln & co), and poses on pictures which he shows on the Tool site..it's a funny looking guy...who is he anyway??
B0000033TE|5.0|With &quot;Brain Salad Surgery,&quot; ELP reached new heights in defining popular culture as art.  They smoothly and successully integrated a variety of musical and cultural influences, and by doing so, created a new, dark vision for a generation.  The disc opens with a beautiful, stirring rendition of a classic English hymn, &quot;Jerusalem.&quot;  Bookending the album, the lengthy closing suite is a brooding, dystopic view of the direction the world appeared to be going.  Between the two, there is ELP's balanced blend of ballad, classical and humor.  On days when &quot;Trilogy&quot; isn't my favorite ELP release, it's usually BSS.
B00005UEAR|4.0|Dream Theater has never quite matched the heights they achieved with the classic &quot;Images &amp; Words&quot; from over a decade ago.  The closest they came, according to most fans, was &quot;Scenes from a Memory&quot;, the album before this offering.<br />Enter &quot;Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence&quot;.  An eclectic mix of songs, to say the least.  The album opens with a progressive metal masterpiece, &quot;The Glass Prison&quot;.  This is arguably Dream Theater's greatest purely metal song, with great riffs, varied and interesting progression, and a heaviness seldom found in the band's work.<br />The other songs on the first disc of this two-CD album don't quite equal the opening track.  They represent a competent if somewhat uninspired effort, and while they get tiresome after awhile, are still excellent songs.  This first disc suffers a little from &quot;wankfest syndrome&quot;, in that it does contain long, uninspired instrumental sections in some places.  The best example of this is the outro of &quot;Misunderstood&quot;, which essentially degenerates into Petrucci messing around with his wah pedal and seeing what kind of cool sounds he can make with his guitar.  A shameful conclusion to an otherwise excellent song.<br />The second disc is much better.  The songwriting is mostly tight, and it definitely sticks to a theme while remaining varied and interesting.  It's hard to pick stand-out tracks, because all but &quot;Overture&quot; and &quot;Goodnight Kiss&quot; are outstanding.  It's not quite as good as &quot;Scenes from a Memory&quot;, but the 45-minute 'song' (I say this skeptically because though it's organized as a medley, each track is clearly its own song) represents powerful and intelligent music that doesn't forsake emotions as some prog-metal bands--including Dream Theater itself, at times--do.<br />Overall, &quot;Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence&quot; is uneven at times, but a worthy album nonetheless.  This is Dream Theater through-and-through, and serious complaints as to its quality are unfounded.  Get this CD, but only after you pick up &quot;Images &amp; Words&quot; and &quot;Scenes from a Memory&quot;.

B0000033P2|5.0|When I heard ELP's first album, I thought it would be hard to match.. and it was, but Trilogy was truly inspiring and one of the best produced albums I'd ever heard. <br />Probably ELP's most progressive album, every track on Trilogy reaches a new height. \\"The Endless Enigma\\" opens the album in three parts and has an absolutely incredible final crescendo! \\"From the Beginning\\" is a beautiful acoustic track featuring Greg Lake that has really withstood the test of time and proved just how talented Greg Lake was as a vocalist, guitarist and bassist. It was the single from the album and hit the Billboard charts. \\"Hoedown\\" was taken from Copland's \\"Rodeo\\" one of my favorite pieces. Later on the ELP live album \\"Welcom Back...\\" Carl Palmer rips the lining out of this piece. The title track was largely instrumental, heavy on the synthesizers as is traditional for prog bands. Emerson's compositional and keyboard work on this album is truly among his best. \\"Living Sin\\" is among the best prog-rock pieces anywhere and shows Greg's incredible voice range. \\"Abbaddon's Bolero, taken from Ravel's \\"Bolero\\", is an instrumental inspiration and the gradual build-up of the synth gives a truly hypnotic climax.<br />I believe this album represents all the musical styles of ELP. Simply emotional, inspirational and lovely. Keith Emerson, Greg Lake &amp; Carl Palmer are truly amazing as far as sound, voice and energy. Besides all the hoopla regarding Keith Emerson's stage tactics, his musical talent is hard to match and his style is addicting. Greg Lake has the voice of an angel and the ability to play lead guitar just as wonderfully as bass.. I think Carl Palmer must be an alien cause I can't imagine anyone playing as fast and as furious as he does.<br />And to top it off, they were all three absolutely gorgeous!
B00000889Y|5.0|OFF THE BONE is the ideal Cramps compilation. 17 tracks of rabid Psycho-billy from the years before Lux and company lapsed into self parody.  My only complaint is that it does not include the sublime TV SET.  If this CD had turned up in Saddam's collection, W could have justified his WMD folly.  Oh well, Saddam seems to be a Yanni fan.

0792844882|1.0|...aware of the overwhelming critical howls this movie garnered, I decided to rent it of curiousity only after reading a recent review on Salon.com praising this film for becoming a &quot;camp classic&quot; and veiled social commentary.<br />Well, if you say so.  Elizabeth Berkley is the single most god-awful actress I've ever laid eyes upon, a study in constant overacting and limited facial expressions (she has about 3 of them)...she makes Madonna seem like Meryl Streep!  Equally appalling is that for someone who's supposed to be playing a stripper/dancer, Berkeley's wide, flopping and prematurely cellulite-ridden backside is almost as ludicrous as her acting ability---almost all of the supporting actresses and random extras are better built...and probably better actresses too.  Hell, Flipper the Whale could probably outact Berkley; she's so awful that I could barely restrain myself from throwing things at the TV screen.<br />Just about every character, every line of dialogue, and every scene in this movie is a cliche that we've seen a million times before in a million different TV movies, soap operas, especially lousy B-movies, and cheesy Hollywood blockbusters.<br />Maybe Verhoeven/Ezterhas, who brought us the far better &quot;Basic Instinct,&quot; really did intend this film to be one big campy joke...regardless of whether one buys into that revisionist viewpoint, this film requires either a strong stomach or copious amounts of alcohol/marijuana/hallucinogenics to get through!  Bleh.

B0000C7PSW|4.0|I first discovered Rufus while searching for the author of the &quot;Hallelujah&quot; song from the movie Shrek.  When I figured out it was Rufus, I listened to his first two albums and thought he had a great &quot;piano feel.&quot;  I agree with other reviewers that Rufus has a very nasally sounding voice.  His voice is much purer on Want One than his previous two albums.  The nasal voice takes some getting used to, but once you are able to stop concentrating on it, his music begins to consume you.  I just saw him in concert in Las Vegas on February 27, 2004.  He is by far best when performing live.  That &quot;nasal sound&quot; seems to disappear in concert, and he is a gifted performer.  When Want Two comes out, if he is in your area, go and see him live.  As for Want One, although I do not think it is as good as Poses, I still recommend it.  It is truly unique, the lyrics are magical (yet difficult to understand, which makes them interesting), and the songs seem to address the struggle in life.  If you are looking for good &quot;therapy music,&quot; I would highly recommend this album.  It has helped me through some very hard times.
B000003TAW|5.0|As far as modern rock is concerned, this album is pheonomenal. I first heard this album as an adolescent and remeber imedietly identifying with Weezer, even though I hadn't yet cultivated a true appreciation for the music or the lyrics. As a suburban middle-class white Gen-Xer, I can recognize the message that this band of suburban middle-class white kids is presenting. The songs are simple yet are eerily familiar, not only because of the simple chord progressions and melodies, but because of Weezer's uncanny ability to create music that is very easily accessable to an audience that it focuses on. Weezer is a strange group that I identify with, for my tastes generally lie in the genres of jazz and blues. Although intricacy is an element left relatively absent within this album, the essentially understated messages and subliminal musical creations leave an impression with every listen. Similar to Pink Floyd's Animals, this album, stripped to the bare minimum, proves the idiom that less is more. With the help of Car Ric Ocasek, Weezer was able to create a masterpiece of the ordinary elements of everyday life. A musical dissertation on the TV generation, this album strikes as much of a chord as JD Salinger's &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot;, with it's adolescent prose and catchy flow. As much as Nirvana, an essenial for those whose history lies in the nineties.
B000000WA4|5.0|&quot;Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness&quot; avoids the pitfalls of many double albums -- too much filler, too few good songs, not enough of the good stuff. Instead, this is in the spirit of the Beatles' &quot;White Album&quot; or Pink Floyd's &quot;The Wall.&quot; Billy Corgan's tight writing and the Smashing Pumpkins's brilliant instrumentation make this sweeping double album a must-have.<br />The first disc, &quot;Dawn to Dusk,&quot; builds up slowly with a mournful piano song, only to bounce into the sweeping &quot;Tonight Tonight.&quot; Forming the rest are sizzling rockers (&quot;Jellybelly,&quot; &quot;Zero&quot;), sparkling softer songs (&quot;Cupid De Locke&quot;), and quiet alt-rock (&quot;Galapagos&quot;) and a few songs that stray into unknown musical turf (the sweeping ten minute &quot;Porcelina of the Vast Oceans&quot;). &quot;Take Me Down&quot; ends the first disc on the same quiet note that it began on.<br />Second disc &quot;Twilight To Starlight&quot; starts off on a very different foot. Jerky guitar riffs and drumming start off, sounding like a warm up, before exploding into the solid &quot;Where Boys Fear To Tread.&quot; Having gotten that over with, Corgan and Co. switch into a somewhat quieter collection: gentle acoustics (&quot;Thirty-Three,&quot; &quot;Stumbleine,&quot; the sweet &quot;In the Arms of Sleep&quot;), catchy alt-rock (new-wavey &quot;1979,&quot; &quot;Thru The Eyes of Ruby&quot;), blistering hard rock (&quot;Tales of a Scorched Earth,&quot; &quot;XYU&quot;). The gentle &quot;Farewell and Goodnight&quot; rounds off the double album on a quiet note.<br />&quot;Mellon Collie&quot; has just about every kind of music you can hope to find -- ballads, prog, metal, alt-rock, and so on. A handful of songs feel superfluous, but the vast majority of them just feel like a musical quilt. That is, two musical quilts. The tone of each disc is quite different, with &quot;Dawn to Dusk&quot; being a rockier album more in tune with the past Pumpkins releases. &quot;Twilight To Starlight&quot; has a more experimental, sad feel.<br />Billy Corgan's reedy voice weaves seamlessly into the complex music, singing songs about loneliness, pessimism and longing for love. His songwriting is exceptional here (&quot;breathing under water, and living under glass...&quot;); his style is best described as poetry set to music.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|During the course of it's television run, I probably was only able to watch three or four episodes, but yet, I still spent $40 on the DVD, and couldn't really explain. I found it as a unique and refreshing series, and I was drawn in buy the whole space-western atmosphere. I just wanted to know more about the characters as quickly as possible. I think its great to see a futuristic show that doesnt necessarily have to include aliens or the sterile effect of Star Trek, but instead shows the opposite qualities of man on the frontiers of space. The biggest attraction that keeps people watching is the creation of a different world. Its almost like one big inside joke, that fans can watch episodes and pick up on the little extras embedded in each scene. Also, viewers can appreciate the structure of each epidose, and how it shows short, middle, and long term story lines, which is rare in TV today.<BR>For first time viewers, if you can bear the initial, overwhelming experience of hearing chinese blurbs and new words (&quot;shiny&quot; and &quot;gorram&quot;), and can enjoy the western dialect and clever dialogue, then you can sit back and let the story do the rest. Everything, from the music, to the characters, and even the ship, make for an enjoyable experience.It's really not hard to enjoy Firefly once you can believe in the world.
B0001FR3IQ|3.0|I knew very little about this movie so I didn't set my hopes up too high.  I was fairly disappointed with the movie though.  The storyline was extremely confusing and jumps around quite a lot.  Halle Berry &amp; Penelope Cruz are both fantastic in the film.  The story is about female psychiatrist Miranda Grey(Berry).  She wakes up as a patient in the asylum for the criminally insane where she works and finds that she is being charged with the murder of her husband, which she has no memory of committing. As she wrestles to regain her memory, she finds that she is the pawn of a vengeful spirit.  I wouldn't say that it was bad, it was just confusing.
0440237688|5.0|In The Giver the reader meets a young boy named Jonas who lives in a utopian community of harmony, peace and contentment. No one is hungry, no one is unemployed, all have shelter and security.<br />The reader follows Jonas as he goes through a very important ceremony. Upon turning twelve, all boys and girls are given their lifetime job assignments. Jonas is bewildered and astonished to learn that he has been selected for the prestigious job of the new Receiver of memories.<br />As Jonas receives the memories of the world from the old Receiver, now called the Giver, several astonishing truths become clear. Jonas's community is peaceful and content, but this peace comes at a steep price. The Giver's memories open Jonas's eyes to a wonderful new world of weather and color and love that the community is totally ignorant of. With the awareness of these joyful things Jonas must also learn of the horrors of starvation, agony and war.<br />When Jonas learns that the baby his family unit has been caring for has been scheduled to be killed, he must decide, based on his new wisdom and knowledge, if he can find a way to save the life of the baby he has grown to love.<br />In this Newbery Award Winning utopia (or is it a distopia?) Lowry excellently reframes the eternal question of safety versus the freedom to choose for oneself. <br />This is one of those books that hits you like a ton of bricks, and then sticks in your head for days. Very thought-provoking and well done. One of my personal favorites.
B00005JMSE|3.0|Hell boy was a good movie but had WAY to much FX which kinda got me into bordom but an alright flick.

This movie had great looking monsters.  I havent read the comics but it looks good though.  I might check it out.  The movie had lots of huemer.  Lots of action, Lots of fx makes this an alright flick.<br />Over all its a movie you should check out.
B000002NFM|4.0|I havent listened to this CD since probably '98~'99, but recently dug-it out... O MY GOD that's some funky sh%t! ;) <br />Like a previous reviewer mentioned, the bass AND the overall feel of the album <BR>seems to be heavier than in Jilted Generation, but I <BR>think this is a positive. Looking back, to me it seems that this<BR>was the case with most EDM. Heavier bass with more oompf and<BR>dare I say more realism started to slowly work its way into <BR>electronic music over the years. I could be mistaken however...<BR>I also want to point out that Liam did employ guitar samples in <BR>some tracks in Jilted: &quot;Their Law,&quot; &quot;Voodoo People,&quot; and a little <BR>bit in &quot;No Good.&quot; In fact, one of the characteristics of Prodigy <BR>that I noticed when I first started listening to them/him, <BR>was the use of more &quot;popular&quot; instrumentation and sounds, which<BR>probably had something to do with their &quot;mainstream&quot; appeal.<br />Overall this cd is pretty relentless and if you're not a total <BR>freak or on meth you might not be able to listen to it all the <BR>way through in one sitting/dancing (of course I've been listening <BR>to a lot of chill-out lately). The only negative that I can <BR>see with the album however, are the last two tracks, and <BR>especially the last one, &quot;Fuel My Fire.&quot; They seem out of <BR>place and Flint's (?) vocals in this song are admittedly <BR>annoying. Take the last two tracks out and you have a 5-star <BR>album. <br />Despite the minor aforementioned criticisms, I would<br />recommend this CD if you are looking for an all-out adrenalin-fest ;)!!

B0001FR3IG|4.0|GOTHIKA is a whodunit with big doses of psycho-drama and supernatural trappings.  Halle Berry is great as Miranda Grey, the woman falsely accused and determined to prove her innocence.  <BR> The major players here, Berry and Robert Downey and Penelope Cruz, are so strong you're able to overlook the plot holes and inconsistencies.  There are a LOT on inconsistencies, most revolving around how easy Berry finds it to get in and out of her locked cell.  <BR> The movie has a nice grey and blue look to it.  It feels a little surreal and oppressive.<BR> GOTHIKA slickly manipulates us into suspecting a number of characters of the crime Berry is accused of (we never believe it's her, of course.)  It works well until near the end, when the real killer is exposed.  It might have worked better if a few clues had been sprinkled in earlier in the movie, making it a little more plausible.<BR> Limp Blizkit's music video &quot;Behind Blue Eyes&quot; and a commentary by the director and the director of photography is included.  Liked the video, turned the commentary off after about 15 minutes.

0385504209|5.0|Read it one riveted session -- with a bucket of beer and chicken and snow on the ground outside. Many readers have found Brown's metaphysical thriller an over-cooked and contrived tale, with much promised and little delivered -- but I say he's a very clever story-teller, with a canny knack for strange detail.<br />For the sake of all those disappointed souls, may I suggest a book that far exceeds expectations. It's called IN THE GHOST COUNTRY by Peter Hillary -- it's an adventure story, a ghost story, a psychological thriller and a shock-filled memoir by a famous person, all in one. It absolutely knocked my socks off.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I'm puzzled as to the previous reviewer's remark that Firefly was 'tedious'. I think it is a reflection more of the reviewer's short attention span than anything, and sadly indicative of why Fox canceled this show---too many people these days don't have the patience or attention span to get into a tv series that is well thought out, with an evolving story line.<br />I actually would rank Simon (the doctor giving up everything to save/help his sister) to be one of the LESSER interesting characters because his motivations and intentions are clear (admirable, but clear). There are two characters (Book, the preacher, and Inara, the 'ambassador') whose motivations/history are only alluded to over the course of the series. The hints to who they are are subtle and tantalizing, and forces the viewer to start thinking for himself/herself. To me that makes them, adn the entire series, interesting---not tedious.<br />Perhaps the reviewer was expecting something different from the misleading Fox promos? &quot;A space hooker and a girl in a box&quot;? I suggest that pornos might be more suitable if reviewer was.
1400031001|5.0|Boyd is undoubtedly one of our best living writers, and is my favorite writer of fiction.  Any Human Heart is quite simply wonderful.  Boyd has given us a completely believable diary of a complex, interesting, and flawed man, Logan Mountstuart, who lived through most of the 20th century. Mountstuart's life story is filled with highs and lows, loves, struggles, triumphs, intrigues, and most importantly a resilence of the heart. The story compels the reader to reflect about what's really important in life, as Mountstuart does more and more as the story unfolds. Mountstuart's life is told with great sensitivity and thoughtfulness.  Mountstuart experiences many of the important events and changes of the 20th century, and this backdrop adds yet another interesting layer to the story.  Boyd's immense talent as a writer lies in his ability to produce great literature through a highly compelling and fascinating story, often with a historical backdrop. Other books by Boyd that are also terrific include The Blue Afternoon, An Ice Cream War, Brazzaville Beach, and The New Confessions.

The windows in the living room of the gray house are wide open patiently exchanging the tainted inner atmosphere of liquor and smoke for the fresh drowsiness of the late hot dusk. There are dying flower scents upon the air, so thin, so fragile, as to hint already of a summer laid away in time.\\"<br /><br /> This is the story of a young couple Anthony and Gloria Patch living out their days to the hilt in New York City as they await the death of Anthony's grandfather, Adam Patch from whom they expect to inherit his massive fortune.<br /><br /> Gloria is a spoilt child from Kansas City turned into a sophisticated and most beautiful woman. Gloria does not intend to lift a finger to do any domestic work in the home, no matter how slight; while Anthony who considers himself an aesthete, finds it quite hard to get his act together and instead of buckling down to some work, prefers instead to hang with his wife and their friends on nightly binges. They drink and eat in the classiest restaurants and hotels, rent the most expensive apartments, travel out to the West in the spring time driving plush cars, wearing top-of-the-line clothing and just generally living it up high on the hog, as they wait.<br /><br /> Meet Maury Noble who is Anthony best friend who spends his time between New York and Philadelphia; Richard Caramel who has just completed writing a book and looking for new ideas for a second one. Joseph Bloeckman from Munich who started out small in America and is now a big shot in Show Biz. Also the quiet Jewess Rachael Barnes and Muriel Kane who is young, flirtatious and sometimes a bit too talkative and Tana the Japanese housekeeper of the Patches.<br /><br /> We are shown the Patches at their very best as the novel starts, with the world at their feet and loaded with cash with which they make very expensive choices. But, as we get further in, we see things begin to change gradually and we realize that those very choices will be their very downfall. It was quite a good read but it could be very heartbreaking at times as we put ourselves into the shoes of the main characters. All lovers of F.

B00003CXA4|5.0|Should the Academy of Motion Pictures ever choose to select the greatest films and performances of the 20th ca, I'm fairly certain \\"Gandhi\\" would be in the top 5 Best Movie nominees; but there is no doubt Ben Kingsley would win for Best Actor.  <br />Kingsley would not win based on his acting ability alone, although few (if any) in the industry's history have been better.  Richard Attenborough was clearly a driving force, a superb filmmaker who spent decades crafting and refining this movie.   Another force was the Indian people themselves, who become enraptured with Kingsley, lending believability to the speeches and funeral scene and enhancing Kingsley's performance.  But the greatest credit clearly goes to Gandhi himself, whose meditations upon Hindi and Christian and Islamic principles crafted a philosophy of non-violent non-cooperation that brought about the peaceful independence of all Southeast Asia and prevented civil war.  <br />When you bring talent like Kingsley's and Attenborough's together with the content of Gandhi's life, you cannot help but have a masterpiece.<br />Kingsley is the lynchpin to this movie.  Beyond his visual resemblance to Gandhi, the physical movements, the subtle tonal inflections, and beyond the incredible range of emotion and passion Kingsley brings to the screen, his portrayal of Gandhi through 5 distinct phases in his life are what make his performance monumental.<br />We start with Gandhi a young man, mid 20's, working as a lawyer in South Africa.  He is treated unfairly and thrown off a train (in retrospect, one of the biggest blunders ever made by the British Empire).  The first phase, then, is the young lawyer outraged at injustice, unclear how to direct his outrage but with a firm moral base.  As the film progress in South Africa, we see Gandhi become a strong leader, with the principles of  non-violence resistance taking form and outrage directed against specific unjust laws. Here the young Gandhi is a man of outward passion.<br />Gandhi accomplishes his goals in South Africa and returns to India.  The Indian Congress sees him as a potential leader, but Gandhi is unsure about the innate morality of independence.  Under the recommendation of Gokale, he travels throughout India and observes the injustice to the masses, not just by the English but by radical and violent Indians themselves.  He gives his first powerful speech to Congress, chastising them for not understanding the plight of the masses.  Here begins the second phase - the fight for independence not for political reasons, but for moral reasons.  His outrage is directed at the general injustice of foreign rule, not simply one law.  Again fiery, his passion is redirected against injustice in general, and he begins general campaigns against British industry.<br />His first major crises occurs when violence erupts, killing 21 policemen.  Gandhi realizes that independence can only come about if dignity and self-determination are restored to the people, and that violence restores neither.  So where almost surely independence would have come to India 20 years earlier than it eventually did, Gandhi stops the campaign.  He is immediately arrested.<br />Upon release, Gandhi looks inward to realize that nonviolent acts directed against something does not in itself restore dignity, but upon the restoration of dignity people will non-violently refuse to be treated unjustly.  Gandhi marches to the sea, where he encourages the masses to make salt in direct violation of British law.  The British are powerless - the Indians will not fight, they will not capitulate, they will not cooperate, and the government falls to pieces around them.  This is the third phase - the fire is turned inward with the realization that the fight is not against a foreign power, but to restore dignity within ourselves.<br />Independence comes, but at a price.  While the masses maintained nonviolence in their struggle against the British, it proved impossible to maintain against the deepest religious fears and bigotries.  Violence erupts, thousands die.  Greater India splits between India and Pakistan, and the nations teeter on all-out war.  Here is the brief fourth phase:  That all he had accomplished was meaningless.  The fire is gone from Gandhi, he is a defeated man.  As he states, \\"I cannot stand to see the destruction of all that I have fought for.\\"<br />In this horrible setback is the final transformation, where Gandhi transcends from leader and teacher to a true Saint.  He begins his last fast, a fast with conviction in his principles that reverberate throughout India and Pakistan.  With his fast he conveys that his principles were not just to gain independence, not just to gain the easy and desirable goals - they were the principles of God, God's Way.  The fire that had burned all his life was now buried deep inside but cut like a laser in his surety of God's Law.  <br />\\"Eat!  I am going to Hell...\\" a distraught man tells him, \\"...but not with your death on my soul.\\"<BR>\\"Only God knows who goes to Hell.\\" Gandhi replies.<BR>\\"I KILLED A CHILD!  I SMASHED HIS HEAD AGAINST A WALL!!\\"<BR>\\"Why?\\"<BR>\\"They killed my son.  The Muslims killed my son...\\"<BR>\\"I know a way out of Hell.\\" Gandhi replies.  \\"Find a small child, a little boy, whose parents have been killed, and raise him as your own....<br />...Only be sure he is a Muslim, and that you raise him as one...\\"<br />Gandhi's fast stops the violence and ends the civil war.  In this final phase, Gandhi is no longer the leader, the fighter, the outraged.  He is simply God's messenger, bringing His Way.  Kingsley portrays these transformations subtly and convincingly, so that we are lost in the story of the man, forgetting we are watching the portrayal of a man.  That is what makes this movie so great, and Kingsley's performance the greatest of all.
B00005JKG7|4.0|This is one of my favorite movies, I watched it alot as a kid (and was scared many times by my Mom, which helped matters). The movie itself is in great quality. A huge step up from the VHS that I've watched for years. If you haven't seen the movie, it's one of Carpenter's best. Behind only Halloween on my list.<br />It's about a small coastal town gearing up to celebrate it's 100th anniversary. But, what they don't know is the story that lurks under the fog (pun intended :)) and the horror that is about to unfold. As the film continues, we meet Father Malone, who is a vital part to the story. We also meet Stevie Wayne, a radio broadcaster who starts to realize what's happening with the fog.<br />It's a great film, I highly recommend it. The DVD doesn't contain a whole lot of extra stuff, but it's enough to satisfy. The movie itself looks great and the sound is wonderful.

What Lynch did so well in Mullholand Dr., Antonioni does so well here. In addition, this boasts some of the best music ever put on film.

0385424736|5.0|The Rainmaker is the story of law student Rudy Baylor. Throughout the book, you'll be told his story and the story of his client, Dot Black.<br />His story begins towards the end of his time in law school. As the days pass until graduation, he is dropped by the firm that was going to hire him. Problem after problem arise, until he is helped out by his friend (and very dirty friend) Prince. He helps Rudy get a job with Brusier Stone, your typical evil lawyer, that you actually like. You know, that old story. Anyways, as the story unfolds, Rudy meets a co-worker by the name of Deck. They slowly become friends and the two gain a trust, something that doesn't come easy at the law offices of Bruiser Stone. Meanwhile, things are dug up about Bruiser and he and Prince ditch town.<br />Throughout the story, we'll hear the other tales of Miss Birdy Birdsong, Rudy's temporary landlord and yard boss. As well with the story of Cliff and Kelly Riker. Two very key elements to this book.<br />When it gets right down to the nitty-gritty of the case against the evil insurance company, Great Benefit, Rudy goes head to head with Mr. Leo F. Drummond...a very, very mean lawyer. Luckily for Rudy, he's got a judge that is on his side and helping him through the case. He's just graduated law school, you know. The book goes through the humorous testimonies and mishaps of Great Benefit and Drummond.<br />As far as the characters go, you really begin to love and feel for the characters. Especially Dot Black and her dying son, Donny Ray. As the story unfolds and you read on through Donny Ray's story of how Great Benefit denied him treatment time after time, it makes you want to get up and cuss out your insurance company.<br />The story is thrilling at times, but is very predictable when it is. It relies on humor more than anything, as it is a very funny book. The quips and one-liners really strike a chord with you. All in all though, it's a great book. Definitely a must read.
B00005JKGZ|5.0|There's no question in my mind this is one of the greatest movie musicals of all time. I loved it as a kid, I love it as an adult, my children love it. Steven Speilberg obviously loved the it (at least the Halloween segment) and, as the DVD shows, others loved it enough to attempt a TV sitcom based on it. It's one of the few movies that still brings me to tears and I think mainly because of the main theme that your family is more important than your job, your house or even your own dreams. The dvd is filled with extras, many of which I haven't even had a chance to check out yet. Buy it!!
B00003CXB2|5.0|Near the beginning of the film, Lawrence touches a lit match to his skin.  When asked how he does it, he responds, \\"The trick, my friend, is not minding that it hurts.\\"<br />About 2/3 of the way through, he finds himself in a desserted outpost.  From far away, a soldier calls out to him from a boat, \\"Who are you?  Who are you?\\"<br />These two lines define the film about a man that could never define himself.  It has been described by some as the last great epic, but the movie is less an epic than it is an exploration of one man's identity, torn between East and West, the lush gardens of England and the deserts of Arabia.  Not directly addressed but hinted at is Lawrence's sexual ambiguity, including his sadomasochistic tendencies.  No one can know who Lawrence is, the man behind the legend, because he doesn't know himself.<br />The vivid cinematography and Maurice Jarre's haunting score brings to life the vast and ever-changing desert to the point that it becomes another character, one more friend or foe for Lawrence's.  The movie must be seen on the big screen to truly appreciate it.<br />A lyrical exploration of one man's struggle--with others, with nature, and with himself--this is not a story about the hero that all men would like to be, but a portrait of the complex man who wishes to play the role of legend.
B000002AVF|4.0|It was 1995.Mariah wanted a different sound was tired of doing the same thing over and over again.In other words,she wanted to peresent herself as sort of a music genius,yet wanted to sell millions of records at the same time.Mission accomplished.Mariah achieves making one of the most influental albums of the 1990's,and sells more than 10 million copies in the U.S. alone,and it's all thanks to Daydream.Mariah put more work on this album than she has ever put on any previous album she's done,and there are so many pros it's hard to count.Let me start with them:<BR>1.More Diversity.Mariah has more balls on this album than ever before,genre-wise.Some examples of this are &quot;Fantasy(one of Mariah's most critically acclaimed songs)&quot;,&quot;Underneath The Stars(one of Mariah's best love songs)&quot;,&quot;Melt Away(co-prouduced by Babyface)&quot;,and the hip-hop flavored &quot;Long Ago&quot;.<BR>2.More Collaborations.Mariah also joins up with people more than she had ever done with Daydream,including legendary R&amp;B group Boyz II Men(Mariah's biggest #1,&quot;One Sweet Day&quot;),Jermaine Dupri(the saccharine in a good way &quot;Always Be My Baby&quot;,&quot;Long Ago&quot;),and Babyface(the sensual &quot;Melt Away&quot;)<BR>3.Lots Of Records Made.I know this one sounds superficial,but you can't help but love an album that has made Billboard history,right?This album's songs have made a lot of history,from having the first ever song by a female artist to debut at #1(&quot;Fantasy&quot;),to &quot;One Sweet Day&quot; having the most ever weeks on top(16,to be exact),this album has made it's mark,commercial-wise<BR>4.She Doesn't Oversing Her Ass Off!Sure,Mariah overdoes it a LITTLE bit,but she still doesn't belt out in the beginning of the songs like she used to.She takes her time on these tracks,especially in &quot;Melt Away&quot; where she coos her way through most of the song until she can't take it anymore and finally overdoes it,but only a LITTLE bit!<BR>5.Her Love Songs Have Matured.I don't wanna be mean,Mariah,but back then,your songs sound like they were written by a high schooler!I'm glad that Mariah's love songs have matured and now,not only teenagers can relate to the songs,especially the '50's inspired track &quot;Forever&quot;.<br />There's not too many flaws here,except for two things:WAY too ballad-heavy(what do you expect,it Mariah!),and she does overdo it vocally on some of the songs(i.e.,the worst song on the album and the worst cover she's ever made &quot;Open Arms&quot;)<br />So,as you can see,I definitely recommend this album to you.This is Mariah's best effort,and she doesn't come up short,but you have to buy the album to 100% agree with me!

B000000I3O|4.0|I've never been a huge Misfits fan, but I went ahead and bought this cd beacause I knew it had some of their better tracks. She, Hollywood Babylon, Bullet, Horror Business, Teenagers From Mars, and Vampira are some of the better songs on the cd. Songs such as London Dungeon, Ghouls Night Out, Mommy Can I Go Out And Kill Tonight, and Die Die My Darling just plain rip. This is a good cd but I wouldn't spend alot of money on it so try to find it cheap.
B000002C25|5.0|Don't believe the backlash, and believe the hype, Be Here Now is monumental.  Seventy-three minutes of musical marathon is exactly what the Gallagher Bros. wanted to do after reaching the pinnacle of popularity with Morning Glory.  Oasis still has a huge cult following and the true Oasis fans know they are the best rock band of this generation.  Be Here Now is massive, plain and simple, and the songs take you through a roller-coaster ride.  The opener &quot;D'You Know What I Mean?&quot; sets the tone and the rest of the album feeds off its strength.  The hard rockers, &quot;My Big Mouth&quot;, &quot;I Hope, I Think, I Know&quot;, &quot;Be Here Now&quot;, and &quot;It's Gettin' Better (Man!!)&quot;, are spaced out throughout the album to provide an up-down tempo pattern.  The mid-tempo rockers include Noel sung &quot;Magic Pie&quot;, &quot;Fade In-Out&quot; with Mr. Johnny Depp on slide guitar, and &quot;All Around the World&quot;, the latter of which is nine minutes and twenty seconds long and one of the most ambitious songs to date.  Then there are the ballads &quot;Stand By Me&quot;, &quot;The Girl In the Dirty Shirt&quot;, and &quot;Don't Go Away&quot;, all three are great, the hook in &quot;Dirty Shirt&quot; is amazing and infectious.  The other track is the final track on the album, &quot;All Around the World Instrumental&quot; that ends with Noel's footsteps walking down a hall, and ending with him slamming a door shut, very symbolic as it was the end of an era for Oasis, as they entered into a more grown-up and musically talented stage.  Any way anyone looks at it, Be Here Now is a phenomenal album, and Oasis living the rock and roll dream at the peak of their popularity.  Any music lover will appreciate it's grandness.

B0001I55OC|4.0|While it has been a while since I have read the book, \\"Timeline\\" was just one of those stories I truly enjoyed. The movie, while omitting some parts of the novel, actually follows the general plot of the book. A few changes are made to the beginning and end, but overall the actual storyline is similar to the novel. Many of the parts cut out of the book are actually parts that, given the cast, are better left out. The majority of these scenes involved the character Chris, played by Paul Walker. Luckily, the movie does not make him the main character like he was in the book. The less screen time of Paul is definately better. My favourite character in the book, Andre Marek, is excellently portrayed by Gerard Butler and he saves the film from being completely worthless. Anna Friel as Lady Claire as well as other supporting characters are also great performances.<br />I understand why many would not like the movie since there are many others in a similar genre. For me, I have never really been into these kind of movies and while I am an avid Crichton reader, I did not read this book when it came out due to it's subject matter. When I finally decided to read the book on a flight, it became my second favourite next to \\"Jurassic Park\\". This was the first film I really saw about medieval times, and even though the movie could have been better, I enjoyed it. I think this was because I love the story so much and the movie was not a total detour from this story.<br />A few points to make that many people seem to nit-pick about:<br />1. The fact that they changed Chris' character to be the son of the professor instead of his student is not a big deal. Also, I don't see why it isn't plausable that he could not be the son of a Scottish professor just because he is American. This is the stupidest argument I have ever heard since I know many people who are American and have foreign parents!<br />2. Yes, the fact they spoke American when they went back in time was definately unplausable, however, I would have preferred this than to see subtitles the whole movie. This was made from a sci-fi novel, it was not mean to be an ultimately realistic or overly historically accurate movie. They should have kept the earpieces from the book in though to explain it.<br />Overall, I really like the movie, and think people should give it a try. While it's definately not perfect, it is fun and keeps fairly true to the book.
B00006879E|5.0|I happened to see the video for &quot;harder to breathe&quot; on Fuse a few months ago, and I instantly went to iTunes to find out who this band was, since I started watching the video a little too late to see the credits.  Once I figured out the name of the song (which was pretty easy since at the time it was the top downloaded song) I listened to 30-second clips of the whole album and I fell in love with it.  All of the songs are very catchy and I don't skip over a single track when I listen to these guys; and I skip over at least one song on almost every album I own.<BR>I've seen a few reviews where people complain that Maroon 5 sounds too much like a boy band, and I don't really understand the analogy.  The only time I notice anything remotely like this is the fact that on some songs Adam sounds a lot like Justin Timberlake, which is in itself not a bad thing.  Plus, this is an actual band of musicians, not a bunch of singers who need other people to come in as their band for the instrumentals.<BR>This is a very well-produced album as well; I don't typically like the slow songs on the albums I buy, and even the slower tracks on &quot;Songs about Jane&quot; are catchy and maintain my interest.  <BR>&quot;Songs about Jane&quot; is a great album to take anywhere: on the drive to work it gets me going; at the gym it's great and upbeat and gets me up to speed on my workout, and it's relaxing in a way to listen to it at work since it's so enjoyable.<BR>Some may argue that the band pretty well plays it safe on everything; nothing is really objectionable.  I suppose I would agree with that; it appears to me sometimes that they pretty much stay &quot;in the box&quot; to not be upsetting to anyone.  But even though I really appreciate music that makes statements and is bold and daring,  sometimes it's just nice to listen to up-beat, well-made music that is just a diversion from life's problems, and &quot;Songs about Jane&quot; does exactly that.  I  guess this may be theboy-band analogy that people come up with. However, pretty much all boy-bands have the a pre-fabricated, calculated feel.  &quot;Songs about Jane&quot; does not have this feel; they're just a band who seems to really have a good time doing what they're doing and they're not afraid to show that rather than the angst that is shown on so many albums these days.  Sure, it has been said that true art comes from great suffering, and on many levels I agree with this philosophy.  But if a band makes a great album from being happy is this a bad thing?<BR>I really hope that this band does not suffer from the &quot;sophomore jinx&quot; that so many initally great bands suffer.   This is a really amazing band and I want to hear more from them in the years to come.<BR>A highly recommended album, no matter what your typical musical genre preference may be.

B00005Y7L4|4.0|Certainly one of the most original and impressive movies of the last years, &quot;Battle Royale&quot; presents an intriguing premise and a superb execution. In a near future, the Japanese Government concludes that the downfall of the country is increasing due to the shallowness and free spirit of its youngsters. In order to make kids more motivated and capable, a special unit sends a high-school class to a desert island where the students will have to kill each other until only one survives. If they refuse to do that, they all will be killed within three days. <br />Yes, this is a far fetched concept, still it works surprinsigly well and manages to be a superb comment on the grim, hopeless and desperate atmosphere that surrounds modern societies. &quot;Battle Royale&quot; isn`t an easy movie to watch, since some parts are truly shocking, gut-wrenching and unexpected, yet it`s a strong and memorable cinematic experience, different from most of the disposable and formulaic flicks around. It expertly mixes drama, tension, horror, action, humour and gore, managing to be compelling and consistent throughout. <br />The character development is good enough, but it`s hard to develop so many characters (around 40) at once. It`s interesting to see how people react when they have to face such an extreme situation, acting under fear and suspition while dealing with their schoolmates. &quot;Battle Royale&quot; could easily have turned into a violent and empty sequence of action numbers with cool camera angles, but it wisely avoids that perspective and instead creates a gripping, multi-layered and complex narrative. <br />This is a superb effort that approaches key subjects like the first steps into adulthood, the conditions of love and friendship, trust and commitment, loneliness and individualism, future choices, totalitary systems and life in general. A gloomy, dark and ambiguous achievement, this Kinji Fukasaku effort delivers a surreal social commentary with some incrediblyclever, poignant and creative ideas.<br />An unforgettable battle.

B00005BJ2O|5.0|This movie was one of the best movies ever created. Although confusing for some, the music really made the point stand out. The lyrics give away the movie but, make it all worth while. they flooded soo much emotion into their songs. Ewan Mc Greggor and Nicole Kidman have true set chemistry and their voices blend magickally.

B0001BKAEY|1.0|The first Matrix movie was a great movie for a number of reasons. The second was pretentious and boring but occasionally interesting: generally a good movie. The third is dreadful: derivative, unimaginative, predictable, inane, insipid and strange as it may sound---boring. The ending, particularly Neo's fate, is predictable. The philosophy is juvenile. The action is incessant and ridiculous. Why not kill the humans with poison gas or biological weapons? (because there would be no endless boring fight scenes). The only thing I'll say about the acting is that the actors checked out long before the move ended with the exception of Jada. And how/why did Lawrence F. turn from a sleek intense fighting machine in the first movie into a hesitant overweight schlub in the third? Why is there even a third movie? Can you spell m-o-n-e-y?<br />The W brothers took two movies (or less) worth of content and made 3 movies. It shows.
B00004TJTQ|5.0|I cried at the end of the film, it was so sad when his dog dies. I also cried when he hit skip. The story is about a newborn puppy skip who is bought by a childs mum on his 9th birthday, when his dad sees him the puppy gets taken off him but when she manages to work round him, the puppy grows up into a loving family he does the house hold plays games and loves willie his owner. The dog grows up and when the boy is older he goes off leaving his mum dad and dog to go and work on a career. Soon the dog dies with arthritus and old age, and that is very sad. LOVING SAD AND FUN FOR ALL THE FAMILY.

B00013F38K|5.0|I have seen only the first episode on Side B, but I am amazed at how meticulously this 1970s' Western series has been enhanced for widescreen high-definition televisions.  The print is crisp and clear enough for cinema lighting, and there is abundant evidence that the cropping was truly a labor of love. It is a real treat when food for the mind is such a sumptuous visual celebration.
B0000039QA|4.0|This album is just mind-blowing. While many love this album, I still feel Biggie's Ready to Die tops this by a long shot. Don't get me wrong, this is a classic but on Ready to Die, he spoke more truthfully. While Ready to Die focuses on the realities of life, Life After Death is more of a party album (similar with 2Pac's Me Against the World and All Eyez on Me). Biggie's rhymes are still tight (as usual). They fit so well with the excellent production (even though I absolutely HATE P. Diddy and Bad Boy Records). The way Biggie flows is somewhat different and is excellent. I like the way he sounds, bit of a slushy sound which makes the album even better. Everyone is familiar with the well-known Hypnotize, I'm just surprised it didn't turn up in the Top 151 Rap Songs of All Time in The Source. I mean, this is not just any song, it's the ULTIMATE party track of ALL time! Whoever produced this song really knows how to make GREAT party beats. I was so blown away when I first heard this tune, Biggie comes out clean here. DJ Premier of Gang Starr appears to produce Kick in the Door which does not disappoint one bit either. Mo Money Mo Problems will definately get your feet tapping, a great remix of Diana Ross' I'm Comin' Out.  Disc 2 is the disc I enjoy more, however. The infamous Notorious Thugs starts the disc off well, with one of my favorite rap groups, Bone Thugs N Harmony. Biggie shows off his fast flow here and does a pretty damn good job. I also like Bizzy's verse as well. Miss U is my personal favorite off the album, I just instantly fell in love with the tune the first I heard it. Dedicated to Biggie's homeboy, this is a very emotional track and has the same feel as 2Pac's Dear Mama. Nasty Boy is one of the few letdowns on the album. I don't know what Biggie saw in Lil' Kim. Personally I don't like Lil' Kim's music, she talks too much about sex (don't get me wrong, sex is good but really, is there any point to rapping about sex the WHOLE way through your album? Coz that's what Lil' Kim's Hardcore seemed like to me!) Skip this track. Other highlights are Playa Hater, Sky's the Limit, Long Kiss Goodnight (which has always been rumored as a 2Pac diss) and the dark and eerie You're Nobody. My Downfall is a good song but DMC singing the chorus really annoys me. Overall this is an album to really add to your CD rack if you really want to be a TRUE rap fan.    Biggie rose to the top in late '93- early '94 and fell in '97. And for what? For being so successful? What is with people these days? First we lost Eazy, then we lost 2Pac and then Biggie was shot. If those idiots didn't shoot such legends, rap wouldn't be so boring (as it is now). Biggie was a man who lived up to his name, he WAS bigger than life. And nothing, not even death, can stop him from being the King of the East Coast.     R.I.P. Biggie.    Best moments= Hypnotize, Kick in the Door, Mo Money Mo Problems, Notorious Thugs, Miss U, Goin Back to Cali, Playa Hataz, Nasty Boy, Long Kiss Goodnight and You're Nobody (Til Somebody Kills You)

B000024D4R|5.0|This is a great cd, far by one of their greatest works
B000001DQI|5.0|In my opinion this is the best of the John/Taupin collaboration.  <br />At what is still the most prolific period for the two of them, it seemed they couldn't record the music fast enough.<br />The result of this was the Goodbye Yellow Brick Road double album, which encompasses a broad range of material that is very strong from beginning to end.<br />Many people overlook some of the lesser known tracks that didn't get a lot of radio play, which is too bad, as they are some of the best material Elton John has ever recorded, and are what make this release so good.<br />A must have recording for the Elton John fan!
B00008H2LE|5.0|As soon as I started listening to this CD, I was blown away.  It was amazing! I wasn't sure they could outdo Hybrid Theory, but I sure think they did.  <br />The foreword didn't make sense, but it's probably just me.  My favorite songs are Faint, Figure 9, From the Inside and Session.  Session is great mixing,record scratching and instrumentals by &quot;Big Bad&quot; Mr. Hahn.  Nobody's Listening is a cool rap song, and for that reason doesn't make sense to have Chester sing(he's still awesome).  Breaking the Habit doesn't sound like Linkin Park (there's no rapping or strong guitars).  <br />Even with those exceptions, I think the other songs make up for them and Meteora is actually better than Hybrid Theory.

B00008EY9G|3.0|Interesting thriller.  I knew something was unusual about it when it came out but I didn't see it until it showed up on cable.  I really like the cast and I think the writing/directing keeps the viewer on track throughout the Twilight Zone-ish ending.<br />Actually, I found two endings: there's the warm fuzzy ending where someone is spared the death penalty.  And then the final ending that says something about the nature of evil.<br />I'd recommend it for people who like big twists like those found in THE SIXTH SENSE or FRAILTY.
B0001CCXZW|2.0|This warm and simple story, spiced up beautifully by a great cast of quirky characters and rapid-fire reparte makes for a very rare category of television viewing: intelligent but fun.

0385504209|2.0|Really fast read.  Great airport book.  Pick it up, get interested, and have something to read for the next couple of hours. But it's full of NOTHING.  There area few tid bits that are fun food for thought, but even those are run over an over and over again like a bad joke.  The two main characters are experts on symbols and codes...but you wouldn't know it unless you had been told.  Every other line is &quot;It was so easy, I should have seen it before!&quot;  Then the bad guy...it sounds like Dan couldn't figure out who he wanted for the bad guy until he was forced to show him.  Awful.  Most of the book was sitting and listening to information.  Lecture lecture lecture.  RUN FROM THE BAD GUYS.  Lecture lecture lecture.  RUN FROM THE BAD GUYS.  Lecture lecture lecture.  And most every chapter ended like this...&quot;It's time I tell you the trueth.&quot; Then you would have to wait  four chapters to find out.  That's how Dan infuses a book with suspense that wouldn't normaly have any.
B0001BKAEY|4.0|I waited 5 months after it was released to actually see The Matrix Revolutions. It's ending had already been spoiled for me byt people talking about it at school and that just made me not want to go see it at the theater. about 95 percent of the people I talked to who saw it did not like it at all and said that the series had been ruined. Then others said it was amazing. But i knew it was something I had to see for myself. I was almost convinced i was going to hate it, but when i did see it  three days ago, I found that i enjoyed it more than the first movie and found it to be equal to Reloaded...yes I liked Reloaded better than the first. Describing each key sequence would take too long, but the Sentinel/APU battle in the Dock and the Smith/Neo fight are two of the coolest action scenes the trilogy has to offer. Captain Mifune proved to be one of the coolest minor characters, as did Seraph. This movie can be enjoyable if you allow it to be...but if you sit there wanting to hate it, then you are going to. Free Your Mind.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|I finally got to see Lost In Translation last night.  Not having read or seen the hype, I expected nothing in particular though  Bill Murray has long been a favorite. <br />From the opening, the film is gripping. Tokyo plays a glitzy starring role and is given its due from the cinematographer who should have received awards -- and perhaps did.<br />Far from being boring, the film's greatest pleasure lies in watching the characters slowly reveal themselves. They are alternately touching and extremely funny. One's heart melts for Bob, Murray's character.  <br />I waited for a crummy, formula ending, but no, Coppola and the scriptwriter didn't yield.  The ending is touching and perfectly in character.  It would be hard to give this movie any fewer than five stars.
0140277447|5.0|A well written narrative that is sometimes hard to stomach - definitely not for the squeemish.  Some very hard facts to face about the terrible things that human beings can do to each other in times of war.  300,000 killed in only a few weeks!  Appalling atrocities committed!  It's time for the Rape of Nanking and the terrible things that happened during the Japanese occupation of China during World War II to be seen as a tragedy on par with the Holocaust in Europe. How anyone can deny these terrible things happened is beyond my comprehension.
B0001I55OC|5.0|I've read the book tons of times, and while every little<br />detail wasn't brought out in the film (which would have<br />made it around 6 hours long), the spirit is there.<br />Basically : TIMELINE was the best film of 2003,<br />I saw it just before ROTK came out and believe<br />me next to timeline, return of the king sucked.
0385504209|5.0|If you take this book as a work of fiction, then you are in for a fast paced rollercoaster ride.  I can see why this might offend some hardcore religious people.  As a Roman Catholic who happens to be half Italian, I would urge you to read this book.  When my grandmother died she left me a copy of the painting of DaVinci's &quot;Last Supper&quot;.  After I read the book I studied the painting.  Remember this is entertainment and it does get you to think outside the box.  I don't agree with all of the theories put forth in this book, but I do find them very intersting.  It really makes you ponder how you learned about religion.
B0000013GT|5.0|These two southern rappers should be the role models for any aspiring mainstream rappers that still wanna keep their credibility. They've reached the highest peak in their careers and still can't be labeled as sell outs. They give it to you live, raw and real. They in it for the love of the craft, not the love of the bling. I mean, you can't say nothing about any of their albums. If you don't like them, then it's probably too deep for you, you don't like rap period, you can't relate to their lyrics, or you're just strictly a east coast or west coast rida and won't mess with nothing south. So no matter what you say, you can't front on their clever lyrics and bouncy & catchy beats. I just can't see it. Look at the reviews for this CD, for God's sake. At the present time, 108 people reviewed this CD and there were only 2 negative reviews. (One didn't count because even though they gave it 1 star, they still praised it in their written review). You understand what I'm saying? I can see if someone wouldn't like this album, but it could be only personal taste. Cause this CD is a perfect Rap album, closed case. What more can I say?     I'd give their other albums Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik 4.5 stars, Aquemini 4 stars, Skankonia 5 stars, and their solo efforts Speakerboxx/Love Below a 4.5. But this album still is their masterpiece.
B000068R1X|1.0|This review is of the second Bark At The Moon remaster, released in 2002 along side the rest of Ozzy's catalog predating Down To Earth.  Though Blizzard and Diary feature new drum and bass parts, Bark At The Moon was completely remastered using the original session tapes.<br />Or was it...?<br />I bought Bark At The Moon when it came out, and it was a great recording and very influential in it's time.  But Bruce Dickerson's remix is missing major signature solos in Rock N' Roll Rebel, both in the opening licks, and in the breaks.  This is one of the most renowned tracks from Bark, delivered in an incomplete state on this &quot;remaster!&quot;  The only explanation is that Jake E. Lee recorded his solos over the stereo master in the final hour, and they couldn't be extracted.<br />But it gets worse: You're No Different&quot; was full of keyboards on the original recording, but they are super loud on this CD, drowning out the drums and guitar.  It's as if Dickerson just ran the session tapes without checking the volume of individual instruments. It defies explanation, truly.<br />If you haven't heard Bark At The Moon before, you may not notice these omissions. You'll just think it's a record made on the rebound of Randy's death by a weaker band.<br />But Jake E. Lee held his own with Ozzy, and if you dig for earlier releases of this recording, you'll discover an album that stands up to Blizzard and Diary.<br />This is sonething else...
B0000AQVCL|3.0|The lyrics are simple and insipid and the band's ripping off of other artists (ACDC, the Kinks, Iggy Pop) is so blatant.  However, these guys totally rock!  I enjoy it as a guilty pleasure, I guess. I just hope they don't take themselves too seriously.
B00018D44U|1.0|I absolutely loved Norah's debut and expected great things from Feels Like Home but it turned out to be a typical Sophomore slump. The songs are bland and lifeless and it did not leave me inspired as the debut did.<br />Buy this album if you own a dentist's office and you'd like to help your patients relax.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Joss Whedon, who has done such a brilliant job with 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer', and the spin-off 'Angel', came up with something really new and unique with 'Firefly'.<br />This is the non-Star Trek: a completely new and different kind of Sci-fi, a universe with no aliens, just humans who have NOT learned to feed the hungry or create a perfect government...far from it!  There is a huge Military/Government/Corporate power which is trying to stamp out the Independents (the Brown Coats).  Our 'heros' are trying to live below the radar, to find a life of personal freedom.  <br />I recommend these DVDs to anyone who loves driving trips (or getting out on the road on a bike), people who have always longed to 'ride the rails' or jump a freighter (my own personal secret desire), to live outside of society.  These stories will appeal to young and old, men and women, who love freedom and an independent life!
B00005JKGZ|5.0|Meet Me in St Louis has to be my favourite Judy Garland film. I'm so glad that it is on DVD after all this time! The film really is a pure joy to watch for all ages. The special features on this DVD still amaze me - especially the short film &quot;Bubbles&quot; which is a rare opportunity to see Judy Garland at age 7. The only thing that disappointed me a little is the quality of the film - I can't tell the difference between this DVD version and my VHS version. Definitely a must have DVD.
B0000C8AQM|5.0|Hey! Now I know i should stick to the album content, but it cannot be fully appreciated without seeing the film. And I stress: seeing the film first. see it see it see it. It's mindblowing, because the songs carry you through it. From the opening to the credits...MY GOD!! you simply must enjoy it..it's hypnotizing. Rock at its best. Even the people who are only half into rock will suddenly see clearly into this vast space of FREEDOM and begin unconciously tapping their feet to the ground.. see the film listen to the music...and suddenly everything will be so clear...
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly is a breath of fresh air with its innovative storyline and ingenious writing.  The cast is among the best ensembles in television history, talented actors and actresses, good looking, and deeply invested in their character and the show itself.  With flawless special effects in just the right amount, brilliant costume and set design, an impressive soundtrack, and captivating stories, you'll understand why more and more people are joining the ranks of Firefly fans.
B0001HAHXW|2.0|Of the many Clapton personaes in existence, this is not the worst of them, but it is the most disappointing.  Fans of Clapton's rawer, truer blues and blues rock (especially from his earlier years), already know not to buy most of the studio albums, but we are always waiting for him to put out the &quot;real thing.&quot;  If that is your Clapton of choice, you will be very disappointed by this over-produced, under-performed attempt to make the blues as accessible and commercially viable as possible.  <br />If you would like to hear the blues/rock album this could/should have been (at least in feel and performance) - you MUST check out Buddy Guy's album, &quot;Sweet Tea.&quot;  Go to that album NOW.  Listen to the samples, buy it, and lose yourself!!
0448060191|4.0|I first read Little Women in elementary school, and enjoyed it so much that I read many of Louisa May Alcott's other works. Precisely why I decided to pick it up again at age 24 is unknown to me, but the reread was well worth it.<br />Alcott tells the story of the four March sisters--Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy--as they grow into young women. Each girl has her faults, and they struggle to overcome them. They also must face the consequences of the family's poverty as well as separation from their father, who is serving with the Union Army during the Civil War. The book is told in episodic fashion, with many chapters acting almost as short stories complete with crisis and resolution. The sisters act appropriately for their time as well as display the sibling rivalries and affection present in most families.<br />Reading Little Women as an adult, I realized just how moralizing it is. The March girls learn important lessons from nearly every event in the book. Beth is elevated to near-sainthood even before she becomes ill. But, other than the preaching, I found Little Women to be a thoroughly enjoyable read. I might just pick up Little Men again one of these days.
B00005YW4H|5.0|One of my favorite CDs! It's rare to buy a CD and like just about every song. Her voice is mezmorizing and beautiful, and her music is different than all of the other popular music on the radio.
B000089RVX|1.0|I am not sure if the album is a work of genius or a real knockoff. But I don't have much respect for the band or their label's (Wind Up) marketing Department. They Trample all over one set of fans to reach a bigger market. Smart, but evil.
B000002J0G|5.0|Testament have not stopped kickin' ass with punishing beats, crazy solos, and killer licks ever since their 1987 debut, &quot;The Legacy.&quot; Testament decided in 1994 that it wouldn't be a bad idea to make a slight change in their sound. Although the results were not as strong as &quot;The Legacy,&quot; &quot;The New Order,&quot; or &quot;Practice What You Preach,&quot; they were successful, and an improvement over their previous two releases, &quot;Souls Of Black&quot; and &quot;The Ritual.&quot; The success led to a continuation of this sound on their next two albums, &quot;Demonic&quot; and &quot;The Gathering,&quot; which were not as strong as Low, but still pretty damn good.<br />Here's how I would describe the sound. Take the guitar sound from from &quot;The New Order&quot; and the bass playing from &quot;The Ritual.&quot; Fuse them together with the traditional drumbeats and some very Morbid Angel-esque vocal segments (including one tune that, with the exception of the chorus, is one big segment of that type), and you have the basic sound of the album.
B000008CX0|1.0|Wow, the previous reviews literally scare me. People liked this album?? Is this some sort of mass collective joke?<BR>I love Annihilator, I have all their albums, and listen to them constantly, but this album has remained shelved for many, many years. Absolute pure junk.<BR>Let's start with the obvious problems. Number one on the list is Coburn Pharr, who can't sing period, let alone sing good metal. What Jeff was thinking when he hired this &quot;wanna-be&quot; I'll never know.<BR>Second, the album is pop metal. While some of the guitar work is still awesome, the songs lack any &quot;metal&quot; to them. I never once replayed a part to hear it again cause it was so cool. Something I did do on their equally disapointing King of the Kill.<BR>Then there are the lyrics which went from awesome and fun on Alice in Hell to silly and just plain stupid.<BR>Luckily Jeff went a different way with this band, and dumped Pharr.<BR>Alice in Hell (their first album) was a thousand times better than this, the third effort, even Set the World on fire, and equally pop metal like album, was better having some really great metal songs as well as some truly fun songs and having at least a decent singer.<BR>The two new albums Carnival Diablos and Waking the Fury absolutely rule and if you're looking for the same thrill you got when you bought Alice in Hell, get them now.<BR>Skip this disaster, the closest to sell-out album, Jeff and the band ever got.<BR>One thing though, I have to admit the song, Phantasmagoria absolutely rules. Note though that it was written before even Alice in Hell. Unfortunately for this album, it was also released with Bag of Tricks featuring Jeff's vocals, which are far superior to Pharr's hoarse vocal strains.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|This is one of the best soundtracks I've heard in a long time... possibly the greatest one ever.  Kristin Chenoweth is an amazing talent with an extremely impressive vocal range and excellent comedic timing.  Idina Menzel has an incredible voice as well, and her performance throughout the show is amazing.  These two leading ladies fill their roles with such passion and spirit, you forget you are watching or listening to Kristin and Idina- you feel as if you are truly seeing and hearing Glinda and Elphaba.  The only word I can think of to describe this show and its soundtrack is &quot;Amazing!&quot;
B0000AFQS0|5.0|Whatever the hell it is the Who play, it isn't rock. It's not. The musical tapestry spanned in Townshend's song writing is far too broad and varied to pigeonhole it with a genre label. His father played the music of his time. Townshend himself fell in love with the R&amp;B singles that made their way to Britain from America. His mentor, Kit Lambert loved pop but also carried the influence of his father, Constant Lambert, a composer who worked in film and theatre. Lambert also loved the Baroque and Classical styles, all of which he passed on to Townshend. Townshend has his own ideas. All of it shows. This is not music of any one genre-it's a genre unto itself. But, when the Who plays it, it becomes rock.<br />When they play it on stage it becomes the greatest and most powerful rock music imaginable.<br />It was no surprise (not to Who fans anyway) that their DVD release from the fall 2000 show at the Royal Albert Hall was one of the most celebrated concert videos from that year. The band was firing on all cylinders on the 2000 tour and played at a level closer to what they achieved during their glory years than they'd ever managed since Keith Moon died. That alone was enough to put then back at the forefront.<br />The &quot;Kids are Alright&quot; shows what it was like in the first place.<br />It was the oddest of musical relationships. With the exception of the friendship between Moon and Entwistle none of them really liked each other, at least not in the early days anyway. Townshend's temper was enough to keep anyone away and everyone hated Roger. It reached a head in 1965 when they tossed Roger out for beating up Moon only to realize (to a man) that they were throwing away something that might go beyond anything any of them could imagine. It was their Waterloo and it happened before any of them passed twenty-one.<br />It produced greatness.<br />The Who had what it took to go places, always; everyone in the fold knew that. When they made that commitment they took it beyond what anyone could have dreamt. Throughout their (active recording) career they never followed a formula,  never stopped pushing musical boundaries, and, in concert, always tried to do better than &quot;last night&quot;. They became the most astonishing rock band ever to step on the stage.<br />This film concentrates on showing that.<br />It doesn't preach. There's no narration going through historic details. There's not even a chronological order to the piece. All it does is try to show the Who, and the ingredients that formed their magic to the world. The live footage is electrifying. The interviews are illuminating and hilarious. How could anyone (or anything) contain Keith Moon? How could an interviewer ever hope to step into the middle of the way the core group constantly challenged each other? They couldn't. This was four strong personalities merged into something larger than life. Their relationship wasn't harmonious but an outsider stepping into it found found themselves confronted with, the whole. When they stepped onstage that &quot;whole&quot; was what audiences got. Jeff Stein has been criticized for just &quot;putting what was around&quot; together. That's crap. Jeff Stein is a brilliant film maker who had the sense to let his subjects speak for themselves. That shows all the way through the film. You get the music, a sense of who the band are and a great sample of why their performances are the stuff of legend.<br />How much more is needed? Get it.it beyond what anyone could have dreamt.

B000002JPA|5.0|It is not often that you can listen through an album without having to skip some filler songs along the way.  Well, Images and Words is a gem.  Kevin Moore is a keyboard wonder along with LaBrie(vocals), Petrucci(guitars),Myung(bass), and the drum master Mike Portnoy. I love everything from the heavy &quot;Pull Me Under,&quot; to the soft &quot;Wait for Sleep.&quot; Each song is played with crispness. Though this was released in the 90's it is actually great. Mainstream music these days is sloppy and not thought out. I am glad that these muscians actually care about quality.
B00005B36H|2.0|First off I agree with a music Fan from Kether by stating that Lateralus is highly under par from the band's previous efforts. <BR>Too much overstated lyrics and it totally lacks any encouragment of audience participation. <BR>That said I would like to focus my attention on an frequently recurring phenomena by the name of Blair McKenzie from toolband.com. This selfproclaimed armchairmagician continues to amaze me of the amount of selfdeification he has shown us by totally ignoring any valuable Tool (This means the band without mister Blair) news and instead chooses to show us his photographs of barbecueparties he has attended wherein he tries to appear as Crowley behind his altar with an beer in his hand as his magickal weapon. Besides photographs he has used the site as an auction for his Crowley firsts, if not it was clearly his intention. Finally, he continues to enlighten us with his crowleyesque poetry wich he clearly has emulated and I wonder if he himself understands their meaning. <BR>I hope anyone reading this review finds it helpful enough so that in the future he will ignore any outbursts that Blair might produce and shun his theatrics as centers of pestilence.

B00005JMEW|2.0|I loved this movie, okay, let me get that out of the way. But they are such sneaks. In order to get more money from the general public, they will be releasing several versions of both volumes once they are all on DVD. I have seen the volume one DVD and it had the worst features. Don't waste your money on this and wait until the ultimate version comes out.
B000001BX0|4.0|Very political, very heavy, very interesting. I like the strength of the guitars on some songs, while in others is more like a smooth balance of lyrics and music. The songs are powerfull, insipred by mexican pride and lots of complains about the government, which is the reason why these record has being banned in so many places. None the less it will be a classic.<BR>I like Gimme the Power and Matate tete the best.

B0001AP12G|5.0|The first time I saw the name Kanye West was on The Diary Of Alicia Keys. He of course produced the wicked track 'You Don't Know My Name&quot;. So obviously when i heard he was dropping an album i rushed out to buy it. Simply put the album is off the hook. he uses all the themes used by almost every rapper and gives it a new feel. He spits about Jesus, Guns, Drugs, Girls, and makes it feel all so new. My favorite track is Never Let Me down a collabo with Jay-Z and Common. All in all this album is history in the making. It is a must get. Kanye West is an up and coming Hip Hop Master...if he's not one already.

B0001DI0FI|4.0|This has to be the single most historically accurate film made about any high seas adventure that I have ever seen. Now, that is not to say the PLOT is historically accurate, b/c it is completely fictional. However, the representation of life at sea is absolute perfection. The battle scenes are extraordinarily realistic, fast and furious. Many boats contained young men or children, as this movie portrays. Battles on the high seas were either excessively protracted, or brutally short, depending entirely on the range of the fighting. Everything this movie shows is historical perfection. Some may find it a little slow, but for anyone with even an iota of patience, Master and Commander is very much worth the price of admission.
B0001HAISG|5.0|I saw this movie a long time ago, but I still think its one of the best movies I've ever seen. My friend was so jealous at the end when Jeremy kisses Rachel Hurd-wood that she started screaming and was kicked out of the theater. I think its overall a very good movie and should be rated even better than 4.5!
B00004SW9R|5.0|I've owned this album for many years now, I consider it to be one of the most raw & unique albums ever recorded. It makes you feel as if you're sitting in a run-down New Orleans shack watching a voodoo ritual. Tunes like Cris-Gris Gumbo Ya Ya, Danse Fambeaux, Jump Sturdy & the ever so haunting I Walk On Guided Splinters makes this album a must have for any eclectic music fan. <br />If you ever have the chance to play it for some drugged friends, do it! And watch the expressions change as they steadily get more and more freaked out as the album progresses, ultimately climaxing on I Walk On Guided Splinters. The third \\"'Ti Alberta\\" seems to trip people out the most, ask them if they see any spirits too, it's a nice touch. <br />Anyway, go buy & enjoy the fun spookiness that is Dr. John's Gris Gris.
B0001CCXY8|5.0|I found this to be a great cd form  the band. This is the most technical effort put forth yet. This sparked new veiwpoints to this band. The wretched shows the improvement of the band or the last decade. With better songwriting and musicianship.<BR>In my my oppion &quot;decency defied&quot;, &quot;festering in the cyrpt&quot; and &quot;bent backwards and broken&quot; are the highlights. a worth listening release.<br />P.S dont say this review is helpful or not.

B00000JGHM|5.0|Heat is truely an incredible movie.  It depicts the life of two men.  Al Pacino, who plays the troubled cop, and De Niro who plays the stern and unbroken master thief.  Although they are polar opposites by their carrers, Michael Mann, the director, trys to show the audience how alike they are.  This movie is truely based on these two characters.  This is shown during the coffee scene.  Also, the the way Mann looks into the criminal and police &quot;lifestyle&quot; is not only deep, but correct.  The music, the plot, THE CHARACTERS, and the filming is beautiful.  This is my favorite film.<br />Rated R:  This movie contains some scenes of violence, (including an immence LA shootout) and very bad language.
B00008H2LB|4.0|I think Hybrid Theory is better then Meteora. But Meteora has a good flow to it. The songs are slower then the ones on Hybrid Theory. Like, easier to run, somewhere i belong, from the inside, and numb. Well I don't wanna say slower, the right words would be slow and hard. Everyones heard &quot;numb&quot; it's kind of slower but hard, right. Personally my favorites are &quot;Don't Stay&quot; &quot;Hit the Floor&quot; &quot;Faint(all the way, best song)&quot; &quot;Figure.09&quot; &quot;Session&quot;

0345409671|5.0|This is modern mythmaking at its finest. In the first three books of her  Vampire Chronicles, Rice reinvented the vampire for our times. She made them human, made them see their reflections in mirrors, and made them us. I always admired how she managed to commercialize homoeroticism and criticique the Catholic Church ... all the way to the NYT bestseller list. Tale of the Body was sweet, touching change of pace after the epic climax of Queen of the Damned - and didn't prepare me for Memnoch the Devil. <BR>Memnoch is an absolutely ingenius reimagining of JudeoChristain doctrines and texts. Most amazing of all, she came up with cosmic explanations that make far more sense than any of them. Growing up Catholic, the concepts of Heaven and Hell never seemed convincing or logical, and the idea that Jesus HAD to die on the cross for our sins never made any sense at all.  THIS version makes much more sense. (And the crucifixtion  moved me to tears.)<BR>All in all, WILDLY IMAGINATIVE, STUNNINGLY AMBITIOUS, EMOTIONALLY SATISFYING. A TOWERING ACHIEVEMENT.
0195145925|2.0|The essential idea from Julian Barbour's book is that the laws of physics can be formulated in such a way that time does not enter explicitly into the equations. If we accept this idea for the moment (and not all physicists do), the question then becomes: is making time disappear in this way just a mathematical trick, or does it lead to better physics?<br />Barbour has taken on an especially difficult task in trying to explain these esoteric concepts in a work of popular science. The book doesn't succeed, in my view, and the most I can do here is give him credit for trying. My negative review does not reflect any disagreement with his ideas - it is up to his peers in physics, not me, to decide whether he is on to something or not. I just don't think he's succeeded in putting his ideas across to a general audience. The book is so wordy, and its exposition so plodding and foggy and vague, that it is hard to imagine that most people would get much out of it.<br />I really don't like to write negative reviews, but sometimes they can be useful in steering readers away from books that are likely to frustrate and turn them off. Barbour is a respected physicist, an original thinker, and an interesting person, whose life trajectory has taken him far from the typical academic career. But I really hope he'll take on a co-writer, somebody who knows how to write clearly and informatively about popular science, on his next book.
B00004Z459|5.0|Many people say that Linkin Park revolutionized nu-metal. I don't think that's true. But, Hybrid theory is a great album and is worth buying.<br />Song Listings<br />1. Papercut-A great introduction for the album, cool bridge. 7.5/10<BR>2. One Step Closer-The hardest and loudest song on my album. May be my favorite by LP. 10/10<BR>3. With You-Cool electronic introduction and then goes into a rock piece. 8/10<BR>4. Points of Authority-Some rapping in this song, but has a cool intro and outro. 8/10<BR>5. Crawling-One of the most famous songs by them. Personally I don't like it as much and think it's a bit overated. But I do like the xylophone thing. 7.5/10<BR>6. Runaway-I like how it starts off with the cool sound part in the beginning then goes into the rock part. Good to listen to if you &quot;wanna runaway&quot; 9.5/10<BR>7. By Myself-An underrated song, a cool bridge. 8/10<BR>8. In the End-Everyone's gonna hate me for this, but it's not my syle either. I don't like Crawling, In the End or Numb, weird. I do have to admit that it has thought provoking lyrics and a cool piano. 7/10<BR>9. A Place for my Head-One of my favorites by LP. A cool gutair intro and chorus. It's probably most known for it's screaming &quot;You tried to take the best of me, go away!&quot; 9.5/10<BR>10. Forgotton-An also underated song. One of the harder songs. 8.5/10<BR>11. Cure for the Itch-It sounds pretty cool but there's not much to say about it. 4/10<BR>12. Pushing Me Away-Cool song, nice lyrics, a good ending song. 7/10<br />I don't give many albums a five star. Hybrid Theory is and will be one of my favorite albums.
B000003TA4|4.0|Regardless of the way you see it Nevermind is one of the most innovative albums ever. By combining the underground grunge sound, with catchy hooks and riffs this album can easily be loved by anyone with a music taste, even if your not into rock. &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; is probably the most catchy song on the album, although not necessarily poppy it seemed to have been made for the public eye. But seriously every song worth listening and is a great rock album that broke out of the underground. It wasnt really the definition of Nirvana though, &quot;In Utero&quot; seemed to sound more like Nirvana but this isa great album nontheless.
B00005JN1L|1.0|(...)Based on a short story by Stephen King, the film revolves around a straightforward concept, Johnny Depp's peculiarity, and an utterly predictable script. It masquerades itself as a psychological thriller, while in fact it's just another pay check, just another PG-13 thriller. Count the number of times the f-word is mentioned - it's fun to do in those films. And the level of violence, too (even though a dog does get stabbed in the head, as well as three other people, ooohhh....) \\"Secret Window\\" is a plodding, assured testimonial to all twist-ending-PG-13-star-studded-stuff out there.<BR>  The plot involves a novelist (Depp in nerdy glasses), who isolates himself in a cabin deep in the woods. He talks to his dog, and the `highlights' include him trying to quit smoking (really, is there subtext in that, or is the director just throwing out another clich, and ponders it, like there's no tomorrow?!) A creep called Shooter visit's the novelist one afternoon, claiming the writer stole his story. John Turturro's understated, thickly accented performance feels out of place, as if he walked in from a better film. From that point on, Shooter periodically appears, sinister stuff happening in-between his visits. To unnecessarily complicate the plot a little, Koepp throws in a little history, involving the writer's ex-wife (Maria Bello), who is now married to another eerie and suspicious character (Timothy Hutton, welcome back!) <BR> The thrills are half-arsed post-\\"Sixth Sense\\" cliches (opening windows, creepy noises). \\"Secret Window\\" also wins the award for the most predictable ending. As if Koepp realized that 90% of his audiences will guess the outcome within the first 15 minutes, when they are palpably distracted by unnecessary characters, he added an ending with an obvious homage to King. It involves lots of corn, and basically describes the movie.<BR> I was going to give \\"Secret window\\" a generous two stars, for the film at least sustaining a mood more-or-less effectively with some tricky imagery, and for Depp's performance, which, despite lacking his usual stimulation, manages to hold the film together nevertheless...But no, it's time to stop being generous, and for David Koepp to re-watch \\"Apartment Zero\\" before attempting another directorial undertaking.

He made 1 solo album before forming The Bleeding Heart Band using session musicians from The Wall and Final Cut together with Clapton. With the new band he made a film, a concept album, a live benefit concert double album, and one last huge studio album between 1986 and 1992.<br /><br />The core of this new band was Graham Broad on drums, Roger Waters on bass and vocals, and Andy Fairweather-Low on electric guitars, usually strats. Female vocalists had become a part of Waters' sound texture during the first solo album and they remained a vital part of The Bleeding Heart Band sound. Katie Kissoon and Doreen Chanter did most of the backup vocals from the start and Katie is also in this concert.<br /><br />No songs from the first two efforts by The Bleeding Heart Band appear in this DVD, which is a shame. Their first release was the soundtrack to When The Wind Blows in 1986. Their second was Radio KAOS in 1987. However, when they toured in 1987, they played most of the Pink Floyd songs that are covered here. There are bootlegs of that tour, but as most fans know, the other former Floydians were promoting their own album and playing these same Floyd songs in their concerts and that was a very successful live album.<br /><br />The biggest success for The Bleeding Heart Band came when they staged The Wall Live in Berlin. They released an album, a single, and a DVD. They do cover some of those songs here. Snowy White, who plays a gold Les Paul Standard throughout this DVD, covered the Gilmour leads in the Berlin concert.<br /><br />The Bleeding Heart Band recorded its last studio album, Amused To Death, in 1992. Four songs from that album are covered in this concert. This concert is from ten years later. During those years some members of the group had joined Clapton's band. Another odd slowhand connection is the young guitar player on this DVD, Doyle Bramhall II, the son of Stevie Ray Vaugh's drummer, who is now also in Clapton's band.<br /><br />Each Small Candle seems to be the swan song of The Bleeding Heart band. For a few years now they have been telling us that this song and others (they have released demos of two) will be part of a new album. Some parts of the new album were reportedly recorded during the rehearsals for this DVD.<br /><br />Other audio/visual treats from this group are: When The Wind Blows (animated), Radio KAOS videos (shows the band playing in a sound booth), and The Wall Live in Berlin.<br /><br />p.s. A new album is coming soon. Most of the Bleeding Hearts should be involved. Note the absence of Andy from Clapton's lineup over the summer of 2004. He was probably busy working on the new Waters album. Two songs were available for download just prior to the US election, along with an interview in which Roger voices his hopes about regime change in the US of A.on of Stevie Ray Vaugh's drummer, who is now also in Clapton's band.

B0000TB01Y|5.0|This soundtrack is honestly amazing.  I didn't know that so much talent could be found on one CD.  The show itself is incredible and I highly recommend it. I had chills throughout the performance, especially during Defying Gravity, As Long as You're Mine, and No Good Deed.  All I can say is: Idina Menzel's voice.....wow lol
0061015725|1.0|I don't think this book deserves a rating of 1 star, but it is the lowest I am allowed to give.<br />There was a time when Crichton wrote great SF.  Then he wrote Jurassic Park, which may perhaps be his greatest, and that is when he began to completely unravel as a writer.  The success of that book and the monumental success of the movie seem to have forever altered Crichton's brain.  Now, he writes cheap screenplays for B-movies, of which Prey is the latest.  I have been burned by every one of his books after Jurassic Park - starting with Lost World, which was written with an action film in mind.  Well, this is the last Crichton book I will ever read.<br />The science in this book is absolutely preposterous - swarm technology and nanomachines that are capable of learning so much in a couple of days that they understand and control the most subtle human behavior; these nanobots come together to form perfect replicas of human form.  Come on, the 'science' in this book comes right from the mind of an imaginative 11-year old.<br />Judging from the positive reviews this book has received on this site, I guess Crichton will keep dishing out these badly written pseudo-science/action thrillers.  I would have figured that he is rich enough by now that he would be more interested in quality rather than trying to cash in on the movie rights.  But I guess not.  Perhaps the bomb that was Timeline (also based on a terrible book) will wake him up and make him realize that pandering to pre-adolescent SF/action fantasies can last only so long.
B000002NJS|3.0|While Ray Of Light is a good album it's also the most overrated work in her catalouge. Droning, pretentious, and melodramatic are the words that come to mind whenever I listen to it. This album also has the distinction of containing not just the one, but the two worst songs she's ever recorded: &quot;Shanti/Ashtangi&quot; and &quot;Mer Girl.&quot; Often dubbed her &quot;techno&quot; album it's most definitely not real techno so much as popified techno (which I prefer.) She gets flack for that but I don't recall her ever saying &quot;this is my purist techno album.&quot; While there are some great songs on here: &quot;Frozen&quot;, &quot;Ray Of Light&quot;, &quot;The Power Of Goodbye&quot;, &quot;Skin&quot;, and &quot;Nothing Really Matters&quot; the album ranks 4th behind Like A Prayer, Erotica, and Bedtime Stories.<br />Had she not fallen prey to the Kaballah cult maybe this album could have turned out to be the Like A Prayer of the 90's. How I long for the old Madonna who had more to say and spoke from her heart rather than reference their crap.
B0001AVZA8|4.0|Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton have wonderful chemistry in this delightful romantic comedy.  Instead of focusing on the younger generation, this movie spotlights two senior citizens who truly light up the screen.  Nicholson plays a man who has spent his life dating younger women and who is not willing to commit to any of them.  He looks forward to a weekend with his latest squeeze, when her mother (Keaton) walks in and puts a damper on the romance.  When he has a heart attack, the affair is put on hold indefinitely and Keaton ends up with the job of nursing Nicholson back to health.  An added complication occurs when Nicholson's 30-something Dr. also begins to fall for Keaton.  There are plenty of laughs, for instance when they wake up from their first night of love-making and neither of them can read their watch to see what time it is.  This is a fun, &quot;feel-good&quot; movie which allows two great stars to strut their stuff.
0440237688|5.0|I love this book; it ranks up there as one of my favorites. It makes you look at the world in a completely new light, for every bad; there is something that is good. To get rid of all bad we would loose our freedom. The book is about a little boy name Jonas who lives in a supposed utopian society, but really is a dystopian one, everything is controlled by a council from emotions to what you wear. They killed people off and make it sound like a good thing \\"release\\" is the term they use. There is one man who knows the truth he is \\"the giver\\" and Jonas has been chosen as the new giver. He learns about the realness of emotion and he discovers that choices are better than the bleak existence without love, color and most importantly choice. The end is ambiguous; it leaves you to make up your mind about what happens. This is an excellent read and a note to all those who said this was a difficult book to understand, I do not get it because it was crystal clear for me. The book is straightforward, and if at the first chapter, you do not know what they mean you will certainly know by the end.

B0001BKAEY|5.0|I thought that this movie was most amazing ending to an extraordinary trilogy. I've seen a ton of trilogies and sequels and they didnt connect or go with the first movie(s). I've seen the first Matrix movie and Reloaded a billion times. They are unbelievable and I thought Revolutions is a perfect ending to them and I hope to watch Revolutions many times also. Many of my friends saw and loved the first two movies also but they were upset with the third movie because Neo dies. But, they didnt realize that Neo or The One's purpose was to end the war and save Zion, thats why Neo is freed from The Matrix in the first place. That is what Neo does he saves Zion and saves the intire human race and ends the war. Plus, its not like most movies where the hero always saves the day and the only one who dies is the evil people of the movie and the hero lives happily ever after. But Neo sacrifices his life for the intire human race including Zion. Also, the final fight scene is the best fight scene I've seen in a movie. I hope my review changed some peoples opinion on this amazing movie. I'm sorry for those who I've ruined the movie for but this movie is a definite DVD to buy.
0452282152|5.0|As Time Magazine first observed, Girl With A Pearl Earring is &quot;a portrait of radiance.&quot;  Upon trying to think of another, more original phrase to describe this marvelous, subtly beautiful book, I could think of nothing that would do it the justice it deserves.  <BR>Vermeer has always been one of my favorite artists, especially for his renowned painting &quot;View of Delft.&quot;  As the book describes, it is his use of light that allows his paintings to come to life; the subjects are ordinary, if not beautiful, and the backdrops are typically common and true to the every- day life I imagine he lived.  Because of my interest in Vermeer's work, I cannot quite understand why I waited to long to finally pick it up and read it. However, I am very glad that I did. <BR>As a fan of art history, as well as history and fiction, I found this book a delightful triumph. Not only are the characters well-developed, they are believable.  I really imagined Vermeer living the life Chevalier described, and I felt so close to Griet, his muse and maid, by the end of the book that I wept for her loss.  <BR>This is a minor point, but I felt that the breaks in sections of the book were perfectly and strategically placed.  Creating cliff-hangers, they kept me on my toes while reading; I felt as if I could not put down the book until I had finished it in its entirety. <BR>Of course, one must keep in mind while reading Girl With A Pearl Earring that it is fiction; I think one of the challenges of writing and reading historical fiction is being too critical of the misrepresentation of facts.  I read the book with an open mind and genuine interest, and I ended up loving it.<BR>Although I had not previously read any of Tracy Chevalier's books, I now plan to; I anticipate enjoying them just as much.  <BR>I would recommend Girl With A Pearl Earring to anyone, young or old, male or female.  <BR>It took my breath away.
B00005JMX4|5.0|I LOVE THIS Movie so much!!<br />it is so funny, smart and entertaining!<BR>Please go see it! you won't regret it!<BR>the two main stars are sizzling!!<BR>AHH!
0385512104|4.0|Having an autistic step-brother, I eagerly anticipated reading Haddon's book with the expectation of becoming more enlightened about his withdrawn world.  I was not disappointed.  The relationships between parents and children, the ways they must live in order to cope, tugged at my heart.  I have been in similar situations, and it affirmed my reactions and the consequences.  Some people avoid special needs people for a variety of reasons, but this book opens up the question, &quot;Are special needs people just like you and me, who indeed need a bit more patience, understanding, and focus?&quot;  I appreciate being given this glimpse inside the heart of a boy with special needs, but I would have thoroughly enjoyed it if the profanity had been left out, or at least minimized.
B000001DQI|5.0|After achieving monsterous success with &quot;Honky Chateau&quot; and &quot;Don't Shoot Me, I'm Only The Piano Player&quot;, Elton John thought he could do no wrong and set out to make his most ambitous album yet. The result was &quot;Goodbye Yellow Brick Road&quot;. It wound topping the charts over a two - month period, spent two years on the Billboard Top 200 Album Charts, and was certified platinum in 1995. It is also probably the best double album ever made. <br />Beginning with the eerie 11 - minute epic medley &quot;Funeral For A Friend/Love Lies Bleeding&quot;, the album races out of the starting gates at breakneck speed. Things start to slow down with &quot;Candle In The Wind&quot;, which took on a whole new meaning when Elton performed it at Princess Di's funeral. The album then gets back on track with &quot;Bennie And The Jets&quot;. This has always been my favorite track on the album. Obviously inspired by the R &amp; B sounds of The Spinners and Barry White that was dominating the charts, this song perhaps makes a greater impression than any other song on the album. It also became a # 1 hit on the pop charts and peaked at 15 on the R &amp; B charts. What comes next is the title track, a # 2 hit. Elton's voice sounds very young and vibrant on this track. This is followed by the introspective &quot;This Song Has No Title&quot;, a fun little rocker with Elton playing all the instruments. &quot;Grey Seal&quot; is a remake of a 1970 song, and it differs drastically from the early version. &quot;Jamaica Jerk - Off&quot; is a fun, upbeat reggae number, followed by the powerful &quot;I've Seen That Movie Too&quot;. &quot;Sweet Painted Lady&quot; is a great song about a hooker. &quot;The Ballad Of Danny Bailey&quot; is another powerful ballad. &quot;Dirty Little Girl&quot; is a track that just sways effortlessly. &quot;All The Girls Love Alice&quot; is a fun rocker about a lesbian. &quot;Your Sister Can't Twist (But She Can Rock And Roll)&quot; will have you dancing around the room. &quot;Saturday Night's Alright For Fighting&quot; is a great rocker in vein of The Rolling Stones. &quot;Roy Rogers&quot; pays tribute to the famed tv cowboy. &quot;Social Disease&quot; is sort of filler, but good filler. Closing is the surreal &quot;Harmony&quot;, a gorgeous love song that is to die for. It's a great companion piece to &quot;High Flying Bird&quot; from &quot;Don't Shoot Me, I'm Only The Piano Player&quot;.<br />&quot;Goodbye Yellow Brick Road&quot; is a perfect album from start to finish. I also suggest reading the liner notes. They are excellent and insightful, written by man who knows all he needs to know.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Great CD! I love it! Christina is Great! Much better than first CD!My 3rd favorite CD of all-time!
B00008CLOA|5.0|As many musicians have proved, you don't have to be stoned out of your mind to enjoy Pink Floyd's 1973 masterpiece \\"Dark Side Of The Moon, though it can't hurt. No matter what physical state you're in, you can always enjoy \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\". <br />\\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\" begins with the medley of \\"Speak To Me\\" and \\"Breathe\\", one of the greatest album openers ever made. Next comes the breathtaking instrumental \\"On The Run\\", filled with great synth effects. Next comes the eerie \\"Time\\", complete with sound effects that strengthen it. Following is \\"The Great Gig In The Sky\\", this is basically an instrumental, except for the insecent wailing throughout the song. The piano is very soft and pensive. However, my friend told me something kinda of sinister about this track. If you listen closely to this track, you can hear a strange voice aying, \\"if you hear this whisper, you are dying\\". But I didn't hear it. Next comes the classic \\"Money\\", the song that led the group into the Top 20. With its amazing sound effects (cash registers going off, clinking coins), tbis is probably the standout. \\"Us And Them\\" changes the mood a bit. It is softer and more peaceful than the other songs on the album. Great song. \\"Any Colour You Like\\" is a great instrumental, followed by \\"Brain Damage\\", a trippy number written about the group's founder. Closing the album is \\"Eclipse\\", which ends the same way that the first track begins, a haunting bass line imitating a heartbeat.<br />\\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\" will forever remain among the greatest albums ever made. The music is so innovative and original, it's unlikely anything like it will ever come out again. And don't listen to The Infidel, the latest incarnation of The Cranky Reviewer. He just spouts words through a computer to get attention. In reality, I bet he loves The Beatles, Led Zeppelin and the other great classic rock bands he pans in his reviews, hates Justin Timberlake, Britney Spears, Kylie and Duran Duran, and supports Bush. Someone who doesn't do these sings isn't really a person. And go ahead, take a jab at me. I won't get insulted by your useless comments.
B00009W0U4|4.0|But, all in all this film is the most realistic film I have ever seen. It is not for the mainstream viewer, of course. This film was shown at one of my student film organizational meetings, and even most of the film students walked out of the room. Mostly men because I was the only woman that dared to see it, which I think is a shame. Many people cannot take sexual violence or violence in general but, it is a reality. This happens to ordinary people everyday. People are killed in equally or unfortunately  ( I would hate to imagine) more horrible ways than this. The thing about film is that people naturally disconnect themselves from film because from the beginning, they believe it is a ficticious water-down version of life.  But, Irreversible doesn't do that for you. It takes to deep into the dark, grotesque and evil sides of life. And they don't sugar coat it. That is what made me love this film. I probably can only see it once or twice in my lifetime. That's enough. But, I think everyone should see it. Every man and woman. I think it would do wonders in deterring sexual violence because of how intense it is. Anyone who says that this film should have never been made or says that it is too much. All I can say is that they must live in a paradise, completely shut out from the world. Because this film is real.  They used a real couple to portray the characters because it could only be believable in that aspect. For a real couple's lives to be ripped apart by such a gruesome act is real.  My whole reason for coming into film was to portray real stories that are not being told on the big screen. This film inspired me. And that is what it is for to inspire and to inform. Not to entertain. So if you are looking for entertainment, go to Disney.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I saw the first episode of the Firefly DVD series today, and it is absolutely fantastic.  A brilliant combination of sci-fi and western, the series was produced by Joss Whedon, the creator the Buffy and Angel series, which I have also grown to like.  Unfortunately, Fox canceled the series before the end of the season, so some of these episodes are only available on DVD.  While I have only seen one episode, I'm already cursing Fox for killing this awesome series.  <P>Anyway, the plot revolves around a retired sergeant named Mal who owns and captains Serenity, a Firefly-class spaceship.  Mal is a businessman first and a gunslinger second who just trying to make a profit carrying quasi-legal cargo and passengers between the \\"moons\\" on the edge of civilized space, while staying clear of the authoritarian Alliance government.
B000088E6D|5.0|The new king has been crowned!!!! What a fantastic voice, it gave me shivers.  He is without a doubt the most incredible performer, singer, and entertainer to arrive in 20 years.  We all bow to our new king.  May he reign forever.  This c.d. is worth every penny. I highly recommend it to everyone of all ages.  I am only 26 and enjoy every song on this c.d.
B00005JMSE|4.0|Hellboy has to be one of the best experiences I've had at the movies. It's exciting, funny and is the best movie based on a comic since X-Men 2. For a move that is only about an hour and 50 minutes, Guillermo del Toro (Mimic, Blade 2), throws a lot at you in just one movie. The beginning throws so much at you in like 5 minutes that you feel like you just watched a whole movie when it didn't really even start yet. Guillermo del Toro is a director that's great with giving the viewer interesting and scary creatures in all his movies. He knows how to give you the feeling that what your looking at is real. It's too bad that George Lucas isn't letting anyone else direct the prequels because Guillermo del Toro would probably make one awesome StarWars movie. When you see his name there as director you know you're in for a ride.<br />  Anyway Hellboy is about a demon child who is released from a portal in the early 1900's. Nazi's opened the portal trying to bring hell on earth. A scientist finds the demon child and raises him to be good and to fight evil. The child grows up to be Hellboy (Ron Perlman of Blade 2 and City of the Lost Children), a big red demon with broken off horns and an attitude. He has a soft spot however and that soft spot is what keeps him good. He's also in love with a girl who can produce fire (Selma Blair. The movie spends a little too much time with him being jealous that she might have feelings for the new guy on the team though. However Hellboy being jealous is pretty funny and makes for some entertaining scenes so it still works. Ron Perlman is fantastic as him. He's witty, scary and loveable all in one. The movie should not only be seen for the action, cool creatures and del Toro's direction but for Perlman's performance as well.
B0001IN07Q|5.0|I have watched this dvd over and over since I recieved it and can't tell you how much i enjoy this multi talented young man.  He is a master at everything he touches.  I've seen him in concert and was blown away... he is today's rat pack born again.<BR>If you thought talent died when we lost those greats, do not worry anymore he has arrived and will be with us forever.  <BR>He is by far the most amazing talent of the decade.  I recommend this c.d. and d.v.d. for anyone who misses listening and watching  a wonderful entertainer and singer. 10 stars!!!!
0385504209|5.0|Prior to reading this book, I saw tons of people getting this book, but had little word of mouth information and never knew what it was about until there was a television special about it. I decided to read it because I thought it was an interesting idea for a book. Especially because it went along with my curiousity about truth and fiction in the Bible and church history.<br />I absolutely loved it. It opened things up that I hadn't really considered, with my relatively conservative religious upbringing. It was a thrilling idea that Jesus was human, and not a robot without feelings and without a true human experience. It was also fascinating to consider the role of previous church leaders in information, or the supression of it.<br />It was interesting to see how the book ended, but more interesting was the information that I went out to research after I finished reading it. The book wasn't focused on sex. It was focused on the idea that the information we could have gotten that was such a threat to the authority of church leaders that they felt they had to surpress it. Anyone who walks away thinking the book was all about sex made a snap judgement and didn't see the problems posed by the church burying information. They came in with pre-concieved notions and would have been offended no matter how well or how poorly the story could have been told. They are also probably the same folks who watch television shows and movies just so they can whine about how violated they feel. And that's truly sad.<br />People who are deeply offended can move on, because they can go get one story spoon-fed to them every week. But those who are interested in looking at a work of fiction that can open their eyes to exciting ideas, while reading a gripping story, will truly enjoy this book. I read this book in a day and have re-read it several times.<br />This book has also given me a start to do historical research and find out what real events are behind this story.<br />Fantastic... Read it, but keep an open mind. If you can't do that... Then stay the same as you've always been.. Read it, but keep an open mind. If you can't do that... Then stay the same as you've always been.
B0001CNRS4|2.0|I can't believe anyone would give this movie five stars.  This was one of the most boring, under-acted films I have seen in quite a while.  I can't even believe this movie made it to theaters or DVD.<br />At no point in this film did anything seem even remotely REAL.  When Honey (Jessica Alba) leaves the CLUB out a side door and happens upon some neighborHOOD kids breakdancing in the alley I actually laughed outloud.  A few minutes into the &quot;conversatin'&quot;, between Honey and the home-boys a couple of WHITE cops ask the street crew to move.  PLEEEEEEASE, this is so corny it's pathetic.<br />Maybe it's because I'm not into Hip-Hop that I felt this movie fell way short of a any mark one might shoot for.  It was just too calm, simplistic, and prejudice for me.  The drug dealer who confronts Honey on the street outside her apartment was like a &quot;G&quot; rated cartoon character - he was so nice.<br />Like I said, maybe I just don't get the whole Hip-Hop &quot;thang&quot;, but whatever, it works for some.<br />Fans of this movie may be upset with me, but I always call it as I see it.  Save your money...I suggest buying Flashdance, it was doen much better, and is a LOT more believable.<br />See ya next time:<br />[...]
B0000AQS0F|1.0|I can not bring myself to sit through an entire episode of this show, although I have tried to watch nearly half of them! The program bores me to such a point I can not even keep myself awake. What I espeacially can not understand is how out of the nine or so characters only Simon interests me at all. I can never tolerate how Joss Whedon's shows swap good dialogue for semi-witty wisecracks. Now I have heard a feature film will be made. Just goes to show one how the world of the cinema has run out of ideas.
0062502174|5.0|One of the best books. Teaches values in life, and very eye opening. There comes a point in life when you fail and you want to find solutions, and this is the book, which leads you to the truth, leads you to the path. I would say, everyone must read this book.
0156027321|5.0|When a book of this caliber comes along you owe it to your friends to let them know. I've already purchased ten copies to distribute. I think that says alot about my opinion of this storyteller and the plot. As yet, no complaints from reciprocants, only bravissimos.
B000002KMY|5.0|Although not as consistently great as Heaven and Hell, the track &quot;Falling off the Edge of the World&quot;, tucked away near the end, is a hidden gem, an absolute stunner, with a classic quiet start leading into a hugely addictive riff, great bass work and climaxing in an astounding guitar solo, all in combination with Dio at his very best. By itself this track makes the album worthy of a 5 star rating. It's what the &quot;Repeat&quot; button was designed for :-)
B00005JMJ4|1.0|This is close to the worst move I have EVER seen.  It simply had no plot, no storyline, NOTHING.  Thank god I didn't waste the money to see this in the theaters.  Sophia should be ASAHMED of this waste of time!
B0001AVZA8|4.0|In this day and age of beautiful people, it was refreshing to see two &amp;quot;older&amp;quot; folks enjoying life. This film gave me hope that even the most ego ridden males can come down, put things in perspective and figure out there is more to life than sex and money. I spose, that goes for women too.

B0001611DI|5.0|The first thing I love about this movie is the out of control gore. Savini did fine job with the make up and gore. Romero's directing and the shots amazed me. The plot is completely origional. The racial slurs and shopping metaphors depict the late 70's and Romero's ideas are still relevant today. The best scene is the apartment raid. This movie iss the best movie ever made!!!!
B00005JMSE|4.0|i found hellboy a movie to be unforgetable. the spical afects were awesome. i feel i will see it again. i find myself talking about it over and over and over agian. i feel thats how good it really was. my family seemed to like it too. i see my self talking about it even in a chouch. not really in the chouch, but with the peaople of my chouch.<br /><br />i think the funniest part was when the hellboy guy was on the roof of some bilding talking to some kid and watching this guy flrit with hellboys woman. so he picks up a few rocks picks out the best one. and then hits him with it.<br />i hope you boys out there don't think this a mans movie. because if you do i can tell you up front that it ant. im a pure blooded girl. and i'd love to see that movie agian and agian. ok maybe not that much but preaty close to it.
B00005JLYW|5.0|First of all, I think the other reviewers who gave this movie such a bad rating were maybe taking the movie too seriously or something. I thought it was very funny and I personally did not like the first one because I did not think it was nearly as funny.<br />Give the movie a shot. If you rent it and after watching it you hate it, then you are only out about $3.
B0001EFTVA|5.0|this movie was everything i wanted it to be and more.  it made me laugh but at the same time weep.  that is the beauty of this movie, it touches people on so many levels.  i first heard about this movie from a magazine. Upon seeing the movie stills i was instantly drawn to it.  i knew that i had to see it.  i thank god that i was able to see Tokyo Godfathers at such a pivotal moment in my life.
B0000028RR|5.0|1) Bombtrack - Some great bass from Timmy C, then it explodes into a powerful track (as the name suggests). 8/10<br />2) Killing in the Name - Great angry song, their most recognised too. 8/10<br />3) Take the Power Back - Starts of a bit dull but becomes a fine track. 7.5/10<br />4) Settle for Nothing - Most emotional song; starts of slow and has an angry chorus. 7.5/10<br />5) Bullet in the Head - Rap-metal at its best and a great riff to learn on bass. Also, the unforgettable 'YOU GOT A F***ING BULLET IN YOUR HEAD!' 8.5/10<br />6) Know Your Enemy - This song starts of in hip-hop style, then is packed full of riffs and a great solo. 9/10<br />7) Wake Up - Song at the end of the Matrix. Has an unforgettable bassline and Zach's political rapping is ace too. 9/10<br />8) Fistful of Steel - Probably the worst on the album but its still pretty good. 7/10<br />9) Township Rebellion - Another great solo from Tom and a catchy chorus. 8/10<br />10) Freedom - Explosive intro and a super song packed full of riffs. 9/10
B00008EY9G|5.0|It was one of the most unique twists I've ever seen . It's one of my personal favorite  movie's.
B000060P79|4.0|This c.d. is really good just some of the words aren't poetic.But, anyway,this is a good c.d. and all of you avril haters will love it. My personal favorites are:    1.I'd do anything    2.I'm just a kid    3.addicted    4.perfect.    If you like the following bands you would probably like Simple Plan:    1.Good Charlotte(good charlotte is a little more hardcore though)    2.Blink-182 (a little more parental advisory if you know what I mean)    3.Sum-41 (More hardcore)   Just for the record, I'd like to say these people aren't punk- or even pop-punk for that matter, but that doesen't mean that the music is bad or anything. It seems everyone who hates them hates them 'cause they aren't punk enough. I thought the whole point of being punk was about hating people who hated you 'cause of what you wore or for being different. Try judging them for the MUSIC instead.
B000002U3P|5.0|When I started listening to this, it had been a year or so since I had seen the movie (which I liked), and I couldn't remember which scenes correponded to which tracks. Therefore I enjoyed it as a completley seperate work of art. When I re-watched the movie recently, I was almost dissapointed; the music actually seemed weakened in the context of the scenes. Don't get me wrong, Trainspotting is excellent, but the soundtrack stands indepedently and possibly even above it as a pop-culture watermark.<br />It's been observed that there's a lot of variance in the music, but I do think it's held together by a certain theme, a depiction of a way of life - squalor (Mile End, 2:1), desperatley sincere attempts to find some happiness or amusement (Lust For Life, Atomic, For What You Dream Of), an underlying and understandable sense of desperation (Sing and Perfect Day, the only songs which I thought perfectly matched their respective scenes in the movie), made bearable by the occasional glimpse of real, innocent sweetness (Temptation).<br />Taken seperatley, the songs are again very strong; there are great commerical hits like 'Temptation' and 'Born Slippy,' and more obscure but excellent tracks like 'Sing,' which I don't think can be found on any other album, but which I think is one of Blur's best songs, ever. The instrumental tracks are also good, particularly 'Trainspotting' itself.
B000088E6D|5.0|Another wonderful release from our boy Michael.  Can anything he touch not turn to gold with his incredibly fasinating voice.  He is an inspiration to the many youth out there, and through him they are now becoming aware of this lovely music.  His fans are as young as 13 and maybe some even younger, what a great job he is doing keeping this great music alive and enjoyed by every generation.  He truly is simply wonderful
B0000VCZKM|1.0|Really small on the back cover you'll find your purchased an all new anniversary FULL SCREEN version of this movie. Only released this way apparently.  Wasn't until I popped it in that I found this out.  If I could return it I would and go buy the original release which apparently has both full and wide.
B0001IN07Q|5.0|My girlfriends and I just loved this new d.v.d. and c.d. of Michael's.  What a wonderful treat and great way to spend an evening.  We enjoyed with a glass of wine and pretended we were in every venue with this amazing man.  He just keeps on getting better and better, if that is at all possible?  For those who say he is not good on a previous review, you make it sound personal...is your other half maybe in love with this beautiful, talented hunk, you do sound very bitter!!!  Just an observation,  maybe you should have a glass of wine and chill, oh jealous one.  For those who love to be lost in great music and the joking fun personality of a real down to earth star, I highly recommend this fantastic new d.v.d. from the ever fantastic Michael Buble.
B0001IN07Q|5.0|Wow, this is what I call great entertainment.  It has all the factors of a top 10 d.v.d.  Oh that's right,  &quot;Entertainment <BR>Tonight&quot; has it listed #2 on their top 10 list.  I highly recommend this wonderful package. It is a steal at the resonable price for a great c.d. and d.v.d.  rock on Michael your da man!!
B000088E6D|5.0|The best of the juno's 2004 line-up. He blew everyone away.  What carisma, what a voice. He is spectacular.  This c.d. is a must have to any music lover at any age.
B00018D44U|3.0|My initial reaction to this cd was that it was a terrible example of someone hanging on to the coattails of their first highly acclaimed album, but I have to admit it has grown on me somewhat with more listening.  <br />It definitely doesn't have the style of &quot;Come Away With Me&quot; and the country stuff definitely has to go - some of the baselines remind me of cartoon music!  I don't know what she thought she was doing duetting with Dolly Parton - it shows a total disregard for her fanbase.  &quot;Creepin' In&quot; and &quot;Long Way Home&quot; are so annoying I just have to press the skip button.  But having said all that, the rest is relatively enjoyable - it won't light up your life but it's decent enough background noise.
B00006J3WH|5.0|I saw the episode on TV and it was so good!  This is a definite must for ALL Buffy fans!  Joss is such a talented writer!!!!  The actors all have pretty good voices but James Marsters is the very best!  You can really get the story of the episode from the music in the CD!  It's a really great CD!
B00005JMJ4|1.0|Lost in translation quite possibly one of the worste movies I've ever seen. This film dosn't even have a genre. Its just a movie about two people who are wasting there lives and in the end nothing has changed. The story doesnt go anywhere and has no meaning. Its simply a really boring film, if you can even call it a film.
B00005JKGZ|5.0|Judy Garland didn't want to be in this movie. Fearful of her being stuck in juvenile roles as a twenty-one year old, Judy at first abhorred the role of lovelorn teenager Esther. Common sense and pressure from friend Arthur Freed led to her acceptance of the role. one that would be a hallmark of career, in the beautiful \\"Meet Me in St. Louis\\".<br />The Smith family in this movie is all-American schlocky-ness. Papa Smith works hard, Mama Smith stays at home and tends to her brood, the girls are boy crazy, the son with eyes set out in the world. But somehow, this family becomes real and enduring as they face the crisis of their lives (sarcasm somewhat intended!). Papa must move to New York City to further his career, and thus sends in the Smith's into a personal maelstrom. But no fear, this is MGM in the 1940's after all, and the results are predictable but still enjoyable.<br />Starring brightly is Judy herself. She commented, upon seeing the daily rushes of her performance, that she truly looked beautiful on screen, and this DVD rendition proves exactly why. She is absolutely stunning in color, flawless, perfect. Her performance gives depth to Esther, who's basically just a giggly schoolgirl in love with the gorgeous Tom Drake. Her voice has never been more stunning as she's singing \\"The Boy Next Door\\", \\"The Trolley Song, and the Christmas standard \\"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\\".<br />The film works because while harping on the \\"good ol' days\\" it never takes itself too seriously. Case in point, when Esther suspects that love interest John was responsible for an injury to her youngest sister Tootie, Esther goes over and clobbers John. It's actually really funny, and adds to the charm of the film.<br />Credit must also go to Judy's future husband, Vincent Minelli. His vision of this picture makes it lush, gorgeous and a cinematic experience. Several shots in the movie are breathtaking, and you feel as if you are watching a painter paint a deep, engaging canvas. Rarely do film nowadays offers such bold, interesting colors, and it's been a loss for cinema ever since.<br />For DVD collectors, this is a dream package. Not only do you get the movie with an engaging commentary track, but an additional second disk loaded, and I mean loaded, with goodies. A documentary on the film is too short, but a second documentary, on MGM itself, is incredibly engaging and a surprise. You'll pop that second disk in and be prepared to skip around learning more about Judy Garland and other aspects related to the film.<br />So, buy this DVD and we'll all meet in St. Louis at the 1904 World's Fair!vas.

B0001AVZA8|1.0|While it was great to see a romance about an older couple - for -once - I simply do not like the way the female charcter was depicted. It simply did not ring true. For one - and this is valid for people of ANY age but far more so for a mature woman - it's time that filmmakers and the world in general found out that great sex does not equal love. That was the cardinal false note in this movie; this basic premise was wrong. I just did not see Erica falling for Jack just because of one night together. His character was in a completely different class to hers - surely she was not THAT hard up!<br />A number of reviewers are harping on about \\"goose and gander\\" issues, asking why it was OK for Erica to go with the doctor but not OK far Jack and a young girl. But age is not the problem  here at all. These were two completly different kinds of relationships. You had Jack, a sleazy, shallow old man, chasing after fresh young things young enough to be his granddaughters, and the bottom line was sex.<br />You did NOT have Erica chasing after fresh young studs for sex. That would have been an equal situation; and in my view equally ridiculous as Jack's with his girls.<br />What you had was an educated and discrimating man who HAPPENED to be a good deal younger than Erica falling for her in a big way - actually LOVING her. She did not chase him, as Jack chased his girls. She was not deliberately looking for younger partners, as Jack was. She wasn't even interested in the doctor; he had to win her over.  All of this puts this relationship on a completley different footing to Jack's with his granddaughters.<BR> (...)<br />Finally there's no way I can believe that Jack was suddenly cured of his wicked ways  in the space of a few months. No way.
B00005JMX4|5.0|The movie was very touching and poignant.  I didn't appreciate the \\"porn star\\" aspect of the film, but felt it made a great love story.  Elisha Cuthbert really shined as a fairly new actress to the big screen.  There was a believable chemistry between the two stars and the soundtrack was equally impressive.  I would high recommend this movie (to adults only).
0385336810|5.0|Emma is funny and resemble to us. This is a easy reading book and very enjoyable.
0553382179|5.0|As hard as it is to believe, Sink Reflections is probably the single most important book I've ever read!  I feel like someone has handed me the key to finally learning how to have the house I want to raise my family in.  It's not just about cleaning (though it's VERY helpful there, of course) but provides guidelines to live the life I've always wanted to, in a picked up house, not haunted with laundry to do, and supper on the stove.  <br />For all those who want a nice homelife but just can't figure out how to do it all, this is book for you!<br />My husband's unsolicited and encouraging comments keep me going and I vow that I will continue these routines the rest of my life because I actually can and, get this, even like it!  <br />Wonderful, wonderful book. A MUST READ for anyone you know searching to improve their home life.
0893815187|5.0|The summers of one's youth in the Blue Ridge are unmistakable.  The heat comes up by ten. You head to the ponds and rivers for relief. By the blazing arc of midday you play jacks or Uno under an oak. Evening comes; hotdogs are grilled for miles, and an immense cool falls like a hush between the pines. Mann captures this reverie with utmost grace in her unalloyed images of her children. In Mann we discover a eye keen to the wonderful contrasts of black and white. Some images offer striking, ambiguous detail; others approach portraiture.<br />If her children's nudity draws criticism from those of a certain political stripe, I can only surmise it comes from that small, unlucky handful of Virginians who did not have the opportunity to march outside on an August dog day with nothing on. Frankly, it's all you want to wear in August whether you are eight or fifty eight.<br />These images tug strongly at the heartstrings of, not just those of us lucky enough to have spent our youths in rural Virginia, but anyone who has deep set memories of childhood and place. A rich and lasting collection.
074325144X|5.0|I had given up running years ago, because of the pounding, and pain to my joints that it had caused. After learning this  method of running and taking the time to practice it, I can run again, but without the pain and impact! The book is easy to read, easy to understand, and has alot of great illustrations. Danny has shared alot of personal insite from his running and tai chi experiences. I highly recommend this book as a must for anyone who is serious about running, and especially for those who would like to run, but are afraid it's too hard, or who have given up running, and miss the benefits of it.
B0001BKAEY|3.0|Not nearly as bad as the sequel, but not nearly as good as the original. Yes, it ties together some loose ends, but it really just borrows from other movies. The effects are merely repeats of the original. All in all, nothing really spectacular here. Only watch it if you must see all three episodes.
0393317552|3.0|The question asked is: \\"Why did people from the Eurasian continent conquer the other continents, and not the other way around?\\" Most people would answer `because they had guns'. Jared Diamond tries to answer why the Eurasians developed guns. What was the prime reason?<br />Diamond has a couple of intriguingly good points related to geography, points completely new to me: that the size and major axis was decisive of a continent's destiny in the big battle for world supremacy. Because Eurasia was the biggest continent, it was most likely to accommodate the most domesticable plants and big mammals. Eurasia also had the longest east-west axis, meaning that the art of food production spread more easily than in the Americas or Africa, where the major axis were north-south. With food production the value of land increased. People became willing to pay for staying at the same place over a long period of time, and political centralization and professional specialization evolved. Particularly: people with food production developed means to protect their property by force. Political centralization also contributed largely to the development of writing, and a lot of other innovations like metallurgy, large ocean going vessels, compasses, armour, religion etc. The size of Eurasia also meant that if one civilization was in the backwater, another was probably innovative. Ideas spread, and ideas spread more easily between rather similar civilizations. The geographical points are well made.<br />In addition to the geographic points, Diamond spends a lot of time elaborating a biological point: domestication of big mammals led to infectious diseases among the farmers, smallpox being the most important one. After a couple of thousands years the farmers develop resistance towards those diseases. Travelling overseas, the diseases became a lethal weapon in the service of the Europeans, killing far more Indians than guns did. This point is not new, and the importance of germs as a cause of successful European imperialism is large overrated in this book. Firstly, germs impossibly played any significant role in the battles between the 150 Spaniards led by Pizarro and the tens of thousands of Inkas. Guns, armour and horses did. Secondly, Africa was also conquered by Europeans, despite that Africans had as nasty germs as Europe. All this said, reading about the development of germs was interesting enough. Another objection towards his theory is the facts of the immense diversity inside the Eurasian continent. At 1500, Western Europe and China were at the technologically forefront. The areas now covered by Ukraine, Poland, Pakistan, Myanmar and a whole lot of other Eurasian areas were not, despite being at the Eurasian continent. A point he pulls far to often is that the wealth of US, Europe, Australia and Eastern Asia today does not originate from superior genes, but from different environments. A hundred years ago it would have been controversial, today it isn't.<br />The main objection towards the book however, is its length. Diamond has a couple of really good points, and some really good stories to tell (example: the Japanese went from being the worlds finest gunsmiths at 1600 to abandoning guns altogether in 1800). The author didn't have to spend 450 pages getting his admittedly good points through, and he didn't spend that many pages either; the last half is mostly repetitions from the first. Chapter 18 (Hemispheres colliding) is a complete revisit to the earlier chapters. But the first part of the book is a winner, and I am will probably read Diamond's next one as well, about why civilizations fail.f successful European imperialism is large overrated in this book.

B0001BKAEY|1.0|Since I view LOTR as a whole movie I might as well review the entire Matrix series as one film.  When I saw the first Matrix, I wasn't too impressed with it.  The SFX were good, the story was interesting but I didn't feel as if it was worth all the hype.  But my friends who loved it convinced me to give it another chance and I did and I admit I enjoyed it a lot more.  But mostly from a action film POV and not because of the philosphy (which has already been done to death, IMO).  When I heard of Reloaded I couldn't wait, and during this time Matrix effects were popping up everywhere and I had to suffer my friends telling me how Matrix is going to be the next best film triolgy vs LOTR (For some reason they were in competition)  But face it as much as I enjoyed Matrix, LOTR was better.  Well, Reloaded hit the screen and I couldn't believe what I was seeing, the effects looked like video game cut scenes, the fight scenes were dull, whatever happened to the gritty feel of the first film?  And it seemed around this time the W. bros were actually believing in their own philosophical hype to the point where it was just plain tedious.  So when Revolutions came out I didn't want to waste time or money seeing it, but everyone was telling me how I should view it as one full film and revolutions is where it gets good again.  (Of course after they saw it they couldn't say much of anything about Matrix being a great triolgy.) and I was even told not to watch it.<br />Well recently I decided to just see the last installment and just be done with it.  So I rented it for movie night.  The results? We paid attention for five mins then we started talking about anything other than what was happening in the film and when we did try to pay attention it was endless &quot;Do you know?&quot;  &quot;I know, but do you know I know?&quot;  &quot;Yes, I know you know.&quot;  &quot;What about her does she know?&quot;  &quot;No, I don't know&quot; It's obvious that these guys ran out of pretentious things to say so decided to be pretentious for pretentious sake.  We tried hard to understand what the heck was even happening in this train wreck of a film but to no avail.  Soon we decided that this movie sucks and was no longer interested in watching, so we chapter skipped until we found at least something to hold our attention, which ended up being the Neo vs Smith fight which was quite good until it became over done.  Then we find out that the humans and Machines, after everything, decide to just simply live in peace?  Is this a joke from the filmmakers?  Like saying Reloaded and Revolutions were a waste of time and money, just like the wasted time of the characters in this movie?  There should have only been one film and one film only, plain and simple.<br />Four stars for the first film, One star for Reloaded and zero stars for Revolutions.s things to say so decided to be pretentious for pretentious sake.

0553208845|4.0|Siddhartha's search for his self and the meaning of life mirrors the beginning journey of a senior in his or her senior year and what the rest of his or her life may be.  Siddhartha is merely an intelligent and handsome man thirsty for the \\"answer\\", just like any senior would be at the end of the year.  He searches for people to teach him what they know and to tell him what to do with his life and how to live it.  After going through an ordeal of adventures, and finally meeting his only son, he finds what he longs for in life and what his only purpose was; to raise and love his child, just as his father did, and then let him go.<br /> This book has shown me that you can go through the whole world and try and find what makes you happy and at peace, but you will never have peace within yourself until you realize that you can only make yourself happy, not an object or a person.  You don't have to find the answer, the answer will find you when you're ready for it, when you feel like you've searched everywhere, it'll be in the place you least expect it.  You can't ask people to tell you what the answer is, or live what they've experienced through them.  You're allowed to mess up and make mistakes because that's the only way you'll learn.<br /> Reading Siddhartha also showed me that intelligence and attractiveness doesn't shield you from making bad choices or living a life that is cruel and ugly.  A person isn't measured by how badly they crash and burn, they're measured by how they pick themselves up and put their lives back together after they've crashed and burn.<br /> I would recommend this book to anyone who is open minded enough to see the deeper meaning within the pages.  I'd highly recommend it to seniors in high school or students in college or anyone who's not sure where they're life is headed.
B0000399WI|5.0|When things get so out of reality these days--for instance, people who'd rather watch reality TV shows rather than live it, we can easily forget whats really important--not who Justin Timberlake is dating or which CD wins best at the Grammy's, but what life is, what hope is, and what our purpose is. What would you do if twenty to forty years of your life was taken away? <br />Tim Robbins is Andy, a supposedly innocent man who is put into Jail for life. He is quiet, observant and intelligent, and befriends a couple of inmates after a while, including Red, (Morgan Freeman) who shows him the meaning of loyalty and friendship, whilst Andy shows Red the meaning of hope. I don't want to give too much away, but this movie will make you breathless, cheer and cry--one of the best films of all time.
B00003W8NM|5.0|Easily Makes the Top Five movies of all time list. Flawless. Absolutely flawless. I believe this movie was completely mis- marketed at its initial release and goes far beyond just a &quot;Van Damme Tourney Fighter&quot; movie (Oh yea, you know it: Bloodsport, The Quest, The Quest 2, Street Fighter; was it just me or were these movies all exactly the same?)This movie delves extremely deep into the general concensus of the working class mind and produces a fanatical satire of grand proportions. The bloogy fight are just an added bonus. This is one of the most daring films I have ever seen, including tiny details that cannot possibly be dissected or understood until the second time you see it. Brilliant. If you like this, go see: Requiem for a Dream, Donnie Darko, Pi, Memento, The Cube and Minority Report.

B00008J4P5|5.0|Jack White is one of the best songwriters in popular music today. It's just a fact that, within the celebrity, there's an amazing talent and sincere knack for heart-felt expression. There are plenty of rock bands that have dollar signs in their eyes and decide to do whatever it takes to sell records. Isn't it fantastic that the White Stripes have maintained their own identity!<BR>Isn't it great that Jack writes about things in a way that we're not too familiar with!<BR>Isn't it cool that he cares about the atmosphere of his own albums!<BR>Come on! So you don't like this band? Well, maybe you're satisfied with the Blink 182's and the Sum 41's of the world. I am, most certainly, NOT. Not only are the White Stripes amazing performers (unlike the Strokes), and great songwriters, they also seem like humble, interesting people.<BR>Jack seems really smart and Meg seems really modest, and I think that's a fresh breath of reality in a world where everybody acts up for the camera.

Just imagine Keith Moon in the Velvet Underground (if you've ever heard of them)! Sorry, but that just frustrates me too much.<BR>The White Stripes may not be for everybody, granted, but what band is? Believe me, at a close listen you'll realize that they deserve all of the attention, and then some.<BR>There are two bands from Detroit that I love: the White Stripes and the Go. It makes a lot of sense to me that they were once in a band together. The Go is another one that ought to be at the Grammy's. Their new album doesn't seem as well thought out as White Stripes, more like a &quot;greatest hits&quot; rather than a complete work of art. No doubt that's the reason the Go hasn't had the spotlight yet. But I wouldn't be surprised if they join their ex-band mate Jack White on the cover of Rolling Stone one day. The Go's &quot;Whatcha Doin?&quot; is a rock and roll classic! If you wonder what Jack would sound like with a full band you should get it. He sings and plays guitar for them, and even wrote a couple of the best songs on the record.<BR>All that said, it's obvious that Jack White knows what he's doing. You should buy Elephant if you want to listen to something beautiful and very different. In fact, you should buy every White Stripes album. They may change the way you listen to music.
B000068IEU|1.0|Wes Wes Wes!!!! I know there were a lot of hallucinagens in the 70s but what the hell kind of trips were you on when you made this movie?! Lets just get straight to the point.. the point being that this movie sucks, in fact it sucks so bad that Im afraid to say that it sucks because I feel like Im picking on a handycapped child. The story...(yawn sip of coffee) slow and boring. Not scary a little psychoish. The soundtrack...well folks its like mixing the theme from the partridge family with Michael Myers in Halloween. It doesnt work. No suspense no buildup in the movie no scares. Save your money dont rent it either if someone offers to give you this movie for free just laugh in their face for owning it take it home throw it in your dvd player for 10 minutes try not to fall asleep press eject when youve had enough take the disc out and use it as a clay pidgen for your shotgun.  I forgive you Wes.
B0000C9ZLD|4.0|I like this album. When I first heard &quot;Is This It&quot; I instantly took to it. Their follow up is almost as good. I guess the first impression of a band will always be one of the best but over all this new one is worth while and exciting. Sure they've been over exposed but it's easy to tell that they've remained focused. I look forward to their next one.
B0000AQS0F|1.0|I enjoyed the series very much, and was surprised to see that there were some episodes that were not aired, and that was the main reason for buying this set.  However all of the episodes that are in this collection WERE aired on the Sci-fi channel in the UK.  I don't know if this is true in the U.S.A., but this makes the cover statement at the very least misleadind.  There is even a reference to 'Objects in Space' in the special features section as having been aired.  It's possible that they mean the DVD versions are different to the ones that were aired, but if that's so WHY DON'T THEY JUST SAY THAT!
B0000AQVCL|1.0|Sure it rocks but it's nothing more than average. This album is really boring. Once you've heard the first song expect nothing more.
1572814349|5.0|The art integration also refreshes and revisits art for fans of old Medieval to Renaissance.  If you wanted your own set of personal gilded minatures for tarot enjoyment and storytelling, this is a fascinating collector item. I found it as an affordable visual tour of International Gothic art, worthy of many museum stores. Kat Black gives an excellent image source description in her well-done minature book.<br />  Trumps and minors draw from backgrounds and beautiful historic sites in Europe, including historic monument such the Schifanioa Palace of Ferarra. If you visit [...] you can read more about her work and see all the images. She also has beautiful related products for the collector.<br />  The digital integration of many sources is done so seamlessly, I see each card as an independent work of art. I can well believe it took some 1600 hours to complete the deck.<br />  After a few uses, you will find some of the gilted edges have a bit of dust at the edges of the book or cards. If you are not allergic to this, this is a very minor nit. However I've encountered people who need to know this before buying products with metallic residue.
B0001ENY6M|5.0|One thing that you cannot fault Mel Gibson in the movie, the Passion of the Christ, is his production of the soundtrack. The music is able to carry you and holds true to the movie's premise. John Debney creates a world all in its own. Where Mel prived the visual aspect of the story, John makes the world of sound right.<br />The Passion's soundtrack at times can be as brutal and even as eerieas the movie itself. Debney makes sure to combine the element and the right instruments to make this work. Debney combines Gregorian chants at times and even in others you clearly hear a Middle Eastern voice. Unlike most movies where the score is held captive by the movie, this one takes you to another level. It truly is alive. For example, the scene of the crucifixion is very powerful, combine that with the track, you certainly feel the power emanate that the only senses that are missing is for you to feel and smell your surroundings.<br />I loved the movie. I thought it was very well done and clearly displayed one man's image of what might have happened, but I loved the movie even more because Debney was able to create the aura of awe to it. He made things more believable.<br />Highly recommended for even those who did not watch the movie, but appeciate music as one of the main driving forces to the success of the movie.
B00006ZCFH|5.0|I love this CD, or EP (as a lot of people keep stressing).  There are at least 4 solid tracks, which is hard to find on the average CD.  I love you Erykah, keep doing your thing.  I can't wait for your next release.  Standout tracks are:  Bump It (which I have to listen to &quot;sky high&quot;), Back In The Day, I Want You, and Danger. By the way, She threw down at her concert in Detroit.
B00009RAJI|5.0|As a longtime Rumours fanatic, I had been patiently awaiting a remaster. The wait was worth it. Along with obvious sonic improvements, the tweaks to the original album work well for me. As has been mentioned repeatedly, the two major changes were the inclusion of &quot;Silver Springs&quot; and a revised version of &quot;Gold Dust Woman&quot;. The new version of &quot;Silver Springs&quot; works better for me. Bringing Stevie's vocal forward towards the end of the record further highlights the intense emotion of that portion of the song. I do not feel that &quot;Silver Springs&quot; is meant to be overly tender and romantic for four minutes. The remixed version of &quot;Gold Dust Woman&quot; is a great improvement over the original. Eliminating the edges at the beginning and end with fading makes the record more effective. There is also significant improvement with regard to the many haunting background sounds on the record. I am intrigued by the removal of the broken glass sound that many of us know so well. I don't quite understand that move.<br />As far as the bonus disk is concerned, I did not find it very interesting except for the rough version of &quot;You Make Loving Fun&quot;. I really like the longer intro and general funkier nature of it. However, the generally corny background vocals performed by Stevie on the rough cut were rightfully removed for the final version of the album.
B0000C7GG2|5.0|In the gush of pablum and crap that record companies send down the poop shoots, both online and lasered in plastic, you seldom hear music that sets itself apart, musically (A+), emotionally (A+) and lyrically (A-).   This CD is the most original music to come along in years.  The arrangement and instrumentation are masterful, precise, and balanced.  These guys can compete with J.S. Bach in tonic complexity.  It is extremely listenable, and is unmatched in its raw power and emotion.  This music isn't just rock or pop, it approaches art.  It will be imitated for years to come.  Even if you would rather listen to Bach, Limp Biz, Joni Mitchel, Lil' Kim, Baltimora, KMFDM, or anyone, this cd will resonate with you.  Give it a listen.
6304602901|5.0|This is the third best Police Academy movie out of all 7.  Police Academy 2: Thier First Assignment was my favorite closely followed by Police Academy 5: Assignment Miami Beach.  If you need a good laugh, you know where to look, the Police Academy Complete Collection.  It has all 7 of the classic films.  This Anniversary edition was quite good, with enough special features to keep you happy.  So no stalling, get the set.
0060516402|5.0|This book is a must read for anyone with any kind of interest in business or running any type of organization, Collins has done a great job.  This is on my all time top 10 book list and I will be reading Good to Great very soon
6304602901|5.0|My favorite part is when Lassard does that speach and the hooker does you know what to him.  That was hilarious.
B0000TB01Y|1.0|This musical is awful. I hate it. I cannot begin to describe how much I hated it. I hated it when I saw it on Broadway. Yes, Kristen was great, but the authors of the show RAPED the book, which had a dark sort of wonderfulness to it and turned it into a FEEL GOOD HULLABALOO. AND WHAT IS UP WITH ALL THOSE POWER BALLADS? THIS ISN'T &quot;CELINE DION--LIVE IN CONCERT!&quot; Or &quot;The Frank Wildhorn Birthday Celebration.&quot; If I WANTED power ballads I would go see Les Miserables, a book which was also RAPED by its authors into a bland, meaningless mess of pop songs and POWER BALLADS. I HATED THIS SHOW! There are so few good musicals nowadays. This just further proves my point. I think if we're going to make musicals, they might as well show real life characters and allow us to embrace our problems rather than pat eachother on the back and say &quot;It's alright. There, there. It's all better now.&quot; Who wants to be lied to? I don't. And the advertisements for &quot;Wicked&quot; are LYING to you. We've already seen this musical several times over....The Wizard of Oz, The Wiz, et cetera. The only possible way to enjoy this show is if you get severely inebriated before hand, then sit in the first row right side of the balcony, and throw spitballs at the monkeys as they fly out in front of you.
B00019074O|5.0|When I went to rent this yesterday in the 20th anniversary edition, I wasn't expecting alot, but I liked it so much I ended up buying it.  I'm gonna buy some of the other Police Academy movies too.
B0000AZJXQ|3.0|This album has received so much hype and is selling in such high numbers, I can't believe this. It is actually worse than Mer De Noms which was decent. Yes, it has some moments (The Package, The Noose, Pet), but it's really a DULL listen. It's like a lullaby album, no intensity, no catharsis.<BR>The thing that makes me particularly sad is the fact that Maynard wastes a lot of time writing for A Perfect Circle and has gotten into mellower music. APC is in my opinion one of the reasons why his performance on Lateralus (musically a very good album) wasn't so inspired and breathtaking as on AEnima, one of the best albums of the 90's. Now his voice doesn't have much variety and he actually wastes his talent. I hope Tool's next album, which is reportedly coming out somewhere at the beginning of 2005, will be a return to form for the band, but I have to agree it's unlikely.<BR>P.S. All those who disagree with me, try to understand my point of view of feeling sorry for the downfall of what I think the greatest metal band today: Tool.
B00019074O|5.0|I still want this movie, but I don't got it yet.  I know it's funny because I saw it in theatres back in 1984.  I almost died laughing.  Same with my dad.  Yes you heard me right, my dad who let me see any movie brought me into this movie when I was 9.  My mom didn't like my dad taking me to any movie out there.  Soon or later I will get this movie and maybe get the box set that was just realesed.
B0001BKAEY|1.0|The Matrix series should be looked at as an example of what George Lucas had better not do (OR ELSE!) with the final Star Wars movie. I will personally FedEx him my movie ticket and popcorn receipt for him to give me back my money via PAYPAL!
6304602901|5.0|This is by far the most funniest movie ever.  It made me fall on the floor with total laughter.  My favorite characters are Mahoney, Jones and Harris.   This movie is worth anything.  The commentary on the new 20th Anniversary special edition is great and I loved it.  Get this!
B0001BKAEY|5.0|Too many people dislike &quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot; for the wrong reasons. They can say that they didn't like the plot or action, but the real reason is that this is a movie that makes you think, and this is not what many people want when they go see a huge-budget action movie. There are very intellectual things in the entire &quot;Matrix&quot; series, altough much of it seems to stem from first or second year philosophy courses. <br />This film is an absolute epic, concluding the series that is not really viewed as an epic in the same way that &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; is, but it should be. A massive world has been created by the Waschowski brothers, one that can be confusing at times, but one that never stops entertaining the viewers. The action here is still second to none, every stunt trying to outdo the last. Of course these stop-motion shots that the directors have invented have become overused and clicheed, but that it because many directors who had no business using this technology were ripping them off left, right and center. The fact is that these guys invented this new style of action, and they are definitely the ones who do it the best. Those who aren't amazed by the action in &quot;Revolutions&quot; should give their heads a shake, because they are simply asking too much from a movie. <br />There are many ways to think about &quot;The Matrix&quot;, but it is impossible to overlook the religious overtones of the film. Many were dissapointed by the ending of this movie, but look at it like a religion. There are no answers carved into stone, only guidelines and certain things that can only be considered leaps of faith. The same goes for this. Personally I was glad there were a few loose ends, because it lets our imagination play, thinking out how everything else could be resolved. <br />This brings me back to the first point. If you don't want to use your brain, then do not see this movie, because there is intelligence in it. But this cannot take away from the fact that this is a brilliant action movie, and a series that will be considered an absolute classic in years to come. Think of how these films revolutionized filmmaking over the past five years or so. &quot;The Matrix&quot; is important for many reasons, and &quot;Revolutions&quot; is an excellent conclusion to the series that managed to amaze people from the start.
6304602901|5.0|This is a great movie.  Tackleberry is hilarious.  I own all the Police Academy movies on dvd, because I just bought the box set.
B000059GEH|5.0|This as definatly a feel good movie. A sweet romantic comedy (leaning heavly on comedy) about three models who take up a expensive penthouse in New York hoping to catch themselves some millionairs. Schatze Page (Lauren Bacall)is a woman who is through with marrying poor men, or as she calls them &quot;gas pump jockeys&quot; for the simple reason that poor men have broken her heart. She's the brains of the bunch. Bacall is wonderfull in this film. Pola Debevoise (Marlyn Monroe) is the blonde, and blind, one who is really just going along with what shounds like a good idea. In this role Monroe pulls off a stunning performance, marked by her sweetness and child-like inocence, as well as many commedic scenes. She is somewhat sill (she beleives that her glasses make her unatractive) but warm-hearted.<BR>Loco Dempsey (Betty Grable)is a girl who has an appetite..... for food. She is nice, somewhat dumb but a good person. Her performance is good, but not as outstaning as Monroe's.<br />Overall this is a really sweet movie with alot of substance.

B000099T2L|5.0|Dangerously In Love, Beyonc's debut solo album, is amazing and expresses her true singing talent. With major hits like the looped trumpeting sounds of the Chi-Lites in &quot;Crazy In Love&quot; featuring Jay-Z, and &quot;Baby Boy&quot; featuring Sean Paul, it doesn't even explain what her album's name actually means. \\"Dangerously In Love 2\\" which happens to be her CD title, and a remake from her previous album Survivor, illustrates that Beyonc is dangerously in love, and the album shows that. Songs like &quot;Be With You&quot;, the slow soulful love ballad &quot;Speechless&quot;, and the jazzy slow jam &quot;Gift From Virgo&quot; states her affection for a certain man (who collaborates with her twice on this CD.) Other songs like the strong, independent &quot;Me, Myself And I&quot;, and the vintage hard thumping sound of \\"Yes\\" a song about waiting for the first time, says that she is an independent woman. Additional collaborations include a duet with Luther Vandross in \\"The Closer I Get To You\\", Missy Elliot in \\"Signs\\", a song that tells about her past loves, and \\"Hip Hop Star\\" featuring Big Boi and Sleepy Brown, as Beyonc asks you to undress her. The only songs that lacked my interest were her ode to her father entitled \\"Daddy\\", and \\"That's How You Like It\\" again with Jay-Z, which seemed to not fit the latter half of the CD. Though most people only heard club-dance beats like \\"Naughty Girl\\", Beyonc really does have talent, which is why anyone would love this album.
B000056NX5|5.0|I just finished watching this DVD rental, and find myself online to buy a copy.  It is worth adding to your collection for viewing and reviewing.  Not being Christian...my only annual &quot;observance&quot; of Easter is to pull out my original London cast recording of this masterpiece (on an album!) and listen to the Passion Play.  I thank Webber/Rice who gave me a version of this ages-old story which became accessible and profoundly moving.  <br />This production was at first off-putting with the updated costumes and set (mucking up a classic!) but quickly I got past that, and into the statement this theme was offering.  Although this film has a theatrical feel, the characters of Jesus, Judas, and Mary Magdalene are skillfully portrayed by the actors.  True emotional angst comes through which is heart-rending.  The musical pieces are true to the classic, yet fresh and new.  I was pleasantly surprised to hear Mary singing &quot;Can We Start Again Please&quot;, which I had heard before, but did not associate with this play, as it is not in the London album.<br />I am once again moved and humbled by the frailty, the fear and loneliness, yet the utter faith and understanding of the man, Jesus of Nazareth.
B0000AXE8I|3.0|I Really Enjoyed 'The Matrix Reloaded' When I Saw It In Theatres. I Was Pumped Up To See This Sequel Since I Really Had A Thing For The Original. When The Movie Ended Only One Word Could Sum It Up: Amazing. <br />To Be Honest Some Of The Scenes Really Could Be Tedious. Most Noticeably The Dialogue Sessions. Some Were Vital I Admit, Like The Architect's Session. Some Weren't Really Vital, Such As When Counsillor Hamman Was Talking To Neo About Control. I Enjoyed The Action Sequences Very Much. I Had A Knack For The Burly Brawl (All The Smiths Attacking Neo In The Park Or Wherever), Though The Effects Were Obviously Computers (The Effects Supervisors Said They Couldn't Do That Sequence With Just Wirework And Stuff. I Do Not Blame Them.). The Highway Chase Scene Is Awesome, Especially At The End With The Truck Sequence.<br />I Have To Say That Though This Movie Is A Nice Touch On The Matrix Phenomenon, It Isn't As Groundbreaking As The Original. A Lot Of People Complained About This, But I Am Perfectly Comfortable With It. Either Way, Everyone Has Their Own Opinion.<br />So, If You Are A True Critic With Movies And You Look For Any Possible Flaws In Films, You Probably Wouldn't Enjoy This. But If You Are A Hardcore Fan Of The Matrix Saga Like Me, I Bet You Would.
B00001U0CP|3.0|When a headless, limbless torso is discovered in a landfill in Virginia, chief medical examiner Dr. Kay Scarpetta is called in to investigate and is horrified to discover that the person was infected with a smallpox type virus which she herself could have contracted.The murderer contacts Scarpetta via the internet, showing her gory photos of bodies in the process of dismemberment, and going by the name of&quot;deadoc&quot;. I guarantee that the readers interest will be held to the end, even if it gets pretty gruesome at times.
B0001BKAEY|4.0|'Revolutions' Was Highly Understated Compared To The Other 'Matrix' Movies. But This Film Exceeded Where 'Reloaded' Failed In My Opinion: More Action, Less Tedious Dialogue Sessions.<br />In 'Reloaded' We Were Treated To Mind Numbing Dialogue, And Some Very Shallow Characters. 'Revolutions' Has Some Of The Same Characters, But They Do Not Appear As Much (Most Noticeably The Merovingian). Some Also Do Not Appear At All.<br />I Enjoyed 'Revolutions' Very Much. Once Again, It Is Still Not As Groundbreaking As The Original Flick, But It Is Still Decent. Any One Who Enjoyed The First Two Films Will Most Likely Also Enjoy This.<br />In My View I Enjoyed The Films From &quot;The Matrix&quot;, To &quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot;, And Lastly To &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot;. The Original, I Suppose, Is Always Better Than The Sequels.<br />The Saga Goes As This: Birth (&quot;The Matrix&quot;), Life (&quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot;), and Death (&quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot;). I Also Realized The First One Has Time Partly In The Matrix, And Partly In the Real World, The Second Movie Spends Most Of The Time In The Matrix, And The Third Movie Spends Most Of The Time In The Real World.<br />I Enjoyed The Action Sequences, Most Of All The End Scene With The Neo/Smith Showdown, Which Is Pretty Unpredictable In My View (The Music In That Scene Has A Nice Touch To It, With Choruses Singing Upanisands Transcripts). The Zion Fight With The Machines Is Intense, And Has Very Superb Special Effects (Better Compared To 'Reloaded' Effects).<br />So If You Want More Groundbreaking And New Stuff, Do Not Expect Anything Here. But Like I Said In My 'Reloaded' Review, If You Are A Hardcore Matrix Fan Like Me, You Would Most Definitely Enjoy This.
B00005JL3A|4.0|I have never played the games, nor do I know much of the story behind it. Perhaps that is good, because I won't like many reviewers be lamenting that it differs from it. Although to be honest, even if I did know the games I doubt I would care. I realise that movie versions of books and games differ, and as long as the story is good that's all that matters. I enjoyed this film, it wasn't a 'hide behind the sofa' film, but then these days, what is. We start with a bunch of people in an office slash science lab being killed. We do not know why but this grips us. We then cut to Milla Jovovich lying naked (covered by a shower curtain) in a bathroom. She doesn't seem to know where she is and gets flashes of memory. The action kicks off from there with SWAT like operatives storming the place along with a man who says he is local police. The action keeps on giving from there. People die in a myriad of ways, and you don't get a zombie here or there you get them BOOM all at once. I'm not sure if this is good or bad. One the one hand it makes the task of escaping (which they must do in an allotted time or be trapped forever) all the more impossible. On the other it's not a big shock when we see them all again, and again. The big creature wasn't scary, or rather, it was if we believed it to be real but I didn't. The dogs were scarier in that sense because they are more believable. I liked that the film had strong female characters. Now, I am no feminist but frankly, I'm sick of whiny, girls who want the man to rescue them. From the beginning, I knew Alice would kick booty, I mean the woman wears a pretty little dress, with combat boots. Michelle Rodrigez is a tougher chick but she also shows she has feelings and therefore doesn't feel one-dimensional. It's an interesting film with nice little twists. The soundtrack is both good and bad because it is by Marilyn Manson. I say that because as it's by him the film is labelled as a worthless teen flick, which is not the case. It's good because - and while some of his music does suck - the tracks included in the film are good. Not too gory, this again is both a blessing and a sin. It's a zombie film so we expect lots of gore but the fact not much is added makes it not just be about blood but has to have a plot too.<br />Diana
B0001HAHXW|5.0|Okay, I just had to do this to pull the album's ratings up from possibly the most unintelligent review I've ever seen on Amazon.  That Mr. Cranky guy...  you obviously never left the 80's along with Bon Jovi, who are and always have been a boy band with rock guitars.  They are good for parties and that's about it.  I'm not even a big Clapton fan to tell the truth, but you HAVE to respect the man for what he is:  a LEGEND IN HIS OWN TIME.  I hope you are not a guitarist yourself, because even making comparisons to a has-been group like Bon Jovi destoys all artistic credibility.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This is the best WWII movie that I have ever seen.  Spielberg and Hanks have done an amazing job with a very tough subject.  The German army was shown, in several instances, as a band of brothers too.  Maybe the reviewer below who only gave it one star didn't watch the entire thing.  I got it.  The vast majority of the german army was only following orders.  But it was the german army who was giving the orders.  This is an American movie, about American heroes.  Masterfully done.
B00003CXA6|5.0|I love this movie...! Despite a slow start, it's a very entertaining movie. Tom Berenger, Martin Sheen and Jeff Daniels were totally up to the parts and did a great job. I was also impressed by Richard Jordan(General Armistead), Patrick Gorman(General Hood) and Stephen Lang (General Pickett) who, by the way, did alot better as General Pickett than General Jackson in &quot;Gods and Generals&quot;. I disagree with those who feel that Robert Duvall did better as General Lee than Martin Sheen. We see more of Lee in &quot;Gettysburg&quot; than we do in &quot;Gods and Generals&quot; and therefore we get to know Lee  better in &quot;Gettysburg&quot; and Sheen did a great job of being the great General Robert Edward Lee, the best Army Commander America has ever seen. The scenes at Pickett's Charge are nothing short than stunning...! When that enourmous line of 15 000 Confederates advance across that field only to be slaughtered by the awaiting Yankees... Horrific.<br />In the end, the battle at Gettysburg decided the outcome of the Civil War. If General Lee had won again at Gettysburg, the Confederacy might have won the war. One can never know, but Lee's army never quite recovered after the defeat at Gettsyburg. <br />To put in General Lee's words: &quot;Too bad. Too bad... Oh! Too bad!!&quot;<br />Anyway, BUY THIS DVD for crying out loud!!
B000001F29|5.0|I cannot recall how many years ago it was that I first heard this (then)album. I only know that when my vinyl collection was lost, it was one of those I was not sure could be replaced. How very glad I am to be wrong! <BR>This coupling is one of the best fusions I have ever heard of music and voice. <BR>State of Independence to this day remains a musical masterpiece. Complex in it's simplicity, it seizes you with it's musical hooks while delivering a powerful message.
B00000099Y|5.0|You think MTV is shoving Tool down our throats? You got to be kidding me, MTV is a bunch of rap, Nsync and other queers who want to be nsync oh and all those sissy punk rock bands as they claim to be. They will never play TOOL and I hope they don't because for some reason if Tool gets on to TRL, kids will except them as being cool and will soon like them. Tool is music buddy, i don't know what the F*** you listen to, maybe 50 cent or some other MTV B.S, anyways don't listen to Nick and buy this album and don't watch MTV!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I loved this cd! It's awesome. Her best album yet. Here's what you need 2 know:<br />#1-Me Against The Music ft. Madonna-The 1st single. It's alright. Cool to dance to. Not the best track, but it's good. 7/10<br />#2-(I Got That)Boom Boom ft. Ying Yang Twins-Was a contender to be the 2nd single, but Toxic beat it. This is an AWESOME song. It's so fun. Ying Yang did their thing on this song. Great 2 dance 2.<BR>8.5/10<br />#3-Showdown-I LOVE this song. It's one of my fav's on the album. Should be a single, but probably won't be. Great R&B song. Reminds me of \\"Don't Go Knockin On My Door\\" from the \\"OOPS\\" album.<BR>10/10<br />#4-Breathe On Me- HOT song. The lyrics are really great. Reminds you of a Kylie Minogue song. This is a very sexy song. It's awesome. Another one of my fav's.<BR>9.5/10<br />#5-Early Mornin'-This song is alright. It had to grow in me. Not her best work, but it's cool. The lyrics are funny. Talking about having a hang-over and stuff. LOL.<BR>7/10<br />#6-Toxic-2nd single. AWESOME song. Sounds like it could have been the theme to like a James Bond or Mission Impossible movie. Great to dance 2!<BR>11/10<br />#7-Outrageous-This was also a contendor for 2nd single b4 being beaten out by Toxic. Great R&B song. Great track by R.Kelly who provides background vocals.<BR>10/10<br />#8-Touch of My Hand-The \\"self stimulation\\" song. LOL. It's actaully very good. Another favorite. <BR>10/10<br />#9-The Hookup-This track had 2 grow on me, but I LOVE it. It has a reggae vibe. If Sean Paul were on the track instead of the other person, it would be even better! Great song!<BR>9/10<br />#10-Shadow-I must admit, I didn't like this song at first, but I do now. Very beautiful lyrics. It's very sweet and sad.

B0000DG064|1.0|I wish I knew if this was widescreen or fullscreen. So much info missing on what you're buying. Buy them separate. At least you know what you're getting.
B0001IN07Q|5.0|Good, better, BEST! <BR>cd is superb - DVD super superb!<BR>Bubl. WOW! One listen/look and like me, you'll be hooked.
0385504209|4.0|(...)Unusual book in many ways: The beginning was not that great.  Some of the writing made me roll my eyes.  The dialogue is embarrassing at first.  The ending is a bit weak too.  It's almost like Mr. Brown couldn't resist a nice tight Hollywood ending.  By the way, contrary to what the 'reader' said, there is absolutely no sex in this book at all, which is a clear indication that Mr. 'As a Christian\\" didn't even read the book he claimed to read.<br />So why do I still give this best seller four stars?<br />The middle of the book is absolutely awesome. I couldn't put the darned thing down.  Brown interlaces a lot of cool ideas together.  His articulation about the significance of Mary Magdalene is incredible.  And the bottom line is that a lot of it rings truer than what the Catholic Church has doled out for the past two millenia, I am sorry to say.<br />And the book also makes you want to go and rent two movies:<br />The Last Temptation of Christ (which was an excellent film, by the way, and much much better than the current Mel Gibson fiasco) and<br />Eyes Wide Shut (the last film by Stanley Kubrick, a real moviemaker, unlike, you guessed it, Mel the Smell-as in, I smell MONEY).(...)  Enjoy. Review to your hearts content.
B000088E6D|5.0|Like the late greats, this gentleman has the tone and delivery that is so appealing and easy on the ears.<BR>I am very impressed with the song choices and the way in which Bubl leaves his own unique signature on each one - I mean, come on he covers everything from Queen to Sinatra and it works!
B0000033K2|5.0|This is a great collection.  I could do without disc 7, though; it's ok for one listen, and then that's it.  But the rest of the Heavyweight Champion is Jack Johnson strong.  Different versions of Naima, great version of Giant Steps, and so on.  Let his solos do their thing for your soul.
6305511055|4.0|Exciting and mostly plausible from start to finish, this is a fine film.  Of course it doesn't hurt that all the players are first rate.<br />After watching comic book movies with the likes of Tom Cruise and Keanu its fascinating to watch great actors, their facial expressions, their nuances.<br />The only flaw, I thought, was the naiive ending.  But still, thoroughly entertaining.
B00001U0E1|1.0|I saw this in the theater, and while semi entertaining, did not move me. I watched it again day before last and though I appreciate the costumes (some discrepancies), the music, and the ending which truly saved this movie from being absolutely rancid I still cannot get past the fact that this beat out Saving Private Ryan as Best Picture.<BR>Saving Private Ryan stuck with me for days, weeks, and now years, I forgot this drivel an hour after I watched it. Forget Romeo and Juliet, forget the heartbroken 'Will' Shakespeare, the only real tragedy was that this movie won Best Picture.
B000000OSG|4.0|Had So Fine been out of the picture in favor of a rock song on par with Civil War or You Could Be Mine it probably would have been given a higher rating.All the songs are excellent except the godawful So Fine and Get In The Ring.Its really too bad that they didnt have the album have ALL good songs but its still very entertaining.It doesnt rock as hard as Use Your Illusion 1 but it still rocks pretty hard with Shotgun Blues and Locomotive plus 14 Years and Civil War not to mention the best song on the album You Could Be Mine.In my opinion that song is worth the price alone.Its a strong album but a little bland in places.Shotgun Blues should have been done a couple more times until it sounded as heavy and punkish as Perfect Crime but that is forgiven with most of the other songs and you should buy it anyway.
B000000WJZ|5.0|This CD is really the best cd I have ever owned, a classic to say the least. Although Pearl Jam Vs. is a close second. The music on this is just straight ahead rock with no gimics as they used in other albums. By far best Pumpkins cd.
B000089CJI|4.0|The Postal Service is the electronic-pop combination of Death Cab For Cutie's Ben Gibbard and Dntel's Jimmy Tambarello. I was a little skeptical coming into listening to this album on whether or not i would like it, but i was not dissapointed. It was much much better than i had expected. The songs are not too drawn out and boring, which i myself find in many synth-driven songs. In fact, many are quite catchy and have a sing along quality. Highlights include &quot;Such Great Heights&quot; and &quot;Sleeping In.&quot;<br />Rating: Four stars.
B00000JCOV|1.0|HA, ya right. This band is horribly cliched, they're about as &quot;metal,&quot; as good charolette. You want metal get &quot;Dying Fetus, or Cannibal Corpse, or Dimmu Borgir,&quot; not this becuase this is pretty much skin head metal (aka for stupid bald kids from the south,) Anyway, DO NOT BUY THIS, DO NOT BUY KORN, THEY ARE ALL TRL &quot;METAL,&quot;
B000002LK1|5.0|Viloator is not only DM's best album ever but also a real classic and a must for every pop music collector. It is an album that seals DM's (...) 80s and shapes their sober and down-to-earth 90s. It is an album that expresses pain mostly, and it seeps out of the lyrics and highly intesified by dark and forceful music. It is truely a continuous perfection. No wonder then that the following album, Songs Of Faith And Devotion, could not achieve such heights.
B0001BKAEY|3.0|I'm dissapointed to see that there's still no commentary tracks by the Wachowski brotehrs.  Reloaded, I could kinda understand, but now that the trilogy is over, what's the deal with no comments from the creators about the trilogy as a whole?<br />The documentaries are nice, but don't really provide any new in depth look.  We've seen how they do the stunts, we saw the decomposition of bullet time on the original matrix dvd.  And by now, CG animation is no longer state of the art technology.  It's in just about every movie that uses any special effects.  no big deal there.<br />So the features on the dvd gets a 2 star rating from me, it doesn't seem like there's enough special features to warrant a second disc.<br />As for the movie, well unfortunately it still could not match up with the original.  Just like reloaded, it suffered a similar problem as many sequels, it just didn't meet my expectations.  Overall it was better than reloaded.  The fight scene between smith and neo is much better in the third, and much more reminiscient of the original.  <br />That was the one thing about reloaded that really turned sour for me.  Neo became invinsible and arrogant inside the matrix, and there was nothing that threatened him.  Agents were scary, and all powerful in the first movie, in the second they were a joke.  Defeated without even breaking a sweat.  Even Morphius didn't think twice about going up against an agent again in reloaded.<br />In Revolutions, it was good to see things going back.  There was a sense of danger again, and that failure may be possible.  If there's nothing to lose, then it just doesn't excite me.<br />Overall, I'd say they wrapped everything up pretty nicely.  Didn't leave any huge questions hanging at the end, although I can't help but feeling sad at how it all ended, and the price that had to be paid to obtain peace.  But such is life.<br />I'll give the movie itself a 4.<br />That makes my final star rating for the DVD = 3.
B00008H2LB|5.0|Anyone who is a true [LP] fan should buy this CD!!! Meteora is one of the few CDs that I can listen to over and over again w/out getting tired of it. If you liked any of there other CDs you'll LOVE this one!
B0001DI0FI|4.0|When I say dull, I don't necessarily mean boring, but rather confusing or unnecessary.  Not to spoil anything, but one fight in the movie is incredibly disorienting.  I wasn't sure who was winning or, for the most part, what I was looking at.  If not for this chaotic, sub-par fight sequence, the movie would have received five stars from me.  True, a fight in a dark and dank ship would not be as clear and clear to watch as two knights on horses, but the way it was filmed took me out of the world of the film while I tried to make sense of what my eyes were telling me.<br />The rest of the movie, however, is of the highest calibre.  Russell Crowe turns in another wonderful performance as the captain, and the rest of the cast gives a wonderful feeling of being on a real ocean-going sea vessel.<br />Watch out for the first character you see on film:  don't let his size fool you, nobody in this movie is the size of a hobbit!
0316666343|5.0|This is one of those rare gems. I wished it would never end. It was so easy to lose myself in the depth of the characters. And they lingered with me long after I finished reading it. I can think of words like meloncholly, beautiful, gut-wrenching, horrific, touching, but these words are really inadequate to describe the experience that you'll have when reading this book. I agreed with most people, read this one!
0966638328|4.0|This is quite a practical book on how to express, how to talk with colours. You don't find cultural or history thoughts on it.<br />Nothing about Van Gogh, nothing about Mondrian.<br />But you can find ways to efective use colours in marketing or web interfaces, for instance.<br />It's more a book to look at than a book to read. It's pretty well illustrated, mainly with ads.
B0001AP12G|1.0|How boring...and did the whole World get brainwashed for a minute?...Highly over rated..the sped up vocals have been done to death, Kanye's beats all sound the same, he is a poor MC...<br />I often wonder if he wasnt associated with Jay-Z how many kids would check for him...there is nothing new or original on this album Kanye is NOT a saviour a Hip Hop and this album is weak and boring, as a rap listener since 1982 I have seen too much hype over substance this is a clear case of that.
B000005AYM|4.0|Erica Wright, a.k.a. artiste's persona Erykah Badu is the QUEEN of NEO-SOUL. She first established herself with fellow R&B singer D'Angelo in 1997, and has prevailed through the cynical music industry without turning her back to her morals, always staying decent! But her best efforts still remain in her classical Grammy winning effortlessly-excellent debut \\"BADUIZM\\". <br />I am so glad, my friend suggested/gave me a copy of Erykah. Now I am hooked, I am a fan and respect this creative \\"spiritually-free\\" artist. I became a Mizz Badu fan only in 2003 -after telling my friend I loved India.Arie and Jill Scott. <br />At the time I was a refreshment of R&B, and now it still is, becoming an example of what a Neo-Soul album should be. Blending the classical soulfulness with hip-hop. Even now this is a fresh breath of air. An organic and the Roots-y (pun intended) R&B Record. <br />\\"Rim Shot\\" is a lively intro which shows listeners that Erykah is not a one-trick pony, and not an immitator -she likes to break the rules of Art. But it's on \\"On & On\\" that got her a Grammy. But my personal favorite is the intelligent and liberating \\"Appletree\\". <br />Erykah makes believable life situations sound pleasurable and real on tracks like \\"Next Lifetime\\", \\"No Love\\" and the classy piano-driven \\"Certainly\\" and it's more funky remix. \\"Certainly\\" is so individual that it takes me back to the time of Nina Simone. <br />Also the interludes/skits are so fine and artistic, unlike common homogenised R&B interlude [i.e. Janet Jackson]. But my favorite songs on this album are: \\"4 Leaf Clover\\" and it's catchy tune and sexy message, and \\"Drama\\" with it's Stevie Wonder's \\"Pastime Paradise\\" excerpt. (Race relation/Segregation/Miseducation) <br />Overall this album was pleasing, and I'm so overjoyed I got to listen and have Erykah and Baduizm in my music collection. Erykah is now in my Top 10 Fav Artists, she is such a creative, intelligent and ingenious Pisces. <br />Erykah Badu's major feature as anartist is not her intelligent street-wise lyrics or her music instruments but her voice. Sounding very trained with a touch of Billie Holiday and Nina Simone, her voice matches her genre perfectly. Jazzy and Soulful. People are saying that Fantasia Barrino of American Idol 3 has an individual voice, they certainly havn't heard Erykah's, proving she is under-rated. Also Erykah's voice doesn't get annoying after a few songs.
B000021YQV|5.0|Toxicity is an amazing album. I've never heard anything like this before. It's so unique.<br />The first System song I heard was Chop Suey, and at first I didn't like it. I thought it just didn't work. I didn't get what the whole thing about System was. And anyone in the same situation as me, just listen to it.<br />But as I heard it more, it grew on me. Their sound is so unique, you'll either love it, or you'll hate it. And personally, I love it.<br />My favourite songs of the album are Chop Suey and Bounce. Chop Suey is an amazing song. It almost seems like it's in 2 parts - a slow emotional part, and a faster, harder rock part. And yet these 2 fit together to make something amazing.<br />Bounce just makes me laugh. If anyone has been to badgerbadgerbadger.com, it reminds me of that. It's a really upbeat, funny song. And the only way it could be improved is by making it longer. Come on, you're only giving us 2 minutes of this!!<br />Anyone who is slightly hesitant about System - and I don't blame you if you are, I was, should definitely listen to this. It's an incredible CD and when you've heard it once, you'll want to hear it more and more and more.

B00006879E|5.0|I caught the last minute or so of &quot;Harder to Breathe&quot; on The Box a while back and it stuck in my head instantly. The tune was great - so easy to remember, the lead singer had an amazing voice and not to mention, was so good looking!<br />I decided to follow this up and heard some of their other songs, including &quot;This Love&quot; and &quot;Shiver.&quot;<br />Maroon 5 are in a class of their own. They incorperate so many different kinds of music into their sound - there's soul, punk and rock. And yet, these 3 very different sounds blend together perfectly.<br />&quot;Songs about Jane&quot; is a very real album. The songs come from real life experience and you can hear the emotion. This album doesn't have one bad song on it - they're all so unique, and so amazing! This album is a definite must have for fans of great music :) xx

B00005QIPH|5.0|How anyone can badmouth The Strokes is beyond me. I love The Strokes and here's why:<br />I first heard Last Nite and the song instantly got stuck in my head. The words were amazing and so was the tune. It was infectious, and when I heard this song, I knew I had to hear more.<br />I got their album soon after this, and I have never got tired of this album. The Strokes have a very unique sound, very different to other bands around at the moment. The guitar solos are amazing and really stand out in the middle of songs.<br />So, before you decide to badmouth The Strokes, why not sit down and listen to this album? Why not sit down and listen to the amazing, inspring, unique album. Let's see if you hate it then.<br />For lovers of anything unique, this is for you. I adore this album and I know I will never get tired of it. You should buy this now because it's a total must-have for anyone.
0198117477|5.0|What is so great about this book is that the complete works of William Shakespeare are not only written, but also given extraordinary introductions to each play that are brilliantly written by Stanley Wells. The plays are presented in chronological order, and the introductions give newcomers to Shakespeare's work an understanding of what each play is all about, as well as the history behind it. \\"King Lear\\" is included both as it was originally written, as well as Shakespeare's revision of it years later.<br />There is an in-depth glossary at the back of the book that will help the new reader of this work understand many of the words that were written in the plays at that point of time. Another wonderful addition is an index to the first line of sonnets, and the page that sonnet can be found on.<br />This revised book will bring readers of Shakespeare's work closer to their original meaning thanks to the painstaking updating, while keeping the original titles in tact. I highly recommend this book for its wisdom, revisions, and the new understanding you will gain from the brilliance of centuries long gone, that have stood the test of time.<br />Barbara Rose, author of, `Individual Power' and `If God Was Like Man'

B00005JKC3|2.0|Of all the much-hyped Superhero movies to come out in the past 10 years or so, this one has to rank as the biggest blunder.  I had hoped that Hollywood would be able to make a smooth transformation of the HULK to the big screen, but my hopes were dashed by this debacle.<br />It is granted that the Hulk portrayed in this film bears a far closer resemblance to the comic book hero than did the 1970s TV series starring Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno(sp?).  The Hulk really was supposed to be gigantic &amp; not just a body builder in green paint.<br />However, the present film lacks the heart of the 1970s TV series.  In sum, I did not care nearly so much about this Banner  / Hulk as I did for the ones depicted in the 1970s.  It is this lack of heart that contributes to this movie's ultimate demise.<br />In all Superhero movies, one of the biggest obstacles to delivering a quality movie is coming up with a cohesive plot that will take a few hours to display.  On that point, this film failed utterly.  To be sure, it was all fine &amp; well (not to mention great fun!) to see the Hulk abducted by the army and have to fight his way out of their gauntlet.<br />Beyond that, however, the plot of the film fizzles out.  The ending seems to be more tacked on than anything else - like they couldn't think of anything better to do before running the credits.  There is no internal friction or arch villain for the Hulk to take on.<br />The direction style is also in the realm of the bizarre.  They keep on showing frame-in-frame footage that (ostensibly?) is supposed to depict a comic book style.  Instead of being innovative or adding anything to the movie, it comes off as tiresome and confusing.  The director of the film should get no brownie points for that hare-brained idea!<br />There are two redeemable variables in this movie:  the eye-candy special effects &amp; Jennifer Connolley.  The special effects are fun to watch and do not disappoint.  Jennifer Connolley is both drop-dead gorgeous + she's a fine actress.  However, not even Connolley can save this movie.<br />So, with that in mind, if you're interested in seeing a good portrayal of the Hulk character, pick up the pilot &amp; other episodes of the 1970s television show.  They're now available on DVD from Amazon.com.  Don't waste your time w/this dud.gorgeous + she's a fine actress.

B00000K0T8|5.0|With its deadly combination of razor-edged lyricism and bedrock-hard beats, this album is as indestructible as the superhero from which it takes its name.<BR>This CD alone has more classic joints on it than the average rapper drops in his career. With its versatile range of tracks from the rugged &quot;Winter Warz&quot; to the heartfelt &quot;All That I Got Is You&quot; this album is not one to miss out on.<BR>Heh, I'm not the greatest reviewer ever... but seriously, this album ain't somethin' to be slept on. Cop it and see for yourself!
B0001I55OC|4.0|I read the book, Timeline for a project for my English Class. It was the best book that I have ever read. I usually do not enjoy reading all that much, but I finished the book in 2 days. It was amazing. Then I went to see the movie. I am amazed that people are calling it trash! True, many things are different between the book an the movie, but just because some things are different doesn't make it bad! This movie was really good! Maybe the acting is not as good as it is in say, The Lord of the Rings or Pirates of the Caribbean, but it is still a really good movie! I thought that the movie could have been much better, but it is still good! I guess everyone&amp;#146;s opinion on this movie is different, but If you want to know If i think you should buy it, the answer is yes.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|When I first heard &quot;When the Pawn...&quot;, I have to admit that I didn't like it very much. It wasn't so much that I didn't like the songs; this album is just so completely opposite of &quot;Tidal&quot; that it intimidated me a little bit. On a few more listens, I ended up enjoying this one the most. I listen to it on a daily basis, sometimes more than once a day.<br />Things get started with &quot;On the Bound&quot;, &quot;To Your Love&quot;, and &quot;Limp&quot;, three angry, driving, and powerful songs. &quot;To Your Love&quot; contains some of my favorite lyrics of Fiona's - &quot;My derring-do allows me to dance the rigadoon around you/But by the time I'm close to you, I lose my desideratum and now you/So now you have it&quot;. &quot;Limp&quot;, I would say, is the best of the three. The verses are soft and crescendo louder and more aggressive into the chorus where Fiona proclaims: &quot;Call me crazy/hold me down/make me cry/get off now baby/it won't be long till you'll be lying limp in your own hands&quot;. <br />The fourth track, &quot;Love Ridden&quot; is a quiet, calm love ballad, a drastic change from the album's beginning. But even in the ballads of this album, a little bit of anger always comes out. After the first chorus, she sings bitterly &quot;My hand won't hold you down no more/the path is clear to follow through&quot;. After this is &quot;Paper Bag&quot;, one of my favorites. Even with it's anti-love lyrics, it still manages to sound uplifting with its quirky music and the bounce in Fiona's voice. This song is probably one of the best, lyrically, on the album. &quot;And I went crazy again today/looking for a strand to climb/looking for a little hope/Baby said he couldn't stay/wouldn't put his lips to mine/and a fail to kiss is a fail to cope&quot;.<br />&quot;A Mistake&quot; and &quot;Fast as you Can&quot; go back towards the original anger of the first few tracks. &quot;Fast as you Can&quot; was the first single released and changes temposdrastically and suddenly. She almost talks through the verses and chorus which are very fast-paced until suddenly, it turns into a smooth, drawn-out, jazzy feel, then back into it's frantic pace. &quot;The Way Things Are&quot; is probably my least favorite. A lot of people I've talked to say it's one of the best, but it just doesn't grab me as much as the others.<br />&quot;Get Gone&quot; is a bitter mid-tempo track. The quiet verses turn into strong choruses in which Fiona sings confidently &quot;I do know what's good for me/and I've done what I could for you/but you're not benefiting/instead I'm sitting singing again&quot;. &quot;I Know&quot; is my favorite and is last on the album, but definitely not least. It is a beautiful ballad and as she says, probably the closest to a happy ending her songs will ever get. At one point, she proclaims angrily &quot;Baby I can't help you out/while she's still around&quot; but by the end with the hope for everything to work out, says &quot;If it gets too late for me to wait/for you to find you love me and tell me so/it's ok/don't need to say it&quot;. This album is even better than &quot;Tidal&quot; and definitely deserves your attention.
B00005ATQD|5.0|Eyes Wide Shut is an appropriate ending to Stanley Kubrick's career. The fact that he was unable to see it's general release makes it that much more mysterious.<br />This is a visceral experience on the highest order. Secret societies, love, marriage, sex, infidelity, self doubt, and numerous other themes only begin to describe this fantastic film.<br />Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman give an outstanding performance. A truly underrated masterpiece.
B000002BE9|5.0|I recently discovered Fiona Apple's music and I have to admit, I was really missing out on something amazing. She is extremely talented; Fiona composed the music, wrote the lyrics, and plays the piano (amazingly) on every song except for &quot;Criminal&quot;. And on top of that, her voice is very versatile. She switches from extremely low sultry tones to a high, airy voice like nothing. I would be lucky to have a quarter of the talent she was blessed with.<br />The main highlight of the album, for me, would have to be &quot;Never is a Promise&quot;. It is a beautiful ballad with the perfect everything - lyrics, voice, instrumentation. It blows me away everytime. Her writing is very well-developed and mature, considering she wrote some of these songs as young as fourteen. The last chorus is the emotional high-point of the entire song, it just keeps building up to that last moment: &quot;You'll say you understand, you'll never understand/I'll say I'll never wake up knowing how or why/I don't know what to believe in, you don't know who I am/You'll say I need appeasing when I start to cry/But never is a promise and I'll never need a lie&quot;. Amazing.<br />The lowpoint, even though every song is awesome in its own right, would have to be one of the last three tracks. Her voice is probably in its lowest form on &quot;The Child is Gone&quot; but it isn't by any means a bad song. The afore-mentioned and &quot;Pale September&quot; tend to drag out making the end of the album seem far away. The last song is &quot;Carrion&quot;. I didn't enjoy it much at first, but it has grown on me. It is very versatile, beginning in verses and music nearly as soft as a whisper and turning into angry vocals and loud music by the chorus. If you don't have this CD, you should really check it out. It is high above most other CDs I own.
B000089CPF|3.0|My first introduction to Calexico was seeing them playing live at Somerset House in London in the summer of 2003, and they were absolutely breathtaking.  As with all live bands, the studio album is always something of a anticlimax, as it's almost impossible to recreate the atmosphere and rush of seeing them live.  Still, it's a grower of an album and is a must for any respectable record collection.
6304806418|3.0|I don't like Madonna but I have to admit she tried so hard to pull this role off and almost succeeded. Her voice is a pop voice. This role calls for a powerful singer and anyone who saw Patti LuPone do this role on Broadway will be struck with how unsuited Madonna's voice is for it. But she did try. Her dancing is fine, her look is almost right. She was too old to play young Eva and too robust looking to play sick, dying Eva but did a passable job as Eva at her height. And then there was the acting problem. Sometimes she was well grounded in the character and sometimes all you could see was Madonna just going through the motions pretending to be Evita. She and Jonathan Pryce had no chemistry at all and that was a flaw. The Perons may not have been a love match but they were a powerful team and it just didn't come across that way in the movie. The best thing about the movie is Antonio Banderas as the sarcastic, angry and ultimately shocked and heartbroken Che. He's not playing the historical Che of course but Che as a sort of smarter than the masses Greek chorus who follows Eva around pointing out the truth of her pretenions. <br />This was a beautiful looking movie. It's a big overgrown music video but a strangely unsatisfying effort. If you loved Evita you'll be happier just buying one of the Broadway or London recordings but avoid the movie soundtrack at all costs--with no visual distractions the shortcomings of Madonna's voice are downright painful.
B0001907DA|3.0|Well ok let's face it. This series is perhaps the worst in the world if you want to get police references.<BR>However, I really don't think that the true daily police life was the point to the film. If you listen to the commentary for the first movie, the director, and cast members admit that really was not the point of the movies.<BR>The point was to make people laugh and try something different during the time. It's great because no one dies and it really is just for laughs.<BR>So if you don't think you'll be offended by the most insane police deceptive work and wacky one liners. Then this is a great box set for you.<BR>But if your the exact opposite. Then just simply don't buy it.
0375759174|2.0|Many of the references Austen made in Northanger Abbey were meant to be satirical towards the gothic writing style prevalent in her time. Certain elements of wordplay in her characters' dialogue will also sound dated to a modern reader. For example, Catherine describes a popular gothic novel as being &quot;Horrible&quot;, which can be taken as &quot;Awful&quot; or that the book was scary, which is a way the word was used in the author's time.<br />    Having said this, the book is slow, and is not as easy and interesting to read as her other novels, which can be explained by saying that this is her first attempt, and improvement was inevitable.  The characters were not well-developed; I didn't understand the love-interest and I didn't believe that these two people were suited for each other. Again, she improved later.<br />If you choose to read this book, try to get an edition with notes on the text.It will help a great deal in clarifying that which is now a centuries-old inside joke.
B00005JMX4|5.0|first off i must state a fact. Elisha Cuthbert is the hottest thing since the sun. this movie delivers with its sexy comedy making you beg for more. it made me roll laughing from start to finish! Elisha Cuthbert stole the movie. i loved this movie and DONT BRING YOUR CHILDREN TO IT! the last and most important thing is. i would give my left nut if blazing hot porn stars went for the nerds instead of the jocks. if only it were true.
B00009W0U4|3.0|The controversy attached to 'Irreversible' no doubt stemmed from such audacity of the director to include such reastically graphic portrayals of violence and rape.  Portrayal of the former involved a scene in which a man's head was crushed repeatedly and brutally with a fire extinguisher in the name of revenge. However, it is the 10 minute rape scene, in which all the nuances of humiliation, degradation and sheer animalism of rape is open for full-view exhibition, that caused the public outcry for the film's ban (unsuccessfully in Australia).<BR>   What was the point of such gratuity?  Many say it was unnecessary to go to such extremes to prove a point.  But it is important to realise that in the real world, these occurrences are commonplace.  The film is a study of the dark side human nature. Ultimately it argues that violence is blind, destroying everything in its path, leaving a trail of irreparable damage in its wake. The violence stems from man's evil; the rapist simply wanted to use Belucci's character (Alex) for his own pleasure. This violence then begets more violence, as Alex's partner Marcus rampages through the night-life to find the perpetrator.  Yet in the end, the man that suffered his vengeance and rage was not the rapist.  And so the chain reaction initiated by one man's self-indulgence and morally reprehensible decision to rape led to the spiralling destruction of many other lives.   <BR>   The title refers to the structure of the film, as viewers watch the cascade of events in reverse from the opening where Marcus and Pierre storm through a gay BDSM club, leading to the bashing of a man with the fire extinguisher, to the rape then to more happier times before these tragedies. The image of the beautiful untouched Belucci laying peacefully on luscious green grass helps to draw the movie to a conclusion. This reverse chronology detaches us as viewers from any empathy we may have for the Marcus and Pierre, inhibiting us from labelling their acts of retaliation as heroic and justified, such that we are able to witness the extent of their reprehensible behaviour, regardless of the motivation. But it also helps to soften the heavy blow delivered by such a dark and pessimistic (\\"Time destroys all things\\") film by concluding with a picturesque, almost niave and innocent view of the world.    <BR>   While the film does raises genuine thought-provoking issues, it loses points for times of blatant pretention namely, amongst other inane attempts for the avant-garde, the swirling camera angle lasting for the first 20 or so minutes of the film acheiving nothing except to make the audience nauseous. And the attempts to explain the events as some act of fate via visions in dreams destabilises the foundation for the film's arguments as it suddenly and paradoxically argues that the horrors of life do not arise from bad decisions of some but, ludicrously, from some cosmically regulated force. Moreover, the inclusion of the gay club was an attempt to increase shock value. To discriminate against gay people by placing them in a negative context indicates the homophobic contention of the writers/director and only serves to magnify the myopia in the movie's vision.      <BR>   A movie not for the faint-hearted to the weak-in-stomach.  This piece is an insightful human study but alas, succumbed to the desire to appeal the the pretentious art-house crowd.
0380789035|5.0|This is one of those rare books that you can't wait to get back to, once you start it.  It grabs hold of you and keeps your interest from start to finish.  The characters are fleshed out in detail, and even now, five months after I finished this gem, I can tell you about many of the characters in this book, as if I actually met them at some time in my life!  I highly recommend this book!
0061020710|5.0|My introduction to Pratchett, and very possibly one of the best books I've ever read. Pratchett has a very unique sense of humour, and his writing is excellent. I will be reading the sequel, The Light Fantastic, shortly.
B00000JCOV|3.0|I first got introduced to Slipknot when I saw heard their sample of 'spit it out' on some music mag's sample cd. Well, I think to myself..&quot;They should be scary no? Perhaps they're music is good.&quot; Well, all I can say is that they are is technical as anyone who wants to start an amateur recording studio. It was a novelty (now it's not), and I'm not saying that their music is bad. They have put in the effort, just not ample to drive my taste. (just my taste.) If you're looking for power, try 'Iowa'. If you're looking to hear how they started, get this. But if you're really tight on cash and is itching for some good music of this genre, I'd suggest Professional Murder Music's self-titled album. Further more, the front-man of Slipknot is getting to be quite a 'pop-icon'. Good for him. Corey Taylor's the name yes?
0743243307|5.0|I can't remember the last novel I read that created such a wonderful character as Nazneen. I thought of Faulkner when reading the italicized passages about her sister.  The little philosophic twists of insight throughout the novel completed for me what was the ultimate reading experience.
0767817478|4.0|Ok Ok Most people who saw this Gozilla thought it sucked. I think it didn't though. The reason most people don't like this Godzilla is because Godzilla doesn't have an enemy to face plus the raptors and there being 2 Godzilla's (or at least that's what I think). But I loved it because it took place in New York instead of always being in Japan, Godzilla just being himself, the mouths of the people actually going with the words, and a good cast.
B00006BTCA|3.0|None of the hip magazines told me that the Strokes and Devo combined to make an album!  This is pretty good stuff, in a robotic, New York City-like way.  Devo's melody-free irony mixed with the Strokes irony-laden lyrics and constant guitar-strummed chiming...pretty good indeed.<br />Hey, I heard that Hagar is back with Halen.  Is this true?  If so, what about David &quot;the maniac&quot; Roth?  I thought he was back in the fold.  Someone please leave message.<br />BYE!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00018D44U|3.0|After scanning some of the opinions expressed here I wanted to note my disappointment with FEELS LIKE HOME, but unlike many others I don't feel any need to hurl insults at the artist and those who don't agree with me.  I considered COME AWAY WITH ME to be an excellent debut, and after absorbing this one for several months I'm finding that while the vocals, musicianship, and songs are above-average, it's as if the sum is less than the parts, whereas on the debut the sum was greater.  I think I've pinpointed my disappointment to the diminishing jazz presence, because 1) my favorite track, the Norah-alone &quot;Don't Miss You At All&quot; (built upon Duke Ellington's &quot;Melancholia&quot;), is the only cut significantly based in jazz, and 2) I've been more moved and challenged by her cameo appearances with the likes of Wax Poetic, Charlie Hunter and even Outkast (&quot;Take Off Your Cool&quot;), where Norah's distinctive, attractive voice is heard in more progressive musical settings.<br />The bottom line is I'd recommend this CD if you have an affinity for country music, but if you're looking for some jazz in your pop, FEELS LIKE HOME seems to have misplaced that side of her musical personality (unlike the prior CD which had more of an eclectic balance).  To me, the jazz-free zone on most of the album is a bit odd given how up-front-and-center that genre was in her musical life prior to her solo career.  I'm glad Ms. Jones has the freedom to take her music in any direction she wants, but I'm about ready to jump off the bandwagon because she's getting too far away from the types of music that I'm attracted to.  Different strokes for different folks, I guess.
B000002GVO|5.0|Once upon a decade, Los Angeles and the whole Southern California ethos was defined by the simple surfer longings of the Beach Boys and by the lure of the Wonderful World of Disney, underlined by the promise of Hollywood fantasies filled if you just got noticed by the right man in the right restaurant.<br />Suddenly the seventies happened, and along came &quot;Hotel California.&quot; The Eagles had already established that they were a high quality rock band with aspirations to a heck of a lot more, and what they did with this album (along with Fleetwood Mac's &quot;Rumours&quot;) was to repaint the picture of Hollywood as a shiny bauble that barely hid a monster of vapid consumerism and greed, fed by drugs and ego, swarming with sharks in the shallows. To that extent, &quot;Hotel California&quot; not only played as an album that soundtracked a period, but defined it.<br />The key element here was probably the inclusion of Guitarist Joe Walsh, whose guitar playing provided the kick behind &quot;Life In The Fast Lane&quot; and the slink in the album's title track. Along with &quot;New Kid In Town,&quot; these hit singles made listeners around the world take note of the seamy underside of the American Dream that had slowly disintegrated in the post-Watergate years, when disco-fueled cocaine cowboys would sell you &quot;paradise&quot; in little boxes as they laughed up their corporate sleeves.<br />Yup, pretty dark stuff, this. Yet it remains the Eagle's finest recorded single album, even with the misstep of &quot;Wasted Time.&quot; And oddly enough, some 20 years later, &quot;Life In The Fast Lane's&quot; hapless couple still sound as clueless, current and today in Dubya's 2004 as they did in the consumer-take-all world of the Bicentennial of 1976.

B00003CXBK|2.0|like his other films, miyazaki presents a new and unique story with outstanding visual components.  the gods and demons, the spirits and monsters really succeed in capturing one's imagination.  but instead of being enchanted and moved...i was scared, and disturbed.  one can argue the human imagaination is limitless.  but some things just don't make any sense.  towards the end, the forest spirit becomes this big blob of a bubble, this greyish, bluish, speckled goo that kills anything it touches.  the tree spirits are these mushroom like thingies that seem like they're high on drugs because of their abnormal wide, eyes and smile even when they are dying.  one word- C R E E P Y.  i dunno maybe you like this kinda anime, maybe you'll understand it.  i mean, i got the point, the lesson is clear.  but, ehh, think of a ugly boar with thousands of worms coming out of it's nose, eyes, and skin that could infest anybody.  in this particular movie, i think the moments of awkwardness, weirdness, and unneccessary violence (cutting of of legs, arms, and heads suddenly) outnumbers the good things.  i wouldn't watch it again.  kudos to the scenery, music, and the lush,beautiful forest scenes.  otherwise, watch spirited away a few more times instead.

B0001BKAEY|4.0|you know what?  i really liked it.  others may disagree and find it disappointing, but i found it incredibly entertaining.  there are moments in this movie that are truly inspiring and breathtaking.  i found myself really caring about these characters.  i went through anger, sadness, hope, and happiness while watching this movie.  matrix was awesome, reloaded was just plain bad, and revolutions is beautiful.  i think the reason why people dont like it is because they're not looking for beautiful in the matrix.  but the amount of courage and bravery displayed is very touching.  i was moved...&quot;we'll give them hell!&quot; and &quot;as long as he has a single breath in his body, he will never give up&quot;.  &quot;why do you go on when you know you're going to lose?&quot; mr. smith asks neo.  this is a story of triumph over loss, of hope through overwhelming odds.

B0001I55OC|2.0|this movie was alright but it could've been a lot better.  i didn't particularly like the cast.  this movie really shows that paul walker can't really act.  there are some intense moments but they become unmemorable and fade away.  it isn't even that entertaining.  just a movie to watch if you're bored or if there's nothing else good to watch.  let me tell you though, the book by michael crichton is VERY, VERY GOOD.  i got so much more out of the book than watching this movie.  the movie lacks depth and meaning while the book actually brings you back to the midieval times and makes you experience hell.  it is terrifying, gripping, and interesting.  the movie is...not.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|For those of us that love the clever witty banter of the Buffy universe, you must buy this DVD set.  The world is rich with colour by way of an interesting mix of Asian and Old Western cultures.  The characters and world will draw you in, you are helpless to stop it and you will leave every episode wanting more.<br />Those that didn't take to this series when it was on TV would be well served to buy this box set as well.  The original pilot wasn't shown on TV until the end, but, when viewed first (Joss ordered the episodes properly here) I know of at least one person that said, &quot;Now it makes sense&quot; and started enjoying the show as much as I did.<br />I have also shown this series to numerous people and have yet to find someone that didn't love it from the start.  I highly recommend this box set to anyone.

0060589272|5.0|Having not read any of Paulo Coelho's novel prior to this one, I cannot say whether it is typical or not.  However, in the forward, he apologizes to some readers that have praised previous works, that this novel is not quite like the rest.  Regardless, it is an excellent read.<br />Maria is a young introspective Brazilian woman, who also records in her diaries, her thoughts on the nature of the world from a very young age. Very young by not responding to a boy's request for a pencil, she felt she lost an opportunity for her eventual soul mate. She is a very young woman intent on fulfilling her destiny of one day being a wife and mother.  As with many people, life often brings much different than what we have planned and it works out that Maria ends up going to Geneva, Switzerland to pursue fame and fortune. All the while Maria is living her life, she is noting what she experiences and sees and is trying to piece together how life and love work.<br />Unfortunately, her plans in Switzerland fall through and Maria is presented an opportunity quite unplanned for.  She enters the world of prostitution.  Maria quickly learns the rules of the game.  In her diaries, she is concerned about the affect her profession is having on her perception of love.  She theorizes that so many people put so much importance on a single act, so much fear, planning and importance, that when boiled down, the act is a mere 11 minutes.  Hence the title of the book.<br />While working as a prostitute and justifying its separation of sex from love, Maria meets a artist that professes his disinterest in sex, in fact he says he is bored with it. Maria suspecting he is no different than the others, just using different lines, initially continues the friendship at a distance, all the while suspecting his motives. Her artist friend always comments on \\"her light\\" which he can said he could see upon their first meeting when he sketched her in a restaurant.  Each time they meet their conversation is cloaked in much symbolism as the Road to Santiago and the significance of certain things. As time goes on Maria due to her association with the artist is drawn into some of the club she works for special clientele and explores a side of sex that she finds intriguing and is not exactly part of her theory as yet.<br />Without going further and ruining the story, Maria's running dialogue in her mind and in the diaries she writes shows and intelligent albeit superstitious young woman's way of dealing with the sex trade's disassociation of sex with love.  Her thoughts and theories are intriguing and quite compelling. Her conversations with the older librarian she befriends and the young artist are interesting in both what is included and omitted from her conversation and the reasoning why.  Also you are provided with some of the librarian's thoughts and feelings from an entirely different prospective.  This was as revealing in a different sense.<br />Some might find the material a bit to risqu&eacute;, however, given the fact the story clearly is about a prostitute, this should not be surprising.  In many ways it is more tame than some of the prime time TV shows.<br />I find the book compelling in the sense that it treats the subject as most people would when thinking about what to do, the moral justification, the concerns, the mysticism about the way to or not to act.  There are milestones in a person's life and the character Maria clearly had a sense of when several were met in her life.<br />I would definitely read more from this writer.ked in much symbolism as the Road to Santiago and the significance of certain things.

B00008ADPF|5.0|I think people are being a little hard on this CD, but this is not a bad CD.  Long Road, is a very strong rock album, and should only sustain Nickelback's place in the music industry.  The first single was a monster hit \\"Someday\\", was a hit from the word go, and still remains in the top 40, after 30 some weeks, and making it all the way to #7, that song is just what we are getting used to from Nickelback, \\"Figured You Out\\", the current single, is just an in your face song, and it just rocks, now from what I hear the next single is, and I could be wrong, is \\"Feelin Way Too Damn Good\\", which is a very singleworthy song, but I would go with as the 3rd single, either \\"Throw Yourself Away\\", or \\"Because Of You\\", if I had to choose it would be \\"Throw Yourself Away\\", which I believe is the best song on here, but \\"Someday\\" and \\"Figured You Out\\" come very close.  Nickelback is a band you route for, and this CD, should be proof of why Nickelback is still around and will be around for a while. Among song other favorites are \\"Do This Anymore\\", \\"Another Whole In The Head\\", and \\"Feeling Way Too Damn Good\\".  The album gets a B, because it's a well rounded CD.
B00005JM02|5.0|I am an adult and I loved this movie!  I had to buy the DVD after I borrowed ir from one of my nieces.  The animation and storyline are outstanding.
B00005JMEW|2.0|My opinion of the movie has somewhat mellowed since the last few days after seeing Kill Bill. Still, after mellowing, I find the movie distasteful. The only thing that keeps me from rating this movie even lower is the excellent cinematography and the extremely well done fight scenes (alright, alright, the whole spurting blood thing was funny), and the insanely cool character GoGo. I understand that its a parody of many movies and has got lots of influences, blah blah blah, but all in all, it was a huge corny ball of weirdness. This movie is SO overdramatized, and sometimes the script and the dialogue makes me want to hurle. During most of the movie, it felt like Tarantino was trying REALLY REALLY hard to make a live action movie based on an anime or something. Makes my head hurt just thinking about this movie. But hey, don't let this review stop you from watching this trippy film. If you like watching skinny blond girls who speak bad japanese wave swords around, go ahead.
B00000342V|5.0|This is the one!  It has every thing the other &quot;non-deluxe&quot; version has, plus a second disk of excellent unreleased material.  I think I listen to this &quot;bonus disk&quot; more than the regular soundtrack.  The instrumentals from the movie are, in some ways, better than the stuff on the first disk.  Curtis Mayfield's anti-drug radio spots are interesting too!  (&quot;I know your mind, you want it funky, but you don't have to be no junkie.&quot;)  Do yourself a favor.  Spend the few extra dollars and buy this version.  Otherwise you will be kicking yourself later for not getting the second disk!  The instrumentals and demos are key!
B00005JMJ4|2.0|Lets see........  Where do I start?<br />#1 Scartlett is georgeous.  Being able to look at her face helped me stay awake through this one!  She is also a fine actress.<br />#2 Bill Murry did a good job with a lame plot/dialoge.<br />#3 Excellent camera work.  Some beautiful imagery.<br />That's about it!  This was an over-hyped movie because of the &quot;powers that be&quot; in Hollywood.  If anyone else had written and directed this, it would have gone straight to DVD or never had been made!<br />This movie is supposed to be so &quot;deep&quot; that us simpletons &quot;just don't get it&quot;.  Well, we do &quot;get it&quot;.  The problem is, there is no &quot;IT&quot;.<br />I could make a more interesting movie by just filming a weekend in my hometown of Chicago.  <br />It starts with me being at home having boring conversation with my wife that is too busy to pay attention to me.  I go downtown Chicago and stay in a fancy hotel.  I go golfing with some Japenese guys.  They say things like:  &quot;take a rice rong rook before u take shot&quot;  &quot;ohh you leally lipped that drive&quot;  etc....<br />Then I meet some cute young girl from out of town.  She is bored with her marriage and life too.  We start to hang out.  We drink at the bar, we smoke, and flirt.  Then one night we go out to a nightclub and sing Kareoke,I fall asleep in the cabride home.<BR>When we get back to the hotel, I am awake and she is asleep.  I carry her up to her room and tuck her in.<br />Even though I want her, I sleep with some middle aged bimbo from the bar.  The next morning the young girl comes to my room to invite me to get Sushi.  She hears this other woman.  I regret what I did.  She is let down by my actions.<br />We go to a Sushi restaurant.  We are not happy with the selection, or the &quot;cook yourself&quot; meal.  We can barly hold a conversation over lunch.<br />Back at the hotel (while lying in a hottub)I call my wife, the phone conversation is boring. We have lost our ability to hold a conversation.  My kids are too busy playing to talk to me.  She hangs up on me without saying &quot;I love you&quot;  I try to say it, but she hangs up before I can.<br />The last day I tell the young girl I have to go home.  We have an awkward good-bye because we are in a hotel lobby with many people around.  It is an awkward encounter, just like our entire weekend together.<br />I am driving in my taxi, I see her walking down the street.  I tell the cabbi to stop.  I catch up with her.  I want one last chance to say goodbye.  I Whisper something inaudible into her ear.  Give her a soft kiss on the cheek.  And we both go our own way!<br />If that sounds like a good movie to you, go buy this right away!<br />P.S.  I tossed in a little nudity, some great shots of downtown Chicago and the lakefront.  And I included some cool camera work.
B00000JFV9|4.0|The Deluxe 25th Anniversary Edition has an extra CD of unreleased material.  Unlike most \\"bonus disks,\\" which are pure filler, this one is definitely worthwhile.

B00005V3Z4|5.0|I really like this review that someone else made.  Whats wrong with this person.  &quot;These damn kids smoke their drugs and watch these druggy movies.  Why can't they watch great classics like 2Fast2Ferious or xXx with Vin Diesal or any movie with the Rock in it.&quot;  Go watch something where things blow up since you have the attention span of a goldfish.  <br />Donnie Darko is another time-warp movie. There's some <BR>originality to the plot, but the overall idea is not too original, or particularly coherent. This is another example of a movie made by drug addicts who put their crazed minds on screen, to pollute the American general public. Stupid movie with terrible acting. Avoid. You won't get anything interesting; only to make the drug addict filmmakers and their souless studio executive backers richer so they could buy more illicit drugs.
B000069CWE|4.0|Allright, whether or not you like this album depends upon your tastes. If you thought the previous Linkin Park albums had too much singing and not enough  rap, then you'll probably want to buy this. If you thought vice versa,  you may want to steer clear. If you never listened to Linkin Park before, I don't know what to tell you. Be warned, Linkin Park fans, some of these songs have been remixed heavily, and you may be freaked out once you hear them. Listen long enough though, and you'll begin to develop a likeness for them. Oh, and you should also know that while the album claims to have 20 tracks, four of them are just recorded phone calls with no music. Overall, though, this album truly is an amazing piece of work, and should not be immediately rejected by skepticists.
B0000062GE|5.0|This is a very good CD. When life's BS gets a little overwhelming, I can toss this CD in and feel better almost immediately. The music itself brings me up a couple notches, but thinking things can be so dark and depressing makes me feel that much better.    This is another CD that improved tremendously when I bought my sub...takes the music to another level.
B0000VAFNQ|4.0|This film was beatifully made, and not, as many think, a story of Romeo and Juliet of vampires and werewolves. In fact, it is nothing like that. Kate Beckinsale's acting is amazing and her clothes, I must say, simply gorgeous. Scott Speedman plays his part well, the only debatable part of his character being that he turns into a strange erm... green were-vampire. The special effects are excellent. The storyline is good, though there are parts of the movie which are questionable, judge for yourself. I think that you have to watch the movie yourself and see what you think, but it is a story of immortals that rises to the top alongside Queen Of The Damned.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|Everyone has their own opinion, but as a movie buff who's watched many romantic comedies, this is by far the best. You cannot help but to identify with at least one of the many love stories that happen in this movie... great cast, great feeling, very entertaining, great ending.... the best ever in my book!!
0553573403|5.0|The first volume of George R.R. Martin's \\"A Song of Fire and Ice\\" sets the tone for the series with rich complexity, deep characters, and multiple interwoven storylines forming the roots for a deep and sprawling story.<br />Martin quickly establishes the main and viewpoint characters, which there are many of.  Each is clearly defined and leaves a distinct impression on the mind of the reader, and most of them have changed and developed by the end of this volume.<br />Also defined firmly is the complexity of the world of \\"A Song of Fire and Ice\\".  Martin makes it clear that this world has a full history, and the Fantasy elements--magic, monsters, and strangenesss--are more subdued than many readers may be used to.  The story revolves much more around the \\"Game of Thrones\\", an intense battle of politics and eventually swords between two opposing houses: the honorable Starks (whose ruling family represents most of the protagonists in this book) and the cunning Lannisters.  Despite the intense realism that Martin fosters, Fantasy elements do exist and play an important role in the story.  They're just not as obvious or immediately evident as in most books of this genre.<br />It might be said that the sheer enormity of this work is its only true flaw.  Each viewpoint character has his or her own situation, and the shifts from chapter to chapter are jarring, tending to move you over to the person farthest from the situation you've just been engrossed in.  That said, each chapter will capture you just as well as the last by the time you're a few pages in--but that doesn't make the transition any less jolting.<br />In addition, the novel seems extraordinarily long given the story that it tells.  Martin spends a lot of time beginning threads and establishing every detail that he can, often going off on tangents to cause some change in a character or plant the roots for a later event.  This is at once a virtue and a vice, as it (coupled with the aforementioned viewpoint shifts) makes the pacing a little slow, but further establishes the rich, deep feel of the story.  Even still, it feels like Martin could have told this story with fewer words, especially given the fact that he plans six tomes of this enormous size.  It's enjoyable reading, if overwhelming in the sheer quantity of words that you must read to proceed from one part of the story to the next.<br />But despite the slow pacing and jolting viewpoint shifts, the novel remains interesting throughout.  This more than anything else shows Martin's mastery, and I highly recommend this book to any Fantasy reader willing to brave the thousands of pages of the series.s) makes the pacing a little slow, but further establishes the rich, deep feel of the story.

B000088E6D|5.0|Michael Buble just raised the bar in the world of enjoyable music. Impressive vocal skill with a balanced big band sound.<BR>Refreshingly different.
0790729628|5.0|I first heard of Blade Runner from the Another World CD by Paul Oakenfold that features Vangelis's songs 'Tears in Rain' and 'Rachel's Song,' which are both magnificent. When I saw Blade Runner, I was in awe. It was much better than I could ever had imagined. The storyline was original and addicting, and the characters were one of a kind. Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer) is definitely my favorite character and he brings the whole DVD together, summing up the story with his line &quot;I want more life.&quot; He was able to say things that were meant to be creepy and menacing, but that actually made me laugh, particularly when he yelled &quot;That hurt!&quot; to Deckard, who hit Batty in the head twice with a metal beam. Blade Runner is a definite must-have for people who love sci-fi, unexpected twists in a movie, and villains who are able to make your skin crawl.
B0001IN07Q|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyable movie. <BR>Accompanied by a cd of mostly live songs gives great dollar value. Wish all record companies would go this route......<BR>Buble is refreshing, he seems like a genuinely nice human being who is realizing his dream of making beautiful music. Bravo.<BR>Refreshing to see an artist who takes pride in their work, both in studio and in concert - and the pride shows.
B0001907DA|4.0|The classic series FINALLY arrives on DVD (why did they ever wait so long? Part 1 was released so long ago...) Its a series def not remembered for writing or acting, but for its silly jokes. The DVD set has decent special featurettes (making of vids for each DVD in series) &amp; original trailers. My major complaint is the &quot;mixing&quot; of the box set. Parts 1, 2, 3, 6, &amp; 7 are widescreen, parts 4 &amp; 5 are full frame. WHY??? This is just going to annoy fans of the series (some people like WS, some like FF, but noone is going to be happy with a box set that mixes both).
B0000DD7LC|3.0|I have never been an Alicia Keys fan, (I am more old school), so young talent has to be exceptional for me listen to it much less rate it higher than 3.5 stars, (so 3.5 stars is good from me) however this young lady is definitely on her way to DIVA status!....  One of my co-workers was at a concert recently with Alicia, Beyonce' and Missy Elliott.  She said Alicia stole the show, as did other people I talked to who were there...I like the song &quot;you don't know my name&quot;, but her latest release &quot;If I ain't got you&quot;<br />is my favorite.  A beautifully written song, with a lot of meaning....You could not have asked for a better person to sing it.  The song is so true in every sense of the words, the glitz and the glamour, flowers, jewerly, means nothing without you!! I Love it!... I admire how natural and unpretenious she is, and most of all she adores her Mother.  She gives much credit to her Mom, and I love that about her...<br />There are a few so-called DIVA's who don't even come close to what this young woman has given on stage, and in her music...We all must crawl before we can walk....<br />I look foward to watching this young lady grow into a well-rounded, multi-talented singer/entertainer....If she continues at this rate, she will be forever remembered with other great singers/Divas as Aretha, Chaka, Anita...... as you can see last names are not even necessary.
B0001AVZA8|5.0|This is a great movie.  The cast of Diane Keaton and Jack Nickolson is wonderful.  The movie is funny without being forced.  The laughs come from your relationship with the characters and their experiences.    You are never quite sure what will happen next.  This is a movie that you will watch more than once.
B000002ITW|1.0|I had great memories of the times and LP version of this CD set.<br />I just bought it, to go with a serious stereo.<br />As they said back then, what a bummer.<br />The engineering is terrible. The vocals distort to the point<br />of being unlistenable.<br />And for a group famous for its close harmonies, how come no one can sing in tune?<br />Skip this live CD, find a studio version where they could<br />actually hit the notes, and where the producer<br />could make them cut out the mindless drivel and<br />extended, pointless jams.
B00005OM4N|5.0|Ok first of all we all know britney spears is a singer that has barley any vocal talents...but for some reason her wierd vocals come together and made a GREAT cd! This cd is the only cd where every song is a great song worthy of listneing...unlike her other 3. The songs are GREAT..heres what they are...<BR>1.Im a Slave 4 u- Deff the best song on the cd! perfect beat, great vocals, awesome dance song that any britney fan would LOVE!<BR>2.Overprotected-An AWESOME song. very pop and not as edgey as the first one but an awesoem song.  U can sing to it for hours<BR>3.Lonley- very good song.  Starts out a little slow but will have u hooked in NO TIME! great song<BR>4.Im not a girl, not yet a women- A great ballad song, she shows that she infact does a voice, once u take off the slutty clothes, caked on make up and about 2 lbs of silicon.<BR>5.Boys-A very good song, the remix (not included) was a better version but this is just as hooking and dancable<BR>6.Anticiping- A little annoying with the bubble gum pop but can make u sing it all night<BR>7.I Love rock n' roll- the WORST song on the cd. the vocals are horrible! at first this song makes u think that from song 7 on are gunna be crap but she proves you wrong<BR>8.Cinderella-another great song! great beat! awesome vocals!<BR>9.Let me be-good song, not that big of a deal tho<BR>10.Bombalistic Love- ok song but not good enough to keep on repeat<BR>11.Thats were u take me- another ballad song, its alright but gets old FAST<BR>12.What its like to be me-a good song, fast paced, and nice beat...i think justin timberlake is in it tho...so its kinda sucks!

B0001AP12G|5.0|Kanye West is a great Producer because he produced Jay-z &amp; I find that to be a geat accomplisment because is one of the most famous rappers alive (even know he is sort of retired from rapping). Now Kanye West is great Rapper because he is different,some great songs from him are All Falls Down because it has a good story &amp; Syleena Johnson has a great voice,Through The Wire is a great song because its telling how bad it was for him to have to go through everything he went through &amp; The song Slow Jams is great even know Kanye West Has Such a Short Part it cool to here him rap slow.<br /><br />  PEACE FANS OF KANYE TO THA'
B0000TLA9G|3.0|As many know, the original lineup attempted to stop the release of this collection. This was not an act done out of rebellion, it was done because this collection does not properly represent Guns N' Roses cause. Most of the songs on this album happened to be songs that were released as singles because Geffen forced it. As good as these songs are, putting them all together ruins it because they all sound &quot;too good&quot;, or too much like number 1 hits. Guns N' Roses did not even have 4 REAL albums, so a collection like this was not neccessary. Buying Lies, Illusions 1&amp;2, and Appetite might cost a bit, but you won't regret it. And if you do, you would have regretted buying this album even more.
B0001932ZA|5.0|The Running Man is awesome. Arnold basically gets teamed up with his former buddies and has to survive a sadistic gameshow. He runs into numerous villians and has to let everyone know that he isn't who they think he is.<br />The film is great. The picture looks good and the DTS sound is well-worth the special edition. People are reviewing this movie based off the extras though. Here's my advice, &quot;Always buy the movie for the movie.&quot; You will never be dissapointed if you just buy the movie for the actual movie and forget about the extras. Some movies have really interesting extras, but then again... most don't. This movie is really good and they did all they good for a special edition. 5 stars!!!
B000006TRV|5.0|The biting sarcasm and streamlined music, the emotion poured into every line.  It is exceptionally rare that I have ever heard something so effectively human in nature.  Our inability to save ourselves from our own passions unless we are willing to reflect upon our actions, demonstrated in the Trial.  Most importantly it made me look at myself and change.<br />I thank Roger for the ideas, and Gilmore for his contributions to the music.
B0000CNY5G|5.0|THIS REVIEW IS FOR BRENTWOOD RELEASE. (Brando is hilding gun and facing left) The quality is rather good for a non-anamorphic release. It is on par with any dvd that has not had the any major restoration or anamorphic treatment. Better than video by a long shot (and leaps and bounds better than regular tv broadcast). What more do ya want for so little? Some people are so fixated on the quality that they ruin the film for themslves. It's not a new release nor is it a hugely popular film so the studios did not throw tons of money into the release. Stop yer whinning and watch the !!#$$$% movie. <br />AS FOR THE FILM:<BR>This is the the best western ever! Brando directs  and stars in this great film. Scorsese has stated that this is his favorite western. Terry Gilliam places this film in his 10 favorite films list. Marlon shot over a million feet of film!!!- a world record. He took over the directing position from Stanley Kubrick belive it or not. It is said they were not able to see things eye to eye. As much as I love Kubrick's work I don't think he could have done better.<BR>  This film is so much more than a revenge/love story. Brando performance is outstanding. His complex charactor is as real as any performance on film. His wit, charm and rage are palpable. It deals with his inner turmoil as a man. Something that few films achieve or bother to deal with. The supporting actors are fantastic as well.<BR>  Do yourself a favour and buy this today. At this price it is a no brainer.
B00012L786|5.0|Why does Amazon or Criterion show this 1953 old mainstream film noir movie as having an NC-17 rating, &quot;Not for Sale to Anyone Under 18&quot;???<br />This is a ridiculous error and needs to be corrected. First of all, there was no such film rating system in 1953 and second of all, this film would not be rated NC-17 if there had been such a rating system!!<br />This error should be corrected and soon!
B000099T2L|5.0|Beyonce  debut album is so hot. I can listen to every one of her songs over and over again. She is truly a talented artist and all yall haters need to get off of her. She has sold over 8 million albums worldwide. How many have you all sold? And I'm pretty sure she can care less about what any of you all say about her cause she has already collected her coins. So when yall sale millions of albums then you can talk. Until then Beyonce keep doing your thing your true fans will stick by you.
B0001I55OC|1.0|The book kept me awake far into the night with its attention to historic detail combined with high-tech plausibility. This is something only Michael Crichton could do so well.  Highly recommended.  <br />The movie .....a cure for insomnia. Billy Connolly in a dramatic role? Sad thing is, he's the best in the film.  Horrible acting all around. Cheap sets; cheap thrills.  Nuff said. Waste of time.  <br />Save your bucks - buy the book for 1/3 the price and settle down for hours of enjoyment.
0385336810|3.0|I have to say, I was a bit let down by this book. I am a huge fan of Ms. Kinsella's Shopaholic series, and I couldn't wait to get my hands on a copy of this. I made my husband drive me to a bookstore while were on vacation, so I could get this book the day it came out. I have to admit, if I wasn't an insomniac, I may not have finished it, but it is an easy read, so I was able to polish it off in a couple of nights. Now, for the part about why I didn't like it. This kind of book is not deep, so I wasn't expecting that, however, I was hoping to connect with the character, or even the story, and I didn't do either. Sort of amusing, and I'm sorry to say, sort of boring. Sorry Ms. Kinsella! If you havn't rushed out to buy this, borrow a copy or wait for paper. This book won't stop me trying her next one, but I just didn't think it was up to the Shopoholic books. Next time!
B00005V9IK|2.0|This supercharged War of the Worlds ripoff is worth seeing just for the special effects. It's the only reason to watch it. The acting is cartoonish at best, the plot twists and turns are absolutely ludicrous, the science is so way off it's comical.  But, the really spooky thing about this 1996 movie, is the Empire State building being blown up, and people running through the streets away from the explosion. It presages (unintentionally of course) 9-11 and the Twin Towers.<BR>Watch that scene, and remember the news videos about the Twin Towers. It's unsettling, that a piece of directorial drek like Independence Day, can bring about strong emotional reactions, not because of its inept screenplay, but because it accidentally showed us a vision of a terrible future incident that would Really take place five years in the future.
0385504209|5.0|I'm not a reader of fiction books, but The Da Vinci Code is an exception.  The combination of facts and fiction in this book should keep any reader intrigued.  I read this book at the time of Mel Gibson's &quot;Passion of the Christ&quot; release.  Needless to say, two widely opposing views were presented in Gibson's and Brown's account of Christ's life.  I was a little put off by the constant twists and turns in The Da Vinci Code, but this is characteristic of a murder mystery novel, I suppose.  The ideas in Dan Brown's book can further be explored in &quot;Bloodline of the Holy Grail&quot;, and countless other investigative books and articles written on the subject.
B0000TLA9G|4.0|I think every GN'R fan has been waiting for a compilation, not like Live Era (a Live recorded CD), and this one finally arrived. But making a GN'R compilation may be a really difficult job. They've made so many great songs, this CD can't have all the hits.<BR>I agree with another reviewer, Estranged is missing, but that's not the only one hole: Mr Brownstone, Rocket Queen from &quot;Appetite for Destruction&quot;, Move to the city (Lies), Double Talkin' Jive (UYI I) and Pretty Tied Up, Get in the ring (this one kicked more than an ass!) from UYI II.<BR>I'm sure many fans as I, will buy this CD not to complete a collection, because I'm sure many and many people have all the GN'R albums. It will be to have only one CD with many hits, to be carried in the car or a discman.
B00008NG5V|4.0|I rated Jack Johnson's first album here not long after it came out and said that I was impressed by his ability to execute his songs lyrically and musically while still being original and interesting. When an album like 'brushfire fairytales' comes along and you listen to it, it's a good bet from (other) past experience that the follow-up will fall flat, overwhelmed by studios and producers.<br />Not so.<br />Jack Johnson is the man I would chose to be if I were a musician. He keeps getting it right, seems to be doing it on his own terms and keeps making music that is worth listening to on all levels. The album 'On and On' picks up where the other left off, moving forward with more gentle music that gives a wink and nod at the previous one but then leaves all other similarities behind. The songs are well crafted and well executed, from the happy-go-lucky 'horizon has been defeated' to the more sincere (somber) tones of 'traffic in the sky', this album is worth the listen. The only song that I would ever complain about is the song that I seem to find myself skipping on every listen: Taylor, which seems to be something that the artist shuffled his way through when making. Other than that, tracks like 'Rodeo Clowns' (originally found on a G Love and Special Sauce album, and the song that helped Jack Johnson launch himself- appearing here acousticly) and 'Mediocre Bad Guys' are instantly likeable listening.<br />Bottom Line: Get this one, you'll love it and love yourself for being so nice to your ears.
0156027321|5.0|As a student of many religions (but a person of a single faith), I was fascinated by the character Pi from the start.  This book is a beautifully written, thought provoking book about faith, about survival, about the transition from childhood to adulthood, about the strength of the soul and it's ability to tame (though not completely conquer because that is impossible) the most beastly parts of ourselves, and so many other things. I finished reading this book days ago, and I still find myself thinking about it frequently, finding new meanings in it,etc.
B0000WN0ZK|4.0|At first, I thought it was the worst movie I've ever scene.  But upon second glance, this movie grew on me.  Every time I watch this film, I pick out different aspects about the film.  This is not a typical movie.  There's hardly any dialogue and the music is not abundant.  Too many movies in Hollywood has flash.  This is a thinking person's movie.  It gives the person the chance to figure it out for themselves.
B000000HSU|5.0|great album. there really isn't much to say exept i really like this album. i have quickness, i against i and rock for light is the best.i cant tell you to do anything, but if you like the bad brains buy this.
B00003CXD5|5.0|The heck with the African Queen, this was Humphrey Bogart's finest role.  This role was pure evil, psychologically imbalanced and a tour-de-force.  Bogart should have won the Oscar that year (1948 - Laurence Olivier for Hamlet).  What I liked the most about this film was the fact that there were no subtitles during the Spanish scenes.  You know exactly what was happening and Director John Huston didn't sugar coat it.  This is a great film.
0394818237|3.0|This really is an excellent book, but if your memories are of the complete 96 page edition, you may be dissapointed in this 64 page abridged version. Losing about 1/3 of the excellent stories is a bit sad. Huckle's plane trip for example is not present.<br />What is left is really excellent, but what was cut was great too.
0783225857|5.0|If you want to see great acting, watch this movie.  Gregory Peck's pressence in this film is awe inspiring.  This is his greatest role in one of the best movies ever made.  I honestly think this was one movie that made a difference in changing the course in the Civil Rights of all people at that time.
B00005JMFR|5.0|I usually judge a film on the flow of the story, the sum of all of its parts.  There was admittedly, some melodramatic acting in this film.  I don't know if that could be helped due to the scale of the film itself.  Perhaps the actors felt as if they were emoting Shakespeare for that reason.  What I loved about the film was the fact that the heroics of the characters remained consistent.  You knew that Neo was the Chosen One.  And we all know what happens to the savior of any people: they are sacrificed.(...)  I was not at all surprised by the ending.  I was upset by it, but not surprised.  The whole dynamics of the trilogy was about a war between the remnants of mankind and the machines.  There had to be a winner, and there had to be a loser in this war. I was caught off guard by how the war was resolved.  I was satisfied with the writing.  I was satisfied with the special effects.  Most of all, the film had me cheering for the courageous humans who would not give up.  And as for Neo and Trinity: They will live on in my memory as legendary lovers.  Everyone involved in this film should be extremely proud of it.
6305358567|5.0|Elizabeth is a magnificent work of art.  The casting is perfect and the cinematography is amazing.  However, the movie is just a movie.  Do not look to Kapur's Elizabeth as being an accurate representation of history.  Mary of Guise was not murdered as she was in the movie, and Elizabeth certainly knew of Robert's marriage -- she ATTENDED HIS WEDDING!! But regardless, I give the movie 5 stars because it is so well done and very captivating.<br />If you want a more accurate portrayal of history, read a book or buy the BBC's Elizabeth R.
B00005JMJ4|4.0|\\"Lost In Translation\\" is a pleasant interlude of a film, far removed from the typical blockbuster filled with violence and  and too much action with too little substance. This movie is character driven, with lots of atmosphere - but be warned, the movie is not long on plot. Sofia Coppola wrote and directed this wry, poignant comedy of kindred souls - middle-aged Bob Harris, (Bill Murray), and 25 year-old philosophy graduate Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) - as they wend their way through culture shock on a visit to Japan and commiserate with each other about their troubled marriages and life in general.<br /><br />Bob Harris is an over-the-hill film star relegated to making whiskey commercials in Japan, where he is on a short stint when the movie opens. He apparently loathes himself for the work he is doing. His marriage has grown stale after 25 years and there does not appear to be a remedy for the situation. The telephone interaction between Bob and his wife is cold and distant, their only mutual interest is their children. Charlotte is a recent Yale graduate who majored in philosophy. With no job prospects on the horizon and a relatively short marriage which is going downhill fast, she finds herself very alone and lost. Charlotte is lovely, remarkably bright and totally ignored by her workaholic, famous photographer husband who inhabits a world more shallow than his wife can bear. Bob and Charlotte, unable to sleep, meet late one night in the hotel bar and strike up an unusual metaphysical conversation, of sorts. The two seem to understand and empathize with each other instantly. Palpable chemistry vibrates between them. These vibes would ordinarily be difficult to achieve with such a disparity in ages. However, Director Coppola does not let her characters off easily and go the typical May-December romance route. The couple share tremendous intimacy based on feelings not sex. They interact with unusual warmth, gentleness and a tremendous sense of sadness and yearning.<br />\\"Lost In Translation\\" is also a comedy of cultures - our own western culture and Japan's. Culture clash and shock threaten to overwhelm Bob. The language, food, customs, pace of life alienate him more than he was before his plane landed in Tokyo. Together Bob and Charlotte find normalcy, a connection at a difficult point in time.<br />Murray gives an absolutely fantastic performance. He is so real, so natural as Bob Harris that it seems like he never worked from a script. Ms. Johansson is just perfect with her radiant innocence and wry humor. It is sheer pleasure to watch the two hang-out together. Ms. Coppola captures Tokyo from a foreigner's perspective - as Bob and Charlotte would view and experience the city - with its bright lights, towering skyscrapers, the Eastern take on Western culture, lots of action, movement and clamor.<br />This is a small gem of a movie that left me teary eyed, but not sentimentally so. And the ending is perfect.<br />JANA. <br />\\"Lost In Translation\\" is also a comedy of cultures - our own western culture and Japan's. Culture clash and shock threaten to overwhelm Bob.

B0001BKAEY|2.0|I cannot begin to tell you of my disappointment. This film lacked the substance that the first two had. The dialogue was horrible (bad enough to remind me of Star Wars) and the acting was even worse ... if that's possible. The only positive I found was the special effects, which were again quite incredible. But you cannot make a movie on special effects alone (again see the new Star Wars films) and expect it to be great.<br /><br />And finally, the ending was a huge disappointment. The first two films left me wanting more, while this one simply made me want it to end.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|This film obviously tries to make its point by making the viewer feel the same sense of tedium and muted, lightheaded state that the main characters (Bill Murray, Scarlett Johansson) are feeling amidst the lights, tall buildings, lonely bars and crowded walkways of Japan; they're foreigners who haven't learned the Japanese language. But the question is, do you want to watch this? If you're a hopeless romantic, you may find treasure in the subtleties and rather monotone projection of this film, which never picks up -- and that seems to be the filmmaker's point. But even understanding the intent, doesn't make for an entertaining viewing. I tried to give it a chance, but ultimately, it makes for slow, tedious viewing and makes one wonder why it was nominated for any Oscars at all, nevermind winning one. (perhaps the Coppola name had something to do with it?) There are those moviegoers and critics who defend a film against critics saying naysayers don't understand the intended style (but that type of defense could be used to justify any movie, from Ed Wood films to the Ernest series). Onto another point, this movie commits the same faults many Hollywood movies do when it selects a &quot;foreign&quot; country as its locale -- it marginalizes the &quot;minority&quot; characters, making them all one-dimensional caricatures, while the usually white characters go trotting about as if the world is their oyster. The movie plays for cheap laughs on how Japanese people try to speak English -- but they shouldn't be speaking English at all -- it's the main characters who should be trying to speak Japanese, and not act like the stereotypical &quot;dirty, arrogant Americans.&quot; There are at least a couple scenes in which Murray makes fun of Japanese people for not understanding English. Such scenes show the arrogance of many Americans, to think that others should cater to them, and bend to their culture. Hollywood constantly errs by taking what should be &quot;minority&quot; stories, and forcing white characters into the spotlight and shoving minorities to the sidelines, the background. (movies such as &quot;Last Samurai&quot; and &quot;Snow Falling on Cedars&quot; would have been much more interesting if they took the more interesting characters (the Japanese ones) and had them live, breathe, on their own without always being seen from the pov of the white character). But, as long as viewers keep on giving their money to such films, the mind-numbing trend won't end. And &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; is definitely mind-numbing.
B00012FXB8|4.0|\\"What are we doing?\\"<br />\\"improvising!\\"<br />The above exchange occurs between Sigourney Weaver's \\"Ripley\\" and Charles S. Dutton's \\"Dillon\\" during the concluding minutes of the film.  It best describes a movie that was plagued from the beginning with script re-writes, budget constraints, executive interference, and last but not least, a change of directors.  First-time helmsman David Fincher had the undaunted task of pulling off what seemed as project doomed from the start.<br />He and his crew had to really \\"improvise.\\"<br />This fascinating two-disc set provides insight into the movie and its many problems.  It would be to the viewer's advantage to watch the second disc first as it really offers a journey into the production of a motion picture.  The commentary by the cast and crew is unbelievably honest as both discuss the ups and downs of project.<br />One of the highlights is screenwriter Vincent Ward's original premise for the film.  Had the story been used, the film would've had a different tone and, perhaps, been a better critical success.<br />However, the real \\"find\\" is the special edition, featuring an additional (and much needed) thirty minutes.  The extra half hour provides more character and plot development that improves the film tremendously.  Even the modified \\"ending\\" is more poetic that the theatrical's version.<br />While the film doesn't quite have the terror of the first or the action quota of the second, it is still a worthy installment in the franchise.<br />For fans of the film or those interested in filmmaking, this is an essential purchase.<br />Rating for the film: 3.5<br />Rating for the supplemental disc: 4.5<br />Total: 4

Maybe you'll remember what it was like to cycle so fast that your feet lose contact with the pedals...the determination and camaraderie of building a clubhouse, the friendship and love that can overwhelm you when you least expect it to and the fear...fear of the unknown...and fear of the known.<br />A chilling yet absorbing novel that takes time to aquaint you with the characters and their experiences, so that you really care what happens to them - good AND bad!
B00005JMX4|3.0|It's rare that I would go to see a \\"teen comedy,\\" and the completely ridiculous plot devices in this one reminded me why, but for a Hollywood movie it's surprisingly unhypocritical about sex.  The movie had the chance to attack our culture's \\"virgin(...)\\" hypocrisy head-on (the fact that men buy porn, jack off to porn, but disrespect anyone who makes it.) Well, it wasn't quite that brave, but it did at least obliquely raise the issue by making Danielle a smart, cool chick who just happened to make porn and has to deal with other people's hypocritical judgements about it.  The stars are sweet, hot and have good chemistry, and they live in an alternate reality where a sex-ed video that talks about foreplay wouldn't immediately be shot down by the Christian Right.
B000000OAH|4.0|By the time Queen got to Jazz, they'd already broken all the boundaries and proven they could do anything.  So on Jazz they appear content to just write and perform songs for enjoyment without feeling the need to push a million different musical limits.<BR> <BR>There are still some cool studio effects, though nothing overshadowing &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;.  There are still different musical styles, but not the drastic differences we saw on Sheer Heart Attack, A Night At The Opera, and A Day At The Races.<BR> <BR>So if you're looking for Queen's truly groundbreaking work, try the previously mentioned three albums for a taste of their musical variety, or their epic Queen II album (less variety in musical styles, but many Queen fans' favorite album).  Previous albums were more cohesive works of art, while Jazz seems to be simply a collection of songs.  But it retains Queen's musical skill and knack for a good melody.
B0001IN07Q|1.0|I will never deny Michaels talent, it's always incredible.  Now I'd like to see it be new.  What is the point of releasing a CD/DVD set that has so little original material?  Granted the DVD material hasn't been released before, but of the eight (not enough for an album) songs on the disk, only 5 are items not yet released through his current label.  A note to all artists and record companies.  Why go out and buy a CD/DVD compilation when there are only 5 songs that you would like to hear?  What we needed was a live concert DVD (full length), and a new material CD (at east 13 songs would have been nice).  I am just not willing to pay for the same things over and over no matter how talented the artist is.  I consider this album/DVD combo a shame.  Mike can offer so much more.

B0001BKAEY|1.0|I was really looking forward to the movie. It turned into nothing, but trash. It didn't answer any of the questions raised in the previous movies. The main characters are non-existant. Neo is powerless. So, unlike the first two movies.     The Matrix could've been a Truly Great Series. But, the ending falls flat on it's face. To me, it was very depressing.
0385510438|4.0|I actually managed to read \\"The Last Juror\\" without knowing anything more than it was the \\"new\\" John Grisham novel.  From the title I assumed that it was about a trial and about a juror for that matter, in a similar vein to \\"The Runaway Jury,\\" but that is not really the case even though the cove photograph certain reinforces the idea.  There is a juror and there is a trial, but there are parts of a larger tapestry told by the book's narrator.<br />This narrator, who is not the titular figure, was born Joyner William Traynor but becomes known as Willie when he ends up working on a small newspaper in Clanton, Mississippi.  Actually he ends up doing more than that, becoming the owner of the \\"Times\\" through a couple of simple twists of fate, although he never really graduated with a journalism degree from that \\"Ivy League\\" school Syracuse.  Will, as he called himself, had his Triumph Spitfire and his long hair, but not much else going for him.  However, this person Willie becomes rather interesting as he tries to build up the circulation of his little newspaper in Ford County.  After all, even if he hails from Memphis he is still considered a Yankee by the people of Mississippi.<br />Along the ways he makes a friend of Miss Callie Ruffin, an elderly black woman who has eight children, the first seven of which have earned doctorates; we will learn about why the youngest child does not have his Ph.D. yet in the course of this tale.  However, everything changes when the most sensational murder case anybody in Ford County can remember happens.  Willie knows this is his big chance to boost circulation for his newspaper.  However, this means crossing the family that has been running Ford County behind the scenes for over a hundred years.<br />Grisham makes the point several times that Mississippi is behind the times more than any other state in the Union and his Author's Note at the end acknowledges that he has mistreated some of the bad and weak laws that existed in the state in the 1970s, the decade in which this story was set.  But \\"The Last Juror\\" really is about changing times, even if the changes come too late in the estimation of some.  What Willie does to not only make Clanton a better place but to become a part of his adopted town is a recurring theme, even if it never seems to be the driving narrative of the novel.<br />The only real step in the story is when things start happening towards the end of the book and everybody in town assumes they know who is behind, whereas everybody that I know who has read the book (okay, that is just two other people, but all of us agreed) jumped to the right conclusion.  Not in terms of who, mind you, but in terms of what was really happening.  You would think some of the characters in the town of Clanton would have at least had an idle thought in this direction, but Grisham is being so blatant in ignoring the obvious alternative explanation that it is impossible not to guess what is really going on.<br />\\"The Last Juror\\" is set in the Deep South and has the rhythm of a story told on the front porch.  Like many such stories it is about much more than what it is supposed to be about, so those who are compelled to find linear narratives in the novels they read are going to be frustrated, but hopefully not disappointed by Grisham's tale.  You may not come to a final conclusion about what this novel is really about until you have read the final page, but there is really nothing wrong with that, even if it swims against the tide of contemporary best selling fiction.  This is not a great novel or even a great Grisham novel, but it is a solid yarn, his best in years, and at this point in his career that may well be as good as it gets.ate in the 1970s, the decade in which this story was set.

006441034X|5.0|Hold on a second while I tie my gaping-in-awe-and-amazement mouth shut.  Howl's Moving Castle is by far the best book I have read of Diana Wynne Jones.  Though it may lack the depth of books such as Dark Lord of Derkholm or the intricasies of plot as Hexwood, this book is an absolute blast to read.  This book that so obviously ridicules fairy tales had me in stitches.  Sophie's stubbornness and Howl's mockery of Prince Charming among other things made me love them.  And who could forget such a notorious character as Calcifur who reminds me of a pouty child but endears himself to you nonetheless.  Incredibly surprising and absurdly wonderful, I will love this book forever.
B0001BKAEY|5.0|Once in a generation, there is a movie created by its production crew -- from the director downward -- that is revered so highly that there is an unprecedented focus on style, creativity, detail, tone, direction, cinematography, and cast.  The Matrix Triology surpasses every previous benchmark in movie making history.<br />Matrix Revolutions begins where Matrix Reloaded ended.  I could not help but think that there are similarities between this movie and our current war against terror.  The movie clearly shows that waiting for an attack by the enemy machines is the wrong approach.  Once the enemy is on your own territory, defense systems may not be able to withstand a persistant and overwhelming attack.  Neo, however, chooses to adopt a more aggressive strategy:  he goes onto enemy territory, the machines, and confronts them.  Perhaps one of the best parts of this movie is that one can analyze and philosophize about what the movie means and how it relates to other things that we are either in other pieces of literature or in the news.  That is why when the production crew said this movie actually does cover every part of life that can conceivable be covered, they probably did not know how right they were.<br />The movie covers martial arts, fourth-dimensions, the philosophy of allowing machines to develop artificial intelligence, religion, and beautiful renditions of humans enganged in action.  There will probably never be a movie quite like this again.  But I can hope.<br />Michael Gordon
B00005JMX4|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised by the way this movie was so cleverly put together.  I went in with no real expectations and walked out really liking this movie.  And it wasn't just me because it got a hearty applause at the end.  Not something you see very often coming from an adolecent flick like this.  It won't win any awards, but for it's shear entertainment factor I thought it was great!
B0001BKAEY|1.0|\\"My cat knows Neo. Do you know?\\" \\"I, uh, know...\\" \\"I know you know\\" AHHHHHHHHH! The torture of listening to a Matrix stream of thought is like reading a bad copy of Naked Lunch while jamming a fork in your eye. With the hope that Reloaded could possibly carry on what I say is one of the top ten Sci-Fi movies of all time was maybe a false hope, but the highway scene is fantastic, so I would give Reloaded 3 out 5, for mercies sake. But Revolutions gave me the same sensation as being sodomized by a drag queen: you don't know what to expect, but you know it won't be good. From the three million permutations on \\"I don't believe in him, but you do, and I believe in you\\" to the potentially interesting and exciting Trinity/Oracle-minus-eyes face off that ended in such a, I wouldn't say predictable, because that would be giving it credit, more of a forementioned drag queen feeling. The thought that a suprise may come out of this coma of a movie was too much to hope for. The 40 minute battle between the machines and humans in Zion had great Paris-during-WWI potential, with the out numbered and over gunned humans finally pulling out a victory through sheer force of will, but instead we get two uber-dykes running around with a rocket launcher and some how winning the whole freakin battle for the humans! And the fights seemed to happen just for the sake of meeting some sort of fight quota: each fight seemed to just be spliced together from the superior original and Reloaded and put in a blender with Nobuo Uematsu and cow poo for good measure to come out with the vomit that we see in Revolutions. Possibly one of the most hard core characters in Sci-fi history, Morpheus, is relegated to secondary supporting character status, with, get this, his girlfriend having more lines that he does. The final battle between Neo and Smith, again with high expectations, was just...miserable. A live action Dragonball Z fight would be the best way to describe it: Neo has long bouts of shaking andlooking scared as Smith smiles sardonically and evilly. AND THEIR FLYING!! WHAT THE HELL!!! Characters in live action movies do not fly unless they are A) Superman or B) getting blown to bits. The fact that it took Neo 15 freakin minutes to decipher the cryptic innuendo from the suprisingly cool body swapped Smith was just another reason to douse yourself in kerosene and get the whole thing over with. I'm glad that brick dumb Trinity finally gets what she deserves, but the Neo being Jesus thing was a little much for my bland gentile taste. And finally what was the idea behind the humans and machines wanting to live in harmony? I seems that Larry and Andy just got drunk one morning and wrote the piss poor ending to and even piss poorer movie. I highly do not recomend this movie. Eat your dog and sell your children instead, it will be more satisfying.

B00006FMAW|1.0|This is on the top of my list of THE WORST movies of all time!!!  It is so disgusting, weird, and pointless that I don't understand how it can even exist!  Don't get me wrong, I fully enjoy and appreciate horror movies--I've lost count of how many I've seen and I'm not too picky--even rather terrible horror films I've seen (such as \\"R.S.V.P.\\", \\"Real Killers,\\" or \\"Slashers\\") are infinitely better than this schlock.  The movie is sort of \\"normal\\" at first, your typical bad horror movie cliche with poor acting and no plot, but then the main character discovers incest within his family which escalates somehow to a town-wide conspiracy/cult/group (which only he and a friend have managed to avoid) who all get together to... I don't even know what--have sex while eating each other?! or... something. Please do yourself a favor and DO NOT waste an hour and a half of your life watching this piece of trash!!!

038572179X|5.0|Reading Atonement is a luxury I promised myself when it was first released.  I purposely procrastinated and did not intend to review it.  After all, what can any reviewer of humble origin say about an international best seller that received rave reviews from every major review source in the world? Any possible superlative has already been applied.<br /><br />We meet Briony Tallis when she is an imaginative 13 year old in 1935.  Her thought processes are frenetic; she's a secretive adolescent with &quot;a strange mind and a facility with words.&quot;  Her inexperience visits a horrible injustice on Robbie Turner, decent and gifted son of a Tallis family servant.  Robbie has grown up with the Tallis children.  Despite his lower class standing, he falls in love with the elder daughter Cecilia.  That affection is mutual, until Briony mixes in.  She tells an awful lie about Robbie that has heart sickening results, then spends the rest of her life trying to atone.<br /><br />McEwan captures perfectly a time and place, and the class distinctions that set his characters apart.  The Tallis clan is wealthy, impatient, bored, restless.  Robbie Turner is intelligent, loyal and confident, with focused plans for a grand future that fails because of Briony's cunning lie.<br /><br />Atonement is a beautifully written but grim story of injustice.  It speaks to wrongs that can never be reversed down through the generations, and portrays a slice of life that is not always sweet or palatable.  Briony atones for her self serving lie, but was it enough?<br /><br />Atonement is written in the late 19th and early 20th century style.  McEwan's vocabulary is expansive, his prose wonderfully crafted.  Readers of literary fiction will appreciate his work.
B0000AR8NK|5.0|Dear Bowie fans... if you enthralled in Bowie's great comeback of 2002, `Heathen', you will probably not be disappointed by the much anticipated follow-up, `Reality'. The Bowie who delivers `Reality' is as sharp and energetic as he ever was, and creates some of the best songs he made in years, as good as, I'll say it, perhaps better than the ones on `Heathen'. Bowie is surrounded by a tight group of first-rate musicians, most of whom played with him in his finest years - bass player Toni Visconti, who produced Bowie's classic Berlin trilogy as well as classic albums `Diamond Dogs', `Scary Monsters' and `Young Americans', and returned on `Heathen', is again in the production team, helping create the sound that characterized `Heathen', that sounds both classy and very modern. Also on board are the terrific funk guitarist Earl Slick, who played on `Station To Station' and on the `Diamond Dogs' tour of '74; the fierce and talented drummer Sterling Campbell, who played on the `Outside' and `Hours...' albums; and keyboard man Mike Garson, remembered for his remarkable work on `Aladdin Sane'. Together they make wonderful music which is very tight and precise in its arrangements and delivery, but also original, modern and creative.<br />`New Killer Star' opens the album on a strong note, with a lot of electronic experimentation and a strong, fierce beat. `New Killer Star' is the album's leading single, and for good reasons; it's probably the tightest and catchiest song on the album, and with more radio potential than any other. It's not, by any means, the best one. Still, it's a fantastic pop-rock song that sends Bowie straight into the 21st century.<br />`Pablo Picasso' is the first of two tribute tracks on `Reality', and a strange choice for a cover recording at that. It was written by Jonathan Richman, and was originally released on the Modern Lovers' classic debut album in 1976. The choice is strange for more than one reason: first of all, Richman is a child of the glamgeneration, and quite clearly Bowie was one of his biggest influences (in addition to the Velvet Underground, and perhaps Iggy Pop). Also, `Pablo Picasso', like much of Richman's earlier work, is usually considered quite dated in its sound and composition. Still, Bowie's rendition of the classic modernizes it without disrespect for Richman's original vision, and makes for one of the album's finest, if weirdest, moments.<br />The album resumes rocking with `Never Get Old', a funky piece which is a perfect showcase for Earl Slick's groovy guitar. It's a very powerful song with terrific lyrics, on which Bowie, like many other musicians of his age, deals with the anxiety and fears of aging. Whether or not we acknowledge the dark and sarcastic lyrics, `Never Get Old' is a great piece of funk rock and one of the best songs on the album.<br />`The Loneliest Guy' completely changes the pace, into a very haunting slow ballad. Some great keyboard work can be found on this very sad song, as well as a terrific vocal performance by Bowie. `The Loneliest Guy' is the slowest and most difficult track on `Reality', but also one of the more beautiful ones.<br />`Looking for Water' is another standout track with a terrific arrangement and top-notch instrumental performances. Earl Slick and Sterling Campbell both shine fantastically in this haunting and anxious song.<br />Unfortunately, most of the best songs on `Reality' are in the beginning of the album, and after `Looking for Water' the level goes down a notch. `She'll Drive the Big Car' is nevertheless a fine song, as its title may hint, a fast paced and energetic song with a great beat and some nice instrumental and vocal arrangements. `She'll Drive the Big Car' is classic Bowie, and is a treat for fans, but not very good for more than a couple of listens.<br />Following `Days', by far my least favorite track on the album, one which I have little to say, is `Fall Dog Bombs The Moon', which is another very 70s sounding classic Bowie song. It has some great guitar work by Earl Slick and a good arrangement, by neither the melody nor the lyrics stand out. A worthy Bowie track, still.<br />`Try Some, Buy Some' is the second cover track on the album, and once again, an odd choice. It's a track originally composed and recorded by the late, great George Harrison, and released under the 1973 album `Living In The Materiel World' (according to teenagewildlife.com, it was also recorded by Ronnie Spector, but I'm not familiar with his version). If it was meant as a tribute to the absent genius who wrote the song, it's odder still, because `Try Some, Buy Some' is a very little known Harrison track, off a very unsuccessful album. There doesn't seem to be much point to its addition, and Bowie's version doesn't add much to the original, but it's still a good song.<br />The album is back on track with `Reality', the title song, another standout, a heavy and fast song with great guitar riffs and a fantastic vocal performance. It sums up the album quite nicely, and paves the way for `Reality's biggest achievement -<br />`Bring Me the Disco King' is, doubtlessly, the finest track on `Reality', and one to be remembered as a Bowie classic. With a jazzy, elegant drum and piano groove (Mike Garson's piano work here reminds me of his terrific and memorable work on `Time') and haunting, mystical lyrics and a terrific vocal performance, `Bring Me the Disco King' is the kind of song that stays with you long after it's finished, and is therefore a perfect ending for the album. In the end, I believe that a correct structure plays an important part in the impression an album makes on the listener, and by bracketing this CD with `New Killer Star' and `Bring Me the Disco King', Bowie and Visconti have done a fantastic job. Despite some flaws, this is still all around a perfect, smooth, and tight Bowie album, like he haven't made in years, and an essential listen for fans.
B0000AQS0F|4.0|i'm a Joss Whedon fan. and very disappointed with this series when it aired on Fox.  i debated about getting this DVD set for months, and then finally took the plunge.  I could not be happier.  I don't know what Fox was thinking, but like &quot;Buffy&quot; &amp; &quot;Angel&quot; this series must be seen in the order that it was originally intended.  I recommend anyone who enjoys witty dialogue, great visuals, and subtle acting (all Whedon trade marks) to pick this set up.<br />happy viewing.
B00008LDPU|4.0|A collection of nine short animated features set in the world of the Matrix films.  They provide some backstory and texture to the trilogy, although most of the stories are completely separate from the action of the films.  The animation is uniformly excellent, making it a pleasure to watch on that level alone.  Many of the stories lack much in the way of substance, but because they are short and the animation is so good, I was not disturbed.  <br />\\"The Final Flight of the Osiris,\\" which serves a direct prelude to the action of \\"Reloaded,\\" is a highlight.  There is nothing to the story-a session in the training simulator, followed by the discovery of the drilling machines beginning their journey to Zion and then a lot of fleeing and fighting.  The computer animation, however, is absolutely stunning, so photo-realistic that there were a few moments when I wondered if they were mixing live action and animation.  \\"World Record\\" raises the intriguing possibility that a pushing oneself to the limits of endurance could trigger a spontaneous awakening from stasis.  \\"Beyond\\" presents a surreal glitch in the Matrix.  \\"The Second Renaissance,\\" which tells the story of how machines ascended and the Matrix came to be made, features some powerful and disturbing visuals, but seems very implausible.<br />The films do not work together to become more than the sum of their parts, but they remain very entertaining nevertheless.
B00005JKC3|3.0|I respect director Ang Lee a lot and looked forward to see what he would do with &quot;Incredible Hulk&quot;. Unfortunately, the movie was quite disappointing. First of all, it's too long - there is no just enough action for so much time. And all other potential movie qualities notwithstanding THIS movie is about action. The editing, although could be considered unusual and avangard by some people, reminded me cheap TV movies (this does not relate to special effects though which were quite good). I am not saying that it's a bad movie but I did want to fastforward it a few times. It's really too bad. Acting was good but Nick Nolte is exceptional.
B000005IS1|5.0|As I tell any friend who will listen to me, this album is hands down (along with the Allman's Fillmore and Who's Live at Leeds) one of the greatest live albums ever recorded.  The energy of this band is astounding for the year it came out--remember, the airwaves were dominated by the Beatles and Stones and Dylan.  No one could have possibly been prepared for the one-two punch of the crunching Rambling &quot;Rose/Kick Out The Jams&quot; (complete with notorious motherf**ker intro).  And you aren't let off the sonic ride so easily either; next is the decadent, but no less frenzied &quot;Come Together&quot;---in the darkness!  &quot;Rocket Reducer No. 62&quot; and &quot;Borderline&quot; continue the pace--the solo for Rocket is particularly . . . well, sonic.  &quot;Motor City Burning&quot; is the band's most political song, but don't listen to it for its timepiece value--listen to it for that devastating twin guitar attack of Fred Sonic Smith and Wayne Kramer; those dual solos at the same time send a shiver down my spine every time!  &quot;I Want You Right Now&quot; is a slow, incendiary LOUD song--it should have been the closer for this album.  &quot;Starship&quot; is the real closer and what a closer it is!  You can only imagine what the light show (if there ever was any) must've been like while they were blasting through this.  Their choice of a Sun Ra cover is remarkable, because it reveals a musical diversity you don't exactly glean from a first listening of this album.  Sun Ra was another true pioneer of his field; he was a jazz musician who would soberly look you in the eye and claim he was from Saturn.  His music is also 'out there'; it's no wonder that the MC5 saw in him a kindred spirit.  The only two problems a first-time listener will have will be with Rob Tyner's vocals, which are more like howls; he doesn't have an attractive voice and it takes some getting used to.  Also, &quot;Starship&quot; takes some patience to get through on the first and second listenings--a true freakout in every sense of the word.  If you want to know what the MC5 became after they broke up, listen to any punk band of the 70's and early 80's.  Listen to Iggy and the Stooges if you want a contemporary with the same flavor.  Listen to Patti Smith's first three albums.  Above all however, listen to the source, these guys---and play it loud!
B000000W5L|5.0|This is a great Stones album and one of the best albums of all time. This is the ultimate blues rock. It's one of the best Stones albums along with Let It Bleed and Sticky Fingers.
B00005JLSC|5.0|This is without a doubt the best movie I have seen all year.  In fact, it is the best movie ever! Renee Zellweger shows off a hidden talent as Roxie Hart as well as Queen Latifah as Mama Morton.  Richard Gere perfectly plays the \\"greasy-mick lawyer\\" as Billy Flynn.  But, shining above the rest in this film is Catherine Zeta-Jones who plays Velma Kelly.  This role couldn't be better for her and she does an amazing job with her dancing (the best examples would be \\"All That Jazz,\\" and \\"I Can't Do It Alone.)  John C. Reilly also gives a perfect performence as the very confused and \\"see-through\\" Mr. Cellophane, Amos Hart.  Directed by Rob Marshall, \\"Chicago\\" \\"razzle dazzles\\" audiences with its cleverness and fantastic musical numbers.   It is definatley the best buy at the box office and Blockbuster.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Thirteeth step, is the state in which they've spirtiually grown or evolved, which is the album as a whole. As the for the individual songs, are the twelve steps, being in the process of healing that lead to the manyard's plain climbing the plateau or the thirteeth step. I think the whole album is pretty much about Manyard falling in love. And in the process of loving another person, love has the power to heal. <BR>Step 1 being song #1 is the package that starts off with manyard being his usual sick self. He goes to feed the monster, what he craves, lust. He lies and all that to have sex but desires no sort of relationship. <BR>Step 2 Manyard's outlet for his lust turns out to be more then a tool for sex but something more in song #2 weak and powerless. He has an unhealthy realationship that is hurting him more then its benifiting him. Still, suffering is neccisary for a person to grow, for ex. Jesus who was crucified. If a person dose not suffer but imitates a saint, then the spirtual state that person is in is not authentic. <BR>Step 3 Song #4 The noose, being the halo that slips down and becomes a noose. About an opinion or judgment he makes on another person, possibly about himself. An angel that is in actuallity profane and dose not know it until manyard pulls the person or himself down to reaveal the true self. A person cannot heal if they believe there is nothing wrong with that person.<BR>Step 4 Blue is the aura that metaphores the beautiy he sees in the girl hes in love with.<BR>Step5 Vanishing, killing yourself in order to be reborn as we do many times in our lives. From the sperm to the born baby. From dependence to independence. Killing the sick self in order to be reborn into a more healthy person. I don know, its a really soothing song tho.<BR>Step 6 I guess denial about this girl that hes fallen for. The struggles and stuff in a relationship.<BR>Step 7 Song #7, The whole song is about the stupidity of suicide. Its dark but still positive being that hedose not agree with suicide being the answer.<BR>Step 8 Crimes, him accending from step one to ten and being stuck for a while at step 9 and 10.<BR>Step 9 Being in love. The girl that is healing him. The nurse with a small cup and pill. The girl with pharmacy keys. <BR>Step 10 Possessing the girl into another unhealthy relationship. I guess his jealousy has taken over that drove him to have her all to himself. <BR>Step 11 I think its a filler, because you need tweleve songs to get to the thirteeth step. Weird but sort of clever when at the end of pet, it goes, go back to sleep and continues with go back to sleep in lullaby and plays a weird sounding lullaby.<BR>Step 12 The final step before growth. To surrender to God or the gravity and the unknown. People can choose to surrender or choose to sin against Him and move away from him. Manyard chose to surrender to the good. I thought this cuz in their lyrics, there are lots of relious themes.<BR>This is mainly a healing album and the twelve steps in my point of view. Anyway, this album to sturr up this sort of thinking would prove that this is truly a deep, intellectual, beautiful album. And i keep saying album cuz its not worth just getting the singles. This album all ties into each other creating a whole which is now dieing being that everyone's downloading and burning mixed cds and stuff. This is like the height of what rock is now or somewere up there.
B00005T7HX|5.0|Glenn Holland[Richard Dreyfuss] is a man who has a dream of becoming a classical music composer. But it turns out that he teaches a high school music class. He first thinks that he shouldn't be teaching this class and he should be composing music. The story tells how he goes through his life helping his students, his wife and his deaf son Cole. After teaching for 30 years, he then discovers that teaching was really the correct job for him to do. He also discovers that he loved teaching for all those years even though that wasn't his first decision.<br />  I thought that Richard Dreyfus did a great job. I thought that the movie was very well done and I thought that the story was very heartwarming. I also think that if you loved the movie, the soundtrack might also be worth getting. I own the soundtrack and some of the songs I really like.<br />  Director Steven Herek has made a movie with a story that I will never forget.
B000000H5J|5.0|I think I can sum up this album in one word:<br />Amazing.<br />No, really.<br />Rarely do I hear an album that reached right out and hit me like this one did when I first bought/heard it. Now, before I did, I already knew &quot;Zero Signal&quot; because I had it on a mix, and I could have already vouched for what an incredible song that is. But this whole album is just... wow. I can think of some more words to describe this album:<br />HEAVY AS HELL, fast, angry, powerful, ethereal, futuristic, ahead of its time, catchy, haunting, etc.<br />Take for instance, the first song, the title track: &quot;Demanufacture&quot;. Starts off with a fairly heavy riff (courtesy of Dino Cazares, one of the most underrated guitarists of our time), accompanied by lead singer Burton C. Bell singing. Not too threatening, right? Wrong. For the chorus, it kicks into overdrive, and you're blasted by heavy-as-all-hell guitars and Burton yelling his lungs out. And it only gets harder from there. It's my favorite song on the album, and it's a good indicator of the rest of the album to come. &quot;Self Bias Resistor&quot; gives you a nice kick in the [edit], but has a melodic chorus to die for. &quot;Zero Signal&quot;... masterpiece. 'Nuff said. All of the other tracks rule as well, but the curveball in the album, &quot;Dog Day Sunrise&quot;, is actually really impressive. It actually features no yelling, just singing. But it remains fairly heavy. Many don't like it, but I love it.<br />The musicianship here is tight as all hell. As I said, Dino is underrated as an axeman. Just because he plays a downtuned 7-string Ibanez and doesn't solo, people write him off as talentless. Untrue. Check out the heaviness and speed of his playing. And Raymond Herrera (drums)... he's a robot. That's the only explanation I can come up with. Check out the double kick drums... it actually feels like a factory (hence the name, &quot;Fear Factory&quot;). Christian Olde Wolbers is also a good bassist.<br />Anyway,all I can say is, this is industrial metal at its finest (and possibly heaviest). I can't put the feeling of adrenaline I get when listening to it. Buy the album and hear for yourself.<br />I recommend it to:<BR>Fear Factory Fans<BR>Metal Fans (I don't care what kind of metal)<BR>Anyone who wants to listen to something that is truly heavy<br />&quot;We are the new breed, we are the future...&quot;
B000068802|5.0|This CD combines Good Charlotte, Blink 182, and mony other groups of this genre.  There are no bad songs on this CD.  No, wait, 'My Alien' is nothing to shout about.  But, these guys rock.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Regardless of your political viewpoint, World War II is considered the last just war. We went into that war because we had to, had we stuck to our isolationist policy, Britain would have fallen and Hitler would be coming for America next. When Hitler came to power, he was not considered a threat, he was little more than a poor author and political idealist who had dropped out of art school. He was not elected, per se, so no one thought that he'd be able to push his political agenda to the point where war was unavoidable. Anyone who says otherwise is trying to get you to buy their book on the subject.<br />Hanks and Spielberg went to great lengths to ensure that the series was done accurately. The script was sent out to both Ambrose and the remaining men of Easy company, the actors spent time with the men they played to make sure they knew the type of person they were portraying. The transition is practically flawless, and no matter what your view on the war, it was a true accomplishment in filmmaking.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Why this series was cancelled after 14 great episodes I do not understand. It is an intelligent series with appeal to all age groups. There has been plenty of reviews already but let me just add my voice to what a great series this is. The acting is good. The dialog is strong (and funny). The characters are interesting. The story is entertaining. The episodes do vary a bit in their quality, but overall the first season of this show comes out shooting.
0767903862|5.0|I have started buying Bryson's books because I enjoy is conversational style.  Not heavy on details, just wit and wisdom with a few thought provoking moments thrown in.<br />An entertaining read - would be a GREAT beach book if you, like me, take along a book to pass the idle relaxation times.
B00000JLWW|5.0|Titanic is a great movie with wonderful actors and actresses. It is the highest grossing movie ever, with the highest groosing soundtrack of all time! Due to Celine Dion's &quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot;. Kate Winslet is just stunning as her role as Rose. Katy Bates and Billy Zane are awsome also! Highly reccommended, alothough I doubt you havent seen this movie yet! 10 stars!!!
B0001HAHXW|5.0|This is a real good blues CD. I've bought a lot of his earlier work and this by far is one of my favorites. I just recently &quot;discovered&quot; EC and was born in '87 so I haven't heard all of his early work, but of what I've heard, this CD is on top. This is the type of CD where you don't have to skip any of the tracks, they're all good! It's also real cool how he lets the other musicians do more solos than he does on some songs,that shows a lot about him and his view on music, he doesn't always have to be the center of attention. Anyways don't take my word for it, i never really liked critics, I'm just doing this because I'm bored.
B00005K3OT|1.0|All the women I know -many far more bright than I am- liked this movie. (I suspect a rather different attitude to food and the &quot;witch complex&quot; might have something to do with it).<BR>I happen to believe that &quot;magical realism&quot; has devolved to a nearly protoplasmic state since Borges: so I liked the movie too, as it reaffirmed my belief.<BR>People have mentioned several movies that did the same, but better: dare I add to the (long) list, and suggest &quot;Breaking the Waves&quot; (a good example of how &quot;arty chick flicks&quot; actually can have guts sometimes) or Kubrics &quot;Clockwork Orange&quot; (as it shows the consequences of &quot;Chocolat&quot;s attempt at philosophy)?.<BR>Or maybe there just wasnt enough topless scenes. What do I know...
B00013F35I|5.0|My husband received this DVD for Christmas and I believe it to be absolutely incredible.  I have read the reviews after the fact and believe the crowd and their enthusiasm make it so incredible (despite what people say) to watch.  It's like being in Spain without paying for the plane ticket there.<br />Another reason I like it is because my thirteen-month-old son is addicted to the DVD. He crawls (not walking, yet) into the room, pulls himself up to the TV, tries to turn it on and then starts dancing with the biggest smile on his face.  My mom says she has never seen anything like it.  He starts hearing Bruce and he tries to sing along.  When we turn it off for supper or for bath-time, he gets very upset!!<br />Despite what people have said here, I do believe The Boss is one babysitter I don't mind having around for awhile.  Buy the DVD, especially if you have a young one who loves music.
B00007AJF9|5.0|This movie, aside from blowing me away with its delicacy and its poignant portrayal of Elizabeth I, Queen of England, did something many other books and movies about royalty forget to make clear: &quot;Elizabeth&quot; characterizes Elizabeth I in such a way that we, the viewers, are forced to remember that she was a human and not just a famous monarch. <BR>I disagree with the comments of those who feel that this film delineated Elizabeth as a weak woman who followed the whims of men.  The fact was that, for that time period, Elizabeth wielded a great amount of power.  She was young, and one can just imagine how hard it must have been to assume the throne above many accusing one of heresy. Yes, the film shows the time it took Elizabeth to get used to her role as Queen of England. But even our modern rulers typically cannot bounce right into a prestigious political role without making mistakes or feeling unsure of their own abilities, especially not when despised by a portion of their own people. <BR>Especially toward the end of the film, I felt that a case was made for the strength of Elizabeth's character, rather than the weakness.  <BR>I especially enjoyed the costumes and the poignant musical selections; both were quite realistic, vibrant, and strategically placed. <BR>I even felt that the historical portion of the movie was as well-done as can be expected from Hollywood. <BR>Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this film.  I am of the opinion that the acting was absolutely superb, and that casting was perfect. <BR>Through this film, history comes alive to tell the story of one woman's quest for self-validation in power.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|I dont care what anyone says, this if by far the best album of all time.  I bought this album and it didnt come out of my cd player for 6 months.  every song on this album is a classic, and if you dont own this album you should be ashamed of yourself.  i guarantee that after you hear this album, you will have a new favorite band, the clash.  Joe Strummer was a GENIUS!!!!

0140277447|5.0|It seems that most of the readers who do not like this book do so because they believe that this is complete fabrication. Well...is Nazi Holocaust a complete fabrication? Those Japanese generals... (or should i say savages) did commit atrocous crimes OTHER than rape of Nanking, too... these include mass murder in Kwandong, the comfort woman, Maruta experiments... and those who committed such crimes are actually worshipped in Japanese shrines..what whould you say if Hitler was worshipped and revered as \\"the great leader who benefitted all of Europe by exterminating inferious races of people and tried to bring the true prosperity in the world...\\" and all those German people say \\"alas! if only he suceeded..\\" you know what? if you change the word \\"Nazi\\" with \\"Japanese imperialist... (they themselves would say great leaders)\\" some of the people in 21st century actually believe those lies!! May be that's not their fault...because their government is trying desperately to shut up the mouthes of people who really know the truth..

B0001BKAEY|4.0|And so, \\"The Matrix Revolutions\\" brings the trilogy to a close (or does it? See the title above).  For those who are passionate about the first movie--and there are many, judging from the reviews posted--\\"Reloaded\\" and \\"Revolutions\\" managed to align you in one of the following two camps:<br />1.  You bought into the pop philosophy that is \\"The Matrix\\", reveled in the \\"more questions asked than answered\\" mentality of \\"Reloaded\\", and rejoiced in the religious allegory of \\"Revolutions\\".<br />--or--<br />2.  \\"The Matrix\\" created this incredible alternative reality but, \\"huh?, what happened?\\".  <br />Please allow me to set up my camp somewhere in between.  <br />First, I was totally entertained by \\"Revolutions\\".  Good pacing, incredible action, jaw-dropping CGI effects (although I am feeling \\"bullet-timed\\" to death lately).  Did it, however, wrap everything up in a nice tidy bundle and explain what the hell actually happened?<br />Not really ... but I don't think that's a bad thing.<br />*****SPOILER ALERT (oh hell, you've all seen the movie--why do I bother?)*****<br />The Wachowskis finished the Matrix trilogy in the same manner they started it, by making us question our perceptions of reality (or, at least, the Matrix reality anyway).  Did Neo die?  Was he working for the machines or against them?  Was the Oracle really his ally?  Did he destroy Agent Smith, or did Smith self-destruct when there was nothing left to assimilate?<br />The ending to \\"Revolutions\\" had me scratching my head.  I expected a neat resolution to all the questions posed in \\"Reloaded\\".  I didn't get it.  But isn't that really what the Wachowskis intended?  The Oracle never gave a straight answer.  We shouldn't expect Larry and Andy to do the same.<br />The Matrix Trilogy and, especially \\"The Matrix Revolutions\\", is a high-tech pop-culture shoot-em-up sci-fi action-adventure that makes you think, whether you get it or not.  For even attempting that, the movie deserves high praise.<br />And, for what it's worth . . . Keanu Reeves is as exciting as toast, Carrie-Anne Moss is my ultimate cyberpunk fantasy girl, Laurence Fishburne needs to do a few tummy crunches, and Hugo Weaving plays too good a villain to ever be killed off.<br />So there.
B00018D44U|1.0|The success of Norah Jones is a proof that the world is gone insane, and Grammy Award is totally rubbish.<br />A phony girl with a monotone and pretended 'VOICE'....<br />Why people like her so much?<br />Have they forgotten to take their psychiartric pills for a long while?
B0001BKAEY|5.0|I should be kicking myself for listening to the critics of this film and not seeing it in the theater.  After watching the DVD I was astounded by the action in it.  I love the machinery warfare in the battle of Zion.  You don't need hours of acrobatic CGI stunts to fill the matrix after the first 2 films you get tired with it. I enjoyed seeing mechs blasting robotic sentries.  As for the end of Neo it had to come.  If anyone was following the spiritual philosophies of this series they would understand it's parallel to Christ as in sacrificing himself for the fate of mankind.  It was a known path and Neo knew he would be the balance to the equation.  He was the chosen one.  I thought it was a good plot by the Wachowski brothers.  Sure some people didn't like the ending because they couldn't understand why Neo died or nullified himself.  Others probably caught on to the spiritual philosophy but thought it was a blasphemy.  I for once enjoyed it.  I'm getting the entire Trilogy now.
B0000AQVCL|5.0|This cd is such a good cd. I would recommend seeing them in concert. All the songs are so good with an awesome beat that you can't help see along to with. After seeing them in concert last night, they are definitely a fave band of mine.
B00005JKGZ|5.0|This superb transfer of the Technicolor cinematography truly illuminates Minnelli's fascination with \\"strange stories\\"(a comment he made to me personally in 1961).  In a common director's mind, Meet Me In St. Louis would have been a rather ordinary family musical, but the scene with Judy Garland and Tom Drake turning out the lights and Margaret O'Brien's chilling Halloween Party outburst are psychological explorations of character and context and a hallmark of Minnelli's works. And wait until you hear this extraordinary new soundtrack remastering! This was one of many films most viewers don't know was in large part a product of a woman's artistic venture:  Sally Benson wrote the original story and the book on which the film is based and she contributed to the screenplay, albeit \\"uncredited.\\"  Two other women worked uncredited on the screenplay, which was a common Hollywood occurrence. In my opinion, Margaret O'Brien was the most exceptional child actress of the 1940s, giving due credit to Shirley Temple for the 1930s. Warner Archive has released some of Margaret's other films for MGM and I recommend all of them to you.
0385504209|1.0|We can debate the religious subtext of \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" ad nauseum (and I'll admit that's what got me interested in reading the book to begin with), but it doesn't change the fact that this book is simply not very good.  The characters are thinly drawn and the events and coincidences that bring them together are ridiculously contrived.  I could never accept that a man dying from a bullet wound would have the physical ability and presence of mind to set up an elaborate series of clues to reveal a centuries-old conspiracy.  Dan Brown asks readers to take many plot-oriented leaps of faith in \\"The Da Vinci Code\\".  I couldn't do it.<br />One other plot question:  Since so many \\"experts\\" seemed to know the true nature of the Holy Grail, why was locating it such a big deal?  How can there be a \\"conspiracy\\" to protect an ancient secret if everybody's already in on it?<br />I found \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" to be a literary \\"Blair Witch Project\\".  The backstory was interesting enough, but the plot woven around it fell flat.
B000002KAT|5.0|I can understand why some people think that those who expound upon the virtues of this album are suffering from an acute case of &quot;Emporers New Clothes&quot; syndrome.<br />There is not one hit on this album - no catchy songs and the lyrics arent particularly deep or meaningful. Some of the songs last over 8 minutes with the same 3 chord progression running through - and 1 or 2 moments seem a little bit unrehearsed.<br />All the above is undeniably true - but it doesnt explain why Astral Weeks is one of the most beautiful and soulful albums Ive ever heard.<br />Producing an album with songs which stray from the generic 3 minute verse/chorus formula is a bold move - the listener has to learn to listen to music all over again as if it is a new sound. The hooks are in different places; they lie in Morrison's scats and in the violin meanderings.<br />The genius of this album is the synergy created between the acoustic instrumentation (most noticeably, the bass) and the amazing depth of emotions in Morrisons range and style. It is an epic showcase of his vocal talents - not in a robotic Celine Dion sense - but in a more intimate communicative style.<br />My head doesnt know what he is singing about - but my heart understands every single word. <br />This is what music is all about. Music can reach parts that words and reason can't. Music can cross language barriers and it can be understood by anybody from any background. Morrison's Astral Weeks has hit upon the language of the human soul - a place so remote that even the most deep lyrics cannot reach and the songs (Astral Weeks, Cypress Avenue, Madame George) are channelled directly to the soul.<br />Other songs (The Way Young Lovers Do, Sweet thing) stand up perfectly well away from the album as songs in their own right - but they work best as one homogenous piece.<br />And to think, I owned this album for 2 years before I got it!

B0001O2KQW|5.0|This concert is a must have!  Elvis is in excellent voice and the recording is probably one of the best sounding performances to date.  The sound quality of this release surpasses even Aloha From Hawaii, which I'm sure you know was a big cd production for RCA.  If you love Elvis in Concert, you must have this cd.  A 1994 incomplete release of this concert is available and also sounds great, but I would definately recommend purchasing this entire version.  It's full of Elvis humor, and great renditions of his concert performances.  Honestly, this is probably the closest thing to having Elvis on Tour on cd, except for the now available April 18th 1972 San Antonio Concert.  BUY IT -- It's WORTH IT!
B000089CJI|5.0|This is perhaps the best album I own.  The lyrics, rythms, vocals, every single element of the music, blend flawlessly to create Give Up.  Perhaps the only song that I wouldnt't qualify as amazing would be &quot;Clark Gable.&quot;  Every other song on the album casts the listener into a trance, most especially &quot;Brand New Colony&quot; &quot;The District Sleeps Alone Tonight&quot; and &quot;Nothing Better.&quot;  If you are in any way human being, you will like this album.
B00005NP04|5.0|The country music genre has produced some very talented and strong singers...mainly female. I've never been much of a fan of the men, but the last few decades have seen some powerful divas....Patsy Cline, Dolly Parton, Shania Twain and Martina Mcbride. Martina has a set of pipes on her and this GH's shows it...which is probably why for the last two and a half years, it has been a consistent bestseller and has gone triple platinum.<br />There is not a single bad track on here. Some stand-out more than others, though. The beginning is really well put together offering some of her best tracks right away and hooking you. &quot;My Baby Loves Me, &quot;Independence Day&quot; and &quot;Life #9&quot; are all very catchy...especially &quot;Independence Day&quot; which is arguably her best song. &quot;Strangers&quot; is a gorgeous ballad and has very powerful vocals. &quot;Valentine&quot; is a classic love song and has become a wedding staple. &quot;Concrete Angel&quot; was a huge hit for her in 2003 *I heard it every time i tuned into a country station.* &quot;When God Fearin Women Get the Blues&quot; is bit more rockin and stands out with its amusing lyrics and adds a bit of fun. It's great just to sing along to.<br />Martina McBride is definitely a rare and underrated talent. She has a very versatile quality to her voice. I bet she could sing any genre she pleases and I'm shocked that she has yet to cross over to pop radio much like Faith and Shania did in the late 90's. It's all good though because Martina really excells at country as this collection displays. I do not care what genre you are a fan of, this is a highly recommended album!
0345350499|5.0|I read this book in less than 2 weeks. I could not put it down! i love this book! I cannot see how someone came up with somthing like this. She must of thought for hours! I recomended this book to many of my friends, and now they are fighting over who should get the book. Sometimes I would find them looking at my book and reading over my shoulder when I was reading! It is a truly amazing book, and a wonderful movie! They had some mistakes in it, but over all, THEY ARE AWSOME!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0001AP12G|5.0|Two words, k. west, hot sh**. Mos Def couldn't of said it better, kanyes def whats real right now. I wanna clear somethin up for ya'll tho, if you don't listen to hip hop then don't hate on it and if you listen to sh** like lil jon and david banner then you don't listen to hip hop.  I agree tho that kanye west will never live up to tupac but he could be the realest thing out there since tupac.  How many times do you hear a rapper talk about Jesus and life outta the streets? Rap isn't about who's got the best flow or who's got the hottest rhyming,it's all about the lyrics and creativity.  Kanye's def got the lyrics and the creativity cuz he goes up there and does what he wants to do and isn't afraid to do it (&quot;u think i give a f*ck if you feel me&quot;..from &quot;get em high&quot;) You can relate to these songs, don't matter if ur white,black,whatever. Kanye West is what's real right now if ya'll don't think so u need to listen to some real hip hop.  Rocafella's lucky to have such a talented producer and rapper representin their label.  Big props to kanye, keep doin what ur doin man i support you all the way...here's to the roc, here's to rocafella
0385015364|4.0|A Catholic friend recommended &quot;Orthodoxy&quot; by way of trying to justify faith. While it is a very elegant and wittily written book, I can't say it meets that mark.<br />&quot;Orthodoxy&quot; is the very personal account of G.K. Chesterton's journey to the Christian faith. But because it is so personal, it doesn't explain faith objectively, but rather only to Chesterton's satisfaction. And having reached the same conclusion as Chesterton, I'm sure it is also to the satisfaction of most believers.<br />It is a little frustrating to read the parts where he sets about destroying straw men, or when he proves a point by changing the argument into a semantic one. On the other hand it's a pleasure to see him pick on the likes of Nietzsche. The ultimate lesson that comes from the book, though, is the tautology that faith can't be proven, which is why many good, honest folks don't have any.<br />To Chesterton, life is more romantic and, indeed, livable if you accept that some things are beyond human understanding, that there is no sense in trying to explain them, and that they might as well be explained by magic. He believed that &quot;something that we have never in any full sense known, is not only better than ourselves, but even more natural to us than ourselves.&quot; This no doubt filled him with comfort because it would give rhyme and reason to lots of chaos in the world. But this attitude can also be interpreted as intellectual laziness, if not cowardice. It is much easier to believe, on faith, in &quot;fairy tales&quot; (as Chesterton proudly called them), than to accept the natural world, as inscrutable as it is, and seek valiantly to understand its mysteries before one's time is up.<br />So, while it is an enjoyable read, this book is likely doubly enjoyed by a believer who is looking for a reaffirmation of his faith. Non-believers will find it interesting, if undeservedly condescending.
0385336810|5.0|This book was very entertaining! Emma was an endearing character-if a bit silly at times.  I loved the character of Jack Harper and how he drove Emma crazy with just a raise of an eyebrow or a look! I can easily see this book becoming a movie.
B0001BKAEY|2.0|Here are all the points that make this movie bad and dissapointing. <br />  1. We see in the second film Neo stopping the machines with his own hand giving us a clue that something strange is going on to be seen in the third film. But no there is no surprise, no logical explanation as to why the heck Neo is Superman both in the matrix and in the real world. I don't understand why this happened. The validity of the whole movie is ruined by not justifying Neo's extraordinary powers in the real world. The truce with the machines was a logical finalle. But how we reached to the finalle I really don't know.<BR>  <BR>  2. Trinity really dies in vain and it seems more like black humor to me than a logical flow of the story. (Damn it!!! It's like Lois of Superman being hit by a car and die in the third movie!!! (laughs))<br />  3. After all the dialogues that the Z brothers wrote in the movies they surelly must have run out of ideas and imagination. And they certainly don't know how to talk to their loved ones at a tragical dying moment! How else can I explain the ludicrous dialogue between Neo and Trin when she dies. Luck of emotion? Creativity? They could steal the lines of a cliche movie and still make their point but they decided to ruin the moment with shallow and &quot;cold&quot; lines.<br />  4. There are more points in the film that are not explained with logic (How the hell did Smith reach to the real world???????????) and if you add them up you are left with the bitter end that you where taken for a full and the marketing guys did their job well, when It should be the Z brothers who should make their job well and pay some respect to their own creation.
B000069HJL|5.0|Supertramp, es por mucho, una de las mejores bandas que haya existido, este disco en vivo muestra como debe comportarse un grupo en vivo; coherente con su grabacion en estudio, con improvisaciones disimuladas para no entorpecer al escucha. Cada instrumento es llevado al limite de lo creativo y canciones como HIDE UN YOUR SHELL, FOOL'S OVERTURE, y SCHOOL son obras maestras que sin duda te transportan al mundo que ellos crearon con sus hammonds, metales, percusiones y cuerdas -EL MUNDO DE LA CREATIVIDAD-. Escucho este disco desde que tengo cinco anos y sigue erizandome la piel. Disco que tambien, te hara buscar mas de la banda al grado de querer todos sus discos.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|The Matrix is one of my favorite trilogies. I liked all the movies that came out for the Matrix, but I forgot how good they were. Great movie! In the first sequel, Neo has accepted that he is the One, while all ships are requested to go Zion, the last human city. Sentinals are drilling into the core, trying to destroy Zion, and Smith is back, making copies of himself to attack Neo. Morpheus's crew is trying to find the keymaker so they can better help Zion against Sentinals. Great movie.
B00008MLSH|5.0|Rusalka: &quot;Mesicku na nebli hlubokem&quot; - Dvorak          <BR>La Boheme: &quot;Quando me'n vo' (Musette's Waltz)&quot; - Puccini<br />I listen to these two pieces incessantly......I watched her on German TV at the 300th Anniversary of the founding of St Petersburg........she has real presence and a serene and beautiful voice with range and power. I watched her being interviewed on German TV and she has a sparkling personality - if Russia can produce women like this it is going places, but I suspect women like Anna Netrebko are a rarity and so I shall treasure her !
B00003CXB4|1.0|With this so-called &quot;classic,&quot; Disney totally ripped off Tezuka's &quot;Jungle Emperor Leo&quot; and when confronted about it, they had the gall to deny it. Shame on you Disney and pshaw to all your plausible deniability.
B000002UY3|5.0|If you love &quot;She Hangs Brightly&quot; and Mazzy Star in general, you'll be glad to know she is back with &quot;Bavarian Fruit Bread&quot; by Hope Sandoval and The Warm Inventions.  It's great!
067940581X|5.0|This is my favorite Jane Austen novel.  Yes, Emma the heroine is a flawed human being.  She is a spoiled little rich girl always trying to manage other people's lives, an effort that never turns out well.  For example, she convinces her less-well-off friend, Harriet Smith, that she deserves better than the honest farmer who loves her and whom Harriet loves, and almost upsets Harriet's chances of happiness as a result.  Emma continues in this vein throughout the book, at times being on the verge of doing serious harm, until at last the moment of enlightenment comes - a moment filled with shame and confusion.<br />Of  course, the overall plot in this as in all other Austen novels is the problem of getting married, and in that respect these books represent the original \\"chick lit.\\"  The difference, of course, lies in Austen's brilliant satire of characters like Miss Bates, the village gossip, and in her glorious ability to make the words sing.
B00005QGAV|5.0|His best album ever!! MJ is always evolving, and I love his hard rock songs on this! Michael is innocent, and I support him.
B000059Z8M|5.0|Toy story 2 is one of those movies you'll love to watch a billion times because of the atmosphere, related charecters and a great storyline. Most of the places made like, Al's toy barn or Pizza Planet may be imaginary but a job well done, it's now a recognizable name, and last but not least, the new charecters are greatly added to the storyline, begining the phenomemon of Woody's round up. I loved this movie and i can't wait for the third one. hope the sequel can out beat the 2nd.
B00005JLKB|4.0|Smallville is an excellent rendition of the Man of Steel's humble beginnings. The show is groundbreaking, truly a new genre. F/X notwithstanding, the show's true greatness comes from its character development. Clark, Lana, Pete, Chloe, Lex, and an all-star ensemble, make the show what it truly is . The show does grow campy as the seaason progresses though, what with its kryptonite infused villain-of-the-week growing somewhat tiresome. However the show is truly great, and its cliffhanger season finale leads excellently into the second season, which improves upon the short comings of the first.
B000002LND|5.0|Madonna's \\"The Immaculate Collection\\" is a great collection of her massive hits.

B00005QGAZ|5.0|What can you say about Thriller? It sold more that 60 million copies worldwide, making in the biggest selling album of all time. <br />What can you say about Michael Jackson, who is the biggest selling recording artist of all time?<br />Both amazing. Michael has produced better records though. His best record to date is his second biggest seller, Dangerous, which sold over 32 million copies.
0316666343|5.0|Reading this incredibly deft and redemptive novel was cathartic. The characters are so endearingly human and knowable. It is reassuring to travel with young Susie as she comes to understand how and why life goes on. Read it NOW.
B0001ENY6M|5.0|Words cannot express one's feelings for the portrayal of Jesus' last hours!  &quot;The Passion&quot; only makes it more real, the sacrifice and brutal beating Jesus endured for each one of us.  Had He not, we would not see Heaven!  Lastly, no man or race took the life of Jesus!  It was not ours to take.  Jesus freely gave His life for each of us.  I would definitely see this movie again, and bring along anyone willing to see it!
B00005JMJ4|1.0|Could a movie GET any more boring than this one?! I don't think so. Two depressed Americans wander around Tokyo..that's it..that's the whole movie in a nutshell. If there was any real action at all it must have occurred when I dozed off, unless you count the guys playing games in the arcade.
B000002BVN|5.0|This album is truly amazing. The songs give different meanings and feelings. Some songs feel like you are in the city streets feeling everyword. This album is the biggest selling remix album ever.  Michael has produced several big sellers, and NO ONE has surpassed one of his records whether record sales, effort, or feeling and emotion. <br />Here is a reveiew for all the tracks of this amazing album:<br />Blood On The Dancefloor: 10/10- Amazing. You can feel it and you just want to dance.<br />Morphine: 10/10- Strong and amazing. Very Dark side. <br />Superfly Sister- 10/10- The voice is so amazing, and when he hits his falsetto, its breathtaking. Amazing, amazing, amazing. <br />Ghosts- 10/10- What can you say. Michael has probably the most unique, and special voice in music history. This track is truly amazing and catchy. <br />Is It Scary- 10/10- I like this one more than Ghosts, both sound the same!<br />8 Million Copies Sold Biggest Selling Remix Album  Biggest Selling Recording Artist in History...AMAZING AND INNOCENT
B000002MU3|4.0|I know many R.E.M. fans who carped about the departure made by the band here in terms of the sound of &quot;Monster&quot;.  <br />Know what?  I'm glad they did it.  I like when a band is willing to take risks; I like it even better when that risk pays off.  R.E.M.'s &quot;Monster&quot; is a terrific album from beginning to end.<br />Catchy songs such as &quot;What's the Frequency Kenneth?&quot;, &quot;Crush with Eyeliner&quot;, &quot;King of Comedy&quot;, and &quot;Star 69&quot;, make you move whether you like it or not.<br />&quot;I Don't Sleep, I Dream&quot;, &quot;Tongue&quot;, and &quot;Strange Currencies&quot; are the type of evocative and pensive songs R.E.M. does so well.<br />&quot;Bang and Blame&quot; is a great song, period.<br />I know that this doesn't sound like the band's early work, or even like what was to be found on &quot;Out of Time&quot; and &quot;Automatic for the People&quot; but to me it's a splendid detour, one that few other bands would dare take, much less do with such aplomb.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|Just say NO. An hour and 42 minutes of my life...wasted. Don't let this happen to you! Watch a test pattern...twiddle your thumbs..it will have the same effect as this movie.

There are romantic songs, including a number one hit duet with Siedah Garret on &quot;I Just Can't Stop Loving You&quot;. This album is one of Michael's biggest sellers. Michael has produced several big sellers, and NO ONE has surpassed one of his records whether record sales, effort, or feeling and emotion. <br />Here is a reveiew for all the tracks of this amazing album:<br />Bad: 10/10- Amazing.

B00004XONN|5.0|Kid A, in my opinion is Radioheads masterpiece. I would rank it alongside The Beatles and Pink Floyd for greatest album ever. For the whole 50 minutes the listener is unable to do anything but be amazed by the sounds he/she is hearing. From the first chords of 'Everything in its right place,' to the plinky plonky keyboards of 'Kid A' to the base driven 'The National Anthem' ... and a perfect closer 'Motion Picture Soundtrack' this album has it all! For any Radiohead fan who rejected this and still loves the Bends or OK Computer, I STRONGLY RECOMMEND pulling this out and giving it another go, its worth it. And for anyone who hasn't heard of Radiohead you should drive to the nearest record store and buy this or another of their CD's. I would give a track - by - track analysis but if i did, all songs would get 10/10. I think the only track that dosn't really do much for me is Optemistic, but is still a great track. Please take my advice and give this CD a chance, because once you do, the way you view music will change forever. I know it did for me.
0452285186|4.0|Very sick and twisted book.  A few toons fall flat, and some take too long to play out (taking several panels to accomplish what could be said in two or three), but some are very funny, indeed. Could've been a bit longer, too (only 80-90 pages).  For all those who loved 101 USES FOR A DEAD CAT and HAPPY TREE FRIENDS.
B0001AP12G|5.0|i think this is one of the best albums i own its just so sick and i recomend everyone to get it.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|No chase scenes or superficial stereoptypes.  Just deep characters living realistic lives.  Interesting, not exciting.  If you'd rather flip through a Sharper Image catalog than read an engrossing novel about human beings, don't bother seeing this.  Great film.
0553275976|5.0|An amazing romp through 1980s New York, Wall Street, the court system, and the lives of the rich and aspiring to be rich.  Through the downfall of wall street trader Sherman McCoy, Wolfe brings the reader into the psyches of his characters, forcing one to sympathize with even the most despicable. In the process, he helps us to understand humanity. Highly recommended.
0743455967|5.0|Everybody who writes -- or who wants to write -- should include this book in their library.  As a teenager, I had read all of Stephen King's works.  Now, as somebody who wants to write, I was very excited to have found this book.<br />This is really two books in one.  The first is a quick autobiography of Stephen King.  It begins with his family life... his mother and genius brother.  He wrote about some of the things that has influenced and inspired his life and his stories.  He wrote about how he first began writing and what life was like before and after writing success.  When I first read this, I was shocked to find him writing an autobiography instead of giving lessons on writing.  However, I not only ended up loving this section, but it also gave great insight on what it takes to BE a writer.<br />The next section is his \\"No bull crap (that was censored)\\" approach to writing.  He gave several tips on things to do while writing (like, of course, writing in the active voice) and he also gave several examples of things NOT to do while writing.<br />If you want to be a writer, you've got to pick this book up.  Stephen King is truly a master of the art of writing and found this book to be an invaluable addition to my library!
0679731725|5.0|The beautifully subtle recollections of an English butler during a country drive in England.  Moving, with a unique style and voice.
020530902X|5.0|When it comes to writing, this is not only a wonderful book to read cover to cover, but it is also a great reference to keep as well.  I would imagine that nearly everybody needs to write (whether at work, letters, reviews on Amazon, or for fun) so everybody should have this as part of their library.<br />While there are several other books I would suggest keeping around, there really is no substitute for this book as it is THE book to have within arms length while writing.

0671027344|5.0|about a boy coming of age.  <br />Charlie sees the world more intensely than most.  He observes--sometimes to the extent that he forgets to participate.  His story unfolds in a year's worth of letters to an anonymous stranger and brings us into Charlie's world.<br />The story will touch you and remind you of what it was like to grow up. The pain, the confusion and the occasional joy!
0064471047|5.0|Fantastic, creative, fantasy for young adult readers.  I'd recommend the whole Chronicles of Narnia series to read and reread.
B0000033P2|5.0|This album is perfect.  Trilogy and Endless Enigma are powerful and beautiful.  (The Moog solo in Trilogy in particular is stunning.)  From The Beginning is, I think, Lake's most beautiful composition.  The Sheriff is fun and definitely not a throwaway.  Hoedown rocks !!  Living Sin showcases Lake's vocal extremes and has a fabulous ending.  And Abaddon's Bolero ... it's a wonderful homage to Ravel and offers great rewards if you are patient enough to listen to it carefully.<br />Buy this CD and enjoy it !  You will not be disappointed.
0156711427|5.0|Beautifully woven and written story about the relationships between a small group of Indians and English and the larger issues preventing durable relationships among them.  Offers an realistic and intriguing picture of British colonialism and colonists in India.
B0000033TE|5.0|I'll admit I'm not crazy about the opening track, but the remainder of this album is fabulous.  Emerson's choice of Moog voices in Toccata is astounding and pure pleasure to listen to.  Still You Turn Me On is a fabulous beautiful Lake ballad.  Benny the Bouncer, like The Sheriff on the Trilogy album, is fun but not a throwaway.<br />Karn Evil 9 is, of course, the masterpiece on this album.  Critics have complained of a lack of consistency or datedness .. GET OVER IT !  This work is musical heaven.  Like great classical music, you will find that you enjoy and love the work more each time you listen to it.<br />If you like Karn Evil 9 on the Brain Salad Surgery CD, be sure to also get the Welcome Back... live CD set !
0452282152|3.0|A fictionalized account of the story behind the girl with a pearl earring in Vermeer's painting.  By the end, I found it satisfying, but much of the beginning and middle seemed forced to me.  In trying to put in the details of 17th century life in Holland, I found myself imagining the author with her history books more than I imagined a deep picture of average life.  Not a book I'd highly recommend, but still moderatly impressive for its creativity.
B000007MVD|5.0|I was listening to my copy of 'Live at the BBC' today and I realized something: I prefer it to not only the Anthology collection, but also the '1' collection and a few of the Beatles actual albums!  Wheras the Anthology albums are at times frustrating to listen to and rarely do they actually reveal anything about the construction of classics, this CD is a joy to listen to!  '1'  is a good place for beginners to start, but it is hardly a great collection of the best Beatles songs (there are no songs on it from Rubber Soul, Sgt. Pepper, or The White Album!) I even prefer 'Live at the BBC' to 'Let It Be' and 'Please Please Me'.  <br />While this not only provides listeners with insight into the kind of music the Beatles were influenced by, it also is a valuable piece of history.  The Beatles are the greatest band ever to exist, and this album shows the transition of the Beatles from a pop group to real artists.  But 'Live at the BBC' isn't really about studio experimentation or making great statements in their songs.  This is just a fun collection of great rock n roll songs.  The Beatles still sound like their having a ball being Beatles.  <br />'Live at the BBC' is guaranteed to get you tapping your foot and bobbing your head.  The Beatles' wit is shown in the various interviews in between songs.  Their musicianship is also displayed as they whip out classics- their own classics like 'A Hard Days Night' and 'Love Me Do' as well as rock n roll classics such as 'Johnny B. Goode'.  <br />I love 'Live at the BBC' and I wish it didn't live under the shadow of the Anthology series.  While the Anthology DVD is absolutely excellent, the albums leave a lot to be desired.  The came can be said of the '1' CD- though I have to give '1' credit for getting me into the Beatles.  Sure, I wasn't alive when the Beatles were together (I wasn't even alive when John Lennon was), but I have taste in music and I know more about the Beatles than many people who WERE there.  This is an excellent CD, well worth your time.  Trust me.
0385512104|4.0|Narrated by the unique voice of an autistic teenager, the book recounts his life - from his investigation into who killed the neighbor's dog Wellington, his efforts to pass math A-levels, and his observations about life and his parents relations, all the time providing a compassionate look at the both incredible and sad functioning of an autistic mind.  The middle of the book, as Christopher journeys to his mother in London, gets boring, but overall it's a good read and a unique voice.
B000002UB6|4.0|I hesitated when reviewing this album: should I give it four or five stars?  I eventually settled on four because while 'Let It Be' is great, it just isn't up to par with the White Album, 'Sgt. Pepper', 'Revolver', 'Rubber Soul' or 'Abbey Road'.  <br />This is a hard album for me to review because I have mixed feelings about it.  Though it is the Beatles album I least listen to, whenever it is in I really enjoy it.  I think the problem is that we all know what was happening within the band while they were making this forced album.  Everyone wanted to be somewhere else (with the possible exception of Paul) and it shows... sometimes.  Some of the songs are just as good as usual.  <br />John seems to be absent on this album.  He is so busy with Yoko and as a result is overshadowed by Paul and George.  But when he does appear, he is just as great as always.  His duet with Paul, 'Two of Us', is lovely and nice to listen.  'Dig a Pony' is a great rock song and his voice is perfect for it.  'Across the Universe' is one of his best songs ever.  It is the highlight of the album, for me anyway.  Besides that, John only appears in the short filler songs ('Dig It' and 'Maggie Mae') and in backup vocals.  What happened John?<br />Paul really dominates on this album.  He wrote 'Two of Us'.  He also also contributes number one hits 'Let It Be', 'Get Back' and 'The Long and Winding Road'.  Paul also sounds great on his other duet with Lennon, 'I've Got a Feeling' (I think they both wrote the section they are singing). 'One After 909' is incredibly out of place on this album.  I don't understand why John's incredible 'Don't Let Me Down' isn't on the album.  'One After 909' is a song John and Paul wrote before the Beatles were even famous.  <br />As usual, George is great on this album.  His two songs are highlights on the album.  'I Me Mine' has verses that are very waltz-like and choruses that really rock out.  'For You Blue' is an extremely catchy 12-bar blues song that he wrote for his wife of the time.  Thank God for George, right?  Ringo, however, barely does anything on 'Let It Be'.  He doesn't even sing.  <br />Overall, this is a good album, but it should listened to only after hearing all of the Beatles other albums and when you understand that this album documents the band's break up.
B00005JMEW|5.0|\\" When you kill a king, make sure the first strike is mortal, for there will be no second.\\" First off, Kill Bill may be the most underrated movie ever. I have read many conflicting reviews, reviews which all have one thing in common. They say Kill Bill is a well-made movie; it is just not a good movie. I have to strenuously object to this consensus. Quentin has made a movie that you can neither classify nor quantify; therefore you should not be passing judgment upon this film until you truly understand it. I'm not being arrogant or hypocritical here. I do not fully understand it either. I can safely say I enjoyed it, but that is all. This movie is \\" a conundrum wrapped in an enigma.\\" I have discerned that there are many obscure details that Quentin has infused into his film. I shall probably have to watch this movie at least ten times before I can really decide whether it is a good movie or not. Peace out.
B000002UB3|5.0|Of course, the Beatles had to go out with a bang.  They couldn't let 'Let It Be' be their swan song!  Sure, 'Let It Be' has some great songs on it, but overall it just isn't up to the Beatles standards.  'Abbey Road', however, is the perfect way for the Beatles to exit the music scene.  This is their most eloquent, beautiful album.  <br />'Abbey Road' is a very happy album and it will leave you feeling this way after you have listened to it.  All four Beatles make excellent contributions to the album and it shows.  From start to finish, this is an absolute masterpiece.  Some albums are just classics.  This is one of them.<br />John Lennon is probably the least involved Beatle on this album.  He had lost interest.  He wanted to go make weird avant garde music with Yoko.  However, he did leave us with a couple of excellent songs.  'Come Together' is one of his best and a very interesting song.  It was the perfect way to open the album.  The lyrics are insane.  'I Want You (She's So Heavy)' is a great song.  I like the way it is so simple and that the lyrics are pretty much the title.  That riff that goes on forver is great.  'Because' is a haunting and beautiful song that puts great use to the three-part harmonies used in early songs like 'This Boy'.  John also contributed three songs to the medley, but I'll talk about that in a second.  <br />Ringo has a couple of shining moments on 'Abbey Road'.  His warmth and pure enjoyment at being a Beatle bleed right on the records.  He adds something to the band that is hard to describe, but it's certainly palpable.  His song 'Octopus's Garden' may not be the most brilliant song ever composed, but it is lots of fun and great to sing along with.  Ringo's drums are also great on 'Abbey Road', particularly 'Come Together' and his one and only solo ever in 'The End'.  <br />Paul was really spearheading this album, as he did almost all of the Beatles late albums.  He and George Martin are really the reason that 'Abbey Road' was sogreat.  His songs on side one are great.  'Maxwell's Silver Hammer' is catchy and creepy at the same time.  'Oh! Darling' rips it up and Paul's voice is amazing on it.  However, it's side two that really does it for 'Abbey Road'.  As mentioned in every review, it is made up of two medleys and a few normal songs.  Unlike what most people say however, 'You Never Give Me Your Money' is not part of the medley.  It is a great stand aloen song that happens to change tempos several times.  Paul and George Martin really topped themselves on the medleys.  By stringing together a bunch of unfinished songs, they created a masterpiece.  John wrote the first three ('Sun King', 'Mean Mr. Mustard' and 'Polythene Pam') and Paul wrote the rest.  It is such a great climax to the Beatles career.  <br />Even though Paul is incredible on 'Abbey Road', George manages to steal the show.  He only turns in two songs, but they are better than anything else on the album (even the medley!).  'Something' is one of the best ballads ever composed and 'Here Comes the Sun' is just so happy and warm.  It's a shame that George was just peaking as a song writing when the Beatles were ending.  Wait.  No it isn't.  John and Paul just wouldn't have let him put all of his great songs on the albums.  <br />This is a classic album!  Buy it!
B00005JMEW|5.0|\\" When you kill a king, make sure the first strike is mortal, for there will be no second.\\" First off, Kill Bill may be the most underrated movie ever. I have read many conflicting reviews, reviews which all have one thing in common. They say Kill Bill is a well-made movie; it is just not a good movie. I have to strenuously object to this consensus. Quentin has made a movie that you can neither classify nor quantify; therefore you should not be passing judgment upon this film until you truly understand it. I'm not being arrogant or hypocritical here. I do not fully understand it either. I can safely say I enjoyed it, but that is all.

B00005JMJ4|1.0|It is a shame that elitists stick together so well.  It is because of their superior pride they lift up the work of their comrades when artistic value is lacking.  Lost In Translation is a movie that should have been a lost screenplay.  This movie is boring, stagnant, and just another sophisticated comedy created to help people with insomnia get some much needed rest.<br />Bill Murray has a few bright moments in this movie.  And there are but a few.  Most of this movie is comparable to watching \\"The Real World\\" on MTV, only even more of a disaster - so much wasted film, so much wasted time.<br />Scarlett Johansson is just a pretty face, and she had no business sharing the silver-screen with Bill Murray.  Her acting consisted of widening her eyes and stretching out on the bed or window seal; not much talent needed in this disaster of a comedy, drama, or whatever it was supposed to be.  I will check the cast of every movie I rent to make sure I never suffer through her work again.<br />Bottom line - (...) This movie is definitely a sleeper though, I'll give you that.  Please, try acting or something; (...)<br />Peace-out!<br />God Bless. (...)
B00007AJF9|5.0|...Cate was robbed!  If anyone anywhere was ever robbed of the Best Actress Oscar it was Cate Blanchett. Everytime I think of how Gwyneth Paltrow ( someone who couldn't act if you taped her mouth to Meryl Streep's face ), came up and stole the Oscar we all know belonged to Cate I'm reminded of why Hollywood is now in such a horrid mess. Since then I truly realized Hollywood didn't care about real talent but who was hot at the moment. Cate had a lot of things against her: she wasn't American and she wasn't the \\" conventional \\" beauty though I think she's ten times more beautiful than most of the women on the big screen now. All you need to know is this is the best Elizabeth film ever made!  Since I saw it I became a Cate Blanchett fan and bent down to kiss the ground to show god how glad I was to finally find a truly great actress since the 80's. Cate Blanchett played Elizabeth with the right amount of sexuality, innocence, essence and power that could only describe the woman who led England through \\" The Golden Age \\". I believe Elizabeth (I) would have been honored to have such a powerful presence portray her as Cate Blanchett did.  Cate stripped the character of tasteless glamour and became the virgin queen right before our eyes. If there was ever a woman born to play a role it was Cate Blanchett as Elizabeth. If you don't see this film you are missing a wonderful version starring a mesmerizing, charming little lady who took acting to new heights. This proves once again that the Oscars has nothing to do with talent but personas. Cate will always be the Best Actress winner of 98-99 in my book. Get this film and I am sure you'll agree.
B0001BKAEY|1.0|And yes, it's every bit as bas as that sounds. The plot holes, the laughably bad dialogue, the cheesiness ingrained in every scene consistently reminded me of both of those films.     Where to begin? First, \\"Revolutions\\" doesn't even offer one cool action or kung-fu scene. The climatic fight between neo and smith is like \\"Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon\\" without the martial arts. Then there's the plot holes, far too many to list, but for example:     1. Why dont the sentinels have guns or weapons of any kind? This is the best the machines could come up with?    2. Why didn't Zion just wait for the sentinels to flood the dock, and then fire the EMP blast? Why did they send all those infantry to die first?    3. Why would machines hold up their end of the agreement made with neo? If all the prisoners are released, how will the machines power their city?    The editing is amazingly bad, but at least this provides the most enjoyable part of the movie, when they're entering the machine city and they insert the cut of trinity warning \\"sentinels\\" about 10 cuts after they should have (seriously, watch the scene carefully-its hysterical).    Even agent smith, which was the best thing the trilogy had going for it, is awful in \\"Revolutions\\". In the previous two films  smith had this menacingly cool demeanor and great dialogue, but in \\"Revolutions\\" he is a cartoon super-villian and gets lines like \\"this is my world! mine!\\"    Other problems: additional worthless side plots involving characters absolutely nobody cares about. A complete lack of challenging metaphysical subject matter or surprises, both present in the first two. And WHY is that scene where jada pinkett smith steers her ship through the mine SO LONG?? WHY!?!??    Seriously, one of the 10 worst movies ever made. And I loved the first two.

0385510438|3.0|I was hoping for another sleepless night poring over the pages of my latest purchase - alas, I just knew from the title title that JG was back in the saddle and about to hand us another heart-stopping,suspense-filled saga.

0743216458|5.0|The words &quot;we stand alone together...&quot; come from the Curahee scrapbook of the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment (506 PIR).  Band of Brothers highlights the journey of E Company from the 506 PIR in the 101st Airborne Division.  This fabulous book higlights the success and failures of the men that served in this honored and famous company.  Ambrose beautifully shows us what it was like to live through the time period and the hell of war.  While reading the book, I felt like I was running along with Captain Winters while he captured two 88 Flak guns from the Germans at Normandy, digging in the foxholes and experiencing life as a medic with Doc Roe at Bastogne and sharing Webster's pain when he didn't have enough points to be sent home at the end of Europe Invansion.<br />Spielberg magically catches the wonders of this book and made one of the best mini-series I have ever seen.  After reading this book, I highly suggest seeing the movie and buying the collector's edition Tin Set.  Trust me, both the book and mini-series are well worth the money.
0684833395|4.0|Joseph Heller's Catch-22 has been seen as a controversial but classic twentieth century novel because of its rebellious nature and questioning of authority that easily places it into the social context of the American 1960s.  Through the main character, Yossarian, and his various situations the author seems to comment on the individual use of morality as a counter to the governmental use of authority and power in a military bureaucracy.  Yossarian, a soldier in World War II, and his squadron's fate are placed in the hands of a group of leaders who are willing to sacrifice their men's lives for personal gain in the form of recognition.  Heller seems to use this situation to comment on the authoritative use of bureaucracy in that the men are led into futile situations by a bureaucracy that not only discards logic, but also has no regard for its defenders.  Yossarian and his fellow soldiers must use the illogical laws of their war bureaucracy to their advantages in order to survive.  They are all subject to the law of Catch-22.<br />Heller's Catch-22 ultimately defines situations in which all of the solutions of any given situation have negative results.  The author uses Catch-22 throughout his novel to show how logic can be circumvented in order to force Yossarian and his squadron to suffer through numerous personal situations and remain at war in a sort of bureaucratic military entrapment.  Catch-22 is used when Yossarian, as an instinct of preservation, tries to be discharged from the military-or at least tries to avoid combat-by claiming that he is insane.  But by claiming that he is insane, he is therefore seen as sane because no reasonable person would want to fly bombing missions.  Again, Catch-22 is used against Yossarian when he is offered the choice to be court-martialed or be released upon his approval of the policies of Colonels Cathcart and Korn.  The Catch-22 is that the policies require the men to fly eighty missions before being sent home and thereby jeopardizes their lives.<br />Perhaps the most important point that Heller makes in Catch-22 is that there is an alternative to Catch-22.  At the end of the novel, Yossarian discounts Catch-22 by opting for a different way out of war.  He deserts his unit and goes to Sweden, a neutral country, and rejects the military bureaucracy.  By this, Heller seems to say that while Catch-22-a contradictory condition of circular reasoning that holds its sufferer in its irrational environment and benefits only those who have made up the law-may seem inescapable; there is ultimately a way out.  Heller depicted World War II with a sense of disenchantment with the military.  This may be what made Catch-22 so controversial during the Vietnam War (and in the wake of what was considered The Good War).  Yossarian not only questions authority, but he finds an ultimate solution through desertion.  This is definitely not something that the government would have wanted young American draftsmen reading, however, it is valuable in its depiction of morality in the face of illogical or immoral situations such as war.
B000000OAA|5.0|definitely if youre a queen beginner, you may not be familiar with this early queen jewel, despite the fact that it contains 2 concert staples (killer queen and now im here). However, the first half of the record present the heavy rock band that Queen originally was and we love so much, for instance you can hear the excellent brighton rock and the proto speed metal &quot;stone cold crazy&quot;, just marvellous. The second half is a bit softer, but it remains its quelity, in a different way though, you can hear the catchy misfire, leroy brown,...there is practically no filler in here. All in all, not for a beginner, but if you like the art rock, heavy riffs band, that early queen was, you cant go wrong with this. Highly recomendable. <BR>Try to get the european version, it comes without the bonus track (what were they thinking!!), just the original list.

B00003CXXP|5.0|I'd just like to start off by saying that I LOVE this movie. It's in my opinion, one of the top 100 best movies of all time.<br />Yes, I know this movie got mixed reviews. You know why? For two reasons; 1)Because people don't get it, and 2)Because it has plot holes and problems.<br />It's really not as complicated as people think it is. There are just some folks among us who don't know their head from a hole in the ground, and that's fine. They can go watch American Pie and leave the good stuff to us.<br />It's SCI-FI! It's not real! Of course there will be plot holes and problems!!! But that's fine, it's not real. It's a fantasy and in SCI-FI anything can happen.<br />That said, I'll get onto what I really thought about this movie. I came into it as a $10 DVD from Cub Foods, it'd be OKAY. For ten bucks, why not? I sat down and immediately was drawn in by the stunning acting but Haley Joel Osment, and to a lesser degree, Jude Law. Even the animatronic bear, Teddy The Super Toy, plays a vital role at some points. Plus he's really cute in a movie filled with dark/harsh futureness, and that's cool. (I actually contemplated sending Steven Spielberg and extra $20 because it was worth the full price.)Every scene just makes you question the humanity of David more and more. Is he meerly a robot(mecha)? OR does he want to become a real boy, and doesn't the fact that he wants to become a boy, make him human enough to be a boy? After all, he did many many unantisipated things, even beyond the boundaries of his programming. This is a great topic for discussion. Could we really love a robot? Yes, I believe so. If it looked and acted as wonderful and David. But is it ethical?<br />In the grand scheme, each scene is so different and poignant with a point to make, and David's journey to find The Blue Fairy is sad and happy simultaniously. I was in tears during the last 45 minutes and during the moving 15 minute epilogue as well.<br />Yes, it could have been cut off after the submergence scene, but I feel the epilogue really was an emotional release that was necessary and beautiful. It's excellent when movies have somewhat happy endings.<br />This is a movie that changed me. It became a part of my emotions and the way I see the world. It's such a vision, it's a shame I (and others) stayed away this long. I'd recommend it to everyone. If you see it, and don't understand it...well, go ask your smartest looking friend.

B0001BKAEE|4.0|The Matrix Revolutions wraps up the entire series with the same mystique that the original had.  While I think that this movie is nowhere near as good as the original, it does manage to leave us with a well-paced, exciting, and fun end to the trilogy.  While it is true that there were plenty of the uneasy quirks the entire series had us endure (i.e. the spitting blood and martial arts moves that end with the close-up &quot;bring it on&quot; hand wave), it remains a great action packed thrill for the senses.<br />While for some, it isn't the &quot;All answers revealed&quot; film it could have been, I liked it because it allowed YOU the viewer to sit back and think it through yourself.  Personally, I don't like too many films that gives you all the answers on a silver platter.  It gives you a reason to watch it more than once.  I get something new out of all three films every time I see them.  But if you ask my opinion, I think that The Source blew up the Smiths.  It used Neo's body to do it once Smith got him.  But again, that's my own opinion.  <br />Don't forget that this is &quot;JUST A MOVIE.&quot; It is not real and it does not try to give us the meaning of life.  Movies like this should just be enjoyed for what they are: a nice little escape from real life.  Now that its over, it's time to get back to the real world for a while.
B00005JKNF|4.0|Gosford Park is good fun and worth seeing, but, like most of Robert Altman's movies, you have to take the good with the bad. The whodunit can be solved before the murder ever occurs (ask yourself why actors of such high magnitude are playing such lowly characters); the story is more clever than wry, more cynical than comical; the convoluted plot cursed with quite a few irrelevant characters; and there's an overwhelming air of self-importance to the thing. I likened the Weissman character to Altman himself - the American auteur who decides, for a kick, to dabble in the world of ineffectual British aristocrats. <br />But you can't go wrong with such a stellar cast, all of whom are obviously having a hell of a good time making the film. And the quick jumps and cuts between &quot;upstairs&quot; (the guests) and &quot;downstairs&quot; (the servants) certainly keep the viewer's attention. I didn't even mind the accents, which can be a problem in British films - I didn't understand some of the dialogue, but it's clear from the direction that they aren't saying anything useful anyway! The film does well to take such a huge cast and create notable, memorable characters without spinning wildly out of control, thanks to Altman's skill and the Julian Fellows' taut, sharp screenplay. It's a vast film that takes place in the confines of a very small space.

0446605409|5.0|I have attempted to read this book on many occassions but somehow I have never been able to get past a certain point with all of the details. But Nelson DeMille is my absolute favorite author and I knew that if I just kept holding on the pay off would be big.  This book is true to form.  It is slow to develop both in terms of the plot and the characters.  But once this book takes hold (like all of DeMille's for me) you cannot put it down.  The last 200 pages are suspenseful and funny.  I should say the entire book is funny even though about death as seen through the eyes of Det. Corey.   Why 5 stars if I had to struggle through the first half of the book?  Well, DeMille has huge payoffs and this one did not disappoint.  All of the details mean something and add to the ultimate enjoyment.  I have never been disappointed in DeMille book.  So if you like books that slowly place the dots and then connects them (through a sarcastic NYPD detective)this book is for you.

B00005JKN9|5.0|Martin Scorsese, in his distinguished 35+ year career, is most famous for doing gritty, violent films set on the streets of modern-day New York City. With GANGS OF NEW YORK (2002), he has created a film that is a rather polished period-piece, set in mid-19th Century NYC---and is perhaps his most violent film to date. However, what is most important about this film is what it succeeds in doing. What it succeeds in doing is to bring to life a part of the history of New York City that is never discussed in grade school---even in New York City itself.<br />Having been born and raised in the largest city in North America, and living most of the first 31 years of my life there, I can tell you from experience that the New York City of the mid-19th Century is only peripherally touched on in the NYC public school curriculum---at least it was when I was a kid! Sure, in Junior High School we were BRIEFLY taught about William &quot;Boss&quot; Tweed and the corruption of his political machine known as Tammany Hall, but it never received any serious study. After watching my DVD of GANGS OF NEW YORK, I believe that the lack of study on the subject was a serious mistake. <br />Martin Scorsese did more than just serious study---he brought this relatively unknown chapter of my city's history to life. You may say that he tells a rather traditional revenge story within the confines of a period piece. Even so, he still completely captures a time and a place with such startling clarity of detail that it is never anything less than intriguing---you actually feel like you've been transported back in time to 1846 at the beginning of this picture. <br />This is when Priest Vallon (Liam Neeson, in another powerful and gripping performance) leads his band of Irish immigrant men, known as the &quot;Dead Rabbits,&quot; in street battle against the &quot;Natives,&quot; led by Bill &quot;The Butcher&quot; Cutting (Daniel Day-Lewis, to whose performance we will get into later), for control of the desperately poor but strategic Five Points area, situated on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. (On a modern-day map, you can locate it as the dividing line between Little Italy and Chinatown, with Little Italy to the north.) Bill mortally wounds Priest Vallon, and proceeds to order his men to make sure that Vallon's young son Amsterdam (Cian McCormack) is well-taken-care-of. Young Amsterdam escapes, and proceeds to spend his next 16 years vowing revenge on The Butcher. When we see him next, he is fully grown and, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, begins to slowly insinuate himself into Bill's gang while feigning &quot;pureblood&quot; status. But, as he begins to be taken under Bill's fatherly wing, does he become too ensnared in his new life and become a pawn of Cutting's growing dominance? Is his quest for revenge too full of hurdles? Does he really have what it takes to avenge his father's death? These are all the questions that Amsterdam finds himself asking by the midway point in the film---and that is where I will stop.<br />In his role as Amsterdam Vallon, Leonardo DiCaprio finds the right tone for his performance. No longer the innocent man-child of some of his previous films, Leo has matured noticeably. His character here is in the finest tradition of Greek tragedy.  I like his subtle variance of speech patterns that convey to us what is untold to his listener. Let's face it, he will never be another Robert De Niro (his co-star, incidentally, in THIS BOY'S LIFE as well as a former Scorsese favorite) but then again, who else is? In my humble opinion, Leonardo has come a long way as an actor; still remember him for the last season of &quot;Growing Pains?&quot;<br />In his role as Bill &quot;The Butcher&quot; Cutting, Daniel Day-Lewis thankfully came out of a five-year, self-imposed retirement from acting to create the greatest role of his storied, and stormy, career. His reading of Bill isn't so much a reading as it is the embodiment of everything for which he stood. Modeled after the real-life &quot;Butcher&quot; William Poole, Day-Lewis creates not a human monster, but a dangerous man with extremely deep convictions, as misguided and misplaced as they were, and full of deadly charm. To create his performance, he put himself back in the place, the time, the man. In doing so, he created one of the most unique, and chilling, villains in recent dramatic history. Daniel Day-Lewis was robbed of what should have been his second career Oscar for Best Actor. <br />I feel that Martin Scorsese was also robbed, as well. It's bad enough that he has never won the Best Director Oscar, especially with an oeuvre that contains at least seven or eight certifiable classics---but to not win for this film was positively criminal. I know, thanks to the Harvey Weinstein backlash, Marty probably lost any chance he ever had to win the coveted award, but still I think the Academy should have looked past the backstage wrangling and honored Scorsese's work on its own merits. <br />Also worthy of merit here are the Art Direction (should have also won here), Cinematography and Supporting Actor performances by Brendon Gleeson, Henry Thomas and Jim Broadbent (as the &quot;Boss&quot; himself). Cameron Diaz, as the only female love interest, fares nicely and does well as a period pickpocket and possible instrument of revenge. Included on the stylish 2-disc DVD set is a wonderful, informative hour-long Discovery Channel documentary, &quot;Uncovering The Real Gangs Of New York,&quot; plus a History of Five Points featurette and, of course, the director's commentary. There is also the nicely-done U2 video for their Oscar-nominated song &quot;The Hands That Built America.&quot; You should build your DVD library with great movies such as this one.<br />MOST RECOMMENDED
B000001Y5J|3.0|The songson broken need more work and most importantly NO RICHARD PATRICK! he put his uneeded two cents in and messed up the CD. the videos they made suck except for happiness in slavery. I'm not trying to be a kill joy but I really think Trent would hve been so much better without Richard and I think the whole eletricuting and elephant clip on closure was a celebration that Richard left the band.
B00005YW4H|3.0|Norah Jones' \\"Come Away with Me\\" hit paydirt after winning so many Grammys in 2003, so I bought it out of curiosity. Well, it is good, but not great.    Her voice is tender and every track is beautifully written. I like to listen to it before going to bed or try to fall asleep. Nevertheless, except \\"Don't Know Why\\" and \\"Come Away with Me,\\" the other tracks sound one and the same. To rectify this monotone, maybe Norah should also try something new in addition to light Jazz and soft pop.    Despite the weaknesses, it's thrilling to have another talented diva on the market. And her debut work is certainly worth praising.

B00005JMEW|3.0|Quentin Tarantino's epic, blood-spewing, over-the-top, fetishistic, vanity production, KILL BILL Volume1 (Miramax) arrives on DVD just in time to wet anew the appetite for the big screen theatrical finale Kill Bill Volume 2.  So much has already been written about this high-profile, visual tour-de-force Asian-cinema martial arts homage and revenge saga (yes, it's all that and more), there's not much left to say.  The story of a massacre by an Asian gang at a wedding rehearsal that leaves pregnant former gang member Uma Thurman for dead is the set up.  The rest is all back story and exposition as a very lithe and determined Uma seeks out all those who block her path to Bill (a barely seen David Carradine), her ex-lover and the gang leader. But the story is really an excuse for dazzling filmmaking and brilliant riffs of heady dialogue.<br />At heart, this is the darkest of comedies, a demented parody of excess.  In the better than average making-of featurette, Tarantino enthusiastically explains the stylistic inspirations (including Sergio Leone) for his film and the origins of the Bride character that he and Uma jointly developed while shooting Pulp Fiction.  Bonus material also includes trailers of Tarantino's three other films and very cool musical performances by \\"The 5, 6, 7, 8's\\" an amazing group Tarantino heard on a juke box in a Japanese bar while scouting locations. If there's any doubt that this movie is tongue in bloody cheek, check out the action figures, Pussy Waqon key chains, flasks, lighters and lunch box paraphernalia on the DVD insert. If you plan to see Volume 2, don't miss this dizzy exercise by a remarkably gifted, intuitive filmmaker.
B0000C9ZLD|4.0|Personally, I love The Strokes. But, let's admit it, this CD (and Is This It) hasn't earned all the hype it's been getting. The lyrics are meaningless, but Casablancas's voice is unique. The lyrics and the singing aren't really what attracted me to this band, however. There are some really great guitarist solos here, the drums are amazing, and the bass is impeccable. If you have even a decent sound system, your ears would greatly appreciate the instrumental sound of The Strokes. Since there are two guitarists in the band, it's fun to distinguish their individual sounds. If you're considering buying this, I reccomend that you do. But you have to let this CD grow on you. You can't just listen to the lyrics, because if you did, you'd be missing out on The Strokes's greatest asset. No offense intended, Mr. Casablancas, but are you sure that you stopped drinking in the process of making the CD? Meet Me In The Bathroom? Get real. Casablancas has a great voice, but he needs praiseworthy lyrics to match it. Some highlights of this album are What Ever Happened?, Automatic Stop, Under Control, The End Has No End, and (of course!) Reptilia. Expect great things from this band, because they definitely have the potential and are willing to excel. As for the saviors of rock, I know we're anxious for another underground band like Nirvana, but The Strokes aren't it. Yet.
B00006RINF|5.0|I'll be honest when i say, that the first time i heard Lacuna Coil was when I saw them live in September of 2003 at an anual radio festival in Huntington, WV. Needless to say, they won me over as a fan. I loved every song they played, and they put on one hell of a show too. I got to meet Cristina afterward, I got an autograph and a hug, and I do say that was the best damn hug I've ever had!! I got this cd shortly after I saw them live, and it is absolutely intoxicating! Get yourself a copy now!
B00005QIPH|3.0|Let's hope, for all of our sakes, that this is NOT it. I never bought this CD because I never really liked &quot;Last Nite&quot;. But when Room On Fire came out (4/5 stars), I decided to give this CD a go. There were some really outstanding songs- good lyrics too (which is the problem area for The Strokes). But &quot;some&quot; is equivalent to about...4. Four of eleven songs (36%!) were good enough to be mentioned in a review. Fab Moretti (drummer), Nick Valensi &amp; Albert Hammond (guitarists), and Nikolai Fraiture (bass guitarist) aren't too bad. And Julian is a gem when he's live in concert (check out the Megadonis Tour). If you ask me, Is This It isn't worth over $11. Buy &quot;Is This It&quot;, &quot;Someday&quot;, &quot;Alone, Together&quot;, and &quot;Trying Your Luck&quot; for 99 cents a piece off of iTunes. It seems to me that Is This It was a rushed album after The Modern Age EP. That's understandable, but this album could have been a whole lot better, and that's basically what Room On Fire is- it's the revised version of Is This It. Both albums are revolved around the same formula, so if you're deciding between Is This It and Room On Fire, go for Room On Fire.
B000060P79|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite CDs. And hopefully it will remain that way. I don't get what the big deal is tho? Hella people are all fussin' about what is and what isn't &quot;real punk&quot;....Hallo....Get over it!!! I don't give a damn what &quot;real punk&quot; is!! As long as it is fun, and catchy, and you love it to death....the fact that it is/isn't &quot;real punk&quot; won't matter!! I listen to everything. I love this CD just as much as I love &quot;Sing The Sorrow&quot; by AFI, which is, far more original than this....But, this is more fun, and you can really relate to it more...it's not as metophorical. I love every single song on this CD!!! Every single song!!! (if i absolutely HAVE TO rate the songs....it would look like this:)<BR>1. I'd Do Anything - 10/10 very catchy. not my fave. but one of my faves!!! <BR>2. The Worst Day Ever - 9.5/10 good song. not my fave. but still good!!!<BR>3. You Don't Mean Anything - 10/10 very fun!!! quite repetitive, yes, but it is a lot of fun still!!<BR>4. I'm Just A Kid - 10/10 definately one of my faves!!! I LOVE IT!!! I LOVE IT!!! I LOVE IT!!! AND I CAN TOTALLY RELATE TO THIS!!!<BR>5. When I'm With You - 10/10 great song. very fun!!!<BR>6. Meet You There - 8/10 not my fave. it's ok tho.<BR>7.

0385504209|5.0|I have always known that religions (Christianity, Islam, Judaism) were simply made up by humans to control others.  This book explains in a whirlwind suspense fashion approaching pure joy how obvious the synthetic nature of organized religion actually is.<br />Long live the goddess!
B00005ATQ9|5.0|If you appreciate good filmmaking you must watch this film! This is an artistic masterpiece for those who appreciation the visual arts. Some reviewers might complain as to the lack of character development, which I agree with, but I don't think it was in Kubrick's interest to have the viewer identify with Ryan O'neal, that focus would do a disservice to the viewer in that it would make him ignore the films more aesthetic qualities. Like a great masterpiece Barry Lyndon's magic does not lie with a single character but with the work itself. Barry Lyndon's strengths lie in the totality of the film and in the immense beauty that is found in every scene. This film is grandeur immortalized, a picturesque view of 18th century Europe. This is a delightful film, and cannot be measured in terms of success and mass appeal, this film is well beyond that.
B00016POFE|5.0|The CD version of &quot;In Abstentia&quot; was, in my estimation, one of the best CDs in years(see my review of the cd).  Be prepared: the DVD audio version blows away the CD.  The surround sound enhances the songs, the instruments and particularly the harmonies in ways that have to be heard. It is a remarkable achievement to take timeless, challenging songs and expand their horizons.  Yet that is exactly what you will find here.  It will be difficult to hear just stereo versions of PTree songs again. As I was listening to the DVD for the first time, I found myself energized by the beauty of the surround sound.  It encompasses you.  There are so many subtleties that are just not discernible on the stereo version:  bursts of guitar, percussion,  Barbieri's touches and Wilson's vocal play reveal themselves throughout.  While the DVD version of most of the songs from the CD are magnificent, I was also stunned at the remarkable achievement on the bonus track &quot;Drown with Me&quot; is in surround sound.  It is incredible.  When the &quot;In Abstentia&quot; CD was released, I could not recommend it any more enthusiastically, however, finding the DVD version is a must for audiophiles and PTreephiles.  Recorded music does not get any better than this.
B00005JMX4|4.0|I'm not usually a fan of the `Teen movie' genre; at best I find them vaguely amusing and at worst painfully predictable. The Girl Next Door isn't a complete exception; we've certainly seen similar plots. However all is forgiven. It is able to pull off a `classic' teen movie plot in a wholesome, sexy, funny and uplifting way. This is achieved by some above average direction (Luke Greenfield), a good script and a superb soundtrack. <br /> (...). You may even end up liking some of these characters. (A first for me with a teen movie).<br />This could have been quite average bit it has been nurtured with care. The Girl Next Door is able to offer us some promising new talent in the forms of Elisha Cuthbert, Emile Hirsch, Timothy Olyphant and James Remar. <br />Good feeling presides as the credits role; I can honestly say this is a welcome change to the tried and tested format.
B000060P79|1.0|boy band with guitars....nuff said...listen up kids...in the music biz there is a person called a manager...and this person finds little bands that are decents musicians...he then throws alot of money at said band and tells them how, what, when, who and where to play the songs that he and a marketing &quot;brain factory&quot; come up with...they then sell this music to the highest bidder (music company) then they bombarde the broadcast tv and radio waves with the music so that you think that everyone out there is requesting to hear it played because it is the coolest thing out there...you then turn around and buy said music because you buy into the marketing and because the music is so &quot;catchy&quot; (a term used when something sounds so familiar that it gets stuck in your head, not asimilar to nursery rhymes you heard as a kid) that you fall in line...hook, line and sinker...the manager/producer makes his money back on his investment, mission accomplished...by the way...thus...simple plan
0553801546|5.0|While I enjoyed each of these books individually, taken as a whole they are one of my favorite series of all time.  Throughout each trilogy I would find myself yelling out loud at Fitz because he would make such a frustrating decision and, yet, I often could not imagine making a different decision myself.  He is just so human.  And I always wanted better for him than he got.<br />I have read several reviews of this final installment that found the story to be too neatly wrapped up.  I disagree.  Admittedly, there is a tidiness to the conclusion but, while I loved the frustration throughout the story, I really WANTED Fitz to be happy in the end.  Conversely, it really isn't all that 'neat' of an ending.  There are still complications.  I thought it was a perfect finale.<br />There were so many times in this book when I was moved to tears by a touching moment between Fitz and one of the many people in his life - Burrich, Patience, the Fool, Chade, and...well...read the book.  The book was especially powerful as it reached its climax which, of course, is about FitzChivalry, not Dutiful and his struggles with the dragon, Icefyre.<br />Hobb's characterization is almost unparalleled in today's market.  Each character is rich, vivid and distinct.  I cannot remember a recent book where so many characters were so well developed.  Of course, Hobb continues with the excellent characters created in other books.  I feel like I know Chade and Kettricken and Patience.  But in these last two books she gently creates another brilliant addition, Thick, to the cast.  Thick makes the story even more human than it already was, which I would have thought impossible.<br />Well done.  A must read.
B00002ND77|4.0|Spike Lee's presentation of Malcolm X was very successful because the Malcolm's character, played by Denzel Washington, was very beleivable and the storyline was real.<br />First, Denzel Washington made the character realistic.  When he gave speeches throughout the movie, every movement and how his voice sounded made me believe I was actually listening to Malcolm X give a speech.  One scene that sticks out is when Denzel played Malcolm giving his &quot;Bamboozled&quot; speech to the people on the streets of Harlem.  This scene was excellent.<br />Also, the story was excellent.  Every scene in the movie was well played out, and the most realistic part in the movie was in the end.  When they killed X, it was real.  It was in front of his family, and he didn't try to fight because he knew that he was going to die soon anyway.  I didn't know much about Malcolm X before I watched this movie, and watching this movie gave me a lot of details and made it easy for me to understand how he came to be who he was and why he beleived in what he did.  <br />In conclusion, this movie was really realistic.  The actor and story were really well played.  I really enjoyed the film.
B0000C9ZLD|4.0|I had great expectations for the second album because I loved the first so much, and when I heard it, I thought they just sounded kind of lethargic.  But I just saw them live on Thursday and they were awesome.  (They even played a cover of the Clampdown by the Clash that rocked my world).  And then I listened to Room on Fire again and realized that it was a pretty great album when I gave it a chance on its own.  The songs still have more energy live though.
0060920432|5.0|This seems to be the kind of book that either you love or you hate.  I loved it.  This is why:<br />It made sense to me.  It helped me understand things about myself that I didn't realize, and it made a difference.  Why do I sit and watch TV when I hate TV and there are a thousand better things to do?  Why do I choose an activity knowing at the time I will regret it later (such as reading a not-great book I've already read, instead of going for a walk or reading one of the great, challenging books on my shelf I haven't read)?  Why do I have so much trouble starting a project I'm really excited about?  Why when I'm doing a routine task like laundry do I start obsessing about past conversations and what I should have said?  I thought it was a character issue - I just don't have enough willpower.  <br />What I understood from this book, the mind needs structure for keeping pyschic order (This is the interepretation that made a difference to me - it may not be a scientifically rigorous representation of his work).  There are two kinds of structure - low level, meaning low challenge and low use of skills.  It doesn't take any psychic energy to get there, but it doesn't provide much growth either.   Examples are watching TV, reading predictable, unchallenging books, redundant social chatter, etc.   Higher level structure means higher challenges and higher use of skills.  Examples playing tennis, brain surgery, model building, drag racing, challenging, thinking conversations or books, basketball, pretty much any work or hobby you enjoy.  It takes some energy or effort to get started, but you get so much more out of it, and generally feel better afterward.  With no structure, the mind tends to wander and get caught by problems or concerns.  <br />In moments throughout the day, having this distinction had made a difference.  Knowing that the pull to do something mindless and easy is not a character issue, but the mind's need for order, I find myself choosing more challengingactivities sometimes.  I'm not sure I've experienced what he calls flow, but I know I feel better if I put forth the energy to do a jigsaw puzzle rather than watch TV, or take a walk rather than eat a pint of ice cream, or work on my writing instead of reading a book. <br />I found the follow-up book, &quot;Finding Flow&quot;, less satisfying because it was less dense and more chatty, and it was mostly a repeat of &quot;Flow&quot;.  If you are interested in the ideas but want something less scientific and easier to read, you might start with that.
B0000W3YIS|5.0|This CD is Great it has 6 great songs on my opinion, <BR>1.Toxic<BR>2.Me Against The Music<BR>3.Shadow<BR>4.Touch Of My Hand<BR>5.Outrageous<BR>6)Don't Hang Up<br />Those songs are Great! But out of Curiousity is there a hidden track? #16? &quot;I've Just Begun (Having My Fun)&quot; I believe thats a hidden bonus track, I'm not sure. But i would like to find out i can't seem to find it written anywhere EXCELLENT CD Though!! Deserves 5 Stars WORTH UR MONEY!! BUY IT NOW!
B000089RVX|4.0|If you love power pop, this CD is an achievement, with rich multilayered production, goth metal stylings, and a female vocalist with a controlled wide range performing strong vocal harmonies. In a live show, I'd really hope there'd be female backup vocals doing those harmonies, especially on the anger anthems &quot;Going Under&quot; and &quot;Everybody's Fool&quot;. The torch-pop &quot;My Immortal&quot; seems a bit incongruous here and is only one of several things about the band that could alienate hardcore goths. There is a little bit of spoken word on &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; but to my ear that is the extent of the hiphop influence--hardly at all compared to, say, Linkin Park. &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; could be about a lover, God, or a mystical force, take your pick. Maybe nobody ever made goth accessible/commercial to this extent before. But some lines in &quot;Hello&quot;--&quot;has no one told you she's not breathing?&quot; and &quot;suddenly I know that I'm not sleeping&quot;--give me room to feel that the unseen force of the album as a whole tilts more toward a dark luminous mysticism. Still, &quot;Tourniquet&quot; does seem to have a mild Christian rock message. But &quot;My Last Breath&quot; is a straight up death trip, with the great line &quot;I'll miss the Winter&quot;. Mixing the Christian with death trip goth on the same recording is a little peculiar (but as I recall one of the guys in Black Sabbath, Tony Iommi maybe, used to wear this big cross around his neck). &quot;Taking Over Me&quot; is both bleak and catchy. &quot;Haunted&quot; has some creepy sounding vocal chorus and keyboard sounds that should be he background for a goth version of the Haunted House at Disneyland. I think it might also be &quot;Haunted&quot; where the drummer totally rocks out. Toward the end of the album, &quot;Whisper&quot; I think, has some baroque strings that could be the dance music for a 3 a.m. cotillion at Aleister Crowley's house.<br />Why I don't give it five stars: A few of the songs sound too much like other songs on the album, and some of those seem to have similar, simplistic chord charts. If you do not like power pop, maybe you won't like Evanescence. Rhythms are way too slow for speed metal freaks. And if everything you own has dance beats and/or rap vocals, forget it. <br />I imagine some goths will love the album, and some will hate it. Personally, the songs do feel like they speak to me and you can check out Amy Lee's handwritten scrawls of the lyrics on their Web site. I don't think you can fake this kind of thing. If there is going to be a major goth commercialization trend--I kind of doubt it, but it could happen--try to see it as the world is validating your outlook somewhat; we live in a hell where we are called to life, that seems to promise it could also be a heaven sometimes. Maybe more people are waking up to that.

B00008H2LB|1.0|So ya... this isn't bad if you have yet to sit down and listen to mind blowing artists such as Pink Floyd, Acid bath, or Deadboy and the Elephantmen. It is obvious that the band recorded every songs around it being played on the raido I mean it has a time span of 35 minutes... this will be forgotten along with a number of other bands that have come out in the last few years. Do your self self a favor and download the demo versons of hybird theroy, it's a good example of what Linkin park is capible of which they don't act on. So i give this effort one star because they can do better and most likely will not be aroubd to make another cd.
B00006NSGX|5.0|Clapton has certainly gotten older, as seen on the video, and I give him tremendous credit for continuing to release new material and go on tour.<br />Both discs are great, but I highly enjoy Bell Bottom Blues, Change The World, My Father's Eyes and She's Gone. Cocaine is a great track as well.<br />I would have enjoyed Badge more had it been played like the version on 24 Nights, and Layla had it been played like the version on Eric Clapton &amp; Friends Live. I wish they had played White Room, which is absolutely awesome in concert.<br />Despite the disappointments above, I give the album five stars given the outstanding performance of My Father's Eyes and She's Gone and a clever version of Over The Rainbow.
076790592X|1.0|this story just wasn't for me. i got tired of hearing all the preachy things morrie had to say.  he thinks in his wisdom he has the answers.  and he does have the answers, for many people who want to hear it...but, i just wasn't one of those people.  i quit reading it around the 9th tuesday.
B000056NX5|5.0|Short and simple. The first video was great but there is NO comparison! ALL the actors have and unbelievable about of passion and power. The 1st version was flat and unfeeling. I have rarely experienced such powerful acting, and the signing is just as awesome. Love Pilate and Judas and Magdalene and Harod and and and! All
B0000C7PQK|5.0|I have been a huge fan of Enigma since discovering &quot;MCMXCAD&quot; in the mid 1990's. From my first playing of Sadeness, I was hooked! The hot dance track combined with chats created an amazing new sound! Every Enigma album has been a masterpiece, with maybe the exlusion of &quot;The Cross of Changes&quot;. Sure, it had some really good songs, but it just wasn't the masterpiece like 1, 3, 4, and 5. Here came &quot;Voyageur&quot; and it was an obvious change for Michael Cretu and his Enigma. Keeping that same &quot;mystical&quot; Enigma feeling, yet adding stronger electronica beats made it's focus on more of a techno/rave scene. Michael Cretu, you're amazing! Please keep it coming...
0743454529|5.0|Jodi Picoult has once again penned an unforgettable tale! It is impossible to put into words the impact that this book has upon its readers.  Suffice it to say that you will be unable to finish this story without shedding some tears.  You will be unable to put it down until you've reached the final chapter. You will continue to think about &quot;My Sister's Keeper&quot; long after you have finished reading. It is deserving of well more than a five star rating.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|I have seen the Matrix Reloaded a total of 6 times in the theatre and I never get sick of it.  The DVD is something I had looked forward to since I first saw Matrix Reloaded in the theatre.  This movie has it all action, suspense, mystery, along with great new characters like The Ghost twins, The Merovingian, The Architect, and the Agent Smith's muliplying was great.  I don't think there is and better on screen matchup better than Neo (Mr. Anderson) vs. Agen Smith.  I loved the Burly Brawl scene that was classic as was the Highway scene of course.  The Architect scene was just a mind opener even though it left a lot of questions made The Matrix that much more intriguing.  The Matrix is my favorite trilogy and I never get sick of watching any of the three it is just great to have on DVD to pop in whenever I feel the need to plug in.
B000002P5W|5.0|First of all, that Fred Durst fan is an idiot but from reading his other reviews its obvious that he's goofing on everyone (he said that Alice In Chains is a third rate Puddle Of Mudd rip-off and that Tom DeLonge gives Joe Satriani a run for his money).<br />Now to my review. After his debut album 'Are You Experienced?' reached number two and rewrote the rules of rock guitar, Jimi Hendrix had a lot to live up to on his sophomore effort. But thankfully, 'Axis: Bold As Love', does not disappoint. Jimi's R&amp;B influence is much more prominent here, especially on tracks like 'Castles Made Of Sand', 'Wait Until Tomorrow', and the beautiful 'Little Wing'. But don't let that lead you to believe that his playing isn't just as great as on the Experience's first album. He rips through one of his best solos in 'Bold As Love'. 'If Six Was Nine' is one of Jimi's better psychedelic experiments as is the funky 'Up From The Skies'. It is obvious to the listener that his personal songwriting is continually growing and the aforementioned 'Little Wing' is probably his most heartfelt and touching song. After this 'Axis' Jimi would release 'Electric Ladyland' which would take psychedelic guitar farther than anyone would ever imagine.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|I have seen the Matrix Reloaded a total of 6 times in the theatre and I never get sick of it.  The DVD is something I had looked forward to since I first saw Matrix Reloaded in the theatre.  This movie has it all action, suspense, mystery, along with great new characters like The Ghost twins, The Merovingian, The Architect, and the Agent Smith's muliplying was great.  I don't think there is a better on screen matchup than Neo (Mr. Anderson) vs. Agen Smith.  I loved the Burly Brawl scene that was classic as was the Highway scene of course.  The Architect scene was just a mind opener even though it left a lot of questions made The Matrix that much more intriguing.  The Matrix is my favorite trilogy and I never get sick of watching any of the three it is just great to have on DVD to pop in whenever I feel the need to plug in.
B000006OS2|4.0|I am quite intrigued at the popularity that &quot;McLintock!&quot; still has among John Wayne fans and everyone else, in general. This is a very funny story with the Duke and Maureen O'Hara as a bickering couple in a &quot;Taming of the Shrew&quot; story set in the good ol' west. It's one of John Wayne's more comical and lighter-toned films. I have the DVD version of this film, and I have the same opinion like the rest of you; it's quite a sloppy job. Some of the film looks all right; it's nice and sharp at times. You can tell the film is very dated and at times the image becomes blurry and distorted. I can't understand what's been done to such a good film. There have been so many complaints about this inferior release. Something needs to be done. A major movie studio should try to purchase the rights to this film and give &quot;McLintock!&quot; top feeding. Think of how this would sound. Double sided disc A: 2:35:1 Widescreen and B: 1:33:1 Standard: Modified to fit screen (but better pan and scan). Picture quality could have sharp clean frames, vibrant, true-to-life eye-popping colors making you want to be there. Audio: (1) English Dolby Digital Remixed and Remastered 5.1 Stereo Surround (2) English Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo (could be commentary) (3) Spanish (4) French (5) German. Subtitles: English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, German, Dutch, Chinese, Thai.<BR>You could have it loaded with special features. How's that sound for a top notch DVD? Someday, that could happen. For now, we're stuck with this mediocre DVD release. An enjoyable film it is, still.
B00013F38K|3.0|I was very excited to see Kung Fu finally available on DVD. It is one of my all time favorite shows, and watched them all when they orginally aired.<br />It's hard for me to believe that the show has been mutilated by chopping off the top and bottom to have it in a letterboxed presentation.<br />Here's some news for the folks at Warner Brothers: This show was intended to be seen in 4:3!. My widescreen TV will crop the top and bottom if I use the zoom feature (and I wouldn't use it to view 4:3 material). I don't need to be forced into it.<br />I hope that the Metropolitan Museum of Art dosn't follow Warner Brothers' lead and start cutting the tops and bottoms off of paintings because wider frames become more fashionable.<br />I'm throughly dissapointed.
B0000CFW87|5.0|This album is literally breathtaking!  Words cannot describe the feelings these songs inspire in those who are willing to listen.  Whether you are in love, want to be in love, or are nursing a broken heart, these songs will speak to your soul.  Never before have I heard anything like Josh's voice, it is a truly extraordinary gift.  I look forward to the next installment on Josh's long, long career path.
B00005JM4Z|1.0|I can not begin to talk about how today's youth are drawn to franchises.  I would love to start on the bad acting.  But, then, I would have to get at the plot that was most likely stolen from the mind of some shallow teenager.  That would make me talk of how this is just a real expensive commercial for foreign car parts.  I just want to leave the people with one thing to say about the bad movie with a worse title.  The chicks are hot.
B00005JMEW|2.0|I cannot understand all the positive ratings. I watched the European dvd last night and have just two comments.<br />1. The Western actors tried to hard to make their studied Japanese lines sound like real Japanese. I speak Japanese myself, the intonation was off and some of the lines sounded ridiculous!<br />2. The fight scenes were miserable. Do I need to say more? They should have used Michelle Yeoh instead of Lucy Liu for example. Ballet and sword fighting are two totally different things.<br />Yes there were some nice scenes in this movie that why I give it two stars, but for me it was irritating most of the time.
B000089RVX|5.0|This cd is stunning. Amy Lee is so talented! Usually, on albums I hate at least one song. However, on this album I love every song. If you are thinking about buying this album, don't hesitate, try it!
B0000AM6LY|1.0|This has got to be, quite simply, one of the worst albums I've ever had the displeasure of hearing. Boring and utterly worthless garbage from a band (now a one-man band, anyway) who lost it a long, long time ago.<br />The better moments (and I use the term very loosely), such as 'Fake' are forgettable, run-of-the-mill pop. The rest is embarassing. Avoid like the plague.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I think even people who didn't like the show will admit it was an attempt at doing something new with the sci-fi genre.  This isn't about epic storyline, it's not about the people that changed the world, in other words: it's not Star Trek.<BR>A lot of people complain it's too overly western, personally I love the western theme, I think it makes sense to the show (maybe not the clothes, but the setting and the music at least).  The characters are well rounded, interesting and believable.  They interact as not only friends, but a family trying to get by.  Joss Whedon's clever and witty dialog runs throughout, as does that of many a Buffy and Angel writer.  <BR>I can't promise that you'll like Firefly but you should definatly rent it and give it a chance.
B00008EY9G|3.0|The movie seems better after it is finished and one can marvel at the clever &quot;inside&quot; jokes.  When first seen, however, much of the middle of the movie is ordinary horror film convention, with vague clues as to the reality of it all, only making sense when we see the ending.<br />Definitely a must for your action section in your dvd collection.  The actual ending will knock you out---it hits hard and fast in one  big time sequence.
0380725398|4.0|A few years ago someone suggested to me that I would enjoy the gothic writing style of Daphne DuMaurier. That, in itself, was a true statement, and Rebecca remains one of my favorite novels.<br />Recently I chose Jamaica Inn, after carrying around the weighty Atlas Shrugged for two months. At a scant 240 pages, this novel has a lot to accomplish in a short amount of time. <br />The death of Mary Yellan's mother, and a deathbed wish that she go to live with her Aunt Patience brings Mary to the much feared and maligned Jamaica Inn. Upon arrival Mary meets her Uncle Joss Merlyn, the landlord of Jamaica Inn, who lives up to every ugly scrap of reputation he has earned. A drunk; a bully; a spouse-abuser....Joss Merlyn is instantly disagreeable and unlikeable.<br />But Mary finds that Joss is much more than just ugly words. Meryln heads up a band of 'Wreckers' who lure ships to their doom with a false beacon, then murders the passengers and crew, and plunders the ship and sells off the goods. Horrified by this discovery, Mary struggles with her urge to flee Jamaica Inn, and her duty to protect her Aunt. <br />Mary also encounters Jem Merlyn, the n'er do well younger brother of Joss, and Francis Davey, the Vicar of Altarnun, in the near vicinity. Unsure of whether Jem is friend or foe, Mary finds herself drawn to him, and continually seeking out the aide of Vicar Davey.<br />But in the end, Mary's trust seems ill-placed, as the real head of the band of smugglers is revealed, murders and imprisonments occur, and the truth comes to light about the goings-on at Jamaica Inn.<br />Where this novel falls short, even without comparison to Rebecca; is in the brevity of the tale. With a sparse cast of characters; the end is in sight long before you turn the final page.  The gloom of the moors is touched upon, with afternoon walks surrounded by mist and foreign noises...late night escapes from impending danger, and the threat of cut-throat smugglers ever present...but the suspense of all these situations is short lived, as the story moves on....<br />Perhaps a little further fleshing-out of the gloom and doom would have added more enjoyment to the story; at least for me, as I have a great deal of affection for DuMaurier's ability to delivery dark, gothic foreboding and trepidation.<br />Nevertheless, the story moves along at an easy to follow rate, and is enjoyable.  Though I cannot give it a five star rating, I do recommend it to fans of DuMaurier.
B000127LW2|3.0|I'm sure I don't need to extoll the virtues of the ST Voyager Series, my fellow reviewers have done that more than adequetly, but what I must comment on is the absolute pi$$-poor packaging of this box set.<BR>A flimsy plastic sleeve with a poor man's digipack does not do this set justice, and for twice the price of Stargate box sets with have nice single tidy amray cases in a sturdy cardboard outer.<BR>I was jumping the gun on the Australian release when I purchased this and was happy to be a few months ahead of everyone else here, but now I'll wait for the Aussie release of Season 1 next month and pray the packaging is a jolly sight better, well it can't be any worse... :)
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|Well,I bet many APC fans are amazed with their beloved bands new CD, but in spite of I am a fan too I should say that this is a little, just a little bit more simple. I got their first cd and it is just impressive,majestic, emotional, you get into a strange world full of the Maynard James Keenan deep thoughts and feelings. The lyrics are as abstracts, poetic and originals as they were in the first cd. Althought they got now james Iha(Smashing pumkins)and Twiggy ramirez(Marilyn Manson), is not that impressive now. I really was waiting for another high-level experimental album, but this is kind of more simplistic and sometimes, and I hate to say it: boring. But anyways, it is a good album, and you should try it, probably you will like it.

6305754969|5.0|EL DORADO has a lot of good elements such as an interesting story, gripping suspense and above all excellent acting. Besides John Wayne in the role of a professional gunfighter and Robert Mitchum as the sheriff of El Dorado, the film has a strong supporting cast which includes James Caan, Charlene Holt, Paul Fix, Arthur Hunnicutt, Michele Carey and John Mitchum. The latter is the younger brother of Robert Mitchum. In this movie John plays a bartender. He has more than 200 movie and TV appearances to his credit as well as stints as a singer and song writer.<br />Robert Mitchum can play a drunk trying to cope with a hongover as well as anybody in movies. Howard Hawkes is best remembered for his direction of SERGEANT YORK.<br />I always thought that EL DORADO deserved a high rating even though it failed to receive any Oscar nominations in 1967. The Academy award competition in that year was dominated by BONNIE AND CLYDE, THE GRADUATE and IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT.
B00005JMSE|4.0|It's another comic book rendered into live action. On the whole, it's pretty good. The (...) are the bad guys, our flawed Hellboy is the hero, and he gets the hot female lead in the last scene. Yes, I said hot.<br />The pace is good, the attitude is bad (that's good), and the effects are good. The visual presentation helps move the story along. For example, almost the entire first sequence is bluish monochrome with two colored exceptions: Our Hero is red, and the Evil Babe's lipstick is red. That tells you who to watch. OK, it's not subtle, but this is a comic. I'll look elsewhere for subtlety.<br />(BTW, I've never read Hellboy comics. I probably won't start, even though I liked the movie. Lots of other comics are good, too, and my preferences lie in other directions.)<br />Maybe you like comics. Maybe you like action movies based on over-the-top characters. Maybe you want a flick that's exciting enough, but where people stay mostly dressed and the gore is kept under control. If so, the movie has a fair bit to offer. Go ahead, enjoy.
B00013PHGS|4.0|The chill-out gurus are back and at it again. The ones who delivered the soundtrack to Sophia Coppola's The Virgin Suicides took a dip after their colossal album Moon Safari. However, they are back in shape for Talkie Walkie, which sees the French duo revisit the subtler musical tastes that made them so popular. The lead single &quot;Cherry Blossom Girl&quot; is a perfect track. At some points the disc does lag, but that only comes with the territory of being of the chill-out genre. <BR>The whistling tune &quot;Alpha Beta Gaga&quot; is treat. Air are superior when they combine delicate vocals with roving melodies. The key to appreciating Air's music is to give their art to manifest itself on you. When that happens the music will be your friend for life. <BR>&quot;Surfing On A Rocket&quot; has a summery feel, while &quot;Universal Traveler&quot; flows in arrangement. &quot;Alone In Kyoto&quot; captures loneliness in a way unlike any other. <BR>Air have been the pioneers of the chill-out genre and they continue to develop into the mastermind behind it with Talkie Walkie.

B00005MAM2|3.0|I just saw the movie for the first time last night and was seeing the movie in my sleep. Not something you should watch at 1:49 in the morning for the first time.<br />Anyway the version I watch wasn't the Special Edition version but the orginal DVD version that was dubbed onto DVD. I loved the way it started off as far as the plot is concerned but there was no time for character devleopment. However the fight scenes where great as well as the main characters attitude Kenda. He kept the movie going. I could tell that he is a pretty boy in school for the fact that he wears a pink shirt and no one talks about him.<br />The best scene in the movie in my opinion was the fight between Kenda and Takosi (sp? on both) at the military base.<br />The ending left me saying WTF, just because of the simple fact was that was the point that I got lost on. Where he turned into a huge monster and Kenda getting sucked in with him is what made the movie loose a few points in my book.<br />Its not as good as everyone says it is in my opinion but it is a good Anime none the less. I recommend seeing it once but you have to pay attention or you will bound to get lost. This movie is more for the SC-Fi fans of Anime
B0001IN07Q|5.0|Loved everything about this new c.d. d.v.d. It was a surprise to also get a c.d. with this new release.  Thought is was just a d.v.d. for the very resonable price.  Loved it so much can't seem to watch it enough. A wonderful insight into the life behind the scenes of a remarkable talent and new legend in the making.   Can't say enough good things about it.  I highly recommend this to all.

0226039331|3.0|Danker brings tremendous industry and learning to this new edition of what is, without question, the ultimate lexicon of New Testament Greek in English.  Since so many other reviews appraise the (very great) absolute value of the 3rd edition, I feel that it's appropriate to sound a cautionary note about whether the 3rd edition really shines that much relative to the 2nd edition.  (...)<br />In short, the 2nd edition is a monument of scholarship, a rock of scholarly solidity and clarity that has not been suddenly rendered obsolete.  One's enthusiasm for shelling out for the 3rd edition is a bit dampened when you consider several issues:<br />(...)To conclude, there is obviously an audience who needs to have the absolute most current edition: namely, scholars who are going to follow up all the references in the bibliography, who need to have the published record (the 3rd edition) of every iota of deepened reflection reached by Danker.  But the 2nd edition is not just a book now useful only to \\"unscholarly\\" readers.  It was published in 1979, making use of Qumran material, etc., and it continues to offer its users a lucid and authoritative account of the NT lexicon.<br />I am not a NT specialist, but a Classics professor.  I think my demands for quality philological information with which to read the NT are pretty high.  The 2nd edition meets them to my satisfaction.  I'd not be distressed to have only the 3rd edition--on the whole, its advantages outweigh its annoyances--but there is certainly not $50 worth of difference in the value of these editions.

0385504209|1.0|This has all the makings of a bestseller (mystery, conspiracy, murder, romance), but the quality of the writing handicaps this book.<br />Although Brown obviously scoured books and other sources to piece together his plot, he ought to have put the same effort into studying the general layout of Paris and the psychology of her people. Although it might look great in a movie, it's not physically possible to drive into the Tuileries Gardens from the direction the hero, Langdon, did in Chapter 4 (It's ringed by a twelve-foot wall on that side; there are switchback steps of course, but....).<br />I am also unsure of why the DCPJ officer who drove Langdon from the Ritz to the Louvre left the hotel (located in Place Vendome) drove past Opera Garnier and then back through Vendome before actually heading toward the Louvre. And during Langdon's and Sophie's escape from the Louvre in Chapters 32 and 33, they might have saved an awful lot of time and actually made it to the Embassy before the DCPJ officers if they had just driven straight down rue de Rivoli (which becomes avenue Gabriel at the same exact place where the Embassy is located)...and when Sophie &quot;cuts sharply past the luxurious Hotel de Crillon,&quot; had she looked to her left, she might have seen the Embassy just on the other side of the (very small) street, a whole lot closer than &quot;less than a mile away.&quot; (Brown is also not quite up with the times; it took several references to a &quot;rotary&quot; before I realized he was talking about a &quot;roundabout&quot; and the heroine's &quot;SmartCar&quot; is generally referred to as a &quot;Smart.&quot;) There are many symbols of France, and to a symbologist, perhaps, the Eiffel Tower would reign supreme, but not in the opinion of the general Frenchman-in-the-street.<br />As far as Brown's general writing, I kept forgetting that Sophie was French, because her dialogue was written in American vernacular, and I had trouble imagining that Langdon felt anything more than brotherly toward her (her patronized her, he protected her, he educated her...hmmm, strange chauvanistic behaviour for a believer in the sacred goddess...but he never seemed to truly be attracted to her.)The protaganist, Robert Langdon, &quot;senses&quot; things at least twenty times in the first 100 pages when Brown should have been more precise, allowing his character to see, hear, guess, assume, deduct or even *know* those very same things.<br />As other people have mentioned, the (non)religious aspects of this book are rehashed, centuries-old heresies and conspiracies, but I wouldn't have minded so much if I hadn't wasted my time reading such a poorly edited book. I wonder how many unpublished authors with outstanding manuscripts were turned down so that Doubleday could pour money into marketing &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot;?<br />Skip this book.<br />If you're interested in the Holy Grail, the sacred goddess, or any of the other fringe religion aspects of this book, you could find the information much more quickly by doing a search on the internet...and it would probably be a better read.ything more than brotherly toward her (her patronized her, he protected her, he educated her...hmmm, strange chauvanistic behaviour for a believer in the sacred goddess...but he never seemed to truly be attracted to her.)The protaganist, Robert Langdon, &quot;senses&quot; things at least twenty times in the first 100 pages when Brown should have been more precise, allowing his character to see, hear, guess, assume, deduct or even *know* those very same things.<br />As other people have mentioned, the (non)religious aspects of this book are rehashed, centuries-old heresies and conspiracies, but I wouldn't have minded so much if I hadn't wasted my time reading such a poorly edited book.

B0001UZZWW|5.0|This review/comment is strictly for the 3-D disc. From the information I've read on the web, this disc appears to be the movie that is used for the Shrek 4-D attraction at Universal Studios. And if it is, I could not be happier! When I visited Universal Orlando this past October (2003) I went to see this attraction 4 times. It is simply great. The story and quality of animation is as good as the original feature, and the 3D in the theater was clear and the best of anything 3-D I've seen. Hopefully the 3-D will translate to TV well, but even if it doesn't there will be a standard version as well.<br />Too bad we don't get the preshow for the Universal attraction as it includes some background information as well as lead-up to the short movie itself. Oh well, I have my home video for that. (...)<br />If you enjoy Shrek, I would highly recommend getting this disc. It carries the story directly from the last frame of the original Shrek, and has some information that leads up to Shrek 2.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|Muse's first album, Showbiz, may have sounded a bit Radioheadesque, but their second album, Origin of Symmetry, was a major departure from that sound.  Their third album, Absolution, is truly a work they can identify as being all their own.  Muse produce music that is far beyond anything Radiohead could and has ever produced.  Muse are far more musically complex than Radiohead choosing to interlace different instruments beyond a simple threepiece (Blackout, Endlessly, and Ruled by Secrecy) while creating elaborate melodies that have become a trademark of the band since their first album.  Furthermore, Matt Bellamy actually sings as opposed to the man he is continually accused of immitating--Thom Yorke.  Thom Yorke is guilty of moaning, groaning, mumbling, and fumbling lyrics through Radiohead's monotonous soundscapes of blithering crap.  Matt Bellamy, on the other hand is not only easy to understand, but he sings with full intent, full emotion, and full force.    Bellamy's range covers ends that Yorke never could, and using his magnificent falsetto, expresses with clarity what he wants listeners to experience.  Ultimately listeners are in for a treat that will delight their auditory senses and send shivers down their spine.  Muse are a band like none other, and Absolution is a wonderful 3rd album that shows just how much they have grown over the years.  Absolution demosntrates clearly how far apart Muse are from mainstream music.  Any critic guilty of comparing them to Radiohead, or claiming they are Radiohead immitators not only lack the ability to appreciate good music when it bites them in the ass, but are guilty of poor taste (and should consequently be shot).
B000002GVO|4.0|While a great album, you wouldn't know it by reading some of the previous reviews. <br />Hotel California - most people who hear the first few seconds of the intro instantly know the song, and it's a classic. If you're going to quote the lyrics, listen to album first.  It's &quot;You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave.&quot;  <br />The remainder of side one is as listenable as any album ever recorded - New Kid in Town, Life in the Fast Lane and Wasted Time, which is one of the best songs on the album, not one of the worst.<br />Side two is a little tougher to get through, as Victim of Love and Pretty Maids All in a Row are weak, but The Last Resort - a typical Don Henley classic, is a fantastic finish.  Altogether a great album.  4-stars because of the brief slump on side 2.
B00005JMSE|4.0|From all of the recent movies that are based on comic books (Spiderman, Hulk, etc.) this one is the best. What makes it different is not special effects (which are great) and action (which is plenty) but rather the atmosphere created by director Guillermo Del Toro and the humor. It would be very easy to take the plot about a mutant from hell that was found as a child by the government (oh, and his father was Rasputin) and who later becomes a fighter against al dthe evil forces, and to make from this a cheesy production. The movie avoids such pitfalls.  It is serious just enough to keep us watching. There are quite a few skips in the plot but it's based on comics after all and we either don't pay attention or excuse the movie for this.
B0000DJZA5|2.0|I recently listened to the original Let It Be (1970) on vinyl, and this version (2003) on CD, back-to-back.  To me there is just no comparison.  The original is easily more satisfying.  I think it's even better than Abbey Road.
0440238609|5.0|Many have characterized this book as an 'atheist' tract. That is nonsense. Atheism denies the existence of God, whereas God certainly exists in the book. Of course, he is portraid as an impostor who, by trying to hide his imposture, becomes the root of all that is evil. But that does not make the book atheist; we can call it 'demiurgic'. We can also call it 'luciferic' ('satanic' is a bit too harsh) because we are supposed to cheer for those who rebel against God and end up killing Him. <br />So top marks to Pullman for courage. Writing such a book, especially for a children/teenager audience, is an impossibly dangerous taks, yet he achieved a fantastic commercial and critical success. Good for him!<br />I appreciated many things about the book, most of them previously pointed out by other reviewers -- hence the 5 stars.<br />There are also many things I didn't like about the book. A work of such scope is bound to have many holes and raise many questions, I understand that. But I consider this a major question which should have been dealt with: what is the relation between the Authority and the Church? This is important for two big reasons. <br />First, if the Church is a genuine representative of the Authority then it cannot be blamed for its actions in trying to protect and preserve the Authority. The actions of the Church, even though harsh at times, would be justified. Just like Lord Asriel's killing of Roger is justified by his bigger mission. If the Authority himself is evil, then the Church is, or may be,  as much a victim of manipulation as anyone else. <br />Second, if the Church is not a genuine agent of the Authority then killing the Authority is pointless. Killing the Authority did not even stop the leaking of Dust anyway; in fact the leaking of Dust was caused ultimately by the war against Him: by the Knife and by the Church's bomb. After Lyra's return to Oxford the Church is still in power, but some vague reforms are brewing. But the Authority is dead,so the Church had become illegitimate. A weird situation.<br />I think this question, of the relationship between God and Church, is so big that another book is required to sort it out. In fact, by going gnostic rather than atheistic, Pullman gets himself into a bit of a difficult position because he accepts the main claim of the Church as the representative of God on earth. I'm curious how this will work out.<br />Finally, I didn't care much for the mystic romance between Lyra and Will. Romantic love seems to be becoming the official religion of the 21st century, with all the ensuing nonsense. If one is rational enough to dismiss all religion as a mistake based on fear and prejudice rooted in tradition, why not dismiss romantic love as jealosy and infatuation triggered by raging hormones?

B00008LDPU|1.0|Basically a disposable collection of short-stories somewhat related to the Matrix, this set of animation segments is uninteresting and empty. The animation is good for the most part, but the characters and storylines are far from engaging. This is just as useless and unecessary as the Matrix sequels, offering promising ideas yet failing to develop them properly. Aside from some impressive visuals and music, &quot;The Animatrix&quot; is nothing more than another product to seduce fanboys who still care about this disappointing trilogy. To the others (like me), this release is unconvincing and tiresome.<br />Junk cinema.
B000002UAX|3.0|This 1968 release has some great tracks: Back in the USSR, Dear Prudence, Birthday, Revolution, Yer Blues...and others.  But there are a number of reasons that it isn't a five star album, including ObLaDi, Rocky Racoon, Savoy Truffle, Bungalow Bill, Wild Honey Pie, and the one song that best describes the album - Long, Long, Long.  There are 10 great songs on here, but it's one good song, then two mediocre songs throughout the album.
0780628551|3.0|Good acting from Depp &amp; Theron (an interesting pairing that could work in a different film) can't save this predictable thriller that relies heavily on overwrought suspension of disbelief.  Is it the writing or the direction?  Hmmm...I think it's more of a case of, &quot;Hey...let's try and make an alien version of ROSEMARY'S BABY.&quot;  Polanski did it first and he did it better, and no Mia Farrow haircut can help Theron (who is burdened with nearly every scene in the movie) out of this jam.  In a different era, this would have been a great DRIVE IN movie.
0446310786|5.0|Rarely am I facinated by court stories. They usually bore me and I can never follow them. But with this story, you got so familiar with all the characters that you can't help but get sucked into the story and pay cloes attention. This book made me nervous, made me scared, upset, most everything. It's one of the best classic books I've ever read.
0375432302|4.0|I looked at this book as purely a piece of fiction to enjoy. It doesnt matter to me if there are facts present in this book or not. They never mattered anyway ;-) I found the book fast-paced and very exciting for the first half. It was almost like a roller coaster ride. You do pause sometimes to think whether the author is quoting a fact or just cooking something up at times. The search for the Holy Grail kept me engrossed till the end and when I finally got through the final pages, it left me a little dissapointed with the end .. but at the same time I give credit to the author that he actually built that momentum and expectation. Its quite an enjoyable piece of fiction ... it wont dissapoint u if you prefer to just let it be what it is.
B00005JM02|5.0|What a pleasure. A gripping story, characters you care about and beautiful visuals. One slight word of warning for those with sensitive children (e.g. kids who got very upset when Simba's dad dies in the Lion King) might find a couple of scenes a little scary (a shark chase and a chase by an angler fish). Pixar firing on all cylinders.
B00005T7HG|4.0|One of the interesting sidelights to this movie is the fact that Oliver Stone wrote part of the screenplay.  While watching it I kept wondering what part?  Stone, whose edgy, over the top indictments of oppression, corruption and especially military stupidity, wouldn't seem to be one to celebrate the elevation of Eva Peron to something close to sainthood, which is what this movie does.  Maybe all his work ended up on the cutting room floor.  Or maybe it was obscured by Andrew Lloyd Webber's music.  Certainly we do not see the decamisados (Peron's version of his friend Mussolini's Blackshirts) torturing anyone, and although the \\"disappeared\\" are mentioned in passing, there is no retrospective that allows us to see just how widespread and horrific were the murders committed by the Peronists.<br />Anyway, Madonna, who certainly fits the part like a glove, stars as Evita, and she gives the performance of her life.  Yet somehow it is unconvincing, or I should say, somehow the film doesn't really get to the essence of the woman who rose from poverty to the pinnacle of power in Argentina, a woman extravagantly loved by the common people of Argentina even while she was a party to the fascist oppression.  I don't think this is Madonna's fault. Her voice is good, not great, of course, but her dramatic skills are very much in evidence, skills that have always been underrated, although I'm not sure why. If you watch her in this and in Desperately Seeking Susan (1985) you can see that she has a range easily exceeding that of most actresses.  I think that ironically it is the very quality of common origin and common appeal that the Argentines so loved in Evita that the critics hold against Madonna.<br />Antonio Banderas plays Che, who narrates and attempts to objectify the events while symbolizing both Evita's alter-ego and the man who would really be her proper mate were it not for her rapacious political appetite.  Che's character and his dramatic role (from the play by Tim Rice) is perhaps the most important artistic achievement of the musical after Webber's beautiful and inspiring music.  Banderas is winning and enormously vivid in the part, and he sings well and expressively.<br />Jonathan Pryce plays Peron with more dignity and humanity than history might allow.  His sensitivity as an actor combined with a modest demeanor seemed to me so unrealistic as to be almost a miscasting.  Yet he is perhaps as compelling as anyone on the screen and he certainly looked the part.  Interesting is Jimmy Nail as the cabaret singer Magaldi.  He combines sleazy good looks with a kind of vulnerable persona that seems exactly right.<br />Well, what can be said about the music except that it is one of Webber's great triumphs and so very typical of his work.  It is beautiful, stirring, moving, enchanting and memorable.  Who can forget the haunting, plaintive refrain of \\"Don't Cry for Me, Argentina\\" or the gorgeous simplicity of \\"You Must Love Me\\"?  While Madonna's voice would not fill up a concert hall or take her by itself to the Broadway stage, she does an outstanding job with Webber's songs.  A natural performer (Madonna's key talent), her expressive interpretations range from the ordinary to the transfixing.  I very much enjoyed her efforts and predict that critics in the future will be kinder to her than today's critics.<br />The ending seemed too drawn out and then when the screen faded to black and the credits began to run it seemed almost abrupt and without resolution.  I also did not like the way that Madonna (38 at the time) seemed no younger in the earlier scenes with her hair dyed pitch black.  I think director Alan Parker should have given us more of an illusion of youth, perhaps spared her some of the closeups and fuzzed out the lines under her eyes. Strange how the golden blonde hair and exquisitely applied makeup in the remainder of the film made her look younger.  All directors should know what Madonna learned many years ago: blonde hairusually makes a woman look younger because those with naturally light-colored hair are their blondest as children.  Like big eyes and relatively big heads, blonde hair is a signal of youth that arrests our eyes.<br />Despite the flaws this is an engrossing cinematic experience, and for Madonna fans, Banderas fans, and in particular fans of Andrew Lloyd Webber, it is a film not to be missed.usually makes a woman look younger because those with naturally light-colored hair are their blondest as children.

0679428895|2.0|From the pedestrian dialogue to the adequate prose, Harris attaches lots of research. But there's a reason he opens each chapter with quotes from texts on volcanoes. He's too inadequate an author to incorporate this material into the actual text. No Leon Uris he! All the characters are cardboard with the possible exception of Pliny, but Pliny's views as expressed here on sexuality do not seem bona fide. Additionally, the hero's behavior and thoughts are inconsistent. A better writer would have used this book as an outline for a much richer work. The basics are here, but  little else. Don't be surprised to find yourself skimming towards the end.
0385504209|1.0|I have found that in religious discussions, people tend to believe what they want to believe.  Having once been one who looked at Bible-believing Christians with amused contempt, I know that was true for me.  I am grateful I took coursework on the history of Christianity at a time in life when I had an open-mind.  It actually stimulated my faith, partly because I was able to approach the subject without the blinders of hatred for Christians or anti-intellectual religious doctrine.<br />That said, Dan Brown's book is a perfect example of how to take advantage of widespread biblical and historical illiteracy in our society.  It is an Oliver Stone approach to biblical history.<br />So much of this book shows a general ignorance of core Christian texts and of the history of Christianity.  Brown's characterization of conspiracies within the early church<br />could only be believed by someone with no knowledge of how the early church started, or its theology, or the persecutions it faced in the first 300 years.  Brown even gets basic chronologies wrong.<br />This is a work that will play well to nominal catholics who resented their upbringing and never truly chose nor understood the Bible or its teachings.  Those are the types who feel the need to respond to a mythical early church as if it were filled with conspiracies and overpowering hierarchy.  But those who have read a little history and a little Bible will find this to be a work as laughable as Howard Dean's assertion that his favorite book of the New Testament is &quot;Job.&quot;  When you acquaint yourself with the humility, the purity, the conviction and the spiritual maturity of the earlier Christians, you'll be embarassed you ever fell for this garbage, and you may look at the apostles and the latter-day descendants of that movement (ie. evangelical Christians) in a whole new light.<br />If you want a real book on this time period, get the multi-volumed set on the &quot;Rise and Fall of the Roman Empire.&quot;  You'll be acquainted with historical facts, not sophomoric tripe.  It is still the seminal work on the history of Rome and of the rise of the Christian movement.  You'll learn historical fact, rather than filling your head with irrational prejudice and conspiratorial thinking from a third-rate author like Dan Brown.<br />Ben in Derwoodt;  You'll be acquainted with historical facts, not sophomoric tripe.

B00000J048|5.0|My 2 year old son was first introduced to this toy at our Montessori class...he was hooked immediately!!!  It was easy for him to figure out how to put the pieces together and attach the gears (he loved being able to do all of this himself as opposed to other gear toys where most of the building is already done for you) He sat and happily played with this fantastic toy for almost an hour before we had to leave.  The learning possibilities of this toy are immmense as is the \\"fun value\\".  With no \\"bells and whistles\\" this toy ranks very high on our list of toys due to the fact that our son has complete creative control...it's all up to him.  All in all, it's a fantastic toy that we highly recomend.

1577311523|5.0|Eckhart Tolle brings us all powerful and transformative insight to shed the layers of ego that have your mind clinging to either the past or the future, seeking or reminiscing, longing or avoiding, and in its place, bringing you into THIS moment - in the here and now, where ALL reality exists, and gives you the power to change any aspect of your life from this moment, which is where all change comes from.<br /><br />Surrendering to the now is a fearful process because the domain of the ego is the past, and the emotion of the ego is fear. Love, on the other hand, exists now. One of the most powerful parts of this book teaches you to \\"become the watcher\\" of your thoughts. Just step aside and NOTICE what is going through your mind. Once you notice it, you can then be objective about it, rather than be consumed with fear, doubt, anxiety, worry, or anticipation.<br /><br />This book is a gift to humanity, a classic, and will bring you more conscious awareness of yourself, the dramas (the ego loves drama) and how to rise above it all by pulling yourself deeply into the present moment, fully. I HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone who has much to work through emotionally, because it will teach you exactly how to move beyond pain and suffering, so you can create and live joyfully in the present.<br /><br />Barbara Rose, author of \\"Stop Being the String Along: A Relationship Guide to Being THE ONE\\" and 'If God Was Like Man'<br />Editor of inspire! magazine
B0001HAHXW|2.0|With all the hoolpa this cd has received, one is atonsihed by the absolute nonsense of some of the rock critics who rave about this.  Much of this collection of performances of songs that Robert Johnson recorded is on the level of a bar band doing Robert Johnson. None of Clapton's renditions of these songs match those by Robert Lockwood, Johnny Shines, Honeyboy Edwards, Big Joe Williams, Junior Wells, Eddie Taylor, Boyd Gilmore, Muddy Waters and others who have taken Johnson's songs and produced recordings that are more passionately and personally performed.  Clapton is too reverent to these songs and the lyrics which is strange for a homage to Johnson whose own work adapted and transformed his contemporaries music as Elijah Wald details in his recent book. Check out Leroy Carr's In the Evening before listening to Robert Johnson's Love in Vain and Clapton's rendition pales compared to the Stones' cover of it three decades ago.  Both Junior Wells and Eddie Taylor had standout recordings of Stop Breakin' Down that makes Clapton's rendition here sound not very distinguished.  Call Clapton a rock guitar god all you want and a great popularizer of the blues, but when you have assimilated not simply Johnson's music but also the great bluesmen of the past fifty years, than Clapton's achievement is clearly overstated.   One other point was that I was not enamored by the studio band. There are some great players (and Mr. Portnoy is a great harp player), but the rhythm section does not swing and they sound second rate comapred to some of the classic Chicago bands of the sixties and seventies.

B0001MDQ2G|5.0|WOW. That's all I can say after soaking in a few listens of Orphaned Land's Mabool. This has to be one of the greatest progressive metal albums of all time. Superior songwriting, awesome musicianship, and a very well-produced sound that is all their own. This basically unknown band, hailing from war-torn Israel, really took me by surprise. I had read a few raving reviews on various metal websites so I took my chances and bought Mabool right here off Amazon. It was one of the wisest purchases I have ever made.<br />Now, just 5 or 6 listens in, I can tell that this album will stand the test of time. It is all over the place in terms of musical styles and tempos, and not a single opportunity for the listener to get bored. One minute they're thrashing out some progressive Children of Bodom-ish riffs with harsh vocals and the next minute some chick is vocalizing these spine-chilling middle-eastern folk melodies with nothing but a piano, acoustical string instrument, or a chanting choir accompanying her. I normally don't care much for the growling vocals, but on Mabool they are used sparingly (briefly in about 3 or 4 songs) and only in context to what's going on in the story. (Oh, did I mention that this is a concept album as well?) <br />The production on Mabool is beyond reproach. Considering the amount of instruments and various vocal tracks, everything is mixed almost to perfection. All elements of this roller coaster ride of music are seamlessly blended together giving the listener a true &quot;departure from reality&quot;. This is not background music, this is a soundscape that must be embraced by the listener. You must lose yourself it in Mabool, which is very easy to do even from the very first listen. It's that damn good.<br />I highly suggest doing a search for Orphaned Land on the internet, you'll find further reviews and even a complete song available to download from their American distributor, Century Media. This is an album that truly crosses genre boundaries, pleasing fans from Children of Bodom-ites, to Savaholics to (Dream) Theatre-heads.<br />Really, I can't recommend this album enough. It is truly a work of art.

B000002MFQ|1.0|OK - I started reading the reviews for this and I just had to step in and offer my two cents.  First of all, I loved the original Tubular Bells - I listened to it compulsively, repeatedly for about a full year.  One day I saw Tubular Bells II in the record store and I thought, &quot;How bad can it be?&quot;  Seems like every time I say those words to myself, FATE smacks me down, as if to teach me the lesson: &quot;It can worse than you can possibly imagine.&quot;  <br />If I were to describe my feelings listening to this CD in one word, it would be &quot;embarrassment&quot;.  I was actually embarrassed for Mike Oldfield.  The music is basically a remake of Tubular Bells - only &quot;modernized&quot; for MTV fed, low-attention-span simpletons deemed to have no capacity for musical depth or melodic progression.  Then again, I can't imagine WHAT audience they were targeting with this thing.  All the mood, creativity, inspiration and FEELING of the original has been stripped away, leaving a hollow, pointless collection songs that add nothing to the music.  And when it came to the &quot;Piltdown Man&quot; section, I could actually, literally, feel my face flushing with embarrassment.  In all my years of listening to music, I have never quite had this experience.  <br />If Tubular Bells were not such a masterpiece, this CD would be forgivable.  Tubular Bells II, however, is not only an insult to the listener, it is an insult to the work of art that is the original (as well as a transparent attempt to capitalize on the original).<br />I'm sorry Mike - I had to say it.  I'm a big fan, but I beg you, please leave Tubular Bells alone.  A masterpiece, by it's very definition, needs no improvement, or &quot;re-envisioning&quot; or whatever you want to call it.

B0001DI0FI|3.0|The story of a ship's captain who battles an almost phantom-like enemy, while dealing with a crew that is both gallant and superstitious. The captain is extraordinarily gifted, with great insight into his foe and great skills in navigation and ability to read the enemy's mind. His closest friend on the ship is the ship's doctor. The enemy is finally defeated when the captain devises a ruse that makes the enemy think the captain's ship is defenseless. I love this movie. Unfortunately, I'm talking about \\"The Enemy Below\\" with Robert Mitchum and Kurt Jurgens. Set in WWII, with Mitchum as the captain, the movie was so closely copied by \\"Master and Commander\\" that there are scenes followed shot-for-shot.  As if that kind of outright theft wasn't enough, the movie also steals from a television episode that also stole from \\"Enemy Below\\":  Star Trek's 'Balance of Terror\\" which is the story of a ship's captain who battles an almost phantom-like enemy, while dealing with a crew that is both gallant and superstitious. The captain is extraordinarily gifted, with great insight into his foe and has great skills of navigation and ability to read the enemy's mind. His closest friend on the ship is the ship's doctor, Bones. The enemy is finally defeated when the captain devises a ruse that makes the enemy think the captain's ship is defenseless. 'Master and Commander' is a fine film, I only wish it wasn't so completely derivative.

0440224764|5.0|The Partner.  John Grisham.  NYC, New York: Bantam Dell, February 1997, 468 pages.<br /> Have you ever watched a movie or read a book where the bad guy is who the audience is rooting for?  Usually the audience is supportive towards the good guy, however in John Grisham's recent novel, The Partner, the audience is persuaded into cheering for the opposition.  This book takes a story and tells it more from a criminal's perspective.  In a twisted sort-of way I felt a sort of sympathy for this thief and was actually on his side throughout the plot.  For a book to be able to do that to its reader, it is obviously well written, and thoroughly thought out.  On top of this, I found the book to be surprisingly suspenseful, with quite a few twists and a surprise ending.  All that in one novel is a perfect combination in for a great read.<br />The author made several points throughout the storyline.  One being, the simple question of can you really trust a person?  Another point Grisham made in his writing was showing that it is possible for love to be broken by greed, especially if it is planned the entire course of the relationship.  These points basically sum up to the fact that you cannot always trust people with large sums of untraceable money.<br />The book achieved its goal and went far beyond any expectations.  It had all of the essential elements and threw in some extras for good measure.  One possibility suggested by the book was that you can get away with a lot of bad things if you plan carefully, however if your plans include the use of other people you probably want to reconsider.  There was very little left out in the book, however I felt it would have been nice to have an afterward which talks about what happened to the main characters.  Mainly because, in this books case you do wonder after reading it what happened to everyone.  This book is hard to compare with others with a similar subject mainly because there are not many books with the same viewpoint.  However, there is one book I recall reading for a past assignment called Crime and Punishment, which was also from a criminal's viewpoint.  In comparison I feel that Grisham's book was better at getting the reader on the criminal's side, however in opposition the other book gave a deeper sense of a criminal.  This is because the story took its reader inside the criminal's mind and thoughts, which had more of an effect.  To me the book was entirely convincing and actually more realistic than most other books today.<br />Overall, the book was refreshing to read because, it came from an interesting perspective and is far away from your typical good vs. bad story.  The suspense and twists keep you guessing until the very end.  In my opinion this was a great read and I would recommend it to people who like a suspensefully written surprise thriller of a book., there is one book I recall reading for a past assignment called Crime and Punishment, which was also from a criminal's viewpoint.

B00005JKHN|5.0|&quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; is one of the first Disney films I remember watching; I was 3 or 4 I think. We used to rent the video in the late 80s one time after another (it wasn't available for sale back then). But then, I started collecting Disney movies and by the time I was 11, &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; was a faded memory, and though very young the last time I saw it, I was so struck by it, that I could remember a few details from it (such as the &quot;Once Upon A Dream&quot; sequence and the dragon fight). Then, in 1995, Disney rereleased it to theatres and one can only imagine how excited I was to watch it again. I can never describe the feeling I had while watching it. Everything just looked and sounded so familiar, as if I never stopped watching it. I eagerly awaited for the January (1996) video release. The tape never left my VCR. I watched the film night and day for a year, seriously. Everything about this film is so magnificent: the animation is stunningly detailed, the music is magical and the characters are highly appealing. To this day, &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; remains one of my favorite Disney films ever. It holds childhood memories of mine and the beauty of all that's Disney.
0613173503|5.0|Ok. 100 kids. 1 race. 1 survivor. 99 corpses. The Long Walk.<BR>      This is the story of a boy(wow) named Ray Garrety. Garrety along with 99 other teen/adults make the insane decision of participating in the Long Walk. If you don't know what the Long Walk is, it is an annual race from Maine to New Hampshire. There are as I said 100 competitors. They must maintain a pace of over 4 miles per hour or else you receive a warning. You get 3 warnings. If you get one more warning then they kill you on the spot. <BR>      The whole 370 pages is the whole race. At first I was a little disappointed by that. Well, actually it is more than kids walking, but it is about kids bonding together. It is a story of sacrifice and friendship and death(there's Bachman for you).<BR>      If there is a flaw in the novel then it would be the absolutely bizarre ending which I did not understand(so sue me). Other than this Bachman's writing was amazing. We sometimes hear about good books where we are actually next to the characters and expieriencing them, but in the Walk we go inside of their MINDS!!<BR>      I was Ray myself. It felt like I was playing a video game and I was in control of Ray. We not only communicated with Ray but with all the other Walkers. Each time a Walker is shot it made me cringe especially if it was a Walker that King made us bond with for a while. This book is not an average King book where we get spooks and it is very action packed(IT, Shining,Stand), but rather like the Green Mile. I make the comparison because most of the time in the Green Mile everyone is in the Prison. In fact there is only one time when they leave Prison. In the Green Mile it is much like the Long Walk for the fact that King makes us bond a LOT with everyone.<BR>      I read this book starting from 8oclock in the morn and finished it on the same day at 430pm. I don't do that a lot with books. I only read Cujo and the Mile in one day. That fact should tell you that this book is pretty good.<BR>Enjoy!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00005J6UP|5.0|By far the greatest film of all time and the dvd quality is unbelievable.
0385336810|3.0|\\"Can You Keep a Secret?\\"<br />I'll grant you it was a fast read, but there was something missing.  Chick Lit or Contemporary fiction it is suppose to be a romance.  I loved Jack Harper though I couldn't buy him remembering everything Emma liked or disliked.  <br />I just wish Ms Kinsella wasn't afraid to write the love scenes.  In one scene you get to the bedroom Jack locks the door, drags Emma to the floor and zip.  This isn't the 1970's (...)  I don't know about anyone else and can only speak for myself, but I'm glad this was a library book because I would have been miffed if I had shelled out $21.95 for this hard cover.  <br />We watched Emma's character grow and stand up for herself and Ms Kinsella made her usurper cousin nasty.  I couldn't wait until Emma gave her the truth.  <br />I would love to see a sequel because Jack has some making up to do.  Its just I was waiting for the love scene to progress.  Please, please, please continue to write but since I live vicariously through romances, I need the love scenes.  I think Emma and Jack could really set the company on fire especially with grandpa's help.
B00005JMEW|5.0|I feel this movie was beautiful, and as one person put it, Visually Orgasmic.  With the fast switch between bright colors to black and white, to even the music with the amazing fight scenes.  As I read other reviewers comments, I find some people are just as cynical as they are ignorant.  The abstract integrated within the film and the multiple temples of different cultures intertwined with one another...well...it was just amzing.  If you are a person who enjoys generic and mold-fitting action movies, well maybe you shouldnt see the movie, and I think it will help save others from reading your ignorant comments.  This movie is 5 out of 5, just like every other Quentin movie.  He is a genius
055357342X|5.0|Well, here's a day to remember.  My universe has been shuffled.  For years, I have held that the rank of masters in the pantheon of imaginative fiction was 1) Peake, 2) Tolkein, and 3) Herbert.  Perhaps I should give this some time, but after finishing Swords I now feel it to be Peake, Martin, Tolkein and Herbert.  That's heady stuff, George.  Keep up the amazing work!
B00005JLYW|1.0|I didn't come to this movie with high expectations. I expected crazy fight scenes, a bad plot, no character development, and was expecting a lot of pretty woman. I was disappointed with almost everything.<br />The fight scenes were ridiculous. At least make them a little believable. There is no way they can do Matrix like jumps and kicks. The fact they never reload and miss is also stupid.<br />The plot is so lame anybody could follow it. Demi Moore plays a renegade angel who is out for payback. The only good thing about Demi was how incredible she looked to be 40+ years old.<br />I was disappointed with Cameron Diaz, Lucy Liu, and Drew Barrymore. All are pretty woman and none of them did anything for me in this movie. I usually like most of them but they were all horrible.<br />What was up with switching Bernie Mac and Bill Murray. What ever producer made that move made a big mistake. He was the best thing in the first movie.<br />This is a lame movie. I'm glad I rented it instead of buying it.<br />The special features aren't all that great at all and I don't really see why this got an Unrated version. There is nothing that would have changed the PG-13 rating. Don't waste your money on this.
B00005JMCW|5.0|This is an extremly sweet and cute movie. It's a movie that leaves you feeling really good inside. It's warm, comforting, funny, crazy, beautiful....<br />Jamiee Lee Curtis is amazing in it. She is simply amazing, acting as a person who got switched with her 15 year old teenage daughter! Her facial ezpressions, her &quot;ewww's&quot; and attitude is great to watch. It's my first time seeing a Lindsay Lohan movie, and I am impressed by this pretty young red-head. She was the perfectly stiff, middle aged woman trying to realise that the teen life is grueling after all.<br /> I lovded this, also the Bonus Features are great. behind the scenes and deleted scenes, are a real glimpse into how everything's done.
0385504209|5.0|I liked this book very much. It gives good details about the art.I am not commenting from religious perspective.
B0001HAHXW|3.0|EC, contributer Andrea kind of stripped all the gooey cliches away, and came right out and commented - correctly -  that you're just making a down payment on a retirement condo or something.  I just wish you'd taken on Robert Johnson about 30 years earlier, and I am ecstatic to see that you're working with Billy Preston, but....I dunno, it's just difficult to take you seriously anymore after that crap you did with &quot;Babyface&quot; for the Revolta movie.  Thanks for what you did for the George Harrison memorial concert, but - like Ian Hunter said, &quot;It mesmerizes and I can't explain.&quot;
0385504209|3.0|At the outset and in order to minimalise any suggestions of pre-conceived bias, I am not a Christian.  Indeed, I am not a believer in any faith.  I chose to read \\"The da Vinci Code\\" simply as a piece of escapist literature.  The book largely fills this capacity.<br />I am puzzled as to how people can be offended or shocked by Brown's work.  It would seem that some people are easily upset and prone to self-righteousness.  The book involves a series of murders that are all related with a clear Christian sub-text.  In this sense, I think the book justifiably earns three stars from five.<br />As to the sub-text, the book suggests that Jesus Christ was married to Mary Magdalene and had at least one child.  So what!  A thirty two year old man 2,000 years ago would be very unusual if he had not married.  Why on earth is this such a big deal?  Surely, the Christian faith is strong enough without being seriously challenged by one book?<br />Returning to the novel at a more general level, Brown has produced a stock standard thriller.  The plot reveals itself with a religious theme but ends more with a whimper than a bang.  Read the book to be informed as to all the fuss, but do not expect a work of literary greatness.
6305131090|2.0|I look forward to Ken Russell's Mahler listening to the hype, but it ended up in a horrible disappointment. Never mind if it's an art movie, Ken Russell ended up making more of an abstract mess of what-he-thought was an interpretation of Mahler's life. If you can stomach bizarre movies like Monty Python's The Meaning of Life, then you can bear the scenes like the Mahler's mock funeral and the Conversion with Cosima Wagner. I don't mind all of these supposedly symbolic and dream-like scenes of Mahler, but it expands little on his private life unlike movies like Amadeus and Immortal Beloved, no matter if the movies are partly fictional. I was under the impression that Robert Powell was going to conduct his Symphony no 8 and then Mr Russell will accompany the score with more symbolic events or picture narratives. It didn't happen eventually. There are vital stories of Mahler's life that are missing; how he became a world-class maestro from being a lowly conductor in a spa resort, his reputedly eccentric tantrums with his players, struggle with anti-Semitism in Vienna, how he met Alma Schindler and of course, the triumphant performance of his life; the Eighth Symphony.<br />It also seems that Ken Russell made this film as if intended for only Mahlerians. Sadly, viewers will be left baffled about Mahler by the end of the film. How are they suppose to understand the justopoxition of irony in scenes of Mahler's childhood? (for example, Mahler's father found out his son had skipped piano class and the whole family was struggling from getting Mahler hurt, the scene where young Mahler locked himself in a storeroom was accompanied by brass band music). Viewers do not understand why Mahler dominated his wife to such an extent she was forbid to compose. We didn't see Mahler conduct any orchestra at all except for the part he imagined himself conducting a Landler in his home. What is so damned special about Mahler? What is the hype? In Amadeus, moviegoers familiar by Mozart are convinced by his genius through demonstrations shown in film. <br />The music in this film is AWFUL to extent Mahler's music is clattered around the film as snippets using when suited to Russell himself. Haitink isn't a mature Mahlerian yet compared to Bernstein and most of the music conducted by Haitink is trash, even though at his later years his interpretations mature steadily. Seriously, I thought it was led by some Hollywood conductor when at the ending credits, I cannot believe the soundtrack was conducted by Bernand Haitink! Simply baffling when considered his interpretation of Symphony no 9 is so legendary that Deryck Cooke, a Mahler scholar, declared it the finest he ever heard.<br />To sum it up, if you're looking for chronological biography of a film like Amadeus, this is a let down. If you're a Ken Russell fan, a rent is considered. Otherwise, just stay your bloody hands elsewhere.
0385336810|5.0|Great story!  I read this book in one day! Really quick read... you won't be able to put it down! Really easy to get into.  Unique storyline, with a nice happy ending.
0790729377|5.0|This is a movie about tourtured souls and lose.  Stanley is a man who just wants to be left alone and then Blance enters the picture and convinces his wife that he is a bad man.  All he is is a tourtured soul.  This is a must see movie.
0385335482|5.0|Love this book!! Read the book in two days! Really funny, without being predictable.  Be sure and check out the other books in the Shopaholic series!  Once you read this one, you'll be hooked!
B00003CXDV|5.0|I'd intended to give this a lesser rating but I couldn't find anything in it that was less than perfect.  It's light entertainment, done with quality &amp; perfect pitch.  The situations are complex but not confusing, the characters are distinct and believable and funny.. I thought it was a lot of fun &amp; worthwhile.<br />I don't usually go for Tim Allen - his barking-ape act never did it for me, but he's perfect for this role as the hammy goof thrown into the deep water.  The whole thing came together perfectly around a strong concept.  Star Trek itself is kind of stale and might have expired of old age, but it's nice to see that there's still a lot of love out there for this material.
B00003CXTG|1.0|The words &quot;Good Acting&quot; and &quot;Ben Affleck&quot; should never, ever be placed in the same sentence together....unless you are a 13 year old girl reading US magazine. Nightmare of a movie, ugh!
0446677450|5.0|Your friends in Hawaii say Happy Easter, thank you and God Bless you bro.
0385504209|1.0|Initially I was drawn to this book because it been a best seller for so long.  As a born-again christian, I was deeply hurt by this book.  It just breaks my heart to see blashamy go so main stream.
0425166805|5.0|Although they seem a little far fetched, especially in this consumerist world where one will only believe that which is placed in front of him as &quot;proof&quot;, I highly enjoy reading Erich Von Daniken's theories relating to the possible origins of human civilization. I mean think about it for a minute, what if the theories were in fact, true? Would you then believe?<br />Von Daniken's first book &quot;Chariots of the Gods?&quot; fascinated me when I read it in high school, not because of his writing style (which he really should have worked on), but rather the fact that it was putting out new ideas which were completely &quot;taboo&quot; at the time. Yes, the UFO craze was in full force with everyone, and their mother writing about &quot;visitors&quot; from &quot;spaceships&quot; doing everything from experimenting on humans to impregnating females, but this was the first time that someone created a theory that human civilization could have indeed been founded by these ancient &quot;gods&quot; in their &quot;flying machines&quot;.<br />I'm not saying that any of it is true (nor his other works), but I get him credit for creating a theory that would go on to influence everyone from Graham Hancock to Robert Temple. Pick this up, and read with an open mind.
B0000028M7|5.0|I have never heard an album so great that every song on it kicks ass. From beginning to end it rocks. I can't stand when people try to classify them as grunge or some music of the moment thing. Overall its just a great hard rock record &amp; maybe the closest comparison I can think of is early black sabbath. To this day I still havent heard a record as good as this one.
B000088E6D|5.0|After watching and loving his DVD I knew his album would be fantastic. It is!!!!
B0001AP12G|5.0|Wow! i just finished hearing the album for the 5th time, and i'm still craving for more! this is really a great album, very diverse, dope lyrics (Yes, Kanye can rap), fabulous beats, i like the idea of sampling old songs and giving then a modern kick, really works well with his style.  he helped Jay-Z and others get to the top of the rap game with his beats, now it's Kanye's turn to shine. Most of the songs in the album are good/excelent, my favourites are: We Dont care, All Falls Down, Jesus Walks, Never Let Me Down (ft. Jay-Z), Get 'Em High, Last Call (the best!), and so on. <BR>One weakness to this album is the excessive amount of skits, although we gettin' used to them these days. the weaknest track is probably Breathe In, Breathe Out. <BR>So, You GOT TO HAVE THIS JOINT IN YOUR ALBUM COLLECTION! You will not regret it, definetly recommend it for anybody that like good rap with soul samples, and a break from the generic (crappy) rap albums that's out there these days.
B00018HU4U|4.0|Norah does nice work again. What a pleasure it is to hear voices like hers. My appreciation for this style of music has grown. Now with artists like Norah and young Michael Bubl leading the way we're in for a pleasant musical journey.
B000005ILF|5.0|Anyone who thinks this album is superable, is plain wrong.<BR>I know that musical tastes usually fall under the subjective category, but i just feel so strongly about this brilliant piece of art that im going to make sweeping statements. <BR>Here he is folks - Sting at his superlative best. There is not a single song you cannot fall in love with (most of my friends concur) - You will hum, you will sing, you will shout - the man must have had heavenly visions when he composed these tracks. If you have a mate - gift this to him/her. If you dont then buy it for yourself. This cd is worth its weight in gold.<BR>Sting is the greatest musician that has graced this planet - and my judgement is based solely on these 10 songs. Mercury falling beats ten summoners tales and soul cages by miles.
B0001IN07Q|5.0|From opening sequence to final words from Mr. Bubl, we sat entranced!!!! He makes the most beautiful music!!!! Beautiful!!!!
B000089RVX|5.0|Whoever says that this CD isn't worth your money must be crazy.  On every CD, there is always a bad song.  Guess what? &quot;Fallen&quot; doesn't HAVE a bad song! If you liked &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot; and &quot;My Immortal&quot; then don't hesitate to buy this CD. <BR>CAUTION: YOU WILL GET HOOKED ON THIS CD VERY QUICKLY<BR>Also Recommended: Single on &quot;The Punisher: The Album&quot; by Seether featuring Amy Lee (song titled &quot;Broken&quot;)
B0001CNRS4|4.0|I saw this movie in the theater and just loved it!  I pre-ordered it on DVD and just watched it again this weekend.  It's a good, fun film...especially if you like dance movies.  I'm a big fan, so this was the perfect movie for me.  It does tend to get a little bit cheesy in parts, but that's what I enjoy about these movies.  If I wanted to see something realistic then I would watch the news.<br />Honey Daniels (Jessica Alba) works three jobs just to make ends meet and in the mean time she is trying to break into the video music world as a dancer.  There's a rival in the movie, the \\"evil\\" boss, adorable kids, and a guy that wants to love Honey (Mekhi Phieffer).  It just has all the components of a good story and I believe that it succeeds.  The best part of the entire movie is at the end...the kids and the dance scene.  I would recommend this movie to anyone that enjoys dance flicks.
B000002VEP|5.0|1987's &quot;Gaudi&quot; was the last collaboration between Alan Parsons and his musical partner Eric Woolfson under the &quot;Alan Parsons Project&quot; name. An album inspired by the life and works of architect Antonio Gaudi, &quot;Gaudi&quot; is a very rich, elegant, powerful album for the Project to go out with. &quot;La Sagrada Familia&quot; is a beautiful orchestral rock epic, with a great lead vocal by John Miles. Longtime Project vocalist Lenny Zakatek takes the mike on &quot;Too Late,&quot; an awesome pop-rocker that could've been (and should've been) a huge hit for the group, though it wasn't released as a single. Eric Woolfson sings on &quot;Closer To Heaven,&quot; a very beautiful, heavenly Project number. The lone single release from the album, &quot;Standing On Higher Ground,&quot; is a very cool, catchy tune, sung by Geoff Barradale of the mid-80's group Vitamin Z (remember them?). John Miles returns for another lead vocal on &quot;Money Talks,&quot; which is a great, down &amp; dirty rocker. Woolfson then returns once more for the lovely &quot;Inside Looking Out,&quot; and the album concludes on a very high note with a short instrumental reprise of &quot;La Sagrada Familia,&quot; featuring excellent spanish guitar by Project veteran Ian Bairnson. As always on a Project album, the performances, production and sound quality are sharp &amp; superior, and the outstanding orchestral touches by Andrew Powell is the icing on an already delicious musical cake.Alan Parsons did, in fact, work with Eric Woolfson one last time on Woolfson's 1990 concept album, &quot;Freudiana,&quot; before the duo finally went their separate ways (&quot;Freudiana&quot; is only available on import, but it's an absolutely brilliant, MUST-buy CD for diehard Project fans). Parsons has since gone solo (though he's retained the services of several Project members for his latest albums), while Woolfson has since gone into the world of musical theater, writing &amp; producing several musicals that have been performed throughout Europe. But these two men have created together some of the most fantastic music I've ever heard (and are STILL making fantastic music on their own these days), and &quot;Gaudi&quot; is a gorgeous, dazzling, memorable album to close out the Alan Parsons Project with. Thank you Alan, Eric, and the rest of the Project gang---long live the Project!sicals that have been performed throughout Europe.

B0001HAHXW|4.0|Around the time Clapton released In The Cradle, his last blues \\"tribute\\" album, I was in my car listening to the local college station.  The station was playing a cut from the CD when my eight-year-old son asked what it was.  I explained to him that it was an old blues number that was a sort of precursor to much of the music we listen to now.  He inquired how old the song was and I replied it was almost fifty years old.  My son then asked:  \\"If it's so old why are they playing it?\\"<br />I'm afraid that is how most people will react to some degree to this album.  \\"It's all nice and all that Clapton loves this music; but why inflict it on us?\\"  This will come from those who think Clapton matters.  I sense among the younger artists Clapton ceased to matter years ago.<br />This all too bad.  This is an excellent CD and bears repeated spins in the old CD player.  Unfortunately, much like In The Cradle, it will be more honored than listened to
0375758992|5.0|Alexandra Fuller delivers an intense recollection of her childhood in Rhodesia during the 1971-79 civil war.  Her parents, originally from England, manage to thrive working on ranches and farms while rearing their children to be hearty, self-sufficient and weapon savvy.  This is not a life style a typical family could handle, but their ability to find humor, love and appreciation for the land they live on is evident in their commitment to stay no matter what the cost.<br />The author has an amazing ability to reconstruct the sights, smells and people of the many towns and villages in which they lived.   With great humor she reviews &quot;ranches or farms&quot; her father and mother chose to buy or rent.  Beautiful compounds, complete with swimming pools,  tended gardens, barns, corrals and servant quarters fallen into unimaginable states of disrepair serve as home for the family.  It is difficult  work to rehabilitate these places, and the endurance of the family is remarkable.  <br />Danger and risk appear to be the spice for this family.  Choosing to remain firmly planted as the war accelerates is an astonishing decision, especially in light of the quirky parental personalities standing at the helm.  Ms. Fuller remembers her life with humor, sensitivity and a palpable love for her African childhood.
B00008PW3Q|2.0|Feels more like one half of a Lindsay Buckingham CD put along side one half of a Stevie Nicks CD.  Buckingham likes to push the envelop of sounds in rock music by recording noises in unusual means.  After twenty years this has gotten to be very old.  Stevie Nicks sounds like a bar maid who has drunk too much whiskey and smoked too many cigarettes over the years.  Neither Buckingham nor Nicks are appealing these days and putting them together doesn't change that.<br />Mick Fleetwood and John McVie are indeed present on the album; but that is the only thing which makes this a Fleetwood Mac CD instead of a Buckingham/Nicks project.  Musically, neither Fleetwood nor McVie are really necessary.  A host of other drummers and bassists could have done the job.  And Christie McVie is terribly missed.  Her skills as a songwriter, performer and vocalist could have raised this CD above the awkwardness it finds itself in.<br />This CD makes one wish for the days of Danny Kirwin and Bob Welch again.
0689859368|4.0|Classifications of Fey!  Never heard of so many fantastic creatures.  Looking forward to reading more about them.  However the Grace children are not so interesting yet.  Hope they develop more in the other books.  My 8 yr. old son and I love the Bauldelair adventures.  When I picked the book up it appeared to bare a resembalence to our Lemony Snicket series.  The Spiderwick series was a quick read.  It appealed to our sometimes short attention span.  We really felt like we spent time investigating and discovering something worthwhile. Fortunatly, by the end of the book the erie feeing of mystery parted and we felt safe.  I hate it when my son can not sleep because his immagination has been hi jacked by some cheap trick.   We will buy the second book asap.
B0001BKAEY|5.0|Okay, here's the thing.  One's impression of a film upon leaving the theater is sometimes different from the film's effect in the home video format.<BR>I wrote a review in this space before getting the DVD and properly refreshing my memory.  Also, there were some things I left out in the first place that still need to be said.<BR>Mainly, it becomes increasingly clear that Revolutions is a better film than Reloaded in some ways ( however, the dialogue is noticeably more clunky in parts of Revolutions ).<BR>Also, the DVD itself is an improvement.  Why, you ask?  Well, this time, nobody decided to add an extraneous green color to the print and then re-color the characters' faces with faux flesh tones.  If you want the Matrix to look absurdly green ( because otherwise airheads can't follow the story ) there's a proper way to do it: the way it was done in films 1 and 3. <BR>One thing I forgot to mention before: the soundtrack, which is excellent ( even if it seems to copy LOTR's music in a certain spot ).  Also, as others have stated, the fact that this film wasn't even NOMINATED for the special-effects Academy Award is a complete travesty.  The defense-of-Zion scene alone, not to mention &quot;Deus Ex Machina&quot; (please!) and the &quot;flame vision&quot; effect, are some of the best graphics in the trilogy and really deserved some kind of commendation.  But here's the problem.  Lots of people have a really short attention span and live primarily in the moment.  Hence the Warhol &quot;15 min. of fame&quot; idea: when the lemming-like masses have moved on to the next big thing, it's over.  By releasing two films in the same 7 months, the Matrix shop actually caused people ( myself excluded ) to tune them out.  When Oscar nomination time rolled around, the Matrix had been forgotten, and it was time ( apparently ) to give all the awards to ROTK in order to atone for dissing Fellowship in 2002.  Because, of course, all those people have now figured out that LOTR is good,whereas if they caught you reading those books anytime before 2001, you were labeled a dork.  So what do they really know, those lemmings?  How to be a lemming.  THAT'S IT. <BR>Ultimately, in the future, the greatness of the Matrix films will still be understood, and the question of &quot;who won what Hollywood award&quot; will be literally trivial.
B000001ELR|4.0|This is a heavy album. With some lost song's. <BR>Creatures Of The Night:8/10 Heavy title track.

B00013RC9I|5.0|I've been a fan of Air since hearing the beautiful soundtrack of Virgin Suicides, Talkie Walkie just seals my admiration even more. This album has it all and should help the group gain an even bigger following. If you think Air is just a robotic electronic band then think again, Talkie Walkie is full of acoustic instruments and vocals giving it a very warm human element and alive feeling. I recently saw the group live in New Orleans and they were fantasic, the set consisted mainly of songs from Talkie Walkie which sounded as good live as on my car and home systems. From the sweeter than sweet Cherry Blossom Girl which could have been included on Virgin Suicides to Surfing On A Rocket with its Lennon-style vocals and lyrics could easily be the new cover for the bomb launching scene of \\"Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb\\" and Venus is Pink Floyd revisited, the rest of the awesome cd is pure Air at their finest. If you're looking for music with emotion, intelligence, rich sound and punch (to keep your sub-woofer happy) this is the one album that's worth every penny and more. The songs are addictive and you'll be listening to them again and again. Merci beau coup Air!
B000001ELL|4.0|This is a cool album. It has a rock feel and some disco part's.<BR>I Was Made For Lovin' You:8/10 A big hit song for kiss.

B00004Z400|5.0|Ok, I cant even classify Deftones or stick them to a label. They're too good for that. They're sound is as unique and as beautiful as their songs. To me, they are unparalleled, and this CD proves it. Every song on the cd has a different emotion and feeling that is conveyed. Here is what every song makes me feel...<br />-Back To School- A rush from start to finish, a feeling of energy, emotion, and action. You'll find you cant get this song out of your head. Awesome in every way.<br />-Feticeria- Anyone who says this song is mediocre, needs to hear it again. My favorite, the vocals and drumbeat fit together perfectly. Just listen to the drums. The bridge for this song is AMAZING.<br />-Digital Bath- I can only convey this song in one word...  BEAUTIFUL.<br />-Elite- Get angry! Anytime that you're mad at someone and feel like you need release, listen to this song. Dont pay attention to the lyrics, just the sound of it. You'll think they wrote this song just for you.<br />-RX Queen- Another song where the drums, vocals, and guitz work together like harmony. Great song. Deep and Dark.<br />-Street Carp- Good rush of energy and Guitar riffs. Classic song that holds its ground after many times played.<br />-Teenager- Mellow, dramatic song. Chill out or sleep. Again, the beat is amazing. I love the way the DJ works into this song.<br />-Knife Prty- Out of anyone I've talked to, they'd say that this was their favorite song off the CD, and you'll see why. Its amazing, deep, and beautifully put together. GREAT.<br />-Korea- This song is like a suckerpunch. It comes out of nowhere and it blows you away. It comes in hard, calms down, gets hard again, and never lets you forget it. I love the sound.<br />-Passenger- Maynard's appearance on this is great. This song is so elegant, yet stays true to distorted guitar. Chino's voice and Maynard's are so much on the same level you'll have a hard time differentiating. This song is the best on the cd.<br />-Change(in the house of flies)-This song is so full of life to me, I can listen to it once only listening to the singing and be blown away, then do the same for the drums, then guitar, then bass, and it all has different effects. Great song.<br />-Pink Maggit- Perfect ending for a magnificent cd. Instead of just landing a hard song and dropping you off, leaving you wanting more, this song eases you slowly and dramatically towards the end of the cd. Oh, you'll still be wanting more, but this last song will at least make the cd seem more complete. <br />And thats what I think about this cd. You'll love it, trust me. This CD is worth buying. Through and through.
B0000CFW87|5.0|This CD is absolutely breathtaking!  Every song on here is worth mention but I don't think there is enough room here to describe each song so I'll just cover my absolute favorites. 'YOu Raise ME Up&quot; is of course a good one.  It has beautiful accompaniment and just a song to mellow out to. My absolute, absolute favorite was Remember When it Rained. This song honestly brought goosebumps to my skin.  Josh Groban plays the piano in this one and it's just beautiful not to mention the lyrics are great.  The first song is also pretty neat (OCeana).  I love the beat to it.  Well, these are just a few of the great things about this album.  YOu definilty have to buy it.
B000099T2L|2.0|Beyonce is so beautiful and she is a good singer but her album [is not good]. The only good tracks on the album are Naughty Girl and Baby Boy and Crazy In Love. You can tell that you should not spend your money on an album when the only good tracks are the hit singles. Because if the only good tracks are the hit singles you can just go online and download them or stream them for free. There is not use spending your money on the [this bad work].
0451191153|1.0|First off, I am by-and-large a conservative, so I do not find Ayn Rand's ideas objectionable on their face.  In fact, I very much enjoyed the book Anthem, also by Rand, which is essentially an anti-communist manifesto.  Rand's style of writing leaves quite a bit to be desired, but she is passionate about her ideas, and that is laudable.<br />But, this book takes stark writing to the extreme.  I was never once amused or saddened or made happy because of this book, and I never for one instant believed any of the characters.  To make the sick little world she creates more \\"believeable\\", Rand sprinkles a bunch of obscure, lengthy references to architecture throughout the already too-long tome.  And, just to make sure she really pounds all of her points home, Rand makes all of her characters self-absorbed philosophy-spewers so you can't escape her tedious diatribes about the worth of the individual over society and the foolishness of any kind of selflessness, including charity.  You can't help feeling disgusted by all of these terrible people who populate Rand's book.<br />Now, I must admit that I never finished this book.  I got about halfway through, but then I was entirely sickened by the fact that the supposedly \\"perfect\\" main character, Howard Roark, rapes an independent, self-made woman, Dominique, and she is HAPPY about it!  That's right, Dominique WANTED to be raped - indeed, she falls in love with Roark after the event!  It's this kind of sick rape rationalization that is the cause of sexual abuse around the world - how can people claim that a book that contains such smut to be a \\"classic\\"?<br />Needless to say, I don't recommend this book; it's not even worth the ink it's written with, not to mention the paper it's printed on.
B00006HBUB|4.0|The flick has a real good nature, is kind of simply fun to watch, and truly shaggy &amp; scooby really work.  I wish daphne looked more like the cartoon version, but heh, can't have everything.<br />The cast commentary version is kind of nice too.  It's an interesting variant which sort of brings the actors down to earth.  Maybe it's just me, but whenever I hear actors in semi-normal situations I'm always a bit surprised, in the &quot;so that's how they realy behave&quot; way.<br />4 stars, instead of 5, because of simple things like daphne didn't look like daphne, etc.
0375751513|4.0|Oscar Wilde tries to argue in the prologue of this book that literature, as a form of art, is not moralistic and that people therefore should not treat it as such.<br />In all honesty, however, The Picture of Dorian Gray is an extremely moral book; it's just hard to decide what exactly the moral is.  The very good and the very bad do not fare that well in this tale of elitist debauchery, while those who go the middle path and avoid both evil and righteousness seem to do quite well.  Wilde once said that he wanted to be like Dorian Gray (evil), was perceived by the world as being Lord Henry (moderate), but was actually like Basil Hallward (good).  Does this mean that Wilde, by his own moralistic views, was inevitably doomed, regardless of what he tried to be or actually succeeded in being?<br />Anyway, all of this moral stuff is very interesting, but don't fear; the novel isn't terribly philosophical and pretentious.  Instead, the book has a by-and-large well-done and consistent plot, and by the end of the novel, when all of these questions of right and wrong are flowing through your head, you can barely recall how on Earth Wilde slipped all that philosophical stuff by you without seeming lofty or ridiculous.<br />I read this book to compete in an essay contest, but I never got around to writing the essay and I'm still glad I read it.  A quick and amusing romp through the darkest corners of upper-class 1800s England; recommended.
B00008PW3O|5.0|After having seen VH1's making of &quot;Say You Will&quot; I recall Stevie saying: &quot;we love Lindsay, we want him to have whatever he wants&quot;<BR>and I'm with her too. If you like the song &quot;I go Insane&quot; you're going to love &quot;Come&quot; (the hard rock guitar and drums are phenomenal!!!!) and &quot;Miranda&quot;. I love Stevie too, cut my teeth on Belladonna, her &quot;Smile at You&quot; just floors me. This is their best since Tango in the Night.
0812550757|5.0|Orson Scott Card is by far my favorite author of any kind of genre.  I fell in love with his books when I was about eleven years old and read Ender's Game, the prequel to this book which tells the story of child prodigies who are forced to train for war at a very early age with the hope of destroying an alien menace.  This book rang so true to me that I have read it more times than any other novel.  Yet, while Ender's Game is still probably my favorite book of all time, it is quite a bit less mature than Speaker for the Dead, which tells the story of what happens to the protagonist of the first book, Ender, after he leaves the armed services at the tender age of fifteen as a hardened soldier.  Speaker for the Dead explores what I feel to be one of the most poignant of all human emotions, regret, and provides a rare glimpse in fiction of the effects of a dysfunctional family on children.  Equally impressive is the ability of Card to create two distinct alien species that the reader cares for but cannot relate to.  The book itself is comprised of so many twists and turns that revealing anything else would almost ruin the story, but suffice it to say that Card has never disappointed me yet (except in his books about Mormonism - oh well, we can't all be perfect...).<br />It seems that most people's problem with this book is that it is not a repeat of Ender's Game.  It's a completely different kind of novel; it answers the question of what somebody can do after saving the world.  Some seem to think that Ender's attempt to turn around his destruction of an entire sentient species is unrealistic or preachy or something, but I think that it's totally life-like.  I've known plenty of remarkable, smart, charismatic people who chose to give their lives to God or humanity or something like that; Ender was the most remarkable, intelligent, and charismatic boy who ever lived.  Why shouldn't he want to put right the wrongs of the world?<br />At any rate, if you want to read Ender's Game, then by all means buy that book and read it as many times as you want.  This book is much more complex and philosophical than Ender's Game, and it certainly isn't action-packed; if that's not the kind of book you want to read, don't get it.<br />On the other hand, if you want an amazing novel full of surprises, joy, and pain, Speaker for the Dead is an excellent novel; highly recommended.
B0001AP12G|4.0|1) Kanye's CD is TIGHT - from start to finish.<BR>2) Tupac is one of the greatest MCs of ALL TIME.<br />Those two sentences are NOT mutually exclusive. All the Kanye-hating in the name of praising Tupac is both childish and unnecessary. When will we as a people realize that it's not necessary to tear down one of our own just to build someone else up?<br />Peace.
B000002KB8|5.0|At first I was hesitant to get this album but when I got it... WHOA! I was used to the sounds of Slayer, Iron Maiden and Judas Priest but when I popped this CD into my stereo I was blown away.<br />The cover shows the direction of the album and the opening song, Black Sabbath come at you with a sort of darkness that you can't help but like. From the opening church bells to the final song on this album, we see what truly made Black Sabbath the first Heavy Metal band.
B0000027RL|3.0|Before I say anything else, let me start by saying that Ten is a good record. It has several powerful, and if not that, enetertaining, songs. Eddie Vedder's voice is quite possibly the best singing voice to come out of the United States since Brian Wilson. The lyrics are well-written and thought-provoking, and Mike's guitar work is some of the best I've ever heard. These are Ten's merits, and they make it a very satisfying record that definatley belongs in your collection.<BR>Unfortunatley, it also has a few faults. The songs themselves tend to be long-winded and boring, and you often find yourself getting lost, dissenchanted from the music. The songs also tend to sound very similar to eachother, each one characterized by Vedder's angry wail, surrounded by the complex murk of music around him. Alive, for example, is almost completely indistinuishable from Once. The band seems almost reluctant to play verses, throwing all their passion into majestic choruses that inadvertantly become the peaks of the songs, leaving bridges, interludes, progressions, and verses in their shadow. Even Flow is a good example of this, as are Black and Jeremy. <BR>All in all, Ten is a solid grunge album, but it doesn't hold a candle to Alice in Chains' Dirt or Nirvana's Nevermind.

B00005JMEW|5.0|First off I loved the film. An instant classic though some believe its based off Hannie Caulder or Death rides a Horse. Though I believe its from his head and partially based off the kung fu movies he must have watched earlier in his life. I believe that the mans a cinematic genius just the opening the 70's style with the Feature Presentation in the opening and how the movie transitions into animi was just incredible. i'm kinda pissed that some are still hung up on the cliff hanger I just don't understand. Tarantino originally wrote this movie as a three hours long epic revenge story. Though he cut it into two movies what's the big deal. I actually like the wait it just gets me that much more excited about friday.
B0000C9ZLD|3.0|I wasn't too familiar with the Strokes, having missed them the first time around (and still too young to have noticed the supposed meda frenzy over them). Having finally heard the first album, which is very good in its own right, and I got this one. You could say it's a holding pattern, and in many ways it is, but it's still got five, maybe six GREAT, catchy tunes. The opening track and all the even numbered ones would make one hell of an Ep: &quot;What Ever Happened?,&quot; &quot;Reptilia,&quot; &quot;12:51,&quot; &quot;Between Love &amp; Hate,&quot; &quot;Under Control,&quot; and &quot;The End Has No End.&quot; Though heavily influenced by the Cars and to a certain extent, the Modern Lovers (the VU influence feels more filtered through them), it's not derivative, at least not to me. Similar elements in the overall sound, the grooves, and vocal style, but still very much the Strokes. &quot;Between Love &amp; Hate&quot; has some pretty smooth choruses with some wry phrasing by the lead singer, and &quot;12:51&quot; is a great, &quot;bubblegum&quot; pop single: very, very simple, but very, very catchy, so much you'll find yourself whistling the riff every now and then.<br />Outside of the six I mentioned, the other tracks just didn't do it for me. I don't think they're bad, but I just can't get into them. After repeated listening, they don't leave much of an impression. A few others I've talked to seem to really dig some of them, though, so they will appeal to some people.<br />Their first is easily their best and most consistent, and if you want more, this will be a good one to get as long as you keep your expectations reasonable. Whether they'll change direction or try something new remains to be seen, but even if this is the last of their established sound, a good chunk of this will definitely hold up just as well as the best of their debut.

B000002MTR|5.0|As the title states this album is one of the Chili's best. Even without John it's still great. This album is all about the bass. Flea's poppin' and slappin' is found all over this album. Navarro's guitar skills are excellent and make the whole album just flow. This album has traces of every genere of music from Funk to Metal. <br />My Top Five Tracks:<br />1. Aeroplane- Just a great song with an addicting chorus and   <BR>   great bass line.<br />2. My Friends- Good acoustic qualities. Made it to Greatest  <BR>   Hits.<br />3. Walkabout- Walking bass line and a smooth song. Basically a <BR>   poem with music added to it. Make that a great poem with  <BR>   music.<br />4. One Big Mob- Reminds me of 80's Chili's stuff. Lots of <BR>   energy put into this one.<br />5. Pea- Flea bass solo. He also sings in it. Unexpected lyrics <BR>   made me laugh at first.<br />Overall Rating: A+
0783226063|1.0|I saw Dune for the first time the other night and I think it should be given serious consideration as one of the worst films of all time.  Surely only a great filmmaker could achieve results this bad; a typical filmmaker's effort might have been merely boring.  And the facts that 1) the movie is now 20 years old and 2) the book on which it is based is conceptually brilliant, but sophomoric in terms of artistic quality and writing style, are no excuse!<br />Practically every single minute of the film (well, those minutes where human actors are present) contains filmic awfulness that simply defies belief.  The two or three truly gifted and experienced actors barely manage to escape with their dignity intact, while most of the others make the sensitive viewer cringe with embarassment.  The timing of the actors' movements, the pacing, the voiceovers, most of the casting, and many, many other elements of this film should be extensively studied in film schools in a class called How Not To Make A Complete Ass Of Yourself As Director.  The music as well seems mostly designed to destroy rather than enhance interest in the shoddy doings on-screen.<br />This movie is bad in a way that it cannot even be enjoyed for its badness; it has no redeeming qualities WHATSOEVER and the reader is warned that it has no value even as a timewaster.  Staring at a clever screensaver for two or three hours is like a university education compared to watching this sad trash.<br />The special effects are a total bore as well, but that's hardly the director's fault -- I'm sure they were impressive in 1984.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I was thrilled to receive this movie.  I have been full of shame since I saw this series for the first time.  Shame, because I never quite understood what these men did for me and my country.  If I can live my life with half of their courage, only then will I have lived my life at all.
B00005JMEW|5.0|jeez, do you think that could be it, do you think it was among other things an attempt at a live action movie in the style of such classic anime titles as fist of the north star, ninja scroll, etc, combined with hong kong action, story of ricky oh, old clint spaghetti westerns, akira (anime and kurasawa). best action flick in years. YEARS! just watch it and pray they let us sheltered americans actually buy the unedited version at some point.
B00005JMSE|1.0|I just got back from seeing this movie. I was blown away by how stupid this movie was. I had been building up all this excitement for a week. At the end of the film Hellboy I looked up at the screen in amazement. I said this is the Number #1 Movie in America. Then what the hell is a matter with the people here. (...). The only good part of the movie was when the credits started. I never got the whole plot through out the movie. The movie had alot of gay characters. The only character that I liked was HellBoy. If you dont like stupid comic book movies that dont have any point to them. Then dont go and see HellBoy. It was a terrible concept for a movie and it was a terrible waste for anyone to pay to go ,and see this terrible movie.<br />-The Movie Guy
B0000844I8|5.0|This film is without a doubt one of the greatest sci-fi films of all time. You can't knock it. The way it make the Pyramids to have been made by aliens in a convincing way is great, and it doesn't try to expose to much in a short time, knowing that there is going to be a continuation of the story. And the cast... great. Kurt Russell and James Spader are superb together. When i recently heared that the producer and director of the movie wanted to do a trilogy and heard the premise for them, i'm glad they didn't, because the TV show (SG1), has taken the stargate franchise to new heights, and it's more intersting. If you've seen the series, get this to see where it all began. You won't be dissapointed.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is one of the two most frustrating TV series ever. (The other one was Cupid, with Jeremy Piven.) It wasn't perfect, it wasn't the best thing on television, and once in a while it wasn't even particularly good (&quot;The Train Job&quot;). But it had a soul, and when it was firing on all cylinders it was very special indeed.<br />The DVD set merely exagerates the pain, because it shows how much better the series would have been without the network interference. Many of the strange shifts in the story (and the characterization) become understandable when the episodes are viewed in their proper order. And then ... it ends.<br />I almost hesitate to recommend this DVD set, because I feel bad about breaking the hearts of a new set of fans. But the more people that buy this set, perhaps the more likely that the next chancy, bold, intelligent series might be given more of a chance to succeed.
078401213X|5.0|Sure, it was shot in grainy, black and white, 8mm film. Sure, the only actor you'll recognise is Mark Margolis (from &quot;Scarface&quot;). Sure, some of the math is wrong. And, no, the 216 digit number doesn't really have 216 digits (I counted 4 or 5 times; there are only 214). All of these things aside, however, Darren Aronofsky takes a nominal amount of money (about $60000), adds a brilliantly written script (with help from actor and friend Sean Gullette) and an impressive soundtrack (which includes Orbital and Drippy), and lets all hell break loose. This movie is nearly perfect, and, despite the fact that we've all been spoiled by color and HDTV, THIS MOVIE WOULD NOT HAVE WORKED IN COLOR!! A large part of the ambience of the film (and much of its appeal) comes from the grainy, choppy cinematography (not to mention the fact that the Steady-Cam is righteous) and boiler-plate special effects (like that brain?). All in all, I'm looking forward to seeing more from this director.
B00009RAJJ|5.0|Forget what the critics and &quot;fans&quot; tell you, Tusk is the best Fleetwood Mac album ever.<br />20 great songs, unusual, but effective production, stellar playing and a great album (now CD) package. The remastering only makes this gem shine brighter!
0385504209|5.0|Amazing book!  Fast read, great  story.  This book really opened my eyes about religion.  I was raised as Roman Catholic (for 30 yeras), still believe in Jesus, etc...but I have to say after reading this book and checking facts, I am starting to question the teachings of the church.
B0001BKAEY|2.0|The third installment to the Matrix trilogy, Matrix Revolutions, is extremely disappointing.  The first movie was a surprise hit for me an maybe one reason why I liked it so.  My wife, the computer genius in the family wanted to see the first movie, and I kept on going back and seeing it again and again.  It had a nice plot despite certain flaws.  It messed well with the look of the film and provided a backdrop to make the action scenes believable.  Reeves was sharp and Fishburn was enjoyable.  By the end of the second movie, Fishburn was a little pretentious, but still the movie was enjoyable enough even if it didn't know when to quick.<br />The directors should have quit then, because the third installment is quite frankly a bore.  The action scenes are generally way too long.  They should have probably taken the last hour of this movie, knocked out about 45 minutes of \\"Reloaded\\" and finished the movie up in the second installment.<br />Despite the C++ theory (computer trying to solve the anomaly), the metaphysical elements, and the Christology themes (Neo bearing the machine world -sins- into him to bring peace to humankind) this last movie of the trilogy does not provide enough spark or interest for the viewer.  Our imaginations about this world and how it would end far exceeded those of the founders of this story.  The pace of the film is too long and the dramatic elements missing.  Fishburn, who was great in the first movie and only mildly effective in the second, is really inconsequential in this one.<br />There are too many pretentious and obvious speeches.  The special effects are nice, but can only carry a movie so far.  Reeves is actually stale and his strongest performance was by far in the first and second movie.  Lastly, Moss does a fine job but cannot overcome a failed script.<br />A great disappointment to potentially what could have been one of the greatest trilogies ever.  Instead, we will forever be reminded that what was a great first movie is ruined by a disastrous final movie.  If there was a Matrix, I would load-jack the third movie in the abyss and give these directors another chance.<br />The last fight scene between Smith and Neo is mildly entertaining and commander Jason's character is better flushed out and he appears less one deminsional as he did in &quot;Reloaded.&quot;ined by a disastrous final movie.  If there was a Matrix, I would load-jack the third movie in the abyss and give these directors another chance.<br />The last fight scene between Smith and Neo is mildly entertaining and commander Jason's character is better flushed out and he appears less one deminsional as he did in &quot;Reloaded.&quot;
B00018D44U|4.0|To read the comments of other listeners, you would think that Norah Jones personally hunted and ate their house pets. Unless these vitriolic comments are part of a conspiracy to smear, I honestly can't figure out the revulsion, for this is a first-class album for intelligent fans of music. If you are considering a purchase of this recording, manage your expectations: Buy knowing that it has a quite different flavor than her first LP. It is less sultry, and more country, but still retains much sophistication and great warmth. In further contrast to the first album, many of the songs collected here are distinct from each other - it does not set a mood like the first, but no single song will let you down.
B000022TSH|5.0|The final last words off a legendary film.  Before self-bannishment, Roman Polanski developed this classic who done it.  Jack Nicholson continued to give one great performance after another during the early 70's with this one setting the stage for an Academy Award the next year.  Another great performance was John Huston as the sinister father.  This is one movie I could continue to watch over and over and over.  It's great filmaking!
B0001BKAEY|4.0|I was mesmerized by the first Matrix film when I saw it for the first time.  As were many, I sat confused for a large portion of the film until I more fully understood what &quot;The Matrix&quot; was supposed to be...namely, an artificial world created by machines to enslave the human race into unknowing servitude while their bodies produced the precious energy needed to power the machines.<br />When I approached the first of the two inevitable sequels, I was a little put off by the increasingly complex world that was portrayed there, a Matrix that seemed intensely manipulated by &quot;programs&quot; disguising themselves as human beings inside the Matrix.  Where the first film focused on the human struggle to free their minds of the Matrix, this second offering seemed to simply the premise that the Matrix was more of a romping ground for dissadent programs with their own personal agendas.  Still, being an installment akin to the first film, I would say that I enjoyed &quot;Matrix: Reloaded&quot; as a whole.<br />This third, seemingly disjointed conclusion to the series, trivializes the characters ever more, reducing the Matrix to a rapidly disintegrating world controlled by corrupt programs whose agendas are more than just played out, but rather, seem to dominate the Matrix.  Further, the story relies heavily on its principal character, Neo (Keanu Reeves) as a sort of &quot;Deus ex Machina&quot; (or God Machine (no pun intended)) to wrap the story up and bring closure to a series that really had no viable ending.<br />The premise is that Neo, the One chosen to save the matrix, is actually capable of sliding his consciousness between the waking &quot;REAL&quot; world, and the fabricated world of the Matrix.  In &quot;Reloaded&quot; we are left with a cliffhanger ending which leaves our hero in an unexplainable coma after he manages to project his consciousness into a group of &quot;sentinels&quot; that are attacking his ship, the Nebacanezzar.<br />With the discovery of this new power, Neo realizes (though its never explained how) that he must ultimately travel to the machine city to attempt to bring an end to the war.  Meanwhile, things are amiss back in Zion, the human home city, as the sentinels have been drilling their way into the city, and have begun an assult that will potentially wipe humanity clean off the map.<br />The premise is that Smith, who was initially an agent of the machines in the first film, has become a renegade program in the latter two, and has begun growing an army of clones that he uses to empower himself within the matrix.  Neo discovers that there is a showdown brewing between he and Smith, and he promises to destroy Smith in exchange for the salvation of Zion.  The machines agree and Neo is off and running.<br />If this synopsis of the story seems somewhat disjointed, its because the film itself is as well.  The story, though well crafted, is broken up, leaving holes from which obvious questions emerge. The motivations behind the characters actions are seldom explained, leaving the audience feeling abandoned during the viewing of this film.   The characters are shallow, and do not possess the believablity of depth of the earlier films.   Similarly, the look of the film is different, with a greater attention spent on the war itself versus the actions of the characters within the matrix.<br />All that aside, the film is well assembled from a visual standpoint.  The effects are first rate, as are to be expected in the world of modern films.  Similarly, the soundtrack and the effects are beautifully crafted and completely convincing.  The story itself, though, which makes or breaks any film, is the one big weakness.  It attempts to be profound without ever having its charcters really do anything.  <br />For those who are fans of the Neo/Trinity relationship...be warned, this film will leave you feeling hollow and unfufilled at its conclusion.  Similarly, for those of you out there who have embraced theidea that Neo is &quot;the One&quot;, be warned, for his character is stripped down and trivialized into an implausible Messiah whose actions and abilities are completely unexplained, as though they are fabricated to bring closure to the film itself.<br />I do not want to discourage anyone from seeing &quot;The Matrix: Revolutions&quot;, for it is an action packed, high speed film with enough CG effects to leave your head spinning.  Just understand that the film is not of the caliber of the original Matrix, or even &quot;The Matrix: Reloaded&quot;.  It is, in this reviewers opinion, a poorly crafted conclusion designed to wrap up the characters a and situations with a bow....instead, it puts many of them in a box (SPOILER AHEAD), for neither the hero, nor the heroine make it to the end of the film.<br />It is worth the purchase price for the special effects alone, but if you are looking for a continuation of the experience from the original film, you will be disappointed...at least I was.<br />-Scott Kolecki

B00005J9U1|3.0|These days, record companies seem to put out varying versions of artists' greatest hits.  Its at a point where these companies think they can make money by changing the tracks.<br />This is very evident with this Bob Marley compilation.  Thirteen of the twenty tracks are from the top selling Legend compilation.  By the way Legend has sixteen tracks(twowhich are bonus tracks).  Ok, the Redemption Song is a group version here as compared to the acoustic one on Legend.  And this compilation has seven additional tracks.  Of these seven tracks, I find the melodies of Iron Lion Zion, Turn Your Lights Down Low,and Lively Up Yourself to be quite good.  The others are not bad but somehow seem to not be on the same level as such classics as Jamming, I Shot The Sheriff, Waiting In Vain, and Get Up Stand Up.<br />Therefore, if you like these extra seven tracks as much as the other Marley Classics, pick this CD up at once.  Otherwise Legend may be the better purcahse for those who want the quick study on Bob Marley.
B0000CDL93|4.0|There are a lot of parts in this movie that are fiction.  Here are 5 parts:<br /><BR>1.  If Lee Harvey Oswald was the sole assassin, he could have gotten 3 shots off in time.  Real life snipers have proven it with the gun found in the School Book Depository.<br /><BR>2.  Jack Ruby didn't place the bullet on the Texas Governor's strecher.  In the movie, he wasn't wearing gloves (check me if I'm wrong).  There would be fingerprints.  No fingerprints were found on the bullet.  <br /><BR>3.  If there was a &quot;Magic Bullet&quot; it didn't go right, left right, left, etc.  The Texas governor was sitting 3 inches below Kennedy, closer to the door than Kennedy, he was a little wider than Kennedy.  There are a few other differences.  This evens out the bullet.  The bullet has a straight path through both bodies.<br /><BR>4.  The last speech by Jim Garrison (the long one right before the jury voted) he never said.<BR> <br />5.  There were not 6-8 shots fired.  A police officer accidentally left his recorder running on his motercycle.  It recorded exactly 3 shots, not 6-8 shots. <br />There are a few more flaws in the movie.  I would buy the movie, but if you want facts watch the history channel's view of the Kennedy assassination.
B00011RPB0|2.0|I'm  sorry but what's the big deal here? Lots of dead spots. The academy awards nominations were what attracted me to rent this. Bill Murray is amusing as a lonely 50 something man far from his comfort zone. Scarlett Johansson is cute & pulls off being older than her 18 years. She is also lonely in Tokyo. They find each other, bond & have some adventures in the big city. It doesn't become sexual which is good. Their affection for each other is genuine & their parting is a nice tender moment. The real star of this movie is Tokyo.

0440224764|4.0|This is the first Grisham book I've ever read.  The plot is a little unbelievable, but sometimes that's a really good thing in a book.  I mean sometimes you just want to read about someone who fakes their own death.  I didn't feel that the ending was ever really resolved.  But to me that was part of the charm of the novel.  But to see how the character gets out of everything and has had everything planned from the start definately takes a little suspension from reality.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|Would you consider this a movie?  There is no plot.  I like movies where there is actually a story line.  I can see there was no thought in making the movie.  It only took 28 days to make it and plus, it isn't even funny.  I didn't even chuckle once.  When you buy DVDs, stay 3 feet away from this movie.
B00009L1TA|5.0|I thoroughly enjoy reading what others say about what they have seen and I had to chuckle that so many got left in the dust in understanding the movie.<br />Travolta's character knew more than he let on yet he had a mystery to solve -- who was the peron behind the drug running?<br />That the whole scheme was a set up was easy to figure out -- but who was on who's side?  Little missy had brains but not the knowledge to figure it out -- Hardin didn't like where his smart-talking investigation was leading.<BR>And don't you think that we have these kind of guys out there backing up our military?<BR>Will be watching this one over again  -- only complaint I have is their barnyard language - but then I guess they think that makes them men??    Kind of illiterate, what?
B0001DI5W6|2.0|The third and --ye gods!-- most boring of the \\"Matrix\\" movies. I wasn't wild about the first \\"Matrix\\" film, but was pretty much on board after seeing #2, considering it a fine, fast-paced, pleasantly pseudo-profound, comicbooky action film. And while this installment started off with a promising action-packed nonchalance, it quickly devolved into a loud, flimsy, poorly plotted morass. Of course, no one needs little old me to tell them about this flick's shortcomings: fans of the series deserted New Zion in droves after this turkey was released... But I still had to check it out and see for myself.  Oh, well.  By the way, Carrie-Anne Moss, who plays Trinty, Canoe's love interest, is one of the least interesting screen actors I have ever seen.  Big flaw in the casting there, which helps drag the series down on a number of occasions.
B0001MDPV8|5.0|Nas 10th Year Anniversary Iillmatic Platinum Edition CD is a most buy for any hip-hop or Nas fan. Don't listen to these people who said you're wasting your money if you buy it.

B00004W4UB|5.0|Very atmospheric and compelling film. Jeckyll &amp; Hyde seen through the eyes of young victorian house maid Mary Reilly, Julia Roberts in a perfect role. This is the type of film that shows her acting to its best advantage, only wish we could see her in more like this. John Malcovitch was great playing the duel roles of the reserved, gentler Dr Jeckyll and the strong volatile Mr Hyde.<BR>Wonderful to watch.
B00006HBUB|1.0|This movie was the corniest thing I ever watched. I mean, come on. The dog talks like a retard and needs serious speech therapy (Rooby Coo???), Shaggy needs a facial, and that nerdy one needs a haircut. I wasn't a big fan of Scooby Doo to begin with, and this hasn't done anything to approve that, let alone the opposite,
B0000019PA|5.0|If you can't already tell from reading these reviews, people have very strong opinions about this record. Neutral Milk Hotel have created a work - to me, a piece of art - without the high production quality and targeted marketing of so many hot new bands' &quot;classic&quot; albums. No, this album's appeal lies in the sweet earnesty of the lead singer's yelping and wailing. It lies in an eclectic mix of rock, punk, Syd Barrett, and a streetwalking brass band. It lies in a surreal story involving Anne Frank and childhood trama. <br />Every band has strengths and weaknesses. NMH might not appeal to you, and this album may be too fanciful or raw. But, I would take the chance. The feeling that &quot;In The Aeroplane Over The Sea&quot; gives me is something like pure joy.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|This movie was not what I expected -- it was more.  These two alienated, lonely souls meet and create a bond that is subtle and powerful.  The environment of Tokyo both creates the possibility for their relationship to develop as well as reinforcing the sense of disconnectedness that they feel in many aspects of their lives. The nuanced performances of Bill Murray and Scarlett Johannsen made the film successful -- in many cases, it wasn't what was said verbally, but what was communicated in other ways.  Most importantly, I enjoyed the atypical ending -- not your usual Hollywood romance fare. People either love or hate this movie -- see it for yourself and join the debate.
B000089RVX|1.0|I have to get this off my chest before i say anything more...<BR>EVANESCENCE IS THE BIGGEST RIPOFF OF THE BAND &quot;NIGHTWISH&quot; THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE!&quot;<BR>let me explain...<br />Nightwish was formed years before evanescence. they are a Finnish goth rock band. Like evanescence (aka: nightwish junior) they are goth rock, somewhat operatic sounding, and have one female (the vocalist) and the rest of the band is male. in both cases, once in awhile there are male vocals, too. on top of that, the lead singer of evanescence looks almost identical to tarja from Nightwish (the lead singer). <br />now... if you like evanescence, ican understand. compared to most of the bands out today here in America... and about anywhere else, they are decent. however... compared to real bands, like nightwish, they are nothing. <br />if you think this music is good, buy &quot;Oceanborn&quot; by Nightwish... it is evanescence's musicianship, lyrics, and melodies taken and multiplied by a trillion. <br />you won't be sorry. <br />and no, nightwish is not my favorite band. and no, i'm not a nightwish fanatic... but i do like them, and i do recognize that this band is totally and completely ripping them off.
0385504209|1.0|First this is an insult to Christians and I do not recommend books that attack the faith of others.  More importantly the misuse of facts in mind numbing.

My grammar is challenged and punctuation frustrates me. As a result, I find myself constantly writing and rewriting my columns and manuscripts.<br />This book gives clear and easy to understand rules for using the English language correctly. All of the writing courses I took in college and since usually left me more confused and frustrated about the laws of grammar and punctuation. Not only is this book very funny, it is highly useful. I am planning to rewrite my first book, &quot;The Child Whisperer&quot;, and thanks to &quot;Eats, Shoots &amp; Leaves&quot; I hope to wow my editor with a more complete understanding of writing mechanics.

B00005JMEW|5.0|I really liked this movie even though I prefer movies such as Sweet Magnolias, Paper Moon and Mrs. Doubtfire.<br />I sort of liked the action, although it does not often agree with my alternative lifestyle, which I have not made public.  My \\"friends\\" would not like it that I liked such a violent film.  Neither would the guys I attempt to supervise in my plant.  Anywho, this is an exciting movie, filled with tons of action!<br />I need an outfit such as Uma's!

0385508417|2.0|Skipping Christmas is a short tale about what happens when Nora and Luther Krank decide to forgoe spending the $6100 that they spent last Christmas and take a Caribean cruise instead.  Predictably, the Kranks are soon facing a boatload of peer pressure to &quot;get into the holiday spirit&quot;.  Their neighbors are upset when they don't put the usual giant Frosty on the roof (thus costing them the neigborhood decorating contest), the printer is upset that they won't be ordering Christmas cards or party invitiations, their friends are upset there won't be a big Christmas party, the police association is upset that they won't spend $100 for a calendar...and on it goes.  As you can tell, what starts out sounding familiar and funny, soon drags on for too long.<br />To make matters worse, after Nora and Luther drag themselves through each of these painful encounters, and you just start to begin being able to like them for sticking to their guns,  their grown daughter calls unexpectedly and says she'll be home in a few hours and is bringing her new fiance home with her, and she just can't wait to show him Christmas in the United States.  Do the Kranks do what a normal, reasonable couple would do and say, &quot;Well, we're sorry dear, but you didn't give us any notice, and you see, we've spent $3000 on a cruise and have plans to leave tomorrow.&quot;  No, they totally capitulate, hence throwing away all the effort they put into skipping Christmas to begin with.  They throw the $3000 down the drain and by hook and crook (and some really ridiculous scenes), and with the help of the neighbors who had been so snotty about them skipping Christmas to begin with, throw a big Christmas party for their daughter and her new fiance.<br />The whole story was just ridiculous and predictable.  By the end, I just couldn't like ANY of the characters.  A neighborhood that thinks some family &quot;owes&quot; them Christmas decorations?  Good thing they weren't hindus.  Parents who think their grown daughter is too immature to understand that they don't want to flush $3000 down the toilet?  At the end of the book, I just felt like these people needed to get a grip, get a life, and get some priorities.  I'm only glad that it was a small book and didn't take up too much of my time.their grown daughter is too immature to understand that they don't want to flush $3000 down the toilet?

B0001O2KQW|5.0|A superior album with all the old standbys as well as songs not performed by the king too often on stage or recorded (blueberry hill).

0425180638|3.0|Writing with golden handcuffs must be hard.<br />Long after the author has tired of the characters, the publisher demands more books featuring them.<br />Result: The bored writer's characters get edgier, angrier, more darkly introspective. And the plots get uglier, sillier, less well-crafted. And downright sloppy.<br />Examples:<br />* The protagonist, a lawyer, and the novel's thoughtful, first-person narrator, is suspected of a heinous murder. She believes she has been set-up by powerful forces. And never even thinks for one moment of consulting with or obtaining defense counsel.<br />* Another major character, a career government employee, mentions -- in an off-handed, &quot;oh by the way&quot; way, to her surrogate mother that she easily became a millionaire a while back. Must have slipped her mind.<br />* The dramatic climax is instantly and incredulously resolved. In an error worthy of a wannabe novelist, the reader is only *told* that the protagonists survived certain death. The miraculous, death-defying feat is accomplished through unseen heroics.<br />Worse, we're expected to believe it's via by a cop on administrative leave who is inexplicably wearing body armor, thus avoiding a fatal, point blank shotgun blast. The tremendous body blow aside, she manages to miraculously overpower her captor.<br />Then there's the uncharacteristic cowardly turn of tail by the strong, macho and sadistic villain who simply runs from the scene without even a little skirmish.<br />We learn the sketchiest of details about all this in a most unsatisfactory, quick and dirty, summary fashion. The FedEx guy must have been waiting at the door to pick up the overdue manuscript.<br />Once upon a time, Patricia Cornwell created a most likable and intriguing character in Dr. Kay Scarpetta. But, obviously tired and trapped, the talented Ms. Cornwell has turned on the good doctor.<br />Now we're all feeling her angst, frustration, and pain.<br />There are still hints of Cornwell's smart insights, her tight plotting, and inspired character development. But they're degraded because she's phoning it in.<br />One can only conclude that Cornwell can't or won't give Scarpetta the bullet. So she's setting the stage for her readers to do the dirty deed for her through a slow, agonizing demise.<br />Call that sad tale, Death by Disappointment.rt insights, her tight plotting, and inspired character development.

B00003CXCT|1.0|I have always been surprised that there hasn't been more of an outcry over changes in the music particularly in ROTJ.  It is painful to sit through the new jaba music-carton section and the music at the end that replaces the ewok song is so bad.  so cheesey.  just another reason to hate the \\"New Versions\\". in some ways i am looking forward to new changes since the old ones were so bad maybe these will be updated. blablabla
B00005OM4N|5.0|Ah, Britney... the girl everyone hates to love, loves to hate, and passes off as a waste of talent because she's not Whitney freaking Houston when it comes to her voice. (Also the main target for those people who use insipid phrases such as \\"real music,\\" \\"fake personality\\" (...I still have yet to get what the hell this means) and \\"manufactured.\\" Maybe there's a handbook of \\"pop-sucks\\" phrases, I dunno)<br />To me... eh, she's okay. I like her, but I don't find her a blight on this planet (relax, she wants to sing and dance and look pretty - she's harmless, people), but it's not like I find her the best friggin' thing since sliced bread (and really, what could top sliced bread anyway?) But enough on that - this is about Britney, not... Britney. Okay, you know what I mean.<br />Bye-bye, sugary-sweet ballads of old. ...Baby One More Time's gone out the window, and while I found it enjoyable, I'm glad Britney finally ditched the damn sugar-rush tunes of old. And, thank god, we didn't get another Oops! ...I Did It Again. No, folks, here was have possibly the finest album of her career... so far:<br />Britney. The R&B-tinged, synthed-to-hell mixing pot of dancey pop smashes, disco-lite, and... all that other fun stuff.<br />You have the good - I'm A Slave 4 U comes to mind first off, with its slinky, sexy, strippery Neptunes sound, complete with groaning synths and groaning blonde teenager. (Or post-eenager - I forget her age at the album's release) You have the chimey, dark-n-sassy Bombastic Love, a song for which I seem to be the only supporter. Damn. But moving on.<br />Of course, you also have the stumble. Only one this time - say it now: Hooray. And since Britney's cover songs have so far been a chain of screw-ups, I Love Rock And Roll falls into that category face-first with its annoying oversynthed attempt at... I have no idea what the hell it is. Hip-hop 80's rock pop fusion with a Britney on top, I dunno. And to think, I hated the original enough.<br />But, at the other end of the spectrum, we also have the catchy smashes supreme: The Caribbean-styled Let Me Be, the industrial-R&P Cinderella (one of my favorites) complete with mechinical whirrs and buzzes and an instantly-catchy cascade of keyboards pumping throughout, the dance-floor Anticipating (a throwback to disco, complete with sugary-sexy froth settling on top), ther pseudo-country piano ballad, I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman, which 1. has one damn long title and 2. manages to take Britney's thin, croaky voice and pull off a ballad surprisingly well with it, and... well, I have no idea what Overprotected is, but if it has harpsichords in it (and it indeed sounds like it does), then it's all right to me. Overelectronic and oversynthed, maybe, but catchy as anything else she's put out.<br />So, put aside your Britney biases for awhile - forget WHO'S singing the music, forget the genre for a change and give it a shot - you may wind up pleasantly surprised.
B000002UB3|3.0|This is far from my favorite beatles album. The best album of 1969?  Hardly. The Who's &quot;tommy&quot; was more innovative and the Rolling stones &quot;Let it Bleed&quot; was better even musically. Paul's ballads get  tired and his screeching on &quot;Oh! Darling&quot; is downright annoying. John's &quot;come together&quot; is one of the few songs that keep this one decent. As for the b-side Im confused where the story runs together. Clearly influenced by &quot;tommy&quot; to run songs all together, the music is the redemeaning factor. Bottom line: If this werent the beatles swan song it wouldnt be nearly as well received. Do yourself a favor and get &quot;Tommy&quot; instead.
0790734060|5.0|Too bad there's no room for six stars!<br />My thanks to those who have written scholarly critiques of the movie and who are obviously much more enlightened regarding the history of W. A. Mozart (and Antonio Salieri) than I'll ever be.<BR>Your essays have contributed a great deal to this section!<br />I remember watching it when it came out in in the theatre and being absolutely transfixed by two elements: the brilliant portrayal of Salieri by F. Murray Abraham (who absolutely, undeniably deserved the Best Actor Oscar for that year) and...the music. <br />I cannot read a musical note to save my life and passed all my music classes in school through the ability to pick up on music (classical and otherwise) and sing it by rote, with a reasonably good voice. I also fell madly in love with Beethoven (!!) and his music at the age of thirteen and had coaxed my parents to get copies of all the Beethoven symphonies within that year, so I never paid much attention to Mozart as I grew older; until I had the occasion to hear his Requiem in D- done live a few decades ago! Although, as a teen, I read everything I could get my hands on about Beethoven, I don't recall any mention of Salieri and am gratified to learn that he, too, had some influence on my immortal, beloved Ludwig! ;-)<br />When &quot;Amadeus&quot; arrived, I went, hoping to hear little snippets, at least, of the Requiem and I was not disappointed. The relationships between Mozart, his father (played by Roy Dotrice, who looked eerily like Leopold and acted much as W. A.'s father may have), and Salieri, punctuated by parts of the Requiem, left me breathless at times.<br />I was somewhat disappointed by the VHS release, but that was more likely due to the inadequacies of my recorder and TV. I still have it, though, and had Bravo not chosen to show it at 9 last night, would have dragged it out and dusted it off for my yearly Easter viewing. <br />I really concentrated on the performances of Abraham, Dotrice and JefferyJones (Emperor Joseph II) last night. I have to disagree with one writer's opinion that Jones was cast as somewhat of a bumbling businessman. The more I see of it, the more subtle it becomes. I'm beginning to think Jones did a sneaky circle around his director, despite the script, and brought out some very intelligent qualities in a man who managed to hang onto his own power in the days when France was being swept by civil unrest.<br />Aside from Abraham and that riveting scene where he and a dying Mozart (Tom Hulce) struggled to complete the Requiem, the entire score was the star. Whoever chose these samples of Mozart's work (I believe it was Sir Neville Marriner) did so with the same perfection that this composer displayed in his work. Even the sarcasm was beautifully underlined by appropriately chosen material. I just wish he'd found a place for the bass solo &quot;O Isis and Osiris&quot; (The Magic Flute&quot;) instead of the insipid Papagana/Papagano, but I guess we can't have everything.<br />Some have made disparaging comments about the new DVD that's just come out. I'll have to order it, as I haven't seen it displayed anywhere - and will reserve judgment until I've seen it on my brand-new DVD player!<br />Meanwhile for those of you who are interested in a completely majestic version of The Requiem in D-, you might try ordering the Sony CD featuring Bruno Walter, conducting the New York Philharmonic. It also contains Bruckner's Te Deum. I don't think it was remastered all that well; it doesn't have the clarity that it should, but the beauty and power of this work shines through. It's about to end as I finish this &quot;viewer's&quot; review.<BR>What a great touch!

Despite some problems with the sound quality of the pilot episode, the production values are great and the featurettes and interviews were entertaining and informative.  It's great to have all the first season's episodes to watch from time to time and I really hope that the rest of the series will soon be available.
B000099T2L|5.0|crazy in love, naughty girl, and baby boy are my personal favorites on the cd.  me, myself, and I was the 3rd single, but i dont like it as much as the other 3 which r also singles.  Best R&amp;B album of 2003!<br />and as for the **** who said there r no guitar solos.... WTF R U THINKING?? THIS IS R&amp;B, NOT ROCK!
B00008H2LB|5.0|Hell Yeah!-<br />Linkin Park proved to be metal gods after Hybrid Theory with hits like In The End and Crawling. This CD has pretty much the same style with rappy verses and exploding choruses. I think that the best song would be almost impossible to choose as all of them feel really powerful and you can always relate to them.<br />My personal favourite favourite is Numb cuz I can relate to it a lot but that?s just me. If you are a great LP fan than your pretty much on the moon if you havent got this record and if your new to this than dont think twice go get it.
0060987464|5.0|Man, you know i started reading this book at my friends house and only read through one chapter. When i got home i automatically ordered this book.

0061015725|5.0|Wow!!!!! This book was amazing. A must Read!<br />This Book starts off a little slow but then it speeds up. this book will keep you guessing and wondering. This isnt a thriller like people say but its great. I kept turning pages and read it in 6 days. The best 6 days of my life. Read it, like it, enjoy it. I Also reccomend this book to science lovers.
0446310786|5.0|To Kill a Mockingbird is a true classic for children and adults alike. I have read this book for school twice, and both times I absolutely loved it. I wish that people could have been treated better back in the 30's, especially African Americans. It's hard for me to say which character was my favorite in the book because I liked all of them. I think that Harper Lee did a good job with Robert Ewell, the drunkard and the accuser of Tom Robinson. There is a lot of symbolism in the book. There is even symbolism in the title itself. The main characters are the Finches; Tom Robinson is accused of raping Mayella Ewell, the daughter of Bob Ewell. Atticus Finch, a respected lawyer in town, is asked by the sherriff to defend Tom in the trial. If you want to find out what happens throughout the book, I strongly suggest that you curl up on your couch and start to read To Kill a Mockingbird.

B000089RVX|4.0|I don't really like female lead bands but i must admit Evanescence really has my support. It IS an awesome band and it hasn't been overrated at all. They have gotten to number one in some occassions and most of those have been fan voted. My favourite songs are My Immortal, Bring me To Life and Everybodys Fool.    Amy puts the truth in the songs and everytime you listen to it you are going to find something new. I kno female singers in a ROCK/METAL band doesn`t sound very amazing but this time it is.  It doesn`t matter what kind o fmusic you`re into, Pop, Emo, Rock, Metal im sure youll find some of your stuff in this album.

B0001BKAEY|5.0|Partly because it's now possible to watch the entire trilogy and keep track of what's going on, pausing and replaying as needed to catch all the little things. (You'll never run out. This is _Finnegans Wake_ for cybergeeks.) At any rate the quality of the DVD release is terrific, sound and video both. (The 'extras' are nice too, but I generally don't buy DVDs because of that stuff myself.)<br /><br />I said last November, and I say again, that the critics (and viewers) who thought the trilogy declined in quality after the first movie are very much mistaken. I think they just didn't grok what the first movie was about and therefore had inappropriate expectations about the latter two.<br /><br />For the record, the theme of the entire trilogy is the relationship between humans and machines/computers/programs -- _not_ 'What is real?'. That question was an important subtheme in the first movie, but it was _only_ a subtheme.<br /><br />Nor does the philosophical stuff take a back seat to the action in _Revolutions_. It's still there, although there are a couple of places where you may have to dig a little harder to find it.<br /><br />Nor is the ending 'Hollywood'. The humans aren't the 'good guys' and the machines aren't the 'bad guys'; the resolution at the conclusion of the trilogy involves the next step in the symbiotic evolution of _both_ 'sides', and not everybody from either side will be going along.<br /><br />Nor, despite all the philosophical stuff, is the purpose of the trilogy to take or expound a philosophical position. This series is a huge, cosmic-scale exercise in mythmaking. The Wachowskis want to tell a _really cool story_ -- the story of a new hero named Neo. _Everything_ else is in the service of this story.<br /><br />Beyond that, I ain't gonna tell you a thing. Watch the movie(s) carefully and figure it out for yourself. The Wachowskis have kept the religious, philosophical, and other references coming right up until the spectactular finish, and they've deliberately left some things ambiguous and open-ended. (Probably not as many as you think, though.)<br /><br />Matrix 7.0 will be whatever the users make of it.

0385504209|3.0|Am I the only one here who had no strong feelings for this book?  I was neither offended nor enlightened.  Simply this was just an ok book.  At the beginning the plot was interesting and all of the extraneous facts actually served some type of purpose, but about midway through the book lost its zeal.  It became a typically mystery with an average ending.  Its topic was relatively new (a mystery surrounding the church) but that does not make up for following subsequent mystery rules.<br />There are better books out there...that will truly wow you.  The fact that this book is doing so well disheartens me as there are many more books more deserving.  Look around people, just don't follow the crowd.
B000060P79|4.0|Simple Plan is anothe pop-punk band. This CD is pretty kick ass. They've given the guys a hard time with the IMMATURE stuff but they're trying crits! I got the record as a present and I really liked it although I wasn't planning to buy it. The guys are growin up and I'm sure critics are gonna shut up on their next album.<br />Simple Plan is simple...if your a teenager and y u?re trying to write up a song then you?d probably come up with something like one of SP?s songs. The bonus (Grow Up) and hidden (Christmas) tracks are really good and probably they?re the songs you could relate to the most.<br />I would really reccommend this album to anyone who likes GC, NFG or something like that.
B0000033OZ|5.0|For three years, this was my favorite album.  It wasn't until Brain Salad Surgery came out that it took second place.<br />It showcases the individual talents of Keith Emerson, Greg Lake and Carl Palmer like no other album of theirs.<br />Still as fresh and exciting as it was 34 years ago!
B0000AQVCL|4.0|Australia's Jet is a band that likes to wear its influences on BOTH its sleeves.  Is it possible to forgive a rock band that rips off every other group from the Stones to AC/DC?  Such naked theft can be pardoned only if the record is as good as &quot;Get Born.&quot;  While they have not one single original idea in their heads, the members (Nick and Chris Cester, Cam Muncey, and Mark Wilson) are clearly skilled musicans who know how to jam with a degree of conviction.  The whole album seesaws back and forth from the 1960s to the 1970s with catchy rockers like &quot;Last Chance&quot; and &quot;Are You Gonna Be My Girl,&quot; while &quot;Cold Hard&quot; recalls AC/DC of the Bon Scott era.  But Jet loses altitude on most of the ballads, which bleed into each other without much distinction.  They clearly are more effective when they kick up the tempo and rock.  &quot;Get Born&quot; sounds like a valentine to the band's musical heroes, and there's nothing wrong with that.  But while imitation is often the sincerest form of flattery, it wouldn't hurt Jet to get their creative juices flowing and strive for a bit of originality going forward.

Willem Defoe also gives an excellent turn as Gene's FBI partner. <br />This film hit every mark, in acting and writing. Wonderfully shot. Hackman deserved his Oscar nomination.

B000066F6H|5.0|Here it is, two years since the American release of this album, and I've just gotten around to listening to it.  Why?  Because I had a hard time believing that \\"Veni Vidi Vicious\\" could justify its hype.  Well, this release proved me wrong.  At a tight and concise 28 minutes, this fantastic release bursts with playful, brash energy.  It's wholly unoriginal, but they make up for that with the skill they use to play these tracks of crisp, amped-up punk.  \\"Outsmarted\\" and \\"Hate to Say I told You So\\" are explosively great and are solid enough to win over just about any cynic, while \\"Statecontrol\\" and \\"Die All Right!\\" rock with fury.  Sure, I'm two years behind in discovering this CD, but it's never too late to experience a record as fine as this.  The grooves on \\"Veni Vidi Vicious\\" are as catchy and as infectious as a case of, well, the hives.
B00005AR3G|5.0|I love watching this movie for the wit and humor. Kronk is just the most valuable sidekick. It is a cut above other Disney movies because it lacks a pyscho villian, death, and other thematic elements. This is just a funny film for the entire family!
B00004YZFR|4.0|To find this on dvd or even vhs anywhere, it costs around $40.00. Heck you can get the four flicks 4dvd set for cheaper than this. As for the film it is a classic. I bought a used vhs because I would not pay the asking price. The reason I only gave it 4 stars, because the quality isn't the greatest, the equipment was not as advanced in 1969 I guess. Maybe dvd quality is better.Great coverage for an infamous day.this concert was the anti-woodstock, was only 4 months after Woodstock. What were the Stones thinking when they hired the hells angels, I don't know to this day? This was a disaster waiting to happen.The angels handled it just the way you would expect them to.At the beginning of the film it has infamous Hell's Angels leader Sonny Barger calling in a radio show. This guy came to my hometown a few years ago, and extra security had to be hired. Did the black kid really point the gun at Mick Jagger, or did they kill him because he showed up with a white girl? This, much like the Who controversey in Cincinnati in 1979, shows why there is better security and assigned seating today. But, it does show the Stones while they were young and in their prime. Good film.
B0000033TE|5.0|ELP was at their creative peak during the making of this album.  Emerson worked with a prototype moog synthesizer called the Apollo, Lake provided possibly his best ballad, and Palmer gave us synthesized percussion on a stainless steel drumkit.  They brought in King Crimson lyricist Peter Sinfield to polish off the best ELP album ever.  It was - and is - the crowning achievement in progressive rock.
B00005JMJ4|2.0|This is probably the most boring movie of all time. The only good point is Bill Murray and he only has one or two funny moments. I couldn't figure out if the movie was a comedy, drama or what it is supposed to be.
B0000DJZ8R|5.0|John Ford was a fascinating director in the way he emphasized a point while downplaying a scene at the same time, as when Casey is \\"Preaching\\" inside the tent about wages and going on strike while Tom and others sit at his feet (It's like a mini version of the Sermon on the Mount). As Casey speaks a hanging lantern illuminates his face but he is also  bathed with a glow of enlightenment (His own lost faith having been restored) and when he leans forward to make a point not only is he then in shadow, but he has plunged his face into the darkness that Tom is in metaphorically, as well as literally. Basically we have just seen Jesus tell others to roam the land and spread his word. Sadly as is often the case, it isn't until after Casey's death that Tom see's the light (\\"Casey was like a lantern\\"). The grapes of wrath is a picture that will never cease to be releveant as long as there are Two kinds of people in the world. Those that can't get enough, and those that simply want enough.
B00005JN1L|5.0|You may say I gave this movie a great rating because I am obbsessed with Johnny Depp. To tell you the truth that is why I went and saw it with my Friend. I saw it and loved it. A writer's Wife is Divorcing him, He lost his home and can't write any books (due to the fact he can't think of any ideas). Mort Rainey (Johnny Depp) Has lost everything worth living for. He spends all day sleeping on his couch up in his cabin. One day a man called Shooter come's and accuses Mort of stealing his book. Now Mort must find some way to fight this guy off before he kill's his friends, family, and maybe even himself. I am telling you, if you haven't seen this movie already go, go now. It is truley the best movie EVER!!!!!!
055357342X|5.0|This series is something that will definitely become the standard by which I judge all other books.  It is the summer of my book reading in life and I am entirely engrossed.  I picked up the first book in the series after finding it left in a box of stuff from a move that must have been an old roomates and have since infected about 6 people with an addiction to this series.  Each book has only escallated my interest in the series, unlike say Goodkind, to the point where I can just sit and talk with other friends who have read the series about what we think will happen, which characters we like, who we hate, why, like the characters and story are things real in our lives.  Do not miss out on this series.
B0001DI0FI|5.0|This film [shoudl be commended for] its brilliant use of episodic storytelling. By making a movie up of vignettes, we are able to grow more attatched to the characters. It enables an extra layer of realism and involment to the film, and I found it to be thrilling. <br />Great films have been episodic before. Take It Happened One Night, for example. One story comprised of several small, yet wonderful adventures. This is a great film, the best of 2003. <br />Perfect movie, perfect film. A grand time.
B00003CX95|3.0|I just watched Braveheart a little while ago and at the beginning of the movie I thought it was absolutely sweet when the future wife of William gave him a flower at his father's funeral. But then the movie grew very warrior- like when the movie quickly cut to the boy turning into a man and the English kills his wife and Wallace sets out for revenge. A series of action scenes result and Wallace pretty much just fights and fights. It's easy to tell that this is a story of the centuries long battle of the Scottish and the British, and Mel Gibson picked this one man out of many Scottish leaders to shine a light on. Many of the battle scenes are quite wonderful, and a laugh is thrown in at times. The soul- mate love thing at the beginning with William and his wife who is played by the tender- hearted Catherine McCormack(that Mel admits he had fallen in love a bit with while acting with her) was not at all mushy and throughout the entire film it is shown that his wife is always in the center of his heart, especially at the end when she comes to him, reuniting them at last. <BR>But the problem with this film I didn't realize until a few days after was that this movie was stamped all over the place with artistic license. The truth was the real Wallace didn't marry no girl from his village, and that certainly wasn't the reason he went into war. (...) . The prince was only a child back when William was in this battle and so was the princess he married. These two married years after William's death, so there's no way also that the princess could have had in any way contact with William, nor any lusty scenes with him. Honestly this crush this princess had on him and then this one night stand of lust was ridiculous in the film, because in the 1200s this would never have happened. The princess would never even be sent off to talk matters of business because kings confined women only to the castle back in those times and nowhere else. So although it was nice the princess finallygot a real man in her bedroom for a night, it is unbelievable for those times and just boring. And also there were a few other spots where it would have been nice for Mel to try to slim down into the actual real history.<BR>But otherwise the movie was nice. Especially in the end, when he shouts freedom, although he knows death is the only option if he said this. But this was for inspiration that fueled the remaining of his army to ensure a quick victory at the very last few minutes of the film. <BR>This movie I would have appreciated more though if Mel hadn't used so much artistic license and used more actual history. But I applaud Mel for his effort. He certainly put the Scottish spirirt in me.
B00005JMJ4|2.0|People visiting cultures unfamiliar to them as well as being adrift in their own lives in an interesting premise. That they find each other and connect may provide a satisfying movie.<br />But I could just not get over the constant racism of the movie: it may be funny at some level for Bill Murray's character to be confused by a Japanese speaking director in Japan, but the movie seems to imply that these Japanese are just weird and insensitive. And Charlotte's youthful Japanese buddies are so stereotyped that they are insulting to all Japanese. Just consider the impact if instead of Japan, the characters were placed in Harlem and the film went out of it way to stereotype and insult the people who live there.
0385504209|4.0|Something about symbols in the works of Leonardo Da Vinci, that's what I heard about this book.  It was said to be an erudite mystery.  That alone was not enough to keep it at the top of the bestselling lists for over a year, so I decided to see what all the fuss was about.<br />My first, and a lasting, impression of THE DA VINCI CODE is of utterly graceless, styleless writing.  Sentences, though mostly grammatical, clunked about like a bag of rusty old plumbing parts.  Here is the author's idea of character development: our hero looks like Harrison Ford. Back stories are inserted regularly, like someone heaving rocks off a moving truck.  And we begin with the death of a contemporary curator at the Louvre, who, shot in the stomach, has the presence of mind to realize that while loss of blood won't kill him, leaking stomach acids will in about 15 minutes, so in the time left to him he strips, uses his own blood to leave several lines of an encoded message devised on the spot, draws a circle and lies in it, and voila, becomes a facsimile of Da Vinci's Vitruvian Man.<br />After a while, say after the first 200 pages or so, that death scene no longer seems so very incredible. Things finally begin to take off as the symbology and codes that had been variously meted out begin to come together in a cannily connected vision of an alternative Christian history, one that has antecedents in generations of historical research. Dan Brown did his homework.<br />It's that part that makes this book matter; otherwise it is a thriller that reads more like the description of an action movie than an actual novel.  It's like riding in an old Jeep off road at 80 MPH without seatbelts or shock absorbers.  As for the denouement:  it is a lot better, more credible than that in THE INSTANCE OF THE FINGERPOST, another &quot;erudite&quot; entertainment that had a lot of good writing going for it but cheated big time with a climax that gave new meaning to deus ex machina.  Brown gets himself out of his box in one piece, without stepping on too many  sensitive toes and without entirely selling out his research and its premises.  His puzzles are fun, if not a little obvious at times, and it is no doubt for those that this book continues to bob at the top of the bestselling lists.t of his box in one piece, without stepping on too many  sensitive toes and without entirely selling out his research and its premises.

B00007AJF9|4.0|I loved this movie. Cate Blanchett played a marvelous Elizabeth, almost looked exactly like her as well. She has the right accent and even the right attitude to play the Virgin Queen. Strength was a bright aura around Cate throughout the entire film as well as the famous quick- thinking the Queen always was reported of having. Although there was a few places artistic license was stamped, it was almost the exact way things happened to the Virgin Queen, I know because I did a whole report on her a year ago in school. The only place they did a real doozy on was this passionate bond between the Duke and Elizabeth. See, back then, many believed that the Queen and the Duke had this affair going on, but it was never proven to be true. So I guess the movie took it as a good pathway for a little romance in the movie and made this a lovey- dovey part of the story. But really this is the only place they put heavy artistic license on. <BR>This movie is passionate and bold, showing how a woman ruled England in the most harshest times for women to even own their own household much less an entire country. Cate illuminated the Virgin Queen perfectly in both her strong moments and in her unsure times, telling the story of a princess shut out of society and then ultimately being thrown into royalty after her sister dies. The main problem they show clearly in this film is not her being a woman, although that's what you would assume, but it's actually becuase of religion. Due to the fact Mary, her sister who ruled before her was Catholic, the England was ran through this religion. But now Elizabeth is Protestant, and like in real life, she refused as she ascended the throne to change her belief. She also refuses as in real life throughout the movie to get married, claiming at the end of the movie that she was married- to her country of England. <BR>This film is above all a great biography of Elizabeth. It shows the passion, strength, courage, pride and tender heart of Elizabeth. This film is a must see and I rcommend it to all alike. I believe everyone must know the Virgin Queen, for she was no soul to be ignored.
B00005JM0B|3.0|With Arnie now settling in as Governor of California, it looks unlikely that he'll ever appear in another Terminator episode, at least not in a physically demanding role. (Somehow I can't see the civilisation of the future bothering to beam a grandpa back to the present day.)<br />So, unless another actor takes the lead role, we're left with the somewhat sotto voce ending of John and Catherine holed up underground while all above ground are obliterated by nuclear war. It's hardly worth getting your children educated, or bothering to contribute to a pension, if that's what's going to happen in the next decade. Could it happen?<br />Well, rather topically, the movie came out at a time when the world was suffering from a wave after wave of computer viruses -- myDoom, SoBig etc. Given that it is a supervirus that kick-starts SkyNet into its world domination opportunity, we might worry that Bill Gates will somehow be responsible for the end of the world.<br />Plot-wise, this movie takes up the story fairly smoothly from where T2 left off. Even if you've done the Terminator ride at Universal Studios, you won't feel that there are glaring problems with the plot of T3. The trouble is that this logical consistency means that there isn't anything wonderfully innovative about this film. The new female terminator arrives with no fundamental improvements in her powers (or special effects) over the liquid metal temrinator of T2. Linda Hamilton's character has unfortunately been lost to cancer, and John Connor finds a vet with whom he 'made out' when they were both 13.<br />There are some nice bits of humour -- Arnie visiting a male strip club, &quot;Talk to the hand&quot;, his obsession with getting the right shades etc. And there are some great action set pieces -- particularly the lorry/crane chase. The punch-up in the toilet stretches its viewing certificate worryingly close to the limit, particularly when she kicks Arnie's head almost clean off. Despite the violence, it occurred to me that this film is really Wonderwoman meets the Six Million Dollar Man updated for the noughties.<br />But I just don't think there's much magic left in the series.red to me that this film is really Wonderwoman meets the Six Million Dollar Man updated for the noughties.<br />But I just don't think there's much magic left in the series.
0385504209|5.0|An easy read broken into many short chapters for nice stopping points, except that you really can't stop turning the pages.  The mystery is laid out beautifully and Brown has done a great deal of research which surfaces throughout the book.  The content of the research sparked my interest and forced me to do my own research on the Dead Sea Scrolls and The Magdalene which led me to more research on The Essenes, The Priory of Sion and Knights Templar.  Fascinating topics that I knew nothing about.<br />It is interesting to read other reviews that slam this book for the simple fact that it raises questions about orthodox religion and beliefs that they have never questioned.  I am a deacon on our United Church of Christ consistory, but I am always searching for more infomation.  New information isn't necessarily going to change my beliefs, but it can open my eyes to a variety of other beliefs and thoughts that are available.<br />This book can lead you to many interesting viewpoints and thought processes on religion with a little bit of research on your own using the interent. The story itself keeps you thinking the whole way through and ties itself together beautifully in the end.  To help answer one question that I read earlier, &quot;Why would the Priory of Sion be so determined to keep their secret?&quot;  Ask the Cathars of the 1400's why the Church of Rome went on their crusades.
B0000013GT|4.0|This CD has a lot of that old school rap on it. I like it a lot. It has songs like Two Dope Boys in a Cadillac. That song is really good. Weelz of Steel is also a great song. This is not all 5 stars but it deserves 4. Go buy this album.<br />WARNING: Only for sweet rap lovers!
B0001HAHXW|4.0|Eric Clapton &quot;Me And MR Johnson&quot;, is not going to be some commercial monster that is going to generate lots of airplay.  What we have here is Eric Clapton giving 14 tunes from the Robert Johnson catalog, a fresh sounding honky-tonk rhythm feel, that makes for enjoyable listen.  The rhythm section of Steve Gadd, Billy Preston, Nathan East, Andy Fairweather Low and Jerry Portnoy is tight, and they give you the feeling that you are sitting in a Bourbon street blues club rockin the night away.  Clapton adds the sauce, to numbers like &quot;They're Red Hot&quot;,&quot;Traveling Riverside Blues&quot;, &quot;Last Fair Deal Gone Down&quot;, &quot;Stop Breakin'Down Blues&quot;, 'Milkcows Calf Blues&quot;, and &quot;If I Had Possession Over Judgement Day&quot;.  This cd is so well done, I wouldn't hesitate to say that some Grammy nominations in the blues catagory are headed Eric Claptons way.  Eric Clapton is certainly more then &quot;Layla&quot; and &quot;I Shot The Sheriff&quot;, and this cd proves Clapton continues to be diverse and take chances with his music, which is a good thing.  Don't miss this one!
B00005JMJ4|5.0|I rented this movie on DVD because I've always liked Bill Murray and was intrigued to see a movie for which he won a Golden Globe award as an actor.  <br />The movie sat in my room for days -- looking at it I wasn't overwhelmed to watch it after all.  I decided to watch it finally, as I'd paid to rent it.<br />I became lost in their world for two hours, and at the end of the movie I felt horrible for the two main characters.  As another reviewer wrote, I really felt that Bob was leaving Tokyo and Charlotte was staying, and my heart ached for them.  I was completely drawn into their relationship, brief as it was.  I loved the acting.  I loved the script -- it was funny where it needed to be, and serious where it needed to be; and Sofia Coppola didn't feel the need to put too many words into the actors mouths during intimate and/or uncomfortable moments.<br />I've never felt compelled to write a review about a movie ever before.

B00003CXA2|5.0|After looking over pages of reviews there seems to be something missing in the assesments both of those who loved this movie and those who hated it (I couldn't seem to find anyone in the middle)<br />Forest Gump is unquestionably one of the most technical masterpeices of blended footage you have ever seen or ever likely to see again.  It is a feel good movie, especially for those old enough-like myself, who remember these events first hand.  <br />The movie is true to the times in which it is set, but this also means it includes the bad with the good so there is more profanity, drug use, and sexual situations than some might be comfortable with.  A certain level of maturity is required to realy apreciate this film and the PG 13 rating is an approriate guide as topics include adult friendships, God, life purpose, incest, HIV/AIDs, and death, both from disease and in battle. <br />It takes an awfully bright man to act like an idiot and Tom Hanks shines in what may well be the best role of his career.

B0001FR3IQ|2.0|Highlights: Direction; production design; some inventive effects and camerawork.<BR>Lowpoints: Badly written; cliché-ridden; concept: not-scary-but-gory; acting: not-special-but-adequate.<br />Conclusion: Like the title, the film \\"Gothika\\" doesn't make any sense, its formulaic plot littered with obligatorily `unconventional' supporting characters and predictable shocks. H. Berry's is a psychiatrist who, after a car accident caused by ghostly girl, awakes locked up in her own ward and blamed for her beloved husband's murder, which she obviously can't remember committing. As she struggles to remember (in a performance that makes you wonder about that `Berry' Oscar), horrid things start happening and the 'suspense' supposedly mounts. What mounts is our annoyance with the film, that boasts decent direction (which elevates &quot;Gothika&quot; above Dark Castle's previous sordid efforts like &quot;Ghost Ship&quot; and &quot;House on Haunted Hill&quot;) and stylized sets - and everything else trying to live up to it... Or NOT trying - P.Cruz and R.Downey Jr ham it up effortlessly, as if finding it pointless to attempt to liven up this particular material.Watch the director's French \\"La Haine\\" instead, and hope he'll aim his skill at more worthy material next time.
B00003CXCT|1.0|I have a very logical reason for buying DVDs: to recreate the theatre experience in my home. I watched, and enjoyed, the Original Trilogy in the theatre and laserdisc, but these Special Editions are truly distasteful and really show that Lucas was a far superior film maker in 1977 than he is today.<br />If he or his heirs ever release a DVD collection of the critically acclaimed Original Trilogy, then I'm buying, but until then, the wallet is closed!
B000002LFZ|5.0|Fleetwood Mac could had been bigger than the Beatles. But they didn't unfortunately. The songs on this cd are excellent. There wasn't one I didn't like, despite that I'm only 21 (b. 1983) and wasn't there  when they were everywhere. Still played on classic rock stations and on MUZAK, Fleetwood's music never sounds old or irritating. A good production for when you are driving at night or just want to relax after school or work. Worth every dime, &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; won't dissapoint you.
B00004XONN|5.0|unexpected.  how easy would it have been for radiohead to continue riding the wave of both critical and album sales success?  instead, they opted to try something different--they didn't want to become comfortable, and they wanted you to stop and think.<br />everything in its right place immediately sets the tone for this album.  keyboards slide in and create a strange feeling of comfort, yet urgency.  broken lyrics fizz over the keyboards.  fragmented lyrics.  an automated feeling is broken by yorke's raising of his voice.<br />kid a opens with the nostalgic feel of xylophones that soon echo and surround you.  indecipherable words and an amateuristic beat box rhythm accompany the still-continuing xylophones.<br />then, a blaring bass thuds in.  the national anthem.  a blunt, repetitive, but strangely interesting riff.  yorke's sweet falsetto finds its way through the mix into your mind.  trumpets blare in and soon the song dissolves into an all-out trumpet improvisational tune.<br />how to disappear completely is the first we hear of guitar on this album, and it has a hushed, emotional tone to it.  this song is thick with a feeling of unease.  yorke's poignant voice is what makes this song.  the sadness evoked in his voice makes your eyes droop.  the best song on the album.<br />next is treefingers, an ambient, soothing tune--the only weak song on this album.  it seems like a breather for you to recap what you've heard so far, and a time to prepare yourself for more.<br />guitars again, this time more in a rocking manner.  optimistic.  the guitar is given an abrasive and rough sound that provides an interesting contrast to yorke's smooth vocals.<br />in limbo is next.  at first, yorke's voice is barely heard over a slowly descending riff.  notes on the keyboard are spread sparingly.  the most interesting part of this song is the end, when yorke's voice changes to a sound reminiscent of ok computer.<br />a repeated beatbox riff leads into a melodious chord progression of four notes repeated throughout the song.  strange sounds weave in and out of focus.  yorke emotes a feeling not before felt on this album--a feeling of urgency enhanced by lyrics that speak of women and children going into bunkers, and an impending doom.  &quot;we're not scaremongering / this is really happening.&quot;<br />on the morning bell, yorke's slightly nasal voice is backed by a calming keyboard riff and a short drum riff.  suddenly, the song slips into a thick, dense sound that quickly leaves.  scary sounds in the background slip in.<br />with motion picture soundtrack, you're left with a feeling of a voyage just finished.  an organ is yorke's only backing at first but they soon leave, only to be replaced by beautiful, cascading harps that finish out the song.<br />a fantastic album.  better than ok computer.
B000000OQF|5.0|Appetite For Destruction was made to be one of the most succesful albums let alone debut albums of all time and it succeeded.Welcome To The Jungle is one of the best opening songs for any album since Jimi Hendrix's Purple Haze.Its angry,loud confused and arrogant.Its a classic songs.Its So Easy is an even better song with even more shocking lyrics.This song pretty much puts all of Guns N Roses punk rock attitude into one song.Nightrain is a song about wanting to escape and never return by drinking.Out Ta Get Me is pure animosity.Mr Brownstone is more of a pure straight forward rock song which has a really nice groove and Paradise City is again about wanting to leave.My Michelle is about as decadent as Its So Easy and this time its all about a girl.Think About You is like a cross between a ballad and a straightforward hard rock song and Sweet Child O Mine shows us Axl's sensitive side.Youre Crazy and Anything Goes Tonight are really just great rock songs nothing more nothing less and Rocket Queen is great because it starts off as just a sleazy rock song and then evolves into sort of a ballad.Its very original.If its been done before I havent heard it.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|I would've chose zero stars but there is no option.  I bought the DVD because it was nominated for an Oscar.  Thinking...Bill Murray in a comedy...nominated for an Oscar...good reviews...Gotta be a good movie.  One thing I require of a movie is it must be entertaining or stir emotion or stimulate reflection.  This movie does nothing.  It is not entertaining, It stirs no emotion (well it did make me mad that I wasted 20 bucks and an evening)and the only thing it stimulated was this review.  By far the worst movie I have seen this year.  I do, however, recommend that you watch it for yourself as words cannot possibly express how bad this movie is.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|There's no reason to criticize this film for lack of action. It's not about the exciting fantasy worlds presented by Hollywood clone drones and eaten up by consumers starved for the latest distractions. It's about people living their lives, and if you let yourself accept that fact, and allow yourself to revel in the uniqueness of others, this film can be deeply satisfying.
B000089RVX|1.0|Listening to this deranged woman's wailing is the vocal equivalent of getting large nails hammered into your temples. As for the rapping... linkin park has already tried that, it doesn't work. Powerful guitar.. gimme a break any decent guitarist could pull that out of their a**s. As for the 'goth' look, WHY?? Leave that to Manson, he currently owns that genre... If I am ever in a supermarket with that c**p on the loudspeaker again, I am going to attempt suicide with the nearest blunt implement. I think I've said it all.
B00008BRB5|3.0|The Police were an alright band adn this album is also just, alright. Stewart Copeland was the most talented person in the band, he is one of the greatest drummers of all time! Andy Summers is a decent guitar player but nothingto spectacular. And Sting, well I can tstand him and his lyrics are good but the man cant play bass to save his life. This was The Polices biggest album of their carear, they broke up just after the realese.<br />The openinng song, 'Synchronicity' is a pretty good new wave song, with a cool beat. 'Walking In Your Footsteps' and 'O My God' both have good lyrics but are nothing special. 'Mother is a decent song. 'Synchronicity II' is one of the better songs on the album. Also one of The Polices best songs ever. 'Every Breath You Take' is Th Polices best song ever and the best on the album obvously. Great lyrics, beat and great bass for once. 'Wrapped Around Your Finger' is also one of The Polices best songs, but it also has Stings all time best lyrics! 'King Of Pain' has got a errie feel to it and kinda scary lyrics but it is still a very good song. The rest of the songs blow in my openion, but hey thets just me.<br />This is a decent album by a decent band like I said before, but this is also The Polices best album so that doesnt say mush for them, I wouldnt waste your money on any album by The Police, instead buy Every Breat You Take: The Best Of The Police.
B0000DJZA0|5.0|I love Coldplay so of course I purchased the live CD/DVD. I was not disappointed. Seeing the Scientist live was one of the most moving experiences. Chris' voice is so emotional that you find yourself singing along with him, helping him hit those high notes.<BR>A few notes:<BR>*Yes, Gwyneth is in the DVD. She's in the part where Chris is doing yoga and also at the very end when they are leaving the concert.<BR>*The reason Green Eyes is not played live anymore is because it was written for an old girlfriend of Chris' and he is trying to respect Gwyneth. <br />The boys are so down to earth. All of them. They seem shy by their sudden success and that makes them so likeable. The segment about Chris' Spanish shirt was particularly funny. <BR>This DVD/CD is a must for a fan of Coldplay's waiting for their next album.
B000000W5B|5.0|Goats Head Soup is one of the best albums that The Rolling Stones ever recoreded. It came out right out after Exile On Main St. which is also one of The Rolling Stones' best albums and maybe their best, but anyways Exile was such a landmark in their carear that many thought this was bad because it wasnt as good. Im going to tell you know Goats Head Soup isnt as good as Exile, but it is none the less a killer rock and roll album, there is nothing bad about this album at all!<br />The album starts of with 'Dancing With Mr. D' this is a killer song with killer leads by Mick Teylor and awsome riffs by Keith Richards. This is one of the best songs on the album. '100 Years Ago' is next, and this too me is one of The Rolling Stones best songs. Its killer with great lyrics and killer guitar. 'Comming Down' is sung by Keith and its got amazing lyrics but I dont like the song other then that, its the only low point to this album, for me anyways. 'Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo (Heartbreaaker)' is a killer rock song that still gets loads of radio play this too is one of The Rolling Stones' best songs. 'Angie' the most popular song on the album, and it is also the worlds greatest break up song. Its was written by Mick Jagger about David Bowies then girlfriend Angie. Then we roll right on into 'Silver Train' which is a slide guitar driven song and it has a killer beat to it. 'Hide Your Love' is a differnt song but its still very good and solid, its got strange production. 'Winter' is one of the best ballads that The Rolling Stones ever made, its beautiful and it has some compelling lyrics, this is to me one of the best songs ever made! Im not joking! 'Can You Hear The Music'is a cool little song with some awsome keyboards. 'Star Star' was just going to be called Star but the song was so nice they named it twice I guess, it has the Chuck Barry beat and the chuck Barry guitar riff, its a really good song.<br />This may not be as good or as long or with as many songs as Exile On Main St. but Goats Head Soup is with out a doubt one of the best Rolling Stones albums of all time!but Goats Head Soup is with out a doubt one of the best Rolling Stones albums of all time!
B00004RF97|5.0|The opening scene of &quot;The Philadelphia Story&quot; catches your attention right away: in a sequence with no dialogue, we watch a married couple (Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn) engaged in a feisty argument.  Hepburn proceeds to throw Grant out of the house, snapping one of his golf clubs over her knee in the process.  His response is to reach out his hand and and shove her face, knocking her to the ground.  It's a priceless scene and is the perfect way to begin this wonderful film.<br />Socialite Tracy Lord (Hepburn) is planning to remarry, and she's desperately trying to keep the ceremony a secret from the press.  Enter her ex-husband Dexter (Grant), who agrees to help a reporter (Jimmy Stewart) and his photographer sneak into the wedding for an unknown motive (which is eventually revealed).  Once they arrive at the estate, Stewart's character begins to fall for Tracy, and she winds up with three men vying for her attention.  Ultimately, Tracy has to make a choice between her fiancee, her ex-husband, and her new photographer friend.  The ending is sweet and is probably what everyone who watches the film will want to see happen, but the script is written so well that it keeps you guessing until the very end.<br />The chemistry between Grant and Hepburn is amazing, and their scenes together are highly entertaining.  Hepburn originated the role of Tracy Lord on Broadway, and Grant's sharp wit us an excellent match for Hepburn's brassy independence.  It's too bad that they don't make great movies like this anymore.
B00005UKE0|5.0|I am a huge fan of the Beatles, but every once in awhile I get angry with John and Paul.  Why didn't they let George contribute more?  George Harrison is and always will be my favorite Beatle.  While both Paul and John were also musical geniuses, I prefer George as a person.  He was always so understated and sort of shy about his amazing ability to write great songs like 'Something', 'Here Comes the Sun', 'While My Guitar Gently Weeps', 'Taxman' and 'Think for Yourself'.  At the end of the Beatles career, George started stealing the show on every album they released.  Clearly, he was a great writer but he was forced to only contribute two or three songs to each album.  Thank God for 'All Things Must Pass'.  This is my favorite album of all time.  Even better than any Beatles albums.<br />Every song on this album is an absolute masterpiece.  I'm not going to talk about the extra features on the re-release because, to tell you the truth, I don't really like them.  In fact, I burned the album onto a single CD, omitting the second verison of 'Isn't It a Pity' for the fabulous 'I Live for You' (which should have been on the original album). <br />Most people who are reviewing this album seem to be talking about 'Isn't It a Pity' as the best song.  However, I think that spot if for 'Run of the Mill', 'Apple Scruffs' or 'Awaiting on You All'.  The latter two will make you grin a mile wide, while 'Run of the Mill' always makes me cry.  Brilliant.<br />This is an essential album for anyone.  It is so wonderful.  Rest in Peace, George, and thank you for giving us such beautiful music.
B000089RVX|1.0|Lead singer Amy Lee's incescent howling and bellowing of these mainstream, over-commercialized lyrics and generic riffs, proves once again that good music in today's Rock-Alternative Genre is indeed hard to find.  If I could, I would give this CD -3 stars.  Horrid beyond words can describe.  Within a year, this band will thankfully be forgotten.  The band's ready-made goth look only adds to debachery and rancid fluff of commercial rock.  (...)heheheh..Ladies and Gents..the modern day spinal tap is Evanescence.  The reasons would be too long and many why you should avoid this album, but let me sum it up for you..if you have any creativity whatsoever, and enjoy good original tunes in the alternative rock genre, go with a band like Dredg.  It's a fresh sound, and it has soul.  If you like commercial pop you will probably like this album, and will probably be on your way to buy the new Linkin Park CD as well.. if thats your thing, then fine, but I'll choose my own music, thank you.
B000003TA4|5.0|I remember when, in 1991, I first watched Nirvana's &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; video on MTV, and the way it blew me away. Although it may sound (and look) dated for the first-time listener, Nirvana's music was a breakthrough at the time. <BR>Back then the top 10 videos were from acts such as Skid Row, Poison, Extreme, Bon Jovi and so many other look-alikes whose music was, just like in the pre-punk seventies, focused on complex arrangements, flawless recordings, instrument virtuosos and, consequently, lacked the passion and honesty which are the very spirit of rock n roll and music itself. <BR>Smells Like Teen Spirit sounded so fresh and so raw that it didn't take long for me, a 11-year-old kid at the time, and so many of my generation to grow an interest for that power trio called Nirvana. Soon the band became the icon of the rise of alternative music - through the grunge movement - to the mainstream, with Nevermind as their masterpiece. <BR>Thanks to this album, today's music sounds the way it does, and even the aforesaid bands tried to sound as raw and as passionate as Nirvana.
B000002L68|5.0|PURPLE RAIN is alot of peoples minds, is the crown jewel of PRINCE'S career. Now I will admit that this album still sounds fresh 20 years later, and it has stood the test of time real well. NOt many albums can be relevent after 20 years, but this one is. On this album we have quite a collection of classic PRINCE songs in one place, you might not need to have another PRINCE album in your collection. YOu want great songs, here the are:  LETS GO CRAZY, PURPLE RAIN, WHEN DOVES CRY, these are the big 3 off this album that were all over the radio. TAKE ME WITH YOU, THE BEAUTIFUL ONES, DARLING NIKKI, I WOULD DIE 4 U/BABY I'M A STAR round out this album well. The only track that I dont realy get into is COMPUTER BLUE, for some it is a great track, but for my taste it is only mediocre. Still I give this album 5 stars and highly recommend that you add it to your collection
B0001BKAEY|2.0|I wonder when they realized they didn't have any more plot? This movie totally stunk. It was actually boring, which is hard given all the special effects at their diposal. Damn, what a disappointment. Seriously, if you loved the matrix, don't see it... it will be better this way trust me.
B00018D44U|1.0|I bought this CD impulsively -- it was on a rack near the cash register at a store I was in.  I trust the first album was a lot better because this one was boring, repetitive and tedious.  Extremely disappointing.
B000002LK1|5.0|Depeche Mode has always been considered a unique band by this reviewer although admittedly I had never purchased a Depeche Mode album until very recently. ''Violator'' hasn't left my CD player since I bought it. Yes it's that good. Like most listeners, I suspect, I hadn't heard of The Mode until ''Enjoy My Silence'' hit the airwaves around 1990. Despite having released other superb records (I bought ''Music For The Masses the other day), ''Violator'' is still considered their best album by many. I still feel the need to explore more of their work before I can testament to that. Nearly 14 years after the release of ''Violator'', Depeche Mode is still regarded as one of the most creative and interesting bands of the last two decades or so and they are known for their brilliantly concert tours as well.<br />So why is ''Violator'' regarded as an classic album by so many music listeners? ''World In My Eyes'', ''Sweetest Perfection'', ''Personal Jesus'', ''Enjoy The Silence'', ''Policy Of Truth'' and ''Clean'' are simply great synth-pop with great hooks and ambiguous lyrics. Those offering are what makes ''Violator'' an essential buy for all music enjoyers. <br />My favourites:<br />''World In My Eyes'' is a mood-setter for the album, almost introducing the listener to a journey into the Mode's world. Its dark tone, yet danceable beat makes you wonder what you will be listening too for the next 45 minutes or so. Up next, ''The Sweetest Perfection'' starts off sounding very fervently, yet it develops into a melancholic slow-burner. I really enjoy the dreamy vibe they managed to inject into the music, making the listener almost feel ''The Sweetest Perfection''. ''Personal Jesus'' remains one of my favourite songs of all time. Despite having heard it numerous times, I still enjoy the stamping gem. ''Enjoy The Silence'' is an upbeat ballad with an amazing guitar rife . Dave Gahan's voice with its haunting and warm quality blends perfectly with the dreamy melody. Who can anybody not like this tune? It's possible one of the most recognised and most loved songs ever. ''Policy Of Truth'' was an instant favourite of mine and I think it's among the three best tracks on the album. Its catchy and great hook will have the listener waiting more. ''Clean'' is an haunting ballad with a dark sound attached to it and Dave Gahan sings it wonderfully.<br />''Violator'' consists of nine superb tracks with great melodies and thought-provoking lyrics. In all honesty there are no fillers on the album at all, which is quite rare these days. Perhaps that explains its ''classic status''. ''Violator'' is an album for everybody who enjoys brilliantly synth/pop combined with lovely melodies and enjoyable hooks. It's an essential purchase for any music lover. <br />Overall Grade: 9.5/10
0553582445|5.0|This is a fantastic book.  Laden with all of Hobb's characteristic intrigue and angst, I could not put it down.  However, Hobb's editors have done readers a disservice in the way they chose to market these books.  Although this is the beginning of a trilogy, to fully enjoy it you should have read six books previously.  <BR>First, the Farseer Trilogy, starting with Assassin's Apprentice, which gives you the story of Fitz's life to date.  Failing to read this trilogy will seriously impact the reading enjoyment of Fool's Errand.<BR>Then, the Liveship Traders Trilogy, starting with Ship of Magic.  It is not utterly essential that you read the Liveship Traders trilogy to understand this one, but this trilogy contains many spoilers, and it seems a shame to waste the reading enjoyment to be gathered from the Liveship Traders trilogy by reading them out of order.<BR>Finally, enjoy this trilogy.  It ties together many of the threads left hanging in the previous two.
B00006LIRI|1.0|The second U2 \\"best of\\" was a waste of time. The first one, \\"The best of 1980-1990\\" was a pretty good compilation, but quite short ( 65 minutes, U2 could have added 2 extra songs like Gloria, Out Of Control or MLK ). This time, this compilation is 50% horrible. <BR>The hands that built America is so boring, one of the worst U2 songs, without a doubt. All the remixes are so bad !!!!. This is overall a big, big mistake. This is not the best of. I remember once participating in a U2 poll, in which they asked to the fans the best song from each album, before this \\"best of\\". One of those songs was \\"Please\\"... so where is this song ??? why U2 didn't include it ??. I don't know why U2 keep putting \\"Until The end Of The World\\" as one of their best songs. \\"The Fly\\" or \\"Who's Gonna Ride...\\" were real songs for a \\"Best Of\\".<BR>This would be my \\"Best of 1990-2000\\"<br />1-  Even Better Than The Real Thing<BR>2-  Mysterious Ways<BR>3-  Beautiful Day<BR>4-  Electrical Storm <BR>5-  One<BR>6-  Miss Sarajevo ( COMPLETE )<BR>7-  Stay ( faraway so close )<BR>8-  Stuck In A Moment You Can't Get Out Off<BR>9-  Lemon<BR>10- Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses<BR>11- The Fly<BR>12- Discotheque ( ORIGINAL )<BR>13- Hold me, Thrill me, Kiss me, Kill me<BR>14- Staring At The Sun ( ORIGINAL )<BR>15- Please ( single )<BR>16- If God Will Send His Angels ( single )
0553801546|4.0|This is the stirring conclusion to the saga of Fitz, first begun in Assassin's Apprentice.  Dutiful, the prince that Fitz serves, has sworn to give Elliania, a woman of the Out Islands, the head of the dragon Icefyre as a betrothal gift.  However, the Fool, Fitz's greatest friend who is also a prophet, believes that Icefyre should not be killed so that the race of dragons may be allowed to continue.  In addition, the Fool has predicted his own death in the Out Islands and Fitz is determined to see this prediction made wrong.  As with all Hobb's stories, this creates layers and layers of intrigue, where everyone has dual and triple motives in everything they do, and it is up to Fitz to find the heart of the matter and make the proper decisions.<BR>As with her previous stories, this one is well written and engaging.  It did drag a bit in parts, especially where Fitz re-explored well-worn emotional ground with no new resolutions.  Also, especially for such a long novel coming out of such a long series, I found the end to be rushed and the rationalization behind it quite disappointing.  Thus, a rating of four stars rather than five.<BR>That said, if you have made it all the way through the previous eight books, there is no reason not to read this one as well.  If you have not read the previous books (including the Liveship Traders trilogy), you should read them before this one or most of the fun of a very enjoyable series will be spoiled for you.
B000001F5F|4.0|Despite this EP ( 35 minutes long aprox ) shows an EXCELLENT early U2, this is not actually a &quot;Live&quot; album. Contains songs from 3 different performances ( Boston, Denver and St Goarshausen, 1983 ), most of them from Germany ( 5 songs ). This album includes AWESOME versions of &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot; and &quot;New Year´s Day&quot; ( both far better than red rocks ). But is a shame the fact this is not a complete live album, as it mean to be. Also contains a few editing ( Bono´s speech before Sunday Bloody Sunday and other ones ). <BR>I remember recently on [...] a GREAT IDEA for an Album release. It´s about something like the real Under A Blood Red Sky album, containing the whole concert played in Loreley Festival, Germany August 20, 1983. Since 5 songs were from this concert on the original Ep, that idea would be something really cool, because we would have a real live album for the first time.<BR>I really waiting for that version instead !!!!!!
0385504209|5.0|A terrific and suspensful &quot;novel&quot; which takes the reader through the twists and turns of a 2,000 year old mystery playing out in todays high tech environment.  This is a great &quot;story&quot;...foget the hype about what it says or doesn't say about Christianity and the hypersensitive who can't handle any criticism fictional or otherwise.  Dan Brown has not said anything in this book that others have not said for centuries, he just does in a great, readable, and enjoyable format.  It's a great book and a great read.
B0000TLA9G|3.0|Given Axl's unwillingness to release \\"Chinese Democracy\\",you probably can't blame Geffen for wanting to put out any new G&R product.Thus we get a \\"Greatest Hits\\" set that while containing the big hits like Sweet Child O' Mine,Patience,Welcome To The Jungle,Paradise City and November Rain,the disc is rather unbalanced,giving more room to latter-day material than the band's reckless,raucous early work like It's So Easy,Mr. Brownstone and I Used To Love Her.(The album contains more songs from their dismal Spagetti Incident than their G&R Lies album.Also such UYIs 1 and 2 cuts like Estranged,Dead Horse,Garden Of Eden,14 Years and Breakdown are absent as well.)Futhermore the disc's high quintent of ballads,epics and cover songs(Knockin On Heaven's Door I can understand,but their horrible takes on Since I Don't Have You and Sympathy For The Devil-COME ON!)doesn't give a true picture of the raw,messy vitality Axl Rose,Slash and the boys delivered in its prime.While \\"Greatest Hits\\" may have great remastering,most folks will(and should)be content with \\"Appetie For Destruction\\" and the \\"Use Your Illusion\\" albums rather than this skimpy and unsuccessful compilation.It's time for [to] release a new one!
0385504209|3.0|If you live in America and haven't been under a bridge the past 8 months, you have no doubt see the Da Vinci Code in stores and heard the raging controversy surrounding the novel. The book has found it's way onto nighttime news programs and sparked controversy in churches, and has reigned over the New York Times best seller list for 40+ weeks.  So what's all the fuss about?  The sensitive subject matter of the role of Jesus Christ.<br />  With renewed secular interest in Christ peaking with Mel Gibson's \\"The Passion of the Christ\\" the subject matter of \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" has struck a chord of interest in many many people around the country.  This book has even brought the book \\"Holy Blood, Holy Grail\\" written in 1983 back to the top of many best seller lists!  Obviously, the Da Vinci Code is making the rounds.<br />  The problem I have is that when you look past the controversial subject matter, the book just isn't balanced and parts of it seem downright contrived.  If you haven't read Angels and Demons(a superior book in my opinion), the character of Robert Langdon is severely underdeveloped for a main protagonist.  And once you reach about the halfway point, instead of the characters following an intriguing path of clues, you just get them sitting around trying to figure out the Cryptex codes, interrupted with the requisite police chases.<br />  That's not to say there are no positive things about the novel.  Far from it.  The hook the book sets is very intriguing(which may add to the dissapointment of the rest of the book), Dan Brown has a great writing style, and the finale contains some great revelations, however it is dissapointing that Langdon never really does reach the ultimate prize.<br />  Overall, you could do alot worse than the Da Vinci Code, but you could do alot better too, i.e Dan Brown's three other novels.
1592400876|5.0|&quot;If there is one lesson that is to be learned from this book, it is that there is never a dull moment in the world of punctuation.&quot;  Perhaps that is hyperbole, but there is never a dull moment in _Eats, Shoots &amp; Leaves: The Zero Tolerance Approach to Punctuation_ (Gotham Books) by Lynne Truss.  Surely the book will not be the sensation it was in Britain, but it is witty, informative, and entertaining; you can't ask for more from a punctuation manual.  And if you do not yet think that punctuation is important, you will after you see all the misunderstandings a little comma can cause.  Take the peculiar title, which is from a joke: A panda goes into a caf&eacute;, orders a sandwich, eats it, takes out a revolver, fires it into the air, and goes out.  When the waiter calls to ask what is going on, the panda plunks a badly punctuated wildlife manual onto the table and growls: &quot;Look me up.&quot; The waiter finds the entry: &quot;PANDA. Large, black-and-white, bear-like mammal native to China. Eats, shoots and leaves.&quot;  Oh, let's have one more.  There was an American actor playing Duncan in _Macbeth_, listening with concern to the battle story of a wounded soldier, who cheerfully called out: &quot;Go get him, surgeons!&quot;  Misplaced comma;  it should of course be: &quot;Go, get him surgeons!&quot;  Another story related here, a true one, shows that a comma can literally be a life-or-death matter.<br />The book is zero tolerance indeed.  Truss says it doesn't matter if you have a PhD and have read all of Henry James twice, &quot;If you still persist in writing, 'Good food at it's best', you deserve ...&quot; and she lists some ghastly punishments.  Such militantism surely qualifies her for the Apostrophe Protection Society, a real organization that (along with Truss) is horrified by commercial signs that announce &quot;Antique's&quot; or &quot;Apple's&quot;.  The recent film _Two Weeks Notice_ gives her recurrent fits.  She wants to know if they would have called it _One Weeks Notice_.  She suggests that we enlist in the apostrophe war, arming ourselves with correction fluid, stickers to cover superfluous apostrophes, and markers with which to insert omitted ones.  But best of all, she gives, simply and generously, the rules that will guide one in any apostrophic situation.  Plus there is history.  In Shakespeare's time, the apostrophe only indicated omitted letters, as it still does in &quot;doesn't.&quot;  Then in the 17th century printers put it in front of singular possessive &quot;s,&quot; and in the 18th they put it after the plural possessive &quot;s,&quot; and here we are.<br />You can turn to this little volume for guidance on the dash, hyphen, colon, semicolon, and more.  The rules are here.  American readers should note that theirs is a reprint of the British edition, without changes to spelling or punctuation.  Often Truss mentions the differences, but she would vehemently deny that this shows that punctuation rules are arbitrary.  Punctuation &quot;... is a system of printers' marks that has aided the clarity of the written word for the past half-millennium.&quot;  The conventions evolved slowly, in conversation between printers and readers.  Truss worries that printing will decline in our e-age.  A printed book has been edited and fussed over, but e-mail often does not even bother with capital letters.  Truss thinks that since punctuation represents an effort of a considerate writer to guide a reader into a correct interpretation, the lack of e-punctuation has lead to clumsy explanations, like &quot;Just kidding!&quot; or even &quot;JK!&quot; having to be added to get a tone across, or the (to her) grievous incorporation of her beloved punctuation into emoticons or smileys.  &quot;Punctuation as we know it... is in for a rocky time,&quot; she says.  But her book is a call to sticklers like herself: &quot;I am all the more convinced we should fight like tigers to preserve our punctuation, and we should start now.&quot;  This delightful style manual has been turned into a manifesto by an author in love with her subject.ld start now.&quot;  This delightful style manual has been turned into a manifesto by an author in love with her subject.
0385504209|1.0|My sister, an avid reader as I am, said, &quot;You've GOT to read this book!&quot;  She failed to see it as fiction, and thought it was based on real secret research. (And she is an intelligent reader and great lover of thrillers.)  This book ranks with The Red Tent in seriously disappointing books.  The story is based on an old, old heresy the Catholic school kids used to share on the back of the school bus--that Jesus had an affair with Mary Magdalene.  It takes the story a bit further than the nuns did (who may have shared that story just to make Jesus more 'human' and appealing to their students), suggesting that a daughter born of that liason inherited Jesus's Genes or something like that.  It's not clear.<br />Brown may have intended to appeal to feminists with the premise that the early Christian church was headed by Mary Magdalene, after Christ ascended, and that some young woman of her line still exists as a secret leader of the underground Christian church, but this idea is so fuzzily presented as to look like a ploy to appeal to women readers.  I found it insulting.<br />Like the much - touted Red Tent book, this is presented in a great cloud of detail, some of which adds to the fiction, most of which drags it down. It is hard to keep focused on the point of the story. It gets hard to even identify the point of the story. And, as with The Red Tent, it was a passable story until about mid-way, then it falls flat -- just too stupid to merit the hype.  I did finish the book.  I wanted to see whether it got better later.  It didn't.  It was lame at best, and a waste of time.  One star is really too high a score for this tale.

He toots his own horn a lot. But there's not much behind the noise.<br />There have been a number of exposes written about Kiyosaki. A little research and you'll find them easily.

B000002UJQ|2.0|The tailor has fooled you all into loving this pretentous twaddle.  But look closer; behind all the hype the emperor is naked.<br />Radiohead is far better than the average band.  Their other albums of electronic or ambient rock prove it.  But when this collection of a couple songs, mixed with a lot of irritating noise, came out, somebody you respect was too afraid of not liking something abstract to admit that most of this just isn't suitable for listening.  <br />doing the opposite of what the rock formula tells you to do does not make you a musical genius, you have to also write something enjoyable.<br />go ahead and say this review wasn't helpful, but bear in mind it's an honest opinion.

1592400876|3.0|Based upon the publicity, I thought we'd get a pot pourri of examples of poor grammar in published material, but in fact there were few examples of this.<br />As it says on the flyleaf, this is indeed a book for people who love punctuation and get upset about it. <br />However, it can seem over-long in places. 33 pages on the Apostrophe was interesting, but 35 pages on the comma was exhausting &amp; exhaustive. The colon, semicolon, dash, brackets, ellipsis, italics, exclamation mark, question mark, hyphen &amp; emoticons all feature to good effect - but the ampersand was nowhere to be seen?<br />4* for the idea, and 3* for the result.<br />If you want to more readily know what to do when, I recommend the Style Guide from the Economist.
0156027321|5.0|When I first heard about Life of Pi, I thought the plot (all I knew was it was about a kid stranded on a lifeboat) sounded boring. My mom read it &amp; reccomended it to me, then my brother did the same, so I decided to give it a try. I'm so glad I read it!! It is about so much more than I thought it was.<br />This novel left me thinking about it for days after finishing, and I would love to reread it some day. I think I would pick up on even more the second time around. <br />I would reccomend this book to anyone who likes to think about the books they read, or to anyone who loves good fiction.
B00006DEFA|2.0|I have always been a major fan of this movie. I got the first DVD a couple of years ago but it was a bit of a hassle to get up in the middle and turn it over. I was excited by the new two disc version in which the entire movie was now on one side. GREAT I thought. Then the extra scenes popped in which totally were unnecessary and detracting from the plot. Gratuitous nudity and thin scenes that should have been left on the film edit floor. I cant understand what they substatially did for this great movie other than significantly dilute it. I guess I'll go back to my first DVD and just take a popcorn break when I have to get up and chnage sides
B0001HAHXW|5.0|What a combination: Eric Clapton and the music of his inspiration, Robert Johnson. It doesn't get any better than this.
B00000JLWW|5.0|I can't get enough of the whole Titanic thing. I have 4 DVDs (soon to be 5, with a DVD on the Britannic too!), 3 videos, about 12 books, the script signed by James Cameron... I'm a scary lady! I just can't get enough of it! And I'm even sad enough to have an animated DVD of the Titanic, made for kids. Hey, it's fun!<br />What is most depressing about this DVD is the severe lack of extras. You get a pretty average trailer, and that's it! James Cameron is normally well known for his great extras on DVD (the first two Terminators come to mind). There have been rumours about a special edition coming out hopefully in time for Christmas (someone I know has to keep reassuring me that it will come out!) So I'm hoping and praying for that, as the extras are pretty lousy, for a James Cameron DVD.<br />I absolutely adore this movie. It still gets me every time I watch it, and although I've never actually cried, I do get a bit teary, but I have to watch, cos everytime I watch it, I've normally got all my makeup on! The whole relationship between Jack &amp; Rose (a relationship which has been copied in many other movies about the Titanic) is so sweet, although they may seem in love, Rose only says it to Jack once and that's when they're both in the water. He never responds - which makes him seem like a bit of a jerk to be honest. But that's the only low point that Jack's character has. Kate Winslet and Leo DiCaprio are perfect as Jack &amp; Rose, although they could have been any of these actors/actresses: Matthew McConaughey, Gwyneth Paltrow, Michael Biehn (as Cal Hockley, which could have been cool), Christian Bale and Macaulay Culkin. Kate has to appear completely naked in front of Leo (very embarrassing), but she flashed him when they first met to break the ice! When Jack draws Kate, it's actually James Cameron's hands. In post-production, Cameron, who is left-handed, mirror-imaged the sketching shots so the artist would be appear to be right-handed, like Leonardo DiCaprio.<br />James Cameron got the idea for his own Titanic movie after watching A Night To Remember (a pretty average Titanic movie if you ask me, I mainly don't like it, cos it's in black &amp; white!), and spent 5 years researching Titanic. There are many similarities between A Night To Remember &amp; Titanic. A number of scenes are arranged and in some cases scripted almost identical. This is particularly true of these scenes: Thomas Andrews telling Capt. Smith the sinking is &quot;a mathematical certainty&quot;; the Titanic's band preparing to depart at the end, only to turn around and regroup as Hartley begins playing 'Nearer My God to Thee' by himself (though a different version of the song is used in the 1958 film); a shot of Ismay in a lifeboat as the Titanic sinks behind him; Thomas Andrews looking at a painting as Titanic prepares to sink; and Andrews encountering a man by the Grand Staircase and telling him the ship is doomed (in Cameron's film, he tells Rose).<br />A very creepy fact: there actually IS a J. Dawson (Joseph), who was on the Titanic and died. Cameron only discovered this after the script was finished that there had been a real &quot;J. Dawson&quot; who died aboard the Titanic. This &quot;J. Dawson&quot; was trimmer Joseph Dawson, who had been born September 1888 in Dublin, Ireland. His body was salvaged and buried at Fairview Lawn cemetery in Nova Scotia with many other Titanic victims. Today, his grave stone (#227) is the most widely visited in the cemetery, all thanks to the movie!<br />Something else which is quite disappointing about this movie is that the Californian,which had stopped for the night due to the ice hazard and was within sight of the Titanic throughout the sinking, is not featured at all. (Californian's ice warning had been received and sent to the bridge but was not placed in the chartroom.) Many other Titanic movies, most notably the TV version, starring Catherine Zeta Jones &amp; Peter Gallagher, rely heavily on the Californian scenes when the Titanic is sinking.<br />Gloria Stuart also stars, as the 'Old Rose'. Really, she's only 86, but she had to be aged to 101, which can't have been a pleasant experience - what a scary thought!<br />This is a terrific movie. Most people love it, although you get the occasional review, especially on here, saying that it's not good. But it's the whole romance about it, and the whole history of it. I am now eagerly awaiting the special edition, otherwise I'll be having words with James Cameron personally!

B000002KO3|5.0|It's difficult to judge this album on any conventional terms. It's difficult to compare it to anything - to say that it's so much better in such-and-such a way. It's a complete break with every convention, not just in the industry but with the band's history, and it's like no other work of art I can think of, no matter what the medium.<br />There are no love songs here. Every track pushes the envelope of theme, let alone style, exploring dark and unknown territory. The treatment of every subject is eerie and unsentimental. 'The Listening Wind' is the story of a nationalist revolutionary (not Japanese, though the title would suggest that), while 'Seen and Not Seen' details a man's idea that he can change his physical appearance through force of will. What separates it from a lot of modern stuff is the skill with which it achieves this transcendence - it never seems forced or affected; you feel as though Byrne knows what he's talking about, even when you don't know what he's talking about. And the songs sound great. 'Born Under Punches' and 'The Great Curve' are grand, soaring, operatic; the dead pulse of 'The Overload' feels like hypnotism. Talking Heads have created something really extraordinary here; it can't and shouldn't be compared with anything, but experienced.
6304711905|5.0|Tombstone is without a doubt the best Western ever made.  Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer give the perfomance of their lives.  This is a film that delivers everything a movie should: action, drama, more action, intrigue, more action, stunning visuals, more action...you get the point.<br />Val Kilmer plays Doc Holliday better than the original Doc. Holliday, I bet.  In fact, the whole cast did an amazing job of rising to the same level - near perfection.<br />I don't see how any Western could top this one.  The only drawback to this movie is the fact that the entire cast can never top what they did in this masterpiece, NEVER!  Ya hear me?  I said NEVER!<br />I am going to see what other movies George P. Cosmatos has directed, so I can see if the rest of his work is as good.<br />If you haven't seen Tombstone, you're really missing out - push that buy button and enjoy.<br />Peace-out!<br />[...]
B000002KNY|2.0|I know that David Byrne said something like, 'The better a singer's voice is, the harder it is to believe what he's saying.' To some extent I agree, but 'Fear of Music' (and a lot of Talking Heads' earlier catalogue, to me) is just unlistenable. His voice is twitching all over the place; it's irritating. That, and the music and lyrics aren't that strong; there's no substance in a song like 'Mind.' I find it hard to believe that they followed this alubm with the incredible 'Remain in Light;' it's like listening to two different bands. I know that they were capable of better - just compare this 'Life During Wartime' and 'Heaven' with the live versions on Stop Making Sense, and you'll see what I mean.<br />That song 'Animals' is funny, though.
B000056H24|5.0|This is a great companion to &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot; that focuses on the teachings and man that was Jesus Christ.  Max von Sydow's Jesus has a commanding presence that is missing in the other portrayals. His voice can boom with the voice of God when it wants to, and can also grow soft and soothing. His appearance is also more believable than the surfer dude Christ of &quot;King of Kings,&quot; or the waif-like, wimp that was &quot;Jesus of Nazerath.&quot; Von Sydow tows the line between a carpenter who is afraid of his power in some places, and God on earth, who has the ability to perform miracles and move the masses.<BR>  A criticism of this movie is all the cameos that take place, but that's rubbish.  It doesn't affect the movie at all, mostly becasue the cameos are not distracting on account that the actors are not as recognizeable in this day and age.  Charlton Hesston gives the definitive John the Baptist, intimidating, slightly mad, but ultimately a mysterious tool of God calling out to Herod even after death.<BR>The scenery and music is also breathtaking, and if you're not moved by this movie there is something wrong with you.  Watch this movie after &quot;The Passion.&quot; The Greatest Story Ever Told is the best portrayal of Jesus and a deserves more credit for being ahead of it's time.
B000002LCK|5.0|Better versions of the songs which are already New Order's best; it's incredible. One of the reasons why NO's albums might not always seem up to snuff is that the music was designed, a great deal of it, for the dance floor, and you don't get the full effect sitting in front of your computer in a drafty aparment. These single mixes, though, are so powerful that you begin to get a sense of what it feels like to listen to them surrounded by a writhing crowd in the modern religious ceremony of choice. The versions of Perfect Kiss and Bizzare Love Triangle are the most notable. It's hard to imagine how they could have allowed the public to hear the album versions, knowing that the songs could have been this much more. The break to ecstatic organ at the end of TPK - it's one of those moments where you feel your feet lifting off the ground, and the bridge, deleted from the album version, offers the elusive meaning of the title - &quot;The Perfect Kiss is the kiss of death&quot; - a line that made this fan of Yukio Mishima smile. The mix of Subculture is comparatively weaker, with a lot of unnecesary effects and secondary vocals, but the power of the original song remains. The earlier songs have too much of the Joy Division flavor for my taste, but are still of interest; 'Shellshock' and 'True Faith' are excellent. I'm not so up on the second side, and the instrumental remix of 'Perfect Kiss' seems unneccesary, but even the first side would be worth the double price.
0156012197|5.0|A lot years ago a man wrote a book that was a preview of  the deep crise that the people would  live. This man is Saint Exupery, in my opinion the best writer of france, him best book is \\"The little prince\\".    <BR>the book introduces characters of symbolisms: the king, the accountant, the gemetra, the fox, the rose, the solitary adult and the serpent, among others. The little prince lived alone in a planet of the size of a house that had three volcanos, two assets and an extinct. He also had a flower, flower of great beauty and equal pride. The pride of the rose that ruined the peacefulness of the world of the little prince it made him go to  a trip that brought finally to the Earth,  where found several characters that made him to discover the secret of what it is really important in the life. It is a work that display a deep change of values, that teaches as we made a mistake in the evaluation of the things and of the people that surround us and like those judgements to take us to the solitude. We surrendered to our daily concerns, we became adult in a definitive way and forget the child that we went.
B000002L82|3.0|I don't understand why people seem to consider this album a classic, or New Order's best. Summer's voice just hasn't quite matured yet, as evidenced on 'We All Stand' and 'Ultraviolence' and others; he still sounds uncertain. Lyrically, as in the future, many of the songs are weak; a lot of them are just vaguely existentialist nonsense laid over some pretty music. It seems like the pall of Joy Division is still over them - the same dreary mood, without the genius of Curtis to make it work.<br />That said, the only way it seems to me that you could form the idea of this album being a classic is if you only listened to the first track, 'Age of Consent,' which is a masterpiece in every way; music, vocals, lyrics. 'Blue Monday,' of course, is also strong, and 'The Village' is a catchy and endearing track, with more interesting lyrics than most. The others songs, though, have either decent lyrics or strong music, and some are just unlistenable. I don't think that by any means New Order peaked with this album; God help the if they did. Thankfully, they kept evolving.
B0001BKAEY|5.0|What happens when you bring an intellectual movie trilogy to be viewed by the public?  You get a bunch of unintellectual people criticizing the movie for its action, drama, plot, acting, etc.  If your looking for a movie trilogy to give its answers on a silver platter this isn't the movie trilogy for you.  When your watching the Matrix trilogy you have to pay attention to every detail and to everything that it said.  For an example; in Matrix Reloaded (The second movie) a lot of people were complaining about the fact that Zion, that last human city built under ground, had all this technology to have in an underground city but the people that lived there had no shoes.  (You specifically notice that people don't have any shoes during the dancing scene, otherwise known as the \\"rave scene\\") If you pay close attention you will notice that people are wearing shoes before they walk into the under ground cave in Zion.  It doesn't show everyone taking off their shoes.  The only scene that shows somebody taking off their shoes is \\"The Kid,\\" the young boy who admires Neo, The One, as a hero. He takes off his shoes as he is entering the cave.  Now, I don't know why everyone takes off their shoes before entering the cave.  I figure it's because it's a sign of respect or the cave was considered to be a shrine, a place of gathering.  Like the ending of Matrix Revolutions, this  movie trilogy leaves you to decide for yourself.  Such a small thing like shoes make people decide that this movie trilogy is only worth one star.  What a joke.  Before watching the Matrix Trilogy remember to keep this in mind:<br />- Agent Smith is Neo's opposite.  So if Neo is \\"The One\\" then that would mean Agent Smith is \\"The Negative One\\" A positive one plus a negative one equal's zero.<br />- The people inside the Matrix with special abilities and powers are programs, they are not real people.  The two white ghosts in Matrix Reloaded where part of an older version of the Matrix. These ghosts are programs.  Also, the Merovingian and his wife, Persephone, are programs.  Persephone is a vampire, hence why she was feeding off Neo's emotions when she kisses him.<br />- Neo's life is the sum of a remainder of an unbalance equation inherent to the programming of the matrix.  He is the eventuality of an anomaly.  An anomaly is something that deviates from what is standard or normal.  Meaning Neo is different from everyone else.  He has special coding.<br />- There are patterns in life.  The Matrix that you watch throughout the Matrix trilogy is the sixth matrix.  Zion has been rebuilt five times.  Instead of repeating the pattern, Neo chose to save his love (Trinity).<br />- Life is about choices.<br />- In the first Matrix movie, if Neo did not make the \\"choice\\" to fly into Agent Smith coding toward the end of the movie than Agent Smith would have never been able to obtain the ability to replicate himself in Matrix Reloaded.  If Agent Smith couldn't replicate himself THAN Neo would have never made peace with machines in Matrix Revolutions.  So, if Agent Smith could not replicate himself and become a threat to the machine world than Neo could have never made the \\"choice\\" to make peace with the machine world and Zion would have been destroyed for the SIXTH time thus repeating the pattern.  But also keep in mind that Neo made the choice to save his love Trinity instead of going back to the source for the salvation of Zion and every other human being in the world in Matrix Reloaded.  Because Neo made this choice Zion would have been destroyed for the sixth and final time along with the extinction of the entier human race.<br />- Toward the end of Matrix Revolutions at the point where Neo is laying on the ground in water after the final battle against Agent Smith; Agent Smith says \\"he has seen this before.\\"  The reason he says that is because he obtained the Oracles ability to foresee.  If that's the case why didn't Agent Smith foresee his own deletion you ask?  Well, once avirus always a virus.<br />- As far as Neo being able to see without his eyes in Matrix Revolutions, that's for you to decide.<br />  Well that's it.  I'm not going to explain all the details of this superb trilogy.  This is most definitely a five star movie plus more.  Stop bad mouthing such a good trilogy folks.  Don't give it one star because you don't understand it thus subduing criticism in other area's such as acting, action, drama, the plot, etc.

Hendrix did more things on guitar in a short 4 year career that most guitarist could not do in 20 years. He is the best guitarist, and shall ever remain the best. Not one single person in 30+ years has toped Jimi Hendrix. Jimi Hendrix was the man to get me into playing the electric guitar now he got me experienced, and I have a band all thanks to Jimi Hendrix. Experience Hendrix will get you turned on to Jimi Hendrix's music. This greatest hits compilation includes all of the hits like Purple Haze, Foxy Lady, and Hey Joe. Also songs from Axis Bold As Love like Spanish Castle Magic, Little Wing, and Bold As Love. <br />Then their is the songs from the masterpiece that changed the face of rock n roll Electric Ladyland.....Songs like All Along The Watchtower, Crosstown Traffic, and Voodoo Child(Slight Return). So far this includes all of the three complete studio albums Are You Experienced, Axis Bold As Love, and Electric Ladyland. Then their is the songs most people have never heard like Dolly Dagger, and Freedom from First Rays Of The New Rising Sun Hendrix's last album that was uncomplete when he died. Then their is also the Star Spangled Banner performed Live at Woodstock. <br />This album covers all of hendrix's known greatest hits that everybody loves. I recomend this to all of the early hendrix listeners this one is for you. I do think their should have been some songs added to this including Machine Gun a highlight from Hendrix's career he performed at the new year of 1970. But wait their is more Jimi Hendrix albums that are either rare studio work or live like South Sentra Delta, BBC Sessions, and The Band Of Gypsy's. Once again BUY THIS~Highly Recomened!
0440238609|4.0|Many people have complained about the \\"atheist\\" or \\"agnostic\\" theme of these books. I say that they are wrong... there clearly IS a God in this book, he's just not a good guy. Instead, this book is a good way to introduce your child to early Christian thought, including that of the Gnostics, who seem to agree more with this book than atheists.<br />As far as the book is concerned, I always found it a little difficult to read, and the concepts were a bit slow going. If your kid doesn't like to be challenged, then he or she should not read this book. However, if you're willing to put a little bit of effort into reading, I think the payback is worth it. Children don't renounce their religion because of a book, not if they've been raised correctly.
B00009W0U4|4.0|First,hats off to the director for using various camera tricks and techniques in engaging the viewer. It took me a few minutes to realize why the camera lens was in a severe state of vertigo the first 15 minutes into the film. Thank goodness however the entire movie was not filmed using this technique ! Probably would have passed out. The reason for the swirling and sickening motion of the lens and the droning of the high tech synth sound of the soundtrack in the beginning is to capture   the madness of the moment of how one man and his friend are seeking vengeance for a heinous crime (rape) committed against his girlfriend. It also transports you into his head. <br />The entire story is told in a backwards sort of chronological order leading to previous possible events and circumstances that led to Monica Belucci's character becoming a rape victim. The rape scene is one of the most graphic I have seen in any film in my entire life ! You will begin to actually wonder if the scene indeed was real or not. The rape scene alone is one that can haunt the viewer for time to come. Other violent acts are just as equally shocking and extremely believable due to excellent makeup, special effects, and possible cg effects. There is frontal nudity of both male and female actors that may offend some viewers (this is definitely not for children, either)!<br />The biggest mind trick played on the audience is how the movie progresses in real viewing time, yet, you must keep in mind that the story is unfolding backwards. Hence leading to the beginning and not the end. As we follow Belluci's character and the others one soon almost forgets the first 15 shocking minutes of the film, including the underpass rape scene, and start to think that there is a happy ending. There is NO happy ending (nor beginning for that matter)...I went out on a limb to see this one, particularly since Roeper and Ebert raved about it. Well, in all honesty, it is a very brutal movie to sit through the first time and it is definitely not one I will be seeing again. Due to the filming and stroytelling techniques and all too realistic effects it does merit some attention but only by viewers who can stomach it !...

0553374842|4.0|Take the artistic talents of acclaimed production artist Ralph McQuarrie and the writing skills of prolific author Kevin J. Anderson (The Jedi Academy Trilogy) and you get The Illustrated Star Wars Universe, a coffee table book that gives readers a glimpse of the various planets showcased in George Lucas' original Star Wars Trilogy (1977-83).<br />Using McQuarrie's  production sketches and paintings for A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi and other Lucasfilm projects (including the Endor-based television specials of the mid-1980s plus preliminary sketches for the 1997 Special Edition updates), Anderson takes readers on a grand tour of the most important planets seen in the Luke Skywalker/Darth Vader half of the Star Wars Saga.  Starting with Tatooine, the desert world that is the home world to both Anakin Skywalker and his son Luke and ending with Alderaan, the planet where Princess Leia was hidden from her father and was doomed to be destroyed by the Death Star, eight planets are described in individual chapters, each told not by one omniscient narrator but by eight different observers, each with his or her point of view and/or political agenda.<br />For instance, while the chapter on Tatooine is an anthropologist's dispassionate and scientific report on the desert planet's hostile environment and its hardy inhabitants (ranging from the nomadic and hostile Tusken Raiders and scavenging Jawas to the resilient human moisture farmers and their homesteads), the description of Coruscant, the massive city-planet which was once the seat of power of the Old Republic and is the capital of Emperor Palpatine's Galactic Empire, is a pro-Imperial propaganda article authored by Pollus Hax, the Emperor's chief public relations expert and &quot;spin doctor.&quot;<br />Although much of the artwork featured in The Illustrated Star Wars Universe has been published elsewhere (either in the various Art of Star Wars books relating to the Classic Trilogy or in McQuarrie's Star Wars Portfolios), this combination of production paintings and Anderson's vivid and imaginative text works wonderfully and adds detail and background to both the movies and the post-Episode VI Expanded Universe novels, including Anderson's own JedI Academy trilogy and Darksaber.rie's Star Wars Portfolios), this combination of production paintings and Anderson's vivid and imaginative text works wonderfully and adds detail and background to both the movies and the post-Episode VI Expanded Universe novels, including Anderson's own JedI Academy trilogy and Darksaber.
0812550706|3.0|This book will keep you reading, the story of the space war is not new but is kind of different, the way that the Generals made that Ender fight the war and the way they trained him is excellent, it has many things that doesn't have to be written, for example that 6 years old kids didn't wanted to be naked, I think that it doesn't have to be any kind of nudity in this book, another thing is that even if Ender and everybody in that school were geniuses I think that they couldn't work so hard with any mental illness after that work.<br />The book is predictable in many parts, so if you read this book only to have a good time, like watching toons is ok, if you expect anything else, just skip it.<br />The end of the book is a little bit long.
0671027387|5.0|Deception Point was definitely a great book. It was chilling in some parts and action packed.  This book should have had the words &quot;Page Turner&quot; or &quot;Warning: After Picking up Reader Will Not Be Able to Put Down&quot; written across the cover because it deserved it.  It was written well and contained many different facets and ideas of which I was not aware.  The concepts concerning NASA and politics kept me awake all throughout the night, and I learned many new things.  I can only thank my wonderful physics teacher for not only recommending this book to me, but allowing me to borrow her copy of this thriller.
B00005JMJ4|4.0|As its title suggests, Sofia Coppola's Oscar-nominated film is the story of two lost souls who find one another in a foreign-speaking land (in this case, Tokyo).  Bob Harris is a world-famous action movie star from the 1970's who is in the city to appear in a commercial for a Japanese whiskey.  Charlotte is a young American woman in her twenties who has flown over from the states to be with her photographer husband while he does a shoot for a Japanese rock band.  Staying at the same luxury hotel, Bob and Charlotte eventually cross paths and find themselves irresistibly drawn to one another.<br />Bob and Charlotte are both introspective people, fully convinced that the lives they are leading are sterile, stifling and meaningless.  Bob, despite the obvious \\"success\\" he's enjoyed - fame, fortune and family - finds himself burned out and deeply dissatisfied with virtually every aspect of the life he's built for himself.  When we first meet Bob, he appears to be a man dragging himself through life, utterly unable even to feign the interest and enthusiasm that the people he meets expect of him.  In a brilliant performance, Bill Murray conveys this weary cynicism more through his body language and facial expressions than through words.  Indeed, it isn't until much later in the film - after he and Charlotte have found one another and have begun to communicate on an intimate level - that Bob is able to even halfway articulate what it is he is going though.  Charlotte, despite the fact that she is essentially just starting out in life, feels equally lost and rudderless, finding herself married to a man with whom she has little in common both intellectually and emotionally.  As Charlotte, Scarlett Johansson provides a poignant portrait of a woman who has so much to offer if only someone would be open enough to accept it.  Luckily for her, Bob comes along to do just that; unluckily, he is no more \\"available\\" than she is to make this relationship work.<br />As conceived by Coppola, \\"Lost in Translation\\" is more than just a tremendously sad evocation of unrequited love.  It is a heartrending tale about what happens when we not only marry the wrong person but end up meeting our soul mate when it is obviously too late to do anything about it.  As a writer, Coppola has opted to convey more of her meaning through silence and indirection than through dialogue and drama.  As a director, she often lingers for long periods of time over seemingly irrelevant details of daily life, creating a lyrical, poetic mood that enhances the melancholic tale she is telling.  The film sometimes feels more undernourished and less revelatory than it might have been had she allowed her characters to open up to each other in a more fully articulate way.  We sometimes feels as if Bob and Charlotte have so much more to say to each other - and to us - that we end up growing strangely impatient.  But then we just have to remind ourselves that that is the point Coppola is setting out to make here, that we can't always find the words to express the complexity of our feelings adequately and that sometimes we just have to find that special person who can understand us at our deepest level even without words.  That is what Bob and Charlotte do for one another as epitomized by that whispered bit of dialogue at the end that the audience is never intended to hear.  What Bob says to Charlotte we never know, but, whatever it is, it has meaning and significance only to her.<br />\\"Lost in Translation\\" demands a certain level of patience from its audience.  But anyone who can appreciate a subtle, beautifully acted and exquisitely directed character study should find many subsurface rewards in this film.la, \\"Lost in Translation\\" is more than just a tremendously sad evocation of unrequited love.

B000001FDK|5.0|If you've seen the movie, and love the music in it, pick up this single disc reissue of the original classic 2-LP album. I have the original record album and played it quite frequently. It's good to hnag on to, but in the past year I bought this single disc and don't have to worry about this getting worn out.<BR>All the original songs from the film are here. The songs are done in the style a typical '50s rock'n'roll song or ballad. The title track by Frankie Valli went to #1. Performers are John Travolta, Olivia Newton-John, the cast that's too long to <BR>mention and the nostalgic group Sha-Na-Na. &quot;Grease is the word!&quot;
B000002KMV|3.0|While this has some fine moments, especially the first 3 songs, like the title track, Sexuality, and Do Me Baby, you can here Prince breaking out of the urban, R& B funk, and getting into his guitar funk pop mix that will be more evident on this follow up 1999.  But if you're looking for good songs off of this stick with The Hits 1 & 2/B - Sides collection.
6300213668|5.0|Arguably, the best nostalgic musical. &quot;Grease&quot; finds John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John reunited in high school after a summer on the beach. They try to be like each other and impress each other in their own ways. John Travolta looks his best in this film. I think he WAS a natural-born greaser along with Henry Winkler. The movie does take you back in time to the '50s even though I wasn't born then, though from the movies I see, and the '50s music I hear, I don't doubt it. The movie was a 1978 box office hit. 20 years later, it was a hit all over again. Boy, I remember that! It was so popular again. I can't compare it to &quot;American Graffiti&quot; though. That's a classic that's just not appreciated enough by my generation. Getting back to &quot;Grease&quot;, if you like films of this genre, go for it, but don't go for &quot;Grease 2.&quot; It just doesn't cut it and was a flop. Greased lightning strikes once in the same place. It's right here!
B00005RIKI|5.0|Yes, yes, yes this is the one album you need to have even if your having more than one. Songs like &quot;Things goin on&quot; and &quot;Missippi Kid&quot; just don't make it on to them compilation albums. If you miss them you miss some of the reasons that Ronnie Van Zant's voice was so perfect and respected in this genre. Real root music right out of the South. This will take you from some sweet mandolin and Honky Tonk piano to soaring guitar licks all in 45 minutes or so. See where some of the copy cats got their inspiration. Gotta get it!!
B000089CJI|4.0|My friend let me borrow this CD on the bus and i thought it was amazing. I had never heard any music like it before. The beats and the lyrics were just amazing. I can't think of any other word to describe it. Listening to this album puts me in a good mood no matter what. I especially liked The District Sleeps Alone Tonight. I played this CD for a lot of my friends and all of them liked it which is not very common. I think everyone who liked music should listen to this CD.
B0001GOH6Q|3.0|it doesn't really work. i don't know exactly what it is about this film, but it's not great. it's alright,but it just doesn't go anywhere really special.<BR>it's not bad, but it's not good either.<BR>plus, it doesn't have the cool look of burton's other movies.
B00007FOMP|5.0|There are NO type of words to describe HOW beautiful this album is! I mean, people had been saying that for a while before I finally copped it around 2000 but when I finally heard the album with nine tracks in all its glory, I was floored! I mean, this is what a TRUE artist IS! Marvin Gaye is more than just a musical legend, he is a legend for the entire world. Each song he had done, he always knew how to invoke so much emotion, so much pain, so much hardship and still come out with a piece of beauty.<br />Save Sam Cooke and Al Green, no other artist turned R&amp;B upside down and made it personal better than the man hailed from the Chocolate City. With his 1971 album, &quot;What's Going On&quot;, Brother Marv went from singing about NEEDING love all the time to singing about WANTING love not only for himself but also for the entire world from ghetto to ghetto, backyard to yard, country to country. Forget Elvis, Marvin was truly a rock &amp; roll innovator. He proved Black artists can sing a full album full of personal anguish and make it touch you deep inside your heart.<br />No track is a filler and it's not so much the music but the message behind it that hits home. Telling a story of the singer's brother returning from Vietnam and asking that important question (&quot;What's Going On&quot;), his Rip-Van-Winkle sense of things-gone-by (&quot;What's Happening, Brotha?&quot;), his descend to drug abuse (&quot;Flying High In The Friendly Sky&quot;), and Marvin's own messages of trying to understand his place (&quot;Right On&quot;), trying to understand why the world is in such a disarray (&quot;Mercy Mercy Me&quot;), tormented because the children of the world are already going through terrible times while living in the ghetto (&quot;Save the Children&quot;) to accepting Jesus into his life and also asking those not to question His majesty (&quot;God Is Love&quot;) to embarking on a mission to conquer all hate (&quot;Wholy Holy&quot;) and finally exposing the truthof his surroundings as poetically as he could in the streets (&quot;Inner City Blues&quot;--which is his landmark single IMO, but it's hard to choose THE landmark since Dude has had so many &quot;landmarks&quot;). This album told a STORY. It wasn't all out there like the work from the Beatles and the Beach Boys, less raucous than music from the Rolling Stones and the Temptations (who was going through a &quot;psychedelic-soul&quot; phase) and was just as serene as the music that would be released soon afterwards from these acts:<br />Issac &quot;Black Moses&quot; Hayes<br />Curtis Mayfield<BR>His fellow Motown brotha, the Wonderful Stevie<BR>Leon Ware (who would also produce a classic album along with Marv five years afterward)<br />And much, much more.<br />It also paved the way for Black acts to personally write about their own troubles like a book and not so much about pleasing youngsters but pleasing the soul within us. After Sly Stone, Marvin Gaye helped bridged the gap in Black music. This album remains his ultimate landmark but he was just getting started. This will be his decade to shine. <br />You know the only bad thing about it is that the man who inspired a lot of R&amp;B, rock, pop, hip-hop and soul singers today is no longer with us to experience and tell us more stories about ourselves that before, we didn't have an idea or clue about, also his music is so timeless because the stuff that had happened when he recorded this in the late-'60s and early-'70s (Vietnam, civil rights movement, Black Panthers, etc), is still going on today in 2004 (Iraq, civil rights lawsuits, injustice among celebrities, the FCC, etc).<br />Long live Marvin P. Gaye, Jr. forever and ever! <br />My overall rating of this classic: 10+<br />As I said in the title, LEGEND is all that needed to be said! We love you and miss you, Marvin.
B00004Y9PP|4.0|It's a good movie.  It starts out fast and ends kinda alright, but I like it.  The computer graphics are alittle aged and the story and plot are pretty basic, but it's still good to watch.  Vin is still tough and sort of takes charge in the movie.  The other cast isn't that well known, but they are fimilar.  If your wondering what this movie is about, it's about civilians crashing on some planet realizing that they are not alone and  having to try and escape from these aliens which only come out when it's dark. I'm not going to say go buy it.  It's sort of an ify. But rent it out before in thinking of buying it.
B00005JMSE|3.0|This is one of those movies where the previews make it seem really exciting, and then when you get into the theater, it's a letdown.  I think the problem was the plot.  It was missing something.  Also, I felt a bit confused as to what was really happening towards the end.  I think if del Toro had left all of those monsters out, and concentrated on the main enemies (Rasputin, Kroenen, and that weird blonde chick), this would have been a LOT better!  Plus, the ending just seemed too clean and easy.  I was expecting Hellboy to have to do some real fighting.  LOL And what's up with the cats?!??!  I would recommend seeing it...but don't hold your breath.  Maybe the DVD will be better...but only if it has LOTS of extra features.
B0000CC5CS|4.0|This dvd is action packed, with a good story and amazing special effects.  There's things in this one that link it to the other two which makes the movie more interesting.  BUT!!!!  It doesn't have the same feeling behind it like the first and second one did.  It doesn't even have the same music like it had at the start of Terminator 1 and 2.  They only have two original actors from the 2nd movie.  Like Arnold and the main doctor from the psychiatric hospital.  That's it!!!!!  I know James Cameron didn't direct this movie, the style is not the same.  I didn't really like the female robot, her acting wasn't that good.  Arnold does it better.  There are a lot of good ideas in the movie and they work well but it just doesn't feel the same.  Don't get me wrong it's still a good attempt, but I didn't feel satisfied.  I bought the movie without renting it, but I'm not disapointed.  It's still a good movie.  GO BUY IT!!!!!!!
B0000DBJDM|2.0|Well first off, if your a Floyd fan that hasn't seen this, GET IT GET IT GET IT, cuz it features some great performances of early Floyd classics from the group in an intimate and historically interesting setting.  You'll love it.  It contains versions of &quot;Echoes&quot; and &quot;Careful With That Axe, Eugene&quot; that i personally think are superior to the original studio versions.<BR>  <BR>My beef is with the directing of the film.  For one thing, the editing is awful.  Usually with concert films like this, you try to at least roughly time all the scene changes on the downbeats within the music.  This was done (for the most part) very well and effectively in the original film, but on this directors cut he obviously wasnt even trying.  The scene changes are almost always either too frequent, akward, or just don't fit the mood.  <BR>The sound is certainly better than the VHS copy i have of the original film, but no amount of remastering can fix the low quality audio of the original tapes.  It's hardly distracting enough to make you want to turn it off, but it's a little dissapointing, especially after you hear Adrian Maben talk about how they went to great lengths to try and make it sound good... cuz it just doesnt.<br />Now, heres the obvious thing that other reviewers have pointed out... WHATS WITH THIS COMPUTER ANIMATION GARBAGE??  Its so cheezy and lame!  So is the whole concept he threw together of 'people from another planet coming to earth to watch the Floyd concert'.  Another sign that Mr. Maben just isnt a good filmmaker:  the opening scenes of &quot;Echoes&quot;, which is a whole computer animation sequence of planets, satellites, ect. , the objects orbit at WAY too fast of a speed.  It makes the music suddenly seem rushed, when its supposed to be the opposite.<br />Bottom line... most of the added scenes are very out of place and should not have been added.<BR>But, that said, there are some PLEASANT surprises as well.  Like all the never-before-seen b&amp;w interview sessions, intercut into the original scenes that show them recording &quot;Dark Side Of The Moon&quot;.<br />Again, if your a Floyd fan, not very familar with much of their pre-Dark Side material, its a MUST.
B000002UUX|5.0|Poppier than the older stuff, heavier than the newer stuff,Rust in Peace is a great example of all Megadeth's talents. Holy Wars, the opening track is an epic. It starts out with some slammin riffs, then turns into a ballad for a few minutes then comes out with some more bangin' riffs and some incredible solos. This is the first album to feature the classic lineup of Dave Mustaine, David Elefson, Marty Friedman and Nick Menza. One of the classic thrash albums up there with Metallica's Master of Puppets, Slayer's Reign in Blood, and Pantera's Vulgar Display of Power. A five star album all the way. Fav Tracks: Holy Wars.. The Punishment Due, Lucretia, Take No Prisoners.
B00005NGZX|5.0|There is probably no way my humble words could do this album any justice, it is just too good.  There is so much emotion in this, so much power it's heavy dude, real heavy.  The crown of this cd would have to be the title track &quot;Jane Doe&quot; one of the only 11 minute songs that I wish would last forever.  But let this review just state that this record will kill it is fierce and yet retains some texture and beauty despite the pounding drums and the hell screams heard throughout.  This record tears every band who claims to be hardcore apart.  All those loser &quot;screamo&quot; bands will be laid to waste as this genre defying band kills em'.  You can have emotion and complexity in hardcore without being a &quot;emo-core&quot; band.  From Autumn To Ashes and all those crap bands could never express this much emotion no matter how hard they tried.  Heard the rest?  Try the best that's my word.
B0001BKAEY|2.0|The final installment of this trilogy is proof that cgi does not a movie make.  Plenty of mindless action scenes for you fake-fight fans, lots of empty dialogue for you drama fans- they tried to cover all the bases and succeded in covering none.  This movie did evoke some reaction out of me- i was yawning the whole time.
0553565915|5.0|This book reminds me of Tiffany Snow's book - the love expressed here, and how we don't have to have a NDE to wake up the real reason for living -LOVE- is wonderfully simple. The joy and changes made in her life have helped us all have a glimpse of the bigger picture, and not sweat the small stuff.
0062502182|5.0|The book, the Alchemist told a very good message, and made me have some different views on life.  The book told of a boy named Santiago, who made his living as a shepard.  He was faced with a choice to follow his lifes journey, or to stay with his sheep.  I brought in teachings from the bible and also from the koran.  It showed many different views on life and how different people decide to choose their life. It gave me fulfillment in reading a book that could actually relate to my life outside of the story.  I would recommend this book to anyone as a good choice.
B0000CFW87|5.0|I first became captivated by this singer when he performed on Ally McBeal a couple of years ago.  He is so unlike the typical, crass, loud, brassy singers of today, who perform on those television contests and all sound so alike.  I am tired of those wavering voices that wobble all over the place when they sing - it seems to be a fad.  I enjoy Josh Groban's pure, clear style MUCH more.  He is sensitive, feels the songs, and even when he sings in a foreign language, I can tell what the song is about just by how he delivers the lyrics and the feeling he puts into it.
B0001BKAEY|5.0|The Matrix Revolutions fulfilled all my expectations as a non-conclusion to this brilliant postmodernist trilogy. It is actually quite unbelievable that a Hollywood studio could actually have produced such a brilliant movie. In fact the self congratulatory web of fluff productions, pandering critics and mindless movie going drones that is corporate American cinema very rarely lets anything like this slip through. This move is brilliant on so many levels and this is difficult to convey in words. People should experience the movie and all its 'petit ecrits' themselves. However I can reveal that the visual language of the Wachowskis is absolutely brilliant in this film and is in fact reminiscent of the great Fritz Lang at his best. However I can understand the backlash this movie has created since the multicultural and nonhierarchical philosophy of the Matrix movies threatens, like all postmodernism, the patriarchal war mongering WASP society's enslavement of the world.<BR>It is also clear that the ability to read and connect signs is rapidly diminishing, at least in the Western World. Most reviewers, even the professional ones, seem to have grasped only a insignificant portion of the multitudes of visual signs floating around in this movie. I think the trilogy would actually have been better understood a hundred years ago despite all its postmodernism.
B0000E6I1J|5.0|The CD and DVD were truly outstanding.  The indian music was a little tedious but enjoyable at times.  Anoushka Shankar is a very accomplished sitar player. I really enjoyed the monty python skits even if they seemed a little out of place on the DVD. I was very impressed with Jeff Lynne - especially his versions of Give Me Love and Handle with Care. <br />Billy Preston had the best performances of the concert.  His unbelieveable and moving rendition of My Sweet Lord would have made George proud. <br />I was not impressed with Tom Petty.  His voice sounded weak but it was good to see him there honouring George with his performance. <br />The performances of Paul McCartney and Eric Clapton were ok but not great.  Maybe they decided to let the other performers shine by giving understated performances.   <br />I was disappointed that Sam Brown's &quot;Horse to Water&quot; was not on the CD, considering she had one of the best performances.  <BR>  <BR>I like many people was very saddened when George passed away.  I found myself shedding a tear or two when he died and I'm not sure why.  Obviously, I never knew the man but from what I've seen and read about him, he seemed like a nice guy, well-respected and liked by everyone who always carried himself with dignity. He is truly one of the  most under-rated musicians and song-writers of all time. The CD and DVD showcase his prolific career.
B000066NW0|3.0|The first song &quot;Losing grip&quot; is great! The songs that were played on the radio (&quot;complicated&quot;, &quot;im with you&quot;) are just ok, and the rest of the album is weak. Maybe the next album will be better...
B00001ODGR|5.0|Too many reviews are by people who want to be critics. Speaking as a Styx FAN, this DVD is INCREDIBLE!!! The only problem I have with it is that it should be LONGER!!! The rendition of &quot;Renegade&quot; is electrifying!!! I felt 15 years younger the first time watching it. Since Amazon doesn't list the songs on the disc, here they are...<BR>Rockin' the Paradise<BR>Blue Collar Man<BR>Too Much Time On My Hands<BR>Snowblind<BR>Suite Madame Blue<BR>Crysal Ball<BR>Grand Illusion<BR>Fooling Yourself<BR>Show Me The Way<br />Boat On The River<BR>Loreli<BR>Babe<BR>Miss America<BR>Come Sail Away<BR>Renegade<BR>The Best Of Times
B00001IVOF|5.0|Before the commercialism and inconsistancy of Infamy, Mobb Deep had a couple of classics.  &quot;Hell On Earth&quot;(the second classic behind &quot;The Infamous&quot;) continued to move in the same direction as their first album.  To sum it up, it's typical Murda Musik.  I admit that I'm not a big fan of the shoot'em up, kill everybody type of music, but it's something about Mobb Deep.  Prodigy's(before he became lazy) lyrics and Havoc's beat just always seem to make a marraige.  Do yourself a favor and cop this album.
0553801546|4.0|A truely excellent finish to a very fine series. Hobb masterfully weaves together both major an minor points from all of her previous books to deliver a satisfying conclusion.
076790592X|5.0|My sister gave me this book for my birthday, and when I read it one insomia-driven night, I was suprised to find myself reading the whole book in one sitting. This little book is very emotional and inspiring, informing the reader that even a seemingly uneventful life is full of importance. I highly recommend it, but be prepered to shed a tear or two!
B0001FR3IQ|4.0|One of the truly great features of this movie is how confusing it is during the first half.  Halle Berry, playing Miranda Grey, is struggling to know whether she has suddenly become insane, or whether something else is going on.  It takes her a while, but eventually she realizes that, as improbable as it seems, a ghost is haunting her.<br />Miranda Grey is a psychiatrist.  She deals with people who behave strangely and often have a hard time dealing with reality.  She drives home one day and encounters a girl in the road, but her encounter is weird.  The next thing we know, Miranda is waking up in a hospital, accused of murdering her husband.  The next portion of the movie is designed to make you confused, mirroring Miranda's own confusion.  Who really killed Miranda's husband?  Why was Miranda's husband killed?  Is there really a ghost or is Miranda insane?  Why does the ghost keep writing \\"Not Alone?\\"<br />The movie does plod a bit, but the plodding is intended to give you time to think about the movie and what is happening, allowing you to add to your own confusion.  It takes about half the movie for the viewer to become convinced that a ghost really haunts Miranda, which is about the time that Miranda herself realizes that she is being haunted.  Once Miranda catches on that the ghost wants her to do something, then the movie enters a whole new phase.  Fortunately the ghost is working with her to help answer all the questions that the viewer asks in the first half of the movie, including what I thought was a chilling ending that I did not see coming.<br />Portions of the movie are predictable, and we are left with a plot hole big enough to drive a bus through, but I still found the movie enjoyable and would recommend it to people who like horror movies that make you think.  Even if you find the ending predictable, then you can pat yourself on the back about how well you figured it all out from the clues sprinkled throughout the movie.  A solid four star effort.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|I have wasted my time and money.  This movie can only excite people that have absolutely nothing to do.  I thought maybe its just slow ... no its a pathetic movie with hardly a plot.

B00011RPB0|5.0|Different strokes for different folks. Some people like action and predictability, obvious and sudden plot twist, or everything tied up in a nice little package and all loose ends addressed by conclusion, with critical problems solved by impossible &quot;coincidences&quot;, and/or humor that hits them over the head or jumps out at them. This movie has none of that. I must admit that I've enjoyed movies that were chock full of that stuff, but a lot of the time that stuff leaves me feeling cheated and let down and it starts  to get old after a while. This movie is really good and I like it better each time, but I'm sure I could burn it out (like I always do). The turning point and crucial moment for me (as if this movie really has one)... Well without spoiling it?..&quot;more then this&quot; (you have to watch to understand).. the look on their faces, subtle, I know, but realistic, the looking away nervousness, that's how most people would be, me included.  I now can't get that song out of my head, even though that song is used in so many romantic moments in movies it's cliche, ( wow I found one where none were supposed to exist!), but the song is presented uniquely and it really fits this movie to a t. Bill Murray was great, and Scarlett Johansson was really wonderful and she is also very beautiful. You can't help but enjoy watching her. Sophia Copala did a wonderful job at conveying deep feelings and meanings with stillness and minimalistic expression. I really like the scenery of Japan and the nightlife in contains. I've only watched it on the dish and have it recorded, but this is one I will be owning. Very human.
0385510438|5.0|I loved this book. Being part southern,I can attest to the realism and beautiful prose along with a knockout plot. I hated to finish the book and wish there was a sequal in the works. Most of Grisham's books have interested, educated and entertained me. This one is one of his best along with a surprising change of pace. I cannot imagine anyone not loving this book. The characters are so real they jump off the page. If they ever make it a movie, it would never do the book justice. This is five star stuff.
6304493681|2.0|I will probably get a lot of heat for writing this review but I did not like Ghost in the Shell. I think that the characters are wonderfully drawn and that the writers really tried but Ghost in the Shell just didn't do it for me. There were times when I was fighting myself to not turn it off. I knew that to write a good review I would have to sit through all of it. I did manage to sit through all of it and I still have almost nothing good to say about it. I would only recommend this anime for people who are into the inner workings of computers and people who thought that The Matrix movies was the best trilogy ever.
B00005T30L|5.0|Before you watch this movie don't get the idea of these 2 girls looking for ghost or something like that, like I did. When the movie was still rolling I was still wondering where do the ghost come in? But then I realized it is a metaphor for having no one around. It is a hilarious comedy with a 5 star cast. This movie was based upon the comic book by Daniel Clowes. This movie after you watch it, it will intrest you in the comic book. It is a great adaption. <br />The story goes as 2 seventeen year olds Enid and Rebecca (Thira Birch and Scarlette Johansson)who have just graduated from highschool looking for an apartment. Then they come across and old record collector Seymour(Steve Buscemi)who then him and Enid become close friends. Then Rebecca gets annoyed by it and decides not to be Enids friend. Enid tries dozens of times to connect Seymour with a girl. But then Seymour isn't much of a ladys man. Seymour and Enid then fall in love then to realize they can't be together. Showing the true meaning of &quot;Ghost World&quot;. <br />This is a definate must see film. Definite 5 star everything. It is the best film of 2001.
B000056H24|2.0|Having seen this movie twice now on TCM (in widescreen, no less), I still found my attention wandering away from the characters and towards the magnificent scenery.  George Stevens last film was considered the biggest box office flop in Hollywood history until &quot;Heaven's Gate&quot; came out in 1980.<br />And no wonder, while Max Von Sydow is fine as Jesus of Nazareth, the supporting cast and cameo appearences run the gamut from inspired (Ed Wynn as an blind old man) to the insane (John Wayne as a thoughtful Roman centurian).<br />At times, this film seems more like a stylized retelling, rather than a faithful account.  Take for example the scene of Jesus riding into Jeruselam on a donkey.  Notice how nearly everyone is wearing spotless white garments.  I guess the laundromat was just off camera.<br />But the major problem is the elephant-walk pacing of the film.  It simply takes way too long to tell it's story, despite how great it is.<br />However, if there is a standout, it's the incredable scenery shot in perfect color hues and tones.  What's even more inspired is that the film was shot on location in the American southwest.  The mountains in the backgroud actually augment the &quot;more than human&quot; atmosphere that is the life of Jesus.<br />So, while it takes forever to get there, we at least get to take the scenic route.
B0001HAHXW|4.0|It's been ten years since Clapton's FROM THE CRADLE, where he paid tribute to such blues influences as Muddy Waters and Willie Dixon. But it's been decades since he last recorded anything by Robert Johnson, whom Clapton refers to in his liner notes as &quot;the keystone of my musical foundation.&quot;  In 1965, a 20-year-old Clapton first recorded Robert Johnson's &quot;Ramblin' on My Mind&quot;; nearly forty years later he finally releases an entire album of the blues legend's material.<br />On first listening I was disappointed by the polished feel of the recordings. Clapton continues to surround himself with top-nitch musicians, many have been playing on his records for years now, including Andy Fairweather Low and Doyle Branhall II on guitars, Billy Preston on organ and piano. Now, after repeated listenings, I can apreciate these interpretations for the intensity that Clapton found in the originals. Whether it's the smoldering version of &quot;Milkcow's Calf Blues&quot; or the ragtime bounce of &quot;They're Red Hot,&quot; the purity of the music shines through. What fans (and my fellow reviewers) need to remember is that Clapton didn't record this album with the idea of replicating Johnson's original recordings, but rather to offer his vision. In his liner notes Clapton says Johnson's music &quot;is like my oldest friend, always in the back of my head, and on the horizon.&quot;  With this album, Clapton shares that friendship.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
B00009YNGA|5.0|This CD is great to start with ok?, the songs are much more clubbier and dirtier than her previous albums. Then come along these 3 bonus tracks which are even cooler, You should definiltey take this into consideration because if you want to dance. this album is it! , one of Britney's best woks to date! and im not lying!, I think the dirtyt clubby Britney is better than the innocent - screaming to be dirty- britney. This album totally rocks!
B00005A1VH|5.0|This is one of those movies they &quot;don't make anymore&quot;. An excellent story, an excellent cast, excellent set design, excellent dialogue, and great music. Faith in God and Country. A movie that teaches us how we should all act.  When I am feeling low I'll watch the first half and be lifted up and inspired. In my opinion the best movie ever made. Thanks Alvin.
B00013PHGS|5.0|I have to say that these albums are the greatest new releases in electronica and fusion music.  Air has established themselves as the greatest downtempo fusion group from france.  This new album shows them developing into a more popular musical form. As they are writing full songs with bridge and chorus song structures.<br />The album paris under a groove includes 9 artists who are following in their footsteps.  However, these new artists like Kia, Florian, The bottle and terrasse tranquille are much funkier and have stronger grooves.  Plus this album also has one of st germain's greatest unreleased tracks.  I bought this release since I loved the title.  But, it turned out to be a fantastic find.  It is great for hanging out with friends and listening to the latest offering of mellow french jazz and funk electronica.
B0000584V3|1.0|This band is absolute crap!!...I really don't know what all the hype is about. The music is boring, repetitive, and the singer needs lessons badly! Look around everyone...there is better music out there!
B0000VAFO0|1.0|There are so many things wrong with UNDERWORLD it's hard to summon the energy to get pedantic whilst reviewing it.  There are some worthwhile concepts present, but all are never developed in a good fashion.  <BR>     KATE BECKENSALE is horrible.  A badly written character played with a badly miscast actress makes for a hard time watching with any conviction.  She just looks uncomfortable.<BR>     The werewolf effects are atrocious.  With a plot surrounding a vampire/werewolf war, you end up rooting for the wolves; that is until you witness their transformation.  Bad FX.<BR>     The action scenes are stillborn.  The build up is as suspenseful as slumber and the delivery is rehash.  Without some fleeting half-creativity the entire film is an all out rip-off of the ultra-far superior BLADE (1&amp;2), and borrows some inspiration from THE MATRIXes.<BR>     The direction is slipshod.  Obviously lensed by a first timer working with an amateur script.  I can't believe they are already filming not one but TWO sequels.  Totally unnessesary.<BR>     Check out the flick DOG SOLDIERS instead.  That film has the action, horror, and werewolves, that works with the sense to not take itself seriously.  <BR>     Given the subject matter, UNDERWORLD should have been a lot better of a movie.  I love vampire and werewolf films, and there really aren't that many good ones.  UNDERWORLD has both aforementioned creatures, and still ranks at the botttom of both catagories.  So I'll have to say that it's definitely bad.
B0001AP12G|5.0|One of the best artists since Tupac.  KanYe is very talented and the whole CD is very entertaining, from the intro to the end.
B0001BKAEY|3.0|The two sequels to THE MATRIX have the same problem.  Sure, they are pretty much equally entertaining, but only the sum of some parts.  The WACHOWSKI's spent too much time in smokey rooms worrying about the phiosophical aspects of their project, and didn't realize the best parts of the original MATRIX were the FX heavy action sequences.  Hey, I'm as critical of plotting and story importance as anyone, but the draw of these B sci-fi flicks is the mayhem.  The battle for ZION is the best thing here, the special effects are simply amazing.  The story is weak.  What actually transpires at the end and why is very up-in-the-air, and seems rather rushed.  Although visually superior to almost anything out there, THE MATRIX series goes out with a dud, fully due to weak story.  Here's MY philosophy; why not make a film with an excellent sci-fi adventure story AND wicked FX?  As with RELOADED and REVOLUTIONS one can be decently satisfied with the one aspect, which is decent enough to like it.
B0001MDPV8|3.0|Illmatic was designed to be heard on a CD.  Moreover, the recording technology for CDs was pretty good in 1994.  Not surprisingly, Illmatic as a recording sounds good.  Very good.  Is it necessary to remaster the original tapes?  Probably not.  This strikes me as a way for the record company to make a quick buck.  As others have already indicated, there are a lot of great remixes already out there, and none are included on this collection.<br />Don't waste your money.  If you have the original that should be good enough, and if you don't, get it immediately.
B000002H33|5.0|This is possibly the best metal album of all time. As you have probably heard. From start to finish, this album is just simply amazing and brilliant. It's just completley clear that you have to own this album. You will be stunned by the brilliant riffs and lyrics on this album. And Cliff is rockin'! The best track in my opinion is Master of Puppets! This album has sold over a million copies and for very good reason. These times were Metallica's best. And some other definite metal albums you must own are: <BR>Metallica - Kill 'Em All<BR>Metallica - Ride The Lightning<BR>Metallica - ...And Justice For All<BR>Death - Scream Bloody Gore<BR>Slayer - Reign In Blood<BR>The Best of Malevolent Creation<BR>Megadeth - Rust In Peace
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly was a show never given a chance by Fox when it was first aired in the US, they even aired the first episode last! Thankfully these DVDs give people a chance to see the show as intended.<br />The background of the story is set in the distant future, where Earth has been left behind by man and many planets have been colonised. After a very recent war a grouping of planets called &quot;The Alliance&quot; have taken control of the galaxy, their planets are rich and properous with high-technology, whilst many other planets are neglected and poor. These poorer worlds have to rely on the basic means of survival such as using horses instead of cars and traditional guns instead of lasers to defend themselves. Presumably The Alliance has learned that their citizens cannot rebel when they have nothing to rebel with.<br />Some people dismiss the show as &quot;cowboys in space&quot; because of the low-tech look of the poorer planets, but it makes perfect sense that on worlds the Alliance has conquered you would have to go &quot;back to basics&quot; when you can't get spare parts for your car.<br />The show follows the crew of the &quot;Firefly&quot; class ship &quot;Serenity&quot;. The crew travels the space ways trying to stay on the fringes of civilisation to avoid The Alliance. They'll take any job (they don't usually care what it is) and this leads to them being involved in all kinds of capers from illegal jobs like robbing trains to shipping a hold full of cattle! <br />While the story is always interesting, the characters are even more so. The captain, Malcolm Reynolds (Nathan Fillion), was on the losing side during the war and after being betrayed by his superiors has lost his faith in god and man. He wants nothing more than to avoid the Alliance and live his own life, but if he can find a job that will annoy the Alliance he and his crew will take it. <br />The rest of the crew is very diverse: the Doctor called Simon, and his sister, River, are high-profile fugitives from the Alliance. Then there is Shepherd Book who is a priest with a secret, he naturally has issues with the &quot;godless&quot; captain too. There is also a &quot;registered companion&quot; aboard (a government sanctioned prostitute) called Inara, although in reality she is more like a Japanese Geisha as she is required to choose her clients most carefully. Amusingly, in the future having a companion on board means you are much more likely to be warmly greeted when landing on a new planet!<br />The crew is rounded out by Zoe (first officer) and Wash (pilot) who are married, the twist being that Zoe is more like the dominant male of the relationship! There is also Jayne, who often seems on the verge of betraying the crew for money and finally Kayley who is the ships gifted engineer. All of the characters are funny, and every episode has laugh out loud moments as well as moments of high drama and tension.<br />I highly recommend this to anyone with a taste for well written, well acted Sci-Fi, especially if you are suffering from over-exposure to Star Trek, as this show offers a very refreshing and different take on the future of mankind.
B00005JN1L|4.0|I walked into this movie thinking it was gonna be a lame, cheesy new thriller. But it wasn't. Beginning to end this is a very entertaing movie. It will give you some spooks and it will also make you laugh. The ending was pretty unexpected. Usually, you know what's gonna happen halfway through the movie, but w/Secret Window, you don't. So if you plan on going to see an entertaining movie that's actually worth your $, then go see Secret Window.
B000021YQV|2.0|This is possibly the funniest CD I have ever owned. System of a Down, while trying to put on a machissimo persona, come off as cheesy as Weezer - except Weezer intended to make us all laugh. When I first listened to &quot;Prison Song,&quot; I thought it was a political advertisement. SOAD meshed together music with... what?... yes, that's right: statistical facts. At first, I was really confused, so I went back for another listen. At which point, I started cracking up. Initially, SOAD seems as if they're trying to brainwash you, repeating these useless facts in some kind of monotone, but when you understand what they're singing about, you won't be able to stop laughing: I guarantee it. Come on guys, stick with the music. If you have a political message, don't sing about it. When we listen to music, do we want to hear about America's government's problems? About how people are starving? And... do we care to listen to worthless statistics? Basically, this CD is rotten. &quot;Chop Suey!&quot;, however, is arguably a stroke of genius. <br />Bottom Line: If you insist upon listening to political garble, try Rage Against The Machine; they're a WHOLE lot better. Don't buy this CD unless, of course, you want a good, hard, 13-song laugh (omitting &quot;Chop Suey!&quot;).
6305897786|4.0|The Ninth Gate is a wonderful vehicle for Depp.  His tongue-in-cheek performance saved what could otherwise have been an overly dark and convoluted crawl, leaving the viewer sorry for having invested the time and money.<br />Depp is at his best when he has a part in which to camp it up, his humor and refusal to take himself all that seriously - hiding behind the &quot;Angel/Demon&quot; when threatened, for instance - fosters a connection to his vulnerability, drawing the viewer into his plight. <br />Cast initially into an interesting adventure, spurred by the character's enjoyment of the hunt, his love of money and, ultimately, his growing attraction to the dark possibilities, Depp keeps us involved and curious.  <br />Though even Depp is occasionally weighed down by the sluggish pace of the film, more often than not his performance offsets the muck through which his character wades.  <br />In comparison, the supporting cast is not as well developed, and the plot is often confusing.  You need to release your hold on reality quite often, but it is a work of fiction, for entertainment purposes.  It succeeds quite well in this respect.
B0000DJZA0|5.0|Despite everyone talking about the bad sound quality, it really isn't that bad. It sounded fine to me
B0001HAHXW|5.0|Once again, Mr. Clapton has managed to put out a CD that I can pop in, sit back, relax and just enjoy to the max. <BR>A must have for the true Blues afficionado.
B000060OFT|5.0|I didn't know much about Shakespeare before this film. Now seeing how beautiful the language truly is makes the movie breathtaking. The acting is phenomenal. Baz Luhrmann is a genius at his best (besides &quot;Moulin Rouge!)But if you won't let them tell you this story and if you can't go beyond the norm, you won't like it.
6301543408|5.0|This movie gets five stars for extreme un-intentional humour. If you would allow me to spoil the ending, Captain Kirk finds what appears to be God on some planet. After refusing to give \\"God\\" the usage of his ship, lighting bolts and proton torpedoes fly.  It can only be guessed as to what thoughts were going through Mr. Shatner's head when he created this ridiculous barrel of laughs. I love it for all the wrong reasons.
B000000WA4|5.0|Although I prefer the disc featuring Zero, Bullet With Butterfly Wings, and Love, that doesn't mean that the second disc doesn't shine. One of my favorites off Twilight to Starlight is We Only Come Out at Night. Everyone else seems to dismiss it, but it's special to me. The instrumentation on it almost has a carnival-like feel, and reminds me of the Beatles. Where Boys Fear to Tread and Bodies are my fave rockers off the disc, and obviously, 1979 is a keeper too. Mellon Collie is one 90's album that is rightfully derserves the praise it gets. I wouldn't say it's  shame that it's not as phenominally-popular as some of the other 90's albums released, but that makes Mellon Collie even more special. It's nice to know you can treasure something without having every person on the planet listening to the same thing you are.
B000003TA4|1.0|I personally think that Bleach is the true representation Nirvana's playing capabilities and the band as a whole, which is mediocre at best. I have never admired or even liked the band, but I have heard all of Nirvana's albums over the years. Without exaggeration, I can safely say that Nevermind is the ultimate grunge stereotype. And as with most music stereotypes, it gives young kids these days a false view of how music was in the 90's, and what they should expect from &quot;Alternative&quot; rock music. Alternative and Independent music is just that; it's not any Nirvana album that every kid and his mother owns. I find it very disheatening the next new true alternative (whether it turns out to be electro-pop or country music) is being ingnored on MTV and radio in favor for more coverage of Nirvana and their thousands of drone knockoffs. We're missing the next big thing thanks to MTV's unwillingness to let go off Nirvana and the past. The most amazing wave of music is probably building up right now, and we're not going to find out about it because MTV is busy force-feeding kids pre-packaged, superficial agnst like Nevermind.
B0000C6E4D|4.0|This might be blasphemous to hard-core Sarah fans, but I actually like this album better than her previous releases. Ok...so maybe it's tied with &quot;Surfacing&quot; but I enjoy it more than &quot;Fumbling Towards Ecstasy.&quot; Sarah had quite a job on her hands with following up 1997's &quot;Surfacing&quot; which was the biggest album of her career and thrust her into the main stream. I've heard a lot of negativity about &quot;Afterglow&quot; but I happen to feel that is an awesome album. Of course, it's very mellow but most of her music is.<br />&quot;Fallen&quot; is the opening track and was her first single. It got moderate radio airplay at AC and pop radio and is a beautiful track. &quot;World On Fire&quot; was what I was hoping to be the second single, but &quot;Stupid&quot; was picked. &quot;Stupid&quot; is a good song, but &quot;World On Fire&quot; has a much better quality to it and very good production. &quot;Train Wreck&quot; is also in the same vein as &quot;World On Fire&quot; with a soft vocal and hushed backing vocals. The other two highlights occur at the end of the album and those are &quot;Perfect Girl&quot; and &quot;Dirty Little Secret.&quot; &quot;Perfect Girl&quot; has a nice melody, but the lyrics are very good too and &quot;Dirty Little Secret&quot; is reminicent of &quot;Do What You Have To Do&quot; from &quot;Surfacing.&quot; Both are gorgeous piano ballads.<br />This album may disappoint some upon first listen, but be sure to give it another try. It might take some getting used to, but it's a very beautiful recording. Sarah is truly a very gifted songwriter.
B00008OWZC|5.0|Much of what I would have praised has been praised already.  This is one of the definitive live rock albums and will remain such for years to come.  These live performances capture Robert Plant right before his voice finally lost its top end.  That means you get to hear songs like &quot;Over the Hills and Far Away&quot; and &quot;Rock And Roll&quot; to the full dramatic effect.  By the time of the US tour in 1973, Plant was unable to sing in the same register (just compare Rock and Roll on &quot;The Song Remains the Same&quot; with the version here).  The band also dropped &quot;Immigrant Song&quot; after 1972, I believe, because the opening wails gave Plant such difficulty.  They were still a great band, but for me post 1972 Zeppelin are not as great as pre-1972.  That, for me, is what makes all the difference to this live album.  It also beats the BBC Sessions for sheer variety of material.
0380729407|5.0|I admit i thought this book seemed strange and somewhat corny from first reading the synopsis. But after begining to read i was imediately swept into Bradbury's vision. I could clearly see every detail and believe in the fantastic events. This book also provides a wonderful discourse on good and evil and the nature of each. As all good literature should it does not provide answers but asks deep questions.
B000002HRE|3.0|This album starts off very strong with &quot;fuel&quot; and up until &quot;slither&quot;. It seems that after &quot;slither&quot;, the band suddenly runs out of ideas and continues to play very similar and very boring songs for the sole purpose of filling up the CD.<BR>I would have gave this album a 5 out of 5 if they ended the album with &quot;slither&quot; or &quot;carpe deim baby&quot; and cut everything after that. However, the first 6 tracks are pure musical gold. &quot;Better than you&quot; goes on a bit too long. I think Metallica was trying to produce some of the 6-8 minute long material that was masterfully displayed in the legendary &quot;Master of Puppets&quot;, but ended up sounding boring and redundant. 5 out of 5 for the first six tracks, and 0 out of five for the last seven. That equals out to 3 of 5.
0441172717|5.0|Herbert, in a way that so few else have, has crafted a new world full of life and detail. mMore than just a work of science fistion, Dune articulates several resonating stories of humanity intertwined in a single (though complex) plot. The writting is superb and provides a beautiful portrait of Dune and it's characters. Everyone should at least try to read this book, though I understand it may not be for everyone given it's themes and subject matter.
B000002H33|5.0|By far the best metal CD anywhere! I was much impressed on how metallica can stretch the songs out so long, yet still keep it interesting. It starts out with the speedy track &quot;battery&quot; then jumps right into the awesome title track. next is &quot;the thing that should not be&quot; which is my least favorite. Next is &quot;Welcome home&quot; which takes an interesting turn both lyrically and insturmentally. After a few more good, but rather similar tracks comes &quot;Orion&quot;. Orion is definatley my favorite track with mind blowing insturmentals. The CD wraps up with &quot;Damage, Inc.&quot; An explosive conclusion to an awesome CD. 5 OUT OF 5!!!!
0743454529|5.0|Picoult weaves a wonderful story in MY SISTER'S KEEPER, one that tells the tale of a young girl whose only reason for life was to save an existing and ailing sibling.  She tells the story in a true and straight-forward manner, telling it like it is and is never ashamed to see why she has been given life.  Her writing is very honest and touching.  <br />From the first chapter.....<BR>&quot;On the other hand, I was born for a very specific purpose. I wasn't the result of a cheap bottle of wine or a full moon or the heat of the moment. I was born because a scientist managed to hook up my mother's eggs and my father's sperm and come up with a specific combination of precious genetic material. In fact, when Jesse told me how babies get made and I, the great disbeliever, decided to ask my parents the truth; I got more than I bargained for. They sat me down and told me all the usual stuff, of course -- but they also explained that they chose little embryonic me, specifically, because I could save my sister Kate.  &quot;We loved you even more,&quot; my mother made sure to say, &quot;because we knew what exactly we were getting.&quot; <br />The style and story here are exceptional. I highly recommend this book.  I'm already into a second reading.

0066620996|4.0|I really do not understand the sub five star let alone the 1 star reviews. This is a great book. A lot of time and research was done to find what separates the good from the  great companies. I can only assume that sub 5 star reviewers own businesses that are doing doing that great or are not in business at all...anymore.<br />Great book for those who want to learn how to take your business to that next level. The level of greatness.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Okay, First of all....All you people need to get over the whole &quot;I hate Britney&quot; Deal, and get over yourselves.This is by far the best cd ever. It is just a great cd to be listening in your car while driving to the club or just hanging out with your friends. I agree.. It's not for young girls, but thats why they have Hilary Duff now. I'm sure everyone who has written a negative review on this cd based it on their past views of Britney Spears. PEOPLES! She is the next MAdonna! A LegeNd. In a couple of years,  all you Britney haters will realize how wrong you were, and regret not to appreciate the music she has made for us. For all of you that dont know whether to buy it or not...Don't listen to others and go ahead and buy her cd. It is very good! It has some up-beat songs, like Toxic, Me against the music, The Hook up, Brave new girl, Outrageous, I got that boom boom and a cool remix of me against the music, and it also has its cool, mellow songs like Breathe on my me (Awesome song), Showdown, and Everytime. The only song I must say that sucks is Early Morning. I just cant stand the beat to it and the lyrics, but other than that... you're getting an awesome cd. It's very hard now a days to buy a cd that has more than 10 good songs. This cd is full of energy, and it is definetly cd of the year!!
B00005JMEW|5.0|Not being a Quentin fan,  I came in without to much expectations.  I watched Pulp Fiction after the hype and found it over rated.<br />But, with that said, this movie was incredible.  It captured everything that made the classic Bruce Lee movies great and expanded on them.  The anime to tell the short story was inspired and perfectly created.<BR>I definate must add to my DVD collection.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|This album is my first DT purchase. I am a huge prog rock fan but have not delved much into the prog metal arena. I've heard DT throughout their career but have never been compelled to buy an album until Liquid Tension Experiment paired them with my idol, bassist extrordinaire Tony Levin. I was blown away by LTE II not because of Levin, but because of the inhuman talent of Petruzzi and Portnoy. I decided to give this album a shot after a friend played me &quot;As I Am&quot; and was not dissapointed with the purchase. From what I understand, DT have moved more toward the metal and slightly away from the prog of their prog metal label on this album but to a DT novice like me, they sound to like a band to whom the people who think that Korn and Limp Bizkit are talentent should be listening to see how wrong they are. DT has everything for a fan of heavy music plus progressive elements such as suite-length song construction and time signature changes and also the chops to pull it off. To me, DT seems to be writing better songs and becoming better musicians each time I hear them which lead me to purchase Train of Thought as my first album.
B00018D44U|5.0|It's funny how people with no talent are the biggest critics of people with talent. You losers that don't understand her music can go back to your techno-pop. GREAT JOB Norah! Keep 'em coming.
B0000VAFO0|5.0|This film will literaly blow you away!  The special effects are great, and in response to another reviewer who said they were bad, they are awsome.  The wherewolf transformations look the way they do for a reason.  They are not the usual long drawn out transformation full of lengthy scenes of hair growing on someonew arms; these are new, more evolved werewolves that can change at will.  The action is non-stop; the movie keeps on rolling and doesnt slow down.  If you view this with a home theatre system you will be reaping some serious rewards.  And by the way, the acting is very well done.  The casting was perfect.  The main chick (selene) is hot, and the cast that plays the Liken (wherewolves) look like they really are dogs hiding under human skin.  Awsome movie!! Well done!!!
B00005QXDD|5.0|Tenacious d is not only the greatest of all acoustic metal bands, but also has two comedians for band members. Jack Black and Kyle Gass obviously may not be greatly inteligent, but are very, very talented when it comes to music, and this c.d. definately shows it. With 21 tracks of mind-boggling rock and roll, it is most likely perhaps the best c.d. Ive ever heard.
B00011RPB0|3.0|I saw this film with high expectations and was pretty dissapointed.  I'm a big fan of Bill Murray and his peformance was good, so that wasn't the problem.  This movie had very little going on, I was just bored throughout the whole thing.  It's about a man, Bill Murray, who is on a business trip in Japan, trying to launch an alcohol brand that he is the spokesman for.  While on this trip, he meets a young woman, played by Scarlett Johanson, who is recently married and confused with what she wants out of life.  The two instantly connect and quickly become close friends.  Not much else goes on in this film.  It's boring and I was tempted to just turn it off and do something else, but I finished it anyway.  If you're a fan of Bill Murray you may like this film, but if you're looking for something entertaining, this isn't the film to pick.
B00012FXB8|4.0|.......there is still the question of how did the ALIEN Egg get onto the SULACO in the first place!!!<br />THAT HAS YET TO EVER BE EXPLAINED!!!<br />Along with that is how is it in every other film of this series, the face-huggers die after impregnating one victim. So how is it one face hugger impregnated Ripley AND the poor Moo-Moo Cow thing in the extended version???<br />I will simply say that after all these years, the extended version makes this film a true epic adventure, as I read in the attached booklet....the extended version was how this film was presented for approval from the folks at 20th Century Fox. Then Madonna's video-director-boy chopped the film up into something truly un-watchable.<br />If you have seen the extended ALIENS film and LOVED all the extra footage, then this extended ALIEN 3 will be just as enjoyable!
B0001AP12G|5.0|Kanye West definitely did his thang on this Album. College Dropout runs the gammit of topics that others have been scared or reluctant to speak on. On &quot;Jesus Walks&quot;, Kanye deliver; speaking on behalf of everyone who thinks that the love of Christ should be express in all mediums rather than hidden.  West triumphs not just because of his lyrical presents or his beats, but it is the combination of these two along with the message he brings in his words.  Kanye West is a one of a kind rapper who encompasses all the qualities needed, without contradicting himself and sounding foolish. College Dropout deserves 4 1/2 stars because it is not the best I have ever heard, but because of the quality of this first album and the anticipation of greater things to come, he ultimately deserves the 5 stars.
B000000OXH|5.0|Alpha was the first cassette I ever bought with my own money (and, later, the first CD).  It must have spoiled me, because some 20 years and roughly 300 CDs later, I still have never heard its equal, top-to-bottom.  (In fact, only Asia's first album and Midnight Oil's Blue Sky Mining even come close).<br />One of the raps on early Asia was that they sounded too commercial, too much like other early/mid 80's bands.  I've always found this incredible; I've never heard any other band that sounded like Asia.  They bridge the gap from progressive to pop in a unique way, with rich instrumentation and accessible lyrics, intricate vocal harmonies and amazing, soaring music.  This album, in particular, seems to perfectly balance the keyboard sorcery of Geoff Downes and the penetrating riffs from Steve Howe.  Howe morphs from subtle, complex supporting lines to jaw-dropping &quot;how can a guitar do that?&quot; scalar ballet.  Combined with John Wetton's clear vocals and Carl Palmer's precise drumming, the resulting combination produces panoramic-sounding songs that reach near perfection, to this listener's ears.<br />No weak songs here.  I always felt like &quot;Eye to Eye&quot; was my least favorite, but the older I get, the more I appreciate it.  Every song has something different to offer:  &quot;The Smile Has Left Your Eyes&quot; is Wetton's vocal tour de force; &quot;The Heat Goes On&quot; showcases Palmer's versatile work with the sticks; &quot;Midnight Sun&quot; features incredible fingerwork from Howe (and a symphonic overlay); &quot;Don't Cry&quot;, in addition to being the most pop-sounding track, is rich with Downes' layered keyboards; and &quot;Open Your Eyes&quot; brings it all together for a finale that leaves you gasping for more.<br />Which brings up the only disappointing part of the CD, as has been touched on before -- the absence of &quot;Daylight&quot;, the closing track on the cassette and arguably one of the best Asia songs ever.  What genius at Geffendecided to delete this gem from the CD?  I so wanted this song on CD that I recorded it from cassette onto my computer as an mp3 and then back to a blank CD, though now it is in fact available on CD elsewhere.  Geoff Downes in particular shines on this song, which left me futilely trying to emulate the melody on my own keyboard.<br />I always thought it tragic that Howe and Wetton couldn't iron out their issues.  The later Asia albums contain good songs (&quot;Too Late&quot; from Astra and &quot;Who Will Stop the Rain&quot; from Aqua top that list), but the guitarists and/or vocalists never quite seemed to mesh as perfectly on-album as the original foursome did.  <br />I said it before, I'll say it again:  to my ears, this is the best album ever recorded. Period.
0671027387|1.0|After reading Da Vinci code and digital fortress, both were excellent. I was looking forward to another installment of Dan Brown. Deception point is simply sub-par and a disappointment for such a gifted author;<br />(1.) Too similar to DF, substitute NRO for NSA, and you have the same plotline, same chases, same killer, same heroine, etc.<br />(2.) The buildup for the 'discovery' that would uplift NASA, restore the President's campaign, and shatter the senator's campaign was too hyped with very little substance. Fossils in a meteorite, big deal!<br />(3.) The lame attempt at misdirection of who the villain is Pickering vs. Tench was simply childish.<br />(4.) The same goes for the 'special industry group' trying to buy an election. BORING!<br />I'm very disappointed.<br />MAR
B0000027RL|5.0|I Think This CD Is Awesome, But Instead Of Coming Out With All These Live Bootleg CD's, Pearl Jam Should Come Out With A &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; CD, Because They Have So Many Good Songs From Different P.J.

B00014K5TQ|4.0|Ok, let me tell you something. If you want to watch this movie for the sole purpose of analyzing each aspect of it, go rent something else. If you want to pick apart Culkin's acting, or the over-the-top outfits, go ahead, but just realize that you will only make yourself look stupid.<br />A movie like this does not carry a depth that is dependent on the best acting or a tight plot. This  movie, if anything, is an interesting peek at a world in which many of us did not acknowledge as part of Manhattan history-- a glammed up, drugged up, 24 hour party full of glitter, feathers and chunky shoes. It is an interesting peek into the world of Michael Alig's bizarre 15 minutes of fame as club kid extraordinare and drugged up murderer. If viewed with this in mind, it could be quite a fun ride to experience.<br />Basic story: Michael Alig (Culkin), as a young boy, moves to NYC from a small town in Indiana(?) to strike it big. He meets a young James St. James (Seth Green) and they strike up a friendship built on James' guidance and Alig's ambition. This said partnership grows into what would later be referred to as \\"the Club Kids\\", or Alig's followers comprised of partygoers dressed up in crazy outfits abandoning their troubles and all reason just to dance and get drugged up.<br />The club kids became notorious for having parties in random places (burger joint, the inside of a truck, you name it), all while looking fabulous. The club kids also became notorious for their drug use, especially of the drug Ecstacy. This drug use later became the downfall of Michael Alig and his friends, and led Alig to murder his drug dealer Angel over unpaid drugs.<br />What makes this movie interesting though, is the fact that such a bizarre story actually happened. The way in which Angel was killed and the way in which Alig and his club kids lived are comic-book crazy and unbelievable, but that's the point. The fact that this madness actually happened is half the fun.<br />And personally, I think Macaulay did a fine job acting -- hey, YOU try successfully acting out a drug addicted gay club kid. I think he pulled it off quite well. Seth Green, as always, proves himself as a good actor, and there is a special, ehh.. \\"appearance\\" by Marilyn Manson as well, so be sure to be on the lookout for that.<br />I watch this movie to forget about my troubles. To be distracted by Culkin walking around in a feather corset and Seth Green in a meat suit is great. I mean, there's no WAY that you will be able to find this entertainment in your backyard, folks. <br />Party Monster is great eye candy. As long as you remember that, and don't get too caught up in its loopholes or \\"bad acting\\", you should have a great time.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|From the sweeping and understated opening shots of Tokyo to the painfully real relationship depicted therein, this film is moving and, in a way, comforting.  I didn't know much about this film before watching it, and I spent the entire two hours stunned.  How could a screenwriter/director have such an understanding of people and how we operate?<br />This movie is about reality.  Period.  There is no rising action and climax in real life, no reveting fight scenes, no supermodels and no car chases.  If you can live with a movie that brings a reality close that Hollywood so often chases away - great.  If not, do not see this movie.<br />Escapism is not the game here.

B0001JXQEM|5.0|Every now and then i pick up Weezer and listen to it, every time i still can't believe how incredible this album is. Once i start, i can't stop listening to it. From the finger plucking on &quot;my  name is jonas&quot; to the meaningfull lyrics of &quot;only in dreams&quot; Weezer is by far the best of their albums.  When the Deluxe edition came out i bought it soon as i could and it blew me away again. the b-sides are incredible. Songs like &quot;Mykel and Carli,&quot; &quot;Susanne,&quot;and even the barbershop quartet harmony on &quot;My Evaline&quot; show Weezer as a band different from anyone else, making them so addicting to listen to. For any weezer fan go out and buy this album. With the original album along with the 2nd disc this cd is a must for anyone who listens to weezer.
B00000JLWW|1.0|- Weak plot<BR>A rush job to get to the flashy crap<br />- Horrible character development<BR>I really appreciate a good romance/drama and actually WANT to care about what happens to the heros / protaganists. Was anyone really that heart broken when Leo took the big drink (save for all you simple minded folk)?<br />- Gratuitous sex<BR>No I'm not a prude... but I was disgusted by this wretched attempt to infuse the last little bit of fake intensity into the relationship before they had to abandon the already weak plot and storyline for the sinking of the ship.<br />- Leonardo DiCaprio <BR>Enough said<br />- Gloria Stuart (old Rose)<BR>First let me say... bless this woman... she seems like a really sweet lady.... reminds me of my own grandmother. BUT... who does this woman know?? No, I'm not an actor but I do know the difference between a professional and amateur actor/actress. What's going on here? Come to think of it, that COULD HAVE BEEN my grandmother. She probably would have been more convincing.<br />In summary: This movie is an embarrassment!
B00009ATIX|4.0|I entered this movie with trepidation, as I remembered, vaguely, that it had bombed at the box office, being described by reviewers as impenetrably boring.<br />Once it started, I was hooked!  The dialogue is not always realistic, but then again, given the circumstaces, who is to say that it isn't? Solaris manages to tackle complex ideas while at the same time wrapping those ideas in fairly normal dialogue and reaction by those on screen.  We can be in awe and mystified by the events, even as we completely understand what the space travelers are saying and feeling.  Have we not all seen people lash out at what they cannot understand?  They react, sometimes cruelly, out of fear.<br />Everything must be questioned--what truly motivates us, as humans, to do what we do, to consort with whom we &quot;like&quot;.<br />Why?  The movie asks us that, and lets you, the viewer, answer it in your own way, just as each traveler on screen answers in their singular fashion.  Different people, different response, different outcome....a different life.  We all live different lives, due to choices and circumstances.<br />Anyone who gives this one star, does not understand it.  Then again, different people watch movies for different reasons.  Myself, I like to watch all types of movies, and I don't demand that they all feature light sabre battles and cartoonish villains. This movie is heavy duty.  <br />Check it out!
B000006XSD|4.0|I see a few people critasize this album, But i'd say they are just those fans that think Alice Cooper never did anything decent since the original band broke up.<br />Well, i'm a fan of ALL eras of Alice. And I must say that I went out on a limb when purchasing this, but i'm glad to say I'm not disapointed! <br />Sure, this isnt Alice's best work. But its defnitly somthing I'd recomend you listen to if your into Alice. I would recomend other Alice titles as opposed to this one, and I wont tell you this is a MUST HAVE album! But it certinly is a very underrated rock album!<br />It's god some great tunes and Alice has written some great songs here, my fav would be &quot;no mor elove at your conveniance&quot; but why do you care whats my fav?<br />The album has some funny moments too, I think it gets put down by alot of people because they dont get the humour of the album, Alice mocks a few of the BALLED bands of the time when this was released around mid 70's. And some pretty funny stuff caught me off guard that just reminds you that Alice Cooper is not about trying to win awards for his music, he's just having fun.<br />Probably only the Alice fan of any era would enjoy this album. I wouldnt recomend this as a starting album, or one of the top tating must have albums, like i said before. But it does have some great rock tunes, some nice contruction to the songs and some fun rockin tunes.... it really is more an album that will play more on your own personal taste then anything else, to me, its a pretty good album. <br />Only the die hard fans of the original Alice Cooper band who wont accept that Alice has gone onto do better things will tell you this album is bad. Or the people who didnt get the humour that Alice provided through the album. but for the fan of ANY era of Alice will enjoy Alice singing some 50's sounding rock, and some other types of rock that only Alice could make fun to listen to on an album released after there day. But saying that, it dosent meanAlice is experimenting with other styles here!<br />Bottem line, its not the must have album, but it is a pretty good album for the A.C fan!
B000067DNC|5.0|Incredible follow up to its debut season.  Every episode continues to build on a incredible legacy that Stargate SG-1 has now formed. Nearly all of the episodes in season 2 are worth watching with barely none making you ask yourself &quot;what were the writers thinking?.&quot;<br />Episodes like &quot;The Fifth Race&quot; and &quot;A Matter of Time&quot; are incredibly original and enjoyable to watch. &quot;1969&quot; is a time travel story with a twist and one of the most memorable of the season.<br />For a show in its second season it did extremely well compared to some star trek shows' whose second season's were an incredible bore at times.<br />The only gripe I have is about the packaging i wouldn't have minded paying a little more for some fancier packaging and special features.<br />Otherwise...Awesome Show!...Great Price!...A Classic in the Making!

B00005K3NR|4.0|In Brian DePalma's 1976 film Carrie, we see a socially squeamish teenager named Carrie, played by Sissy Spacek, struggle to fit in at a rather typical high school.  Carrie is blessed or cursed, depending on one's point of view, with telekinetic powers, automatically guaranteeing her communal aloofness.  I think I understand the point that DePalma was trying to make by showing what happens to people when they alienate and ostracize the \\"different\\" kid, but why couldn't Carrie have been idolized for her special talent.  Why must movies and books generally give the \\"freak\\" person the ultimate revenge against those who have wronged them?  This would make sense in an alternative universe probably where Stephen King wrote lilting love poems and high school was not the microcosmical representation and preparation for society that we later must live in.<br /> Not that I entirely disliked DePalma's somewhat formulaic approach, or rather King's warped idea of adolescent vengeance, to be precise.  Carrie was indeed a satisfying movie, of which there are precious few these days and another example as to why young audiences today should learn to appreciate the films of the past.  Perhaps it would be even more satisfying on a second viewing, as I really didn't know what to expect on first viewing.<br /> The orchestral stabs of music accentuate quick camera cuts and add to the tension.  These stabs reminded me of Hitchcock's Psycho shower scene and perhaps it was an homage on DePalma's part as they are used throughout the movie, notably in the last few scenes as Carrie looks around the gymnasium and wills inanimate objects to exact her revenge.  DePalma probably didn't intend for the prom scenes to be humorous, but I couldn't help but find them so.  I suppose that's what twenty years will do to a film or I wonder if audiences in 1976 were shocked and horrified.  Not to say that I didn't enjoy these scenes, I did, for I am a huge fan of Sam Raimi's work in the Evil Dead series of movies, those which combine comedy and horror.  A particularly effective shot in the prom sequence by cinematographer Mario Tosi places William Katt and Sissy Spacek on a spinning platform while the camera is spinning around them simultaneously in the opposite direction.  This subconsciously sets the tone for the rest of the prom sequence as we are about to be forced into a dizzying world of pig's blood and possessed fire hoses.<br /> Would Carrie have snapped had it not been for her overbearing, Super-Christian mother?  Maybe or maybe not.  Had she a supporting parent to talk to about her troubles at school, would lives had been lost?  Perhaps.  Maybe this was Kings' and DePalma's message with Carrie, that of man versus religion.  Deeper layers of meaning lie beneath the gory surface of  Carrie.  In showing Carrie's physical domination over mother's spiritual zealousness, we, in essence, see a battle between man and God.  It's a battle that man wins ultimately. Even though Carrie also succumbs, she is reborn, in a sense, in the movie's final shot.  Certainly heavier issues appear beneath the surface of the movie when given further thought and consideration, issues such as teen peer pressure, societal structures and the almighty Pecking Order come into play in Carrie.  Also of note is the portrayal of the high school as a microcosm of out society with its clear haves and have nots, weird and normal, and the sacred and profane.  The last of these would at first appear to be evident, but by the end of the movie the line between the sacred and profane becomes blurred and it is up to the viewer to decide who is who.ies, those which combine comedy and horror.

B00009V7RF|5.0|i LOVED this spicy classic that NEVER leaves my disc changer! yall should REALLY stop hatin on BEP! they are awesome and creative and you don't gotta be dissin on them just because they aren't \\"hard core hip hop\\". that's just stupid! so what if they don't have one particular category of music? they're really good! will.i.am. has really done it this time, especially with the new addition of fergie. fergie provides strong female vocals and can sing and dance really good, shes the real deal. i've never took a particular interest to BEP until this album, which provides a variety of hip hop, r&b, reggae, soul, and upbeat latin! there are many great dance tracks on this CD (Hey Mama, Latin Girls), as well as slow, sexy, romantic songs (Sexy), rock & roll sounds (Anxiety), party songs (Labor Day), stress songs with great vocals provided by Fergie (Shut Up), reggae tunes (Fly Away), cool vibes (The Boogie That Be, The Apl Song, Smells Like Funk, Hands Up), silly songs (Lets Get Retarded), and the weird sounding last track, Elephunk.<br />here's my ratings of the songs:<br />1. Hands Up-6/10<BR>2. Labor Day-8/10<BR>3. Lets Get Retarded-4/10<BR>4. Hey Mama-10/10<BR>5. Shut Up-10/10<BR>6. Smells Like Funk-8/10<BR>7. Latin Girls-10/10<BR>8. Sexy-10/10<BR>9.

Elephunk-8/10<br />Overall, a great CD with only a few tracks to avoid. this is a CD worth buying if you liked upbeat reggae tunes like Hey Mama!<br />Also: check out the Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights Soundtrack for another great song of BEP self-titled Dirty Dancing!
B00008J4P5|4.0|Elephant is a good album.  I'm not in any way going to argue with that.  However, the White Stripes are a perfect example of the ways in which an album can be hyped up so much by the media that when people finally listen to it, it's...well...not quite as good as they made out.  The first time I heard Seven Nation Army, I was blown away. 'Wow', I thought,'The White Stripes have never done anything like that before.'  Now, when it comes on TV, I switch it over thinking 'bloody hell, not that song again'.  Yeah the other problem with the White Stripes is that their videos are played over and over and over and over and over until you really end up hating the song.  I mean, for gods sake, my grandmother knows the videos to 7 nation army and the hardest button to button, it's that bad.<br />But that aside, this is a good album, full of decent choons which you can happily listen to while cruising the dusty road.  However, and this is a big however, it is nowhere near as good as White Blood Cells, and if you are a newbie to Jack and Meg, I strongly suggest you buy it instead.  Thankies.
B00004RFFI|5.0|Unexpectedly for the reviews of few stars, I am surprised. Certainly the general people that have not have many knowledge for the nature phenomenons may be a little bore. But though I am Japanese, I am very interested to the nature phenomenons so that have gotten to Japanese weather forecast licence. The person like me will have many interests to watch this movie.<br />In fact, in Japan the tornades do not break out. But hurricane(Japanese name Taifuu) is very important disasters in Japan. Certainly Taifuu is bad things that break the disaster, but on the other hand, as Tifuu approached to Tokyo(my address) I used to have felt the excitments. Though it is not the apt remark, I can understand the cast feeling of this movie that as tornads approach to their site, they get the exitements. <br />When the people that are not interested to such phenomenons look at the person that dive into the tornads without the caution to oneself life, may be you will think that such person is crazy. But I can understand the emotion of the person that dive into little. Especialy in Japan it is famouse thing that very storong Taifuu approach. Now even when I involve to such situations, I care to such scale or wind speed, the pressure etc.<br />This movie may lack as the point of the story, and for the veteran movie watcher such movies lacking the story may be no. But if watch in the pure point that enjoy the exciting phenomenons and so on honestly, the movie may be good thing.<br />Thank you for reading poor English.
B000002TQV|5.0|One of the best albums of the 90s, hands down.  While it isn't quite as good as Ok Computer, it is still brilliant.  12 tracks of brilliance cemented Radiohead as a brilliant band, still cemented today. Well done boys, another fantastic album.
0790729628|5.0|If you enjoy science fiction or film noir or both and are contemplting buying this film you have probably already seen it. If you haven't: It is a Phillip K. Dick story about androids doing the risky or unwanted jobs in society and what to do with them when their job is done. The answer is to use a type of cop called a Blade Runner to destroy them. Harrison Ford, in a nice but somewhat misunderstood role, is the Blade Runner.<br />I have three versions of this film on laser disc. The first is the theatrical version, the second was an extended version with about twenty minutes added, and the third is the shorter directors cut. This DVD version is the director's cut.<br />The directors cut is a tightened version with the voice over and the extended ending removed; the theatrical and the extended version are the versions with voice over by Harrison Ford and with the added ending that some call happy. It is the voice over and the so called happy ending that some find objectionable. My favorite of the three is the extended version with the voice over. The happy ending I did not see as especially happy and could take or leave. But all versions a superior science fiction and all are worth your time. A boxed set of all versions would have been nice and perhaps some day we will see that boxed set available. In the meantime enjoy Ridley Scott's favorite cut and maybe someday pick up the voice over version. And forget the fantasy about Harrison Ford purposely doing a bad job on the voice over; no actor is going to do a crappy job on purpose any more than an auto mechanic is going to do a crappy job on your car because he doesn't like the brand.

I have never though of Uma as tha t kind of actress, but she does it so well here, I couldnt help but root for her.<BR>I think my mouth was open through out the whole movie, it was that good, and with the crazy 70's inspired soundtrack and some great music fetaured in the trailers by Tomoyasu Hotei, this is a must see, cant wait for the DVD.<BR>If u like whacky characters dressed in awesome costumes, beautiful scenery (Uma's duel with Lucy Liu takes plae in a serene japanese Garden with snow falling is amazing!) and most important blood spilling everywhere, severed limbs and head flying, assasins spiralling through air, this is a major gem in the movie world, one of my favorite movies ever, for sure.<br />I am however waiting for the end of the year, to get the 3 box DVD set, of vol1, vol2 and a dvd box full of extras and behind scenes.
0385510438|2.0|Several good court scenes are not enough to salvage this book, as Grisham stretches the plot needlessly through page after page.  Actually, although this book is fast-enough reading, you can get through it even faster by checking out the plot summary on the dust jacket. It takes you up to page 291 (out of about 370). Even then, the ending is rather anticlimactic. <br />Hard-core Grisham fans, wanting to preserve their record of reading everything he's written, will have a reason to read this book.  The rest of us can surely find better ways to spend even the short time needed to read it.

B00005JMJ4|3.0|Tokyo does most of the talking in this movie. The script is very bare. The pacing is sloooow, so don't watch it when you're tired, unless you're looking to fall asleep. I was disappointed that their relationship had to turn to romance. How original and unpredictable. Nineteen-year-old actress, fifty-something actor--inappropriate and grossly overdone in Hollywood.
B0000029GA|5.0|This is a masterpiece. I never really loved the entire album until I got older and realized how special it really is. Don't miss this. If you don't own Illmatic, you arent into the real stuff. <br />Cuts like &quot;Memory Lane&quot; and &quot;Ain't Hard to Tell&quot; just make you want to sit back on a hot day and just bob your head.<br />Straight up! Get this Now!
B00009RAJH|5.0|When Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham joined Fleetwood Mac and recorded what would be known as the &quot;White Fleetwood Mac&quot; album, that band had already been through the ups and downs of fame. What nobody expected is that this humble &quot;debut&quot; would take them to such great heights. A rock legend was on its way...<br />This album is everything you love about Fleetwood Mac, and everything they would be known for : Christine McVie's instantly memorable midtempo pop songs, Lindsey Buckingham's guitar genius, Stevie Nicks' mystical rock songs, Mick Fleetwood &amp; John McVie's outstanding rhythm section, and the band's smooth vocal harmonies. Each song flows as if this band had been together for years, yet this specific line-up had only been together for a couple of months when they recorded &quot;Fleetwood Mac&quot;.<br />This expanded edition has a cleaner sound than the former CD release, has extensive liner notes and pictures, and is well worth the purchase. Not only does it feature the band's classic singles &quot;Over my head&quot;, &quot;Rhiannon&quot; and &quot;Say you love me&quot; in both their single &amp; album versions, but it features other songs that are now considered just as essential in Fleetwood Mac's repertoire (&quot;I'm so afraid&quot;, &quot;World turning&quot; and &quot;Landslide&quot; are all still being played in concert today). Of particular interest is the fact that you can still hear the former Fleetwood Mac blues on this album, as opposed to the subsequent releases; a song like the magnificent and underscored ballad &quot;Warm ways&quot; is possibly one of Christine McVie's best songs ever, and it shines with the distinct bluesy Mac approach of albums like &quot;Bare trees&quot; or &quot;Future games&quot;. This extended version also includes a bluesy instrumental titled &quot;Jam # 2&quot; that proves Lindsey Buckingham's versatility as a guitar player; and the band's redefined version of &quot;Crystal&quot; features the same musical approach that made Fleetwood Mac the darlings of the british musical industry in the late 60s. There are a couple of lesser moments (&quot;Sugar Daddy&quot; is somewhat forgettable in spite of its enjoyable melody, and the single version of &quot;Blue letter&quot; sounds like an exact copy of the album version), but one thing you will not find on this album is a bad song - they are all perfectly segued, moving like one natural, coherent and beautiful chain of songs, which is quite surprising given the very distinctive and different personalities of the band's songwriters.<br />This album defined what would be known as Fleetwood Mac's definitive sound, and shines with the innocence and excitement of five people writing a whole new chapter and following their unique artistic vision. Although not as audacious as &quot;Tusk&quot; and not quite as powerful as &quot;Rumours&quot;, &quot;Fleetwood Mac&quot; more than makes up for its minor flaws with heartfelt sincerity and beautiful songs. It's an album that any rock fan should check out, and this wonderful expanded re-issue is the perfect opportunity for both the profane AND the diehards to remember how everything started coming together for Fleetwood Mac.
B00002ZMNV|5.0|in the 2 1/2 hours of the s&amp;m concert my mind changed from &quot;what were they thinking&quot; to &quot;what was i thinking&quot; this is a great concert and dvd. who would have thought...metallica with an orchestra. well they took a risk and it paid off big time. what a concert...go buy this now if u don't have it. don't even finish reading my review cuz it's time u could spend watching this dvd. the extra stuff is awesome(40 min. doc., angles,etc..) and the 2 new songs are awesome. the orchestra adds even more life to the songs(for whom the bell tolls has never sounded better) point is go buy it...u won't regret it..trust me
B000002TQV|3.0|Radiohead`s sophomore album is an upgrade of their promising but uneven debut &quot;Pablo Honey&quot;. A strong and compelling rock record, &quot;The Bends&quot; is a bit above most of the uninteresting britpop bands that dominated the charts during the mid-nineties. Radiohead deliver some appealing and well-crafted indie rock moments here, more guitar-oriented than their latest releases (that incorporate electronic influences). Although a good album, &quot;The Bends&quot; is not quite a classic, since it has more filler than it should and is lacking in diverity (a couple of songs are too similar). Still, it offers many memorable moments like the mellow &quot;High and Dry&quot;, the moody &quot;Nice Dream&quot;, the ethereal &quot;Fake Plastic Trees&quot; and especially the haunting &quot;Street Spirit (Fade Out)&quot;, one of the band`s best songs. Despite being too overrated, this Radioheah effort is an enticing listen that presents a few gems worth discovering.<br />Recommended.
0553269631|5.0|I am not finished reading this book, but I will give it 5 stars anyway.  What I object to is browsing through the other reviews given this novel only to find that Amazon.com has included a review from a national publication which reveals the ending of the story, until now unknown to me.  The reviewers seem to be able to demonstrate enough tact not to mention too much of the plot; Amazon should be able to do the same.  In the future I will be more careful in what I read on this website.
B00003CXMG|3.0|A good movie about rock, &quot;Almost Famous&quot; is also one of Cameron Crowe`s best efforts to date. Focusing the daily tribulations of fictional band Stillwater, this story intends to give a scoop into the backstage of the music world, focusing the band members` relationships, the contrived press connections, the groupies` appeal and the extremely difficuld career in the music business. Billy Crudup and Kate Hudson shine as the young, innocent and passionate teen couple who is discovering life through music and must face a new and complex world that forces them to make hard choices. &quot;Almost Famous&quot; is clearly a labour of love, since everyone seems to be enjoying what they`re doing, and the fact that some elements are based on Cameron Crowe`s experiences also helps. Enjoyable and bittersweet, offering strong acting, direction and music, this movie is a worthwile cinematic experience that doesn`t quite change the world but makes it look like a better place. <br />Above average.
B00005O3VC|5.0|This movie is great. It's one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. It'll make you laugh every time you watch it. I love this movie and i think that if u love hilarious movies that this is the movie for you. This movie is no doubt a classic. Later
0679428895|3.0|Overall I would consider this book a good read.  It is definitely fast paced with a good developing story.  However, once the story is developed it ends abruptly.  The book left me wanting more of a conclusion.  I would have enjoyed Harris writing an additional five chapters in order to conclude in a way that would be appealing to me.  I feel that Harris could have expanded more on the ending because it came across very blunt.  The rising actions were developed well but the climax seemed to come towards the end of the book, which caused a rushed falling action and conclusion.  The attention that the eruption actually received was very minimal which caused for a few tedious moments throughout the book.<br />It is a great book when discussing the history of the ancient Roman people and their way of life.  It is obvious that Harris is an extraordinary historian, but his ability at creating the fiction to this historical fiction novel seemed to be difficult for him.  Harris' ability to incorporate his historical knowledge into the book came naturally and was very informative.  If you are interested in a very educating and enlightening book then this is a great pick.
B00006879E|5.0|This album is purely original in style, sound and production. The fusion of alternative, soul, punk and rock music works wonderfully as it brings addictive tunes to our ears. The vocals are mesmerizing and the lyrics are starkly real.<br />Every track tells a tale about this gal named Jane. Highlights are: Harder to Breathe, This Love, Shiver, She Will Be Loved, The Sun, Through With You, Not Coming Home and Sweet Goodbye.<br />The album is very personal, but it's not a \\"break up\\" album. Its essence is very similar to Tori Amos' Boys for Pele: rebellious, personal and unapologetic. It will resonate with you regardless of your emotional and mental state. First, the melodies will capture your attention and then the lyrics will shock, sooth and please you.<br />Very highly recommended.
B00005JL7Q|5.0|Somehow Hugh Grant and the film-makers turned this extremely shallow and emotionally clueless person into someone I really cared about. The young man, the Marcus character, was so sad and funny. He reminded me a little too much of grade school (shudder).<br />Toni Collette as the mum was both pitiful and hopeful, all at once.<br />If you want to watch a movie about how people really can change for the better sometimes, here it is. There is romance, and there is comedy, but I think this movie kind of rises above those (rather played-out) genres.<br />I loved it.
B0001LJCPC|5.0|Its a damn good soundtrack. I enjoyed listening to it as much as the first soundtrack. Recommended- yes. Man this movie is gonna be great.
B0001BKAEY|5.0|I got this the other day and i was worried if i was not going to like it as it got so much bad reviews. What are they talking about. This film is brilliant! <BR>  The special effects are still fantastic and the characters are still going strong. <BR>  This is very emotional and dramatic and at the same time there is still great action to enjoy. I have to say this is better than the second but nothing can live up to the first. <BR>  The one thing that disappointed me is the fight between Neo and Agent Smith. I feel this was over the top as they were just flying around in the air and it felt like superman. I did not like how they just made big great holes in the wall and the ground. It was a little stupid but was exciting to see the final battle between the two. At this point there is still great special effects. <BR>  I am sad to see it finish but i hope there will be more matrix in the future. I think this film gives the perfect ending. One to buy! (Watch out for the battle between the machines-Excellent)
B000062YAZ|5.0|First of all I dont think its fair to to say Metallica's Master Of Puppets is better than Reign In Blood or vice versa.Theyre really like apples and oranges if you ask me.In my opinion Master Of Puppets does have the better songs and has slightly better musicianship with great vocals and better guitar solos but Reign In Blood is probably the most addictive and heavy not to mention fastes piece of work that the thrash scene has ever produced.True South Of Heaven is a little better being longer and more brooding but Reign In Blood to me is just pure punk and thrash.Theres so much attitude to this record Id put it up there with Guns N Roses' Appetite For Destruction,Sex Pistols Never Mind The Bullocks and Patti Smith's horses.Its impossible for me to pick a favorite song off this record because theyre all excellent songs but Criminally Insane is the one that sticks out the most.If you listen to this album just once youll be hooked.Trust me.
B000002LEU|4.0|The only reason that I'm not giving this album 5 stars is that, despite loving JD with a passion, I've always had somewhat mixed feelings about their singles.<br />The songs themselves are flat-out great, of course.  But Hannett's production always worked better when he pared things down rather than expanding them (hence the genius of the minimalist Unknown Pleasures).  <br />A classic illustration of this is Atmosphere.  On the Heart and Soul collection, there's a haunting early version of the song featuring what sounds to be a simple organ line in the background (it might have been a synth, but it sounds like an organ).  Simple, sad and beautiful.  Hannett's single, however, features many layers of synth strings that make a song of bitter disillutionment overly sentimental.<br />Ditto for the dance version of She's Lost Control.  I admit that this version works alot better in a pub, but it doesn't compare with menacing proto-grunge guitar of the album recording.<br />Of course, these are the greatest rock songs ever written, so take what I've said with a grain of salt.
0553278398|4.0|This is the first book I read by the author Asimov.  I know there are many more famous books from him like the Robots collections and Foundation.  I picked this one for the first book simply because this is the first entry to the Foundation series, on a chronological sense.  I must say surprisingly, this is a very easy-to-read (compare to Dune, Lord of the Ring, etc), but exciting, and full-of-surprises book.  At times, it also gives us thoughful issues (e.g. can we 'predict' the future?), which is what we are anticipating from a sci-fi.  I know from many many readers that Foundation is the best among all the volumes, but I can imagine that this is already an enjoyable read, I cannot imagine how exciting the Foundation book will be.  It also thrills me to read all other series (Robot, Empire, etc) so as to get a full understanding of the history under Asimov's reign.  I recommend this one to everyone who has never touch Asimov's work before.
0783227434|4.0|I Liked the 3rd installment in the Evil dead series. ARmy of Darkness is a wacky horror-ish movie about bruce cambell whooping zombies, skeletons, and his evil twin throughout the middle ages. Army of Darkness DOES have some pacing problems, and some of the scenes dont make sense (when ash first shows off his boom-stick, he fired THREE shots from a two- barrel shotgun. whatever.). but hey, go into this movi expecting a great horror film like The Shining, and you will  hate it.  watch this expecting a fun-filled adventure with exploding zombies, and you find a lot to enjoy. one last thing: if youre finding the movie a little dull, just keep in there for the awesome ending. you wont regret it.
0739313126|4.0|Riveting.  You want to keep driving and listening because the story builds on itself that you don't want to stop.  Fast-paced story that slows down in the second half, culminating in a less than dramatic ending as the first half of the book builds on.  Paul Michael does an excellent job of utilizing different accents with the numerous nationalities involved with the characters to make the story effective, even though some of his efforts to speak as Sophie Neveu, French-bourn heroine, trails off and is hard to hear at the same set audio level as the rest of the characters.  From the beginning, you are amazed at the extensive research that Dale Brown had to put into the development of the story.  So much so, that the many issues and facts presented to you, and used as reference in the story, want you to do your own research to see if it's fact.  I have listened to well over 1,000 adventure/mystery/sci-fi audio books over the last 15 years, and this is up with the best of them.
0385470819|1.0|It's sad a talented storyteller (though not writer) like Grisham should choose to make his fame on a book that pretty much labels white people the devils (and blacks, angels).  Ever since the Reagan years it's been fashionable for writers and movie producers to trash white people, as if all whites are inherently evil, murderous, devilish, stereotyped, and incompetent.  If you agree with Grisham's view of the world, please enjoy this book.
0790729970|5.0|Ace Ventura: Pet Detective was really the movie that put Jim Carrey on the map. The Mask is the movie that solidified his position as the funniest guy in Hollywood.<br />In The Mask Carrey plays Stanley Ipkiss the nice guy who always finishes last. He gets a hold of a mask that once he wears it his innermost desires come to life. Will Stanley let the mask rule his life or will he realize he's great just the way he is. You'll just have to watch the movie to find out.<br />Jim Carrey gave an awesome performance in this movie. He was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Actor in a musical or comedy. He didn't win it, but his performance was definetly good enough to have one it. Ipkiss is in no way Ace Ventura. He isn't the confident wild man that Ace is. He's the nice guy that finishes last that everyone likes. Carrey plays it to perfection. Once the Mask is put on Carrey becomes that wild man that we love so much and thats where the movie really excels. The animation they used for Ipkiss with the mask on is great and Carrey plays the wild man better than anyone ever. He sings, dances, and throws out some of the best one liners ever. Stanley Ipkiss is a great character and thanks to Jim Carrey for making him that.<br />Cameron Diaz is great in the film. This was the movie that introduced us to the formere model. She holds her own real well in the movie. Carrey was so hot when he did this movie riding the success of Pet Detective and she shines in this role. She is absolutely gorgeous throughout the whole film. She's not a bad actress and I really wish she'd do more roles like this.<br />The extras on the DVD are decent. There are some deleted scenes that are alright and the directors commentary is decent as well. The movie can be viewed in full or widescreen format and it features dolby digital sound. I wish they'd done some more with the special features though. They could have done something cool with the music or special effects, but they didn't.<br />The music isgreat in this film. I have the soundtrack as well and the music helps make this film great. Jim Carrey is great when he dances and sings in &quot;Cuban Pete.&quot; There are some great swing songs like Royal Crown Revues &quot;Hey Pachuco played in the movie. This really could be considered a musical in many ways.<br />This is a fantastic film. It's fun the whole familiy can relate to and is a must own. The DVD is pretty easy to find cheap, so don't miss out on this fun film.
B00005JMEW|5.0|Just bought this film today and watched it for the first time due to all the great reviews I read and of course having Tarantino's name on it sure helps. One Word can only be used to describe this movie: WOW! I had high hopes and this surely surpassed them. I can't wait for Volume: 2 this Friday, which is already getting rave reviews and being called better than the first Volume which is hard to believe but most likely true. Uma Thurman rocks in this movie! I had no idea she could pull off a physical role like this and I can't picture anyone else in the role of The Bride now. Lucy Liu is also shockingly good in this ruthless role where she cuts off the head of anyone not in agreement with her. I love the fight scenes of course, with the over the top and unrealistic gore, but its the soundtrack that really molds the movie together and fits perfectly with each scene. This is easily my favorite Tarantino film (or at least until Volume: 2 comes out!) because it is less talky than his other three movies and it showcases the action and style we all love him for. Loved the cliffhanger ending and can't wait to actually see Daryl Hannah (Elle), Michael Madsen (Budd), and especially the man himself, David Carradine, in action as BILL on April 16th!
B00003CXAT|5.0|If you haven't seen Jurrasic Park yet you really need to crawl out from the rock you've been under for the last decade.<br />Off the coast of Costa Rica a wealthy business man is creating the theme park of all theme parks. He is secretly cloning dinosaurs and will soon feature them in this park. Before Hammond(Richard Attenborough) can open his park he must get it sponsored by the tops in the dinosaur and science fields. Alan Grant(Sam Neil), Ellie Sattler(Laura Dern) Ian Malcom(Jeff Goldblum) and Hammonds two grandchildren are brought to experience the park. After a storm and some suspected sabotage the movie turns into a race to get out of the Park alive.<br />Steven Spielberg has made a cinematic masterpiece with this movie. I can remember being nine years old and just being awe inspired by this movie. The Dinosaurs look fantastic. Industrial Light and Magic did a great job creating the prehistoric creatures. They really are breat defeying throughout the movie. The movie is shot so well. Spielberg is a master story teller and he sets everything up well. The movie uses so many things to make it good. There is action, suspense, comedey, and just enough seriousness to make you think.<br />Jeff Goldblum as Ian Macolm to me had the best performance of all the actors in the film. Very few people in Hollywood can reach the level of weirdness that Goldblum can achieve on screen and he has another one of a kind performance in Jurrassic Park.<br />All the other actors are solid all the way across. It'a a fantastic cast. It's solid all the way around with stars like Neil, Dern, Samuel L. Jackson, and Goldblum. Goldblum has the best performance, but the others don't disappoint.<br />The music is great in Jurrasic Park. Once again John Williams has shown us why he's the man in one of the best movies ever scored. If you like to see why Williams is the best just watch the movie and see how his score makes the movie so much better.<br />This is a fantastic movie. At one time itwas the most successful movie in box office history and it's easy to see why. It's a fun movie. It doesn't insult the hit book it was made from. It raises questions on whether cloning should be legal. It's a cinematic masterpiece that should be enjoyed by all.
B000002IO8|5.0|I'm not going to write a lot about this album; other customers have already sumed it up quite well. This album has almost no elements of slow boring classical, as one might recall albums as No Sun I Venice or Concorde, it swings just as hard as for instance, Miles Davis would. A new comer to MJQ , but not jazz will love this album!!!!!!!!
0679428895|3.0|Robert Harris's Pompeii is the perfect combination of factual history and enticing plot that captivates readers from the very first page till the last. Once I began to read this novel, I literally couldn't put it down!  I found Harris's depiction of Roman life to be very accurate and gave the reader a great view into the world of the typical Roman.  Harris lays the foundation for the reader by providing brief descriptions of many elements of Roman life without straying from the plot too much.  He skillfully unravels the plot with precise timing adding the just the right amount of suspense.  This novel is far more than the story of Mount Vesuvius erupting; in fact most of the novel takes place before the eruption.  <br /> Harris allows the reader to see through the eyes of many different people living throughout the Roman Empire.  He not only examines the wealthy patrician class but also slaves and \\"middle class\\" Romans.  I believe the best part of Pompeii is the characters, because inevitably we all know Mount Vesuvius is going to erupt. I have to admit I was disappointed with Harris's ending.  He so gracefully laid out the plot of Pompeii only to end the book in a mere two pages. It seems as though he took his time developing the story then hurried to end it. Overall, I thought this was a really good book, but the ending was disappointing.
B000002WNP|5.0|This is simply a beautiful collector's edition of Elvis's music.You get so many fun filled hours thanks to this set, and not only do you get great music. You also get some Elvis stamps and an Elvis booklet with wonderful colorful photos ( some are black and white I think.)<BR>A beautiful collection. For someone who was such a beautiful man ( it's a shame how his life went during the last few years of his life. )<BR>Even so I still believe that Elvis was a very beautiful person inside and out. He is one of the few people who is able to bridge a gap between generations.<BR> People still talk about him today as if he was still with us in person.<BR>I am only in my early twenty's but I love his music so much. I think it's great that there still releasing some of his videos and live shows on DVD's . So that new Elvis fans can enjoy what he was able to give to the world.<BR>If you want to get just one thing abut Elvis, and learn why he is still talked about today. Then please get this set, even though it is rather expansive. I promise you that your hard worked money will be spent very well.<BR> Elvis may be gone, but he still lives through memories of music, stories, and now DVDs
0385336810|4.0|Not as good as the shopaholic series but still a fun read.  I laughed out loud a times, very witty.   I think the romance and how it came about was a bit farfetched.  But still, a fun, enjoyable read.
B000001FI7|5.0|This is my first ceedee in the trip-hop genre. It wuz recommended to me by a friend who likes this kind of stuff. At first it wuz a little scary to listen to. But wen it got to track #2, it wuz so haunting. &quot;nobody loves meee...its truu&quot;<BR>Haha that stayed in my mind for a long time so i kept on listening to the ceedee. The vocal is great and the songs sound mysterious. I like to listen to it when i'm doing art and also when it rains. haha i dont knoe why.  I know i grew to like this ceedee tho :D. Its great.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|I love this CD! I first heard Gavin on One Tree Hill (looks down ashamedly that it took a WB show to open my eyes to a great artist) Each and every track has its own amazing feel. From start to finish i am amazed; from Follow Through, an unashamed song of love and need, to Crush, a story of unsure first love. This is music that you keep coming back to, and can always relate to. This is for anyone and everyone. The 10 bucks is worth it, believe me. And if you don't, just listen to the sample clips, and you'll understand. Happy listening!
B00005ASGG|5.0|So sad to die of a broken heart. The cactus rose will alway be of keen meaning. The ending is so tearfull. The simple musical chords tug  on the heart. Nothings too good for the man who shot Libert Valance.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|WICKED is totally wicked!!!  I love this CD -- Stephen Schwartz has written a deeply satisfying old-fashioned score with a 21st Century sensibility.  Idina, Kristin &amp; Company blow their pipes out!  Buy this CD, read the novel, and GO SEE SHOW!!!  If you're crazy nuts about musical theatre, the show is a mind-blower!  You're body will defy gravity as you soar toward musical theatre heaven.  You'll be kicking yourself years from now if you miss the divinity of Idina &amp; Kristin!!!
B000003BQW|5.0|By the late 80s the Ramones where starting to burn out.  While they still made good rock music, relations in the band were dwendling and they were constantly changing thier sound in hope for that lucky break.  <br />I have to say that Dee Dee being replaced by CJ did wonders for the band.  The new young bassist brought back alot of the energy for the band and this album is a return to the classic Ramones formula.<br />And it shows.  Joey hasnt sounded this desperate/energized/pissed off since Road to Ruin.  The Ramones sound so full of life and ready to take on the world.  It's a shame that more people havent heard about this album.  <br />It kicks off to a perfect start with Censorsh*t, an anti- censorship rant; one of the Ramones most well written tunes.  <BR>The Job that Ate my Brian and Anxiety are punk classics written by Marky.  <br />Dee Dee contributes Poison Heart, Strength to Endure and Main Man, all great songs with very honest lyrics.<br />It's Gonna be Alright is a dedication to the Ramones fans for sticking with them for so long. <BR>-\\"Got good feelings about this year,<BR>-All is very well CJ is here<BR>-92 spells more fun lets get into gear\\"<br />Tommorow she Goes Away and Hiedi is a Headcase are both warped love songs.  I won't let it Happen is an acustic ballad good enough to compete with I want you Around.  <BR>The album closes with Touring, a rip off of thier own \\"Rock n Roll High School\\" dedicating another song to the love of playing music and being on the road.<br />This isnt just one of the best Ramones albums, its an underated classic that all punkers need to listen to.
B00004YKUY|5.0|Awesome album, even better to me now than when I first bought it back in 2001. Although I only liked about half of the disc on my first few listens, I have come to realize that this album is the best thing Journey has put out since Frontiers. I mean, don't get me wrong, Raised on Radio and Trial by Fire are great albums, but I feel they are also very uneven.<br />My favorites on Arrival:<BR>Live And Breathe<BR>World Gone Wild<BR>Livin' To Do<BR>Higher Place<BR>Nothin' Comes Close<BR>We Will Meet Again<br />To anyone who says Journey isn't Journey without Steve Perry, you are wrong. Journey isn't Journey without Neal Schon, guitar master!!!
B000099T2L|5.0|Don't underestimate Beyonce ya'll. She's not just another Ashanti. She can sing and this CD proves it. Her earlier work that she did with Destiny's Child really prepared her to be able to tackle R&amp;B and so far she has just done that. I wish Beyonce the best of luck. Forget the hata'z. Standout tracks include:<br />Naughty Girl<BR>Me, Myself &amp; I<BR>Crazy in Love<BR>Signs<br />Pick this CD up now!
B0000AUHQT|5.0|Saddest book I've ever read and saddest movie I've ever seen.<BR>The book was excellent and the actors' played the parts with great accuracy (Gatsby's neighbor is one of the attorneys from the Law and Order series).  If sad is what you're looking for, then read the book first, then get the movie.  The only &quot;chick flick&quot; that a guy wouldn't mind watching!
B0001HAISG|4.0|This movie succeeds in both the creation of an exciting adventure and of a \\"coming of age\\" film.  The frightening experience of puberty was handled breathtakingly and with sensitivity (and wouldn't everyone love to take Peter's lead and not have to experience that part of it at all?!).  My 37-year-old frame left the theatre full of youthful energy, and remembering that however scary growing up is -- you can retain your sense of wonder and love of fun (without all the schtick that plagued Hook).  Adulthood need not make you \\"old, alone, and done for.\\"
B000002KLZ|5.0|I admit I'm a fan of The Mac.  I also admit that, like another who has written a review here, 'Tusk' is my favourite Mac album.  And I love live albums.  So this was a real treat for me.  It's simply a fantastic mesh of the first three Mac albums made with the great Buckingham/Nicks, with a gritty workout on Peter Green's 'Oh Well' thrown in for good measure.<BR>Lindsey Buckingham reveals himself in the course of this album to be a truly absurdly talented guy.  In particular his rendition of 'Never Going Back' is just beautiful.  He more than holds his own in 'Oh Well' and delivers a blistering 'I'm So Afraid' to boot.  Though some have expressed irritation for it, the version of 'Not That Funny' is intriguing - he sounds as if he's performing some sort of rock n roll exorcism to the manic accompaniment of Mick.  The screams and yelps are great fun. <BR>Stevie also sounds fantastic, especially on Landslide (emotionally charged) and Rhiannon, in which she summons up the Welsh witch and sends chills down the spine.  'Fireflies' is an undiscovered gem of a tune, which should have been on an album somewhere.  The version of 'Sara' is the longer one which was trimmed for the Tusk album, but did appear on the green Greatest Hits album which came out in the early 90s.  It's equally wicked.  Nicks floats through the song like a dream.<BR>Christine McVie is the anchor of it all...she's just great.  The (then)new song 'Over &amp; Over' twinkles in with keyboard and swooping vocals.  'Say You Love Me' provides a rousing intro (along with a fantastic 'Monday Morning') to the album.<BR>As for the Amazing Rhythm Section...they are solid, subtle, and cool as ice, and on 'Oh Well' they dig into their blues roots like men possessed.<BR>All in all...this album has not been off my record player for a long time.  There is a song for every mood, and The Mac successfully plumb emotional depths rarely seen in today's music.<BR>Buy it!  It's great!  Truly one of their finest times captured(lucky for us) on an album.
B00006690G|5.0|Untouchable, I don't care what you say this album in my eyes is considered to be one of the best albums in hip-hop ever made to date!  I mean no hatin on Dre, Snoop, Luda, Ice Cube, Master P, but this cd is a must have.  Eminem rips it up.  If you don't believe me then go buy it.  He is the most innovative artist while still maintaining smooth catchy songs.  Bottom line go buy it!
1594200106|5.0|I bought the book at the Airport without much expectations, rather as a way to help me go thorugh my two-hours flight. I opened it right before take-off, and not only did I read it to the moment I was forced to leave the plane, but I kept on reading it while waiting for my luggage, on the taxi, and until approximately 2 AM at home (sorry, honey).<br />The Shadow of the Wind is one of those books whose essence is hard to transmit to someone who hasn't read it. Mr Zafon has a magical way of describing places and people while keeping you turning the pages at the speed of light. The succession of scenes is breathtaking, as are each individual scene (my favourite by far is the cementery of forgotten books). Seemingly unimportant characters suddenly become central, while new characters seem to appear all the time. Throughout the book, the main story wanders around in intricate and unexpected ways while at the same time remaining coherent.<br />The books includes some elements of Umberto Eco (The Name of the Rose) and Garcia Marquez (whose \\"Magical Realism\\" was borrowed by Tim Burton for \\"Big Fish\\").<br />All in all, the only sure thing is that I haven't found a story like this in a long time, and next time Mr Zafon gets another book out, I'll be the first on Amazon's pre-order list.
0380730367|5.0|It was startling to read this book because Dennis Lehane's writing style is so distinctly unique and engrossing.  I was drawn into the story from the start because the narrative was funny, smart and original.  I particularly enjoyed the descriptions of the characters which made them come alive on the page which is a real accomplishment for any writer.<br />The plot was intriguing and compelling and I somehow ended up reading the whole book in the space of one day (and most of the night!). I had never read a Kenzie / Gennaro / Rogowski crime novel before and so I was new to the characters, but they all seemed to me to be very well developed and interesting.  I even liked the fact that Bubba was more like a superhero than a real life human being.  However, I was shocked by some of the things that the lead characters did, for example, arranging for criminals to be beaten up severely and other shady dealings which made me a bit uncomfortable.<br />Overall Prayers For Rain was a great introduction for me into this series.  The excellent humour was a real surprise and definitely made me read on and there was a satisfying twist at the end.  The twists and turns of the plot were entertaining and the action scenes were described really well.  I'll certainly be checking out other Lehane books in the future.  Highly Recommended.<br />JoAnne

For those of you who happen to be fundamental Christians, do yourselves a favor and do not read this book, you will probably be offended by its controversial content.  For everyone else out there, it's an exciting book that brings into light other theories that do exist and have been documented about Christ and the bible intertwined with a fictional murder mystery.

0312263120|2.0|Looks like Dan Brown may be getting Clancyitis -- he had some good books and now he is starting to crank up the factory production.  This wasn't nearly as good as the other books by Dan Brown I've read.  In particular, try Deception Point.  <br />In Digital Fortress, you can see it coming from a mile away.  There are very few real twists or suprises, the action is pretty slow, and the &quot;science&quot; is hardly new or exciting.  Maybe those who are not familiar with computers or security would have an easier time getting shocked or suprised by anything in this book.  Save your money, save your time -- read Digital Fortress if you want a good Dan Brown book.
B00000I8UE|5.0|This album is pure genius (never mind the NY Times review), from a truly underrated musical genius. Pure jazz fans will love this album and for those who are searching, Wilson's voice has a down-home feel to it, like she's welcoming you to Sunday dinner. The experience for me, a native of the south, is sometimes ethereal. It's pure, not filled up with repetitious gospel chorus in the background, but with music that fills the soul. She also is sometimes thought of as an &quot;alternative jazz&quot; artist because she uses acoustic guitars, which can make her music sound &quot;folksy&quot;. I don't think Wilson is too concerned about labels, yet it's clear she is deeply rooted in the music of the Mississippi Delta, as any listener can attest to. I've had this album since its release in '99 and I never tire of it! There are some notable songs: &quot;Sky and Sea (Blue in Green)&quot;, &quot;Time after Time&quot; (Lauper's old tune), and &quot;Piper&quot;. All her music is a wonder to listen to, but this album is definitely one of her greats. She does Miles justice and then some!
B000001Y42|4.0|Once upon a time Limp Bizkit was just getting started and believe it or not, making great music.  Three Dollar Bill Yall$ is one of the best examples of the fuse of rap and metal (which we all commonly now know as nu-metal).  However, most nu-metal bands lack the rap background to make anything that sounds genuine unlike Limp Bizkit at the time.  From start to finish this is an awesome album.  DJ Lethal in particular adds a lot to the sound.  Production wise, Ross Robinson did a great job as he almost always does.  My favorite tracks include &quot;Counterfeit&quot;, &quot;Stuck&quot;, &quot;Nobody Loves Me&quot;, and &quot;Pollution&quot;.  Unfortunatly, with time the taste of fame took away from the band's sound...especially from Fred Durst who became an egomaniac.  It's hard to believe the man that wrote the masterpieces on here is now writing garbage like &quot;My Generation&quot;.  This is a great album to look back on though and see how great this band could have become.  Now a days, Limp Bizkit are washed up and their success is undoubtebly coming to a close.  If you ever hear Fred talk about this album now a days he bashes the shxt out of it, especially Ross's production...I guess now Fred only digs heartless pop tunes.  Over all though, this one album wonder deffinatly earns a spot on my personal favorite metal CDs of all time.  I suggest any fans of old-school Limp check out the band Fallguy.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This movie was, sad, thrilling, scary,funny, adventurous, and 24/7 action. This was the best movie i have ever seen. I would recommend keeping this dvd in your collection.

B000006V31|4.0|OK, I'll try to sum up this CD in a nutshell:<br />Rod Stewart meets Peter Green sung by the Black Crowes with Robert Plant pulling the strings and Jimmy Page nodding along :-P<br />Seriously, these guys obviously liked and were heavily inspired by Early Fleetwood Mac, John Mayall, Genesis, Hendrix, and most oviously Zed Zeppellin. This is not to say they necessarily copy these bands but the influence is definitely there. Enjoyable stuff if that white boy blues-rock sound is your thing. I'm also a sucker for this kind of things and, as this one has two bonus tracks (sound quality is diminished but they are surely listenable), I was hooked :o)

B0000VAFO0|5.0|I can't help but think that the mixed reception this film has gotten has more to do with its pretensions than its reality.  It is a very competent, if stagecrafty, vampire film.  It features lots of atmosphere and dramatic, gothic filmogaphy.  It takes place in a setting that is half Prague and half London - underground scenes, castle scenes and even a chase or two.  Stunts and costumes are excellent - the film uses costumes and stunts rather than CGI for it's effects - for a result that is, as someone else remarked, half Dracula and half Matrix.<br />The premise isn't completely original, but is well worked out, making vampires and lycans (werewolves) a kind of medical accident arising in the depth of the plague years developing a complex hierarchical society with vampires at the to and the werewolves at the bottom.  This somehow impacted, and lycans and vampires are at war, with the werewolves at a disadvantage.<br />In the midst of a hunt Selene (Kate Beckensale) finds that a nest of werewolves is determined to capture a human - Michael Corvin (Scott Speedman).  Her investigation puts her at odds with her coven's leader, Kraven (Shane Brolly), and the ensuing events reveal something so menacing that vampire and lycan are threatened.<br />In essence this is a pure action film not a horror film.  There are gestures at romance and the politics of the night but the primary movement is set scene - chase scene - fight scene.  While the acting is generally competent - Beckensale is quite good, and Michael Sheen and Bill Nighy are excellent as lycan and vampire elders - it isn't spectacular.  Certainly not good enough to make what director Ken Wiseman thought might be 'the greatest vampire story ever told.'<br />Seen purely as what it is, 'Underworld' is an enjoyable, fast-paced film that presents in interesting vision of life in the darkness.  Held against an arbitrary standard of greatness or a belief that it is the deconstruction of the vampire mythos, it falls short.  The Dracula remake is still the pinnacle of this genre, and may be for some time to come.  One the other hand I could watch films like this one after another without a single qualm.<br />The extras, feature films on the making of , etc., and several commentaries are excellent, and throw some interesting light on the film and its characters.  If you like foreboding technogothic thrillers this is made for you.The Dracula remake is still the pinnacle of this genre, and may be for some time to come.

B0000DD7NL|3.0|People may say that anyone who gives Alicia Keys anything less than four stars is a hater, but to be honest, this COULD'VE been a great album. It seems like Alicia took a long time to even come back with this album because she didn't want to risk being overexposed again like she was back in 2001. But sometimes being in the lab for a long time does NOT result in a classic album.<br />The only songs that really stand out on here are the singles, \\"You Don't Know My Name\\" and \\"If I Ain't Got You\\". \\"Wake Up\\" and \\"Slow Down\\" are pretty decent too, but nothing else on the album really compares to those songs. Alicia still has a great voice, and her exceptional way of ticking the ivories definitely hasn't gone away, but the songs she chooses sometimes leave a little to be desired.<br />There's one song, \\"Dragon Days\\", which is just weird; and Timbaland's contribution \\"Heartburn\\" sounds like a desperate attempt to make a song for the club. When I heard it I was like, \\"Stick with what you know, Alicia.\\" And I'm also glad that that song \\"Streets of New York\\" (with Nas and Rakim) didn't end up on here (sorry, I'm not gonna pretend I like that song).<br />Some of these other songs fail lyrically, especially \\"Samsonite Man\\". And I've noticed that a lot of people seem to like \\"Diary\\" with Tony Toni Ton&eacute; (actually, they only play music, and Raphael isn't there), and the production is GREAT; if only I could say the same for the lyrics. And didn't \\"When You Really Love Someone\\" used to be called \\"Fallin'\\"?<br />One more thing I'd like to mention is that in the liner notes it lists info for the song \\"Ain't No Reason To\\", but there's no such song on the album. Anyway, The Diary of Alicia Keys isn't a horrible entry, but I just don't think it's as good as people have made it out to be.<br />Anthony Rupert
0553582453|4.0|Hobb is consistently such a good fantasy writer and this book is not an exception to that rule. It isn't her best, which is why I'm giving it four stars instead of five, but I'm impressed at the number of books that she's managed to write while still keeping me enthusiastically attached to the series. I was actually pretty seriously disappointed that the final book in the trilogy won't be released in paperback for another six months.<br />People have pointed out that this is a character development book, and that's clearly true. But there isn't anything wrong with that and endless saga writers like Rober Jordan should take a lesson about how it's done.

1592400876|2.0|It is a good thing that a book on punctuation is a best-seller; it's just a pity it's this one.<br /><br />All the good work Lynne Truss does in conveying her message (viz., punctuation matters) is undone by her hectoring tone, dismal attempts at humour (made worse by a tendency to point out the punch-lines) and, in the final analysis, lack of credibility: having set out rules she then reverses over them, makes egregious appeals to authority and, every now and then, just gets things flat out wrong.<br /><br />You might forgive that were there any humility in her prose, but there isn't. The first rule of hubris is: if you're going to be a clever-clogs, make sure you're right, because readers won't cut you any slack if you're not.<br /><br />Lynne Truss isn't always right.<br /><br />A case in point: in her introduction, Truss states (rather presumptuously) on behalf of her fellow sticklers, \\"we got very worked up after 9/11 not because of Osama bin-Laden but because people on the radio kept saying \\"enormity\\" when they meant \\"magnitude\\", and we hate that\\".<br /><br />Now ignoring the curious impression this creates of Truss's value scheme, she is quite wrong to take umbrage here: \\"Enormity\\", in British English, means \\"extreme wickedness\\". The magnitude and the awfulness of an act of mass murder are closely correlated. So, even in British English, it is perfectly right to talk of the \\"enormity\\" of September 11. But if any of the voices Truss heard on the radio were American, they had another excuse. In American English enormity *does* mean \\"magnitude\\". Since Truss is so enamoured with appeals to authority, it is odd she didn't check that with the best authority on American English, Webster's dictionary. I should mention that I read English edition of this book. Given Truss's proclivities as regards the cultural heathen, it will be interesting to see whether her American sub-editors pluck up enough courage to point this out.<br /><br />When she does make them, Truss's appeals to authority are even more irritating, particularly where they contradict her own rules or justify her own errors: So, the author patiently explains that an apostrophe is required to indicate possession except in the case of a possessive pronoun (i.e., \\"mine\\", \\"yours\\", \\"his\\", \\"hers\\", \\"its\\", \\"ours\\" and \\"theirs\\"). Now, I had always wondered why a possessive \\"its\\" doesn't have an apostrophe, and this explains it nicely. But then Truss completely undermines her own rule and appeals to the authority of Virginia Woolf:<br /><br />\\"Someone wrote to say that my use of \\"one's\\" was wrong (\\"a common error\\"), and that it should be \\"ones\\". This is such rubbish that I refuse to argue about it. Go and tell Virginia Woolf it should be \\"A Room of Ones Own\\" and see how far you get.\\"<br /><br />Virginia Woolf's been dead for over fifty years, so this is pretty tough to do. But it doesn't mean Virginia Woolf was right. And Truss fails explain why this is \\"such rubbish\\".<br /><br />Finally, even the book's title betrays the author's questionable sense of humour. I don't think she gets the joke. It has nothing to do with waiters or pistols (perhaps a maiden aunt told her that one?) and certainly doesn't need a \\"badly punctuated wildlife manual\\" to work, because it isn't a grammatical play; it's an oral one. The joke doesn't work when you write it down, precisely because of the ambiguous comma. You have to say it out loud (in spoken English, there is no punctuation at all).<br /><br />I hope they re-title the New Zealand edition of this book, because the local version of the joke (which employs a delightful expression from NZ English) is funnier: The Kiwi, it is said, is the most anti-social bird in the bush, and no-one likes to invite it to parties, because, if it turns up at all, it just eats roots and leaves.<br /><br />The joke's about shagging, Lynne.<br /><br />********<br />POSTSCRIPT<br />1 September 2008: After more than four years, I am finally out of my misery: a correspondent, C. Elder, has kindly explained why \\"one's\\" should indeed take an apostrophe: Mr(s). Elder writes:<br /><br />\\"It is only personal possessive pronouns (mine, his, her, our, etc) that do not take apostrophes. \\"One\\" is an indefinite pronoun, so using it in the possessive sense ... it takes an apostrophe, and hence why we ought not torture Ms Woolf in her grave.\\"<br /><br />So there you have it.<br /><br />Olly Buxtoner writes:    \\"It is only personal possessive pronouns (mine, his, her, our, etc) that do not take apostrophes. \\"One\\" is an indefinite pronoun, so using it in the possessive sense ... it takes an apostrophe, and hence why we ought not torture Ms Woolf in her grave.\\"     So there you have it.

B00004Z4WQ|4.0|Honestly, I wanted nothing to do with this film coz I can't stand the films it was spoofing.  It's basically doing for &quot;Scream&quot; era slashers(one of the worse subgenres is cinematic history) what &quot;Student Bodies&quot; did for heyday slasher flicks(I suggest seeing that film as well).  I did watch it though coz I was impressed with the way the Wayans brothers spoofed &quot;in the hood&quot; films, and I thought they just might be able to pull it off.  Well,  I found this movie funny-in fact, very funny!  Funnier than I was expecting.  The jokes are all hit and miss like a Zucker Brothers film, but the good ones are very good.  Believe it or not, it actually takes some intelligence to come up with such stupid jokes.  There are certainly those who hate it for it's crudeness, but what do you expect when you're dealing with the Wayans brothers?  I admire the fact that they don't wimp out and go the PG-13 route.  My hat goes off to the Wayans brothers-if they continue to make them, I'll continue to watch.
1592400876|2.0|This work is a terrible disappointment. The text does not live up to the delightful title.<br />First. The punctuation rules are for the UK and differ significantly from what is considered correct USA punctuation. Sadly, most readers will be ignorant of the distinction and spread such errors as placing periods and commas after closing quote marks (more-or-less the British system).<br />The author was given a witty title, but counterbalances that with dull prose. She often contradicts herself by not following her own rules. She claims that the erudite New Yorker magazine adds an apostrophe to number plurals (1990's and not the correct 1990s). The actual perpetrator of this error is The New York Times.<br />Enough said.
B00003CY0V|5.0|I saw this movie the sunday before Sept 11 2001, and if you remember the arguments it's really interesting, probably this movie would be a blockbuster if it was released after that incident or with good marketing (remember \\"wag the dog\\" in the Clinton sex scandal). Just remember that more billionaries got richer after 9/11 than ever in the history of the US, not one important company was present in the two towers when the planes crashed (so that means that only in the twin towers the people got to work after 10am!! give me a break!), etc. So if you are a believer of all the CNN scenario of the 9/11 incident don't watch this movie 'cause your going to laugh, but.. if you think that the truth is yet to be relased WATCH THIS MOVIE.
B000021Y77|5.0|Another of my favorite movies, Run Lola Run (or, &quot;Lola Rennt&quot; in German) has all the right stuff: amazing (and real) sets, a throbbing techno soundtrack, an extremely interwoven and complex story line, and the death of the title character within the first thirty minutes! To me, this movie is fine example of quantum causality -- asking the eternal question, &quot;What if?&quot; Another plus? Barbara Streisand is nowhere to be found! An instant classic, I would recommend it to anyone.

0385510438|3.0|The Last Juror.  John Grisham.  United States, March 2004.  355<br />The last Juror is John Grisham's fisrt book since A Time to Kill to be set in Ford County, Mississippi.  Like all other John Grisham novels, it it a courtroom suspense thriller that catches you in at the very beginning with a crime.  Unlike other John Grisham Books, most of it takes place outside the courtroom and  offices of lawyers.  It is written in first person by a newspaper owner and reporter for the small county.  This book deals with issues such as segregation and the Vietnam War.  This book is set up to read like the diary and life of Willie Traynor in a small southern county.  <br />The book starts out with the brutal rape and murder of Rhoda Kasselaw,a young widow looking for companionship.  Her last words before she died in her neighbor's arms were &quot;Danny Padgit.  It was Danny Padgit.&quot;  Danny Padgit belonged to a corrupt family who payed off the police and judicial system in order to be overlooked as they grew and sold marijuana extensively.  Willie Taylor and his newly  bought newspaper company are very excited to be dealing with such sensational news in quiet old Ford County.  It is just what Willie needs in order to get the almost bankrupt newspaper going again.  The court case and the story of Willie's life and the community are what the rest of the book deals with.  <br />This book is filled with southern history in the seventies.  Some of the points the author talks about are the influence of the Vietnam war, the corrupt nature of the judicial branch (which may not be just history), Black and white segregation and the desegregation movement, and when the President granted amnisty to draft dodgers, He talks about how these things affected the county that Willie lived in.  After hanging out for with some Vietnam vets, Willie comments, &quot;No wonder we lost the war-everybody was stoned.&quot;  <br />Strangely, this book overwhelmingly has the theme of death which is not ahabit for John Grisham.  I'm not sure what the author's point in this would be. Maybe it would be, people die and you have to learn how to deal with it.<br />He might be trying to show us some history that we can learn from - for example, when talking about the Vietnam War.  In the book, Willie writes &quot;What the hell are we doing in Vietnam? ... Our failure has been even grander than that of the French, and we're not finished yet.&quot;  This shows that the author definately thinks that we made mistakes in that war and that we should learn from them.<br />Maybe he is tring to show us that with all our fear of people who are different or mean, we lose sight of who's really dangerous; ourselves.  When talkimg about the impact of black athletes in football after the desegregation, Willie says &quot;But those white folks sho had been so adamantly opposed to accepting black students were suddenly transformed that Friday night.&quot;  This shows that the author thinks that white people were making a bigger deal out of the segregation than need be.  There was nothing to be afraid of.<br />These are just a few of my speculations.  You can make your own when you finish reading the book.  This book was very educational and interesting, but there was not much happening in the middle of the book.  There was a big lull  of just ordinary life and talk.  Although this may be true about how life really is, you shouldn't write a book like that.  If you are a patient reader and can get through the middle part, the book turns out to be very interesting, exciting, and educational.

But in retrospective,  they're other alubms blew me away in a way nevermind couldn't it great, but it's so commercial and so clean, i love the raw under ground sounds of the otehr albums more incesticide being my favorite. But this all still doesn't stop it from being one kick as break through record i mean everyone  has heard smells like teen spirit the song that in some ways saved rock music, and other ways killed it by letting punk expose itself and commercialize, so many contradictions, oh well. but my person favorite on this album is territorial pissings. Other high light songs are, drain you, in bloom, lounge act and stay away. The softer something in the way and polly are great, and the secret jam noise track endless nameless, kind hard to wait for but is very interesting and shows a weird bland and again interesting side to nirvanas music the stuff that i particularly enjoy, but if you enjoy endless nameless and territorial pissings and like them more than smells liek teen spirit then  check out the other albums you would definetly like them. live on kurt through the music
0802130208|5.0|Where to start?!  I've read thousands of books in my lifetime and have never enjoyed a book more.  This book is, indeed, a comic masterpiece as several other reviewers mentioned.  I should get a commission from Amazon because I've recommended it to so many of my friends. I can't remember when I laughed so much (or so hard) reading a book.  I was in the bathtub reading one night and my husband thought I had gone bonkers because he kept hearing me laughing out loud.  I was reading the part where Ignatius came back from yet another day of hot dog vending with no receipts and had to explain about trying to put the stray cat in the bun compartment of his cart.  You just have to read it for yourself to get the full flavor of the scene.<br />Ignatius's mother is a literary marvel and their conversations and interactions are out of this world funny.  His many comments about her hiding her wine in the oven were hilarious.<br />I fell in love with Jones (Whoa! LOL!), the unfortunate black man who was in the wrong place at the wrong time and ends up working for minimal wage for a 'ho in the French Quarter.  Jones almost steals the book from Ignatius....<br />Mr. Toole captured the flavor and essence of New Orleans like no other author I've ever read.  It's a tragedy that he didn't live to see the success of this wonderful novel.<br />If you need a good laugh, or just cheering up, then read this book.  It shook me right out of my Winter doldrums and put me back on my reading path to enlightenment...
B0000AUHOH|3.0|Is this movie flawed? Oh yes. But this has more character and feels like more, genuine Trek than anything Berman and his bunch have put out in years. It really is a startling night and day difference to go back and watch some of these older Trek films and really just see how far Star Trek has declined since in quality. Very sad. Star Trek IV is even the more outstanding example of a night and day contrast. What happened to that? What happened to Star Trek? Why was it allowed to go down so low in the past...almost decade or so? <br />These Special Edition DVD's are must owns for Trekkers, especially the classic films.  <BR>You'll enjoy this one for nostalgia and completist's sake, if nothing else.
B0001HAHXW|3.0|Im sorry Eric, I love your work, but these renditions lack the raw edgyness that robert imparted in his music. It is too cruisy... played to &quot;safe&quot;. Step out... show us what you got!! And didnt peter green do the same thing with hot foot powder a few years ago? Similar cruisy treatment from him as well. Like another reviewer wrote... people like john hammond really catch what robert was about. &quot;Cradle&quot; had balls... I wish you gave this the same. Still... its a good listen....
0393057658|5.0|Without a doubt one of the best books I've read in a long time. Michael Lewis has a tremendous gift for explaining complicated financial issues simply, elegantly, and succinctly. He is also a conceptual thinker of a high order, which is why his books seem more revolutionary than they are: he just explains things better and more provocatively than anyone else. <br />Moneyball is no exception. Drawing upon the work of a generation of new-age baseball statisticians, Michael Lewis chronicles the uncanny success of general manager Billy Beane and his budget-strapped Oakland A's. In a story that reads far more breazily and interestingly than you might think, Lewis explains how Beane used complex statistical analysis to revamp his organization and catapult the A's to the top of the American League. Beane's success demonstrates convincingly that &quot;conventional baseball wisdom&quot; is an oxymoron. That is, the stuff that really matters in terms of winning baseball games is not the stuff that baseball insiders have been focusing upon for the last hundred-plus years. Beane employs the cold calculation of a Wall Street maverick to the poetic, metaphoric, and staid world of baseball. And in the process, not surprisingly, he offends a helluva lot of baseball sensibilties. (You need only read some of the crappy reviews on this website to see that). But the fact remains that Beane is right, and the future of baseball is Beane &amp; Co. No doubt Lewis' bestselling book will usher in that future far sooner than might have been the case-- which is precisely why Michael Lewis will go down as one of the most important and influential writers of this generation. He is Tom Wolfe and Warren Buffett wrapped into one, and his book is a true joy to read.
B00003CX8V|5.0|I'm not going to rain on anybody's parade. This is a terrific movie, and lots of other reviewers have already ticked off all of the things that make it terrific. It's smart and sophisticated, with plenty of witty dialogue. Although some of the details are dated, such as the interminable rows of pencil pushers at desks with adding machines, the underlying office politics are just as real and just as nasty today as ever. The acting is great. Not only are Lemmon and MacLaine wonderful together, the rest of the cast is also excellent.<br />The only thing I have to add is that, despite clever lines, funny scenes and an acceptably happy ending, THE APARTMENT is as much a drama as it is a comedy. The seamy undercurrent of office politics and the way people ruthlessly use each in their personal relationships gives this little tale a grim, almost vicious, feel at times. Much of what you see in THE APARTMENT is not the least bit funny.<br />Not to be repetitive, but this is an outstanding movie. If you haven't seen it, you should. It's not really a family movie, though. True to the period in which it was made, there's no overt sexual content, but there are definitely adult themes and kids probably wouldn't fully \\"get\\" what's going on, anyway. Be that as it may, THE APARTMENT would be a great addition to almost any classic movie collection.
B000089RVX|1.0|The only reason anyone likes this band is because they have a female vocalist who sings well. Subtract her from the equation, and they sound EXACTLY like every other lame metal band trying to revive the sound of the mid-eighties. Seriously, you can hear this crap being played in hundreds of garages in Jersey by high school students.
0767803434|1.0|What kind of plot is this? They land the plane and then take back off when they're not even on the runway. I'm sorry this is just a little too impossible for me. Six Russian terrorists just happen to get on  Air Force One unnoticed, please. One of the president's, most trusted and highly scrutinized, secret service detail is a traitor. <br />There's nothing wrong with a fictional account, but at least make it one we can half-heartedly believe. <br />What were you thinking Harrison? This was a &quot;B&quot; movie plot at best!
B00006CXSS|5.0|Reading through a few of the previous reviews, I have to wonder if we were watching the same film.  This is the antithesis of the &quot;glorifacation of war&quot;.  Boys in the prime of their lives die for no other reason than they took their helmet off to scratch their head.  This is one of the most accurate representations of the insanity of modern warfare outside of Das Boot.  Interestingly enough, Band of Brothers takes the opposite track that Das Boot took.  The one failing of this movie is at displaying the tedium that accompanied the terror of battle.  While I say this is a &quot;failing&quot;, it's not really.  I don't see how showing the tedium would add anything to this movie, it would simply distract people from the specatcle unfolding infront of them.  World War II was a horrific experiance.  The men who fought and died in the fields of Europe or the jungles of Asia faced a task that we cannot even fathom in 2004.  To say this movie glorifies war is to say that Schindlers List was a heroic propaganda piece for the Jews, it shows that same level of ignorance.  This war was forced upon these young men, and Band of Brothers is a wonderful depiction of how they overcame it.  While I do not envy these men, I have more respect for them than words can express, and this film is a fitting tribute to the sacrifice they made for freedom and sanity in this world.  It also serves as a lesson as to just how much war is to be avoided, but knowing that War has been historically unavoidable, it makes me feel better to know that men like those that populated Easy Company would be fighting for me.
0380789035|3.0|This is a pure 5-star book on originality.  But its delivery gets bogged down about halfway through and never fully recovers.  The book has a very native American feel as old gods and beliefs take form to oppose the new ways, mainly technology.  The main character, Shadow, is very well done and is the perfect &quot;anti&quot; hero without drawing on pity.  I very much enjoyed Gaiman's character of Shadow.  It's one of the highlights of the book.<br />To me, the book hits a snow drift mid-way through after spending some time in the small Wisconsin town of Lakeside.  I had a very strong impression the author was trying to figure out where he wanted the story to go, and there seemed to be quite a bit of wandering or observations without any meaningful connection.  Sometimes, if you just keep walking, you'll eventually find the path.  Well, he did find the path.  Kinda.<br />The ending was okay, but not the experience I was geared up for after reading the first half.  It almost had a &quot;Scooby-doo&quot; feel to it (&quot;...and if wasn't for you meddling kids...&quot;).<br />I don't mean to be unfair, and no doubt someone will hammer me on my lack of insight, but its my opinion that 'American Gods' is a good book that could've been great.
B000002C1V|5.0|So this isn't Floyd's best, and isn't experimental.  The songs bare no resistance to dark side of the moon.  It seems, to me, like Roger was a little influenced by Lennon's death three years earlier.  The resemblence is striking on tracks like the gunner's dream (listen to imagine), and like John's music, this is strikingly honest, political and personal.  Weither or not John's death contributed to these things is your own call, I think it did, in part.<br />This stands as one of the harshest political statements in ages, in fact it reminds me of how Dante used the inferno to condemn political figures to hell.  The statement in Fletcher Memorial is similiarly strong, exposing leaders as being &quot;overgrown infants.&quot;<br />The song &quot;Two Suns in the Sunset&quot; almost brings me to tears when I hear, &quot;and you'll never hear their voices&quot; &quot;Daddy!  Daddy!&quot;.  So powerful.<br />I simply love the sick sarcastic setting for &quot;get your filthy hands off my desert.&quot;  It illustrates the level in which those in power are detached from those without.  The totally ironic strings come in with lame pompus music, its almost comical.<br />Possible Pasts show cases the way in which what could have been haunts us.  In fact, like butterflies, they play around just out of reach.<br />In the song &quot;not now John&quot; I am trying to figure out if John is lennon.  Although the first time i heard it i dennounce the possiblity, I am now not sure.  It talks about how we are putting art, the environment, and indeed our own education behind the needs of the state to be powerful.  Either it is that John Lennon is being used as a symbol for artists and works of Art, or John means a common person, like Joe and they are telling John not to indulge in art.  If anybody knows, they arent' telling me.<br />All in all a very theatrical release and I love it.
B00007LTIA|5.0|Tales From Topographic Oceans is simply a fantastic album.  It's musical landscape is utterly amazing.  The playing is amazing.  Anderson's singing is fantastic.  The lyrics are spiritual and inspirational.  This album is endlessly enjoyable.<br />I say these simple things because people want to put labels on this album.  People who love it will say you are not smart enough if you don't like it.  People who hate it will say you are an overly intellectual loser if you like it.  Both extremes are silly.  If one is not into the length and complexity of this album, fine.  These people should stick with 4 minute pop songs.  And whoever loves this album should be at peace with those that can't get into it.<br />I find TFTO, as with most of Yes' material, to be amazingly refreshing in this modern era of pop bimbos, dumb boy-bands, angry rappers, knuckle-dragging rap-metal bands, and general corporate crap.  This album was made for pure musical excellence and enjoyment, not to follow some dumb trend or look cool or be a marketer's wet dream.<br />I think that anyone with a pure love of music, and anyone who is adventurous and open-minded, should listen to this album.  The rewards are immense.
0671027387|4.0|On the spine of my hardcover copy of this novel the name of author Dan Brown is much larger than the title, \\"Deception Point.\\"  This makes sense, not only because Brown's most recent novel, \\"The Da Vinci Code,\\" has been atop the best seller list for about as far back as anybody can remember (i.e., back to \\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\"), but also because the title of this 2001 novel really is too broad of a hint as to what is going on.  It is hard to look at the words \\"Deception Point\\" and not to be wary of everything that is happening in the novel.<br /><br />Before we get to the novel we are confronted with an Author's Note that the Delta Force, the National Reconnaissance Office, and the Space Frontier Foundation are real organizations, and that all technologies described in the novel exist.  If at this point you think you are entering Tom Clancy techno-thriller territory, you are indeed reading the signs correctly.  We are then have a quotation from President Bill Clinton from a press conference on August 7, 1997 following a discovery known as ALH84001, which anyone who either saw the clip on the evening news or, more likely, caught it in the film \\"Contact.\\"  There is then a prologue with a puzzling act of violence and then we are introduced to the central character of the novel.<br /><br />Rachel Sexton is the daughter of Senator Sedgewick Sexton, the presumptive nominee of the Republican party for the upcoming election against the incumbent President Zachary Herney.  Because she works for the NRO, Rachel technically works for the President, and her father wants her to quit and come work for him.  However, she has been estranged from her father since the death of her mother a few years earlier, and although she has never met the President that is about to change as she becomes an unwilling pawn in a dirty game of power politics that is being played for all the marbles (and then some).  At the heart of this is a discovery made by NASA of such scientific importance and earth-shattering significance that it validates every one of the billions of dollars spent in space.<br /><br />The problem is that Brown strings out both Rachel and his readers as to what the discovery was way too long.  After a while I made a bet with myself that it we were not going to find out until after page 100 what the big secret was (wow, am I good).  This was just one of several rather annoying literary tactics employed by Brown in this novel.  I read \\"Deception Point\\" after having read both \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" and \\"Angels & Demons,\\" so one thing I can say is that Brown has improved as a writer.  His propensity for ominous foreshadowing in the final line of a chapter has been greatly reduced since he wrote this novel.  He has also been learned to do a much better job of being coy about the revelation of the mystery character (the misdirection in this book at the end is quite ineffectual).<br /><br />On the one hand Brown does have several strong and compelling women characters in \\"Deception Point,\\" but on the other he could not see American presidential politics in more black and white terms, despite the attempts to provide shades of gray.  However, what Brown does in this novel that will probably frustrate you the most is his almost pathological insistence on switching scenes from one chapter to the next.  When you finish one chapter and the next one actually continues the action you want to stop and check to make sure you did not somehow skip one.  No wonder it is difficult to put the book down; you have to keep going through these other chapters to get to the end of the scene that has caught your interest.  Then there is the final chapter, when Brown comes up with a rather cute little scene that earns a smile, but really goes against the rest of the book, especially given the wringer the characters have been put through by that point (not to mention their personal backgrounds).<br /><br />The strength of the novel is what we have seen from Brown in his most recent and most successful books, which is smart people have discussions about topics that are way over our heads at warp speed.  One advantage about \\"Deception Point\\" is that since the topics are meteorites and plankton rather than great works of art and architectural landmarks, there is no compelling need to go track down actual photographs of these things.  The down side is that science is not as interesting as art, so even with the big brains watering things down so that Rachel and other neophytes such as myself and other readers I am still really just playing along rather than really understanding what is happening.  You know, the basic \\"I'll take your word for it\\" position which is standard fare with such books, whether written by Dan Brown or Michael Crichton.<br /><br />What we have here is a summer beach book in that it is face paced and there are games within each plot so there is nary a dull moment, just a sense of being played with by the author.  Fortunately, whether this is your first Dan Brown book or your fourth, either way you know that \\"Deception Point\\" is not his best work, so it is hard to be too disappointed in it given what else he has out there.  However, it does raise the ante on what he comes up with next, but it is not like that is anything Brown does not already know.hich is smart people have discussions about topics that are way over our heads at warp speed.

0698119347|4.0|I thought this book was really great, and iknow a lot of people who also enjoyed it.  I had never heard of Anthony Horowitz until I read this book.  After I read Stormbreaker I read the othe Alex Rider adventure series books, and really enjoyed them all.  They are related to the Lord of the Rings, because it seems like each book Anthony Horowitz writes gets better and better.  If you like sort of, \\"James Bond\\" style books you will really enjoy Stormbreaker and all of the other Horowitz books.<BR>These books are great for kids and adults of all ages.
1561007919|3.0|This is the second book in Childs Reacher series.  It's a fabulous series with a hunky larger than life character who is humble, confident, fearless, always out-thinks the bad guys, and really knows how to kill. Jack Reacher lives life only in the present in a way that's a cross between hobo and Zen wanderer -- no possessions, no lasting relationships, no home, no luggage.<br /><br />I started the series with Childs' 2 Reacher books written in the first person -- Persuader,the last, and The Killing Floor, the first. I think they're better for their first-person POV and Childs' dexterity with the character of Reacher.<br /><br />In Die Trying, I loved the hypnotic psychotic snake-charmer like character of the villain Beau Borken, and Holly Johnson is one of Childs' stronger more resourceful female characters.  The description of Reacher's journey through the mine shaft is some excellent listening. Dick Hill does an incredible job as reader for all the Reacher books. Recently, I read an excerpt from Enemy, the upcoming Reacher book and was truly surprised at how terse Childs' dialogue is.  I highly recommend the audiobook format.<br /><br />I hate Reacher's bad hygiene, worse than ever in Die Trying, and find it unbelievable Holly would touch him for the smell. I mean this is an active man oozing with testoreone, adrenaline, and sweat, not to mention contact with mounds of corpses and crawling through rats in a mine shaft! Couldn't he take just one shower in a 5-day period?  Thankfully in later books Childs gets Reacher to water more frequently and gives him a toothbrush. Also those extra long descriptions of a bullet's trajectory -- filler!<br /><br />I did have to suspend belief on a few things. A huge dynamite explosion on the road that did not damage the highway?<br /><br />But this is fiction, and this is a fabulously enjoyable series to listen to.  Can't wait for Enemy to be published, the first Reacher book I will read rather than listen to.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|This is the movie that started it all. Without this, Hayao Miyazaki wouldn't be where he is today. There would be no \\"Princess Mononoke\\" or \\"Sprited Away\\".<BR>(ok , maybe that's wrong. But wouldn't be as big as they are)<BR>  \\"Nausicaa\\" has all the ingredients a Miyazaki movie needs. Beautiful pictures, rich human characters, complex but highly relatable and understandable themes, amazing imaginations made into reality (almost.. But you likely will forget that you are watching a \\"CARTOON\\") , great music by legendary Joe Hisaishi, and above all this, the flying sequences!  There's no good or bad in this story. There are people just like us trying to survive on the edge of collapse. Even though it takes place in distant future (2000 years later), you can see the same is happening in today's world.<BR>  This was made 20 years ago, so that the graphics maybe a little primitive compareing to his later work. But I know you will be totally sucked into it once the openning credits starts. ( Be aware of the openning theme tune, too. It's hauntingly beautiful )<BR>  Mr. Miyazaki reportedly isn't as fond of this movie as his fans are, because of the religious imagery in the end. But If you liked his other work, This movie is a MUST SEE!  I'm very happy that It's finally going to be released in the states, and the rest of the world (I assume?), because this movie carries a very important message, especially since the state of the world now is more alarming than ever. Also because I get to see it again! <BR>  <BR> Thank you Disney.  Can't wait 'til August.  But I wish this would be released in the theatres.

B0001ENY6M|3.0|OK, I didn't like this heavy-handed, one-dimensional, money-maker of a movie. However, I have to give credit where credit is due.  This is an exellent score that can not be as easily dismissed as the film that it supports.  Magnificently recorded and very well composed, this is a real piece of work.  Some of these other reviewers seem a little confused.  This score is definitely not the sound of 2000 years ago.  I say this with confindence as I know how the composer generated these sounds, and trust me oh simple sheep, the instruments didn't exist even 10 years ago let alone 1000.  Buy this score if it caught your attention from seeing the movie (as it did mine), but buy a used cut-out so as pope mel doesn't profit.
0790742780|4.0|\\"Falling Down\\" is a sly combination of a social commentary, a conventional action movie, and a sad character study. It's an odd and sometimes unsettling mix - sometimes the horror of what we're watching is undermined by the catchphrase-laden dialogue of our anti-hero - but it's a compelling, reasonably gutsy movie that raises a lot of questions.<br />Michael Douglas, mostly known as D-FENS, has snapped. He leaves his car on a blistering day in LA and goes for a walk, only to face a series of annoyances that Larry David woulda loved - irritating convenience-store policies, fast-food fascism, gang-bangers, even a neo-nazi. Instead of cracking wise, however, D-FENS responds with violence and vandalism.<br />Meanwhile, back at the LAPD, Robert Duvall is a low-impact cop on his last day of the job. He's not well-liked, even though he seems to be a perfectly nice guy. He starts tracking these strange reports of a white nerd on a rampage, and ultimately gets involved with the case.<br />The movie seems designed to generate controversy, with its casual xenophobia and the sometimes pandering actions of the Michael Douglas character. Look deeper, though, and you'll note that Duvall's cop is basically a well-adjusted version of D-FENS. Both men feel utterly insignificant, only Duvall has learned how to laugh and get through life, while Douglas is bewildered and disillusioned - and deeply sad.<br />Things get even more confused when we learn Douglas has shown violence toward his family in the past, and may have a sinister goal in mind. This is probably unsettling to those who have been cheering him on, but who can blame them? Douglas is given pithy dialogue and exit lines for each of his encounters, as if we're supposed to applaud when he destroys, say, a Korean man's business. If Schumacher had downplayed the mayhem, or showed the violence as the actions of a desperate, sadly warped man (instead of a spokesman for the overlooked white man), the movie would have more power. Butwould anyone want to see it? The movie's ambivalence about the actions of D-FENS is fascinating and refreshingly non-judgmental. <br />\\"Falling Down\\" is just as haunting for its flaws as its virtues. If it's meant to be a commentary, it undercuts itself with its action sequences. As an action drama, however, it's pretty deep and fearless in presenting men of quiet desperation - and two different methods for conquering it.
B0001ENYKS|3.0|I bought this album about two weeks ago after seeing the video for take me out on a public music station (not something I normally do, but I've been looking for new stuff lately. The first few days of listening to them I thought that it was ridiculously catchy music, and all was good. But after a few more days it just sort of got repetive (and I hadn't even been listening to it nonestop during those days. Mostly I think the fault lies with the drummer, who never really does anything new or different from any of the songs before. Overall the album could stand to be a lot more varied. I would hesitate heavily to call these guys the saviors of rock and roll, or to compare them to any of the greats of the past (but that's partly because I hate to compare bands) but there are some very good tracks on here, and I might consider buying there next album if they change up a few more things.
B000001OAA|5.0|Unlike the more recent <i>Beautiful Garbage</i> (also fun), this album is all about the rock, and I like rock. The first song I heard was \\"Queer\\" -- actually saw the video one night while baby-sitting, of all things -- and the power behind Manson's voice combined with the \\"pretty\\" rock music pretty much sold me. \\"Queer\\" is still one of my favorite songs off this album, but you can't forget the sacrilige \\"Vow\\" (don't get huffy, that's not why I like it) or the trampy \\"Supervixen.\\" A great album to sing along to when you're pissed off.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|The last time, at least that I'm aware of, that Bill Murray tried serious acting was in &quot;The Razor's Edge.&quot; I thought it was a good film, but he was excoriated by most critics and fans thinking they were coming to see a standard Bill Murray vehicle. Fortunately, this time around he has received richly deserved accolades for his performance.<br />\\"Lost in Translation\\" essentially follows Bob Harris (Murray) and Charlotte  (Scarlett Johansson), as they both find themselves lost and adrift in Japan. Bob is a fading action star, who apparently is past his heyday and takes a job promoting a Japanese liquor for $2 million. Little hints along the way indicate he probably could use the money. It appears he has been appearing in plays and probably making decent but not necessarily great money. His wife is on a remodeling binge, which seems to hint at the fact that the big paycheck is something she has looked forward to. But Bob is more troubled by his life in general than by financial matters. He feels disconnected from his wife and children and can't seem to find a way to re-connect with them. He's in the midst of a midlife crisis and has no idea what to do about except withdraw into himself.<br />Charlotte is in somewhat similar straits. She is questioning her two-year marriage to a photographer who has brought her along to Japan for a shoot but he is gone much of the time. She feels no connection to her husband and, worse, doesn't know what she is supposed to do with her life.<br />Bob and she eventually meet and become friends. soul mates in fact, and writer/director Sophia Coppola wisely avoids what nearly any other writer and director would have done with the relationship-throw them in bed together. Instead the two develop a far more intimate relationship as they wander Tokyo and face an impending separation when Bob must return to America.<br />This is very much a thinking person's film. There's no real action (well, at one point they are chased out of a barby a bartender toting some kind of weird gun) but you remain engrossed. The two leads give incredibly nuanced performances. Murray in particular is brilliant in his restraint, as on more than a few occasions he has the opportunity to revert to his standard goofy/funny guy act and doesn't. <br />This is one of the best films I have seen in the past year. I realize its not for everyone, some will consider it too slow or lacking in plot development, but they obviously will have missed the fact that sometimes a film can just be about how lost we feel in life.
0446677450|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book because it is kind of like a fairy tale. Kiyosaki tells stories about how easy it was for him to make money, and if the reader follows his simple rules then we will become as rich as he. I liked this book because I did not struggle to get through it, although there were some unrealistic parts which were not so easy to read. The author is extremely repetitive throughout the book, and I don't know whether it was intentional, so as to engrave ideas into the reader's mind, or just lack of anything better to say. I recommend reading this book if you have money and a job. Considering I have neither this book was not very helpful to me. I believe this book could be beneficial to some, and I guess Kiyosaki's motivation for writing this book was just to share with the world how he got rich.
B0001HAHXW|2.0|Pick this cd up if you are into elevator music versions of songs you like. These versions a safely played well inside the lines to the point of a bored stupor. It's paint by the numbers blues, which is you are a clapton fan you may like, otherwise, if you like the older recordings of these numbers your head will be in a musically better place if you don't partake in this.
0345452577|2.0|In the past I have found Jonathan Kellerman to be my favorite author, having read every book he has ever written.  Conspiracy Club, however, does not live up to his previous works.  The plot was weak, the characters even weaker.  I found myself bored and thrilled when it ended.  Mr. Kellerman, please go back to your previous style, this was simply not worth reading.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|If you're reading this review, you are obviously thinking about buying the Firefly DVD. You need to take a chance and just do it. I don't think you'll be disappointed. This was a great show that wasn't given a chance by FOX. This is the first thing I've ever bought that I've been compelled to write a review for. Once you watch the complete series you'll know why.
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|Under Control is one of the best soul songs written in the past 5 years.  It makes this album killer.
B00018D44U|4.0|Let's face it: Norah Jones is going to be great doing whatever she chooses.  Her Grammy winning debut, Come Away With Me, is nothing short of spectacular.  In my opinion, Feels Like Home is just as great, it's just different.  While Come Away With Me is known for its jazz undertones, Feels Like Home possesses a light country twang that is charming and relaxing all at once.  Like her first CD, Norah's vioce is front and center, and the subtle tinkling of her piano and the quiet strums of a guitar just add to the appeal of her airy, sweet, all together cozy voice.  If people are giving Feels Like Home such low reviews because they're comparing it to Come Away With Me, then they are comparing apples and oranges.  While they are both different, they are both excellent and satisfying CDs.  Give it a try.  The feel is inviting and warm, and does nothing but please and relax the listener.
B00004Z459|5.0|1. Papercut (8/10) --&gt; Great opening song.  It gets you ready for some of the better songs that are coming ahead.<br />2. One Step Closer (10/10) --&gt; Every person out there gets angry at some point in time and this song fits any of those moments perfectly.<br /><br />3. With You (8/10) --&gt; Not sure of the meaning of this song, but it's rather good.<br />4. Points Of Authority (9/10) --&gt; This seems to be more of a rap song than a rock song, but still it is an awesome addition to the record.<br /><br />5. Crawling (9/10) --&gt; Very good song.  Just listen to the words a couple of times if you can't figure out what it means.<br /><br />6. Runaway (9/10) --&gt; Great song about getting away from the pain and the lies.<br /><br />7. By Myself (9/10) --&gt; This song is very good for alot of teens and anybody else who ever feels that life is hard but they can do it on their own.<br />8. In the End (9/10) --&gt; Very depressing but great song.<br /><br />9. A Place for My Head (10/10) --&gt; This is my favorite song on the entire record.  Its got great lyrics, awesome guitar and bass, and you can play anytime you are feeling down.<br />10. Forgotten (8/10) --&gt; Excellent song, lyrics are very good along with some great guitar segments :)<br />11. Cure for the Itch (1/10) --&gt; No offense to Joe Hahn (the DJ for LP), but this song really just doesn't fit on this cd.  It's all turn-tables and digital effects.  All the other songs are rock.<br /><br />12. Pushing Me Away (9/10) --&gt; Very good ending song... Not much more to say about it.
B0001LJCPC|5.0|KIll Bill volume 1's soundtrack was one of the best I have ever heard and if it is possible this album blows it out of the water. Quentin Tarantino is the master of Movie soundtracks. This is a must have for fans of his work and for music lovers alike.
B0001LJCMK|3.0|I havent listen to the studio CD yet, but just saw them live and have downloaded some songs here and there, so I'll base my review on that. This is really a tongue in cheek, fun band. The songs are real catchy, in the garage-rock vein. I would recommend seeing them live, if you have the chance. I saw them in NYC last week and had a blast. This is real basic garage rock that is just plain fun. The guitarist from Millionare had a great stage presence and made the live show really fun. Highly recommend checking them out if they come to your town. My fav song so far is Speaking Tongues. The were on Conan O'Brien recently and played this song.
B0000TLA9G|3.0|There is some noise in the beginning of Sweet Child O' Mine. Don't know if my CD is faulty...
B000001DQI|5.0|In my opinion this is the best John/Taupin collaboration. At what is still the most prolific period for the two of them, it seemed they couldn't record the music fast enough.<br />The result of this was the Goodbye Yellow Brick Road album, which encompasses a broad range of material that is very strong from beginning to end.<br />Many people overlook some of the lesser known tracks which didn't get a lot of radio play that are some of the best material Elton John has ever recorded, and are what make this release so good.<br />A must have recording for the Elton John fan!
0783225849|5.0|I just heard about an exhibition called, \\"24 hour Psycho\\" where the Hitchcock film is shown at such a slow rate that it runs for 24 hours.  But what is at work in Psycho beyond murder and cross-dressing that makes such a concept possible?<br />Surely there is the technical brilliance that makes the film so watchable but more than that \\"Psycho\\" captures the moment we lost our innocence as citizens and were re-born as consumers.  Its an old and sad story now but there is both recognition of and longing for our simpler selves in the story of roadside madness playing out in that neglected motel bypassed by an unnamed California freeway.<br />The rap on Hitchcock has always been that he is a crowd pleaser, incapable of offending his audience.  And in \\"Psycho\\" Norman Bate is caught and incarcerated so once again Hitchcock gives us a \\"happy\\" ending.  But along the way he made us, his audience, root for the murderer.  The pivotal sequence is when Norman runs back to the motel and sees what \\"Mother\\" has done to Marion.  Norman does more than clean up the murder scene and dispose of the body.  He provides the audience, just shocked and saddened by the death of the leading lady, an opportunity to shift allegiances to him the good son who knows how to mop a bathroom floor.  The fact that we are led to believe he has done this before is no deterrent to our desire root for Norman.  So by the time Norman stands at the edge of the swamp watching the car sink into seeming oblivion, we share his anxiety when the car stops sinking and his intense relief when its starts sinking again.<br />In that sequence Hitchcock takes us from being innocent bystanders to accomplices to a shocking murder.  It is the same dynamic at work in advertising and exploited by mass media.  We are lulled into accepting Norman as a good boy because we see him clean up the bathroom.  Had we glimpsed his face while stabbing Marion Crane in the shower that wouldn't have happened.  If the makers of SUVs showed us the emissions from the exhaust pipe in the ad where SUVs climb mountain peaks, these vehicles might not be so popular.  The movies, as Hitchcock knew all too well, depend upon the willingness of the audience to suspend its disbelief.  But the audience will only do that when its given something worth the price.  And it is in that basic exchange when we shed our role as citizen for that of consumer.  Hitchcock showed his audience watching Psycho just how much of its soul it was willing to sacrifice in order to have a good time.  And more than four decades later, we are still partying.d us the emissions from the exhaust pipe in the ad where SUVs climb mountain peaks, these vehicles might not be so popular.

B000002UKS|5.0|I thought this was a great album. I have heard many of their albums but the guitars on this are splendid. In some ways after listening to Nirvana for so long I hear a bit of them in this album. Even the drumming sounds a bit the same. I could never compare the two. Kurt will be sorely missed, but Dave is still going strong.
B00006LJ79|5.0|I listen to them every time driving to work and back home, months after purchasing the album. The new single &quot;Ne Ver, Ne Boisa (Eurovision 2003)&quot; is awesome, too.<BR>These energetic beats tell feelings that teens feel: like an exile, misunderstood, longing for affection. I am many years beyond teenage, though, but I still love t.A.T.u.<BR>I have collected 3 of their CDs, including the Remix.<BR>Others of my favorite artists are: the Cure, the Smiths, the Cranberries, Bjork, and Dido.
B00005JKQZ|5.0|A beautifully filmed, well acted, touching movie.  I waited two years after its release to see it and regret that I did so.  This is one of the few perfect movies I have ever seen.  A perfect movie is one that could not, in my humble opinion, have been any better than it is.  Russell Crowe is perfectly cast.  The music score is wonderful.  The cinematography is top of the art.  The story, based on the life of a noted living mathematician, is complicated but deftly handled. When &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; won Best Picture at the Academy Awards over &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring,&quot; I was sorely disappointed.  But now that I've finally seen it, I know why it won.  And now it's on my &quot;Top Ten Movies of All Time&quot; list.  Watch it and I bet it'll be on yours too.
B000005ITX|5.0|&quot;Forever Changes&quot; is the best pop/rock album I have ever heard. What's more, I never tire of it as the songs sound fresh each time I listen. And it has no peer--it is a truly amazing work that is completely different in sound from any other rock music I've come across. Absolutely beautiful, absolutely wonderful, a fabulously trippy 1960s classic that does not sound dated. Buy this!
0312995423|3.0|Having read DVC, A&amp;D and Deception Point, which I enjoyed in the order written here, I had to try this one too.  It's a fast paced action novel, so it was an entertaining read, however, and this is a big however, the characters were bland, there was no clear protagonist and the story revolved around a lot of pretty unbelievable stuff.<br />If you can get past all that then you'll probably enjoy reading this thriller too.  Brown writes in much the same way that Crichton does, they come up with some totally unbelievable \\"could never happen\\" idea and develop it into an entertaining yarn.  Since strong story telling is far more important then raw facts and data, they are both successful in engaging the reader.<br />Perhaps of the four Brown books mentioned here, this one is the most likely to become a movie, simply because it has the least amount of wild stuff to explain, like ancient brotherhoods, secret codes, historical monuments, etc.  The computer stuff is always glossed over in the movies so this one would probably work, a giant computer used by the government is being attacked by hackers and a beautiful and very smart \\"top of her field\\" heroine must save the day.
B00018D44U|4.0|I love Norah's voice which I think has great depth despite her youth.  I thought \\"Come Away With Me\\" was fantastic due to the mix of great voice, great songs and the sulty sexy jazz undertones.  On \\"Feels Like Home\\" her voice is still excellent, the songs are OK ish, but the whole feel of the thing is too \\"Sugar and Spice\\" if you know what I mean.  I must confess to disliking Country Music in general and being put off by the whole \\"Apple Pie\\" type of thing, my urban upbringing I guess.  All in all I still liked this album a lot, but because of the genre rather than the performance it fails to measure up to \\"Come Away With Me\\".
B00005JMEW|1.0|To say that Tarrantino pays \\"loving tribute\\" to grindhouse cinema, Hong Kong action flicks and spaghetti Westerns is an incorrect statement. He doesn't pay tribute to anything, he basically RIPS OFF scenes, music, and camera shots from a score of classic movies in the above mentioned genre's.<br />It's not new, it's not refreshing and it's not original, it's simply a hack slapping together a meddley of borrowed scenes, wrapped around his own silly story. He even copied Bruce Lee's get up from Game of death, lol.<br />How can you really blame him though? These days ripping off and rehashing old movies is a common and well accepted practice in a Hollywood so painfully devoid of creativity.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|GREAT CD! All the SONGS ON THIS ALBUM ROCK. ESPECIALLY BREATHE ON ME, I GOT THAT BOOM BOOM, TOXIC, EVERYTIME, THE HOOK UP AND SHOWDOWN!
B000002BQK|5.0|Goody for all-time favorite albums. I suppose it's gonna hinder me right here, reviewing this, since I'm biased to begin with - I love Mariah. The Glitter fiasco aside (may Mystikal, Busta Rhymes, DJ Clue, and Fabolous never disgrace an album of hers again... same for Ja Rule), I've been in love with her music for most of my life. (Even her sometimes ear-grating shrills)<br />And voila! The high point of her career (at least, in my eyes) - a collection of smooth, perfect, slinky, seductive R&B all wrapped up in an enticing, confessional package.<br />Right off the bat, Honey glides in on a summery, tropical, playfully sexy set of wings, shimmering in the summer sun under flirtatious piano, and Breakdown disguises its hurting, pained lyrics under a sunny, soothing bit-o-piano and a gently-rolling beat (complete with guest raps from Krayzie Bone and Wish Bone)... and mmm, oh, the yumminess the songs provide.<br />And then comes one of Mariah's best songs, lyrically - the autobiographical Close My Eyes, with its dreamy, longing production and Mariah telling of how \\"maybe I grew up a little too soon,\\" among other things. Suffice to say, i lvoe this song.<br />Other gems include the sparkling ballad, Butterfly (more piano-heaviness for ya), the rainy, urban, sultry-night atmosphere of The Roof, the slow-chilled satiny (...) of Babydoll, and the misty, again-dreamy Fourth Of July, a sort of sequel to Daydream's own Underneath The Stars. (And, of course, the Latin-tinged ballad My All, which seems to be a personal favorite among most fans)<br />Mariah at her best.... if you don't mind the new direction she's going (hey, long as she enjoys the type of music she's making, and as long as at least one person likes it, y'know...), if you don't mind her shucking sugar-sweet penning for more confessional ventures, and if you don't mind that big, booming voice taking on an edge of sophisticated, sass-n-class (...).<br />And of course as long as you're not one of those people who think she sucks because her octave range is pretty damn big. Deal.
0743455967|5.0|In what is probably his finest work to date, King provides readers with a quick autobiography, a lesson on the tools and do's and dont's of writing, and a breathtaking account of the accident that nearly cost him his life.  This third section combines autobiography with writing class, telling an exciting story while artfully employing all of the rules for good writing along the way.  King delivers his lessons with great warmth and zero fluff.  He's got a wonderful, completely correct idea that writing is meant to be a joyous exercise, and that all the Chandlers and Shakespeares, the popular and 'gifted' writers in the world can live together in greatness, so long as they're good at what they do.  This a lesson lovingly given by a man who knows what he's doing, and knows what makes a great story.  A good read for everyone.
B0001ENY6M|1.0|I am a fan of middle eastern and world music and have not seen this film-however i do occasionally rely on reader reviews to decide whether or not ill pick up a cd. All im getting is religion crammed down my throat or intellectual meanderings countering it. please just stick to the music score. would someone without prejudice just tell me whether this cd is good or not- your faith or lack of it means nothing to me-i just want a good cd ala peter gabriels passion or any natacha atlas  cd which i both like. thanks
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Go out and buy this cd... TRUST ME you wont regret it!
B0000B3FCX|5.0|I love this CD. I am not into band politics, so here is a reveiw of the actual music you will be hearing. Not the headlines.<br />1.Flat on the Floor - (5/5) Probably one of their only songs that doesn't go soft than hard or slow than fast. Just fast, and hard.<br />2.Do This Anymore - (5/5) The opening is really strong. the rest of the song is good, also<br />3.Someday - (4/5) Overplayed. It IS a really good song, once you don't listen to it for a while.<br />4.Believe it or Not - (5/5) I like the message it is sending. Unlike the last album that was extremely autobiographical, this song does not use the word &quot;I&quot; once.<br />5.Feeling too Damn Good - (7/5) Yes, seven out of five since I love this song so damn much. Nickelback does not sing love songs, if they did this would be the closest to it. But I can also relate to how they are saying that everytime things turn around and they are happy, things go wrong. And now that everything is going good, it's like they are waiting for things to go wrong.<br />6.Because of You - (4/5) Really hard, really angry. Like their older albums, except you can make out the lyrics and they stay on one topic.<br />7.Figure You Out - (5/5) It is starting to get overplayed, but even than, the song is awesome. &quot;I like your pants around your feet&quot; is an awesome opening for a song, as well as probably their most grapic lyric ever. <br />8.Should've Listened - (5/5) I like it. Chad really shows that if he wanted to be a good singer, he can belt it out. Plus, the lyrics are good. Waking up and finding your lover has left you and taken your stuff. Tisk tisk, someone should've listened unlike their father.<br />9.Throw Yourself Away - (5/5) I like this song. The sad thing is? Girls do this all the time. The fact that they are using their music to express to tell of thigns in the media that piss them off is always a good thing<br />10.Another Hole in the Head - (2/5) This is the only song I didn't like. I mean, Nickelback always has crime songs on their CDs, and their is none on this one. So I am taking out it out on my least enjoyable song.<br />11.See You at the Show - (5/5) Oooh. I like this one also, it is my second favourite after &quot;Feeling Too Gamn Good&quot;. When I first heard it I could imagion myself on their tour bus, cruzin' around after a concert and partying all night.<br />12.Saturday Nights Alright (For Fighting) - (3/5) Meh, I am not a fan of Elton John or Kid Rock, so this was not my song<br />13.Yanking out my...-(4/5) Good, but kinda dull<br />14.Learn the Hard Way - (4.5/5) Good but not great.<br />Overall, a really great album! I especially advise &quot;Feeling Too Damn Good&quot;. Even their video (which is all over the internet) for the song is amazing.
B000066NW0|4.0|To those who don't like Avril, I respect that.  She admits shes not punk and the punk era died 20 years ago! SHE WRITES HER OWN SONGS!!  This album is a little too pop, but it's good!
B0000028RR|5.0|This the best cd i own or have ever heard.  If there is a better album out there i would like to know what it is. ArmandoDiablo@hotmail.com
0385512104|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. I went into it not quite sure what I was coming into.  The author did a great job narrating the facts of autism. I was intrigued by the characters more than the story, but still enojoyed the read.
B0001AP12G|4.0|I am a big listener of rap. From everything to Lil Jon to nod your head to, or Nas (favorite) to just be awed with lyrical talent, or Eminem for all around rapping ability, etc. As soon as I saw that Kanye West was coming out with a CD, I was exited, but a little skeptical. I still went and bought his CD. I listened to it for he first time and loved it. There was everything I personnaly needed for a good cd. There's humor, intelligence, life storys, all aroud good lyrics, and EXCELLENT BEATS!!!  With all the controversy of Tupac being better then Kanye, and us turnin our backs on Pac. I think if Pac was here, he would be proud of Kanye for this CD and, being diferent. Don't listen to the ONE person posting one stars and hatin on K. West. But back to the CD. I wouldn't change this CD except for the short, not needed, &quot;Fly Away&quot;. Everything else is lyrically, or musically needed. With guest appearances such as Jay-Z, Talib Kweli, Mos Def, Common, Freeway, Ludacris, and some others, it keeps the album diverse, all whie Kanye never really being oversized by the guests. To sum it up, its a very good CD, with something for every rap fan.
0156027321|4.0|Critics, as well as all my friends, agree: The Life of Pi is a fabulous book.  I twas recommended to me by everyone.  Coaches, teachers, and the crazy librarian at the Argonne Library.  Thus, I stole it from my sister's book shelf and was taken into the lifeboat and met Richard Parker for myself.  I learned with Pi how to teach others the Super-alpha training that comes from inner strength.<BR>The Life of Pi is about Piscine, or Pi, Patel.  He's a Hindu, a Muslim, and a Christian, all wrapped up in one package.  His father owns a zoo, and he was raised being around animals his entire life.  Pi associates life, as well as faith, with the animals.  When his family decides to move to Canada he embarks on a journey across the Pacific with his family and some various zoo animals such as a hyena, an orangutan, a zebra, and Richard Parker; a Bengal tiger.  When the boat he's on sinks, he has to learn to survive on a lifeboat with the tiger, or else he will be dinner.<BR>There were plenty of lessons to be learned from this book.  On page 5 there is the line &quot;When you've suffered a great deal in life, each additional pain is both unbearable and trifling&quot;.  This book also taught me about faith.  Pi said on page 69, &quot;I just want to love God&quot;.  Throughout this book, throughout all the hardships that Piscine endured, he never lost his faith in Jesus, Mary, Muhammed, whomever.  Not only did this book stretch the imagination, but I'm sure it inspired readers to strive for the kind of faith that Pi had; one that could surpass a 450-pound tiger.  It was funny at times, sad, but overall enjoyable.<BR>I now have joined the hundreds of people who rave about this book to anyone who would listen.  While I don't read fiction very often, this book was actually based on a real story, so the overall effect wasn't that horrid.  I learned to look out for my own Richard Parker in life, as well as to treat that Richard Parker like I'm a super-alpha animal , ready for anything.
B000002LQR|4.0|Very few bands' commercial-breakthrough album just so happens to be their BEST album as well. 'Blood Sugar Sex Magik' by the Red Hot Chili Peppers is one of these examples. 'Uplift' and 'Milk' serve as fuel for the arguement that their '80s material was their best but, realistically, they still weren't completely gelled musically; not just yet. Thanks to producer, Rick Rubin, the Chilis' were able to tighten up some more while expanding to their fullest range musically with this album, presenting an even wider collage of musical styles (mainly acoustic folk) than on previous works. With all their 80's albums recently remastered (hell, even the 'What Hits' CD sounds louder and sharper), it is beyond fair that BSSM soon be remastered as well. This is their best album! 'Under the Bridge' or no 'Under the Bridge'.
B000002GQH|5.0|I was first introduced to a few songs from this album when I purchased the Singles+ 2-disc set of the Moody Blues. Those songs were &quot;Lovely to See You&quot;, &quot;Dear Diary&quot;, and &quot;Never Comes the Day&quot;. They also happened to be some of the only songs on that compilation not to be edited. Another song I'd heard before I bought the album was &quot;Lazy Day&quot;, which I heard on the Musicchoice classic rock station on my Comcast digital cable. I will do a brief review of the songs that make this album worth purchasing rather than getting some compilation.<BR>&quot;In the Beginning&quot;-once their album is opened up with a poem by Graeme Edge just as on the next album. As usual it's used as an intro to the next song or if you will the first song<BR>&quot;Lovely to see You&quot; a rocker by Justin Hayward who normally rights romantic ballads. To be honest this song actually gets a little boring. I know it's included on at least three of there compilations and you can hear it live on A NIGT AT RED ROCKS, but there's other better songs on the album like<BR>&quot;Dear Diary&quot; by Ray Thomas. It's a very relaxing song and it also features a flute solo. You can hear him saying something towards the end of the song, but you can't really understand what it is he's saying.<BR>&quot;Send Me No Wine&quot; and &quot;To Share Our Love&quot; are two back-to-back songs by John Lodge. They are not really filler but they also don't really go anywhere except seques on to the next song. These two are also the only contributions by John. Kind of a regression since his big hit with &quot;Ride my See Saw&quot; on their previous LP &quot;In Search of the Lost Chord&quot;, but he would do much better in the next album and the ones that followed.<BR>&quot;So Dee Within You&quot; by Mike Pinder is a fun song to listen to. It happened to have been covered by the Four Tops along with another song penned by Pinder &quot;A Simple Game&quot; which was the B-Side to the aforementioned &quot;Ride My See Saw&quot; both produced by Tony Clarke. <br />Note: In the liner notes of the CD I think it's the first one to have a picture of each member with their name in a caption. I don't if DAYS OF FUTURE PASSED does because I only have it on vinyl. There is a photo of Clarke their producer with a caption to as he was considered to be the six member of the band at that time.<BR>On to the second side of the album<BR>It starts off with &quot;Never Comes the Day&quot; by Justin Hayward. It starts of slow and gets louder in the chorus. It's one of those songs of his like &quot;Tuesday Afternoon&quot; and &quot;The Other Side of Life&quot; that just repeat the same lyrics after the chorus. You can hear a live version of this song on CAUGHT LIVE +5 another CD I own. They still perform it to this day although you wont hear it on either of the last two live albums.<BR>&quot;Lazy Day&quot; is another great song by Ray. It's a good song to listen to on a Sunday afternoon. <BR>On both of the last two songs you can hear him playing the harmonica which is kind of rare.<BR>&quot;Are You Sitting Comfortably&quot; was co-written by Justin and Ray. This is one of the best songs on the album. You can also hear it live on CAUGHT LIVE. It then segues onto a poem by Greame Edge titled &quot;The Dream&quot;- not much to say I'm not good at critiqing poetry but it's a pretty damn good. <BR>Have You Heard pt.1/The Voyage/Have You Heard pt.2 is Pinder's masterpeice. It doesn't hold up very well in concert, but its an example of what you can do with the mellotron and since then keyboard and synthesizers have improved drastically.<BR>The best songs here are by Ray Thomas and Mike Pinder.
B000000OTU|5.0|by the time the mid-1980's rolled around, many felt that Aerosmith were a once-great relic of the mid 1970's.  They released four great albums between 1973-1976, but started with Draw The Line, it started turning on them.  By the mid-1980's, Aerosmith had been long past their peak and they hadn't had a hit single in years.    This all changed when they met Run DMC.<br />Being smart and knowing when to strike when the iron is hot, Aerosmith came back with Permanent Vacation in 1987 on Geffen (their first Geffen album, Done With Mirrors, was extremely underrated, check it out).  Dude (Looks Like A Lady) was the first single and went to #14, becoming their biggest hit in a decade.   However, this comeback single was not a fluke, it became the first of 11 straight singles (every single one collected on here) to make the top 30 (Eat The Rich and Deuces Are Wild were both smash hits on rock radio, and Blind Man and Walk On Water were the new tracks,  Blind Man peaked in the 40's and Walk On Water barely got noticed when released in early 1995).  Aerosmith were not only hot during 1987-1994,  but they were actually hotter than they were in the 1970's!<br />Only 2 tracks (Rag Doll and Walk On Water) of the 15 recreate the gritty bluesy classic rock sound that Aerosmith perfected in the 1970's, so many fans of classic 70's Aerosmith aren't so fond of this &quot;poppier&quot; sound.  However, for many of us who grew up in the 80's and early 90's, this is the Aerosmith we knew first.<br />I hope one day that there will be a comprehensive 1973-1982 collection (instead of a ten track) of the Columbia years,  but when it comes to the Geffen years of Aerosmith, this is as good as it gets.  The 2-disc &quot;Young Lust&quot; collection includes way too much from just 4 albums that it'd be cheaper to just go and buy the 4 albums seperately.  BIG ONES is a Greatest Hits collection that delivers, every track on the album was a hit in some form or another, and there's nothing from 87-93that's missing.
0380002930|1.0|This is the worst book I have ever tried to read in my entire life. I could barely get past the first 100 pages. If you are thinking about reading it-don't. Despite critic's ranting about how great this book is suppose to be, I think if you read it, you will find your opinion to be contradictory to these statements. It should be taken off all required reading lists. It is pure torture to endure, and is a poor excuse for a piece of literature.
B0001IN0DA|5.0|Wrestlemania XX was my first WWE PPV I have ever ordered. It starts off with a great sympothy singing a patriotic song about America which was nice. It starts off with John Cena VS Big Show which was a great match.The whole event was alot more brutal then what you encounter on regular Raw or Smackdown television shows and I have been watching Raw and Smackdown for years now. The event being 5 hours was well worth the money with all the amazing fire works inside and out which mostly lit the whole city. Every match was great besides the Goldberg VS Brock Lesnar match. But since Goldberg would sue the WWE if he lost then that pretty much left Goldberg to win that one which I already knew the outcome would be. Stone Cold did nothing but watch and then get hit in the head with a beer can???. That was the only bad match of the night which lasted 10 minutes at the most. The Jackhammer of Goldbergs sucks. My sister could kick out of that heck my little rat dog could that move is just fake, fake, fake. They weren't even worn out and he Jackhammered Brock and that was it, I mean seriously 5 minutes walking around the ring then they threw eachother around trying to knock eachother down which Brock definatly won then Goldberg caught Brock off surprise and suplexed him into a fall on top Jackhammer which he lket go on not even hitting his stomach and pinned him. Those two made no effort. I will move on because I will really get going on that match which I would keep going and going. The most anticipated match the Kane VS Undertaker was great. We already knew this was a setup match because it is the Undertakers return but Kane didn't let his brother push him around much. Actually Kane really dominated that match but. Kane chokeslammed to hell The Undertaker which put him out for about 10 seconds and after that The Undertaker Tombstoned him and that was it. Kane is the only person to kick out of 2 Tombstones and he only recieved one which pinned him so you could right off tell that match was setup but extremely well done. They both came out looking strong. Their were a ton of matches that were great and very high flying. The main event was the show stealer. That match just was awsome. My favorite wrestler is Kane and I even liked the main event better then his match. It was long, fast paced, brutal, and really bone shattering some of the things they did. But Chris Benoit came out on top with the World Heavy Weight Title. All 3 did their best job at wrestling and would be worth [the money] that match alone. The new storylines revealed at Wrestlemania and the whole wrap up was fantastic. Best wrestling show I have ever seen. If your favorite wrestler lost or what still pick this up it's worth it. But skip the Goldberg VS Brock Lesnar match because, i'll stop. Hope this helped...
B00004W4UB|5.0|This is the 10th time that i just finished watching the movie! I cant help it but watching again and again!you can see that this is a passionate, romantic, horror ,gothic, psychological movie. The first time  you watch it you just undrestand whats happening at the end of it( and you feel the horror deeply! ) .But the second time you see a great story and how it was leading you at the first place but you couldnt see whats happening .  You can deeply feel Julia's pain , passion and fright. Mary Reilly (Julia Roberts ) and her Employer they both has fractures in their souls and they start to get closer to each other when they begin to know more about each other.&quot;As Mary Reilly interprets it, this is not a classic conflict between good and evil -- life isn't that simple. Hyde does not represent the distillation of pure evil, just as Jekyll is not a paragon of righteousness. Each has virtues and flaws, and only together do they represent a whole person. Hyde is raw emotion -- the animal side of humanity. His passion, twisted though it may be, gives Jekyll the will to live. Through the dichotomy presented by these two characters, we are challenged to consider that perhaps it's the combination of good and evil, control and liberation, and restraint and passion that makes each of us who we are. Mary Reilly has the power to disturb because it forces us to look inside and recognize our own Jekylls and Hydes. <BR>By using Mary as the main character, this film is also able to illustrate the transforming power of love. To be sure, Mary Reilly isn't a conventional romance, but it's a love story nevertheless. Mary loves Jekyll for his goodness, and Hyde for what she sees of herself mirrored in him. When Jekyll speaks of having a fractured soul, Mary understands his pain. Her own spirit has been crippled by her childhood torture at the hands of an abusive father (Michael Gambon). Moreover, Hyde's feelings for Mary prove to be his undoing. In the end, her gift to him is indescribably precious. <BR>Mary Reilly triumphs because of superlative character interaction. John Malkovich, who has played just about every kind of role in his varied career, brings a different slant to his Jekyll/Hyde portrayal. His Jekyll is a tragic figure of Shakespearean proportions; his Hyde is less a monster than a misanthrope. Meanwhile, opposite Malkovich, Julia Roberts graces the screen with a tender, beautifully understated performance that dwarfs anything she has previously done. Mary is both strong and vulnerable, and Roberts, looking convincingly frumpy and uncertain, creates a poignant, tormented character. Her work here is truly eye-opening. <BR>I suspect that many who see Mary Reilly will get a completely different movie than they're expecting. Instead of murder and mayhem (although both of these are evident), we are presented with a beautifully-textured motion picture tapestry that focuses on characters and themes rather than gory special effects. Mary Reilly is haunting, not only because of its foggy, shadowy settings, but because of the questions it encourages us to ask about ourselves and others.&quot;
B00005JN1L|1.0|Well, King ripped off the amazing Angel Heart this time. And Depp is no Johny Handsome with his sleep-walking non-performance in a performance worthy of an after-school-special- \\"the boy in the schzo bubble\\"?<br />Has to be the worst film of the year. Second worst of all-time-next to the Landmower Man.
0452282152|4.0|With nearly 700 reviews, there is no point in languishing in the plot, the beginning, the ending. No doubt this has been relayed over and over. But this book was so unique in itself that I couldn't bear not reviewing it!<br />At the core of this book, despite the excess of somewhat \\"cookie cutter\\" semi-main characters (the painter's aggressive friend, the jealous wife, the lusting suitor, the vicious daughter) is simply the relationship between a painter and his muse. I'm only sixteen, and so haven't read as many novels as many of the reviewers, but I can say nonetheless that the relationship between Vermeer and Griet is the most dynamic one that I've ever experienced in a book's pages. <br />Griet begins as a simple cleaner in Vermeer's studio, rearrangins and dusting his things after he's finished. Soon she advances to being his assistant, and lastly -- his muse, which ultimately destroys a part of her.<br />The sexual tension in this book is, for lack of better wording, rather remarkable. The lurid, dull and replacable sex scenes with her suitor seem to be forced, unlikely, and above all else irritating. But as Chevalier writes of the way Vermeer looks at Griet while painting her, the heat of his body when they prepare the paints, and the way his fingers trace her face when he puts in the pearl earring - it is these subtle things that make you wonder: 'What if?'<br />And when Vermeer sees Griet with her hair down, something she won't even let her own impatient suitor do, Chevalier writes with clarity: \\"You ruined me.\\"<br />It's these moments that make books worth reading. There is no pointless, unneeded sentiments until the ending, which despite its completeness I found to be rather empty. Griet is a likeable enough heroine in her aloofness, an intelligent young woman who knows how to get what she wants - even if she always doesn't /know/ what she wants. As her brother laughs and tells her that she cannot hide how much she yearns for her own master, the reader may get the impression that Griet knows more than she will even admit to herself.<br />Among all the other admirable points of this book: the lyrical, beautiful writing, the poignant descriptions, and the lush characterization, it is ultimately the suffering that Griet undergoes for her master that touched me the most. And though Griet is warned that he does not care for her any more than his other muses, and to not get 'captured in his world', there are little hints of something more. The agonizing hopelessness of Griet's love is refreshing, and presented in a non-sentemental way that even I, usually a hardcore anti-romance fan, enjoyed.<br />Ultimately, a book that makes you think. Perhaps not deep thoughts of the meaning of life, or the beginning of the universe, or the dawn of man, but thoughts about the complexities of love -- and how much love is worth.
B00006JKOL|1.0|Although I give this one star, I have to agree with one of the five star reviews that &quot;In my opinion, there is not one weak song on this album&quot;. Yes, there is not one weak on the album: EVERY SONG on the album is weak! (With the exception of the &quot;bonus track&quot; &quot;March the Mad Scientist&quot;.) Very, very weak. If Jethro Tull had released this as its first record, there never would have been a second Jethro Tull record.

B0000DD7LB|5.0|I took time off to actually go throught these pointless one-star reviews. I found that the same people come again and again to write mean reviews about 'In the zone' just because they cannot stand Britney.<BR>Unless you are a rock fan or a classical music fan, there is no reason why you should hate this CD so much. If you think this CD is like her previous efforts, you are mistaken. <BR>I'm not saying this is the best CD in the whole world but it definately deserves a couple of listens before being trashed.
B00005QIPH|1.0|Rarely am I motivated to place an unsolicited negative review in this forum. This album, however, is just so oppressively boring...well, I just have to! It is worse than boring, it sux! As one of my biggest disappointments of the year this recording proved to be completely unoriginal with pretentious \\"low-fi\\" production, thoughtless compositions and lyrics (superficiality is fine as long as it is presented as such), mediocre musicianship...shall I continue? This album and this group of insider phonies will be forgotten soon, mark my words.<br />Why have those with discerning taste reacted so violently to this group? It is not as if this album has contributed to the promulgation of war, hunger, and the exploitation of children. Why such a gnashing of teeth? I propose that this is in response to the fact that such mediocrity has been rewarded by huge record sales and exposure. The idea that success in the music industry has little to do with the actual quality of music contributes to the cynicism of those who know better and the artistic demise of those who are sucked in by the marketing of \\"poo as food.\\" That's right Strokes fans, you have been lied too. The music industry, through effective marketing, has told you that poo tastes good and is both healthy and safe. <br />If one cares about music, the success of an obviously horrid group may also give one the same anxiety that environmentalists have about genetically modified organisms. Who knows the level of contagion this may have!! Dear Lord, what if bands this bad start to dominate or eventually monopolize the music industry?!? TAKE UP ARMS AND REVEOLT NOW BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE!! THE STROKES MUST GO DOWN FOR THE GOOD OF ALL MANKIND AND THER FUTURE OF ROCK MUSIC!! SHOW NO QUARTER!!
0553573403|5.0|A Game of Thrones and the entire Song of Ice and Fire series have moved me in a way that no books have since I was exposed to the Lord of the Rings in fourth grade.  I have read A LOT of fantasy novels - 2 to 3 a week, not to mention a large number of the literary classics, and this is the finest reading of any kind I have ever come across.  As an aspiring author, Martin has totally altered my idea of what one can do with a story.  The plot itself is compelling, but what makes these books truly stand out is the character development.  There are countless noble families, each comprised of many people, all of whom somehow manage to have their own personalities.  While most fantasy series' have a handful of main characters and thousands of faceless grunts, this series contains scores of distinctive characters who the reader comes to care about.  Everyone has their own nickname and personality, and it means something to the reader when they die.  That's the other remarkable thing in Martin's books.  Everyone is expendable.  In most novels, the reader knows that one or two peripheral characters may be killed, but that the quest will have a happy ending and most of the good guys will be there at the end.  With Martin you don't know anything.  You can never predict what's going to happen next, no one is sacred, and even the villians and good guys aren't consistent in how they are perceived.  This is real; it's like reading history, not fiction.  You feel like this could really happen, and that's what sets it apart from all the rest.
0385510438|5.0|Well written and inspiring, like Jackson McCrae's THE BARK OF THE DOGWOOD, and yet having elements of Grisham's KING OF TORTS or even A PAINTED HOUSE (if you can believe that-think setting, not plot) I found this to be a truly enjoyable book.  Perhaps this was because I understood that Grisham was creating a hybrid work in a sense; combining elements and style from his other books.  The guy has written volumes and it's only natural that the would want to branch out and create something new out of his ideas.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good literary read.
B00006BTCA|5.0|I can totally understand why people won't like this album.  It isn't rock.  It isn't roll.  It isn't pop.  It isn't country.  It will never crack mainstream media.  However, it is an outstanding album with a style all its own.  I couldn't recommend it enough, but it isn't for everyone.
B000002UAX|5.0|Such great songs....&quot;Yer Blues,&quot; &quot;Glass Onion,&quot; &quot;Blackbird,&quot; &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps,&quot; &quot;Back in the USSR,&quot; &quot;Dear Prudence,&quot; &quot;Why Don't We Do It In The Road,&quot; &quot;I Will,&quot; &quot;Mother Natures' Son,&quot; &quot;Helter Skelter,&quot; &quot;I'm So Tired,&quot; &quot;Savoy Truffle,&quot; &quot;Rocky Racoon,&quot;...shall I go on? Name one record from ANY artist, past or present, that has so many mind blowing tracks and I'll eat your hat.
B00013RC9I|3.0|I grabbed &quot;Talkie Walkie&quot; the day it came out and immediately threw it in the car stereo on my way home from work.  My first impression: extreme, irrational anger.  I don't know if I've ever been so irate after buying an album.  Maybe my reaction was due to high expectations.  I'd been eagerly awaiting its release for months.  Maybe it was the effects they put on the vocals.  Maybe it was all the effusive reviews the album had been getting from sources I trust (Pitchfork, et al). Maybe it was the stupid lyrics.  Maybe it was the cover &quot;art.&quot;  Maybe I simply had a bad day at work.  Whatever it was, I was furious.  <br />But, three listens later, I kind of like it.  I'm not sure what to say about Air except that they're a truly unique band.  They defy categorization.  They're not like any other electronica band or any other pop band.  They're something else.  I wouldn't even call them innovative.  They're just...unique.  And cool--in spite of themselves.  <br />I actually think I've come to respect them for their singular vision.  Mind you, I'm not sure I always understand where they're coming from.  This intrigues me.  Maybe it's because they're French and I'm American--two extremely different sensibilities if ever there were.  I admit I don't like their lyrics, and their vocal, um, treatments bug me.  (I wish they would just sing in French or continue to use a &quot;featured&quot; guest vocalist like they did on &quot;Moon Safari&quot; with Beth Hirsch.  I wouldn't even mind it if they found a permanent vocalist a la a million other bands like St. Etienne.  Yet, at the same time, the idea that they want to handle their own vocals is admirable in a strange way that I can't articulate, even if they distort them in such a way that they sound inhuman.)  I should also admit that listening to Air sometimes reminds me of hearing a joke and not &quot;getting&quot; it.  But somehow I keep coming back.  &quot;Talkie Walkie&quot; is a complex record that rewards those who stick around for repeat listens.  It doesn't sound like anything else out there at the moment, and that, in large part, is its appeal.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Any good war movie will show you that war was hell.  Band of Brothers is in many ways about 10 hours of the best war movie ever made.<br />The soldiers have pimples.  Some fight for the right reasons, others not as much.  They are all affected by the war.  The action sequences are well done, the filmography excellent, the dialogue appropriate.  It is war as it should be.  A must buy!<br />Follow Easy Company from Normandy to Austria, stopping along the way for Operation Market Garden and Bastogne.  Buy this set.  It is top notch, from start to finish, from every aspect of the design.
B0000AQVCL|3.0|It is true- Jet blatantly rip off AC/DC, Nazareth, Iggy Pop, the Stones, etc.  They aren't original, they aren't subtle, and I think they set a record for the number of times &quot;yeah!&quot;, &quot;alright!&quot;, and &quot;whoo!&quot; is said on a single album.  That being said, this is still a good rock album.  Turn it up, roll down the windows, and hit the road.  And I disagree that they should be compared to the White Stripes or Strokes.  They remind me more of the Black Crowes in that they wear their influences on their sleeves but still put out some great rock.  Are they the flavor of the month?  Sure.  Will they be on &quot;classic rock&quot; stations as soon as they are pulled off the &quot;new rock&quot; stations?  Sure.  As long as they stay away from the average-at-best ballads, they're alright in my book.
B000002UAU|5.0|Many casual fans don't realize that the first tracks cut for the &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; sessions were none other than &quot;Penny Lane&quot; and &quot;Strawberry Fields,&quot; in that order! Just think what this classic would have been like with those two tracks! <br />I love it. Just great songs. The extended piano chord at the end of &quot;Day in the Life&quot; still makes the hair stand up on my neck. If I smoked pot, and I don't, &quot;Within You Without You&quot; would be the ultimate weed tune. I love singing to &quot;Getting Better, and &quot;When I'm 64.&quot; Ringo's underrated drumming is outstanding on &quot;Good Morning, Good Morning,&quot; as his vocals were warm and inviting on &quot;With A Little Help From My Friends.&quot;<br />These guys just brought out the best in each other. That's why McCartney and Lennon were never the same songwriters without the Beatles, and why George and Ringo never acheived the same excellence instrumentally. Combinations like this only happen once in a lifetime. I'm glad that it happened in mine.
1400031524|5.0|\\"The Dogs of Riga\\" is one of the earlier books in Henning Mankell's series about his somber fictional Swedish police Inspector Kurt Wallendar and the plot is darker and jerkier than in later stories. I first read the book when it was published in German in 1993 and it's the only one of the series that I regularly enjoy re-reading. There's nothing slick about the story telling: it has a very raw edge to it.<br />The story follows the traditional Wallendar plotline: an exotic foreigner arrives in the peaceful coastal town of Ystad, accompanied by a slew of violent acts and connections to powerful people that shock the overworked local police force. In this case, the foreign dogs who wash up on Sweden's shore are two very dead businessmen with drugs in their systems.<br />Wallendar follows the trail back across the Baltic Sea to Riga, the capital of newly independent Latvia. There he involves himself more in local \\"affairs\\" than is politic or safe. Mankell kicked up some dust with this book. The Latvia described is a chaotic mix of gangland crime and corrupt officialdom. Some Latvians took exception to that bleak picture. (Latvia became independent in 1991 and \\"Hundarna i Riga\\" was published the following year.)<br />Kommissar Wallendar is often compared to Georges Simenon's Inspecteur Maigret or Colin Dexter's Chief Inspector Morse. In this book, he also shows traces of John Le Carré's Smiley. Mankell has been extremely popular in Europe for a long time. Maybe his books are better read in a cold, damp climate like that of Sweden, but I can't see anything that makes them \\"difficult for some American readers\\" as Publishers Weekly advises.

0671027344|1.0|This was really a bad book. I mean the story line was alright its just that the characters were so uninteresting and flat. The main character kept switching back and forth between a really mentally retarted kid and a normal teenager. There were parts that were extreamly unrealistic and just plain stupid. I do not recomend this book.
B00004S6GL|5.0|Elliot Smith is a pure musical genius.  His music is as pure and honest as music can be.  This album is one to be treasured.  You will not be disappointed.
B00018D44U|5.0|The latest album from Norah Jones, &quot;Feels Like Home&quot; shows us a different side of a singer who clearly has some diverse tastes. Where her debut &quot;Come Away With Me&quot; was reminiscent of Jazz singers like Billie Holiday and Rosemary Clooney, &quot;Feels Like Home&quot; has more of a Gillian Welch sound to it, a feeling that's only enhanced by Jones' duet with Dolly Parton on the bouncy track &quot;Creepin' In&quot;. <br />But that doesn't make it any less spectacular. Jones' voice is still beautiful, her piano playing is lovely, and her backup musicians, The Handsome Band, are amazing. Fans of &quot;Come Away&quot; won't be disappointed, despite the change of style.<br />Something else that you see on &quot;Home&quot; that you didn't get before was more of Jones writing her own songs. Most of the tracks here are co-written, but Jones did write one track, &quot;What Am I to you&quot;, herself. I will say that Jones is no lyrical genius, but the lyrics take a backseat to the still hauntingly beautiful instrumental work, especially on &quot;Carnival Town&quot;, which has a nice string arrangement by the album's co-producer Arif Mardin.<br />So, to sum up: &quot;Feels Like Home&quot; is quite different from &quot;Come Away with Me&quot;, but it's no less great. Jones maintains the casual, relaxed quality of her music, and leaves fans more than satisfied. I can't wait to see what she comes out with next. Judging from this album, she can continue experimenting with whatever style she wants, and she'll still produce a wonderful work of art.
B000002UAO|5.0|...as Rubber Soul is one of the best albums ever recorded.  There isn't a sore spot on the record, and the price is worth it just for &quot;Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown,&quot; &quot;In My Life,&quot; &quot;Michelle,&quot; and &quot;Think For Yourself.&quot;  This is an important Beatles album as it is when they really started expanding musically and moving beyond the &quot;She Loves You&quot; material.  A must for Beatles fans and music fans in general.
B00000AFGM|5.0|Marilyn Manson was certainly accepted into the top notch of the metal world with the release of &quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot;, but it seems that when he went to make some changes for the sake of originality, fans were stubborn.  Mechanical Animals laid out some of the finest soundtracks of Manson's career (from Portrait, Antichrist, Holy Wood, and Golden Age), and while it is a little more emphasis on the technical effects, the lyrics are deep and meaningful, the vocals kick as much ass as ever, and the music is incredibly catchy.  <BR>   This era (along with Holy Wood) has my favorite group of band members: Manson (vocals, duh) Madona Wayne Gacy (keyboard/effects) Twiggy Ramirez (bass/guitar) and then John 5 on live guitar and Ginger Fish on live drums.  Twiggy disappointingly left the band (replaced by Tim Skold...), but there's nothing better than listening to the original bass lines he invented, breaking from the clich of playing the same pattern as the guitar, and rather creating his own melody.  <BR>    Best Songs on the CD: uh oh, all of them!  Great Big White World, Disassociative, The Speed of Pain, Fundamentally Lothsome, The Last Day on Earth, and especially Coma White* are excellent examples of the band's ability to crank out melodic, eerie, and meaningful tracks.  On the other hand, The Dope Show*, Rock Is Dead*, Posthuman*, I Want To Disappear*, I Don't Like The Drugs, New Model No. 15, and User Friendly get your adrenaline going, and offer some of the best heavy music that Manson offers. (*=5 best)<BR>   Okay, if you're still reading this, then you're very patient.  Summary I should have began with: DON'T BURN THIS CD, DON'T DOWNLOAD IT, GET A JOB AND SPEND A FEW BUCKS TO SUPPORT THE ARTIST YOU LIKE!  People are too lazy...also buy all of Marilyn Manson's other CD's, his EP's, his videos/DVD's, his book...
B00005JKC3|2.0|I been waiting for this new Hulk movie to come out when I first heard that it was going into production.<br />I was wondering all this time thinking, who was going to get the acting part for the Hulk character. Would it be some new up and coming actor that is a bodybuilder or would it be Lou Ferrigno?<br />I was disapointed to find out that the Hulk was nothing more than a computer animated figure. If Ben Aflek could play Dare Devil and Toby Miguire could play Spiderman and Micheal Keaton could play Batman, why couldn't Ang Lee get an actor/bodybuilder to play the Hulk?<br />Bruce Bana played the Bruce (David) Banner character OK, but I think Hugh Jackman has more of the Bruce (David) Banner look and could play the charater much better.<br />If Ang Lee makes another Hulk movie lets hope there is some kind of improvement to the Hulk character.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Released on July 20th, in 2001 in Japan, &quot;Spirited Away&quot; stayed in theaters for almost 10 months, breaking all the previous box-office records in Japan, including that of &quot;Titanic&quot; and &quot;Princess Mononoke&quot; by the same director Hayao Miyazaki. With this astonishing film about a girl's spiritual journey, Mr. Miyazaki again showed that he is one of the best directors living in the world. This animation film was also awarded prestageous Golden Bear Prize in Berlin Film Festival, and that is not a surprise at all, after you see this movie.<br />The story quickly is established, so don't ever be late for the show. It traces a girl's strange and fascinating life in another world, where her parents are accidentally magically transformed, and she has to survice herself and return to her own world. To do so, this pudgy-faced little girl Chihiro, now deprived of her name by a greedy witch Yu-baba, has to work at the baths where gods and sprites all over Japan come to take a rest. Chihiro's life is full of wonderful (and often hard, even terrifying) things, and through her experiences she learns how to live, gaining the true will and power, changing from a sulky girl languidly lying on the backseat of a car, into a lively and truely courageous girl. <br />That's all you have to know: you don't need to see its trailer (English version trailer is a bit misleading), and just watch this masterpiece. Though there is a character called &quot;Kao-nashi&quot; (meaning &quot;Faceless&quot;), who out of loneliness does something harmful to the place; and there is an episode about a very stinking monster who turns out something very different, there are no villains, no heroes, and no so-called actions. And another strength of the film comes from its designs of the baths. It is based on a mosaic of Japanese and Western traditions (the witch's office looks obviously Western while Chihiro and other female workers room is inspired from the texitle factory girls' residence 100 years ago) Incredibly, some part are even from Chinese style. <br />The story, some say probably rightly, goes slower in the latter half (of the film that runs more than 2 hours), but &quot;Spirited Away&quot; never lets you down. It's time for any American audience to know Miyazaki's name, and that animation films are not meant for only kids, but for adults.<br />[The following might hopefully help understand some part of the film. No spoilers contained, but you might read them after watching them. Al the names referred to are from Japanese original print.]<br />[1] The name &quot;Chihiro&quot; is, when written in Chinese letters, divided into two parts: &quot;Chi-hiro.&quot; The first part &quot;Chi&quot; has another way of pronounciation, &quot;Sen,&quot; which becomes her temporary name. <BR>[2] Chihiro's real name is &quot;Chihiro Ogino&quot; which is briefly seen on the contract paper she signs.<BR>[3] The handsome boy who offers a help to Chihio is called &quot;Haku&quot; which means in Japanese, &quot;white.&quot;<BR>[4] Haku's real name is &quot;Migihayami Kohakusui.&quot; All the Japanese audience, as Chihiro in fact was, would be surprised to hear this long and old-fashioned name, which clearly suggests his ancient and aristocratic origin.<BR>[5] The witch's spoiled baby is called &quot;Bou&quot; (and his name is written prominently in a Chinese letter on his clothes). This is shrewd naming because the word &quot;bou-ya&quot; (which is used to call, affectinately, to baby boys) implies too much fondness to the babies on mother's side. <BR>[6] Chihiro's father, at the diapidated red gate, talks knowingly about the posibility of a disused theme park. It is true that Japan saw economic depression after the boom of the 80s, and his remarks, though half telling of his too much confidence, have some ring of truth.<BR>[7] For Miyazaki's fans, there are some extra fun: see, for example, the re-appearance of &quot;Susuwatari&quot;s, tiny black speck-like creatures that carry coal in a boiler room. As fans know, they are also seen in Miyazaki's delightful film &quot;My Neighbor Totoro.&quot; And check out one of the &quot;guests&quot; at the spa who looks and moves exactly like Totoro.<BR>[8] And those harmless &quot;Susuwatri&quot;s eat Japanese traditional, very sweet confectionary called &quot;Konpeitou&quot; made from sugar. This is the part Japanese viewers smile because of the unexpected combination.<BR>[9] In the same boiler room, the spider-like veteran master gives Chihiro &quot;Kaisuu-ken,&quot; coupon-style tickets for train. This is also the part we would smile because we all somehow share the same experience of giving them to children who go somewhere by train or bus, or of finding very old ones somewhere in the desk.<BR>[10] That same kind master, seeing Chihiro step on the crawling worm, makes a gesture of a knife with his hand, and touches Chihiro's hands in a unique way. This is a (now out-of-fashion) custom when touching something very dirty, symbolizing the total safety from the object in case, often accompanied with Japanese word &quot;Engacho&quot; (no more connection). This part is also funny to us. <BR>[11] In the opening scene. behind the back of Chihiro, you can see the glimpse of half-hidden, red-colored package of chocolate bar, which looks like one famous brand. Probably, this is a small token of thanks for the company (famous for coffee, too), which joined in the tie-in campagin for the film's promotion in Japan.<BR>[12] Finally, director Miyazaki says that the film is originally made for unnamed 10-year-old girls he and the movieproducer are both acquainted with, and hope that those girls are delighted to see the film. No doubt they are.
B000002UAX|5.0|This is yet another truly essential album.  While it has been argued whether the Beatles really needed to release a double album (producer George Martin was against the idea), the end result effectively negates these objections.  The White Album is a collection of genres tossed into a musical blender, so to speak: the 50s rock of &quot;Back in the USSR,&quot; the old-time 1920s sound of &quot;Honey Pie,&quot; the insane guitar rock attack that is &quot;Helter Skelter,&quot; and so on.  And who can forget &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps,&quot; a classic George Harrison track with a great solo from Slowhand himself.   I have to say, though, I really don't like &quot;Revolution 9.&quot;  People might say it's &quot;art&quot; or something, but to me, when compared to the brilliance of the rest of the record, it's just rubbish.  But it's only one track, and don't it prevent you from checking this musical landmark out.
B000002UB3|5.0|Abbey Road was indeed the best album of 1969(perhaps of all time),as other offerings like the stones let it bleed or the who's tommy were okay but had there share of filler,abbey road rocks from start to finish,and is reputed to be the beatles biggest seller!
B000002OYB|5.0|Here we are with a post-Bat II Meat Loaf album that isn't Bat Out Of Hell III, so it is basically asking the question - is `Bat Out Of Hell' the only thing that makes Meat Loaf music sell?<BR>The answer, according to the charts at least, is no. Welcome To The Neighbourhood is not a Bat Out Of Hell album - in fact, only two songs on it are written by Jim Steinman, the architect of Bat Out Of Hell I and II, but this is - regardless - one of Meat's best LPs of all time.<br />The double record or single CD album kicks off with Where The Rubber Meets The Road. This is a brilliant track written by Paul Jacobs and Sarah Durkee, who Meat Loaf fans may recognise as the minds behind the 1984/85 hits Modern Girl and Piece Of The Action, as well as the majority of the album Bad Attitude. It's a brilliantly written song which is somewhat tongue-in-cheek and definitely controversial - the way Meat Loaf music so has the potential to be.<br />I'd Lie For You (And That's The Truth) took the UK charts by storm - this beautiful ballad by Dianne Warren is a great duet which really shows off female singer Patti Russo's talent. She is also showcased elsewhere on the album. This single went no.2.<br />If you liked the `Bat Out Of Hell' albums, then the next track should be right up your alley. Original Sin is by Jim Steinman and was originally released in 1989 on the album of the same name by female quartet `Pandora's Box'. This short-lived group had some great songs on their one and only album, and Original Sin is definitely one that is worth of recognition.<br />Simple little ditty 45 Seconds Of Ecstasy is a bit of a let down after the spectacular song that precedes it, but if you are disappointed by it, then don't worry - the track that follows will inspire you to continue on with the album anyway. Running For The Red Light, written by a variety of composers including Meat Loaf himself, is a brilliant rock track that is comparable to classics like Rock 'n' Roll Mercenaries and, particularly, All Revved Up With No Place To Go.<br />Keyboarder Jeff Bova wrote the instrumental Fiesta and it is featured here, played entirely on keyboard and keyboard programming - supposedly. I'm not sure I believe that, but you never know nowadays.<br />One thing no Meat Loaf album could possibly be without is a moving ballad of some kind. Well, this one's packed with them. The culmination of the first half of the album is Jim Steinman's classic Left In The Dark. Though Steinman did it a lot better on the 1981 album Bad For Good, it is very well performed here by Meat, although it critically lacks the New York Philharmonic Orchestra, which is possibly what made the Steinman original so good in the first place.<br />Dianne Warren's second contribution to the album comes in the form of Not A Dry Eye In The House, the second single and a ballad of epic proportions, not that different from I'd Lie For You, in fact. The video clip to this song was filmed in a historically maintained London theatre and looks absolutely brilliant.<br />To show that not only females can sing duets, Meat Loaf teams up with songwriter Sammy Hagar to perform Hagar's brilliant Amnesty Is Granted, a great rock track that keeps the spirit of the album up between ballads. It is followed immediately by If This Is The Last Kiss (Let's Make It Last All Night), which is basically I'd Lie For You chapter II, as it is not only by Dianne Warren, but it is also a Patti Russo duet and is basically the same content matter.<br />Martha is a classical ballad which has been brilliantly rendered by Meat and the Neverland Express, as it is undeniably a great song, but it is perhaps one of the lesser tracks on an album packed to overflowing with great songs.<br />All good Meat Loaf records need a nice, calming track to close them out, and there have been some great ones in there - For Crying Out Loud, Everything Is Permitted, Fallen Angel, Sailor To A Siren, Rock 'n' Roll Hero and Lost Boys And Golden Girls - so whatever got the job of closing out Welcome To The Neighbourhood would want to be something pretty special. And it is - Where Angels Sing is a track on comparable grounds with For Crying Out Loud which is the best piano ballad of all time, so that's really saying something.<br />So there's no Two Out Of Three Ain't Bad, and a distinct lack of I'd Do Anything For Love (Although this time around, Meat will Lie For You), but who cares? Meat Loaf had quite a successful career through the `80s with other composers, and he has continued that glorious tradition here. A must have album.
B0000C6E4D|4.0|I have to admit,,When I first listen to this cd, I felt a bit dissapointed...the songs all seemed soft and slow. Nothing seemed to be easily accessible, with the Fallen being an exception.. But after listening, I discovered more to this whole album. Yes, this is different than her previous, but that is good! Change is good, and these songs show a maturity that some artist never aquire. I hate buying a new cd from an artist I enjoy and it sounds the same. These songs are all beautiful and now I love this album. The title Afterglow is apt, for these songs leave a warm, quiet feeling in your soul. Don't give up on this one just because it takes some time to enjoy. Best songs, in my opinion, World on Fire, Stupid and Time. Though I could find something to love on each song.

B00009TB5G|5.0|The Two Towers is a very complicated story. Fitting it into three hours can make some scenes seem a little rushed to those who have read the book (such as myself). That is my only problem with the theatrical edition. I really don't care about any of the changes (except maybe Aragorn falling off the cliff) because I understand why the makers made the changes, unlike &quot;Tolkien Purists&quot; who have not a clue the challenge of transfering a huge book with such a complicated plot to a 3 hour movie. Anyway, to the point, it was around 30 minutes added to the Fellowship on the Extended Edition. But this year, we are in for a bigger treat as 43 minutes will be added on to The Two Towers in the Extended Version. This edition will make the movie so much better as it will feel less rushed. I will, however, rent the theatrical for all the features that will not be included in the extended extras.
B0001AVZA8|3.0|I think the screenplay was poorly written.  The character motivation was weak, and ends were not tied up.  This is a screenplay that follows a Hollywood formula, but the choices made about why each event would happen are not credible; and one character, presented as a major one, is left out of the ending entirely.  Example that gives no spoilers:  Jack and Diane need to spend time together in order to fall in love.  They aren't people who would spend time together, so, as the formula goes, the first 10 minutes set us up for Jack to be required to stay at Diane's house long enough for their attraction to develop.  The motivation for his having to stay is so absurdly unrealistic--even by movie standards--that a second one is written into the script - equally not credible.<br />When I first turned off the DVD, I thought it was horrid.  But, I woke up the next morning thinking about it, about this love they felt.  It took until the next day to get beyond the plot flaws, see that their feelings remained with me, and that I felt something. I liked what I felt, though it was bittersweet.  The awakening of their love is what I felt; I know this feeling, and this film brought it back to me to the extent that I felt raw emotion.<br />The Keanu character is unnecessary - as much as I liked the character and liked him in this film - and, as such, the script was unable to accomodate his presence.  He was not only unnecessary, but contributed to at least one plot flaw: a woman, Diane, has her life in order, in an order she adopted, and hasn't dated men in awhile.  Suddenly, she has two men (one quite young).  This is farfetched.  <br />Thus, Keanu was used as a pawn, a device, to show Diane her feelings for Jack.  Of course, many other--better--devices could have been chosen.  As it is, Keanu is quite a good character - too good for the role of pawn. Therefore, he has a dichotomy that makes the whole element not work: we know enough about him to like him and be sympathetic towardhim (he's written as nearly flawless in character, and a great guy too!), yet his purpose is plot-device.  <br />What do you do with a major character who is relegated to plot device?  This film doesn't.  It doesn't do anything with him.  I found this a problem - I liked the guy.<br />So, is he there because the director was uncertain of herself and put in a handsome young man?  It plays that way.  If he's there as the person he's presented to be, I'm guessing his pivotal moments are on the cutting room floor.<br />So, the film follows the romantic comedy progression - all the twists occur when they &quot;should,&quot; in a Hollywood film - but the twists, devices, and motivations are very weak.<br />That said, the emotions opened to both Jack and Diane--who each hadn't felt them for differing reasons and time periods--work.  I believe these two characters, and I believed in them.  I loved their journeys of discovery of feeling.  Diane Keaton - beautiful.  Jack Nicholson - believable, and usually I don't care much for his all-too-similar performances.<br />Keanu/Julian - what did he feel? Why single? Why many things?  Too main of a character with too little going on - both too much and too little of the Julian character was given to us.  And this is a 2-hour-long movie.
B00000JLWW|5.0|I can't get enough of the whole Titanic thing. I have 4 DVDs (soon to be 5, with a DVD on the Britannic too!), 3 videos, about 12 books, the script signed by James Cameron... I'm a scary lady! I just can't get enough of it! And I'm even sad enough to have an animated DVD of the Titanic, made for kids. Hey, it's fun!<br />What is most depressing about this DVD is the severe lack of extras. You get a pretty average trailer, and that's it! James Cameron is normally well known for his great extras on DVD (the first two Terminators come to mind). There have been rumours about a special edition coming out hopefully in time for Christmas (someone I know has to keep reassuring me that it will come out!) So I'm hoping and praying for that, as the extras are pretty lousy, for a James Cameron DVD.<br />I absolutely adore this movie. It still gets me every time I watch it, and although I've never actually cried, I do get a bit teary, but I have to watch, cos everytime I watch it, I've normally got all my makeup on! The whole relationship between Jack &amp; Rose (a relationship which has been copied in many other movies about the Titanic) is so sweet, although they may seem in love, Rose only says it to Jack once and that's when they're both in the water. He never responds - which makes him seem like a bit of a jerk to be honest. But that's the only low point that Jack's character has. Kate Winslet and Leo DiCaprio are perfect as Jack &amp; Rose, although they could have been any of these actors/actresses: Matthew McConaughey, Gwyneth Paltrow, Michael Biehn (as Cal Hockley, which could have been cool), Christian Bale and Macaulay Culkin. Kate has to appear completely naked in front of Leo (very embarrassing), but she flashed him when they first met to break the ice! When Jack draws Kate, it's actually James Cameron's hands. In post-production, Cameron, who is left-handed, mirror-imaged the sketching shots so the artist would be appear to be right-handed, like Leonardo DiCaprio.<br />James Cameron got the idea for his own Titanic movie after watching A Night To Remember (a pretty average Titanic movie if you ask me, I mainly don't like it, cos it's in black &amp; white!), and spent 5 years researching Titanic. There are many similarities between A Night To Remember &amp; Titanic. A number of scenes are arranged and in some cases scripted almost identical. This is particularly true of these scenes: Thomas Andrews telling Capt. Smith the sinking is &quot;a mathematical certainty&quot;; the Titanic's band preparing to depart at the end, only to turn around and regroup as Hartley begins playing 'Nearer My God to Thee' by himself (though a different version of the song is used in the 1958 film); a shot of Ismay in a lifeboat as the Titanic sinks behind him; Thomas Andrews looking at a painting as Titanic prepares to sink; and Andrews encountering a man by the Grand Staircase and telling him the ship is doomed (in Cameron's film, he tells Rose).<br />A very creepy fact: there actually IS a J. Dawson (Joseph), who was on the Titanic and died. Cameron only discovered this after the script was finished that there had been a real &quot;J. Dawson&quot; who died aboard the Titanic. This &quot;J. Dawson&quot; was trimmer Joseph Dawson, who had been born September 1888 in Dublin, Ireland. His body was salvaged and buried at Fairview Lawn cemetery in Nova Scotia with many other Titanic victims. Today, his grave stone (#227) is the most widely visited in the cemetery, all thanks to the movie!<br />Something else which is quite disappointing about this movie is that the Californian,which had stopped for the night due to the ice hazard and was within sight of the Titanic throughout the sinking, is not featured at all. (Californian's ice warning had been received and sent to the bridge but was not placed in the chartroom.) Many other Titanic movies, most notably the TV version, starring Catherine Zeta Jones &amp; Peter Gallagher, rely heavily on the Californian scenes when the Titanic is sinking.<br />Gloria Stuart also stars, as the 'Old Rose'. Really, she's only 86, but she had to be aged to 101, which can't have been a pleasant experience - what a scary thought!<br />This is a terrific movie. Most people love it, although you get the occasional review, especially on here, saying that it's not good. But it's the whole romance about it, and the whole history of it. I am now eagerly awaiting the special edition, otherwise I'll be having words with James Cameron personally! Even a commentary!
B000059XUO|5.0|I watched the other 2 crows before this, and I thought they were just pure garbage.  One day I was flipping through channels and saw the crow 1, I was thinking this might have been the garbage that started it all.  But when I saw it , it had something the other crows didn't have, potential, charisma, energy, ambition, and a wonderful plot.<br />This is a story about Eric(Brandon Lee) returnung from the dead, and avenging his love Shelly(Sofia Shinas)  and going up aganst a large gang that goes on a rampage on their personal holiday called devil's night.<br />Brandon Lee delivers his greatest, and sadly his last performance of his carrer.(I'm sure this promised him a successful movie carrer).  This movie does a great job of combining fantasy, drama, romance, and action it.  Anyone who loves action/goth/fantasy/type movies sould definitly give this movie a shot.<br />Interesting fact:Brandon Lee just like his father Bruce Lee died on the set.  Bruce Lee died from Cerebral Edema, and Brandon Lee died from a cap of a .44 shot(When he got shot up by all of Top Dollar's men.  It's sad how this is sort of a &quot;father like son&quot; saying.<br />P.S.:When Brandon Lee died, it's like he took the crow saga with him.  The other two sucked; it's like what happened to the Matrix, and Robocop.  Why did they stop making the crow saga? Cuz when the first one came out, the sun shined, then it started to rain when the other two cam out.  I guess they figured out the first crow's saying  &quot;It can't rain all the time&quot;<br />peace
B00005JMEW|5.0|\\"Kill Bill\\" is an anomaly in today's Hollywood culture. Here is a movie that neither makes you think too hard nor tears at you heartstrings--and it is a truly excellent flick. Under the shrewd (and possibly insane) hands of Quentin Tarantino, \\"Kill Bill\\" details an ultrally brutal and even more emotionally statisfying quest for revenge.<br />Beat to a bloody pulp and shot in the head and left for dead at her wedding day, The Bride (Uma Thurman, whose name is never revealed) is carted away in a four-year-long coma. She wakes up and vows revenge. And, oh, does Thurman play revenge well. It seems that the supporting cast (Lucy Lui, Vivica A. Fox, among others) truly beat Thurman to the edge of death. Her eyes convey her emotion--the limited and brief dialogue isn't even necessary. She is surpremely convincing in every aspect of her performance, even throughout the amazingly stylish fight sequences (which put \\"The Matrix\\" to shame). She fights like a pro with samurai swords, lethal daggers, butcher knives, and frying pans.<br />One of the main draws to this redefining adventure is the hilarious subject matter. Tarantino goes overboard. Blood flies about like fruit punch, gushing out of wounds like a torrential downpour (sometimes, in fact, you will even wonder if the human body has that much blood), and in any other movie, that gore would force you to leave--but here, it doesn't. Why? Because Tarantino never takes himself too seriously. Fight scenes are punctuated with effective and sometimes laughable dialogue. But beneath the hokey action scenes and the cute quips, there is a real movie at work here. Tarantino dances about the timeline, bouncing the story back and forth to a dizzying point, which forces your full attention on the gradually unfolding general story. The cliffhanger ending merely seals the deal.<br />\\"Kill Bill\\" deserves all of the accolades it gets. Although it may seem to be a hackfest on the surface, there is true talent at work here. Uma Thurman andLucy Lui give inspiring performances; the story, however linear it may be, it instantly grabbing; and Tarantino's masterful direction is as inspiringly as it is slightly distubring. A true masterpiece. One of the films to beat for 2003. --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title
B000089RVX|4.0|Originally posted on The Metal Circus<br />The first time I heard Evanesence was while watching the movie \\"Daredevil\\".  The song was \\"Bring Me To Life\\" and I felt this song had an energy that was missing from a lot of the newer bands that were making appearances most recently.  Someone had described them to me as a \\"Linkin Park with a girl singer\\" but that is a wrong assumption.  Singer Amy Lee is a far cry from some demure Waif as she belts out the numbers on this CD.  Her voice packs a punch like some of the great rockers of our time.  I immediately think of Pat Benetar and Lita Ford.  Yet she is also capable of delivering a sensual ballad which you will hear in \\"My Immortal\\".<br />My favorite tracks on the disk are \\"Going Under\\", \\"Bring Me To Life\\" and \\"My Immortal\\", so I guess the consistent radio play is keeping those numbers in my head.  The remainder is good enough to merit purchasing this item, but Listeners should be aware that many songs have a similar feel and sound.  I dont think that this is bad as it might be what they were trying to lay down as their unique sound.<br />Overall the production is solid and the CD booklet is nice.  It includes lyrics (my personal favorite thing) and a couple of pictures.<br />Since this CD was released, the group lost core contributor Ben Moody.  All songs on the disk were written by Lee and him. Reports have said that he walked offstage in the middle of a show on the European tour and went home.  While I don't know what led to that, it will be interesting to see if Evenescence will suffer the Sophomore Curse in the absence of a key writer when the new album is released.<br />In keeping with the goal to prevent people from illegally downloading music, there is the chance to download a different version of \\"My Immortal\\" if you own the CD.  A file can be downloaded from the site and it checks your copy of the CD for authenticity.<br />Ken Pierce @ The Metal Circus<br />[...]
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Bill Murray is Bob Harris, a once popular American actor who now, in his middle-age, has found more acceptance and money from the people of Japan than from his own country. He arrives at a prestigious hotel in Tokyo and is given a royal treatment by his greeters and hosts. He is by himself in the land of the rising sun, his wife and kids having stayed behing in the US while he travels across the globe to do some liquor commercials. This Tokyo excursion will take about a week, and the monetary reward will be quite handsome. Contrast this with Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson), who is at the same hotel tagging along with her photographer husband, John (Giovanni Ribisi), as he does a multiple-day photo shoot. John is at work most of the time, and so Charlotte is by herself at the hotel, her attempts to keep from being bored proving fruitless. Both Bob and Charlotte are married people, but they are also very lonely people, and that is what \\"Lost In Translation\\" is all about.<br />Bob and Charlotte catch glimpses of one another at different places in the hotel, and finally decide to converse in earnest at the hotel bar. The entire plot of the film is about these two people getting to know each other. The story revolves around them. In fact, the story [is] them. Bob, in his early-fifties, is old enough to be Charlotte's dad, but that doesn't matter here. It's not about age. It's about the place, and the points that each of these people are at in their lives. Bob loves his children very much, but we do not sense he feels the same for his wife. We hear her on the phone when she calls him, and the same weary sentiment seems to flow from her voice. They are becoming a couple in name only. Then there's Charlotte & John. Both are young, and both are self-possessed. John is into his photography to the point of neglecting Charlotte. But we get the idea that even if gave her more attention, Charlotte might not really warm up to him. She has issues of her own. If Bob is going througha mid-life crisis, then Charlotte seems to be going through a young-life crisis.<br />\\"Lost In Translation\\" is about being alone. Loneliness doesn't always mean that someone is physically separated from loved ones or from people in general. One can be alone in the middle of a crowded room. Such is the case with Bob & Charlotte. They're in Japan for a week. They don't really speak the language. Bob's wife is in the US, and Charlotte's husband is always at a photo shoot. The two lost souls find each other at the hotel, spend time with one another, and even sleep in the same bed together. But we know that while this is providing a small comfort for the time being, it is not a lasting solution to their problems. And we also understand that both Bob and Charlotte -- even if Bob's wife were in Tokyo with him, and John was by Charlotte's side all the time -- would still be lonely. Their life struggles lie deeper than what one person can provide, especially the persons they have chosen to settle down with.<br />This is probably Bill Murray's most understated performance, and it works brilliantly. He lets you in on Bob's emotions without betraying too much sentimentality. He conveys so much with just a smile, a frown, his body language, or simply the look in his eyes. He should get an Oscar nomination for this. Scarlett Johansson, who left me unimpressed in the movie \\"Ghost World\\" a few years ago, is excellent in her role here. She portrays Charlotte as a deep, troubled, yet intelligent young woman and, like her co-star, does it without overstating it. (...)Johansson is definitely an actress to watch for in the coming years.<br />Sofia Coppola has succeeded in creating a sliver of time & place with \\"Lost In Translation\\". It creates two of the most realistic characters to ever grace the cinema. You forget this is a movie, and start to really care for these people as though they really exist. And you get the feeling that this is a single, solitary moment that will be over withand then fondly remembered by the characters for a long time to come. This sweeps over you before the film is even over, much like when you are in the middle of a special occurence or event in your own life, and you stop and think about the fact that at one point - very soon - it will cease to be the present, and will instead become only a nostalgic memory.<br />And there you have \\"Lost In Translation\\"

6305014140|5.0|First, regarding its name: a more accurate translation from the original Japanese would be &quot;The Chronicles of Ninja Jubei.&quot;<br />Second, regarding the &quot;misogynism&quot; in the film: While I understand how it might be interpreted that way, that's not quite true. Kagero is a fascinating character due to the tragedy of her curse. She plays a pivotal role in the story, but most importantly, the ultimate point of the love subplot is that Jubei's sense of honor is so strong and his heart is so pure that he will not use her as just a weapon or an object of lust, the way everyone else has used her. Even at the cost of his life (you will understand when you see it). That's what makes it such a powerful story.<br />This movie isn't for everyone, but it's an incredible film. It's extremely intense, so sensitive viewers should beware. The animation is beautiful; the action is intense and intelligently choreographed, not mindless and brutal; the plot is highly intricate and very well written.<br />The best anime that I've ever seen, period.
