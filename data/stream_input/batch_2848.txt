B001MSMULG|3.0|An art restorer. An unlikely cover for a spy. Yet, that is what the author Daniel Silva choses for his protagonist Gabriel Allon. Gabriel Allon is an Israeli. He is also part of the elite team which uses all means to eliminate Israel's enemies. Now he is in retirement after a tragedy. But his former boss Ari Shamron closing toward his retirement due to old age and struggling with the internal politics coerces into accepting an assignment.<br /><br />Daniel Silva uses the backdrop of Israeli-Palestinian peace summit in NYC during the 90s to tell a story of espionage. This becomes interesting because he weaves in real incidents and real people in his narrative. Moreover, he uses an unlikely profession which needs a lot of patience and sharp eyes as the cover for his protagonist. How he links the cover job to the actual job of the protagonist is interesting.<br /><br />At the bottom line, this is an escapist fare. This is a good read if you enjoy fiction and you also follow the current affairs actively. Otherwise, it is a routine spy thriller. Be warned, this is a series and this book is the first one in the series.
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|The movie was lighthearted and cute.  It was a bit silly at times, but fun for a romantic date night.
1439153663|5.0|Insightful book with regard to the time period.  The twist of adding an Irish immigrant orphan was a great idea and so interesting to see the human conflict that creates.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Sylvia Day can really write a good book. I can't wait for books 5 and 6 in the Crossfire series to come out
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Not bad at all, nice remake of an old classic, With updated graphics and interface. Good times again. Fun fun
B00A0SMTXS|5.0|Excellent movie a must have good spacial effects get it in blue ray its well worth it dont wait get it today
B0066WJLU6|4.0|Need it at night when we are out for dinner at restaurants with very low light and can't read the menu and when we need to search for something in the trunk of the car. Great tool.
B004DCB62M|5.0|Love reading a good mystery that the ending isn't predictable.  Always a big fan of the older mysteries that let you imagine yourself in the story.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|This a great game. I've never played Magic beforw, but this is what I would have expected from gameplay. My only criticism is that the speed of the game ican be slow at times. It would've been nice to have an option to turn off the animations.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Good challenge.  the game makes you use your brain.  I had to think out side the box.  I hope the rooms are just as good.
B005KJJ4F8|3.0|Takes a while to grab hold but it's a unique version of the story.... This is the first part of a series and the book does not finish but leads to another story.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Great game for every age regardless of whether you are a fan of the movie or not. Be warned, however, your kids will make you watch this movie if you haven't already. And you will like it... hehe.
0345529057|5.0|I got these books about a month ago, and am currently on the third book. I find the books interesting and the plot well thought-out and not very predictable (like some of the books out there). Its got great detail and the characters are well-developed. I like these books very much so far. The only thing is that each is about 1,000 pages long, and though the story is interesting, if you're the type of person who gets distracted easily and wants a quick ending, it does take a while. The story starts and the problems just get bigger and it the plot takes turns you wouldn't have imagined and it keeps you entertained, although at a few parts I found myself getting a bit bored (but then something interesting happened and I kept reading). All in all, a good read, but I would not recommend to anyone under 16 or 17 because of certain mature content
B008602KQI|4.0|It was a refreshing change from the 'usual' movies. I had problems with streaming (which I haven't had with other movies). It could be my connection, so giving them a benefit of doubt. Overall worth watching for acting and some special effects.
B0025X4OYI|5.0|What's to say: the man was a genius and this sounds as great today as it did when I first heard it many years ago.
B00AB7HESI|4.0|I purchased this game on kindle fire and it was pretty good I must say but it is just similar levels in the game so that loses some points
B00AYM6JFO|5.0|I love Willie doing old standards.  His being 80 just makes it better: so much style, so much musical maturity, so much soul. If I could sing like Willie........I would.
B007OAAK0O|5.0|I HAVENT SEEN THIS SHOW IN YEARS AND IM ORIGINALLY FROM N.Y. NOW RELOCATED TO N.C. THIS SHOW MADE ME FEEL AT HOME.
B008JFUO4U|5.0|Excellent movie. Tom cruise is brilliant. Super sci-fi. Beautiful film. Think when you view...there's more to this movie. Will hold your attention. Highly recommend!!!
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|Josh Homme and Queens of the Stone Age never disappoint. Also, I recently saw them at Red Rocks, and for the second time they blew me away. Be warned though that this is a bit of a departure from previous efforts. However,  &#34;I Sat by the Ocean&#34; and &#34;If I Had a Tail&#34; will definitely quench your thirst for nostalgia.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Addictive can't put down. Play into the wee hours of the night. Nice to have a fame that actually works the brain muscles!
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|love it awesome game ww2 weapons are so interesting and it gives you some of the best from the war I love this app and everything about it
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Somewhat  easy, only ten levels.  I still enjoyed it.  I got through it all in about half an hour.  Simple puzzle solving skills.
B00AP9RQE4|3.0|This book focuses primarily on Miles cousin Ivan which might be justified because poor Ivan has lacked some character development and success in his own right - always been Miles' fall-guy, however this book does live up the interesting and exciting dramatic plot development of most of the series.<br /><br />The book plods along in a painfully slow and predictable manner and degenerates from &#34;Space Opera&#34; to tedious &#34;Soap Opera&#34;. Still as a big Bujold fan and follower of the series it was a worthwhile read.
140006922X|5.0|There are other excellent reviews of this book, but what I personally appreciate is an honest, clear eyed look at the available historical evidence: A great antidote for wishful thinking.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|Taubes is an absolute hero. You might think, hey, he is not a scientist himself, so what would he know? But the fact is that he has massively researched this stuff by reading thousands of scientific studies and talking to many top scientist who properly understand the biochemistry and physiology of metabolism.<br />Dietary advice in the Wester world is dominated by private profit food industry interests and by non-evidential claims about the dangers of fat. Taubes have done a profound service to human health knowledge by showing how real science does not support those myths.<br />This book is part of the massive shift beginning to occur, and will find its place on the central canon of revolutionising our health understanding to overcome the rise of CVD and metabolic diseases. It is not only &#34;fat&#34; people who need to know about this though. Beware the skinny diabetic to be....<br />I have much gratitude to Taubes for his dogged battle against dogma. May he thrive!
B004XXIHS2|4.0|Worth the time to read a good mystery for entertainment.  The plot thickens as the murderer gets closer and closer to his goal of the all mighty dollar.
B0067R0APK|1.0|I am so upset for updating my Accuweather app the other day.  I had been using the 2012 version that I paid for, not the free one.  And I loved it.  Then I noticed there was a update to get the 2013 version and I figured I should update it.  Well, it sucks so bad now!  I wish I could go back to the older one.  The radar screen jumps instead of going smooth.  It takes FOREVER to load just to see todays temps. And the layout just isn't \\"fun\\" and simple, it SUCKS! I just absolutely HATE this app and will delete it and I don't even care about losing my money!
B00DIFARQ6|5.0|The game is about a plane that is about to crash. It feels like real life. I recommend that everyone downloads this game.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Insightful, gives some history on ultra running/runners, and the Tarahumara. Prob the main reason why I purchased this book. I was really curious about these tribe in Mexico.<br /><br />Goes into running, someof the mechanics, and running shoes vs running without or minimal shoe. anyways i found it insightful and enjoyed it.<br /><br />Highly Recommended
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Great game to kill some time. Starts of easy but can get very challenging. Definitely worth ninety nine cents. Buy it.
B008MM9630|4.0|This is a cute and fun fairy farm game.  Enjoy the colorful graphics and fun names for the different items.  Great time waster.  A lot of fun.  Adults and kids can enjoy this game.
B0061PEAUY|4.0|Love all Kathy's books ....this one was no disappointment. Thank you Kathy for geography,cultural and historical lessons along with a great who dun it!
0765324849|5.0|If you are a fan of mythologies and love seeing how a world was formed, then this book is for you.<br /><br />How did ADAM come about?<br />How did the Little Sisters come about?<br />Sinclair, Fontaine, Ryan, tennenbaum, suchong and more have great stories surrounding them. I read this book in just a few days and couldn't out it down.
B001AFF25W|5.0|Some of the ideas I had heard or read before, but I loved the way it was light-hearted and informative.  The analogy to eating a frog is genius and makes it fun to read and think about.
B00C3JU7D6|1.0|I love this album but am mad that it came in damaged. Since the outer packaging wasn't damaged I couldn't exchange it. Super annoying.  Great album though.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|I like this game. I like most games like this though. Plays well on a Kindle Fire HD. Good for a free game.
B004EBT5CU|4.0|Hadn't heard some of the songs. Not all are great but what she does is unique sounding and worth the time to listen
B005544TRQ|5.0|Best show on TV period. What guy doesn't want to be Harvey Specter? Has enough drama to keep you guessing and gives you the inside look at the life of a big time NYC closer.
B009LXEBD4|4.0|Kelly does a good job on this collection. More talented than originally expected. She has a bright future and is headed in the right direction. Makes good song choices.
B006SMLAMQ|1.0|Paid 99&cent; for it, hasn't worked since the day i first opened it. It shows the time, EVERY SINGLE OTHER THING says &quot;n/a&quot;. And yes, I'm connected to the internet.
0345525558|5.0|I highly recommend this book!  :)  Great characters, excellent writing - a great read for a teacher!  You will not be disappointed...
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I Loved Missile Defense From Back In The Day. I Like That I Can Do Upgrades Now Make The Game A Bit More Fun.<br />.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I love this game but so do my kids. Sometimes I wonder who likes it more. It is great for all ages!
B000FC1LOC|5.0|I love this book but the ending was so unexpected that I almost died when I found out what happened to Anna :(
B00821OX98|4.0|Keeps you on the edge of you seat. Fast paced with good acting. Keeps you interested and aware in the worse case something such as a world in complete disorder things like this could happen!
B004SRPXWQ|1.0|I would not recommend this game because most of the buttons you have to pay for except for four of them and they are lame plus on a regular  kindle fire he will not speak at all but if you don't believe me then that's bad for you.
B00005JKMQ|5.0|After reading novels about Muhammad Ali, students can benefit from the cultural capital  of viewing and discussing the information highlighted in Ali starring Will Smith.  Students can then be afforded the opportunity to create a Venn diagram comparing what they viewed to what they read in the novels they have previously read about his life.  I would however, like to purchase an edited version of the same film for educational purposes.  My students call me &#34;Old School&#34;, still I would like to reserve certain portions of the film for an adult audience, rather than students coming of age.  I think that they are over exposed to much too much, much too soon.<br />Nonetheless, Will Smith personified the role he played, to the extent, that I forgot that he was Will Smith and came to know him as Muhammad Ali as I viewed the DVD.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|This book surely keeps you reading. I couldn't put it down! Be sure to check it out if you love reading books with twists! Highly recommended!
B000Y0Q5NM|5.0|I enjoyed this series.  It is just as good as the first time it was on the sci fy channel.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This app is terrific. I use it for my phone and kindle. I inform pretty much anyone I talk to, about this app. Especially people who have a lot of difficulty finding room on their device. The app name says it all !!!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Great book. Sad ending.  I really wanted a happy ending, and I almost thought it was going to happen! Would absolutely read it again.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|Love it! Super scary and fun. Great to do if you want a scare. I'd recommend to horror loving people. :)
159463176X|5.0|First of Hosseini's books that I had read and I loved it.  It was a wonderful picture of a land, country and culture we have such a negative thought on.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|It's fun. It gets harder pretty fast so it isn't a drag to play. Like I said in the description, it's a good time waster
B000000XCA|5.0|If you had it on vinyl, it's worth replacing.  If you enjoy rock, but aren't familiar with this album, you owe it to yourself to check it out.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Wish things didn't cost so many bannanas! Otherwise  a really fun game. My 2 1/2 year old loves it as do I !
B003O86FMW|5.0|Love the ending.  This book is very well written. If you like Hunger Games and Mocking Jay you will love this book.  The story of Peeta and Katniss continue and you will never except the turns and twists in this book.  I couldn't put it down.  It is a page turner.
B00BGD8CFK|4.0|This is a great looking case and provides almost otterbox like protection without being too thick.  Problem is there is just enough \\"protection\\" near the lightning cable connection to render both my dock at work and at home useless.  I'm keeping it for when I travel because it is hard to leave behind (a problem for me once in a while) being so bright in color and the protection factor it provides.  I've looked for lightning dock extender adapters but haven't found one to date.  Hopefully soon.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I have read it three times it is that good.  Of course I read the Hunger Games first and then I read Mocking Jay.  The surprises of the plot keep you turning the page wanting more and more.  Not knowing where the story is going.  I recommend this book to all age groups.  This book is not just for teens.  Adults read this. this is a great book.  It is a story of adventure, thrill, action and a love story so softly put in that you just get it in the best doses.  This is a must read.
B00AS1Q93S|4.0|Like many Jack Reacher fans, I had my doubts about Tom Cruise playing Jack Reacher. Cruise is not a six foot tough guy. However, he despite the physical detraction (too small, too nice looking) he played Jack Reacher very well, and the movie maintained the flavor of a Jack Reacher novel. I rented it first, then bought the movie because it surprised me by actually being a pretty darn good flick
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I Love this game it's like having a real horse I love horses but can't afford it but this game changed that
0316743003|5.0|Skunk Works was an incredible read that adds so much value in so many fields.<br /><br />If you are interested in contemporary history and the technical drivers behind many political as well as military decisions ranging from WW2 until this day you will love this book. As a reader of other military/political books Skunk Works ties a lot of stories together. Story telling is excellent, and I read this book almost from the first page til the end without stop.<br /><br />Skunk Works is also an excellent account of how a \\"small\\" R&D-branch can manage innovation projects, that in the end results in billions of revenue and thus qualify for listing in the Fortune 500.<br /><br />The book also server as an inspirational read for every executive in the technology field with the ambition to move the company from \\"average\\" or \\"good\\" to become really Great, and an industrial leader.
0691080976|3.0|Folks it was not what I remembered it to be. I lost or gave away my first copy and what I needed was not &#34;G. Polya&#34;. It's a good book for someone wishing to teach math but as a reference book on mathematics - it's not.
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|There was plenty of action but it lacked the humor of previous Die Hard movies.  It felt like something was missing.
0525478817|5.0|This book changed the way I look at things, I laughed, and I cried this is a perfect book I have been carrying for weeks now just to be close to it. Great book!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I already read this book before and its still interesting. I might even read it again in a few months. I like rereading books like this because you notice something new each time. I recommend this book.
1444737112|5.0|What a heartfelt story. I am amazed that this really happened. There were times where I cried and laughed at some of the events that James and Bob encountered. I am sooo happy that these two found each other. I wish both of them the best. I also want to give Bob the biggest hug and millions of kisses. He is so adorable. I'm so happy that James was able to get sober. I highly recommend this book.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It was full of surprises, and adventure. It was a great ending. I thought it would be a horrible ending but it was perfect.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I have a kindle fire and have recently purchased a tablet and decided to move to the tablet - no reflection on the Kindle. Down loaded the app logged in and all my books were there.<br /><br />Very simple.
B00190KZUU|5.0|Strongly recommend watching this movie every few years and notice how the meaning changes with time. Loved this movie from day 1.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Looks good and the controls respond well. Good way to kill some time. Gets kinda boring after awhile though, not much to do it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is a.great series and I cannot wait for season four! This season left quite an unexpected cliffhanger. Excellent writing and acting.
B001ANYDAO|4.0|Good book and VERY interesting.  Lots of things to think about while reading this book!  Would definitely recommend this book.
B009NPK1IO|4.0|. There was slow loading but love the show. Missed most of the 6th season but the finale was great
B008AIGWVA|5.0|My six year old son loves this one.  It gets him laughing a lot.  One thing you should know is that you get a limited number of test tubes to play with and after that you have to pay for more.
1451695195|5.0|If you have any doubts that there is a God this book will totally blow your mind. Eben's story telling of his experience is superb.<br />Enlightening book. Would recommend
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Very cool app. We love it. Great. Good.<br />It's very easy to stay online. Try it, you love. Try try.
B00CFA227C|5.0|This movie my 10 year old and I absolutely enjoyed watching together. Action packed and with clean language couldn't ask for more
B00AA7O6QC|2.0|This film is an excellent example of &#34;violent video game&#34;cinema!The Expendables 2, along with a host of other recent films of a similar nature, have established their own unique genre in which the &#34;total numbification&#34;of the hapless viewer to mindless violence and mayhem is the prerequisite. Avoid this mindless&#34; time sink&#34; and do your laundry instead!<br /><br />  Christopher
0783116934|3.0|The story of this guy and what he did is awesome but it was a cheap film and it shows.
B008GJV2OA|5.0|Dr.Strangelove is a splendid showcase of the film genre &#34;satirical dark comedy&#34;! It demonstrates amply just what a great director,screenplay and actors can accomplish by delivering a true cinematic classic for the ages.Peter Sellers and George C.Scott are standouts in a wonderful cast.The war room scenes are not to be missed and the U.S.Army's assault on the U.S.airbase looks like newsreel footage,it's so realistic.The final scene with former rodeo performer Slim Pickens is so visually indelible,it's iconic.This film is a definite &#34;must see&#34; and a must have in anyone's DVD collection!<br /><br />  Christopher
B005XQLBU4|5.0|this is like a modern game of missle command. I am enjoying it thoroughly and easy because its tapping.  I give it an A+ what more can you ask formerly it up.  thanks for the game
B00ECUX7HC|5.0|I love both of them, but felt for the last few cd's I was missing Kofi, Mike, in favor of Susan. I love Susan, her guitar, and her voice, but just wanted more of a mix. I feel that they have deliverd and formed a cohesive, wonderful coalition. Excellent vocals, Derrek still doin' his thing. It reminds me of the first Derrek Trucks band recording, but made better by Susan Teceschi. I have seen them both in person individually, and togther. LOVE this new offering.
B00DELKA3Y|4.0|btw the 4 stars is for the show itself, lets face it...its \\"Dallas\\" all over again with different accents and Historical elements in the mix as interesting backdrops. A good ol' Soap Opera with excellent acting, nothing too much wrong with that i say! (at least for seasons 1-2, we havent seen season 3 yet, and dont have this boxed set yet :)... BUT will come back and update rating based on the specifics of the set once it's released....questions i DO  have about the set are....<br /><br />Does anyone know whether or not this will contain the UN-cut longer UK versions of the show, or will it contain the cut/shorter versions that appeared on US broadcasts? i presume/hope the Christmas episode is include here as well? answers to the above will determine whether or not i purchase this set.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This is such a unique story - it brings World War II to life in an unexpected way.  The author has done great research into the lives of the two pilots and shows how they come together.  It gives you new appreciation for the Germans who didn't support Hitler and how they lived through the war.  Definitely read this if you enjoy human stories of people dealing with the unbelievable stress of war, and if you are interested in aviation, as well.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|A nice twist to the old school missile command! Love the ability to upgrade missiles and repair buildings..would be cool if there were extra upgrades to work towards.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|love it. very cool graphics I do agree with all the game heads on here as well game on takers and keep up the good work designers.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This is a story line that many people can probably associate with. How people's past affect their everyday lives, how simple things that most of us take for granted are so far beyond those who have never received the love of family.  Christina McKenna takes the reader through the a turmoil of emotions that underlie a seemingly simple life.  A great read that really has you feeling for the characters.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Mahjong  is a fun challenging game for all ages. I look forward to playing a game at the end of a long day.
B008K6HN8I|1.0|Have installed this application and Uninstalled it several times. However, every time I open this application, I get a pop out message saying : \\"You have installed an unofficial version of this application. To ensure your safety, please go to [...] and download the official version\\"<br /><br />All this problems started with the last upgrade of this app in the Amazon Appstore.<br /><br />I have not had any issues with this app before. I have used it on my kindle fire HD and my android phones often and for a long time.  However, on my phones I download this app from Google Play Store. I have not experienced any issues on my phones.
B00640UICA|4.0|I got this a few days ago as the faotd.  At first look I thought it would be good for my kids, but after working through many many levels I know that its for adults.  The game becomes quite difficult and would most likely frustrate a child, however, became a nice challenge for me.<br /><br />The only negative is there should be a hint of some type.  I have reached a level that I just can not solve and one small hint would help greatly.
B006PAV1XO|1.0|Acting and plot...below expectations.  I'm glad I didn't rent this.  At least they didn't treat all adults as bumbling idiots.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I LOVE this game!I can't get my kids OR myself off of this game!if you like temple run, you'll love this game!
B00785P2QC|4.0|This is a great sim city building game!  It is very entertaining and addicting... my kids even enjoy playing it!
B004ZA9HB4|1.0|I got the &quot;full&quot; version last year. Amazon's version is still stuck on 4.65 when Google Play is on something like 5.6 now. Also, my &quot;full&quot; Amazon version shows ads, which makes it no different than the free version. DO NOT BUY IT HERE!<br /><br />The app itself is great and does things other apps can't. I especially like the ability to push content to my XBOX.
B00B935SUY|5.0|A great overall insight into the passion of creating and recording great music.<br />Musicians will really &#34;get it&#34;. I recommend it !
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I will never understand what the hype to this book is.  It is so poorly written that after reading a book written by Grisham he writing  truly disgusted me.  Sad to think this created so much interest.  Would never recommend this book.  Never finished reading it and would never buy the other two.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|looks good and great fun when you get the hang of it. the minions are cute :) the only problem is sometimes  my swipe registers as a jump, and I die :( also, sometimes the tap doesn't register, either.
B001MSMULG|4.0|this is the kind of book that once you start reading it you cannot put it down.  The Gabriel Allon stories are fascinating and very absorbing.  Heck of good reading.
0060594896|5.0|This book has been and continues to be a game changer for my life and the people that i share it with. My 18 year old read success principles  and within a month he obtained 2 part time jobs and was offereed a third one just from applying 5 of the 64 principles!! I recommend this book to any one regardless of age who wants to take their life from where it is to where they want it to be!!!!
0321934318|5.0|Book is very precise and is a good primer to a workshop. It will teach you what you need to know.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|This review is for those that intend to use it outside of USA. using Netflix<br />Before you buy it make sure that you have Netflix service in your country, you will not be able to use a DNS service.  Chromecast is locked to Google DNS service. There is a lot of information on the web about this problem, read before you spend your money.<br />If you have Netflix Latin America the Chromecast will reproduce Latin America programming even if you use a DNS service with the intent of receiving USA programming.<br />You can customize the Chromecast settings such as IP address and DNS, but the DNS will not take effect.
B002LHTRV8|4.0|liked the suspense and twists. Depp is great - loved the setting and old phone ringing in the next plot layer.
B005V2S7FW|5.0|Used it for years and love it. Everyone should have it and use it on all computers at home and work
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I am a voracious reader. Just this summer I have devoured the Matched trilogy, all &#34;Rot and Ruin&#34; books up to this point, Cinder & Scarlet, The first two of the Divergent series, Twisted, Hate List, and others I'm not remembering right now. This isn't to brag; it's to demonstrate how great &#34;The Fault in Our Stars&#34; is. Hands down it is the best stand-alone (not a series) young adult book I've read. It probably makes my top 10 of all time. I can't recommend this enough. If you love to read, this is original enough it will give you one of those &#34;reader's high.&#34; If you're typically not a reader, this book will win you over. Just get it already!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It is an amazing game with great graphics and amazing motion sim only thing is items are very expensive! So it takes a long time to even get new stirrups
B003F3FJQO|3.0|Not sure that I like Book #2. Dashner creates good story, but makes readers more suspicious of ALL the characters. Have to finish series, but may not read anymore of his works. Not worth the anxiety.
0374533555|5.0|Engaging and insightful are the two best words to describe this book. Once I started reading I could not put it down!
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Very addicting.  Wish there was a way to restart the game, but otherwise a fun enhancement of the old classic.
B007TK77QE|5.0|It was as though you were part of each different family - such insight - a book really well worth reading.
B007REV4YI|4.0|Good picture quality. Like Doctor Who, James Bond seems to regenerate himself as time goes on. I'll bet Ian Flemming didn't expect that.
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|This movie was very enjoyable. While the story might have been a bit predictable, I really liked the movie. Tom Cruise and Morgan Freeman are always great. The visuals are striking from the futuristic home to beautiful natural environment. I recommend this film.
B009AY04A8|3.0|Maybe not the most exciting game but fun enough to pass the time. Screen seems super sensitive to touch but penalty not often or big.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Chromecast is the best casting device for the current generation and especially with 3 months its a steal. More apps expected to make it perfect.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|i check this all the time.  i love that I can input other places to see their weather.  so all my favorite vacation spots on on my list.  now when I am stuck in snow, I can see what the weather is like in Vegas or Orlando.
B0093QE37S|5.0|For memorable lines and quotable quotes, this is one terrific movie.  You will be guessing what is about to happen, and mostly, you will guess right.  But it really doesn't matter, cause these are three great actors.
B00CRWJ7VC|5.0|It's  like some books that you are reading for understanding and you start asking questions that get answered as you continue to read.  Instead of focusing in on one timeline or narrow viewpoint, the movie causes one to put out multiple viewpoints simultaneously, irrespective of where they are on the timeline.  This is actually closer, imho, to how what some call &#34;all-that-is&#34; sees things as &#34;happenings&#34;.  The movie tries to move one's viewpoint outside the universe of time, space, matter, energy, and see happenings as you would see them from that viewpoint.  Can you have it?  That's up to the viewer, and I respect that.<br /><br />&#34;Life&#34;, or the games of life do not relate strung out in linear time:  They relate according to the nature of the game, its purposes, and I think that is a more natural order of viewing one's own existences.  Remember, god spoke (i.e., postulated) before anything came into existence.  It's as if he said, &#34;Hmmmm, I wonder how this would play out...&#34; and VOILA! a whole matrix of existences formed on the basis of that &#34;first postulate&#34;.  All for his viewing pleasure.  :-))<br /><br />So life is a web when one steps outside the universe and sees it from a god-self perspective.<br /><br />For us &#34;Flatlanders&#34; it can be disorienting and uncomfortable to watch.  I'm glad I stuck with the movie to the wholeness of it.  Otherwise, it would have sucked eggs.
B0080MPUUK|5.0|Step one: watch Casablanca - terrific movie which bears many viewings.<br />Step two: watch Play It Again Sam - tight Allen sendup which leads to climactic airport tarmac scene<br />What's not to love about this combo?
193700788X|3.0|I picked this book up at my local library. I read the Amazon reviews and I didn't want to waste my money after reading so much negative stuff about this book. I must have missed reading the previous book in the series, but it didn't make much difference because the story from the last book was told again in this book.<br /><br />Overall, it was okay. It's an easy read. It's predictable. Sookie goes to work. Sookie changes clothes. Sookie fixes meals. Sookie has unwanted people coming to her house. Sookie is injured several times. Sookie gets angry with Eric. Nearly every Sup from previous books pays a visit to Sookie at some point in the book. Etcetera.
B00A285OOW|5.0|I enjoyed this as much as The Other Boleyn Girl and was engaged from the first page in the story.
B000YMM3CC|4.0|As romance movies go these days, it's better than most. Good screenplay. Touching. James Garner did a fine job in his role.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|This game reminds me of the 80's version.  The UFO's I don't remember.  Good Time Killer.  So far, I think it's a good game.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|it is an entertaining book. if you are looking for the meaning of life, you are not going to find it here. but the hunger games is definitely very entertaining.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|The game is fun and the kids love it, but the order of the levels n missions doesn't really make logical sense.
B00723NWJE|3.0|I always like Nora Jones, but this sounds so much like her 1st. album. Was a little disappointed, will still enjoy listening.
B0052UYJDC|5.0|Thankful here! Very nice wisdom. This book helps you to organize, gives us clean neat tidy spacious place, which is healthy for most people including me, gave me big freedom started to focus on important things with more time and spacious room avairable. Truly great nice experience.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|Wonderful prelude...cannot wait for the next part of Bilbo's story<br />The trolls are truly gruesome and the dwarves  wonderfully fierce.
B005XQLBU4|3.0|its okay. its not super great but its entertaining enough. I don't like the graphics. they are not that good.
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|I really liked this movie a lot it was very interesting, funny, and different. This is much more different and almost feels like it's own genre in the way it plays out!
B008XG1X18|4.0|easy to share stuff to my &quot;look&quot; folder. nice comment room, i have enough space to post lyrics. excellent app.
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|Good app finds things quickly on kindle fire MUCH more quickly than doing the \\"web\\" search. I only wish that when I find my site that it could be saved to my favorites ! If anyone knows how pls let me know... Thanks!
B005XQLBU4|3.0|it is a fun game. it should have more options on upgrades. please add a turn off audio setting. i see a lot of bad rates for containing malware. i have ti check.
B00181JGI2|5.0|Have and will continue to watch this movie again and again. So classic, so good. Highly recommended. Next time I should probably just buy it.
B001FB55LC|5.0|This is a gritty one, not easy to watch but great performances by Gyllenhaal, Portman, and Maguire make this one worth watching.
B00ECUARO8|1.0|This movie was slow and boring. Predictable. I usually love the cast members, but even they couldn't make this movie interesting
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Cassandra Clare did equally remarkable work on this book as well as the entire series. I could not even wait for the hardcover book to arrive from Amazon after I finished the first and downloaded it through the Kindle app on my phone.  I cannot wait for book six to become available in March 2014.  And if you love the series as much as I do, do yourself a favor and DO NOT watch the movie, it is Terrible!!!! Have fun with the books!!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I read this book two weeks after we lost our dog. I know it was no coincidence considering it is our next book for our book club!!! The timing was perfect. I always use to say \\"silver\\" understands, I just wish he could speak. Well, now I believe he really did. Thank you for a wonderful book, it is one of the best I have read in a very long time.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|It really is a good game.  Reminds me a lot of Missle Command back in the eighties.  Fun game.  We will see what happens after five days but for now it really is a lot of fun!
B000ANVPPQ|5.0|McLintock is one of John Waynes very very best movies and put Maureen  O'Hara in and its tops  This is over and over watch movie
B00E8JTSVG|5.0|After reading \\"Beyond Bridalveil Fall\\", I jumped straight into \\"Beyond Oria Falls\\". I loved that we get to see things from a few different points of view this time around, and we're given even more insight into the magical creatures. I've always been a big fan of books that delve into the idea of being one with nature. A new discovery carries the characters into the past. The relationship with Grey Wolf also has its own important role. If you haven't read book 1, I'd suggest beginning there since it was awesome, but I don't think this book would have any problem standing on its own. Another great read for fantasy lovers.<br /><br />**As with most of my reviews, I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review**
B00AU15HPC|5.0|This is now one of my favourite albums. I'm not very good at doing music reviews, I just like what I like, and can't really go into technicalities, but if you like thoughtful lyrics delivered with a melodious and articulate male voice then you will probably love this album, I certainly do.
B005JTAP4S|5.0|Young or old, if you're looking for a good fairy tale then look no further. 10 year old Peter stumbles into a magical world and sets out on a fantastical adventure.<br />With ghosts and Vampires, I'd say this book is best suited for anyone over the age of 11. An awesome new world created by words will leave you feeling as if you're reading the next Alice in Wonderland. It has that same dark vibe. Check this one out.<br />**As with most of my reviews, I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.**
0552998877|4.0|I read this book because I wanted to read the whole series and I only like to read series in order and I could not find this book anywhere else.  I like this author and will read more books by her in the future.
1118488768|5.0|This book was recommended to me by an SEO website and I'm so glad I decided to read it!<br /><br />I'm working on an eMarketing website right now and this has already given me so many ideas and tools to help me market myself with.<br /><br />It gives in-depth SEO strategy, social media strategy, video marketing and infographic information. It also gives general marketing examples, including content marketing.<br /><br />Thanks for writing this book David!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Played this on Facebook, prefer it on my kindle! LOL Best made bingo app, lots of rooms, things to collect and well laid out, awesome. A must have if you enjoy bingo, even more so if you've not played before :) go on download now!
0312330855|5.0|I provided this book to a young student who wanted to be a veterinarian after high school. It was a book used to help inspire her to follow her dreams.
0131480057|4.0|This book covers all the nuts and bolts of system administration as well as the industry and career.  Green computing?  Check!  Politics?  Check!  AIX? Check!  Once I get further along I may upgrade this to 5 stars!
B004R63MWQ|5.0|Tron is an amazing film. I used this film in the classroom to discuss the changing of the film industry, how cinematography helps assist in understanding how films come to life. We discussed how changes from the first film to the second film made leaps in how both movies were designed.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I was unable to get this item to work with my system.  Surprised it would not respond to my kindle fire.  Will try again when I have enough time to work with it.  Would not recommend it to anyone.  Connected it through my AV receiver.  Finally got it to interact with a neighbors laptop.  I had thought either my kindle fire or my iphone would manage it.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|It isn't any different than computer. Just little smaller. I really like it. I think it is harder to complete the rooms from a tablet.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Extraordinary performances, good plot, entertaining and educational. It's a wonderful recreation of a whole era in England. Can't wait for season 4.
1594481717|5.0|Purchased this book for an advanced technology class.  It gave me some thought provoking ideas and most importantly it was an easy and quick read.  I ordered the book late but was able to catch up immediately with course syllabus and read the entire book. Easy A.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|As good as the first season, a little more melodramatic, but entertaining. I spent a whole weekend watching the season 2 and I think it has been a very well spent time.
B00BN3DPQ4|4.0|I'll admit that I bought the movie out of a sense of nostalgia.  I wanted to see Arnold's return after his foray into politics, and I'm happy to say I wasn't disappointed.<br /><br />Of course the picture required some suspension of disbelief.  That's a given in the genre.  The good guys never miss and the bad guys never hit, for instance.  By the way, I lived in the desert for many years, and there were many cornfields within a few miles of my home.  All it takes is irrigation water, and I'm sure they have some in Arizona.<br /><br />The new, old Arnold was fun.  I'll be looking forward to his next one.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|My iPhone became damaged and rendered unusable due to sweat during my workouts. The liquid seeped into the headphone jack and charger slot at the bottom of the phone. When I purchased my new phone LifeProof case consistently got rave reviews from colleagues and friends. It has been all that it is marketed to be. Other \\"like\\" styles are too bulky. This is streamlined, airtight with a screen that fits flat to the phone so touch is sensitive as if nothing were covering it. The only feature I do not like is having to remove the little screw on top to plug in the adapter that fits on headphones. It is not convenient but until it can be re engineered, I must say, in my opinion, this product is the best on the market. In addition, LifeProof personnel answer the phone when customers call with questions. Consumers do not have to jump through multiple prompts to reach a representative. Great customer service and warranty benefits the customer.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Not a lot of ads, but I worry about how far I advance without having to pay big money to so do.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Great fun, loved the whole series. Worth the amazon instant sub just to see it - we want more! More!
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|shipping was fast. case was a little beat up but the cds play perfect. ozzy is getting older but hes still got it!
B002M5E2DW|5.0|I already read the book, but I wanted to downloaded to my kindle, so that I can resort to it at times when I need encouragement. Easy read. Love this book.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|It's a very entertaining game that will keep you busy.  I only started this game a few minutes ago and I know I'm hooked already.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|I am a fan of MJ. I like having all of his greatest hits in this album, and the new ones. RIP MJ.
1582701709|5.0|This book gives a great outlook on how to create more positive thoughts and feelings! I highly suggest it to everyone!
B0015XHQTY|5.0|Tyne Daly really made this movie move.  I loved her performance.  The plot was evil enough to require the services of Dirty Harry and his Model 29 SW revolver.  Put it all together and the flick &#34;rocked&#34;.<br /><br />Hal
B003O86FMW|5.0|The Hunger Games Trilogy is the only trilogy/series I have been able to read through multiple times without becoming bored or fatigued. It never fails to keep me on edge regardless of whether or not I know every detail of the plot. If only I could say the same for the movie(s). Not only has it been a great experience reading the book with friends, but it has exposed me to other great authors with similar writing styles and other post-apocalyptic/war themed books.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Very entertaining game. Especially when you get it for free. Not overly difficult puzzles so the game is very enjoyable!
B00A8ECU24|3.0|Its a fun game and slightly addictive, but one its like a facebook game(other then the fact that you can connect to facebook...), to do really good things you have to pay cash money. Like you cant get rarity unless you have 30 gems (and it takes you forever to even get close to that many) and scotaloo and a few others can only be got if you get hearts, that you cant get unless you are connected to a social media and have friends to play with you. that's not even the worst part, every time the damn thing updates it erases everything I did and I have to start from the beginning. This is the 4th time its done this and now it wont even let me in at all. I just want to play a my little pony game without worrying that the next time I log into it it might of started over!
B00DDXJRJG|3.0|The APP does what it is supposed to do pretty well on my KFire HD-7. What I find so frustrating is that it will not stay running in the background, so that while it is running you are not able to do anything else!!!  Let's say you are listening to music on Pandora.... you hear a tune you want to either vote on or look at some liner-notes, etc. Well you cant do anything like that until you shut down the APP, go to Pandora, cast your vote, go back to home, restart the APP, continue listening. Pandora, or the Kindle Music Player, can run in the background of anything from surfing the web to reading a book. This EQ App should be able to as well. Also it would be nice if it had a Left-Right Balance slider. Simple. As I am hearing impaired in my left ear, and only get very distorted sound from that ear, I would like to be able to shift the balance over to my good ear, to clean up the sound. (This is a factor only when I am using headphones or ear buds, of course.)  As for volume control, I'm not sure how the Kindle volume control buttons interact with the App's volume slider button. When the App is on, you would think it would be in total control of volume, but the Kindles volume buttons can also be manipulated to affect the volume while the app is on. I found that maximizing both produces a rather distorted sound.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this app! When I am watching tv I get bored during commercials, so I play minion rush! It is soooooooooooooooooooooooooo fun!
B00BC24NT4|1.0|And somehow the story line is same-old same-old and oh-so-veddy British. Jonh le Carre redundant.  Tiresome.  Boring.  I didn't get past first third of the book.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|I love all these brain games. Really gets your brain working. I would recommend this brain teaser to anyone, young or old.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|I love this movie as well as my 5 & 6 year grandsons..<br /><br />For me it was fun picking out all the monsters...<br /><br />However, the boys did question why the jello guy was a monster... LOL<br /><br />The BLOB was before there time...<br /><br />I can't wait to see it again..
B005EGXTEE|5.0|The book gives a lot more detial of the scene of the film. How panam came to be. I love how the hunger games shows catnis as a normal girl, then catching fire she shows the suffering of post traumqtic stress disorder and the moking jay shows someone who is full blown crazy, completely different from the girl in the first book.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|sweet one of the best games I have ever played for free atho you can buy stuff for 50 bucks that's Mindanao crazy
B005EGXTHG|5.0|Read the whole trilogy in a week. Catching fire is a great demonstration of the affect of  post traumatic stress disorder.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|Star Trek Into Darkness.<br /><br />Movie was a kick but adventure Kirk shoots from the hip and is amazing Watch Amazing. Really is an amazing movie.
B005EGXTL2|5.0|I saw the movie before i read the book, loved the movie and had heard the book was better so i thought id give it a go. The book gives a whole new insight to the film. The themes are explored in so much more detail.  I love how in the first book Catnis is a normal girl and through the trilogy she changes.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was better than the movie with vivid details ! The author really did a great job writing this book !!!
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|When I got this game I thought it would be cool to shoot ww 2 guns for a change its awesome you need this game
B0097EWK3A|4.0|Great game.  Keeps you thinking.  Have enjoyed playing and I have encouraged friends to download this game and play for themselves.
B005COO1X6|4.0|Gets your juices flowing early on. If you are a King fan, as I am, it was a welcome antidote to the uncut \\"The Stand\\" that I just finished. Brief, fun and bold. Give it a shot.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|What is the code for level 1 to open the thing in the wall you use for the Sri driber
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|I enjoyed it overall though it was a bit long.  My wife fell asleep on the couch.  I recommend it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a good app and its challenging and time consuming if you need something fun to do. It's well put together and has great graphics.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Watched it twice.  it kept my attention through the whole movie.  the suspense was great without all that typical Hollywood blockbuster special effects.
B009R659L8|5.0|Have always enjoyed Mary Higgins Clark's books. She has the ability to tell a great story with many surprising twists. Truly a fun read!
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|Enjoyed it.  had to watch it twice to fully understand it.  Tom and Hally did a good job in particular.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|awsome game. whole family can enjoy hope the game remains on. helps my son problem solve and patience.) helps me to relax
B00DH1G7DS|3.0|The app is easy to use but there are more user friendly Sudoku providers out there.<br />Not bad but not the best.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|Learned a lot about the Eagles I did not know.  Glad I made the purchase.  Have recommended this to several friends
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Fun to interact with your horse, and compete in the horse shows. Items to dress up horse are expensive and all the cool outfits cost gems.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Simple yet updated version of an old classic. Great for quick entertainment when you only have a few moments to play.
B00ECU2RGY|3.0|I got confused on the story line and who and why the other survivors where on earth.  What was the lie?
0345803450|2.0|I started out liking this book and thought it was going to be a page turner but about 75 pages into it I just found that I was not into it and did really care to finish it.  So moved on to something else.
B000IMM3XW|4.0|It's a good movie which introduces the world of comic book heroes.<br />I got this through the instant view.  It was good quality and I found it enjoyable to watch through my ipad.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|I think this game is fun if you are bored.  I hope they bring back firefly I miss that Tv show.  but yea the game rocks
B00DCX08MW|3.0|You're going to upgrade this app for it to be worth it. Wish it had some tutorial since I can't seem to get pass some of the campaigns.
B003U4UPTE|5.0|It is great to be able to go back and revisit one of the best TV series of all time. I have discovered a lot of details that I missed the 1st time around.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|A better blast from the past... middle command only better... great upgrades and fast pace... I definitely recommend this game. Five stars
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Fast, fun read.  Really enjoy Ricks books.  He weaves a story with the tight detail and PAC for an entertaining book.
B00933JL0A|4.0|This is a great game!!!!!!!! Would give it 5 stars but it's too repetitive. Love the graphics and the music.
B005XQLBU4|3.0|The game is pretty fun, but the upgrades are limited. If it came with more defensive measures I would give it a better rating
B009AY04A8|4.0|This game is okay the only thing is they talk to much the items a pretty easy to find there maybe others who would enjoy it better thanks Thomas a.
B001NLKZUA|4.0|Really enjoyed The City Of Ashes and can't wait to start on the next one.  Very fast reading.  Couldn't put it down!
B005OT2YVA|5.0|Definitely worth watching over and over again. Childhood carttoons come to life with this rich in graphic and surround sound content.
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|Liked the Guns and action but it missed something... oh that's it TALENT :) haha I had low expectations and wasn't disappointed.. :)
B001VFTYW8|4.0|I am reading all the Scarpetta books and can't wait to get to the next one when I finish the last one.  I have enjoyed Patricia for years and will keep following her.  These books make you think and remember what has already happened to link to the present I really like that kind of book where you have to think a bit.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|The many different stories that intertwine provided an overall great story. I was sad to see it end. This book was great!
B0095P31L6|4.0|enjoy anything johnny depp does.  interesting plot line and love the characters...and i do mean characters.  would definitely recommend this movie
B00000J2PH|4.0|This is Carol King at her best; highly recommended for Boomers or anybody who like to listen to good vocals.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Brings back the old days of the Atari but more updated. I only gave it 4 stars because I haven't played it much yet. I'm sure it'll ask for money at some point.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Can't wait to see what this can do in six months time. well worth the money !! especially with netflix included
B00A285OOW|4.0|This was well written from the first person perspective. The plot was intricate due to the many players. However, she lost me many times due to all of the &#34;boys&#34; who kept popping up, and the various lineages of the boys. It was much too drawn out over the boys. although I read it in ebook format, I finally resorted to going to a history book to figure out who all the players really were. Phillipa never got around to telling us that the White Queen was the mother of Henry the VIII. There were references to a Virgin Queen (in caps) at the very end of the book, but that was the closest she got. The characters would have all made more SENSE if she'd made connections clearer. I'm an avid student of this time period, but she lost me at points - - maybe because it was so drawn out chasing all of these boys. She chased the depression of Henry so thoroughly and the imaginary boys.
B008CP6RWU|5.0|It's a short game, but completely enthralling and well worth playing again. It's the perfect game for taking two hours out of your life in order to calm down and feel zen. It evokes emotions like music, and the gameplay is so clever and intuitive that the gameplay itself evokes different emotions at different times in the story. Beautiful, collaborative (or not) and encouraging of exploration, I loved every minute of it.
B006OAB3ME|5.0|What a refreshing CD!  Paul McCartney does an excellent job on this CD!  As a Beatles fan, Paul always had a unique way of expressing himself.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a very fun game; addicting. If you like collecting items and dodging obstacles, you will enjoy this game. Plus, who doesn't love the minions?
B008FSCNTK|4.0|Although we are avid Diana Krall fans, this was a little disappointing.  Diana is a jazz crooner and her talent is superb..... more jazz please.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|The most amazing features to cost ratio product Google has ever made. Works with no issues and only going to get more features as time goes on.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I was captiveted by the characters. Very real, yet so twisted. Great read for anyone who likes mysteries. Do you know people like these?
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Sure YouTube works on it, but casting from the compute is a lost cause, too much latency.  I even replaced my router with a state of the art high speed AC 1750 router and when I try to cast Amazon Prime videos from Chrome there is just too much latency.
B009AY04A8|5.0|Just downloaded this as a free app of the day.  I am loving this game,  it tells a story as you are playing along and I am huge fan of Pirate stuff. Give it a try, if you love hidden object games.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Great game! It really took me back! The upgrade system is a little simple but fun. One should be able to upgrade the city and stuff, but that's OK
B00BP29SAA|5.0|I am not fond of this app, but the kids seem to like it and that is what matters. I don't see where it has a lot of learning to it, but the kids do have to use some logic to decide what to do next. But hey it's a kid app, and the kids enjoy it.............
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Thanks for creating an game I never want to put down. Is perfect not to easy not to hard. Always has a new challenge.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|It good at play time and wasting time Mindanao bring me back to the old Qatari days with my friends
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Not only is this is a wonderful read, it is a great example of how kindness can spread & envelope everyone with consistency.  I  love how it was written through so many viewpoints
B0018O4YT0|5.0|A very underrated film. Rufus Sewell is excellent, and the story keeps you engaged. Interesting to see Keifer Southerland in the role he plays.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Ok, but game is much too short. It was fun while it lasted. Need to add a few more levels soon.
B0045DO8II|5.0|I saw The Outlaws in Lubbock, Texas in the very early 80s.  Molly Hatchet was the opener.  It's a concert I will never forget.  Green Grass and High Tides lasted over 20 minutes.  What a show!
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|The zealot<br /><br />This book is extremely well researched and well written.  It is a very interesting point of view backed up by historic scholarship.
0345495004|5.0|Typically when I finish a book, I start a new one within the day. No so with Loving Frank... the closer I got to the end, the slower I read because I didn't want it to be over. And after I finished two weeks ago, I immediately got four more books and Ken Burn's DVD about FLW and Mamah, because I just can't bear to leave the world I found myself in. Much has to do with Nancy Horan's fluid and magical writing--the author has a wonderful talent for pulling the reader into the story. When Mamah and Frank are sitting in a car hashing out the future of their affair, I felt like I was huddled in the back seat. Full disclosure: my grandparents lived in Oak Park, Ill. and that fact I'm familiar with many streets and neighborhoods in the first half surely enhanced my enjoyment. Regardless, this is a fascinating look at forbidden romance between two married people who find mutual passion and respect, each leaving their family to be together. Mamah is an educated middle-class housewife who finds herself in a marriage of convenience, Frank a brilliant up-and-coming architect who feels neglected by a wife who keeps punching out baby after baby, and the six kids take up all her energy. How does a woman choose between &#34;true love&#34; and her children? How does Frank deal with the blow to his career from the ensuing scandal, that follows them all the way to Europe? Mamah adores the Italian countryside and Frank promises to build her a home in a place just as beautiful, resulting in Taliesin, his estate in Wisconsin. They move in in 1911 before construction is even complete, sleeping in a bedroom with no glass in the windows, and by Christmas reporters are knocking on the door there, too. But it's close enough to Chicago for Mamah's children to visit, and for Frank to commute to his projects there. Things seem to be working out for them at last... but alas, it's not to be. The ending is so horrifically shocking that one not familiar with the history of Taliesin could accuse the author of making it up to be sensationalistic, yet, truth really is stranger than fiction. I looked it up on Wikipedia to discover, &#34;Oh my god, this actually did happen!&#34;  Loving Frank is masterfully researched and beautifully written, and now, even weeks after reading it, I am still haunted by &#34;what ifs.&#34;  If you read one historical novel this year, let it be this one!
B005HEFB6M|4.0|This is cool because it shows the early warp speeds of 4.5, the first human transportation, etc.<br />IT moves a little slowly sometimes

B006PZBR8S|4.0|I would have given it 5 stars, but the bad language prevented me from allowing my children to watch it.  Otherwise, the whole family could have enjoyed it.

B000I186FW|5.0|Complicated themes, no matter where you stand. A people should be ever mindful of those who lead them. When the media &#34;seems&#34; to be controlled, it probably is. When the government &#34;seems&#34; too intrusive, it probably is.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This thing is awesome! It needs more apps like amazon Instant video, hbogo, and huluplus, but I love it. Netflix, google play, and YouTube stream flawlessly from my phone. The chromecast is easy to set up and a dream to use.

B00005N6KG|5.0|This is an excellent head set.  This style is very hard to find.  They are excellent for working out or running.<br /><br />The only problem was with the Seller.  I was not able to track my shipment, the response was this information is unavailable.

B009DCOU9S|4.0|Enjoyed playing this game, a little challenging, but not so difficult. A little less dialogue<br />gue would be an improvement for future games.
B0055OK2T0|4.0|As I expect the performances were amazing.  the plot is simple and ended being a romantic story.  The photography was impeccable and beautiful.

B003G4W49C|3.0|The book was a little difficult to understand at times but overall a very interesting edge of your seat kind of book...i am glad i got the chance to read this book :)
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love this game The only thing I don't like is how much horses are like you start out with one horse but the next cheapest is 6000 but other than that it's a pretty gr8 app :)
B000FC146C|5.0|I have read these books as they came out and have read them several times since. The amount of research that must have gone into it is extraordinary. And the story just grabs you and takes you through time.Even if you just enjoy a good story, this is a series of books for you.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a must have game it is hard but worth it see how many levels you can get by with ease

B00DB31Y3U|3.0|Some good obstacles but too slow for my taste-I like a game that has these shoot 'em up rockets and all but don't want to battle controls either.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love this series so much! Watched all of the previous seasons over the summer to prepare for the upcoming Season 4!
B00CXVX1OQ|4.0|This little baby is a blast.Could've been a ton better IF they get rid of that STUPID battle thingy at the end of a fight. If ya need a decision then let 'em fight another round. Graphics are dynamite.
1416955070|1.0|Obviously this is one situation where one shouldn't judge a book by its cover. The compelling book covers in this series unfortunately enticed me to try out the first book. Notwithstanding the author's intent to market a teenage audience, this novel isn't even good reading, let alone appropriate, for a young adult. It is full of worn out clichés, hackneyed plot lines, vulgar innuendos, implausible violence, and shallow characters that cause, not only, an indifference in the reader, but an incessant irritation. Rather than being fascinated by the story, I was frustrated with slogging through the petty romantic trysts of a young girl who should have been thinking of something else other than who liked her, who didn't, and who wanted to have sex with whom. And as far as the gratuitously violent action scenes, it simply gets to the point where one is always saying, \\"Been there, and done that,\\" not once, but over and over again. Finally, in the author's attempt to build the tension in a stale climax at the end of the book, she only succeeds in unnecessarily increasing the number of pages until I just wanted to be finished. I really found nothing pleasantly entertaining about this book, much less inspiring or redeeming. If this is the empty-headed nonsense the youth are reading today, I suggest their parents help them find something a little more meaningful. One redeeming point of the book was that I, at least,didn't waste my time and money seeing the movie after finishing the book. Thank goodness!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a awesome game  I love e it  I have five words to describe it  cool , nice,awesome , wow ,perfect
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Took me awhile to get into it, but once I was, I was hooked.  The performance and scenery are fantastic.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|It is inspriring, that somedody writes about Jesus, while he is not a follower (or the opposite) and tries to place Him simply in accepted history. It furnishes a broad context of His live, deeds and convictions(?). Even religious innovators must also be seen from this angle.
B004ZQBP22|4.0|We ordered the clean version, which still doesn't remove but a couple words.  I never expected it to clean up very well, though, since it's dance music for adults.  My son is 9 and has heard almost all swear words at this point, so I gave in and bought it.  I like it too.  It really gets you moving!
1416972242|5.0|This is a totally amazing book. Definitely read it. Glad I found it here way cheaper than the book store
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I was somewhat hesitant to purchase this book, but decided that the reviews were too good to ignore.  As I began to read, I kept telling myself, &#34;I'll read just one more chapter before I put it down&#34;.  The end of each chapter, however, left me dying to keep reading. This is an excellent read. The character development is amazing and the authors style was entertaining and relatable. She put into words what many of us only think. I can't wait to read more of Moriarty's work.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Sanderson has made the perfect ending for one of the greatest fantasy sagas ever written. He ties up all of the loose ends. Thank you, Brandon.
B005NPBTQ6|4.0|I had the pleasure of listening to Ryan perform these songs at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in downtown Los Angeles. It is home to the LA Philharmonic and is acoustically perfect...  The song helps me to relive this show. I particularly like Wait For You, Chains of Love and I love you but I Don't know What to Say.
B004G606K8|3.0|I read this book originally more than 20 years ago. It is exactly as I remember it...a great into fantasy for the young adult that may not be ready for lotr or asoiaf. It does not try to be something out is not. I can honestly say that I enjoyed it.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Loved the book and the writing but the ending disappointed me. Otherwise it was a good read. enjoyed the book.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|This knife is made to last. The steel is VERY thick, and the edge is extremely sharp. The knife is full tang, and the back serves double duty as a pounding tool. I have heard the kydex sheath tends to dull the blade, but i made my own leather sheath for it, so no big deal.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Slow to load but overall a fun game. who doesn't love the minions?  Instructions simple.  Easy to play. Good variety.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This thing is great. Only hold back is lack of software for it at the start, Netflix and Youtube. Will be great soon.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Slow going but picked up. Liked the zombie story without all the Gore. Gave a \\"life\\" to the characters. Definitely recommend this book to zombie movie/book lovers.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|I found this show on amazon and thought I'd give it a try - I'm hooked!! The dialog between all of the characters is well written and interesting
0385349947|5.0|I am deeply grateful for the courage, eloquence, and drive of Mrs. Sheryl Sandberg! Reading this book felt like Sheryl and I were best friends and she was writing about our shared secrets. I had no idea another woman had experienced these thoughts and feelings in the workplace, let alone most of us. The not speaking up, the fear of sounding unqualified to give my opinion on a topic, taking the corner seat away from the table, down playing accomplishments, inability to gracefully receive compliments, forcing a mentor relationship, and so on... that was me. The advice given in this book are both timely and priceless. I thank Sheryl for her transparency, frankness, and vulnerability. Thank you for being bold!! This book has certainly impacted my life. Thank you!!! I couldn't put the book down.
B0064W639K|1.0|Mobile device owners beware. This title is not supported on all Kindle platforms. Kindle for PC and Windows 8 ARE NOT SUPPORTED.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Game play is great. No ads. Enjoyable!<br />This is one phenomenal game! Level 5 for a review. Needs to make repair points doubke
B00AZMFK3K|2.0|I was fooled by a trailer emphasizing the imaginative first half of the movie, with new lifeforms, cool scenery, and a villain who seems to have mixed good and evil motives.  But the writers couldn't seem to figure where to go with it, so they went into ever more unbelievable zipping through fields of debris and narrow escapes, giving the same unimaginative end to Khan for the 3rd time, and relying on the same tired \\"I have to go into the reactor to save everyone\\" theme with some hand-waving revival.<br /><br />All of the wonder of encountering new and different lifeforms, higher or lower, who might behave in unexpected ways is lost from the Start Trek franchise.  There is also a pointed hopelessness that has crept in about the future of man, as it supposes there is no peace to be made with any advanced human type and all are to be destroyed.<br /><br />Most of the glowing reviews are probably written by people who did not see the original series in the context of the 1960s, who don't realize that we were in fact locked in a death battle with the Klingon-like Soviet Empire, and that Star Trek of that era prophesied a hopeful end to the madness of mutual destruction - an alternate ending that 20 years later played out in the real world.<br /><br />Hopefully this version of Trek is not as prophetic.  It makes clear that we are our own worst enemy as [warning, spoiler] Kirk faces off against the evil admiral.  After that the plot goes down a rathole.  I gave it a couple of stars for the nice red jungle at the beginning and the questions it raises about our security apparatus.  The movie surely was complete before Snowden, but it seems to predict him.
B00992CF6W|5.0|First download 1mobile market then look at the left hand then pull it down it should say ready to download or something then update

B005XQLBU4|5.0|Great game, so far but I'm only on night 8, pretty fast paced when the nights roll on. I got the game for free and that's how it should be
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Wow! What a fantastic story! I loved this book. It drove me crazy that they couldn't be together. Finished this and slammed in a day!
B00BXKKNFS|1.0|It did block ads, but caused other problems. Had to uninstall from my phone when I could not resolve them.
B00003CXBK|5.0|This is a movie that i have always loved but had never bought for myself its a great piece of work that was wonderfully done.
0375869026|4.0|I'm not sure how this novel is usually presented, as far as genre/target audience. It reads like YA -- but the first good-sized chunk is first person from the POV of August, as he starts fifth grade. The usual \\"wisdom\\" is that kids and teens don't like to \\"read down,\\" but prefer protagonists their age or slightly older. My teenaged daughter had heard of the book and plans to read it, but didn't consider it YA, MG or anything of the sort. None of which really matters, as long as one dives in and keeps reading. This is a very good book.<br /><br />All the POV characters are essentially likable, and none are dull. In particular, none are boringly perfect, though (in the nonphysical sense) August may come close. Somehow, however, he avoids being a Mary Sue.<br /><br />There is a good balance between ups and downs, heartache and affirmation -- until the ending, which has a Hallmark Hall of Fame feel. On the whole, I recommend this book to all comers.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Just like the other Miyazaki films its a great movie and story fit for all ages and people. i highly recommend everyone see it at least a couple of times.
B00011KHTM|5.0|I have a 2006 iMac with a screen that is going bad. One third of the screen is permanently grayed out to the point where you can't see your display, and the rest of the display has ugly whitish lines going through it. Image quality is getting fuzzier. I wasn't sure how much it would cost to have my iMac's screen professionally replaced, and I needed a quick fix. I bought a small TV that was on sale, a VGA cable, and this Mini DVI to VGA adapter. I had no problems with physical setup.<br /><br />What you have to do in this case (after the new monitor is hooked up to your Mac via this adapter) is go into your Mac's System Preferences &#62; Displays &#62; Arrangement and click the box for &#34;Mirror Displays&#34;. Your original display has to be functioning well enough for you to at least get into your system preferences and click this box because otherwise the second display will show your open apps but not your desktop. It took me about two hours to get the resolution set up properly because my old squarish display and the new widescreen display have very different resolutions. But once that was done I was satisfied. I cut out some thick paper and taped it over the old display so having the dual images wouldn't bother me.<br /><br />I can't tell you how durable this adapter is. A lot of reviewers have said that it can't stand a lot of moving around. In my case I am using it for a permanent desktop display, and I will only unplug it when I move to another house. I will update this review if the thing ever craps out on me, but after a few weeks I have not yet had a single issue.<br /><br />If you are not sure whether a Mini DVI port is what your apple computer has I recommend a free reference app from the Mac App Store called Mactracker. I think sometime around 2007 or 2008 Apple switched to a different kind of (smaller) display port that this adapter will not fit.

B000VRITM8|5.0|Once upon a time in a studio far away mostly lost in the hazy mists of time a legend was born. A must have for all jazz fans and/or anyone who just likes great music.

0062014536|3.0|Lauren Oliver's message is that there is no such thing as happy endings, only that life goes on. I'm sorry, but that is the whole reason I read small teen novels. Instant gratification. That smile I'll carry all day from a beautiful story. Are you disappointed about Alex popping in at the end of book 2? Well spoiler alert, you'll still feel the same and have a million questions by the end of this book. The first 2, I would give four or five stars. The idea of love being illegal is a fabulous idea. Book three leaves much to be desired and I wish this wasn't the end of Lena and Alex's story. Overall disappointing.
B009AY04A8|4.0|This is the 2nd part but still stands on it's own.  Jack is given a box and does not know what is in it and goes to different people to find help.  Good hidden object games.  Good scenes and is fun.

B000A59PMO|4.0|more and more as we work our way through it. Veronica is a saddened teen, perplexed by her mother's disappearance from her life and not intimidated by the powers-that-be in her school or community. She's borders on smart-mouthed adolescent, but finds ways to help her peers who are less fortunate. The acting and script-writing are both good.

B005XQLBU4|4.0|Good controls on kindle fire.  Same as old arcade game.  Good time waster but a touch repetitive after a while.  However as the faotd it was worth installing.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best game I have ever played in a while it kicks major butt I love it
B00ECU34ZM|2.0|I liked the idea of Oblivion and the look of the whole movie. However, there were several holes in the story line. If this &#34;being&#34; or &#34;alien life form&#34; was so intelligent why didn't it know about the characters, Jack's, hiding place? Why did it not recognize that the extra cargo that Jack brought on bored with him was a male and not the female they were looking for? I could go on...but I won't. It was visually cool movie just not the strongest of story lines. Two Stars!
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|Ok<br /><br />Nice one for wasting time. Don't like the fact that one has to spend real money for getting crystals.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Thing I loved:<br />* Really make a smart tv out of your not so smart tv<br />* Netflix and Youtube casting work great in high resolution and not frame drops. The way your phone functions as the remote is great.<br />* Small compact solution<br />* GREAT - price point. Even better if you managed to snag the 3 months of free Netflix<br /><br />Things I wish to see improved:<br />* Tab casting - the real feature I got this device for, is not very good at casting streaming videos - tremendous lag and frame drops. I hear this can be improved by lowering the frame rate but I haven't tried this myself.<br />* Cannot tab case from Android at this time, only your laptop.<br />* Initial load time is a little longer than optimal for loading netflix/youtube videos but its tolerable for now<br />* There need to be more apps that support casting. In fact, android should just come with a global 'cast' button that casts the display of your phone to your TV.<br /><br />I'm positive that most of the things in the needs improvement list are going to be addressed soon enough. This device has great potential.
006220629X|3.0|The Shadow of the Wind is my all-time favorite book and I've recommended it to everyone.  I liked Angel's Game and also found it to be wonderfully written, though not as satisfying a story as Shadow of the Wind.  But Prisoner of Heaven??  Why did CRZ bother?  Fermin was always an amusing, clever character, but to base an entire book on him?  POH really seems to be \\"filler\\"...a sort of bridge between SOTW and AG, and totally unnecessary.  I still loved the beautifully descriptive prose, but ultimately felt let down at the end.  Such a short, inconclusive book...is that all there is??
B007RCJNDE|5.0|A Memory Of Light<br />A fantastic finale to the series. It is the type of book, that if I wasn't reading it, I was thinking about it.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Unable to get it to work. Efforts to seek online support related to the issues I found were even more frustrating. So here I sit with a piece of hardware doing me no good.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|Its teaches you a lot about the game and it is fun , but some of the controls are weird and you really need the full game to appreciate it.
B000SEI230|5.0|I loved the goodness of people this. Book represented through the change that one good person can bring  to so many other
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|The game never worked wasted time downloading it save yourself some time and steer clear of this one these guys are for movies only lol
159463176X|5.0|A wonderful writer and he never disappoints, but it is truly a gut wrenching story.  After reading the first chapter I had to put it aside for two weeks before I could start reading it again.  If you ever have a day filled with self pity this book will cure it!
B003WJQ74E|5.0|It was a gift for my son, who read it and then I read it, then my wife read it and then we got the movie. OMG we enjoyed it.
B005OTGS08|5.0|Sean Bean at His best. Great Movie based the True British Commandos that carried out raids towards the End of WW11. Check out the Extras for more True story. Very Good Movie !! Keeper on Blu Ray. Set in Winter in  WW11 in Norway.
B002ZG976U|5.0|All I can stay is excellent movie. It is worth having as we watch it so far eleven times.  A must have.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Almost every other app on my device from that time has been deleted and replaced multiple times, but this app never seems to get old. Great for just giving your hands something to do while listening to a book or lesson.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love it its so good you should get the app right now it will do u great joy if u do
B007AL48UK|5.0|I almost didn't buy this game because I already had the regular Mahjong by this developer.  I thought it would be the same game with different pictures on the tiles.  I was wrong!  Although the playing of the game works the same, Summer Mahjong has new board layouts.  It offers a nice variety of new games, all with a Summer theme of, course!  If you like Mahjong, or if you want to learn how to play Mahjong, you will probably enjoy this version.  I almost didn't buy this, but I'm glad I did!
B005XQLBU4|3.0|I haven't played many times but it's a little nostalgic playing defender again, I<br /><br /> You played way back in the eighties.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|This app is very fun and I absolutely love playing it the game should have a different way to get hints instead of just uncovering letters
B0094BB4TW|5.0|this app is amazing u should try it lol jk well that is your option well this app is easy nd fast that u can use
B009WUAK2M|4.0|good movie all the old action stars played off each others talents and it worked in story line of The Expendables
0307586901|5.0|Martha is the best, no question.  I have a ton of her craft supplies, crafting tools, etc. I started my obsession, I mean my collection 3 years ago for my wedding, and I haven't stopped. I love all things Martha.  This book is a great book of ideas.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is a good, basic version for some mindless diversion. Good to twiddle the time away at a doctors office or while waiting in line somewhere.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|This film runs like the smoothest, most comfortable setting created by this cast of actors who really like love what they do!  We love it too
1781162646|5.0|Stephen King never disappoints and this is really enjoyable.  I quick read which I read on the beach this summer in one afternoon. I have lent it to 2 coworkers and when I get it back I will reread!
B009WUAK2M|3.0|All that needed to be said was said in the first movie.  In 2, the director just trotted out aging action heros for a string of cameos.  The movie would have been better with just Stallone and Stratham carrying the load.
B00CVDM8QS|2.0|This was not what I expected and would not read any of his other works.  It should have been advertised for what it is which is a detailed argument for atheism.  I did appreciate learning more about science even though I do not agree with all of his conclusions.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|you will love this app.it's is really cool and fun.it is also a challenge.play it to to see how much I love this app.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Addicting, fun, don't really like the fact that you have to buy the coins.... you should be able to earn more....
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Lots of fun.  Plenty of upgrades....Hours upon hours of fun.  Graphics aren't the very best, but the game play makes up for it.
030758836X|4.0|I had read many reviews about this book prior to reading it. As I went through the list, I saw many one-star reviews from people who hated the book and wanted their money back. I almost returned the book without reading it, but when I saw it on the New York Times best seller list for a long time, I wanted to give it a shot, and I am glad I did! I won't give the plot away in case you are reading this review prior to reading the book as I did. I will agree with other reviewers when they say that neither of the main characters are likeable. These are not two people you would want to be friends with, but you do get sucked into their warped marriage right from the beginning. The book does take many twists and turns, with some being unbelievable, but I can't help but feel that there are people in this world that would live out this story. Not everyone is a perfect member of society and Nick and Amy are an example of that. When I finished the book, I closed the cover thinking, \\"You know what, that could actually happen.\\" I may be one of a few that actually enjoyed the ending of this novel. I feel that it was suiting given how the plot played out. This novel is a glimpse into a world not most of us would understand or participate in, however, surrounds us every day. I really enjoyed this novel and would recommend it. There is foul language and descriptions of sex scenes, but it didn't bother me. These are things we don't say, but always think. Open your mind and take a chance on this book; I don't think you will be disappointed.
B007AL48UK|4.0|Nice app. No problems on ATRIX 4G.  Just difficult on a 4&quot; screen but manageable. Hah... not enough lines for ama zone. Great faotd.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Great game. Easy to pick up and great time killer. Havent had any problems so far. Great experience. Missiles galore.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|Benedict Cumberbatch + sci fi is a recipe for distilled awesome.  Also, the nods to the fandom were well-placed, as were the canonical-oid characterizations.  Spock and Uhuru is a relationship I still find odd in its novelty, and the pushing of the whole Kahn thing was an eensy bit overboard, but other than that, great flick.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|great fun. had fun playing the game. hard to stop playing when you start. cant wait to play the next one.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Silver Linings was insightful and very emotional. It is an easy read and interesting, good for leisure reading! If you are on the fence about reading Silver Linings and have seen the movie and enjoyed it, definitely read it! Plus, it's only $5 from kindle!
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|It was not what I expected, especially when I had no support from Google. I still cannot use this device and google cannot find  a solution. It is a waste of $35
B009RX8MQ0|5.0|Best tv show by light years and makes 90210 look like a kids show.<br />The men are so hot and sexy it amazing
B00ECUARO8|4.0|This story and the darkness of the character were not what I expected--but was it ever good! I usually get a pretty good sense of what is going to happen, but not with this movie. It is a rather subtle thriller. I liked it a lot. The acting ensemble was very talented, including the young newcomers. Definitely worth the watch!
B00006F2WY|4.0|I purchased this because it included tracks from the original performance that were not included in the original vinyl release. The concerto is on one disc, and provides me with a CD that will outlast my original vinyl. That disc alone would have earned a 5 star rating, but I now know why it wasn't included in the original vinyl release.
B000JMKRKC|4.0|The concurrent plots and cast of characters in this novel kept me awake and reading. I even read it on lunch breaks, which means I almost couldn't put it down. The author did an excellent job of moving back and forth through time. The characters were amazingly well developed considering that who and what they really were is key to the tale's development. She tied up the many confusing &#34;ends&#34; presented in the storyline. I was even a little disappointed to finish, but not disappointed in the least with the resolutions.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|I have to say, I was thinking this game was not going to be too good. Well, it looks like I'm wrong.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|Good game but ten dollars is a bit much for me to want to even consider buying an app. The game is very fun and the graphics and animations are nice also
B00A3VLJCE|3.0|This is a good photo editor and cheap enough as opposed to getting the full PC product which can cost you hundreds of dollars. The only glaring flaws I see is that there is no option to import PSDs from Dropbox and when you do import PSDs from Creative Cloud, the image comes flattened and you are unable to edit individual layers. Other than that, it's great for everything else, as there are many tools to work with, much more than most photo editors.
B00ECU34ZM|2.0|The audio of this movie was terrible.  I had to keep turning it up for the talking scenes and down during the action scenes.  Just another boring Tom Cruise movie.  The only reason I watched it was because Morgan Freeman was in it.  I was shocked to see Freeman in such of a bad movie.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|This is a fun game that stumped me quite a few times. Not as easy as I expected, but still easy enough for kids, too...
B00A3NQNUU|1.0|This Game Leads You Along StepByStep Which Is Annoying And Makes It Feel Geared Towards Kids. Then After My Third Dragon It Glitched And Kept Telling MeTo DoWhat I Already Had. Since It Doesn't Allow Self Guided Play The Game Was Stuck. I Wish There Was A Settings Option Or Restart Game. I Might Have Played Longer If It Allowed More FreePlay And Didn't Glitch.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Read all the how-to stories and tips and you'll get a solid overview of what this is capable of. One thing you may miss: it needs to be in really close proximity to your wireless router; it doesn't seem to pull signals as reliably as other devices such as PCs and laptops and tablets and even smartphones... but that's easy to deduce, considering it sits behind a massive slab of electronics (a TV). It's a fun and cool device, when you're Chromecasting what's in your Chrome browser or viewing a YouTube video. If I didn't already have a Roku box, I'd love this all the more because my wife and daughter are addicted to all the offerings on Netflix. I would not overpay for this by throwing a giant pile of hard-earned cash at one on Ebay; order it directly. I got mine after ordering on Amazon the day they were offered for sale and this one arrived weeks before the expected ship date. Without question, this is worth the $35, and if more is offered in the future, it'll be more than worth it. By the way... setup was as easy as most people claim.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I love this novel. It has this eerie kind of feel through the whole thing. That strange feeling that things are strange but you can't help your curiosity and keep on reading. A Masterpiece.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Awesome serious! Watching the Crawleys navigate through the changes of the early 1900's is thoroughly enjoyable.  I love all of the cast, but I think Mary and Granny are my favorites.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book is beautifully written and makes the characters more believable. You have to read this even if it breaks you.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Fun game and not too complicated. Suitable for any age.<br />It reminds me of some of the games from the 80s.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's most likely the most addicting game EVER!!! But that what makes it fun. I play all the time. I make really big houses by using just a few blocks and my imagination!
B004SEUJBE|5.0|Just cant get enough of it. The musuc score is fabulous. Costumes and cast AWESOME and I loved the music  while they rolled the credits.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Perfect little time killer with no need to over think. One of those &quot;Oh I forgot I had this installed&quot; little gems.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game is fun and a has some good  challenges. Should have some Moore rooms. Hope they do an expansion pack
B0033H7VI6|5.0|Ever since I received this knife it has served me well. The posting described the knife perfectly. It is an excellent knife.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I am a little bit disappointed that the video section redirects to youtube but otherwise there are no complaints. Search for the gameplay to see if it is for you.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is great for horse lovers that want horses but can not have one or don't have the time for one I like that I can train him myself and mix his feed
B004EPZ00C|5.0|I can't wait to watch this movie!! I ordered this a couple of days ago & I know it will be just as perfect as Johnny English was & Mr. Bean is!!! I love Rowan Atkinson & anybody that LOVES Buster Keaton will enjoy Rowan just as much!! Have fun watching!!!
B00D2K40WY|1.0|I don't like this game! I think it's so pointless, but my daughter thinks it's just the best game ever. Not worth getting!!
0920236162|5.0|I bought this book for my daughter who just hd her own child.  I hd to buy it again.  The original I gave to the elementary school.  This book ,like many of munsch's books are great for girls because  he empowers the heroines.  Three cheers for Munsch and his heroine.<br /><br />Cristina leckie
B00D6SBOWG|1.0|You download the free game only to find out only half of it is free.....not good!!! It needs to be known before you buy the game
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I prefer to shop ebay app than online. It simplifies my searches and allows me to refine and filter easily.
0062255657|2.0|If you like your fiction to make sense, then this book is not for you.<br /><br />The story begins with the suicide of an opal miner. Shortly after his death, strange things start happening. For example, a fish dies because of a coin that mysteriously appears in its stomach. What, exactly, is the connection between the opal miner and the fish? Well, your guess is as good as mine.<br /><br />I did not like this book. The author did not seem to have a clear, coherent vision of the ties between different parts of his story. Overall, the fable did not amount to much.<br /><br />Furthermore, the protagonist was too young and too passive for him to be an interesting character.<br /><br />If you're a logical thinker, you may want to skip this book.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|very entertaining film.<br />Played on my UK area player.(I was concerned whether it would work on my machine).<br />Superb photography, great story.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This Chromecast is a game changer for me. Now I can get rid of cable and use Netflix and YouTube and more services coming soon.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|A combination of drama, love, and everyday life. Beautiful people with wonderful clothes, especially the chief woman lawyer. Boy can she dress! Love this series, never miss one. Julianne is a hit: human smart and beautiful comes across very well.
B005C4ERHQ|5.0|I love this tool.  We spend to much time trying to fix weaknesses rather than looking at our teams Strengths
B00BBW14YC|5.0|It touched our hearts and made us laugh and cry.<br />A sweet movie with excellent acting. A must see. AAA-+
B005ZMTXMY|5.0|Lovely heartwarming film, suitable for all ages. Nice work Pixar!!<br /><br />I need to write more words for this review to qualify, ah, there we go...
B009AY04A8|4.0|Great app.  Love all the levels.  Colorful graphics.  Easy to skip the tutorials if you don't want to read.  Challenging.  Only complaint is some puzzles could use a little more explanations.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Read it in one unplanned seating.  It would be a great bookclub book...lots of would you?  Could you?  Should you? questions that are difficult for each of us to answer.
0743270754|5.0|The history of Lincoln's presidency is of interest in general.  Doris Kearns Goodwin puts one into the time period and inspires as well as makes one feel like they are living it.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|To start with, I really enjoyed these DVD's, especially the \\"77\\" concert in 5.1, which is worth the price of this alone.  I'm a huge Eagles fan and I probably have everything they ever recorded in all formats.  The one thing I've noticed in the \\"History of the Eagles\\" is that Glenn Frey is simply a egotistical bully to put it mildly (watch the DVD before you bitch).  It's his way or the highway.  His hateful attitude shows when he fires these two artist I'm mentioning and his reluctance to get the band together later on.  The hate in his heart is so apparent.  The group was at their best with the high voice of Randy Meisner and lead guitarist Don Felders licks. Think about the Stones playing without Keith Richards or Led Zeppelin without Jimmy Page or Fleetwood Mac without Lindsey . . . good . . . but not as good. In no way am I criticizing Walsh, he's incredible but he's not Felder.<br /><br />I suspect I'll have haters because of this review . . . but I speak the truth.  :)
0062255657|5.0|At a short 160 pages, this book is a wonderful read filled with wonder and nostalgia.<br /><br />There are such clever and witty ideas, such as talking to molecules or ordering germs around. Seeing a crescent moon on the front porch and a full moon from the back porch.<br /><br />The details can sometimes be vague, forcing you to do the brunt of the imagining. The author teases you with ideas but you're left to really think about them.<br /><br />A wonderful book and I heavily recommend it as an introduction to Neil Gaiman.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love the people in the cast.  They do a wonderful job making the story feel real.  Wish I could visit the Abbey!!
B005OT2YVA|5.0|Wish they have the 3D versions.  But it did has HD streaming.  Great family movies for the weekend.  Would be better if they have 3D version
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I like the concept and that is why I gave it a 4 *.<br />Not much content on it yet, but I expected that and I am looking forward for Google to quickly add more content.<br />I also expect that Google will upgrade Chromcast electronically through the WEB, as improvements are made.
B000FBJF6Y|5.0|I enjoyed this book. Now I want to read the rest of them! I can't wait to find out what happens next!
B007WJ6U10|5.0|Full of epic encounters, royal passion & obsession, great beauty, bitter historical truths w/ terrible consequences - this series is a rippingly told cautionary tale of great power in the hands of a proud & willful King Henry VIII.
0937381888|5.0|Highly recommended for new brewers. From the basics and beyond. All you will need to know to do it right
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|What can I say about this book? Well, it made me think. Points for that. And I have to admit, it was a page-turner. I can't put my finger on why, but I did find it a compelling read.<br /><br />The glamorization of a violent/abusive relationship is disheartening. I've seen friends get involved in relationships like this, and it's frightening, not sexy or adorable. But I highly doubt there's anything about that aspect that has not been said in a prior review.<br /><br />So I'll focus on the other things that bothered me. Travis's character felt somewhat real in terms of a jealous/damaged young adult, but I had trouble buying the fact that he could win every fight (including Vegas?) while apparently never working out, but keeping up a busy schedule of smoking and drinking. But certain things about him were endearing, so I guess that's the appeal.<br /><br />The main character, Abby--I can't even picture what she looks like. Was it described? All I know is she is the ultimate \\"Mary Sue\\": good at everything (she can drink guys under the table-even though she \\"doesn't drink\\", win every poker game-even against seasoned pros, cook a fabulous meal, etc.) not to mention turn every guy's head because she is so gorgeous.<br /><br />I didn't find the initial scenario remotely believable, in terms of all 3 involved people being OK with one dating the girl while she sleeps in another guy's bed every night.<br /><br />There were a lot of errors, but that may have been corrected in more recent editions.<br /><br />And yet, this is the longest review I think I've written...something about this book grabs people. It's a love it or hate it, but I'm going to say for me personally, the positives and the negatives wash out to a 3.
B008XG1X18|5.0|love it, love the categories, love making own categories. would recommend to all whole like &quot;stuff&quot; but may not love browsing the Internet, like me :-)
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|Very good book, kept my interest!!! Only thing I did not like would be that the author added an unnessary GD curse word.
B000RLCJ5Q|4.0|its just like it says, the singles. guess that means the B - sides to. all the favorites are here
B004EPZ07U|4.0|This was an interesting movie from many perspectives.  It displayed the obvious Super Hero bit, but it also had the subtle nuances of feelings of the main character.  It was well done.
B001P3SA94|5.0|Cadillac Records is a wonderful window into a transitional period in the American music scene. Back when this music was known as \\"race music,\\" the pioneers of blues paved the way to ultimately cross over into mainstream popular music. These men and women made the music that influenced a whole new generation of musicians and listeners alike, and pioneered what came to be know as rock and roll. Most of the big name groups from the 1950s on through to today owe their popularity and their roots to these fine musicians who created a truly American art form that has swept the world with their influence. A very moving and inspiring film, that also illustrates the struggles faced by these performers in the face of institutionalized racism here at home. Despite these obstacles, the performers went on to break down barriers and open doors that were previously closed to people of \\"color.\\" A chronicle of some of the finest music and musicians that America has to offer. A wonderful addition to the library of any true music lover.
B008JFUO4U|3.0|This movie was a little hard to follow.  It was OK and the acting was adequate.  Nothing spectacular or special.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Totally reminds me of Missile Command from the 80s. I was never very good at it but I rock at this one. Enjoy!!
B00CH87HF4|5.0|This game is a lot of fun. A world to get lost in.  I'm impresses with the depth this game takes.
B00DW36G32|1.0|This movie is long-winded and anticlimactic as can be. I would be wary of wasting my time. My wife keeps telling me she wants that hour and a half of her life back. Other than some cool manstuff, this movie is whack.
0894803123|3.0|Book was interesting...particularly how Ben and Jerry became Ice Cream business partners.  The ice cream recipes were a little disappointing especially as I am a loyal Ben and Jerry ice cream customer.  I was not aware they did not cook the eggs before combining their other ingredients.  Salmonella is always a concern no matter how careful the egg producers are.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This works amazingly well. It is great to watch Netflix on and it was really nice when my friend wanted to  share a YouTube video while at my house, and she could also just connect from her phone with ease.

B009AY04A8|4.0|A good hidden object game. To many penalty points since you have to touch the screen in order to see everything. They should hurry up the conversations a little more, but overall pretty good.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Fun game, but a lot of cool things in it take real money. But you can play for free at least.
B004HMQ7BI|5.0|One of my all time fav. romantic comedies!  I think if you just got engaged and you can watch this and have no second thoughts you found the right one!! If you do-- take a trip watch this move again have a glass of wine and then give the ring back!!!

B0034DGPEU|5.0|I truly enjoyed reading this novel and could not put it down. I find my sleep to be precious but I ended up staying up all night trying to find out how it would end.  The author has an extraordinary way of telling a very believable story from our past.  I loved it and look forward to reading more from this author.

Some elements of his story may be exaggerated, but all depict the necessary machinations of each side.  The shapeless forms of terror in our world do indeed draw power from a number of mostly legitimate sympathizers.  This is what makes this war and all other similar anti-democratic movements chillingly dangerous.  We westerners largely still haven't a clue as to the real plans for our lives.  Plans that are patiently being implemented decade by decade.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|The product was very fun and entertaining and provided a bit of a challenge. I absolutely loved the game and the way it was set up.
B008B1BL4E|4.0|This should be must reading for anyone wishing to try and understand the history of the current rivalries in the former Yugoslavia and why that country was doomed from the beginning because its creators did not understand or comprehend the histories of these rivalries
B004VMUS9G|5.0|this is the best alarm clock app you will find. a huge plus is that it is free. the ads are small and unnoticed while the alarms are loud and clear. great app.
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|Let me start by saying that I'm a huge Star trek fan. I've seen every episode of the TV series and all if the films too. Wow, I love this movie...<br />If you are looking for a fun story full of action, adventure and humor throughout you won't go wrong with this one. Good stuff... Can't wait to see where they take the crew of the good ole NC1701!!!
B0084AXZK0|5.0|I loved the story of Dorian Gray, by Oscar Wilde. I also hated the egotistical character! I guess that's what makes this an English classic?
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|As soon as more apps use it, it will get my vote for product of the year.  Get if if you can.
B00D7JGL36|5.0|This CD is unbelievable.  The voice of Vince Gill, the steel guitar of Paul Franklin and the Bakersfield sound makes for music you can't stop playing.  My only complaint is there are only 10 tracks.  I wanted much more of this combination
0525958002|3.0|While it was fun to read both books, Andy Taylor's Wildboy is much more interesting and just overall better. Hardcore Duranie here... his was just better. However, I do recommend this book for any Duran fan. John had the looks and the fan base, but Andy had the better book. Interested to see if Nick and Simon write one.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Enjoyed this escape game. persistence pays off and difficulty is just right. more levels would be appreciated. graphics were nice.
B00CATSONE|5.0|Nicola Tesla's life and imagination were remarkable. This story not only tells you of his greatest inventions and pitfalls, but also gets the reader thinking and educating them about what \\"makes a genius.\\" A great story!
B00B22ASUM|5.0|This was the best true story about a cat. The book was so good. I am planning on reading it a 2nd and 3rd time
B0064MGU98|4.0|I'm still watching the show and liking very much, it's a good show, but thought it was a free show...
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|I expected the usual action flick BUT it was so funny I couldn't believe it. John Malkovich gives the movie a push in a hilarious direction and Helen Mirren was a pleasant surprise!
B00006RCNJ|5.0|I have not enjoyed a show like this in many many years.  Not only is each performance super, but the variety can please everyone.
B00E3VTR1K|5.0|I can't believe I read Galactic Energies so fast... I just couldn't stop! The author has an amazing imagination. Luca Rossi takes science fiction into new territory. All short stories are well written, with fascinating plots and unexpected endings. Female characters are dominant, strong and sexy. The book is written by a foreign author and you can tell. It's been a long time since I've read such new, fresh and innovative short stories, which made me think about who we really are, where we come from and how dangerous modern technology can be. Life in Prison, Forms of Love and Clouded Emotions were my favorite tales. Go enjoy them! Worth a read? Absolutely!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is the best version of bingo available for kindle. Bonus a lot of great bingo buddies.  There are free tournaments everyday and free gifts to give to all your buddies daily. Best screens and sounds if you play the slot rooms you can earn a lot of coins for your bingo treasure chest keys and power ups.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|This is a great way to remotely charge your bluetooth when no power source is available. I travel a lot for work and this keeps my Legend charged using it for up to 4 days before I have to charge it. I highly recommend this charge case!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|This is a Great set to have. The blu-ray is very nice and the sound is Amazing. You will save money if you get this.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|The graphics are really nice and the story is interesting. The only wrong thing about it is having to wait day after day for progressing

0615782043|4.0|To be honest, I was pretty certain that I was not going to like this book. One, I'm not a fan of poetry and two, the title alone, threw me off. But, I decided to give it a shot and figure out what the hype was all about. Surprisingly, it's a very well written book. It's only about 60 pages, so fairly quick to read. I would say it contains about 20 poems. The poetry is exquisite and breath-taking. The amount of detail that is laced along each and every line is incredible. During some points, I felt like I was watching a movie instead of reading a poem.<br />All of the poems are fun and erotic but the language is not offensive at all. It's actually very calm but sexy at the same time. It's a short collection of wonderful and sensual poetry; its hard not to love. This is a skillfully written piece of literature. Well done, GPA!! I highly recommend this book for all lovers out there.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Really like this app when I want download PDF files very easy to use along with the fact it has many features text box , highlight  extra... Also can Email finished docs. To others while not losing edited info.
B004GJXQ20|5.0|Having ordered the DVD set some time ago. I started watching it 2 weeks ago & immediately after the first episode, I downloaded the book on Kindle. For once I was pleasantly surprised as the series hardly deviated from the book and the characters were brought to life, both in the literal sense and pictorially. Each character relating their own story & perspective is a joy to read. Definitely the beginning of a younger Tolkinesque series. Perhaps better suited to younger generations, but certainly enjoyed by the &#34;your in my box 50-59 year olds&#34;!
1481130331|5.0|The Luck of the Weissensteiners is an epic historical fiction based  in  Eastern Europe during World War II. This story - the tale of two families - will captivate readers immediately and hold them mesmerized until the final page. These two families, one Jewish and one Catholic, find their fates entwined as they fight for survival among the fascist then communist invasion of Slovakia.  This  story  is  not  only  a  great  history  lesson  but  a  truly  remarkable  book.  It  is  a  new  classic.  A  master  piece  and  work  of  art. The  details  of  this  book  were  beautiful.  In  every  page  I  felt  like  I  was  there.  I  was  transformed  back  into  time  finding  myself  cheering  for,  crying  for  and  wanting to  embrace  the  families.  I  think  everyone  will find  themselves  holding  their  breath  until  the  last  page  is  read.This  book  is  not  only  for  adults  but  for  any  H.S.  student  who  truly  wants  a  lesson  about  World  war  2.  Honestly  I  wish  I  could  give  this  book  more  then  five  stars!
037575251X|5.0|I did not know this was two stories- so I ordered Call of the Wild the full story.  Love the author
B00992CF6W|2.0|The app is pretty fun but they have some things to work on when I go multiplayer I always get disconnected it won't let me sleep in the bed,I can't open the chest.,I can.'t use the furnace please fix it
B000002ADT|5.0|It was everything I expected, I always heard this album was good. the only problem was the Jewel case was cracked.
B008MM9630|5.0|I love this game!! The quests are simple and gems aren't too hard to come by. You don't have to rely on anyone to send you things. My favorite game on my Kindle. I love that if your plants wither you can revive them for only double energy instead of lose out on them entirely. Really cute game
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This book is well-written and sent me to the dictionary more than once.  Beautifully done.  A magical piece of art.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|I Love uno and I think it was fun to play with other people and make friends with them so I recommend this app if you love uno and think it is fun
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|It's a good game wen it bored nd you just play and have fun win points and prizes<br />And beat friends
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|It's good. There are some twists you can see coming, and one or two that are more difficult to spot. There's a sad-then-happy ending that would have been braver if it just had ended on the sad note.
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|Darius Rucker has always been a fan of mine even when he was with Hottie and the Blowfish.  And now with country and western, a definate must have.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|It's probably the only Bond movie that can stand on its own as simply an engaging movie. It's probably also the only Bond movie with metaphor other than of the sexual variety.<br /><br />Love the delving into Bond's past--you never get this in the other installments--love M as the Mother figure, love Bardem's motive as the abandoned child. By the end of the film as pieces of Bond's identity have been burned to the ground, you have the plausible return of familiar elements missing from the first two Daniel Craig installments.<br /><br />It'd be five stars if they made it the moviie that they'll never be able to make: one with minimal fantastic elements, set once again in the 1960s.
B00AK57N00|4.0|This game is great as a time killer, and with moderate replay value. However, it does tend to get boring after a while so I wouldn't really recommend playing this game for long periods of time.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Reminds me of the classic game growing up, and a great deal at the price.  I recommend that everyone at least try it out.
B008J34466|5.0|Everything I expected and more. My kind of music. I really enjoy cruising down the road<br />with the volume cranked and my hair blowing in the breeze.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I love playing bingo and collecting rooms. I don't like that there are rooms where shadow cards don't show or you use up 200 credits before the shadows show.  I don't like the length of time it takes to get a problem settled.  I do like chatting and meeting new people.  It is very addictive.  I cant stop playing.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Take your time and you won't pay anything, this is a great game. Very addictive and challenging, this will help you pass your time.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is awesome I have it on my iPhone kindle and other tablets gong to put it on laptop at work
B005544TRQ|5.0|Suits is one of those engaging TV series that you can't stop watching.  Great writing, great acting, and highly improbable stories.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Brings back great memories of playing missle commander a long long time ago.  I guess I need to add a few more words
0399255370|5.0|This is one of the finest children's books I have read in a long time. Oliver Jeffers' illustrations are wonderful! His art continues to impress me. I admire and love the fact that he lends such a &#34;child&#34; like quality to his illustrations. They are full of color and creativity, but what I love most is the fact that kids can truly relate to them. The story is fresh and original. The author, Drew Daywalt, created an interesting tale (crayons on strike) that was executed in way that entertains young and old alike. I cannot wait to share this story with my next class of 1st graders.
B005DJREGQ|5.0|Love this show!  Watch it with my daughter. She also loves the drama that comes with the show.  Makes us laugh. :)
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Really challenging lol love the game wish there was a hint burgeoning other then that it is a gun I am completely happy
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Easy setup. Watching YouTube within 10 minutes. Simple to use. Looking forward to more having a wider selection of apps!!
0828822875|5.0|Being a first year French college student, this book was recommended to me by my French professor. It is everything she said it would be: funny, sincere, entertaining, and easy to grasp for French speakers at any level. The tales of petite Nicolas and his friends are well-written and easily engaging. Sempe penned a book filled with everyday and colloquial language that is great for out-of-class reading, especially for those who haven't read many books in French. So, whether you are looking to be introduced to French literature or you're a native speaker, Le Petit Nicolas is likely the book for you.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Expect for pearl purchases I like this game for my little one. She learns about reefs, fish, and how to manage her money through the colorful details of the game. The music is also very pleasant.
B000N3T0DW|5.0|Loved it!  It's definitely more of a woman's movie than a man's movie.  I am glad I bought it because it is worth seeing more than one time.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|The Chromecast launched with only a few major partners, specifically Netflix and YouTube. With it's extremely simple set-up, I was streaming from both services on my iPhone within about 5 minutes. Tons of new content providers are prepared to come on board too, including Pandora and Hulu Plus. I used to run a dedicated home theater pc to run various media through my TV, and I was able to unplug it the moment I set up my Chromecast.<br /><br />Even better, anyone connected to your Wifi network can throw their own compatible content to your TV, creating a fun queue of your friends' favorite videos and music (especially once Pandora enters the fray).<br /><br />It's also great because you can cast your Google Chrome tabs to the TV as well, displaying them on the big screen. I use that regularly when I have to watch videos or webcasts for class.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and pick up a Chromecast for yourself. It's half the price of a Roku with far more exciting potential. Even as a potentially unfinished product at the moment, it's more than worth the cost.
B005XQLBU4|3.0|Just an ok game, somethig to pass the time. Wasn't that big of a wow or fun. Again enough to pass the time. Probably gonna delete soon.
1475143389|5.0|GREAT BOOK! I really enjoyed reading all the information. I have a new found aspect on how to really get in-shape and be healthy. THANKS MIKE!
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Professor Reza Aslan has done a masterful job of researching historical documents and scholarly books and articles.  His book is controversial because it contradicts evangelical understanding of John the Baptist, Jesus Christ and the Disciples.  This book will not be accepted and certainly read  by those whose religiosity is purely based on blind faith and superstition.
B004132HZS|5.0|Quality BBC programming.  Cumberbatch and Freeman shine. Buy it now.<br />Why does Amazon require me to type so much about it?
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is strangely addictive. If you are a horse lover it is a must download. It's free too! You can't beat free horses.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|I just started playing this game today, it`s fun and reminds me of the Atari classic. I recommend playing for a quick bit of fun.
159463176X|5.0|And the Mountains Echoed was everything I expected.  After reading The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns, I knew I was going to love it.  Khaled Hosseini's writings is like reading poetry.  He writes with such a beautiful even flow....Just like the feathers Abdullah had saved for his beloved sister, Pari.  Of all the books I have ever read, Khaled Hosseini's books are the only ones I could read over and over again.  Thank you Khaled for sharing your gift from God.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Simply amazing I r www ad the first one and thought that was good but this one wow is all I can say though it took a little to get in to it at the beginning the rest was phenomenal
B0000AQS0F|3.0|The IDEA behind this show was a #10!<br />No doubt about that. i think we all wanted it to work.<br />Clearly, backing and support for this endeavor was weak and noncommittal.<br />Firefly is capable of becomming a mega hit with infinite possibilities.<br /><br />Ok now, just for fun....!<br />....who picked out the pink ruffled dress and was the plan to give us a little chuckle?<br />It was really really really aweful..........ha!
0375842209|2.0|A very depressing book.  Not at all what i expected.<br />Would not recommend.  Had a hard time following the author's story line
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|It really makes your brain work.. when you think you have it you don't . As always coins are hard to come by
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The writing and acting is beautifully done on this period show.  I have truly enjoyed watching the last three seasons and cannot wait for the next season.

B0002NRRAG|5.0|If you love the classic music of Ella Fitzgerald and Billie Holiday, you'll love Madeleine. I love that she does original songs and covers. Her voice is amazing and I love that there are still people out there that make this kind of music. it's the kind of music you could have on at any time in your house and it's not disruptive, it's relaxing yet fun.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|It was well written and portrays the many sides of a warriors mindset.  Touches briefly on how lack of knowledge and leadership skills impact troops carrying out their mission.
B007MB5OCE|3.0|What started out to be original and funny grew increasingly tiresome. The book was too long by almost 100 pages, but still it was worth reading.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|This is a really fun game - brought back some fond memories from the childhood.  I trust it will bring you many hours of entertainment.
B005VPRGB0|5.0|Our seven year old grandson and his Dad, our son, loved it. Great project for father and son to for together!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|New version of old classic...I love it...<br />Ability to upgrade and repair is great, fast speed, fun and the best free.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|Kept going to the end.  Difficult to imagine as a parent of three boys.  Will suggest as a good read.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|I think this app is great. this app works just like a book dictionary the only difference is it's available at your fingertips all you have to do is type in the word you're looking for and it pulls it up with the pronounciation and the definition
B009LMTDL0|2.0|Didn't finish it. It appears to be meant for younger women who are now in the work force or are planning to be.
B0079XPUOW|5.0|Very funny version of Star Trek parody.  I've had to loan my Kindle to my wife for her to read it too.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Reminds me off my arcade days. Good pace, fun smooth graphics, easy to navigate menus. One of the best Kindle games yet.
B00ECU2SGS|5.0|While watching MUD we really enjoyed the time and story of the movie. Our attention was completely captured. Great Movie!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a great simple yet addictive game for all ages. My 9 year old son and I have standing competitions to see you can get the farthest run. Great fun!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This game fun and easy to use. I had a blast trying to get to ahigh level and there is great replay value.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This was a very entertaining game, even my teenage children wanted to try.  I can't wait for more of The Room.
B00C1TOTK0|5.0|The color restoration on the SHANE blu-ray is rich and stunning.  Those technicolor, background Teton Range views steal some of scenes; that is how beautiful this restoration is!  And those reviewers who said the blu-ray would cut off the top and bottom of the picture, well, that is not the case.  The movie appears as close to original early-1950's form as the makers could be expected to get it.  (Of course, in order to retain the original aspect of the film, there will be black bars on the left and right sides when viewed on modern flatscreen T.V.s.)  If you love SHANE and you love technicolor and you love some of the best cinematography ever, buy this blu-ray!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|A predictable ending from a book full of kinky sex. Absolutely no research required from the author regarding the plot, whatever it was. There really isn't enough substance for a movie.
B00E5Q1LTY|3.0|sad that this movie based it's story line on an event that supposedly took place several years in the future with Khan and played it to sell this movie! Can not these overpaid writers come up with some original material without having to vampire feed off of earlier (decades) story lines? they have the whole darn galaxy to use yet suck off of others inspiration???
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|A must see for anyone who has ever been in the music business!  Also a great history of RocknRoll for any music lover.
B009AY04A8|4.0|I love hidden object games, but they always become redundant.  I like how, with this  game, each area has several rounds of play and they actually move the story along.  These levels are challenging and fun.  Some are easy, but an equal number make me have to stop and think.  The story seems fairly interesting, though, I tend to skip through it so I can get to the puzzles.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I loved all four of the ice ace movies, and when I saw they came out with an app like this for it, I was iffy at first... others where odd and took forever from the beginning, but this one is exceptionally high in the factor of entertainment!
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Wonderous take on an absolute classic!  Gets hectic and difficult quicly, but the rush is well worth it.  I was lucky to grab it free but well worth a dollar.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I love this game very exciting and keep your eyes and mind and hands on the go, The game also help you with your match if you take too long,
B004K8WPUQ|5.0|This is by far the best microphone for the DSLR shooter. Quick, easy & quality sound recording. A must have in any DSLR kit.
B008AIGWVA|5.0|My baby brother likes to play this game he thinks its funny its a good game so if i were you i would get this game
B0051OZ564|2.0|I heard good reviews about this movie from my friend and family members and was coming for the action that I have seen in the trailers. in the end this movie is very confusing and at times very boring. The action was good but still was able to keep me interested in the movie. Don't watch this movie save your time and money
B0058DRUV6|3.0|This book is more difficult to read on a kindle than in paper form.  I made the mistakes of clicking on some of the footnotes and the technical information is very complex and difficult to find your way back to the book.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I needed a calculator, and this gets the job done. I like how it keeps a memory of what you previously calculated.
B00821PCJS|4.0|We were hooked on this series after the first episode. He are on Season Three already. Bummer that now we will have to wait for Season 4 to air and bed one before it is released!
B00CFYAT6O|5.0|the is another great husband & wife meshing. I enjoy their solo work &#34; together&#34;. I recommend it to all.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|good game to take up time and I can actually play without having to spend a lot of money unless I want to.
B00DC3DGSK|5.0|I have been following his music since 1984. his vocals are distinct and his guitar playing is just as good as ever. his variety of guests only shows how well liked he is.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Very easy read, if you like 50 shades you will defiantly love this book. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves romances and is ok with a little dirty details
B003U69IX6|4.0|My son was a little disappointed in the editing for the screen,  but overall enjoyed the movie almost as much as the book.
B00A285OOW|5.0|Phillipa has done it yet again with yet another dazzling book. I can not get enough, Keep them coming please!
B0090SI4LU|5.0|This is as close to the book as it can be for a movie. I really enjoyed it. Even if you haven't read it, you will enjoy this.
B0040HO01Y|4.0|I just love all the characters in this show.  I feel like I'm there in the hamlet when I watch this movie.  I really love its content, story and actors.  I loathe watching shows with dirty language and so much sexual context.  Watching this show is so comfortable for me.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I read a lot of the reviews here and decided not to read the book. I even read the entire wiki so I'd be ready for book 6. After awhile I felt I should just read ADWD for completeness. Overall I enjoyed the book. I'm not sure if it's because I prepared myself for the worst or what. I didn't really find myself wanting chapters to be done with which I seem to remember happening in book 4. I even jumped ahead a couple times so I didn't have to wait to continue a character. Anyway if you are a fan of the series it's definitely worth reading. I just wonder what HBO is going to do with books 4 & 5 :)
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|This isn't my preferred genre, but this book was really a good read. I read it while on the beach in Cape Cod, and couldn't put it down. The kindle edition was great, no errors or anything weird like they sometimes have. Read the next book (scarlet) immediately and loved it too. Can't wait for the third to come out.<br />Also- this isn't Charles Dickens. This book must be appreciated on its own, not compared to anything else. Is it intellectually stimulating? No. But frankly, sometimes I just want to read something fun and be entertained. This fit the bill exactly.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I USE TO PLAY THIS ON MY COMPUTER for hours, couldn't quit I was addicted. Now I have it on my Kindle, Yahoo....
B00A8ECU24|2.0|there is no way to complete the game without buying gems.  so I let my kids earn gems.  they get pretty far, then the game gets updated and doesn't work, then we have to uninstall and reinstall the game.  then what happens?  they lose EVERYTHING, including the gems we paid cash for.  it just updated AGAIN and AGAIN we are getting errors and it crashes.  great idea but it ducks they work so hard to lose everything.  I told them I cant buy them more gems anymore
B005XQLBU4|5.0|It is a very fun game, easy to understand and so far it's impossible to get stuck or frustrated. Love games like this! Great game for all ages!
B00D6SBOWG|4.0|What a kick in the pants. Takes a bit to figure out the rules in each alligator game which is presented as a game of golf. It really puts a new spin on your card games. Try it. It is a genuine pleasure. Thank you Big Fish. Well done.
B007FEFLTO|3.0|Can't wait till #3.  Not quite as good as #1 but still a fine book. Wish all three books were available.  I may have to go back and reread 1 & 2 when 3 comes out. Due to my advanced age I have a tendency to forget some things.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|It was ok strategist eggs Dr f d discs d d Dr d s svc w f specifics I'd HD
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Just like Missile Command, but with some new upgrades.  Fun time waster.  No complaints yet-  I will tentatively give it five stars.
B00DHNB5CY|5.0|Great remake, I would watch this again. I hope they make the next two. Nice twist in this movie. Great
B00BIVN82M|5.0|It's a great album, full of wonderful music, remakes included.  It's a great gift idea, if you need one for someone.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|love this game i like how you can buy things without using real money so i pretty much think that this game is actually free and not half true like alot of games claim.
B009WUBERW|4.0|Was a good film but I liked the first one better.  Good action shots and lots of explosions but still liked the first one more than this one.
B00D3V85FA|3.0|13 is pretty cool.i mainly like god is dead?.its very good and full of nice lyrics and a great guitar solo.And ozzy is still kicking.For a man who is aging,he can rock.its not as good as his solo stuff,but I do like 13.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I have two Roku boxes to do most of my streaming, but Google has blocked them from having a YouTube channel. I bought a Chromecast solely because I wanted a cheap and easy solution for streaming YouTube videos on my TV, and this seemed to fit that bill perfectly.<br /><br />The initial setup was very easy. I got it connected to my wifi network and tested streaming from both my laptop and my Nexus 7, and everything was working fantastically for several hours. Then I made the mistake today of unplugging the device to move it to the living room. I was able to reconnect my Nexus to the Chromecast, but every time I try to launch a YouTube video the Chromecast disconnects. I can watch the videos on the Nexus itself, and I've never had a connection problem in that room with any other device, so it's obviously not a problem with my wifi.<br /><br />I've fought with this thing for an hour now, and I'm sure if I invest another hour searching Google and troubleshooting I may finally get it working again. But if I were any less tech saavy, this would be boxed back up for return. I can't complain too much for $35, but I'm also not going to be able to recommend it to anyone.
B00AH69BPM|5.0|Beyond Magnetic may not be a big hit,but it really rocks.All four songs on it are very good.Metallica really hasn't changed their sound that much and every time I listened to it,i grew more and more hooked on Beyond Magnetic.Some people just don't appreciate musicians who have been around for a long time.Obviously Metallica isn't going to be thrash metal anymore.That was a long time ago,so please give Beyond Magnetic a chance.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|This game is awesome to play! My favorite part is when you get far enough, you go into different worlds like the lava world and the swamp world. There are also many powerups to help you for NOT real money, but coins you earn inthe game! Also, I have not found one ad or pop-up (except the one to rate this game.) Overall, the game is awesome for my samsung galaxy s tab 2
B009AY04A8|3.0|Typical hidden object.A little more dialog than I care for,but it's ok.You can't go wrong with a pirate theme tho. :-)
B0063IH60K|5.0|This app is great for a person who loves card games and gets u hooked.  It has a winning<br />Deal feature witch I like awesome game get it.
B009AY04A8|5.0|Fun good for free and easy download simple and easy download the latest version from the computer and it out of law and order to the door for kids and it out it was frightend to
1401938906|5.0|What an outstanding book. Pam Grout.. well done! If you read the Secret or Think and Grow Rich this book is similar but far, far better.  Why?  Because she doesn't just spend pages saying it can be done, she shows you HOW.  Yes, I did get results with her experiments!  She is brilliant! If you didn't get results you just need to relax and rethink.  I have laughed out loud how she worded things.  Love her humor. We could so be best friends!<br />She addresses touchy subjects such as what is God, and how we have been 'trained to think', or how we follow society without being insulting or ridiculous. I love how she thinks. I love how she writes. A huge Atta-girl from me!<br />I think this is an easy read but LIVE CHANGING.
B009HEMW4W|4.0|This vastly underrated sequel is exciting and fun and moves like lightning, thanks to a clever script that takes J back into the past to save Earth and prevent the murder of K. Josh Brolin does a dead on Tommy Lee Jones impression as the 29 year old K, and his performance seems to have brought out the best in Will Smith, who matches him with a strong performance of his own. There are lots of funny details of life in 1969, and a hilarious cameo by Bill Hader. A twist at the end gives the relationship between J and K real substance.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This book is a complex web with all the necessary layers to leave you wanting, disappointed, angry, hurt, elated, but mostly satisfied. The author is a talented story teller!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This the best product in 2013. Small but very effective. On price point you can not beat....compared to similar products in the market today.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Last level was a little tricky, but all the others were fun. Easy to navigate on the kindle screen. Some of the puzzles get repetitive which is what keeps me from rating it 5 stars.
B002UHTTWQ|4.0|Very enjoyable and long first book of a saga! Am looking forward to the rest of them. Kept me riveted to the story of Emma Harte and to the wonderful and intricate plot.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|This app is a lot of fun, just started playing it beginning levels are really easy.<br /><br />We we'll see how challenging it gets.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Enjoyed first game so much, I'm addicted. Easy to play and good mindless fun. Be sure to make some key upgrades like more missiles and larger blast area. Just fun!
B0018Q4DTY|5.0|I grew up an Oukast fan and when I seen that the MP3 album was available I bought it and wasn't disappointed.
B00BLCHZC2|5.0|love watching vikings, I cant wait for the next season.it has a good plot, and it appears to be historically accurate
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Jesus in the context of his time. Fascinating and well researched. Fleshes out the competing narratives of those that would define Jesus for the ages.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I loved middle command as a kid. The multi-touch controls are such a perfect match for this game. I love it!
B0089LOG02|5.0|Couldn't quit reading it. Based in historical facts, the author weaves an excellent tale. The resilience of the human heart!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love Love playing Bingo Blitz!!! Really enjoy the five free games tournament to get extra power ups & points! And enjoy playing the slots to get extra coins!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I enjoy this game and it doesn't freeze! I'm glad I downloaded it such a great game to play. I defiantly would regimens this to friends.
B006PZBR8S|5.0|This movie surprised me a lot. Is one of the best movies I've ever watched<br />I don't normally write reviews, but decided to write one for this film. It's really worth watching.<br />I really loved it.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Updated version of middle command.  Fun game if you are old enough to remember the original.  Well worth the buck to play.
1400069289|5.0|I love stuff like this!<br /><br />The Power of Habit created so many \\"aha!\\" moments and the desire to challenge myself. Thanks to this book and the stories therein, I purchased a FitBit--with which I am already completely head-over-heels in love--to get in the habit of exercising more. I'm more aware of my own patterns and those of my children, which I hope will make me a better parent. And it helps to know why I crave certain things, even when I tell myself that I don't really want them.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B009AY04A8|5.0|I enjoy playing this game.this is such fun<br />Lots of things to find.some are challenging.<br />Some are easy.try it and you will like it.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Sometimes you just don't want to think. In the bathroom, at a meeting, with your in-laws.<br />This app delivers easy, mindless entertainment. And I mean that in a good way. Nkcely done!!
0425263924|5.0|Loved it all three books , wait til the next book to came out. Crossfire novels are a  great set to read
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Just challenging enough to be interesting and fun. Not so hard as to be frustrating. Need more levels soon, please.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I could not put this book down.  Wasn't crazy about the ending, but the book kept me on my toes until the end.
B001L83PLQ|5.0|A Nigerian friend recommended that I read *Half a Yellow Sun* as a good introduction to Adichie. I was blown away by this story of the ill-fated nation of Biafra and its people. I remember the iconic TV images of starving children with distended bellies but had no knowledge of the tragic conflict that produced them. This novel is both a history and a powerful story of love, loss and what it takes to realize what is most important in life. I went on to read the author's most recent novel, *Americanah* which I would give more tha 5 stars if I could. Among other things, it's the most honest observation of race in America that I have ever encountered by a character who, like the author, speaks from the experience of a person from a country in Africa who discovers that she is black in this country. Outstanding!
B007SYWFRM|3.0|I enjoy playing this game.  I would recommend this to everyone young or old.<br />I have it on my phone, no cleansing iPod.<br />Anniemetoo64@yahoo
B0043ZDFEQ|5.0|I love all of Bruno Mars music.  He has such feeling and passion what he writes and sings about on his projects.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|I love this game  it is so cool you should really get it it is a statement of icons .
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Great love it helps alot for school i suggest that you think about getting it as well good luck with that and peace
B004H4XDBI|5.0|That impressed me! I was so glad that the story was continued and played out in another perspective. Such a great way to end the struggle of a romance by showing conflict, separation, and misunderstanding. I'm sure readers will enjoy this sequel!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|To say this book is amazing is an understatement. Couldn't put it down. Life-changing book that I already adore. Must read.
B007L6VR12|5.0|Best Movie EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I liked it a lot I thad a little bit of everything!It had enough quirkiness, enough sex, enough scariness, enough drugs, enough violence, enough language, enough comedy, and even enough stuff I didn't like!!! I highly recommend this movie to a fourteen year old. It will probably remain my favorite movie EVER!!!! caution, the kids have sex and the girl's MARRIED MOM has a secret relationship with Captain Sharp, the island police!! :( I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did!!!!!!!!!! :D
B00AWKZSNM|5.0|Have been using this for a few weeks now and it works exactly as described.  Just plug in your thumb drive and you have wireless access to your pictures and files.  Wish it were faster is my only suggestion.
B009NFHF0Q|1.0|A story about a boy growing up with some abuse from his father. After reading 70% of the book I gave up on trying to find a theme or any redeeming value to this fantasy.
B001PPGAJE|4.0|Good movie; better than I remembered.  I forgot how young Hugh Jackman looked in it.  Plenty of action and sarcasm from Wolverine.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This game is great fun.  Killer on Kindle Fire.  Smooth game play and the inclusion of upgrades a real plus.  Just plain fun.
B001U9BRNE|5.0|Great blu ray disc. This is my third one. All of my friends & family rave about it. They even have requested copies of it. Hence I have bought 3.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|very fun.  please make more levels soon.  I cant wait for them to be released.  ten levels is just a teaser
B00634GHJA|5.0|Convenient app that allows transfer of photos taken with my Galaxy S4 to my Kindle Fire HD. Works with WiFi, no cables needed.
B008P1EWIM|4.0|You can't beat this App for looks. It has almost everything you need to know about your weather. I say &quot;almost&quot; because it needs one more thing to make it perfect! It needs a radar map. I wouldn't put it on the screen when you first open the App (it's to pretty for that) ,but I do think it needs a way to get to one. I like in Oklahoma and stormy weather's a way of life here. We need a way to keep track of the storms and where they are moving to. If this App had that (or you lived where you didn't have tornadoes) ,  it would be a 5star rating easy!!
B008OOYALE|5.0|this game is so fun. I loved it It is the funest game ever!!! it is awesome its like you have your own kingdom _
B000EWD1KK|5.0|Danny Kaye's wide range of acting, singing, and ability to touch viewers' hearts make this entertaining film ideal for families and individuals. It's wonderful that films from the past are available to provide great entertainment by some of Hollywood and Broadway's best talent.
B009YG2ND8|1.0|Don't buy this for &#34;Kindle Tablet Edition&#34; buy the actual Google Play Market edition so that you can play it on other devices once the poor quality Kindle Fire HD Screen starts to flicker and die (happened to me twice and I just bought a Nexus).
B009AY04A8|3.0|This game is neither great nor horrible. It would be much better if the conversation speeds were more controllable as some of them go to fast while others are slow
B001JNND9W|5.0|Great movie and amazing quality! I recommend to any fan of the Dodge Challenger. The famous speech broadcast about his travels was even used in a Guns N' Roses song - Breakdown from Use Your Illusion II.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Loved every minute.  Can't wait for the 2013 season and see what happens now that Mathew has left the series.<br />The set arrived on time, no damage and functioned perfectly.  Great shipper.
B009CG29RK|5.0|We used this movie as family movie with our toddler son, and he knows most of it by heart now. There are clear &#34;good&#34; and &#34;bad&#34; people in the movie. And in the end, the world and the main characters are saved. I haven't seen the sequel yet, but I hope it is as good as this one. We have this movie downloaded on our iPad and it works wonders for the last couple hours of a ten hour drive to see Grandma!
0307341550|5.0|After getting 2 of Gillian Flynn's novels,I ordered this book,as all of her books are full of excitement,suspense,and unexpected twist and turns,that makes for a great read.I have ordered this writer's books for my friend who lives across the country,from Amazon.com,and she was thrilled with the 3 choices that I sent to her.Terrific book!
B005XQLBU4|3.0|Getting some ads even though it was a free app of the day and got extra junk files installed with the app.....
0143120530|5.0|This kind of book is my ideal book. It is packed with high quality information which is delivered in an interesting and compelling manner. The author weaves a great deal of scientific research and innovative insight into a captivating personal narrative of his journey in mastering mnemonic techniques. It is a highly enjoyable read and at the same time very informative.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|it is beautiffly produced and acted.  The characters are fully drawn & you can empathize with each storyline.  The costumes and setting are magnifiscent.  I especially enjoy the characters of Hugh Bonneville and Maggie Smith.  I have all three seaons on DVD and enjoy them often.  Looking forward to seaon 4.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|It starts off real good but as the book goes along Collins really dropped the ball on this one it lost its touch that the preivous books had but really I think its Collins just being lazy and sick of the series
0545259088|5.0|The book came on time and was what I had expected. It was in great shape and its a great read. Thank you
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I love the whole story of song of ice and fire. The author is brilliant and his detailed descriptions of all the characters and places keeps you glued to the pages. In this book, there are major events happening with Jon the wall and the wildings, Danny in Meereen and the dragons, and Stannis on his march and in Winterfell. Also one of our favorites tyrion and his misadventures and usual comic and amusing self. Not to mention new intriguing characters and twists but no spoilers will I reveal here.  It is a long book and there are some awesome cliffhangers so the story is not finished yet. Some people may find this annoying but I find it very exciting and eagerly waiting for the next book. In the meantime I am reading winter is coming which explains a lot of the mysteries and prophecies in the series in additions to tying it into history. What can I say I am just a real fan of Martin and his fantasy writing, although I consider myself a die hard history buff. It is amazing how I can enjoy something so different from history  but at the same time feels so real. It's all because of Martin and his story telling. So read on and enjoy!!
B008JFUPK8|3.0|I was hyped for this film knowing Christopher Nolan was the producer, but worried that Zach Synder was the director. What I got was a mixed bag. The action scenes are kinda cool, but Snyder doesn't let you enjoy it for much of the time, as there is something big happening after every minute. The actors did okay, nothing memorable. The characters weren't half bad, except for Lois Lane, completely useless. I will give the movie this, it had an awesome soundtrack, thank you Hans Zimmer. If you like the Christopher Reeve Superman, this one has alot more action, and a decent story, but adequate characters, sadly, even Superman.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|The Comcast is really neat but it needs more app support. hopefully the developer community catches up soon. Netflix and you tube are ok, Buford be better if it supported local media.
B00CL0J99K|2.0|I really enjoyed the first Iron Man, and Iron Man 2 (as boring as it was) was an okay movie. This latest installment was unsatisfying. The movie was cliche, characters were just annoying, especially Pepper and the kid, and the twist with the Mandarin, which wasn't half bad, had a terrible payoff. Many people enjoyed the action scenes, also okay, just don't grab you. My biggest gripe with the movie is the ending, just a rushed resolution. As a casual movie goer, it will keep you entertain, and does a good job at it. However, fans of the franchise, or non-casual movie goers, will find this movie the worst in the series. Hopefully when Iron Man 4 comes out, it won't be as bad as this one.
B009RH9J7W|4.0|Purchased it to keep the Kindle secure while traveling.  Would recomment it to a friend who likes to read while on a trip.
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|I am enjoying this game very much.  The different set- ups for the tiles make the game interesting.  Happy with my purchase.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Good game to pass the time if ur bored. Works hand eye coordination. Not overly hard to play this game.
B000Q04XDY|5.0|This was an informative and well written book. The author has done his research and is attempting to bring out information that most people are not aware of. I will never understand how anyone could follow a religion that promotes such violence and hatred even among Muslims. A religion started by a violent pedophile which still victimizes children and women to this day. We are in for a long fight.
B0061PEAUY|4.0|It was just what the doctor ordered. A little murder (no pun intended), a bit of Temperance a whole lot of mystery and the best part it took place  in the Tundra.<br /><br />It was a sad story. Starting off with a dead baby. Sad because  of all the lost souls. And even a  if continued to find th  humanity which Riech is so good at doing in this  lost bones was  wonderful.<br /><br />This was a very satisfying Temperance book for me. I have to remember  the book Bones is different than our TV Bones. I think this can be frustrating at times because they are  so different. It was  nice to see the story move on after all the change  in her  life at the end of the last book.<br /><br />Very happy I finally read it! Can' wait for the new  on in  week!
B009AY04A8|3.0|Love the game, but dislike having to start over from the first level. Would really like to play, then go on with life, and be able to go back and continue from where I left off.  That is the only thing I don't like about this game.  If that can be fixed I would give it 5 stars.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Great!  I enjoy playing in the middle of the night.  It lets you know you're not the only one awake.  It's fun that doesn't tax your brain.  I do wish you would actually get bingo more often and that credits were awarded for every bingo.
B00CWGLOY6|5.0|It rock's great read for adults I recommend it a comic book reader's comic just get lost in this story could not stop reading it
B00DURGZHW|5.0|It is a great movie. Very heartwarming story and adventurous tale of two boys and their journey to help a man for love.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|one of the best movies that i have ever seen words cannot explain how awesome this movie was done deal
B000FC1HBY|3.0|Hard to read and keep up with characters but once you get into it if hooks you.  Ending left you hanging with too many questions.  Had to buy the second book to see what happens.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|A great read for someone looking for motivation and inspiration to succeed. This is not an instruction manual on how to succeed but rather a tool to use to build self confidence to pursue your dreams without fear.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|Great scenery, acting, and story line.  One of the better movies I've seen this year.  Would watch it again.  If you like sci-fi, this won't disappoint.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|I am only wondering where they will go from here.  Now that the he has been exposed and his secret is out!
B003AKLFAG|5.0|I can't believe it took me this long to watch this movie! Now I understand why it's always ranked in the top-ten Asian films on almost all review sites. Do NOT read spoilers for this movie!
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I have enjoyed some other Mitchum Albom's books as well.  You cannot take life for granted -- do what you need to do today.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Completely head over heels for this book. Nothing can compare! Highly recommend it, I could hardly put it down.<br /><br />Heads up; it'll make you cry
B0052REQLK|5.0|I enjoyed all the chapters and wished I had read this book 20 years ago.  good book.  Thank you very much
B00AOCLWF6|4.0|I enjoyed falling skies. It started off slow, but picked up around episode three. I would recommend this to others
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Read this book because of it being picked for our book club. The characters are easy to get involved with, and I was so impressed, that I got the second book( read that in 1 week!!) Not too happy that the third book is not out as of yet, and I have read that it may not come out until 2014.
B003DT19F0|5.0|Lovely movie. Definitely worth watching with the entire family. It is fun and never boring. We are trying to collect them all.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Reminds me a lot of the old defender arcade game. Helps to be able to earn points to rebuild buildings and upgrades.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Very detailed and it feels like you are right there! Not only am I reading it, but my 10 year old is loving it as well!
0553801473|5.0|This book is in the series Game of Thrones, it is great. Love George R R Martin, hes the best
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This was hard but fun I wish there were a lot more levels. I can't wait for the next batch. Thanks for such a awesome game!
B009AY04A8|3.0|Basic hidden object game with a few interesting twists. Liked that  puzzles were interspersed in hidden object gameplay.<br /><br />Could zoom on most screens ,except find the difference which were really small and needed a zoom.<br /><br />Can skip dialog but I did not like having to open menu to skip tedious dialog every screen.<br /><br />I found it on the boring side really as there was little variation between levels. Finished game quickly and deleted as there is no replay value. Ok for a free app and maybe for 99&cent; but definitely not any more than<br /> that.<br /><br />Younger kids (8 or 9) would be an appropriate target for this game.
B008N1V11U|5.0|I love this app I am addicted to it  was worth the 3 dollars you can fly the bat and drive the bat pod.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Certainly a fun once you get use to it. Time flies by when you play this game because it's fast pace it builds up to takes your whole attention.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Fun game, good graphics, love playing the slots. You will lose credits tho and not get them back. And sometimes the game will end and not give a bingo
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|I'm not a fan of Tom Cruise, and this was not Morgan Freeman's best work. Having said that, this movie was a great mix of mystery and dystopian Sci-Fi that I find irresistible. The story was very engaging, and the characters had a sincere depth to them.
1451695195|5.0|I thought that &#34;Proof of Heaven&#34; was a very good book!  He described it very well the way he felt and what he saw.  I would recomend it for anyone!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Just wish there were move apps on board.  Love to see amazon prime instant video app!!!!  Other than that the thing has works perfect.
B008AIGWVA|2.0|Took FOREVER to download. Once downloaded, it was cute at first but just became a waste of time very quickly.
B004SDSSFY|5.0|I was leary about which office suite to buy. A friend recommended this one.I love it. I can do Word docs or PowerPoint presentations, etc...what's not to love? I believe that you'll be as thrilled as I am with this purchase.
B002UBRFDC|5.0|Shogun is a classic and James Clavell is a genius at portraying the complexities of the Japanese philosophies and traditions of feudal Japan.  He specializes in the Asian worlds for his books and I love all of them.
B004SDEP38|5.0|What's not to love? This office suite has improved the quality of my life. Who needs a laptop when everything I need is available here. Thank you.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|That book was amazing. I'm kind  crying right now. If he ever makes a sequel. I'll buy it. It was just an amazing experience  to add to my collection an  I just loved it. Especially isaac and Augustus.
B00632HWOG|1.0|I can't open since last update. I tried to reinstall and it has been stuck in downloading...mode for weeks.  This was an everyday app til this happened. I would really like to have it back.
B008I2OAEE|5.0|New Vocalist Silje Wergeland after Anneke Van Giersbergen turned solo this is the second album with Silje by far the best work the Gathering has done so creative and catchy its breathtaking and moving you will never want to put this album down listen again and again to think i was nearly not going to get this must have for fans of band and do check out Anneke Van Giersbergen solo work she has improved ten fold , best songs on album are Meltdown by far, Paralyzed another beauty and Heroes For Ghosts please check out you will love ok.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I have to say for $30 how can you not want to buy this?<br /><br />Pros -<br />1) My wife is able to move items to the TV a lot easier than she was with our Windows Media Center setup.<br />2) Setup was SOO easy<br />3) Small and out of the way<br /><br />Cons -<br />1) I expected more features, like screen sharing for presentations etc<br />2) No support for Windows 8/Office. I would like to have been able to play my PowerPoints through it. If it had that, I can assure you my company would have bought 50 of these.
B006II7SGW|5.0|Fast shipping. Great movie. Way better than the first. I was lucky I bought this for a great price. They wanted twice as much at other retail chains.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Amazing game for all ages. Always a challenge waiting around the corner. Never can get tired of these little fellas.
B000I3PERS|5.0|Decent movie, well directed, good balance of action/story/humor. I absolutely love the soundtrack. Historically insightful to some degree. I thought the characters were well played by the actors. And most importantly it wasn't cheesy
B003UESJHO|4.0|I liked the movie when I saw it in the theater. Wanted to own a copy of the movie. Christian Bale gave an amazing performance.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Love the old school concept with updated graphics and touch screen functionality with challenges.  Fun game to play.  Love the rebuild concept.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app is awesome!! You can open it anytime even if you have Internet connection or not. It'll tell you exactly the battery percentages unlike the battery of a smart phone whereas some count by 5's. It also keeps track of your battery percentages from when you first download it till the end of its days. It tells you when your battery is low even when you don't have Internet, so its always working. If you download this you wont be sorry!! :)
B0036S4B6M|5.0|I bought the book after watching the full first season of Orange is the New Black on Netflix. The book is even more compelling than the show. Kerman does an excellent job of describing her experience -- nerves, fears and all -- so much so that I felt as if I had gone through her journey, as well.
B00DUGCLY4|3.0|Some of them are hard but it is really fun! And anyone can play it and i love it!it is fin
B000002GB6|5.0|When this album was released in 1977 it really did define the sounds of the late 1970's especially the mega instrumental hit \\"Feels So Good\\". The song was recognized the world over and was played continuously on the radio. Chuck Mangione's trumpet made him a music superstar for at least 8 years afterwards and he wrote the music for the 1984 Olympics Opening Ceremony in Los Angeles.<br />The other songs on this album are great and can be played over again and put you in a nice relaxed mood. Chuck Mangione's music isn't heard that much anymore and that is to bad because it is great! If you are over 40 years old you will still recognize his unique sound and especially \\"Feels So Good\\". Highly Enjoyable CD!
B002TLSSXO|4.0|I like these utensils. So beautiful in color and useful in style, I have not used them yet. They seem durable though. Afraid to mess them up lol. I feel like a kid. sorry guys I could not give more feedback
B00003CXA6|3.0|Good acting by Martin Sheen as General Robert E. Lee, Tom Beringer as James Longstreet. Jeff Daniels as Colonel Joshua L. Chamberlain, Stephen Lange as General George Pickett, and C. Thomas Howell as Captain Thomas Chamberlain makes this interesting. No complaints about the acting whatsoever. If you don't know details about the Civil War or the battle, then this is a great movie with no complaints. BUT, if you are knowledgeable about the Civil War and the Battle of Gettysburg then you know it could of been much more. Ron Maxwell did a good job with this movie and I recommend that he re edits it and makes it more realistic. With the technology now it is possible to show more accuracy. Definitely take out the \\"pep rally\\"'before Pickett's Charge where troops swarm around General Lee. Though its an emotional scene, it would not have accursed and it did not occur. Especially during a battle and before a charge.<br />This was supposed to be the first of a trilogy of movies before the next movie by Ron Maxwell \\"Gods and Generals\\" hurt that idea. That is Shame since there are too few movies about the Civil War.<br />Gettysburg though is a good movie that sparked interest about the war and the battle, but For those who  know the Civil War and the battle it could of been so much more.
B00BOUL9DM|5.0|I think this is a really wonderful app my grandson and I love it and he's 3 years old he likes to play with this app all day and he's learning at the same time I want to look into the other apps that they make as well
B0025KVLU6|5.0|The White Album is the most unique album made by the Beatles and it was made during the time that John, Paul, George, and Ringo really began to write their own music individually. They supported each other, but on this album you can tell  that each one had their own music style.<br />Yer Birthday, Helter Skelter, Revolution, So Tired, Rocky Raccoon are just a few of the songs but my favorite ones. The hard rock chaotic guitar is not found on previous albums they did, but on this one they let loose, especially on Helter Skelter and Revolution. Rocky Raccoon is a mellow song and Yer Birthday is just an old fashion jam session song.<br />A unique album by the best band in Rock history make this an album that is highly recommended!
B003V5CFV8|1.0|It was stupid and I didn't like the fowl language, that is taking the Lord's name in vain. I definitely would not recommend this movie to anyone.
B003D5FFY0|5.0|After The Beatles break up in 1970, Paul Mccartney wrote many more wonderful songs with his band \\"Wings\\" or as a solo artist. These on this album are the best from his albums. Every song is excellent and were on the top of the music charts. From \\"Band on The Run\\", to \\"Jet\\", to \\"Live and Let Die\\", they are worth hearing again and again. This really is a good album and is Highly Recommended!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Very entertaining and full of excitement reminds me of simple run but a lil bit better please make more stages better ones

140006922X|3.0|This is the first book I've read dealing with this subject, and because of that, it had the potential of expanding my historical understanding of that time and those people, placing Jesus in the mix. However, I'm a critical reader, and I found myself constantly saying something like, \\"Hmm, that's interesting; what is his source for that?\\" However, Aslan writes like he's telling a story(his likely intention), a style which certainly has its pros, but for me, I was looking for a more \\"academic style\\", with sources cited, etc., so I could explore his claims further. He does include a large section in the back of what I take to be all his sources, but the information, given in that way, is limited in usage for much else than showing the reader how many books Aslan has read.
0765363836|1.0|People should know that the book and the show are completely different. I have never seen the show, and comparisons are unfair. The book was a boring waste of time. I have never cared less about the characters in a book. Great idea for a book, but this isn't it.
0399255370|5.0|Great book to read to preschoolers! Very funny! My preschoolers will love it! I'm in the process of finding some crayon puppets so each color can read it's own letter!
B004GXZ69W|4.0|Holding your wrist like this is weird at first, but once you get used to it, it's a great alternative to a regular mouse.
B006JPS1OM|1.0|Wish I read all the reviews before purchasing. Games has serious glitches that apparently G5 has no interest in fixing, I guess as long as people pay the $2.99 they won't. I have reloaded the game 3 times and have to start all over each time. Just terrible!! Ice loved G5 games in the past but no more
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I was one of those that bought this within minutes of it showing up on Amazon on launch day. I can't say for sure if I would have done that without the three months of Netflix, but I'm glad I did go ahead with the purchase. While the uses are very limited today, if the companies that have promised support for the Chromecast follow through, I imagine I'll change this to 5/5 instead of 4/5. Setup was easy, and using it is simple. It's inexpensive, and extremely portable. I may end up buying another to keep plugged into the second TV later on.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I use it for DIY, House chores solutions, decorating ideas. recipes, very easy to organize ideas. Use it daily (almost)
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Google in thee I trust.  Another product they knocked out of the park. There are very few apps right now that can really take advantage of it but the ones that can run flawlessly. There is so much potential here is ridiculous. And for $35, it's a no brainer
B00992CF6W|5.0|Hey guys it's me the famous youtuber wedgieninga I need to tell you about this game it's so fun I can spawn pig spawn cow spawn sheep<br />I can't stop playing this game it is so flipping fun u have to get its<br />Worth. I guess this is it thanks for reading :)
B006IGZX0C|5.0|Stellar and serious look into the culture behind racism in the south.  Deep and soul searching. Intensely sad, and uplifting
B004J4WLB4|5.0|It has been a while since I picked up a book started reading and had a hard time putting it down.<br />Not a mystery, not a thriller, but certainly a gripping drama. Opens our eyes to the foster care system and lost forgotten kids. Also certainly to mentally scarred and uneducated people, who can have so much to offer us.<br />This is really a brilliant book about family relationships and certainly finding home!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Easy to use. Several sound options.  Nice too see the temperature and have instant access to the weather.  The numbers are dimmable by sliding your fingers over them without having to go into your settings.  Overall, very pleased with this app.
B005V4ZEY2|1.0|I thought this was great until I lost 2 tablets.  Neither one survived reset like it was supposed to (was installed as system app in root.)  And some of my devices show incorrect locations even to this date (they show another country from 1 year ago!)
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|Other apps allow you to level up quicker without spending real money. And. It seems that the screen sensitivity is weak- you have to touch it sometimes multiple times to gather various items and at times it causes you to lose points in the game.
B001DUDKEY|4.0|I enjoyed this adaptation of Persuasion, but the script was a little disjointed jumping from point to point.  The item that bothers me the most, was the choice of music at the climax of the film.  It was unfortunate.  The entire movie builds to one moment where our hero and heroine finally see eye to eye, and what do they have in the back ground?<br /><br />A carnival.<br /><br />Yes, complete with loud music that overtakes the scene and ruins the moment.<br /><br />The music completely pulled me out of the moment.  Who wants to listen to goofy and silly music when the couple finally share a tender kiss? Then the film breaks away from the happy couple to show the details of the street parade, completely breaking up the scene. Carnival musicians, and clowns doing tricks.  Then eventually, it pans back to the couple, walking away hand in hand.<br /><br />For this alone, I'd like to rate it 1 star.  But the actors did a splendid job and I don't want to hold it against them.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love these puzzle type games.  It is similar to Endless Escape.  You need to find each item and then where you use it.
B000002KLG|5.0|Enjoying every bit of it. I will continue to order music. The price was just right.<br />No need to shop at best buys anymore.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I thought that there would be more things that I could cast from my device to my TV screen. Perhaps I imagined some of the things (other applications) like where I could show pictures on my Ipad and cast them to the TV as be an example.

B005LAII1C|4.0|I saw this in the theater and it made me laugh until I cried.  Takes an unexpected turn towards the end.  I thought it was funny enough to own.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Really fun game! I have been having a blast playing this game. There is no limit to how far you can go if you beloved in yourself! Row row fight the power!
1616550414|5.0|I got this as a gift for my girlfriend and she absolutly loved it. It was so worth the price to see her reaction. it is amazing quality and filled with so much stuff pictures and info, really big too. if you or whoever youre getting this for loves zelda you really cant go wrong with this book. So happy I bought it.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|The DVD collection was brand new when it arrived, still in plastic wrap. Finally got to complete my Star Trek movies collection.
B00D6SBOWG|4.0|It is great.  You can't get enough of playing it.  It is a fun way to play solitaire.  Can't stop.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Addictive! This games rocks! Good time pass. I love how it gets harder and harder. I wish though there was a way you could to continue the stage you failed at and not have to start all over
B0015XHQTE|5.0|Great collection with all 5 movies included! Also comes with extra dvd&#34;s, literature, and great stuff about how the movie were made! Learned that Frank Sinatra was the original choice, but had a hand injury and could not hold the gun! Lucky for Clint!!
B00ECUARO8|3.0|I liked this movie, but once again Hollywood has portrayed Arkansans as dumb, backwoods, people who don't go to the dentist. So untrue!!!
B005D4YHA2|5.0|Bump up your usual size by 1/2 when ordering.  Great sandal with firm sole and good traction.  Price changes for the different different colors and for different sizes.  Check other colors to save a few bucks.
B009PLKCEE|4.0|Great! In fact better than great. Plays everything I need - audio, audio  books,  avi, Iso - just like a real tablet!!
B00BTHWFEC|5.0|Just an awesome album after all these years. I'm a fan of Ozzy and Dio versions of sabbath but never cared for the ozzy albums after sabotage. Yeah never say die had a couple of good tunes but really I thought you could hear a definite decline in their music at that point. But now this! The band sounds fantastic and Ozzy sounds great (not in concert though). Whatever, I love that this album went to number 1 for a little while, they certainly deserve it. If you are a fan of the original sabbath GET THIS NOW! Let your kids hear what it sounds like when MEN play metal.
B009AY04A8|2.0|Good grief!  I am only interested in the games-not the incessant blathering by characters I could not care less about.  How totally irritating!!!
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|Good fun challenge. Wish more coins were available without purchase. Longer play without having to purchase coins would be better. Not too many ads which makes the game more enjoyable.
B00BX8PG4S|4.0|Submaroines have been around for a long time and the 1940's stories, with crowded  quarters in whic these men to operate create a heigtjened semse of drama.
B002APU580|5.0|I have always loved this Jane Austin book and the original movie with Greer Garson.  Although this movie takes license with the story, the chemistry between the main actors is stirring.  Great to watch on a rainy night with a glass of wine.
B0083GQ2A0|4.0|This was a murky movie good scenes and good acting.  But I wanted to have an electric to warm up my blood the end.

140006922X|5.0|After years and years of Hebrew school and Talmud study, I thought I knew Jewish history. I apparently, like Jon Snow, know nothing.  I can't begin to tell you all I learned from reading this book: about Jewish and Christian history, of the history of Judea at that time, how the anti semitism of the Romans led to lies being perpetuated in what was to become the Bible, about how the Bible was written, and the relationship between James, Paul and Peter, and how the destruction of the Temple led to the Jewish Diaspora and the rising of Christianity.  This well written and well researched book is a must read for anyone interested in the time period and the events, and anyone interested in religion. People will no doubt be offended, but if you read with an open mind, you might just learn something that helps you make sense of the world.  Highly recommended.
B0000UJDLM|1.0|I tired this in my DVD player today for first time and it wouldn't work. It kept saying  disc region incorrect I am not very impressed by this...
B0063IH60K|5.0|I really enjoy tnis game of solitare.  My mother is trying to teach me she is a friend to solitaire her whole life.
B005XQLBU4|3.0|an updated version of an old classic.  graphics are good, gameplay is simple.  Storage space is minimal.  easy enough Id say.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|This was typical of other Grisham books--quite a page turner.  I was however left wondering at the end of the book, who was really the bad guy--the racketeer.  I thought I had the plot figured out, but then the curve ball came.  All in all, I found the concept of vigilante justice too unsettling for me.  You might not agree; so give it a read.  Los Osos Girl
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Does just what it says. Completely happy with my purchase and my neighbor saw it and is completely jealous of it!
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|It really is a fun game. But when you get stuck on an emoji and you don't have enough coins, it does not allow you to skip. I think they should at least let you get hints for free if you are really stuck on one.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|In one word the Chromecast is developing. It is a fantastic solution for those with good wifi and a Netflix addiction. It is super simple to pull up the netflix app on your device of choice, connect it to the Chromecast and select your video. It all automagiclly appears on your TV! The only drawbacks for me so far (and these are sure to be fixed): It needs more content available, it needs to auto play Netflix tv episodes and youtube playlists, and last it needs to be able to stream local content from a Laptop or mobile device. There are a few developers out there that are working on the content issues, and I am very confident that google is working on the playlists. My only regret in buying one of these was only buying one! for $35 I should have gotten three for all the TVs in the house and for my girlfriend.<br /><br />On another note, I am not sure how well one of these will work with a network such as you'd find at a Hotel or on a College campus where it is open and the authentication takes place after connecting to the server through a browser, I will be looking at this aspect in about a week when I have access to both types of networks. The only other problem I can foresee is that if someone is connected to the network they can connect to your chromecast. Much like Glass Google seems to have forgotten to include some sort of password or pin protection to this device from the start, it is likely however that this will change in the future as Google further develops the SDK and development really takes off and becomes available to the public.<br /><br />In short if you are unsure of whether to buy one of these don't. You should buy three. They are fantastic and simple, exactly what has been lacking in this niche market. Its not a powerhouse, it wont stream Hulu, Amazon, or HBO Go (Yet...) but its also only a month old and the Hardware will support it. As Google gets more support from Amazon, HBO and the like more content will become available. So stop reading reviews and go hit that Add to Cart button, you will not regret it.iews and go hit that Add to Cart button, you will not regret it.
B001ECQ4DA|4.0|After several seasons of this show I finally started watching it and I'm not sure why I waited as long as I did. All the elements of this show hit every nail on the head for me. A funny show that mixes elevated humor with more crude humor and actually has a developing story line. Who would have thought this would be a good idea? Oh yeah, the guy behind Two and a Half Men, the show that present humor to the lowest common denominator of humanity, whoda thunk it? This is an amazingly well thought out show in the respect of the characters, while presenting certain character archetypes, which I'm sure will be mined for comedy gold in later seasons, we aren't left with mere empty shells of characters. Instead we actually get to love each character individually by the writers presenting the negative side to each characters oddity. Whether it be Sheldon's staunchness in his character and inability to easily adapt to new situations to Rajesh's inability to communicate with those of the female gender, we're presented with characters who are extremely intelligent but also deeply flawed, creating a situation that is hard to parallel and also hard to make a strong comparison to within this genre. While granted the show does still present itself within the sitcom genre and many of it's tropes, it manages to elevate itself above that with some intelligent writing and some brilliantly acted characters. Sadly the main female lead found in Penny is strongly lacking for me in many regards (let's see if they develop that later on) she is somewhat counter balanced by minor side characters like Leslie Winkle, is this enough to alleviate the bimboness that is Penny at times, obviously not but the end of the first season does lead toward some character develop in that regard. I'm excited that I've finally started to watch this show because I've long felt that with a handful of exceptions (Modern Family, the first few seasons of Raising Hope, 30 Rock - who now that I think about it have much stronger female characters) the sitcom genre is dying a painful death in front of our eyes. With these shows revitalizing our perception and expectation of not only the genre but also what is and is not funny, I have some hope for this uniquely American creation.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|A fun look at the culture of amplified electric Music. The drama and technology that allowed bands with terrific talent and stories to tell, capture the magic for all of us to listen and enjoy.
B0081BU42O|5.0|Loved the story. I am a little biased having enjoyed all of the Culture series. Shame no more will come.
B000PAAH3K|5.0|I really enjoyed reading the book. It should help improve a wide range of  decision making. It is an easy read.
B006PKV2QU|5.0|\\"I Think It's A Rock\\" is the third children's book by Author Peter Collier that I've read and reviewed. I noticed in the book description provided by the author, that it is actually his first children's book. I must say that thus far, it is definitely my favorite.<br /><br />I think it provides a great learning experience. It utilizes both rhyme and repetition to enhance this educational opportunity for its young 3-4 year old reading audience. The illustrations by Cam Craig are absolutely delightful and will certainly add to the pleasure of this children's book. I enjoyed the creative and imaginative approach of trying to guess what is really so bothersome in the sock of this young boy in the story...is it really a rock?  Just check it out to be sure...I'm still not convinced!<br /><br />Inspirational Author & Book Reviewer ~ Dolores Ayotte<br />[[ASIN:B00A53FXMC A Woman's Voice ~ Inspirational Short Stories]]
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This movie is one of the funniest movies I have ever watched.  I will really enjoy the number 2 when it arrives in the mail.
B005BZQVJ8|3.0|Two potty-mouthed sci-fi nerds from England, potty-mouthed Kristin Wiig, and a potty-mouthed little gray alien named Paul (with voiceover by potty-mouthed Seth Rogen) ride around the desert in an RV while being chased by bumbling, potty-mouthed secret agents intent on returning Paul to Area 51 so his brain can be sucked out for research.  And there you have it.<br /><br />The decision to just say the F-word every three seconds in lieu of jokes is too bad, because it's a cute idea for a movie with some clever concepts:  a wise-ass alien with bad driving skills crashes his spaceship, gets picked up by the U.S. military and ends up being the source of all our stereotypes and notions about aliens on Planet Earth (except for the anal probe.  Paul disavows all knowledge of that one).<br /><br />PAUL has a good heart, unless you're one of those Christians who thinks the earth is 4,000 years old.  And PAUL's credentials are pretty hefty, with a cast of A-list actors, plus the actual voice of Steven Spielberg as he receives sci-fi filmmaking tips from Paul. But even with all that talent, PAUL, while ostensibly a sci-fi send-up, is little more than an extended chase scene with all the predictable conventions of chase movies.<br /><br />It's supposed to be a comedy, but I think I laughed twice.  The trailer has all the jokes.  Watch it a few times and you're good to go.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|The game is absolutely amazing I can't think of any better words to describe it. It's like I just can't get enough of this game I play it all the time and I even accidentally bred a spring dragon. The spring has made me so much money. I won't stop here I want more seasonal dragon's.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|This small device essentially serves as Google's interpretation of Apple's AirPlay (of course with their own twist).  I still find myself using AppleTV over Chromecast, but for someone with more Android devices or no AppleTV, this would be an excellent option.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I love missile c command and this game is comparable to the classic Atari game. I like that it is finger touch and shoot a lot easier to play than the other missile games available
B007AL48UK|2.0|There are no rules provided.  Having never played the game before I can only surmise that it is based on Fizzbin, the Star Trek game,  where the rules change intermittently.  I surmise this because it does not come with any more info than match the tiles to the edges.  Which works sometimes but not always.  Further, the games states pick a level.  There is no place to go into settings to select the level.  All you get is configurations of summer related stuff like boats.  Tried playing the game and kind of get it.  At one point I did something that made the game give me a level one or a demo game but have no idea how to do this again so I can practice.  On the positive side, the game is attractive.  I can only give this two stars.  Maybe the iTunes version is better.  The other good thing was that the app was free on Kindle.<br /><br />Since I am new to android apps thru the Kindle I do not know if the developers are less skilled than those who use the apple iOS?  Is this the pattern?
B0036S4B6M|1.0|That Jenji Kohan could turn this dull, poorly written chronicle of Kerman's term in prison into a brilliantly funny, compelling series, replete with extraordinary characters, attests to her genius. Kerman has no powers of description, no idea of form; the book is a shapeless mass of people who never come to life, incidents that sometimes recur as if she'd forgotten she'd already mentioned them. It's as if it was culled from a teenager's diary. It's awful!
B006TLFPKO|3.0|You need to see the previous installments in this series (3) in order for this to make much sense. You must also see this installment for the last one to make any sense. Kind of a Catch 22.
B0031QUTBA|5.0|You pay for what you get, I suppose.  No box comes with this set, but all of the episodes are there with all of the &#34;extra&#34; cut scenes.  The cases are pretty slim, and don't take up tons of space on the shelf.
B005XQLBU4|3.0|Itcould be better. The gameplay is kindA lame after 3 levels youre bored and instantly want to play a game youbeat before again
B00CHMBQ0C|3.0|I was neither thrilled or disappointed that's why I rated as I did.  In this day and age with all the trailers, etc. out there,<br />you get what you want.  I think you need to update your guidelines and remove DVD's from your listing.  Personally, I<br />wouldn't recommended this DVD, that's my perspective.  I have and intend to keep getting my DVD from Amazon.com,<br />(Prime) two day free shipping, but I getting tired of these stupid questions about DVD's and batteries.  Other Products I can understand, you need to do some work on your rating/feedback vehicle.  Common sense would be a great start.

B005LAII44|4.0|Of course I liked it, I saw the movie and the only reason I brought it from Amazon.com, that's where I presently get all my movies, and I intend to purchase the series.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|This game is great, just like playing with ur buddies...subtracted one star for having to pay coins which limits how many games u can play if ur cheap like me :)
B00E5Q1LTY|2.0|As a non stop series of violent fights and battles<br />This movie is clearly aimed at entertaining the kids who are more interested in violent confrontations.<br />Science exploration physics and educational concepts were not on the bridge for this.
B00CL68QVQ|1.0|The quality of the movie is very poor. The movies sound cuts out and goes to static every five minutes. I wish I could get my money back.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I enjoyed this entire series from start to finish. It is a completely unique story, unlike anything I've ever read. It's a series that you won't want to put down!
0765325950|1.0|MINOR SPOILER:<br /><br />I was a freshman in high school when I read the first book in this series. I followed this story through high school, college, graduate school, marriage, birth of my first child and pregnancy with my second. YEARS of rereads, discussions, cross-referencing, etc. And how did this series end? With a bunch of eyebrow waggling, poorly done George RR Martinesque killings, and bland story telling. Seriously, Aliivia helped Rand die by packing a getaway bag for him?!?!<br /><br />Sanderson is not very good at colorful detail or setting atmosphere. He writes good dialogue. But that's about it. Honestly, these last 3 books ruined the series for me. I had planned on re-purchasing the entire series as a collector's edition but now I don't see the point as I won't be rereading them anymore.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This is lots of fun in a small package. Got it free today and have played most of the day. The levels are fun and can't wait to try and win, if there is such an ending level!
B00699SDR8|5.0|Wow.  This man knows how to weave a story in a poetic and artistic way that few authors master after a lifetime of writing.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Loved it!  Enjoyed the humor and the actors were well suited to each other made the movie fun to watch.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Did not have time to read this book.  I will try to find the time later.  I am sure it is worth the wait.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works as advertised. I was lucky enough to get it first day with the netflix code so the thing cost as much as dinner.  It does everything it says. Some people want to cry that it doesn't do things they hacked together and reversed engineered.  Well a company has the right to change their own product in the background and has no obligations to accommodate what you think you know. They offer an SDK to people who want to properly develop for it.
B004I744AS|5.0|I use this app all the time. It's great.<br />Download it. It's a lifesafer when you need<br />a definition to understand a sentence.

B00AC8ZJ6K|4.0|At first I thought this film looked low budget and cheesy - Was I ever wrong.  The effects and Animation is top notch and brings to life the entire Halo story and saga.
0345442970|4.0|I wanted to pick this book up when it came out in 2001 and for some reason I just never got around to it. I finally decided it was about time I finally bought and read this book and I am so glad that I did. If you liked The Phantom Menace you really owe it to yourself to read this book because it does a great deal of telling you what is going on before the events of the movie. It talks about why the Trade Federation needed to set up their blockade of Naboo, it gives some great character development into Chancellor Vallorum and Senator Palpatine and also explains why Vallorum was facing accusations of corruption in The Phantom Menace. And best of all it has a great action story that revolves around Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan. It has pretty much everything I hope for in a Star Wars novel.<br /><br />The only slight downside to this book is the politics can slow it down a little but the action usually comes right back in to pick the book right back up again.
B000HL2J0G|3.0|this series was full of half truths and plenty of Hollywood special effects to make the show some-what fun to watch.
B005XQLBU4|3.0|Not sure I would buy, but it is an ok free game of the day. And really thats about all I have to say about it.
B0013WI0PQ|4.0|this is a great movie and I truly like the music and story line that made this a great story and something to enjoy
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|First of all, let's get this out of the way. No, this isn't a Roku or Apple TV. It's not even a Google TV. But that's fine. This tiny device does what it is designed for, and it does it well.<br /><br />Setup was a breeze. Just plug it into the TV, grab the Chromecast app on your Android device, and you're essentially done. The two devices will find each other, then you'll be asked for a few basics to finish the setup process (wireless network settings, naming your Chromecast, etc.). That's it. No complicated menus. No sliders, buttons, widgets, or whatnots to mess with.<br /><br />Once it's ready to go, operation from an Android device is simple and nearly seamless (assuming you have a recent enough device - the Droid Bionic, for example, doesn't use the version of Netflix with the chromecast button). Being able to search Netflix and YouTube straight from a phone or tablet and then throw it up on the TV is awesome. Sure, you can do those things on a PS3, Xbox, etc., but that involves a clunky on-screen keyboard or an extra peripheral to worry about charging. Google Play integration is a nice bonus as well. You don't even have to login to any service since you're already connected on your phone.<br /><br />Best of all, Chromecast streams directly from the internet, freeing up your phone for other things. Once you've told it what to play, Chromecast happily goes on about its business whether your phone stays connected or not. There are ways to make Chromecast play local media, and that's the one place that it can choke depending on your wireless network. But, as I said before, it's not designed to be an Apple TV.<br /><br />It's still early, so there aren't a lot of apps that offer Chromecast integration yet, but it's coming. And at $35 (or $11, essentially, if you were lucky enough to snag one of the Netflix promotions), it's not a deal-breaker to have limited support out of the gate. Hulu, Pandora, and HBO (to name a few) should all be coming shortly, which certainly makes the price look even better.<br /><br />I would absolutely buy a Chromecast again if I had a need for another, even at the full $35. And I would definitely recommend it to anyone with an Android device (I can't speak for the Apple side of things) who is interested in streaming any sort of media to their TV.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|it's fun to play when watching tv. Wish it had more floors to play and not forced to fill out a review to get more games.
B0073U2F12|3.0|Bought this movie because got excited having bluray 3D but movie did disappoint me. Can recommend the movie but not as 3D. But worth to see it and rate it on your own.
B009KEN87O|5.0|One of the most enjoyable games I've ever played, not just among Android games. Loved it, took the time out to beat all three difficulty levels. A must play. Perfectly well balanced in all respects. The tetris and block breaker levels mixins are a nice touch!
B004DLPXAO|4.0|Although I am having difficulties with Froyo and Kindle talking on my original Galaxy Tab, I am able to use the iPad & desktop versions for much of my reading activities.  Planning a new Android device soon and will definitely be including this product on it and all allowed devices...
B003G4W49C|5.0|5/5<br />Everyone should read this book! I felt sick while reading the first part, and wanted to throw the book away when I read about Enders final game. This book is one of the best books I've read, but I almost wish I never did, because it's awful. The way they treat the children - just awful.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Great read. Twists and turns I the story until the very end.  The characters and their connections keep the reader interested.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Enjoyed..hints and everything worked perfectly but after unlocking full game didn't seem to last much longer to solve. Would have given a five but when you offer something for free and then you pay $4,99<br />to unlock should be able to enjoy playing for a lot longer.
034580404X|2.0|Not an expert on B&D but this is real darn boring.  The McDonald's of sex.  Lotsa words but not much else.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Awesome and thought provoking . Love Pam's style of writing. Can't wait to try the experiments. After you read the book, lets get together and discuss. Lets see what we can create together!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Works, does everything it is supposed to do with the few apps available.<br /><br />Bought it with the idea that future development(apps)  will really open up a lot of capability for the device.<br /><br />I like the idea that it could offer much more than the limited channel selection of the Apple TV.  Apple locks down their products too much.<br /><br />I would given 5 stars if there were more apps.
B00DRPVE3M|2.0|I love uno but I stopped playing because it kept telling me I have multiple games under one screen name and I don't. Very frustrating!
B006JRY8V0|4.0|I now have a new series to look forward to. Thank you FX!!! I'm thankful I was introduced to the SOA program. I have really enjoyed it.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love the game it's not just something to do the court same rapping and recreation of the auburn court university raymond James and I think we can make r pithy and help us join the conversation about it
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is better than the first. There are more elements and stories to follow. Looking forward to the movie version.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|It is like a simple version of the old school Missle Command. For some reason the sound doesnt work for me. No big deal there.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Mindcraft Is fun! And theres always new mobs like my favriot the gast or zombie pigman and last spider jokey !!! And if your lucky you can find a herbomine wich is Steves brother he tried to kill you can find him in abandoned mines with white eyes.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|this game is really good but every time I go it it just turns off I think its my kindle fire
B0021L9MJG|5.0|Great childhood pastime for me. Great director, great stories, awesome comicbook presentation. Now I just need a couple more words
0425263924|2.0|I was very disappointed with the ending.  I loved the previous books and enjoyed this book until the last few pages...I was glad I was home alone because I literally yelled WTF at the book!!!! I was sooo mad how I was left hanging and just anticipating future books. I texted all my friends who suggested this series :( How could it just end like that...to find out there will be 5 books. Ms.Day what are you thinking???? I'm regretting starting this series.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|It so fun to guess these emojis. It also teaches parents about texting! I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes texting.
B003UV8TFE|5.0|Although I never took a course from Dr. Lewin, I have watched some of his classes on YouTube.  I felt privileged to be able to read this book and get to know the professor a little better.  As a starting teacher in a second career, Dr. Lewin is an inspiring figure.  Plus, after reading the book, I am a much better rainbow finder; the book gives fun tips on finding them.
B00785P2QC|4.0|All ways gives you a reason to be on the app. Many quest. And of course leaving a review is one of them. So have fun with this app...
B004EBT5CU|5.0|What an album.  This is what one needs to add to their music collect.  Songs the warm the heart and touch the soul.
B0038P59A0|4.0|Good movie, lots of action and very good acting. I enjoyed the acting and the settings (late 1800's) more than the story.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Became my most used multimedia gadget! Simple, intuitive and great value for money! We stopped watching telly and moved to YouTube and Netflix entirely.
B00E8B1P9M|2.0|I was really looking forward to some mindless, tough guy/gal action, but they stuck in all this kung fu stuff and while that actually had some of the better \\"effects\\" it just didn't mesh.<br /><br />I ended up thinking about what was going on (always a bad idea with movies of this ilk) and of course it all makes no sense, so the mindlessness that is required was no longer possible.<br /><br />It became an effort just to finish the stupid, idiotic morass.
B005MMY9A8|5.0|But why do I have to keep writing more words in this rating?  I'm glad to give it a star rating but tired of figuring out what to say in the comments!
B00006LJ6X|5.0|Chicago VII (7) for those that are Roman numeral challenged, Chicago's music is timeless!!!! Great music and great service, thanks Amazon!!
1452126577|5.0|If you want a feel good book or a nice gift for the perfect person, don't get this one. It is best for someone who needs deeper lines from frowning and a harder scowl to scare those little girls and their cookie sales. Have a grumpy day.
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|If you could exhume William Shakespeare today, bring him back to life, and make him watch \\"Warm Bodies,\\" he might just exclaim, \\"Damn!  Why didn't I think of that?\\"  But then again, Mr. Shakespeare would only be so modest.  And his choice of words might be slightly different.<br /><br />So this story has been told before, so many times that you probably can't keep count.  It's the old corpse-meets-girl-corpse-loses-girl-corpse-gets-girl-back story.  But this story has a really nice feel to it, so even though you've seen it all before, it feels fresh, even though some of the characters may smell like rotting flesh at the beginning.<br /><br />And I really liked Teresa Palmer here.  She had that Amanda Seyfried thing going on; she kind of looks like her, and even though their acting styles are slightly different, they both are very solid actors.  And the rest of the cast is also very good, surprisingly good; usually, in films such as \\"Warm Bodies\\" the casting director and producer always seem to sacrifice acting talent because, well, they probably think that the demographic for a Zombie film doesn't care about acting.  They probably feel that the audience is as dead as the zombies on screen.  Luckily for us, this film does not make that common mistake.<br /><br />While this film is obviously a take on \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" -- note that the lead male's character here is named \\"R,\\" could it be short for \\"Romeo\\"? -- the themes are somewhat different.  One theme that I picked up on here was:  \\"The world becomes a better place one person at a time.  Or at least, one corpse at a time,\\" I suppose.  There are other themes, such as \\"Accept people for whom they are,\\" but it doesn't come across as some lame public service announcement.  It is always done with humor.<br /><br />So, to Mr. Shakespeare I might say, \\"Don't be so modest, and don't worry about your legacy.  They are safe for the ages.\\"  And to everyone else I'd say, \\"Don't be a corpse.  Dig yourself up from the couch andgo see 'Warm Bodies' in a hurry.  Or at least as fast as you are able to walk, being half dead and all.\\"  It just might change you, and change you for the better.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|I love the show so of course I enjoyed the book. I just pictured it like a episode of Castle.
B009AY04A8|4.0|This game would be more enjoyable without all of the dialog. The graphics are clear and crisp. The game is challenging. If you Don't mind the dialogue, this is a great game.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|i really enjoy books that involve mental health... this book kept me guessing for sure, right up until the very end. interesting and difficult to put down.
B009LQKHIO|2.0|Megan, having lived through a life of abuse, has moved to Pride after her brother's death in order to start over.  Todd is Megan's neighbor and was her brother's best friend.  The attraction between the two is instantaneous but can Megan trust another man enough to allow him any control over her life?  The story of the two is a good story but I would have enjoyed it more in a shorter book.  The book is filled with descriptions more than interactions between the characters.  If you enjoy reading books where everything is described in detail, then you will enjoy this story.  Jill Sanders did a fabulous job helping you get to know and like the characters, as well as make the romance believable.
B0027MJU00|4.0|was totally in love with gone girl and needed some more gillian flint. this was good, but not quite as good. it kept me guessing, had lots of twists and turns and i love how she uses the multiple perspectives. not recommended for late night reading.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love this game...a lot better than 100 doors!! Must try out this game you will not be disappointed..but I got to warn you...it's. very addictive!!
0143035711|5.0|This was an excellent book. I had never read anything by an actual helicopter pilot in VN and this brought it to life.
B008M4MB8K|5.0|OK, I can't compete w/Mr. Piper's # of times viewing it, & I agree with most of his conclusions, but I've seen it many times, & I believe she said...\\"Have you seen OUR owl?\\" - not \\"MY owl?\\" (nitpicking, to be sure...)...<br />  Also, Ridley Scott directed 3 masterpieces (his 1st 3 films) - \\"The Duellists\\", \\"Alien\\", & \\"Blade Runner\\"...since then he has produced an incredible string of b-movies, starting with \\"Legend\\", & finally disappointing legions of rabid fans (including myself) with his Alien \\"pre-quil\\", \\"Prometheus\\"....I've watched the \\"Dangerous Days\\" documentary, & it truly is fascinating & comprehensive (right up there with \\"Battle for Brazil\\" as best documentary...)....Perhaps Ridley needs Fancher or Peoples again to produce a suitable script?........
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I love historical fiction and this one does it as well as any. Whenever a book makes me want to look at photos, speeches and maps, you know it has you.<br />His best in a while IMO.
B005HSL626|5.0|I love playing this game on my kindle and ipod touch. So much fun and I keep playing and my brother loves it too
B00138KG8O|5.0|From beginning to end, De Lucia, McLaughlin, and DiMeola take us to a wonderful musical experience. This is one of the greatest guitar concerts in our lifetime.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Very true to the books, I will say my most major problem is with the extensive graphic sex and nudity scenes. Characters just how I imagined them and the acting in awesome! This is a must watch tv show!
1939416019|1.0|I was recommended this book being told the series was great, but the constant, constant misspelt/misused words really take away from the experience. It's like the author couldn't decide how to spell a name, and decided to use both versions multiple times within the same sentence. I can look past an error here and there, no problem, but this is PLAGUED by grammatical errors, so much so, that a high schooler could have had edited it and done better, that is, if it actually had been edited in the first place!<br /><br />Secondly, the whole plot is about this boy, Thorgrin (Thor), who happens to have everyting go his way, finds favor with the kind and has an easy, unmilitary-like experience in his training. It was very unrealistic, even for a fantasy book. I could not handle the blatant grammatical errors, or the quite frankly unoriginal and crappy plot.<br /><br />If you're looking for a good fantasy read, do NOT read Morgan Rice, read the Wheel of Time series, or The Riyria Revelations.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Good game it's free for the most part until u want new gear graphic are good for the kindle I could play for hours and not get bored
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Fun game that takes you back to the early arcade games.  Would be better with more sound effects, but still very good.
0307719774|5.0|My daughter and her two children are making some pretty significant life style changes.  I gave her this book so that she could chart her course and look back five years from now and enjoy her progress.  As I reviewed it, I found the questions both significant and challenging, light hearted and warm, yet still in-your-face bold, which, if she takes it to her most honest place will stir creative thinking and new approaches to solving life's problems....<br />The book only requires a few lines and a moment or two of reflective thinking.  It doesn't ask for a person to throw their life story onto paper.  I'd love an electronic version for myself.
B0009WFELY|5.0|I purchased the vinyl version of this album a week ago. Originally I had the mp3 versions of all the songs, but just wanted more. And every time I play it, I wonder; Why do I absolutely love this album? The composition of each song is odd, and often cacophonous, and yet the tone it creates and the way it immerses you into a cheery yet brooding mood is exactly why I love it. It's difficult to explain why one likes music, but I for one do enjoy Illinois. It's definitely not an album for everyone so be wary of that. In fact, most people give me a funny look when I play this record and say it's one of my absolute favorite albums, as they know me as a hardcore Beatles/Radiohead/Led Zeppelin/Black Keys fan. So all in all, don't buy this album unless you know what you're getting into. Sufjan Stevens is the kind of voice that grows on you so give it a chance, and if you still don't like it, buy yourself a nice safe Mumford record and listen to that. I for one will stick with Illinios.
B005LAII80|5.0|Karl Urban gives an amazing performance as Dredd, in an exceptional rendition of the British comic character. The story line itself is gripping, very reminiscent of the original Die Hard. The special effects, especially the 3D scenes of \\"Slo Mo\\" are quite good in an old school sort of way.<br /><br />If you have become weary of the over CGI mega-flops that Hollywood is constantly belching out, and you want a fun, fast thrilling movie...then prepare for judgment.
B00846REIS|2.0|It might be written better than 50 Shades but the plot was even lamer and it had whiney needy characters without real personalities.  If you're reading it for the sex, it's pretty much the same all through the book....boring.
B00DZVKQGY|4.0|This book is about losing oneself, only to discover that all is not lost if you have faith that you will be healed.<br />Getting deeper and deeper into this book, I kept thinking to myself how sad and lonely this life of guilt must be for Amanda.  All the loss and betrayal that she went through would wear even the strongest of people down.  But Amanda's spirit kept her alive and in doing so, she was able to bring back hope to her family.<br />Throughout the story I caught myself from being bothered by the actions in which she kept getting herself into the different situations, but realizing that she had to go through them to Find Her Feet.  In the end, that is what she does.  And even though there is more loss, it was  just the right ending to complete Amanda Spencer's life.
B0050DZ8J0|3.0|Sometimes cumbersome for those not fervent in social medis. And they are always inventing categories for endorseme nts for you to give others, or them to give you. Maybe that is a bit over the top , but I am endorsed for a lot of stuff I never considered myself involved in.<br />Beats facebook.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Love the game...Love this format . I only wish that the &quot;purchasables&quot; were less expensive . I would be more inclined to buy some.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|Classis need I say more we purchased this book on audible thought a amazon as well. Good book. Ok read!
B00CATSONE|5.0|This book not only gives you an insight into Telsa's life, but it inspires you to never stop learning and never stop trying.
B000HX4ZF6|5.0|First time watching the movie, lives up to the hype. Great story, cinema and musical score. Makes you feel like you're back in the 12th-13th century. Surprised that Mel Gibson directed and starred in it, talk about talented.
B005ISZRES|5.0|This has always been one of my favorites and I am thrilled that it can begotten for free on kindle. It is such an uplifting book and full of morals more young girls should be brought up learning. If I ever have a daughter, I will definitely be reading it to her regularly.
B00C9U9YOC|5.0|I like QOTSA and this album is by far their best.  I've listened to it at least 20 times already and it still is impressive.
B007A4SDCG|5.0|I listen to several business blogs and this book is referenced to time and time again. It's great. I bought the Kindle version first then the print version because I want both my sons to read it. This book is a must read if you have challenges with procrastination. I take time to read books but this one I read in two sittings. I highly recommend it!!
B005LAIGN2|4.0|I like the dvd but this was not what i expected i was looking for a little more detail about the flying Red Tails and<br />what they went through to become AirMans.<br />  Thank you  John
1439153663|5.0|Would recommend to a friend. The book will keep your interest. I like the fact that the book takes you back to that era because it is very descriptive.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Well lets just say I'm now watching Season 3. I watch about 3 episodes a day. I'm even starting to sound as though I'm from<br />Candleford.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|this game is more challengeing and fun than I expected. I would say get it if you are looking for a game that you want to be able to play for ten min here and there.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|It is an epic puzzle game! I have had this for about a year and I still haven't beaten it! So try and get this app!
B00499NHLC|5.0|The Brits really now how to make a joke very subtle. I wish american TV could do as good a job.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|I love this game but there need to be more vehicles in it. the levels are hard the ferther you go Wichita is cool
B006DJ2JSI|3.0|Not nearly enough words. 50% of the time that I go to  look up a word, it isn't there. I know it's free, but you are either going to be a full on dictionary, or don't bother and make a better one that we have to pay for. It's better than nothing, but it is infuriating when I come across a word in a magazine or newspaper, refer to the Merriam Webster dictionary on my Kindle HD Fire and I can't get it defined. I might just as well stick with my old school paper dictionary! But who wants to carry around 2 kilos of a dictionary in your handbag!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|An amazing device.  \\"casting\\"  Netflix or YouTube from an Android phone or tablet is seamless and in high definition quality.  It is also possible to cast video streaming on your computers Chrome browser to the device en full resolution.  this seems to require a fairly modern computer and a good wifi connection. I am using and i5 Mac mini and a $35 Asus wireless N router. the trick is that when streaming video opens in a popup window you copy the URL and paste it back into a regular chrome tab. Then you simply cast that tab and voila its on your TV screen.<br /><br />There were some minor issues with the Actiontec verizon fios router that are documented on internet forums. I eventually got it set up but decided to purchase a new router since the wireless and was much faster and provide better coverage.
B008YKGQR4|4.0|So far, this is proving better than another FB app, the format is how I like it, plus you can zoom in and out as you wish, to see the type better. One problem I found out later is that about half of peoples photos are distorted by being stretched. Won't be using it for much longer unless this factor gets fixed!
B000UD08HW|5.0|This Blu-ray disc is like watching the show live if you have a 52&#34; TV and a home theater system.
B0067R0APK|4.0|I found it very usable, informative, and just what  I need hour by hour to tell me what is happening with the weather! Not to mention what is happening in other parts of the world where friends and relatives live. Good one.

B004XIZN5M|5.0|Excellent read, this book is great for anyone. Even better for lifters who are looking to strengthen joints and tendons.<br /><br />Very informative and extremely detailed. I have recommended it to everyone.
B003V6L94Q|3.0|I only like one song on this CD; however, I'm not a Zac Brown fan except for that one song.
0143112724|5.0|Who would believe that Elements of Style by Strunk and White would incude full page, colorful art  among pages that advise readers and writers about the active and passive voice, adverbs, nouns, pronouns,independent clauses, as well as excellent advice to writers,such as, \\"work with nouns and verbs \\"\\"do not overwrite,\\" \\"do not explain too much,\\" and so much more. This classic,that most of us were required to own in high school and/or college, may be delighted to see among these \\"serious\\" pages are colorful  illustrations by Maira Kalman . I am a published writer and a writing instructor and have had  several copies of Elements of Style since my school days and I certainly use it in my writing classes because it is extremey useful, because of its clarity, because the explanations are condensed, and the original  version itself is small enough to place in a  handbag, tote bag or a pocket. The slim  paperback is 71 pages and the new, illustrated paperback is 153 pages, both are available. I have both; the original  and when I discovered on Amazon.com  that  there was a new,  illustrated version, I couldn't resist purchasing it; for its festive addition of stylized, colorful illustrations of mountains and trees;  figures  in brightly colored clothes,fanciful images of rooms of a home (bedroom, living rooms),  images of an old fashioned couple on an outside bench.  These stylized,  playful and brightly colored illustrations, among pages on grammar and effective writing , is a delight to me. And on the cover is an illustration of a long-eared, sad-eyed pooch on a pink background. Perhaps that image was chosen for the cover to let us know that this edition of Elements of Style, is not  only educational but also  joy-filled and amusing. .And perhaps that pooch is asking you to take him home.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|missile defender is an amazing application and I'm doing this for 50 free repair points its provided a couple of hours of fun Thank You Amazon for the free app. I'm glad that they're adding new challenges, when I play this year ago there were no UFO's
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|I like the historical perspective and the real life challenges that were posed by livng under Roman Empire domination in Israel. I like that the book does not in any way challenge the divinity of Jesus Christ and thus does not contradict christian tradition. The description of the development of christianity through Peter, Paul and James was very interesting.<br />It was a good read. very interesting and enlightening.<br />Demonstrates mankinds struggles throughout the ages: The rich and powerful dominating the society, oppressing the masses and hoarding the economic wealth of the nation and land. The betrayal of the population by rich and temple &#34;priests&#34; in order to retain their own wealth and pay tribute/taxes to ROME. The savagery of the conqueors and the ruler of the people was gutt wrenching.<br />Crucifixion was the norm, punishment for individuals who &#34;threatened&#34; the power structure.
0064471837|5.0|Probably around two years after finishing the last book in the Keys to the Kingdom series, I was finally able to read Sabriel by Garth Nix. I was not disappointed. This is brilliant, with just the right balance of action and romance. Of course, it's written like most Garth Nix books - extremely confusing at first, gradually making more sense, and then leaving you in a state at the end where you're not sure if you completely understand anything or if you just think you do and have no idea what's actually going on. I love it.
0143122916|4.0|Eye opener. Had no real understanding about the brutality of the prison camps in North Korea. Still puniishing participants and their heirs for Korean War offenses.<br />The brutality is just gutt wrenching. The personal experiences of the writer are horrific. He made me realize the inhumane treatment being thrust upon their own people by the dictatorship. It is disgusting and the human rights violations are atrocious.<br />Every day, I now pray, that these compounds, WALLs must be torn down and the perpetrators of atrocities upon children should be punished.
B009AY04A8|3.0|Sometimes this type of game is fun and interesting. This one was bad from level one. Not sure if it gets better as i just couldn't play past the second scene. Cant zoom in and that makes it much harder to find things. The first scene you need to find bottles and there are several objects that look likely, but are not. Sure that's part of the challenge, but without being able to zoom you just can't tell for sure. Oh and the dialog is truly awful.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|What more can you say. This game is the perfect time killer. More fun than a screen full of candy! missiles away
B004WPYNY8|5.0|Yeah I know, that's saying a lot.  Trust me I know.  So I don't say this lightly. This cd is filled with incredible hard guitar riffs and great solo's.  I totally LOVE Jason Rullo's drum craftings that go so well with the songs.  The lead singers hard ass vocals are perfect.  I've never heard a keyboardist that works so well with metal.  Just an awesome cd.  The second disc is no let down either.  I put it in thinking it would be leftover material.  It's not.<br /> I can't recommend this highly enough.
B0030P1WKY|5.0|Have not finished the book, however, everything that I have read seems to be spot on.  I am amazed at how true the description of everyone's personality seems to ring true.  Going to order a few for my dearest friends.
1400069742|4.0|And we think there is discord and tension in political life today! Nothing to compare to the &#34;isolationist vs intervention&#34; battles prior to the run up to Peal Harbor. What despicable men Henry Ford and Charles Lindbergh were...not for for their isolationist view but for their unapologetic admiration of Hitler and the Nazi movement! Genius is a small slice of the &#34;character pie&#34;...their slice was overwhelmed by their Nazi leanings!
B008602KQI|5.0|Amazing movie! Kept me in suspense throughout the entire movie...Would watch it over and over.Love the acting of Josh Hutcherson and Jennifer Lawrence.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I enjoyed this novel.  It has a few slow parts but overall was a good read and definitely worth your time.
B0045JEPXU|5.0|Pitbull is AMAZING!!! This CD does not disappoint!!! Ive found its safer to buy CDs on Amazon than some other popular sites! On Amazon the quality is always superb! Ive found on some other popular sites the quality of the CD is off. I dont have to wonder about the authenticity on Amazon and with Amazon Sellers! So far... over the past 6yrs.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I enjoyed this book but it isn't anything groundbreaking.  It is worth your time but go into it with subdued expectations.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Awesome fun!  Definitely worth downloading.  Sure passes the time away when I am bored and have nothing to do.  My new go to game.
B004LFO0ME|4.0|this is a good album, lot of tracks to chill to. highly recomend it to anyone. wiz khalifa definately has his own sound when it comes to rap
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|This is one of the worst movies ever. It concerns the same group of people who get \\"reincarnated\\" back into life over several time periods. It jumps needlessly and constantly from period to period.It would have been better to show them in sequence,but still would have been bad.It's just a long and confusing borefest.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|Very fun to play have played for several hours. Would recommend this game to all my friends and family members who wants to play.
B003O86FMW|5.0|A very entertaining book for all ages. A very fast read for anyone. Would recommend this series to anyone who enjoys reading.
034580404X|5.0|I love how Anastasia innocence disarmed him in every way and freed him of his demons, so he could experience life and love
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|I liked this movie though it could have done a better job explaining certain aspects of the film. I'll have to watch it again to get more out of it. I have no regrets with purchase
B00BH0VSM6|4.0|Not my favourite of the series but still a good read. For that I'd recommend The Snowman. Bravo is a terrific mystery writer.
B00CXVX1OQ|5.0|Lots of fun. Pretty easy too. I thought it was gonna be a corny kid's game. I'm glad I was wrong. Fun for all ages.
0345409671|5.0|I love her vampire/historical/fantasy/reality style of writing :)<br /><br />The only books of hers I have been thrilled about reading are the ones that deal with religion.
B005544TRQ|5.0|One of the best all-time series on TV.  We started watching and didn't stop until we had gone thru 2 seasons in a bit over a weekend.  We will do the same when season 3 is completed.  Ranks up there with NCIS, West Wing and 24.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|seems easy but gets more challanging fast.  good to pass the time when I am bored.  be careful how you spend your points they don't add up fast
B00915G6WQ|5.0|It was amazing, the show is one of the better series I've ever seen. I hit everything I paid for and more! I highly recommend it
B001MTENOC|1.0|Strange, but believable because of all the similar experiences of Dr. Newton's clients. A different perspective of the after life.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|Awesome game would recommend to all but needs targetlock other than that really well put together but that's just my opinion
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|The Google Chromecast is a great streaming device for the money, provided you understand its capabilities. For iOS users, it will only stream Netflix and Youtube at the moment. This is great, as I basically only needed to have Netflix streamed to another TV in my house that is rarely used. With the Netflix app, its very easy to send video to the TV. My 3 year old daughter can even do it.<br /><br />Chrome tab casting is a good plus. It's currently in beta, but you are able to show contents of a chrome tab from your computer on your TV. This is great, as there is a lot of great flash video content i'm now able to display on TV as well.
B009AJDET6|5.0|These discs are of very good sound quality, and give you all you could want from a Chicago collection. A few of there hits are gonna sound a little different here as they were taken off of the albums as they were released, but at the end of the disc they will give you the single release that you are more familiar with. This is a band I love and I am in love with this purchase. Highly recomended.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|this is a great movie, i cant wait for the sequel! i have always been a comic buff but having it brought to life is amazing!
B004IJZFP4|1.0|The remix on this was horrible. Album staples such as &#34;Dreamer&#34;, &#34; People, People&#34; and &#34;Wild Dogs&#34; were replaced with alernate takes. I couldn't possibly recomend this album to anyone.
B008XBASVY|3.0|It wasn't written that well and the ending was really pointless. Not even close to being one of my favorites
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Minions go through all this hard work and die SO many times just to let us be entertained! Am I right?
B003O86FMW|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read! I highly recommend reading it, especially if you loved the first book in the series
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Good selection of aircraft,  vehicle,  and trained ground troop forces to build - up and oppose virtual and nonlinear players.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|This game is a flashback. to. the old. Atari game Missile Command. The graphics are so-so but the game is fun. Thanks
B003VR5PPY|5.0|There's nothing not to love about this game. Keeps you on the edge of your seat until the end. 10/10
B000IDEQTK|5.0|A wonderful blend of clever language, heart, insight into the human condition, luscious setting and period costume.  I was transported. Helen Hunt was an interesting, not obvious choice, and I enjoyed her save for a few deliveries where she struggles with a monotonous voice.  It's a wonder I've never heard of this before.  Giggles and tears likely to be part of your viewing if you're the romantic type.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I enjoyed reading Fifty Shades Darker. It gives a positive outlook on an ideal relationship. I loved the different love making scenes. This book deserves a 5 star!!
B002W7H3EA|5.0|This movie is very well made for the date it was made and has a lot of action and suspense.  The actors are great in there parts and they play them very well. Cary Grant is great in this movie.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Its adicting, its fun, and just plain awesome. I love this game and i'm sure you will too. Buy this game its worth the price.
B000PC6A3E|5.0|This Batman film was awesome. The only one that I think rivals it is the Tim Burton/Michael Keaton Batman. But that was more about Keaton and Nicholson and their performances more-so than the movie. Really, I can't think of anything bad about this one. Great story, liked how they stayed true, great actors and characters, really fun and fast-paced. Story never slowed down and got dull or anything. Can't go wrong. Makes me excited to watch the Dark Knight now.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|5 yr old daughter would play this all day if I would let her. Great for keeping your little princess occupied. Lots of beautiful clothes to choose from.
1558908846|5.0|This movie admittedly missed some real potential action-wise. If it had a little more edge like the newer Dredd, it would have been perfect. But Stallone can't be equaled in his portrayal. The one-liners and writing in general for Stallone's part alone MAKE this movie. Then add in the performances of Asante, Schneider, etc. and it's tough to not like this film. It's a real combination of action with very funny lines. Usually a good team.
B002361MLA|5.0|The most \\"usable\\" self-improvement book I have read in 65 years.  It is a manual for wholesome and healthy living.
B001AQQR2S|5.0|Matilda is an all time fun with kids and enjoyable to watch.  The video rendering was seamless and with Amazon,  it makes it special to watch without worrying about how far you have watched.
0143118706|2.0|I enjoyed 'Eat, Pray, Love' enough to try 'Committed' as an audio book.  Had it been a paper book, I would've stopped reading, but as an audio book, it was a passable distraction while I cleaned my closet.  My expectation was that Gilbert would explore marriage in many cultures, not just those that were conveniently located or fit her preconceived notions.  And her discussion of Christian marriage was off-base.  I sensed that she wanted to focus on oppression rather than partnership and unity.<br /><br />I did enjoy the updates about Felipe.  Otherwise it was just an easy book deal.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is one of the greatest games ever! I like games from movies. I recommend this book to ... EVERYONE!!!!!!!
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Really enjoyed reading this book. What nice and intelligent aproach to introduce the yet unknown histrical Jesus. Very enlightening. I recommend for those interested in the history of early Christians
B004RCUJ9E|4.0|Old fashion game, but still good for passing time and basic strategy skills.  This easy exercise will keep you sharp!  Download/install was a breeze. I would definitely recommend.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|This game is fun yet FUN. My kid loves this game and is like mommy mommy look I did it.
B00DH1G7DS|5.0|I love this game,and now have it anytime on my Asus tab. Flawless install, easy instructions, great graphics.  I would definitely recommend.
B009DCOU9S|3.0|I'm stuck at level 10-2. I was really enjoying the game until I got stuck. I have tried everything. where can I go for help? Miss Ida
B004SVM7BW|5.0|If you routinely save docs in PDF format, this is a very good, basic and easy option.  I would definitely recommend.
B00CXVX1OQ|5.0|I was playing this game and I won I had everything up strength block and speed I was doing s<br />on big ko's
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|fun summer movie, not much thinking required. I liked the snappy dialogue and that they didn't take themselves too seriously.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Love the stunning set, costumes and the complexity of the characters. Don't want it to end! Glad to have it on amazon prime.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I am very happy with this device. This has become the only player that I use for watching Netflix and videos from my laptop. I gave it four stars due to the lack of app support. It's really easy to setup and launch videos. I didn't have any issues with lag other than the delays I get when I launch from Chrome. I'm considering getting a second player but I'll wait until more apps are supported. All in all, this is a really good player, especially for the price.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The Wool series is insanely addicting. The characters won't surprise you, but the plot is very fun.  This book is a really fast very fun read!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Loved the game years ago and this one is even better than the original.  I  recommend this game to anyone who was ever an arcade fan.
B006LSZECO|3.0|When it kept skipping chapters between Him and Her, It seemed confusing to me.  Therefore it dragged out too long.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|It took me a little to get the hang of it but I'm staring to really get used to it. It's a great way to pass the time
141694737X|5.0|This is a nice book because it has a lot of pages.  Most of these types of books don't have very many pages.  You need to go through and open all the flaps the first time so they are easy for your little one to open.  Really like the book.
B00BGD8CFK|5.0|i searched for about 2-3 days for the perfect IPhone5 case for my with. I am glad I purchased this one. It hasn't come off her phone once since I put it on. Color is great, matched SFGIants perfectly, would recommend. Also slim fit doesn't add the bulk that most cases do, love it!
0375869026|5.0|I highly recommend this book!  A great read for the classroom! The characters and their story will move the reader of any age!
B000JCSPG0|4.0|Great movie, just wish I could watch it on my Android device. . .  I do believe Amazon thinks we don't matter!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is the best Bible app I've found. Lots of features and easy to use. Great for daily study while you're on the go.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I love the way the author told the story from all the character's perspectives during the same time frame. She was able to capture the interconnectedness of all their lives seamlessly. I cared about what happened to the characters and couldn't put the book down.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Wow,this book was amazing! I was super emotional!I laughed and cried overall it was a brilliant book and a great read!
B005I7G3EM|5.0|A great movie and fun to watch, one the whole family can enjoy. I always like John Wayne and especially enjoyed Red Buttons
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|The device works just fine.  The problem is for the most part it is a way of selling Netflix or other internet services without a gaming device.<br /><br />I don't think that it has any other purpose right now but it could lead to a better use of content, if free, over the internet.<br /><br />We are not there yet.
B009AY04A8|2.0|Too much dialog. Plus every time I touch the screen to move around it counts as as \\"random tap\\".  It's ok but I'd be angry if I'd paid for it.
B002RI9TB4|5.0|I was really immersed in this story from the first page. It's a beautiful love story set against the backdrop of the war in Biafra - a subject I knew little about. The world of the story is extremely vivid and the characters stay with you long after the last page. I keep wondering how they got on after the war! It's a wonderful piece on the politics of famine and the post-colonial political mess that blights sub-saharan Africa. I couldn't put this book down and now want to read more about this time and place.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|i use it every day to download documentaries and music videos to my kindle fire. it gives you many options for the quality even mp3
B00APOSIEQ|5.0|Very well written. Good for both beginners and advanced web developers to know more about css. I enjoyed reading this book.
B0037EAJAC|5.0|If nothing else, the colors and camerawork of this film are divine. The characters are also well developed.<br /><br />It is long! Be prepared.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I've been a fan since the first episode aired and it's just as enjoyable now.  I love the creative ideas, the cast of characters, everything.  And being able to watch it here with Amazon Prime is great!!  Thank you, Amazon!
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I TOTALLY love playing<br /> this game. There is all tHe variety one could ask for. My complaints are : I am regularly knocked off or the thing freezes and I lose my CREDITS and powerups, I prefer not to play with the Facebook tiein, so l am penalized, l play a lot with multiple cards but rarely Bingo.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|Better than the show! Take the time to read this book and you will not regret it. Whether you have seen the show or not, Kerman's book shines true color on America's criminal justice system.
B001AR4K8K|4.0|While the film is/was an 80's vampire classic, it still is enjoyable to watch present day. This Blu Ray version is an improvement over the up-converted DVD release. Though some close-ups looked smeary or painted with no pores or lines on faces. Black levels are very good and audio is better than it had ever sounded on any previous release of the film which includes  a Dolby TrueHD 5.1 Surround  presentation.<br /><br />Extras are carried over from the DVD but unfortunately are not in HD.<br /><br />For fans of the film, this present Blu Ray is the way to go.
B009WUAK2M|3.0|It is what it is, don't expect much acting. The violence does grow old. I did love the homage to Chuck Norris.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|this is the first tablet. card game I actually enjoy. the cards all have different abilities and strengths. it is a lot of fun to play
B001UV4XIS|5.0|Great movie, and the service at Amazon is the best. I had to buy it cuz I have all the other ones and needed to see how it endrd.
B00BG4UWPC|4.0|It's a really good album--not my most favorite, but it's great to see them evolving and experimenting with new styles.
B00CW665VI|3.0|I didn't review this book right after I finished reading it and kinda wish I had.....because I barely remember the story.<br />I remember liking it but no major details from it. I liked that this was told from a &#34;male&#34; point of view, but some of the stuff the main male character said was what I think we as woman want to hear a man say...but usually they don't.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|Well written, compelling and sweet.  A true love story but still unexpected and fun. As an adult, it brings you back to yhe htrill of our first loves and it ends how you want it to......
B003G4W49C|1.0|This was long drawn out boring story. How did this win an award? At least I know to avoid the movie.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Overall so far good clean fun. Reminds me of many an afternoon spending quarters spent in arcades in my younger days.
1400069289|5.0|I am only 50% thru this book and it has helped me establish some better habbits.<br />However the fact that I am taking time to write this review says that I am still avoiding<br />doing work I need to do.<br />I need to read more and stay the course.<br />NUF Said.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|What a delightful and inspiring journey.  James Gardner and Gena Rowland's completely steal the film.  Superb story marries superb acting.  Thank-you, Maria E. Matos for turning me on to this.
B002HJ9PTO|1.0|I wish I could say something great about this, but I just could not get it to work with my Tascam recorder... too bad.  The audio was incredibly weak.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Hayao Miyazaki makes masterful movies. I have raised my children watching all of his movies. Now that my daughter is a mother she will have the same joy with her daughter.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Wish I could complete more levels without doing all the gift stuff.like to play and shut everything else out. Not socialize. Fun game though.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Fun and challenging. Great game it is very fun to play. Great job by the programmers. Lots of fun. Thanks
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This game is about as fun as the old middle command on Atari. I enjoy this game ALOT and my children love it also! Pick it up....not a bad catch for FREE :)
0062238868|4.0|An incredible, inspiring, revealing, insightful biography to say the least. The world could be a better place if more people were like Chris Kyle
B000T433CO|5.0|I love it. It's a great movie. I love watching it with my sister. Good movie.  It is amazing. Kyndra
B005XQLBU4|4.0|This game is fun and you get to defend the city from the evil missiles trying to destroy it! This game has many things in it that are amazing! There are upgrades you can put on your missiles to better defend the city. And the better you do on protecting the city, the more repair points you get to upgrade and fix your city!
B00846REIS|5.0|Awesome novel....I'm in love with Gideon and Eva's relationship, I will definitely recommend this book to everyone that I know!!
140006922X|5.0|This book concerns the Achilles' Heal of Christianity. There is no doubt that a historical Jesus existed; nor is there any doubt that he was crucified. This book explores the historical and logical implications of these undeniable facts.<br /><br />The ferocity of the negative reviews of this book demonstrates that it has touched a deep nerve of traditional Christian practitioners. This judgment is unjustified, because  Zealot is an incisive piece of hard, cold, historical analysis. Through this historical analysis, Azlan gives new meaning to the utterances attributed to the Christ in the gospels. Azlan notes that much of what is attributed to the Christ was never uttered by him. The statement carry an entirely new and different meaning when viewed according to the times in which he lived.<br /><br />Interest in this book peaked when the author, Reza Aslan, recently was interviewed on live television on Fox News. Soon after the interview began it was clear that the interviewer, Lauren Green, didn't have a clue about the subject and was debating a subject against someone who was clearly outside her league. As she stumbled through the interview, attempting to paint the author as a biased Muslim authoring a prejudiced book about Christianity, it soon became apparent that she had not even read the book, let alone was competent to debate the subject. The interview went viral. This is a good example of a Fox interviewee destroying a Fox host, instead of the other way around, and epitomizes the debate surrounding this book.<br /><br />This interview symbolizes the debate reflected in these book reviews.  The interviewer on Fox, and the negative reviews of this book on this webpage, attempt to paint this book and its author as heretical, ideologically-driven, and historically flawed or incorrect.<br /><br />But try as Fox News might have you believe, this book DOES NOT have an agenda, hidden or otherwise; DOES NOT paint an unflattering portrait of Jesus Christ; and IS NOT disparaging or disrespectful of the Christian faith.<br /><br />Further, most negative reviews on this website, ostensibly because the Amazon audience is a notch above from the viewers of Fox, criticize the scholarship in this book. Again, this is unjustified, because Azlan supported his comments with a hundred pages of endnotes located at the second part of the book. (Detractors probably don't even know the book has endnotes.)<br /><br />As far as his historical or social conclusions, the points Azlan emphasizes about Jesus and Christianity which are hardly new.  Of note:<br /><br />1. The Political Jesus.<br /> In the nascent days of Liberation Theology, this aspect of Jesus was emphasized, whose sayings and utterances were interpreted in their political aspect. Azlan makes an excellent historical analysis of this aspect viewed against the social conditions of Palestine under the Roman occupation. This interpretation of Jesus and his mission had gained some currency in the Sixties and Seventies. This interpretation emphasized social justice for the masses and the need for self-determination. In addition to providing the basis for a religious movement, Jesus' mission was revolutionary in that it ran against the interests of the Jewish ruing class, and the Roman occupiers, who served as a proxy for the Roman occupiers, a point made abundantly clear by Azlan's historical analysis. This aspect of Jesus' mission has direct application to the political world today. There are many contemporary and past examples of resistance to foreign occupiers.<br /><br /> Jesus' mission was no different. What makes Azlan's gloss so controversial is that this interpretation is not popular in these Neoliberal times, and the foreign occupiers tend to be American more often than not.<br /><br />2. The schism between the followers of James and Paul.<br /> As Azlan notes in his endnotes there has been much commentary on the early divisions of Christianity following Jesus' death. Again, Azlananalyzes the words of the New Testament and notes how, despite their differences, Paul's commentary of Jesus and his mission significantly differs with the Gospels. The differences between James and Paul were significant. James, the brother of Christ, continued with Jesus' mission; Paul sought to transform the life and words of Christ to a Roman audience.<br /><br />3. The ascendancy of Paul's interpretation of Jesus.<br /> What is now known as Christianity is really Paul's interpretation of Jesus, his life and mission.<br /><br />Again, these main theses of the book are nothing new. While there is historical debate as to some aspects, described fully in the endnotes, these points are largely not disputed. Still, this is all very threatening for traditional believers of the doctrine, hence, the obstreperousness of the Fox interview and livid negative reviews of this book on this website.<br /><br />The sad, inconvenient, truth is that much of what has come to be presently practiced and believed in the Christian faith, and particularly Christian dogma concerning the Christ, is not grounded in historical fact concerning Jesus the man. The present configuration of Christian dogma was developed centuries after the Christ died, after numerous Synods and Councils which formulated in an agreed dogma. Azlan discusses briefly those Synods. THOSE Synods and Councils were politically and ideologically driven and motivated by political convenience, with the ultimate aim to consolidate the Roman empire into a homogenous whole, united with one, agreed, faith.  As a result, Christian dogma is not the result of the utterances of Jesus, the reliability of which Azlan notes are suspect, but a mish-mash of Greek philosophy, Patristic commentary, and folk traditions. And Jesus the man was no longer considered human and practitioners who believe that Jesus was human, such as the Arian, were ostracized as heretics. The dilemma is that there is no dispute that a person named Jesus lived and died in Palestine at this point in history. It is this last category that Mr. Azlan concentrates. Due to the paucity of reliable historical data, much of Christian dogma is fabrication. Not that this is bad. Mr. Azlan notes that much of what has been handed down and survive as ancient writings are fabrications.<br /><br />While there is no historical confirmation of the Resurrection, Azlan quite rightly has stated this is a matter of faith.<br /><br />What the book will do, guaranteed, is challenge all who read it. And it really doesn't depend on your point of view, whether you are a traditional believer, sceptic, non-believer, or anything in between. Azlan's re-interpretation puts the events in the New Testament in a modern context and in contemporary terms, easily understandable for modern readers or anyone who pays attention to news events in the Middle East. Reading this book will change your outlook on the Christian faith.analyzes the words of the New Testament and notes how, despite their differences, Paul's commentary of Jesus and his mission significantly differs with the Gospels.

006178480X|4.0|I read pretty much everything James Rollins writes.  He has never let me down.  I was excited about this book because it touches on quantum physics, a subject my son and I find endlesslt fascinating.  While this is not the best Rollins has written, it is a solid an d enjoyable read for those who enjoy the technothriller genre.  Try a sample, if you like the genre  you will enjoy this.

B009KS4XRO|1.0|BB is all about getting your money. Sure some ppl say they never pay, but most gamblers, especially the addicts on this site lie. I just completed a slot room, first by winning in a scatter that didn't pay off, then by having the item gifted to me by the group I associate with, they still didn't pay off the $50,000 coins. I tried several times to submit my issue thru support. It seems they are the ones with issues, couldn't bother, told me to try later.[[ASIN:B009KS4XRO BINGO Blitz - FREE Bingo + Slots]]

B00CWY76CC|5.0|... put your thinking cap on! This is a truly FUN and BRAINSTUMPING game. I just downloaded it and have only had time to play a bit, but I'm totally stumped on the third game! I gotta go now and try to get out of that dang room!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love Flow Free! The first levels are super easy to get you up to speed, and then the clever levels start. I have horrible ADD, and puzzle games like this are the only way I can make it through conference calls and meetings. If I'm not doing something like this, I'm not paying attention in the meeting, so Flow Free, you're saving corporate America!
B007SO31BQ|5.0|A well researched and chronicled history of the late, great Ayrton Senna. A distinct pleasure to have seen him race in his time...precise and yet emotional in his career as an F1 pilot. &#34;Completely Unmissable&#34; is correct!
0062127241|4.0|Throughout the chaotic times of his childhood through Rock super-stardom, the mind behind the words and music of The Who comes to life in a revealing autobiography. I am sure much of this was difficult for Pete to share publicly, but is a great reflection of the generation.
B008BGNMZU|5.0|It took me a while to decide if I should get this cd or not.When I finally did,I thought to myself,why didn't I get it sooner.I have all the Fourplay titles except the Best of and Snowbound titles and this one is one my favourites since the first three albums.The reason I rank it among the first three is that it's a very good and consistent cd.I can listen to it from the first track to the last without skipping any.I would recommend it to the Fourplay fans or smooth jazz fans alike.
B00E9HML1Q|5.0|WHAT WILL WE SEE IN THE EXTENDED EDITION:<br /><br />1. More of DALE, including the BLACK ARROWS. Director Peter Jackson mentions a previously unseen character: \\"Girion, who is defending [the city of] Dale using black arrows against Smaug. And the black arrows play a part in an ongoing story, for they are the one thing that can pierce the dragon's hide.\\"<br /><br />2. More king of the wood elves; THRANDUIL. Peter Jackson: \\"There are also issues with Thranduil. We get some of the reason why he and the dwarves had a falling out - to do with these white gems...\\"<br /><br />3. More of HOBBITON. Producer Phillipa Boyens: \\"You are going to get more of Hobbiton. We always wanted to wend our way through Hobbiton, but in the end Bilbo has to run out of the door.\\"<br /><br />4. The OLD TOOK'S PARTY: In which we see a younger Gandalf meet Bilbo Baggins as a young child, convincing the wizard of the young hobbit's bravery and courage. I won't spoil it for you, but it involves a dragon and a bit of magic.<br /><br />5. Dwarf antics at RIVENDELL. Peter Jackson: \\"You are going to get some serious Dwarvish disrespect of the elves at Rivendell.\\"<br /><br />6. A scene between BILBO AND ELROND, in which Elrond speaks to Bilbo about his QUEST.<br /><br />7. The SONG of the GOBLIN KING. Producer Fran Walsh: \\"You are going to get more Goblin Town, and the Great Goblin singing his song. It is a great song, but it was just another delay in terms of moving the story along.\\" Peter Jackson: \\"A number one hit from the Goblin King. Barry Humphries is going to rise up the charts!\\"<br /><br />Well, all looking good on these fronts! The roads lead ever on and on...
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Let me first say that I thought director [[ASIN:B004R63MWQ Joseph Kosinski's]] Tron: Legacy was abysmal. And apparently, a sizable portion of critics and audiences shared my opinion. But there were moments watching that I could not help but be impressed. Kosinski has a great visual eye, and shows mastery of lighting and framing. There are scenes in the film of startling beauty, like, &#34;Wow. This movie is actually not ALL bad.&#34; Colour me intrigued. What else could this guy do?<br /><br />When he was coupled with arguably Hollywood's biggest movie star - [[ASIN:B00A2FSXHK Tom Cruise]], a great supporting cast - including [[ASIN:B00464AVXW Morgan Freeman]] and [[ASIN:B004NEY9EW Olga Kurylenko]], a bigger budget, and a promising script based on a six-page graphic novel treatment he penned, I was ready to give Joseph Kosinski a second chance.<br /><br />I saw Oblivion. Let's see what I thought below.<br /><br />Movies live or die on their casting so let's talk about that first. I understand the doubts about Tom Cruise, but really, there's no need for that. Put aside your thoughts about his personal life; the couch jumping, Katie Holmes, and all that. The role of futuristic drone repairman Jack Harper is quite possibly among his finest. Cruise shows he has a real screen presence, which, when combined with his roguish charm and charisma, results in a surprisingly sympathetic and impressive performance.<br /><br />Cruise's character is onscreen 90% of the time, so his performance is a big factor in the film's power. I can safely say that Jack Harper managed to be interesting, cool, and emotional without being over-the-top or sappy. Kudos to you, Tom. You might not be the finest of actors, but you're always fun to watch.<br /><br />Olga Kurylenko and [[ASIN:B00CIXK8KY Andrea Riseborough]] both give excellent performances as the films two female leads: respectively, the mysterious crash-landed astronaut Julia, and Jack's conflicted co-member Victoria. While Kurylenko's character brings the love interest and the mysterious flashbacks, Riseborough's Victoria is much more interesting and strong, plotwise. in the supporting cast we find Morgan Freeman, who is his usual awesome self as Malcolm Beech, one of the few remaining humans on earth; and [[ASIN:B007HJ84ZK Nikolai Coster-Waldau]], who brings the muscle and the beard factor to the game. Fine roles, all round!<br /><br />And here's another reason to watch Oblivion. Oblivion has the finest cinematography I have seen in a film this year. Echoing Lawrence of Arabia and 2001: A Space Odyssey, the stunning landscape of Iceland comes to vivid, awe-inspiring life with a minimum of CGI and a maximum of practical effects, camera tricks, and good ol'fashioned location shooting. Crumbling volcanos, vast mesas, winding canyons, valleys, endless plains, shifting deserts, dizzying peaks, and open sky are all beautifully shot, and, with a bit of CGI touch-up, become the alien-ravaged world of 2077. Seriously, see this in IMAX and you will not be disappointed. Oblivion is a veritable FEAST for the eyes.<br /><br />The costumes and tech and equipment are amazing as well. Kosinski chose to go for a more practical route here, and the extra work pays off. The world of Oblivion reminds one of an Apple Computer or the [[ASIN:B002PMPTIO Star Trek (2009)]], but there are telltale signs that this is a lived-in, breathed-in, realistic world. Jack Harper's white costumes bears stains and grit; his chrome gun is scratched a little bit; his baseball cap is faded. Malcolm Beech's leathers are functional and weathered, while the garb of astronaut Julia is pristine grey and follows the clean lines of NASA. Form follows function, as Oblivion designer David Simon says, and so Oblivion's equipment - the drones, the planes, the guns, the motorcycles, the clothes, the beds, the electronics, even the sound of the tech, is all designed for maximum realism. But that's not to say it doesn't look cool. It does.<br /><br/>I applaud Joseph Kosinski for his restraint when it came to CGI, and his use of practical sets and props. Here's to more in the future.<br /><br />Now, shall we talk cons? Oblivion borrows from too many movies to list. I see a bit of Moon here, Logan's Run there, a little of Star Wars there, is that a Solaris reference I spy? As original as Oblivion may seem, it may all be superficial - just on the surface. The story has been done plenty of times before, just not with this incredible cinematography and eye for detail. The climax was slightly &#34;out there&#34;, and didn't reeeally fit the rest of the film tonally, but Tom Cruise's memorable one-liner is enough to make it worth it all.<br /><br />In conclusion, Oblivion is one of the best science fiction films to come out this year. But it's a good thing not many sci-fi films DID come out in 2013, because Oblivion is not as epic or original as it might want to be. That's not to stop the great acting, explosive action, great sets, costumes, and cool tech, and cool M83 score from letting you have a great time at the movies. My rating? Four and a half drones out of five. But why don't you watch it and see for yourself?<br /><br />P.S. Remember, the like/dislike buttons are NOT for saying whether you agreed with the reviewer or not, but whether the review helped you decide to buy the product.

B008602KQI|4.0|A very fine version of the book - looking forward to &#34;Catching Fire&#34; ... Action, Adventure and romance, all you need to make it!
B000SGGUWS|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book. However, I made the mistake of watching the TV series before I read the first book. It was a very good book that I originally had low expectations for.
1401238580|4.0|It was a good buy. I enjoyed the book and the mask but my only problem with it was the screen in the top wasn't attached. It was just kind of there. The mask and the book was in good condition though.
B009ZZDNT6|2.0|this alarm has worked great for me for months. until new update. now it force closes everytime I try to set an alarm
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Addictive, good graphics, and creative- it really is fun. Highly recommended to at least give it a try (it's free anyways).
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|City Of Bones<br />by<br />Cassandra Clare<br /><br />I am so late to read this...I couldn't connect with it earlier but I get it.  I finally get it.  This author is masterful...I love this world she has invented.  I love the premise and the characters.  I love the idea for this book and I love her writing...her actual words.  It's one of these books that just carried me away.  I can not imagine seeing the movie without reading the books, though.  I may just zip right into the next book!
B005C5SJ1U|5.0|This is the Danish version, the original. I understand that an &#34;American version&#34; exists also but, according to what I heard, ii has been &#34;modified&#34; to make it less shocking for the viewers. I suggest that you watch this one, it was excellent.
006114665X|5.0|You know how it goes.  I venture to say that we general History readers could pretty readily agree that the causative factors recited in most World War I accounts are pretty rudimentary and follow a well-trod narrative (or series of them).  Aside from the British and German naval build-up's and other peripheral military and diplomatic chess-playing, there invariably comes the discussion of Balkan unrest.  Serbia and its neighbors were a `powder keg' ripe for detonation.  Austria-Hungary was the tired old man unable to retain its grasp on its southeastern putative possessions.  Yadda, yadda, yadda.<br /><br />To the extent I've thought about it, and I have, my feelings have been mixed about learning more about the Balkan background than typically is provided in these tomes.  After all, one could fairly speculate about the reasons why the accounts are usually so adumbrated.  It could be, for instance, that many historians who purport to be WWI `experts' really don't understand this tangled web themselves and are simply anxious to satisfy their readers' expectations by getting on to the fighting as expeditiously as possible.  But it strikes me as more likely that they are of the mind that we `general' readers simply don't have the patience to wade through a detailed explanation of who in the Balkans did what to whom in the years preceding the conflagration, and what effects these events had on the relations of the Great Powers.  After all, sitting still for this stuff could be like listening to a lecture on the Peloponnesian Wars delivered in ancient Greek.<br /><br />Well, Christopher Clark in this tremendously valuable (to say nothing of delightfully readable) account proves beyond doubt that not only is a thoroughgoing understanding of these events essential to a `complete' understanding of the prelude to war, but can be enjoyed without the administration of even a local anesthetic.<br /><br />In his introduction, Clark characterizes his work as an examination of the `how' of the war rather than its `why,' explaining that the first involves scrutiny of the series of events that produced certain results while the latter suggests a search among myriad foundations such as nationalism, imperialism, armaments, alliances, etc. in an attempt to forge a reasonable elucidation of the casus belli.  Of course, Clark then proceeds to employ his obvious and enviable knowledge of pre-war Balkan and general European history to demonstrate that an explanation of the `how' pretty much takes care of the `why.'<br /><br />Also notable is Clark's unusual and becoming way of presenting his views on the facts as he lays them out.  In my experience, rare is the historian who, having gone to all the trouble of researching especially obscure and difficult-to-interpret sources and expending the considerable energy in understanding and explaining what they impart, can resist strafing shibboleths and fragging accepted wisdom.  Clark not only consistently resists the temptation to do so, but invites the reader to interpret the material along with him.<br /><br />By the time one (regretfully) puts down this wonderful book, it is clear that Clark didn't undertake to re-write the causal history of WWI, but rather to clarify it.  Mission accomplished.  Interested in the Great War?  Don't miss this one.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I really have to admit that I hated J.J. Abrams' new take on the Star Trek franchise.  I couldn't stand the first film (and still can't), but this sequel is AMAZING.  Very well done, great storyline with edge-of-your-seat action, and great acting.<br /><br />*SPOILERS AHEAD!*<br /><br />Now to get to the nitty gritty stuff:<br /><br />1)  The storyline:  KHAN.  I found it really funny how this is the second movie of the new Trek cast, and Khan just happened to be introduced here (just like the second movie of the original cast).  How they revealed the \\"Federation agent\\" to be Khan was pretty well done.  In this film, you have Spock screaming \\"KHANNN!!!!\\" instead of Kirk (which was rather blahh in my opinion), and you have Kirk (instead of Spock) being trapped in the radiation chamber.  What would have been great is if Kirk actually died in this film, but alas, he doesn't.<br /><br />2) I felt that introducing the Klingons in this film was a wasted plot effort.  They really served no purpose here, and they looked AWFUL.  You can see the computer generated effects with the so-called makeup, and they look more reptilian than anything else (with parallels to the Cardassians).  Not a fan at all with how the new Klingons look.<br /><br />3)  Capt. Christopher's Pike death.  Too bad they killed him off.  I wish they would have paralleled the Chris Pike character from the original series by showing how he came to be in a motorized wheelchair.<br /><br />Other than the above points, I really enjoyed the film, and I'll definitely watch it again and again.  As much as I initially hated J.J. Abrams' re-imagining of the franchise, it's not bad when you view it in a certain way.  You can't see these movies as a complete destruction of the Trek canon or a cheap rip off.  You need to see them as an alternative history/timeline sort of thing.  When seen in this way (whether this is actually Abrams' philosophy or not), you gain a greater appreciation for these films.
B00BZW5W3W|5.0|This is one of the best CD's in my collection. I love the variety of music from upbeat to slow tempo and everything in between. This is a really good CD and I listen to it daily. Thank you Maysa for providing such quality, classic, smooth music.
0143038583|5.0|The book is very well written, and kept my attention well for non-fiction. The book was in good condition and took a reasonable amount of time to ship. Very satisfied, enjoy!
8866135909|5.0|I love the moleskine brand. It's stylish, and the pages and cover have a great feel to them. Arrived right before I need to begin filling in the schedule for the upcoming year.
B0070UFMOW|5.0|I'm not well versed in audio equipment, but this was relatively inexpensive, and levels my sound out for playing through headphones and through other speakers. Personally, I think my favorite use of this product is playing music or podcasts from a cell phone or mp3 player through an aux port in a car. For example, when I listen to Radiolab, there's a huge and dynamic range of volumes and pitches used in their presentation. Trying to play that straight from a cell phone, the speakers in the car peak frequently, or else I can't hear the quiet stuff. With the amp, the sound is leveled out right where I want it to be. This was a good purchase for me. The only note of caution is that overcharging the amp may cause the unit to give you problems starting, etc. Just be cognizant of how long you leave it plugged in.
B0029QRA1U|5.0|I'm recording songs from lots of my old records to compile the soundtrack of my life. I want the soundtrack on my computer so I can listen in my car and on my iphone. It's easy to use and low profile.
B008P9M614|5.0|Never started watching this on TV until the re-runs.  We don't use cable, so maybe these are on one of their multitude of station.  It is great to have complete series without commercials...
0345529057|1.0|Did you ever watch &#34;Lost&#34;?  Remember how it seemed really cool at first, but at some point you began to feel uneasy, wondering how all these plot lines were going to fit together?  Then they finally wrote a bunch of silly garbage to finish it up and said,  &#34;TheEnd&#34;.<br /><br />That's the feeling I have from ASOFAI.  I think it could have been really good if he had written the whole thing and then done some editing - instead of going down so many false plot trails and then writing plot lines that were clearly thought up much later.<br /><br />Book 1: interesting concept, looking forward to book 2<br />Book 2: hm, waiting to see some plot resolution<br />Book 3: uh oh, I'm getting that &#34;LOST &#34; deja-vu<br />Book 4:  This clearly sucks.  (author thinks:&#34;maybe if I add some lesbians they won't notice how poor my writing is &#34;)<br /><br />It's just a horrendous mess, I wish George RR had sold his idea to someone who knew how to write a book.<br /><br />I hope this review saves you some time and money
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Simple, easy to use, does everything I wanted it to do and has great future potential. Anyone who uses Google music or youtube would love this product.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is both challenging and fun. We were able to play with teams also. I am waiting for more levels-- we love the challenge.

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Finally got through ALL seasons and can hardly wait for the next.  I am so happy that I have Amazon Prime....it's definetly worth it!!!
B009AY04A8|4.0|I liked the characters and the art work is nice.  The storyline is fun if you take the time to read it.  I do wish they had some more challenging games, but all in all I liked it.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Clock worked great! I love how you can set your own music to wake you up! The math problems to insure you wake up-- cool! I would highly recemend this!
B000VK99Z6|4.0|This is a very well done and very dark comedy.  It is original, funny, odd, and gruesome.  I liked it better than &#34;Shaun of the Dead&#34; (also by Simon Pegg and Nick Frost), but most people I've asked who like them both seem to like them about the same.  I, also, liked the movie &#34;Paul&#34; by Pegg and Frost.  It is not as dark as the other 2 comedies, but it is not for kids, either.
