B0053O89RY|5.0|This may very well be the best comedy sitcom of all time.  It is like the modern day Cosby show.
0307276902|5.0|This book was great! It's not like something I have ever read before. The formatting of it is a bit weird but if you can get past that there are no paragraphs and the controversy surround the book that everything may not be true, and take it for just a great bok then you will love it.
B009NPKTN6|3.0|If you are a child of the 80's, you will love this movie.  Great music, not much of a storyline but that's how most musicals usually are.
B0027MJU00|5.0|This is a very well written book. Kept me in suspense the whole way through till the end. Gillian does a great job keeping you guessing who the real killer is.
B0098VXBIA|3.0|If you need to pass time on a trip or have a lazy afternoon, this is the movie.  It's very light-hearted and there are some funny parts.
0060853980|5.0|Calling all book lovers: this is a must-have in any collection worth it's salt! This is my favorite novel of all time, and whenever I don't know what I want to read or I just grab a book before I leave the house, this is the one I pick. I've read it at least fifty times, and I'm still laughing the entire ride, finding something new I didn't notice before. As accurately stated on the back cover, the Apocalypse has never been funnier. Misters Pratchett and Gaiman have written something that's absolutely insane, hilarious, and enticing, and deserves to be a classic. The characters are original, the writing is confusing in a way that keeps you smiling and not sure which side you're on, and the end leaves you hoping for a sequel that isn't coming anytime soon.<br /><br />Once you start reading, you won't be able to put it down, and you'll keep picking it up for more.<br /><br />The reason I picked up this book in the first place was because I was reading an online comic called Roommates, and Crowley and Aziraphale made appearances. I thought they were awesome and I wanted to know where they came from in the first place. So I went to the nearest used bookstore and read the back of the book, and I've never looked back. I've never wanted to, either.
B007GCY8FS|1.0|Lee Child's \\"Reacher\\" franchise started out with a bang--\\"The Killing Floor\\" was a great book, and there have been some really good reads in the series. With \\"A Wanted Man\\" it's just about certain that he has run out of ideas. This may as well take place in a white room with white furniture with white curtains, because Child has lost the ability to be creative or descriptive in any meaningful way. If you hadn't gotten to know the Reacher character very well from previous novels, you might conclude that he's a wreckless, boring, sociopathic, borderline retard from what is included in this book. Not one scene develops his character any further than previously done in the franchise.<br /><br />The ludicrous ending to this book contains some of the worst descriptive scenes ever, as well as the killing off of characters just because Child can't think of anything else to do with them, and some of the least plausible crap I have ever read. Yeah, I love science fiction too--but this mundane, implausible, vapid story doesn't come close to even asking for that level of reader involvement. Miss this one.<br /><br />Also, miss the movie in which Hollywood has seen fit to cast a borderline midget as a 6' 5\\" 250lb+ beast of a man. It's just insulting to fans of the series.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|As I mentioned in the review of just Wool 1, I enjoy Hugh Howey writing and stories.  I was surprised one day to see that I had read three books in recent weeks that I enjoyed, and all three were by Mr. Howey.  I hadn't paid much attention until I read Wool 1 and then discovered that I wanted to read MORE.  This series in a single book kept me interested, I wanted to know what happened right up until the end, and I can't wait (hope there is) more about life in the Silo.
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|I've been looking forward to seeing Ted since the movie was in theaters. Many of my friends have raved about how funny it is, and it received a number of good reviews from professional critics. So, when I finally sat down this afternoon to watch it on Amazon Instant Video, I was surprised by how bored I was with the film.<br /><br />(For the uninitiated: the plot of the film revolves around a guy who wished for a talking teddy bear when he was a kid and as an adult must choose between this stuffed animal (aka his best friend) and his girlfriend.)<br /><br />Given the reviews and Seth MacFarlane's involvement, I expected good execution. Unfortunately, the premise of the film felt contrived, and I never bought into it. After the halfway point, there were multiple times when I thought \\"This must be the end.\\" and was excited because it meant that I could take a nap. There were crass jokes (which I expected), and then there were jokes that seemed less like jokes and more just like excuses to dump on gay men and people with mental disabilities.<br /><br />In the end, I wish that I had never wasted the money or the time watching this.
B005UBNL0A|5.0|super processor much much better than advertised for the size and speed perfect for a new system will work with any OS.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|My friend recommended so I read in a couple of days.  The content was silly with such a shallow premise.  I kept thinking it would get to a better spot, but no such luck.  Don't bother!
B004SUDPXW|5.0|This is a review on the product and not on the show itself:<br /><br />The product works as expected. Make sure you have a blu-ray compatible device before buying.
0761171703|5.0|I bought this book because I was enraptured with the images I'd seen in advertising and reviews and on Facebook. I wasn't sure whose Xmas gift it was going to be, but I knew I had to buy it for someone. Turns out that it is for me. I can't let it go, and it has been so wonderful to have around in my time of grieving for my lost mother. Or when I'm just having the blahs, or when I need a little spiritual lift. I just love having this book around.

B005AERS74|5.0|I'm a fan of Maroon 5 and wanted to buy one of their CDs but couldn't decide. I decided to buy this one because I like a lot of the songs on the track list. This CD has both upbeat and slow, ballad songs. Adam Levine's voice is amazing in every single one.<br />I definitely recommend this CD to Maroon 5 fans or those who are just discovering Maroon 5's music! :)
B0076DELIG|5.0|Anything by Connelly is going to be a good read.  This was great! I have been reading Harry Bosch for years.  Keep them coming.

030759565X|4.0|After reading the author's blog for quite some time, I was thrilled to get the cookbook. My only disappointment is that most of the recipes I loved on her blog were not in the book! Her writing is wonderful and witty, the pictures are amazing.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|when u think u r purcharsing something on the game u r really doing upgrades to the kindle and when u buy something on the game it is really just puttting that amount on your amozon account. it is a total scam.  I regimens not getting the game.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|May contain spoiler!!!<br /><br />I ordered the kindle edition. The series just went down hill. The only reason I kept reading is just to get the satisfaction of knowing what happened in the end. The book turned into politics.<br />My favorite character died which is irrelevant but it was the most entertaining part for me. Other than that don't care for it .
0345803507|5.0|Great book! Really hated that the books had to come to an end but I enjoyed the way them all very much.
B0015AARJI|5.0|great product works good, wished i had one for all driving games. could not have chosen a better product thanks
B008DM4OTA|5.0|My kids call it the doctor game and have so much fun helping all the different animals. Even though it gets repetitive after a while, they hardly notice and enjoy doing the small things such as changing what the patient's beds look like or picking trash up from the floor. An overall great game. I'd recommend anything from TribePlay for younger kids!
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is a awesome game it is so awesome that I wrote this I allmost peed my pants when I hot this game.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|What a wonderful book.  I  would recommend this book to anyone.  Beautifully written and awe-inspiring especially for those interested in bridging science and spirituality.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|In keeping with the tradition of Amazon for great value + service the Mobile folks are to be commended for their absolutely stellar performance. The best was their early delivery of my back-ordered Galaxy Note II.

B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Great actors, good script, good effects. Intriguing and fun. I love Jessica Lange in both seasons and am looking forward to season 3!
B005HSG3TC|4.0|I am very happy with this purchase. It protects the screen while not in use, it is not bulky and easy to install. In the standing propped position it is also sturdy enough to read and does not topple when you touch the screen.
B000V6ADNC|4.0|Who wouldn't expect Rufus to be a bit eccentric. The only songs I really enjoy on here are Cigarettes/Choc milk, Across the Universe, and One Man Guy.
B009NXV2RK|2.0|I am a Clancy fan and as such was very disappointed by this book.  The charactors are able to extricate themselves from, impossible positions and, quite frankly, unbeliveable situations.  Not his usual effort.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|Rod Stewart has out-done himself with this production.  One more golden record for his collection, I hope.  Go for it!
0525952926|5.0|I enjoy Ken and while a long book it was a quick read.  I feel I know those people. Thanks
0783226063|5.0|That's right, in my opinion David Lynch's film version of \\"Dune\\" is better than Frank Herbert's classic novel.  I know that most fans of the book will probably disagree, but I've also talked with many people who love science fiction, and who found Herbert's novel to be tedious and gimmicky, and its characters shallow, cold, and un-likeable.  By contrast, I didn't think the book was terrible by any means, but I was surprisingly unmoved by it, especially in comparison to Lynch's movie version of \\"Dune,\\" which gets better and more impressive every time I see it.  (If you've never read the novel, but you have seen Lynch's version, I suggest that you read the book and judge for yourself.)<br /><br />My last viewing of the film was also an interesting exercise in Lynch-appreciation, because I watched \\"Eraserhead\\" and \\"Dune\\" back-to-back, so that I could see clearly all of the subtle and sometimes striking Eraserhead-like aspects that Lynch added to \\"Dune,\\" making the film much more intriguing and interesting (and weird) than the often-plodding, often hyper-detailed story in Herbert's novel.  And then the film adds yet another layer -- the amazing music by Toto, along with brilliant themes by Brian Eno (one of my favorites), and the result is a masterpiece.<br /><br />I know that \\"Dune\\" was sharply criticized when it was first released, by movie-goers and reviewers who prefer relatively mindless pap like \\"Star Wars\\" rather than a complex, multi-layered story that does not fit the typical mold, and also by the rabid Herbert fans who regard the novel as their Holy Book, but this happens fairly often with great works of art.  They are commonly not well-received at the time of their initial release, and are best appreciated at a later time, when they are re-discovered.  That's the case with \\"Dune.\\"  This film is stunning in so many ways, and gets better on each viewing.  I think it will garner more and more fans as the years go by.<br /><br />In my opinion, those who saw the film once and walked away disappointed fall into the same category as those who responded in that way to \\"Eraserhead.\\"  They watched it once and said, \\"Huh? What's all this, I don't get it,\\" and walked away.<br /><br />Well, so what, it's their loss.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Catching Fire continues the fast pace of its predecessor, The Hunger Games. It is filled with action and suspense throughout, and is almost impossible to put down once you begin reading it.
034580404X|5.0|When it arrived, it was in pristine condition. A brand new, never been opened trilogy. They're some of the best books I've EVER read!
B008ALAHA4|5.0|I review products without regard to price or necessity.  This is five-star at doing the job that I wish didn't need to be done, and it's expensive too!
B00AMBK6J2|3.0|Not nearly as funny as billed in the trailer. A little clunky and awkward at times. Average comedy at best.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Amazing trilogy. Sad that it ended. I can hardly wait for the rest of the movies to come out. It will be epic.
B0059XTU1S|2.0|I cant believe that I sat through almost 3 hours of this! Some parts were good but overall it was pretty stupid. It reminded me of those Saturday morning action cartoons that my kids used to watch where the charactors are falling, flying through the air, tumbling downhill in one incredible fall after another with no one getting hurt or even seperated from each other.<br /><br />Jackson went overboard with \\"artistic license\\" on this movie since a very large amount was never in the book though the part on how Thorin Oakenshield got his name was pretty original.<br /><br />To put it in a nutshell, I'm very dissapponted in this movie and will not be hitting the theater next year when part 2 is released. I'll wait until someone I know buys a DVD of that one to see it because I fully expect part 2 to be as lame as part one.<br /><br />I gave this flop 2 stars ONLY because SOME parts were good.
B008KE3960|5.0|Great graphics, easy to play. Really good fun. Good variation on tower defense games, one of the best I've played
B0021L9ME6|5.0|Movie is great. Nothing to do with batman.<br />Halle Berry does a very good job in the role.<br />Hopefully there will be more of her in a series with this catwoman.<br />Only bad part of the movie in my opinion was Sharon Stone.
B00A3NQNUU|2.0|fun but but it said after I logged out after 3 minutes connection failed and I had 4bars in wi-fi
B00A757EFW|4.0|Good except for the ads. Controls are intuitive. Challenging. Easy at first, then it gets hard. Try it. You won't be disappointed
B001DJLCPE|5.0|I saw this many. many years ago, back in the 60's. It was the movie that made me forget that &#34;Failsafe&#34; scared the crap out of me. This movie was so dang funny that I have both the VHS, DVD and Blu-Ray versions. It is a CLASSIC. The acting is one of the primary reasons that I can still laugh it. When I first started using a Mac, the alarm sounds I changed to &#34;going toe to toe with the Ruskies.&#34; I will enjoy watching it in whatever format, it is in.<br />The meaning will always be there. Aspect ratio, 5.1 sound, in a fallout shelter, Kubrick made this one of the finest movies ever.<br />Amen!
B00866H7SS|5.0|Loved it. The second book is even better. Can't wait for the third installment. Better than fifty shades of grey.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This movie is phenomenal! I tend to overlook movies with singing or musical numbers because they just feel too cheesy and unrealistic for me - I get major second-hand embarrassment from them! But this movie didn't pepper in songs where they weren't necessary. And the singing is actually good!<br /><br />Anna Kendrick stars as Becca, a girl just looking to \\"pay her dues\\" in the music world by producing music, however, is met with a challenge from her father to just join one club in college - if she doesn't like it, he will help her move I LA to start her music career.<br /><br />Becca joins the Barden Bella's, a group famous for its onstage antics and dull, tired songs that the groups leader, Aubrey, says will get them the championship by \\"sticking with tradition\\".<br /><br />What happens when Becca's world begins to intertwine with the Bella's and the other on-campus singing groups makes for a movie worth watching! Another hilarious role from Rebel Wilson and a breakout star Skylar Astin will have you watching this movie over and over again. I know - I've not turned it off, yet!!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I love playing Angry Birds Rio, now without ads will be the best!!  All my grandkids love it too. Thanks!!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|this game is amazing&hellip;,I reccomend it because it has amazing graphics and amazing details even yhoughbit can lag... it is still an amazing game
B00A17AD36|5.0|This album is out of this world good. This is probably the best purchase I have made all year. This album is destined for greatness and grammy worthy. Just listening to the first few seconds of the first song had me hooked.
B00AQMSJI2|3.0|This a game based on the Playmobil toy. It is a decent game, but I prefer the 3d rpg elements. If gameloft made this a rpg game more like their Dark Knight Rises game, this would be one of the few good games out there. It remains yet another free-to-play IAP game. The RPG elements, however, helped save it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The walking dead is one of the most unpredictable shows I have ever watched. It's so good,  I've watched twenty episodes in three weeks! Great show!
B004ZRV3AU|5.0|Got this the day after I ordered...talk about fast shipping! I tried it out immediately...first attempt, didn't get a straight cut...second attempt, much better. Followed instructions and it worked as described. Love it...making some beer bottle lights for the garage!~
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Descriptive moving story.  Takes you in. Could not put it down.  Anxious to see how the movie matches up to the movie that played in my mind while reading it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it has so many different games. I wish earning coins was easier, but its still a great way to test your gaming skills.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|this is a Great app! never fails! Love that you can have multiple alarms. use it every day! loud or soft
B004JN1D2I|5.0|George R.R. Martin is a superb author. His discription is unparalleled, weaving multiple sub-plots together with ease. A villian character in one plot line quickly becomes the opposite as the that character's sub-plot is exposed. You end up understanding / &#34;feeling&#34; every character with ease. Writes on an adult level. Unbelievable. Rivals Tolkein.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|Love legos, love Minecraft--must have!  My kiddos are going to love opening this on Christmas morning!  Love the Creeper! LOVE the set!
B0076DELIG|5.0|I be lovin me some Michael Connelly....wish he could turn out more Harry Bosch.Please Don't retire anytime soon Harry !
B0076DELIG|5.0|I always look forward to each installment of Harry Bosch.  Connelly is a gifted writer who must also be a hard working writer and I appreciate his efforts.  Always enjoyable.
B00A7CI82I|5.0|A wonderful follow up to the Bourne series, this movie doesn't ruin the series with the lack Jason Bourne.  Renner is awesome.  Great addition to the series.
0316172324|5.0|Corporate books can be dull and not full of anything new. This book is different!! I highly recommend the book to anyone.
B00A0SLTCU|3.0|Storyline could have been clearer.  I am comparing it with the original.  It's true that this one has the up-to-date special effects that the original didn't have.  However the original had a more developed storyline and much more developed characters that helped to get you more interested in the story and care about the characters.
B006CQLGXG|5.0|I was an English Lit. major, and never a big fan of Dickens. He is too long winded. But this book seemed too short. It's not that I felt that it was incomplete. I just enjoyed it so much that I wanted more.<br />Do yourself a favor, and read it at christmas time. I did.
B00AMBK6J2|1.0|This movie was not in the least bit funny.  I cannot believe Seth McFarlane will be presenting the Oscars.  I guess that will be as tedious as this movie was.  Fell asleep after 10 mins.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|I like rpg games and I really enjoy this one.  the best part is being able to choose gender.  I would not spend any $$ on it.  the free bits r enough to entertain.
B000E1YVZU|5.0|Great movie, great soundtrack.  My only complaint was it had a small scratch on the disc that caused it to freeze up halfway through it.  After contacting the vendor, they immediately refunded the purchase price.  Great customer service.
B001GKJ2F2|4.0|Wanted is a great action flick with amazing stunts.  The plotline is pretty simple man is bored with his regular life, finds out his father died the gets dragged into a world he never thought was possible to kill the man who killed his father.  Only to find out he was tricked by the people around him inculding the boss of the people trianning him to be a killer and an ultimate weapon for them to use to their benifit.  Only he finds out the truth and must make a choice to run away or kill them all and \\"let fate sort it all out.\\"<br />I like the ending \\"this is me taking back control of my life...what have you done lately.\\"  So if your looking for a great action flick with great stunts, and lots of fight scenes with guns, knives, and things blowing up then you will love this style of movie.  I have watched it mutiple times so far since I bought it a while ago.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|There is no place to tell you how to play...ie how to claim bingo; how to use power-ups; etc.  You are on you're own to figure it out!
B0098VXBIA|3.0|this was not a bad movie. some funny parts but i wont be watching again any time soon. for a fun pregnancy movie i would watch baby mama instead.
B001OQCV6A|5.0|No issues with packaging or shipping. If you know about Sherlock Holmes this is definitely a movie to buy.. and who would pass up a movie with Robert Downey Jr?
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This game is so much fun! My sister constantly plays it! I recommend it to everyone!I love all of the  different  little animals!
B003FNWR6Y|5.0|I bought this gift for my husband. I was worried that it might get damaged in shipping. When I received it there were no issues at all. The package was just as the description says. A definite buy for any Nintendo lover!
0743487486|5.0|I'm only through the first chapter, but I already have to say that this book is amazing.  I'd imagine that most of the negative reviews are coming from parents who feel called out about their own harmful approach to parenting and are unwilling to change the harmful patterns they have been following with their own children.  I've found it to be nothing but enlightening.<br /><br />People always say stuff like, &#34;Well my parents did ....... and I turned out fine!&#34;  Turning out fine, is not the same as thriving and reaching your full potential as a human being.  Plus, people who respond with that sort of explosive, hostile defensiveness are likely individuals who were never given the proper coping skills and self-esteem needed for constructive dialogue and communication with others.<br /><br />If you the type of parent that wants to learn more about training your child--this is not the book for you (although you are the type of person that really should read it).  If you are the type of parent that wants to learn more about giving your child everything they need to be compassionate and responsive human beings (not just to obey to your commands) even if it takes a bit of extra work, this would be a great book for you.
B002YK8OKC|3.0|If you watch this alone or with your significant other than you will soon be looking at each other thinking the same thing: &#34;How Corny!&#34;<br /><br />But the kids will love it!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|works your mind<br />is fun<br />creative<br />and addicting. I enjoy this game very much and would reccomend it to anyone...especially parents!
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game it is a adicting and fun I love it. Get it is werth it. have fun!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is an excellent book! Many friends raved about it and I finally understand their excitement! It was very well written and I couldn't put it down. =)
B004IFYMYI|1.0|This bluray will not play in my Sony bluray player.  The best I can get it to do is I unplug the player, and reset it from scratch, and THEN the disk will play if I only hit \\"play.\\"  If I try and select a special feature first, it locks up.  When I just put the disk in and click around its features like any other disk, it locks up and I have to restart the player.  If the player weren't Sony, I would suppose this was bc of the player.  But since both the disk and the player are Sony, and the player's brand new, and this doesn't happen with any other disks, I'm pretty sure this means the bluray disk's jacked up.  I tried cleaning the disk, but it's already pristine.  Thanks, Sony.
B00AHSINKO|4.0|A funny and entertaining movie. Good perspective of the relationship from different views of the sexes. It was well worth seeing.
B0086700CM|4.0|best thing to do when Im bored!!<br /> the game provides challenges I want to beat! I still am not sure where I'm young and sometimes I think the game looses sensitivity even its turned it.
B0088O11NU|1.0|It is not what i thought it would be, i was looking for more of a challenge and this is not it
B007SGM084|5.0|This is definitely a very different romance novel and I would strongly suggest to people to read it! The characters are spellbinding and refreshing to the repeated characters of most romances these days. I thoroughly enjoyed and couldn't stop reading all three books. I am so glad I purchased this trilogy!!!
B009FZFONO|5.0|I actually hate the whole &#34;OMG, Zombie apocalypse, we all must all prepare&#34; fad that our culture seems to love so much; however, I thoroughly enjoy this show for more than just their zombie scenes.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|watch the film it's hilarious absolutely fantastic one of the best films that i have watched in a very long time
0060516402|5.0|This book is an instant classic. One of those books that should be read by every businessman or businesswoman. Jim Collins is a great author
B004LWZW9M|5.0|so fantastic to watch very happy great film loved it just wants you to watch it again never get bored
B00AMBH70S|4.0|Good actor....when an actor can make his craft appear natural-convincingly accurate they get my vote...<br /><br />Of course you know a sequel is down the road.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|John Grisham is becoming one of my favorite authors.  This book was so involved that I couldn't predict how it was going to end.  That is a great thing.  Usually I can figure out who is working with who or where things are going but he did such a good job that I was guessing the whole time.
B0036OS3F6|5.0|I've previously worn Sorels with removable liners and decided to try something less bulky.  I was looking for a comfortable winter boot to keep my feet warm and dry and this boot totally fits the bill.  Winter in Northern Michigan can be both very cold and wet. The Crocband Winter Boot is great for both snowy and wet conditions.  It has the wide styling featured in other Crocs footwear which allows me to wiggle my toes in toasty comfort.  I highly recommend this product!
1423140605|5.0|I loved this book.  Going in I thought this was the last one in the series so I was surprised when I realized that it was not.  I love the interaction of the two camps and am so happy that Annabeth is back.  The new characters are very interesting also but Rick Riordan did such a good job with the Percy Jackson series I am so happy to have some of them back.
0451196716|2.0|I originally read this story as part of a series of short stories and it was extremely compelling.  When I saw this book ten years later I had to read it.  Unfortunately, the 300 page book is no different from the 30 page story.  Really; I couldn't tell you what was added.  The story is so basic and the true &#34;horror&#34; is in imagining yourself as part of this and what you would do, so it loses its appeal quickly.  Maybe I had too high of expectations.<br /><br />I''m a huge Stephen King fan, but this belongs as a short, not as a novel.  Imagine singing &#34;99 bottles of beer on the wall&#34; to the end and you get the point.
B007PPE086|5.0|This is such a cool looking doll.  I bought two for a couple 9 year old girls that are way into MH.  My daughter saw the one I got for my god daughter and just couldn't stop talking about how cool it was that it was all black and white.  She told me that she wants one for Christmas now.  Good this the other one I bought is for her.  She will be thrilled.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I loved the books and I didnt want to finish them because I new that would be it.  I highly recommend them
B007G3H8Y0|5.0|Great music, just an awesome fun CD! All of the songs on there are great and it is something I will listen to a lot.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|cool graphics &amp; my child really likes this game . my grandma even plays it. and its even better cause its free ... :-)
B006ZS81GG|5.0|I'm so glad I bought this album. I love all of the songs (except one haha). The deluxe version also has 3 songs that the regular version doesn't have, and those ones are all great too!
B00AA7O22U|5.0|The first movie was action Gold and now they've done it again. Plot (who cares) Action (Untouchable) We want more!!!
B0052QXAEK|4.0|Good love story . Not to long and the which was a nice touch. Some of the scenery was well placed too. The side characters had there one thing going on too .

B001BKAEHW|4.0|This a solid album. I can listen all the way through. Better than his newer stuff. I would definitely recommend it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I haven't read any of Colleen's other books, but I know they must be good because this one captured me, body, mind, and soul. Her characters are relatable, sarcastic, emotional, lovable, and will leave you wishing that they could jump from the book to be your friends because they are just so thoroughly awesome. From the way things play out, to the things that are said, leave your heart racing one minute, aching the next, and sputtering with shock a few seconds later. Job well done, Colleen! It's hard to find such well written, capturing books as this one these days. To anyone who is thinking of buying this book, I suggest, with no hesitation what so ever, that you do so immediately and read it all in one go if at all possible!
B004J4WNL2|5.0|This book QUIET, was so much fun to read. The reason for me is that she has so much research and fascinating revelations that brought huge &#34;a ha's to my understanding. I finally could see  WHY I had certain reactions that seemed so different from the &#34;norm&#34;. Well, no . What I found was validation: I'm a dyed in the wool, introvert.  But beyond self revealing aspects, was her presentation of all the ways education and corporate life are geared to the Extrovert. It was a rewarding experience to understand how culturally, we went from a &#34; values&#34; centered society to a &#34;cult of the personality&#34; where we are today. Her book makes so much sense on so many levels: and she has terrific footnotes to support all. Have an intriguing time reading.
B007DA2FHG|5.0|I was thoroughly entertained by this movie, and felt a deeper respect for horses afterwards. My students worked on a research website last year whose focus was rescuing horses, and preventing them from being sent to slaughter houses for their meat. We learned so much about horses and their empathetic ways. Horses should never be killed for their meat. To do so is a tragedy. This movie reinforces the bond that man and horse have had for centuries. I loved the Devon location at the beginning of the movie, and the beautiful cinematography. I appreciated seeing the camaraderie between the English and German soldier who rescued Joey from the barbed wire. My thought throughout the battle scenes was how senseless war is and how much of a waste it is. Though this movie hurts to watch at times, and, yes, I cried in spots, it is a wonderful movie.
B008X9Z37A|3.0|this little cover works good for my kindle fire hd. of course the leather one would be nicer. can' t beat the price on this one
B00003CXZ1|3.0|The price was a bit expensive considering  I can get both the lara croft for 10$. However, I already have the 2nd disc so I brought this to finish my collection. Overall, this is a great movie and who doesn't love Angelina Jolie!
B007HGPBRC|5.0|Hitchens is always an engaging read, but this really pulls you in as you read about the last bit of his life. Witty, funny, not a word of self pity. A really fine work that you will think about for awhile.
B002GHIPYI|5.0|These headphones sound fantastic for the price, and I can just about guarantee you will not be disappointed if you are looking for great sound on a low budget. I was not expecting much from these, but took a chance based on the positive reviews, and I'm glad I did; the first time I put these on, I was floored that such inexpensive headphones could sound so good. (I should note that I listen to them using a Fiio L11 line-out connector and E11 headphone amp with bass boost, using high-bitrate audio from an iPhone).<br /><br />These headphones offer clear, dynamic, sparkling highs, and deep resonant bass that does not wander into other frequencies or drown them out.  They have a very wide soundstage, and excellent instrument seperation and clarity for most music types.  Vocals sound great, as does live and non-synthesized music. These also have great spatial arrangement, and when listening to an orchestra you will feel as though instruments are playing all around you, not just \\"in your head\\" like with many low-end closed-back headphones.<br /><br />The only drawbacks are that the mids are a bit recessed, and the highs can be overwhelming and too sharp sometimes.  These would not get my highest recommendation for rap or trance (even though I personally enjoy listening to both with these), because I think that if those are your main genres, headphones with less sparkle and more \\"punchy\\" bass would probably be preferred.  I do find these to be great for other electronica, though, and are one of my all-around favorite pairs for all types of music.<br /><br />Now for comfort, stlye, and build quality.  I have a large head, and I find these to be very comfortable, and the self-adjusting headband works flawlessly.  The style of these headphones looks a bit like low-budget AKG's, but I personally enjoy the big, round, matte black and red cups, and the somewhat retro, purpose-built design; like 80's studio cans... They are lightweight and plastic, but appear to be well constructed.  The cheap pleather ear covers do get warm, but not enough so to annoy me -- I generally forget these are on after a few minutes.<br /><br />Lastly, although I know I might get some backlash for this, I want to give one final opinion in the form of a comparsion: I think that these sound similar to, and actually better than, Grado SR80i's (for my personal listening tastes).  Reason being, they have a similar (semi)open design that allows for the wide soundstage and fantastic clarity throughout the highs that are characterstic of both pairs, but for me the Grado's lack fullness in the lower frequencies.  These HD681's have a more well-rounded sound, with a much greater low-end response, and almost as good performace in all other sound ranges, just not quite as much clarity and warmth. I still love my Grado's for rock, jazz, and classical, and understand why they are regarded as among the best in the $100 range, but I find myself getting much more use out of these $30 HD681's.
B009YP9L7U|1.0|This was the most boring book I've read in a long time.  Was the writer paid by the page?  No suspense, just  repetitious and predictable.
0446580848|1.0|I have read many of Nelson De Mille's books and have enjoyed all, even those not in the John Corey series. I don't know if the author was trying to make this as long as possible but, in  so doing, left out the action. Corey is actually annoying. His barbs are non-stop. Instead of talking there should be doing. So much smoozing. So much background. So much thinking. And so little action. It seemed to me DeMille was confused. Was he writing John Corey or the witty, non-cop John Sutter. Don't bother.
B008ASLK8A|5.0|This is just a great movie and a must to own! Robert Downey and Jude Law are<br />superb in this movie!
B007SGLZP8|2.0|It seems that some writers, the more they write, the farther from reality they get. This appears to be what has happened with this writer.  I enjoy a good mystery and \\"who did its\\". but the story has to be somewhat believable. This one is just too way out there. The whole PLAN is too unbelievable, if just one little thing goes wrong, it is curtains. The hero is so smart and so clever that he outsmarts everyone yet he gets himself in a situation where he is locked up for 10 years. Yet he spends time in prison, gets close enough to a fellow prisoner that the guys confides in him about a planned robbery and murder. Then following a brilliant Rule 35 release from prison, the hero has cosmetic surgery and changes enough in two months to completely fool his former prison mate. meet with him and for days fool him into believing he is someone else. Too much of a chameleon act to be believed and just totally lost me as a reader.<br /><br />This writer has done way better than this and I am disappointed.

B006JPS1OM|2.0|I bought this for my kindle fire hd. It worked really well, even saved the page when I shut down. However, at chapter 4, it decided to load and shut down on it's own. No matter what I tried, nothing worked. It was an okay game for the time I had it.

B0000029PC|5.0|These old Szell recordings are pure gold, all of them. While done in 1958-1960, you really wouldn't notice all that much, the CBS recordings of that time are so good, and the remastering so well done. I own a few Schumann sets ([[ASIN:B000001GY9 The live Bernstein one from the 80's]] and the [[ASIN:B0000042EJ Dohnanyi set]]) and neither compares to this one (why I, or anyone else, would have multiple copies of complete Schumann symphonies is another matter). Szell shapes every phrase beautifully where others just seem to run right over them. The 3rd is particularly wonderful.

B009E3EYMY|5.0|I tried to go to this concert, but didn't get tickets.  The DVD is the second best thing.<br /><br />Live CD is awesome.
B00A80SHFM|3.0|I first saw Les Mis on Broadway in the early 90's (and I've seen it many times since), when the back of the program promised me the movie would be out within a year - so I've been waiting a long time for this. Perhaps my expectations were a bit too high, but I wanted to enjoy this soundtrack much more than I did.<br /><br />As other reviews have mentioned, the songs NOT appearing on this disc are incredibly disappointing.  Similarly, whole verses are cut out of songs here and there - if you're familiar with any of the stage recordings it will likely be jarring to listen to at first (I had several moments of \\"wait, that's just not right\\").<br /><br />I'm in the camp of preferring my songs primarily sung rather than acted.  While Barks, Hathaway and Tveit do an excellent job of emoting *while* singing, with Barks being the standout here.  Jackman seems to pull more of a Rex Harrison and speak/acts most of his music.  I see Valjean as a strong character in general, and Jackman's portrayal often plays soft, perhaps even immature at times.  One exception is his \\"Bring Him Home,\\" which is actually fairly well-done.  Crowe makes an okay Javert, all things considered, and I actually enjoyed most of his \\"Stars\\" until the very end - which just seemed weak to me.  I prefer the more traditional \\"power\\" ending as it's usually played on stage. Then, in \\"One Day More,\\" Crowe's voice sounds so constrained it made *my* throat hurt.<br /><br />WHY did they add the song \\"Suddenly?\\" Oh, wait...it's so they can have one number that's eligible for the various awards for Best Original Song (think \\"You Must Love Me\\" in Evita or \\"Learn to Be Lonely\\" in Phantom).  Maybe I should withhold judgement because it will play better in the movie, but I am currently NOT a fan.  It just doesn't seem to fit with Valjean's character or the rest of the musical (unless it's fitting with Jackman's softer, more sensitive Valjean).  Give me back \\"Lovely Ladies\\" or \\"Do You Hear the People Sing,\\" please.<br /><br />Overall, the soundtrack just doesn't have the same \\"oomph\\" of previous recordings.  With that and the incomplete score, I highly recommend waiting until the full version comes out OR treating yourself to one of the stage versions.  If you must have this and must have it now, buy the mp3 version and save yourself a few bucks - you won't miss anything by not having the liner notes.

0307887448|3.0|This novel is a geek's greatest hits trip through 80s pop culture: Dungeon and Dragons, Max Headroom, Orchestral Maneuvers in the Dark, Robotech, John Hughes, Blade Runner, Zork, Joust. I was a nerdy teenager in those days and enjoyed the references. However, I'm not a teenager now, and the humbling experiences encountered on the way to middle age bring a more reflective mood. The novel's modern teenage protagonists have a simplistic world view: pro-individual, anti-religion, anti-corporation, and environmentally apocalyptic. These positions are stated as truth, with no commentary as to why the protagonists have taken them. As the story unfolds, nothing challenges them to reflect on these youthful positions and therefore there is no real character development.<br /><br />In the end, the novel felt like an enjoyable video game. But literature it ain't.

B008NR8YXC|4.0|This performance exemplies the beauty of Bach's Clavier (keyboard) work. It has a transparency which is rare among even the best perfrormances of others. It is clear that Schiff has a gift for J. S. Bach. The interweaving voices, which are heard so clearly, produce an almost imaginary descant above and sometimes below the written score. We understand now why some performers<br />have a tendency to hum along while playing. Thankfully Schiff does not do this and so the hearer is free to imagine or even hum to himself what he hears in his mind's ear. The mountain ranges of Bach's polyphony produce a luminous glow around their peaks.<br /><br />The only problem I have with these four CDs is in their lack of information which should appear on the screen of your player. The only information given is the track number and the elapsing time of the band that is playing. When playing the CDs on a computor the net does not produce any tags. By knowing the order of Bach's Preludes and Fugues and the twelve notes encompassed by the octive of a modern keyboard it is possible to figure out the key while the ear will tell you if you are listening to a prelude or fugue or if it is in a major or minor key. Still, It would be nice to have that information readily at hand.
B004ELUGGY|4.0|The first thing to say about this recital is that it gave a great number of people in Vienna a lot of pleasure - and the disc will equally give similar pleasure to a great number of people world-wide, and I include myself. I found the technical side of the presentation to provide excellent visual and sonic reproduction.<br /><br />However, like all artistes, Lang Lang has many strengths to offer but equally he is not yet infallible. Consequently this recital is at its best when he plays to his strengths and is at its least effective when those same strengths do not naturally serve the chosen music so well.<br />Lang Lang is essentially a very emotional player and plays everything as he feels - and he feels everything very deeply. One could summarise this by describing him as a romantic. His playing contains a great deal of expression from loud to soft and especially, enormous fluctuations of tempo almost moment by moment. The most successful parts of this recital are therefore those that respond best to such a romantically emotional approach.<br /><br />The two Beethoven sonatas, coming from a composer writing at the transitional stage progressing from the more formal classical period to the freer romantic period, are well able to sustain such an approach. Indeed there are many breathtakingly beautiful moments in these interpretations, especially in the slower sections. The Chopin encores respond equally well to such an approach.<br /><br />The Albeniz is more of a mixed bag. The slower sections are effective in these ways but the faster sections lack the rhythmic discipline required to capture the Spanish dance elements being portrayed - and Spanish dancing is nothing if not tightly rhythmical. Anyone who doubts this could refer to recordings by either Larrocha or Hamilyn who are both able to incorporate the freer romantic elements with the tighter dance elements.<br /><br />The same problems are to be found in the Prokofiev sonata where strict tempo is essential almost throughout. If this is not maintained the slow central movement loses shape and direction and the driven outer movements fail in their dramatic drive. Interestingly it is the most motoric last movement, a toccata, that is undoubtedly the most successful here and why? - Because Lang Lang plays it almost entirely in strict tempo. Unfortunately he does not do this in the preceding two movements. There are numerous examples on disc of the benefits of playing this music with more disciplined rhythmical control. Lang Lang himself quotes his admiration for Richter and Sokolov and to this I would add the benchmark Pollini CD and Lang Lang's contemporary Yuja Wang to his recommendations. Sokolov can be seen playing the Prokofiev on a fine recital DVD and there is an alternative excellent recital by Gavrylyuk on DVD containing Prokofiev's 6th and 7th sonatas as part of a technically astonishing recital.<br /><br />I am aware that this review will not please many of Lang Lang's countless fans who will resist the provisos above. However the job of a reviewer is to try and give an honest appraisal without bias and with a view to being helpful, giving supporting reasons for the opinions that are expressed. That is what is being offered here and it is best to conclude with the opening comments that `The first thing to say about this recital is that it gave a great number of people in Vienna a lot of pleasure - and the disc will equally give similar pleasure to a great number of people world-wide, and I include myself.' I would suggest that 4 stars is a fair assessment bearing in mind all of the above.ntained the slow central movement loses shape and direction and the driven outer movements fail in their dramatic drive.

B007LKT7WO|5.0|I find posthumous recordings and writings creepy and exploitative and generally try to avoid them. Had this on vinyl years ago and just got a copy that was more practical than collectible. He started out a poet and went out a poet. If others did want to help share his work and help themselves in the process we might not have ever heard of him. Sitting in front of a microphone letting the words out seems to be what he wanted and it sure works. A lot of the Door's incidental music is appropriate and compelling,  but included in the last three cuts added since the original release is ''babylon fading' in which the narrative following sound effects is just irritating.<br /><br />His words get the five stars.<br /><br />that babylon cut also gives it five stars in creepy exploitation.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|The LOTR series set the template for this film. It incorporates many of the same characters, sets, and sound track.<br /><br />LOTR was arguably the best film(s) ever made. No one expected this from Peter Jackson, whose films before and since have left little to rave about. There were scenes where I felt Jackson was resting on his laurels, not wanting to do a second take, while there were other scenes which left me breathless.<br /><br />In case you didn't realize it, this is a prequel to LOTR. In this story a younger Bilbo (Martin Freeman) joins Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and the slobbish Dwarves regain their mountain taken by a dragon. In this episode, Bilbo acquires his sword \\"Sting\\" and \\"The Ring.\\" They do not reach the mountain.<br /><br />Gandalf appears to be our only source for truisms and memorable lines. \\"Your house is now behind you, the world is ahead.\\" or \\"Evil will always look for a foothold in the world\\" or \\"True courage is not knowing when to take a life, but when to spare one.\\" This written with WWII in the mind of Tolkien. I couldn't help but think of the dragon as Germany or of the Elves appeasement philosophy that the world was at peace while battles raged on.<br /><br />Martin Freeman has a very strong British accent, unlike the other Hobbits. Initially I thought his character was a weak link, similar to Elijah Wood as Frodo. He grew stronger in his role as the film progressed, although I am not convinced he was the best choice.<br /><br />Sylvester McCoy plays Radagast, the Brown. He is a wizard Peter Jackson cut out of the original screenplay for \\"The Fellowship of the Rings.\\" The 90 year old Christopher Lee returns to his role as does Cate Blanchett, Ian Holm, Elijah Wood, Andy Serkis, and Hugo Weaving.<br /><br />A worthy effort.
B00785P2QC|4.0|a very fun and a easy way to spend your time and has very good grahics would recommend this game to any one
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I like how the story was organized, it's not the usual run a zombie is after me type for thing. The different perspective gives a different texture to the story. I loved the part where it takes about the queen and how Buckingham Palace was turned into a fortress. This book can make a killing if it was made into a tv series. Most likely will give The Walking Dead a run for its money.

B001UV4XWY|4.0|The year is 1976. Norma Lewis (Cameron Diaz) is a teacher who loves Sarte and teaches \\"No Exit\\" in her classroom, something that is a flag for symbolism and oddball. Arthur (James Marsden) is a NASA scientist. When Arlington Steward (Frank Langella) appears at their door, their dream life becomes a Phantasm nightmare. He gives them a box with simple instructions: Push the button and someone you don't know dies and you get a million dollars. After the payoff, our couple gets cold feet suspecting they are being set up for the next kill when some stranger pushes the button next.<br /><br />The theme is set for the human race. This is what corporations do in third world countries where they exploit and sometimes kill workers in order to make money. Push the button, get a million dollars. The film turns weird after they push the button as it unleashes a sci-fi series of events that keeps you guessing.<br /><br />If you noticed they lived in house number \\"7321\\" which adds up to lucky 13, something that would be more significant if this was a horror film. This is based on a short story and only Diaz's character was really developed. I had the feeling scenes were cut or deleted. There was an opportunity to utilize some neat scenes and special effects, but they opted for some water tricks instead. I would have loved this film if they showed more behind the scenes stuff instead of creating a mystery. If you are going to create a geek film, don't pull punches and try to make an Alfred Hitchcock Presents The Outer Limits.<br /><br />Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|Only slightly better than the first. The only reason I am reading is because the books were a gift and I feel obligated. At least in this book she says &#34;holy crap&#34;, less than in the first...I expect this is the sort of book someone will try and make an even more ridiculous movie out of....
B000U7169M|4.0|I have suggested before, maybe somewhat controversially, if you're looking for horror, you don't have to go any further than the Bible for inspiration. It is full of hellions, fallen angels, possessions, promiscuous women, brutal characters and my personal favourite horror sub-genre, the apocalypse.<br />Everyone's familiar with the likes of: The Omen, Rosemary's Baby, The Wicker Man, John Carpenter's Prince of Darkness, The Prophecy; the list is endless and that's not even starting on the possession-type movies such as The Rite, The Last Exorcism of Emily Rose and the classic, The Exorcist.<br />What I plumped for was The Reaping, a 2007 film starring Hilary Swank (Million Dollar Baby, The Resident, Buffy the Vampire Slayer), David Morrisey (Centurion, soon to be seen as The Governor in series 3 of The Walking Dead), Idris Elba (Prometheus, 28 Weeks Later, The Unborn), Stephen Rea (The Devil's Mercy, Underword Awakening, FeardotCom) and a nice turn from none other than Charley Brewster himself William Ragsdale (Fright Night).<br /><br />Being set in the bible belt of America added a nice touch of southern gothic. Having spent a little time in America's south, I found the portayal of southern stereotypes here a little excessive; but not entirely far off the mark. With regards performances, I found Morrisey's attempt at a southern drawl quite distracting which is in contrast to Idris Elba's American accent, which seems to improve with every film he's in. Swank copes well in the lead role and Rea has very little to do in his role. It is AnnaSophia Robb's portrayal of the creepy child at the centre of the events occurring at Haven which I found to be noteworthy.<br /><br />Be warned, there's LOTS of CGI. This may be forgivable since in the film, we see the Ten Plagues of Egypt visited upon a small town in the deep south. Rivers of blood, raining frogs, plagues of locusts, festering boils and sores, it's all here! However, I particularly didn't like the CG effects at the end which, to be honest, reminded me of an episode of Buffy. However, at the time of watching, The Reaping was five years old and I suppose should be given a little leeway.<br /><br />Overall, the set-up which sees missionary turned world renowned scientist Swank travelling around the world disproving \\"miracles\\" by revealing the scientific facts behind the phenomena is very well done but I cannot help but think this film lacked pace in parts and then, when I really wanted to see a little more, I was left unsatisfied. Moreover, you'd think it would be relatively easy to make a film about the ten plagues somewhat scary... but instead the movie is incredibly safe and mainstream, undoubtedly to get that R/15 rating in order to generate a greater return from ticket sales by making it accessible to a wider audience.<br />It's not quite the holy horror hokum I was expecting but The Reaping was entertaining enough with the obligatory plot twists to keep me watching for the duration of its 100 minute running time; and I felt this was a decent change from the usual bible-based horror that is prevalent in the genre.e end which, to be honest, reminded me of an episode of Buffy.

B004O3YGMC|2.0|This app used to be my go to app to control my computer but since they announced splashtop 2 and \\"upgraded\\" the streamer, splashtop 1's performance went down the drain. on hspa with full signal, I'm lucky to perform 3 actions before the screen freezes and I have to log out then back in for a refresh.  They intentionally crippled splashtop 1 i n hopes of getting you to pay a monthly fee for splashtop 2 to be able to access your system outside the LAN.    The splashtop streamer is also extremely annoying. there is no option to start up minimized. you have to minimize the streamer everytime you start the computer up. it's another shameless way to advertise their new stuff.    UPDATE: I have complained to the techsupport and it seems that the new streamer has been crippling splashtop 1. They sent me a direct link to an older streamer that works fine when streaming over 3g and other wireless networks. [...]  Hope that helps everyone else.

B001HM1PFO|5.0|This is a timeless whimsical rock opera with catchy (very catchy!) tunes, tongue-in-cheek drama and a tear-jerker end.  (yes, i do shed a tear at the end every time I watch it...).  It is rated &#34;R&#34; but I would recommend parents watch it and determine for themselves if it is suitable for their children.  I can't believe there are many out there that have not already seen it - especially the baby boomers.  I really believe it is a 'must see' for (almost) everyone with a zest for music and whimsy!!
B005NJU8PA|5.0|A completely ordinary cookbook/survival training manual/language acquisition tool, that teaches how to butcher rabbits and rapidly devour large amounts of ice cream. The chapter on \\"meta learning, or learning how to learn, should be taught in elementary school. It really is a swiss army knife of learning tools, and I am very happy to own it.

B000007UXS|5.0|The Bends is one of Radiohead's best albums, especially for those who love Radiohead's earlier rock albums. The vinyl itself is very thick and heavy, good quality production. Vinyl is housed in a quirky sleeve with yorke's juvenile art and the song lyrics. My only complaint is that it skips on one of the tracks. Anyhow, very happy to own this!
B0088X7YU0|4.0|While I generally liked this film, the story needed a lot more work.  As a pilot for a TV series, this story would have been fine. More than fine, actually. For a full length feature film, it needed a whole lot more work.<br /><br />Story<br /><br />I did like that we got to see Ibanez, Rico and Carl again. And, these characters are really the linchpins holding this whole movie together. The problem with the story is that just when new trooper characters are introduced, they are then almost immediately killed off. So, you try to invest time in these new characters only to see them killed by bugs quickly. Yes, this did happen in the first Starship Troopers, but not within 5-10 minutes after meeting the character.<br /><br />The story starts out that basically Ibanez loses her ship, the John A. Warden, to Carl who takes it over on a 'classified' mission. Of course, knowing Carl and his predilection for brain bugs, you can guess where he takes the ship. So, after an assault mission against a small asteroid populated by the familiar infantry bugs, we meet a troop of soldiers who manage to survive that assault, along with their leader 'hero' who's being detained on some trumped up charges.  So, the John A. Warden goes missing and all heck breaks loose.  Suffice it to say that they end up on a chase after the Warden, meet up with it, deal with Carl (in a freaked out state) and then attempt to take control of the Warden.  Unfortunately, they do all the wrong things and the brain bug retakes control over the ship who ultimately crashes it on Earth.<br /><br />After Rico, in his space station that almost gets rammed by the Warden on the way to Earth, decides to gear up and head down to the ship, the space station heats up some nukes 'just in case'.  So, everything goes from bad to worse and more troopers die and the nukes are blown out of the sky.  Rico ends up playing space cowboy and saves the day and Ibanez and Carl.  Of course, the rest of the troopers were expendable.<br /><br />This is a fairly typical shallow cartoon storyline and would have worked great to introduce characters for a series.  As a standalone production, it's rings very hollow and feels under produced.<br /><br />Sex Scenes<br /><br />While there were some sex scenes in the original Paul Verhoeven film, it wasn't nearly as gratuitous as it is in this film.  Frankly, it wasn't really necessary to see CGI characters doing that. In a film, it can work. With CGI, it's just really doesn't work.  At least, not unless the characters are a lot more photo realistic.  So, frankly, those scenes could have been left out.<br /><br />Graphics<br /><br />The Trooper armor suits are extremely well done.  The metal looks like metal and the suits look very real, when they are geared up. However, the faces, hands and bodies of the CG characters feel like cartoons, flat, dull and unreal.  The mouth movements might as well just be open/close.  There's no real emotion in the lips. So, while you have the feeling of solid metal suits and weapons in space, the skin and bodies look and move in unreal ways.  So, there was definitely some corners cut on the motion capture needed to make this a whole lot more real.  The best part of this is definitely the armor suits, which look spectacular. Beyond this, that's where the CGI begins to fall apart.  Again, the faces look flat and dull, the eyes are too dark and the skin and skin folds and musculature look like a video game.  I was hoping for just a bit more realism in that part of production.<br /><br />Production<br /><br />I was hoping for a similar feel to the Paul Verhoeven film. That is, clips of the computer asking 'Would you like to know more?'. Sure, it's been done, but it's also a staple. It sets a tone and a mood. It's what makes a Starship Trooper film a Starship Trooper film. These segments are like segues that lead you to the next segment. They hook them together. There was no tying element like this in ST Invasion. In fact, therewasn't much of an invasion actually.<br /><br />Overall<br /><br />The movie would have made a good pilot episode to begin a TV series. It sets up enough characters that you feel it could turn into a well done series about this set of troopers who do their own private battles in a specific area of combat.  Not all mobile infantry are just grunts that are expendable.  There have to be a more elite class that do special ops.  So, here was a great opportunity to focus on one of those special ops groups.  Instead, the movie just floundered into way too familiar and predictable territory instead of taking a chance and becoming something great.wasn't much of an invasion actually.<br /><br />Overall<br /><br />The movie would have made a good pilot episode to begin a TV series.

B0076DELIG|4.0|People that like Jack Reacher novels by Lee Child, will like the Harry Bosch novels by Michael Connelly. There is a quiet determination about this character.  He isn't a young stud anymore, he's a seasoned detective who will go the distance to get it right.  His personal life isn't ideal with a teenage daughter to raise, but he loves her and will go out of his way to protect her from the filth he has to deal with everyday.  This time Harry is part of the &#34;Cold Case&#34; squad and goes back to a case he started more than 20 years ago.  A good read.
B008JFUUIA|4.0|Anna Kendrick is Beca, who is starting her first day of college because her dad is forcing her. She wants to be a music producer, and spends her free time doing mashups on her DJ equipment. She is pissed and just wants to get through school so she can live her dream.<br /><br /> She eventually is coerced into trying out for the prestigious a capella all girl group the Barden Bellas. Who are suffering as well. They lost the singing competition to their arch rival the all-boys group, the Trebles when their leader Aubrey (one of my favorite True Blood Characters from season 2) played by Anna Camp suddenly chucked all over the audience. Now the group is hurting for participants and have a seemingly nonredeemable stigma placed upon them.<br /><br />The new blood in the Barden Bellas are an eclectic bunch including Fat Amy played by Rebel Wilson who is hysterical. I loved when she was on screen.<br /><br /> What's a girl movie without a love interest. Skyar Astin plays Jesse who is very interested in Beca. He is charming, adorable and can sing. What more can a girl ask for?<br /><br />This is a comedy on so many levels with funny lines, moments and the hysterical duo of Elizabeth Banks and John Michael Higgins who stole each scene they are in.<br /><br /> I LOVED it. Seriously, I wasn't as interested when it was in the theaters. A lot of my friends wanted to see it but it seem young and boring to me. A bunch of girls singing in a competition. Whatev! It was so much more than that. This for me was a breakout film with so many favorite moments it is hard to sum it all up. It was funny, entertaining, and made me smile. There were some serious performances here by some of Hollywood's young actresses.  Anna Kendrick was awesome. I had never seen Anna before Twilight and had no idea she had such chops. She has lead actress written all over her and I love watching her. There is so much to say but I will just leave you with this...see it. The movie is actually funny and the soundtrack great! You will find yourself singing along and any movie that continually references The Breakfast Club can't be bad right!?track great! You will find yourself singing along and any movie that continually references The Breakfast Club can't be bad right!?

B005ERYEGU|4.0|A must read book that changes the way you will think about the art of sales.  It is a very easy read.  Took me less than a day to get through it.  Aaron Ross at times seems to be tooting his own horn, but who wouldn't if they were a sales machine.
B003TGMFG4|5.0|This book is extremely interesting and I have re-read it several times. I like that it's based of true events and written by a man who empathizes with the main character. A person who isn't materialistic and thinks outside the mainstream box would enjoy.
B005ZUR724|3.0|Gameloft has very poor customer service; however, this almost week long delay for Order and Chaos is Amazon's fault. I suggest you email Kindle support and demand timely updates. Amazon should not make its customers wait this long or we will go elsewhere.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I think that every kid should at least play this game once a day in their hole life and they should have some fun with this awesome game.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was the first novel I have read by Gillian Flynn and I absolutely loved it!  It keeps you guessing throughout the entire book.  Even though I finished reading it a couple days ago, I can't stop thinking about it.  I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for an intelligent, fast-paced read.

B005BRS8Z6|1.0|This book was suggested by a dear friend as good inspirational reading for our holiday book club gathering.  I typically prefer a good historical fiction novel, but approached this material with an open mind and an open heart.  I grew increasingly frustrated with Mr. Ruiz's blanket statements of &#34;do this and it will make you happy&#34; with nothing credible to support such a bold directive.  By the end of the book, Mr. Ruiz has provided for the unsuspected and misguided a entire quiver full of excuses of how to get through life without ever challenging yourself or accepting responsibility for your deficiencies.  If you like this book, other suggested reading material would be &#34;I'm Good Enough, I'm Smart Enough, and Doggone It, People Like Me!: Daily Affirmations With Stuart Smalley&#34;.

B009NXV2RK|4.0|I am still reading this with about 25% to go. it is a very convoluted plot with several anomalies - in one scene, an image shot with a 300mm lens on a Nikon DSLR is 'emailed' from the camera! THere is no DSLR camera available that is capable of doing that!<br /><br />Compared with the stories actually written by Clancy, this is unrealistic, US authorities seem to have worldwide powers overriding the laws of the countries in which they operate, kidnapping is frequent and acceptable, the first such instance was in Rainbow Six where a suspect is arrested in Sydney, taken to Alice Springs and returned to USA without the Australian authorities being involved or informed

Yes, I love this battery, my Kindle experience is perfect for me now.

0307887898|5.0|A business startup is synonymous with vision according to Eric Ries, and who can argue with him? If you don't see a money making enterprise into the future why start a business in the first place? But a vision alone isn't enough to success in business. You have to keep measuring; that's where the science begins. To measure is the beginning of science. Take risks and \\"leap\\", but always measure.<br /><br />Ries added a new perspective for me to word 'pivot'. Last I'd heard of the word was with a pivot table in Excel, which where some piece of information remained fixed, while other information could be grouped with respect to that pivot point. The dictionary meaning of the 'pivot' is a \\"a pint, point, or short shaft on the end of which something rests and turns...\\" [dictionary dot com].<br /><br />According to Ries, pivot is change.<br /><br />Opposite of pivot, or change, is to persevere, or keep working at your strategic hypothesis. But if you believe your hypothesis is incorrect, then you need to make a change, or pivot. But change with respect to the original hypothesis, and that's where the pivoting, or fixed pointed-ness, comes into play with better understanding of the previous assumptions, or as one might call: experience.<br /><br />Start a business apropos of what's in this book.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|If you like M&S's first album then this shouldn't disappoint. They have a really beautiful sound that makes me want to stop and actually listen, as opposed to just having them on in the background.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This book is different than others I have read from this author. I have felt so many emotions reading this book. It's a wonderfully beautiful, sad story. With an ending that is unexpected. Defiantly worth the read:)  now I need a chapter break!

He blames childhood friends for getting into drugs, gangs etc. Then he blames the band he was in for everything else in his life. He claims to be the best singer ever, and to be the only one that has \\"paid his dues\\" even his ex band mates that have been going for 40 years. When he left the biggest band in the world, at the time, he didn't go on to have the greatest solo carreer in music history, no! While the so called evil ex band mates were carrying on the name, he was able to stroll back in and blow another oportunity to stay on top. This book isn't full of anything that I haven't heard before, exept the constant \\"it wasn't me!\\" theme. I am sorry I gave this has been my money!!!
B004HW7JH4|5.0|What can I say.  Each season gets better.  I worked at a major ad agency in NYC in the 70s, so this whole series has brought back a lot of memories.
B009WO7NQO|1.0|It is so bad I have no words don't buy it. I started playing and as soon as I played level one I knew it was a rip off.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|One of two movies will win the best picture Oscar for 2012: Lincoln or The Dark Knight Rises.<br /><br />The grittiness of the third Batman movie by Christopher Nolan is particularly exceptional. While the plot is to save the City of Gotham, as always, the stories are in the whys of the motivations behind the well-developed characters' actions.  This is the great common approach to the storytelling in both Lincoln and the Dark Knight Rises. And it makes a very strong storytelling, indeed.<br /><br />The Dark Knight Rises starts off with evil's physical personification as stereotyped in many minds: a big burly man with a mask over his face. But we, the audience, have come to know what extreme evil might really look like: from sweet-faced medical students to twenty-something young men from affluent suburbs of America. The story goes on showing the transformation of ordinary honest working people to become extraordinary, neither by following what they are told to do, nor waiting to be told what to do--but doing what they think is the right thing to do by understanding the greater intentions that truly matter.<br /><br />As for the Oscars, my vote for the best picture of 2012 would be this one, The Dark Knight Rises. Because Lincoln was easier to write, as it was already written time and again from myriad perspectives for over a century, and it was a matter of creating a great film, as it is. The Dark Knight Rises' writing is original; a much, much more difficult task, and a great film.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|The 1st season was great, and they did it again!  Wonderful crazy season! Can't wait for the next year! Awesome!
B005PK553C|2.0|I decided to check it out because of all the hype. Boy was the hype ridiculous. The first episode was reasonable and it got me to watch the second one. By the third episode I've completely given up. The characters in the family are completely unlikable and the show just goes overboard. Random useless raunch.
B008L1PYQU|4.0|It is nice to be able to hear the drums and some of the other instruments. It is a shame that they messed with what might be one of their greatest songs Detroit Rock City. I never liked the extra &#34;get downs&#34; added in other mixes and it ruins this one.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I like the puzzles on this app, there ins a good variety and a few options on the peice quantity I am able to work with.
B000WCDI5K|5.0|If you like the Jet, snow patrol, oasis and The strokes then your gonna love The Killer's indie rock cd Sawdust! Bought this for my husband and he loves the songs on this album. shadow play song is the best! Received the cd in mint condition. Came within a good amount of time. Definitely would buy this again from the same people.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|The book told of Chris' life story and shared many details I didn't think would be possible.  He talked about being a sniper as if it were a job instead of some glamorous title one has and made it sound real to life.  I'm so impressed that he was able to hold his marriage together for all those years...must one heck of a wife!
B007HACDLK|4.0|I enjoy all Vince Flynn's books.  I doubt if I missed more than one. There are all easy reads and hard to put down.
B0099G6Q5E|5.0|Loved the movie and love the music from it! . . . . . . . . . . .
B0063IH60K|2.0|This game hand predictable and repetitive hands. Adult oriented ads. I was disappointed with the variety available in such a simple game.
B004I744AS|5.0|I use the Internet version of farlex, and this is almost exactly the same.  it searches words like a charm, the only complaint is that it took an update to get ot up to par, but that isn't really a big deal.  overall, unforgettable app.
B00005JPS8|5.0|awesome movie. had to get this for my brother in law for his birthday and he loves it and still watches it. it came in great condition and received it on time. ty.
B000067QMD|5.0|The do the job. Great thing to have for capping the bottles to store pumped breast milk or baby food when baby gets older.
B004LROUNG|4.0|Had a little of everything, drama humor, mystery.  First of his I read but my book club has read more.  we all liked it
B000YHE9J2|5.0|kid is hot, and a good aCTOR. story is realistic though a bit contrived toward end. stil..............a must buy. honest
0143034901|5.0|An amazing story!  It is so well written that I have ordered his other works for myself, and have recommended this book to my book club members, both male and female.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|It is easy and simple to use and looks great.  Wish it had more faces, but I enjoy it none the less!
6301390725|5.0|my fondest memories came from this movie with my family. seen this and i had to get it. how they made this movie was brilliant for its time. funny how you look on it now. lol i bought this used but it was in good condition for us to watch again. i have not seen this on dvd yet i will look for it. ty. :)
B00338QENI|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this and was amazed by the history of this family and the contribution she made to the futuring of science! However a couple chapters (too much medical jargon) almost lost my interest.
B000SGRONM|5.0|A collection of holiday stories that had me laughing so hard I cried. David Sedaris' dark and twisted sense of humor makes these stories a welcome remedy to holiday stress. In Santaland Diaries, he relates the misadventures of a grown man working as a holiday elf in a department store. The trials of two competitive families whose holiday \\"giving\\" gets out of control, a holiday letter that goes off the deep end, and a TV producer addressing a congregation of hillbillies, are just a few of the stories that had me laughing until my sides hurt. Wickedly funny!
0756407125|2.0|I was excited to get this book after TNOTW but as I was reading I slowly became convinced that the author is going to turn this trilogy into a 4 book (Eragon?) or even 12+ book series (can you say Jordan).  I just don't think Pat wants this cash cow to go away so he filled this book with drivel.  The events in this book could have easily been over with in 250 pages.  Nothing of substance relative to Kvothe's core quest really happens.  Kvothe learns little to nothing about the Chandrian.  Kvothe sure has a lot of sex though and I am sure Pat enjoyed writing those bits.
B00AFWEPVI|1.0|bought this app so i could ask this question. how do you use a camera app on a kindle fire hd when the only pictur you can fram is yourself or gyrations of something behind you. i'd love to know.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|What more can I say that's not been written already. Sexy love story. Read it, it won't make you stupid.
B00000JMQC|4.0|Return to Oz is a slightly worn vhs movie but i bought it anyways and it still plays great!! Received it via mail within a good amount of time. Just has wondrous and dark as I remembered when i was a child. A classic forgotten Disney favorite. Fairuza Alejandra Balk plays a cute Dorothy in my opinion in this movie. I would definitely buy this again.
B0019IB0II|4.0|Other than the chapters that were too medical for my liking, I was hooked. I had a close personal friend have a stroke this past July and I just wish I would have read this prior to that.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|Tim Ferris is the most interesting guy in the world, over Neil Strauss himself.  His ability to find cool and thrilling hacks and gear is unparalleled.  He is the world's greatest Guru for finding awesome &#34;insert expletive for scat&#34;.
B004T32SOK|4.0|I got this to play with my grandson he living hours away from us. We see how each of us are doing and he helps me advance. What a great way for us to do something together. Also can be used for learning. Tool.
B005NJU8PA|4.0|While the recipes, stories about wilderness cooking and special challenges towards the end of the book are all interesting, the first few chapters are particularly useful for putting the whole book in the context of an exploration of how we learn, and how we can help ourselves to learn.  Worth it just for that, but read some cooking sections too!
B0011UGLK6|5.0|Love all of Jhumpa Lahiris books. Beautifully written, universal understood but yet so Bengali. Jhumpa s books are always on my Christmas present list to anyone
B00AMBK6J2|5.0|An adult comedy with plenty of laughs. Mark Wahlberg keeps on impressing me with his acting skills. Not a kid movie.
B004G5ZY7E|4.0|Great read keeps u on edge all the way through.  Will read more Harry Hole novels. Can't wait for more!!!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I always go to this game first when I am bored and I'm on it for atleast five minuets I also like the idea of the giant coins.
140053271X|5.0|Haven't had it but a few weeks, but I am learning how to download from the library, etc.  love how light it is and that it will tuck away in a purse for easy reading anywhere.  No operating problems so far.  Would recommend it for home or away&#34;
0307455378|5.0|Si quieres un novela mas interesante y no es posible para despegar, comprar eso.<br />If you want a very interesting novel that is impossible to put down, buy this.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|The story line became predictable almost from the very start.  The author has not increased the depth of her main characters nor does she develop supporting sub plots.  In my opinion Book One enjoyed the success it did because of the topic but the author shows no particular talent for novel writing.  A Pulitzer contender it isn't ...
B00097E4A6|5.0|I've been trying to get this bridge at a cheaper price at ebay. But even then people are still paying like 40-50 bucks for it. So I finally gave in and bought it. My son loves it for his lego duplo trains I just hate the price.
B000L3CHC0|5.0|I bought these for a friend of mine and he is very satisfied with them, no complains so far, great deal!
B0063IH60K|2.0|Somewhat boring but it does help to pass the time.  Would not have purchased this product, but since it was free - not bad.
B005RYF5JA|5.0|I'm never disappointed with these wonderful Irish lasses.  I always Look forward to future concerts with great anticipation, as do millions of other fans.
B007V4530A|3.0|I am fascinated with TED. While it is not a specific goal to actually deliver a speech there, I certainly would not mind doing so. :) I've stumbled across this title several times in the last month or two. Today I wanted to read, but nothing to weighty. This fit the bill.<br /><br />The summary is that this is a 112-page (I read the Kindle version) script for Toastmasters!<br /><br />Early on I had good vibes as some of the things Donovan described are exactly like what we learn in Toastmasters. Then he began breaking out the references. Frankly, he copped some of Craig Valentine's material (of vice versa).<br /><br />One is not going to go from the couch to TED from having read this book. But those who do present at TED use the material presented here. I expected Donovan to recommend joining Toastmasters for practice; he didn't, but he did lead the needy to the organization.<br /><br />The Kindle version had some odd formatting, but nothing that impeded comprehension. &#34;Once&#34; was spelled &#34;One&#34;, and the lack of hyphens was bothersome.<br /><br />A solid easy read that has good information, although nothing new to a seasoned Toastmaster, I suspect.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game is a lot of fun. I take a lot of time on this game. like the farm game but better. injustice wish youdid not have to do the facebook thing with it.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|Kept me very interested.  The twists and turns are great.  I definitely recommend this book to @anyone who loved The Hunger Games.
B00A7CI82I|5.0|(Included Blu-ray, DVD and Digital Copy)  Interesting story, good actors, continual action which was shot from a far enough distance to get a real feel for what is happening.  I like the fact that in my Bourne Legacy Package a true Digital Copy was included!!  (I am not an Ultraviolet fan to say the least)
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is great! It makes you think. I probably recommend it to my students because they need to practice logical thinking and analysis for math class.
B00170DEM8|5.0|This has been one of my holiday favorites since I was a kid, and it never dissapoints!!<br />I highly recommend it.
1451695195|3.0|Expected to read more about the experience per se and not his many pages of rational of why it happened.
B000O8OTNC|3.0|This sharpener does a decent job and then folds up to fit in your pocket.  It won't give you a factory edge, but it's quick and will get you through until you can sit down and hone your blade.
B009T8XBBO|4.0|This game would be great for someone with smaller fingers or hands. But I make do. It is fun playing this game I enjoy it just my hands get in the way. Try it you will enjoy it.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|It really is a fun game but it won't let me get into it. Every time I try to open it it crashes. I hope they fix the problem. Overall, Draw Something is really fun. :)
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Well I think that this a an exceptional app. It can keep me entertained for hours. Flow takes logical thinking puzzles to the next level. (:
B007SGLZP8|2.0|This was the worst John Grisham book I've ever read.  It was messy.  The story was very fractured and all over the place.  Terrible for such good talent.
B00AMBH70S|2.0|Not as good as the others. Slow, drawn out, mundane, and overall boring. Man versus nature versus predator drone. Want a good Bourne movie get one of the others. This one was reaching.
0060987464|1.0|I'm not a fan of Manson's music or lifestyle, but to each his own and if that's how he expresses is \\"art\\", fine by me. It doesn't offend me - to each his own - but what did offend me was how bad this book was.  He's an interesting character, and I thought the book would provide some insight into the mind of an obviously creative individual. Liking or disliking his music is beside the point.<br /><br />The book was a huge disappointment. Brian Warner comes across as nothing more than a whiny, self involved drug addict who doesn't seem to be, in summary, a nice person at all. Kudos to him for getting attention with his wild make up and stage shows - not to mention making a ton of money in the process - but there doesn't seem to be much substance under all that.  Clearly the book didn't set out to make people like him, but nor does it portray any redeeming features to him, other than one comment that he apologized to his mom for treating her so badly. His attempt at explaining his definition of \\"satanism\\" was laughable at best: rambling and incoherent.<br /><br />All in all, this was boring. Read like any other \\"Hey look at me! I'm a cool, name dropping rock star who parties, uses women and put on shocking concerns to show how different I am\\" rock & roll memoir. Yeah, whatever. Read it 50 times before.
B0091QS88K|1.0|It was the samething over and over again. Nothing new for a long time. So I thought I would help them out and I got bored and deleted the game. I dont think it is even worth the free one.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|great game for all ages and teaches a form of responsibility for animal's .This game is a very fun and interactive game with out having the responsibility of a real pet.
B0015DROBO|5.0|I didn't think I would enjoy this book - I thought it was going to be wierd - but it was FABULOUS.  Such a great book and a great series!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|this is how I like adventure games: spooky and with a mix of puzzles and hidden objects. there's approx 45 Mn of free play and then it's $2.99 for the rest of the game. I just paid the $3 b/c so far so good.
1416575464|5.0|This gorgeous book is filled with great style page after page. Perfect coffee table book - after you flip through it and get ideas, of course.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I don't write reviews. EVER. Especially not about a book starring teens. This book moved me so much that I can't help myself. I have to share- this story is amazing. Buy this book. Colleen Hoover, thank you so much for writing this epic story!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I must say this is the best book I read this year. It had me from the begining to the end. With every twist and turn along the way. I couldn't put it down it tugged at every emotion I had. There were so mant things that happened I was just blown away.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|My daughter and I have been playing for weeks.  Every night this is our thing.  And we just discovered playing with random people which is so fun.  You just need to add some instructions on how to buy colors and how the bombs work. Plus my daughter has more options on her ipad then i do on my kindle... wierd.  Also we get the same words quite often so you need to add more words.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|The filming was done very well.  It was even a little scary.  I could not get over how it tied in the old Alien type monsters into this scenario.  I guess we are stuck with the Alien monster as the ultimate destroyer.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|I got this app for both of my kids' Kindles.  There is a large selection of alarm ring tones, so it was easy for both of them to pick out a song they really liked.  It was easy to set up the alarm.  It's pretty basic, but that is really all we needed.  Good Alarm clock app.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Very good book. It got kinda slow but definitely keep reading. The ending is so worth it. I can't wait for the third book.
B007I1Q4W2|5.0|I feel bad for any reviews that said this movie was slow or awful. Obviously they are washed down with today's fast paced, instant satisfaction media. This movie was one of the best I've seen in a long time and filled with deep symbolism with amazing story telling. Thank you John Geddes for directing a thoughtful and unique zombie tale!
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Loved this series!  SO great!  I didn't think I would but I really enjoyed all of them.  You definitely have to read the entire series!  Not just one book.
B003VDY7XE|5.0|Based on Steven King's imagination, Haven is one of those series that is so easy to get into. Supernatural events, great characters, small town. A search for a mother, whom everyone seems to know, but not really. Events that happened years ago, but are only evident in hazy memories. Only in King's style does Haven erupt when a FBI agent enters the realm of the present and past in the usual northeast of so many of King's stories. If you like his storytelling you will love Haven.
B009CGD0MI|5.0|Perfect blend of cheese and action.  Plus, it has Kevin Bacon in it.  You can't go wrong with Mr. Bacon.
B005ZUR724|2.0|also as far as in game the pathing is awful. up to level 39 and it is hard to find a complete area where the character can run in a straight line. have to strafe left and right to get around nothing.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|Never seeing the series, I have enjoyed being able to watch this series at my leisure.  Wonderful entertainment and well done!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|All I can say is that John Grisham very seldom disappoints. I couldn't put it down. Finished this book in about two days.
B000AYELVA|5.0|What can I say except I like comic books. And don't Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, James Marsden to name a few good actors along with Halle Bailey.
B009MO57H6|5.0|Why I love the Resident Evil Movies is because I injoyed the Video Games of it and I like Milla Jovovich's Movies I think she did Great in the Movie
B000FCK42M|5.0|Great book with many great characters.  Recommended for any one who enjoys a really interesting story line. Even better than Savages.
0439023521|5.0|After seeing the movie I had to get the book. It filled in a lot the movie didn't have. I got the whole series.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I say that this is the best book ever because since because I have read all of the books and this is the best by far. I especially love the part when the senior citizens came and said that they had rented the gym in the middle of their Valentine's Day Dance. And when Greg had put menus on the window to hide the people in the background was hilarious! That is all.
B001AK3S4Y|4.0|because I read the comics when I was younger. I would sneak into my brother's room and take it into my bedroom and read them.
B009A9BFBK|5.0|Linkin Park had 3,000 copies of LIVING THINGS pressed on 125 gram white vinyl, complete with inserts displaying both the album artwork and lyrics to every track. The vinyl release has an alternate cover art from the CD & digital versions of LIVING THINGS, too. This is definitely the best way to experience LP's latest release and sounds great! Track listing is as follows:<br /><br />SIDE A:<br />LOST IN THE ECHO / IN MY REMAINS / BURN IT DOWN / LIES GREED MISERY / I'LL BE GONE / CASTLE OF GLASS<br /><br />SIDE B:<br />VICTIMIZED / ROADS UNTRAVELED / SKIN TO BONE / UNTIL IT BREAKS / TINFOIL / POWERLESS
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|these games are just fun, I don't have to spend hrs. figuring it out. I am not very game proficient so this game gives me nice diversion.
0439023491|5.0|I had to get this book after reading the first one. It was hard to put down and couldn't wait to finish it and get the nexr one!! Anxious for the sequel movie.
B00338QENI|5.0|It's a great story that needed to be told. I am glad that Rebecca Skloot stuck it out and offered the family members hope,truth and support. A great read!
B000F6IOC0|4.0|I wanted to buy it from Wal-mart but it was over $15. I like the storyline for all the major characters.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I am new to this, but so far I am enjoying it. The games include a wide enough variety that I can find something to suit my mood. Directions are simple and clear.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|This movie is part of our Christmas traditions.  After we put the Christmas lights up outside, we come in and watch National Lampoons Christmas Vacation.  It helps us laugh at all the challenges we had when putting up our own lights.  Great stuffQ!
B000BJS4TO|1.0|Simply a poor stereotype flick with a COMPLETE TOTAL WASTE of talent, music and MONEY.<br /><br />Fails in all respects EXCEPT amazing photography & score.<br /><br />But even Yo Yo Ma, Gong Li & Co. can't pull this Box Office flop out of it's failed lack of cultural research, depictions of Asian women as high class hookers & bad, phoney accents NOBODY on earth speaks. A regress of the 1930's dragon ladies. Anna May Wong is ROLLING in her grave ! A revelation to American movie crowd- They DIDN'T fall for the DRAGON LADY crap this time ! YAHOO!<br /><br />I'm just SHOCKED such fine actors of Asia didn't RUN off the set once subjected to such a screenplay. Shame on them for being in such dated, racist rolls.<br /><br />Hollywood, take notice & learn from another film about Japan that did GREAT, The Last Samurai. The director was SENSITIVE & SMART enough to do the research & make a great film American's and Asian can enjoy !
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Interesting story. As a teacher you see all kinds of parents ignoring their child's behaviours instead of using them as teachable moments or getting them the help that they need. This story takes it to an unthinkable end.
B008ASLK8A|5.0|Top Rate entertainment. Action, adventure, mystery, complexity and whit all tied together perfectly, leaving you hungry for a new title. Downey Jr and Law bring their quirky talent to such an admirable level. Thoroughly enjoyed!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game is so fun! It gives you new items and dragons every level giving you a goal to strive for<br /> And also this game goes along with the seasons, making the islands snowy in the winter! You REALLY need to get this app. -thank you.
B001AIRUP4|5.0|My kids have the songs down.  We love Tim Burton's stuff!  It is a Halloween Christmasy movie that is good year round.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|All songs are amazing! Truly a CD you can play from start to finish. I can tell there are going to be tons of number ones from here!
B00785P2QC|5.0|Really fun way to kill time really neat city buildingn game! Even better than cityville on facebook. Two thumbs up!
B00A20PYP4|5.0|I love the depth Once Upon a Time gives to fairytale characters. Theres always a history behind everyones personality...as children we just accepted that the wicked Queen was wicked, Rumplstilskin was odd and Captain Hook was crazed. Once Upon a Time explores creative and entertaining outlets into the characters complex lives. I love how Snow White and Charming have to constantly work hard for their 'true love' and 'happily-ever-after' status... Cleverly done!
B00A757EFW|5.0|It works like it did when invented.<br />It is fun.<br />It is easy to play and the guide to move easy on the fingers.
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|There were parts that were funny, but sigh... another juvenile, not funny comedy although much of the content is definitely adult.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|puzzle game seems easy but it makes you lose even if you think it would win but is good otherwise
B0015AARJI|5.0|Made by playstation, this is what you'd expect. A great purchase for a secondary controller, and you know it will work with the system and hold up well.
B00APUYN0I|4.0|The movie was funny in a silly teen kind of way. I enjoyed watching the movie with my daughter but not one i would choose to watch with my adult girl friends.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|It is as easy as using the computer for facebook.<br />Would recommend to anyone who does not need Adobe Flash Player.
B006ZS4G24|5.0|I'm sure my granddaughter will love it.  She won't see it until the 25th but she really enjoys all of these Lego Friends kits.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|Wish it would show on the cover screen instead of having to click on it... but I like it. I like it
B004V5A7K8|1.0|I couldn't tell you bad nor good. It never worked for me. I got rid of it and never tried it again.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|I loved this story as a boy and still love it today!  I could read this book over and over and never grow tired of it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Still a game to play while waiting around.<br />It is easy and frustrating, good to help control emotions.<br />Would recommend to anyone who already likes the game.
0316232955|5.0|I finished the book in less than 48 hours and I absolutely adored it. I am slightly biased, seeing as I am sort of obsessed with Chris Colfer, but putting that aside, this was one of the best books I've ever read. It was so well put-together and detailed. I can't wait to read it over and over again.
B004LWZWGA|1.0|I am a huge fan of Batman and own all the movies.  I waited until this one came out on DVD to watch it home on my huge TV but it was terrible.  I honestly wanted to turn it off 1 hour into the movie but kept thinking that the good part was just around the corner.......it wasn't.  This is one of the worst movies I've had the displeasure of watching this year and I watch A LOT of movies.  The only good thing about it was the graphics.  The story itself was too long and drawn out to hold your attention.  If you're thinking about buying it and haven't seen it yet......don't bother.  There's better things to waste your money on.
B000ICXQS8|4.0|A true love story for the ages. Lee definitely took the words on paper and brought them to the big screen. Fans of the book will not be disappointed.
B0015DROBO|5.0|I read this book and could not put it down. It made me want to read the others by this author.
B008FSCNTK|2.0|very disappointed with the album after one listen,  hoped the next one is better, not exactly sure what this one is all about  and as much as i love jazz  this is way below my expectations
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This is an easy to understand and follow set of instructions for preparing a book to upload to Kindle Direct. I have followed the instructions and on the first upload was able to create an e-book that displayed well on all the formats the Kindle review tool offers. Excellent for anyone wanting to publish on Kindle.

B009O2XY12|4.0|After playing [[ASIN:B00A9JG6RS Bubble Birds 3]], I wanted to look for other similar games and I found Bubble Mania.  The two games are very similar in game play, but Bubble Birds 3 just feels better overall.  The kittens in Bubble Mania are really cute, but the gameplay is not as smooth as Bubble Birds.  I also find Bubble Birds 3 is a little more forgiving when you aim the birds, and I just found that made things a little more fun.  That said, if you like bubble popping games in general this one is worth a download.
B005LAII3U|5.0|Wow, what a difference the passage of time can make in the presentation of a story.  Up to date CGI makes this not just a movie 'Remake' but more a complete new 'story telling' adventure.  Stunning visuals and chase scenes that make Ronin seem sedate in comparison!  Outstanding work by the actors, fast pace action, marvelous sound and graphics which have to been seen to appreciate!  Nice job on this movie all around.

0307719774|5.0|I bought this for myself in mid November. I keep it next to my desk and in the morning when I have my coffee, I pick it up to see what the question for the day is; most days I answer it immediately but at times I reflect all day and there are times when it's late at night or even the next day before I write my answer down. It's the only journal I've managed to keep for more than a week-it's nearly Christmas, I haven't missed a day yet. I like it so much I'm giving one to all my friends, my son and his wife; and a similar one to a friend's son who is having a baby. Some of the questions are simple, some are deep. I really am enamoured of it. I wish my Dad was alive, to give one to him. He would have loved some of these questions, but I would loved to know his answers.<br /><br />A quick update...it's May 2013, I haven't missed a day, I've added the weather, although down south it doesn't change that much. I'm also buying one for my Mom, who has moved into an Assisted Living Facility, so I can write her responses down, while she's still able to tell me.
B009NTN948|5.0|This 2-disc collection (fyi, the U.K. version contains 2 additional DVDs) showcases Amy Winehouse at a time when her voice was still projecting the brilliance she contained. The DVD concert / docu is filmed in Ireland in late 2006, and the 6 songs performed are stunning and emotive. She delivers with conviction, yet with subtle, winding, spontaneous jazzy nuance that just makes you shake your head (particularly in \\"Me and Mr. Jones\\"). The docu gives good insight into her musical influences with actual archival footage of many of them. She's witty, sweet, intense, and charismatic. A joy to watch all around.<br /><br />The CD mix has likewise captured Winehouse at some of her better moments. She's brilliant, and a true artist. If you listen to enough versions of her songs or the countless amateur footage available on youtube, you'll notice she literally never sings a song the same way twice. There is nothing manufactured or pretentious about this girl. She gives you rawness and authenticity every time. Sometimes that means stumbling around half-heartily, and other times she is the most exquisite singer of our time, but every performance is a unique one (reminds me a lot of Nina Simone that way). On this disc, they have compiled some of her better live performances from 2004-2007, including 2 jazz standards (\\"Lullaby of Birdland\\" and \\"I should Care\\") which leave no doubt about her credentials as a true jazz vocalist, and makes one wish she'd done a CD of only standards. Other highlights for me were \\"Rehab\\", \\"Love is a Losing Game\\", \\"Just Friends\\" (big band special), \\"You Know I'm No Good\\", \\"Valerie\\", and \\"To Know Him Is To Love Him\\". Not a huge fan of the Frank songs they included here, but they're no doubt good versions as well.<br /><br />Bottom line: NO REGRETS!

B00A4W3AJC|4.0|Enter at your own risk. This movie is quite capable of confusing you and making you angry.  It could delight or overwhelm you, win you over or enrage you. It could make you feel like cursing and truly hate all art-house in general,  French art-house in particular, and Leon Carax, and his collaborators, specifically.<br /><br />For me, \\"Holy Motors\\" is very interesting, unpredictable, shocking and ever-changing.  It is my kind of movie in which the writer/director expresses  his  admiration for  cinema as an art form. I've always felt a deep respect for the filmmakers who use in their original and unpredictable pictures  the references, allusions, and direct calls to the other movies and to film creators  who inspired them.  \\"Holy Motors\\" is one of those pictures - about film and film-making.<br /><br />Our life - is a (movie) theater, and we are actors in the movie that plays in the theater. For me, it is the first thing to keep in mind when you try to make sense of what is actually going on and what \\"Holy Motors\\" is about. I see it as a dedication to all movies and the genres. Here they are, the Umbrellas of Cherbourg and deadly struggle of the character and his doppelganger in the gangster movie. There are also the references to beauty and the beast, not Disney's version nor Jean Cocteau's, but shockingly funny monster of Walerian Borowczyk's La Bete (1975) aka The Beast. Still gorgeous Edith Scob (Celine, limo driver and Monsieur Oscar's business partner), puts on a mask in the latest episode of the film - direct reference to the classic horror, Georges Franju's film \\"Eyes Without a Face\\" (1959), where she played her most famous role in the film, which defined the whole genre. And, perhaps, \\"Holy Motors\\" is an update version of Celine and Julie that looks at the story or many stories from different angles and plays with them. Could it be Scorsese's \\"Taxi Driver\\" in Paris, with limousine - sort of Charon's boat plying between the worlds of the living and the dead, reality and illusion, film and audience, between the actors and their characters? Or maybe this is Un Chien Andalou / Andalusian Dog for our time with the script by Charlie Kaufman - open doors to the irrational; do not try to explain the unexplainable. Maybe Carax could say just like Luis Bu&ntilde;uel, \\"You need an explanation? I do not have any.\\" Just look closely at images and metamorphosis and try not to search for the meaning in them. They may not have a special meaning at all but would it make the movie any worse? Would the movie affect you any less if you can't grab its meaning? Perhaps the meaning in the words by Monsieur Oscar as father to his teenage daughter in his most realistic role: \\"You are punished by being just yourself all your life.\\" Isn't it sad never let the world of imagination, illusion and fantasy pull you beyond reality, where you are just you? ... But can one only exist in a world of illusion and change masks one by one and forget what the real face is?<br /><br />Denis Lavant, director-screenwriter Leos Carax's alter ego, works wonders here, changing into nine personalities during the course of movie. His face is fascinating - the face of  Socrates, and satyr,  murderer, and  wise tired clown.  Of modern actors, John Malkovich and Malcolm McDowell have such impressive faces... And so, Lavant's hero or, rather, heroes  travel all day long with Celine, the driver, passing striking views of Paris, impersonating different personalities, who are on the  weird, shocking, crazy, unbelievable missions, ordered by someone unknown, captured on the camera by someone unseen but always present.<br /><br />I read somewhere that  idea of Motors came from  Carax interest and curiosity in  very long limousines, obsolescent powerful toys, whether messengers of the past in the future, or, on the contrary, from  future in the past, sort of motorized brontosaurs. What's inside, who is inside? The size is such that it is possible to live ... or to prepare forthe transition from one life to another, and then,  third, and more.  And to appear in every life in a completely different roles - a  killer,  a victim, a beggar, a  millionaire, a  monster named Monsieur S***,  a caring father to a shy, awkward teenage girl ,  then the futuristic creature having sex  with the elastic beauty covered in red plastic...And then he returns home...Or does he?<br /><br />And maybe Holy Motors is not just about us looking  at  stretched limousines, but about them looking at us and gossiping  about us and their future in hushed silence and darkness of the company \\"Holy Motors\\"'  night garage.<br /><br />But what Holy Motors is for sure - the message that was sent beyond our world - \\"Katya, this is for you\\" - the last frame of the movie with a picture and dedication to Leos Carax's  muse and beloved, Ekaterina Golubeva (1966-2011).ransition from one life to another, and then,  third, and more.

0425252868|5.0|A Higher Call is mostly the story of Franz Stigler, an ace WWII German fighter pilot who came upon a heavily damaged and helpless American B-17 bomber struggling to return to England.  Stigler could have easily shot down the bomber and it's crew, but instead he escorted them past an anti-aircraft battery and flew along side them for a while out over the North Sea.  Stigler knew he would be court-martialed if anyone found out what he had done.  For years he wondered if the bomber had made it home safely and he wondered, &quot;Was it worth it?&quot;.  It took 46 years for Stigler to find out that the bomber did return home safely and to finally meet the American bomber pilot, Charlie Brown.<br /><br />Author Adam Makos provides all the descriptions of battle, dog-fighting and heroism you would expect in a book of this nature but he really focuses on the human side, on the losses.  Character after character are introduced only to die.  The story of one young German flier is heartbreaking.  In the last days of the war he told Stigler that he was going to return home, surrender and that he hoped to study engineering.  Stigler asked if he wanted to take just one flight in an Me-262, the world's first operational jet fighter.  The boy said yes.  Since American bombing had stopped two days before, Stigler thought it would be a safe, quick flight, but the jet's engines cut out and the plane went down.  Stigler raced to the crash sight and was able to arrive in time for the boy to ask Stigler to say goodbye to his mother and sister for him.  The boy died in Stigler's arms.  So many wasted lives.<br /><br />While the description of Stigler escorting the bomber to safety is moving, the scene that meant the most to me was at a veterans reunion where Charlie Brown introduced Stigler to two of the crewmen who had been onboard the bomber that Stigler spared.  As the four men hugged and cried they were joined by the descendants of the American fliers -- people who owed their lives to the act of generosity and kindness shown by Franz Stigler.  Stigler and Brown remained close friends until their deaths, both in 2008.<br /><br />It took 46 years for Stigler to get an answer to the question that had haunted him for so long.  Yes, it was worth it.o the act of generosity and kindness shown by Franz Stigler.

0857680986|5.0|Most books on figure drawing go something like this: Step 1-sketch the figure; Step 2-fill in all the details.  That's a HUGE step from the sketch to the detailed drawing!!!  Many so-called figure drawing instructional books are simply portfolios of the author's artwork with very little instruction. Tsk.<br /><br />Loomis is different.  He goes through all the intermediate steps you need to draw a figure.  You learn to draw \\"manikins\\" from your imagination, with body parts in the proper proportions, and in all kinds of poses.  He also teaches you how to draw the figure in perspective.  Once you master that, he covers all the anatomy you need to know in order to create realistic figures.  Finally with all that mastered, he covers clothing & shading the figure (value) along with how to draw some of the more complex body parts like heads, hands, and feet.<br /><br />As a professor I can state confidently that the step-by-step teaching approach in this book is the best that you can find, outside of maybe taking a class.  But even most figure drawing classes don't cover the material in this book!<br /><br />To summarize you learn the fundamentals of drawing figures: proportion, anatomy, perspective, values, color, and knowledge of mediums and materials.  The only drawback for today's students (who I find mainly want to draw Manga and Anime-style characters) is that the drawing style is dated.  But if you master the fundamentals in this book you can easily adapt them to other genres.<br /><br />- Professor F., past-Director of UNM's Interdisciplinary Film & Digital Media Program
0385737955|2.0|To be honest, I was rather disappointed. I thought I would be really into this and I wasn't. There has not been that much material done on mazes other than 'Labyrinth,' which I'm a big fan of, and the Greek myth about the minotaur. So, I find the subject of a maze alluring and from what I skimmed over the book I thought I would enjoy it. The author is good at setting up mystery to keep some interest in continuing reading...but that's about it. He really didn't offer much else in his writing and I am genuinely surprised this is a New York Times Bestseller. I couldn't see any merit in the story or writing that would put it there. In fact, I find it a bit baffling. To me it read more like an unedited manuscript. I'm really not sure how this got past the editor and on to the shelf. First of all, there is absolutely zero character development. Zero. None of the characters have much in the way of description or personalities so you never get that much of a sense of who they are, and they don't grow as people. Nor is there ever any hint from the beginning that they will grow or change or need to. The entire story is about the mystery of the maze...which you don't even see a glimpse of until 100 pages...and once you get there they still don't show you that much and it's not all that exciting. This to me was like a very long episode of 'Lost' without any payoff and without any character history, character development, or character evolution. By page 200 the book just became pointless to me. I didn't care enough about what was going on to continue and I was pretty sure from other reviews that I read, that not that much would even be answered by the end, just to drag you into the next book.<br /><br />Basically, the whole book is just following the main character around while he does mundane things and desperately wishes to run in the mazes, but he does not know why since all the boys memories have been erased. It is slightly reminiscent of 'Lord of the Flies,' except, LOTF was a great book and this is not. LOTF was rich with character development, because what else are you going to do on a deserted island? Kind of like 'Castaway.' You have no choice but to focus on the character because not that much can actually happen in a deserted place, and most of this book does not take place in the maze but in the glade which is some field the boys live in.t book and this is not.

B009POCFTG|5.0|\\"Killer Joe\\" is a sick, violent film.  Depraved.  Disgusting and offensive in almost every possible way.  And, a masterpiece.<br />  William Friedkin... wow!<br />  Decades ago -- thanks to \\"The Exorcist\\" -- one could see that Mr. Friedkin possessed, let's say, some unusual sensibilities.  More often than not, however, he kept them under wraps.  And gave us some great, more mainstream, films like \\"The French Connection,\\" \\"To Live And Die In LA,\\" and the underrated \\"The Sorcerer.\\"<br />  But, back to those \\"sensibilities...\\"<br />  A few years ago, Mr. Friedkin gave us \\"Bug.\\"  Which, I'll admit, I'm in no hurry to ever see again.  Yet -- to sort of borrow from the film -- \\"Bug\\" did mange to get under my skin.  And seems to have set the table for \\"Killer Joe.\\"  Meaning that with \\"Bug,\\" Mr. Freidkin may have been getting warmed up to deliver us the gem that is \\"Killer Joe.\\"<br />  I'll leave it to others to describe \\"Joe's\\" plot.  And point.<br />  But while watching \\"Joe,\\" I felt a bit like Alex in \\"Clockwork Orange.\\"  In that my eyelids were propped open and I was unable to avert my gaze from what was on the screen.  Even though I wanted to.  Watching (Spoiler Alert!) someone get their face bashed in with a 28 oz. tomato can (for what seemed like minutes)... hard to think of that as great cinema, but, somehow -- in ways I don't begin to understand --it was.<br />  Anyway, \\"Killer Joe\\" is Mr. Friedkin at his best...  him sticking a mixmaster into one's head and turning the switch to the \\"high\\" setting.<br />  And one of the most thought-provoking films ever made.  And, by any intelligent measure, a must-see.

I give it 4 out of 5 stars, if you didn't run out of energy I would give it 5 out of 5.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|This could be classified as an adult or a children's story....A child follows his need to discover reality as told to him by his Grandfather, but opposed by his father...What a cast of characters he meets!!  Time travel at its best...
B000HC2LI0|4.0|Lack of subtitles for a lot of the series otherwise it would have been a 5 stars as it is one fo the best on TV
B001CWOCUO|2.0|Its not DTS Master audio.<br />I am really disappointed because its sounds and looks like a reg dvd, not a blu-ray.<br />Dont wast your money on blu-ray.
0307730697|5.0|THE BEST BOOK EVER PUBLISHED!! HANDS DOWN THE BEST. . . . . . . . . . . .
034580404X|5.0|Been enjoying reading this series. I already have a list of friends waiting for their turn to read them. Fast service as well.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I really like all the Michael Connelly books, especially the Harry Bosch Series. Well written, read it in one day cause I didn't want to stop
B00APUQJLO|5.0|Not for everyone, but, absorbing and engaging if you are open to it.  Divisive, but, sometimes the mirror is hard to look into.  Cronenberg doesn't hold your hand. A true human comedy, dark and honest.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love this app because it lets you now what percentage your battery is on and it charges while you can still use the device
B00785P2QC|3.0|I'm a big fan of the original Virtual City PC game.  This would be great if you didn't have to &quot;buy&quot; the upgrades.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|These books are a great read. I had trouble putting them down  I recommend them to all  the lessons taught and learned
B0014J8D9Q|4.0|I love this movie, and would absolutely pay to see more like it. Clint Eastwood is one of the best western actors to ever live. Morgan Freemans role in this movie cannot be overlooked. He was the catalyst that helped you get excited at the end.<br /><br />I would absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who has not seen it.
B004QMW1NM|5.0|Found this band because of the single Young Blood, but The Naked and Famous have much more to offer in the rest of the album. The vocals are haunting, harmonized, and gorgeous. The songs are tapestries of lush electronics. An engrossing experience. Highly recommended.
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|Pretty good with lots of action. Ending could have been different but I guess it was like this for the sequel. I believe Jason will make an appearance in the next movie.
B003WUYRGI|2.0|I thought this book was very educational. Thank you so much for this learning experience. This will help me advance my life.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Even though the story was predictable, I enjoyed it.  This is a love story that is easy to read and enjoy . I have read many Sparks books.  If you want a book to read that is good before going to sleep, you should read this one,
B00866JL96|3.0|This movies deals with unpleasantness. Efrons personality in this movie is not my fav but he is good at potraying a diff personality than I have seen him. Would not recommend for kids.
B0011UF792|5.0|Got here super fast! It was a Christmas gift for our son! Thank you for such great service! I'll be using you again he gave me a really long list of movies he wants. Lol
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I think it was a good learning book because ,people who don't know certain words to spell.People can spell much better with the dictionary.
B00571F26Y|4.0|This was given as a gift and the person likes it very much and has lost 5lbs after 3 days of following the plan!
B002ZG975Q|4.0|I like predictable movies. By the way they are usually predictable before you go see.Dont like the modern movies that make little sense and end badly. This movie was a little slow but so are a lot of well liked movies.Could have been better but seen worse.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app is awesome. my brother and I have the game for our x-bix and it is great. you should defenently buy it.
B00330UFQS|5.0|Lady Antebellum is one of my favorite country bands.  They are good for people who don't like the twangy country music.
B00061QJZI|5.0|My daughters bf had lost this movie and it was his favorite. I found it on AMZ and gave it to him. He was thrilled that he<br />had a copy of it again!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a great app. Its a must download. I have not had any problems. This is a great calculator.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|i love this game it should have a zombie dragon I love kairos to all in all great game. it has so many dragons In it.
B0053O89WY|5.0|This is one of the funniest shows ever!  I absolutely love the show and the characters!  Such a good one to watch over and over again.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is a good, active mystery.  It is a different take on an old story.  Not boring at all.  Did he?  Didn't he?  Did she?  Did someone else?  Moves quickly along and has  quirky characters. A nice change of pace as it is a well-written story that reads like no other.
B008NW67E0|5.0|Love this gourp of talented musicians... both CDs are great.  Unique sound and great lyrics.  Will look forward to their next CD too.
B0076DELIG|4.0|The Black Box is a very good book, as are all the Harry Bosch books. It was extremely suspenseful and kept my interest throughout, and showed what a flawed but dedicated detective Bosch is. I highly recommend it.
0316228532|1.0|So I made it to about the half way point in this poor excuse for a book before I decided that I had had enough. There were far too many characters to keep track of in a short period of time that it made it impossible to connect with any of the characters, even a little. And maybe because I don't hang out with people who swear that often, I found the swearing, especially the repeated use of the f-bomb, to be offensive.<br /><br />I also didn't feel like there was much of a storyline to keep me interested. I also didn't much care for the writing style. It felt like Rowling was trying too hard to connect with an adult audience with her vocabulary and language.
B009P0VLGI|5.0|I liked the covert artwork of this album and the epic poster.<br />The Booklet is well-made and the photos are incredible as good as the CD's design.<br />I loved &#34;A Simple Motion&#34;.
B002ZG99IG|1.0|This is single white female without the punch. Where do i begin. Its just plain bad. Single white female is 100 percent better and I rather watch that instead. Don't buy this. Save your money and watch Bridgette Fonda and Jennifer Jason Leigh instead.
B008F9E306|5.0|GRAND HUSTLE GENERAL, THE KING T.I. still remains the king on this joint. Being the King of Mableton, off Bankhead, ATL, I can say this. His talent has remained razor sharp, with an excellent engeneering team. Most of this record was recorded all over Atlanta, Georgia, where some of the world's finest studios and engineers work. The record starts off strong, goes hard in the middle, and STAYS HARD through the end. The beats are top knotch, and the record contains some of the best trap beats I heard yet to date in the dirty south. The sampling on this record is dope. A joint with Pink called \\"Guns and Roses\\" is going to be one of the best of the year. I love the mastering mix on this album as the clarity is phenomonal. BANKHEAD HIGH 5 ALL DAY!
B007IXWKUK|1.0|If you want sexy, go read some decent erotica.  Calling this series erotica is an insult to the genre but at least it would be honest.  Calling it a &#34;good&#34; book though is ridiculous sham, perpetrated I'm assuming by those who don't want to admit that what they like about it is the titillation factor.
B007A4SDCG|5.0|I've reread this book several times, and each time I get something new from it. Pressfield makes so many excellent points about creativity and resistance. To me, this is a priceless book that belongs on every creative's desk as reference.
B006YC74E8|5.0|I am a professional graphic designer who uses all the top programs in the trade. While Photo Editor is no Photoshop, I was amazed to find a free app that works so well on my Kindle Fire HD. This is an easy to use app that is surprisingly powerful! If you want to be able to take photos with your Kindle and manipulate before Facebooking them, this is the app for you!
B0067LY4WG|5.0|This is a great cd. Love his music and lyrics. He is in touch with the holy as well as the brokenness of humanity.
B006O6F932|5.0|thanks so much. my daughter has wanted this for Christmas and i couldn't find it anywhere. thanks for making this a merry Christmas!!!
B00632HWOG|2.0|The older version worked much better.  Hard to delete e-mail, hard to download e-mail.  I have to go only to Yahoo and delete e-mail.  Hard to understand how to respond to an e-mail.  Not user friendly at all.  I am using it because there is nothing else to use on my Kindle Fire.
B00AA7O6QC|4.0|It was a pretty good movie. Lots of action and a bit of corny humor injected. I enjoyed it and would recommend it.
B001D0DQUC|5.0|This  is a great movie! Classic and quotable! Save Ferris! Even though I am not in hi school anymore, it still is a great relatable movie.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I purchased the book 1 for my wife who has watched the series and now has gone back and is reading the book.  She is thrilled and I purchased this through Audible.com.  You can't go wrong with this purchase.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Ready Player One is a fantastic book that sustained my interest on many levels.  At its core it's a suspense-filled adventure story involving players in a vast online virtual world called the OASIS.  The original designer and architect of the OASIS dies, and ownership and control of OASIS will go to whomever finds an easter egg he has hidden somewhere in the virtual world.  The setup and plot are very engaging, and the dialogue is especially good (the trash-talking between Parzival and his friends is perfect).  Page after page went by and I couldn't put it down; I wanted the characters to win and the author maintains an exciting tempo throughout.<br /><br />The story also weaves in many elements from the culture of the late 1970s/1980s, in a way that is natural to the story.  I lived through that era (I'm the same age as the author), and as nostalgia the writing is pitch-perfect accurate.  Readers who didn't live through the era may find it interesting as well, as during this period many aspects of \\"geek culture\\" first emerged and flourished:  Personal computers, videogames, D&D, anime, and so on.<br /><br />Underlying the story is a big question:  Is it a good thing to be able to retreat from reality?  Parzival leads a dreary existence in the real world, and the OASIS allows him to escape into a world much richer.  However there is a feeling that these engrossing pastimes -- whether it's Family Ties reruns, playing Black Tiger for hours, or hanging out in the OASIS -- can become a crutch that keeps one from tackling the real problems of life.  The book addresses this question with some nuance, and we can see how even in the lives of single individuals, these technologies can be both positive and negative.<br /><br />Ready Player One is the most engrossing book I've read in a long time.  I hope we see more from this author!
B008M87GJK|5.0|simple, easy to use. a great asset. liked the list style. loads quickly and is easy to read. definitely recommend.
B008602KQI|5.0|The Hunger games made me think of what is happening today in our nation as our so called Government demands more from The People such as give-backs and high taxes while they- the rich- take and Lord it over us.  The movie made me think that this could be our future if we don't stand up and demand back our Republic-Government of the people, by the people, for the people.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it's an okay time killer, but the games are kinda lame and you have to earn points by playing the games in order to unlock more games.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|Love this band and great cd. Nice variety of music/lyrics while sticking solid to their style. Can't wait for the next cd!
B007STXHTM|5.0|Works good and look. Good. Makes using the gopro easyer price was good got it fast easy to open best
B008LD09LS|1.0|I have edited my review on this app for the 3rd time now. Initially, I could not get it to pair with my Drone 2.0. After a little research, I came to find that after the Drones have been paired with one device (my Iphone in my case) all you need to do is hit the reset button located where the battery rests and you can then pair it with other devices. After doing that, I paired my Drone with my Kindle Fire and the app appeared to work fine.<br /><br />However, now that I have used the app to pilot my drone 75% of the time the video is not in my library. No, I do not have it set to record on USB. Sometimes when it records it records the videos in some TMPVID format, which are unplayable. I would love to say that this is due to user error, but it's not. I have an Iphone that I have not had one problem with while flying the drone. I prefer to use the Kindle Fire because of the larger screen and also in the event someone calls, etc. that the flying will not be interrupted.<br /><br />If anyone can provide some good solid advice on how to make this thing work properly I will definitely change my review from a one star. For now, it's zero stars. Still wish so badly I would've forked out the extra money for an Ipad....<br /><br />****UPDATE AS OF August 24, 2013****<br />Well, I finally decided that I have had enough with my Kindle and all the issues surrounding it and the worthless apps available for it. I broke down and bought an iPad 4th generation. I love it! I made the Kindle mistake. Face it; the apps made for the iPhones and iPads are much better and there are many more of them. So long Kindle! It'll be on Craigslist soon. Lesson Learned.
B000YHG72E|5.0|Always a great movie! My grandchildren loved watching it and it is much better on Blu RAy than regular DVD
B00571F26Y|5.0|I read this book with great interest, because I hate counting calories and was feeling unhealthy and needed to lose about 30 pounds. This book came my way at just the right moment.  It is a clearly written, persuasive argument for eliminating wheat from your diet--even if you do not suspect a wheat sensitivity.  Anecdotal note: As recommended by Dr. Davis in his book, I began a 30-day trial of this way of eating, and noticed the following benefits within one week:  skin/scalp stopped itching; I felt really good; best of all, I no longer feel like I am &#34;starving&#34; half the time, and am in control of my choices.  (Oh, and I lost several inches at my waist and lost 6 pounds, and still one week of my 30-day experiment to go!) Pretty amazing, really!
B00A8Z6KN8|5.0|This sound track included the songs from the movie as well as the ambient music, and adds up to a very lengthy and hugely enjoyable track.
B000T433CO|5.0|This movie is like comfort food. The performances are warm and heartfelt, and I really enjoy the interplay between the characters.
B009ZE27US|1.0|this was the worst game I have ever downloaded it kept changing ages!!!!!!!!! this game was the worst game ever I deleted it as soon as I got it Don't get this game PLEASE&iexcl;!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0096BIENY|5.0|Bought as a gift for a big fan of this group and it was a request on her &#34;Santa&#34; list so I know she will be thrilled to receive it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is a book with heavy duty elements mixed with well developed characters in a plot twisting tale. Timely, eye opening and a compelling read. This is one of my newest favorite authors. Well written with virtually no grammar or punctuation speedbumps. Read this book!
1926778537|5.0|[[VIDEOID:moXZ2RUJBOEG16]]Joe Madureira the Creative Studio Director and team has done it again by presenting us with an amazing collection of video game art.<br /><br />Amazon listed the second volume wrongly at 200 pages. It's 224 pages thick, which is thinner than the first artbook [[ASIN:1926778103 The Art of Darksiders]]. Anyway, The Art of Darksiders 2 art book is still very thick!<br /><br />An astonishing amount of concept art fills the pages. There are character designs, environment concepts, weapons, enemies and 3D renders. And all come with painted version and the sketches. That's a lot to see.<br /><br />There's an incredible amount of variety and detail for all the artwork featured. Towards the end, there's commentary on the style guide and a brief explanation on how they paint over 3D models.<br /><br />The 3D renders are gorgeous but printed a bit small at less than a quarter size for each character. They are considered small only because there's so much detail that you want a larger picture to look at them.<br /><br />The binding has improved. But with a book this thick, I would still be careful. At least, I no longer have the fear of its pages falling out. It's definitely a huge improvement over the the atrocious binding of the first artbook. By they way, the May 2011 second printing of the first artbook has improved the binding also.<br /><br />This is an awesome artbook with a remarkable amount of great art.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />(There are more pictures of the book on my blog. Just visit my Amazon profile for the link.)
B008IYR2BA|5.0|Lots of twists and turns...the viewer is worried about Dexter as he is becoming less careful in his choices.  Looking deeper into Deb's character is also fascinating.
B00866JL96|5.0|Hopefully, my daughter in law will share this gift with me !!!  We are HUGE chick-flick movie lovers !!!!<br /> She was the one that told me about this movie and that I would love it and she was soooo right !!!
B000YHG72E|5.0|This movie is absolutely hilarious! Kids, boys and girls; and adults, men and women will enjoy this funny and sweet movie. I've never heard anyone say anything other than that they just LOVE the movie. . . .it's a WINNER!!
B004J4WNL2|5.0|Susan Cain wrote a fantastic and well researched book. The book is a great for everyone, introverts and extroverts. There are examples throughout the book that are useful for everyone. I'm glad I stumbled across this author and the book because it is full of useful tips, resources and suggestion for further reading. Many of my friends and family will be getting a copy.
B0071BGOJC|1.0|After reading &#34;Winter of the World&#34;, I re-read Herman Wouk's &#34;War and Remembrance&#34;. There's nothing to compare. Wouk is a much better storyteller, knows how to portray characters as real people with real emotions, and not as paper cutouts.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I was worried about not getting this in time for Santa, but it came on time and very we'll packaged. Will review again once it's opened and everything looks like it should.
075669812X|5.0|I purchased this for my sons friend who LOVES NInjago and he was ecstatic! It totally made my day to give it to him. GREAT item for any NIjago fan
B00992CF6W|1.0|FROZE WHILE PLAYING. Then i shut off my device and turned it back on. When i returned to Minecraft all my data was gone
B008EQIEWS|3.0|Not bad as these go. Production values very good. Acting average. Perseus as a reluctant hero is a little odd.
B0069G5Z9K|3.0|I have this game on my ipod, and I was very excited when it came out for kindle fire. its so much better playing it on a bigger screen, and the game is very addicting as usual. However, on here it lags like none other and currently it is in some fastforward mode, where I go insanely fast right out of the gate. Clean up these bugs, and it's a 5-star app.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Non-stop funny throughout the movie. A little predictable with the love interest but it does not make the movie bad at all. A new favorite!
B001NHNG64|5.0|Lee Child , great story teller this is the second book of his that i have  and on a Kindle Fire it can't get any better than that.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|The packaging and amount of content is terrific. You get everything that you could want in a film series anthology. Really glad I picked this up. It was also very affordable.
B0099116AY|5.0|bought after seeing it in theater....haven't had a chance to watch it but hopefully soon.  not for children or young couples....thk older couples will appreciate the humor
B00002MZ4V|5.0|If  you have ever attended movies with John Williams musical scores, this is a must have cd collection.  Williams' music is unparalled by any composer of the times.  I have thoroughly enjoyed listening to these pieces.  You are immediately transported back in time.  I highly recommend the purchase of this set.  You won't be dissappointed.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I have played this game on my I-phone  really enjoyed it then, now i can play it on my Kindle Fire  HD (bigger screen )  It keeps you thinking. you can stop and start again when you want to or have the time. Great game
B005NJU8PA|5.0|As with all ferris' books, this is well researched and totally entertaining sentence after sentence. This is totally not a your conventional foodie book.
B0013F1D02|5.0|This is such a fun movie, great for both kids and adults. Its soundtrack is exceptional and gives a sense of an epic story.
B00005T7I1|5.0|Fantastic color!<br />A girl HAS to love Warren Beatty's Tracy!<br />A guy wants to be Beatty's Tracy!<br />Some poor music offset by great music!<br />A visual treasure!
B0063GORYU|4.0|This game is a bit more difficult than regular solitaire but is still relaxing and fun.  My days are stressful and this game allows me to use my mind without getting more stressed out.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I downloaded this to kill time when WiFi isn't available.  Realizing that nothing is free, I expected ads.  If you can keep that in mind, the ads aren't that bad.  It's a good little game.
B001EC2IXK|5.0|great classic movie , real acting ,by talented actors&#34; the real deal&#34;<br />paul newman at his best . and george kennedy  awesome performance
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love this show! I'll have to admit the first season is the best but the 2nd and 3rd season are right behind it. I always recommend this to people. Trust me you'll get hooked!
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|ok I'm addicted.  I love this game.  I love the graphics, the animation and I haven't had any problems with the game so far.
B000JBWWRY|5.0|I received this days before I expected it to arrive.  This was great.  My son will be so excited on Christmas.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|This book is great for a guy. Why? because most guys wouldn't touch a cookbook with a 10 foot pole, and this book is filled with a ton of interesting stuff, and breaks down cooking and other life skills in a straight forward no bulls*** way.
B004EWFUQY|5.0|This book was recommended to my by my chiropractor.  It's been a while since I have read it, but I plan to do so after the holidays to get back on track.  When I am following this eating plan, I have so much energy and yet sleep soundly.  It's not a fad diet, but a way of life.
B009ZE27US|1.0|this game just randomly picks numbers. it doesn't even scan your finger print it has the same finger print for everybody. this app is a waste of space and time so delete it don't even bother downloading it.  I am 13 and it said I was 56 this app sucks. wish I could give this a 0 it sucks so bad.
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|It was hilarious.  I will definitely purchase this movie for my dvd collection.  I will watch this again and again.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Great read, many twists and turns. You will find yourself being surprised at each and every turn! I could barely put it down!
B00A80SHFM|4.0|Okay.. here's the deal folks. Go see the movie and the soundtrack makes sense.<br />When I first heard the soundtrack I thought it was sacrilegious.I was so mad at the butchery and low quality of talent and production. BUT, I sobbed through the movie.  It all seemed to work.<br />\\"Who am I\\", is one of my favorite songs and I was WORRIED, BUT, he pulled it off and it was moving.<br /><br />Crow is a dud! Lost in the music, lost is the character. NEVER GOT IT!<br /><br />Here is the real shocker. I LOVED Anne Hathaway. There... I said it!<br />I still wish she didn't break at the line \\"He took my childhood in his stride\\" BUT... she is stunning in the film and will win the Oscar.<br /><br />Colm Wilkinson (Bishop), 1985 original Jean ValJean, was brilliant! A show stealer and all you wanted was to continue listening to him continue. Warm, sophisticated, Velvet.... Perfect!<br /><br />Aaron Tveit (Enjolras) is also a stand-out. The quality is so defining and at times it is difficult to listen to Eddie Redmayne (Marius).<br /><br />Samantha Barks is a star... lovely voice... stunning performance!<br /><br />STILL THE WORST AND ALMOST RUINED THE SHOW... Cohen and Carter. AWFUL! I was so surprised how they could over act and under act all at the same time.  I love these characters and always wait for their appearance. In the movie I just wanted them to go away.  There was NOTHING redeeming about their performance.<br /><br />See the movie and wait for the Full Length OR Enjoy the Movie and Get the 1985 Recording or the Original London Cast.<br /><br /> Hats off for the effort!<br /><br />PRE-MOVIE REVIEW ____________________________________________________________________<br />You will want to buy this... Don't waste your money.<br /><br />I wanted this to to extraordinary... I have waited for months for this to be released. This just goes to show that world class actors do not necessarily make world class singers.<br /><br />The doe eyed beauty, Anne Hathaway would look like a great Fantine but all 10 people listening with me laughed out loud when she sang the line,\\"He took my childhood in his stride\\" in \\"I dreamed a Dream\\".  All shaking their heads in complete disbelief. Maybe seeing her sign this will not make this such a joke.<br /><br />Russel Crow sounds like he has a head cold. Javert is powerful, passionate and righteous... Crow is tired, boring and passive. Sadly he is the weakest of the lot.<br /><br />The fake over operatic vibrato of Amanda Siegfried was painful.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman.. well... He is one of my favorite actors. He is just not a strong enough singer to play Jean Valjean. PITY!  I understand that he has a musical theater background but there are many great male vocalist who STILL can't pull off Jean Valjean.<br /><br />This is set in France, but no one speaks or sings with a French accent, EXCEPT Sacha Baron Cohen, which is so awful, and overacted.<br /><br />Now, Aaron Tveit (Enjolras) is brilliant and Samantha Barks ad a charming, redeeming solo!!!<br /><br />Lastly, they left off, \\" Who am I\\"... Why?<br /><br />I wanted this to be wonderful.  I love this musical and have seen it in several times in London, NY and SF.<br /><br />I haven't seen the movie yet and I may be so inspired by the special effects that I come back and lessen this harsh review. But at this point... Please don't waste your money on THIS musical soundtrack version of Les Misérables. Buy the The Original 1985 London Cast Recording and enjoy this musical has it should be heard.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|It was a good movie, but I'm not a huge fan of this genre. Overall, it was a cool movie, nice special effects, very creepy. I wish we could have learned more about the aliens in it, though.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved this book. Once I started it, I literally could not put it down until I was finished. The chemistry between Sky and Holder is amazing and sucks you in.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Steig's trilogy was the best Ive ever read. Dont know if Ill ever come across a book this engaging ever again.
B002QRWJA4|5.0|I didn't think I liked musicals until I saw The Phantom of the Opera. This film is extremely well done!  It has fantastic production design, superb acting, and the music is phenominal. I can't get enough of this film!
B000I3W1XS|5.0|Absolutely a classic and a must-see if you are a Trek fan. Recommended viewing for the newbies out there whose only introduction to Star Trek was J.J. Abrams excellent Star Trek reboot. This movie was groundbreaking at the time, and gives you an excellent view on just how devoted the Enterprise's crew is to one another.
B00AMBH70S|2.0|Matt Damon got out of the series because he was too old.  The producers made the mistake of not having the lead roles go to younger actors.  Rachel Weisz (42) is not athletic enough and Jerry Renner (41) is not a good enough actor.  In the other movies the best scenes are the fight scenes, in this film there are hardly any.  The chase scene at the end is good.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Susan's voice is so authentic.  I'm not sure how to explain it, but it is getting better and better. I didn't think I could appreciate an album anymore than I did \\"Someone to Watch Over Me\\" but \\"Standing Ovation\\" is fabulous.  Susan really hits it out of the park with this one. She is great on her own, and she is also great with Michael and Donnie.  I grew up watching the Osmonds and I thought they were so handsome and talented, but I haven't thought about Donnie Osmond in years.  He has a very beautiful voice. I was pleasantly surprised.  After hearing Standing Ovation, I started listing in my head all the other songs Susan could record.  The sky is the limit and she seems able to sing any song.  I have never watched talent shows like American Idol or Dancing with the stars. The only thing I would hear was that Simon Cowell was really mean.  Then my daughter showed me Susan's audition and I have been a fan ever since.  Mean or not (and I don't think he is), we owe Simon a debt of gratitude for bringing us Susan.  I have played Standing Ovation over and over, and it only get's better.  My favorites are Somewhere over the Rainbow; the one about the boy coming home; and the duets with Donnie and Michael.  But I also love that song from Fame, and As Long as He Needs Me.  I cannot say enough. It is a wonderful album to listen to while driving, relaxing, even working.  CONGRATULATIONS SUSAN! You never fail to satisfy.[[ASIN:B009G7ZYPY Standing Ovation: The Greatest Songs From The Stage]]
B004F1F32A|5.0|Intense and thrilling challenging action only a Neeson persona can executive in a credible way. The overly protective father finally makes the point how his detail-oriented life succeeds in the end.
B0085YNML2|5.0|Seriously. I've been playing this game almost constantly since I got it. It's very simple, there's not much of a learning curve, but it is super fun. And the little faces the chameleon makes crack me up. Win-win in my book.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|I always enjoy Nelson DeMille's books with their snappy dialog and humorous first-person narration. They tend to be needlessly long and wordy, however, and it usually takes a while to get to the crux of the action. The Panther is no exception to that, and while still snappy and clever, I found that aspect on the tedious side in the Panther. I  learnd a lot about Yemen, Its fractured society, past history, and how it relates to surrounding countries. Good research. All in all, no more than four stars.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|It's not often that a book can combine the details of history with a sense of what the life of the people living through it was like.
B002IE2JF0|4.0|Brings forth the notion of intergalactic war conquering worlds through overpowering the lesser species into the leveling field of one to one combat using primitive weapons and strategic planning to allow the desire for peace to win at the end.
B000I8COBW|5.0|The movie that made Bruce Campbell famous. Everything a B-movie should be- gory, campy, funny, and not afraid to poke fun at itself. Cool little special effects for the time.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Highly original storytelling: riveting confrontations between man (boy) and beast(s), the ravages of the sea, coping and survival (man and beast). Much is learned of animal behavior, much less human behavior and coping mechanisms under extreme stress. The conclusion of Life of Pi lets one down a bit with the final parting of human and tiger, but its closing line leaves one smiling.
B008ASLK8A|5.0|Sherlock Holmes?  Robert Downey, Jr?  Jude Law?  If these are in the title, anywhere, I'm there! I loved this movie!
B009ZQJ0ME|4.0|A balanced production with the challenge of Minority report and the special effects of the Matrix.  A nice blend of action thriller and mystery genre.
B00A757EFW|5.0|Pacman is great and people who said the controls were hard you can change them the game is great I hope evereyone likes pacman
B007HACDLK|4.0|Vince Flynn is the new Tom Clancy but for a master-assassin protagonist cloaked in fewer pages. If you like thrillers, it's hard not to like Flynn. His books are fast-paced and action packed. The Last Man, however, does ring in some Clancy-esque detail.
B006AN78XS|5.0|I'm not a big Woody Allen fan, but I'm a fan of all things &#34;Golden  Age, &#34; and I love Fitzgerald and Hemingway and had just finished reading _A Moveable Feast_ when I watched this movie and fell in love with the beauty of Paris and the rich characterization of all my literary favorites. The characters Owens and his fianc&eacute; are a little stereotypical, but the rest is well, dreamy:)
B00AHSMDQY|4.0|The rise and fall of a hero yields to the relentless power of the aging process and submits the positive message that hope remains in the future as a guiding beacon to those of us seeing the waning of our intellect and physical skills over time.
B0039LYGK2|5.0|Love this movie. If anyone wants a good movie to watch this would be it. And the second part of this movie is great also.
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|I could not watch a foul mouth bear past 30 minutes. I did not laugh. Definitely not my sense of humor.
B0053TMP24|1.0|What were you thinking Rick? I loved the Kane series. But I very strongly disliked this. What were you thinking?
B004X75RCW|5.0|One of my favorite movies.  Romantic Comedy at its best.  Sandra Bullock can play any role perfectly.  And who doesn't love Ryan Reynolds who is adorable in this movie.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|We are a very conservative family and felt the language and moral character that plays out in the movie was appropriate for our family!  Thankful for film the entire family can watch.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Excellent series.  If you decide to read the first book, just buy the series, it's cheaper, and I guarantee you'll end up reading all five books!
B000FC10IO|5.0|Excellent ending for a trilogy. I like how she tied all the blood lines together and explained the charters beginning.
B000EGF0B4|2.0|The item was as described, I was happy with my purchase and would buy from this seller again through Amazon.  I must say I didn't like the movie but my wife did and she is the one who made me purchase it.
B008KRJWEK|3.0|This is a game that trys one thing. It finds new ways for you to spend more money. if you do not upgrade basically the game is boring. When you do upgrade the game starts getting more difficult which wastes the upgrades you have invested in. stay far away from this game!!!!
B00A757EFW|4.0|This game is fun like the arcade game but it is difficult to controll pac man on the kindle fire..
B009G7WUME|5.0|jagged little pill is definately a drug, the tunes are catchy and original. no matter how old this album gets it will be the reason why alanis is forever on my top 5 of female artists.
1426308469|1.0|Love this bood, bought it for my 6 yr old grandson for Christmas.  I read other reviews on this and they were all posiitve.
B00009P1O5|4.0|this CD is a great CD.  I have had the LP for some time, and I liked that, so Decided to get into the 21st century and get the CD of this.  if you are a Neil Young fan, then you should get this CD.
B0042J6VUS|1.0|This item takes forever to come. If you need something fast don't order this. I really can't say if it is any good as I don't have it.
B00A757EFW|4.0|Brings back the old days with Atari frogger is next those were my two favs. Good family time with non violent games!
B008JFUUIA|5.0|I am usually not a fan of movies with singing but I really liked this one. They break up the singing bits with comedy nicely. I would definitely recommend it to friends.
B00631VJIC|5.0|I ordered this and Vol. 2 for my husband for Christmas. I think that he will definitely enjoy the song selections on each disc - I know that I definitely will! I was impressed with how quickly both discs shipped and that they were packaged together. After not finding either of these in any store, this was definitely the way to go!
B00364K6YW|5.0|My husband wanted this for Christmas. He will be excited. I am excited to be able to give him this gift.
B008H5J510|5.0|A very good package with a nice combo and a great movie, even if you don´t like the songs, but if you´re a fan this film is beautiful.<br />Very emotional in some parts, it´s a testment to everyone pursuing your dreams.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|this app on the kindle is junk it wont scroll down to older posts etc. its just a bad app wish it was like the cell app.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This one is so fun and exciting and keeps your mind working very dilligently!!!  Just enjoy this so much, can do it for hours!!
0956010903|5.0|It's been worthy every cent. The stories are great and the book itself is just beautiful. It's everything I could have hoped for.
B009E3EWPI|5.0|5 stars ... the guys are timeless, Jason kept it simple on the kit,didnt try to over do it. I wish they would have played 20 more songs.............
B004TI5N38|5.0|Move over Jack Reacher!  With the movie now out with the 5' nothing Tom Cruise playing Reacher (6'5&#34; 250 lbs) I am afraid the author has lost sight of his fans.  I wonder if Baldacci analyzed  the market and created his character knowing there was an audience looking for this kind of novel...  The Forgotten is even better...
0525958002|5.0|Duran Duran is one of my daughters favorite bands and John Taylor is her favorite member of the group and she loved the historic and current photos
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Let me start by saying that I think I am in love with Colleen Hoover. She writes with so much depth and feeling. Every movement, every breath, every emotion the character had, I had it too while reading this book. She writes with such grace that it all feels so real. Aside from the writing itself, the plot was DEEP. Hard core raw stuff that makes your jaw drop at times. And Holder! Oh, Holder... his words are like silk. I can't think of another way to describe what comes out of his mouth. Then there is Sky. Often times I find female lead character to be annoying and whiny. Not Sky. She's real. I can't give enough praise for this book. The Slammed series was incredibly awesome, and I wasn't sure if Hopeless would live up to Colleen's first two novels... but holy crap...It didn't just live up to them. It took my respect for her as a writer to a whole new level. Just read it. Please!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is a TEN STARS book for me.  It is out of this world good.  Colleen Hoover has written a masterpiece.  This is my favourite book of the year.  What are you waiting for?  Go read it NOW!
B001IYCMNA|5.0|I had an excellent experience installing 8 of these recently. I was impressed with the ease of setup and the number of options available to the IT Professional as far as security, multiple SSIDs, isolation, etc. The client is equally happy with the result of a strong signal throughout an entire indoor/outdoor area with multiple structures.
B00A2XU9IS|4.0|Nice little game, but french translation has to be reworked however games are easy... super for little children ! Could be 5 stars if the sentences are ok
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I started reading this series months ago and I can't put it down.  The third book has a lot of unexpected endings and beginnings.  The plot and twists are almost too much to keep up with.  If you have read the first two this is a must read.  Thank you Amazon!  And George Martin- fantastic.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is my first Colleen Hoover book, but definitely not my last! This is one of the best books I've ever read. Period. It broke my heart and lifted my spirits all at the same time. I adore Holder and Sky. Please, read this story. You will not regret it!
B0037VNX44|5.0|Tom Hardy as Bronson is one of the best performances I've seen on film. Completely disturbing character but amazing how Hardy disappears into it.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|My 4yo daughter was asking for a salon toy for Xmas.  I saw this and thought it looked like a fun alternative.  I picked it up and asked my wife to play with it a bit and make sure it wasn't too complicated for her.  After a few hours of silence (which never happens in a house with small children), I started looking for her and found her still playing (with both of my daughters now) and making all kinds of hair styles.  Certainly worth the price!  A+++ guys!  I can't wait to see what you make next!
B00936A0RU|5.0|Very nice movie about bootleggers in America, exploring the same theme as famous Boardwalk Empire series. Actors are very good, play nicely and director's work is top-notch.<br />Probably not the best movie to watch with small kids due to some violence. If you liked Boardwalk, do try this one as well. Especially given that there is no new season of Boardwalk so far.
B0009U5DD0|3.0|I'm not the best judge of this music. It is good in it's genre but other than that I am not a fan.
B004R36QUE|5.0|I don't have much to add to the dozens of awards this film has won for its terrific acting, directing, and screenplay, except to say that it's also at the core both a wonderful family story and a modern fairy tale complete with a prince who needs rescuing and a happily-ever-after ending.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Beautifully written about the human spirit and how one can survive through unspeakable circumstances.  You feel her pain but also see how she never loses hope. She is the true definition of resiliency.
B0031ES8P6|5.0|It's so cute! I recommend it, yet it is small, that's what makes it even more cutter! (Though, her bow and dress are pink and not purple)
B009UX2YAC|2.0|it made my app store load slow it is a waste of time and I am a nice person and I like a lot of things but this game sums
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|Very disappointed. The graphics are less than stellar and I'd rather use google search via a web browser as a result.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Definitely kept you guessing and a little freaky on how you relate to the characters considering their circumstances. A must read!
B002QE3CTY|5.0|Awesome book, I am definitely going to read the sequel and probably the prequel as well though it was a bit confusing at first
B004EPZ070|1.0|Do not watch this movie!! It definitely ruins the story of the book, the movie was too fast-paced, and it was not romantic at all. They changed up quite a few things in the movie from the book which was disappointing.
B00A80SHFM|1.0|I guess you need to see the film before listening to this CD. As a stand alone soundtrack I find it very weak and lacking. I understand what they were trying to do with the music, but why take away from a musical what makes it a great musical in the first place? Might as well make a non-musical version. Anyway, maybe once I've seen the film I'll feel differently. But based on just listening to this soundtrack, I am not impressed.
B008TMA1LY|3.0|Even as an adult I find this game difficult to use.  In order to purchase of buy a character in order to help in the cafe.  Then you have you to wait 24 hours before you can get your coins or gifts to open the next day.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|I love all of the books! I love the series, I couldn't put this down! Everyone who loves comedy and loves to read books... THIS IS FOR YOU!
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I read this book in less than a day. From the second I began reading it I was hooked, it was very romantic and the characters seemed so real. I am going to watch the movie soon and I hope that it does not disappoint me.
B0092ZEIN4|5.0|This is an excellent little peripheral, lightweight, seems solid and sturdy, looks good.  The only advice I would offer someone considering this purchase is to determine which of your games support HID gamepads out of the box.  The product claims the Nyko Playground software allows you to use this pad with games that don't support gamepads,  THIS IS FALSE.  Installation of the Nyko Playground (BETA) software will cause your gamepad to stop working altogether.  Uninstallation doesn't help.  The only thing that restores functionality is a factory reset of your phone or tablet.  Games that support gamepads (Shadowgun, Dead Trigger, Beach Buggy Blitz, etc.) work exceptionally well using their default gamepad control settings, though I found the sticks to be a little sensitive, usually there is a setting to dial it down.  Games like GTA3 are funky with the default layout, but resist the urge to install the nyko software to remap the keys.  Other than that, works great.
037582913X|5.0|I had to hide this book from both my kids because they are already fighting over it.  I use to read this story when I was little and my cousins use to read it to us as well growing up.  I have fond memories of Grover and wanted to share those memories with them with this book.
B000FC1336|5.0|I could not put the book down. I had not finished Nimitz Class when I ordered the next three books by Patrick Robinson. Not since reading the Patrick O'Brian series of the naval ships of the 1800's have I been so keen to read another series.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Well written and fast moving.  I love the  historical references. Don't usually like multi-character novels, but these are easy to follow and enjoyable.
B000FC13E0|4.0|In the usual brilliant Crichton way, he demonstrates one very possible way for the human race to create it's own extinction.
B0047C2IIE|4.0|Great way to remember holidays past.  Bing never sounded better,  You will have people jamming to the tunes and having fun.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I have seen the trailers for this movie and read the reviews. I decided to read the trial book and was interested, so bout the Kindall version. I am currently at 63 percent of the book and find it to be an excellent read. It is hard to put the book down. I love it. and will want to watch the movie.
B005ZUR724|1.0|I'm glad I only ended up paying 99 cents for a game that does not work. I am also getting an update message but there is no update. They should not have this available for purchase until the situation is rectified. I want my money back. Too bad because it's a cool looking game.
B00992CF6W|5.0|if you don't like minecraft then you probobly play COD if you don't like this app you have no creativite.
B009NPKTN6|4.0|I read a review of this movie that said it was geared to a specific audience: those from the 80s. I thought about that and agree. I think I enjoyed it so much because the music meant a lot to me and brought back great memories from my high school days. All that said, seeing Tom Cruise as Stacee Jaxx is well worth the price of admission here. He's outstanding in this role and is sexy as hell, too. Lots of funny moments & great music - not a bad way to spend a couple of hours!
B008OE05IG|2.0|The democratization of film making has led to a number of documentaries with great subjects made by sub par directors. I wish I could share the enthusiasm of the previous reviewers, but I found this narrative felt like a bad soap opera from the 1980s. It felt like the director was trying to impose the story on the viewer and stretch the length of the film to a running time that would allow it to be shown in theaters. I only wonder what it would have looked like under more capable hands, like Errol Morris or Frederick Wiseman. They would have at least been able to draw out aspects of the lives of this extended family other than a second-rate Shakespearean tragedy.
B007L6VR12|3.0|I bought this movie without hearing much about it, based on the actors/actresses.  I was really disappointed in it and wish that I had only rented it!
B007TUAHVQ|5.0|My sons love the Halo Mega Bloks and this set is impressive.  A definate must have if you don't mind little guys and blok pieces all over.  They are happy for hours....now if they'd just set up somewhere other than my entry way...
B00846REIS|4.0|It is well written and similar to fifty shades of gray therefore, those follower will like this one as well.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Very addictive:) I like it a lot. I would recommend it to others. I like the challenge of the higher settings.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|I've been searching for a long time for a League of Legends type game to play on the go, and Gameloft delivered.<br /><br />This is strictly a team based game where you control a champion to destroy the enemy base while defending your own. Sounds simple? Think again! The game delves much deeper than that. From here it is your own strategies, and tactics that will win the game.<br /><br />You can play 3v3/5v5 PvP, Co-op, or Solo. The game was so popular when it first went live the servers crashed, but now after an apology and new servers opened, the online play is smooth and stable.<br /><br />This game is here to stay, come join me EasyE1982!<br /><br />Give it a go.
0062235893|5.0|Obviously this is a great book, but this version just gives it an extra dimension. Kids get even more out of an experience if there are extra senses involved, and the tactile feel of this book is wonderful. Expect them to use it as a pillow. :)
B004EPZ07K|4.0|First off, the look of this Green Lantern is as cool as it gets.<br /><br />Second, for an origins film this one doesn't let the action lag at all.<br /><br />Overall, this is an excellent superhero flick, and I would put it on par with Thor and Captain America. Thor has the look of an epic fantasy film. Captain America is sort of retro-WW II by the numbers. Green Lantern is an inter-galactic hero.<br /><br />Perhaps one problem people have with the Green Lantern is his powers and their limits are not really well defined. He is powerful enough to destroy Batman or Ironman, but could he muster up enough green power to take on Superman?<br /><br />I rate this one up there with Spiderman 1 and 2 (the Raimi films), and like it more than both Ironman films and the Avengers.
B0091REZMW|4.0|enjoy playing would be better if did not take large amount of energy to play a level.  wish it was not so repetitious ..
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I think this book is great but once I started reading I started wishing the book was a little longer. Also,I would recommend you to get it if you love reading like I do. Finally, I only gave this book four stars because I didn't really like the ending but I still love the book and I'm sure you will to!
B00A757EFW|1.0|after only two levels you have to buy it. total waste of time, was expecting so much more. but no, just two lousy levels
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|Best purchase this year. They really sell it. If you ever wondered what a Teddy bear sounds like.... this ain't it!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Love it, it the third time I read this book and I think that is a great way to get in love again, with the person you love.
B0002IVN9W|1.0|I can't review the music on this album because I only made it through half.  I suppose the songs were OK and, if the second half sounded like the first, it might rank 3 stars.  The problem is that this final master must have been engineered by a moron.  We've all heard of the loudness wars, but this CD sets a new bar for horrific levels of compression.  It is unlistenable. Really, anyone who let this CD leave the engineering studio sounding like it does should be completely ashamed.  It's an insult to anyone who buys the product.  I would say that the artist should be upset their music was treated this way, but in the end they are the ones that should be saying \\"No, we can not release an album that sounds this bad\\".  Maybe the LP sounds better?  The CD gets excellent reviews, so maybe trying the LP would be worthwhile, I just have a hard time getting over the fact that this artist let this CD be released to their fans.
B0050CJNJ2|5.0|I really enjoy this CD from a great group.  They are some country, some easy listening.  I love how the male and female voices go together.  All the songs are very good!  I highly recommend this CD.
B000TGJ8A8|5.0|I really love this movie.  I don't think it gets the credit it should because of the &#34;oh it was all a dream&#34; type of story line.  But it fits perfectly within the parameters of the writers work.  I really loved it.  The blueray quality was top notch, and it had enough special features to make me feel they were at least trying.  Worth a buy.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|Ted The movie would not download and what did download was unwatchable. I am disappointed this was my forst try and probably last.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book is so well written.  There was always a twist or unexpected turn in the story line.  The author revealed portions of the characters' personalities gradually throughout the book.  My only complaint would be the profanity.  It wasn't excessive but I did not think it was necessary.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This story really keeps you reading to see what new twists will arise. You'll want to keep reading to the end to hear the surprise twist!
B00AMBH70S|4.0|I actually enjoyed this better than the Matt Damon Bourne movies.  Possibly because the character had more to lose, was a bit more fleshed out.  The plot was a bit contrived.  But the action was good.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|About a third of the way thru the novel I wasn't sure how I felt about it... all the different story lines.  But the authors pulled it all together and had me turning pages as quickly as possible.  Can't wait till the next novel.
B005VPRGB0|5.0|Good toy, my chlid can experience so many capabilities, he can play with other collections he has, we love to much LEGO's toys and now he is very happy with my chrismass gift.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|This series is an interesting but not necessarily well written. I got bored of its repetitiveness and typos along the way.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|I found the jokes to be funny, probably because I love Family Guy.  However, I am glad I didn't go to the theater to see this. It's a great rental if you like potty humor.  If you love Family Guy, it's a great movie.
B008ASLK8A|4.0|Standard blu-ray packaging, looks pretty good up on the shelf. I bought this as a present for someone who wanted it on their wishlist.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|Absurd, but funny and lovable characters and storyline.  I laughed out loud a lot and the Ted was awesome in the role.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|Every day is new to this woman, yet we find out new things each day that keep you wanting to read onto the next day to find out the real truth of the whole story.
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|I actually felt disappointed with this movie.  Sure the action was there, but it just fell flat for me.  Like they were trying to hard to wrap up too many story plot points, instead of exploring Batman's character like the first 2.
B007HACDLK|3.0|Sometimes authors write to meet publisher's commitments.  I think this book is the result of that.  I found it difficult to get through this book.  I kept reading in the hope that it would end with some of the expected Mitch Rapp suspense.  Maybe next time?
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this app has replaced all other calculators I have. it is very easy to use even for technology challenged people.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I love this game but this game is only for people who really love pets and have a lot of them.
B00A0SLTCU|3.0|It was mediocre action movie.  They didn't do as much with this that they could have.  The acting was good.  The action was very exciting, but it left me feeling that they didn't put enough into the science of the science fiction and really expand on the themes that they could have.
B009HEJXFS|3.0|We enjoyed it even though the streaming broke down twice. That's why we are giving it only three stars. We would have given it at least four. My wife said there were some slow parts in it. I thought it was much better than ordinary fare, but the streaming slips really sucked out some of the fun.
B009YG2ND8|5.0|Square enix needs to get back to its roots the newer games suck. I feel robbed when I pay 60 bucks for a price of crap like ff 12. I am glad to pay 15 for a kick ass old school rpg like this. I hope to see ff 7 soon.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|That's is all I can say is wow. I really have to start reading the next book to find out what happens
B0001BDAQO|5.0|This disc in SACD surround offers a wonderful listening experience that brings you into the studio, theatre or club!  If you like Dave Brubeck's Take Five in SACD surrounds, then this disc is for you.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|For the first time in a long time I couldn't put a book down and it felt good.  From the start of the story to the end I was completely immersed in this book.  I am a normally a very slow reader but I finished this book in 2 days.  I highly recommend reading this book.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|Not on the same level as the original. A little to slow for my taste. Step up your game or end the series.
B005QMOZOO|2.0|This does not have much to recommend it. The crime story is lacking in suspense and rather predictable. James fails to capture the wit and charm of Austen. Her writing seems flat with too much unnecessary back story filling and the artifice of dragging in references to characters in other Austen stories unnecessary and trite. There is no spark to the story, no love story that draws the reader in and no thriller to intrigue. After all I wonder why I even give this two stars. I suppose I hesitate to give a writer of James skill and prestige any lower. Do not bother with this. I read it for free and regret the time. Stick to James earlier works most of which are excellent.
B000OVLINI|5.0|The most memorable characters, intricate plot, historically accurate, couldn't put it down.  Can't wait to read the sequel.  Loved, loved it.
B0083P1QUM|1.0|I am a long time Cornwell fan, but I'm sorry I bought this book. I suffered through it until the end, but I have decided not to &#34;suffer&#34; through another of her books for a long, long time. Oh, how I miss the old days of loving every second of her works.
B00AHSMDQY|3.0|This is not what I had expected from the Batman series. Way to long to keep me focused. Come on Batman. Weak cat woman.

B006M4F67A|5.0|I love this game. Its a lot of fun playing the classic game and the other variations puts a nice twist to it. Easily played when you need a short break but also exercises your mind.
B00A2XU9IS|4.0|Love the concept. Would have like a little more interaction but otherwise great for younger kids<br />Colourful and even the music isn't over baring.<br />Not opened all the doors yet but still looking forward to what's next

0385737955|5.0|I loved the mystery that James Dashner has developed.  His characters are interesting and the story moves quickly enough to keep me engaged.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|First book was good but dropped off from there.  If you want to know what happens then maybe worth the read.  Otherwise I could take it or leave it.
0792164903|5.0|I can watch this movie over and over.  I love it.  It allows you to feel like you are living in Sleepy Hollow.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Predictable. Contrived. These are a few of my reactions to this work. I also think the ending was &#34;a last ditch effort&#34;. Sorry, Gillian Flynn. It was entertaining, but that's about it.
0446580848|3.0|I am a big fan of Nelson DeMille and have read everyone of his books.  This is not one of his best and I am really tired of John Corey wisecracks.

B001AGXEAG|5.0|Reminds me of the good old days.  I would reccomend it to anyone who likes Tim Burton's artwork and movies.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|Freaking amazing book!  A little slow in the beginning and a bit long, but it wraps everything up really nicely.  I prefer to read series that have a definite ending and this one totally does.
0385738765|5.0|I have really enjoyed the first two books in the Maze Runner Trilogy and can't wait to read the third.
B005FLX2WC|3.0|I expected some down and dirty blues.  Both of these musicians are capable of much better work than this, I just expected more.
B00006LSZ4|5.0|Tim Burton is an awesome artist!  This movie is the essence of his artistic work and would reccomend it to everyone.
B009VB7QQA|3.0|I thought it was alright for what it was. Nothing special. The trailers are too much hype. Rent it unless you're one of those vampire flick fans.
0375507256|1.0|Not very interesting<br /> This is not the type of book I enjoy and would not recommend it to anyone to read
B000WGWQG8|5.0|We rented the first disc from netflix and my daughter (age 15) and I watched it and she absolutely loved it. She wanted the series for her birthday (16th) and she's watched it several times through. It certainly is a great series that conveys the difficult and complex situation of our independence. The cast did an amazing job as well. Our family loves the John Adams series, and we hope HBO makes more like it.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. I was engaged the entire time and felt connected to the love at first sight
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game has a lot of mystery and suspense. I like it because it does provide a challenge unlike some games I can finish in one day.

B00A0SQBDM|5.0|This game is so much fun. Got to try it. Takes you on amazing maze of clues Can't wait for the next step. Play it now!
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|This movie was pretty good. Not amazing but still it was well worth the 4 bucks it cost to rent it. I'd definitely watch it again.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It has the right combination of drama and passion, the protagonists were sweet and you could understand them, including their choices and options.
B008KW43TE|5.0|Though I loved all the songs, cohesively it seemed kind of random. Maybe I'm just artistically challenged. I loved the groove of &#34;White&#34;. Weird that the instrumental of the album turned out to be my favorite song.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|for those who like these games this is a good have not spent a real dollar yet :) its also additive runs smooth I wish my p.s vita had stuff like this
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I liked the book but it really was not all it wad hyped up to be. The second half was nothing
B008Y7IFSA|4.0|This review will have 2 parts, one actually on the movie itself and the other on the version I purchased on Amazon Instant streaming.<br /><br />As the movie goes, if you're looking for a close translation of the Christmas Carol novel, you would never bother to even look at a muppet version, so of course, they take liberties with the story although the message and general gist of the movie is the same. It's a safe version for the kiddos, not too scary for the Ghost of Christmas future, although some little ones could get scared. Otherwise, the movie is soooo quotable and even has cute references to the muppets characters outside of the film that the adults will appreciate. One of my faves is a scene with Sam the Eagle where he makes the statement \\"it is the AMERICAN way\\" only to have Gonzo correct him to say \\"it is the BRITISH way.\\"<br />I've been watching this movie for all the 20 (yikes!) years its been out and it's still good every time.<br /><br />Now for the Amazon instant version I bought, it viewed very well. Except for when they cut out a complete scene. Now, if you're unfamiliar with the movie, you'd probably never notice it, but since I've been watching this for 20 years now, it was painfully obvious to me that the scene was cut, and one of the great songs in the movie along with it.  So, that's the only reason I rate this 4 stars since Amazon cut \\"the love is gone\\" song and scene. Boo on you Amazon!
B000YHG72E|5.0|Great Christmas movie for the whole family to enjoy. Will Ferrell is hilarious! Don't miss out rent it for a holiday family movie night!
B005NJU8PA|5.0|This book is addicting!!... like Pringles \\"once you pop, the fun don't stop.\\" I first heard about Tim Ferriss from my mother. She had been nagging me to read Ferriss' second masterpiece, the 4-Hour Body after a trip to Botswana, Africa where the guide at her camp suggested the book. For an author's work to be so infectious that it travels to freakin Botswana, you know there must be something special about it. The 4-Hour Chef possesses that same power. It is above and beyond just a cookbook... it is a compilation of incredible culinary tips, tricks, and recipes as well as beautiful photography, a wealth of useful skills (inside and outside the kitchen) and an incredible abundance of knowledge that everyone should obtain. With the easy to follow recipes in this book, you will be able to impress your family and friends with your newly acquired ninja cooking techniques and delectable dishes. For the first time, I have people demanding to know how I cooked my steaks to perfection... never in my LIFE has someone wanted to replicate any meat dish that I have prepared because I usually turn my steaks into meat flavored chewing gum from overcooking. Also, the chapter on meta-learning is brilliant and could be used to enhance anyone's life! This is a cookbook for all levels and I love that as my cooking skills progress, I can continue to challenge myself with all kinds of fun and unique cooking methods such as using gels to create dishes that look and taste Iron Chef worthy. I feel like I could ramble on forever about why you should buy this book but I am late for my date with some air squats (the segment titled `damage control' in the book, pg. 376 will explain the beauty of air squats). Please do yourself a favor this holiday season and spend a dollar less on all the presents you are buying for others until you reach $21.00 and buy this book! Or make this year the easiest holiday shopping ever and buy this book for everyone, rest assured that your gift won't just become another shovunda! (shovunda the bed).<br /><br />Nicely done Mr. Ferriss! Keep inspiring and empowering people around the world to achieve greatness.<br /><br />Cheers!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I got this book after a NPR feature about a college listing it for Freshmen reading.  It is a great story and I loved the way it  went to different locations and times of the zombie war.  Reading it on kindle was also a plus as the printed book was extremely small print and I can adjust the size of the print on the kindle.

B000025Y9I|5.0|I had never heard of Chris until a friend introduced his Road to Hell album to me.  Love his deep, smooth voice, very effortless, very close and real without embellishments - he has a great voice without any ad-ons.  Love the stories he tells in his songs too.  My particular favourite is Daytona; the sounds are deep and rhythmic and the finish with the sound of a V8 (or similar) is realistic and is a great closing to the song.  Just love his easy style.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Very good. I was surprised I enjoyed it as much as I did. Ready to read the next book. Excellent.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Accuweather is exactly what I wanted in a weather app. It's fast with the right information in logical, easy to access format.
B005721W9O|5.0|This is such a great movie parody of the Star Trek phenom.  From the way he sits in the capt chair to the dramatic poses, shirtless scenes and winning at the ned.  The only negative...no next movie.

B003UESJHY|5.0|NO SPOILERS   THE FIGHTER has Melissa Leo and Christian Bale manipulating in ways that are so subconscious and persuasive that it's hard to see.  Mark Wahlberg and Amy Adams become their characters as well.<br /><br />The poignancy of the changing moments are invisible to the physically and (most important) MORALLY deteriorating junky, Dicky Eklund (Bale).  It's sad and chilling - the way such bankrupt perspectives can be sympathetic; but, the makers of FIGHTER find and dramatize these significant moments.  Seeing the lifelessness and perplexity of willful blindness in his and his mother's (Leo) eyes is disconcerting.  The subject matter of the HBO documentary lauded by Dicky Eklund (and his mother's misleading support) is a particularly heart-rending plot point.<br /><br />In the scene in which Micky Ward (Wahlberg) confronts his mother, Dicky (and many sisters), with his love interest at his side (Adams); I found my mouth hanging open.  \\"Academy award,\\" I said, pointing to Leo.  \\"Academy award.\\"  I pointed at Bale.  \\"Academy award,\\" I said, and I pointed to Amy Adams.<br /><br />An absolute must-see!!  :-d
0553328255|5.0|The books are amazing reads!!  My husband and I read them to each other on long road trips.  It has become a &#34;thing&#34; for us to have a Sherlock Holmes story handy when we travel.<br /><br />The package shipped VERY quickly and was in GREAT condition!
B0076DELIG|5.0|Once again, Michael Connelly brings Harry Bosch back to life. It never gets stale as Harry stubbornly pursues a twenty year old case against significant odds. Connelly beautifully depicts Harry as a dedicated detective with serious personality flaws. He is not your typical cardboard character depicted by too many authors. Tough book to put down.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|This is a great game. So much fun to pass the time with. I would definitelt recommend it to all ages.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|I watched the extended preview and it looked really interesting so I rented the movie for 24hrs and I gotta say it wasn't as interesting as I thought it would be.  I mean the movie was okay but there were scenes in it that reminded me of Aliens and I didn't like that.  Makes the movie seem not very original.  I was hoping to see something new but unfortunately it didn't happen with this one.
B00AJRQLTI|3.0|I hope that the visual of Crow fits the character of Javert.  His voice is murder.  He sings like Pierce Brosnan in Mama Mia.  I knew the soundtrack would not rival the Broadway Cast Recording, but Crow's Javert is an insult.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This review and others can be found at [...]- Jointly reviewed for totallybooked<br /><br />Jenny:  Gitte,  is it possible to fall in love with a book and its characters from the first few pages, because if it is then that is exactly what happened to me in Hopeless by Colleen Hoover. I fell in love with this book instantly and my feelings didn't waiver until I read \\"the end\\" and even then I've spent the past few weeks thinking about this book and how it affected me.<br /><br />To say I have loved everything this author has written is an understatement. Every word she writes is flawless and every word demands to be read. This story took me completely by surprise.  I didn't know what to expect and what I got was so much more than I could have ever  hoped for.  This story touched me, moved me, humoured me and devastated me and I loved every minute of it.  Hopeless is a darker read than Slammed and Point of Retreat and I was absolutely enthralled with the places this author took me throughout this book.<br /><br />Gitte:  I am speechless Jenny, after I had finished this book I felt faint; every word this Author wrote squeezed my heart tight; made me dizzy and light headed....my eyes hurt as did my head; I just could not put it down! I am in complete awe and utter admiration....Reading Sky and Holder's story left me breathless, made me cry. This Author captures a reader in a tight hold carries you with words that each takes their rightful place in your heart and doesn't let you go until the story has been told. Long after, every single word still stays with you. This story just flowed so naturally. The relationship between the characters was inspiring their relationship and story intense.<br /><br />\\"The sky is always beautiful. Even when it's dark or rainy or cloudy, it's still beautiful to look at....it'll be there no matter what...and I know it'll always be beautiful.\\"<br /><br />Jenny:  I know how immersed you were in this story, you wouldn't even answer your phone until you finished it.<br />Sky is heading off to High School (and school in general) for the first time after being home schooled by her Mum for her school life. Unfortunately, she is forced to do this on her own as her best friend Six is moving away for six months and leaving Sky to face her first year of school alone.<br />Her  introduction to school isn't a pleasant one with the other students already having a preconceived opinion of who Sky is - they couldn't be more off the mark where Sky is concerned, but Sky takes it all in her stride and she is lucky enough to make a friend in Breckin.  This friendship is just so warm and funny!  I just loved these two. They were kindred spirits and I absolutely cracked up at the banter between these two.<br />I have to say GG that I just ADORED Sky.  She was strong, independent, yet vulnerable in some ways, funny and when her story starts to develop my heart just ached for her and the sorrow and sadness I felt for her was all encompassing.<br /><br />Gitte: LOVED Sky; she was an amazing character. She is up front and doesn't suffer fools gladly. She is honest, genuine, funny, adorable, naïve yet knows more than a person should know. The somewhat sheltered life she has had, for reasons which become clear, has left her with this endearing quality an tangible innocence. Yet at the same time she had a spot on sense of humour and a sarcasm which yeah made me fall in love with her even more!<br /><br />Jenny:  Sky has never \\"felt\\" before.  She has kissed a few boys, but she has not felt anything with them...nothing.  That all changes when she meet Holder.<br />Dean Holder has a troubled past and a reputation and temper that precedes him.<br />Dean Holder......Wow! Be still my beating heart!  I LOVED this guy! He stole my heart from the outset. There is an instant attraction between these two but it's not just an attraction - it's something deeper, something instant, a connection.  They both feel it and the chemistry between these two was palpable.  You absolutely felt their connection and you immediately needd to know why Holder especially is so drawn to Sky.<br />Sky is wary of her feelings for Holder but she confides in him.  In Holder she sees something, she begins to open up to him and express her feelings of \\"nothing\\" -.<br />Holder assures her that with him she will \\"feel\\" -  \\"the moment my lips touch yours, it will be your first kiss. Because if you've never felt anything when someone's kissed you, then then no one's ever really kissed you.  Not the way I plan on kissing you\\" - and how true this was! Not only did Sky feel that first kiss but I swear I did too GG!<br /><br />Gitte:  If anyone could make Sky feel again it had to be Holder. Seriously Jenny, what can I say about Holder. He was pretty damn perfect! I LOVE this guy. He was perfectly imperfect!! And yeah Jenny I could feel the hairs on the back of my neck and arms stand up because I felt it too!<br /><br />Jenny:  I felt exactly the same GG!  To watch the relationship between Sky and Holder develop and flourish was something I devoured! These characters entered my heart....they nestled deep down in it and have found a place there forever.<br /><br />The intimacy these two shared could be felt, with every word, with every touch and with every breath you feel it.  This author really does have a way of bringing her characters to life and in this story they are brought to life so realistically that at times I actually found myself clutching my heart.  You really do care what happens to these characters.<br /><br />Gitte:  This is where I have to bring the intensity up again. This Author just has this amazing talent  that completely draws a reader in. Her words have a hard impact yet they soothe too; making each established word count in a way that it gets absorbed and doesn't leave, instead burrowing itself into the heart of the reader thereby creating a scene, an atmosphere, a picture, a feeling, a memory a smell even a perception or judgement.<br /><br />The characters in this story...I loved them. Both of them. Their story... was beyond heartbreaking, amazing, touching, beautiful and emotional even funny at times. Hopeless is without doubt one of the best books I have read this year. What an amazingly talented Author Colleen Hoover is, Sky and Holder will always have a piece of my heart!<br /><br />Jenny:  Couldn't agree more GG.  This is definitely going to be up there as one of my best reads for this year that's for sure! As each piece of the story was peeled away and their pasts revisited, my heart broke one piece at a time.  It initially broke for Sky but in the end it shattered for both of them.<br /><br />There were twists and turns all through this book and the reveal crushed me.  The way it was handled amazed me.  The ending satisfied me.  It all felt so real, and I felt I was there with them in the moment for every moment.  My interest, concern and love for these characters never wavered and I felt every emotion they felt.<br /><br />There is the perfect blend of light and dark in this book so you don't feel weighed under with sadness but you do feel sad, you do feel the hopelessness and the hopefulness of Sky and Holder.  Just as it becomes too much and you think you won't recover, the author injects humour and warmth and brings you back from the brink.  It was perfectly crafted, wonderfully told and Hopeless forever has a special place in my heart.<br /><br />J&G:  This book is a departure from Slammed and Point of Retreat and we're so glad this author took the plunge and wrote this story.  As readers we love and admire any author who can break the mould and produce a story that surprises us and gives us something different and that's exactly what happened with Hopeless.  Don't' got into this thinking it's a carbon copy of her previous books.  It isn't, and it is for this reason that this books so excited us.<br />Colleen Hoover is one storyteller who we feel could write just about anything and it would be captivating.<br />:aking, amazing, touching, beautiful and emotional even funny at times.

B002VPE1WK|4.0|I bought this after watching the video review. It's an excellent backpack to have if you own DSLR cameras +lenses and accessories. The make of the backpack is very good. The only problem I had with this backpack was that one of the Velcro strap was bad which holds the body of the camera. It was a poor stitching job I guess. I used a Stick fast and fixed it.  The best part is the protection the backpack provides to your investment that you store in it. It has good amount of padding around it to support and keep the contents safe from impacts.<br /><br />What I store in this Backpack:<br />My Canon T4i Body, All my lenses I have two, All documentation of the hardware; warranties + Purchase receipts, Batteries, SD Cards, My two tripods and a mono-pod, lens cleaner kits, A high sensitive directional mic, cables and manuals.<br /><br />Overall it's an excellent buy. Hope this review helps.
0143034901|5.0|Gripping tale with plenty of plot twists and fascinating characters. Makes me want to travel to Barcelona! Can't wait to read other titles by the author.
0439023491|5.0|So, here it is: the second book of the trilogy, the \\"Catching Fire\\". What I feared the most was for this book to be horribly boring and still for the audience to drop out from the series. However, it may seem that our star author did her job well, and kept the flame going.<br /><br />The storyline picks up right where we left off, in the train heading toward district twelve. Although I do make it sound like as if the part is illustrated in real-time in the book, it felt more as a summary of what was happening during our absence between the book. After the \\"final\\" interviews of visiting all the districts, they expected an easy life, wealthy living, and a relaxing end. Of course, the odds were entirely not in their favor.<br /><br />Since the hunger games they won was the 74th, this year, it is the 75th, the third Quarter Quell, where the demands are \\"different\\" from the anniversary hunger games. The first Quarter Quell (25th) insisted that each districts had to vote the children they wanted to send, the second demanded two boys and girls each to be sent out for the arena (total of 48 kids), and now, the third, does something Katniss never expected: the reaping will be pooled off the living victors. Katniss has to go again.<br /><br />To farther cut off possible spoilers, I will end off the review here, but keep in reminder that there will be a HUGE flip-over at this book. It flows steadily through, but at near the end, everything changes. It well worth buying, and I recommend you to do the same: when it is just a loan, you cannot read a much as you like, and with this series, I bet that you will want to.
B0084BMUFA|4.0|Beautiful rendition of this classic story; illustrations did not appear, hence the four stars rather than five. I would still recommend it to anyone.
0547884591|5.0|I have all 3 books by Timothy Ferriss, and so far I have learned a lot from this one too. I reference it frequently, and I still have more to read.  I intend to give a copy to friends and family.  Cooking has become more fun and food has started to taste even better since I bought it.  I appreciate all the valuable information!
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|Very suspenseful and gripping. Hard core and fun to watch. It leaves you in wonderment and eager for more, cant wait for next week!
B008ASLNN2|5.0|Timing, acting, writing, special effects, stunts, cinematography, Well done!  Great family movie. Reminds me of the old TV show &#34;Wild, Wild West&#34;.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|I was a little concerned that this would be preachy about the environment but it was actually a very cute movie, touching and SHOWING the consequences of gluttony and irresponsibility without being too over the top or preachy about it.
B00009EJC5|5.0|Not only for lovers of James Brown/R&B/Funk, but just for lovers of good music in general.  A must have.  The standout for me is definitely the version of &#34;Give it Up or Turnit Loose&#34; included here.
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|It was hard to get too into this storyline because it was so unlikely a concept.  I had the same problem with the book and didn't finish it. I like Jennifer Lawrence and she and some other cast members make it worth watching.
B005MJ883K|5.0|it is the beast thing ever. thank you<br />. we have lots of fun with it. every one needs one.
B003AYMZO2|5.0|The character, Walter White, shows you a transformation of a mild meek individual who takes a journey as a Meth cook down a dark and dangerous path for money to provide for his family.  Season three gets more intense in its storyline.
B008CPZNL6|3.0|the best social hub by far. BUT !!! it does not work in landscape and it is stuck in only one portrait view. it s a 5 star app that dropped the ball with polishing it. i would give it 3 and a half if i could. i appreciate it came on the kindle. hope they fix this.

B004QL7K8E|5.0|Epic party man !!! Strict security. Wouldn't want to mess with them. If u say it u would know what I'm talking about.
B004PVKFR8|5.0|I originally got this album after listening to Sail on Youtube and have come to love the other songs just as much. I use Wake Up as my personal alarm clock ringtone as it starts out with a soft woman's voice saying wake up that repeats itself three times increasing in urgency each time. The song then goes into a drum beat and a guy's voice comes on and starts singing in a fast paced rock styled song. The rest of the album is fun, upbeat, and great to clean house to.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|Here you have a wonderful story through the eyes of dog called Enzo. He says so much about how life and living it. He understands more than many humans. Great read!
B009CGYO0K|5.0|Go look at [...] and see if you like the comics on there. If you do, you will find a number of them reprinted in this book as well as a few new ones. Very funny book overall and I would highly recommend it!
B00079HZUM|5.0|Stage Beauty is set in Restoration London, a pivotal moment for women when Charles II decrees that no longer will men play women's roles in the theater.  But what of the beautiful men whose lives and careers have been built around these roles?  Ned Kynaston, one of the last of the male actors performing as women, tumbles from the apex of being a star in a series of humiliating experiences. Whereas Shakespeare in Love explored the boundary between reality and performance using the play Romeo and Juliet, this movie uses the play Othello.  Kynaston and the new Desdemona, his former assistant, Maria, bring an intensity to the issues of ambition, jealousy, sexual ambiguity, ego, and the true nature of acting.  The entire movie is a treat, but the ending is definitely worth waiting for.
B0083DJWGO|5.0|I'm a big fan of Taleb's outlook and interpretation of things that go bump, jostle and jolt. His insights are valuable.
B001EJGQTU|5.0|Absolutely, one of the best documentaries of all time.  If you are old enough to have lived duing his time in government, it is even more interesting hearing him reflect on the history of which he participated.  And the 11 lessons he has learned in life are timeless.  A truly great move.
B0059XTU1S|4.0|That's not a serious film about Tolkien and his \\"The Hobbit\\" novel, the novel before the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" series. That's a movie for young teenagers. Action is primary and slightly primitive too. And what's more they cut up a one volume book into slices.<br /><br />Apart from that disappointment, we have to say it is well done and the special effects are perfect but they are nothing but special effects and they produce no sympathy, empathy or compassion. They just produce surprise and movement.<br /><br />So what about that Hobbit Bilbon Sacquet, one of these simple short men who live somewhere underground among the roots of some trees, who dedicate their lives to studying and accumulating knowledge about everything and the rest. Scholars, savants, scientists, how can he go on roads and run after adventure? Hobbits just can't, full stop, period, endgame and endpoint.<br /><br />So what about this particular Hobbit who is literally kidnapped by shame into joining an adventure in which he is not really wanted but just opportunistically needed. But his presence is resented by some of these dwarves he is supposed to travel with and help re-conquer their own kingdom out of which they have been ousted by a fiery dragon Smaug a long time ago and are since then chased by all kinds of monsters like trolls, goblins, orcs  or whatever these monstrous monsters are.<br /><br />The elves are beautiful and charming, grand and elegant, cultivated and prudent and yet they are not used to the utmost level they could have served. They are just nearly an obstacle on the road, along the way, that has to be pushed aside and then a beautiful butterfly will bring the big birds who will save the situation in its last dire strait but nothing is made as clear as it should be. We are just piling up or stringing down one event after another in some kind of pearl necklace.<br /><br />Too bad because this novel by Tolkien is by far a masterpiece, but not the film, in spite of its length for just a first slice.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUst a first slice.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU
B008RA3X5E|1.0|Clock either crashes or the alarm doesn't work. I upgraded the free version just because I wanted to play music for my alarm. Alarms were set but they do not go off. Very disappointed in this wish I could get my money back for this and find an app that actually works like it's supposed to.
B004ZJZPXO|5.0|Big fan of the series (Firefly) and huge fan of this movie.  I would pay big money for this series to return of for another movie to be made, but what can you do?  Anyway, buy this, even if you never saw the tv show, it is an awesome stand-alone movie for all to enjoy.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Just wow! Ms. Hoover delivers again. Wow. Just wow! What a storyteller she is. Read this book and everything else she has written. You will not regret it.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|Vindication for the Star Trek nerds of bygone eras. Also a great vehicle for young and talented actors - some faces you've seen before and many you'll want to see again.
B004EI3ON4|3.0|This review isn't about the music (which is great!), it's about the quality of the compression used in making the MP3 files.<br /><br />Almost all of the tracks have clipping issues in them.  This creates a &#34;scratchy&#34; sound during any hard-hitting/loud moments in a song, i.e. bass lines.  I was able to clean up about 95% of it using volume leveling/anti-clipping software.  Luckily, my efforts paid off and I can now enjoy this album.  Unfortunately, nobody should have to do this to get clean audio.  It should have be taken care of during the ripping and compressing stage.
B002ZTQVBQ|5.0|Studio Ghibli delivered another lovely children's story that won't bore adults to death along the way.  While there are some slightly scary moments this should be safe for all but the most timid young children.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|I bought this for my mom and she loved it.  She said it was a great book.  The movie was good too.
B009KHCT94|3.0|Clever twists, campy humor, and a bit of quirkiness are what I have come to expect from these guys and Iron Sky delivers pretty much what I expected.  Sure, they are just having a bit of fun more than telling a real literary kind of story, but if I wanted that I would have rented Lord of the Rings.  I thought that the romantic storyline was handled better than I was expecting.<br /><br />There was a strain of anti-americanism in the film I didn't much care for, but it was passing and cut with humor so it didn't ruin the movie for me.
0671449028|5.0|I bought this book when my son was having a hard time geting to bed.  It gave him a routine to work on and he loved it.

B008Y1YK9Y|2.0|Repetitive, if you've seen the first two, you've seen this one.  Slight changes but mostly the same old shtick from the last two
B007M45PMU|5.0|For less than the price of a cup of fancy coffee, you can own this excellent album.  You won't be sorry.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Love this.  I can leave myself reminders on my desktop so I don't miss sales, coupons, appointments, ect.  Easy to use.
B001DE29SS|5.0|I keep lending this movie to people because it is such a good film. Robert Downey jr is amazing! And anyone can enjoy it whether an old timer who likes black and whites or a young one who is learning about the arts. You could know nothing about Charlie Chaplin and still be able to enjoy the humor and heart in this film.
0316069434|2.0|I was excited to see a new Harry Bosch novel.. I think I have read them all and truly enjoyed reading them.  This one disappointed both me and my husband.  It was sort of boring and lacked the excitement of his other books.  It just may be time for \\"good old Harry\\" to retire!  At least work in a new partner who is younger and have some of the pizzazz the younger Harry had.  I am disappointed in this book.
B009KHDT0C|3.0|I like Tim burton a lot but I feel like he may have over did his &#34;weird&#34; movie thing. I won't ruin the movie for you if you plan on watching it but the ending killed it when a teenage girl turns out to be something. It's corny. Not strange like I like it.
B000002GLE|4.0|I, like most of the other reviewers really enjoy this set.  I've owned it for over 20 years and every once in a while it still gets a play.  It's aged well and Sting chose great songs and great musicians for this release.  One thing I find a bit annoying about this live release however, is the fade out/fade in of most (if not all) of the songs.  They apparently compiled this from several shows or something as there is silence between the tracks and it loses some of the energy being presented in this fashion - just one man's opinion.  An example is \\"Another Day\\"  This is a cool mostly-unavailable-otherwise track and it feels like we are missing a little of the song as it fades in and you definitely are missing some of the first notes.
030746363X|5.0|The slow-carb diet is effective- period. I lose between 2-4 lbs per week on it, I know a few who lose a little more, some a little less. Your mileage will vary. The kettlebell exercises are also very effective. I highly recommend this book to anyone trying to lose weight, especially those who have plateaued on their current weight loss regime.
B00APUYN0I|3.0|Entertaining. The music is what makes the movie. Great a capella singing. If you liked the (cancelled) show \\"The Sing Off\\", you will like this movie.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Good by my standard, but not one of Grishams best efforts. Needed more substance...bad guys winning is not the best ending...
B00APUQJLO|4.0|was pleasantly surprised at the quality of acting in this adaptation of Dilillo's book. should have guessed that cronenberg would only pick the best. binoche, gadon,giametti and even pattinson are a tour de force in bringing this wierd  book to the screen. will watch it again and see something new each time.
B0034JKZ86|5.0|Thank you so much for this dvd. Even though it is used it is in GREAT condition and my daughter loves it.....
B007TXN4TK|5.0|This is fun!  I set the number of keys to 8 so that I could use better fingering to play the notes. This does while away time and I would certainly recommend it to others!  I am going to buy the full version!
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|This book was very good.<br />The best in the series. It has very good twists in it. The best diary of a wimpy kid yet
0684135051|5.0|This is a great reference book for any Knitter.  It introduces the concept of gauge, choosing yarn, needles, and stitches for your project.  It does have some cute patterns (child's hooded Tomten jacket is a popular one), but I constantly refer to it for guidance in making a top-notch, well-finished garment.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|I love this movie. My whole family makes a point of watching it every year. You will roll laughing the entire time
0446554995|2.0|I have always been a huge fan of the authors (all of their stories, not just the Pendergast series).  This story has quite honestly been the most disappointing by far!  The beloved characters of the previous books are not evident in this story at all!  They have been twisted and turned to fit the plot and its almost as if somebody wrote this story.  I miss the characters as they originally were.
B00A80SHFM|1.0|I haven't seen the movie yet, but I've been listening to this soundtrack since I got it yesterday. Marius, Eponine, and Enjolras do really well in it.  Marius, Eddie Redmayne, and Eponine, Samantha Barks, do amazing work with their songs, keeping their roles true to the original songs while giving you a sense that they're real. Currently in a love hate relationship with I Dreamed a Dream because there are some real bad notes in it... but i think for the sake of expression they are excusable.<br /><br />Another review said that after track 11, the soundtrack gets better, and that's because Jackman and Crowe don't sing in the 3 following tracks... Gonna be honest, they really sucked it up. I watched an interview where Russel Crowe wrestled with the character of Javert, saying that he couldn't see how Javert comes to the conclusions he does in the musical. Crowe seems to miss that Javert lives in a black and white world of principles... Javert is kind of a flat character that way. That's why the best Javerts in the theatrr have played him with a booming, confident voice... Crowe portrays a meek Javert, or at least, that's what he sounds like. He sounds strong at the beginning in look down, but in confrontation he sounds like he doesn't truly know why he's there. In Stars, Javert is supposed to be awed by the stars and swearing before God, but Crowe sounds like he's just singing his bedtime prayers.. its really really weak. Javert's Suicide... granted I haven't seen it, but, based on the soundtrack, it would seem to me that Crowe's not really that broken up about his life. I mean, come on, Javert's life is suddenly in shambles; all of his principles and his black and white world are supposed to be shattered.... yet Crowe sings the words softly and with great restraint. He's hitting notes accurately, but he doesn't make them sound real.<br /><br />I know that Jackman has background in theater, but I'm pretty sure that if I heard his voice in a stage musical, I'd want mymoney back... especially if he were the main character of one of the most popular musicals to hit the world. He seems to think that tears are the only way to show intense emotion; he doesnt lean on the voice's other faculties, besides being broken up by tears, such as volume control and changing your vocal tone. Valjean's soliloquy is an interesting idea... but its not really a song. Jackman is letting his acting and tears totally take over the song , instead of tactfully working them into the song that has captured hearts for the last 25 years. Its a musical. Use the conventions of the musical to show emotion as well as the conventions of a movie. The worst is Bring Him Home. Another critic used the word \\"bellowed\\" to describe this tragedy and I think thats an understatement. The song is belted all the way through with very little volume control. Aren't there supposed to be soldiers sleeping around him? It's funny, because people excuse his butchering of one of the most powerful moments in Who Am I as a change based on setting, when in Bring Him Home, Jackman seems very inconsiderate of his sleeping comrades.. There is no sense of urgency, no sense of pain (except for his vocal chords), no sense of trust in God (which describes Valjean once he is changed at the beginning), no sense of peace at the end of the song. Instead, I seem to have peace that maybe Jackman lost his voice as some sort of divine retribution....the main redeeming part of Jackman's performance is that in confrontation he carries the strength and urgency in his voice, but this same sense of urgency isn't even carried in One Day More.<br /><br />TL;DR: Jackman and Crowe were bad picks. Given that they were main characters, this gets a 1 star. Stick with the Symphonic recording or the 10th anniversary... Im watching this movie for Marius, Eponine, and Enjolras. Note for future directors: Live singing doesn't matter if your Valjean sounds like an animal crawled in his throat and died...
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This is an app us many times a day on my Kindlr Fire HD and it works great! It is for th  person who wants to keep in touch with friends, if you want to play the games or video chat it is not for you.
B001E5CH0G|1.0|I bought this to watch with my family before Christmas. Arrived last night and I opened it this evening to find only the Digital Copy and no BluRay disk inside. Just an empty slot where it should be. Disk was shrink-wrapped and all, just no disk. I ordered a replacement and it shows it will arrive the day after Christmas. Bad Amazon experience....
B000GGSM7G|5.0|I still own my old 1984 LP and now I got this deluxe 2-CD version.<br /><br />The mastering is very different. Even the mixing is slightly different. Some songs are even at different speeds. It's like it's a different album.<br /><br />The artwork inside the booklet bears very little similarity with the artwork from the LP's insert and back cover. It's quite different. Those strange magic circles and dark symbols from the LP are not here. Instead, this is a somewhat cheery visual blare. Nothing wrong with it. Both darker and happier styles actually fit the album. Both artworks are wonderful, but almost entirely different.<br /><br />The top is rather a Robert Smith solo album. Not the pop work The Cure would usually record. The Cure is my all-time favorite band and The Top may not be my favorite album (that would be \\"Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me\\" -- please, avoid the 1987 CD issue of the album; either get the newly mastered CD version or the old cassette or vinyl, as those were all good). But \\"The Top\\" is easily the most interesting and intriguing album I've ever heard. After a first listen, \\"the caterpillar\\" just sticks in our minds. After a few more listens, you may catch yourself humming \\"Shake dog shake\\". \\"The empty world\\" retells a passage inside Penelope Farmer's book \\"Charlotte Sometimes\\". The album is very enjoyably scary and disturbing. It's also somewhat fetishistic in some aspects.  Not for the casual listener or pop fans. It's an album for those who like unusual, weird, interesting things.<br /><br />The bonus disc is a special treat. Several songs are great. Some demo versions are so different, it's like they're other, different songs. Not just different versions of the same songs. Even the words are different and the arrangements differ greatly. One can hardly recognize them. Of the deluxe series, this is the only one with a bonus disc that's really worth it.  \\"Faith\\" is only worth in the double version for \\"Charlotte Sometimes\\" to be included (why wasn'tit included on disc 1, since it wasn't full?? And why on Earth was it not included in the \\"Greatest Hits\\"???).  As for the other ones, I recommend one should buy the single-disc remastered versions instead.<br /><br />If you buy this CD, I'd still recommend to check the old vinyl. It's almost not the same album. And they're all very interesting.<br /><br />Listen to this on your headphones.<br />No, there's no way you'll dance to this.<br />Yes, it's wonderful art.
B0084U0IEG|1.0|A very slow paced and rather boring read. Extremely disappointed. Would not recommend this book to anyone. Will delete it from my kindle.
B000PUB9I2|5.0|I'm a big fan of Francis Cabrel.<br />If you need to buy one album from him, I'd recommend \\"Samedi soir sur la terre\\". But half of that album is here. So my favorite track is not, but I knew it was no hit.<br /><br />All the hits are here.  Two very long discs. A very rich collection. Superb mastering.<br /><br />As usual, the cover is not a standard jewel-case. Each of his CDs has a different style cover. Usually digipak, but not the average digipak. This is a jewel case, but not the standard jewel case and it takes a while to get used to it. No, it won't fit a standard jewel case, so don't change it. Just don't panic. It does store the discs and the booklet nicely. Just differently (and I'm having a hard time adjusting).<br /><br />If you want a general view of this artist, this CD is all you need.<br />No fillers. All songs are great. Someone's favorite may have been left out.<br /><br />If you'd like to start with one of the original albums instead, that would be \\"Samedi soir sur la terre\\".

B009ZE27US|5.0|I'm convinced that most reviews on amazon must be done by children. It is not a game. It is not real, nor does it claim to be. It is a joke, a prank, something to laugh at and to be silly. It is not someone that wants your fingerprints. It does not really scan your fingerprints. OMG.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|Just like Tim's previous books but it integrates his previous mindsets from 4hw and 4hb into one big set of things everyone should know! Buy it!
0307200477|3.0|My sixteen month old loves the book, especially the peek-a-boo page, but unfortunately the binding of the book came undone within two days.  I put it back together once (it's just the old-fashioned ring style binding) and it was apart again within a couple hours.  I wish the book was bound with a bit more quality, but the book itself is great.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|This was a great cast and a divine movie.  There were some unexpected turns breathtaking scenery and in the end left me with a warm fuzzy feeling and thinking about my own life.  Brilliant!

B0052RDHTM|3.0|I found this Follett book to be average, but an enjoyable read. It is not as suspenseful as some of Follett's previous work, anplot as well as some previous Follett novels, and readers will find it does not carry the development of its plot forward as well as some previous writing, but its is enjoyable.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|\\"Will you promise me that when he makes you sad, you'll think about the sky?\\"<br />\\"The sky is always beautiful. Even when it's dark or rainy or cloudy, it's still beautiful to look at.\\"<br /><br />I had no idea what this book was about when I started reading it. I never bothered to read the description. Colleen Hoover wrote it, nuff said! I started to read some of the reviews others posted and I kind of freaked out that I wasn't gonna get my HEA. I should've known better than to doubt her ability to wow and win me over completely. Which she did!!!<br /><br />\\"I live you.\\"<br /><br />Hopeless was an amazing story. Once I started I couldn't put it down. The storyline was really intense and a lot deeper than her previous books. I'm glad she chose to give Sky a sense of humor. It lightened the load for me as a reader. I fell in love with Sky and Holder! OMG! I loved Holder! Do not pass this one up! It was amazing from beginning to end. It will make you laugh, cry, and fall in love.<br /><br />\\"I'm not allowed to get pregnant this weekend.\\"

B0047WJ12K|4.0|Though a bit overrated by the critics it is nonetheless an intellectually challenging thriller with stunning visual special effects. Friends, especially older ones, had told me that they didn't like it because it was difficult to follow. I not only found it not to be the case but rather easy to follow once you understood the premise. Good entertainment.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|like all the sound options on this app. sleep timer was good. wish I could close it and listen while reading or surfing the web on my kindle fire.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|It was  different, moved right along, a good read it was on a rainy day when I like to read the best.  Just goes to show that  you don't always need a long courtship to make a go marriage. I believe  most people would have some smiles a laughs  with this book.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I read Slammed and POR early this last fall and immediately fell in love with the characters and the heart of the story. I was a little bit nervous to start Hopeless, afraid I wouldn't feel as connected as I did to Will and Lake. I was, thankfully, wrong.<br />Hopeless surpassed all of my expectations. It is a heart swelling, heart sweeping, and heartbreaking tale of love and loss, family and friends, battling past demons, and rebuilding oneself for the future. Put your trust in this author and her ability to wrote to entertain and move you through many of life's sweetest and trying moments.
B00AMBLDEE|2.0|Not as good as Jason Bourne. The movie is too cut up and difficult to follow. Action is ok but I don't think it is up to par with other Bourne movies

Story lines are still good, but seriously, we need to know!

B00004BZ0N|5.0|Joe Strummer has the soul of a poet the prophetic vision of a wiseman  and the knuckle fisted passion of a  rock genius . This remains one of the key albums of their creative ladder . Booming social  polemic immersed with storming guitars and the lyrical delicacy  of  a young Mick Jones. There are so many different influences contained within the one album from the Reggae inspired Rudie Can't fail to the youth rallying Guns of Brixton . Every single song trumpets a feeling this album is 24 karat.

B003G93ZCM|5.0|Having read all the Moonwalkers books, this is by far the most eloquent, well written,realistic and descriptive.  This reads just like a conversation with Eugene Cernan.  I should know, I have had the chance to visit with him.  His descriptions of space flight and lunar experience are so crisp.  Just like you were there.  Not just jet jocky stuff.  This writing is like  a photograph with many pixels.<br />If you just want flight data and dates, read anothers book.  If you want to know what is is like to be in the wonder of space and time, read this one.  If you want to know how it looks from God's front porch read this one.<br /><br />Alan Nelson

0316017930|5.0|&#34;Outliers: The Story of Success&#34; by Malcolm Gladwell is a remarkable, if almost depressing book. In case after case, Gladwell shows how the timing and circumstances of birth determine success, from professional athletes to self-made millionaires.<br /><br />Two examples illuminate Gladwell's thesis: professional hockey players in Canada and high-tech millionaires.<br /><br />In the first instance, Gladwell uses overwhelming statistical proof to show how hockey players born early in the year have a huge advantage over those born towards the end of the year. Why? Because junior Canadian hockey leagues use a calendar year cut-off to determine eligibility rather than ability, size, and experience. This means that a boy of seven who was born January 1 has a year's advantage on a boy born the same year, but on December 31. This chronological advantage is significant at younger ages and results in coaches given extra ice time and attention to the slightly older boys. The extra time on the ice inexorably leads to better performance and thus, the accident of a birth date follows ice hockey player all the way to the professional level.<br /><br />As for those who made their mark on the computing world, such as Bill Gates, Bill Joy, Steve Jobs, Eric Schmidt and others were born mere months apart in the mid-1950's which allowed them to be present at the advent of the computer age as teenagers able to spend hours tinkering with computers and programming before having adult responsibilities. This allowed the young creators of much that defines our modern age to accumulate thousands of hours of experience that propelled them forward to success. If they were born too early, the precursor technology would have been absent--too late, and others would have beaten them to the punch.<br /><br />Gladwell observes that &#34;It is not the brightest who succeed. Nor is success simply the sum of decisions and efforts we make on our behalf.&#34;<br /><br />This statement alone, backed up by meticulously gathered data, is the depressing thrust of the book--until one realizes that, even with Canadian hockey players, there are still a few born late in the year that make it to the professional ranks.<br /><br />Gladwell shows the heavy impact of luck and happenstance, but hard work and talent still have their part to play.<br /><br />Reviewer: Chuck DeVore is a Vice President at the Texas Public Policy Foundation. He served in the California State Assemblyman from 2004 to 2010. Before his election, he was an executive in the aerospace industry. He was a Special Assistant for Foreign Affairs in the Department of Defense from 1986 to 1988. He is a lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Army (retired) Reserve.

078062999X|4.0|I bought this because I enjoy the acting of Kenneth Branagh so much.  He is very good in this but I prefer Shakespear's lighthearted plays more.  Mr Branagh in Much Ado About Nothing is very good. Get an opportunity buy that one. On another tack, Mr Branagh in &#34;How To Kill Your Neighbor;s Dog&#34; is good as well.

B000FC0P9E|5.0|I had low expectations when I started reading this book. I got hooked quickly and could not put it down. I loved this book and it's main character.  I really cared about what happened to her and had to put the book down and walk away when it took a bad turn. It is not a horror story in the classical sense, it is a horror story for the the parents and brother of the little girl and for the main character finding herself desperately lost in the wilderness. I highly recommend this book.
630018224X|5.0|Paul Newman, always good.  Very good plot, keeps you guessing.  I had seen it many years ago and I think I enjoyed itmore this time.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I am not in the mood to write out a full review, I simply wanted to add my five stars to the ratings. However, I will say this... I do a fair amount of reading, perhaps 50-100 books a year, and this book is one that stands out to me. I recommend it to friends that either a) love a unique story, or b) enjoy history of this time period. I was born in 88, so my knowledge about the JFK assassination is limited, but from what I have read, Stephen King did his research and the framework of ideas and scenery that create this book are factually sound. Either way, the book was an enthralling read that I couldn't put down, and one of those books that you wish never ends!
B005HSL626|2.0|this app looked okay if your extremely bored, but it wasn't smurfy at all.well it would only let me slice certain fruit (which was very limited) and there was the same ad every two seconds!!! and it wouldn't let ne unlock any swords.I am extremely unsmurfy today.

B007SGM084|3.0|I was so excited to start reading this. I read reviews on line making fun of how many times words are used in each book and was thinking ok they just dont like the book but they were right. The use of words over and over gets old. The story line gets old fast too. They fight they have sex. They fight they have sex. Really! It's exciting to read at frist but I found the story line to get old fast and was skimming threw lots of pages of the same old stuff.

B008CPZNL6|4.0|This is a great app! It's like your own private magazine full of only the stuff you care about! Facebook, news, Twitter, YouTube, whatever!
B00321SMFO|4.0|My four-star rating is for the series itself, not how it looks on my method of viewing (Amazon Instant on the PS3).  The series is great.  It's a little heavy on the dramatization of predator/prey interactions for my taste, but other than that it's phenomenal.<br /><br />Just a warning, though, don't watch this on Amazon Instant in HD if you expect those stunning visuals everybody talks about.  Close shots and slow shots will indeed be amazing.  Panoramic shots often have visible compression artifacts and anything with many animals or birds has TERRIBLE compression artifacts (squares, blocks, blurring, \\"mosquito noise\\" - basically like a really bad Youtube video).<br /><br />It's not our connection.  The PS3 has priority and I've watched to make sure nothing was interfering - Amazon was delivering video at less than the max rate we could do at the time of day (which is normal).  But the \\"HD\\" stream simply cannot handle a fair number of scenes in this program and it's fairly disappointing.<br /><br />One other nitpick, too - the audio mix is really weird on these episodes.  Voiceovers can be hard to hear and the whole soundtrack has an odd quality to it.<br /><br />We haven't had these issues with Amazon Instant Video on other movies/TV we've watched.  I did send feedback to Amazon.
B0053O89IS|4.0|I love Bones and this is a great season in particular. The only issue I had with it was the price. It's rather expensive for a series with only 13 episodes!
B004H1V5RU|5.0|I cannot say a bad thing about it. No defects or issues with this game. Very fun and a cool decoration.
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|This is a well-written show. It's a creepy concept and there are some disturbing parts throughout the series. If you are easily spooked out and a little on the squeamish side do not buy this.
B008N1V11U|1.0|I paid for this app but when I launch it keeps telling me to free up 395 mb of memory. I deleted just about everything off my kindle fire and I still get the error message. Massive fail

I have tested the premise, and although it has only been a few weeks, I do feel as though I am eating less, although I have never tracked my blood sugars to test the rest.<br /><br />It's an interesting book, and the cookbook coming out to support it should only add to the fervor.
067940581X|5.0|i am an avid jane austen fan and just another one of her books for my collection. one of her more light hearted reads, but just as eloquent and wonderfully written. also, the everyman's library collection of classic literature is a great hardcover, using a very readable text. great buy!
B0034KHFM4|4.0|I am not a big fan of todays music.  Having been a teen during the 1960's, I am more comfortable with early rock.  Saying that, I do like to listen to some of her music to see how far she can push it.  On the other hand my grand daughter knows her lyrics and is happy to sing along.  Just. Not to this album.
B00571F26Y|5.0|I am hoping this book will help change mine and my wifes life style. There is alot of good and also disturbing information in this book. The facts presented show how we are once again fooled into believing that the food we eat is GOOD for us. Thank you Mr Davis for trying to help out in a society where we really do not know what to believe.

B0084BMUFA|5.0|I have always loved this story, there are so many layers to the story and much to learn at any age. My tween daughter is reading and studying it in class and is delving through the layers with much enjoyment as it really stimulates her thinking process. Just a good read as well
B00A80SHFM|3.0|As a long time fan, I expected great things from this recording.  When I heard who was starring in this film production, my expectations went higher.  When I heard that most of the main characters were going to be singing live on-set, well, I lost myself completely!<br /><br />I checked Amazon almost daily for several weeks to find out when this recording would be available.  When it was finally available for pre-order, I ordered right away.  Last night I received a message saying it had shipped with a delivery date of tomorrow.  I was excited beyond compare when it arrived TODAY!  I tore the packaging open and loaded the disc into the player.  I was near tears waiting the few seconds for it to start up.<br /><br />The orchestrations for this film version are spectacular!  And then it goes awry.  There are almost always changes to the lyrics between stage and screen.  Most of the time those changes disrupt the songs and create a disjointed experience.  See Phantom Of The Opera for a good example.  The changes to the lyrics made here will throw the devoted fan off, as they are trying to sing along, but will go un-noticed by the casual fan.  I was not disappointed with the lyric changes, over-all.  There is a new song added for Valjean, Suddenly.  This song, almost, fits, but not quite.  I'm not sure why they added it.  It doesn't seem to further the story any.<br /><br />Without having seen the movie yet, I can only base the following on what I feel from the recording.  This recording leaves me saying, \\"eh\\".  The stars that I was expecting to blow me away with their performances, sound bored or maybe just over-medicated.  Jackman as Valjean should have been spectacular.  Sadly he did not bring his A-game to his songs.  He sounds like he's tired and singing in the middle of the night while trying not to wake anyone else in the house, up.  Hathaway's performance of I Dreamed A Dream, a song which should have the audience in tears, didn't rouse so much as a sniffle.  Crowe's vocal performance, as Javert, is that of someone who was given voice lessons during rehearsals so that he could at least pretend to be singing; it's more like melodic talking.  Carter and Cohen should have been spectacular as the Thenardier's.  It sounds like they're whispering the entire song, Master Of The House, which should be big and bawdy.<br /><br />While listening to the London or Broadway cast recordings, you get chills, excitement, tears.  With this recording, you get none of that.  I am sincerely let down with this recording.  I hope when I see the film on Christmas Eve that my opinion will change as I see these songs performed in the context of the surrounding scenes.<br /><br />If you're a devoted fan of Les Mis, as I am, go ahead and spend the money so you have a complete collection of recordings.  ;)  If you're a casual fan or just a fan of some of the actors, see the film first and decide whether to spend the money on this.<br /><br />Update:  I saw the movie last night.  The issues I had with the volume of the voices on this recording make sense when viewed in the context of the filmed scene.  I thought my opinion would change regarding the emotional impact of the songs; it did not.  I left the theater with no emotional investment at all.  Once again, I was sorely let down by the film version of a stage musical.  Seeing Crowe sing is even more painful than listening to him sing.  The new song, Suddenly, does in fact help the storyline.  However, the melody just doesn't quite \\"fit\\" with the rest of the show.  We saw this with the additional songs in Dreamgirls; great songs, they just didn't \\"fit\\" musically\\".  Some songs were truncated for the timing of the movie, so I'm hoping that when they release a full soundtrack, the full songs are included and not the truncated versions.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I REALLY ENJOYED PLAYING THIS GAME! It had good graphics, I always enjoy games by this company! I would recommend this game, it's full of hidden object fun! and had a good story line, and was very interactive. Once again good work!

067101756X|5.0|This book was very entertaining.  If you enjoy watching Ancient Aliens on the History Channel or want to know more about the military's secret, this is the book to read.  I was hooked and could not stop reading.  The author, Col. Corso, explains why the government is hiding UFO information from the public, how there is a government within a government, ET's are a threat to our planet, etc.  His interviews can be view on YouTube for more info.  I like to keep an opened mind on everything (today's consumer products may originate from the 1947 Roswell crash).  Military locations in the book are real.  If this book is based off of real facts.....hmmmm...
B000YHG72E|5.0|It's a goofy, stupid movie. But it's funny, and not particularly vulgar. And I really enjoy watching this every year.
B003R4ZMNQ|5.0|I love Hawaii Five-0. Being from Oahu, I love how they show real places for example beaches as they are, restaurants and even local shops. I even like how they talk &#34;pigeon&#34; (local hawaii slang) because it gives its viewers the real since of Hawaii, instead of the touristy version. The episodes are so engaging, I am literally not able to unglue my eyes from the television. I can't wait to collect all the seasons.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|This a sweet love story with a quirky sense of humor. Wes Anderson captured the essence of the late 60's.

B004I2K4DY|4.0|It is difficult to follow the story in this edition. The screen above the actors had some images pictured on it thru-out the performance that would have helped explain the storyline, however it is rarely seen. If you are new to the musical, I suggest the 10th Anniversary edition, which has scene subtitles, or seeing it live first.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this app it is so addictive I would play this all day long if I could my little twin cousins fight over it like? who got farther and what color coins they got to

B004YM6JLO|5.0|Every season I say 'This is my favorite season. How can they out-do themselves?' And every season The Vampire Diaries gets better and more surprising! This show is exciting, suspenseful, romantic, and absolutely addictive. Watch it. If you are on the fence about buying the series, go ahead and buy it...you won't regret it.
B00AAQVSDW|5.0|Great mix of country with a little bit of rock. I usually listen to new country and after seeing these guys in concert Imax huge fan!
B004JN1D2I|4.0|Really enjoying the books! Well written and deep characters. You keep wanting more. I would recommend to anyone who enjoys fantasy, and doesnt mind some coarse language.
B00AJRQLTI|2.0|First off, I am reviewing the soundtrack, not the movie.  As a soundtrack, the director's decision to record the vocals on the set doesn't work for me as a soundtrack.  It may work perfectly fine in the movie and some early reviews suggest it does, but I find the sound effects in some of the scenes interfering with the songs. And the sobbing Fantine and dying Valjean sound odd worked into their numbers. Again might strike the perfect note in the film, but as music it doesn't work for me. At times it also seems that the music that was later recorded to go with the vocals doesn't sync up quite right or doesn't have the correct tone with what the actor's voice is doing. For me, it really isn't until track 11, that most of the songs really start to improve.<br /><br />There are some decisions that seem curious to me. Jackman has done theater for years, the man can sing. But it's either the arrangements or the key they had him sing in, too many of the songs seem flat or strained to me. \\"Bring him Home\\" should be a big emotional number, but it sounds like Hugh is trying to bellow it out. Obviously other actors Colm Wilkinson (*fangirl gush*) have played Valjean and had success, I think the vocals should have been better adapted to what Jackman can do.<br />And Crowe isn't good, there's no way around it. Javert's solo songs are two of the strongest numbers and really portray who the man thinks he and Valjean are. Javert and Valjean's songs together should be strong, emotional back and forths between the actors. But Crowe's singing just isn't up to snuff.<br /><br />Some of the soundtrack is fine, not comparable to past albums, but when Eponine and Marius meet is when the soundtrack pulls together for some numbers. If you want to a little different take on the Les Mis music, go ahead and try it out. I'd recommend listening to the soundtrack on MOG or Spotify first before deciding to buy though. Some reviewers like the album, I am not one of them.
B009GEYX5E|4.0|I'm new to photography so I wanted to see what I was taking pictures of immediately after doing it. However, I really don't like digital. Thank god for polaroids. This film seems to work fine. Someone with more experience could probably coax better colors out of it.

B0085P2Z6E|4.0|I got this as a FAOTD, and thought I'd try it. Entertaining and a good way to pass the time.
B000NQRE9Q|4.0|The four films in Steven Spielberg's (and George Lucas') \\"Indiana Jones\\" quartet of movies arrive on Blu-ray in extremely sharp and nice looking presentations.<br /><br />The quality for all four films varies a bit as they were shot over the course of a long period of time and film stocks changed with time as well. This results in a film like \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\" looking quite grainy at the beginning while \\"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\\" shot three years later looks a lot \\"cleaner\\" when it comes to film grain. Colors for all three films pop and detail is remarkably sharp particularly during some of the darker sequences which, when they were transferred to DVD, required tha the contrast be dialed down a bit. Ironically, as we proceed through the series of films the image quality improves signficantly while the films themselves aren't necessarily better with each installment.<br /><br />Of the four films in the set the first and third are (generally) thought to be the best of the series. While that may be true, none of these films are bad (the fourth film \\"Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull\\" despite its lukewarm reception is better than a lot of people give it credit for although it isn't a classic in the same manner as \\"Raiders\\" or \\"Last Crusade\\").<br /><br />The packaging for this set is less than ideal. Although using book-style packaging was a clever idea, the discs slip into very tight cardboard pages that could result in scratching to the discs. Each movie receives its own \\"pages\\" with images of the posters for each film and still images.<br /><br />\\"Raiders\\" benefits from a terrific, witty script from Lawrence Kasdan and inspired direction by Steven Spielberg who was in his prime during this period. Terrific performances from Harrison Ford, Karen Allen, Paul Freeman and John Rhys-Davies compliment the well designed action sequences.<br /><br />\\"Raiders\\" introduces us to Indiana Jones (Ford) an archeologist who races to find the Ark of the Covenant before his foe Belloq (Freeman) who is working for the Nazi's. It seems that Hitler wants to use the Ark to unleash the power of God on his foes.<br /><br />\\"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\\" is set before \\"Raiders\\" (even though it was shot and released after \\"Raiders)and finds Indy battling the Thuggee cult in India. The cult has stolen three sacred stones and is kidnapping the children from local villages forcing them to work the mines.<br /><br />\\"Temple of Doom\\" received a decidely mixed reception when it was released in 1984 due to the violence which resulted in the creation of the PG-13 rating. The opening sequence with its clever musical number is much stronger than the rest of the film. The script isn't as clever nor as witty as \\"Raiders\\" and many of the roles (particularly that of Willie Scott an annoying love interest who whines, screams and is unappealing throughout the film)are underwritten or poorly developed. Jonathan Ke Quan as Short Round is a highlight but the rest of the supporting cast from \\"Raiders\\" is sorely missed.<br /><br />\\"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\\" benefited from a very good script written by Jeffrey Boam (the TV show \\"Brisco County Jr.\\", \\"Lethal Weapon 3\\"). Although not quite as strong as \\"Raiders\\", the performances of Sean Connery as Indy's dad and the late River Phoenix as a young Indiana during the opening sequence as well as the return of the late Denholm Elliot and John Rhys-Davies in supporting roles helped elevate the film. Spielberg's direction throughout is as energetic as the first film and the flaws that dogged the second film aren't in evidence here.<br /><br />\\"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\\" isn't as bad as its reputation and, although flawed in a number of ways (particularly with the casting of Shia LaBouf as Indy and Marion's son), the supporting cast is terrific and it's nice that Karen Allen returns to the series to give some closure to the relationship between Indy and Marion from the first film. Cate Blanchett gives a terrific performance as the \\"bad guy\\" Irina Spalko. It's a pity it took nearly 20 years to make this sequel (Lucas was preoccupied with making his \\"Star Wars\\" prequels and then turned down a number of scripts including one written by Frank Darabont best known for \\"The Walking Dead\\", \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\", \\"The Green Mile\\" )but, despite the dramatic flaws of the script, many of the action sequences compare favorably to those from the first and third films.<br /><br />\\"Crystal Skull\\" finds Indy trying to discover the secret of the crystal skull which seem to have supernatural power before Soviet agent Irina Spalko (Blanchett)can discover them. Set against the backdrop of the Cold War, Indy finds himself uncertain who his allies are including his long time friend Mac (Ray Winstone) and who his enemies are as he travels to South America to uncover the origin of the mysterious artifacts.<br /><br />The special features include teaser and theatrical trailers for all three films (no commentary tracks--Spielberg doesn't believe in them)with the rest of the special features isolated to the last disc of the set.<br /><br />\\"On Set with 'Raiders of the Lost Ark'\\" includes behind-the-scenes footage, outtakes and deleted scenes for the film. It includes candid interviews from the time. The behind-the-scenes footage was shot on 16mm and is presented full frame. The 58 minute documentary is broken down into two sections.<br /><br />We also get the behind-the-scenes documentaries ported over from the previous boxed set. These are a number of featurettes on all three films included from the previous boxed set. Not all of these are presented in 1080p.<br /><br />If you are fans of \\"Crystal Skull\\" you should be aware that the extras on the second disc are, for the most part, missing from this set. We do get brief featurettes on the visual effects for the fourth film as well as two featurettes on the props and the post production on the film.<br /><br />Although the quality of the films vary quite a bit, all four of the Indiana Jones films are worthwhile (yes, even the dreaded \\"Crystal Skull\\"). Let's hope that if Lucas and Spielberg decide to return to make another Indiana Jones fil that they'll recall what made the first and third films so much fun.<br /><br />Recommended.rst film.

B000FC1AGG|1.0|This frequently happens when I read a Sophie Kinsella/Madeline Wickham book. Our heroine has some pretty outrageous things happen but always comes out on top. I really enjoyed the story.
0131480057|5.0|I bought the paperback version of this book two weeks ago, and just got around to start using it.<br /><br />Today I discovered that the entire Chapter 10 on Backups (pages 289 through 336) is missing! I've never seen that in a book before. And the pages are missing, not out of order or elsewhere in the book.<br /><br />So if you're ordering this book to learn to do backups, DON'T!<br /><br />I'm going to notify Amazon, but reordering it won't do any good if the entire printing is the same.<br /><br />UPDATE - I did order a replacement and Amazon shipped it out free with 1-day shipping. Great customer service! Even better, Chapter 10 IS IN the replacement book, complete. So, my assumption that the chapter was missing from an entire press run was premature. Honestly, I couldn't imagine how one chapter of a book could be left out of a single volume. But apparently it was. My bad.<br /><br />I should add that so far I like what I've read. It seems very complete. I have changed my rating to 5-star.
B006LRUVUA|5.0|This is great software. I use the free version for supporting my family's computers and have gone ahead and bought the commercial license for training remote employees at work. This is good stuff.
0547884591|5.0|Wow this book is incredible!  Just got it and went through the beginning and meta portions.  The thing that's impacted me the most so far is the application of the 80/20 principle to learning.  He touched on this slightly in terms of language in the 4HWW, but then shows how the 80/20 principle can apply to anything you learn.<br /><br />Many, to be honest probably most, of the things covered in this book, and made simpler through Tim's advice; are things I never saw myself as being able to do.  I never thought I'd be a great cook, I'm a horrible swimmer, and I speak some variations of Spanglish.  Armed with this book, I'm confident I can quickly learn, and to some degree master skills that take years, in a matter of months.<br /><br />What I love about Tim's writing style the most is that he uses examples and explains every point that he makes in the book.  This is not theory, this is information Tim has acquired by being in the trenches and learning how to do these tasks himself.<br /><br />4HWW changed how I look at my business, and has freed up an almost unlimited amount of time for me.  Armed with 4HC I can now pursue and master my different passions in record time, as well as learn new things I never thought possible.<br /><br />Thanks Tim!  And if you have even more to teach us down the road, I'd be thrilled to buy another book of yours!
B009E3EY38|5.0|as far as i'm concerned Plant is a sadist, that holds we, the fans, in little regard. however, after the five year wait, i left a completely satisfied customer. i would surely pay a princely sum to actually see them live
B000AYEL6U|5.0|It is very hard to ever be satisfied with film versions of a book you love, and have re-read so many times over the years.  Of course I had pictured every face and place differently.  I agree that Thornton was cast perfectly.  This adaptation stayed true to the book, except for the ending scene.  I do prefer the book's - more subtle, but more intense at the same time.<br /><br />The story is very similar to Pride and Prejudice, except she seems to have all the pride and the prejudice. However, it tells so much more about what was going on at the time and has a good storyline going on with other characters.  I would call this more of a historical fiction, as it tells about the industry and strikes, and P&P (which I do love, as well)more of a classical romance story.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Made me laugh I loved it. I loved all the diary of a wimpy kid books. There's never been a more funny  book!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000KKPN5C|2.0|I've had this flash for over a year and it is definitely a step above the built in flash, albeit just one step. The main advantages is that its raised slightly higher than the built in to reduce red-eye and it tilts.<br /><br />My gripe on this flash is that it stopped working a a few months after it's 1 year warranty ran out, which happens to be the weekend right before Christmas. So I'm a little more annoyed than usual.<br /><br />I can't say with 100% certainty that its the flash, but I'm 95% sure. It has fresh batteries, the red ready light is on, the camera recognizes I have a flash attached when I check the menu on my d5000. The built-in flash fires fine. All this indicates the camera is working, but the flash will not fire.<br /><br />Because I'm past the 1 year warranty, to fix the flash will cost $83 according to Nikon's support page, which is almost the cost of what I paid for this SB-400.<br /><br />If the flash was working, I would give it 4 stars just because it does what its made for without a lot of the extras you'd get from more expensive flashes. But now that its quit on me in such a short time and with minimal usage, i'm giving it a much lower score.<br /><br />This, sadly, is the first time I've been disappointed with a Nikon product.
B004EK926K|5.0|This rendering of A Christmas Carol is amazing: intense, humorous, thoughtful, heart wrenching, whimsical, and even a little creepy at times. . .just about everything you could ask for. The cast is outstanding and the acting ability and many voices of Jim Cary are spot on. The use of CG detail is incredible and gives a look into Dickins' story like no other. A little too intense for young children.
B00AB0AR2U|1.0|The rental video does not work?! I have been trying to make it work for three days it just does not load. I have excellent internet connection and all my other movies work through Amazon except this one. It is getting frustrating!
0345803493|5.0|these books were very well written. I couldnt put them down. I cant wait for the movie to come out.
B005ZMTXMY|5.0|Pixar is not afraid to make you cry... within the first 10 minutes... without using words. A great movie to watch anytime.
B00319ECC4|5.0|Nothing will ever beat Demanufacture, but this is probably the closest overall album to it! It is a pretty solid album all around.
B007H7XJD4|4.0|I rented this (it is on netflix now) and it was worth. The story is so so but the visuals totally make up for it.
0786962984|5.0|What can you say about Dungeon! If you love the game, you'll love this edition. The monster cards could be thicker and the pictures of the monsters bigger, and hopefully they will sell an upgrade, because everything else is awesome. The board and cardstock counters are rich in color and are the thickest I've ever seen.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is a great and challenging time waister!  Quick and simple anyone can play!  Try it you will love it and so will your kids!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. Flubbles, golly! It was so good. Definitely better than that 50 shades crap. It was the perfect extension to Bared to You, because you get to find out so much more about Gideon's life.  I can't wait until the next book. (:
B009YG2ND8|5.0|It has had me captivated for days. I have played many other FF games, this is my first time playing 3. The story on 3 isn't as good as 7 or 10 but it isn't bad. The gameplay and the job system make it the best rpg I have found. Plays amazingly well on the kindle fire hd 8.9.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|I have had this app for almost a year with no problems.  About a week ago it stopped working and I am getting an error in the silk browser.  This is causing another problem.  I can't open the browser anymore by clicking on the Web link because it is still trying to open the facebook page when the browser tries to open.  I see no way to clear the browser with resetting my Kindle Fire to its default settings.  Bad app Facebook.  Bad design on the browser Amazon.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|What a great sci-fi story! Hugh's writing style makes it hard to put the book down. Very interesting premise and plenty of mysteries to be unraveled. Book 1 was a great story but the end was a bit predictable. Still a poetic ending. But don't worry even if the ending wasn't a surprise this series is just getting started. It just builds and builds and every book gets better!
B007SGLZP8|3.0|While I enjoyed the beginning of this book, the last half just seemed to drag with Grisham's detailed and often repetitive accounts of the movement of the main character. I prefer reading a book that draws me back to it to see what will happen next, and this book just didn't do that.<br />Talking with a friend in my book club revealed the same sentiment with her. This just isn't one of Grisham's best efforts.
B003Y5H574|5.0|It arrived before its due time! Order if your someone who enjoys romantic comedies. A must see!:) I am very pleased
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|This cable was a replacement for a defective cable that self-destructed. Amazon's great customer service sent this replacement as soon as I called about the old cable, which was falling apart. This cable works fine. Now I can charge my Kindle again! The real test of a company comes when there's a problem, and Amazon passed with top grades.
B005LAIH4A|2.0|The movie starts slowly and died in the middle but the plot was okay. The ending is not thought out very well it just leaves you saying is that it. The Lorax wasn't in the movie long enough and it was sort of a musical with awful auto-tune.
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|The only thing wrong with this wonderful offering is that it is only 6 songs. I can't stop listening. I never saw The Sing Off, but I can tell why they won. Pure, clean voices singing classic holiday songs. A must have for every Christmas music collection.
0307269752|4.0|It's hard not to enjoy the book and its main character. Very detailed and meticulously done, engrossing and well written story.
0446614459|4.0|This is actually a surprise as I initially picked it up for a trashy (in a good way) holiday read and found myself unable to put it down.  Great characters, well linked across the differing times of the story threads and although a few clues and some guesses on my part was mainly left open right until the end and with an end that made sense without having to be explained in great detail.<br /><br />Fast action, great characters... read it.  Far more readable than your usual crime thriller.
1608871452|5.0|As soon as I heard this book was in the works, I was excited! A hardback coffee table sized Supernatural guide book?? YES. PLEASE. This thing is huge! The jacket is removable and the book itself has a very cool leather book-like hard cover. It has a ton of full color high quality photographs and illustrations, many of which have never been featured in the magazines or season guides. It goes into enormous detail on the aired seasons (1-7 and even a bit on 8!), and includes character biographies, creature guides and actor and crew interviews.<br /><br />One thing that could have been very cool if done a bit better were the various pull out inserts. Throughout the book, there are post card sized photos that look like they're meant to be pulled out and displayed, but are glued down so well that they end up ripping the page they're attached to if you try to remove them. They cover some blocks of text and other photos, but they're only glued down on one corner, so they're easily lifted up out of the way so you can read what's underneath. Just don't try to pry them up completely or you'll ruin the page. The book also features these really cool pouches that have all sorts of goodies in them, from the covers of the Supernatural books written by Chuck to a road map of the US marked with important Supernatural landmarks. There was even a page of stickers, which I'll admit I squealed a little bit over.<br /><br />All in all, this book is TOTALLY worth the price. It would make the perfect gift for any fan of the show or a great indulgent treat for yourself. I'm planning on buying copies of this for my friends now that I see how cool it is!
B009TZBEKW|5.0|I've been going on a CD buying rampage over the last month - even though I use Spotify!  However, I don't use Spotify premium. One thing Spotify has allowed me to do is to listen to a full album of an artist I'm interested in for a while.  This allows me to \\"try\\" the CD.  when i really like the CD as a whole and get tired of the spotify ads, I've decided to buy the CD.  I bought Drake, Frank Ocean, and now Calvin Harris.  I think 80% of this CD plays well with good flow.  It's catchy, with good beats, uplifting, and positive.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Book one of the triology is interesting but you need to get a good portion into the book before a real storyline gets interesting.  It is a very erotic book and leaves nothing to the imagination.<br />This book and the 2 other books is definitely an adult book.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I loved, loved, loved reading this book - I'm not sure how to describe this without giving away a lot of the story and plot but once I started, i couldn't put it down.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|The second book is much more sexually explidit.  The storyline continues and gets better as you read.  By the 3rd book everything falls into place.  These 3 books were definitely hard to put down.  It certainly opens your eyes to a different type of lifestyle!
B000SEGUDE|5.0|At first, reading the first section you wonder, what is this? But as it skips from voice to voice and through time you get so involved in the various personal stories...and then you're interrupted but it begins to make sense as you read. It's a great storytelling and yes, it has a deeper message but doesn't pummel you with it. I love the characters and the ways each of them extricate themselves from their situations.
0634049011|4.0|the book explains exverything you need to know about the guitar. it is a great books for every guitar players
B009IQ0TGM|4.0|I love the Anything Could Happen song, haven't listened to the whole CD yet, but it seems very nice.  It's a nice change from normal pop.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|This app is wretched! If I could give it a rate it would be -1 star. Booooooo! It's annoying to not be able to use it.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|Now, one must note that this is a highlights soundtrack. Many songs are left out (\\"Do You Hear the People Sing?\\", \\"A Little Fall of Rain\\", \\"Lovely Ladies\\", and \\"Fantine's Arrest\\" to name them off the top of my head), just look at the track listing. I'm guessing once the movie does well, which I have no doubt that it will, they will release a complete. They did the same thing with the movie version of \\"Sweeney Todd\\".<br /><br />As a die-hard fan of the musical, it is hard not to compare the versions in my head, but that isn't far to the actors. You have to keep in mind that they are acting as well as singing the songs and that they did every take live. No polishing in the studios. Yes, they did change some lyrics and added a song \\"Suddenly\\", but I enjoyed the changes, even though I love the original.<br /><br />SPOILER! SPOILER!<br /><br />Eponine no longer sings in the Epilogue, it's just Anne Hathaway (Fantine) and she does a beautiful job.<br /><br />I would like to correct a review that said Anne Hathaway and Hugh Jackman aren't trained singers. That's wrong. They both trained for the stage before they got into film. Along with Eddie Redmayne (Marius), Aaron Tveit (Enjorlas), and Samantha Barks (Eponine) they are the best voices on the soundtrack.<br /><br />Unlike many reviews that are saying Russell Crowe butchers his songs, I would disagree. Now, his voice is no Philip Quast, but he is acting the songs properly. He succeeded my expectations as a singer and held his own during \\"One Day More\\".<br /><br />Amanda Seyfried could be much stronger, but that was to be expected.<br /><br />If you're not crying during \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" and \\"Empty Chairs at Empty Tables\\", then I guess you have no soul. The true sadness in those songs is really brought to light by the actors.<br /><br />Overall, once you see the movie, the soundtrack will make more sense. I enjoyed it without seeing it, but I would say see the film first so that you can see how it's acted out.<br /><br/>I'm glad to have the highlights and I can't wait for them to release a complete so I can hear more Anne Hathaway.<br /><br />This die-hard is satisfied and excited for the film!
B0084U0IEG|5.0|McEwan successfully employs several ingenious literary tricks that display his many talents but are also readable in themselves and useful in defining the characters.  The story gripped me from start to finish.
B008AU7F3C|3.0|I liked her last album 'Two Suns' a lot, I still listen to it. So, I bought this one, by the first time I listened to it, I though it was half great, half 'ok'. From start ('Lilies') 'till 'Laura' it is great, those songs are great, maybe just a little bit over-produced for me. The rest of the album seems to me forced (desperate), as if they tried to fill the album even if they knew it didn't fit quite well. From this part part of the album I didn't remember any song after a few plays of the album.<br />I've read somewhere that Natasha was out of inspiration in the process of making this album, maybe she should have waited a little bit more?.<br />Overall it is a good album, though I can't listen to the album as a whole, instead I listen to it as side A and B. I'll keep listening to it, hoping maybe I'll completely get it.<br />I mean I still love her voice, I think she's great!.
B000YHG72E|4.0|Elf is a funny movie you'd like if you're into Will Ferrell humor. It's a must see and I watch it every year because it's ridiculous and funny.

B009SQQRH2|5.0|This movie was hilarious. It kept me, my husband, and our two 6 year old boys very entertained...and even made me and my husband tear up remembering our childhood and that magical feeling of Christmas and Santa!
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|WOW. Amazing. Truly a lesson for people to learn. Ages 11-17, kind of mature content. But certainly not inappropriate. Just not a bedtime read for a 5 yr old. Thick read, 316 pages. But again, amazing.<br />Wonder,<br />August.<br />Wonder.
1419705849|5.0|Loved this one as much as the others. Read it very quickly.  Definitely recommended for others that like these series.
B008673ZAQ|3.0|I like the first book more. The story is good but takes some weird turns in the second book that I wasn't a fan of. I can't wait to read the third installment to see what happens though. I guess that means this is an attention getter and keeps it interesting enough to want to read more.
B006Z7Z3R2|4.0|sara paxton is just too adorable in the lead role. she carries the film and its a very interesting thriller given how tame it is. see theres not a lot of blood or gore at all, but the setting is incredible and the actors really make the movie charming.  ti west is one of my fave new directors because he favors atmosphere and story just like in House Of The Devil. these are like little campfire tales come to life. the ending i had to watch a few times, look closely or you might miss it. i did.<br />if you like spooky stories well told in a whimsical way, you will love this. but if your expecting gore galore, your gonna be disappointed.<br />i loved it. im surprised its not rated pg-13 though.  to me, its not scary at all. but the characters really are endearing and just well developed. ill take that over gore anyday.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I won't spoil anything!! It is wonderfully written and has you on the edge of your seat. I could not put it down. Not bad for a teenager or adult to read. I will be reading this one again really soon. The characters are so well written you can picture them in your mind and grow to love/hate them so easily. You get a rel feeling for them right away and know where they are coming from.
B004SRNH10|1.0|This product would not load to my device. I tried from every browser choice that was given to me, but, nothing. I thought it was my device but everything else loaded, so...
B00846REIS|4.0|It was a bit like Shades of Grey but it had a good plot and kept me interested. This is NOT a book for the faint of heart. The scenes are pretty graphic and the language is vulgar. That's why I like it though. The story has some predictable points but it makes up for that with the writing. Very descriptive and vivid.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|VERY addictive and fun puzzle game. Worth the money. I thought I would just try this game to kill some time and now I can't seem to put it down.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|Same energy of old times! If you're a Led Zeppelin's fan this is definitely a must have DVD/CD!<br />Wonderful! Gorgeous! Amazing!!!
B0099114WO|5.0|This movie was a great movie for all adults. But certainly for those of us who are way over 50. It has a good feel and laugh reflex. My husband stated it was the best movie he had seen in  a while.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|A heart moving,delicate, and precious real story about the unique and indestructible bond between dogs and their human friends.It moved me deeply....

B00992CF6W|3.0|this game is cool and stupid at the same time. I can build cool things on it but then at different times they just disappear.It should also have minevarts to build roller coasters.
B000TGJ8AS|5.0|We've been giving our sister a season of this TV series each year at Christmas, and this is just another wonderful addition to it! NCIS is a great show and continues to exceed our expectations.

B00ADS98FC|1.0|Shallow, gimicky characters, bad acting and a predictable plot. The fake vomit scenes are inexcusable, failing to ad even shock value. Terrible all around.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|The Ridley Scott film set of the classic horror film is a great set.  All four of the films are included.  It could only be improved should the films be converted into 3D.
B0098VYCCE|5.0|I was told repeatedly to watch this movie and when I finally did, it was completely worth it. I thought I would hate Kristen Stewart in it, but this movie is the best she has ever looked. I recommend this movie to everyone.
B008518MOW|5.0|Though not the best film in the series, it is a nice presentation and even better with the 3D disc added in.
B009HV2JT8|3.0|I had no hope whatsoever for this movie and it surprised me. The storyline goes a little fast, but the fight scenes aren't bad and neither is the acting. Overall, this movie is alright considering what it is about.
B0055EAJ7A|5.0|A very good film with great graphics for the Avengers series.  Very impressive scenery and cast.  Definitely worth the investment for the home collection.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I loved the book I couldn't put it down now I want to read more to find out what happens
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Yeap, you did it again!  It's official, John Grisham is on the top 5 list of my favorite authors.  Loved this book.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This story was very well written and thought out. I usually steer clear of stories like this because I have teenagers and they scare the daylights out of me. I am not sorry that I read this book but I will say that it will stay with me for a long time. Very thought provoking...

B008F9E306|4.0|T.I is one of the greatest to ever touch a microphone in hip hop. I have been a dedicated fan since day one. This album is yet another edition to a legendary career. One of the reasons the south dominant rap now is because of artists like Tip. I love this album because of his always amazing flow, witty word play and brutal honesty. He is one of the last real rap guys left in this watered down rap scene. I have been waiting for this record a long time. I'm extremely happy that T.I kept it trap Muzak gully on this one too! He already been showed he got billboard chart hits in his catalog of hit albums. The trap back jumping baby! Salute the one and only king of the south! T.I.P. '

B007IXWL2C|3.0|OK ...read these books because of all the media hype thinking they would be a hotter than usual romance.  Well, yes hotter....also really twisted and completely not a 3 book deal.  Like other &#34;series&#34; books out there today, the whole story could have been included in one well edited book.  I realize publishers like the upcoming books for profit but as a reader I feel sucked in and short changed.  I look for that now and don't read series books.  Respect the reader.<br /><br />Also, after getting to the 3rd book I was totally desensitized to the whole bondage thing.  Who are these people? This innocent girl happens upon a damaged rich dude and suddenly just falls into this lifestyle?  Uhh ….no!  This would not happen.  Do you really think a guy who installs a “RED ROOM OF PAIN” is going to be satisfied stopping at the sedate toys he shares with Anastasia?  I don't think any of those who partake in this particular sideshow would be content to halt where he did.  After some online research I found they do some really out there stuff to get their cookies off.  There are actual pictures and it does not look pleasant to say the least.  If you need that kind of pain, shame, suffering, and degradation to rock your world, maybe some intense psychiatric inpatient work is the direction you should be headed in.<br /><br />The author says she is not a great writer...well hello...I agree.  Get a thesaurus!  Think of new words to describe an orgasm.  And while that is on the table, how many can a guy have a day anyway?  I understand the male anatomy pretty well and one does not just get it up and go again immediately after the act.  Young readers will be really surprised when that fails to happen for them.  An experienced lover of Mr. Grey’s magnitude should be able to satisfy his partner so well the first time that rapid fire encores would not be necessary.<br /><br />It was unbelievable at best but so are most books of this genre.  Overall , entertained for a bit, erotic parts stimulating but the fill-time banter and farfetched copulation everywhere  became tiring,( i.e. the car sex in the tiny sports car, in a parking lot, in the daytime, immediately following a car chase by someone trying to kill you???????) Who does this?  Nobody!!  But then again, no one sleeps with vampires while their frustrated would-be -wolf –lover seethes with jealousy and no one finds true love while dodging fireballs with a bow and arrow either.  So ….in short, borrow it from a friend or the library and stop making bad writers rich when really good ones can’t get published.

B002MW50KO|4.0|I could never get past Bob's vocal gimmick in songs like \\"Inside Of Mobile With The Memphis Blues Again,\\" where he does that goofy upward hook at the end of every line, and then his incomprehensibly wasted phase, but here his voice sounds raspy and bluesy instead of just drunk. Generally I could deal with Dylan only when sung by other people, so I can't believe I'm enjoying other people's songs sung by Dylan! Not sure if it's because of Bob or in spite of him that this works, but I'm recommending it. (That said, I admit I'm getting a big kick out of others' pans of this, and they have some valid points.)<br /><br />The first thing you will think is, \\"Why?? This is some kind of joke, right?\\" But after a few listens I am convinced that he's playing it straight. Just look at the picture on the cover. Like something from Norman Rockwell.<br /><br />The even more polka'd up take on Brave Combo's inspired arrangement of \\"It Must Be Santa\\" is a delight, and I have no need to search for a better version of that. He actually did a video for this - check it out because it's very fun. I think he looks better with that mop on his head than he's looked all his life. My second favorites here are \\"Christmas Blues\\" and \\"Little Drummer Boy.\\" The latter is done the way I like it - in a male voice...with drums! Dylan somehow seems to have changed his voice on this track - it sounds smoother, and I think I would even count this among my favorite versions of the song.<br /><br />I think I can hear ice clinking in a drink during \\"Christmas Blues,\\" and at one point in \\"O Come All Ye Faithful\\" it sounds like he's gargling phlegm, but I guess if Bob Dylan doesn't want to do another take, no one can make him. But he really does sound like he's trying for once.<br /><br />Why would he do this? I think that Bob just has a genuine, sincere wish for you and yours to have a good Christmas.

1593082800|5.0|Wilkie Collins' explosive novel, The Woman in White, is a Victorian-era thrill ride for modern readers. Hailed as the first detective novel and an exemplary paradigm of sensationalist literature, it has certainly earned its reputation among the classics of nineteenth-century fiction. The Woman in White is related to the reader via an epistolary format, with various narratives. Although this inevitably calls into question each speaker's veracity, it transforms the novel into a well-rounded legal deposition. The opening line, \\"This is the story of what a Woman's patience can endure, and of what a Man's resolution can achieve,\\" provides a concise summary of what follows.<br /><br />Walter Hartright, a humble drawing-master, attains employment at Limmeridge House, where he meets two sisters, Marian Halcombe and Laura Fairlie. His fate becomes entwined with theirs by the mysterious woman in white and the inauspicious events which ensue. Although the first half of the novel develops at a more measured pace, the climax and denouement are sure to keep the reader enthralled. Collins constructs an intricate plot with a constant flux of twists and turns as an enigmatic and seemingly unfathomable mystery unfolds.<br /><br />Themes such as romance, insanity, and appearance vs. reality contribute to the enduring legacy of the novel. The overriding, multilayered thematic element of light vs. dark creates a chiaroscuro overtone that enhances The Woman in White's captivating reading experience. Throughout the novel, Collins weaves a tapestry of intrigue that requires every stitch to be examined and counted.

B003EI2EH2|4.0|This book gives a very simple somewhat low carb diet, more similar to South Beach than Atkins, plus exercises and other tips, some of which are superb and some of which are bizarre. I know from my own experience that the diet works, so there is nothing wrong with it. The thing that makes me give a four-star rather than a five-star review is the poor organization and disjointed nature of the writing. The book gives the impression of having been dashed off in a hurry, and not edited or re-written. The big plus about the diet is that the dieter gets a cheat day every seven days.  Of course, you will not lose weight as quickly doing this, but I suspect that it makes it easier to continue the diet for a long time.  I lost 90 pounds on Atkins, and have kept it off, but the prospect of being as pure as Dr. Atkins would like for the rest of my life is daunting. I think going a week without a morsel of bread will be easier if you know that on the seventh day that you can have a cheeseburger, a Beef Wellington, a pizza or bread pudding or all of them if you want them.<br />  Mr. Ferriss experiments on himself, trying this thing and that, buying expensive equipment, paying for expensive and time-consuming tests, and coming to conclusions based on those experiments that he then passes on to the reader. I would like to see how a woman would handle this diet. The reliance on legumes would make me be sure to stock up on Beano before starting it, and gas is more easily excused in men than in women. The author is a single man, and I think that it would be difficult for someone in a relationship to be as self-absorbed as he is. An amusing incident he relates is a girlfriend telling him that his exercises look like a cat trying to vomit!<br />  All-in-all, I think that the book is worthwhile, and I am planning to start the diet and some of the exercises and supplements on January 1 (I knew starting during the holidays would almost guarantee that I wouldn't be able to stay on it.) I don't think that I will be sitting with an icepack on my upper back, but who knows, I might try it! If I find that it is working for me, I will update this review.

B009IEXKXI|4.0|This was a good book. I loved the idea of someone being stuck on Mars. With that said, some pages droned on and on with a tin of technical jargon. I'm not giving that any negative feedback. I'm glad (to the best of my space knowledge, which is none) that the author did the homework before writing. Not too much seemed implausible. I would recommend.

B000FZETIO|4.0|This movie is redeemed from the formulaic nature of its plot -- can poor girl and rich guy really make it together -- by some really appealing performances.  Jon Cryer, Annie Potts, and Molly Ringwald never did better work: the young James Spader is marvelous sleaze, and a very fine actor, Harry Dean Stanton, plays Molly's dad as a man totally unmanned by his wife's having left him.  However, he ends up as the voice of wisdom (if less-than-standard grammar)in the movie: \\"You can love someone, but it doesn't mean they'll love you back.\\"  His articulation of this to Molly gives her the strength to suck it up and go to the Prom alone, and it's clearly the moment that he realizes something about himself, and in our last shot of him we see him putting his wife's photo in a drawer.  The pacing of the movie couldn't be better, and the integration of the musical score with the action is great (as is the music itself, for this movie).  Any disappointments?  Only one, I think -- Andrew McCarthy just isn't a credible object of desire.

Tangled was made to be a 3D movie! It is by far the best 3D movie we own, and we own some good ones....my daughters favorite is every time she lowers her hair, mine is the lantern scene...if you are looking for a great family film is excellent 3D quality get this one, well done Disney!

B003VANOFY|3.0|I was a Plantronics fan for the longest time. Never bought any other headset and was a Razer fan for the mouse and keyboard. Come time for some upgrades and I went Logitech for EVERYTHING. Got myself a mouse (wireless), keyboard, and this headset. I thought $100, this ought to be good. Afraid not.<br /><br />First headset came in the mail and was amazing. Sound quality was solid, voice quality decent, and SO comfortable. I could wear these for hours on end and not even notice. That's where the problems occured.<br /><br />I found myself at the keyboard on my days off for about 6-8 hours. At first I thought, I don't really need this to be wireless so I plugged the gigantic (as in LONG) USB plug in and straight to my computer. Thought process was that I could charge and use at the same time. Wrong.<br /><br />Apparently this headset uses up too much juice faster than it recharges. Weird. I thought it was a fluke but turns out not so much.<br /><br />I would experience extremely LOUD and shattering squealing sounds from the headset before it would turn itself off. This is actively charging. Turns out the battery kept dying and that was it's way of saying, \\"Put me to bed\\". This happened a dozen times before I said \\"F this\\" and sent it back assuming the battery was faulty.<br /><br />I received a second headset and all was well. I ran it multiple days with no problems while on vacation and even decided to instead plug it directly to a wall outlet instead of the computer. Thought process... more juice and more reliability. Nope.<br /><br />After about four or five days... same problem. The headset squeals and then turns off. I thought the first time it happened was a fluke. It didn't happen again for a couple days, then started up yet again. Now I'm getting constant deaths from this thing right in the middle of something important (recording a video, playing a game, etc). It's frustrating.<br /><br />I went out and looked for some support. Tried the Logitech forums and made two threads. Nothing. I did find a near hundred people in various places with the exact same problem. Initially people were assuming it was driver related, but for the second go, I didn't even install the Logitech drivers. I actually wiped all drivers off the computer and used the motherboard audio driver instead. Makes absolutely no difference.<br /><br />So... I'm at a loss. I don't think I can even return this a second time... but then if I did what would I do? Get another one? Seems to me that Logitech needs to fix this issue and do it NOW before more people have this problem. The gaming organization I'm in now found these for less than $100 and were all wanting to buy them up. I told them about my problem and they canceled their purchases. I can't imagine that's what Logitech wants.<br /><br />If someone knows a solution to this problem, do let me know. But as far as I'm concerned... buyer beware.de two threads. Nothing.

B009AMANBA|5.0|I need some kind of catharsis, I think. No better pill than Lincoln. I revere him. He was different from Gandhi, yet they were so resolute to their cause. The movie is a treat in every way. The personal sacrifices of politicians, their agonies, the horrible options they have to choose from, and live with, oh, Steve, you have done a wonderful job. I cannot wait to get the DVD.
B008220D0U|4.0|Having not read any of the Lee Child books, I watched this movie with fresh eyes. For those of you expecting something fun and over the top like Red or Knight and Day, this is not that kind of movie. That said, it is fun. This movie takes you on a journey with the characters trying to solve the mystery with more realistic action and scenarios than have been in most recent movies. It is more like an old-school cop movie like Bullitt or Dirty Harry. I really enjoyed this movie. My favorite part was the car chase. It was so refreshing to see a chase put together this way. The surround sound was amazing and put you right in the action. The movie had great acting, believable but awesome action scenes, and a well thought out plot. It also wasn't too predictable. I would say it was a good show all around. If you like movies that are awesome, watch this. Now, a note on content: This movie deserved the PG-13 rating it received. There was a little bit of swearing, including the token PG-13 \\"F-word.\\" Also, if any of you are nervous about that part in the preview where you see that scantily clad woman, that is literally all you see. The bulk of the rating was for the violence, which this movie has in abundance. You see some innocent people killed, also there's some awesome hand to hand fights. Some of the killing\deaths were disturbing for my wife. Great movie overall, I was pleasantly surprised.
B005H9B44A|5.0|Loved the plot and the movie.  Nice to see a movie with good values.  Even though there was violence, it was not as graphic as I have seen in some recent films -- to me that was a plus.  Also, nice to see a movie that didn't rely on F-bombs for entertainment.

B00280LYIC|5.0|Great story to go along with Ancient History usually taught during the sixth grade.  I've read it to my classes each year.  Inspires reluctant readers to read the complete Percy Jackson series.  Gave it first to my granddaughter when it first came out.  She was in 4th grade so I picked it as the story I would read to her.  Didn't have a chance to finish it as she read ahead.  Highly recommend it.
